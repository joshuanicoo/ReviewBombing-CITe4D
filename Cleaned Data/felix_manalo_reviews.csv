charles2002,2024-01-21 00:00:00.000,"After watching GomBurZa, I got interested in checking out other Filipino religious biopics, this is the first that I watched after that. A three-hour film chronicling the life and times of Felix Manalo and his church Iglesia Ni Cristo. This film starts during his early childhood days up to his demise. It's difficult to make a biopic with such scope, other biopics tend to focus on one important event of someone's life but this film really tried to cover everything, I must say that they were able to achieve in showing the essence and ideals of the church leader in their perspective but provided merely a glimpse of the significant events that challenged the institution since they transitioned from one important event to another every 2-3 minutes. The make-up and cinematography were bland and cheap for a film hailed as the most expensive in the Philippines. The screenplay was decent but most of it came from an established material which is the Bible and the storytelling was preachy and hero-worshipping, I guess we can't avoid that because this is more of the ""basketball highlights"" of Manalo rather than an unbiased biography. It's a film you can compare to Maid in Malacañang but slightly better. This film has its merits but the obvious one-sidedness and bias towards Manalo made the film more of a propaganda.",40.0,ltbx
sammumerp,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,"Why is everything so overlit like they're all in heaven?Why are scenes where a person is talking to a table edited into like 8 shots per second?Why are there A-list celebrities being wasted playing such insignificant roles that waste their talent? Why is the sound mixing so bad? Why is the spoon stirring the tea louder than dialogue? Why does it go weirdly silent sometimes like it had been paused?Why does the main character have no emotion whatsoever? Why is 40% of his lines quoting bible verses instead of like being anything resembling a human being?Why was his first love shown when it plays no part in the movie and in any relation to him at all?Why did every problem I have go away during the WW2 scenes? Why would you suddenly show competence after 2 and a half hours of flat framing, stitled writing, dead acting, shitty sound mixing and jittery editing?And why did they make us watch this shit after we all have obviously watched it multiple times already? Fuck this shit.",30.0,ltbx

It’s no secret that the entire inc doctrine revolves around them being the true religion and true interpretation of the bible by shitting on other religions and that’s just bad. It really hurts me that a lot of inc friends of mine are traumatized bc of the cult they are under. People are brainwashed, exploited, and stolen from and I hope the members of this cult truly realize the circumstances they are under and be freed from it.",10.0,ltbx

punq,2017-01-22 00:00:00.000,"I had been looking forward to this 3 hour epic from the Philippines with it's 9,0 rating on IMDB after nearly 4,000 votes. Supposed to have the highest budget ever for a pinoy movie, and with a star studded cast. However, most of the money probable came from the Iglesia Ni Cristo sect itself, as it tells the story of their origin in a very ""inspirational"" manner. So not unlike just about every religious group sponsored film, it's cringe worthy to watch for a non-believer. Too serious and dull to engage while trying to glamorize the church founder Felix Manalo (2015).From my time in the Philippines I primarily know Iglesia Ni Cristo, with it's spectacular churches, as a place of worship for those with money. A symbol of the wast contrast in Philippines social structure. I remember in Cebu where their church was placed right next to the Norwegian flagged prostitute bars. Quite a bizarre sight. Upper and lower scale society.Anyway, compare this film to the other historic epic produced in 2015, Heneral Luna (2015), Felix Manalo (2015) is a unintentional joke. While the acting is respectable, it's still what these actors do on a daily basis on daytime soaps. Not the worst offender of religious propaganda, it serves as a part filipino history lesson, but it's not the epic it promised to be.",30.0,ltbx
