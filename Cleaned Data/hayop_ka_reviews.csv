kupatea,2020-10-29,"Good animation but story writing needs improvement: The animation was fun to watch specially that you don't see that much Filipino animation online.

The thing that I don't like about this movie is that it has too many dirty jokes that aren't that funny, and I think it would've been done better if the jokes were timed right. The story flow was messy, some parts were fast, some parts were slow. I actually found myself watching this movie with a straight face, i guess i was expecting too much since the teasers hyped me up?

Guess the way the story was written isn't my cup of tea. Kudos to those people who worked on this animation! hope to see more animation projects in the future",60.0,imdb
whiteboiii30,2020-11-04,"Good Overall: I set my expectations low, when I saw the mainstream local actors were the voice of the characters. Its premise as typical cheap romantic comedy gives me a bad vibes because of reputation of poorly-made-overused plot lines that plagues Filipino mainstream cinema. But I still give it a chance because Filipino animations are not common. I like the cultural references and the catch of the story. I think making it as adult, dark comedy animation film is a great move. In short ""Hayop Ka!"" Exceeds my expectations, 7/10.",70.0,imdb
Lloydee98,2021-01-11,"IT'S CLICHED, FUN AND QUITE TOUCHING: During the first half of ""Hayop Ka,"" tons of cliches from filipino teleseryes and movies were shown, including some funny jokes and references. But after an argument scene that features Robin Padilla's terrific voice acting, the film actually got better. Despite being quite annoying during the first half, the character of Nymfa won me over due to her journey and the ending wherein I realized that a lot of Filipinas end up with the same situation.",70.0,imdb

paul_m_haakonsen,2022-01-25,"Funny and enjoyable...: When I stumbled upon the 2020 Tagalog animated movie ""Hayop Ka!"", I had no idea what I was getting myself into here. But I read the synopsis for it, and have to say that I was somewhat intrigued, as ""Hayop Ka!"" sounded like something definitely aimed at a more mature audience.

And I will say that writers Manny Angeles, Avid Liongoren and Paulle Olivenza definitely managed to put together a story and plot that was every bit as entertaining as it was enjoyable. So yeah, ""Hayop Ka!"" was a wholesome animated feature for a mature audience. And when I say mature audience I don't mean that it is XXX-rated, but merely that there were references and hits towards lewd nature.

The art style in ""Hayop Ka!"" was strange, but enjoyably so. Initially I was a bit taken aback by the art style, but it quickly grew on me and I came to enjoy the art style that they used here because it was definitely complimenting the story and the message of the movie.

With ""Hayop Ka!"" being an animated movie, a proper voice cast ensemble is a must. And luckily they did have that here. While I am not familiar with Tagalog cinema, then I wasn't familiar with a single voice here. But I will say that the voice acting was good and definitely gave the characters life on the screen.

I found ""Hayop Ka!"" to be an enjoyable surprise of a movie, and definitely is an animated movie that I would recommend for a mature audience that enjoys light-hearted and funny stories. The fact that ""Hayop Ka!"" was told as an animation wasn't really a hindrance in any way.

My rating of director Avid Liongoren's ""Hayop Ka!"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",60.0,imdb
pzct,2020-12-26,"You Filthy Animal, Nimfa XD: Hayop Ka - About the female cat known as Nimfa, who has to decide if she wants to be with her macho boyfriend who she's been with for years or a rich gentlemen guy. The movie has it's ups and downs

Pros:

Character Designs and Animations - Let's go ahead and point this out. I thought the designs for the characters were unique. To the point where I can easily identify where these characters came from. Not only that, but the animation was beautiful!! I enjoyed the movement of these characters!

Repeating Premise with a Surprise - It has been done to death Yes. A female that's tired of her broke life so she wants a chance at the richness and luxury. That's pretty much what Nimfa does in this movie. She leaves her ex to join the rich and luxurious life. Except instead of realizing she was better off with her old life, she doesnt get neither men. Her Ex was now taken and she caught her Rich boyfriend cheating. So the premise is repetitive but there was a nice twist for me!

Roger - If I had to say which character stood out to me more, it was definitely Roger. He was the best character to me in the movie. Because he was trying his best to provide for his girl while staying loyal to her. While admittingly, he is at fault for giving her the same repetitive lifestyle she grown tired of, I felt like he didnt deserve to be lied and cheated on. Plus, his design is pretty hot owo Strong Muscular Dog

Radio Host - I forgot his name but the radio show host straight up tells Nimfa all the wrong things she did. It was the best moment because somebody needed to set things straight with her

Cons -

Third Act/Final Act - The film was going pretty solid so far. That was until the third act or the part where Roger was bailed out of jail for destruction to somebody's car and putting someone in the hospital. After that part, I personally felt like the story kind of fell apart. Nimfa does have a guilty mind for the decisions she made, which is understandable. But here is one that I felt like fell apart: Nimfa getting pregnant with Roger's baby. This was when literally Nimfa and Iningo finished having sex on the beach. She was pregnant next day and it was Roger's baby. I was confused because they havent had sex in a while! She was pretty much banging Iningo. Plus, I felt like this was a bit out of place for something like a pregnancy to happen. There are more to it but watch the film. You'll understand why I felt like the third act of the film kind of just fell apart. Not only that but the ending felt so unsatisfying. Since the third act pretty much broke apart, the ending felt unsatisfying

Overall, A solid movie at best. Of course the story is pretty much basic but with a neat rwist. I just felt like the movie was dragged down by the third act of the film",70.0,imdb
rhardo,2020-11-14,"It's a good start!: It's a good start! In fact, I can call the whole thing a masterpiece from a creative standpoint. Surprisingly, it was entertaining despite the usual Pinoy the-other-woman trope surrounding the plot (but come on... Filipinos are more than just a Telenovela audience). I have to commend the team behind this project, though, for being bold and for choosing an unconventional direction-we don't get to see a 2D-animated anthropomorphic characters featured in an adult infidelity-driven storyline everyday, do we? Overall, kudos to Rocketsheep Studio for a very fine job! The Philippine animation industry has really come a long way. Keep on!",90.0,imdb

royhectorkabanlit,2020-11-01,"A Must Watch for me: The Movie is pretty good, the dialogue is very witty, and very Filipino. Some or most of the Jokes I'm not sure Foreigners will appreciate as much, like when Nimfa said, ""sa Pares pa talaga nag propose"", LOL.

The Characterizations were also pretty good by everybody in the Cast. The Plot is also very Filipino, like Nimfa supporting her Sister's Education, etc. and it is not as predictable as you might think, there are some surprising twists in the Story also.

Stick around for the Credits, the rest of Nimfa's Story is also shown in Story Board format. And I also loved Empoy's rendition (I think it was Empoy) of Jose Mari Chan's ""Beautiful Girl"" at the end. Overall it is a Must Watch for me.",100.0,imdb

aumarivero,2020-11-20,"Past the Vulgar Theme is a Message: The Theme: Past the dirty jokes and the sex theme of this movie is a filipino masterpiece, no doubt about that. Congratulations to the makers of this film. It's not usual that Filipinos brave an animated movie production like this, so kudos to you guys for that.

The Production: Angelica, Sam and Empoy are personalities fit for their roles. The dubbing could have been improved though. This caveat for me is that there are some scenes where the emotions and interaction of the characters seem so disconnected with each other. Did they record separately? Together? It's not majority of the movie but there are just some scenes that felt like they aren't talking to each other but are just speaking in character by themselves.

But the character design, the vulgarity of the screenplay, I agree that these are great creative routes for marketing purposes. They worked for me.

And I like that this movie was able to feature a pinoy world in a not so cliche way... the saleslady, the pares house, papa george.. seeing filipino icons in an animation is so funny itself. I love these.

The Story: The ending is definitely THE conversation starter. Why did she 'happily' come back to that pares house with jerry? Isn't that place what she's trying to leave for so long? Or was it really roger she's been tired already?

Is the ending a picture of failure? As in going back to square one or zero?

Or is it a depiction of a second chance at love at the same start?

I don't know the answers but I'm happy to be intrigued.

Good job and again congratulations to the team behind this. :)",80.0,imdb
bergenkremer,2021-01-29,"Visually pleasant, rather disappointing story-wise: All that is good in this title is it's eye-catching art. Granted, I watched the English dub, so I could have missed a lot of untranslatable jokes throughout the movie, but it seemed that most of them are toilet humour and jokes for 12-year-olds anyway. The whole plot revolves around such trivial and beaten tropes that nothing in the movie strikes me as exciting or unexpected. This title could have tried to be anything else but the cheesy and unoriginal romcom that it is, and with the beautiful art direction it could be more mature and bring more to the table in terms of story and characters. The main plot doesn't grab any stars from the sky, nor does it even try to be original. My takeaway: I would love to see more projects by the animation team behind this movie, but in a title that will actually make me feel something.",50.0,imdb

Frutic,2022-01-26,"Nice graphics and amusing characters, but terrible message: The movie has been a pleasant eye candy visually, the characters somewhat enjoyable,though a bit insipid and cliché. But what is the moral of the story? Its OK to cheat? Its OK to laugh and be angry on somebody because he is poor and you want more than that, that you just like him for sex, and insult him for loving you and wanting to be with you? Not saying he was the greatest but the main character was angry at him and laughing at him for unreasonable motives.

Also throwing a fit over something she herself ends up doing, having unprotected sex resulting in a baby?

And happy in the end because..what, she made a new friend? Almost instantly after a rage fuelled cat fight with the rich guy and his""friend""

kirkespinar,2020-10-30,"Philippine Animation at its best: I loved every single bit of it. From the animation, to the witty dialogue, to the story (you'll like it better once you're aware that it's supposed to be a parody of Filipino teleserye romcom tropes), and even the music. As contrary to what some might have said about it, I actually find it to be pretty woke and progressive, with its not-so-subtle nods to current social issues such as contractualization, police brutality, etc. Like, there was even a scene in the film where you can find a poster with Duterte's face on it depicted as a literal dog; how can you be more woke than that? Politics aside, I really enjoyed the film overall. I hope Hayop Ka! manages to inspire more Filipino creatives to express the wonder of Filipino culture more and to be able to show to the world how amazing Filipino talent can be.",100.0,imdb
ArtSmart-40856,2020-10-30,"A visual feast: A visual feast. I have to pause the scenes every once in a while to appreciate every details. Imagine our chaotic metropolis interpreted by impressionist artist exploding with colors and lights. Dark scenes highlighted with glimmering lights inbetween and daytime landscapes so detailed that even captured the tangled electric cables, bumper to bumper traffic, rusty rooftops and most realities in the city we live in and yet somehow so mesmerizing to see in their own way. The same studio that created Saving Sally, you can easily tell their signature style that separates them from other animation studios here and globally. Much like Cartoon Saloon, an animation studio based in Ireland (Song of the Sea, Bread Winner to name a few of their movies) focus on their unique styles of visuals in their story telling. Each cells worthy to be printed, framed and hanged in your living room. Kudos to the talented creatives and artists. You are making a difference indeed.",100.0,imdb

It is truly a great work of art, following ""Saving Sally"". Who would have thought they'd actually release yet, another amazing show. Not to mention, The casting and dubbing for the voices of this was truly exceptional. Although, it is not an animation that can be for all ages.

breadandhammers,2023-05-12,"Delightful: A Cat meets and falls in love with the handsome and rich Wolf of her dreams, despite having an ordinary Dog boyfriend. This is a loving send-up of Filipino soap operas, with a touch of raunch and a lot of charm. The film ends with Nimfa getting pregnant with Roger's child, having broken up with both Roger, her dog boyfriend, and Inigo, her wolf boyfriend. She actually has a hinted at romantic relationship with Jerry, the Frog.

What a delightful and funny film. You feel the loving sendup of Filipino soap operas, all carried along with its charming and adorable art style. The film dips into hilarious raunch for a few moments, just enough to spice things up, but is still pretty elevated. A wonderful film. Personally, I don't think of this as a ""dirty"" film.",,imdb

ruke256,,"I was pretty much on the bandwagon with this movie, mostly because of the devoted effort that the animators have worked on from Rocketsheep Studio's last film from 2016, Saving Sally, a beautifully made film mixing animated and live-action elements in a seamless polish, only to be pulled down with a standard plot and intolerable characters. So even with my skewed expectations for this film, I still do hope that this would fare better, and...It does, but it does not at the same time. So I may as well start out with the cons before the pros, and these have to do with the story and themes itself and how the tone can clash with the animation. Given that it's rated 18, the themes that it tackles do fit well, but how they are executed is in poor taste, which does remind me of how Saving Sally executes its own mature themes, but at least this film gives these themes a bit more room for discussion, even if it's dealt with in a sour, and sometimes questionable manner. The story is simple yet dramatic and can hit some good moments. I just wished it was a bit longer and does not cut through dramatic scene to dramatic scene so quickly, which made the resolution and ending so spotty, unsatisfying, and utterly rushed. The overall tone can clash with the animation in a consistent way, as some scenes do not mesh well with the hyperbolic nature of the animation, which can make some of the melodramatic scenes to be unfit and oddly uncomfortable with the cinematic and energetic flow of the animation.Pushing the flaws aside, I will say that the animation is excellent all throughout. Smooth, expressive, and gives the characters a lot of personality. The backgrounds are detailed with anthro versions of real-life brands, mottos, and references which gives more attention to detail to the movie. And the performances for the most part are also in their A-game as well, especially Angelica Panganiban.Even despite my mixed feelings for this movie, I still do want to convince everyone to watch the film, because if the film managed to succeed in its streaming sales, then that would determine how many animated films would go down the line in the years to come. And hey, with the animation this good, who wouldn't be excited for more locally animated films such as this one?",100.0,ltbx

reeladvicenet,,"Even with all the controversy behind it recently, we want ""Hayop Ka!"" (""You Animal!"") to succeed. The film is a technical marvel with its animation and is truly a showcase on what our local artists can do. But nothing can save it from its very simple and one-sided characters and narrative - that have no redeeming values or whatsoever. Nimfa Dimaano (Angelica Panganiban) is a pretty cat who works as a perfume sales lady at a department store. Her boyfriend is Roger (Robin Padilla) who works as a janitor and already happy and satisfied with his standing in life. But Nimfa wants more and when she meets Iñigo Villanueva (Sam Milby), a super rich business dog, their chemistry ignites. Who will Nimfa choose? Roger’s unending love or Iñigo’s unending riches?Taking years to make, it seemed like much of the effort in creating ""Hayop Ka!"" was put into crafting its world of parody. If you're a Filipino viewer then every scene will be oozing with inside jokes that it was actually as amusing as the animation itself. Speaking of the animation, this is the strongest asset for ""Hayop Ka!"". The colorful and vibrant environments and palette make every scene stand out and the 2D animation had the perfect mix of feeling nostalgic and modern at the same time. The voice acting was good but not great. While the voice actors themselves handled the script well, there's just this feeling that the visuals and audio didn't match up 100%. Unfortunately, the film had poorly-written characters and narrative. It was too simple to the point that the characters themselves were one-sided and extremely flawed. The characters do ""bad things"" and there's little chance for them to redeem themselves given the film's running time of 98 minutes. We understand that this is a raunchy comedy but putting non-redeemable characters just for the sake of being in tone with its theme was a bad decision in our opinion. Overall though, ""Hayop Ka!"" at least had excellent comedy and visuals that will make you laugh - just don't expect to get anything else from the experience.

blaziker,,"Story and writing: 2.5/5Animation: 4/5Characters and voice acting: 3.5/5Overall score: 10/15Rating: Decent (3.33/5)Song: ""Love Me Like You Do"" by Ellie Goulding (from ""50 Shades of Grey"") - youtu.be/AJtDXIazrMoBeing Singaporean, it's such a pleasant surprise that Southeast Asian animation is getting better and better each year given that it's a very small industry in the region, even in 2020. I got to be honest, 2020 is the year where the small and low-budget animated movies managed to be at times on par with the mainstream giants. Hayop Ka (or You Animal), from the Philippines' Rocketsheep Studios (who also produced the unique hybrid movie ""Saving Sally"") should be included on that list.The story parodies on classic Filippino soap oprea tropes, in that it's a love triangle between a saleslady, her janitor boyfriend and a rich businessman whom she feel in love with the first time they encountered each other. One of the best things about the story is that it's one of the funniest animated movies of the year. The amount of animal-related puns, innuendos and sexual tensions justify the M18 rating there, but it also sacrificed the cohesion and flow of the love triangle, an absolute shame given that it's the writing that mainly let the whole movie down (also, a little bit too many storylines to cover in such a short frame). Still, for their first animated movie attempt, the story is still enjoyable to a certain extent.But, let's talk about the most surprising element of the movie: the animation. This is easily well animated. I know I prefer 2D animation to 3D CGI, but for an animated movie made in the Philippines, this is a solid attempt! There are moments where the colours are a little bit flat, but when the animation gets dynamic, it shows the full potential of its animation and we rarely get this type of animation anymore. Kudos to the guys at Rocketsheep for such great animation.As for characters, most of the main cast are full realised, although given its 73-minute runtime, some of the development felt rushed. I feel for the main character Nimfa (voiced by Angelica Panganiban) as she struggled to keep her affection with the rich businessman a secret as well as the two main male leads. If the story is a letdown, the entertaining characters did not.I will give Hayop Ka credit for one thing: they should not be underestimated when it comes to low budget animated movies that came out in 2020, especially when it's easily one of the most entertaining low budget animated movies of 2020. It's currently available in most Asian countries that has Netflix, so if you can't wait to support Filippino animation but you are outside Asia, do keep a lookout for its release in other countries on Netflix. Trust me, Hayop Ka is a great surprise, but I truly wish for 10 to 15 more minutes of this great animated and furry parody of typical Filippino soap opreas.",120.0,ltbx

echototheeye,,"From the creators of ""Saving Sally"" comes this Filipino adult-animated film that is a visual marvel on its own right. Animation vendor Rocketsheep Studios created a visually stunning animation with a consistent style that explodes onscreen. Plus, the visual gags and colorful sequences make it stand out.Where it falls is on its story that manages to be frustratingly unoriginal and unconsciously misogynistic. While the core narrative was inspired from an actual caller story, it just rings of the flaws of typical Filipino rom-coms. And it only made the character of Nimfa Dimaano really stale.Speaking of, while she did a decent job, Angelica Panganiban is no voice actor when doing Nimfa. The only ones to stand out in the voiceover department are Empoy Marquez as Inigo's jolly chauffeur Larry/Jerry (insert stolen ""Parks & Rec"" joke here), Arci Munoz as Nimfa's best friend Jherelyn and Piolo Pascual as a radio DJ. But they cannot get over the fact that they play stock characters.Overall, ""Hayop Ka!"" excels in the animation department but settles that with a generic and flawed story.

bentraje,,"SPOILERS all the way1) Since I watched the film with friends (through Netflix Party/Teleparty), there was entertainment in its crude dialogue and spotting out several puns, even the corny ones like in the police station: ""We Serve and Protecc"" but it became apparent, around halfway through the run time, the film has nothing else to offer.2) Inconsistent characterization with ML (Huskie). At first, he was portrayed as an arrogant rich snob by buying a whole restaurant for failing to honor his reservation. Then, for the most part, he was actually kind. Not only to the FL but to everyone. His character came back near the end where he says ""Girls no need to fight. You can share me"". But at that point it was already a hopeless case. 3) There are some potential dramatic scenes but somewhat downplayed by execution. Example near the end where the FL finds that her sister is already a parent . There is no apparent build-up. It escalated quickly, in this case, to a cat fight, which to be honest lost its effectiveness. A sample of a proper build-up is that classic ""Wag Mo Akong Ma Terry Terry"" scene. In this scene, there was also a beat of the sister returning a money FL sent through the years. I like this beat. It gives the sister a bit more depth that she is not solely living off FL's allowance and is actually serious about earning her keep. But it was just downplayed, as if it didn't happen. Like FL didn't even recognize this. It would have been nice if sister put up a fight with FL. It was all too one-sided. Also in this scene, I'm 50/50 on this. They made a joke after the dramatic scene. Can't recall it properly but it includes FL saying you are too young. You don't have breast. I might even have to breast feed your baby. Then FL's mother rebuts, don't worry I can still breastfeed while she massages her breast. Like whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut I mean per se its funny, it's just a bit out of place.4) At its current state, the writing is just an excuse to make the film rather than the basis of the film. This is a shame because the script has a potential dramatic core. I'm referring to FL discovering she is (A) pregnant not with her current BF but with her recent ex, (B) who happens to now be with her best friend and all the while (C) her sister is also pregnant. The way I would see it is her sister represents hope so seeing that hope broken also affects her. Another depth is the FL is now being a hypocrite by not practicing what she preach which is use contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancy . As you can see, there are a lot of events that carry the film. If only that drama happened much earlier and they tackled it properly with proper thought process, it would have be a concrete film. What happened in the film is FL goes to radio station and asks for advice. I mean how lazy can you be? I can't wholeheartedly recommend Jowables but at least that film did justice to unwanted pregnancy plot point5) So, for the most part of the film, our FL is the ""bad character"" for intentionally cheating. One way or another, the film will eventually redeem her. Apart from having unwanted pregnancy which audience pity, the film ""redeems"" FL by having FL's ex hook up with FL's best friend . I actually don't mind this per se. What I mind is the ex instantly became an asshole and the FL's best friend a bitch. Oh if you're wondering how does this redeem the FL, it's the case of ""I am bad, but other people do more bad to me. So I'm not that bad"" kind of narrative. It's subtle but, since at this point, the FL is now a total underdog, the audience will naturally root for her, to some degree.6) Part of #4. If only we get the side of FL's ex and FL's best friend after hearing about the pregnancy. Would have been a proper film. 7) The music, both the BGM, fx, foleys etc, are somewhat shabby choices. Can't really support this one since I'm not a music/audio person but it's the type not quite for film-material. 8) I also don't get why the characters need to be animals. In Zootopia or Beastars, it makes sense because it's part of their discrimation plot point (i.e. prey vs predator). The only reference I can is in the title ""Hayop Ka"" where the FL obeys her survival or pleasure instinct like an animal. They could have been just human characters and it wouldn't make much difference. 9) The FL's love problem is somewhat resolve by hooking up with the driver character, the frog. I'm not sure what to feel about that. 10) I like the ending montage sequence.",80.0,ltbx

Gosh, Filipino animation definitely needs more support.In line with that need for support,major oof for the narrative. Nimfa isn't a character you would actually root for, sadly. I'm really sad how the plot is constructed and how it ended. I was really annoyed at the part wherein Nimfa was being dragged down even more for her ""human choices"" like oof, she was legit called out in a really terrible way on live radio. Gosh that was really an oof. PLUS, THAT WAS A CLIMAX MAN HHHHH. This film pretty much used a lot of stereotypes commonly seen in Filipino media hhhhhhh. Love triangles, the romanticization of pregnancy, cinderella stories, misogyny, rich families, and kinda a lot more, just oof, really. There's kinda a lot of romanticization hhhhh. Nimfa tries to be a redeeming character who's slightly politically and socially aware but that's not enough to redeem herself as a protagonist. I enjoyed a lot of the animation and references mostly. The fight scenes and change of animation styles throughout the story is what honestly allowed me to stay hooked in this film. This Filipino animation film is another huge step for animation in the country, but it is also a wake-up call for Filipino storytellers to change the landscape of storytelling. Yes, we should serve the masses and let them relate. but the more we maintain those tropes and stereotypes, the more we are to promote them in actual society which SHOULD NOT be the norm. We need more progressive stories to influence both the youth and adults. The voice acting though needs a bit of work. Also, well oof for some of the voice actors hhhhhhhh.

phantomess,,"I can't take Hayop Ka! seriously because the main character has the same name as my mom (and me, kind of) and it's just pretty disturbing when they say her name during the sex scenes. But then, this film shouldn't be taken seriously in the first place. It's satirical and beyond raunchy. In short, the film is meant to be offensive. Nevertheless, the story and writing was very mediocre. They could've incorporated a better storyline. Also, the dialogue annoyed me so much that I kept cringing and making faces. The characters were dumb with no redeeming qualities. I'm kind of bummed because this had so much potential to be good. I actually wanted to give this a 2-star but changed my mind because the animation was incredible. Kudos to the Filipino animators! Overall, Hayop Ka! is pretty much an average film. I was so excited for this, but my expectations fell short. It's not that bad and it made me a laugh a bit, but there were several corny/cringey moments that I wanted to skip through.

But holy shit I wish they had a different script.The writing in itself is thematically flawed which would have been okay if it wasn't for the portrayal in itself. I appreciate the efforts of the film for tackling certain issues such as the woes of the working class, contractualization, and such. But who is this story for?Is it simply trying to portray the struggles of a modern working-class woman? Is this supposed to be a commentary for something bigger? Why does this film feel like it's an MMK episode with a high production value?I discussed this film with my boyfriend, and we both agreed that perhaps the target audience of this film is the masses and the working class. This is quite ironic because the film was released on Netflix (which caters to mostly the privileged people).Direction wise, boy I wish they hired professional VOs instead. The film would have been more bearable. The surprising delight for me is Sam Milby's performance as a VO. He's the only competent performance in the film for me.My main beef with the film is that it’s a very well made film with an awful story that perpetuates the system it wants to critique in the first place.Cheers, nonetheless to the hardworking artists behind this film.

tuesjays,,"Rocketsheep Studios needs to stop hiring shitty writers. This is not going to convince a lot of people to support animation, if the thing that they're animating is crude, disgusting and reminiscent of the problems plaguing local entertainment.This movie is an amalgamation of everything familiar and stereotypical of an afternoon at a local TV channel: homewreckers, cheaters, exaggerated rich-poor conversations, and all the things regular viewers across the country seem to swoon over on the daily. The folks over at Rocketsheep seem to think that this makes for a passable idea in the animation department. Did it work? Yes. Do I like it? FUCK NO.If the goal of this cartoonish re-imagining of a soap opera is to drown it in cutely-drawn pastel-style animation interspersed with clear homages to GMA-7's Astig Authority (afternoon segments where international anime series are dubbed in Tagalog for local audiences), then congratulations, they're going to successfully hook in the support. But to explicitly juxtapose this advocacy of creative animation with the morally replete narratives of your average Philippine soap is just deplorable. What they're doing here, is making a statement that the only way to somehow succeed and get more support from everyone is to just get what already works for the masses. This isn't something I look forward to if the future of the industry is really dictated by the preposterous concept that is this movie.Put it this way, the story can just as easily be inserted as a real-life adaptation in the hands of grubby network executives. If independent studios like Rocketsheep are already behaving in the same manner when it comes to advocating the #SupportLocal mentality, then we have a big problem here.And for the love of god, DO NOT TELL ME THIS BULLSHIT IS SATIRE. Where is the humor? The dialogue is supposed to be funny? Jesus christ, none of the writers here can write for shit.

I can't blame them though, Tagalog isn't the easiest thing to translate, especially with the contextual jokes used. I'm not fond of the story at all, could've been a lot better.

It looked notably distinct- it’s not Japanese nor western. What I really like about Makoto Shinkai’s animated films is that he tries to emulate real world Tokyo; and that is also what I felt like they tried to do in this film with Metro Manila.The storyline, on its very core, is just really pointless. Again, I don’t know how you pitch these films to producers. On top of its ridiculous story, the dialogues are just childish. The way they try to sexualize everything; it’s not even worth a single chuckle, but a facepalm.

I haven't watched this movie, and the only way you'll make me see this movie is if my viewing of the movie will not support the movie in any way.I'm writing this review right now to post my stance regarding this movie.I am all for supporting local animation studios, but my support will never come in the form of blind support. We've already heard the stories and news everywhere of Robin Padilla being casted as a character in the movie and while I do not support Robin Padilla in any way, his casting isn't what doesn't sit right with me.What doesn't sit right with me is the fact that Joyce Bernal is one of the producers of the film. For the ill informed, Joyce Bernal is a D/D/S director who is the director behind all of D/utert/e's SONAs (among some other terrible movies that she's also directed). Not only that, but Piolo Pascual is also a producer. While Piolo Pascual hasn't directly come out as a supporter of D/utert/e, he has previously worked with Joyce Bernal on a project in support of D/utert/e, and that makes him an enabler. So, we now have three D/D/S supporters/enablers involved with the movie. THAT'S what doesn't sit right with me. Surely there are other producers or actors they could've approached?I will never support the art or the creative works created by or produced/financed by supporters of this horrible administration and nor bootlickers who try to act ""apolitical"" despite being enablers themselves.Again, I am for the support of the works of local animation studios, but should that support come blindly all in the name of ""support lokal""?",,ltbx

primecruz,,"I wasn’t planning on writing reviews when i made a letterboxd account. I just wanted to lurk, read reviews, check out people’s lists, stalk user profiles and yes, read every single review to every movie I directed because i like crying myself to sleep at night. But after watching hayop ka and reading the reviews here, i was compelled to write something. Because i don’t get why people hate it so much. For me, it’s a dark comedy that tackles realities of class and socio-economic disparity in the Philippines. Nimfa’s problem is simple: she’s poor. She has to break her back working as a saleslady to pay for her sister’s tuition and pay rent, she has pares to look forward to during special occasions because that’s all she and her boyfriend could afford, she can’t even go to a motel for some sexy time. This isn’t necessary a problem except for one thing: Nimfa is dissatisfied. She is not happy with her situation. She wants more. But what can she do? She didn’t graduate and it’s very likely that she’ll be a saleslady forever. So can you really blame her when she “falls” for Iñigo? A handsome rich guy who showers her with attention? If you were in her situation, wouldn’t you? I would. So she makes one bad choice after another. Should we hate her for it? What would we rather see? Tanggapin nalang niya yung buhay niyang ganun? Ok lang yang pares ghorl masarap naman. Beauty in poverty ganun? She sees a way out, and she grabs it. I am not entirely happy with her choice but i understand why she did it. Eh sa sawa nang maging mahirap ’yung tao e. The bad choices that Nimfa makes are greatly influenced by her circumstances, circumstances that are forced upon her because she is poor. Yes cliche. Yes lagi nalang mahirap/mayaman storyline but maybe there’s a reason why the boss-katulong trope(the powerful loving the powerless) works so well in our country. Maybe it’s because most of us Filipinos still see that as the only means of escape.And hayop ka lays bare that truth: If you’re poor, falling in love out of economic need is very much a reality. This truth is prevalent in our narratives, even if they aren’t explicitly stated. Some top of mind examples are Laida Magtalas falling in love with sir Miggy(A very special love) or Maya with Sir Chief(be careful with my heart). Fuck i’m old😭😭 The difference in hayop ka is that it does away with romantics and explicitly states, with ice cold pragmatism: I am in love with you because I am poor, because you are my best option to escape this life. It’s tragic how in the world presented in hayop ka, genuine romantic love is a privilege for the rich.And another note, can i just say that the art direction is fucking gorgeous. Making drawings move is an expensive and time-consuming affair and you have to find ways to get your point across in as few frames as possible. Hayop ka borrows some techniques from Japanese animation which it uses brilliantly and comically. Future animations will surely use this film as a reference.-1 half star lang pala for too much sexual jokes. Not that im offended or anything and i’m totally fine with women exhibiting the same sexual libido and desire as men, it’s just that there were too many and most of them weren’t funny. -1 half star ulit for the ending with empoy the frog. I get that the film had to end on a somewhat lighthearted note, after it literally kicked rich prince charming out the window, mejo corny lang yung promo ng walang ka paris and laughter laughter. Other than that, methinks this is a solid film that illustrates the relationship that exist between class and love. Aesthetically, this is an important milestone in local animation and will surely be used as a peg by future similar project.Tang ina 5 na amf. Dami ko sinabi wala namang babasa.

The film is deceptively simple, but functions intelligently to provide a scathing representation of the cyclical, problematic lives of the working class Filipino: their desensitisation to the methods they cling onto for their own economic benefit, the internalized sexist and especially misogynistic paradigm that remains hegemonic among both Filipino men and women, and how all this disturbingly becomes the mundanity of everyday life in a third-world country. Moreover, although the narrative might simply appear as an animated rehash of what has plagued local TV for years, it cleverly utilizes these teleserye tropes to construct a sociological examination on capitalism's destruction to society; more specifically, to the Filipinos that belong to the lower end of the social strata. Past the painfully realistic reconstruction of the plight of the working class in film, the portrayal on the bourgeoisie is also excellently handled; they're cruel and selfish, despite the already comfortable lives that they live. Hence, the anthropomorphism of these animals becomes a clever display of how capitalism has made literal animals out of us— easily succumbing to carnal desires and almost devoid of empathy.Aside from the thematic complexity of Hayop Ka!, the meticulously beautiful animation is extremely noteworthy as well. Sadly, this film has been misread by most of its viewers— its intelligent writing and thematic complexity ignored due to its vulgar, yet realistically absurd humor. Needless to say, Hayop Ka! is up there thematically, and can even suffice to be the lovechild of two classics that eloquently critique capitalism: last year's Parasite, and 1962 Mexican film The Exterminating Angel. Definitely one of the year's best!",200.0,ltbx

profkeating,,"2019 gave us DEAD KIDS. 2020 gave us HAYOP KA. And funnily enough just like last year, I find myself in the minority who enjoyed this.There have been polarizing opinions surrounding the film's true colors: Is it a satire on the Philippines' kitsch, recycled plotlines for film and TV? Or is it just a complete piece of trash poorly dressing up as a story? I'm inclined towards the former, but I hear the latter's argument.Like DEAD KIDS, I think it's important (if you want an enjoyable watch) to see the film for what it is: Pure entertainment. It doesn't have to be deep unless you want it to. Personally, Nimfa Dimaano's story ain't that deep. It truly felt like I was just listening to an anon's juicy anecdote on some love advice radio segment, which the film was loosely based on and have the faintest clue of.The animation more than makes up for the storyline as it offsets the trashiness with charming visuals. Good job for local animators!And the voice actors were really good and well-cast. They brought out the personalities of the characters that they were portraying especially Angelica Panganiban's Nimfa.Overall, I think some people need to chill out a bit though I understand the frustration. It's not the history-making Filipino animated film that a lot of us wanted, but be glad that it's there and the doors it can open.",140.0,ltbx

And can I just say, whoever did the backgrounds...Kudos to you guys, whew.Character development is where this film falls terribly short. I get that the whole thing was a satire on the Filipino teleserye, but eventually, you need to create characters we can root for. ""Hayop Ka"" has no one to root for and everyone to despise. The goals of each character were incredibly shallow and in the end you just hope they all get what's coming to them. The ""happy"" ending was definitely forced and undeserved.In spite of my criticisms, I do not think this film deserves the backlash it's getting. It's a very admirable effort and it can serve as an important stepping stone for future, superior animated films in this country. So no, don't boycott this film just because you disagree with its morals (it's not supposed to be for kids in the first place) or because it features a voice actor whose politics are against yours.

As what one of my friends said it the best on his Twitter, think of it as a movie adaption of the 'I Will Survive' Zootopia fan comic.

ferjackson,,"Hayop Ka! es una película animada para adultos de Filipinas, cuyo título vendría a ser un insulto, algo así como ""eres un animal"" o ""eres un hijo de puta"". Este es el primer filme animado para adultos que ha creado este país, por lo que eso de por sí merece un reconocimiento. La película trata de un trío amoroso entre una gata, nuestra protagonista, y dos perros, uno pobre y otro millonario. Dicho sea desde ya que, a mi parecer, la historia es el punto débil de la película, suele caer en territorios clichés melodramáticos que se han visto miles de veces; sin embargo, aún así tiene un buen ritmo y sus personajes son expresivos y cómicos y logran sacar adelante la trama.Donde Hayop Ka! se luce por completo es en su trabajo de animación. La película es hermosa visualmente, en especial los diseños de los fondos, los cuales son coloridos y llenos de detalles. También hay momentos donde la animación cambia repentinamente y esto le aporta un estilo particular y buen humor. Eso sí, claramente hay algunos guiños presentes que sólo un filipino podrá entender.En términos generales, estoy más o menos en la mitad con esta película.

cocaconan,,"Have waited for this film since one of its earliest teasers were out. Got around to watch it this day with adjusted expectations considering the political climate (not only of the country but also the stance of the attached producers and a lead actor) and my personal view of the studio's previous effort Saving Sally (2016).It plays out as a telenovela/teleserye/soap opera with themes of infidelity. The greatest standout is the animation and design even with a vague story in the background that is a lot more interesting than the main story (endo, abortion, labor strikes, etc.) Which is kind of expected as the Philippines is one of the major places of outsourcing in a lot of known animated projects (film, video games, visual effects).The voice acting is fine but could be better either with a good voice cast director or hiring the professional dubbers (which is also a rising industry here but lack of support and recognition over popular celebrities).The decision to make the cast anthropomorphic animals is likely to avoid an uncanny valley feeling. Though I also saw it as playing with their strengths as one of the strengths of Saving Sally was its monster/creature designs. Though it doesn't make a difference here if they did it with human figures anyway.

millenna,,"this is concrete proof that once the Philippines' film industry starts taking artists and writers seriously (and paying them right!) that good movies like this are possible. as a Filipino, i've only been blown away by a few local animations in my whole existence and that's because most of it are either poorly created or have stories that lack depth. this is not the creators' faults though, because there is little to none moral and financial support from production companies enough to bring out the full potential of local filmmakers. major props to the creators behind the scenes whose efforts have been visibly seen throughout the film. obviously, the animation for this is the movie's strongest suit and the attention to detail whilst incorporating humor is purely amazing! the story on the other hand, is molded from the current Filipino culture thus there is a familiarity towards it and it appeals to its targeted audience. if you're a foreigner, you won't be able to understand all the inside jokes but you'll be able to comprehend enough of what the country and the people are like, even if it's portrayed as an anthropomorphic society.",200.0,ltbx

gem37,,"You have no idea the effort I put in to actually watch this, and I can't really recommend it to anybody else - an animated film with spot-on Cartoon Network aesthetics, relentless sex jokes, and a setting (Metro Manila) where I spent a lot of my formative years. Clearly, this work was calling me.So let me make this plain: this film's sexual and gender politics are - put charitably - regressive. The humor is largely juvenile, with not a single innuendo left unsaid. And the story is propelled by thoroughly unlikable characters.But... I was ultimately entertained. A large part of that was just pure nostalgia for the Phillipines, getting to see all signifiers I remembered (The Supermall! Jeepnies!) and several I forgot (the wire mesh displays for drinks, holy shit!) The animation and design are lovely, but are helped by some truly genius visual comedy and meme references. And for as selfish as our protagonists are, I thought their motives made sense. The story may go full soap opera, but at least it's never boring.From what I've seen on Letterboxd, most of the reviews compliment the film's look but criticize it for perpetuating tropes of clasism and misogyny that are apparently well-represented in Filipino media. For all the time I spent living there, I never really watched much that was locally made, and am only vaguely familiar with the craziness that has been going on with the current government.As a piece of satire, I thought this worked. But, I'm also not the smartest guy I know.",,ltbx

After reading a lot of the reviews calling the film misogynystic, i had to reassess my own reading, and although i understand where people are coming from, i disagree. Nimfa was a strong woman in touch with her femininity and her own sexuality, she has ambitions and the choices she made was for herself. Although that radio DJ was really spouting chauvinistic things, i thought it was established by the movie that the radio program was misogynystic. (As a person who had to endure THAT radio program during my cab rides, i agree with that sentiment.) Besides, she was awarded her own agency at the end.

mithras_,,"Getting back to the r/letterboxd Film Raffle after my 6 month hiatus with this wild recommendation from Antoine! I also get to add one more country to My Cinematic TravelsI actually really liked this and even if I hadn’t I would still appreciate how the film raffle gave me the chance to see it. I can guarantee I would have never seeked out a Filipino adult animated furry film on my own.... The animation is fantastic. I absolutely loved the style, effects and great attention to detail and really appreciate the effort that must have gone into making it. This is even more impressive considering it’s from a country that isn’t known for its animated works or even live-action film industry really. I enjoyed the humour a lot, both the dark comedy and the immature dirty jokes. Comedy is universal, but I’m sure it would have been funnier to people who speak the language and can relate to the culture. Or they could have hated it much more judging by all the very low ratings on Letterboxd. They seem to be judging this for the presence of some questionable names in the cast/crew and for being misogynist and encouraging toxic behaviour. I obviously can’t speak for the former, but to me this very much seemed like a satire poking fun at toxic masculinity rather than trying to encourage it. It also seemed to have some surface level commentary on class and how love is sometimes a luxury only the rich can afford. I didn’t feel like it had something whether the actions of Nimfa, Roger and Inago were justified nor did they seem to want the audience to make up their mind. This is obviously much less concerned with sending a message than with making a funny piece of entertainment, and I was certainly very entertained. The ending was the only part I didn’t enjoy and it seemed totally inconsistent with the rest. I don’t have much more to say other than warn everyone about Netflix’s evil furry agenda. Furries are degenerates that must be combatted at all costs (/s... I think) and yet Netflix continues to promote the likes of this and shows like Beastars... and they even have the audacity to be pretty good. It’s interesting how the language spoken is a mixture of English and Tagalog which does happen in certain segments of Egyptian society but not to this extent. Is this how the average person from the Philippines speaks or is it another level of satire?",160.0,ltbx

themilliemania,,"It's a Filipino animated film, I think one of the first feature length animated film from the Philippines? And my god is this film sexually charged. Like, I knew going in that it was a soap opera-esque love triangle type thing that very much took advantage of appealing to adults, but man I didn't expect it to go like it did. The pacing is alllllllll over the place, and a lot of tensions in the film don't get resolved. Despite that though? It's actually kind of nice. I dunno if I'd watch it again, but overall, I'm glad I watched it. Nimfa, the main character, is a bit unlikable at times -- she's unfaithful as hell and has some priorities a bit mixed, and can be somewhat hypocritical at times -- but the entire cast is flawed in some form. It's very grounded in that sense, and she's not above growing. Her two love interests are similar. Roger, he's rough around the edges, but overall is a nice dude... albeit with a temper, and real poor money management skills. Iñigo is the other -- a tried and true stereotypical businessman type, slinging deals and reveling in his riches. Overall a nice dude, though very much enjoys all the whims his life offers. If you don't like soapy drama or heavily sexually charged energy (my god), it wouldn't be for you, but it is BEAUTIFULLY animated. The style is distinct and very nice to look at, and it has gorgeous fight scenes, of all things. If interest is relatively piqued, I'd say find a way to watch it, it's worth at the very least it's runtime.",120.0,ltbx

abrealad,,"This movie stinks. First off, the animation is goddamn gorgeous. It’s really good and it’s something I honestly didn’t expect going into this movie. It’s clear to me that everyone in the animation department for this movie just let loose and went bananas with charm and colors that pop. It creatively welcomes the audience and allows them to find delight in a world where people are, in essence, human-animal hybrids without them reeling back and thinking “wtf are these human-animal hybrids”I didn’t think about this until the very end of the movie, but secondly, the voice acting was also surprisingly decent in my opinion. Something I also did not expect. The dialogue felt organic because of that, and because the lines were never dry nor dull. Unfortunately, that’s everything good about this movie. I see this film as another dished-out entry in the Filipino film industry, as nothing sets it apart from other films of said industry (apart from the animation). It doesn’t bring anything new to the table plot-wise, since everything that’s been done here feels like, no wait, IS something that’s been done by so many other goddamn movies (albeit in a lighter tone) I can’t even begin to count. I just think this: if we strip this movie of the obviously gorgeous animation, if we take out the witty/funny lines, the voice acting, the editing, if we just leave the plot all on its own, will it still be able to stand all by itself? To me, the answer is a big fat no. It isn’t a very good story in my opinion, and as I’ve said, this is in essence a movie with themes and elements that are in many other Filipino movies, executed and presented almost exactly the same way most of the time. You don’t have to look or try very hard to find hit-or-miss jokes, cheesy lines, and bad writing along with classism, misogyny, and adultery among other things as themes in other Filipino films/series. Also there are times when, weirdly, the movie kind of asks the audience to take a certain scene or moment seriously, but then it wusses out and overshadows said moments with *funny action scene!*, stopping anyone from caring about our protagonist’s worries, doubts, and hurt. It could not commit to a pause just a while to let us feel and instead convinces itself that *funny action scene!* is necessary to maintain attention. Now if you find this movie enjoyable, if you were able to whole-heartedly enjoy it the whole time, all the way, I would not diss or condemn you for it. If anything, I actually envy that you were able to get something out of the time you spent with this movie. I just find it odd how some people who did enjoy this movie go out of their way and say “Oh yeah? Well, you just didn’t get it! It’s actually satire dummy and well, what did you expect? Disney? Pixar???” to people who disliked the movie. When….okay let’s talk about this for a bit. Firstly, in my opinion, if it was really satire then it still didn’t do a very good job. At no point did the movie mock the themes and elements it was said to make fun of, nor did it make a point that it was indeed satirical, subtle or otherwise, like a satire would do. It was just doing it’s own thing without…….satire. If that’s the case, then it’s just a regular Filipino screenplay with a “satire” sticker slapped onto it. Secondly, I find it weird when people say “What did you expect? Disney? Pixar???” as if it’s okay to stay in a box contented, conforming to the usual formula without experimenting, venturing out or aspiring to have as strong an emotional connection and impact with the audience as Disney/Pixar movies. This is not to say it SHOULD BE Disney/Pixar. I’m just saying any piece of art isn’t worth much if it isn’t the best it could be, if it never went the distance, if it never evolves and adapts. That’s my two cents. Great animation, lackluster story. My stars go to the animators and the few jokes and moments that actually made me laugh.",80.0,ltbx

I'm sure that's part of the style of these shows but aside from adding in a few fun anime style quirks to the proceedings it doesn't do anything to really satirise the genre enough and comes off like a frat boys take on rom-coms, which doesn't work as a rom com or a satire.

thatshelf,,"There are a couple of things one needs to know prior to delving into a satire like Hayop Ka! The Nimfa Dimaano Story. First: the film is inspired by popular Filipino telenovelas. These beloved soap operas usually feature characters who scream “Hayop Ka!,” which translate to “You Animal!” or “You Son of a B****”, in the height of conflict.The fact that the central figures in director Avid Liongoren’s cheeky animated comedy are, in fact, animals should tell you what type of film you are watching.The second thing to note is that shock jock radio hosts have increasingly become surrogate therapists for those who lack the funds to get professional advice. This is a double-edged sword though as the hosts usually turn the caller’s personal hardships into humiliating spectacles for ratings. While this unfair trial by public opinion appears in the later sections of the film, Hayop Ka! The Nimfa Dimaano Story keeps its feet firmly in the soapy waters of melodrama throughout.Read Courtney Small's full review: thatshelf.com/fantasia-2021-hayop-ka-the-nimfa-dimaano-story/",,ltbx

(I’m filipino and raised there, so I know what I’m talking about) It’s always toeing the line between misogyny and feminism which is just a really odd thing to behold. It would’ve been awesome if the movie had something real to say about women in modern day Manila, but coming from the point of view of male writers and directors who are enamored with the idea of this being a pastiche of the old bold-star era of Philippine cinema, it was never gonna go down that route. Which, it is a shame because it had all the ingredients to do so. That being said, it works well as a glimpse into life within modern day Philippines, with its matter-of-fact way of showing social and class divides and the strange double standards on gender that are the result of colonial patriarchy being thrust into an inherently matriarchal society. The humor is also quintessentially filipino with its focus on puns (jokes that are so lost in translation that the subtitles are basically a whole different screenplay).",140.0,ltbx

And she ended up facing the consequences of that mistake alone. But I don’t think punishing the woman should be the lesson here.

gerigravity,,"Hindi ko rin alam kung bakit ko pinanood 'tong Hayop Ka! ni Avid Liongoren, siguro dahil curious ako sa ""unang Pinoy adult animation"" sa Netflix. Pero matapos ang isang oras at labinlimang minuto, isa lang ang masasabi ko: hindi benta ang kalibugan ng mga hayop.Yes, maganda ang animation. Hindi maitatangging pulido, colorful, at may effort ang mga animators. Halatang pinag-isipan nila yung detalye ng ""animal version ng Pilipinas."" Witty yung names ng lugar, makulay ang background, at minsan may mga visual gags na effective. Pero sayang, kasi lahat ng ganda, tinabunan ng isang script na parang binunot sa pinakababa ng basura ng Philippine showbiz.Nakakabwisit yung sobrang sexualization ng mga karakter. Oo, satire daw. Oo, gusto raw magpatawa gamit ang bold jokes. Pero ang kinalabasan, parang hyper-sexualized telenovela na hindi malaman kung seryoso ba siyang commentary sa class divide o gusto lang niyang gawing ""bomba cartoon"" si Nimfa. May mga lewd puns na hindi nakakatawa, may mga eksena na parang lowbrow radio drama, at may ending pa na pinilit gawing redemption arc gamit ang ""nice guy"" trope. Ang suffocating din ng casual misogyny na parang diniktahan kang kamuhian si Nimfa for making choices na, in reality, rooted sa kahirapan niya.Ang daming Pinoy teleserye clichés dito. Mayaman vs. mahirap, kabit-kabit, pangarap makaahon sa hirap, tapos puro moralizing sa dulo. Kung satire nga talaga, bakit parang mas kinampihan pa ang mga luma at problematikong values? Parang instead of poking fun at them, nire-recycle lang nila.Props lang sa animators! Sila lang talaga yung nagdala ng pelikula. Hindi nila kasalanan na yung script ay puno ng infidelity, sexism, at macho bullshit na hindi na dapat sinusubo pa sa audience. Sa totoo lang, mas deserve nilang bigyan ng proyekto na mas meaningful at hindi ganitong caricature ng lahat ng maling bagay sa local entertainment industry.TLDR: Kung gusto mong makita kung ano ang hitsura ng Zootopia kung ginawa siyang panghapon na teleserye na puno ng sabaw na kabitan, eto na 'yon.

hannavyr,,"The first time I watched Hayop Ka!, I honestly just saw it as a bastos movie, parang puro kabastusan lang HAHA. But upon rewatching it, I realized the concept is actually liberating and surprisingly close to reality. Its vibrancy and exaggerated humor felt more like satire—a playful but biting critique of how consumerism shapes the world we live in.Through a realist lens, the film mirrors the everyday struggles of many Filipinos, though wrapped in an animated, comedic package. The stark contrast between the rich and the poor was a constant theme. How privilege dictates not only opportunities but also relationships. Even love in the film is framed by class and material wealth, showing how affection is often entangled with survival and status.From a Marxist perspective, Nimfa’s relationships expose how capitalism and consumerism seep into our most intimate desires. Her dissatisfaction with her current boyfriend and her attraction to a wealthier partner may seem superficial at first, but it reflects how the system conditions people to equate love with upward mobility and financial security. The film satirizes how consumer culture commodifies even emotions and human connection, turning them into transactions rather than purely personal bonds.Looking at it through feminist theory naman, my initial impression of Nimfa as ""malandi"" for wanting more felt unfair. On rewatch, I realized this judgment reflects how women are often shamed for pursuing their desires, especially if those desires break away from traditional expectations. The film suggests that Nimfa’s choices are not purely personal flaws but rather shaped by the larger forces of patriarchy and capitalism, where women are pressured to chase an “ideal” version of love, security, and femininity. It questions why women are criticized for seeking better lives, while men who fail to provide are rarely scrutinized in the same way.In the end, Hayop Ka! may seem chaotic and shallow at first glance, but digging deeper, it becomes a satirical mirror of our society; where class, consumerism, and gender roles intersect to shape even the most personal aspects of life like love and relationships.",160.0,ltbx
fayelune27,,"Nimfa should’ve gotten an abortion, just sayinSurprisingly enjoyed this silly anthro telenovella. Pacing is pretty off and nobody is truly likeable here, but the animation is wonderful, I quite like how they drew backgrounds and cityscapes. But holy shit we spent the whole movie wanting to end the cycle of poverty, and it ends with her raising her baby as a single mom…? And despite its pretty neutral portrayal of female sexuality in the beginning, she gets shamed for having sex by that weirdo radio jockey, gross. We should be past this “children are a punishment for having sex” type of plotline already. Not surprised that the billionaire boyfriend thing didn’t work out, not just because he’s had a history of cheating but because Nimfa had shitty communication skills and kept pushing away Inigo so…But honestly these half star reviews are a bit harsh.

davidnigelco,,"I remember all the hype about this back in 2020! Shame it took a course in my fourth/last year of college before I pressed play on this…Anyway, I thought this was effective and authentic. Your way of life and finances really do dictate how you live your life tbh… the resentment towards each other (Nimfa, a saleslady, belittling his janitor boyfriend) is real; you resent each other because you both cannot lift each other up, yet the system is unfortunately devised in a way that keeps you both down. While it very much feels like something so inspired by films from the late 2010s, its themes held up really well. Five years after its release, I’ve never seen class resentment be so pervasive all over. Watching this in 2025 made me realize that wow, this has been a dilemma for ages. Nimfa resorts to participating as a caller in a radio program, whose misogynist host attacks her for her decisions. However, Nimfa’s actions were dictated so by her circumstances; you cannot blame someone for doing what they do if they’re in the margins of society. I really liked how Raffy Tulfo was satirized here. Its ending was a bit too far-fetched, if you watched in 2020. But in a time that is currently very much intent on ‘eating the rich,’ and after Luigi Mangione did what he did, it’s not far-fetched anymore. Maybe this film was ahead of its time tbh… Anyway, I was cracking up over several jokes. I particularly liked the scene where Nimfa’s workmate was revealed to be fucking Nimfa’s boyfriend 😂 just insane throughout.I just didn’t really like the abundance of sexual jokes… it felt incredibly juvenile. If you get off on making animals freaky, then please go all the way, instead of showing them moaning so sexually and then revealing they’re just having a foodgasm. This was hailed as a boundary-pushing film, but all I got was a work that felt too afraid to be unabashedly themselves. You’d get the respect you crave if you own the furry freak in you. Nonetheless though, I think it’s a good critique on the system that pits the poor against each other! It aged well.",120.0,ltbx

Where was that great humor when it mattered? The animation can be enjoyable, but I scarcely enjoyed everything else. Sam Milby's was the only voice over that sounded right... and yeah that's really Robin Padilla there, I bet everything he spat felt natural.This could've had a huge potential to be enioyabe and successful, even just locally.I think sex jokes can only be enjoyable when exchanged quietly, between two people who actually have bussiness being all over each other.

nikarue,,"Unang una, animation-wise, ang ganda. Ang effort ng mga animator may detail, style, at fluidity. Pero doon na nagkaproblema sa kwento. Sadly, the plot just didn’t hold up. Kahit gaano pa kaganda ang animation, kung paulit-ulit pa rin ang narrative themes, walang bago at walang depth hindi na rin kayang isalba ng visuals even though I'm a sucker for visuals, masarap sa mata kaso ang hirap i-ignore 'yung nilalangaw na plot.I'm not expecting some Pixar story plotline pero it doesn't hurt to criticize kung paano nila in-execute.Usual tropes na naman: cheating, class divide, misogyny, poverty porn, and outdated character stereotypes. Nakakapagod na panoorin kasi parang wala ng bagong sinasabi. Instead of elevating the story with the animation, parang mas lalo lang na-highlight kung gaano kababaw at problematic ‘yung plot. Even the dialogues felt off awkward, minsan cringey, minsan tone-deaf. Imbes na ma-immerse ka sa kwento, nadidistract ka sa kung gaano ka unnatural pakinggan ng mga linya. Sayang. Ang ganda ng animation, pero nasayang sa isang plot na hindi masyadong pinag-isipan or nag-stick sa classic tropes ng Philippine media.

I thought it would follow the usual formula of the characters getting back together and whatnot as if nothing happened, but the film took a different turn. So, it wasn’t entirely bad in that regard.Also, the casting of voice actors.

jyujinplus,,"I really wish I could figure out just why this is rated so low on Letterboxd. If ever there was a movie I wanted to have a conversation about, this is it, because I fail to see why this really fun, slightly dramatic, but overall interesting slice of life is so universally panned. I think it goes without saying to praise the animation in Hayop-ka - it’s smooth and moves fluidly, it leaves itself open for some really impressive expressions and powerful images in scenes. The backgrounds are picturesque, and create a very vivid feeling of what this version of the Philippines is like: lively, energetic, maybe a little crowded but full of interesting characters. I think it’s worth mentioning, too, how good these backgrounds are at communicating different regions: the scenic beach near the luxury cabin, the quiet village that’s contrasted by its tight knit sense of community, both contrasted against the usual setting of the city. And while I’ve seen in other reviews that people find the innuendos in the background jokes to be tacky or in poor taste, I actually found that not only were a lot of them funny, but I think it creates a tangible sense of a world populated by Anthro animals more than other media tends to. I think sex is a pretty natural human experience, and a lot of real life marketing sells sex very transparently, and lots of mainstream Anthro animation doesn’t address that. It’s outside the ratings for films like Zootopia and Sing, and sexuality is so central a focus of a story like Beastars that normalizing it would kind of destroy its themes. And I think that perhaps Hayop-Ka’s depiction of sexuality in this world is one of its greatest strengths. Which, I guess, is interesting, because it seems like part of the negative backlash to Hayop-Ka is the accusation that is perverse or obscene for its sexual nature. Which seems… weird to me. The sex isn’t explicit in it, and Nimpha is only pictured having sex in the film once. The films setting is steeped in sexuality: sexuality is marketed on every sign on every street, and Nimpha’s motivation is mostly based around sex,But it doesn’t feel that weird I guess? It’s a story about an adult woman making adult choices, and the use of sexuality is only out of place because it’s animation - but there’s a lot of animated stories that are a lot more sexual than this. And like I said, I think the sexuality makes the plot kind of interesting. By the third act, the novelty of animal-sex-world kinda dies off, and the film isn’t really about that, as it becomes a series of Nimpha making increasingly more destructive decisions with basically everyone involved in her life. But by that point in the film, I had already been hooked in, and I was interested in what would happen to Nimpha. The positive sexual expression was a great hook for the first act, and moving into the second and third, I cared enough about the established characters enough to weigh the morality of their decisions in my head. Nimpha does something objectively bad to Roger, but it is understandable that she wants to better herself, and Roger’s tendency towards violence make him seem like a less dependable partner. But Inigo’s a literal villain, and if him talking about partnering with Elon musk didn’t telegraph that enough, he is a character who openly talks about working with the Filipino president to keep wages down. When Nimpha confronts her family in the third act, she’s objectively wrong, but I can’t really be mad at her, because it’s a realistic emotional outburst. I’ve watched a lot of stories about bad people who misuse sexuality in their lives. And I’ll never claim that Hayop-Ka - an animated parody of soap operas meant to poke fun at infidelity - is even half as weighty as Tár or Bojack Horseman - heavy commentary about how celebrity is used to leverage power. But, I do file this movie in a similar place in my head. Watching a not great person try to be better and trying to figure out why things are so messy. And frankly!!! I actually adore the ending for that. Because Nimfa does fuck up, she does do bad things, but people in her life do bad things back to her. And in the end the best thing Nimfa can do is just… walk away. Start a new life. And she does and I think that’s beautiful. I do think it’s worth mentioning the sexist overtones in the climax of the movie - when Nimfa calls the radio station. A reference to an unfortunately very real trend of men berating women for doing anything other than serving whatever man is already present in her life. I feel like part of the negative reception of Hayop Ka is that people read this as him being right but like… no?? He’s just not? Maybe it’s my prior knowledge making me biased against a man in a recording booth telling a woman how to live her life, but in that moment I think it’s Nimfa’s last attempt to rely on men, and her faith in it is shattered when she talks to Inigo again. Because yeah - don’t know if you notice - she can’t even try to follow that bull’s advice, because she never gets a chance to come clean to Inigo if she wanted to. And I think that Nimfa marching for maternity leave and raising her child on her own with her family shows that Nimfa’s life isn’t going to revolve around the approval of men anymore. It’s possible that’s cope: that this is a sexist message I’m jumping through hoops to spin in a way that empowers the protagonist in the end. But I dunno, I kinda constructed that reading without thinking about it. I don’t think it’s that much of a stretch.I’m going to be coming back to Hayop-Ka at some point, for sure. It’s filed in my brain alongside a lot of my favorite depictions of every day life in an animal world. It’s a little melodramatic, but I do think that the depiction of Nimfa, and how her story ends, does tell a good, grounded story. I think I, a bunny, am always going to be happy with a film that I start and whose title very loudly says to me,“You’re an animal”",160.0,ltbx

I found it to be a bit too melodramatic for my taste, and while I suppose you can say it is because of it being a satire on the way the tropes in Filipino media act, but even then I feel like it missed the ball sometimes. Sometimes it does good, I like the end credits of our main character learning to not be as much of a piece of shit, but something about it urks me, you know? Another person had mentioned how sort of misogynistic this movie is, and how while sometimes it does good in relation to satirizing the concepts shown, sometimes it just uh...doesn't I guess? It sort of goes well, we were satirizing this but now we mean it genuinely I suppose. This isn't me being against characters who are shitty people like the way it is in this movie, I love bad people doing awful things to each other, maybe its the cheating aspect or the over exaggeration but it comes off as more of a smear against women who want more in life. I can't blame our main character to want to be living comfortably, she works a dead end job and wants to be happy, I'm not defending her, by any stretch of the imagination, fuck her, but I feel this aura of sinister intentions. As a whole this movie is beautiful when it comes to animation, but the story is overly dramatic to the point of it being more stupid than anything else, and while the fact it is a satire saves it sometimes, other times it really isn't satirical and just dumb. Go watch it though just for the animation and some of the jokes. Maybe just once if you can't stand stupidity in your movies, but it is worth the watch.",100.0,ltbx

ngboo,,"Ralph Bakshi’s cult feature debut ‘Fritz the Cat’ gets a sort of a spiritual successor in romantic satire ‘You Animal!’ – a tongue-in-cheek parody of Pinoy telenovelas in which characters reportedly scream the titular phrase at each other in the heat of an argument. Deliciously saucy and irreverently melodramatic, it revolves around a love triangle between a saleslady or rather, salescat, Nimfa, her macho mongrel boyfriend, Roger, who works as a janitor, and a purebred (husky?) playboy industrialist, Iñigo Villanueva, with whom she fulfills her fantasy of climbing up the social ladder. (Did I mention that the story is actually prophesized by an octopus fortune teller?)The colorfully mesmerizing artwork may look cute, with all protagonists being talking animals, but this is by no means a kids cartoon, given its rampant sex jokes and lines such as “my bun is quite content with your hot dog”, not to mention a highly stylized (read: deliberately kitschy) intercourse scene. However, it is not to be taken too seriously either, which Liongoren and his team of artists constantly emphasize through visual gags such as witty inscriptions hanging all around ‘Zootopia-fied’ Manila, some literal catfight or a rage-fueled scene inspired by the ‘Street Fighter’ car-crashing bonus game. The social commentary is there, but it is the animators’ wild and free imagination that comes first, reflected in a wonderful world building, and full control of the medium.",140.0,ltbx
