hanablue,2018-08-30,"KathNiel's G.O.A.T movie!: I don't usually go watch local films, but KathNiel just have that thing that makes me not want to miss it every single time (I always watch on it's first day too.) lol

So here's my non-biased review. I will try to be as objective as possible. For someone who appreciate movies a whole lot, it is such a hard thing to please me and my siblings when it comes to movies. I was a bit hesitant before watching the movie, rom-com-drama movies are not really my type.

This movie, went beyond my expectations. The cinematography wasn't as great compared to their Crazy Beautiful You movie, but nonetheless, it really went beyond expectations. I never expected it to be as creative and dynamic because of the simple setting and story line, but it was unbelievably quite on par with CBY. Kudos to the team for that!

Story wise, it was that kind of movie which is really simple and not as complicated as others but it really brought out the feels. I specifically loved the beginning part the most! It's not common for Filipino movies to start that way but it did! Not gonna spoil the scenes though. Gonna leave it all to you to find out how beautifully catching it was. Another thing to note, was the transition to each and every scene, the voice overs and the story flow. It's meticulously put together that you'll be hooked the whole time you're watching the movie. The dynamics was there too, will sound cliche but it was a roller coaster of feelings. When you think you're through all the heavy scenes, and can feel the whole cinema audience sharing that light feeling, they'll hit you with the feels again.

To the couple, Kathryn and Daniel, they were really the one who brought the movie to life. Unlike, Barcelona: A Love Untold, we saw how great of a supporting actor Joshua is and for me, he was one of the actors who brought the movie to life. In here, it was all them. Not discrediting other actors, they all did a good job. Darren is a revelation, the kid is a multi-talented person. We can't really say anything about Miss Jean Garcia cause she really is a legend. Other cast's acting were quite bland but it was still a good one. Joross and another actor's cameo was also on point. For those who never had a relationship like me, Juan Miguel Severo and Ria Atayde was the most relatable one. They really showed what friends do, it was real, really genuine. Back to KathNiel, I really feel like this is their best movie yet. Kathryn was on her zone, she really owned this one. She literally shone her, she really showed her vulnerability and it's super far from when she was starting and her teen movies. We really saw Kathryn, not Kathryn with Daniel but Kathryn. Kathryn herself. Daniel is a natural, we all know that. I can't even explain how great of an actor he is, whenever he accepts a character, you won't see a trace of the Daniel Padilla in real life but he really gets into the character and owns it. He was the best Primo just as Kathryn was the best George. They really owned this one.

Direk Cathy showed us again why she is a blockbuster director. She is a legend. Maybe not indie wise, cause that's not her forte. But we can always trust Direk Cathy to bring out all the emotions, may it be tears of both joy and pain, all the laughs and all the frustrations.

Rated it 8 because there will always be room for improvement for all the actors and the movie itself, but overall it is a really great one. A must-watch!",80.0,imdb

neutralguy,2018-09-09,"8/10: For a Filipino Film I'll give it a score of 9/10 It is one of the best RomComs in the Philippines ever!

But if you stack it against Hollywood movies. a score of 7/10 would suffice.

Acting Lead Actors: 10/10, they portrayed it masterfully. Supporting Cast: 6/10, could have casted a better ""Yohan"", they gave him a lot of screentime and his portrayal is lacking. The cousin and friends of Primo needs more workshops. George's friends were the bright spots.

Story/Dialogue The plot is simple and direct to the point. It somewhat dragged when they went to Amsterdam. Dialogue was good 7/10

Direction/Cinematography CGM is one of the best when it comes to RomComs here in the Philippines. 9/10

As of Sept 7 it has 404M php gross, and its only been up for 10 days.

engrjboy,2019-05-19,"Not supposed to be 1 STAR, but........: Ok ladies and gentlemen, I might get hate comments on this but this is my review on this movie.

First, the only reason I had the urge to create an account on IMDB is because of the overrated reviews this movie has gotten. On top of that, this film became the BOX OFFICE FILM of the Philippines of all time! (So, arousing my curiosity, I took the time to watch).

The material of this film was alright. Nothing extra special to be honest. The usual romcom pinoy film. In my opinion (no hate to Kathniel), it could've been better if someone better portrayed their characters.

Seriously, who would live in the same house and put a division using a tape? Like, cmon, seriously?

There were okay moments, but seriously Filipinos who went gaga on this movie need to re-evaluate yourselves. I'm not even hard to please.

I would rate this film a 4/10 or 5. I gave it 1 STAR to lower down its overrated reviews from other people like giving it 10?? and their best movie of all time? Jeez.",10.0,imdb
rosariodelrosario,2018-09-02,Best movie ever!!!: 10 is not enough to rate this movie it should be ughh 101. This is the best movie of 2018 literally! Will give u a lot of realizations.

moystorre,2018-09-29,"Good movie but not too commercialized: Neither I am a Kathniel fan nor hater, this is just an honest review (for me).

Before I watched the movie, I made sure that I've had checked social media on everyone's take on this film. Honestly, I was convinced to watch it. As I enter the movie house, my eyes were on point to each scene. During the first part, I totally enjoyed it. Everything was so realistic and on-point. But as the movie runs, it made me bored already. The scenes were all over already. I must say, Can't help falling in love was their ""most matured film.""

Did I leave the movie house feeling heavy-hearted? No Did I leave the movie house happy? Yes, but just to give my thoughts about it. Will I watch it again? Maybe if I want to see what part I may have missed. Was it worth the money? 280 pesos is not bad but I left the movie house thinking I should have watched other local movies that will really make my feelings satisfied.

Let's just be honest here, do you think this was their best movie so far? I don't think so. To be honest, I think I was just convinced by lots of fans commenting that this was their movie ever.

I felt like her struggle during the relationship wasn't acknowledged enough when he came back. Then the scene where we're told of what his life was after he left her felt lacking. Sure, he experienced real life, but that doesn't change how much of an a-hole he was to her. I still thought that's not enough for a reconcilliation at this point.

sbuan,2018-08-31,"REAL, HONEST REVIEW FOR #TheHowsOfUs. ""IN THEIR MOST FINEST PERFORMANCE/MOVIE OF ALL"": Watched it exactly on it's showing date in cinemas (August 29, 2018) and I can say that the audience really missed KathNiel on big screen/cinemas! Sold-out screenings, long lines, etc.

Review for the movie: This is going to be the last tandem movie of KathNiel together with Filipino's Blockbuster Director, Cathy Garcia-Molina. And they really did impress us viewers with their last movie together! The movie is a little bit cliche as you can say but atleast, it has something new to offer for the viewers. Direk Cathy indeed put up her best for the movie turned out to be beautifully scripted, it is by far expectation acting coming from all of the cast especially Kathryn Bernardo (this is her most amazing character/acting as she portrays ""George""). KathNiel didn't failed us on each of their movie. Perhaps, they both keep on leveling up in their craft of acting or as a love team or maybe a partners in real life (hehe).

Kidding aside, the actors were great, ang galing ni Kathryn and Daniel! My God, best actress ang acting ni Kathryn dito and yung ibang cast nagbeblend in sa kanila. I love Miko!

philbertdy,,"There used to be a time when the powers-at-be were trying to convince people that Daniel Padilla was cool, casting him as the broody teenage bad-boy that had to be won over by the steely determination of his good-girl paramour Kathryn Bernardo. But he's not cool, at least in that way. He's got a big goofy smile, a friendly presence, and an earnestness that gives his characters surprising vulnerability. His growth as an actor largely involves him being comfortable up on screen, being some version of himself that's closer to who he really is.And this leads to the best bits of this movie, which almost seem to happen in a vacuum of narrative. It doesn't matter what came before or what might happen after. In the moment, it just looks like these two kids are enjoying themselves. Kathryn Bernardo hasn't quite kept up with Padilla's development, her performances getting a little stiffer as she gets older, but their clear affection for one another smooths out a lot of these scenes.But these moments don't actually exist in a vacuum. There's a movie around it, and like so many local big romcoms, there are just too many things going on. All the classic formula markers are there, too: some sort of medical problem, some parental issues and a whole bunch of characters that exist purely to tell the leads what they're supposed to be feeling. The movie stretches into two hours with the added weight of these rote elements, and by the time they fly off to some foreign land, it kind of feels like an entirely different movie. It shifts focus completely, and starts filling in even more backstory through yet another character that just says everything outright.The story they end up telling is actually pretty simple, but there are just so many other things that crowd out the much more affecting core of this story: two people still clearly in love with each other, just trying to overcome the hurt that also still exists between them.

Here’s a mind dump (with little spoilers) rendered in the same fashion as the film’s break-build narrative, starting off with negatives (baka awayin ako ng fans, lol), wrapping up with positives. 1. The opening voiceovers are certainly moving but seem lengthier than necessary. I hate that I feel like I’m being spoon-fed.2. Daniel’s character is rather poorly developed. And the choice to reveal his backstory through another character’s verbose lines is quite a disappointment. 3. I am totally confused about (what I think is) the turning point where Primo has to leave because that’s obviously what he is asked to, then is instantly being chased by George afterwards. There is no question about Kathryn’s acting, but seriously I’m like, “Girl, why are you crying? Pinaalis mo ‘di ba?” And when he returns, she says something like “That’s not what I actually meant because I was just tired, and that I wanted you to fight for us that night.” Ang labo. 4. The prepossessing bike scene gets less delightful when Primo starts throwing gibberish pick-up lines. Ganda na sana eh. Rickety in part but there’s so much that makes it worthy as a whole:5. Editing does not look as though it’s rushed. ‘Buti naman. 6. A dialogue-heavy scene backdropped by Amsterdam’s glaring flower fields and lovely sunset is my favorite. How would you feel if you’re in a beautiful place, talking to someone you love about how your lives got better after you painfully parted ways? Tearful acceptance, ganun. Ako, hindi ko alam. Unfathomable. 7. Second favorite is the harana/apology scene. Pain and kilig stirred together. 8. It may not be picture-perfect, but it’s a warehouse of authentic messages, inspirational ideologies, and lessons in love, which I gladly take away:- Relationships take great, great effort to maintain. It’s easy to give love and be happy when things are going well. But what happens when life suddenly feels as though it’s caving in with a spirit-crushing weight? Ang tanong eh kung kaya mo pa. Pero kung siya ayaw na, tama na. Ginawa ko na ‘yan. Okay naman ako. Pero ako lang ‘yun. - I give a nod everytime Primo says “Sayang iniwan kita, nagkahiwalay tayo,” and George will answer “but we became better persons.” Eh kasi tama naman. We don’t grow when things are easy, comfortable, and effortless. We grow when we face something beyond what we’re capable of handling. Kahit magkahiwalay pa kayo. Again, ako lang ‘to. - For the most beautiful part: Just because we think our heart is broken doesn’t mean it’s incapable to love again. (Sa’kin talaga galing to? Hahaha!) It’s those times when we have to step aside, heal in whatever foolish way we can, and remind ourselves of what keeps us going. It’s when we think na wala nang dahilan magmahal ulit kasi masasaktan ka lang ulit, that instead of curling up and hiding from the world, we gather our scattered bits of resolve to keep moving forward, whether with someone from the past, with someone new, or with yourself alone. Friend, life is worth every single moment. Be open to lessons from your hardships and misfortunes — they will build within you an unshakable passion, acceptance, understanding, and LOVE. THOU redefines my idea of living life, makes me want to fall in love again.",140.0,ltbx

In this movie however, Director Cathy Garcia-Molina flipped the script and made Kathryn shine more out of the duo. Don't get me wrong, Daniel is still a great screen presence but he was encumbered by what is, in my opinion, a deeply unlikable character while Kathryn got to play a long suffering and determined young lady and really got her chance to shine here.

cameronwjohnson,,"I don't know if I have nearly as many questions about how this couple happened than I do about the one in ""She's Dating a Gangster"". This onscreen romance between Kathryn Benardo and Daniel Padilla can only be healthier than their last one under Cathy Garcia-Molina, but we're still talking about an aspiring musician and a medical student moving in together after she inherits her great aunt's hows-I mean house. I don't know how mature the film itself is with that wordplay in the title, so of course it's not too long before the med student gets tired of supporting the bum. Years later, ""he just happens"" to return declaring that he is a ""changed man"", but at least sticks around when he discovers that his ex-girlfriend blew up her medical career to whine about breaking up with her boyfriend. As if that's not unhealthy enough, after they ruined their first relationship with too much pressure, they have to start a new one by selling the house and finding the female lead's estranged father before her brother goes blind from diabetes. Along the way, they figuratively return to the debate club where they literally met to assess the ""hows"" that will save these lovers, even though the only one that counts is that they're played by Kathryn Benardo and Daniel Padilla. Filipino cinema's hottest power couple are sure to draw a crowd to what bickering they can manage, but the film still has to pander to them to oblivion.The masses might be a bit thrown off by the film's wildly convoluted nonlinear storytelling, and even then, it's mostly hard to keep up with the rapid-fire progression of the characters' arc settling into the house and adapting to their draggier reunion some years later. Something as overdramatic as a flashback structure mostly just shows how contrived this thing is, as a simplistic melodrama that forces conflict in the flashback storyline to spice up an initially ""happy"" home and facilitate its downfall, and blows the reunion arc on either randomly searching for an estranged father or a grown-ass doctor screaming about the ""tragedy"" of getting dumped. This film deals with some pretty sophisticated themes on how individuals are complexly shaped by their relationship, and although fairly likable character undergo a lot of change, it's all undone by those ""I can't live with you"" confrontations and ""I can't live without you"" declarations. It's never a particularly well-written romp, of course, the comedy being almost singularly embarrassingly juvenile screwball banter with friends or cutesy shenanigans with the couple, whose romantic interplays are devalued by sexual tension and saccharine dramatic progression. For the film to talk about moving into an adult relationship, this is in no way an adult movie, with Cathy Garcia-Molina being just one of many writers on a flimsy committee, and giving up on carrying this above that as directress. As full-hearted as her frantic overstylization, over-scoring, overpacing and overall overhandedness are, it's yet more grating pandering that wears down a superficial romantic dramedy. It's just a fluff piece, and it's sure to please the crowd, sometimes with actually tasteful elements.The wooded suburban house is a key character, and a comely one at that, with a beauty and humility beaming with some of the truest romance in the atmosphere of a film all about the hassle of a couple settling down. This sentimental tone is carried over by Jessie Lasaten's sweetly bright score and Noel Teehankee's dreamily polished cinematography, but without the maturity naturally inherent in that home. Cathy Garcia-Molina's direction just keeps going too far with the romantic disposition, but no matter how cloying this gets, there's always such honesty in such fiery emotion. As melodramatic as the film gets, there are times when Garcia-Molina is simply owning up to that with her dreamy sentiments, trusting that the cheese will be grounded by the admittedly fairly solid character factor. It's a romantic drama about growing up that is in no way grow-up, until there comes a point in both the flashback and present-day segments when the characters really start to break through, losing a grip of their prospects under the pressure of making a home, then reuniting some time later to further contemplate how they function as a unit. Juxtaposing these two processes deepen fairly sharp themes on understanding the differences between healthy dependency and toxic codependency; sacrificing your own prospects and supporting someone else's; and succumbing to the burden of a serious relationship and giving it time to breathe. I can tell you one thing: it's getting hard to see Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla functioning without each other, their radiant chemistry continuing to flourish alongside their bubbly charms and often surprisingly piercing emotional forces, as they try to hold together a film that is having a harder time managing fluff with true maturity.The nonlinear narrative is just part of the incessant contrivances that devalue a would-be mature love story, but not like the grating humor, histrionics and overstylization that render this strict pandering, with enough charm in its craft and punch-up, if not enough depth in its character developments and the leads' chemistry, to save Cathy Garcia-Molina's ""The Hows of Us"" a likably farcical romantic drama that warms your heart in some places and leave it cold in others.2.5/5 - Adequate",100.0,ltbx

ichahrnssa,,"Bingung sebenarnya mau nulis review film ini gimana. Bukan karena filmnya jelek, tapi karena filmnya RELATABLE SEKALI, KAKAK. Aku bingung karena aku pasti kecurcol soal mantan. Aku gatel pengen cerita soal kehidupan percintaanku, sesuatu yang rasanya bisa menjijikkan buat dibaca orang lain. Bisa bikin orang lain memaki, “MANA BAHASAN SOAL FILMNYA, ANJIIIIIIR. MALAH CURHAT SI BANGKEEEEEE.” But… fuck it. Aku tulis aja deh. Aku nggak tau mau nulis apa juga. Selain film ini bagus kecuali adegan pas setting-nya berpindah di Amsterdam di mana pas bagian itu terasa membosankan. Bagi yang males dan mual kalau baca curhatan, bisa berhenti sampai di sini.-------------------------BATAS SUCI-----------------------------Tuh, aku bikinin batas sucinya ehehe.Aku ngerasa kenapa nonton ini pas banget dengan momen si mantan ngajak balikan. FYI, aku dan si mantan putus beberapa waktu lalu. Aku diputusin, lebih tepatnya. Ehehe.Film ini seolah bikin aku optimis mau dan bisa balikan sama mantan. Karena filmnya tentang pasangan yang putus terus balikan lagi. Tentang cowoknya yang buat salah terus cowoknya minta maaf, menyadari kalau ternyata dia yang salah dan berusaha berubah. The Hows of Us adalah mimpi basah bagi orang-orang kayak aku. Yang dalam lubuk hatinya pengen balikan tapi takut bakal hancur lagi. Yang ngerasa bingung kalau pake otak, jadinya rasional. Kalau pake hati, bisa senang tapi irasional. Kalau ngikutin otak, wajar banget rasanya kalau nggak balikan. Memang harusnya nggak balikan. Kalau ngikutin hati, rasanya pengen balikaaaaan aja. Memaafkan dengan mudah apa yang telah dilakukan mantan.Aku nggak bilang kalau sepenuhnya mantan yang salah. Aku juga salah. Aku nggak bisa memenuhi ekspektasinya. Aku nggak sesempurna yang dia mau. Aku udah berusaha berubah jadi apa yang dia mau, tapi aku nggak bisa. Rintangan yang dihadapi menuju ke 'arah sana' juga bukan dianggap cobaan, tapi halangan. Aku nggak berhasil meyakinkan dia buat terus berusaha demi aku. Demi kami.Aku paling ingat kata-katanya temannya George (Kathryn Bernardo), salah satu tokoh utama di film ini. “George, I know that story all too well. First, you start to listen. Then you believe what he says. Then you agree what he wants. Then you’re fooled again, you’re naive another time! Listen to me, do not repeat the same mistake!”George adalah perempuan cerdas yang bisa jadi contoh dari kalimat, “Kalau soal cinta, semua orang bisa jadi goblok.” Temannya George udah kayak Kak Ira, kakak sepupuku, pas nasehatin aku jangan sampai balikan sama mantan.Hiks. Ditambah lagi, George dan Primo (Daniel Padilla), sepasang kekasih yang udah jadi mantan, waktu pacaran punya panggilan sayang. Yaitu Jo.JO ANJEEEEER.KENAPA HARUS JO. ANJEEEEEEEEEEEER.FILM KURANG UAJAAAAAAAR. Ya gimana, aku manggil si mantan waktu masih pacaran dengan nama Jojo. Tapi aku sering panggil dia, “Jo,’ dan nama kontaknya di hapeku itu aku tulisin nama Jo. HUAAAAAAA KENAPA BISA KEBETULAN SIIIIH. Film ini brengsek. Patut aku bilang brengsek karena bikin aku optimis aja buat balikan sama si mantan. Bikin mikir kalau aku juga bisa kayak George yang akhirnya balikan sama Primo. Aku nggak bisa bohong dengan bilang aku nggak sayang sama mantan. Aku masih. Nggak berubah. Nggak tau sampai kapan. Aku pengen rasa ini berubah, minimal berkurang sedikit. Tapi malah…. aaaarrrrrrrgh. Cuman kalau balikan lagi, pasti kami berantem lagi. Nyakitin lagi masing-masing.Hahahaha. Hahaha. Haha. Ha.Ih ngeselin ya kalau jadi orang baperan.

Seakan mau pamer aja syut di Amsterdam, setelah sebelumnya di Barcelona di film Barcelona A Love Untold. Tapi bukan berarti buruk. Walau klise, cerita dibuat se-believeable mungkin. Sebab akibatnya. Konsekuensinya. Tentang si perempuan yang muak dengan idealisme cowoknya. Masa si Daniel (eh aku lupa di sini nama peran dia siapa? sudah nonton sebulan lalu) nggak mau nyanyi bahasa Inggris di kafe hanya karena idealisme. Hehehehe. Mending situ nyanyi di kamar mandi, kan beda musisi pro dan musisi kamar. Maksudnya keidealismean dia terlalu banyak dan kurang menohok aja. Bahkan sampai ditinggalkan temen ngebandnya. Mungkin mereka disuruh ganti genre dangdut kali ya sama produser rekamannya sampai Daniel nolak ambil proyek rekaman.Si Kathryn gagal jadi dokter, karena mengurus suami kumpul kebonya. Mereka belum kawin sih. Tapi bebas, kan Filipina. Di sini juga ada wkwkw. Aku suka aja kegerahan Kathryn dengan toxic relationships antara mereka berdua. Kalau cinta itu butuh duit, bukan cuma kepercayaan. Sayang aja mesti happy ending dan mereka balikan lagi. Kalau gue mah ogah, emansipasi ciiinn. Women empowerment  Sebenarnya kalau kita sering nonton film dan sinetron mereka berdua, mirip lah kayak couple Michelle Zuidith dan Rizky Nassar atau Dimas Anggara. Sutradaranya juga sama aja.

The Amsterdam sequence—you don't even go here Just when I thought this film strayed away from formulaic, comfortable rom-com that never fails to have: a hugot festival, kids with parental issues, and the need to go to special places to release repressed feelings, instead it stayed loyal to it. The beginning was so promising, may pa-slow motion pa, but it wasn't consistent. Also, I'm curious as to how and why they make the audio in these types of films. There's something about how voices are amplified too much or smoothened out. Sometimes, it looks like it was dubbed which I find disturbing.

I just don't get the point of already starting with the post-breakup, and then showing the redeeming value of Primo was with him all along, even before the breakup, as if pointing out that it was all a misunderstanding. This subtly puts the blame on George for not knowing that Primo was actually a good man (she should have just trusted him!).This should have been a film about HOW Primo acknowledges his accountability and redeems himself, and HOW George finally finds in herself the courage to forgive and love again. That would have been less formulaic, less harmful, and most probably very endearing.Also, what's with the exaggerated acting? Almost all of them are good to great actors (except of course for Espanto), and yet most of them were also over the top. I think, because they have proven in their other projects that they can act, that it's a directorial problem.

cesandpooh,,"This is the first Kathniel project i ever truly liked — loved even! In typical Star Cinema fashion, the movie starts with a chaotic scene depicting hyperactive leads that, somehow, lose that hyperactivity through the rest of the film.In another typical Star Cinema fashion, insert the need to shoot in a foreign country. I have to be honest, though — those Amsterdam scenes could have also panned out effectively if shot in some remote province in the Philippines. But, yeah, I know Amsterdam doesn’t require permits for filming there, so I guess Star Cinema took the opportunity to film and have a European vacation at the same time. Typical Filipino showbusiness tactic. Splitting the house in two - seen that many times, mostly in comedies. It did the job for this movie, though. It worked as a story device that did not feel forced.Anyway, Kathryn and Daniel have both really matured in this movie. Especially Kathryn — in all her previous movies where she was supposed to play an adult, she didn’t quite do so well. I mean, acting-wise, she did. But in terms of looks, she always looked like some teenager and, sometimes, even a child. So I commend the styling team for doing a good job with her look for “The How’s of Us”. Her screen presence matured. As for Daniel, boy, has he grown into a man. I especially love him in this role. I love it when men are depicted as soft, vulnerable, and pitiful — in the context of a love story, of course.And this — I cried. Yup. I tried to hold back the tears, but I just couldn’t. This is the true hallmark of good storytelling — when you fight your emotion, but it gets the better of you.",200.0,ltbx

regulustars,,"don’t get me wrong, kathryn and daniel did well on this film, especially the former who seemingly carried the film on her back (as most critics seem to be saying— and i agree) but, as there always is an apprehensive but, the storyline was, objectively and personally, not to my taste. not only did it remind me and my mother (who cried very hard might i add) of my parents’ abusive relationship, it was just . . . hard to force myself to like primo. i saw too much of my father in him, a man i hate and have no pity for. they were too alike— in their actions, words, beings, so how could i forgive one and crucify the other?i think this brings us back to how good of an actor daniel was in this film. i don’t think it was his best performance, but it definitely wasn’t his worst. he portrayed primo very well, showcasing the complexities of his being making one question whether or not he really deserves to be forgiven. (i personally would not have forgiven him, i have to say. the relationship that primo and george had was too toxic, and it hit a little too close to home than my liking)there are many things i would still like to say about this film, perhaps i’ll expound more on this when the morning comes. just know that this was a good watch, not the best, not the worst, but good.",120.0,ltbx
aintdrei,,"""George, I'm sorry.""""And what makes that sorry different from all your other sorrys before?""I've always been a devoted admirer of Kathniel, eagerly anticipating each of their upcoming movies. They stand out as my preferred Filipino loveteam, especially since I used to follow Social Seryes on Twitter inspired by their story. My admiration for Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo deepened after watching this particular film in theaters.While the movie's plot follows the typical, cliché, and foreseeable pattern of Filipino romance films, I found it delightful because of the remarkable chemistry between the two leads. Somehow, they infused it with a special and heartfelt quality. Kathryn Bernardo's acting deserves special recognition; her exceptional performance left a lasting impact, even stirring my emotions at 3:00 AM.Forgiveness, a challenging virtue, becomes particularly daunting when faced with someone who has caused you pain and shattered your self-esteem. The decision to forgive or harbor perpetual resentment carries immense pressure, complicated further by the fear of disappointing those opposed to your chosen path.I won't deny that Primo was quite the jerk in the past, blinded by his dreams to the harsh realities around him. Despite acknowledging George's struggles in a letter, he failed to take meaningful action. His reckless behavior, fueled by alcohol, exacerbated their financial woes. Fortunately, George displayed remarkable understanding and selflessness. It's heartening that Primo eventually transformed into a better person, learning from his mistakes and genuinely committed to fixing everything.In contrast, I resonate more with George's approach. I refuse to let the same person inflict harm on me once again.",100.0,ltbx

I saw him grow as an actor from the same bad boy teenager roles since Growing Up, and his comfortability on screen makes him better.What I do not like about the film is the same medical-related subplot, the parental issues, friends/family conflicts. Same Cathy Garcia-Molina formula. Same Filipino romcom formula. What made this film better though is how warm and pleasant Kathryn and Daniel act together. Their chemistry made this film work. I would have loved this more if the film focuses on Primo and George's story. More scenes during their stay on Tita Lola's house, what happened after Primo left, and after Primo came back. It's like the Barcelona: A Love Untold. Too many sub-stories that could have been deleted.Overall, I love it. THIS IS DANIEL PADILLA'S MOVIE.",140.0,ltbx

reeladvicenet,,"At two hours long, ""The Hows of Us"" was limited severely by so much bloat and so many tropes that it really made us wonder why they just didn't tell a straightforward story in the first place. But don't get us wrong though, it wasn't a bad experience at all and we actually found ourselves liking this film much more than we anticipated. But its barely middling middle section should have been reworked maybe even removed.For years, Jo (Kathryn Bernardo) and Primo (Daniel Padilla) had a long-lasting relationship so much so that when Jo’s Aunt died, she left her house to the both of them. But with Primo, a budding musician, failing to attain the success that he feels he is beholden to and with Jo feeling that Primo’s failures are holding her back, Primo abandons Jo all by herself. A few years pass by when Primo suddenly shows up and wants to fix the wrongs he has done in the past - including his relationship with Jo. But this isn’t as simple as it sounds as Jo plans to sell their house soon and hasn’t really forgiven and forgotten that Primo left her to fend for herself. We must admit that “The Hows of Us” left us with a heavy dose of mixed feelings. On one hand, its narrative and story really had potential to be substantially and emotionally moving. But the film also suffers because it felt it needed to do genre tropes within its story that was just unnecessary. For example, there’s a parent or sibling who suffers a sickness in the most opportune time or simply travelling to a foreign country. We wished it just told a more straightforward and down-to-earth story - one that we could actually imagine happening in real-life and not one obviously written for the big screen. While the overall narrative was bloated, the film actually had bright spots. In fact, the first thirty minutes and last thirty minutes were outstanding in our opinion. It had us gripping our seats with emotionally moving moments. Of course, these scenes were bolstered by the great chemistry and acting between Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla. Overall though, “The Hows of Us” will make you swoon in key moments and if that’s what you’re after, you’ll actually find it a story worth experiencing.

However, you could really feel her exerting in moments where she should come off as steely or sexy. I think Daniel is the better actor between the two, but his character is just irredeemably awful. They are both really capable actors but it almost feels like they're being forced to recite these awful and cheesy lines.I hate when movies try to make toxic relationships cutesy.

dibidi,,"this is peak Pinoy romcom cinema. it has everything you’d expect; flashbacks and flashforwards, a junket trip to Europe, 2 charismatic leads, etc. what separates this from the fluff is its execution, the story (up until the end) is well crafted and avoids the natural pitfalls of the premise it set up for itself. the protagonists have agency and do not make any decision just for plot contrivance. not to say this is a perfect movie, it has its problems— the editing and pacing is not quite there. it spends way too much time meandering through Amsterdam, and crafting a Pixar Up-like sequence in the beginning was not necessary if they were only going to spend a lot of running time going through the past all over again, so there is no economy of storytelling present. my biggest problem though is the ending. i understand why they did it the way they did, but imo it was completely unnecessary and actually harms the characters’ growth during the movie. SPOILER what the ending does is retcon the movie’s story; we find out in the end that Primo actually knew he was being a selfish prick before he left, but instead of actually doing something about it, he instead, what, wrote a letter? that makes it okay? that actually makes it worse, because now we know he had a CHOICE to be better 2 years ago, but he chose not to. his 2 years of change therefore did not matter because it implies he in fact didn’t change, at all. then they have George APOLOGIZING to him? as if anything was her fault? that is wrong on so many levels. this development looks unfortunately to have been put there only to create a reason for George to get back together with Primo in time for the movie to end, but this was completely unnecessary. Primo has grown as a person, he’s already shown this to George, and George already acknowledges that he has. there was no need for the letter. instead, what they should have done was, after all the items have been sold off, have both of them say farewell to their past selves, the people that owned that house, and reintroduce each other as new people. have the movie end with George agreeing to go on a first date with Primo, a chance that this time around, things will work out.",140.0,ltbx

It did touch that issue in the first act but it was so rushed and I just didn’t feel any sympathy or connection with the characters.

cinephyte,,"hindi ko alam if i’m just getting back into pinoy movies or my star cinema melodrama bias is acting up but i really liked this movie. kathryn is such a good actor and i’m realizing that more than ever. daniel is decent at most but it does feel natural to see him with kathryn— and that plays a huge part on how we see him on screen. most actors are great aside from darren. palagi naman may ini-introduce na “young talent” ang star cinema in all of their movies na hindi talaga marunong umarte so i guess masasanay ka na din. yun lang, ang pangit at awkward talaga. isa pang pansin ko: color grading sa amsterdam scenes sobrang processed! you’re already in amsterdam, might as well follow its natural vibe instead of presenting it as a much brighter, summery place compared to the philippines (where it’s always bright and summery). plot-wise, decent pero overused as usual. sa script lang lagi nagkakatalo ang mga star cinema melodramatic romance blockbusters and this was average. kathryn lang talaga nagdala. and she did a damn good job! parang character niya sa movie, dalang-dala niya si daniel. good for her! go girl! ayun, overall ay bigyan natin siya ng 3.5 stars. it’s definitely good enough to be called generally well-made. at napaiyak niya ako so laking factor din yun for this very serious and very lengthy review in the very revered letterbox.",140.0,ltbx

It started off too serious and heavy, then shifted to a corny rom-com approach and a third act that's unnecessary (ma-justify lang ng prod team pag-abroad nila under Star Cinema's expense). Daniel Padilla's acting is generic and was overshadowed by Kathryn's more upfront character. Still, they do kilig scenes the best.

denlebantino,,"The film's premise surely captures the kind of sentimentality that is born out of selfless devotion. George (Kathryn Bernardo) represents every doting lover who understands that love is both a struggle and sacrifice. But she's human enough to reach her breaking point, that non-singular moment Primo (Daniel Padilla), her lover, erodes into a miserable man. That's outright promising, given an opportunity to go deep into the characters' core. Until the narrative submits to Star Cinema formula. While Primo tries to win George back, a lot of other things happen, all brazenly pointing to them realizing they need to be back together, even if he decides to set her free--a banal device that aims to make love look elusive but more intense. Because how are these two characters supposed to respond to other charcters whose sole duty is to remind them that they still love each other? The sequences in Amsterdam feel like you're watching a different film, with characters so eager to accomplish something for a great cause. The attempt at proving its significance by way of editorializing the flowers and the sunset does not put weight on either the characters or the narrative itself. Daniel effortlessly delivers, his eyes expressing the right emotions. Kathryn tries hard, a few times she's hitting it. Other times she's like a dainty, vulnerable young girl being forced to battle tough times. Her eyes convey ambiguity rather than perceptive and penetrating responses that don't demand words. Her delivery of ""quotable quotes"" and the lines in the debate scene sounds like a graded recitation (yung mukhang minemorize nang maigi).And then the film gets too didactic, telling us what we should make of how Primo and George triumphed at their story and how we should distinguish battle and war as metaphors for love (kung maka-figure of speech!). The film is supposed to tackle maturity in relationship, but it appears that its depiction does not quite go with its marketing. And Star Cinema is not bothered by such incongruency. It just continues to shape love through a narrative that always turns factitious and simplistic. It does not mind reducing it into the fundamentals of melodrama and simplified association or discourse.",80.0,ltbx

The calm vibe and the direct confrontations of the couple make the movie captivating and leave a bitter taste. Bernardo and Padilla act so damn good in this film that I had to check if they indeed broke up in real life. So many emotional moments and the question “Who’s right?” pull the viewer into the story. The rain scene is one of the most legendary moments in Filipino cinema for me. So many emotions with so less words really got me.

raymond_lo,,"Streaming on Netflix now is this topgrossing 2018 Filipino drama that i somehow liked and shamefully but not secretly enjoyed and bawled my eyes out to.  It tells the story of former lovers Primo and George who, at the beginning of the film, relive the days and sad occasions that led to their break-up. For fans of Filipino tearjerkers, a box of tissue may not be enough for this film. It will squeeze you out dry but you will not be complaining. This movie hits all the right formula in the genre. From the beautiful cast to the relatable relationship drama that’s been a staple of Philippine cinema for decades now. The story is somewhat typical but the storytelling is fresh. The conflict is as old as Sharon Cuneta’s first movie (or could be older) but the execution somehow feels novel. There are many cutesy scenes definitely constructed for the diehard fans of the loveteam but it somehow does not offend or get in the way of the developing drama. There is a subplot that will not ordinarily work but somehow works here. Every emotion this movie elicits from the audience is definitely earned.

What I don't like about it is how unrealistic some of the scenes are, but it's saved by the amazing performance of Kathryn and her co-star Daniel. The chemistry they both have is seen clearly in here. Of course, it wouldn't be a Star Cinema film without the following:1. an emotional scene while raining2. going abroad3. medical issues4. daddy/mommy issues5. cheesy and sometimes even cringy lines that feels unrealistic if said in real life.With all of these in mind, I enjoyed the film because it shows the struggle between the people, and how we should always have each other's back no matter what. "" The story they end up telling is actually pretty simple, but there are just so many other things that crowd out the much more affecting core of this story: two people still clearly in love with each other, just trying to overcome the hurt that also still exists between them.

tonttegonzaga,,"Akala ko nung una heavy drama to..... 1. Ang ganda sa umpisa kaso naiba yung direksyon ng kwento nung kalagitnaan hanggang huli2. Contrary sa nakita kong reactions ng fans, di ako agree na problematic si Primo. Oo, idealistic siya at ma-pride. Pero bata pa siya nun. Atsaka tingin ko may pagkukulang din si George. Sa relasyon kasi, dapat may communication. Bigayan kumbaga. Kaso, pareho silang nagsasarili ng hinanakit nila. Pwede naman maayos yan sa masinsinang usapan. Di sinabi ni George yung expectations niya kay Primo at nagtiis nalang siya sa gilid hanggang napuno na siya3. Gusto ko pang makilala si Primo. Parang dito sa movie na to, albeit lovestory siya, mas focused kay George yung kwento. Naging 'pixie dream girl' si Primo. Gusto ko siya. Partly siguro dahil ang charismatic ni Daniel Padilla 4. May ibang plot lines and characters na unnecessary at naging plot device lang sila. Gaya nung past romance movie na napanood ko, di na kelangan pumunta sa ibang bansa para gawing nakakakilig yung story. Tbh, parang irrelevant nga sa main story yung Amsterdam plot nila.5. Sobrang rare talaga siguro ng filipino romance (lalo na yung focused sa loveteam) na maging grounded sa reality. May ibang lines sa movie na kung di korni eh unrealistic. Like, wala namang taong nakakaisip agad ng hugot line and take note, yung sobrang madrama pa. Gusto ko lang siguro talaga ng romance story na makatotohanan.

mieuchntle,,"I’ve watched this film countless times and I just want to watch it again because of the soundtrack number one, the story and because I’m sick and in no mood to watch new movies. Plus I missed this movie because of the trend that’s going around tiktok right now tumawid ka na baby. It reminds me of him in a bittersweet way. Primo the ultimate red flag. I’m quite happy na alam ko sa sarili ko that I would never let this happen to me under any circumstance. It’s just not possible for me be in this situation. First I have a rule I made for myself, that if I want to be in a relationship or to experience relationships it would be during high school. Because I won’t be going to college with a boyfriend. I can’t afford distraction, medicine is already too much I can’t afford to bother with another humans physical and mental health? Plus what do you need a man for? What exactly is their use? You won’t gain anything from, physical touch is 0% on my love language so men would be a 100% hindrance in my case. And don’t start with “makakahanap ka din ng katapat mo” or “bitter, sino nanakit sa ‘yo?” Wala. Tumahimik ka nalang because like men I don’t need an opinion from you about myself. If I’m gonna be honest, I like Primo sa una, he is totally my type, passionate and knows what he wants in life. He’s also smart, musikero plus he’s Daniel Padilla for goodness sake? But my favorite character in this movie would still be Mikko my love the only one who has sense. But kahit ilang beses kong panuorin ‘rong movie na ‘to ‘pag hindi ako maga pause babaha nanaman here sa bahay. I tend to invalidate peoples feelings ‘pag nasabi nila na about sa relationship kung bakit sila depressed. And for all the people feelings whom I invalidate you deserve an apology. I’m so so sorry. My mindset used to be makipag break ka na tapos na lahat ng problema mo I mean for me hindi parin s’ya mahirap but maybe for others it won’t be that easy and I’m slowly opening to that possibility. I’m glad God didn’t give me a friend like George because I only would cry with her because of how much I care about her and I would go to jail because I would accidentally kill Primo. I love Kathryn and Daniel’s acting, I love all their movies omit Barcelona from the list I didn’t appreciate that movie quite as much. I love Can’t help falling in love, she’s dating the gangster of course a classic and this film. This movie has the potential to have my 5 stars and like if it weren’t for Darren Espanto can someone please remove him from the movie. I literally skip every time I see him, his acting was not it. He acts too young for his age in the movie, ‘yung eye sight may problema sa’yo not mentally. I’m so sorry for saying all this but seriously, ang childish? Who made him an actor? He’s a singer not an actor, porket na famous doesn’t mean he has the talent to act, y’all could literally choose anyone tapos he doesn’t look remotely close to the younger version of Yohan, that little kid did it better by the way. He infuriated me more than Primo did all through the movie.Na delete ‘yung other review ko fml. Anyway I just finished the movie and earlier I said I’m so glad that it is impossible for me to experience something like this, but at the end the pain and love of the kiss George and Primo shared made me think what it feels like to fall in love and fall out of love and fall in love all together. I don’t think they ever stopped loving each other but you get my point. I could never experience loving or being loved that hard ever. Anyway, where is the new kathniel film?!

jjmary,,"Honest thought, this could've been a good (not great) movie if George and Primo didn't end up together. The first few minutes of the film was okay, a bit realistic, but onwards, it became super cheesy and frustrating. Please, for the love of God, free Kathryn Bernardo from Daniel Padilla and Cathy Garcia Molina (and other mainstream directors). She either greatly overshadows DJ's acting skills or DJ drags her down with his acting (or the lack thereof). She also wouldn't grow as an actress if she just keeps getting the same role with different names. Cathy Molina has done it again with her favorite movie formula: the toxic guy gets in a relationship with the positive strong woman, they break up, guy or girl goes to a different country and then goes back to the Philippines years later, guy woos girl (redemption arc), girl forgives guy, and they live happily ever after. God, this is why Filipinos love to romanticize problematic relationships and toxic men.",120.0,ltbx

alvinjames_,,"“Patience.”This is the moral of the movie. George and Primo showed a realistic relationship. It is not always a romantic one, sometimes it can be sad and heartbreaking. They let each other because they are tired — but letting go each other makes them grow and be the person they want to be. It is a matter of staying through thick and thin, through your darkest days. It is all about the patience we have in love. Sometimes we get tired, but it doesn't mean we don't want anymore. We just get tired, but we can rest.Maybe one of the lines that I can forget is, “we cannot survive to a battle if we fight each other, but staying together can conquer the battle.”This is one of the best Filipino movie I've ever watch, and undeniably the best KathNiel film ever produced. No doubt, this movie is the 2nd Highgest Grossing Filipino of all time. A masterpiece.",160.0,ltbx

I feel like they should've just stuck to that.

abigailgzmn,,"Love the cold open--contemporary and innovative.Primo's a fucking red flag, egocentrically manipulative as ever. But perhaps Tita Lola was the real antagonist here, charot.Galing ng EO product placement.Very cliché, nakaka-cringe, as always with KathNiel films, but it’s their best films I've watched.I was wondering bakit kailangan umuulan pag may strong heartfelt scene between the two of them. I figured it must be symbolism for George's turmoiled feelings toward Primo. Tulips are definitely a symbolism as well for George's ideal partner. Primo gave him a plastic ones when he was courting her.Background music or the musical scoring can be a little excessive in some scenes, but I realized that commercial local films do be like that. Was it necessary to resolve George and her brother's daddy issue? I don't think that was essential, but the film could've been done without the Amsterdam trip. It could've ended with when they already sold the house. The whole Amsterdam trip and there on was like a second act.Overall, despite being cliche, good execution. Deserve naman ang pagiging batikan ni Direk Cathy Garcia-Molina, time-tested na rin. Subok na ng panahon, ganern.George's mistake was falling in love with Primo's potential.Personally, I resonate with George with her territorial and sungit trait; but damn, she's right, she's dumb and weak when it comes to the fucking guy. I WOULDN'T tolerate Primo's comeback if I were her. Pero feel ko binalikan niya lang din out of convenience and because first and only love. Fave character ko si Mikko dito, the very logical friend.Disappointing ending for me, rupok.",120.0,ltbx

PURE IDIOCY. I can't even side nor feel pity for George. I'm so sorry sweet but you brought this upon yourself. I want to hit her in the head at least just once to wake her up from her own stupidity. I didn't even finish this movie. I stopped watching around the 30-minute mark when I was hinted that they'll surely get back together again. I just hate the ""going blind for love"" trope so much.

After all, sino bang hindi gusto yung taong mahal nila hanggang sa dulo, sa dulo kung saan masaya na kayo?Minsan din tayong naging Primo; desperately chasing our passions in life kahit hindi pa praktikal. Well, art should be a liveable job naman technically, but we all know the reality rn. Still, we all had a little bit of Primo in ourselves believing na what if our passion can be our career at the same time. But mahirap din maging George at Primo. While Primo was chasing his dreams, he forgot that he has a partner to take care of and consider. Si George naman, kakaasikaso at asiste kay Primo, nakalimutan na yung mga sarili niyang pangarap. For me, this is what made the movie realistic.What I didn't like though was the fact na nagkabalikan sila and how they approached it.

Its themes of redemption, growth, and forgiveness seems to be lop-sided in parts, and Kathryn Bernardo's George was poorly written—though Kathryn gave an ecstatic performance. Daniel Padilla as Primo, on the other hand, also gave enough nuance to make his character charming, and surprisingly earnest.

josephweirdness,,"Strictly speaking, probably the best of the Kathniel movies. The one where both put in their most rounded performances, both charming and weighty when necessary. Beyond that, they're supported by much better material than in any of their other films. So much feels authentic and even the silliness of the core concept (dividing a house in half out of spite) feels grounded in a strong emotional reality that it passes by without much resistance from myself. There's also just a lot of interesting visual ideas going on here. Not all of them land perfectly, but I find myself appreciating all of them. In all her best work, Cathy Garcia-Molina has this very strong eye for divisions and framing and how that relates to the characters on screen. Obviously the divided house concept gives her a lot of chance to play with these ideas and generally speaking, they work to the film's benefit more than they detract.Where the film suffers is where it has to bow to the studio tentpole formula. Lengthy travel sequences get included in films like this as a means for the intended audience to live vicariously through the characters. Can't afford to go to The Netherlands? You can at least watch your favorite romcom team go instead. The Netherlands is a beautiful country but the entire subplot around Kathryn's brother and long lost father is just bloat that detracts from the heart of the movie. If this film had simply been contented being a romantic comedy (leaning towards drama), it might have been great. The addition of the family drama weighs it down dreadfully.That being said, it's a good movie. Too much of it works and those first two acts are some of the best I've seen from Filipino mainstream studio films. The crown jewel of the Kathniel canon, yet to be topped.",120.0,ltbx

notkaterin,,"darren and his subplot ruined itfirst half of the film >>> because the second half (the amsterdam arc, specifically) seemed like a different movie.if the amsterdam arc focused more on primo's side (as the film was told from george's point-of-view), rather than the search for george and yohan's father (darren's subplot), the film would be much better and the ending could be ‘more justified.’the only part of that arc that i like is the flower field scene. seeing the tulips was primo's and george's dream together. but things didn't go as planned. same as with life, you don't always get what you wished for but life will always find a way to give you something better or in their case, they became better persons despite the fact that they were unable to reach their dreams together as they had planned.speaking of the flower field scene, i truly wish they had given primo's side equal attention. i believe many viewers failed to notice his depression and suicidal phase. of course, it won't excuse him for what he did, but at least it shows that he didn't do it just because he wants to.overall, thou has lots of iconic lines that became part of philippine pop culture. also one of kathniel's best acting performances—daniel's quiet moments (internal) and kathryn's intense dialogues (external). if not for darren's irrelevant subplot, this will dethrone ‘she's dating the gangster’ as my favorite kathniel film. one of the highest grossing filipino films of all time, without a doubt.“Palibhasa kasi alam na alam mo kung paano ako kunin e.

jm_trece,,"Heartbroken…just heartbroken. I hope the break-up news isn’t true. I truly hope this wasn’t their last movie together. Kathniel movies are the reason I went back to school to pursue film. Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla are inspirations to me. These movies mean so much to me. This couple means the world to me. I’ve been beyond devastated after hearing the heavy rumors of the break-up and it really seems to be true. My heart seriously aches so much…I cannot take it. With the new drama surrounding Kathniel, it can be said that “The Hows of Us” is a reflection of real life. Growing apart…making mistakes…the difficulty to forgive in adulthood…too many factors that limit our happiness…too many factors that change the way we love. The first time I watched this a couple of years ago, I was sobbing at the end of the movie. I was already a huge Kathniel fan before I watched this one, so that ending struck me so hard. Overall, the drama, cinematography and music meshes well together. I believe this is seriously a really beautiful film. I love this movie so much. I love Kathniel so much. I will always love Kathniel. As much as I would hope that they aren’t broken up, it’s not up to me to decide what’s best for them. They have helped me get through rough times. I believed in true love because of them. Sometimes, even the best relationships grow apart. Thank you Kathryn Bernardo. Thank you Daniel Padilla.

Their chemistry is insane, everyone can see it. 11 years and now means nothing? how could this movie becomes real? i watching it again today and i cried so hard. it hits different now, especially when this line comes ""how did you not find a reason to stay?"" it stabbed me to the deepest heart.can you imagine? 11 years they survive, and now they met the final chapter.

Kay tagal rin niyang nagdusa sa makasariling pag-iisip ni Primo.

punanicega,,"Star Cinema have to stop producing repetitive and mediocre storyline for a romantic-drama/comedy film while using famous love teams to extract money from the audience especially to avid Kathniel fans. first, there are so many side stories such as the medical problem and the daddy issue which i find it unnecessary. i also want to point out the longingness of Darren to his father does not break the social construct of a traditional family and his acting makes it even annoying. second, the part where they go abroad seems forced, just to say that the movie is set in Amsterdam. it is irrelevant and a waste of production's money especially they can use provincial places in our country. third, the friends of Kathryn and Daniel are trying hard to be funny and have no significance to the character development of the protagonists even if Juan Miguel's role makes sense. fourth, the dialogues are too cheesy and have so many ""hugot lines"". fifth, the moral story of this film only taught audiences to be hopless romantic and to endure toxicity in order to save the relationship. the only breakthrough somehow is the absence of third party in the relationship. as well, Kathryn is too good as an actress to play another fragile female character.P.S.pangalawang beses ko na itong napanood at ganun pa rin, inis na inis pa rin talaga sa pekikulang ito. hindi na ulit ako mag-aaksaya ng dalawang oras para dito. mas pipiliin ko na lang ulit panoorin ang SDTG o HLG.",,ltbx

lerryjohnofcl,,"Since the breakup of power couple Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla, it seems like the best thing to do is to have a bittersweet marathon of all their films together. Although the teen romance genre is not typically not my cup of tea, the wife and I was able to watch at least one Kathniel film - which turned out to be their last - The Hows of Us (2018). Directed by the go-to filmmaker when it comes to romantic drama blockbusters, Cathy Garcia-Molina crafted something truly special that would resonate more to the love team's followers five years later.The film revolves around the central characters, George (Kathryn Bernardo) and Primo (Daniel Padilla), a couple whose relationship undergoes a tumultuous journey. The narrative ingeniously navigates through the highs and lows of their love story, exploring themes of commitment, dreams, and the inevitable challenges that life throws at them. The storytelling is compelling, keeping the audience engaged with a mix of heartwarming moments and gut-wrenching conflicts.By letting Bernardo and Padilla portray layered and maturing characters, this project breaks the conventional boundaries of the love team which became widely popular through their numerous rom-com TV serials. The commitment of the two young actors make this work as the story revolves around their truly relatable character arcs. Although the supporting cast could also use deeper exploration, the couple's natural chemistry is the beating heart of this film.It may have leaned more towards traditional romantic comedy/drama elements, but the film's success lies in its passionate execution, especially in terms of narrative exploration and character depth. The actors' real-life love story may have ended, but this film shall remain as a highlight of PH cinema.4.0 OUT OF 5STORY - 0.8EXECUTION - 0.8CHARACTERIZATION - 0.8ENTERTAINMENT VALUE - 0.8LASTING IMPACT - 0.8",160.0,ltbx

Secondly, it's got this crazy formula that somehow clicks. Imagine all genres crashing like a traffic jam, but hey, it works like magic. Drama, comedy, romance – it's a whole package. Thirdly, it's like a crash course in Filipino values – family vibes, chasing dreams, and growing old with your ride-or-die. Can't get more Filipino than this.

I'd say ""LEAVE HIM!"" or ""He isn't worth it!!!"" or ""There are other fish in the sea!!! Better fish!!""But I found myself silently relating a bit too much to Primo as I watched. I know how comforting it is that you know that there's someone rooting for you in what you feel are your darkest times. The only difference is that I live alone, therefore there was no one to see me when my 'functional' mask is off. In a way, it's good to not reveal that to anyone. But at the same, it may have been helpful to have someone like Jo around. (anyway, therapy helps!! you dont need a jowa to save you from yourself HAHA)My favorite part was when Jo opened up about how she felt about their breakup. The choice the scriptwriters made to have Jo angry at the fact that Primo left, rather than the fact that we was a piece of shit on the days leading to their breakup made it clear that she really was rooting for him. That her love for Primo was rooted in something deeper than the idea of what he could offer her. She was simply disappointed that he gave up on what they had when she started to break down as well. I definitely feel like their breakup was necessary. At that point, Jo's hope was the singular thread keeping that relationship intact, and hope can only take so much. So when it wasn't strong, the relationship had to unravel. And it was good that they both grew despite being apart.Did she have to go back to Primo? I don't know. If she didn't, i think it'll go to a ""Past Lives"" type of scenario when they meet each other again in the far far future, except with more contempt.On the subject of passion vs. practicality. I wish I knew the answer. I always always want people to choose passion. But I can't relate because I don't have passion. I simply have a drive to survive. So I go for practicality. But if I had passion like Primo, I understand why he acted the way he did. I always imagine that it must be nice to want something so strongly.Overall, I liked this movie.

xpumpkinspice,,"The Hows of UsOne of the best KathNiel films for me. It’s one of my feel-good Pinoy movies. I’ve seen it three times, and I just had some realizations about relationships.After rewatching it, I found myself reflecting again on how love can be so complicated. What makes it more meaningful is not just the love itself—but the presence of understanding, respect, and the choice to keep showing up for each other. It’s not always about grand gestures. Sometimes, it’s the quiet assurance, the willingness to stay, and the help you give one another when things get tough that matter the most.Love is not always filled with happy or funny days—there will be real struggles to face. But having a partner who truly gets you, who won’t make you feel like a burden even in your lowest moments—that’s something else. It’s a different kind of feeling when you’re sharing your life with someone who sees your mess and still chooses to stay. That kind of love feels safe. It feels like home.Living together isn’t easy. But what makes it bearable—even beautiful—is when both people make the choice to stay, to fight for the love they share. It should never be one-sided. A relationship thrives when both partners are making an effort. Communication, respect, loyalty, and understanding—these are the pillars that hold love together.Sharing a home means sharing lives, dreams, flaws, and even pain. It’s not just about romance; it’s about commitment. It’s choosing each other every day, even in the midst of exhaustion, misunderstandings, and storms. There will be moments of doubt, words spoken in anger, and days when love feels more like a burden than a comfort—but staying, especially during the storm, is what love truly asks of us.Before entering a lifelong commitment, ask yourself:Are you truly ready to live with someone through the calm and the chaos, the ease and the effort?Are you ready to love, not just in the good times—but especially in the hardest ones?Are you ready to choose them again and again, even when it’s no longer easy?The Hows of Us doesn’t just show us what love looks like—it shows us what it takes. And if you’re with the right person, every hardship turns into something beautiful.",160.0,ltbx

Well I guess atleast they make up in the end. But still, I don't think I can do what Jo did, sticking to the person they love even though her dreams are slowly getting out of reach. Maybe I'm just scared but by the gods I would rather be alone than experience such gut wrenching pain. Wala naman po nanakit sakin. I just saw how love can build things but also destroy a lot of things. No hate to those people who love love. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. This movie just showed me the real truth about love.

nathyli,,"For the couples drowning in love and survival.Primo (Daniel Padilla) and George (Kathryn Bernardo) are the embodiment of “mahal pero pagod na.” Love alone isn’t enough when dreams and pride collide. The line that cut deepest: “Sawang-sawa na kong magmahal sa ’yo.” It’s cruel, yet so honest. This movie is about the wear and tear of long-term love—the kind that tests your patience and your will to stay.Pero the most painful line for me was George saying:“I needed you to fight for us that night, because I was tired fighting alone.”Ang bigat. Kasi love is supposed to be shared—hindi pwedeng isa lang ang lumalaban. When she said that, it showed how empty and one-sided their relationship had become.For me, George shouldn’t have gone back to Primo. The braver, healthier ending would’ve been choosing herself. Love can’t survive kung ikaw lang ang may hawak ng lubid habang yung isa paulit-ulit na bibitaw. Walking away doesn’t erase the love, but it proves na self-respect and peace are worth more than a history that keeps breaking you. George deserved someone who would fight with her, not leave her fighting alone.",140.0,ltbx

akenonaevis,,"Due to I can't find again the movie I was supposed to watch again today because I want to watch movies that was never heard of or already been buried too deep, I decided to use my sister payment to that hideous app (Netflix). Because in years of subscribing to that app, the ones I've always wanted to watch are not in this app and no, I'm not gonna risk my time and waste it by watching their own horrible production films. Crazy that they managed to change their price when they couldn't even give me a quality… you're really just enjoying this app if you're still a koreaboo (at this time), if you're also a Filipino media enjoyer or an Adam Sandler movie enjoyer and thankfully, I'm not one of either of the three. So yeah that app is just being logged in our TV but no one is actually using it unless we have friends coming over. Totally a waste of money I think but my mother is enjoying it I guess…I literally just said what the hell. If I can't always find the movie I wanted to watch then I'm just wasting the consecutive suspensions of classes so yeah fawk it, I will just whatever's on the table. Well, it's not exactly in the table because I still searched in this app what hideous film I would waste my time and something ticks in me that I should watch a Kathniel movie because why not? And then I remembered that this is one of their films that I still haven't watched but knowing how impactful it is to this country, maybe this is the time. You know, I have always been not a fan of Kathniel. I mean, I don't hate them so much like it's not about them. I just don't invest in Filipino media so much because it hurts to admit but we are really bad at everything in here from the movies, televisions, music and everything so that's why I stopped investing in that side. But #trust that whenever there's an issue lying around of course, I'll be there. I'm sorry I'm just a normal Filipino who loves gossip and nosing my butt in other's lives. I remembered back when I was Grade 12, we had a roleplay activity that we had to do in front of us and we had some movie references that we could copy and this movie is one of them. First is, the teacher showed us the scene of Kathryn’s crying in the rain scene and lol I literally take a picture of that and posted in my story and said that this woman really cannot act and all my classmates saw it and laugh about it so that's why one of the best known of me is being a hater of Kathryn Bernardo. And hey! I'm sorry if I was called that . I never wanted it and I never intended to. I was just being honest and I told you that I still haven't watched this movie so watching that scene out of context really brought the wrong and early judgment of me. But this is why I'm changed now that I watched this film. I don't know if I can do it since I still haven't watched all of her films but based on the films that I watched, this really might be her best performance yet. But I wouldn't say the best… I mean she definitely improved maybe because her roles have always been the same for years and this role back then might be the most mature one yet and I really see that. Her character here is one of the best ones she played and one of the best written yet considering this was written by the same director who always gives the same quality of characters for me. There's an attempt here that I really appreciate but I still hope that it could've been more just like the rest of all people. I need her to be bolder, stronger and better. But it's enough I guess if this is actually the story they wanted to portray since the start.I know one thing that we can agree on liking this. The YEARNING. It might be the best love approach that can be shown in the media. And it's rare for me to watch a Filipino movie that the yearning was done right. This is the highlight of the film for me. You can really feel the couple’s chemistry in this movie and I understand and see that considering this is one of this couple's peak years. I was smiling, giggling like a girl and entertained. But it's also annoying to watch now. I think this is really one of the films that can be watched back then but cannot be now. This is their best role yet if we're gonna base it on the chemistry like they're literally just being a couple in here but with a plot. And it's making me mad that they can't be like that off camera now because this man played his role a little too well. Fawk this guy to death like I wish he never finds a stardom again after what he did to their relationship. Everybody is worshiping your relationship like it was a major holiday whenever you're doing something. But you are also the one who ruined it. Men really are ruining everything. Straight men specifically. I like Primo in this movie but I can't bear to see that it was being played by this man.There's still some bad acting in this movie that of course, will never go in Filipino movies. And yes that was you Darren. Question, why is he here?? Seriously. Ah. I remember now. I live in the Philippines where everybody can be anything just because they can! Like just go back being a singer or do something but just please don't ever step foot in the acting industry. I think the gay best friend is doing the bare minimum too, like a little bit overacting for me because I'm a gay bestfriend too or maybe I just didn't like his character in here. I mean it's obvious to me in the start how he didn't want her to be happy and I wouldn't do that to my girl besties. It's not right for me to see Jean Garcia not acting an antagonist because she really solidified her career in those roles. Like why do I kinda need her to slap Primo in here?? The thing is, I wouldn't hate this movie so much because my friend right literally acted like George who is always coming back to her ex and I know a lot of y’all are being hypocrites too because I'm sure as hell you would do the same as George or far worse. I mean that's literally one of the reasons why we don't have proper birth control in our country, right? But I'm glad the quote of “Love is not enough” is being taken seriously now and being the base or references of every couple now because it's always been the right statement for every couple. The ending was a lackluster for me. I mean I literally have to go through their makeup which is too long for me. It is too long just to end it with George seeing Primo’s letter that he hid in the music record which is I still think why'd he have to hide in there. I don't think the finding father plot was out of place but if the results are like that then the whole Amsterdam scene should've been the time where the finally made up and spent each other's lives again together and better. In short, the yearning was too good just to have unsatisfying results. I might say that this was a good choice of movie. This is definitely Kathryn's one of best roles and I hope she continues to improve and I will continue to support her career and wish the downfall of that man on the other hand. I hope she's happy and is eating a good meal everyday. Daniel Padilla, you will burn in hell. I will make sure of that.B Tier2018 Ranked",140.0,ltbx

I’m not saying that this movie was bad because of Primo’s actions, without the way he acted in the beginning the movie itself wouldn’t exist or progress anywhere. I’m actually pretty happy and I found it sweet that Primo was willing to help George and her family out. Shows that he deeply did care for her, he always has but was incredibly selfish during the time he left. They both had their issues.

ashesinembers,,"It’s the first time I’m writing a review for a romance movie, although I do actually watch some. This one hits different when it comes to love. The way they portrayed the characters, it’s just bitter yet sweet. My favorite scene is when they were outside during the rain—Joy’s dialogue is what you’d feel the most. She was giving her pieces one by one to her love, so she was left with nothing in the end. Despite that, Primo actually received nothing, because people do not get the ability to receive that. Only to suck it up. Both of them were drained and sad and lost.For Primo’s side, he was really a good man. Although for the scenes that he was facing bad things, he didn’t deserve Joy nor anything from her. I pitied him. But it doesn’t mean that Joy should feel that, too. That’s why when they got away from each other, it was probably to find themselves. That’s how I liked The Hows of Us. The ending is up to you, actually. Whether they ended up together or just friends. The only thing I hope is for them to be happy.",160.0,ltbx

ionine,,"loved the delivery of the exposition, lalo na yung direct parallels from when they were still together to 2 years after the breakup. very similar in style sa starting over again, which is fave ko. what i really loved about this movie aside from the characters is the pacing, manner of narration, and the way it portrayed how jo lost her resolve and resistance against primo, kasi relatable pa rin kahit na nakakainis at nakakairita na yung katangahan ni george. matalino naman talaga siya pero i think ang problema sa kanya is masyado niyang sineryoso ang feelings na nagresurface noong bumalik si primo, in short, masyadong marupok! remember, hindi lahat ng emotion na nararamdaman natin sa katawan ay reliable. we should never make decisions based on our feelings alone, dapat may balance between objective fact/reality and what we feel. totoo na mahal pa rin ni george si primo, pero at the same time, malaki ang kasalanan at trauma na nacause ni primo kay george, kaya hindi dapat nagpadala si george sa feelings niya at bumalik kay primo. what they need from each other is sincere apology with accountability and closure, hindi comeback. hindi deserve ni george na magstay sa taong katulad ni primo. george deserves so much better, and not the ""better"" that primo has to offer.",,ltbx

woesbythesea,,"This one hurt differently— not in the loud, heart-wrenching way some love stories do, but in that slow ache of staying too long. Of loving past the expiration date. Of fighting for something that no longer knows how to fight back.George and Primo weren’t star-crossed or tragic in the classic sense. They were real. Exhausted. Stubborn. Still soft for each other beneath the bruises of all those unfinished conversations. And maybe that’s what made it worse— their love didn’t end with anger. It ended with the weight of trying. Again and again. And again.I didn’t cry at the big scenes.I cried when she stared at him from across the room and didn’t know what to say.I cried at the way he said “pangarap” like it used to mean us, and now it only means me.The film didn’t scream. It simmered. It dragged me through the quiet cruelties of outgrowing someone you still care for. It reminded me of the version of myself I stayed with too long. The promises we tried to keep when our hearts had already started packing.And yet— somehow— it wasn’t hopeless. It was sad, but not bitter. That’s harder to write. That’s harder to feel.It whispered,“You loved. You outgrew. You survived.”And sometimes, that’s the most devastating line of all.This film felt like a letter you never sent. The kind that sits in your notes app. Half bitter. Half soft. Fully human.If you’ve ever loved someone deeply and had to choose yourself anyway— this one will sting. Gently.",160.0,ltbx

eynjeli,,"""The Hows of Us” isn’t your usual dreamy, rom-com na may happy-ever-after agad. It digs deeper—sobrang sakit, sobrang real. This movie shows na kahit gaano kalalim ang pagmamahalan n'yo, minsan, hindi ‘yon sapat para manatili. George and Primo’s story hits hard kasi hindi ito tungkol sa how they met, kundi sa how they survived... or didn’t.Pero ang ganda ng mga songs dito ha, damang-dama.It’s about love that starts with so much fire but slowly fades into frustration, broken dreams, and too many “sorrys.” Yung mga “I love you” na eventually napalitan ng “Pagod na ako.” Yung tipong mahal mo pa, pero pagod ka na. At ‘di ba, that’s one of the worst kinds of heartbreak?Kathryn nailed it with her raw, painful delivery—lalo na sa scene kung saan sinasabi niya kung gaano siya naghihintay na lumaban si Primo.""How did you not found a reason stay?""""And what makes your sorry different from all your sorry before?""Ang ganda rin ng message ng film: Love isn’t always magical. Minsan, love is staying, choosing, and fixing—kahit ang hirap-hirap na.Tho nawala lang yung gana ko kasi bakit ganon na lang uli naging soft si George kay Primo? 7 years siyang nawala and parang tinanggap niya lang uli as if 1 week silang nag-away? Hindi man lang pinahirapan yang si Primo kahit na gusto niya pa, sinubukan niya man lang sana na i-challenge para mas masukat kung totoo na ba talaga yung pinapakita niya.

y3su,,"“in order to win a war, you have to stay together.”that line hit hard because love isn’t about avoiding conflict, it’s about choosing to stay even when it’s hard. the hows of us reminded me that real love isn’t always romantic or dreamy. it’s work, patience, and showing up even when it hurts.what stood out to me was kung gano kadali sumuko when things get painful, and how rare it is to hold on. but sometimes, like the film said, all we need is a little patience.some relationships need space to grow. others grow best together. and figuring that out is part of the journey.i learned that love means constantly choosing each other. not just when it’s easy, but especially when it’s not. facing the problem together, talking, being tired together, resting when needed. that’s what makes love last.i hope one day i find a kind of love that feels safe, honest, and patient. and i hope that kind of love finds me, too.",160.0,ltbx

Not sure if it was his execution or bad writing but his 17 yo character acts like a 9 yo on some occasions, which I find weird. George's friends are lowkey annoying too. The plot was all over the place- lots of things don't make sense (eg. tita lola entrusting Primo to the house, the Amsterdam storyline, etc.)The acting, however, was very powerful here. Kathryn's delivery was very raw. Daniel improved so much. He's not that on par with Kath still imo, but not too bad.",100.0,ltbx

kczndra,,"The House of Us is a quiet kind of heartbreak. It tells the story of two people who once shared the same dreams but slowly drifted apart. It is not the loud kind of love. It is the kind that stays even when things get hard. The kind that gets tired but never fully disappears.It shows how love can be full of promises, but life can still find a way to test every one of them. They love each other deeply, but they are no longer the same people who started the journey. And that is what hurts the most. Watching two people hold on while slowly breaking inside.The film reminds you of the love you once believed would last forever. The kind that felt like home. And when that love starts to fall apart, it does not shatter all at once. It fades. Quietly. Painfully. And yet, in all the breaking, there is still hope. Hope that love, when chosen again, can still heal. Even if nothing is the same anymore.",200.0,ltbx

stupidthoughts,,"The Hows of Us felt to me like a simple, yet not shallow romantic melodrama. It sits somewhere between emotional depth and surface-level storytelling, focusing on a couple navigating love, breakup, and reconciliation.The screenplay was simple but had an almost episodic feel to it, i wasn't annoyed by it though and actually enjoyed some of the sequences as well.The humor was a mix of slightly cringeworthy moments and genuinely funny ones.The romance, both in its joyful and sorrowful moments had a mixture of both melodramatic, over the top yet funny moments, dialogues that felt like lied between borderline cringe and genuinely touching and effectively playful at times as well The chemistry between the leads stood out. I liked them as a couple, and both gave good performances, the lady, maybe, more than the male lead, since the writers did give her a bit more importance with backstory, depth and dialogues and so the actress had more to work with in here.The Amsterdam scene was the only one that felt a little unnecessary. Even though it added depth to both characters, especially George and featured the important flower field moments, and the detailing regarding her wish to watch tulips and all, there was still something about it that felt out of place.

watdapaks,,"""I needed for you to fight for us that night because I was so tired fighting alone""Napa what if nalang talaga ako sa part na what if George read the letter in the vinyl record on her birthday? Would it change the trajectory of their story? Would it be enough to convince her to continue fighting even though she's drained and exhausted of everything? Would they still be together? And if she did, would it be worth it? But I also realized that it's good narin na hindi niya nabasa kasi after ending things with Primo, she had a better life. Kahit mahirap at masakit para sa kanya. This made me realize that sometimes you have to lose what you thought you needed in order to make space for what you truly deserve.Maraming pagkakamali si Primo, and of course may mali din si George. Lalo na sa part na she has all the reason to walk away and leave Primo before, but she just can't kasi sobrang mahal niya. It's not her fault for loving someone at their worst. Pero sana hindi niya kinalimutan yung self worth niya. Nakakahinayang lang talaga yung years na nasayang niya taking care of Primo only to end up sacrificing her opportunity to become a doctor This reminded me that you can love someone with all your heart but do not forget your own worth in the process. You don't have to shrink your worth just to fit someone else's comfort or expectation. Girl, you do you! Ang pinaka takeaway ko sa movie na 'to is to choose wisely between love and life's priorities. Know when to stop and walk away kasi walking away is not just about giving up on love, but choosing to honor your worth and the future you've worked so hard for. Also, hindi ibigsabihin na may natapos ay tapos na. The end is just the beginning of something better. To my girlies, I hope we won't experience what George had gone through. I hope we don't meet the Primo in our life that will make us choose between love or career. I hope we get the love that we truly deserve. ",160.0,ltbx

alyxeon,,"Watching this was an experience that truly stayed with me  I remember settling in for the film, not knowing that it would stir up so many emotions and memories of my own ups and downs in love. From the very first scene, the realistic portrayal of a relationship’s joys and struggles pulled me into a world that felt both familiar and profoundly moving.What struck me most was the film’s honest depiction of the challenges that come with deep, enduring love. The story isn’t about a perfect romance; it’s about real-life conflicts, sacrifices, and the bittersweet moments that define our relationships. I found myself recalling personal experiences times when love meant both elation and heartache and this connection made the film’s narrative all the more powerful.The chemistry between KathNiel was undeniable  Their performances felt genuine, conveying the vulnerability and intensity of their characters’ journey. I was particularly touched by how their expressions and subtle gestures spoke volumes, often more than the dialogue could. It’s rare for a film to make you feel as if you’re living the characters’ experiences alongside them, and that’s something I felt deeply throughout the movie (I just want to mention this so bad ) Beyond the romance and drama, this prompted me to reflect on my own relationships. There were moments of quiet introspection scenes where the characters faced their inner battles and external pressures that resonated with me personally. The film’s pacing allowed for these moments to sink in, making the experience both cathartic and thought provoking.The cinematography was evident in every frame  The visual storytelling, from intimate close ups to sweeping shots of the setting, created an immersive atmosphere. I appreciated how the film balanced its dramatic highs with more tender, reflective scenes, offering a nuanced look at what it means to love and to let go.In the end I just want to say, AY LAB IT SO MUCH!  The Hows of Us isn’t just a love story it’s a reminder of the complexities and realities of life. It left me with a sense of nostalgia and a deeper appreciation for the unpredictable nature of relationships. (which I don’t feel much anymore ‘cuz I just expect the worse) For anyone who has ever loved, lost, or simply wondered about the true nature of connection, THIS FILM IS DEF A MUST WATCH! ",200.0,ltbx

jaeorense,,"Reflection on The House of Us (2018)The 2018 Filipino film The House of Us, is an emotionally stirring drama that explores love, dreams, and the struggle to hold onto relationships despite life’s hardships. The movie follows the story of Primo (Daniel Padilla) and George (Kathryn Bernardo), a couple whose relationship is tested by ambition, miscommunication, and the harsh realities of life. Watching this film was a deeply emotional experience, as it delved into themes that felt incredibly real and relatable. It made me reflect on the complexities of love and the sacrifices that people make to sustain their relationships.One of the most striking aspects of The House of Us is how it captures the essence of Filipino relationships and family dynamics. The plot feels deeply Filipino because of its emphasis on love as not just an emotion but also a responsibility. Many Filipinos will see themselves in George and Primo characters who represent different perspectives on dreams and commitment. The film also highlights the idea of bahay, or home, as not just a physical structure but a place built through shared experiences and struggles. This theme resonates strongly with Filipino audiences, as family and home play a crucial role in Filipino culture. The sacrifices made by George and her struggle to balance love with self-respect mirror the reality of many Filipinos who navigate relationships while trying to improve their circumstances.The film also appears to reference other works in the romance and drama genre, particularly in how it presents its narrative and themes. For instance, it shares similarities with One More Chance (2007), another Filipino film that explores second chances in love and the consequences of choices in a relationship. Like One More Chance, The House of Us portrays raw emotions and the difficult path toward forgiveness and reconciliation. Additionally, it takes inspiration from classic romance tropes found in both literature and film, such as the idea of lovers growing apart due to personal ambitions but later finding a way to reconnect. These references are used effectively to enhance the film’s storytelling, making it feel familiar yet fresh.",200.0,ltbx

itsmenutella,,"‘The Hows of Us’ is a 2018 Filipino romantic drama directed by Cathy Garcia-Molina, starring Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla. As the movie goes, we follow Primo and George, a couple who dreamed of building a life together but struggled with the realities of love, career aspirations, and personal growth. As their relationship faces a lot of challenges along with their career progress, they must decide whether to keep fighting for their love or let go for their own individual happiness. The movie offers a deep and emotional look into love, sacrifices, and the struggles of young couples trying to build life together.The movie brought a mix of emotions, joy, frustration, heartbreak, and hope. It was easy to connect with the struggles of Primo and George, making their story feel real and authentic. There were moments of kilig (romantic excitement), especially in the early stages of their relationship, but as they grew together conflicts arose, I felt the pain and frustration of their struggles. The film’s emotional depth made it hard not to sympathize with both characters, especially George, who had to make difficult choices for her standing in the relationship and the stake of her future. The ending will leave you with an emotional strain that is bittersweet yet satisfying impact.Their dialogue felt natural and realistic, blending Filipino and English like everyday conversations. Their emotional exchanges, especially during conflicts, made them more authentic and relatable. The movie reflects Filipino culture through family values, sacrifices, and dreams. The setting, character names, and struggles with career and relationships make it deeply relatable to Filipino audiences. For me, a ‘Hugot’ refers to heartfelt deep feelings of emotional lines drawn from personal experiences. A memorable hugot line from the movie is when George said to Primo“Matalino akong tao eh! Pero ba’t pagdating sayo? Ba’t sayo ang tanga-tanga ko.” This captures the vulnerability of a person to love that she feels smart in life but weak when it comes to her own emotions.In conclusion, ‘The Hows of Us’ is more than just a film, it is a reflection of real-life relationships and the challenges that come with love and personal growth. The emotions it expresses, the realistic dialogues, and the distinctly Filipino elements make it a compelling and heartfelt movie. It beautifully captures the essence of hugot, making it relatable to anyone who has experienced love and heartbreak.

It's challenging to internalize emotions when others expect you to remain composed and manage your daily life without showing any signs of distress.

Even after Primo came back, he needed another breakdown from George to realize the damage he caused couldn’t be fixed with sweet gestures or “pa-pogi” moments. No relationship is perfect, but the situations here were a little difficult for me, and it lacked empathy until the very end. That was a huge red flag. George deserved better!!!also, the ending was so cliché, I wanted George to choose herself and focus on her own growth instead of returning to Primo. She had so much potential on her own, and the movie missed that opportunity. I think they’re better off apart, because sometimes maturity is realizing the person you love might be better off without you. I wish they had stayed on good terms instead of jumping back into a relationship. They should’ve taken it slow. The ending really didn’t sit right with me huhu – again, George deserved better as for my additional prompts, I don’t think romance films are a waste if the leads don’t end up together. A good film is about character growth, not just staying together. Sometimes, not being together is the more mature choice. In *The Hows of Us*, I think it would’ve been better if George didn’t go back to Primo. Their personal growth was more important than just a happy ending.

The lesson you get from this movie is that you need balance in love. Give yourself time and love, and do the same for your partner and the people in your life. Make yourself a priority because you can't truly support others if you're lacking in yourself. It's literally in our culture to love fiercely even when it's hard.

mayannarellano,,"The Hows of Us* (2018) is an affecting study in love, sacrifice, and the trials of maturing together—or apart—through time. Directed by Cathy Garcia-Molina and starring Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla, the film tracks Primo and George, a couple whose erstwhile brilliant future is gradually extinguished by ambition, disillusionment, and the harsh realities of adulthood.What is particularly Filipino about *The Hows of Us* is its visceral emotional center, one that speaks to the very notion of *hugot*—that bare, gut-level pull of emotion oftentimes associated with individual histories of love and heartbreak. Primo's quest for his ambitions, with George lugging the burden of prudence, reflects a common Filipino dynamic in which aspiration and responsibility tend to war against one another. The fact that *pamilya* is an important consideration in their choices also makes the story more rooted in Filipino culture, reaffirming the way that love is seldom just between two individuals, but wrapped up in family obligations. The movie also toys with the concept of *sayang*—that aching, lingering sorrow when love fails because of everything. Although *The Hows of Us* provides closure, it dwells on the heartache of nearly losing someone, so it is understandable to anyone who has ever clung to love a little too long. It does not merely pose the question of whether love is worth fighting for, but whether love by itself is ever sufficient.Would the life of Primo and George have been the same if they were not in the Philippines? Maybe not. The cultural significance of *kapit* (holding on), *tiis* (patience), and the anticipation of *pagtatagal* (enduring love) influence their journey.

The kilig when Primo & George's relationship was just starting, the happiness I felt with them when their relationship worked for years, and also the anger when things started to go downhill and Primo chose to be selfish, self-centered, immature and impractical with the decisions he made which greatly affected George's mental health and career because she put Primo on top of her priority, especially over her exam. Truly, love can make people do crazy things, not thinking and considering the consequences that comes with it. The movie also portrayed the importance of maintaining the teamwork in the relationship, the ""doing things together"" even with the smallest thing. Most importantly, the show is an eye opener of the beauty of growing, even if it means the need of growing apart. The beauty of exploring life outside your comfort zone, facing your fears and conquering what the world has for you outside your shell. After all, if things are really meant to happen, no matter how many turns, delays or challenges you both face in life, fate will have its own way of bringing you back to each other's life. At that time, you both are grown up, able to make decisions that also considers your partner and has a different perspectives in life, making you love each other in the right way—the way you both deserve to love and to be loved. Just like how fate brought back Primo and George together after years of not having communication, both shared different life realizations and lessons that made them who they were when they met again.

Unlike many conventional romance films that often present fairy-tale endings and idealized narratives, this movie authentically examines the tough choices couples must face, especially the delicate balance between pursuing personal dreams and nurturing a commitment to a loved one.The palpable chemistry between Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla enhances the emotional depth of their characters’ journey. The film expertly integrates ""hugot"" lines—expressions that resonate with real-life experiences of heartbreak and hope—adding a layer of relatability that connects with viewers on a personal level.A defining aspect of this film is its depiction of Filipino values, particularly the emphasis on perseverance, the significance of family, and the necessity of shared responsibilities. These principles are fundamental to Filipino relationships, allowing George and Primo’s struggles to resonate even more profoundly with the audience. Their story intertwines themes of survival and mutual support, grounding their experience in a relatable reality.Moreover, ""The Hows of Us"" leaves a lasting impression by conveying that love encompasses far more than grand gestures or passionate romances.

I understand; he wants to provide for their future and be successful, but in the end, he loses. He had forgotten the concept of relationship. He was so focused on his ambition that he forgot he had a partner who needed him.Conversely, George shows that when a woman falls in love, she is prepared to jeopardize everything to validate her worthiness.Every relationship has its own unique set of stories, problems, and dreams. However, we all know that we all desire the same ending: ""Happily ever after"". LOVE is more than just passion or practicality; it is about mutual respect, understanding, and compromise. Primo becomes more open and supportive of George's artistic ambitions, seeing that her dreams are an integral part of who she is. He learns to be more open about his personal needs and worries, rather than focusing solely on providing for their future.George, in turn, learns to understand that partnerships involve effort, and that love is more than just beautiful gestures; it is also about overcoming obstacles together. She understands that they may still dream together, but they must learn to compromise and talk openly. In the film's last minutes, they are seen heading forward together, hand in hand, with a fresh sense of dedication to one other.

She silently bears the weight of their struggles, believing in his potential for success. Despite her exhaustion, she remains supportive, only voicing her burden when she can no longer endure it. Her immense sacrifice exemplifies the Filipino concept of ""tanga sa pag-ibig"", yet her actions are entirely understandable, stemming from her deep love and faith in Primo.I loved how each character's growth leads to self-discovery, particularly Primo's understanding of sacrifice and his ability to overcome his pride.Primo and George's journey isn't perfect; it demands significant sacrifices and overcoming numerous challenges. Nonetheless, the film emphasizes the importance of individual and couple growth. It teaches us that relationships don't stifle dreams; rather, shared dreams foster growth.

This movie is a reflection on personal growth, the need for compromise, and sometimes painful process of maturing within a relationship. I think Kathryn especially owned this film after showcasing such true and raw emotions whenever there are those bawling scenes with Daniel that was either because of happiness, anger or grief. And Daniel somehow became less of the typical cool and proud character he has portrayed in the past and he showed that he can also shine in his quiet, turned well-mannered character who isn’t argumentative or proud.The portrayal of George and Primo’s love has not been grand. In fact, the turn of events in their love story were unflattering. There’s nothing to be proud of when your boyfriend is broke but still can’t swallow his pride because he is too inflexible to do something else aside from his music. There’s nothing to be proud of that George is devoted to a person who kept proving to her and to other people that he’s just a no good. It’s hard that they’ve reached the ultimate slump in their relationship and they have to realize that it’s no longer healthy to stay in that relationship. Most definitely, it is silly and true for us humans, that we only find ourselves and make time to right our wrongs when we’ve lost the most important thing in our lives.As for the hugot, I can't forget when Kat said ""Pagod na pagod na pagod na pagod na ko"", we all feel this whenever we feel that we're the only one who carries the relationship.

No matter what happens, always communicate, consider each other's feelings, don't give up easily, and it's okay to rest, but not to give up. This film is a beautiful filipino masterpiece, showcasing that love can last if both partners understand each other and always choose to find solutions instead of giving up. It realistically portrays love's challenges, and its Filipino perspective, where it highlights that love isn't just about romance; it involves choosing between personal dreams and commitment to a loved one.

rieanrose,,"Reflection on The Hows of UsThe Hows of Us is a deeply emotional film that resonated with me on many levels. It made me feel a mix of sadness, hope, and pride, as it told a story of love and perseverance that felt both universal and uniquely Filipino. The struggles of George and Primo, balancing love with personal growth and ambition, struck a chord because they reflect real-life challenges many young couples face, especially in the Philippines.What makes the movie distinctly Filipino is its emphasis on family, sacrifice, and resilience. George’s deep sense of responsibility, not just for herself but for her shared dreams with Primo, mirrors the Filipino value of bayanihan or communal support. The setting, with its familiar homes, vibrant streets, and local culture, immediately evokes the everyday life of many Filipinos. Even the characters’ names, George and Primo, feel relatable and authentic, reflecting how Filipino names often carry simplicity and charm.The way the characters look and speak also feels Filipino. Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla embody a natural, down-to-earth aesthetic that resonates with Filipino audiences. Their dialogue, filled with a mix of English and Filipino (Taglish), reflects how many Filipinos communicate. The humor, the dramatic expressions, and even the moments of silence between them capture the essence of how Filipinos connect and express themselves in relationships.The plot itself feels inherently Filipino because it revolves around themes of sacrifice, enduring hardship, and chasing dreams despite adversity. Primo’s struggle to pursue his passion for music, even as it strains his relationship with George, reflects the Filipino spirit of pangarap (dreaming big) and the tension it creates within relationships and families. George’s ultimate decision to prioritize herself is a powerful message about self-love, but it is also rooted in the idea that love requires strength and compromise—values deeply embedded in Filipino culture.This story couldn’t have unfolded the same way if the characters weren’t Filipino. The cultural backdrop, their ways of handling conflict, and their resilience are shaped by the Filipino way of life. The characters’ dreams, their struggles with finances, and their deep connections to family and tradition are experiences many Filipinos can relate to.The film also nods to other works in Filipino cinema, especially the tradition of romantic dramas that deal with heartbreak and redemption. Its themes are universal, yet the Filipino flavor in its storytelling, dialogue, and values make it stand out. On the other hand, The Hows of Us has become iconic in itself, often referenced in memes and conversations about modern relationships in the Philippines. Lines like “I’m so tired” have become symbolic of emotional struggles, and the movie has been hailed as a modern classic in Filipino romance films.In conclusion, The Hows of Us is more than a love story; it’s a reflection of Filipino culture and values. It speaks to the heart of what it means to love, to dream, and to grow—both as individuals and as a couple—while staying true to one’s roots.

The story revolves around dreams, sacrifices, and the struggle between love and personal ambition—things that many Filipinos, especially the younger generation, can deeply relate to. George and Primo’s relationship isn’t the sugarcoated romance we often see in mainstream rom-coms. It’s raw, messy, and full of the kind of emotional punches that make you reflect on your own relationships, whether they’re romantic, familial, or even personal aspirations that require difficult choices.The film also captures a very Filipino dynamic—the expectation to endure, to stay, to fight for love even when things get unbearably hard. It highlights the cultural sentiment of “sayang” when relationships don’t work out, as if every failed relationship is a lost investment rather than a lesson. The setting, the way the characters talk, the family pressures, and even the concept of diskarte in life and love all feel so close to home.As for hugot, The Hows of Us is full of it. George’s monologues about feeling exhausted from carrying the relationship on her own hit hard. Primo’s struggle between chasing his dreams and being a responsible partner is a reality many Filipinos face. The line “Pagod na pagod na ako” is something that lingers, because haven’t we all, at some point, felt drained from fighting for something that no longer feels fair? Do romance films feel “sayang” when the leads don’t end up together? Not necessarily. But in this case, the ending was both satisfying and realistic—love isn’t just about the big gestures, it’s about growth, timing, and the willingness to compromise. The Hows of Us gives us a hopeful ending, but not before reminding us that love isn’t just about staying; it’s about choosing each other despite the hardships, over and over again.",200.0,ltbx

The movie cleverly interweaves their present struggles with flashbacks of their blossoming romance, offering a compelling look at how time and circumstance can impact even the strongest bonds. While the film certainly delivers the kilig moments KathNiel fans expect, it also delves into deeper emotional territory, prompting viewers to reflect on their own relationships and the sacrifices love often demands.Personally, ""The Hows of Us"" resonated with me because it portrayed a relationship that felt real and relatable. It wasn't a fairytale romance; it was a story about two people trying to make it work, even when things got tough. I appreciated the film's honesty in depicting the arguments, the insecurities, and the moments of doubt that are inevitable in any long-term partnership. It reminded me that love isn't always sunshine and rainbows; it's also about navigating storms together and choosing to stay, even when it's hard. The film's exploration of dreams, both individual and shared, also struck a chord. It highlighted the importance of supporting each other's aspirations, even when they diverge from the initial plan.On social media, I'd caption a still from the movie with something like, ""Love isn't about finding someone you can live with, it's about finding someone you can't live without... even when they drive you crazy. #TheHowsOfUs #Hugot #KathNiel #RelateMuch"". Another post could feature a picture of George crying with the caption, ""Sometimes, love means letting go. But sometimes, it also means fighting harder. Which one is the real deal? #TheHowsOfUs #LoveLessons #KathNiel #DeepThoughts"". These ""hugot"" lines capture the emotional core of the film and tap into the universal experiences of love, loss, and the complexities of human relationships.The film's plot twist revolves around the true meaning of the ""hows"" in the title. While the audience initially assumes it refers to the practicalities of a relationship (how to live together, how to manage finances, etc.), the twist reveals a deeper meaning. It turns out that the ""hows"" refer to the different ways people love. Primo's love language is acts of service and providing for George, while George expresses her love through words and emotional support. The film highlights how these different ""hows"" can sometimes clash, leading to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. The resolution comes when they finally understand and appreciate each other's unique ways of loving, realizing that love isn't just about grand gestures but also about recognizing and valuing the small, everyday expressions of affection.",200.0,ltbx

It showed that relationships require effort, understanding, and the courage to make difficult choices. The film was emotional and relatable, making me reflect on the importance of balancing dreams and reality.",200.0,ltbx
raizashaianne,,"The Hows of Us (2018) takes a familiar romance-drama formula and injects it with a uniquely Filipino emotional weight. At its core, the film explores the struggles of long-term relationships, the sacrifices made for love, and the inevitable tension between personal dreams and shared commitments.What makes it distinctly Filipino is how it portrays tiis—the kind of endurance that many Filipinos, especially in relationships, hold on to even when things seem hopeless. George (Kathryn Bernardo) and Primo (Daniel Padilla) feel like real people, with George embodying the practical, hardworking Filipina who shoulders more than she should, and Primo representing the dreamer whose ambitions often come at a cost. Their dynamic feels all too familiar, echoing real-life relationships where one partner gives more, hoping the other will eventually change.The film resonates because it doesn’t just rely on hugot lines; it captures the quiet, painful moments of love falling apart. It asks a question that many Filipinos face: When is love no longer enough? And while it gives a hopeful resolution, it never diminishes the emotional toll of staying in a relationship that’s slowly breaking you.It’s a heavy watch, but it’s also a necessary one—reminding us that love isn’t just about how we stay, but why we choose to.",200.0,ltbx

It's emotionally impactful,it resonated strongly with us .and also the film was relatable, as it portrays realistic relationship challenges. offering both heartwarming and heart wrenching moments.",,ltbx
sj4ni,,"The film ""The Hows of Us"" depicts love, ambition, and the difficulties of sustaining a long-term relationship in a realistic manner, making it a truly human film. It explores the difficulties of sticking together when dreams conflict and life changes unexpectedly, in contrast with typical romantic romances.The film is relatable because it reflects the true difficulties of commitment via their journey of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery. Additionally, viewers are emotionally moved by the film's themes of sacrifice, resiliency, and the agony of letting go. It portrays relationships as messy, difficult, but worthwhile rather than sugarcoating them. The story feels even more true because of the cultural components, which include pressure to succeed and family expectations. The Hows of Us ultimately captures the unadulterated feelings of love, grief, and personal development, and is more than just a love story.",200.0,ltbx

pia_uy,,"The Hows of Us feels deeply Filipino in many ways, making it easy for audiences to connect with the story.1. Family Comes First – Unlike Western romances that focus just on the couple, this film highlights how family plays a big role in relationships. George takes care of her younger brother, and Primo struggles with family expectations, showing the Filipino value of utang na loob (debt of gratitude).2. Love, Sacrifice, and Destiny – The movie reflects the Filipino belief in tadhana (destiny) and habambuhay na pag-ibig (lifelong love), where love is worth fighting for despite hardships. George’s patience with Primo and his journey to redemption mirror the sacrifices many Filipinos make for love.3. Familiar Names and Language – George (Georgina) and Primo are names that feel natural in Filipino culture, and the dialogue blends English and Tagalog, just like everyday conversations in the Philippines.4. Authentic Filipino Settings – From traditional homes and Manila’s busy streets to picturesque scenes in Amsterdam, the locations reflect real-life struggles—staying in the Philippines or chasing dreams abroad.5. Dreams vs. Reality – Primo’s passion for music and George’s need for stability represent a common Filipino dilemma: following your dreams or choosing practicality.6. Heartfelt Hugot – The film is packed with emotional lines that hit home, like “Pagod na ako. Kakahintay, kakasalo, kakaisip kung may patutunguhan ba tayo.” These deep, relatable moments make the story even more impactful.Overall, The Hows of Us isn’t just a love story but it’s a reflection of real Filipino relationships, values, and struggles.",200.0,ltbx
aliessaescala,,"“The Hows of Us” is about a couple who have been together for years but are starting to feel the strain of chasing their own dreams while trying to keep their love alive. Watching this movie made me feel a lot of emotions—frustration, sadness, and even a bit of hope. It felt so real, like it was showing a love story that could easily happen to anyone. The idea of sacrificing for love, even when it seems like it’s not working anymore, is something deeply rooted in our culture. Filipinos often hold on to relationships, even when they get difficult, because we value family and long-term commitment so much.This movie made me reflect on love, sacrifice, and the idea that not all relationships are meant to last. Sometimes, people grow apart despite their best efforts, and that’s something everyone can relate to. It’s a bittersweet story, and it hits hard because it feels so familiar.",200.0,ltbx
colleenrecato,,"The film follows George and Primo, a couple who started with big dreams and promises but slowly fell apart due to unbalanced sacrifices and priorities. While the movie tries to capture the highs and lows of love, I didn’t like the way it was portrayed because there could have been a better way to show the struggles of a long-term relationship. Instead of making it about real growth and compromise, it felt like George was the only one making sacrifices while Primo kept making excuses.What made this film distinctly Filipino was how deeply rooted it was in the idea of perseverance in relationships. Many Filipinos are taught to hold on, to be patient, and to fix what is broken instead of walking away. George embodied this—she kept choosing Primo even when he continuously let her down. This is a common theme in hugot films: the painful reality that love alone is not enough.Kathryn Bernardo’s performance as George was incredibly raw and emotional. Her frustration and exhaustion felt so real, especially in that powerful confrontation scene. Meanwhile, Primo’s character was frustrating to watch—he was selfish, immature, and only realized his mistakes when it was almost too late. His actions throughout the film made it clear that George deserved better, and it was exhausting to see her continuously put up with him.One of the most heartbreaking moments in the movie was when George was on her way to take her board exam. She was already in the jeep, finally choosing herself and her future, but she still got off to check on Primo. That moment was painful to watch because it showed how much of herself she had given to him—even when she was about to take one of the most important exams of her life, she still prioritized him. It was frustrating, but it also reflected the reality of many relationships where one person keeps giving while the other keeps taking.Another scene that struck me was when George confronted Primo and said, “Kahit cupcake, hindi mo ako mabigyan.” That line wasn’t just about a cupcake—it was about all the little efforts that Primo never made, the small but meaningful ways he could have shown he cared but never did. It summed up how unreciprocated George’s love and sacrifices had been, and it was heartbreaking to see her reach her breaking point.Some people say romance films feel “sayang” when the leads don’t end up together, but I don’t think that’s always the case. In The Hows of Us, I honestly wouldn’t have minded if George had walked away for good. The emotional damage was already there, and she had given so much of herself without getting anything in return. While the film tries to redeem Primo in the end, it doesn’t erase the fact that George had to suffer before he even realized her worth. The story would have been just as powerful—if not more—if George had chosen herself instead.That being said, I also can’t blame George for acting the way she did. One thing I’ve learned and seen from people around me is that love isn’t universal—everyone experiences it differently. Love can be complex and complicated to the point that it doesn’t make sense to others anymore. Even though I think she deserved better, if she couldn’t see it, then there’s no point. It’s her love, her story, and her choice.This movie made me reflect on love and sacrifice. How much should someone give before realizing they’ve lost themselves? Does love always have to come with suffering? While the film gives hope in the end, it also makes you question whether some relationships are worth holding on to or if letting go is the better choice.",120.0,ltbx

Ang tanga lang ni Jo for giving up her dreams for a severely drunk Primo but, I would do the same if I were her. Ramdam na ramdam ko yung bawat emosyon sa lines nilang dalawa kaya napaisip ako na “Ah…baka ganito rin sila during that time.” Pero, sino ba ‘ko para magassume sa relasyon ng ibang tao? I relate both to Primo and George. One, being Primo—I saw myself in him as someone who is overly-passionate about what I really love but only to become an unexpected disappointment. Two, being George—George was a realistic character, who stayed, tried to understand the situation despite hindering her from furthering her dreams, still stayed, almost left, left the dream for a man, and left completely—but, she still pursued, hindi pa kasi masiyadong late para magsimula ulit—mahaba ang buhay, do and pursue what you really want to do.

They had different priorities but one lacked more and made it difficult to his partner. We used to fight like George and Primo. We would throw things, say things we dislike about each other; cried and despised but still gave us both plenty of chances. We took turns into staying in the living room whenever we fought and thinking about it now makes me laugh. We love each other on our best days and understand us more on our worst.

Jusko, akala ko naman kung anong method acting yung pinakita niya, he was just playing himself. For all i know, they had to add that rain scene kasi hindi siya makaiyak. Jusko, buhat na buhat ni Kath yung movie. ""Bakit, hindi ba ako box office king?"" Gets ko na yung sinasabi nila na kung wala yan siya sa KN, he wouldn't have been BOK. Tsaka bakit ang daming unnecessary characters and storyline just to make us empathize with the mc. Tapos yung revelation sa ending, wow I've never seen anything like that before. It actually took me to watch two whole movies, several skips and increasing the movie speed into 1.5x just to finish it.Naappreciate ko bigla yung acting ni Alden.

Don L,,On a Tuesday night where I can't go to sleep because it has been quite a day- I went to the Filipino channel and found this movie. I love romcoms with a happy outcome and this one suited me perfect. The love story is elevated above the usual plot although it relies on misunderstandings and withholding information to protect the other. The entire story pivots on a house as a base as an anchor for their love- yet the house provides a way to work out their conflict. I like it. The direction towards the end sort of pushes the audience to a different outlook but as delightful romcoms go- it will please the audience with a sigh- a good sigh and tears will flow. Shhhh- don't tell my wife I'm a softy.,80.0,rt
mannn n,,"very flawed, there are obvious problems like the pacing shifts a little bit at the end, few moments where you just think to yourself ""what tf is happening"" and few scenes that i think DID NOT have to be in the movie. but i would still recommend ppl to watch this bcz its in the better side of filipino movies.",70.0,rt
