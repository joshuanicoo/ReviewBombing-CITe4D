leianleian,2012-12-27 00:00:00.000,"Waste of everything watching this movie.: I never expect this movie to be good and one thing in mind, surely it is WORST. And wow! yes! yes! I did the right expectation on this movie.

There's no story at all its all time wasting moment,

i prefer to read the oldest newspaper than sitting in front of TV watching this crap.

But I cannot deny and I can't still imagine and can't still find the answer why this movie became the top grosser of all time.

Waste of everything watching this movie. Only kids can enjoy for those with have a very low humor.

I hope foreign people missed to see this garbage",10.0,imdb
sim-richmond,2012-09-29 00:00:00.000,"Good Comedy Movie: First of all, I would like to congratulate Star Cinema/ABS-CBN Film Productions and Viva Films for having Praybeyt Benjamin as one of the highest grossing Filipino film of all time.

The movie was quite hilarious and the storyline of having a gay soldier is a good idea, though not anymore unique. Nevertheless, what made it different from any other films with gay soldiers is that they mixed genres. They added a touch of science fiction (SciFi) and drama (Family Rivalry). And, thankfully, the romance they have put was only for the sake of comedy, and not being focused on the romance alone because if they did, it would appear mainstream which the Filipino taste is already burn of.

The camera rolling techniques that have been used was on average, and the CGIs appeared to be similar to that of old Filipino films (which I have to admit devastated me).

Heavy screen portrayal got no place in this kind of movie because it does not showcase heavy drama. However, I believe that some of the actors underacted making some scenes awkward and unnatural.

Overall, it reached 7/10.",70.0,imdb

lemisfitvee,2024-04-22 00:00:00.000,"With the announcement of Vice Ganda's new project with Jun Lana in the works, I thought I would revisit some of the films in his filmography and I gotta say, while Praybeyt Benjamin didn't exactly age all that well, it became the better Mulan live action we deserve lmao. I mean, imagine that. It has all of Wenn V. Deramas' stylings and add to that a fresh out of the gates of his success as a noontime host and celebrated comedian, getting the chance to helm his own movie, Vice Ganda shows up here with his signature comedic style. The only thing is, and my Dad has said this before and I agree, there's a Vice who gets directed to say jokes and there's a Vice who does adlibs and jokes impromptu that somehow shows a completely polarizing way you experience his comedy. Here, the gags and style were fresh for that time. His command of the camera feels special but it wore out at some point because I feel like Vice does well in situations in the moment not exactly prepared for him. I do have to say, in the moments that allow him to show vulnerability, I don't hate it, especially with the theme of ""a gay man having to play up being a brusque man in order to serve in the military"". Yes, the theme of why should it be any different for him to serve his country as a gay man than being the stereotypical cishet with big muscles? Sure, this feels like a propaganda film but if you're gonna serve your country , SERVE CUNT lmaoooooAnyway, it's still a shame that they didn't get Jimmy Santos in the second movie to play Benji's dad.

moviegrande,2015-01-25 00:00:00.000,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities. Directed by Wenn V. Deramas who pretty much pumps out films year after year of the same quality. To make everything clear, this is not a good movie but is enjoyable enough that its watchable at least. Vice Ganda who is funny in his Pinoy variety show ""Its Showtime"", is not as funny here, which I expected since the reason he's funny in his show is because its improv, but here it feels forced and plain corny. The thing about these movies that you know its bad but it has a sense that the people making it were just having the time of their lives. There are way more jokes that miss than hit but you can laugh at how bad a joke really is.Overall, This is regular pinoy fare that everyone gobbles up because 1.) its a comedy, 2.) Its all good vibes, and 3.) Vice Ganda is in it. Fun Fact: When this came out it was the highest grossing film of the Philippines, which really tells you a lot about the state of films in the Philippines.",50.0,ltbx
