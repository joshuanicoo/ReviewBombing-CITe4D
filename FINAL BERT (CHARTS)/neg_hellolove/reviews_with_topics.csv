1,"of course, it's not all bad as soon as you try to hold onto it, love ceases to be love filmed in hong kong, we're giving a stark and not so pleasing depiction of life for many immigrants struggling to survive some can't of course, the world, and even your own family will throw every reason at you to not pursue your dreams if you give in, you have no one to blame but yourself and because of this, the film loses a bit of its heart and depth can you imagine the lack of depth in a film like titanic if jack and rose only held hands and never shared a kiss",5
2,"initially i thought it was a chinese movie, but upon seeing the names of the cast, i looked on imdb and saw that it was a tagalog philippines movie and not a cantonese hong kong movie",0
3,there were exchanges that fell flat because either a it was poorly written or b both did not have the capacity to deliver them with the emotions needed,0
4,"it is not like any other of those filipino rom com, and drama movies you've seen before",0
7,"waste of time and money i was excited to watch the film due to the hype and some of my friends posting about it on social media however, i was very disappointed after watching the film as the acting from the lead actors including supporting cast appeared quite scripted and very awkward the story was predictable and recycled from previous films only thing i appreciate was the cinematography and soundtrack",0
10,"once you stop you'll starve therefore, when joy loses her job because her employers can no longer pay her, she takes an illegal waitressing job the filipino community in hong kong is small the problem is that she's leaving she's definitely leaving she has a nursing degree that she can't use in hong kong that's her dream, and nthing's going to change her mind she will not be swayed not now where do we need to place ourselves why so often, indeed, does every option, for women especially, seem irreconcilable talk about creating a debt for regret no sane person would endorse that the effect is otherworldly between the 3 productions, one wouldn't think it's the same place quote choice is only for the rich",5
12,not good not bad another kathryn same ol' tone of character film it could have been pushed a little bit more,0
17,"i don't know how a filipino girl reacts to such moves, but if people consider this as nakakakilig, there's a problem but cathy garcia molina's picture falls apart as the annoying, melodramatic score continues to play in the background, tackier drone shots are added, and more forced, hugot dialogues are delivered by the leads 'hello, love, goodbye' fails to offer something new to romance movies as an art form, which is disappointing since the ofw story and joy's arc have so much potential",0
21,not your ordinary love story,0
22,"the story has potential the film failed to deliver as far as the film's story goes, it has so much potential but the way cathy garcia molina presented the story was too mediocre their choice to cast alden and kathryn was bad there isn't any chemistry between them alden's character was unrefined his acting was subpar his smile is problematic instead of conveying something that relates to being hurt or having a struggle, it becomes out of place and sometimes creepy the camera shots were out of place it felt like the production team were trying to show off their drone shots even when it would have been better to just use a simple wide shot close ups were not utilized properly the script contained the typical hugot lines at the same time, the film contained at least 30 minutes of pure exposition it became a film of telling rather than showing but overall, the film was purely a waste of time",0
23,unexpectedly real oh they went deeeeeppp p s low key hong kong tourism ad done right,5
27,"boring the movie is a bit boring, a let down too many scenes with nothing happening and boring dialogue ain't diggin this shiz",0
28,"however, they sound a bit awkward when delivering lines in english language it would be better if the movie would be made subtle the way indie movies do",0
32,"and if you act like someone else's then you should give justice to it or do better and it's absolutely out of timing the lines are so bad that i can say i can write that yeah its that bad the songs doesnt go well with the scenes which completely ruined the greatness of the song they could have done it better cinematography is so bad, its like you're watching a tv series and cut next line the style of shots just changed in about 10 15mins remaining in the film it looked like they realized it and hired someone else",0
33,"the dissolution of every ofw workers success or possible demise not really a fan of alden richards, one may surmise that he was directed exceptionally well for this or was incidentally a victim of writing mediocrity in previous films baduy na kung baduy, but this is a movie you should watch",0
36,"here's my thought 1 it is a challenge and part if the process like any other movies, it is not perfect",0
44,bigat ba kat,2
51,bwisit ka ethan,2
56,super unnecessary ng sequel talaga,-1

59,nakakainis talaga si ethan sa totoo lang,1
67,hits different right after a hong kong trip haha,5
73,ang choice para lang sa may pera kathryn hard carry,-1
77,"actually, sobrang simple lang ng storya nito totoo talaga 'yung sinasabing minsan hindi nakakasawa ang isang kuwento kapag iniba mo ang setting naangasan kasi ako sa pagkakalatag ng mga karanasan ng mga ofw sa hong kong dito",1
78,"right love, wrong lifetime",4
79,hayzt alden iyot maine,2
81,it is the sad truth of the film,0
83,this is not a fairy tale,0
84,"ang choice, para lang sa may perasobrang unfair ng mundo kay joy hindi naman siya nagkulang sa katunayan sumobra pa nga sa pagmamahal, pag alala, pagtatrabaho, at marami pang iba pero mapait pa rin ang mundo sa kanya at lahat ng 'yon naranasan niya kasi wala siyang pera ang sad nung reflection ng reality ng buhay sa pilipinas na para bang hindi na option ang migrasyon kundi isang daan na kailangan mong gawin para umangat sa buhay wala siyang balak maghirap nang sobra ang heartbreaking lang nung fact na he had to experience the same experience twice putek graduate ako ng college, anong ginagawa ko naglilinis ng inidoro dito ako umiyak eh hahahaha ang sakit lang na kahit maraming propesiyonal sa pilipinas, mas marami pa ring pipiling mangibang bansa kahit hindi akma sa kursong tinapos at sana'y pina practice nila on different parts lang",-1
85,"ang pelikulang hello, love, goodbye ay isang nakakaantig na kwento tungkol sa pag ibig at mga sakripisyong ginawa para sa mga pangarap ang paggamit ng filipino sa mga emosyonal na eksena ay kapansin pansin sa pelikulang ito, na nagbigay ng mas malalim na koneksyon sa mga manonood gayunpaman, may ilang bahagi kung saan ang mga diyalogo ay may halong ingles, na bagama't nagbibigay ng makabagong tono, ay nakakabawas sa lalim ng mensahe sa wikang filipino",1
87,naa jd ingana nga laki no,2
88,"selfish na ba talagang piliin ko sarili ko ngayon hindi ka nagpatalo sa pag ibig, you were determined and had a clear goal in mind that is something not many can do",-1
92,"ang babae, pag bigay ng bigay, tanga pag inuuna ang sarili, masama so lahat ng ginawa ko para mahalin ka, lahat ng binibigay ko is not enough to make you stay boy pack it up lmfaoo ano ginawa mo para sakanya kundi magmahal lang at mangstalk putisnfina wala tangina talagaaa putanginaaaang mga lalake talagaaa hayop amputa bawat segundo kuhang kuha ni ethan inis ko like i cant even explain to wordssss wtffff never falling for the women suffering for loser broke bf trope,like puchaaa gurl si ethan nga ung controlling tas si joy pa yung selfish ha like wow wow wowpanget ung pelikula si kath lang maganda",1
93,iyak uli,2
94,sadly naiignore ng marami na ang hirap maging nursing graduate sa pinas,1
96,nakakatakot talagah pag nakikita nila future nila w u tapos parang settled nah sila tapos parang ma pressure kah kapag sinabi nah nila sayoh yon tapos di moh na alam gagawin kaya parang natatakot ka nah kasi paanoh naman yung binubuo mong future kung sila mismoh may nabuo nah kasama kah huhuhu,1
97,"some might take it as a selfish decision, when in reality, it is not sometimes, love alone can never be enough from the beginning, she was clear that shes not open to commitments, clear that shes leaving dahil ang pag ibig ay dapat na mapagpalaya, hindi isang pakikibaka at kailan man ay hindi magiging masama ang piliin ang sarili",4
100,tired of the trope bc god forbid a woman chase her dreams,4
103,"tangina sa lahat ng bullst love stories , wala akong aldan richards sa buhay ko the second movie doesnt exist",3
106,gets ko na bakit nagselos si daniel padilla,1
107,i really doubt this before watching kasi bago sa paningin like nasanay na akong kathniel lagi ang tandem pero nag try pa rin ako kasi why not,-1
109,mas corny,2
111,but there was so much in the buildup to it that kinda threw me off also i know this is standard star cinema stuff but the bg music was waaay overdone in this movie,0
112,"from having two or three jobs at once, may it be illegal or not, people marrying a native to gain residency joys mom , family back home asking for money without regard on how you are doing joys fam , being a domestic helper ofw is not for everyone maymay , etc i hate how people focus on the love story when this film has always been more than that",5
116,"ang babae, pag bigay nang bigay, tanga pag inuna naman ang sarili, masama paladesisyon mo ethan tangina tapos si joy pa yung selfish",1
123,"sabi nga nila, lason ang pag ibig para sa babaeng may pangarap",1
125,kisah diaspora dan pekerja keras menjalani cinta,5
126,"i know people cried over this, but i just felt emotionally manipulated the drama was heavy handed and exhausting it pretended to be deep while just being depressing a film that punishes you for watching",0
128,hindi ko maipaliwanag kung gaano ko kagusto ang palabas na to pa ulit ulit ko nang pinapanood pero hindi ako nagsasawa,1

147,wag na magmahal tangina nalang,-1
150,i think my main issue with this is the way the dialogues between the two leads were written i kept wincing in each unnatural and forced english line most of which would probably come across better if it was spoken in tagalog instead,0
151,"naunsa naman ni oyy, walay buot amahana, pero naaksidente man diay ni iyang papa, but that doesnt mean nga pwede nimo ipakasal imong asawa oy naunsa mana, huhuhu kapoya ani, sakitas dughan kung mahal mo, bakit pinapapili mo ako",1

231,"hong kong never looked this emotionally exhausting ofw stories are usually soaked in sacrifice, pero this one hits you with that emotional labor type of heartbreakthe kind that doesn't end with kami pa rin sa huli, but more like, minahal kita at 'yun na 'yun he brought soft boy energy with a sprinkle of gusto kita, pero hindi kita pipilitin that breakdown scene para sa mga nagmahal, nasaktan, pero hindi iniwan ang sarili",5

578,misericordia quanto sofrimento pt 1,2
579,"kadalasang problems for romance films is meron isa nasasapawan yung isa hindi yung nakadepende yung isa sa buong film iba talaga if non loveteam film naging strength ng film na di ginawang backdrop lang yung pagiging ofw for the sake of a love story im not a fan of love stories pero nakakakilig sila and at the same time you want to root for them pero hindi nakakalimutan na mature yung depiction sa ofws it showed the realities of underemployed ofws like maymay who graduated education pero di makaapply ng job sa hk and ended up as a dh it also includes yung labor exploitation and taking advantage ng mga kababayan natin physically and emotionally thats heartbreaking pero yun yung reality na naririnig ng ofws dito lumabas yung acting ni kath unlike barcelona a love untold, mas justified yung location hindi kagaya ng ibang films na basta nasa ibang bansa bentang benta sa akin yung mga lines niya lagi at least, may temporary escape and they can show sino sila despite yung laban nila sa life cons 1 it doesnt offer anything new sa plight ng ofws masyadong stereotypical yung lead characters just like any leading man, toxic and possesive si ethan the stalking ang cringe di siya nakakakilig even if his character redeemed himself di siya realistic they deserved better characters this film begs the question sa dynamics of the new trend of ofw although mentioned naman sa situation kay maricel laxa, but at least di ba sa generation nina kath masyadong forced yung ibang hugot and cheesy lines na malayo sa objective ng film to be realistic why do filipino films really dont invest sa soundtracks yung innocent version niya na akala niya basta graduate ng nursing it wouldve been transformational to see her growth na that kind of promise is not true yung scene ni maymay na nakarating sa hongkong sana lay kath yun yes it has benefits but...... nasaan yung representation ng pinay nurses who go to canada who take exams and assessments there were illogical and avoidable moments in the film running kahit sinabihan na stop, yung away sa bar 9 may characters na halatang siksik lang and unnecessary na makasama sila",3
580,"tanginang yan pag ganyan bf mo, mag tomboy ka na lang",1
582,ethan's an asshole,0
585,eto pa rin talaga kaysa dun sa sequel,1

589,mas ramdam ko pa din yung puso nitong film than the second tbh,3
591,i don't love you,-1
592,bro is creepy,-1
593,"accurate depiction of an ofw, as confirmed by my mother however, this is yet another movie where the girl chooses the guy over her dreams, and christ knows i can't deal with any more of that",0
597,rewatched this because of the netflix release of the sequel,0
601,this is like filipino la la land except no one sings and they only play two songs repeatedly throughout the entire movie,-1
602,we played it in 1 75 speed cause we were rushing so we didn't really felt the vibe,0
606,"this movie was out to ruin everyone emotionally, and it worked messy, heartbreaking, and painfully real",0
607,why did the camera guy never have a tripod this is filmed like a youtube video... also the script was corny,0
610,kairita character ni ethan pero parehas kaming engot pagdating sa love dept eh hajhaajaajajhajhjah masyadong mapagbigay,1
611,"bakit 'to ang pinanood sa baguio ,, the excitement sa paguwi from dinner para manood uli tapos the disappointment nang malamang sa thursday pa rerelease 'yung hla sa netflix",3
615,pag pinanood natin aba maganda naman talaga siya nasira to saken dahil sa sequel sana as is na lang pero sa totoo lang it does further prove na sobrang gago talaga si ethan nakakairita hindi alam kung anong ibig sabihin ng no,1
622,"hindi na bago sa filipino movie lagi ganito, especially sa romance filipino movie pero i can see naman bakit sya na hype, isa na toh sa movie na kinilig ako sa pure romance filipino movie na hindi ako na cringe, the story is typical but gosh kathryn is so pretty",3
623,so sad,6
624,i told myself that i wouldnt enjoy pinoy romcom pero tangina naman kinilig ako,1
625,"the right person, wrong time hits so hard, got me emotional fr",4

661,kuhang kuha pa rin ni ethan gigil k punyet hhhh,2
665,fuck ethan for literally trying to gaslight her to stay in hk,0
667,"really disappointed with this one for me this is yet again one of the most highly overrated filipino film mainly because it stars two very famous young talents of today there are times when the character's lines were too deep that it doesn't feel normal at all it's sad that her performance and alden's was not on the same level you can really feel that gap during the climax when they were throwing overly dramatic lines with each other it tried, and it did on the first half but ultimately it failed because that part was later merely used as a tool to make a different setting for a love story being a romantic movie, the film was not something worth remembering",0
670,ganto yung mga gusto ko yung masakit na ending wow,1
671,fuck ethan idc,0
675,tangina ni ethan,-1

715,i fucking hate ethan half a star bc ily joy,0
718,di ko tinapos kasi nabwiset ako kay alden,2
725,"the story n plot is great n all but i hate how alden richard's character is portrayed horrendously, and the amount of selfishness he has is honestly insane i hate the he used joys love as a way for her to be selfless because the world forbids a woman actually choosing herself for once instead of following certain stereotypes that a one time love can make u abandon all the hard work you've done",0
728,ethan natagpuang nakikipag sapakan sa pangarap ni joy,1
737,was the nail in the coffin for me bro,2
738,rewatch pero ang masasabi ko lang ay hindi na need ng sequel nito jusko,3
740,i don't love this stating with the film's inside joke,0

749,this shouldnt be this overdramatic,-1
750,pilipinas ang hirap mo naman kasi mahalin,1
760,"the life of an ofw is truly heartbreaking watching it for the second time hits differently while the story is heartbreaking, it still has those nakakakilig moments",0
761,pinapili ba naman pangarap mo para sa sarili o pagmamahal ang sakit,1
767,"ethan parang ang selfish naman nun i hate to admit it pero kinilig aku sakanila pero ethan in this scene, literal na wtf",-1
770,tanginang dimples yan magkano tf,1
771,i say i understand ethans character by the end but honestly i just hate him so much lol,0
772,napaka authentic at napakasakit ng mga paghihirap ng mga ofw or baka bias lang ako dahil sobrang agree ako sa desisyon ni joy sa huli,1
774,not it,2
778,i was screaming at his character the entire time lmfao,0
779,"kung mahal mo ako, bakit hindi ako ang piliin mo kung mahal mo ako, bakit pinapapili mo ako",1
780,absolutely no reason for this movie to punch me in the fucking face,0
785,hanggang sa kung saan ibigay ang panahon para mahalin natin ang isa't isa,1
786,so why go there,2
789,i genuinely hate him and he may be one of the worst male characters ive watched in a while,0

820,"may mga lugar na dinadaanan lang, parang baguio",1
822,bumili ako ng broccoli at pancit wala akong pakialam sa mga negative na review dahil nagiyak ako sa mga paghihirap ng pamilya ko,1
823,"pero sa kabilang banda, naging transaksyunal ang pag iibigan na halos ekstensyon lamang ito ng isang hookup ang konseptong sex lang ito ay pinahaba lamang hanggang sa takdang panahon ng pinagsisikapang paglisan ang lungkot ng mundong walang kasiguruhan sa batayang pangangailangan, sa mundo na una ang pagpapalago ng kapital bago ang kaligayahan ng mamamayan",1
824,hindi tayo mapapakain ng putanginang pagmamahal na yan,1
825,asan yung alden ko,-1
826,hnd ko pa nga matapos yung pelikula nakakainis tong buwisit na ethan i will not discount the struggles of filipino migrant workers but can we have some dignity and not shove this corny ass script onto some decent talent,5
828,this couldve been 45 mins shorter,0
831,the one liners are corny as hell,2
833,hit too close to home at the beginning,-1
834,"only gripe is the humor, majority of it, isnt my cup of tea unlike joy, i was conflicted a lot with his character and at times wasnt a fan of his actions",0
836,hindi ko naappreciate noon dahil hindi ko nakikita ang pinaghuhugutan ni joy,1
838,"with a runtime of two hours and two minutes, some parts are unnecessary and slow the overall development of the story",0

843,kung di rin lang ikaw was not funny,1
844,ilang beses ko na napanood to pero now lang tumagos sakin mga linyahan nila,1
845,alden richards leaves a trail of dead bodies every movie hes in,0
854,"i dont really watch pinoy romcoms but had to watch this one since a friend of mine will drag me to watch the sequel kathryn and alden are good actors, but the very reason i dont like watching filipino rom coms is the script it's just so cringe worthy, with the cheesiest lines way cheesier than western romcoms",0
856,"nanalo lang si maymay sa miss central, umuwi na sa pilipinas",1
858,unrealistic lang ba talaga yung lines o sadyang sobrang bitter ko lang fr ang trash ni ethan,1
859,"if you hold back, then why love at all love with an expiration date will always fuck me up",4
860,"rewatched this because i'm planning on watching the second film, and i need closure",0
863,not good for a hormonal teenage girl like me,-1
865,kinilig betlog ko,2

1228,te ano nangyari,2
1232,"still, it never seems to fully tap into this interesting premise, instead opting for star magic's signature and tired plot points also, cinematography here seemed super off i wonder what went wrong",0
1235,nakakatakot maging si joy and at the same gagawin ko rin yung ginawa nya kung sakali,1
1238,"hindi ba kayo na off dun sa isang scene yung umiiyak silang dalawa, pumipili si joy kung canada or si ethan pakyu mga lalake",1
1245,"better watch kapag alam mong wala na sila ng ex niya, e",3
1247,warning huwag panonoorin kapag kagagaling lang sa healthy one of us needs to improve ourself first breakup,-1
1249,"his backstory was such a missed opportunity to utilize as a guiding wisdom for joy while she navigates the complexities of her situation nabaliw sa pag ibig, na disappoint ang pamilya, and is now working to redeem himself it's a cathy molina film wherein stalking someone is apparently nakakakilig sayang lang talaga character narrative ni ethan",-1

1289,was too irritated to be sad during that fight that man needs therapy why would he say that to her,4
1294,yawa yawa yawa,2
1295,unearthed trauma,-1
1298,si korni,2
1302,"my biggest gripe with the movie is that joy's decision to move to canada is unrelated to her familial dilemma she was going to leave regardless, and the revelation of the truth to her did not make her decision to leave any harder but it gets old, and it gets predictable the emotional anchor of the movie just didn't work for me because i know there's no question that she'll leave and it's getting old fast also, the unrelenting stalker like behavior really does sour alden's character and i find it weird that the script is spear headed by at least 2 women",0

1474,not much of a fan bc there were too many plot holes which i think can be cleared up in a second movie aldens character wasnt good tbh i kinda hated him throughout the movie bc it was giving insecure male who cant let his girl flourish as an individual nakakasakalvibes but his character development towards the end was better,0

1583,cant let anyone know i somehow fw this,-1
1584,"as much as i disliked aldens character and his acting still, i am quite mixed on several aspects of the film to bring forward a topic such as that in a mainstream film is a nice change of pace however, it is instantly forgotten about and left unexplored by the second half the dialogue is a little too on the nose at times as well, which can make some scenes feel a little superficial please get rid of full english dialogue between our pure filipino leads, please, unless absolutely necessary in which case, it wasn't in terms of cinematography, i found it to be on and off why is he just so good at everything, even in playing an annoying character other aspects are quite weak god, i'm sorry, but i couldn't stand alden's acting , and perhaps a slightly different ending would have sufficed, yet by the end of it, it didn't feel poorly made for the sake of profit ns voice again 2 3 years p",0

1597,"but director cathy garcia molina defecates those usual star cinema formulaic shit that stinks the middle part of the storytoo bad but director cathy garcia molina poops many formulaic star cinema shit ruining the film hello love goodbye works only at its first hour and its last 15 minutes of the film no time for joy, no time for love, no time to enjoy our current disposition now any naive sexualized young male filipino doing a daniel padilla or alden richards to a kathryn bernardo is a crime punishable by fines or at worst, jail time no wonder daniel padilla never passionately supports hello love goodbye until the second half came which quickly abandons this great promising story for direk cathy garcia molina to poop to us the standard star cinema formulaic shit that stinks already am really expecting the real plot to unravel on the second half however, i got appalled when hello love goodbye suddenly shifts into your typical standard shitty star cinema family romcom formula that is so uncalled for this really ruined the movie nabitin na, nagoyo pa tayo sa hello love goodbye na ito unnecessary kilig moments, 2 blatant over exposure of unnecessary supporting charactrers3 resulting to a big pile of mainstream star cinema shit taking over the 2nd half of the film the star cinema formulaic shit forced upon on the 2nd part of hello, love, goodbye feels like a typical shitty star cinema story of its own therefore, hello, love, goodbye never continues, never finishes and cuts short its real and promising ofw story that it masterfully sets up at the start but not hello love goodbye instead, this star cinema formula injected at the middle part of hello, love, goodbye causes a sudden change of the story, making me feel that i am not watching the continuation of its promising first half which is too bad and very disappointing it is really stupid for star cinema ever since to forcibly insert that singular usual repetitive worn out family romcom formula on most star cinema movies of varying stories so stupid indeed while this worn out formula works on some films, it fails miserably and ruins so many star cinema films instead, we get to watch another typical star cinema formulaic romantic shit which should not be part of the real story maymay entrata is so underutilized alden richards as ethan's family should never be one of the main focus of the film those kilig scenes are so forced upon alden richards and kathryn bernardo too bad these bloated 2nd half of hello love goodbye gives us unnecessary shit while depriving us of the real stakes of the story that really matter with this, the film really falters but it is too late a big void is left on the 2nd half of the film which fails to bear fruit the promising ofw story that the film first introduces to us hello, love, goodbye is really a missed opportunity for star cinema star cinema chose to inject the usual mainstream formulaic shit that really leaves a void on the potentially inspiring ofw story which really shortchanges the audience outright too bad direk cathy garcia molina fails to handle alden richards's good talent well in the film as she foolishly swings his character from a free spirited sex crazed playboy into a more serious yet passionate romantic the hows of us may not be a great film some scenes before that mid scene and the later scenes after are somewhat unnecessary and could be shit hello, love, goodbye is the opposite however, the middle second half of the film suddenly turns to shit which irreversibly damaged the integrity of the entire story and film finally, i also complain on how hello, love, goodbye visually depicts the beautiful hong kong the unusually bright lighting on various hong kong settings are slightly irritating to the eyes i can't really determine if hello, love, goodbye has poor cinematography or direk cathy molina intends to have this visual flaw on purpose to support the real theme message of the film",-1
1600,"but they labor under a system that seems intent on limiting them to do so is illegal that's a lot less interesting, even though there are aspects to ethan's story that are kind of intriguing as well the film bends its story around the fate of their relationship, and it isn't quite able to make it feel weighty enough to stand up to the larger issues that the characters are facing",0
1602,sadly i cant call it bad,6
1603,"alam niyo yung damit niyo na bagong bili na kapag unang suot pa lang, parang uncomfortable pa",1
1605,"ang aligaga acting meme, not my brand may off lang sa barkadahan ng guys this time around sorry ryzza mae pero di ako naiyak",1
1606,"this is a film i normally dont go for i felt i wasnt mentally ready for that haha was it cheesy sometimes overly romantic life is unfair it also didnt present perfect characters, which is rare for a filipino mainstream romance movie this one had messy people",0
1609,"all or nothing sabi nga niya pero aside from that, yung hirap ng ofw talaga is yung central theme ng kwento yung pangarap mo versus pangarap mo para sa pamilya mo yung paano ka ba pipili sa ganun yung sitwasyon mo na wala ka naman choice",1
1610,"however, when ethan played by alden richards comes into the picture, this premise suddenly shatters, bringing back the movie to its commercial origin it is here, in the halfway of the movie, where it fails to function as a compelling narrative piece take for example the wattpad ish treatment of ethan s character, the way he is perceived as a playboy and later on revealed that he s not so bad after all because of previous traumas he had encountered, the cringey mix of english and tagalog to try to create remarkable lines, inserting some product brands into the movie that never really contributes to the story, using some irrelevant sequences and drone shots that make the film look weird and the quality subpar, and most importantly the redundant score that s being played using different instruments to create a grandiose melodrama just like every cathy garcia molina film truth be told, there s really nothing that is compelling in the film s second part it all looks like a really long pantomime with kung di rin lang ikaw as background this is somehow opposite to richards past roles which never fails to use tears and eye acting as tools for storytelling in the end, it feels like alden is only a supporting character in this movie sometimes it also shines as a narrative piece while the next second, it reeks of shit however, it does not consistently makes use of that potential, and most of the time it acts like one of those commercial films in the market settles for the mediocre, and the audience appeal while sacrificing good storytelling",0
1612,"isang ehemplo ang hello, love, goodbye na pedeng tibagin ang mga nakasanayan na nating tambalan, ipares sa iba pang tao, at pede pa ring makaramdam ng saya at kilig habang pinapanood sila may kakaibang timpla ang tambalang alden at kathryn na hindi nakakasawang panuorin",1

1618,she gave a monster of a performance,-1
1619,"obviously not the director's best well anyway, i expected so much from this movie and from cathy garcia molina siguro yun yung kaya feeling ko ang anticlimactic ng film na to di ko alam kung di ko lang talaga trip yung mga cliche na stuff pero, hindi ako nahook sa dialogue at may mga eksena na parang cringe fest lang yung iba lang naman may mga eksena pa din na napatawa ako, dahil kayla kakai hindi lang siguro ito nadeliver ng maayos sa receiving end ko kaya ako nadisappoint",3

1621,"tbh, thank god na hindi si dj ang gumanap na kapartner ni kathryn dito yung dilemma ng pagpasok sa ldr, kuhang kuha yung hirap ng mga ofw, ganon yon",1
1622,"my primary issue with filipino romance films is the direction the romance will take when the leads are faced with a dilemma sometimes the ending could be a cop out, instead of letting it naturally play out",0
1623,"akala ko i won't hold on to alden's character parang nung una kasi it didn't match him but to my surprise, his character grew",0
1624,it is not a pabebe romcom film it is not a puro hugot lines and heartbreaking songs film,0

1632,i expected for an ugly cry based on the reviews of my friends,-1
1638,this film will forever be associated with a severe headache,0
1639,on the other hand was just oof i know he was playing this fuccboi type of guy but it just comes out as forced and cringe worthy sometimes it makes me sad because joy's story here was strong and ethan's but it gets too focused on the melodramatic scenes and alden's hugot lines that it puts the film way down this was just a miscast,0
1641,and looks different as welk,2
1642,"di naman ako ofw pero nakakalungkot lang na delayed ang pangarap natin para sa pamilya, para sa mga mahal natin sa buhay napaka importante rin talaga na piliin mo muna sarili mo dahil kung hindi, you will lose yourself along the way ang hirap",1

1660,sinong humagulgol sa sinehan hint eh di ako,2
1662,"but the film is too self aware, relying too much on its tension points to hold up a flimsy love story between two people whose reasons for loving each other, you dont even get",0
1663,"wrongly marketed as a romantic comedy when it had so much to say about family, self worth, and ofw caregiver culture",0

1686,ang choice ay para lang sa may pera ramdam at amoy mo yung hongkong,-1
1688,"bold of this movie to assume it had anything new or fresh to say about ofws, or to even pepper in a bland a romance between two leads with no chemistry",0
1692,puta gets naman na kailangan magpakilig sa mainstream audience at ipakita na pursigido yung character nya pero ang labas lang ay mababaw ang pag intindi nya sa mga problema ni joy see that one particular scene kainis kasi kinilig pa rin ako tho huhu aldeeeen,-1
1693,"kaso sobrang feel ko na restricted ni kathryn at alden sa isat isa lalo pa nagcamera tricks lang sa kiss minsan tuloy nakulangan ako sa sparks nung dalawa, kulang sa connection pero hindi naman talaga yung love story part yung nagdala sa movie e, kundi yung mga simpleng patawa, struggles sa pamilya, iyak nung tatay nang makita bunso niya lalo ako naiyak sa parte na yan , atbp para kasing minsan pilit acting niya, di katulad ni alden, natural lang andun na din yung flaws, tulad ng may mga scenes na alam mong may mas magandang scenario para dun sa gusto nilang mesaage na ipahatid also yung mga unrealistic na linyahan sana mas ginalingan yung script imbes na cheesy at hindi tagos sa puso pero favorite part ko, of course, yung ending, sobrang uncertain ng life",1

1718,mumblecore drama shows how capitalism crushes peoples agency,0
1721,"text messages even if joy has rejected it so many times i dont know how a filipino girl reacts to such moves, but if people consider this as nakakakilig, theres a problem but cathy garcia molinas picture falls apart as the annoying, melodramatic score continues to play in the background, tackier drone shots are added, and more forced, hugot dialogues are delivered by the leads hello, love, goodbye fails to offer something new to romance movies as an art form, and it is disappointing since the ofw story and joys arc have so much potential",0

1734,"1 is it does not know what it is, is it a movie about the struggles of an ofw or a romance film lastly, the supporting characters are floating, they have nothing to do in this film, they are flat and one dimensional, the actors and actresses of those supporting characters disappointed me because none of them stepped out of their comfort zone in acting",0
1735,"its heartbreaking, how the movie tells how selfless ofws are",0
1741,"i cant be like this i cant be watching filipino romcoms anymore getting me to believe this bullshit so kilig so kilig i ended up almost crying nanndjjsjsjsjs hit shes dating the gangster, miss my exes and whys what the fuck cgm fucking luvd it merely thinking abt my exes and whys makes me furious less misogyny at the beginning i was almost at the beginning bc we waited like 6 years or smth holy fuck but then it didnt happen and the rest of the film carried on w their non pda ways and i was disappointed again fight me but here but ya kno im fucking back on my bullshit ps everyonw in my family always says i look like kathryn bernardo and i deadass do not see it at all like literally 0 like there were a few times furing this film whrnbi thought do i look like that",0
1742,ang husay lang niya dito,1
1743,"there was some well put stuff in this, like kathryn's character and the dh in hk representation sprinkled with sunday beauty queen references , but i just felt so so uninterested watching this alden's character is unlikable and even his redemption story arc doesn't make up for his witless appearances in the first half he just shows up, gives some forced cheesy one liners and smiles",0
1744,"and for alden, medyo cringe pero as the movie goes ma rerealize mo na may effect pala yung personality niya na ganun sa story",-1
1745,"labas 'to sa formulaic love stories ng star cinema, andun pa rin ang pattern pero sa wakas mas naging matalino at praktikal yung bidahigit rin nga sa love story' to e",3

1759,"if you've seen la la land, this is essentially the same thing but with ofws, unrealistic dialogue and zero appreciation for music lmao see 4 2 are you fucking kidding me why the fuck would you screen a feature film in this manner tfw 0 of the jokes landed4 absolutely horrendous use of music it's as if the filmmakers were abusing this butchered rendition of december avenue's kung 'di rin lang ikaw multiple times to forcibly draw an emotional response from the viewer i now fucking hate that song alden richard's character is retarded sorry for the term his backstory and motivations are dull and straight up dense borderline predictable imo, it looked like the film was exploiting handicap people making actors play handicapped characters to evoke sympathy from the audience fuck off in hong kong and yet it looked even more horrible ano ba ang problemaaaaa tayo lang ata ang bansa na pinapapangit ang international locations same problem with alone together manhattan looked like a shithole 9",0
1762,kung mahal mo ako bakit mo ako pinipili,1
1763,film theory found dead in a ditch grand gestures in films are really alarming kaya maraming hindi mature sa relationships kasi panay ganito sa romance genre tapos pinapapili agad people just always fucks up in relationships coz nobody would teach people how to properly draw the line,0
1766,could have worked better as a life story more than a love story,0
1769,la la land filipino version,-1
1770,pass tho,2
1773,a big filipino movie that doesn't romanticize and chooses to portray toxic or unhealthy relationships that actually portrays the woman choosing herself,0

1782,runtime's lesser than two hours but it slowed in the last act maybe the pacing is off,0

1787,"he nearly scared the heck out of joy wtf haha, many people might kill me after this",0
1788,ethan theres no joy in canada me watching this in canada giggles im offended,-1
1790,i feel like there was a lot of cliched lines and a few questionable plot lines like the schedule of kathryn's chracter and questionable wealth or lackof alden's character,0
1791,"cheesy, overly scored, family subplots everywhere, melodrama, characters saying lines because theyre lines",0
1792,got bored while watching it hahaha,0
1793,"as usual, star cinema is tireless in rendering their love stories with tiresome, relentless overscoring god, can i just have at least 10 seconds of scene without any score or soundtrack i was surprised he can actually act i mean she tries, but she tries too hard because it feels like the roles are always too big for her like in barcelona",0
1795,nothing that high of a point,2

1807,di ko inexpect na may igagaling pa pala sya,2
1808,"sobrang good job sakin yung pagkakagawa ng movie kasi hindi sya narrative hindi sya yung typical na romantic films lang kasi meron syang substance and hindi sya puro landi lang time kailangan nating pagkatiwalaan yan hindi lang sa love or career pasok ito sa lahat ng aspeto ng buhay plans hindi porket plinano mo eh yun na yun, based sa experience ko ayoko na talagang nagplaplano or nasasalita ng tapos kasi hindi ko sya napapanindigan sa totoo lang, and dahil dun natutunan kung maging versatile and flexible sa life dapat open tayo sa possibilities and mga pwedeng mangyari mapa negative or positive man yan nabigyan nya talaga ng emphasis na kahit ano at sino kapa pamilya mo lang sasalo sayo at the end of the day",3
1809,no one stays in hk forever,5
1811,see rod tumbaga's review of this film,0
1814,alden was so manipulative and creepy in the first part of the movie i didnt understand why they fell in love no kilig would be better if they focused on that aspect,0
1816,"i was almost ending this year without watching a filipino film which is pretty embarrassing because im a filipina i love you all, pero 'tangina sabihin nyo ng ambisyosa ako, pero mas mataas dito ang pangarap ko",0
1818,not quite sold on the love story but i shed a little tear for joy anyway,0
1821,"there were also bad moments a lot of typical annoying acting from their friends, the why does ethan keep on touching his cap scene, the second half almost drowned with score after score, the stalker ish first half, the drone shots gosh, and that awkward final all english moment before joy left",0
1823,felt kind of emotionally detached from this movie,0
1830,"you said you've seen the whole trailer, but i just saw the 30 seconds snippet we could have made it work, but we didn't i told you that love alone or our affections and words will never amount to the future of us i can't blame your premature promises and affirmations, but i should have known better i was inconsiderate at times come back",0
1831,"i didnt think much of it at first and expects it to be just another hugot film one, the setting was in hong kong her decision especially on the climax point of the movie hurt but it is inevitable",0
1832,"tagos sa kaluluwa yung mga titig ni joy, hindi ko mapigilan maguilty sa mga pagkakataong napapagod at tinatamad ako",1
1834,"etong movie na to kakaiba para sakin hindi magsama magmahal or pumasok sa loob ng isang relationship, kasi kung tanggap ka or kung kayo, kayo talaga kahit anong mangyari kasi karamihan ngayon well hindi ko nilalahat pero karamihan satin mamamayan ganon ang ngyayari mas pinipili ang love kasi natatakot tayong minsan harapin ang laki ng mundo, diba sabi ni kathryn ang laki ng mundo, nakakatakot it means there will be more challenges for us to face pero ang sabi ni alden, kaya mo yan",3
1835,"particular fondness for cacai bautista's line 'pag ang babae binigay lahat, tanga 'pag pinili sarili, masama san ba talaga kami lulugar, ate vi",1
1839,"hello, love , goodbyesebuah film drama percintaan berlatar perjuangan hidup sebagai perantau di film ini digambarkan bahwa untuk mencapai mimpi harus melalui jalan yang belum tentu mudah dan menyenangkan atau kita sukai selain itu terkadang jalan yang harus ditempuh tidak sesuai dengan rencana dan keinginan kita kita juga akan dihadapi pilihan yang mungkin tidak mudah untuk memutuskannya dari segi cerita saya menyukainya, tidak terlalu opera sabun saya menyukai endingnya",0
1840,"or the time when i ate in jollibee central and the filipina working the register was cursing the hong konger manager bc he was being a dick and started slamming shit when all she did was ask if something was still available they were closing in an hour , saying parang wala kang nanay tanga tanga naman nito ni ethan charotttt may character development naman",-1
1842,generic story that really just used domestic helpers as a plot device wasnt impressed by alden,0

1854,better to be underemployed in another country than in the philippines,5
1857,weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee baket ba kasi kailangan gawin love story nakakatanga,1
1858,"i mean it is soooooooooo predictable from the start, this scenario of a love story was already even told from a local tv series but it's a shorter version of it hell, i can't even remember the title of that series anymore",0
1859,"i still cringe the cheesy lines, the usual family conflicts in star cinema's films and the overdone scoring",0
1860,i don't love you what could've been a typical star cinema rom com turns out as a less typical one there are cheesy tropes that are in the same realm and this is far from an indie rom com spectacle,0
1861,"tentang pergumulan hidup, tentang mengejar impian dan tentang cinta dunia tak sekadar hitam dan putih bagi para pekerja migran filipina di hongkong, ada segala kerumitannya di sana",5
1868,"2018's 'the how's of us' which starred daniel padilla and kathryn bernardo may have worked for some, but to others, it all still felt trite and stale as that still felt like a star vehicle than a supposedly enthralling story centric piece about young romance",0
1869,"mahusay din si kathyrn bernardo, na nagdala ng buong pelikula",-1
1870,"dan, lagu2 pinoy kok enak2 banget siiih",-1

1878,at first i thought it will be cliche love story,0
1880,"well, i don't love you",-1
1881,nakakakilig din dahil swak ang chemistry nila kathryn bernardo at alden richards nagulat ako na kasama sa pelikula si maricel laxa bilang ina ni joy,1

1891,hahaha tanginathis has a lot of good things going for it pero pls ang corny ng dialogue its like a collection of twitter hugot lines,1

1916,"my only major issue is a lot of scenes repeat the same story beats its arguably comical for characters to have the same arguments over and over, but it stagnated portions of the story",0
1918,sa lahat ng panahon na umaasa akong hindi magiging corny mga pelikula ni kathryn kasi magaling siya tas recently ang dami niyang pagkakataon sa mga pelikulang lumaki bilang artista pero grabe di talaga nagpapatalo si cathy garcia molina anyway,1
1922,wala ko masyado pake ewan ko ba,1
1924,i just didn't really like how problematic alden is here,0
1926,"as a woman, i hate the fact that body shaming was absorbed into a couple of jokes during some scenes, notably miss central 2019 we need to stop praising men for doing the bare minimum and stop romanticising creepy, forced love lines",0
1929,not typical love story film,0
1930,unfortunately closer to what i thought it would be than what i hoped it would be,0
1931,"sometimes, rewatching a film you loved in the first time you saw it can be a bad idea i like this film a bit less now after a re watch the problems in the screenplay is much more evident this time, i disliked alden's character a lot more, and the film depends on the scoring wayyy too much",0
1933,"despite enjoying this film, parang may off sa pacing i can't believe hindi ko 'to na review noon, pero ito yung last movie na pinanuod ko with my ex while she was in another row scam",3
1935,"the movie never outright asks you for sympathy instead, it paints an honest picture of things as they are for so many ofws in hong kong",5
1937,"i mean, this is clearly just another trite and sappy romantic comedy drama, of little consequence and even less surprise, with a runtime of two hours lasaten's score sucks, and it's just about omnipresent throughout an authentically paced drama to bring out the inauthenticity of its melodramatic situations, frilly farce and general genericism the script doesn't help with its quirky sense of humor and hearty or histrionic breakthroughs, all cheapening substance that is just full enough to water down that punch up that script may only feel obligated to pander to the lowest common denominator, but it sits between the tritest of romantic melodramedies and the most cloying of aesthetics but just to be safe, let's overshoot the environment, overwork the editors, and overplay an oppressively corny score this takes the time to build a genuine human drama, but it's squandered on meager fluff",0
1938,"film berbahasa tagalog pertama yang kutonton gak berasa seaneh bahasa thailand lah suka banget setup ceritanya masalah imigrasi, keluarga tenaga kerja asing yang hampir mirip dengan cerita cerita di indonesia juga mungkin gak seromantis itu lah, tapi sedihnya dan penderitaannya memang nyata",-1
1943,"this is a movie that normalizes and romanticizes harassment, gaslighting, and manipulation and justifies it by having the antagonist having had his heart broken by another woman too so its misogynist as well all of that is ignored for a mediocre love story that doesnt add anything to the genre nor give a good example of what being in a relationship should be",0
1948,"it stripped the usual hongkong image as a vacation destination by using the dh life montage as a background how the bagong bayani suffers, not just from homesickness, but from social inequities",5

1951,bakit di na siya ganung kasakit the second time around hmp,1
1956,alden had the makings of a horror movie creep,0
1958,this is an extremely biased review as i am a kathryn bernardo stan first and a human being second,-1
1960,"kung magtutunog bitter man ako, yun ay hindi dahil fan ako ng kathniel o ng aldub i hate filipino loveteams pero wala lang talaga silang chemistry",1
1961,"it had the most noisy and annoying sidekicks ever i especially dislike one of the lady friends the one with the thick visayan accent but it was not funny it was extremely annoying no real visayan talks like that he works in a tv network that i hate, so ive never really seen him act that much i know it now he has a very shallow, barely there philtrum star cinema can do better",0
1963,"i prepared myself for everything but disappointment scene ethan, on the other hand, was a bad character and richards was not able to make it any better i hated how they had to used anak to emphasize the struggles of ofws it just went a little overboard tinabi tabi ko pa for a special time, hindi naman pala as good as how its promoted",0
1966,its so hard to accept that we filipino's are being discriminated the way it was,5
1967,"saw this twice idk sorry i don't care for your character, alden lmao",0

1970,joy shoulda left his ass,0
1974,take a shot every time they play kung di rin lang ikaw,1

1976,mas nasho showcase talaga yung talents ng mga actors na 'to kapag iba na yung kasama nila sa screen tsaka nakakasawa na rin panoorin yung same actors with the same typical filipino rom com plot need din nila na i expand yung range nila at hindi lang mag stick sa isang love interest,3
1977,"some things i disliked are the introduction of the brother and how their struggle was executed, the sudden fat jokes, and i feel like the dialogues weren't as effective as it could have been",0
1978,rewatched it because it's finally out on netflix,0
1980,"'pag ang babae, binigay ang lahat, tanga 'pag pinili ang sarili, masama love is all or nothing, if you hold back, bakit ka pa nagmahal",1
1982,"life in hong kong is not easy more so for the domestic helpers who are unable to improve their lives even if they wanted to however, we felt that the film failed to establish more emotions on this introspective",5
1985,idk her,2
1988,"the film had a lot of technical flaws and passe comedy injected into it fat jokes in 2019 the only real gripe i have against this film is how severely underdeveloped ethan's character was he didn't deserve the quotation markable dialogue in the end, because he learned so little even when the lesson was staring right at him",0
1990,alden too carried for some parts but then again i can't say that much for a character i didn't like the plot about ofws hurts because it's honest but the way it's written is loose especially ethan's backstory cannot pity a guy like him they had a chance na rin naman to showcase hong kong as a place na shithole for domestic helpers or a tourist area pero parang di ko naman masyado nakita sa film screw the drone shots as well i speak in taglish rin naman but their dialogues are really fictional because if you talk like that in real life then i am actually judging you sorry to the music director but i will not feel anything kapag nilapatan niyo ng overplayed song yan why can't we just compose new soundtracks for new films,0
1992,"no offense to alden richards but full offense to the writers, the movie lost me the moment ethan's creepy and pushy ass showed up",0
1993,"two stars para sa acting ni kathryn na bumuhat ng pelikula at para sa chemistry nina kathryn at alden masyadong in your face yung music di siya nakakadagdag sa eksena, nakakadistract pa lalo not a fan of the drone shots cheap tingnan corny ng script buti okay bumato ng linya si kathryn but not even that can hide the fact na hindi maganda yung script yung character ni alden only works in movies that's a creep irl uhh wala akong nakuhang value sa mga eksena kasama ng mga kaibigan niya kakai, maymay, etc or baka di lang kasi maganda yung script at yung oa na acting nila balikan ko lang ulit yung music",-1
1997,"just the right amount of kilig, pero mas marami yung naramdamang sakit lalo na kapag wala ka nang choice",1
1998,"that was my biggest issue with cathy grace molinas previous film, the hows of us resolving all conflicts in order to reach a happy ending that feels fake make no mistake, this film is also boggled down by the same trite and cheesy writing making kaths and aldens character an official couple is so forced , overblown musical score, and emotionally manipulative sequences that have plagued the quality of star cinema films for the past few years",0
1999,this narrative hits too close to home,-1
2000,it could've been better if they focused more on the struggles of an ofw than the romance department i got touched on some scenes but the romance thing made me cringe,0

2018,"kaya lang 1 mali yung pag set up ng character ni alden wala ba talagang ibang way maliban sa maging creepily persistent yung lalake tanginang moira at december avenue yan bakit nginungudngod sa mukha yung music sobrang mediocre ng execution ng final scenes ilang taon na bang director si cathy garcia molina at bakit ganyan mag execute genuinely surprised sa acting ni alden, kala ko pacute lang pero tangina andun na yung material nagflop pa",-1

2024,ethan epal,2
2026,"ano, di ko masyadong enjoy yung batuhan ng linya saka, parang pakiramdam ko nags spoken word poetry na sila bigla tapos sa dulo nag panatang makabayan pero dahil magjowa sila, panatang makabebe choice is illusory when we contextualize the hardships of our kababayans state agencies concerned with the filipino migrant workers remain bureaucratic and capitalistic overworked nurses, tapos underpaid",5
2028,seriously cannot get over how bad the coloring on this is and how awkwardly most lines are delivered,-1
2032,"kaso bakit softboi si alden dito his backstory and lines weren't doing it for me, but i guess they gotta work with what they were given",0
2033,slightly annoyed with their i love you i dont love you back and forth at the start,-1

2051,kesambet apaan gua kontol bisa nonton ftv ala pinoy macam ini,2
2052,"the time stops when you don't use it the chemistry was there, but it didn't really hold up in the long run i also have to acknowledge how problematic the start of their romance was moreover, the film still succumbs to cliched tropes we usually encounter in filipino romantic films, not to mention the terrible use of music just to evoke emotions that would only work for, dare i say it, wild fans how it treated the romance aspect was decent at best, but its establishment damaged the film tremendously gosh, it could have been so much better, really",0
2054,"never really liked mainstream filipino romance movies kasi i find some scenes too cheesy although may mga cheesy scenes din 'to, siguro naging totoo pa din siya sa gusto niyang maging ending i'm glad na 'di ginawang malungkot 'yung ending by making them break up for good but instead na open pa din silang magkita...",0

2066,paano na yung nanay niya nabugbog na lang what's with the straight english dialogue,-1
2067,"heartbreaking, due to the fact that the main characters' choices are true to what has been established about who they are as people also, there was absolutely no narrative need to bring back tanya in person, but casting medina who can not even deliver her lines decently made the mistake seem more egregious",0
2069,it is definitely not your typical star formulaic cinema movie,0
2070,"its impossible not because it's a bad movie, but because it's so depressing its so bleak their lives are so unpleasant both are overseas filipino workers stuck in immigration traps in hong kong, forced to submit to exploitation in order to retain proper status one especially tragic scene has a filipino who's working as a nanny beg her employer to keep her on at half pay because losing the job means getting deported back to the philippines the driving force of the movie is essentially how these punitive immigration rules ruin their chance at true love and happiness",5

2654,"pinanood ko to dahil akala ko wong kar wai vibes wrong car bai pala tojokes aside this shit is garbage, first five minutes palang walang kwenta na dialog the fact our ethics prof made us watch this tells us all you need to know about her, pati yung ibang recommendations niya basura",1
2655,nag aaral lang naman ako e nananakit parin e,1
2657,"been so long since the last time i watched this, ngayon ko lang narealize kung gaano ka corny si alden dito",3
2658,"well anyways, i need to stop undermining filipino movies for having bad dialogue and pacing among other things, and peppering hugot lines here snd there for the huyy moment",0
2659,ang choice ay para lang sa may pera,-1
2660,"only the first half being ph's highest grossing movie ever, i've given myself the expectations of this being quite the questionable, predictable, formulaic, cheesy, on the nose, and all the more problematic typical romantic flick that this was reviewed to be, and ended up being",0
2664,and the fact na ethan pangalan ng ex ko does not help at all kaya putangina moka ethan ang mema ng drone shots tbh,1
2670,mga lalaki talaga pabigat,-1
2671,"still dont understand how mainstream filipino films have a common fetish of basing an entire film abroad without illuminating its sociopolitical and cultural nuances can plots please have another personality besides relishing in xenocentrism i enjoyed how they showed the plight of domestic helpers in hong kong, but the machismo of aldens character and the dry jokes rendered it an unenjoyable watch the score was incredibly tacky",0
2672,"first half was cringy, 2nd was egh pahingi po ng ethan",-1
2680,sakit niyo na,-1
2682,"nung nag umpisa nang ngumiti si mareng joy dahil sa mga katarantaduhan ni ethan, alam kong delikado na ang sister ko eh",1
2683,friends are so wrong for making me watch this at this period of my life,0
2685,"but unlike the hows of us , it didn't hit hard enough and the writing sometimes feels formulaic, making the characters stereotypical but this film isn't memorable or impactful enough, making this just another romantic drama film for the masses the drone shots were bad looked like an amateur student film",0
2688,i need a better ending,0
2690,walang magsasawa dito,2
2694,bro is so toxic,2
2695,pinanood ko lang to dahil wala na kathniel,1
2696,"what bothered me were two things 1 chemistry is lackluster, i hate to admit it but i don't feel for them as a couple here is a technical thing but i was bothered how this was filmed all throughout in 16 9 ratio i feel like it diminished the scenic appreciation for the location which is hong kong did it waste my time",0
2697,sorry i can only watch filipino films rn,0
2699,kung di rin taayo sa huli aawatin ang sarili na makita kang muli,1

2705,tho di ko siya ma watch ng maayos dahil bawat eksena inuutusan ako,3
2706,bat palaging may nginunguya si alden,-1
2707,one of my complaints would be the cheesy dialogue that kinda felt unnatural,0
2712,ouch but at least pinili ni kathryn sarili niya also aldens character was so pushy ugh,0
2716,need ba dapat problematic lagi yung guy character if starring si kathryn,0
2719,the way this was so ate coded,2
2720,"wtf ang toxic ng character ni alden tsaka yung totoo, 2 kanta lang budget buong movie",3
2731,"because this features a lovesick, toxic, sadboi",-1
2736,bat ba lahat na lang ng characters ni kath may toxic na partner,-1
2738,di mabantot tignan si alden kaso yung lines nya nagpabantot sa kanya,1
2739,pangit ng lines ni alden,-1
2741,ewan ang sadboi naman ni alden d2 bakit hindi mo inisip ano gusto ni joy baka hindi ako ang target audience pero ion get it,1
2745,dalang dala ni kath,2
2747,mga lalaki talaga di ko to na appreciate kasi ang pangit ng quality nong pinanood ko pero ngayon shet ang ganda pala,1
2748,mas mabuting huwag na siyang umasa na babalik siya useless man,1
2749,"most other films bend over backwards to provide easy answers, but this movie doesn't discontentment and resentment fester in each of the lead's personal lives in ways that don't always go away so easily and yet not all solutions come clean",0
2751,creepy shit men following you in a foreign country,-1
2752,"dumb title, fun movie",0

2758,"'pag ang babae binigay ang lahat, tanga 'pag pinili naman ang sarili, masama saan ba talaga kami lulugar",1
2760,"hmmmm ang panget ng kulay, ang mediocre ng shots, parang sinayang lang din hk na location tapos sana kung kukuha ng aktor na may working class role, wag sana yung may english accent pa yung filipino jameson blake i expected better since eto yung highest grossing film sa pilipinas pero mga pangalan lang naman pala nagdala as usual",3
2766,hindi funny na ginawang joke lang ng character ni alden yung pananakot sa character ni kath dun sa part ng habulan sa intro...that mustve been so traumatizing for joy,-1
2767,men are trash and alden's character proved it,0
2770,"right person, not enough time",4

2778,just another example of men who dont listen... he annoyed me so much assdghjijppkkhl cant believe this is the highest grossest movie in the philippines too the romantic plot had no substance address the root causes of forced migration from the philippines,0
2779,me personally di ako makakapag move on nyan,-1
2781,napanood ko rin after 4 years totoong nakakabwiset si alden sa una talaga dahil sobrang stalker vibes pero hindi ba nagbago naman huhuhuh pati ang galing niya rin umacting infer naman pero shet k kath tlg so much,1
2783,maybe im biased other notes minsan gusto ko na lang maging selfish at iwanan lahat ng responsibilidad ko nagagalit ako kasi parang wala akong choice,1
2784,it wasnt traditional filipino movie,0
2786,"pag inuna naman sarili, masama",1
2788,watched it after 4 yrs that was a moment of weakness,0
2790,then i resorted to crying a river afterwards,6

2792,"this movie will be removed tomorrow from netflix, so i decided to watch it one last time",0
2795,tangina k ethan paladesisyon amp plinano na lahat without consulting joy nanawag pang selfish nung tumanggi siya stfu,1
2796,"however, the love story is not attractive to me",0
2797,"even the opening seen, of her running away from authorities because she took an under the table job exposes the difficult reality of dh workers as they strive to make ends meet for their families back home she unable to pick her up on time",5
2802,feeling ko pinanood to ni mareng taylor tapos sinulat niya yung midnight rain,1
2804,"ang panget nung location nung bar ni ethan, nasa 10th floor pano bababa mga lasing niyang costumer this is just a lawsuit in the making",1
2806,"napansin kong di lang si alden yung problema, kasi naibibigay naman talaga ni kathryn yung performance, yung pagkakasulat lang talaga",1

2852,dalawa lang ang kailangan para i rate ko to nang mas mababa 1 kung naging kathniel movie to 2 if joy stayeddadagdagan ko tong review pag may time ako kase ma y gagawin pa pala ako,3
2854,it even question the problems of labor export policy and the lack of opportunities and failed social services in the country alden's role fell short from the very beginning and we are left with no assurance of his character development,0

2892,"made me cry, was trying to avoid this film but ended up watching it hindi lang siya basta love story, e it speaks about the poor, kung paanong kakaunti lang ang opportunities para saatin, kung bakit kailangan ganon kahirap bago makayanang iangat ang pamilya mo na ang dali dali lang para sa mayayaman na kahit anong hirap mo, kung mahirap ka, talo ka",3

2916,don't you trust me what if i shot a bullet thru my skull,-1
2918,"that fatphobic joke from joross gamboas character... seriously, was that really necessary there are so many disabled characters they didnt serve any crucial purpose apart from highlighting the difficulties in joy and ethans lives i get that the director may have wanted to portray them as weakened, but frankly, having both of them disabled felt forced also, the portrayal of annies disability is stereotypical as other reviewers have said, aldens character ethan is a big red flag also, he was creepy in the beginning he gave off stalker vibes... while many of the dialogues were well written, some felt stiff and forced mary dales disappearance subplot was unnecessary it came out of nowhere and lasted only for a while, which undercut the emotions",0
2919,"on first viewing, i thought it was overrated i get the hype because of the director and the cast, but it was cheesy, corny, and irritating to watch",0
2920,"sorry, i don't love 'hello, love, goodbye' because of 1 the story talagang ramdam mo at maiiyak ka pag ginamit na nang pambansang bae ang mga mata niya but if i were to nitpick, it would be that the hugot lines were too many masakit sa puso pero ma so sorry, i don't love this movie because",-1

2944,uuuggghhhh taena this hits too close to home,-1
2945,"overwrought emotions, situations with dire circumstances played to dramatic background music, a reluctant at first romance, and so on some of this works, i think a romance needs some high stakes and emotionality, some of it falls flat however and doesn't work",0
2949,tangina ng dimple mo alden,1
2952,di sana sila ganyan kung di sila panganay,1
2956,"siguro dahil sa sobrang hirap pagbigyan ang sarili na magmahal at paglaanan ng oras ang ibang tao, nakakahanap pa rin sila ng butas na pagdadaluyan ng romantikong pag ibig at grabeng sakripisyo iyon sa mga titig at mata mata acting din talaga ako nadala, e",1
