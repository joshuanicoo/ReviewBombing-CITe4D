0,this is the truth this documentary perfectly captured the experiences of the marcos and the exploited people,0
1,"it's a shocking tale of shameless corruption nepotism cronyism and greed, at the end of which one can only feel saddened for the filipino people, who have been used abused lied to and robbed over decades by their elite, and still are sadly all of that now seems to have been forgotten",0
2,"privilege matters, political horror it's about a narcissistic self serving former first lady abusing her position",0
3,the carnage left behind from this disgusting dynasty is there for all to see today in the form of vastly stunted economic growth down to the billions of dollars embezzled by these creatures,0
4,real life political horror horrifically illustrates how a nation's collective memory can be erased in real time and the true limits of democracy in the social media age imelda comes across as a complete psychopath with absolutely no perception of reality,0
5,the maker of the documentary is very one sided and has little knowledge of the local culture this is of course very irritating anyone wiht any knowledge about that culture should know how stupid the maker of this docu is,0
6,the contrasting images presented by greenfield is a great divider between perception and reality,0
7,7 10,1
9,like her or loathe her you can't deny the blatant pesos for politics watching marcos hand out wads of cash to kids in a hospital ward in front of the cameras was as cynical as it was sickening,0
11,"perception is real, and the truth is not , she states as a matter of fact hmmm, where have we heard this elsewhere in recent times",3
15,one of those docs that start out one way and slowly reveal another darker side,1
16,"it's not a surprise that the marcoses is paving the way for their return to power this movie's purpose is to reclaim the narrative that the martial law is the golden age of the philippine politics but it sure as hell backfire to them personally, growing up i love reading especially history about philippines so its not a surprise to me that the marcos regime is bad but this information is inaccessible to everyone unless you specifically look for it and the gov't provided textbooks is riddled with wrong information",0
17,this documentary is a pearl,0
18,marcos regime the darkest in philippines history my opinion the marcoses siphoned and plundered the country's fund and imelda is convicted with graft and corruption but she wasn't jailed because sadly that's how the justice system works for the powerful,0
20,corruption unraveled the marcos regime is one of the most corrupt in the history of philippine politics,0
21,"these narcissists are totally out of touch with reality, the ends totally justifies the means",0
25,it is infuriating that we let this family erase their atrocities of the past,0
26,"the filipinos are stupid we are stupid the way our own people fought this stupidity, just for it to come back is literally a hard shit bomb dropping over us",0
27,"perception is real, the truth is not how can you call someone a mother who thinks that hurting one is a form of love how can be a supposedly loving mother be so cruel until today, the historical revisionism, distortion, denialism, and misinformation ran rampant but before you can look above the stars, you must open your eyes with the real truth initially below your radar",3
30,"random rewatch di ko rin lam baket can i ask for another ballot i messed up i shaded two presidents obob we don't know what to do, actually you can't run to the police, it's the police that's doing it fuck the police thru and thru kahit kamaganak pa kita since duterte cannot govern democratically, he has to create an enemy to justify the use of force garapon ka nang uuwi sa pinas pakyu",0
33,tangina talaga,1
34,"but i cant shake the feeling that if we rely solely on films to revive fear of past atrocities, the effect may actually backfire throwing all the past horrors...",0
35,"never again, never forget",6
36,no sympathy should be given to political dynasties that have only contributed to the pain and suffering of our people i will not have another marcos and duterte who will make our country a polarizing laughing stock sana mali kami,0
37,file under crime,0
38,classic cancer behavior,-1
39,napaghahalataang mukhang pera si tanga martial law,1
41,"nov 2025 edit changed my rating to lower it a political documentary like this cannot be viewed superficially regardless how good the production value is, we shouldn't give platform to the marcoses for them to tell more lies to our faces additionally, it doesn't sit well with me how foreigners seem to feature one of the darkest moments in our country's history as just another interesting subject for a documentary especially when this was shot and released during the marcoses' return to power they stole from the country, and tortured and killed thousands of people",0
45,"it deeply frustrates me that people arent as angry as they ought to be towards the marcos family literal piles of documents and other forms of evidence, yet nothing has been done its even worse when people say phrases such as god will judge the marcoses when their time comes why cant we enact justice while they are still around but i feel that this documentary was hesitant in really digging into the nasty details",0
48,it makes me sad knowing that the country is literally repeating history because people haven't learned from the mistakes of the past because it isn't taught and propaganda is powerful it also makes me sad to see the parallels between the us and the philippines in this regard like we know that already but yeah it's just gross this was filmed before bongbong became president and it warns us that it's coming and it's frustrating and infuriating but she's an abusive mother she doesn't care about the needs of her children it's disgusting to think about the wealth disparity and the pain that some of these people have brought on the country,0
50,"perception is real, the truth is noti watched this documentary way back on december 25, 2022the same year when ferdinand marcos jr every word that comes out of this womans mouth is either a lie, arrogance, delusion, or fabrication its ironic that they gave her the benefit of the doubt, but it turns out to be a reason for us to hate her even more as the saying goes, you can catch a fish by its mouthand in this case, her words alone expose how filthy, hideous, and wicked she is shes delusional youre not motheringimelda, youre manipulating that picasso painting cameo it would send you to a coma just imagine how much money they stole, all because she wanted her life to be imeldefic",0

78,"was interested in physics, math, and biology, but my grandfather told him, theres no money in that switch to politics instead these lines, coming straight from their fucking mouths, make my blood boil ang kakapal ng mga mukha they never wanted to serve the people they shouldve been killed but as painful as it is to admit, the real enemy of the filipino people is often their fellow filipinos we keep electing the same shameless, thieving animals who plunder the nations coffers without remorse we never learn its the same cycle, over and over again we should never have been kind to the marcoses, because they were never kind to the filipino people",0
81,i cant believe i actually know people who still shamelessly support these out of touch fuckers,2
83,dumbass shaded two presidents in the ballot,0
84,"perception is real and the truth is not, words from a woman who was essentially the face of the darkest moments in filipino history in recent months, the philippines has been marred by controversies involving ghost projects and corrupt officials yet, after speaking with many people about this matter, one question always prevails how how did the corruption, plunder, and blatant theft from the filipino people become so severe upon watching this, the answer became clear as day it is because we allowed those who started the problem to get away with it the marcoses became the blueprint of philippine corruption today to fix this issue, we must first hold accountable those who began it in the first place democracy no longer truly exists in the philippines, for it has long been the government against the people ever since the marcoses were allowed back into the political landscape forgetting the past horrors, terrors, and sins has only allowed history to repeat itself a nation cannot be built in a day, and solutions to systemic issues will never materialize in just a few years",0
85,ube ube ube,1

549,neveragain neverforget,6
551,"it seems that her perception is real and the truth is fake line is taken as a sign of delusion and not a look into her and the marcoses strategy to rebrand themselves identity politics is the worst thing to come out of liberal media representation politics discoursei feel that the marcoses and other bureaucrat capitalists are given as much if not more time onscreen compared to the everyday people who were interviewed, so there isnt much insight into the impacts of the political corruption on the lives of the people of the philippines never again to martial law",0

867,"perception is real, and the truth is not the kingmaker interviews marcos at length, only for it to become clear that she is a greedy liar seeking to play the victim their inability to solve the problems are shown by the film's eventual focus on the resurgence of the marcos family and their proxy candidate, the evil rodrigo duterte it is a sad and scary time for the philippines and really this story is still breaking",0
868,"a real disappointment where the queen of versailles provided a real examination of its subjects, set against the backdrop of the financial crisis, this film throws its hands up at meaningful probing and morphs into a filmed wikipedia article",0
870,there are some major issues with the film itself i can't be sure but it feels like laura greenfield went in expecting to just do a bio expose on imelda but then got ensnared in the insanity of 2016 national election the movie struggles with mission creep the last 30 minutes depicting the results of that surprising election unfold at breakneck speeds that barely hang together and then at the end require a long series of title cards,0
871,waah modiji waah,1
874,this loses focus like two thirds of the way through,1
875,low 3 i sadly have not seen any of her previous work i also had no idea what this was about i seriously hate movies like this because it reminds me just how little i know of the world don't know anything about the philippines even but i found this to be pretty confusing i just mean the way the story was laid out the audience reaction to certain things was different to mine as well which added to my confusion i don't know for me i just didn't really like the way this was laid out it painted her as a great lady then out of no where we were supposed to hate this family then they would explain why but during the conversation she did actually speak to that so what do you do when you have a subject that lies also there was a part where they were interviewing someone about something really dark and personal and before they finished talking cut to another interview about the same topic and that really threw me i didn't like that i would have preferred to hear one at a time especially about something so sad i just feel like things weren't explained as good as i would have liked felt like it just touched the surface and seriously animal island broke my heart,0
876,wish this was the work of fiction and not a documentary,0
877,damn how much money does this old lady have in her purse oh no burn the rich,0
881,"perception is real, the truth is not",3

912,"la historia que presenta es bastante escabrosa y terrorifica el que imelda marcos se haya prestado para este documental solo me da a pensar que tiene problemas mentales, no habia manera alguna de que su persona pudiera salir bien librada de esto",0
914,it was a case filled with fraud and speculation on how this couple was making their money yet a lack of solid evidence to support that whatever it was they were doing was unjust,0
915,so well put together that it makes you hate yourself for having laughed at the beginning,0
921,i had no info about it when i entered the theatre,0

925,one of those docs that start out one way and slowly reveal another darker side,1
928,"the worst kind of villains are the villains who believe that they are doing the right thing it is clear from this brutally honest documentary that she truly believed she was incapable of doing no wrong i can only do my part to try and fight the cynical thoughts in my head saying we have always been corrupt there is nothing we can do , that is just how things are done",0
929,the second half of the film morphs into act of killing territory and the testimony of victims of the marcos dictatorship cause the mask to slip her attempts to propel her david brent like son to power likewise move from mildly pathetic to deeply troubling,0
932,"excepcional documentario que retrata de maneira implacavel a corrupcao politica nas filipinas, valendo se da confianca de imelda marcos, que se expoe e se entrega sem demonstrar que percebe a natureza hedionda de sua figura e de sua familia fala do passado recente das filipinas, mas poderia perfeitamente estar falando do brasil",0

936,if this doesn't leave you angry then you haven't been paying attention,0
937,there are lots of reasons to dislike duterte this just looked kinda slimy and i felt like i spent 15 to watch a political commercial 1 2 stars out of 5,0
939,this is the story of how marcos money has thoroughly corrupted the philippines it's about the con job the marcos clan pulled and continue to pull on the people of the philippines they even convinced some proles that seven years of martial law were the good old days when the country thrived,0
942,extremely depressing reminder that democracy and dictatorship are not incompatible,0
943,"i knew nothing about this subject matter going in other than a vague philippines human rights abuse idea, and i kinda had my shit rocked",0

964,"the documentary makes some unfortunate choices it is chilling, heartbreaking, infuriating, and makes it clear that despite greenfield's documentary covering well treaded ground, the message bears repeating",0
967,"im so tired of living in the reality that the kingmaker portrays i fear that all they do is validate my political opinion and those who need to see it either wont get to or wont believe what its trying to convey im writing this to remember as the credits rolled in the screening i went to, people cried out in the darkness of the theater, chanting what we usually say when were protesting in the streets never again, never again never again to martial law",0
968,"infuriating and frustrating to watch how this same story played out twice in our lifetimes which is useless also, how was it possible that after edsa revolution and two aquino presidencies that there is still no memorial or museum detailing the atrocities of martial law this is why we always forget how do we not have any why do we go to theme parks for field trips instead of a martial law museum sad thing is, its too late now not going to happen with the current government, after what weve seen in the kingmaker",0

974,ampanget ng the kingmaker as in yung kingmaker ng dalawang tyrant diyan,1
976,"disappointed by how unfocused, muddled, and close to the surface this is despite its incredible amount of access to its subjects still worth checking out for anyone without any knowledge of the situation with the marcoses, but it mostly left me frustrated how little new came through with this documentary oh the potential of all the great films that could have come out of those 500 hours of footage",0
977,very obviously made by someone from the west,1
978,ang kasaysayan dapat parang screenplay ni darryl yap hindi nire revise,1
979,and let me just say categorically that it's not what she says it is that's a missed opportunity,-1
980,"parang iba yung isusuot kong hat as someone na nanunuod ng pelikula vs citizen ng pinasas pelikula, mas absurd naman kasi yung day to day pilipinas kesa sa docu kahit feel ng docu na na uunravel niya for us yung absurdity di naman, sawa na nga tayo achuli so sa aspetong yun, ok naman, but di siya as freshpero sa other hat, wala naman na rin tayong fresh symbols or moments na makakaignite ng something kung ano man yung something na iyon na hindi ito na naman naguusap mga tao after screening napaalala sa atin ang mga bagay na hindi naman natin nakalimutan, pero isinantabi",1

989,never again,5
990,"strangely enough, the section that made it most interesting for me is what probably made it a weaker documentary why was there no coverage of the convictions in international courts why was there no definite statement about the guilt of this woman what i want to see is an outright condemnation of this woman, because she deserves nothing less",0
992,is imelda delusional criticism ko lang ay dilawan yung perspective nyahaha,1
993,"nevermind, i want to see her be burned alive",0
994,"initial disbelief mixed with a touch of amused mocking scorn, before the prickling sense of unease and ultimate bone chilling realisation that this is our reality now and these people, the worst of humanity, utterly devoid of self reflection, empathy, intelligence or decency, really are running the world",0
995,"the kingmaker or the court's foolsome people say there shouldn't be any platform anymore that would let imelda marcos speak anything that seems to come out of her mouth serves no higher purpose than to arouse her narcissism as nothing she says adds any real value to what we already know squeezing a reasonable statement from her is futile no seriously, let me explain for a second, i was suspicious about the prospect of this film hellbent on being pro imelda propaganda by then you ask, is this reviewer full of himself none of this is a laughing matter and so i answer, comedy here is so intentional, you must have been an idiot or a hardcore marcos fanatic to miss it greenwood's editing in the kingmaker is so deliberate in making its subject ridiculous there are times when scenes should've ended, but then she decides to linger into awkward pauses restrained because they are positioned in instances where the situation programmed you to feel something else i sure wish the documentary went in this direction completely and at this point, the film starts to falter greenwood's fault is that she tried to inject a little bit of everything in the narrative of the kingmaker hence making the documentary boggled and frustratingly on the fence which did happen for some appalling reason by then you ask, is a mockumentary more susceptible to misinterpretation and so i stubbornly answer, shut up but you could still accuse the documentary for being pandering to liberals which it didn't, as things arguably went worse the documentary has an oversimplified black and white approach to the subject it tackles that could be a disservice to the complexities of our history, a possible by product of greenfield being an outsider no one laughed then i laughed because no one laughed",0
996,"burn them all, i say burn them all",2
997,"wanted to punch a wall after this screening, sorry upfithis is just an absurd movie absurdity at its finest, the point where absurdity meets the post truth society myths politicize us, they rob us of political judgement",0

1010,i'm still angry so this might not be as objective is still not held responsible for their numerous crimes to the state it's about how this government continually oppresses its people for the sake of vanity and greed,0
1012,"funny how imelda wants to be sympathized with, but everything presented here is overwhelming against her i would like to but i cant go there when duterte and marcos are in power, fuck that",0
1015,"when it becomes clear that a big portion of the money that they have was stolen, that was basically the final nail in the coffin of the docs case against the family this kind of disillusionment, or whatever refusal to accept the truth that imelda marcos displays throughout the film and throughout her campaigning with bongbong is frightening burn them down",0
1017,way of out touch and huge delusions of grandeur,0

1154,"i think the film's structure is its biggest obstacle not presenting the film mainly in chronological order hurts the storytelling in my opinion i never really fully grasped the politics of the country based on this documentary the film kind of jumps around too much to paint a full picture of what was happening to the filipino people perhaps the most egregious part of the film comes at the end titles we spend a lot of time with leni roberdo who ran against bongbong marcos for vice presdient , but then learn she suddenly have all of these charges against her by a suspect president why even bother including it she remains one of the most infamous people of the late 20th century but i'm not sure that this film ever allows the viewer to fully know her",0

1217,"we should never give her access to any platform whatsoever, because it's just another opportunity for her to spout her lies, all shrouded under the guise of her being this doddering old woman with strange philosophies about beauty and mothering the film does actively undercut the things that she's saying, but it's an extra step the film tries to be clever with its juxtapositions, but the end effect is that it still gives voice to the lies, still allows a truly evil person to revise history it opens up the possibility of accusations of bias, and letting them play the victim yet again when all they've ever done is victimize the filipino they stole from the country, and tortured and killed thousands of people",0
1218,"my blood is boiling with rage at the injustice of it all shame on the marcoses for throwing this country into active disarray fuck this family and fuck you, sandro, for being a glorified idiot",0
1220,"neutrality is a problematic angle when trying to create a documentary showing the political history of a country the marcoses should never have been given a platform that can make them spread more lies and instill their false ideologies of beauty and justice which always aims to trample on the powerless they continue to blind the people of the reality and blur the visions of those who have hope to still see the atrocities of their conjugal dictatorship it may have shown the two sides of history but it never settled how the imeldific way of politics makes the poor poorer and the rich richer it is like a pros and cons table where you always need to see that the marcoses have done something right when in fact, they never did",0
1223,that lady is cold hearted,0

1248,the bitch is a pro at propaganda,0
1250,"so when imelda is framed as a kingmaker for supporting duterte, among other reasons , it fails to capture the frustrating circularity of philippine politics the kingmaker disappoints inasmuch as it glosses over the political context imelda thrives in and one that placed her back in power for an unrepentant and corrupt political figure that has never been held to account, you cant go soft you go all out",0
1252,ka agit marcoses pero gurl noynoy wala kang ascendancy remind ko lang,1
1253,"perception is real, the truth is not somehow, i don't believe her basically, she begins the film as a clown, a totally ridiculous figure ripe for mockery not knowing the extent of her vileness, i assumed that this was a documentary about how a country was damaged through incompetence but then we hear about how she imported all these exotic animals to an island, only to abandon the project after the animals proved to be more trouble than they were worth but the film does succeed at painting a portrait of wealthy insanity, damningly well in fact, its no longer there",0
1256,"perception is real, and the truth is not i wish more time had been spent on martial law and her money laundering there are so many things in the past that we should forget in fact, it's no longer there",0

1258,needed to take more of a stance,-1
1260,may be underrating it because of how upset i was after watching this,0
1262,"anything asian really, perhaps because of the lack of representation and i notice there really arent many documentaries available about the philippines major lack of representation, being that were all over america and the world ahem ahem is this due to propaganda is it fake news is this just one side of the story many people say that the aquinos were no different in their corruption imelda was excessive, the philippines is an impoverished country, and the citizens are broken its chilling to think that america could one day follow in the dark past of the philippines but the fight seems never ending alas, as long as there is corruption in government, the power will stay with the rich",0

1273,burn the fucking rich,2
1275,perception is real the truth is not,3
1276,what's with this portrayal as filipinos being marcos sympathizers,0
1277,why did they wait until the second half of the film to detail just how bad the marcos regime was,0
1282,"the marcos family itself is just full of heinous characters it's the tale of the marcos family starting something extremely extravagant, funding it well, then dropping it the ignoring of the animals mirrors the ignoring of the people in the marcos regime and the refusal to own up and help in any real, tangible, way money to beggars on the street will not make up for the years of martial law and tactics used to whitewash history in the favor of marcos i think there are some occasions where this feels like it can drag, and by the end of the film it almost feels like an entirely different film than the start i think that was intentional, but at times it almost seems to lose its own train of thought",0
1285,why do we filipinos easily forgive and forget,0
1286,fuck the marcoses,2
1287,a horror movie,0
1289,"en kvinna som lart sig dra the victim card och the woman card masterligt har inte ett problem med att hon far huvudroll i dokumentaren mycket politiskt fulspel, pengar som kan kopa inflytande osv inget nytt under solen direkt, men excentrisk packetering for att na ut med ett meddelande, pa sa vis se den, bilda egen uppfattning losa tankar varfor har de sa amerikansk dialekt av engelska",0

1297,this human piece of garbage doesn't deserve a documentary as grand as this one she is a horrible person and the whole world should know the crimes that her family is still committing in the philippines,0

1315,this is just giving her another platform for historical revisionism and her family's attempts to get back to malacanang can we focus more on the fact that she's officially been convicted guilty of graft and corruption like where tf was that,0
1316,"the kingmaker is woefully short and doesn't really break any new ground when it comes to telling the marcos story if the goal is to make their transgressions known more, i doubt it'll work because you can't convince the pro marcos dds guys to listen to anything that slights their idols if you want to correct how the youth perceives martial law then that's the institutions fault, not a documentary's job alleged clairvoyant of the pandemic with a bill she filed once but never bothered to follow through you can at least correct the people who believe that",0
1317,like really look don't be fooled by their words never again,-1
1319,"the film's tagline uses imelda's own words that perception is real, and the truth is not if ever she believes her own lies or lies to the heart to get away with guilt, the truth is that almost everything she started failed to prosper in the long run it's a reflection of both past wrongs that her family did and the present wrongs that filipinos are experiencing with its modern politicians it's a warning sign that we really need to remember the sins of the past and that our forgiving nature as a populace is our own undoing in the long run",0
1320,i will never forgive themher style is unmatched tho but she is entirely delusional,0

1331,"the kingmaker me parece su mejor trabajo, como una cronica plagada de corrupcion y despotismo este documental formo parte de la seleccion de ambulante en casa",0
1332,she states that she is disgusted with how the government and philippines is now however she is completely delusional as she doesnt realize that her and her family has contributed to how the philippines is no longer paradise i wondered why no one in the philippines has made something like this is it because we are scared of the consequences is it because it would be full of bias,0
1333,fuck u marcoses,4

1339,what a delusional woman family,0
1341,"this could have almost been a tv series rather than a film, very long and hard to follow in areas as someone that had no idea of the background, this was political drama at its finest and almost seemed too warped to be real not sure how ethical it is to give her a platform like this though, even if it is a negative one",0
1343,it pained me to watch this horrid woman continue to speak lies and make light of the multitude of crimes committed against the filipino people by her and her husband and their regime fuck them,0
1345,"honestly, this is such a multi layered subject matter that it should have been a big 5 to 10 episode project, as this one only scratches the surface one of the main faults is that it only tries to throw bad light at the marcos family when the entire system is dirty someone should make a proper non biased portrait of the political climate in the country, for it's an absurd observation of lazy corruption and intrigue",0
1347,"and when you lose your money youryour mother, you lose everything",-1
1349,"the marcos regime has remain to be the most controversial administration in the philippines as per the records of anti corruption agencies, their family has been accused of corruption, violation of human rights, and just recently, perpetration of fake news corruption is heavily evident and prevalent in the country from the local sectors to the national government, it is known to be the root cause of poverty, crime and poor education system during the marcos administration, it has been reported that the amount of their so called ill gotten wealth amount to billions worth of us dollars opposition groups were silenced, and the media was shutdown the agencies that are tasked to investigate their family failed to bring them to court and make them admit to their blatant wrongdoings, which is saddening on my end as its been ages since the bloody dictatorship took place in 2016, bong bong marcos, ran for the elections to become vice president but was greeted by a narrow defeat by leni robredo since then, he has been attempting to prove that the incumbent vp cheated the elections and thwarted his ascendancy to the position for their contrasting political parties based on the data gathered from cambridge analytica, president duterte and bong bong marcos are the biggest users of trolls for spreading fake news particularly on facebook in the philippines never again to martial law never again to the dreary cycle of fraudulent conduct, abuse of power, and proliferation of revisionists that are bound to resurface as these unlawful acts are deeply ingrained in their name political dynasties ruin the foundation of governance and neglect the needs of the filipino citizens in favor of their personal interests thus, the only way to elude the same fate is to hold the perpetrators accountable and never ever elect them again",0

1360,more concerning yet is the police brutality the documentary shows has returned in duterte's presidency it is sad that the blatant stealing of a nation's wealth has led a family to preventing the social or political evolution of said nation,0

1420,quick anecdote,0
1421,few minutes in and im already fuming mad imelda marcos wasnt what we meant when we said powerful women smh pa void po,0
1422,"it's quite suspicious how this film is framed it got so tied up to that idea that once they discovered that she's nothing but a depthless, condescending woman, it tried to do damage control by interviewing real victims instead it wants to be colored using the feministic lens that it failed to deliver that there are also women who cultivate and enable murderers in her words, perception is real, and the truth is not her audacity to say that truth is subjective takes me to my wit's end if i don't tell you right now ma'am the only blessing you've received is having a mouth and you've already sinned the moment you opened it putangina mo sagad the one that has been going on for years it was unfair to give this woman a spotlight she doesn't deserve to be on camera at all it's time that we burn her along with her 3,000 pair of shoes",0

1426,"marcosneverahero neverforget neveragaineat the fucking rich it merely shown how people, especially journalists, went through hell during martial law what the fuck the only good thing about this film is how it linked duterte's presidency to the exhumation of marcoses' power in the country that's the only good shit about the movie but over all, it's disgusting as hell",0
1427,"they abuse social media to spread lies, use smear campaigns to get back their political power, kill power, oust people who intervene in their plans the list of vile crimes is endless 000 people killed thd most vile betrayal is the political ruse of letting the people believe that duterte is a better option than imelda marcos hence he kills people duterte even abolishes the pcgg, the committee which works towards getting all the money stolen by marcos the leader of the pcgg is charged with corruption and fraud at present, duterte has imprisoned most people who oppose marcos so the evil of the marcos family is about start all over again",0
1430,"the first half i was screaming at the screen, the second half i was in tears",0

1442,"even for international audiences, its still questionable that this woman be given a platform to speak no matter how tongue in cheek its presentation aims to be",0
1443,"regardless of one's political views, everyone needs to watch this because it's dangerous to live believing that perception is real, and the truth is not",3
1444,"backstabbing is irrelevant in my country as these politicians outrightly plunder from their own people filipinos are groaning and moaning since the spanish rule, but to have this injustice come from your own countrymen is truly disgusting and with these heads, a neck kept on and keeps on turning these heads to serve their own selfish purpose a truly scary state for an already aching country, a disease stricken country and without recognition from its own members, it will persist, continually making the whole country sick and killing its people one by one until there are no more filipinos worth dying for and whenever i encounter patients who i know have a lower chance of survival, wherein limitations of science and the practice of medicine are fully exhausted, it eats me to the core the same feeling of hopelessness is what i feel with my country a dim reflection i know, but by not stating this singular groan from a citizen, societal problems will not be recognized",0
1445,"as an outsider, i cant help but feel sad for filipinos whose lives could have been so much better if not for the corrupt marcos government",0
1446,"excuse me, ma'am last time i checked, the martial law era perpetuated exactly the opposites of what you claimed it was the darkest and most brutal time in the philippines journalists were executed, activists were tortured and arrested, and newspaper outlets were silenced i am outraged it's as though all extrajudicial killings, arrests, and tortures never even took place",0
1447,"and that upside down vision of morality is far scarier than a complete lack of it at one point in the film, marcos declares perception is real, and the truth is not that belief is likely the single greatest threat to humanity",3
1449,"imelda marcos is just spouting lies here, and i cant even imagine bearing to watch it flaunting her fashion, wealth, life, and motherhood makes me so goddamn angry and cringe at the same time i just cant believe she has this platform to talk about her nonsense it remains too safe, and the juxtaposition of ideas doesnt really work for this kind of topic it scares me that this documentary might confuse people who arent familiar with the marcos regime, and worst of all, they might feel sympathy for the marcos family",0
