0,"an inspiring movie hello love goodbye, despite being a largely feel good film, did not shy away from the harsh realities that its ofw audience experiences despite being upfront with the struggles of an ofw, it still serves as a gentle, hopeful reminder for our modern day heroes to not forget to choose themselves to not forget that they can allow themselves to dream, to love, and most of all, to be human it show that love can wait but our dreams it knock once like opportunity grab it once it came in your or our life kathryn bernardo portrays joy's exhaustion, anger and resolution so potently without much words it all comes out in the way her lids look heavy from a two hour sleep how her shoulders slump as she grapples with the thought of her agonizingly routine life we see it in her quiet moments in the night when she can catch a few minutes just to stare blankly at the wall the depiction felt authentic and tugs at your heartstrings, joy is the symbol of women with dream and also her leading man this is a more mature role for alden as well, and the material lets him show a deeper side to his acting chops his character's personal story carried as much weight as the romance, and in ethan's vulnerable moments, we see alden as a dramatic actor, and not just a tutti frutti leading man that's not to say that he didn't play the charismatic boyfriend role well, though the kilig factor we as always cranked up to high, thanks also to his and kathryn's organic chemistry the most unforgettable scene in this movie when ethan and joy decided to leave each other to continue their dream and when ethan said will you give the rest of your time with me in hong kong those line make me sad and overwhelmed because even they know that they leave each other they choose to understand and make those little time to make memorable, they choose to spent those time to be happy this movie make us inspired that life is like a photography, we developed from negative",7
1,"love is about letting go not sacrifice i've seen a few of kathryn bernardo's films, and i believe she turned in the performance of her life she stepped away from the typical romantic comedies many of which are actually quite good , and challenged herself to take on the role of a much deeper and much more complex character in joy i have always marveled and not in a good way of how people tend to use others even people they love even members of their own families of course, children are usually guilted into it in short, it's a parent's way of saying, i suffered, and so now you must suffer too because it's how families work as stated in other reviews, i am an esl teacher i've lived and worked in south korea, china, and taiwan i know quite a bit about how asian parents tend to treat their kids you'll scarcely find parents who are more dedicated to teaching their children about discipline and hard work the large contrast between them and western parents, is that western parents tend to allow their kids to do whatever they want they're spoiled beyond belief what is needed is a balance as the eldest daughter, joy is in hong kong working several jobs in order to keep herself alive as well as sending money back home to her family in the phillippines she has a nursing degree her dream is to go to canada to pursue what she loves of course, she meets and falls in love with ethan, a young man who is also from the phillippines, who is trying to support his family as well, after a disastrous relationship that nearly cost him everything ethan, of course, is hoping that joy will decide to stay in hong kong, and not go to canada this is when the film really grabs the viewer to see what joy will decide to do love is not about sacrifice for someone else sacrifice is about losing something, and love is never about loss it's always about who you are in all her wisdom, joy has to explain this to ethan as well as outlining the consequences of not pursuing her dream fortunately, ethan finally gets it and is able to do what only love can do let go some can do it in the end, you can only truly look after yourself and not lose sight of your own dreams if you forge ahead, then you have gained more profound wisdom about life than what most people can only dream about my only complaint of the film was that the chemistry between kathryn bernardo and alden richards was not what it should have been i'd say it was pretty obvious that kathryn bernardo did not want to do any kissing scenes with alden due to her love and respect for her boyfriend, daniel padilla the only kiss we see is one on her forehead in the dark i couldn't help but wonder how much more powerful the film would have been if another actress had performed in the role, or if padilla himself hadn't turned the role down which i read that he had still, this is a memorable film that challenges everyone to go after their dreams and let nothing and no one stand in your way",-1
2,"what a nice surprise of a movie right, well i didn't really know what i was getting into here when i sat down to watch the 2019 tagalog movie that was filmed in hong kong and given my fascination with asian movie, of course i sat down to watch hello, love, goodbye and i must definitely say that writers carmi raymundo, cathy garcia molina and ronalisa a co came up with a rather enthralling storyline one that definitely provided as much of entertainment and enjoyment, as it was a movie that was very watchable and likeable the storyline is one that easily sways away the audience, because it is wholehearted and nicely told storyline and milling about in the storyline are some nicely detailed and interesting characters so a big thumbs up to the writers on this accomplishment i will say that the acting in the movie was good now, i am not overly familiar with tagalog cinema, but my wife told me that there were some rather famous tagalog actresses and actors in the movie nevertheless, i think the acting performances were spot on at the same time, with providing a good story and good entertainment, hello, love, goodbye really brought me back to my four years of living and working in hong kong this movie stoked so many memories and definitely spurred a desire to return to hong kong to revisit that fabulous place if you like romantic movies, then i strongly believe that the 2019 movie hello, love, goodbye from director cathy garcia molina is a movie that you will thoroughly enjoy i was more than genuinely entertained by this movie, and it is a movie that i can warmly recommend you sit down to watch my rating of hello, love, goodbye lands on a well deserved seven out of ten stars",7
3,"hello, love, no goodbyes being the highest grossing philippine movie thus far, i hope you don't mind if i came into watching this with high expectations still i was skeptic because the assumption was it will be another one of those formulaic star cinema movie starring kathryn bernardo, directed by cathy molina garcia, set in an international location, usual love story but with a twist we get a new boy this time in the form of alden richards for the most part i was right, it was all you could ever expect from the same group that gave us the highest grossing movie the year before, 'how's of us ' amidst it's shortcomings, 'hello, love, goodbye' is a pleasant surprise for a movie who's theme has been done a million times part of it's success can be attributed to showing us the reality of our hardworking domestic helpers in hong kong which the ofw community all over the world related and responded to and it did not give us the usual ending we are used to, which makes a sequel possible seeing as all three already expressed interest in doing the story was well written for the most part and my favorite was the start of the movie it was a different approach, fast paced and intriguing while at some point it had to slow down to become what it really was meant to be in the first place, a typical pinoy love story, at least it introduced something new to the audience that can be the new norm in the future acting wise, kathryn and alden both delivered but both lacked maturity which i'm hoping can be improved on once the sequel rolls around it took a while for their chemistry to kick in, possibly a result of being pigeonholed in their respective love teams for a long time kathryn can act, but she has certain mannerisms when she deliver some of her lines that breaks my concentration from her acting i'm still getting rich girl even though she's supposed to be covered in filth from hiding under a pile of garbage bags alden still comes from the john lloyd cruz school for acting, but as soon as he develops his own signature he should be destined for greater things the supporting cast did what was required of them, with maxine medina and jameson blake as highlights there's always the burden of asking whether this is the movie that will propel philippine cinema back to it's old glory obviously this is not it, but delightfully it's not a step back as well knowing this specific tandem and formula works, hopefully everyone involved will be more keen on wanting to elevate the viewing experience the second time around i keep harping on this because i honestly believe it has the potential to become even more special than what they've already done here",2
4,"truly amazing this is so far, the best filipino movie of 2019 i really love the story, which shows a lot about the lives of filipino workers in hong kong this will make you laugh out loud a lot and cry hard for me this is cathy garcia molina's best movie kathryn and alden really shines in this, great acting by the whole cast it also has great shots, cinematography and soundtrack so it is a must watch",2
5,"mature and bold love story the two stars from the two different stations hit it off with good chemistry in this mature love story although the story is as typical as any filipino love romance movie could be, i like the fact that the writer and director went for the bold path of ending the movie with goodbye , instead of coming up with an epilogue that let the two lovers meet again in some future the two lead stars are engaging enough for you to care what happens to them in the end but there are some parts where it could drag still, i can understand the clamor when this movie came out in 2019",-1
6,the best filipino movie ever this is the best pinoy movie ever the characters are superb kathryn bernardo and alden richards performance was the best there is no boring moments in the movie it's a must watch for everyone kathryn bernardo played the role of joy a filipino worker in hong kong who is struggling and doing odd jobs to take care of her family on the other hand alden richards played the role of ethan a funny and unserious bartender who later crossed path with joy and the story of their undying love begins the story is not just another pinoy love story it's a story that shows the struggle of all ofw i was touched and move by the acting of kathryn bernardo and alden richards they made it possible for me to relate with the movie i'm not a filipino but i was able to get every piece of the movie because of their wonderful onscreen chemistry kudos to the cast and crew good job director molina i wouldn't mind to travel again for the part 2 of this movie it's worth my time and my money more movies for this duos please i would always travel with my family to watch their movie onscreen more movies for kathryn bernardo and alden richards please they've won my heart,2
7,kathryn alden seemed too rehearsed and some of their co actors were really annoying save your money and just watch this on netflix or cinema one when it airs,3
8,"a simple mirror this is another cheese pinoy movie, but base in real life, that is the point, at the end family is not the principal role, a twisted end, a lot of lacrimogen bomb, good for the family but pinoy is the new korean drama",-1
9,great movie its an eye opener to some of the facing problems of ofw,-1
10,"time must start again 7 7 vg timing in life is everything so the adage goes in hong kong, time is gld as long as you move you'll live over 200,000 filipinos work in hong kong it's most common to have a 2 yr domestic helper contract as filipinos are not allowed to do anything else unless they manage to become a citizen the cops, inevitably, will come by to check ids when joy sees them, she busts a move and runs she ends up running right into the handsome bartender and busts another move she uses him as camouflage to hide from the po po cops rarely bother a couple snogging in the alleyway, afterall it's done so often in movies you might think that they would start checking, even if a duo is rounding first and headed for second, but it always seems to work everyone is within 1 of separation, but it's large enough to support a filipino radio station they have a nifty microeconomic system in place as well joy thinks she got away scott free only to wake up the next morning to a radio announcement about her ethan, the bartender, is looking for joy so that she can return the kiss that she stole from him joy's friends go insane hlg is about what decent, but poor, people must do to survive it is all about hard choices it is also about the nature of love joy ethan ethan joy she resists him, but she can't for long she's going to be a nurse in canada nt a thing budkis pistza larkaflark nuffink jack squat natty joy is no wimp she has a will of iron she warns ethan to not get attached yet they allow themselves to fall in love every day they push the knife in a little deeper their story is sweet and these protags are likable he says he can handle it and he won't get in her way, but as that approaches the pressure ratchets up because, 'when you love, it's all or nothing if you hold back, then why love it all ' ethan has a point 'there are questions inside of me that only i can answer,' joy insists joy has goals, a mission, and an ironclad agenda what does it look like to ethan it's if you loved me enough you would stay to joy it's if you loved me enough you would want me to go later, joy asks the universe when a woman gives too much of herself, she's stupid, but when she prioritizes herself, she's bad is love only expressed through sacrifice love can teeter from selfish to selfless perhaps love always starts down in the selfish zone, but the more we sincerely love someone, the more selfless we should become leaving the shallow end and diving down deeper should elevate our love higher if not, we must question how much in we are or how selfish we actually are a young person should never be expected to throw away h h future for a relationship, particularly a relatively new one joy agonizes over this unexpected timeout from the race she's been running either option is valid her choice is hers alone hlg tells young girls that their personal development and future is every bit as important as love befitting a modest budget, most of the filming is on the street or in contained spaces there's a couple of wow shots they take a day off to go up into the mountains on a cliff looking down on the city, the buildings are uniformly white while they look like bad dental work there's also an ethereal beauty to the vista hlg is a 118 minute, 2019 release that is rated 8 2 on mdl overall, this is a well put together production the writing, directing and acting all blend to make a great product with few flaws this is a filipino production and i am looking forward to seeing more of their works i've seen 2 hong kong productions, the defected 8 2 and hong kong west side stories 7 both of them are good but also dark, edgy, sad, and a display of the worst elements of humanity the group that is the most downtrodden in hong kong seems to have a brighter outlook hlg is well worth the time to get a peek at life in hong kong from the view of the hard working, overlooked filipino community we have alot to be thankful for imho 78 72 79 70 67 71 70 30 78 23 47 30 49 20 45 0 70 age 12 adult situations kissing mild rated pg parental guidance suggested re not opposed",-1
11,best filipino love story movie this movie is almost 90 accurate when it comes to portraying ofw life in china acting is very good and i never expected that kath and alden would have a good chemistry,2
12,"i wish that her writers and directors would gave her something different worthy of famas or urian award, she deserves it, it was just the material that always failed her the story could have been very good to tell, but it was the storytelling that seems to be ordinary and safe but at the end of the day, it makes you feel something and that is what filipino films are good at",13
13,"superb acting and story kathryn and alden gave justice to their characters you'll forget that these are actors just portraing roles because they portrayed their characters so well the chemistry between these two is overflowing these movie is not just a love story, it's a life story it tells you the life of overseas filipino worker abroad, the struggle that they have to go through to achieve their goals for themselves and thier family",-1
14,"hello, love, goodbye unexpected chemistry of kathryn bernardo and alden richards they successfully portrayed their characters the plot of the story is great and we want more great job team hlg part2 please",3
15,"pretty great finally, no cheesy cliche filipino romance in here it's a great start for hollywood esque films it even has lessons like remember to care for your family and how to love someone purely how much ofws work hard just to provide for their family and how other people should appreciate that the best one is 'i love you but this time, i love myself more '",2
16,"what the world needs real emotion, it gives you a glimpse of what its like to be an ofw worker, more so being a domestic helper teaching one that inorder for you to love others, you need to love yourself first you need to choose your own happiness",4
17,"alden richards' character, ethan, is pushy, creepy and problematic ethan will continue sending friend requests even if joy declined several times already he will make the radio station talk about joy in public without her permission he will use another phone to text joy anonymously he will act like a police even if joy is weeping out of fear he will squeeze through inside a small room knowing that joy will be uncomfortable he will continually send need a friend today text messages even if joy has rejected it so many times 'hello, love, goodbye' is at its best when it tells the story of kathryn bernardo's character, joy in some ways, the film manages to outdo similar mainstream filipino romance films because of kathryn bernardo's stunning performance and the earnest depiction of ofws bernardo, whose acting holds the film together when it was falling apart, effectively evokes a palpable sense of weariness, discontent, and eagerness to alleviate joy's situation actually, i can do without the 'la la land' love story if the social commentary was strengthened and expounded more in a similar vein with 'sunday beauty queen,' the film resonates with filipinos because of its sensible portrayal of what it is like to work abroad in a job you are overqualified in sure, this is how cliche ridden mainstream filipino romance plays out but how i wish we get movies that transcend this generic romantic stratagem",5
18,"best of 2019 this is by far the first movie of alden richards that i watched at first, it was just an attempt to like the tandem of kath and alden but it turned out to be an affirmation of their chemistry i was moved and even shed some tears even in scenes where not much is expected simple conversations that will make you fall into tears very touching movie it's actually about love in general and that includes love of family",3
19,it was the most best movie of alden and kathryn i ever watched this not just a love story it was more than a love story its story of dreams that we need to see how far we can go and nothing can stop us even love and i salute all filipinos who works hard and conquered other countries for their families we absolutely need a second part in this one i don't really into in filipino movies it was my first local movie i watched in 2019,2
20,"much love i would love to watch this over and over again i love the film all in general i was so speechless, so please help your self to witness this movie it's not your typical love story but it was a real life of an ofw that working hard",1
21,"a story highlighting selfless love and sacrifice breathe of freshness on screen, we've been served with a platter of good offering, ar's gentleman antics and kb's toughness and complexity complements each other's character just right, a movie that highlights the life,pain and sufferings of filipino working abroad especially hongkong an eye opener about the common misconceptions about the life of our modern day heroes the brave ofws another masterpiece from direct cathy garcia molina for mixing out the reality of life abroad, stories of risk takers the dreamers sacrifice selfless love",2
22,"it depicts a few of the many instances of what ofws experience while working abroad the chemistry happened between the viewers and alden kathryn, but not between the characters themselves i haven't talked about the problems with the other casts i would have felt better if i just watched the film anak with the other ofws in one of the film's scenes",3
23,"this isnt just one of those sappy romance stories, no, it covers real life topics i assume about filipinos foreign workers, immigration etc i gotta admit that i never really think twice about these things but this movie makes me feel the pain we just gotta be grateful of choices we have in life some people have it harder now, kathryn joy is such an amazing actress i can almost relate to everything shes going through in the movie and oh, prepare tissues cause youre gonna need em",-1
24,"a movie with a heart hello goodbye love what a beautifully made movie, what a wonderful message for the millennials great story by ms carmi raymundo, great directing by cathy garcia molina, great acting by both main actors, ms kathryn bernardo and mr alden richards as well as the supporting actors the movie focuses on the life of joy, a filipino nurse graduate who works instead as a dh domestic helper in hong kong the crux of the film shows how ofws overseas filipino worker live in other countries for me, the love story between the characters was secondary but it was the right touch to bind things together kathryn is most beautiful bare faced and delivers a great performance a must see movie",7
25,a filipino movie that you should watch this is by far the best filipino movie of 2019 and one of the best of all time there's no waste or boring moment this movie sets the new benchmark for filipino movie a must watch and highly recommended,2
26,"it's unique by itself, highly recommended a must watch film it's unique by itself, highly recommended a must watch film alden ethan and kathryn joy brings spice to a good story i can tell that its a masterpiece love the movie part 2 please",1
28,"worth watching, good story not a fan of the 2 lead actors, but i can say that they did a good job portraying the characters in this movie cinematography is good the 2 leads have chemistry despite them not being paired at all before the story, most especially the ending part, makes it worth watching good overall and probably the best filipino movie among the others during that time, however, it is similar to the other mainstream filipino movies",2
29,please do the part 2 falling in love with the whole story and the actor mixed feelings but i need the second please do the part 2 please don't stop making great story like this,1
30,"a must watch movie i highly recommend this movie to everyone this is not your ordinary rom com movie that will just give you smile and love this is a realistic movie where you'll see the life of a filipino ofw in hongkong the sacrifices and dreams for the family but love will always come at the least expected time kathryn bernardo never failed me to amaze on her acting skills she always devote herself into the character and put amazing life onto it i must say that i'm a fan alden richards on the other hand surprises me on his hotness throughout the whole movie these two characters made my heart cry and leaving me to re watch again the movie that feeling you have when you finish an amazing movie that you don't want it to end director cathy is a genius on her craft she knows how to perfectly put drama, romance and comedy into a single movie everyone must watch this movie this movie will teach or remind us to love yourself, love your family, follow your dreams, live your life to the fullest until you have time, true love will set you free, and the list goes on",-1
31,"honest review nothing special about the movie's plot except the best performance from kathryn and alden maybe because i couldn't relate to the movie but kathryn and alden was so great they make the ordinary story extraordinary and don't forget the kilig factor alden brought up on some scenes overall, not a waste of money",3
32,"honest review why 5 lets start with how great kathryn's acting is as expected from her the hows of us piece alden did ok wasn't expecting much but it was a solid performance however his acting reminds me of john lloyd but in this movie it's neither then again a solid one now, the lines they are trying to squeeze the hugots absolutely anywhere they want in the film go watch it again, you'll see the same style of focus and switch to subject over and over again there are many scenes that could've shot with them both in the frame to show their emotions at the same time it was like action and my 11 yr old daughter even agreed how bad the shots are compare this with tadhana, 100 na tula, kita kita, the day after valentines, never not love you, and walangforever if you havent seen these, go watch them and thank me later 5 is because of kathryn",3
33,"just wow in what may be cathy garcia molina's best movie to date, this movie overcomes the banal and stereotypical nuances pinoy romcoms are known for in fact the apparent filipino diaspora is the true backdrop of this movie the ensuing love story merely serves as extravagance but will eventually turn complimentary to the already palatable storyline of kathryn bernardo's plight as a struggling domestic helper torn between the choice of staying in hongkong to be with the man she loves alden richards and fulfilling her destiny to be a succesful nurse in canada both characters are vibrant and played to a t by the two lead actors but that stockroom scene is just plain fun and genius the chemistry between the two characters made apparent by screams of excitement from my neighboring seat as the pair locked eyes for the first time forget about the common adequacy pinoy films are usually associated with we may suck in action and sci fi movies but we can definitely make quality films in other genres like this one again, this is not a paid ad",-1
34,nice love story with great story lines my first time watching filipina romantic love story the storyline was pretty engaging it keeps you watching all the way great acting and scenes as well,2
35,"great movie great acting skills of alden, warms the heart despite struggles working abroad",3
36,"it's not hollywood, but for a pinoy style movie , this is ver good after watching the movie, i just have love everything about it the feeling of missing the characters after the movie ended goodvibes, inside the cinema, it is so nice to hear people having mixed emotions throughout the entire movie, nakakakilig, nakakatawa, nakakaiyak it's not heavy , just simple kathryn's voice is just perfect for her role she has a straight face but she managed to give expressions that justifies every line she says, thru her eyes you will love her more in this movie alden has an expressive face, can portray a sad eyes and happy smile at the same time with that expressive face, i was amazed that he made me smile and laugh with those supposedly cheesy lines of the script i did not expect that he is this good he actually can shift from happy to sad to serious without you noticing the transition plus he is so manly and handsome many women inside the cinema were so 'kilig' everytime his face shows up especially upclose the supporting cast will give you a break to the story of joy and ethan, they are very funny i meant, just their presence adds excitement they are the ones who completed the movie good choice of names of the lead actors joy is a name that is nice to hear from alden's voice ethan could be alden's alternative name in real life, it suits him well and mary dale is maymay's real name, very filipino and youthful name for her character great chemistry, ethan's arms looks so comfy everytime he hugs joy when they look at each other in the eyes, it's genuine alden's bubbly voice and joy's serious voice are blending nicely that is why just them sitting and talking brings kilig you can see hongkong itself, even in just a glimpse you can see the unity of filipinos being an ofw is hard but having to see a community of filipino around you brings comfort and home some parts are like music videos, maybe because the music is so good to hear in those hongkong buildings in the background direk cathy is really exeptional she will bring out the best in all actors she choses the best on everything the movie itself tells different stories in just 2 hours all stories are true to life, but hopeful all stories are aspiring to have a better life and chasing happiness in order to chase happiness, you should make sacrifices, but making sacrifices is not sad at all the whole movie is not korean or hollywood, but filipino there is always room for improvement but that improvement, we should make movies more like filipino style it is very simple actually but filipinos are loving it because it is very light, its for family bonding you wont feel awkward watching it with your grandparents i gave it 10 over 10 because i cant get over it",-1
37,it's an ok film story it's good but there is some strained scene just to make the story long extend actor ethan alden richards he's acting skills is amendable there's some blunt moments in his facial acts actress joy kathryn bernardo no doubt a great actress cinematography great beautifulyl shot,-1
38,"great movie, not your typical filipino romcom love this movie very much gave me different kinds of emotions",2
39,"very worth it a story about everything that's happening in real life from sacrifices, responsibilities, self love and relationships not a fan of tagalog movies, watched this upon recommendations from friends truly worth every penny great job kathryn and alden",-1
40,"great movie one of my fav movie, i love the cast, the plot, i love everything",1
41,"had that before sunrise vibe watched this the other night on netflix, after being in my list for a while and boy it was good, it starts a bit chaotic but once you're in ,then you're in all characters where good, and the chemistry between joy and ethan was very convincing it is a romantic movie of course, but with a message like i said in my title, it had for me that before sunrise feel and since that's my favorite movie of all time, that's a compliment",-1
42,10 10 for a filipino film this is one of the best filipino films i have watched,2
43,worth watching pinoy movie the movie depicts the reality of life being ofw's their struggles dramas and obstacles make the love chemistry of the couple protagonists worth fighting for each other its theme is deep and so heart touching,-1
45,"well yes, you better leave that man to chase your nursing ambitions i love when characters have to define their priorities and decide between two things that they desperately want and i love even more when romance movies dont make them choose the relationship i cant promise... that i wont have regrets for all the things we werent able to do because we loved each other",14
46,"they both became selfish for each other just to grow ethan wanting to have a life with joy, while joy wanting a life of her own",5

77,gumanda 'yung pelikula,0
80,"its a film about chasing dreams, choosing yourself, and realizing that love doesnt always mean staying some scenes felt slow, but maybe thats the point love, like life, isnt always rushed",-1
81,there's a reason there's 'goodbye' in the title kathryn's lines juts gets me there will be that someone who will change your life unexpectedly for just a short period of time because you two will never be meant for each other because life plans back who knew that these two actors will be so effective with their craft and will have an effortless chemistry as an on screen couple this pairing really worked,7
82,"as a birthday tradition, i watch this film with a beer at hand and keep in mind that hello, love, again doesnt exist perfect",1
83,"hlg shows us what love is for millions of ofws messy, complicated, and often not enough i love that joy and ethans relationship does not pretend that love conquers all sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is choose yourself i miss my mama",-1
84,"all throughout the film, walang balak bumalik si joy sa pilipinas enter ethan buti na lang he was matured enough the second time joy is full of dreams mataas ang pangarap niya pero willing siya mag settle sa kung anong pwede niyang magawa joy and ethan finding solace with each other feels natural na para bang they meant to find each other overall, the film is really good i remembered crying the same amount as the first time i watched this",-1
85,"ang mga linya ay natural at totoo, kaya ang mga emosyon ng mga karakter ay higit na nadarama sa aking palagay, maganda pa rin ang paggamit ng filipino sa pelikulang ito dahil ito ay nagpapakita ng ating wika na nagpapahayag ng tunay na damdamin at karanasan para lalo pang pagbutihin, makabubuting bigyang pansin ang paggamit ng mas malalim at mas masining na mga salita sa filipino upang mas maipakita ang yaman at kagandahan ng ating sariling wika",0

97,"i really love how theyve shown the lives of the ofws their sacrifices, silent battles, and the longing that comes with being miles away from home one of the main reasons why i chose this as the film subject for my discourse analysis in grade 11 but above all, theyve shown us a story about choosing yourself and all that you have to go through to do that and joy was such a great protagonist for this because how can you love someone so much, and still have to let them go to choose yourself all her life, she had to put others first before herself, giving up and sacrificing things for people but when the time came that she finally decided to choose herself, she wasnt being selfish she was finally being free i admire her so much for having the courage to leave, to allow herself to grow and dream and ethan its a hard pill to swallow, but its the truth the reality that not all the love in the world can save us joy was never lacking in reminding him that shes going to leave she never made false promises, never painted a forever she couldnt give it was he who pushed himself into her life, even when she kept on pushing him away i know that ethan just hoped its not a bad thing but sometimes, hope blinds us from the truth we already know, making her choose between the dream shes been working hard for and the love she never expected to find so yup, joy, tama ka sa sinabi mong, kung mahal mo ko, bakit pinapapili mo ako at sana, makahanap tayong lahat ng taong hindi tayo papipiliin tulad ni ethan",-1
98,the individual character stories were a lot more compelling than when it was a romance which felt incredibly frustrating to get through,-1
100,"i love the telling of the ofw experience on top of what happened during covid such an important narrative that was done well especially highlighting what many sacrifice for their families more than what i expected tbh so pleasantly surprised but with that being said, i really wish it ended when shes in the cab to go to the airport",-1
101,kathryn carried,12
102,the way this movie edged me like i thought theyd get a good ending baya and its kinda timing too that i found they made a sequel like a few months after i first watched it which i do not remember rlly interesting characters like it made me wonder why they thought n did the things they did,1

108,"while it certainly has its cliche moments, hello, love, goodbye is surprisingly effective in handling more serious themes capturing the emotional toll of economic hardship and life in an unfamiliar city through an empathetic lens the lead performances, as the characters navigate complicated family dynamics and dream of a better future, felt very mature and nuanced, further elevating the films overall impact",7
110,take out the romance and this movie is infinitely better,1

153,erikson stage young adulthood intimacy vs isolation,-1
154,"not the most life altering piece of cinema but definitely the most modern filipino movie that i'm proud of so far rip to kathniel but also not because kathryn bernardo and these other actors deserve to have their spotlight and be taken srsly as actors instead of being forced into a loveteam from an early age still loved their movies together but this was definitely a huge risk in the filipino entertainment industry and im glad they delivered obviously still has its fair share of red flag romanticism for the leading man but as alwayssssss the filipina baddie carries but just knowing how the usual filipino rom coms go, this was already breaking tradition, while still managing to deliver the kilig factors i love that the ending is up to interpretation, and kathryn still pursues her career as a nurse very bold choices against the usual filipino movie plot lines its a good love story, the chemistry is there, and also love how it mixes in the harsh realities of working abroad and the hard working filipino spirit they were in hong kong though,, so the shots could have been way prettier cinematically but props to the director and the casting, kathryn bernardo always has my heart and i cant wait to see her in more movies alden is alright too im just pretending the sequel doesnt exist",2

250,really does such a great job of showing the lives of ofws around the world and the struggles they face to earn money,2
251,mygod rewatch was badly needed,1
252,kathryn acted the heck out of this one kitang kita ang versatility and improvement niya talaga didn't expect na their chemistry would work so well loved the writing,3

256,"shut up, ethan",5
257,maganda yung pagkakaexecute nung story ang galing ni kathyrn dito buti na lang hindi siya nastuck sa love team niya with daniel super natural lang nung acting niya ang galing din ni alden pumantay talaga siya sa acting ni kathryn iba talaga si direk cathy maganda kasi nahighlight yung hardship ng isang ofw pinakita rin kung gaano kalakas and katapang ang isang babae nagustuhan ko siya kasi hindi siya yung typical romance movie na happily ever after super realistic lang nung ending especially for a person na mas uunahin ang pamilya kaysa sa sariling kaligayahan,0
258,bolder fiercer kathryn i love you,8
260,i had fun and thats all that matters,6

272,perfect cinematography for me,1
273,log ko lang kahit nakisali lang ako sa nanay ko and if i say sunday beauty queen is the better ofw movie,0
274,"i was not able to fully commit to watching this movie, however i really enjoyed seeing the motives for the characters make a lot of sense as someone who lived abroad, the realism in the film's setting is very pleasing to see",-1
275,"the parts that show the struggles of being an overseas filipino worker are the best parts of the film simply because it hits hard when you know people that have parents being ofws around the world where you can feel joy's frustration of balancing between achieving her dreams and providing for her family ethan is a mixed bag for me where there are parts that are so endearing you can't help but smile at his line delivery and his love for joy, and at the same time, i wish that joy would ignore him or just call the police on him for calling her everyday the ending felt really realistic as it closes and opens different questions of their relationship people are mixed on the sequel for some reason, so all the more reason for me to check it out soon",2
278,rewatched this again because i miss hk,1
280,will always appreciate a movie with a hardworking woman and provider they deserve the same love they give,-1
283,"i appreciate this movie for showing a glimpse into the life of an ofw working as a domestic helper, and for highlighting the reality that many of them hold degrees that could qualify them for opportunities far beyond the jobs and salaries theyre stuck with kathryn nailed her roleher character felt real and easy to sympathize with ethan wanted joy to stay because, for the first time since his breakup with tanya, he felt like he had purpose againsomething he found in helping joyand he didnt want to let that go",-1
287,the setting of hongkong in this film is so goodd,-1
288,"joy, a hardworking domestic helper, and ethan, a charming bartender, fall in love while working overseas in hong kong it's a fairly grounded love story that reminds us that sometimes love means letting go kathryn bernardo, as joy, carried the film for me as she is forced to choose between love and following her dreams, capturing the quiet resilience of countless filipinos abroad we also get to see the emotional toll, economic pressures, and social sacrifices ofws face living in constant hustle while enduring discrimination, homesickness, and uncertain legal standing a reminder that behind many ofws are stories of struggle, strength, and dreams deferred",2
289,"overall yeah i liked it i think it's good there's definitely some stronger parts and some weaker parts but the story works and i find both joy and ethan likeable by the end and a sweet couple nothing against their romance because i think it gets better towards the end, but joy's plot initially about working away from home and having to provide from her family and also putting herself first for once in her life is way interesting...",9

572,"joy, a live in migrant cum domestic helper in hong kong, prepares to leave for canada to pursue her dreams when she unexpectedly meets ethan, and the two fall in love however, their relationship comes at the risk of their personal goals and aspirations while it's probably my third watch, this time with an objective, so here are thoughts i felt some scenes were mixed with the usual pushy theatrics, overly focused shots, and an excessive number of romantic background songs unnecessarily shoved into the film, occasionally straying from authenticity and realism overall, the film manages to maintain authenticity for more than three fourths of its runtime hello, love, goodbye offers something for everyoneheartbreaking romance, politically tinged drama, and uniquely scenic locations in hong kong, encapsulating both the classic three night, four day tourist spots and the lesser known areas it effectively captures the realism of hong kongs live in migrant workers, highlighting their struggles with abuse, poor working conditions, the fight for pr, sunday gatherings of domestic workers, and the depiction of a city that never sleeps bernardo and richards ignite the screen with natural chemistry, speaking volumes through lingering glances and long silences every shared moment crackles with quiet intensity, letting emotions simmer and adding profound depth to their connection, with moments of joyful humor in between the film is lively and, at times, playfully silly, thanks to its ensemble of supporting characters, which helps create a feel good vibe for the audience i personally appreciated the character development approach taken by cathy garcia sampana the first ten minutes serve as a synopsis of joys character, unfolding family issuesfrom the rift between joys mother and father to ethans desire to keep his family together all in all, the films emphasis on character building, assisted by sincere backstories and strong performances from the leads, enhances its authenticity additionally, the films settinghong kongs hazy skyline, busy crowd, and colorful, grid like residential blockspaints a compelling backdrop for a story that leaves audiences hoping for a sequel",-1

656,"they engaged ethan's alden richards character into a playboy turned humbled archetype genuinely falling in love with joy kathryn bernardo , despite the latter's constant disregard to his actions when initially pursuing her the film provides a definite picture of the fate of their relationship, though cute and sweet, is quite less interesting, honestly not to mention the soundtrack of the film charot and this is coming from the fact that they also chose to navigate a much essential story the collective plight of overseas filipino workers ofw in hong kong there have been numerous films capturing the stories of overseas workers this film specifies the struggles in the eyes of domestic helpers in hk joy is among those who has made sacrifices in an attempt to experience an economic progress they have to live in a system that limits them as well, yet, for joy, she continues to live beyond the limited lines and risks her life for arrest and deportation at the center, we get to immerse in the crowds of workers 'veteran' workers hyping up 'fresh' workers saying they will get used to it, workers busily arranging packages to send back home, phone calls of longingness and heartbreak, and we even get a glimpse of the tragic situation of joy's mother kathryn bernardo potrayed the character like her rent is due ang daming nangyari sa buhay niya with all the struggles, responsibility, pressures, all that continue to burden her, and she carried it all and nasa punto siguro ako ng buhay ko na naniniwalang parang display lang talaga kung titingnan si ethan no hate but then again, this is direk cathy, and this is a romance drama film",-1
657,"here, i realized that love will not force you to choose because love should be the foundation of a relationship another thing is that we are capable of becoming more than we think we can the story beautifully revolves around the life of an ofw, shedding light on aspects often unseen by manythe need for a safe space and a reason to save up sometimes, life becomes hard to understand, especially when we decide to choose ourselves, only to meet someone who might also choose us like an airplane, it departs with a destination, carrying lessons, and the film portrayed that beautifully",-1

667,"the plot was good but it was not amazing or special or different in any other way maybe they've adapted this deep and hurtful hugot lines because that's what catches viewer's attention when watching trailers and that's what is used for memes on social media alden richards proved to people that he does know how to act he has this charm that can make you swoon but it was not enough for me to feel a spark between him and kathryn bernardo kathryn just keeps getting better and better her acting on this film is way more mature than those of her other films cinematography is good especially during the first part and the climax i love how the pallette switches from vivid strong colors in the drama's hardworking scenes to dark, warm colors for its personal and intimate parts not that crazy about the scoring though filled with long dialogues,and cliches, hello love, goodbye still did not capture the drama of being an ofw in hongkong even though the hard to get scenes and perseverance to woo the woman are there, it remains on the box of a typical romance flick which we have already seen a number of times it sure adapted a different ending from our most typical pinoy movie hits back then but the execution of presenting the reason behind it was not that powerful as well",3

834,"hello, love, goodbye comes across as the philippines la la land but grounded in its culture and story a romance drama that shows the bitter reality of people trying to chase their dreams in tough situations actors kathryn bernardo and alden richards are sensational and display immaculate chemistry the realistic story about love dreams, will touch your heart and soul as someone who is half filipino, it was eye opening experience to witness the hardships of my culture hello, love, goodbye is a great romance drama filled with hard truths and reality but with added beauty and pain to create a wonderful film so i saw the sequel to this film hello, love, again currently in theaters first it was my introduction to philippines cinema once i was informed on twitter that theres a first film, i decided to check it out the plot of hello, love, goodbye is pretty clear cut set in hong kong, a filipina domestic helper working hard to make the move to canada meets a filipino bartender trying to help his family even with the truth and circumstances laid out these two are drawn to each other leading to a honest portrayal of love, with all the highs and lows that come attached with it it was refreshing to see a story feature characters who dont have everything together and are also struggling made things feel more genuine and authentic to me especially prominent in the brief little joys, no pun intended and adventures they partake in to escape their reality this film did a good job of hitting you hard in the feels some might not like how it ended but i did if you are a dreamer like myself, it made perfect sense i really have to commend actor kathryn bernardo for giving us such a gripping performance as joy her character goes through so much that she has to endure to maintain focus on her dream luckily kathryn bernardo really gave her best to convey the various emotions of joys situation brilliantly she had the best performance in the movie her co star alden richards matched her incredible acting and energy with his character ethan but we can all relate to ethan because love makes you do strange things however alden richards adds a lot of charm and sincerity to ethan hello, love, goodbye is an excellent romance drama from the philippines even though its ingrained fully into its culture, it can be easily enjoyed by everyone for we all have been in similar situations when it comes to relationships, dreams and love ive always maintained that the best romance films arent the ones that give you the typical happy ending this is what makes hello, love, goodbye beautiful as always, go watch this for yourself",7
835,lost count of how many times i've watched this,1
836,"pero maganda, pinapangit lang ng sequel dahil nakatuluyan niya si ethan na walang pakialam sa individuality niya bilang babae at nurse haha",0

838,"joy makes the difficult decision to leave hong kong for canada to pursue her dream of becoming a nurse, which puts her and ethan in a long distance relationship as they each live in their respective cities, time and the covid 19 pandemic take their toll on their relationship after going their separate ways, fate has again brought them together under different circumstances and as evolved individuals this is an excellent romantic movie with a good balance of comedy and drama the story is simple, but the combination of immigration, a global pandemic, and a pinch of cultural humor makes it unique the story shares how love grows and changes and how individuals must grow and change to survive and thrive this is a great movie to stream for a unique international romance",2

859,"isn't that how it's supposed to be the story is a bit clunky, and there's a lot of cheese, but hey, which filipino movies aren't by the end i fully bought into the relationship, which made it hit harder emotionally in the best way definitely a filipino culturally specific story with a lot of specific attitudes themes, familial sacrifice...",2

894,"it was a very clear choice... miss girl had nothing to lose i am both curious and afraid to see what direction their relationship will go in the sequel, if any watching this made me remember the time i met alden richards, asked for a photo, then fully stepped on his foot me paying money to see his movie in theatres tomorrow will be my penance",-1

962,"ranking this higher on my second watch, a few years after the first there truly are a few moments and a few lines meant to be comedic this could have done without, but overall, it is easy to understand how and why this became a classic sure, it's a love story, first and foremost but it's also the story of ofws, of people trying to make it in a country outside their own, as people fighting not only for survival but also trying to hold on to their dreams, to make them come true i just love the well roundedness of this movie insightful and humanizing, on top of it being entertaining",1

994,"it's flawed but yeah it's better than other filipino movies i've seen my main complaint is how ethan was so pushy about his pursuit of joy other than that, it was pretty good i liked it didn't just focus on their romance i like how it displays the reality of ofw some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy and predictable, but that's a usual thing most filipinos seem to like i also found the themes of pursuing dreams relatable, so there's also that",2

1055,best sequel kathryn benardo i love u,3
1056,something to like about a mainstream pinoy movie thats mostly marketed as another love team centric film be some ways more than just about the love team itself,-1
1057,ang pagkakaalam ko napanood ko na siya before pero pinanood ko ulit siya last friday bc we r planning to watch hla and mind you i also cried bc of d film as a iyakin girly you will see the kasi the struggles of ofws na akala ng mga pamilya nils rito sa pinas ay masarap ang buhay nila roon at sobrang dami nilang pera pero ang hindi nila alam sobra ang pagtitipid kung minsan nga hindi na kumakain para may maipadala lang sa pamilya nila rito at kung minsan napakarami nilang trabaho at sabay sabay yon kaya wala silang maayos na pahinga i admire joy kasi may pangarap siya and she's so sure na gusto niya makamit lahat yon and nothing will stop her kahit pa nagkaroon sila ng rs ni ethan although sa last part natanggap din ni ethan and sinuportahan niya rin si joy with her decision i hope na kapag may ganitong love na dumating sa akin i will not question the love of my partner kung aalis siya para sa pangarap niya but i will just support him instead sana mapanood ko today yung hla hoho,0

1078,"timeless classic, a beloved filipino movie that made its mark on cinema history back in 2019, there was so much chaos in the philippines, station wars, loveteams flopping, and everything in between kathryn bernardo and alden richards had one shot to save it and they freaking did two of the most influential filipino celebrities teamed up and broke our hearts major kudos to them rewatching this movie now, especially with the sequel on air, i have to say its been the most heartfelt pinoy film of the decade its so real and authentic, showing how filipinos have to live overseas just to earn enough for their families joy gave up her dreams for others, its so unfair but so true to life, but this guy ethan had some problem with attachment issues lmao, it's such a perfect way to end it without them being together alden richards, the man you are can we talk about his acting ive never seen him act like that before because gma keeps giving him mid movies not to be shady, but fr no wonder it became a blockbuster hit joy is here this first movie is pure nostalgia cinematic, leveled up, and with a soundtrack that was soundtracking this just made me want to watch hello, love, again even more now that joy is happier in canada",2

1103,kinda tear jerking wouldve been better if ethan didnt wear his baduy earrings and necklace and if he wasnt kinda manipulative at some point loved the joy lola love hate relationship much respect to all the filipino filipina dh all over the world,5
1104,"if you love me, why cant you choose if you love me, why are you making me choose but i always had a soft spot for them, especially due to how skilled filipinos are when it comes to implementing the perfect amount of drama and sentiment into their entertainment this movie was pretty solid to me when considering how i was never into these type of movies ive watched a good amount of filo romance movies and like i said, i was never a big fan which is why i was surprised when i found myself appreciating this movie for different aspects and executions first of all, reminds me a lot of la la land 2016 except filipino ofw version as much as it hurts, i like to treasure those bittersweet or tragic love stories because its realistic i live for the realism the hope and joy whilst feeling that agony and yearning, bc i think it really shows u how things really are for a lot of relationships and couples the reality how it was never just about love and trust, but understanding understanding your significant other, and how even when you guys do, the ending isnt always going to be happy i think its a common plot and ive def seen it before i just enjoyed this execution and i liked the mature take on it this movie felt like an entire leap of maturity for both the characters esp ethan and shows the growth of their relationship and of them as people i also loved their chemistry, alden richards and kathryn bernardo as the main couple i was honestly surprised bc i grew up watching some of kaths films and thought she never had a romance one without that daniel padilla dude and i am not mad that i was wrong bc i rlly liked alden and kathryn together they delivered the emotional scenes incredibly and i js loved watching them i also appreciate another bare minimum feature that kinda ties into what i was just talking about but multi dimension like i said, ive seen the plot been done and its nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary but this movie specifically also had me looking at both sides, both dimensions, and understanding both i saw how there wasnt a bad guy nor a good guy, how both were multi dimensional and had their reasons i just loved how it was very clear and how raw certain scenes were im giving it only 3 n a half stars tho bc i js still found myself cringing like hell everytime alden richards character was being creepy af and idk theres js this vibe ab filo movies i cant get over lovebeingpinoy tho",2
1105,"kathryn, the woman that you are",8
1106,pinanood ko lang to dahil papanoorin namin yun hello love again medyo ako si ethan sa past relationship ko pero sana di na ganon katanga soon,0
1108,this film is a corny and cheesy filipino rom com but doesnt change the fact that i enjoyed myself it does challenge the main characters to value prioritize themselves i do wish they offered more serious moments to really delve into who they are and show that deeper connection the moments that kind of hit me were the moments where the mom leaves the dad and hurts because theres so much pain and history there in the end kathryn bernardo is gorgeous and carries this film,2
1109,"two movies, one more compelling than the other, trying to look for a smooth merging point but to no avail",1
1110,"facepalms here and there, but some scenes were just too good, it made me tear up a little bit another ofw movie that really opened my eyes to their situation juggling multiple jobs while hiding from the authorities is definitely not for the weak so, biggest salutes to joy and to all ofw's experiencing the pain and exhaust from all of the jobs you work on when i watched this when i was a bit younger, i really looked up to ethan for trying his best for joy, but now it just came off as him trying to maneuver joy right into his plans but anyhow, it was nice to see that joy really stood firm on her decision, and ethan setting 'more' goals for himself and family",-1
1111,kathryn carried all the way,12
1113,cleansing my palate,0

1131,"what do you get when you mix love, uncompromisable responsibilities, and uncontrollable circumstances this movie the title sums it up really well it presented a realistic view on how love can move mountains, but not one's dreams and aspirations although many romantic films opt to go for happy endings, i'm glad this one didn't ethan and joy's motivations were so grounded and solid that it would be disloyal to their characters if they went another way i like how the film also subverts classic romantic movie tropes by beginning with the first kiss and uttering the i don't love you s it all made sense in the end and it felt earned let's see what the sequel has in store",14
1133,"really makes you open your eyes about the hardships that ofw have to endure, and the ending was really bittersweet, looking forward to watching the sequel",1

1136,"kathryn saved the whole film for me tbh the way he keeps on calling joy during her work hours annoyed me so much kung mahal mo ako bakit hindi ako ang piliin mo, joy its so crazy how ethan already has this whole life planned for them but he never even once stopped to ask her what she wants or needs im just so glad that joy was very firm with her decision to leave tho we love a woman who knows what she wants and lets no one hinder her from getting it 3 i truly wish they dont end up together on the sequel pleaseeeee",15

1145,can't you love me enough damnnn its rlly 'if u love me u would let me go' vs 'if u love me u would stay'its good joy is prioritizing her dreams than pursuing love yes prioritize ur self worth girly jsjajaja gagong fuckboy si ethan mas cute kathden irl than this bad storyline hhhhnakakainis kasi may potential talaga yung plot kaso the writing sucks ass plzzzz at least bittersweet and good terms,-1
1149,"at first, i wasnt sure if kathryn and alden would have good chemistry together, but i was wrong its a typical filipino romantic comedy drama film, with a great cast and some cheesy but unforgettable lines they look really good together, even better than kathryn's last on screen partner the story is pretty much relatable, especially if youre an ofw, because cathy wrote it really well she really pushed kathryn and alden into a whole new level, too the only part that didnt feel right to me was aldens character, ethan it seemed strange and creepythat joy would let ethan stalk her around in the beginning of the film, and he does seem a bit creepy at first i dont think id react like joy did but, overall, its an entertaining movie to watch i enjoyed it and cant wait to see the sequel this weekend",3

1190,"gave this movie a rewatch before its upcoming sequel hello, love, again 2024 ni kathryn which is nangyayari talaga, kadalasan sa mga breadwinner ng pamilya imagine, putting your family as your top priority is a must na kung saan choosing yourself feels like illegal, ang hirap, na kahit sa love ni restrict ni joy yung sarili niya, not until she met someone na tinulungan siyang buhatin lahat ethan made the things lighter for joy and he taught her na wag pigilan yung puso niya na magmahal kahit sa sandaling panahon lang at dahil do'n, naranasan ni joy na piliin ang kung ano'ng gusto ng puso niya ethan this lines reflects the fear of ethan na baka maulit lang yung nakaraan niya and yung suportang kailangan naman ni joy from her love ones, to take the different path she want, that leads to her dream kaya tama lang ang naging desisyon ni joy oo mahal kita, pero mas mahal ko ang sarili ko ngayon joy can't wait to see what will happen to them in hello, love, again 2024",0

1215,"mahal kita, pero sa ngayon mas mahal ko sarili ko somewhat a hard pill to swallow but true we often want to give the best in the people we love, to the point na sometimes we may be a hindrance to their dreams and the things na they want to do i've realized this as someone who's currently in a long distance relationship you can't stop someone from doing the things na they want to pursue, so let them be let them do the things na they want to do let them be their own selves you can still love them while supporting them in every step of the way",4
1216,"dang, i really adore joys character here",-1
1217,"with the upcoming release of its sequel, hello, love, again 2024 , i figured id go ahead and give this film a rewatch in preparation for the new one i remember not really expecting much from this film, and i was honestly quite surprised by it it is a fairly solid film thats well directed by cathy garcia sampana it feels a lot more mature than some romance drama filipino films, especially in how it tackles some of its themes its also carried by its two main leads, kathryn bernardo and alden richards, who have great chemistry with one another that said, the story is rather formulaic, and the characters are a little generic but as a whole, this film right here was still a pretty decent watch",1
1218,"i usually prefer watching western movies rather than filipino movies because i sometimes think that the plot of filipino movies, specifically the latest ones, are too cliche but this film definitely made me change my mind its a great film kathryn is an amazing actress and alden wasnt so bad as well this film really depicts the sad reality that several filipinos must go through due to financial instability the director of this film did an amazing job capturing the real life struggles of our ofws aside from that, kathryns character joy definitely breaks the typical female protagonist stereotypes in romance films where the girl gives up everything just to be with the love of her life in this film, joy taught us that sometimes its okay to be selfish for once especially when youve been nothing but selfless all your life in life, we have to make decisions no matter how painful it gets some decisions are necessary in order for us to have a brighter future to look forward to i admire her character because it shows how much of a strong willed person she is despite ethans attempt to make joy stay, she knew that this wasnt the life that she wanted and that she could do so much more leaving wasnt easy for her but she knew that she had to in order to achieve her dreams overall, this film is so worth watching you know the film is good when kathryn bernardo is starring in it p",2

1231,"girlmath is subtracting the hugot concept from this masterpiece because, don't get me wrong, the romance really hit it off with the kilig factor but for a film to have uniquely crafted characters ones we don't usually see in mainstream media anymore , it would've been wayyyy better if the film focused on being realistic about their individual growth, and kept the romance as undertones of the story but idk am just a girl",-1

1249,"without a doubt, the film beautifully captures the realities of ofws, and bernardo's performance doubles it i won't question how they weaved her character i love how joy chooses her own joy at the end of the movie it was something that was empowering for me just wish they had a different narrative for richard's character than the typical archetype of a guy who got traumatized by his past relationship, resulting into his playboy maneuvers in lifeonly to be changed by the female lead they could have stopped there instead of injecting the part where richard tried to stop bernardo from pursuing canada it could have been a love story that is self sufficient yet consistently supportive but oh well what do you expect overall, i still like the film the cinematography and the acting were superb he could have been that linear supportive and wise love interest",13

1287,watching this when i was 14 and now that im in college was a v diff experience like get awpppp,1
1288,"it's a very mature conversation about love i understand joy's frustrations and rage, it's saddening how the world is too cruel for some, that they simply have no time or resources for love their confrontation about her leaving was also very accurate, that there will always be parts of ourselves that even romantic love cannot fulfill and we shouldn't fault anyone to have the desire and accountability to confront and fill that void, on their own overall, such a realistic and entertaining movie",14
1290,i love you,4
1291,"kathryn bernardo is such a good actor frl i think this is one of my favorite movies of hers, and alden richards is also a really good actor i like how the movie is about a filipino dh because it makes everything so much more real and its so sad because its real life ts is also sad asf and i cant wait for hello love again",-1

1301,i need a dog lover too where can i find one,-1
1302,"i think this movie wanted to be a lot of things it wanted to be an ofw story, a love story, and a filipino story the ending was a story trying to find a grip most of the time ofw stories have the same formula, one person jaded by reality, and another who yearns for something more it works wonders if done well, and the authenticity of this one really makes for an engaging world i left the movie knowing that i understood the filipino subculture that occurs overseas compared to movies like milan and barcelona i would love to see a version of this movie where joy doesn't have to leave because she's grown attached to the child and the grandmother and working hard for them is making up for the love she missed out on but it is an ofw story, and the family she serves will have to have some hostile moment to make us feel sympathetic to her cause will give it props that it didn't take the safe ending where ethan and joy meet somewhere and they'll both have it all their decisions have consequences, and i like that they accepted it in the end",2
1303,"hello, love, again prep",4
1304,i get it now tita hahahahaha kaya pala,0
1305,a quintessential movie about a breadwinner's struggle on her quest to achieve her dreams while providing for her family back home the contrast of joy's mom's story to hers shows that she dares to be different and wouldn't want to suffer the same fate having hong kong as the setting of the story enhances the experience this is also a good starter for people who wants to try filipino movies,2

1309,it's okay but kind of confusing at the same time,-1
1310,"my mom says we've seen this film before but i genuinely don't remember so naturally i watched this on my flight out of the philippines kathryn bernardo is such a wonderful actress, that woman can do anything just about any role and be successful in it she's so good in this that you can't help but feel for her character and the things she has to go through alden is also very charming and the little actions he does like how he moves closer to kathryn during the kitchen scene after he spent a night with his ex and she won't talk to him because she's jealous pero, and not to use therapy speak , ethan needs to go to therapy or do some self reflection before getting into another relationship as he clearly has attachment issues he was very clingy and tried to do everything he could to provide for her and, in turn, convince her to stay in hong kong to be with him despite her saying the entire time they were together that she wanted to go to canada and make use of her degree and do something with her life other than be a domestic helper there was even that moment when everything was falling apart for joy with her finding out that her mother doesn't intend on leaving her husband and her father not wanting to go to canada and ethan's response was essentially, maybe this is the universe telling you that you don't have to leave hong kong and you can just stay here with me like with that being said, though, the way ethan loves that's all",-1

1334,rating 8,-1
1336,"star cinema cathy garcia molina is always a good watch you can always expext a well produced, well written film that will captivate you from the start up to the end one of the things i appreciate the most in this movie is how the supporting characters, specifically their friend groups, brought life and entertainment to the movie while watching, i can't help but think how challenging to produce a filipino movie abroad i always notice the crowd looking or recoginizing the actors in the background it also ironic how a film shot abroad will make you feel that it is really a small world after all, the characters are always on the same places, casually bumping into each other too much while budget costraints are completely understandable, there is definitely a room for improvement overall, this movie did not fall short on giving you a classic romantic filipino movie experience, giving you the right amount of kilig while also touching into social and family issues",-1

1344,"i believe this was interesting enough as a movie about a struggling young filipina in a foreign country kathryn can really sell the idea that this is an end all be all situation for her that she is serious and wants more in life, the average ofw experience and that she convinced me that she is her character here she has versatility as an actress and i was delighted everytime i got to see more of her acting chops however i do find myself audibly groaning whenever alden was on screen and it makes this movie a chore to get through",13
1345,i think joy would've still thrived without his help he just messed her life up more by making her decide to stay in hong kong with him or follow her own dreams,4
1346,5 stars sana kung nagshave lang ng balbas si alden,0
1347,ugh i have watched this film before and this rating is a reflection of grown up me being able to finally form an elaborate opinion men ain't shit!! this was granted during the first viewing but it just hits diff now that i'm a bit older anw just rewatched bc the new one is coming out soon and i cannot wait to see the development of the main characters even though i know it's a filipino romcom recipe to always ends everything on a good note kathryn is so fucking mother!! i luv u queen mwah more projects to come pref w nadine lustre plsplsplspspl mabuhay ang mga ofw!! the sacrifices they make are often unseen by relatives back home and i forgot how accurate this movie tells us the story of an ofw who makes ends meet for her family while struggling to make her own dreams come true,-1

1408,"my comfort movie super love the plot of the film that revolves around ofws specifically in hongkong the 'limited' love ethan joy ang galing ng both actors in portraying their roles and rly so felt anyway plot of the film was written filmed so well walang labis, walang kulang so well and knowing the background behind the scenes on how they filmed, like lahat ng pinagdaanan to be able to achieve all these esp the emotions of the actors really tagos siya sa heart lol i can't wait for the part two of the movie where ethan follows joy in canada pero paano siya nakapasok pero so excited",15
1409,para akong si joy,0
1410,pinanood ulit after ng breakup ni dj at kath,0
1411,need ko ng another movie nito with just joy and her circle of friends pls,0
1412,never thought alden and kathryn would have a great chemistry,3
1413,so goof realistic ending i love it when women win,4
1414,"my mum turned on the tv and i fully expected her to put on a stereotypical cheesy filipino romcom where the man and the women have absolutely no flaws whatsover, the gay best friend 2 sassy women pushing her to step out of her comfort zone ending with the woman giving up on her hopes and dreams to be with the guy i was pulled in from the beginning this movie really resonated with me having grown up with a filipino immigrant mum and her community of ofw domestic helper friends in singapore in spite of all the pressure they faced to provide for their families at home, the abuse they may have faced from their employers, they were always so cheerful and somehow had the money to buy me gifts every once in a while the love and the culture i experienced growing up have shaped me into the person i am today and i will always be grateful girl, youre better than him thats whats stopping me from giving this movie a higher score tbh slightly forgivable given the other things i highly praised about but i loved the movies exploration of women and their responsibilites towards their family all over the world, women are the ones who leave their families, giving up on their dreams to work in an ass job in hopes of a better life many women work full time and are yet expected to hold down the fort at home and my heart breaks for these women, including my mum, who gave up on her dream of being a nurse in canada to be in singapore as a retail worker because she met a guy whom she would marry and have me mum, i know it is not my fault, but im sorry that you could not make it to canada one day i'll take you there, i promise",2
1415,sorry i don't love u too alden,4
1417,joy carried tbh,11
1418,"i first watched this on its showing week, i remember being excited to watch this kaya talagang tinotoo ko i was also curious about the dynamics i kept rewatching it even up to now kasi the spark is still there kathryns acting was always top tier, iba talaga kapag siya ang leading lady i loved how she portrays the hardship of our overseas filipino worker, not to mention that she graduated with a nursing degree yet pinili niya ang maging dh sa hongkong ginapang niya talaga, para magka pera i cant wait for the sequel this time around na set in canada na idk who will i love more, hongkong or canada na ba long live kathryn",0
1419,love you alden,4
1420,"this is literally my comfort movie idk but it feels like i have once in a position of joy somehow , that she always put everyone first i love how brave she is when she wants to go to canada even if she met someone who can possibly be a hindrance to her dreams i also love how ethan changed his mind to not stop joy for leaving he realized at the end that he trusts joy and they will cross their paths again",9
1421,one thing going for it besides an amazing female lead is its portrayal of overseas filipino workers as most ofw stories is heavily backed up by there willpower to provide for their family therefore giving a more touching and empowering feeling the film went on another direction that provided a sense of realism and emptiness it's mostly sad but it's mostly true film is a gem hidden under pretty big flaws sound and just the dynamic of the leads loved the chemistry though,2
1422,meh kathniel clears,10
1425,women who migrate you're all so brave,-1
1428,joy's family average filipino household lmao,2
1430,"all hail kathryn bernardo,,, so, im sorry, i dont love you real, also, i just found out about a sequel im jumping on it bc duh, kathryn bernardo, lol",8

1434,"the miss central 2019 scene that wasn't joy fabregas, that was kathryn bernardo",8
1435,alam naman na ni ethan na aalis si joy for canada tas pinipilit pa din niya yung gusto niya my god ang dami masyadong side stories i hate hate comedic reliefs in movies that are supposed to be angsty dude,0
1436,"classic filipino film, i liked it more than i thought i would, a realistic ending for a pair who dream of love and responsibility separately",2

1446,ahh hello sir maam,4
1447,"as part of our lunchtime movie binges, hello, love, goodbye is a that romantic drama that explores the complexities of love, ambition, and sacrifice among overseas filipino workers ofws in hong kong the film's realistic portrayal of the struggles and dreams of ofws resonates deeply, while the chemistry between the lead actors, kathryn bernardo and alden richards, is undeniable the heartfelt performances and emotional depth of the characters elevate the film beyond typical romance tropes, leaving a lasting impact on viewers",7
1448,"kathryn bernardo mustve been so tired for carrying the whole film throughout honestly after watching this film a handful of times, i realized that ethan would absolutely give me the ick if he would continue to do that, especially when joy already expressed that she is not interested with having any kind of relationship also i agree that joys story as an ofw had so much potential in the film anyway, kudos to kath for yet another amazing performancehoping that they wont butcher the sequel to this film",9
1449,pupunta na si joy sa canada,-1
1450,"napanood ko na to before pero okay din pala na panoorin ulit ngayon since dami nag bago, mas lumalim yung pag intindi ko sa movie, like sa buhay ng mga dh, kaya ayurn i can't help but to cry kasi naaawa me kay joy, nung 2019 kasi na ang bata ko pa, feel ko dun lang ako naka focus sa pagmamahalan nilang dalawa hahahahahahw putek na yan, tapos i realized din na ang pangit ng character ni ethan hahahahhuhuhwu pls bawi ho sa hla",0

1453,love the chemistry of these two,-1
1454,one of my go to movies i don't know why maybe i'm comforted by how the female lead chose her career herself over love maybe i see myself in her,-1
1456,more chemistry btwn kathy and alden than w her and danny unforch...,3

1460,"next to rewind, this is my favorite romantic filipino film it actually takes a nuanced look at love and relationships and how timing is really the most important part of it",2
1462,this movie taught me many things,1
1463,rewatched with my corny bf who just watched it for the first time and he kept cringing bc he can hear himself when alden drops his cheesy bars i think deserve,1
1464,"one of the better filipino made movies i've seen way too good, the integrated subtitles was a nice touch too since it was mostly shot outside of the philippines",2

1474,still v nice to see a kathden film hehehe,-1

1476,uhm bagay sila ngl,0
1478,i mishu ethan and joy,5
1481,"joy didn't brought joy to ethan's drifting life rather, she rekindled it i adore every line they threw, can't love be more than self sacrificing , each one of us has our own perception of love and that wonders me somewhere between those lines, it describes ethan's character he loves too much he left nothing for himself joy loves as much but left more for herself",5
1482,best actress award talaga si kath rito frvr,-1
1485,i was wondering if all filipinos guys are clingy bcs haha,-1

1488,it was a real movie,6
1489,love love love,4
1490,"this movie has my heart it puts us on a complete journey placing the audience in a disturbing phase, emotional phase and also gave us a comfort zone it was like watching two of our friends being in a relationship some of the dialogues are really simple but so cute some people might find these kind of films to be cringe but i feel like it's the perfect level that makes it not cringe beautiful film",1
1491,watched this w mom and tryna hold back my tears sa last scene by singing w moira also kathrynnn the actress that u areee,15
1492,"kathryn bernardo plays the hopeless pre med student who doesnt want to get involved in relationships but gets involved in one anyway role so wellethan is a textbook beige flag but for what its worth i liked the ending for a couple which consisted of a boy with abandonment and insecurity issues and a girl who just wants nothing but to pursue her dreams, id say this is a pretty realistic depiction of what their relationship is gonna bei love the ending ayun tlga nagpahila ng rating ko",-1
1493,"ang pagmamahal ba sa sakripisyo lang napapakita if i were to give my honest thoughts about this film, i'd say it was okay all of the dialogue stood on a very thin line between cheesy and charming which i could first tolerate but at some point, it kind of felt like that it was all that the movie did aka the weird fuckboy with stalker tendencies so yeah i wasn't really that fond of their love story but i really really really loved kath's character here she absolutely nailed this role and i felt like the movie would've benefitted more had it been all about her story instead of us constantly hearing of alden's character's pleads to make her stay when clearly, she wanted more but hey, for what it's worth, i really enjoyed seeing joy's growth as a character ' pass ako kay alden but i will forever be g for you kathryn",-1
1497,that scene when they were watching anak 2000 and kakais character sally asked if the only way for a woman to love effectively is through sacrifice,-1
1498,"so glad that kath choose to leave and not stay with him my gosh, red flag talaga but this was really a good movie tbh",3
1499,"may mga panahon talaga sa buhay natin na mas gusto nating piliin ang sarili over anything sa buhay mayroon namang panahon na mas minamahal natin ang isang tao kesa sa anumang bagay sa mundo at hinding hindi natin makakayang bitawin sila pero mas mahal ko ang sarili ko is a line that took the veins in my heart and placed it in my thoughts upang mas maiintindihan ko ang konsepto ng tunay na pag ibig maybe after all, people really do come and go in this reality dapat nating matuto kung paano mag hello sa bawat oportunidad para baguhin ang ating kinabukasan dapat nating matuto ang pagbibigay ng sapat na respeto at value sa sarili upang mabigyan natin ang isa't isa ng genuine love at higit sa lahat, dapat tayong matuto kung paano maglet go sa oras na pababayaan natin ang isang tao ngunit tayo'y humihiling ng matinong goodbye kahit napapabayaan na natin sila, ang emosyon at damdamin na naibibigay nila sa atin ay mananatiling tatak sa puso natin magpakailanman",0
1500,"i love how hopeful yet so realistic this movie isyes, you can find love in the most hopeless and tiring of times but reality will still always come knocking and its just up to you to choose one of katherines best acting in her career which was only amplified more by aldens charm grahh im so excited for the sequel",-1
1501,"live, laugh, goodbye is when i see alden's character",-1

1504,creepy ni alden haha si joy ang bigat ng dala ofw representation that was delivered well naman,0
1505,"also i know this ends off with a somewhat open ending, but theres no way ethan is faithful enough to wait for joy his character is reckless and brash, like dude legit has a tattoo of another womans name on his arm kathryn carried in acting though, and i hated aldens flirting",-1
1506,somebody take that raggedy ass bag way from kathryn please,10
1507,"i like how it is pretty mature although there are some aspects they can work on more lowkey cant imagine daniel padilla here, alden definitely made it his own speaking of, i like how everyone is in their element in making this, really putting their best in every scene lalo na si kath best work paren nya for me hopefully they nail the sequel huhuhuhuhuhu i would love to see the growth of these characters",3
1508,rewatched kasi pumogi si alden sa paningin ko nung nag break ang kathniel haha,0
1509,"i commend the film for tackling the themes it did the romance is the central force at work, but it is ultimately not everything hope kathryn and alden bring more maturity and perspective in the sequel",3

1523,laroooo hahaha love you,4
1524,"earnest depiction of the reality ofws face but the narrative and script between kathryn and alden felt forced and out of place with joy's story, i felt like it would've been better as a drama instead of a romance",3
1525,"i was finally able to watch this one because i had the free time and the utmost drive to do so no regrets, i can see why a lot of people loved this film the writing was just faultless, i loved every dialogue",1

1566,"maayos ang portrayal sa kalagayan ng mga migrant at ofw lalo na ang kalagayan ng filipino working class na nagsusumikap para lang mapakain ang kanilang pamilya at abutin ang pangarap marami man ang isyu sa usaping teknikal, ngunit sa tema at kwento magsisilbi itong inspirasyon sa mga pilipino sa pagtahak sa daan patungo sa kanilang pangarap mabuhay ang filipino working class",0

1570,5 is because of these hetero boys making fun of women in so many ways,5
1571,"watched this before during the pandemic and watched it again with my mom kasi ngayon lang daw niya mapapanood haha also dahil nga may confirmed sequel na ilalabas, it's better to watch it now para fresh padin sa utak lol while i love the romance in this story, i can't help but applaud joy's perseverance as an ofw woman and as an eldest daughter it's not easy being both at the same time i'm glad she chose herself first, as most women like her mother isn't always given the chance moreover, i also applaud that the struggles in the movie are what most women with dreams and aspirations ofw workers go through this highlights and raises awareness more about the life of our nanay, ate, lola, tita overseas anyways, love the movie",0
1573,buti nalang binuhat ng character ni kathryn buti nalang din pogi ka alden medyo nacringe ako nung first part jdhshahahahahaja boset ang daming movements ni alden,0
1574,5 is because nagexist si ethan sa movie,0
1576,normal people golagat,0
1577,"with the announcement of hello, love, again, its was time yet again for me to visit this romcom gold mine and for this second viewing, i have seemed to appreciate it a half star more the operatic, dramatized monologues and back and forths between joy and ethan have grown in me i felt their words better than last time, somehow, and though i understand that these types of writing were manufactured to emit such reactions from the audience, i cannot deny the goosebumps y tingling sensation i felt during such dramatic scenes the performances i still find amazing, the dramatic scenes punched hard, the romantic scenes were cheesy but sweet, and the funny side characters were wholesome ly funny i did say last time that this was problematic, which if looking at it at one side, it is, but i think it was necessary to further enhance the stakes and to give the characters more reason to go or not to go ahead with their decisions this problematic element is not in any harmful way being glorified, thus its usage increases the dramatic structure of the story and gives justification to the dramatic choices, thus giving layer to the characters and their inner selves ive also come to appreciate some tiny details the montage like cutting was very effective in building the world and the budding relationship maricel laxa played her short appearances amazingly the final exchange between the leads was greatly implied like their wedding vows and surprisingly, i didnt hate the endless kung di rin lang ikaw in the background reading the logline for the sequel, i really hope they dont fumble it, they have something special here",9
1578,rewatched in light of sequel news,1
1579,i love love,4
1580,"i had to rewatch this kasi may sequel na raw and gaaadd, this is a love letter for our kababayans sa ibang bansa mahusay palagi ng linyahan ng star cinema hindi ko siya totally magets as 18 year old self pero ngayon na nasa adulting phase na ko, mas nakuha ko na ang sacrifices ni joy i will not hold you back hits different now after ng breakup so excited for kath alden's comeback",0
1584,"you know what its actually pretty good for the most part i still wouldve preferred a slightly different ending that still retains joy getting to follow her dreams of moving to canada, but color me surprised even with the positive reactions, i didnt hate this im so sorry , its a great decision to actually have him learn rather than have men like him win in the story even if they are actually wrong script wise, for one, i am aware that this is a romance film but i ended up being more interested in the ofw subplot i have merely seen the trailer of sunday beauty queen but parts of this instantly reminded me of that film some may say that the film already needed more time dedicated to the romance plot but i wish it was a little more consequential to tie itself to its ofw subplot there are some good shots with impressive lighting here and there, yet they are never consistent as there are also shots that are too overexposed and poorly lit for my liking i am aware that the motifs in the score would always be based off of a mainstream song, but having heard kung 'di rin lang ikaw even months before this film's initial release high school tingz , i find it to be a little overplayed at some points oh, and louder music doesn't always mean more emotional impact still, i guess the film's biggest redeeming point is its direction yes, it's a mainstream romance film, but it offers different flavor through its more mature approach spotty dialogue aside, the more emotional scenes work well on their own and never feel forced, even if they are a little too on the nose i did not feel the chemistry of kathryn bernardo and alden richards at first, but damn it, kathryn can carry hard she just knows how to ground her character so well without making it feel superficial some people are probably tired of the comedic 'sidekick' best friend s of the lead female character but i personally found kakai bautista to be hilarious not all of her jokes land, but when they do, it's absolutely funny the vilma santos scene probably got the loudest laugh out of me and holy fuck, i knew that was jameson blake playing peter everything said here may have come across as if the negatives outweight the positives but hello, love, goodbye is thankfully saved by garcia sampana's no longer garcia molina honest direction and bernardo's strong acting perhaps its approach to showing the ofw life in hong kong can be shallow, but it's a good first step to bringing that story tied with its main romance plot into a mainstream filipino film by utilizing the appeal of the two leads from their own different loveteams to tell a new romance story, it gets its point across effectively once the credits have rolled, i was relieved that i did not hate it, even if it's not quite my thing i havent heard ikaw at ako in so long high school has officially been very long ago for me and i had no idea it would play here, nor have i known that i would hear j 0n m rv fuck ethan lol thank god joy questioned her place in his plans bc even i was thinking about the fact that he only ever thought about himselfedit nawt them announcing a sequel as soon as i posted this review lmaoooooo",-1
1585,"alam mo joy sobrang saya ko, nag varial bidyo ko hiling ko sana makuha ako ni jisica soco, para masabi ko sa buong mundo na ikaw ang mahal ko dahil ikaw laman isip at puso ko, alam mo joy aym pooling inlab with you di ko talaga move on sayu joy, ikaw kasi ih nakain mo itlog ko na luto ko tuwing umaga ikaw talaga laman isip puso ko joy sana masaya kana",0

between her joy dreams obligation hello love goodbye reminds me of kita kitahello love goodbye could've followed the cinematic style and storytelling structure of kita kita to be a great film kathryn bernardoalden richards is comparable with alessandra de rossi empoy marquez kathden alempoyif only direk sigrid bernardo be the director instead of cathy garcia molinahello love goodbye could've been a great, well made and well treated film the film lays out an interesting and compelling plot as well as a kathryn bernardo main character as joy that we would all sympathize and root for the concept of spiritually living in transit in a strange foreign land working hard to make a desired reality happen one day is the film's conceit that really hits hard to all of us in this modern, demanding and even depriving world we are living in, we are all racing against time to reach our desired goals in life or else we would never achieve it this is pretty smart stuff for a filipino ofw story we always watch filipino films about ofws where the ofw main character always sacrifices his her life and personal well being to fulfill his her responsibilities to the family he she left behind in the philippines this is a long worn out story and we had enough of it hello love goodbye turns the table around instead of highlighting the selfless sacrifice of a typical filipino ofw, the film smartly tackles an examination of a lonely ofw's existence in a foreign land balancing what he she really likes against what he she is supposed to do i believe hello love goodbye opens this paradigm which really hooks my attention and root for the story kita kita almost touches this ingenious examination of ofw but never gets there as direk sigrid bernardo never intends to portray such theme direk cathy garcia molina since my perfect you , the hows of us and three words to forever is exploring and digging further her creative mind in coming up with ingeniously joyous filipino stories while keeping that worn out and obsolete star cinema filipino family rom com formula hello, love, goodbye is kathryn bernardo at her best so far good thing she escapes and breaks off from the tight bound clutches of her constant leading man, daniel padilla therefore, kathryn bernardo is truly free as an actress and as a woman without daniel padilla at her side, kathryn bernardo did not fall down but instead rose higher than what she used to be just as an eye candy amateur teeny bop damsel of a brute teenage heartthrob debonair kathryn bernardo as joy in hello love goodbye successfully and convincingly emulates the existential crisis a filipino ofw has to face as she braves working in transit in a strange foreign land while examining her choices and personal well being in life there is a strong libertarian take on hello love goodbye that makes me like the film at first and kathryn bernardo's great acting make that happen loud and bright on the big sm cinema big screen again, this is smart stuff and kathryn bernardo as joy would be one of the most striking filipino movie characters that i have watched at least on the film's strong first hour alden richards plays ethan who is more of a sassy comic relief yet effective mpdg for kathryn bernardo as joy his character as ethan started out as a male creep stalking kathryn bernardo as joy in a misogynist distasteful manner that even senator risa hontiveros would never approve of i guess direk cathy garcia molina is trying to make a daniel padilla out of alden richards with daniel padilla always bullying or tormenting kathryn bernardo for her to love him direk cathy may safe spaces law na tayo thanks to senator risa hontiveros but i really do not mind alden richards portraying as a sex crazy playboy luring kathryn bernardo into a one night stand i believe his flawed character gives merit to the powerful first hour and what hello love goodbye is supposed to be but i do wonder if direk cathy garcia molina inject that sex maniac character flaw for the male mpdg to justify that one night stand motel scene seems direk cathy and the filipino masses are really after kathryn bernardo shoving her face to alden richard's bare muscular chest i actually like the unusual pairing of the troubled serious kathryn bernardo with the carefree hypersexual alden richards this unusual pairing reminds me of alexandra de rossi and empoy marquez of kita kita the kathden dynamic in hello love goodbye could have been a more improved, more substantial version of alempoy in kita kita kathryn bernardo and alden richards interacting in hello love goodbye is similar to those sassy asian chinese, japanese, korean teenage romcoms that i get to watch on hbo red channel only, the kathden may be something more meaningful than a unusual campy romantic sexual pairing the first half of hello love goodbye really sets us up for a promising story that i am eager to watch hello love goodbye starts well the film establishes an interesting, heartfelt ofw story, introduces a charismatic, relatable and empowering female kathryn bernardo lead character and builds up an uncanny yet endearing relationship between kathryn bernardo and alden richards depriving and robbing us of a great story to unravel from an inspiring, heartfelt and empowering ofw story on the first hour hello, love, goodbye suddenly drops everything and shifts into a cheesy standard bloated star cinema romcom love story with lots of these shit 1 instant falling in love that does not feel earned and 4 speedy resolutions that does not make a big impact to the hearts and minds of the audience so cathy garcia molina still adopts her standard star cinema family romcom formula into the promising hello love goodbye story even when the film does not really need it we are deprived of watching a great story until the end in hello, love, goodbye the typical star cinema family romcom formula that direk cathy garcia molina is fond to insert is not bad always this overused family formula does work well for some of the following cathy molina's films 1 you changed my life starring sarah geronimo and john lloyd cruz2 my perfect you starring gerald anderson and pia wurtzbach and 3 the hows of us starring kathryn bernardo and daniel padilla this star cinema romcom formula which thrills the filipino masses, unfortunately causes a big void at the 2nd half of the real promising story of hello love goodbye including hello, love, goodbye as its latest casualty the audience never gets to watch the real, more heartfelt ofw story of kathryn bernardo as joy and her libertarian existential adventures with alden richards as ethan just like any other typical star cinema filmshello love goodbye is so bloated although she has a charming potential to have an pinay hk ofw movie of her own alden richards as ethan's personal existential struggle may not be necessary but should not be emphasized as much as the struggles of kathryn bernardo as joy alden and kathryn's friends should never overstay their welcome to the real story maxine medina is a beautiful yet useless distraction to the movie the real story does not even require for ethan and joy to madly fall in love and become sassy sweethearts finally, the interesting sub story of maricel laxa as joy's mother who is forced to marry a foreigner to secure a resident's visa is so not explored further i assume that cathy garcia molina intend to portray the over glamorized 2nd hour to be ethan and joy's existence in the now but hello, love, goodbye redeemed itself on the last 15 minutes of the film it is actually the real resolution to the existential ofw crisis that both kathryn bernardo and alden richards are facing hello, love, goodbye could have worked if its 2nd hour is a more serious, more composed, yet truly heartfelt intelligently memorable adventures solely between kathryn bernardo as joy and alden richards as ethan both would continue to explore their libertarian existence together either as lovers or bffs as they continue to work their asses off in hong kong, they continue to examine their existence, wants, needs, priorities and obligations and that is where their prospect about love in the world of constant demands and uncertainties take place all other supporting characters interact at their minimum as the real hello love goodbye story is soley focused on alden and kathryn this is how the movie should be if it were serious enough to be a great movie i guess hello love goodbye could've worked if it follows the story and cinematic style of kita kita i do wish cathy garcia molina consulted with sigrid bernardo on how to make hello, love, goodbye work rather than making a great movie which is a worthy follow up to the great quezon's game movie 9 10 as hello, love, goodbye is an exhibition of kathryn bernardo at her bestalden richards at first plays a convincing effective uncanny free spirited character worthy of a companion for kathryn bernardo with this, alden richards still performs his best in his previous film, imagine you and me as direk mike tuveria really puts alden's talent to good use to make the aldub film work somehow but its strength is its middle part which kathryn bernardo and daniel padilla exhibits that magical romantic feeling artfully around an old house that is really glamorously teasing our emotions but it didn't damage the story for its mid scene is awesome the first half and the last 15 minutes of the film are gold in the story",7
1598,"you can look past through the sappy by it being filled with palpable ofw stories and heartfelt moments of almost every character that scene when joy sees her nursing classmate having his honeymoon in hk, then is asked what is she doing there, what a tearjerker it has many subplots about family, self worth, career, and brief encounters that can stand alone, but their sum is a surprising and refreshing experience so much better when rewatched",-1
1599,"its actually good there were parts of the plot that would make a better, stand alone film such as joy and her mother, the tricks for survival for filipino dhs in hk, among others it was understandable that the movie fell for the blockbuster dilemma but in total, i can see how the writing process was thorough, impressive, and a tad frustrating",2
1600,"it's the specificity that i enjoyed the most there have been many movies about the ofw experience, but this one roots itself in the particulars of the hong kong domestic helper they're women who have made the great sacrifice to be separated from their families for the sake of potential economic prosperity they are given work, certainly, but they aren't free to seek other work joy is pursuing a dream, seeking a life beyond being the absent breadwinner for a family that doesn't feel her suffering and because she wants more, she can't just stay within the very limited lines of her existence, risking arrest and deportation just to scrape together enough money to find a means to a better existence in the margins, we see the internalized tragedy of a people convinced that this is somehow an acceptable situation veteran domestic helpers constantly telling a neophyte that she'll get used to this life, a phone call back home that's about having to extend a contract another two years and at the center, we learn about joy's mother, whose tragic situation exemplifies the commodification of the filipino woman, and the trauma that it brings the relationship stuff is less specific ethan fits into the playboy made good archetype a lothario who develops real feelings for a girl because she initially rejects him, and then seems to tirelessly pursue her despite her consistent pleas for him to stop it's cute and stuff, but it feels like a distraction from the genuinely incisive examination of the hong kong ofw situation but none of that erases all the good that the film does even as the romance takes the fore, the movie is smart enough to make it all feel burdened by the tragedies inherent to a people who have resigned themselves to the reality of a home that can no longer be their home also, kathryn bernardo is great in this joy is a fully formed character an industrious young woman who has deferred her dreams under the pretense of a necessary selflessness, struggling under the weight of responsibility all while learning sad truths that will come to shatter her conception of the life she's been pursuing there's a lot going on there, and bernardo just takes it all in and makes it work good stuff",2
1601,my favorite part of the movie was when maymay entrata did an interpretative dance and ended her routine with a kamehameha,1
1603,"siguro nasanay lang talaga tayo na si dj ang kasama ni kath at si maine naman kay alden kaya medyo may 'off' feeling sa simula, especially sa part kung saan nag meet yung characters nina joy at ethan pero aminin niyo, habang lalong tumatagal, mayroon siyang refreshing feeling as a kathniel fan since 2012 growing up days, ganern , sobrang proud ako kay kathryn...",0
1604,"one of the best filipino romantic dramas ive seen in a while it has to be said that the movie is of its time it has many layers that reveal much about the current social, cultural, economic, and political landscape it moves you to redefine what it means to truly love someone its definitely more than just a love story",2
1605,"i love that the characters for this movie arent that toxic that somehow, despite being very vulnerable and emotional, they are practical and still uses their heads to make decisions progress ito for a star cinema film hahahhmm ganda ni kathryn pero may times na i feel she moves too much to project that shes tired pero ung mga subtle expressions and movements is a go for me alden, get dingdong dantes acting coach baka itll help you more tama na po ang john lloyd actingan guysh hahaha i must say chemistrys there love the set of girls tho kasi on the on set im rooting for kathryns character na come on come through kween",15
1606,"i chickened out of a midnight screening of midsommar and caught this one instead but i was surprised because this one wasnt a walk in the park tooit dropped some heavy emotional bombs with grace though i liked it as a whole hell yeah but it was good because it was honest honest is beautiful well acted, too i cried lots and they portrayed the ofw life honorably and respectfully, i think never underestimate an ofws plight as an immigrants kid, i deeply appreciated how this film didnt shy away from the messy parts of life away from ones home countrythe ugly parts of choosing to be displaced for some years in hopes of saving enough to build a better life for others who might not even deserve it i liked the subtle commentaries no hints of self righteousness and you cant help but root for them because of that i love films that do this remind you of the cheesiness and beauty of being human of falling in love, of owning pain, of being honest about hurting, of independence and codependency, of giving and dreaming",-1
1607,actually enjoyed this the side stories with their own families gave this good depth,-1
1608,75 stars,-1
1609,"i fell in love with this film it is a tear jerker, heartfelt movie mga twice akong umiyak ewan ko ba bakit relate na relate ako kay ethan baka pareho lang kami talaga ng personality, perspective about love yung willing ibigay ang lahat in the name of love salamat cgm for another worth na movie ang ganda niya in fairness",0
1610,"hello, love, goodbye starts with joy played by kathryn bernardo saying something like, in hongkong we don t waste time because every second counts and every second we are payed the film works best when it follows this premise when joy acts as the kayod lang ng kayod breadwinner of the family and when she desperately searches for ways to support her dream of flying to canada to seek a job and follow her passion a different cathy garcia molina filmthis film is envisioned to be like one of the remarkable classic ofw films in the past like dubai , and milan fortunately, the film doesn t settle for that vision alone it raises the story, nuanced to experiences by domestic helpers based in hong kong, where it is illegal to take another job aside from being a dh it also digs deeper, creating a more compelling and informative story about the overseas filipino workers in hong kong to this end, the film may be given credit for its thorough research the middle stumblesit could have been great if the film lived up to that premise and made that nuanced hong kong experience as it s core, but instead it uses the romantic narrative as a way to effectively communicate with its audience just when ethan comes into the picture, familiar filipino movie production processes and cliches come into play the slight resurrectionthankfully, all the second part craze undos itself in the film s last few minutes here, the struggles of both joy and ethan are discussed and are powerfully put together to give the film a compelling touch, grounded to the themes presented in the film s opening the last few minutes of the film however still feels like a long music video only this time, it s disguised as a travelogue although, it is in this long sequence where the most delightful shots are shown, it kind of feels just like a long compilation of tourist vlogs rather than an essential part of the story another resurrection comes at the film s last minute it brilliantly presents the resolution, bringing it to a powerful last shot reminiscent to that of alfonso cuaron s roma , but more explicitly told the best of kathryni never thought i would say this, but this is definitely kathryn s film though this is her most daring and demanding role yet, she perfectly portrays joy s desperation, desire, and inherent sadness this performance is her all time best and i can, with no doubt say that it is something that should seriously be considered by the country s award giving bodies alden richard s ethan however feels like a character that was written for kathryn s on screen partner, daniel padilla despite this, alden richards still plays the role with heart unlike kathryn s role, ethan is not a dramatically demanding character inconsistently goodsometimes, hello, love, goodbye struggles to cope up with it s promising premise at one point it proudly flaunts it s technical excellence, and the next thing you see, a drone is randomly used to show a scene where the main characters are running on a rooftop this film has a lot of potential, in all honesty despite this, it still should be regarded as a cinematic achievement as it presents a raw aspect of the difficult life abroad despite being a studio made film",7
1611,cathy garcia molina has revitalized her storytelling voice a good mix of crowd pleasing moments and hard to swallow truths the film didnt pull any punches it left me gushing and gut wrenched at the same time,13
1612,idagdag pa rito ang isang satisfying at hindi toxic na pagresolba sa issue nila sa pelikula,0
1613,"never have i ever watched a filipino movie with the same typical couple until this came out, and this is one of the reasons why it was extraordinary they had definitely given the audience another chemistry and vibe to maybe spice things up and break that notion of having the same couple on screen however, what really made this movie so good is its plot every bit of its scene mirrors the reality of life and through that, true love is depicted in the story you may bump into some cheesy and corny lines, but you could quite see how the two leads were able to emulate the vibes of filipinos if you're not into romantic type of movies, don't worry you can still relate to it in some other perspective love can also be expressed in a platonic way so, this is definitely a must watch",2
1614,"as someone whos so soft, idk how many times this movie made me cry",-1
1615,"hello, love, goodbye is a film i didn't expect to like i went to the cinema with a passive indifference to pass the time, yet i was utterly blown away once the opening montage scene started it reminded me of the claustrophobic isolation and weariness of chungking express, which also took place in hong kong i thought to myself that it wasn't a bad start at all and it piqued my interest, hoping it manages to be consistently good throughout and it did the portrayal of domestic helpers is realistic it doesn't go all the way to make it a tragic story, to the point of being depressing, as it manages to be hopeful at times with frequent lighthearted moments i have a soft spot for stories about ofw struggles being a child of an ofw, i've witnessed various injustices prevalent in the ofw community the movie brings to light several of them, and they hit home surprisingly, i didn't find the romance corny at all kathryn bernardo and alden richards both come from different well established love teams, and i was initially skeptical that a chemistry between them wouldn't work however, they manage to exceed expectations as they bring the best out of each other kathryn portrayed the role of joy convincingly as a struggling domestic helper trying to make ends meet and realize her dreams alden portrayed the role of ethan as your typical playboy, but he manages to bring out enough nuance to an honestly flawed character escaping the ghosts of his past the cinematography is decent, providing enough satisfactory camera angles to capture the scenic hong kong backdrop the script is pretty standard for a cathy garcia molina film but sufficiently witty, sappy, and genuine all at once the score is average but serviceable certain scenes could've had more emotional impact and tension without the dramatic music despite that, it's not distracting when you have two lead characters pouring their heart out in their respective roles to conclude, hello, love, goodbye isn't just a typical straightforward romance film for me it had enough going on in its story to be engaging while being paced well enough the chemistry is there, and i must admit that the movie touched me in a way that other of its contemporaries haven't ultimately what resonated with me most in this particular film is how it addresses love in the most honest and vulnerable way possible every subplot is instrumental and significant to the film's conclusion, making a brutal yet optimistic statement that i rarely see in romance stories in general",7
1618,"very simple and straighforward it put a spotlight on the hardships of pinoy ofws its sometimes heartbreaking but youll find beauty in those moments, too props to alden for pulling this one off im so happy to see him in these kinds of projects gone are the super pilit love team stories i would want him to work with mikhail red next and of course, kathryn this film is hers",-1
1619,natuwa ako kasi iba na yung naging ka love team ni kath and tbh this performance is understandable na kasi first time niya nga na hindi si daniel yung katandem,0

1621,acting skills are on point this movie deserves your time,-1
1622,"my expectations for this were high because of the praise it has been getting, and it does not disappoint beyond the romance blossoming between the two leads, this shows the hardships and difficulties of life while living as an ofw oversees filipino worker the limited choices and the sacrifices the characters have to endure kathryn bernardo gives a stellar performance as joy and this is possibly her best performance to date she is clearly supported by her male co star who reciprocates her performance though bernardo is the center of the story usually its the woman who ends up self sacrificing for love, or the issues of the man are not addressed while giving the couple their happy ending this played out perfectly it was sensible and realistic there was no gimmick, and the direction their relationship headed addressed the situation the leads were in this is one for the books also kudos to the cinematographer and the writer",-1
1623,"kathryn's performance here was quintessential kathryn, kathryn on the hows of us was really the best i have seen from her the way the film presented his character and how we got to know him better was very effective may i just note that joross gamboa's performance here was so hilarious like, as in sobrang benta ng jokes na kahit ano nalang din siguro lumabas sa bibig niya ay nakakatawa rito story wise, what i really did like was it didn't romanticize the hardships of our ofws, it presented the harsh reality of working outside the country kathryn really captured it the film wasn't really the dark, heavy drama ish film but it made me reflect on the privileges that i have and shouldn't take for granted last note, sana mapalitan 'yung chroma part sa last scene choz",3
1624,this movie will prove that the tangent line kind of relationship fate exists you might be meeting exactly once but you can still make great moments from it so so so film,-1
1625,"a young filipino woman working in hong kong meets a young bartender she's about to complete her contract and go to greener pastures in canada and it's by cathy garcia molina, so seeing her name normally makes me go to the opposite direction, having seen a few of her past films but this one, to her credit, has a bit more substance there's a compelling drama here about the plight of overseas filipino workers ofw's but blended with the formulaic romantic dramedy that is her bread and butter they do the usual hugot emotional romantic scene in the end where they telegraph every emotion through overly written emotional speeches each trying to out romance each other but it's still a solid drama before that",2
1626,"a breath of fresh air it's funny and sweet and heartbreaking without trying so hard i especially love the fact that it doesn't revolve around ethan and joy, but mostly around ofws their life outside kath is amazing as always 1 and you can really feel her every emotion in each scene i love how she knows where she's going and how she's gonna get it also i loved the tour around hk the shots where ethan and joy weren't the focus and they were just in the corner, giving the spotlight to hk's sights thank u team dog eyes",9
1627,i will always believe i'm the love child of ethan and joy,5
1628,"if there's one thing the movie can really boast about, it's the strength of the acting between its two leads kathryn bernardo acted her heart out in this you can literally feel the sweat, desperation and exhaustion her character endures in her stint as a domestic helper in hong kong at this point, she proved that she can carry a movie all by herself alden richards also proved here that he came a long way from his pabebe aldub days his acting definitely improved and was pretty solid overall although i did have a problem with how the relationship started in the first half alden really was a straight up stalker, wasn't he , the movie redeemed itself after, not just with how the relationship was ultimately executed, but the execution of the film's central message of how loving yourself over everything else is not necessarily a selfish thing there's definite chemistry between the two of them, and given how successful the movie is critically and financially speaking, i'm looking forward to their next movie together another thing that i really like is that without getting into spoilers the movie could had easily ended in a traditional happy ending but they chose not to, instead delving more into an ending that is whilst bittersweet, much more grounded and admirable it made the movie had so much more of an impact at the end and i already really dug the last ten minutes so that was something hopefully star cinema does keep up this surge of quality and care in its films i mean, it's not a stunning innovation per se, but it's a noticeable improvement in quality coughs vice ganda coughs if there's one thing to be learned from this movie, it's that filipino audiences do are starting to care on the quality of their local mainstream films, and less on cheap laughs and hollow kilig moments",13
1629,"its both nice and scary how this movie was so grounded in its portrayal of how class struggle seeps in and plays out into peoples lives an all around great cast loved the supporting kathryn fucking killed it with one, and so did alden, if not without his cheesy one liners but oh well you gotta deal with what youre handed with",3

1646,"by far, the best cathy garcia molina movie in my opinion surprisingly, kathryn and alden definitely have a chemistry, even if they were in different tv stations cgm really squeezed these two leads to their boundaries to deliver an outstanding movie that is well loved by the fans, the non fans and the critics it's not that over the top drama but the supporting actors really did all of that it's a signature cgm move the supportive, loud, hilarious friends can be quite an eye and ear sore the realism of the story is the selling point of this one aside from the lead actors and it's perfectly portrayed and captured you can feel the hardships, the pain, with or without experiencing it, it will hit you very hard a sequel may or may not be needed but i'm very satisfied on how it ended change is good and we need more movies like this",13

1649,"i'll be the first to admit that i dismiss kathryn as an actress simply because 1 she is half of the kathniel love team and i just find them so cliche and the typical pinoy media play just doesn't do it for me anymore 2 i gave her and daniel a chance went i watched the hows of us with friends last year and i spent the whole time cringing and regretting my decision to be there 3 i prefer jadine because i feel they are more genuine and, basically, just more real i don't dismiss the entire filipino entertainment industry, fyi got dragged into this with friends i had low expectations given my last movie experience with kathryn, but i gave it a chance because daniel wasn't in it and i thought maybe it would be a little better somehow i like alden, but i didn't really know how his acting chops were i was pleasantly surprised by how the film turned out the plot was honestly a bit predictable but it generally somehow felt more real and refreshing than other filipino rom coms i appreciate this very much, given the number of stereotype filipino films coming out in the last x years alden was great, and i look forward to his next projects i'm sure he'll get more offers after this his pairing with kathryn, i'm sure, has done wonders for his career since this came out i still think she has a lot of growth maturing to do in terms of her acting my preference, at least , but seeing this film really changed my opinion of her at least half of it, i suppose definitely still prefer jadine, and definitely won't be voluntarily watching out for whatever she does next, but she has one less hater in me",3

1664,"hello, love, goodbye is a classic in the making the perfect blend of the familiar pinoy romcom formula and its modern evolution it provides an unfiltered and modern ofw story that transcends the glitz and glamour of being in a foreign country, tied together with a love story that could be all too familiar for millennials who are trying to find their place in the world its the best work yet coming from both kathryn bernardo and alden richards, as well as from directing and writing duo cathy garcia molina and carmi g",7
1665,ah yes the classic harrassing a girl until she falls in love methodby far the best scene throughout the whole thing was the competition that happened out of nowhere so the writers could introduce the love interest's successful ex the comedy,1

1670,a filipino movie thats not corny and cliche it showed real life struggles of overseas workers who are far away from their family i loved the ending and how bitter sweet it was it couldve been more daring though the cinematography was also nice i think hong kong as the location helped bring the movie to another level,2

1678,"saw this latest star cinema drama and i wish i could say i loved it true, its a marked improvement from the typical rom coms the studio is famous for but still, despite its spotlight on a subculture of filipino expatriates living as quasi citizens residents of hongkong, it is still saddled by the usual storytelling cliches and harrowing contrivances that makes the film less involving and feels a tad bit manufactured the movie tells the story of ethan and joy who meets in hongkong at a wrong time in their lives she is trying to get away from hongkong and live her dream in canada while he is trying to reestablish his roots and his relationship with his family in the island after a failed relationship in the us its a good setup but it was not unfortunately sustained when the narrative decided to give more time on cutesy scenes featuring the usual go to best friends that may be permanently engraved at every screenplay thats greenlit by star cinema bosses and i observed one very sad thing about the movie i understand that the intention is good but this movie seems to be telling us that families, at least in the vision of the filmmakers, are the modern day representation of talangka filipino mentality in this movie, they seem to get, however unintended, in the way of the dreams, ambitions and happiness of the main protagonists even if the portrayal depicts the age old child sacrificing all for family disclosure i saw the brilliant film the farewell one day before this film and i may have been unfairly influenced by it into expecting that all films could be just as good this movie was a quick wake up call that not all movies are good no matter how well intentioned they are",2

1680,"very formulaic and nothing new from what you've seen from star cinema, however, alden and kathryn have such great chemistry that they make it work more than it should their acting is great even if its surrounded by a pretty cliche storyline",3
1681,"hello, love, goodbye review hello, love, goodbye is a film about a domestic helper in hong kong her name is joy kathryn bernardo in her last four months in hong kong, she met a guy named ethan alden richards and at first, she is making him go away because she is finding money for the paper works to be submitted to the canadian embassy and not a friend or a relationship but ethan persevered and joy falls in love with him in this film, we can see the conflict in choosing between love or dream, their own conflicts as a character and the hard work and sacrifice of an ofw overseas filipino worker first of all, why are there many films coming out in the philippines about adult rom com i dont know why but all of them is a box office hit it is well and good that they showed the harsh reality of the life of an ofw as a family of an ofw, it is sad for us as big as forgetting to fetch their children at school to as little as forgetting to take the trash out there are a lot of stories happening at once, but they resolved everything at the end these stories are a gateway to show the main characters internal conflict not just between them comedy is on point just as expected with joross gamboa not too many and not too few, just the right amount of spice also, there are too many cliche moments, but it worked out well without me cringing this is one of the filipinos illness when it comes to films they are too afraid of just letting the visual tell the story they did not let the audience think instead they laid it all out for us i hope that they overcome this fear and let the visual tell the story im also glad that they used the original artists songs and not just cover it it sets the mood rather than someone covering it lastly, cinematography is meh, okay but i can forgive this one because they shot this entirely in hong kong with some parts here in the philippines overall, i give this film a 7 10 film can be improved by deducting some parts, cut down their lines in half and let the visuals tell the story although, acting is on point, i think star cinema can squeeze more out of alden richards cinematography can also be improved by using tripods, stabilizers and a professional drone operator some aerial shots are jittery this is your typical love, dream and family story but they added the hardships of being an ofw",7
1684,"i specifically love the beginning of the film of course kathryn bernardo is a phenomenal actress and she immediately caught the audience's sympathy a loving daughter and reliable older sister ethan, on the other hand, is on the other end of the line a cute bartender with flings and hook ups on hand what happens when he met joy although it does have some sappy 'romantic' scenes and lines that i felt like sinking to my seat due to undeniable discomfort, this is indeed a romantic movie for everyone and cliches are not cliches if they never work anyway, the movie is good both actors have great chemistry but then again, i think kathryn bernardo could fit well with anyone alden richards has never been more handsome in my eyes of course, the funny bestfriends for mere comic relief kakai bautista is hilarious to no surprise 5 star para sa pintong padabog na isinara pero walang tunog",-1
1685,"i love the sincere portrayal of the specific ofw experience of domestic helpers in hong kong the romance wasn't new ground, but still relatively mature within filipino sensibilities but the nail in the coffin for this film the tears wouldn't stop flowing as i thought about my tita in france who lives her life pretty closely to joy's",2
1686,"this film did not make hongkong as a tourist ad just like the other films that went abroad to shoot definitely carmi raymundo's best screenplay, yet and kathryn bernardo's best performance, simula pa lang pinanghawakan ko na yung karakter niya at ibang iba siyad dito kumpara sa mga ginampanan niya noon",2

1690,"watching this as a filipino who is also outside my home country really hits a lot of places from working a job you never really saw yourself, to having to want to think for yourself what i envy the most with the characters is that they have dreams that they really want and pursue it also shows how this millenia is about thinking for yourself but not forgetting how to look back and cherish people back home",2
1691,"im quite happy that it showed a slice of how difficult it is to be a filipina far from home loved the storytelling although some dialogue felt too much yexxz we get it already u two love each other so muchhhh yas squeez in all the quotable quotes but sometimes u gotta know when to hold back and just let the silence fill in the moments nonetheless, i loved the way it ended here's to doing something about your dreamscheers to local movies",2

1704,the title says it all,6
1705,"i didn't expect to like the movie this much, yet here we are it deserves all the praise it's been getting some dialogues felt a bit cliche and that acting direction in one scene felt too calculated but the two leads were still great, nonetheless kath and alden played their characters with endearing wit and charm, as their oddities make their interactions raw and believable what i really like about hlg is that as it goes along it feels riveting on a simplistic scale, it becomes expressive of our own feelings the theme is on the idea of love almost didnt work for me , but the direction pulls in the audience through its characters i am every bit of ethan and joy i work overseas but i have so much to be thankful for that i am not a breadwinner, no responsibilities aside from myself and i have a job that i wanted for myself movies are indeed powerful this made me more appreciative of the life i have now its good and a privilege, therefore i should not take it for granted",3

1722,filipino romcoms just cant shy away with all the cheesiness but as a soon to be ofw i feel like i related to kathryns joy too much in a way that i have to chase this dream its all or nothing so this movie really spoke to me in that aspect,-1
1724,"your typical troubled boy falls for a bright young girl themed romance a walk to remember a grease a say anything cathy garcia molinas hello love, goodbye discovers puppy love in its purest form it has plot and spiels topped with cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan, cottage, and blue cheese pairing kathryn bernardo and alden richards is a genius move this film showcased how good actor each of them is of course, we do not forget the supporting cast because they added extra entertainment and drama the movie never failed to give a sense of claustrophobic feeling of alienation and loneliness in a developed world the very reason why i think portrayal of maymays character was so realistic it is a good movie with great acting, average screenplay, and story topped with layers of cliches from the romantic drama genre",13
1725,"my twitter review the love story of hello, love, goodbye 2019 couldnt be more formulaic, although i wont dismiss its sad factor, but i really couldnt care less for it after the movie ended what the movie successfully conveys is the sacrifices people make to have a better life, to make ends meet, even if it means being away from the people you love the family aspect of the movie really got me, its the subplot that actually made me cry the plight of ofws in this film was executed very wellsensitively, with a lot of heart it made a good depiction of how families want to be together but cant, the pain and consequences of being away from them, dreams that have to be put on hold and the resilience of ofws i loved the movie because of that aspect my facebook review i have to admit that the love story of hello, love, goodbye 2019 didnt charm my socks off please dont attack me what i loved about it though, and where the film actually succeeds, is its depiction of the life of overseas filipino workers ofw it was executed very wellgrounded, sensitive, full of heart it showed how resilient filipinos are and how we find humor in everything that in any way that we can, we always find create families when were away from our own the film conveys how sacrifice can be selfless and also selfish selfless in the aspect of going away from your loved ones and braving a new world alone to make ends meet and eventually have a better quality of life also, that sacrifice can also be selfish, but not the bad kind i hope you get it , when it comes to choosing yourself, choosing your dreams instead of always trying to make the people around you happy the values of this film resonates, especially in every ofw family, how families always try their best to be together albeit it might not actually happen or whenever it does, its going to be a long, long time that in the end, and this might sound corny, love transcends loneliness, fear or hardship my favorite scene would be when kathryn, kakay and their other friend were watching vilma santos iconic speech in anak and kakay sobbingly asks, ang pagmamahal ba sa sakripisyo lang naipapakita sacrifices are not requirements in love we dont have to sacrifice anything just to show someone we love them but we do it because thats how we try to make it work with someone we love and its necessary",7

1764,"for the first time i watched a kathryn bernardo movie in the cinema, since i'm not a fan, and i must say it did not disappoint me the movie is a great depiction of the ofws in hong kong, particularly the domestic helpers, through a romance film bernardo did great in this movie playing a domestic helper named joy her character was well developed and mature and bernardo was able to fully portray it with finesse as you watch the movie and joy's development you'd feel like you're watching the true pains and hardship that our fellow domestic helpers go through with their work and life in hong kong which i think is when the movie is at it's best as for the romance part of the movie i did enjoy the on screen chemistry of the two leads and how they went through although their story is not as strong as joy's personal story alone richards is fine as the opposite of bernardo although i do cringe whenever he needs to deliver the cheesy taglish lines which i really don't like in most cathy garcia molina movies especially that the way those lines was written in the script, it's just that it did not matched with richard's character ethan overall i did really enjoy this movie from start until the end even though there were some low parts of the movie you can overlook those and find the movie enjoyable and will be happy to recommend it to anyone to see",-1

1766,"there is so much potential left untouched, the script could be too cheesy and loaded with too much dialogue at times but the two leads made it bearable kathryn is immaculate when she is alone and devastated while alden managed to stretch a very thin character handed to him a decent watch i must say",3

1781,"hello, love, goodbye is another landmark on cathy garcia molina's illustrious filmography while it may not be her best movie, she sprays her piece with hints of realism, grit and realities on the backdrop of being a overseas worker all the while, she brought it with some weight and optimism that makes it stand out from her recent movies, even though the tone seems derivative from them it all works because of the performances of kathryn bernardo and alden richards, who are able to carry the levity of their down to earth characters and their chemistry is surprisingly exquisite and wonderfully executed that their solution pays it off the rest of the movie is filled with neat cinematography, a good pace and a cinematic feeling and even if the rest of the cast fall on the usual entrapped cliches, it is bernardo and richards' rapport that makes hello, love, goodbye transcend to its audience it is one of those filipino romance movies where i do not hear an over the top shouting match that is at least an achievement",7
1782,usual overseas filipino story with romance thrown in to attract audiences kathryn bernardo did great in the acting department,2
1783,"finally a film where one doesnt have to romanticize love over career ang daming pwedeng pag usapan sa mga choices ni ethan at joy on a socio economic spectrum pero sa ngayon, emphasize ko muna na sobrang gwapo lang ni alden sa movie na to hnnghhh",0
1784,"the most tender moments in the film happen when it offers a contrast between joy, a dreamer who wants something more out of life, and ethan, a realist who's seen enough of the world to doubt that there could be anything more than just heartbreaks although the chemistry was lacking for me, they both managed to portray two realistic characters, especially kathryn bernardo my god, she managed to give her character layers",9
1785,"but alden richards, tho",0
1786,"sabi nga ni oscar wilde romance is the privilege of the rich, not the profession of the unemployed char",0
1787,"i prefer if the plot was only focused only on joy minus the love story, oh well it cant be helped i like the new pair but i disliked ethans character i have no idea how he found her, without context he seems like this creepy weirdo trying to find some love",9
1789,yman made me watch this over the long weekend because he absolutely loves kathryn bernardo and honestly im giving this 4 stars because i loved seeing his eyes sparkle while he was telling me to focus on specific scenes because bebi look this is one of my favorite scenes p i cried at the end loving is so hard but absolutely worth it if you find the right person,-1
1790,it's nice that it showed the condition of the filipino community in hong kong kathryn was great and gorgeous,2
1791,"the perfect definition of a pinoy movie, warts and all but this is done really well and works on all levels, thanks to kathryn and alden i havent seen any of their movies and they dont even really have great chemistry, but both command the screen been on the fence about cgm because of a second chance but this feels more authentic than that theres a scene of joy in a tram seeing an old classmate that kathryn totally nails quite liked how to it ended too",-1
1793,"i really like alden here though also, maski gwapo sya, i dunno i cant seem to swoon over him again, kathryn is given a character so much bigger than what she can offer or i think, i dunno, her small built, babyface features childlike voice is a disadvantage shes okay in less dramatic scenes though the final crying convo really got to me, esp when ethan rests his head on the wall hayyy, ill take whatever love you can give",3
1794,"watched this with my alvs, he hated the alden kathryn team up at first since he really liked kathniel but it changed after watching the movie lmao samedt tho",3

1796,"giatay extreme no sleep gaming kaayo si joy, siya na lang naghulat sa iyang alarm na mutingog hahaha pagka litsi oybut for real though, this movie made me realize how fucking hard it is to work as a domestic helper in hk i never knew they have those ids that restricts them from working as anything else aside from being a domestic helper",2
1797,"my first philippines commercial film i had no expectation and wow its pretty solid the story is a typical romantic comedy story, but it is fun, sweet, emotional and feels genuine duo bernardo richards have a great chemistry and enjoyable to watch gv paya lebar",2
1799,"oh my gosh sksksks i am totally late to the bandwagon of watching hello, love, goodbye a month later and it's still showing in cinemas and i can definitely see why now the kathryn and alden love team is so fresh and charming it's a love team that's not cringe worthy and it definitely works as cheesy as it may be with their dialogues of love makes me want a love life jk but i like the message of how it's really important to find ourselves first and reach for what makes us happy in our own way because self love is a very important thing that we should all consider it's not bad to care for ourselves first it's not bad to be selfish even just once especially when you always give your all to others that you don't even leave some for yourself joy has been sacrificing so much for her family even having to work abroad as a domestic helper just to help in her family's finances that seeing her finding her happiness, finding her joy and thinking of herself as well is such a great development of character it helps to inspire each and every one of us to chase our dreams and to chase what makes us happy whatever it may be or no matter how dumb it may sound kathryn bernardo singing is a mood need a friend glorietta 4",-1
1800,"great acting but same formula same female main character who's the bread winner of the family same loud and funny sidekicks teasing from the sidekicks but i guess i enjoyed it nothing groundbreaking to deserve to be hyped this much but it was alright the thing i liked about it was how the sad reality of being an ofw was shown and how kathryn bernardo portrayed being one very well it also made me realize the sad reality of filipino children setting aside their own goals to take what should only be their parents' responbilities, because of poverty it's really admireable at the same time you wish it shouldn't have to be that way",-1
1801,"kathryn bernardo was so good here such an oscar worthy performance there are really great heartfelt scenes i actually cried during that lito pimentel and bunso scene just being nitpicky, that brothers bar scene i felt was not necessary typical eskandalo scene on pinoy films good film definitely worth a watch well deserved of all the hype it got",-1
1803,"cathy grace molina is a definite veteran of the filipino romance genre, and with hello, love, goodbye, she might have just crafted her most culturally relevant, self aware, and individually contemplative piece yet at the very least, it is an authentic portrayal of the plight of the ofws but if it werent for the well written, organic romance between the two lead characters, played endearingly well by both alden richards and kathryn bernardo, and with bountiful chemistry to spare, goodbye may have fallen into the territory of cliched conventional filipino love story instead, it is a grounded romance elevated by heart, integrity, and reflection take this from someone who isnt exactly a fan of the sappy filipino romance film",7
1804,"this film was so easy to fall in love with thank you, cathy garcia molina for giving us a specific dh story and helping us understand the struggles of the family's only breadwinner who has to be ironically away from said family thank you for giving us a story of a woman with an incredible arc, full of strength, character, and ambition thank you for giving us joy and ethan who felt like a manic pixie dream boy, but yeah, love ethan 3000",13

1810,"never mind the sloppy hetero romance narrative but the way this film represents filipino domestic workers in hong kong felt so joyous despite labor conditions, alienation, the brutal reality of capitalism that permeates the lives of domestic workers theres a warmth and dignity in how theyre represented the pageant scene is probably my favoritecomedic beauty pageants are such a huge part of filipino culture lmao, and its easily the funniest part of the film sure, the film softens some of the grittier truths about working in the care sector, but theres still enough nuance here it gives well deserved visibility to women ofws in mainstream ph cinema also, the kathryn alden pairing slaps",2
1812,"a good film but overly cliched in parts alden richards some of the dialogue has me wincing and thinking to myself, who talks like this kathryn bernardo is the stand out of the film joy feels like a real person, like someone i might already know i do feel like alden richards was slightly miscast i learned a lot about the ofw experience just by watching the film, and that aspect of the movie seems to be firmly grounded in reality",3

1816,"but this one, the highest grossing philippine film of all time, was the exception i'm really glad that i have finally seen this it was truly heartfelt and emotional well, i guess for me 'cause when you grew up with overseas working parents and became the guardian of your 4 younger siblings at the age of 14, and now that you're an ofw yourself, you just know you get to empathize with the plight of the ofws, and as you get fully immersed with joy's character, you can no longer stop crying i so love kathryn bernardo, so yes i actually plan to study for a master's degree soon, so i'm starting to write a concept paper regarding the situations of the ofws here exploring their social conditions, and the stigmas and prejudices they are being confronted but if things won't turn out the way i want it to be, at least i get to do something really fulfilling on my part pano naman ako i love you all but, what about me you can call me ambitious, but i have dreams bigger than this",2
1817,"a perfect example of a movie created with the most generic formula in philippine romance cinema, but actually works for me, the story works because it leaned in the struggles of reality rather than the idealistic world of most of star cinema movies kathryn bernardo carries this movie on her shoulders with a very authentic performance her best scene is in the train where, after seeing her insensitive mom and a depressing conversation with her dad, she sees her...",2

1822,i cried a lot loved it all,-1
1823,"at first i thought it was just because i wasn't used to kathryn not having daniel as her partner in a film, but later on i realized that it was because i hated how half of the dialogue was overly cliche especially alden's parts in a way it felt like i was reading one of those funny crush memes on fb lol what really carried this for me were the very realistic scenes showing what ofws really go through, including the family struggles also props to the main protagonists' friends for the comedic reliefs 5 in my rating was for a cinematography",3

1860,"however, what made this different is how the story revolves around on dreams and choosing to grow together even when apart from each other at first, i found the alden and kathryn team up quite odd and don't fit well but as the film progress, their chemistry blossoms and the dialogues between grow on you kathryn definitely carried the film and it felt as if alden is the support that completes the film with her the overall heart of the film is pretty much there and makes this stand out from the rest of the star cinema rom coms in the 2010s",3

1862,"hello, love, goodbyegarcia molina's latestis overstuffed, overscored, and relies too much on unrealistic dialogue to bring its story to life yet i was so smitten by it, like my heart is going to burst at any moment",7
1863,it's so refreshing to see kat with someone other than daniel alden in this movie is a revelation the chemistry of the leads is impeccable i was bawling,3
1864,"best part of the film was the cinematography and how it actually uses hong kong and its streets, buildings etc as a storytelling element and not just promo for the film solid shots and color grading the plot was refreshing considering the generic romcom pinoy film the writing was good but it wouldve been better with less of the cheesy or fanservice type stuff solid acting and interesting and entertaining characters reminded me of kita kita but 10x better",2
1865,"the acting was chefs kiss the score was perfect the screenplay slightly corny but on god would make you tear up i could relate to joy i would, in a heartbeat, choose my dreams for once over a guy who planned it all out for supposedly the both of us",1
1866,"hello, love, goodbye catapulted itself as not only the highest grossing filipino film of 2019, but also of all time unlike previous title holders, this acclaim is well deserved because the film is actually good two overseas filipino workers ofw , joy and ethan, meet in hong kong and fall in love however, joy is planning to leave the city soon to pursue her dreams elsewhere meanwhile, ethan is about to become a permanent resident and is at the cusp of building a long term life there whats most notable about hello, love, goodbye is how it immerses us into the ofw experience the daily hustle, the homesickness, and the impermanence of it all not that the story is any different from anak or sunday beauty queen, but the film managed to go deep into the lives of domestic helpers and hong kong residents with so much authenticity and breadth and then theres the pairing of kathryn bernardo and alden richards, which propels the films dramatic stakes to even greater heights both are completely believable not only as lovers, but also as people trying to make their families proud the films overarching theme of chasing after your own ambition will surely resonate with everyone that being in a relationship doesnt mean that you have the same goals in life and that ambition is a personal thing every once in a while, we get a star cinema film that breaks out of the rom com mold and superficial happy endings i am absolutely floored with how the film ended even more so that they didnt attempt to reverse the goodbye with an after 10 years epilogue",7
1867,"being a filipino working overseas feels suffocating, which this film manages to execute that feeling perfectly thanks to the performances of kathryn bernando and alden richards the reason why people love this film wasn't because of the romantic moments between bernando and richards, but because of how the film depicted the unglamorous life of an ofw",2
1868,"after bringing more misses than hits, it's safe to say that hello, love, goodbye is the film that finally gets cathy garcia molina back on her feet to once again captivate the pinoy cinephile's attention thoroughly as a celebrated contributor to modern philippine cinema with her iconic star cinema features from previous years, she seems to have lost her touch with her being inclined on quantity over quality style of releasing films molina must've listened to the critics because her 2019 offering is quite special for a lot of things all of which make it a solid venture into new horizons for the filmmaker that hopefully, she'll continue to explore to continue an exciting streak of films potentially started by this one if one were to take it a step further, it's also a bold film, really for what it shows and tells to the audience as a mainstream release that makes it slightly unconventional and powerful what makes it so is the strength of the discourse that astonishingly, marvelously overpowers that of the star cinema rom drama formula that molina has always gripped onto it seems to have came at an opportune time, too, considering the state of hong kong during the time of its release which makes it a film of considerable significance that brings enlightenment to a wide audience about the ofw experience overseas the film can work and be enjoyed both ways, and that's really where the magic can be found, tasted, and adored as a social commentary piece about the lives of ofws in hong kong, it's fascinating and moving specially because of how the characters of joy and ethan are written with specificity where the drama is stressed and is made impactful and so, that brings us to the other side of the film that makes the romance that they try to invigorate worth buying into knowing their stories that can pretty much be anyone's looking deeper into those two facets of the film, it seems like everything here works fine and well, and indeed it does that it feels like a charm so unbelievable in how it is conceived though the film may still fall under the trappings of cathy garcia molina's films, such as the sappiness of the romance or the movie like dialogue that takes away an amount of authenticity, they aren't huge hindrances to the film being well formed molina doesn't merely make it all feel like a star vehicle for kathryn bernardo and alden richards after all since there's meat given to the characters they play courtesy of co writers, carmi raymundo and rona co it may be unexpected, but believe it or not, the screenplay of the film is astonishingly rich even if the direction isn't as masterful as one would like it to be the actors really work from that, bringing great stuff for us to commend, absorb, and feel almost even with the flaws resting in it, there's no way for one to not be won over by what this film packs a love letter to ofws not only in hong kong, but all over the world who sacrifice themselves for love in different ways, it rightfully deserves to be seen and embraced as a new classic for the memorability of how it converses, which shows its profound dedication and respect to those it represent onscreen with immense accuracy it's honestly the kind of star cinema film that you'd hope to be made more often tempered, substantial, and resonant a film that knows how to reach its audience in ways that don't feel too compromised and feeble in their attempts",7
1869,sobrang buong buo ung character ni joy at natuwa ako na nabigyan ng highlight din ang struggle ng atin mga kababayan na nagpapakahirap sa ibang bansa sana di lang napwersa yung half baked love story at feeling ko hindi pa din earned ni ethan yung growth na nakuha niya sa huling part ng pelikula,0
1870,"basically, konflik dilema kayak gini udah familiar sejak nonton series on the wings of love dari filipina juga , tema besarnya hampir sama, jadi gak terasa spesial lagi hanya saja, di sini kathryn bernardo unggul dari segala aspek, sedangkan lawan mainnya terasa sulit untuk keep up",2

1872,"this isnt a groundbreaking ofw film, but it is a very specific one, and its truly the details that make it potent along with whats perhaps one of the most fully realised female characters in recent philippine cinema, brought to life by an impressive kathryn bernardo",-1

1874,"ang choice para lang sa may pera choice is only for those who have money it makes me so happy this rom com is the highest grossing filipino film of all time cathy garcia molina obviously knows how to make a rom com filled with the genre's tropes make it sing turning it into a love story between two intergenerational overseas filipino workers in hong kong who are bound by the struggle to survive under late capitalism the sacrifice they made to leave their families for another country to give them better life gives ethan joy's love story more weight poignancy the fact that it mostly shows the usual places filipino domestic workers would go to in hong kong, trying to cram as much details stories about the ofw experience in without torpedoing the plot, holding off on the country's tourist spots until it mattered speaks to its priorities and goddamn this might be alden richard's finest performance yet kathryn bernardo is fucking fantastic someone in the third world cinema club podcast mentioned that it's fascinating to watch this now, since it was shot before the ongoing protests in hong kong it's like a time capsule from the point of view of filipinos with the typical star cinema sheen",2
1875,"typical love story cinema's in philippines are intoxicated with fresh in the sense that kathryn bernardo gets a new screen partner to play with in alden richards and that works out almost for the better, as her and daniel padilla are almost a tired married couple after teaming for so long the story focuses on ofw, filipinos working abroad, here hong kong, and the tough situation they face a they try and build a better life for themselves and their families, and how romance help ease the desperate situation still a pleasant watch",2
1876,'i'm sorry i made you feel you had to apologise just because you have dreams''i will work hard to deserve to be in your future',4
1877,"the right amount of kilig and drama can separate a romantic movie from the rest hello, love, goodbye is a romantic drama that surprisingly doesn't fall prey to the mainstream formulaic love stories we've seen in the past it's not peppered with cliches it's relatable without it trying too hard this love story of ethan and joy is a non toxic relationship that's easy to get behind the hong kong backdrop and the chemistry between the leads made this movie all the better for moviegoers like me who's long given up in the mainstream romance movies the industry has to offer, this is certainly a refreshing treat",7
1878,"i love how the movie give more empowerment for the woman the struggle, the trust, their stress management even the story of her parents journey of her life how she make her own plan for the future how making a choice for ourselves can be a big dream but it is more than that",-1

1883,amc a lista filipino movie where two filipinos living in hong kong meet and fall in love this was more than a typical rom com with alot of the film dealing with how hard it is to be living and working so far from home and family the two leads had great chrmistry very enjoyable,2
1884,i wonder if kathryn bernardo's back hurt from how much she carried this entire film,12
1886,"maganda ang dialogue except dun sa mga english lines sa huling part na medyo parang pilit naniniwala akong kaya namang i twist ang pinoy romcoms natin para magkaroon ng mas malalim na mensahe, and this is proof of that also, ang galing, galing, galing ni kathryn bernardo pero wala pa talagang kaya pumantay sa kanya as a leading man",0
1887,i think it was pretty overhyped but it was a good watch the movie somewhat reminded me of sunday beauty queen because it showed the lives of ofws in hong kong the main character of joy is pretty relatable especially to young people in their 20s who don't really have time for themselves anymore due to their responsibilities and i think this is where the appeal of the film came from i didn't read in to it too much mostly because i think it was pretty straightforward and i really wanted to find out where the appeal came from,-1

1891,i cant be your future but i can be your now,4
1892,"i was actually surprised that their tandem worked i was worried at first cause i thought alden was going to be vastly compared to daniel padilla but he really did a great job portraying ethan he surpassed all my expectations he did really well as for kathryn, of course, who wouldn't love kath pretty face and her acting skills was beyond amazing she can make you feel all the emotions she's giving as if you were there with her storywise, i loved the conflicting question whether you will choose commitment and be with someone you truly love or choose to follow your dreams and for once in your life, pick yourself over others it's something that the viewers can relate to dunno what's wrong with me lol i can say that this film is something different compared to other pinoy romantic dramas it was also good that this film informed its viewers about the hardships and struggles every ofw experience just to give back to their loved ones back home",3

1911,"the film is more of joy's story than it is joy and ethan's it presents the overseas workers' plight realistically and acknowledges the differences the romance is only secondary to the main plot, which is joy self actualizing her wants and giving herself a better option in life this film is also kathryn bernardo's strongest performance so far",-1
1912,"i honestly don't miss a kathniel movie whenever it's shown in the cinemas ,, as cliche as it seems, they really act good and it hits that filipino romcom culture that we all grew to love",2

1925,was disappointed that it was not the kathniel love team we know but alden and kathryns chemistry was good,3
1926,"is it wrong if this movies spotlight on hong kong makes me romanticise hong kong more from the view of a foreigner the movie poster caught me but the synopsis made me watch it as i am interested in discovering more narratives of domestic helpers as an indonesian, i learned a lot more of filipino words which are surprisingly similar to my language, such as bangon and utang, so that was interesting and made me curious to learn the language as a nobody who is not qualified to give any critics on film but will do it anyway, i would say that this movie centres around the life of one domestic helper which is pretty illustrative but not of the domestic work itself it disentangles a bunch of issues which may probably be central to some women foreign domestic helpers if there is anything that i would like to underline is that joy helps ethan and not the other way round if you cannot see something as simple as that then i do not know what else to say except to recommend you watch the movie again this kind of movies that reinforces the idea that men are allowed to force the love out of a responsible, ambitious, and bright young lady just because that lady is too arrogant to love is just",-1

1934,"this is a story that hits close to home because of my mom i dont know the details of what my mom went through working also as a domestic helper in hong kong what i do remember though is something she said in passing that she would cry every night because she was away from me i never thought of my mom leaving me in the philippines when i was younger as something easy i knew it was hard, i just didnt know how hard i respect and love my mom so much and knew she did a lot for me but this film made me see things differently that respect and love blinded me, it never crossed my mind to really think about what she went through and now to think that she did all of that for me fills me with emotions i cant even begin to explain im so thankful but also so sorry i just hope im able to repay even just half of what she has given me and she has and continues to give me everything",2
1935,"i read somewhere once that flying makes you more prone to crying but i think that even at ground level, this movie would have made me cry on the surface, it looks like your typical filipino romcom guy meets girl, one of them dislikes the other initially, the other person is interested and tries to win their affection by being both pabebe yet persistent, a montage ensues, and as much as one party tries to fight it, they eventually fall in love char i remember seeing the trailer for this sometime last year and wanting to watch it because it looked promising while the movie does fall trap to some of the cheesiness and tropes read ethan's backstory that make the aforementioned typical local romcom weak, it manages to bring a depth to its characters, including l hong kong itself, that usually escapes mainstream blockbusters this is exemplified in joy's character i've been a kathryn bernardo fan since grade school hello mara clara but this is probably her best performance to date we are thrown headfirst into the demands of joy's life and her routine, the pacing of which i really enjoyed duty to family, the dichotomy between practicality and passion, and the price of following your dreams take on a new meaning in her situation you can't help but root for her and if you're like me want to throw a shoe at ethan it leaves the viewer instead to decide how they feel about not just the characters' situations, but also the very systems that birth and perpetuate them glad i was finally able to catch it i didn't manage to finish the whole thing but am hoping to during quarantine",-1
1936,"after seeing kathryn bernardo and alden richards with other screen partners for so long, who would have thought that they too could ooze out an undeniable chemistry i admire both of their performance in this film and i really hope they'll have more projects in the future",3
1937,"hmm, sounds like three words from forever straightforward as this title is, whatever the complications and heartbreak in cathy garcia molina's latest romantic tragedy, they can't be any heavier than the story that has to be behind kathryn bernardo not playing opposite daniel padilla no, i'm sure their marriage is as annoyingly adorable as ever, especially since this film doesn't set a good tone for them seeing other people, onscreen alone bernardo plays a free spirited domestic worker in hong kong, with a diverse network of friends that don't worry, filipino conservatives upset about an onscreen couple not being married offscreen isn't too diverse she naturally hits it off with a handsome fellow philippines expat, an ambitious bartender looking to lay some roots down in the city our woman can't wait to get the heck out of as the two begin to look to their seemingly temporary friendship to help them weather the hong kong hustle, it becomes clearer that they have ideas to spend their lives together, and extremely different ideas about how to as the title plainly tells you, this story won't work out, but it is charming, way to a fault this doesn't want to be just another , as it lives up to its title by methodically examining the process of a potentially doomed romance with the intimacy and draw of a prestige love story there's more potential on paper than you'd think, but of course it's all hijacked by overwrought rom com sensibilities, especially with bouncy pacing and gratingly corny, relentless music jessie q the average rom com viewer may also get bored with the runtime, so of course i find more compelling than the average rom com there's certainly a unique enough romance in the gorgeous, ever bustling backdrop of hong kong explored extensively as its own character this scope is more than enough to liven up this intimate love story there's nothing refreshing or challenging about this shameless fluff piece, but its themes are a little more grown up than usual, more frank about the chore of reconciling romantic interests with personal ones histories of failures and potentials for success are heavily debated and approached in this two hour dual character study, at a methodical clip that may bore certain viewers without the fallback of zanily colorful supporting characters they bring some laughs, and texture the personalities of lead characters who are spoiled by their own, more mundane humor and quite a few humiliatingly cheesy bearings of soul besides that, their motivations and relationship turns are thoroughly, even complexly drawn, and tightened under the solid chops and crisp chemistry of the beautiful kathryn bernardo and the handsome alden richards between the ready made claptrap and the meanderingly thoughtful romantic dual character study, the former pretty much prevails on grating music, style, comedy and melodrama, with enough entertaining sprawl in the lavish hong kong setting, more colorful characters and endearing flair, and enough real nuance in the characters, their relationship and the performances, to make cathy garcia molina's hello, love, goodbye a touchingly heartfelt, just as abrasively disingenuous romantic melodramedy 75 5 fair",7

1961,"the only thing new about this star cinema romance is the ending it opens the story up to a sequel movies of this kind from the movie giant would always end with a definite closure perhaps theyre looking forward to another partnership with the actor who was loaned from another network for this movie the movie was mostly noisy they all follow the typical formula of sidekick friends telling the main protagonists what and how to feel the accent was obviously put on as some form of comedic relief alden richards its my first time watching him in a full length anything anyway, ive been trying to figure out whats different about his face hes handsome, for sure but i just couldnt put a finger on that one thing thats different until i saw him in this movie maybe from the years of wearing braces, his upper lip flattened out anyway, kathryn was good almost made me cry again in one scene but then alden spoke, so there dont get me wrong i dont hate the boy i was just really so intent in observing him in his every scene, trying to figure out his face situation what i would change about this movie get rid of all those annoying sidekicks",-1

1963,"this film was recommended to me by several people and so ive decided to find a perfect time to watch it without distractions i wish i did not joy was such a strong character which bernardo was just enough to portray i could imagine other actresses who would be able to give justice to the same role i was not surprised at how bernardo was able to incredibly pull off that what if i choose not to stay she does those kinds of scenes really well in any film maganda na sana i thought for a moment that it was a good take on the lives of dh overall, i wish i just watched it the first time i thought of doing so",13

1982,"with unrelenting chemistry and superb acting from its two leads, hello, love, goodbye turns out to be an outstanding romance drama film experience against the backdrop and introspective of our country's modern day heroes, the ofws overseas filipino workers specifically domestic helpers in hong kong, the film was able to bank on even more emotions than expected one of these domestic helpers is joy kathryn bernardo who has wants to leave hong kong and find a better life in canada as a nurse but unfortunate circumstances have prevented her from attaining this life long dream ethan alden richards is a bartender and has a few years left before he can be a permanent resident in hong kong both meet one fateful night and while they do not fall instantly in love, ethan's persistence eventually wins joy's heart but their polar opposite circumstances and dreams will make the decision to continue with their relationship a difficult one to make hello, love, goodbye does enough to make it one of the better romance drama films we have seen how it accomplishes this is by pretty much making outstanding work on the basics first and foremost, the central characters of ethan and joy were well written and well scripted both characters had deep seeded personal issues that were not only central to the film's main conflict but grounded and believable the script was mostly great having its fair share of emotional one liners and witty banters but we have to admit, it went a little too cheesy in some scenes beyond that, both characters had great actors and performances behind them that gave these characters much life and much justice additionally, the main narrative was well written it felt fresh and had a lot of unexpected twists, turns, and surprises along the way the ending was satisfying without spoiling much it also presented a basic look into the stark reality of the ofw domestic helpers in hong kong while it had some unnerving revelations about the domestic helper life, most of these have been tackled better in other films previously what surprised us most though if the film's cinematography it's a given that hong kong is a beautiful city to begin with but the camera work here impressed us overall, hello, love, goodbye is a great romance drama film worth your time and one heck of a dramatic film at its core source www",7
1983,"but one day, in the middle of all the noise and chaos in a place where no one stays still,you will meet someone and for a while, time just stops is love only expressed through sacrifice just loved ethan and joy",5
1984,"if there's one thing i love about some good filipino mainstream cinema, it would be the fact that it knows how to invoke emotions this is actually one of the good mainstream filipino films out there this also has to be one of cathy garcia molina's bests at that",2

1986,"if the person im dating for a few weeks planned my entire future without consulting me, i too wouldve run as fast as humanly possible run joy, takbo",4
1987,inter network pairings always works for me,-1
1988,"really cathy it would have worked better if it hadn't been for the half baked arguably unnecessary romance plot but who are we kidding this is star cinema however, very un star cinema esque is its approach to the struggle of our ofws and i respect it for that joy's character is solid and human, the driving force of the film despite the cringey corniness of her romance kathryn deserves all the praise and her chemistry with alden was surprising, especially in the early days of their love story overall, i loved joy's story it separates itself from the usual martyrdom leading ladies in romantic films usually take on",-1
1989,"strong opening scene i liked the camerawork and how it captured the repetitive and lonely life of someone named joy from then on, hlg is mostly formulaic kathryn bernardo shines but some of her lines sounded too melodramatic i think alden richards character was underdeveloped and while this has made me expect less of him, his ethan leaves a lot to be desired",3
1990,"it's the bothering solitude of my christmas eve evening that led me to watch this kathryn surely deserved that acting award for this film because she single handedly carried it also the script, god, the script scoring bothered me too because i like the silence of films especially kapag mabigat na yung batuhan in summary, i give licenses to kathryn alden's fans by presenting this film as proof for their acting calibre then i will snatch it back once they start speaking how good it was",3
1991,"carmi raymundo's best, i think",2
1992,i couldn't care less about ethan and joy's love story i wish this movie was more about joy because it shines when it's about her struggles in hongkong and her trying her utmost best to be more and have more in life because i love ambitious women like that,-1
1993,other thoughts 1 so i just watched a pretty good movie before this fan girl by jadaone so ramdam ko yung contrast ng good vs not so good film parang sa teleserye lang i'm hoping na magkaron ulit ng project etong dalawang 'to with a better script and director ang corny talaga sponsored by frontrow props to joy for knowing what she wants and fighting for it love isn't always the answer,0
1994,"put off watching this until, well, today it badly reminded me of la la land, but with more filipino culture the ending was bittersweet, but it is the reality for many filipinos",2

1996,"rewatched as it came out on netflix i remember liking it before, and i think i still like it now the best scene for me though was neither with alden nor kath, but with joy's mom talking about what happened with her and joy's dad",1
1998,"for a star cinema fare, the best thing this film does is to finally not force a happy ending to please its target audience however, this film is effective as a drama that talks about filipino diaspora it even takes away the usually bright gloss aesthetic of a star cinema film which i loved theres a sense of realism at play it shines at moments when it doesnt delve on the romance, but on the struggles faced by filipinos working abroad when we are shown how these filipinos find ways to cope up and form a stronger bond as a community of overseas workers the film is at its most human past its flaws, the film is something i appreciated its a semi fresh take that is just a bit uneven",2
1999,i will spend the rest of my 2020 reflecting about my decisions and crying about it,6
2001,"it is refreshing to see kathryn bernardo paired up with a different partner no doubt that her acting skills, as well as aldens, are very raw and vulnerable and believable however, this is too dramatic for me, i mean, i have seen rom coms with the same point that is to put ones self and pursue a career and turn down a man who would be willing to do literally anything just to be with you that arent very heavy to the heart",-1
2002,"just like goto, this movie is the familiar modern filipino romance movie it's a good movie to watch to uplift your mood kathden is a couple i really, really like kathryn is a good actor and actually looks like a filipina at least compared to others alden is charming and can deliver the cheesy lines well of course, it has the wacky friends of the protagonists, the ill parent, the dysfunctional family, the bad boy being reformed by the girl, etc",-1

2025,i like how this film showed the reality of our ofw joy is a loveable character and kathryn did a very good job portraying her tbh im not a huge fan of her acting but i think this is kath's best film,3
2026,"may mga issue ako sa screenplay at sa scoring hahaha sana nag karaoke na lang ako amp lahat naman tayo agree na this is kathryn bernardo in her best form she carried the role so well and alden, he is okay but with kathryn she eats him up like a dumpling gurl binuhat to ni kathryn at ng trio niya ischrue ischrue several issues were presented all throughout the film issues that are particularly relevant to the migrant workers of the philippine society we rely heavily on private companies so nationalized industries are not present same with other professions sa pilipinas dapat mabago natin to, para wala nang joy na kailangang timbangin palagi ang sarili at ethan na nakaka cringe charot",13

2036,"10 years from now, star cinema will release a romantic comedy called cameroon in which two depressed ofws reconcile with 20 minutes left in the film and we're treated to a montage of them hanging out on picturesque sights just so they could recoup some of the budget from the host country while also garnering praise for the wonderful cinematography which effectively translates to drone shots of the sky line",-1
2037,first watched this as i was studying away from home,1
2039,not sure how its the top film of filipino time,2
2040,"the details are incredibly well integrated in the context of, well, one more chance with a different setting but the reductive comparison doesnt diminish how well the details are colored even the nuances of the script are actually nice, though i could use a better delivery mechanism than the full english back and forth that has become a staple of many contemporary productions theres a lot to chew on here especially given the large population of filipino families that are in this boat",2
2041,gusto ko na ulit ng jowa pls,0
2042,"really good and so meaningful i loved how the plot was so well designed and concise not only focusing on the romance elements but also struggles of being an overseas worker, sacrifice and self love it really does highlights the nature of impermanence and show a realistic nature love and not some glossed version of it it showed then ending of it and i loved how the story ended with the main girls new beginning of moving countries",-1
2043,"watched this for class, and we talked about the rift between mainstream and independent cinema in the philippines the opening sequence of hello, love, goodbye 2019 is almost exactly the same as the first few minutes of sid aya not a love story 2018 , as it makes use of a montage of the scenes to come, all while joy kathryn bernardo describes hong kong, and her life, and how she perceives love again, similarly with sid aya, the first part only follows joy as she lives her life as a domestic helper, then it pulls the then it all changed cliche when ethan alden richards comes in and pulls out some weird and cringe y pick up lines to woo her and funny enough, just like sid aya, the woman has little to no interest in the man this film almost masquerades as the usual mainstream filipino romance, with its structure and overall production it has invisible editing, clear visuals, and an upfront and chronological structure with exception to the first flash forward montage and a few flashbacks but where hello, love, goodbye diverts from the usual is in the complexity of its characters' struggles as its plot progresses she is almost drowning in responsibilities as a domestic helper, but continues to hustle harder and harder to provide for her family, and to keep her fading dreams alive ethan is a hotshot bartender who is secretly full of regret, as he previously left his whole life behind just to chase a girl he desperately loved joy and ethan's dynamic starts out weird, but their love reluctantly grows as joy comes closer to her dreams and as ethan slowly comes to terms with his past towards the end, as joy and ethan are arguing about their future, and what love means to them alden richards and kathryn bernardo's performances are strong and passionate in the later acts despite some very mushy lines here and there , and perhaps this is where the artistry of the independent film lies their performances and their lines are the things i pondered about long after the credits rolled this film definitely leans more towards the mainstream cinema the mainstream elements significantly outweigh its indie elements but, it has a certain depth and profoundness in the messages it delivers to its audience thanks to its good writing and performances it's far from a perfect film, or a film that i would consider a modern classic, but i can definitely see this being enjoyed by a lot of different filmgoers with different tastes, as it does have a little something for everyone and because of all these, it's clear to see why this is currently the highest grossing film produced in the philippines",7
2044,this movie will always make me tear up i guess,1
2045,i watched this again with friends at around 3am and while they were crying i was just,-1
2047,"a much more subdued garcia molina, and it works wonders for it did not expect this movie to hit as hard as it does, what it lacks in some finer aspects repetitive music, slightly off humor though it hits way more than say, fsaw , the sorta questionable start of the romance , it more than makes up for it with authenticity, emotional astuteness and complexity, and kathryn and alden's great chemistry and performances especially kathryn's, whose pain and joy pun intended are both palpable through her delivery and face more of this from mainstream romance, please",13
2048,ganda mo kathryn,-1
2052,"there's a single aspect in hello, love, goodbye that makes it truly worth watchingits fairly authentic portrayal of the collective plights of overseas filipino workers ofw as a former ofw's kid, this one definitely hits home, and it's pretty much the same feeling i had when i watched sunday beauty queen i have heard a lot of stories about their struggles abroad including from my mom and dad the moment joy kathryn bernardo shouted i love you all pero 'tangina, pa'no naman ako was pretty reminiscent to that of my mom's sentiments about her experience when she was feeling down while at work it's really sad, and this one spoke so much to me and so, i'm gonna give this film a point for that however, other than the things mentioned earlier, everything ranges from being dull to borderline decent i have to commend bernardo's very emotional portrayal of a very emotional character she eventually ended up carrying the entire film, while alden richards, despite being constantly labeled among fans and critics for slightly stepping up his game, seemed a little stale see it for yourself then it's nothing new, so i had to endure it hello, love, goodbye would have been a huge knockout had it been focusing on joy's story arc it's the only thing in the film that i was fully invested in",7
2053,kathryn bernardo does not disappoint direk cathy is always on point,8
2054,"wow, didn't expect to like this movie so much very millenial din 'tong movie the characters choose themselves without completely leaving the person they love",1
2055,"but yeah i guess for a big budget romcom it's fresh got really enjoyable in the parts where it wasn't trying so hard to seem smarter than it is, and the romance at its peak was believable id give it that at least",-1
2056,"maganda, maganda naman karewatch rewatch naman after some other time gusto ko yung ibang points dito ni joy na kailangan niya abutin yung pangarap niya kasi ayaw niya dumating sa point na magsisisihan silang dalawa kasi pinili nila ang isa't isa instead of themselvesmaganda yung representatyon ng mga ofw, realistic, maganda chemistry ng dalawang bida, magagaling ang nakuhang mga aktres,",0

2059,"watched this only bc i miss hkg, but i was actually left pleasantly surprised felt a bit like a filipino la la land, but it was executed well naman i like where mainstream ph cinema is going tbh stories and style still arent that differentiated from hollywood but we really are getting somewhere alden and kathryn had good chemistry and that was one of my fave parts of the film kathryns acting skills were rly brought out here bc we finally saw her with someone else other than daniel lol the audience gets to know that the actor is not merely comfortable with another actor shes actually rly good at her craft this is way better than most films out there ending also gave a good message and i love that",3

2067,"its mainstream rom com sensibilities take away from its surprisingly not too melodramatic reality , but the film is still really good bernardo is very impressive, and richards is, too glad that the film did the effort of making joy's mom's dilemma clearer i just thought that the surprise kiss during their meet cute is one of the most groanworthy scenes i have ever seen",-1
2068,ang choice para lang sa mayamankathryn bernado's acting was just chef's kiss,-1
2069,"honestly i'm lowkey scared of this since my parents worked so hard only for me to end up not achieving my dream anyway, the characters are well written makita mo yung flaws nila and all which is realistic in a way you can associate them with other people you know then yung growth nila together aaaa i mean of course, it does not happen overnight since it's progress, and they still need a lot of growing up to do, so the fact they left it at an open ending is better enough",2
2070,"this is the highest grossing filipino film ever made, and i literally can't believe it itd be like if terms of endearment were america's like on one level it makes some sense its about two attractive young people who meet and fall in love in an exotic locale, and theyre played by two huge movie stars pretty easy to see how that gets butts in the seat and this is a college educated worker with dreams of being a nurse our heroines mother gets beaten by her foreign husband whom she despises, but has to stay with him for another few months to become a resident and then the rest of her family who were left behind in the philippines can join her its a necessary and timely topic, and its handled with great care, but highest grossing film ever ahead of the avengers",2

2072,"cathy garcia molina said joy chose to pursue her career because her love life can wait,,,,,",4

2075,really not bad for my first ever pinoy film experience it's actually quite a good and very enjoyable one which is honestly quite a rare sight for romantic drama released in the recent years i like both performances of the charming leads the beautiful and talented kathryn bernardo definitely going to check of her films in the future and her co star whom i forgot his name though i must admit there are times where i was bothered by...,-1

2107,will people love this film as much if someone else played the role of joy,1
2108,"a surprisingly affecting romantic drama about the large community of filipino domestic workers in hong kong this is something that has been recently explored as a more heart warming drama with oliver siu kuen chan and anthony wong's excellent still human, however here we have a similar situation but shown almost entirely from the filipino workers perspective and with a significant romantic plot through central character joy, who wants to be a nurse, but is forced into the domestic helper lifestyle like her mother, it looks at the difficulties and exploitation inherent in these worker's arrangements paid a pittance, and treated appallingly by their employers and the state, this film examines how they can be trapped into this existence and life, allowing them to send a bit of money home to family in the philippines that they only speak to via video calls, promising a reunion that will never happen there's an excellent movie in here, but the film stumbles significantly when introducing joy's love interest, barman ethan while it may appear like this film is going to be a standard romantic comedy, it's not really, and ethan's initial characterisation is straight out of a lunatic american rom com after being introduced by pretending to be immigration police and arresting joy, he's harassing and calling her constantly, that even within the constraints of a romantic comedy which this isn't it's a shame that the film goes down this initial cliched route, after introducing ethan's character for the next twenty minutes, because at it's core, and once ethan stops behaving like a lunatic, it's a genuinely tender and quite tragic film about a doomed romance, and about how filipino immigrants to hong kong are never made to feel part of society the films portrayal of both ethan's father and joy's parents is well done, and very sympathetic, which makes it more frustrating that they wasted so much time with ethan's initial character, when they could have skipped that and presented him as he appears for the last hour of the film it's filmed on the streets and alleys of hong kong, and all extremely recognisable and vivid, clearly made by someone who understands the areas, full of classic oh yeah, i know where they are moments this is mostly an excellent film, that's dragged down unnecessarily by the initial appearance of ethan made even more frustrating that they roll that characterisation back still, definitely worth my time, and a lot better than i expected but it could have been just that bit better",2

2110,"what made this film better is kathryn bernardo ends up with no one but herself, despite being paired up with a new guy, that is, alden richards i just like how the film is realistic and doesnt rely on generic storylines yung tipong, ang alam mo na lang ay mag migrate sa isang magandang bansa kung saan magagamit mo ng todo yung degree mo para makaahon sa hirap kaya nga sobrang appreciate ko yung pelikula, kasi hindi to dumepende sa poor girl ending up with well off guy formula ng philippine cinema were all toxic in our own ways, after all",13

2121,"first time i watched this film was with ysa at the cinema after that ive seen it countless times back in review days, may it be at home or while im in a grab, i see it everywhere",1
2122,good story and great acting from kathryn good chemistry too also this movie show so much about the life of our ofws in abroad may all people realize that it's not always rainbows and butterflies,-1

2126,"ang choice, para lang sa may pera joythat quote nearly encapsulates the whole movie while watching the movie, seeing joy struggle through her life especially as an ofw made me think about the ofws i personally hold ofws and their experiences close to my heart especially since my dad is an ofw joyp",1

2132,this took me on a rollercoaster of emotions at parts i was happy and giggling and squealing and other parts i was angry and sad and relating too much to the characters but ahh i loved this so so much definitely one of my favorite films of all time now i already know i can watch this movie over and over again and i will never get tired of it,1
2133,"and i will die on this hill this film proves how kathryn bernardo has never needed daniel padilla to be a star kathniel flicks usually bank on chemistry, but this is pure raw talent from kath and alden also i bawled my eyes out idk why those two couldn't just have worked it out",3
2134,"decent movie to watch when youre on a five hour long drive cute and i think some of the acting couldve been better, same goes for cinematography its good entertainment though and i do appreciate the realistic elements in the film",1
2135,"i've seen this 4x now and it still gets me every script, storyline, cinematography, actingeverything was on point definitely one of the best filipino films out there",2
2136,this i think is my most favorite cathy garcia molina flick not her usual glossy meet cute which i like more a bordering arthouse material at last,-1
2137,"what always fascinated me was how this stands as the highest grossing film of all time in the philippines having an ofw centred story would definitely play a huge role in this benchmark, since the ofw struggle is a very real experience among working class filipinos theres a whole history behind ofw films that id love to look into further while im still studying honours so for me, it felt like an interesting exercise in comparing both localised and transcultural portrayals of a country i dont really have a right to comment on the way cathy portrays hong kong people, or whether or not this captures an authentic hong kong experience outside the ofw life, but this is also something id like to scrutinise more closely i think i can get behind why people would see this as above average, and despite it being an average experience for me, i appreciate the film for what it is i would love to write further about the films ofw narrative and transcultural elements, as they are both integral to shaping philippine cinema as a globalised medium ps watching kathryn bernardo sing badly has been the most cathartic thing ive seen all year",2
2138,i once again cried,6
2139,ang corny ni alden dito pinanood ko lang to para kay kathryn,0
2140,rewatched and fuck joys father,1
2141,"this film deserve its title highest grossing filipino film cathy garcia molina always delivers the leads, kathryn bernardo and alden richards did a great job with their characters and i easily emphatized with them i claim this as my current most favorite filipino film",2
2142,"surprised that they had chemistry the plot was alright and the acting was good i just hope we don't romanticize these types of hardships and don't consider the family dynamics in this movie as acceptable and normal plus, alden's character was kind of scary anyway, the characters eventually developed and the movie ended with a resolution still an alright film",3
2143,"cathy garcia molina departs from rom coms in a touching tale of sacrifice and love in a city far from home leave to pursue your dreams, or stay for the love of your life this is the question that hello, love, goodbye asks us this latest offering from cathy garcia molina, best known for her filipino romantic comedies, is set in hong kong molina sheds light on the experiences of filipinos working overseas by following the story of joy and ethan, two overseas filipino workers ofws we see their lives unfold through the eyes of joy, a hardworking domestic helper whos trying to save money to move to canada as a nurse, and ethan, a bartender trying to find his motivation in life hello, love, goodbye stars two of the philippines biggest names from the two of the biggest loveteamskathryn bernardo from kathniel and alden richards from aldub whats also surprising is that bernado and richards are from rival television networks in the philippines, its common for actors to be signed to one network exclusively their performance in hello, love, goodbye proves that once in a while, it doesnt hurt to break out of your loveteam to grow as an artist an empathetic, authentic performancein hello love, goodbye, bernado graduates from her teen roles and blossoms into a dramatic actressa total transformation from her child acting daysin a tour de force performance richards rises to the challenge and exhibits his versatility as an actor, proving why hes one of the countrys matinee idols to get into their roles, bernardo was separated from the cast to better empathize with joys feelings of isolation after just a week of filming in hong kong, she wanted to go back to the philippines richards, on the other hand, lost almost 25 kg to play ethan molina is notorious for her strictness with the artists that she works withbut its paid off as they are all household names, and her films have been blockbuster hits hello, love, goodbyes love story is not new, yet it provides us with a unique perspective of the realities of being an overseas worker the film tears away the layers of the ofw experience with sheer intensity shifting away from showing the employee employer relationship found in other films about ofws, molina brings her focus to the ofws themselves, and their families back home the film strips down the glamor of hong kong, as we follow joy waking up at 5am every day, hustling through the crowded streets of hong kongaway from her family, never catching a dream she sits down on top of cardboard boxes on sundays in central and juggles taking care of her employers daughter and grandmother while selling power banks as a side job which is actually illegal molina blends drama and clarity in portraying these hardships, and most importantly, tells the whys joy, and thousands of other ofws, endure these hardships to provide for their family back homea message that the film strongly reinforces we watch as joys friend reminds her cousin to be smart with her money so she can have enough to send back to the philippines, as the same friend tells her father that shell stay two more years because they need the money making sacrifices is almost always a givena harsh reality if youre an ofw because you have a responsibility to your family back home this responsibility that joy carries is one that resonates with many other ofws but ofws carry out this responsibility at what expense similar to still human, which also featured a filipino domestic helper, joy has a degree in nursing in fact, nursing is a common degree among filipinos with the hope of working overseas for better pay than what they can get back home as it turns out, nursing is actually the dream that joy wants to pursue, and being a domestic helper is just a stepping stone to that goal then ethan comes into the picture while a movie following the plight of domestic helpers and ofws doesnt really need a romance story, the love story still has a purpose ethans character contrasts with joys while joy is hardworking, determined, and knows what she wants in life, ethan is a happy go lucky guy who jumps from one relationship to the next and doesnt know what he wants in life but his characters free wheeling life also echoes joys self questioning of whether choosing ourselves over our family makes us a disappointment, or selfish joy laments the lack of choice she has in life as the familys breadwinner, her family doesnt know what she has to endure on a daily basis a nursing graduate that cleans the toilet and eats leftover foodim more than this job, im more, and i want to be more, joy says surely, this sentiment reflects the many dreams of other overseas filipino workers they have dreams but they also have responsibilities that hold them back joy and ethans romance show the heavy burdens and choices ofws face on a daily basis even something as minor as buying a snack or not is difficult, because every dollar spent is a dollar you could have saved to give back to your family lovea common filipino phrase, libre lang mangarap, tells us its free to dream but joy and ethan realize, as they try to make their love work, that dreams arent free when you make a choice, you give up something joy and ethans mutual romance story mirrors the same sentiments that their individual stories have choices, responsibilities, and dreams perhaps thats the reason why the romance element works against the backdrop of an ofw story in this sense, hello, love, goodbye isnt just a love story, nor is it just an ofw storyits a story about finding yourself, and loving yourself in the process this universal message is something that will strike a chord with audiences hello, love, goodbyes message is simple give yourself the chance to do what you want, get back up from disappointments, be courageous enough to love and choose whether you want to leave or stay the film doesnt portray bernardo and alden as people to pityit portrays them as human beings, with stories and experiences that empower them to ultimately choose how to pave their own way for their futureswith or without each other",7
2145,"i like it less on this watch, but it's still solid kathryn delivers a true elevated performance",3

2180,"mike isn't joy the most sensible, logical, and real filipino movie character ever don't ever apologize for loving yourself go, chase you dreams, sweetheart re watched, just because jackie saw this as well and a review was made",-1
2181,i'll keep saying it wherever i go kathryn bernardo best actress,8
2182,"i found it a bit cluttered and tedious in the first half but it gets better, more focused and complex after the male protagonists family situation is revealed even then, i felt most of the time we were being kept at arms length from the characters close, intimate shots were so rarely used i like its very mature approach to relationships, though, and by echoing the ending of the sparer, more eloquent endo, it illuminated the ending of that movie for me, showing that by not pursuing his love before shes ready, the guy is showing commitment and hope, a willingness to wait it showed his character had grown, also its something anyone who wants to get somewhere in life needs these days, so its good that filipino films are promoting this value",-1
2183,heres 4 stars,-1
2184,kathryn bernardo ate and left no crumbs,12
2185,"finally, i watched the highest grossing filipino movie of all time as well hello, love, goodbye was on my list since its official release with the new pairing i took some time to get into the mood all my filipino friends confirmed to me that the portrayal ofws is indeed a very accurate one it was indeed frustrating to watch the everyday struggle and hard work of educated young people in minor jobs to support their family nowadays it belongs to the normality to support their families through migration its indeed a very depressing atmosphere and all the problems and concerns were well portrayed by katheryn bernardo in this movie she did an amazing job as usual but this time the melodramatic vibe really flashed me i have to admit that i had my doubts to see katheryn in a movie without daniel but all my concerns were for nothing the whole superstar casting and the successful capture of the ofws situation makes this movie captivating i really enjoyed the realistic view and the reality that hits the viewer in every scene the survival and emotional struggle is detailed pictured and i really loved it that the characters stay true to themselves, no matter how hard is life to be honest, the depressing reality clash were indeed very much needed and an eye opener for a foreign audience the movie promises nothing and stays true to itself like its main protagonists",2
2186,uhmm i dunno 5 seems high,-1
2189,typical filipino romance didn't expect a great chemistry between the lead actors though so that's a plus,2

2193,"the title gave us a hint that joy and ethans relationship will have its beginning, middle, and end there were some really cheesy lines which i dont usually enjoy but turns out fine i think that it was just right that joy chose her dreams at the end than ethan, to whom she made her goals clear from the start the movie also tackled the experiences of the ofws, especially of hong kong domestic helpers, that some of them have no choice but to strive because of unequal opportunities as a whole, the movie made me feel a rollercoaster of emotions it was realistic and heartfelt",9
2197,me for nth time correcting my desi friends who watched this film that this is not a korean film but phillipine film still holds the same warmth there is something soo soothing about the female lead's face,15

2200,"i am so proud of herethan, mahal kita say it louder, joy",-1
2201,ive rewatched this 4 times already bye,1
2203,the undeniably charming chemistry between its lead duo will never be enough to uplift this semi unrealistic take on a somewhat star crossed love story alden richards may have had his fair share of so so performances here and there but kathryn bernardo literally carried the movie's weight on her shoulders as much as she carried her family in the story,-1
2204,well written and well acted amazing film,-1
2205,"not related to the film, dont bother reading every time i open netflix in our tv its always in her continue watching lmao i wonder how many times she has rewatched this on her own and she has seen it in the cinema with me too i dont know if its because i have siblings working abroad thats why she loves this or shes just a fan of alden lol like what most people have mentioned, ethan is the definition of creep and sadboi lol the worst combination also that december avenue song instantly triggers my fight or flight maybe if this movie just focused on joy and without ethans annoying antics lol... but kathryn and aldens acting are really good and im actually hoping for a reunion project really digging their on screen chemistry just some interesting observations hehe i love how philippine mainstream cinema like the highest grossing films is dominated by women and lgbt as it should , unlike hollywood which mostly caters to film bros lol but also the irony that we have the most misogynistic, sexist, homophobic piece of shit as pres the way many people here support movies that film bros might deem too feminine, i love that for us like if you go out on the streets and ask an ordinary pinoy any director they know, high chance that youll hear cathy garcia molina, joyce bernal, antoinette jadaone, which is the exact opposite in the international scene where names like lav diaz deserved tho , brillante mendoza, or erik matti are more recognized well isabel sandoval too but just referring to the ones based in ph well, at least female directors are popular amongst the locals haha unlike in other countries where the local and international scene are still heavily dominated by male directors anyways, overall i still enjoyed this but istg we really need tighter storylines and perhaps bigger budget for these mainstream movies lmao",15
2206,netflixstart time 8 16am,-1
2207,still one of my fave movie tf,1
2208,"this was surprisingly way better than i expected i honestly thought it would be corny but it kinda felt so real that some of it was really depressing, especially with the ofw stories certified stalkerboy low key bothered me the whole time but i knew my girl joy wouldnt let me down",-1
2210,"sorry talaga, direk cathy kasi i first watched this on my laptop thru a google drive link ganda pa rin kathryn bernardo has really improved, her performance here aged well she really did well in portraying the struggle of our filipina dhs hong kong, so close yet so far it's a colonial outpost that serves as a microcosm of global labor relations tired, underpaid, overworked, yet cheerful, patient third world women on its busy shopping streets facing their haughty, cruel, and privileged cantonese bosses who pride themselves in their neocolonial, anglo saxon upbringing the story is really familiar to me i saw how many women in my family worked abroad and some in hk and faced such hardships to provide for their own families here i hope the philippine revolution finally succeeds soon",-1
2211,"great method of torture at 1st watch, i shrugged off the idea of ethan being a creep but then again, tama naman pala that i should feel that way the part where he insistently tells joy to meet him to take back daw his kiss, and then went to a motel while having the fucking audacity to grin as she kisses him down",5
2213,"we know the real pull here is the heroine but may i please specifically hype the fight scene it was just wonderfully written and delivered i really appreciate the nuance, it didn't slack off to a more simplistic take i like how the romantic portrayal develops, although a few things can be said about ethan's persistence and there remains some lofty views that only movies are allowed to make anyway, i still have so much love for joy, both as a strong female character and as kathryn's strongest act third time around and still wept",9
2215,"the lived ofw experiences was the most compelling aspect of the movie and the romance should've been built around it, not the other way around also why did alden let kathryn eat him up like that in every scene with just the two of them",3
2216,rewatched it and liked it better this time around this film has more depth than it's given credit for probably cathy's best filmjust didnt like the fatphobia tho,1
2217,gusto kong bigwasan yung character ni alden all throughout the film like nagpaka paladesisyon ka para sa future ni joy without even once consulting her tapos siya pa selfish boy pack it up,0
2218,ang galing lang din talaga ni kathryn,0
2219,i loved the realities they showed n hardships that come w working abroad and the way their relationship progresses was nice,-1
2220,"cute a bit campy romance but gets outshined by the complex character arcs of real struggles faced by migrant workers and pressures put on them as well as international students especially a look into the hardships of filipinas trying to make way in more affluential countries fuck imperialism aside from the overly romantic scenes, the more platonic interactions between characters felt quite organic",2
2221,i feel like they should've focused on kathryn's character and the dh experience in hong kong,-1
2223,this movie had amazing acting and also showed how love isnt always happy,1
2224,film 833 of the 13 challengedirector cathy garcia molinawhat a nice surprise to find out the highest grossing phillipine film of all time was directed by a woman this was at its best whenever joy was onscreen as she was perfectly played by kathryn bernardo and her character was well developed and interesting,2
2225,"this is one of the best films of modern filipino cinema i would say especially in the field of mainstream media it's no surprise that the film is the highest grossing in the philippines i like how joy's character and how she narrates the film through her eyes i like how she's not ashamed to tell her job to one of her friends i like how she's so candid in trying to keep herself whole amidst the things that try to crumble her into broken pieces i like how she well portrays how awful and difficult it is for people like her to be steps closer in attaining her goals this is one of kath's best roles to date i also like how ethan made it a bit difficult for her to leave hong kong after falling into each other's intentions and vulnerabilities what's a bit problematic though is ethan's character especially in the beginning it could be a little offsetting if it were to be done to girls in real life with him being a bit pushy when a girl you like is already gate keeping herself from you but it's good that there was some character development from him going halfway through the film it's nice he understand joy has big plans to fulfill and he trusts they'll be together in time love is really the most complicated thing it makes you question if your own dreams are really worth giving up if you can have another one with the person you love but in the end you'll realize that your destiny is what your freewill desires anyway if dreams are worth fighting for, love can find a way to be a part of it in the end",2

2234,"when you love, all or nothing hello, love, goodbye is my first filipino film i've been looking forward to this one for a while i gotta say though, i think i prefer wong kar wai's portrayal of hong kong to cathy garcia molina's hello, love, goodbye tells a very standard love story that's been done numerous times before, and better a couple meets for a short amount of time in a foreign country, and then are parted by time this film is incredibly soap opera esque, and there are a lot of scenes with heavy over acting and some delicious scenery chewing the audio mixing is also all over the place the actors can usually be heard fine, but sometimes the music drowns out what they are saying during important scenes some of the dialogue is also really unintentionally hilarious, like the scene where a character is berated for opening a bar instead of becoming a doctor or store manager there are some genuinely sweet moments hidden amidst the saccharine sea that is hello, love, goodbye, but i couldn't help but feel that this movie is frighteningly similar to those inspirational romantic youtube videos that get roasted from time to time if you're looking for a light, modern pop romance film, you could do a lot worse than hello, love, goodbye it's silly, but sincere i personally struggled to care about this movie strongly, but i promise there are some really nice moments scattered throughout i think there is a really good movie buried in here, but it'll take some work to unearth it",7
2235,wouldve been so much better without aldens character,3
2236,"letter grade a amazing yep, i can confirm on a second rewatch, this is absolutely my favorite filipino film of all time yes, i'm a hopeless romantic, and yes this was absolutely moving and beautiful",2
2238,"my mother was literally like kath's character and i cried when she was in hardships, nailed it to the heart",3
2239,"i wasn't intending to watch this until i got rave reviews from friends i trust i appreciate that the movie showed the ofw experience specifically in hongkong and seeing the life that they have there is saddening this made me empathize more with filipinos who have to leave the country to make a living and to sacrifice their wants, comforts, and self to be able to thrive and give their family a good life the love story is heartfelt and heartwrenching it is quite refreshing for a mainstream film to end the movie with a promise between the leads instead of ending up together or the whole happily ever after that we usually get",2
2241,"the time has come at napanood ko rin ito nang buo the good thing here is hindi ni romanticize 'yung experiences ni joy as a breadwinner, as a dreamer, and as an ofw what i slightly do not like is joy and ethan's exchange of lines, ang corny teh or sadyang bitter lang ako",0

2248,"theres a constant struggle among love, family, and dreams as filipinos, we already grew up taking this huge responsibility to give back to our parents once we land a stable job and earn something to sustain ourselves and the needs of our family we need to adhere to this concern because the breadwinners were sometimes deprived to live their dreams because of the unexpected weight of responsibility we carry once we earn a degree it took a while for me to process things and calm myself from crying a good mix of kathryn and alden their tandem is an interesting one",2
2249,"march around the world 2022 7 30 i, for some reason, thought this was a bog standard cheesy rom com, and i put it on my potential watch list for this challenge because i knew i had some others with kind of heavy subject matter and wanted a few lighter options in the mix too i'll be honest, ethan's initial pursuit of joy is maybe questionable, and judging by the most popular review for this film, a lot of people could not see past that, which is a shame, i think once the characters actually connect properly this is a really sweet and lovely romance and as much time as that romance does take up, it's not at the expense of joy as a character she is always at the centre of this story, which is about so much more than a really quite cute love story i wasn't familiar at all with the cultural setting here, but i think there's enough context for everything that it's very easy to understand the employment situations, as well as the family commitments, and all the stress and pressure that comes with that joy and ethan's situations are different but they're a result of the same social, economic and familial restrictions obligations, and these things hang over their romance the whole time, which adds a layer of urgency and also sadness to them both there's a scene pretty early on with joy on a bus, and she bumps into an old college friend, there on his honeymoon, and it's just devastating kathryn bernardo is quietly heartbreaking in that scene, and she really does centre this entire film and later when she realises that she's been working towards an unattainable goal for her family, and now she finally gets to have a choice of what happens to her but it's not as simple as she hoped it might be, i was so invested in her that my heart was simultaneously soaring for her, while also breaking there's one or two little things in here that keep it from being 5 stars, but if you can see past ethan's somewhat questionable initial pursuit of joy then there's a really beautiful film here",9
2250,"beside from alden's creepy character vibes, i really liked the entire movie it puts into perspective how life is as a domestic worker in hong kong and has some really good romance and comedy scenes",2

2252,heartbreak is the national anthem and i sing it proudly,-1
2253,"i honestly felt that there are too many side characters that even if you remove them, the story still works there were also a lot of characters problems that are very repetitive circling around sacrifice there were some scenes that were too unrealistic like when joy meets her long distance ex in hk how convenient however, the main characters chemistry was built in an okay ish manner they started off very cringey until it built a foundation of character development especially for ethan technical wise, the film is good the little colour grading works for this type of film camera works were also on point and engages the audience to the energy of the characters",-1
2255,kathryn bernardo carried the whole movie this is the kathryn movie,12
2256,"the highest grossing filipino film of all time not counting inflation the most interesting aspect of this otherwise heinous picture is its idealized portrait of ofw life, which opens questions that are not only timely, but important discussions that need to be had about the philippine economy and its foreign relations the love story can effectively be removed and it would be a better whole",2

2263,3 stars para sa acting ni kathryn kasi siya lang naman nagdala ng movie na to,0
2264,"was expecting to enjoy this more, but didn't really i liked it as a story about how difficult it is for migrant domestic workers to make ends meet, but wasn't too much into the romance itself it got better over later on i guess mostly when joy stopped rejecting ethan so their relationship was less about ethan pestering her, while she wants him to go away but yeah not to say the film is bad though, i'd say it's been a good watch and i liked the ending",9
2265,"a good romance drama set in hong kong where the main character is working as a domestic helper to help her family back home in the philippines as the months get closer to her moving for new opportunities in canada, she meets a bartender also from the philippines and as they get closer, has to decide whether to stay or go while the romantic drama was a little too much for me in some parts, it was awesome to see a movie centered around characters representing the overseas population from the philippines, who probably make up the largest foreign population in hong kong i loved the non cliche ending and the characters were likable it is also the current highest grossing film from the philippines of all time, which is pretty awesome",2

2285,ganda talaga ang pure ng bawat scene at sobrang satisfying ng ending,0
2286,kathryn's best movie me thinks,3
2287,"i think ito na ang extent ng pagiging experimental ng star cinema, lol first and foremost, kathryn bernardo proved once again that she can evoke whatever emotion she wants from her audience she acts with her eyes, body language, speech tone, just overflowing with passion i don't quite get why every single major family in the film had a member who had some sory of disability it felt like an easy excuse to elicit sympathy from the viewers, which is problematic as pwds have been forever subject to being accessorized in films and tv however, alden himself did a great job in matching kathryn's splendid acting he was decent enough to keep me engaged played it safe on the ending of course, it had to have even a tinge of a happy ending because it is a mainstream film and lots of filipinos consider a film bad if it doesn't have a light or a positive leaning ending it was building up nicely to an emotional climax but the moment joy and ethan had that confrontation scene, everything that followed felt like an attempt to repair the sad atmosphere that it produced i wish the film maximized that misery and took a full on drama end maybe then it would have more impact the audience does not need to hear a full track while the scenes transpire tolerable, for sure kathryn carried it",13
2288,wanted to watch this when it was out but watched it now n like ew men r shit asf,1
2289,still holds my personal record for most tears shed in any film,-1

2294,"a heartfelt romantic comedy drama set in hong kong following the story of joy and ethan, two filipino immigrants its not a new story, but it blends the hardships, sacrifice, dreams, love realities of a overseas domestic worker quite empathetically the pairing of kathryn bernardo and alden richards was so charming sweet hello, love, goodbyes message is simple give yourself the chance to do what you want, get back up from disappointments, be courageous enough to love and choose whether you want to leave or stay the film doesnt portray bernardo and alden as some people who need your pitybut rather portrays the characters humanely, with stories and experiences that empower them to ultimately choose how to pave their own way for their futureswith or without each other a warm satisfying drama",2
2296,"i think i've watched this in cinema got sad how kathryn's willing to give everything for her family ay sarili na niyang present at future ang nag suffer also, duh college students na sila, marunong na 'yan mag isip you wake up, work, sleep, give money to relatives, repeat i think this film would have a better ending if it's just focused on kathryn, no alden lol",3
2297,"mahal na mahal kita, ethan pero sa ngayon, mas mahal ko sarili ko exactly joy sister you're so sexyyyyy",0
2298,ang pogi ni ethan,0
2300,"not this movie weaving a la la land esque romantic arc around very visceral filipino experiences sacrificial romantic and familial love, ofws overseas filipino workers , the eldest daughter being the pillar of the family, caregiving as profession and responsibility, globally dispersed family, survival mode as the only life mode, moving to the us canada in hopes to petition your family to move to be together, corny jokes jumping photoschoosing yourself feels new in the filipino cultural consciousness, but im here for that healthy individualization im not taking points off for the cheesy dialogue and dramatic acting because its part of the culture",2

2308,this is my first time watching a movie with my bestfriend,1
2309,"the last 20 minutes where joy finally has some self respect for herself really carried this movie because i really hate ethan lol the climax between ethan and joy was surprisingly good and i actually was impressed in the way that it becomes really self aware about what i think is the biggest crux for a lot of filipino romcoms about love being the answer, that love will just solve everything and make all the worlds problems go away i think...",9
2310,i truly enjoyed this movie because it's very realistic it's raw and genuine it's not your typical movie where everything magically falls into place and the female protagonist chooses love over her dreams yet she got her happily ever after this movie doesn't except its characters from consequences to the decisions they make joy knows the cards she should play and staying in hk isn't one of them,1
2311,sorry i don't love u,4
2313,this is so beautiful,6
2314,ganda naman kaya lang career v love,-1
2316,kathryn bernardo kathryn bernardo only carried the whole film,12
2317,"this film emanates comfort, uncertainty, and self worth and that is what philippine cinema should put out not hundreds of generic cringy ass rom com films joy, a struggling filipino dh, who has specific dreams for herself and her family meets ethan who doesn't exactly know what he wants a literal manifestation of the 'grumpy x sunshine' trope, and i'm here for it joy finds comfort in ethan, even if she isn't exactly looking for a relationship amid their emerging relationship, ethan finds himself filled with uncertainty as his time with joy comes close to its end he deeply hopes that joy will change her mind as he planned everything out for their future but this is where it gets tricky, joy has already made up her mind, from the start she knows what she wants, even ethan can't change her mind and i support and understand her all her life, she has put her family first, and this time she needs to prioritize herself ethan does not deserve joy's half self if she even chooses to stay, cause she will always have 'what ifs' and that would also be unfair for ethan in simple terms, joy needs to find herself to feel that she is her own person only then will she be able to give herself committedly to ethan, and he understood that in the end this is when two persons respect each other's dreams and are both willing to let go of each other to grow individually and come back when they're both ready alden kath kathniel, i still stand by this",2

2323,hoy kathryn ang galing mo,-1
2324,also alden richards is a fine guy tbh kathryns much better when shes paired with another guy anyway i love this film so much,3
2326,"a kathryn bernardo stan through and throughnot the first time i've seen this so i always knew ethan's character is so problematic, but i guess that's a point to be made so the development can have more depth a guy who's immature and foolish and always putting his heart above all else, learning that letting go is another form of loving when all he'd ever known is to go for what he can reach if it makes him happy, and a girl that lived her life so small and consuming due to the sacrifices needed to be made at every corner, finding the kind of love that presented her the choice that could be the turning point of everything in ethan, she found the strength to choose herself in joy, he found a love that encourages him to be more it was questionable and doomed from the start, but if i know anything about love, it's that enough of it can really be the euphoria you need in your darkest, heaviest days at the end, finding each other made them better and with just that, none of the love was lost",-1
2327,"choices are for the privileged people only yun yung take away ko sa movie na to, and i think thats very important also, i miss my partner its been a year since i said babalik ako ha katulad ni joy wishing that things will get better soon",0

2337,"philippines' highest grossing film it's good, for the most part there's a lot more here than i expected there's some interesting socio political and cultural commentary here about overseas filipino workers' economic conditions living in hong kong but it's all wrapped up in an overly melodramatic tone which i don't totally jive with kathryn bernardowho is fantastic in this btwsinging as badly as i did when playing singstar on the ps2 is a highlight of this film",2

2349,"ang dami kong nabasa at narinig na rave reviews ng pelikula na ito kaya na delay ang panonood ko i think i found my most favorite cathy garcia molina movie this is her best work and kathryn, wow i think i found a new respect to you as an actor some of my favorites 1 cinematography grabe ang ganda ng pag capture sa hong kong and how it tells the story of our domestic helpers2 the setting helped in the storytelling, hindi lang siya background joy and her choice as a woman galit talaga ako sa mga babaeng character sa pelikula ni cgm but joy gave me so much joy this is cinema add the scene where the character of cacai asked the question about women being selfish when she choose herself the neverending family struggle i guess it will not be a star cinema movie if there's no conflict with the family medyo makulit si ethan when he courted joyoverall, this was really a great movie please kathryn, continue making this kind of movie and choosing this type of character you have a new fan in me",-1

2381,i had no expectations on this movie but it turns out to be really nice iba yung chemistry nila and most of all it was relatable lalo na pinili ni joy yung life that she wanted and the character growth of ethan is amazing,15
2382,the best thing about this is the soundtrack which was also kind of butchered anyway kathryn carried,-1
2383,"kathryn carried this movie yeah i get the opinion that ow they showed the struggles of ph dh workers in hk very well nahhh, it's just kathryn doing her best that musical scoring is assall the stars i gave are just for kathryn, btw, that's how hard she carried the movie",3

2386,"through this movie, i feel for the ofws, especially those in hongkong my aunt was a caregiver for years, and she had to retire early because it gave her parkinson's for me, more than the romance or heartbreak, this film is about resilience and the quiet grief carried by these incredibly strong, hardworking souls who are mourning the lives and dreams taken from them by circumstance",2

2399,"if that were entirely out of the picture, i would have rated this higher that said, despite that, this was a pleasant surprise kathryn was a powerhouse performer i had low expectations for alden but i wasn't at all disappointed they made a familiar though not personally relatable story of the ofw feel personal to me lastly, a not bad movie gets even better when they go with a great ending, which this one had, in my opinion",3

2416,i super duper to the max love you,4
2417,this movie was really sweet it doesnt reinvent anything but i dont think thats necessary for every film this was the first filipino film that i watched and i appreciated the parts showcased about some of the issues the diaspora face i was able to find myself being able to relate to portions of it because of a major spotlight on issues like immigration we see kathryn bernardos character joy deal with so many struggles on a day to day...,2

2439,mas mamamangha ako siguro kung sa direksyon na 'yon sila tumungo we would've seen a side of the new gen mainstream filipino actors we've never seen before i would've loved to see that kind of performance from kathryn especially although i did think of how the struggling migrant worker storyline maybe did necessitate a dramatic execution ang ganda pa naman ng backdrop the additional star is for accuracy kasi super relate daw siya as a former domestic helper in hk kasing edad niya rin 'yung karakter ni kathryn nung lumuwas siya props sa research,0
2440,magiging highest grossing philippine movie ba to kung hindi to maganda pinakamagandang local movie na napanood ko,2
2441,"the first is with joy and her experiences as a filipino overseas domestic helper living in hong kong we not only delve into her journey of wanting a better life for her and her family, but we also get a glimpse of this particular subculture of filipinos living in hong kong, who have carved out a little community for themselves away from their home between poor pay, long hours of work, and shuffling through countless jobs and hustles to make ends meet, seeing these workers come together to host their own makeshift beauty pageant, or weeping together as they're watching filipino dramas on someone's phone while they're in the middle of illegally peddling retail, it's those small moments of solidarity that adds a charming touch it adds an extra dimension to this life that isn't just all doom, gloom, and abuse and sadly there's a lot of it to make you sympathize with their struggle they made sure to make ethan seem like such a bad boy who can get any woman he wants and they display this by his friends joking around about how all his flings are named after a day in the week , yet he drops them all for joy because i don't know actually maybe it's at this crucible where a bachelor who has no reason to like a woman who doesn't come from money suddenly becoming obsessed with her that people find truly romantic, but then he admits to later gaslighting and manipulating her the entire time towards the end but he did it for love that cute montage of them taking selfies all over iconic landmarks in hong kong while a filipino ballad lulls in the background, is supposed to ignite lots of warm feelings in the belly, but for those who didn't buy into this relationship, can feel misplaced the only part of the romance i liked were joy and ethan's friends cheering their relationship on others may see them as one dimensional who act as nothing but cheerleaders, but these filipino romances know how to make really damn great cheerleading supporting characters that makes you wish you had them in your life now if only these male leads can actually be decent guys for once",2
2442,"there's something deeply depressing about stumbling across a boy you loved in the past inside a crowded train, who's there with his pregnant wife and having to tell him i ended up like my mother after all and i kept wanting to explore more of her history and depth i honestly wish the movie was longer, enough that we could see her family, friends and their stories more they clearly have their own stories that are reminiscent of all the non chinese hongkongers who sacrifice everything to suffer in a foreign nation for money the opening montage is so good and reminded of kimi no nawa's and i loved that i could trace the geography of my country in this movie either way, this movie was so so good",2
2443,still feels the same huhuhu career over love kung love ba nimo pilion ba nimo siya over your dreams ug kung love nimo nganong papilion man nimo sya huhuhu dinakomaguyab katden,0

2565,"hello, love, goodbye revolves around the lives of joy and ethan both are filipino workers based in hong kong joy is a domestic helper who dreams of working as a nurse in canada while ethan is a bartender who is waiting out his permanent residency just like how most romantic films go, these two characters meet, fall in love, then... life happens hello, love, goodbye not just a love story, its a life story about making a choice between love and chasing after your dream joy, as the breadwinner, works hard to give herself and her family a better life she also actively engages in her buy and sell business every sunday, and even takes on a second job at night as a waitress she desperately needs funds not only to send back home, but also to finance her dream of flying off to canada to practice nursing, her original course ethan, on the other hand, is on the road to redemption after letting down his own family he was supposed to have gained hong kong residency already but he left and went to the us to pursue a girl he loved one is burdened by her family while also committed to her dreams, the other tethered to the idea of making amends to the people closest to him, and a relationship is the last thing they need in their lives point of the story was about making choices, no matter how difficult they may be and she is partly correct choice is a luxury only the privileged can afford it is true that not all of us can have a fair opportunity in life, thats why when we had a chance we should make sure to grab it and used it joy, in the end, realized that she also has to think of herself first and made her own choices for herself, even if it means that she cant be with ethan and its not selfish to choose your priorities first, since no one can fully understand your decisions even they say so choosing yourself is not an act of selfishness no matter how many reasons you may have to stay and give up on your dreamseven if these include people you love the mostin the end, choosing yourself is still the most fulfilling decision you can do of course, if i am in the position of ethan, i will also do everything for joy to stay, but we cant control everything sometimes loving someone also means giving them wings to explore horizons of growth",7

2619,needed to watch a melodramatic film just to feel some kind of an inspiration for me to write a story for my screenwriting class,-1
2620,"a romance different enough from the formula to make it interesting yet close enough to keep it undeniably familiar the first third of the film was filled with much promise, dipping its toes on social commentary by exploring the world of filipino domestic helpers in hong kong in the films first conflict, we see joy kathryn bernardo deftly running away from police even hiding in the garbage this must not be her first time was this film going to have something to say about the filipino diaspora once it begins to introduce the romance, though, it left that promise to immerse deeply in the tried and tested formula which is not such a bad thing whats refreshing about it is its confident departure from two dimensional, well defined fantasy an attempt to re define the star cinema romantic film, as it were i once read about the star cinema audience s rigid expectation of their movies, that they enter the theater fully expecting their happily ever afters and their convenient closures while i disagree with this sense of non adventure, it is naive to discount this insight significant enough to define the film watching market for generations garcia molinas cache is exactly in catering to this sensibility the scene of ethans alden richards introduction is as jarring to joy as ethans character is to the film to be honest, i kept on expecting him to revert to some sort of savior trope in joys life all throughout the film, even in his turn as a toxic nice guy in a pivotal moment further in the story to her credit, garcia molina gave ethan the room to decide realistically and bear the weight of these choices consequences it was surprising how natural richards was able to play ethan the writers forced his character to say some purely cheesy lines for the sake of saying them as lip service to this twitter generation but richards was somehow able to pull it off and bernardo did well enough in her turn as the headstrong joy that i merely had to stop comparing her to nadine lustre and start appreciating what she was giving to the film the chemistry was there, too, in that i could see them pulling off a dialogue heavy romance a la that thing called tadhana, which is in no way easy to do those scenes where they were wasting time beside each other were gold if our mainstream romance is really shaping up to this mold influenced by the efforts of antoinette jadaone, dan villegas, sigrid bernardo, and others from the independent scene then im definitely looking forward to more pleasantly surprising, insightful entertainment don jaucian, how black sheep is trying to disrupt philippine cinema, https www",2
2622,so this is a story of a woman trying to break free from manipulation of some creepy asshole small dick energy tryna be cool stranger guy,10
2623,first half was fine but the last 35 was great great payoff for some of the character motivation that was built up throughout the movie made me cry a bit,1

2696,"i appreciate the premise and how it's been told the realities of being an ofw and how specific it is in the context of the filipino community in hong kong is a preference thing, but alden and kathryn held their own, but apparently doesn't work together for me and it is a romance so it's kind of fundamental it could be beautifully picturesque in a theater screen, but with the ratio it felt very tv show this is basically me nitpicking but i would appreciate a noticeable difference with tv and movie but overall, not a bad watch not really will i consciously choose to watch this again to kill time, maybe does it deserve to be the highest grossing filipino film the cast was heavily influencing for that",2

2715,best kathryn bernardo movie acting for me,3
2717,"there have been a number of films about the life of an overseas filipino worker, as our country is unique to have a very significant population pursuing this route among these films, there are gems that stood the test of time, and probably influenced real life and further films, as we see in a scene in this film what makes hello, love, goodbye enjoyable is how effortless it presents the culture, the active and passive decisions, that ofws take, to fulfill their purpose while there is a wide cast of characters with their corresponding side stories, nothing feels misplaced maybe a few were quite less filling, the different facets and permutation of circumstances of filipinos living abroad, provides a peek to a rich tapestry for wider stories of these characters more than how these stories are told, as enhanced by the shot choices and camera movement that let you fall in love with the cityscapes, is the courage to not shy away from the route of the socially desired, mainstream choice until when though do filipinos need to be pressured to make these choices, to enter these circumstances",2

2749,"god, when will the philippines retire the overly persistent dude wearing down the uninterested girl with his charms this film kind of makes up for it with the sheer support radiating off both the characters later in the movie, but it, along with other well worn cliches, threaten to wear the movie down thankfully, though, it doesn't it's still very much typical pinoy romcom, but it's also one of the best examples of the genre there is poignancy, clear set goals from each character, and most of all, a lack of certainty in the end of their love story joy's young cousin doesn't overcome the hardships she faces as a newly minted domestic helper, but she does tap out and get out of them joy and ethan come together at a time in joy's life when she is just about to leave to canada in search of greener pastures hello, love, goodbye gets that it as a movie has experienced true life, and despite being cornier than most, it's got its finger on the pulse of the way people love and laugh, especially when time is so fleeting this is the best acting work on either of the two sides, kathryn bernardo and alden richards a change of pace brings out the best in you, i think",2
2750,this movie hits straight to the heartstrings when youre a breadwinner whose brain is haywired into thinking that you need to provide everything for your family i really enjoyed watching it it wouldve been a great movie if it werent for ethans constant stalking and weird antics towards joy,9

2754,slice of life drama that you can empathize with imperfect characters trying to achieve dreams as overseas workers in hongkong both bernardo richards carried a lot of emotional baggage over cute romance,2
2756,tbh i had some reservations about watching the film at first because i thought the duo's dynamic wouldn't work but so far they did pretty great there are some pacing issues at the second half but overall it's a pretty solid film the film unfailingly showcased kath's acting prowess and versatility alden is so charming too and proved that he can go toe to toe with kath i wouldn't mind seeing this pair in future projects if the opportunity where to arise,3
2758,"sobrang ganda ng chemistry nilang dalawa honestly the woman that you are, kathryn bernardo plus napapantayan ni alden, kudos to him the film really shows the reality of life every character is imperfectly perfect, having their own flaws im glad the film ended the way it is gives them time to grow",13

2783,"ive been putting off watching this movie for years now because when it first came out, several of my friends mentioned that joy reminded them of me and then i noticed that netflix is removing this title tomorrow so i thought why not hello, love, goodbye is yet another ode to our countrys unsung heroesour overseas workers, but with a more authentic touch it takes on new angles and anchors its narrative specifically to hong kong, which coincidentally happens to be one of my favorite places and the only country im inclined to visit more than once in my lifetime this film reminded me of my yayas my family helped to get to hong kong to seek greener pastures and my own relatives who took a gambit and flew out of the philippines to get a better shot at life as well it spoke to me as a fellow ate eldest sister whod do anything for my family, even if it meant doing so at my own expense hello, love, goodbye is an honest portrait of our culture and a reminder that we filipinos have a shared existence that transcends time and placefind comfort in that spoke to me on so many levels",7

2796,"kathryn bernardo is a superstar in the philippines, once again she nailed her role, an independent, hardworking, brave, ambitious but overloaded ofw joy this movie tells the story of ofw in hong kong, or perhaps it also reflects the life of them in other countries, their hope, their dilemma and their sacrifice despite kathryn and alden delivered solid performance, the character of ethan is not that lovable, most of the time hes pushy , ' , ' ending spoiler alert luckily at last joy insisted to follow her dream, didnt end with typical cheesy love story my review on hello, love, again 2024",-1
2797,"somehow combines all movie character tropes possible in the typical pinoy cinema fashion but still had me balling my eyes outthis is truly peak pinoy cinema beyond the portrayal of a healthy relationship finally , i truly enjoyed the portrayal of dh workers in hk in full transparency and rawness especially with sending remittance back home as kathryn also to save money pag ipunan for her nursing agency to fly to canada domestic labor is one of the main sources of income for many filipino women both at home and abroad joy's situation is very lucky compared to other experiences i've heard of dh being abused and exploited by their bosses other than being a film starring kathryn bernado and surprisingly not daniel padilla, i wonder what power this film could've had on shedding light on the exploitation, rights, and working conditions of dh workers and the outsourcing image we have as filipinosanother line that truly resonated with me was when joy's ama reprimanded joy for abandoning her disabled daughter, annie, on the street joy's amma exclaimed, how could you do this to her, i thought u loved her this made me think about the complexity of love dh workers face in ur job description, you must love other peoples children, u care for them daily, watch them grow up, and essentially fill in this role of a parent to these children all while being miles away from your own family and often times unable to spend quality time with them for years until your contract expires to what extent to dh workers feel love towards the children they care for while simultaneously feeling guilt that they cannot be there for their own family or children one possible answer in resolving these complex feelings of love, guilt, and regret is by reminding yourself your sense of purpose in which most of these dh workers find purpose in their love for their family willing to sacrifice to put food on the table and support the education of their loved ones yaya is fantastic documentary that follows the life of a dh worker who in the director's, justin cheung's, words, helped build a family at the expense of her own",2

2854,"this is cathy garcia's redemption after a disappointing film, the hows of us i was very impressed on how they showed the struggle and working conditions of filipino domestic helpers in hong kong the storyline might be predictable yet it is straight to the point, and effective to touch the audiences star cinema might repeatedly used their formula for a romantic drama comedy film but they handled it properly the side story of kathryn's and alden's family are justified to be part of the story for us to understand their present decisions the friends from both sides are only present for comedic purposes but it can be problematic as it serves distraction to the real issue though, i appreciate the presence of kathryn's companions who are also domestic helpers as well, alden's pick up lines are so irritating and i am happy kathryn was not doing it above all, this is a breakthrough performance of kathryn bernardo as she matured to handle a strong female character and let go from her previous fragile roles this film proves that kathryn does not need daniel to be recognized as a great actress",2

2918,"i watched this film for my thesis, and i loved it its more than just a typical romance film because it also explored the struggles and plights that ofws experience plus, it delivered a beautiful message about dreams and why we shouldnt give up on them despite the setbacks we encounter ramdam na ramdam ko yung emotions ng story, and ang galing nina kathryn at alden dito they gave such moving performances however, as much as i love this film, there are some things i didnt like too many subplots, and not all of them were done well as the film focused on joy and ethans love story, many subplots got overshadowed and lost their emotional impact the one with joys mother towards the end wasnt even built up properly i appreciate the representation but these disabled characters were just... there and why is it that both of joy and ethans fathers were disabled i feel like they couldve written the conflict without making ethan a red flag character without making him disregard joys dream if they spent more time on it, it wouldve hit harder and wouldve really highlighted mary dales plight as an ofw nevertheless, despite these criticisms of mine, i really love this film it made me smile a lot today",-1
