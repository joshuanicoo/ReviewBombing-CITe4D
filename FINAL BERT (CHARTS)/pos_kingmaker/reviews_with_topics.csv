0,"it showed what it is like to live with extensive wealth and how the marcos regime used it for political power and their self interests this is a must watch film for those who wish to see the marcos' perspective on martial law and their countless political movements this documentary shows the truth, through direct interviews with the marcoses, and it is up to you if you are going to believe it as john henry newman would say we can believe what we choose but we are answerable for what we choose to believe",0
1,"prescient and illuminating as i write ferdinand marcus junior or 'bong bong' has been elected president of the philippines, so it's a good time to view this documentary about the marcos dynasty, its rise, its fall in the peoples revolution of 1986, and the gradual and dramatic rise again of its fortunes in particular this film focuses on the surprisingly influential, some might say malevolent role that imelda marcos played half of todays filipino voters were not alive for the first marcos era, but i was there in late 1985 and saw the huge disparity between the rich and poor, and just how hated the marcos regime was at the time if you want to know something of the true story of the marcos 'dynasty' see this fine doc",0
2,well worth watching amazing documentary about privilege and the sociopathic mindset the film shines on the ugly politics of the philippines,0
3,"excellent insight into vile monsters i love the philippines, visited many times and my longterm gf is there this documentary is wonderfully put together but leaves me sad to see a country i am so fond of suffering even today from what these two people did her state of mass delusion is clear for all to see in this excellent piece of work",0
4,"i liked how it started off making us think it was going to be a lifestyles of the rich and famous and slowly peeled away the facade and leaves you with the punch to the gut this is what happens to you when you drink your own kool aid folks in a world where social media can be manipulated to create alternate realities, these historical revisionists will find it even easier to get away with murder god help us all",0
5,"very intersting despite being ruined it is a story of how corruption enters a nation and stays there forever the documentary is very intersting in this aspect she paints the obvious corrupt opposition as saints apart from that, a very interesting documentary worth watching",0
6,"perception is real and the truth is not with the marcoses' consistent effort to rewrite history, this documentary reminds us that behind the grandeur and elaborate schemes of the marcoses are the stories of pain and sorrows of the victims, which are not mere perception but the truth as greenfield's style is apparent in the documentary, it did not fail to capture the depressing history of the philippines under the marcoses and what may be an apparent future if they were put again into position",0
7,"the kingmaker film review the kingmaker is a documentary written and directed by lauren greenfield the film follows the political career of imelda marcos from the start of her political career with her husband ferdinand marcos, the fall of their power and exhile to hawaii, and then their resurgence after her husbands death and rise of the political career of her children especially her son bongbong marcos this film does a good job of contrasting the story imelda portrays versus the reality of those under her rule imelda will say how great her husbands reign was then you have individuals speak about the atrocities of what occurred i found the film very informative as someone who did not know about the subject matter going in i also appreciated how the film showed the current scene of the philippines with bongbong running for vice president and who is president as i write this 6 years after the film came out overall, i think this is a worthwhile watch to learn about the history of the philippines political dynasty from 1965 1986, and then again around 2016",0
8,uncovering the fantasy world of the marcoses brilliant documentary it shows how much you can do with money it can turn lies to history,0
9,an eye opener highly recommend this i've never paid much read any attention to filipino politics but will be following along the 2022 election with interest,0
10,"dark truths are there if your eyes are open this is an incredibly well put together documentary imelda marcos doesn't exactly shoot herself in the foot she is too smart to do that, but you nonetheless get to see the realities she so flagrantly ignores whilst living in her self made fantasy world how many billions has this power crazed matriarch squirreled away in 140 countries across the world there are only 8 and a bit billion people on the planet and handing each one a single dollar might seem like generosity but this very much hides the manipulations of the marcos clan we note other world leaders seem to be in the same exclusive club as this gurning despot lord help us all",0
11,"outstanding and riveting documentary the kingmaker 2019 release 100 min is a documentary about the life and times of imelda marcos, erstwhile first lady of the philippines 1965 1986 as the movie opens, we are in manile, 2014 , and imelda is visiting the old neighborhood the presidential palace i miss the clout of being first lady , she laments, while wondering if her appearance and make up for the interview is ok we then go back in time, as we look at her very modest upbringing until she catches the eye of ferdinand marcos while in a beauty contest before we know it, they marry and marcos vies to become president of the philippines at this point we are 10 min into the documentary couple of comments this is the latest documentary from writer director lauren greenfield, best known for her 2012 documentary the queen of versailles here she seemingly gets unfettered access to imelda and her entourage, and she lets imelda tell her side of the story, one in which of course imelda is but a shining bright star in the darkness that is the filipino sea of poverty the great thing is that greenfield doesn't have to manufacture anything imelda does it for her greenfield of course give ample screen time to opposing views, including survivirs of the martial lawera 1972 1980 , during which torturing was rampant, and oh, lest we forget the marcoses stole an estimated 8 10 billion with a b while in office and if all of this isn't enough, greenfield follows the vice predential election campaign in 2015 16 of bongbong marcos son of imelda , which itself becomes as revelating as anyting just watch when confronted with issues of ill gotten wealth , imelda simply shrugs it off as does bongbong bottom line the kingmaker is an oustanding and riveting documentar, period the kingmaker premiered on showtime in 2019, which i somehow missed, but i recently caught it on showtime on demand and it is available on other vod platforms too if you have any interest in lifestyles of the rich and famous , or how depots fleece an entire country for decades, i'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion",0
12,insight in something unseen interesting story about something i knew nothing about a political insight in a very important story of a world in unbalance,0
13,"i wish this would be played in schools you can find it in youtube for free, this documentary was not made for malicious purposes the marcos family themselves tell the story, not some director who can't even do their research properly",0
14,"marcos heist one line that caught me off guard is what bongbong's son said about his career cause you know he wanted to do physics, math, biology but my grandfather the late president is like there's no money in that, switch to politics that explains a lot about their family precise and well researched documentary",0
15,it's not about shoes loved the kingmaker and also one of those subjects so sure of themselves that they have no problem saying things that are incriminating imelda reveals a lot without caring the correlation between her and trump are closer than you think,-1
16,"the movie documentary is well research, balanced and no biases towards any of the personality featured fact checking is evident towards any of the claims by imelda that none was killed nor tortured that only good things happened during the regime its now 2022 and the presidential election is coming and the son's dictator is running for the highest position against the same person who beats him during the 2016 vice presidential election the tide is changing this time because of the emergence of young voters gearing towards the new wave of politicians but its harder to fight for votes knowing that the machinery handling them is leaning towards the marcoses this movie helped me get to know what type of person imelda and their family their tagline babangon muli is not for the filipino people suffering for the effects of covid 19, its for their family to go back to the malacanan palace and get back the power and clear their names from all the charges",0
17,"excellent documentary to all the people believing in somebody coming in and just giving away crumbs to make you shut up and just stop complaining, while they are living the grand life with money stolen from you and your countryman you just can see how they really are true selves because they can't help it",0
18,beautiful documentary,1
19,"became president to maximize wealth imelda said it herself marcos wanted to be president because he wanted to maximize his wealth and talent when a president supposedly gets fewer pesos than a private entity execs this documentary offers an interesting take on the marcoses it serves as a prelude to the current political landscape in the philippines it brings two contrasting narration of events but with a nice treatment where the viewer, no matter how naive, will understand who's telling the truth this modern take on story telling is designed for the youtube generation it quickly moves from one topic to the other so as to keep the audience attention didnt waste any minute thank you for this documentary every filipino should watch this",0
20,this is truly and eye opener i'd recommend for you to watch this,1
21,"imelda shines a light this documents the darkest side of human nature the kingmaker shines a light on those who wish only wealth and power, and don't care how they get it the correlation between her and hillary clinton are closer than you think",0
22,"top directing the great thing about this documentary is the way it switches after the first hour,from feeling sorry for the monster that is imelda to feeling disgust but not only that,listening to the people who have tried to change things and their punishment thearafter trying to defend what is arguably one of the most beautiful places on earth",1
23,"best documentary i watched in a while a very sharp and witty journalism, every clip is included for a reason and contributes so well to the storytelling",1
24,everybody saying we shouldnt have given imelda any air time is 1 missing the point 2 misunderstanding the creative contextthis movie is a great glimpse into everything thats wrong w the philippines and uses stellar cinematography to achieve that,0
25,revealed a lot of controversies about the marcoses that were never taught in history class,0
26,that is basically it stupid enough to let our ignorance lead the way to marcoses reign in leadership,0
27,"imelda marcos in the kingmaker 2019 this statement right here can sum up the propaganda that the marcoses is instiling to the people since the 1990s , the history that they are trying to deny, distort, and dispose, and their service that was never for the filipinos but for those who are in their exclusive class most highlighted by marcos' quote about public service being a chore other than the marcoses' edifice complex, the extravaganza, and their lavish lifestyle, imelda's quote about giving birth to the world is one of her notable ambitious quest in the documentary the tone during the segment where she indirectly states love conquers all while the extrajudicial killings during the martial law as well as the contrast between the poor and the rich who uses them as props to display performative authenticity for their campaign played perfectly juxtaposed imelda's quest how can a mother treat those animals who she banished from their homeland and caged them in calauit islands to make a sort like noah's ark paradise while she cast away those people who truly lived in the island from the start there should be a mandatory course or subject in elementary and in high school that will explain what happened in the 70s and until today and not just with a paragraph like in modules book that one can overlook and skip but with the details that engaged to the essence of the terror of corruption checked by professionals in the field of history the people like you shall not look for the stars through the luxury that was bought with taxpayers' money but through the grounds where you stand, through the land that was invaded, freed, and invaded again by its own people, and through people like you who yearns for a tomorrow where one can exist without worrying for their basic human rights and where the government truly served what it is mandated to be",0

32,for thesiss purposes,1
34,"its easy to write about this film, and also extremely difficult personally, id rather talk about the difficult part writing an easy review simply means pointing out how the resurgence of authoritarian legacies is happening everywhere, and how films like this serve as warnings to the public thats a straightforward approach",0
36,"its difficult and its also scary in the sense that if these people are brought to power again, theres a very big chance that the sins of the past will be committed again in the future and since then, the filipinos have yet again elected another marcos and duterte back in government lets vote wisely sana tama kayo tama nga kami",0
37,"the documentary is not just about imelda thank goodness, but the political situation throughout and post the marcos reign",0
39,"now who told this bitch that shes the mother of the philippines give up that dreammmm when you lose your money... your mo your mother... you lose everything that was the best years of marcos because that was when he was able to give the philippines sovereignty, freedom, justice, human rights... girlypop lying through her teeth fr lmfao the poor giraffes and zebras and other animals grabbed out of their natural habitat...",0
40,imelda delulu,0
41,"yes, it may have shown imelda's bullshit and the effects of their corruption but they were still given a microphone to blast their lies into i think philbert dy said it best in his review there are no two sides when telling the story of the marcoses somewhere along the way, the film seems to come to the realization that imelda isn't the harmless old biddy that they thought she was but it's too late they talked to her, and gave her yet another chance to say the vile things she's always been saying",0
42,delulu si imelda,0
43,"filipinos will watch this and like, heeelll yeah feed the rich",0
45,"this includes those who recognise their wrongdoings but simply sit back, because such lenience is what allowed the marcoses to once again set foot on philippine soil with no punishment i hold no remorse when i say that, even at her age, imelda deserves to bide what time she has left behind bars i do not say this because of my lack of faith, but no human will ever be certain of what comes after, so how can we trust that they shall face their sins while there are still living witnesses to their crimes i appreciate the subtle humor in allowing imelda to spew lies, then immediately placing true, opposing statements right after ex when imelda claimed that no people lived on calauit island, followed by residents themselves speaking on how they were displaced these are general facts we already know afterthought ive realised that this documentary serves as an introduction for foreigners still, it is not as critical as it could be some may come out of this still having a neutral or even positive opinion on the marcos family, especially with imelda posing herself as this elegant peacemaker when she is nothing of the sort the marcoses think they are royalty when every bit of high class society they got to experience was only made possible through the ill gotten wealth of the masses",0
46,imelda marcos pakarat,0
47,we have this and the ppl still chose marcos in 2022 shame,0
48,"a really really good documentary i learned a lot about the history of my maternal country which i admittedly only knew surface level before it didn't go super super deep into every historical aspect as this was more of a character study of imelda, the charming, manipulative, flamboyant, delusinal first lady behind some of the worst years of philippine dictatorship but it does go into the present day as well as talk about some of the atrocities of the marcos dictatorship period also gross to see how the us has its hands in the pies of foreign govts i really think imelda believes her job is to mother everyone, to mother the country i think she really believes that is her purpose anyway going to high school in the philippines was crazy bc i've literally been at the same parties as the children of these politicians and dictators like literally gossip girl philippines",0
49,imelda marcus should've been a comedian,0
50,", the son of the late dictator, won the presidential election during that time, i was still grieving and honestly, i still am over the fact that despite his familys wickedness, despite their crimes against the filipino peoplehis son still managed to win i was new to these things back then, and english was still a challenge for me but when i heard imelda marcos utter those words, my jaw dropped although i was still new to in depth politics during that time, i was shocked by how she spoke about some of the worst politicians of her era with such pride and admiration not to mention how rich she became, not through hard work or service, but through theft disguised as glamour",-1
51,"now this might strike some viewers as harsh, but i believe everyone involved in this story should die",0
53,i love fas cism hion imelda marcos,0
55,"my biggest flex is being able to tell ppl my dad participated in the people power revolution in the philippines, blocking military tanks and protecting ballot boxes from being hijacked by marcos during the electionthat being said if he were alive today he would be livid to see the state of the philippines now 3 insane watching this in 2025 in the midst of having to witness history repeat itself every day... what a fucking joke lol",0
57,imelda starts spouting lies whenever she gets the chance,0
59,ahhhh yes the classic tale of a corrupt queen,0
60,"the gun can kill only up to your grave, but the media can kill you beyond your grave and to infinity",0
61,"what i love the most about lauren greenfields films is that she lets her subject and the material speak so clearly that you can understand everything that shes implying the film opens up with mrs marcos driving through an impoverished street in the philippines, looking sorrowful covered in designer clothing and pieces of jewelry that could probably remake the entire neighborhood she takes out her wallet and hands out 50 pesos to each of the residents who clamor to her window once they see who she is and what she has in her hands her hands move with the precision of a coin o matic, only dispersing one crisp bill per person this is all she can manage to provide and all she thinks the deserve the film documents the atrocities, glamour, abuses, and scandal of the marcos regime while covering bong bong marcoss bid for vice president the parallels to americas current fascist regime are apparent the image of mrs marcos that emerges is that she never grew out of the child who was abandoned by her mother and was not taught the true meaning of love love to her is money and show, not progress those who do not know the meaning of love cannot give it",0

82,i swear to god if i hear another mother from her mouth one more time...,0
84,"this documentary was not just meant to inform the people it was a warning a warning that the sins of the past would come back to haunt the filipino people, and they have we, as filipinos, glorified the rich and powerful, while the poor who fought back were treated as criminals the rich became gods, the supposed benefactors of the poor, when in truth, what they gave was only a fraction of what they had stolen they set the rules on how to plunder the people it may not always be under the same name or family, but it is carried out in the same way if we want change, we must believe that it is not a question of when but of how we must commit to a long term process of change, not fall for empty promises despite all this, i remain optimistic that these recent issues of corruption will open the eyes of those who were once blinded by words and false promises the filipino people should no longer be bound by biased perceptions we are slowly beginning to see the truth we are being played and i hope these events will finally serve as the catalyst for change a change in governance, a change in mentality, and a change for the betterment of the philippines",0

153,"now is what's important, so the past is past the first time i saw this documentary was in early 2020 i was in the living room with my parents, my tita and my lola they were all alive during martial law i recall how annoyed my family were as imelda talked about her side of the story and how sad it was to see the country turn their backs on the marcoses even then, perhaps due in part to my family's influence, i was heavily critical of the marcoses and their claims, as well as the rhetoric of then president rodrigo duterte this was months before the pandemic that was poorly addressed by duterte's administration, three years before bongbong would be elected straight to the presidential seat, and six years before duterte would be charged with crimes against humanity by the icc and sent to the hague while his followers claimed that he was unjustly arrested i love the way that this documentary was shot the juxtaposition of the lavish marcos spendings with the effects they have had on the lowest sectors of society do a good job at providing insight into the sheer amount of ill gotten wealth they have procured over the years the intimate interviews we get from this documentary are also a huge highlight for me it makes me wonder how the crew were able to get so many high profile people for this documentary in retrospect, it is almost horrible foreshadowing to see all this talk of bbm's race to vice presidency when he is currently our president it's like he got what he wanted and more what does it say about us as a country that we are willing to let the son of a dictator and kleptocrat, as well as their family, back into power or rather, what does it say about our education systems and efforts to retain the facts of the martial law era to still see the marcos family in power shows that they really did essentially get away almost scot free at this point in time, it is more imperative than ever to never forget what their dynasty has done to our country, and to never again repeat the mistakes of the past i am thankful that from a young age, my family's stories and experiences living under the marcos regime have been instilled in me i am thankful that i have people in my life to make sure that i remember our history",0

157,"always rewatch worthy for me, and my favorite part about the whole thing is how imelda's anecdotes are always juxtaposed with anecdotes and facts that prevent the viewer from buying into imelda's delusion the film panders to apologists and fanatics that want to hear from imelda herself, then actively attempts to shatter the grandiose and morally upright edifice that imelda forwards still though, i think we should never ever give imelda the spotlight in the first place, since the marcoses have insane ways of twisting words and narratives",0

163,"i've watched this too many times but the initial feeling has never left it's one thing to have a white director try to spell out the bloody history of a country she's never known, it's another to give imelda the platform and attention she's always had in abundance but still seem to feel like she lacks which is pretty much appropriate considering her insatiable desire not only for attention, but also power and glory but i guess only a white director could have ever stepped foot in their mansion, could have used her prestige and privilege to make the interview feel like flattery despite it being a portrait of a murderous family, could have gotten the funding to even make this possible i am torn between two things on the one hand, my background in psychology has me looking at everything as a case study, and what is more interesting than a powerful family who built their fortune and influence on violence presidency, and expect a divided nation to discern for themselves when things could be so easily taken out of contextespecially those under the false illusion of the absolute goodness of the marcoses, looking only for what will reinforce their perceived truths i had faced the dilemma of being in the middle of it all, as at that time i was working in an artist collective that organized an annual film festival, which had this at the center of the programming we also organized screenings and talkbacks in different areas in the country, but make no mistake it was an ethical dilemma for everyone involved how will it live beyond its 2 3 year festival circuit lifespan how will it be viewed as it is, a decade later, without the talkback discussions and with all of the martial law survivors gone there are thousands, if not millions, of stories that are yet to be told in my hometown i can recall a few quite easily, with the remnants of the dictatorship still very much alive in every corner of our island it does not help that the victims and survivors in the documentary felt more like a testament to the power of the marcos family than the actual holders of this historical narrative this should not have been the story of imelda but the story of the filipino people who have fought against the seemingly immovable force of the dictatorship this should have been a portrait of the force that moved against them and carved out a victory they are back in the highest seat of power, and all we have is a humanized portrait of imelda and an intellectual discourse that we pass back and forth until it is worn and tired, while the rest of our people survive on scraps after the marcoses took everything they could",0

173,"this movie shows the hand that imelda played in the hands of philippine politics that it's not just her husband and her son who have a grasp on philippine politics that she had just as much to do with everything that happened as much as her husband and kids this movie got me to ask questions that i never really thought about cause in my eyes it no longer affects me cause it was so long ago but seeing the impact of what the past has done to today made me ask questions about what i want in a leader and what i stand for questions i think everyone should ask is this film a criticism on the marcos family, yes, but on a much deeper level than that, it shows a massive flaw with philippine politics, and how us, as the philippine people, can stand against oppression and corruption we may not always get it right, but i see this film as an important reminder on why we should fight, despite getting it wrong",-1

256,like everyone said the highlight of this documentary was the interviews with survivors of martial law and other filipinos overall i felt like the debrief after was a lot more agitating than the actual movie and thats all that matters going wtf and holding my head and venting with other filipinos was so healing,0
257,you can't help but become obsessed with her personality especially after doing your own bit of google research once you've watched the documentary,0
260,i had never heard of imelda and the marcoses prior to this documentary but the moment it opened with a scene of imelda riding around manila in what looks like a fancy mini bus sliding open the window and then proceeding to give out money to all the people gathered there told me everything i needed to know about her,0

284,"in a conversation with director lauren greenfield, she addressed this concern and makes the point that one of the reasons why imelda was so willing to sit down in front of a camera was because the person behind it was supposedly oblivious to her past the stories deserve more the people deserve more",0

287,horror,1
288,"i generally try to approach documentaries with some degree of neutrality in her introduction, she seems like a silly, unassuming old lady sitting in her gilded home and her many shoes, handing out pesos to street children with an air of supreme disinterest lauren greenfield paints a complex portrait, peeling back the layers to reveal a dangerous, intelligent and manipulative figure greenfield and her editor keep the film's pulse steady, combatting each of imelda's increasingly ridiculous lies with evidence to the contrary without feeling sequential i couldn't believe my ears when she said that martial law was the best time for human rights maybe that's because of my personal histories watching ferdinand marcos' body be interred at libingan ng mga bayani, where my grandfather is buried, left a pit in my stomach and knowing that i have relatives, including my mother, who remain vocal loyalists and direct victims of the disinformation and whitewashing campaigns that are at the center of this film was another gut punch the film was completed in 2019 and leaves off on leni robredo's victory over bbm in the vp election it seems that democracy prevailed, and presents like a cautionary tale of the marcoses of what can be done when political dynasties are left unchecked with power and influence but listening to bbm ramble about stolen elections a full four years before trump sent a chill down my spine the cult of personality the militarization of the police it's extra haunting to see this in 2024, knowing that my family's motherland is under the thumb of the marcoses again well made, prescient and powerful",0

305,for a documentary is very interesting and well made about a very controversial figure in international history a very interesting watch,0
307,"this film is a dangerous one because it's a known fact that us filipinos are a curious case of stockholm syndrome, and the more we let imelda open her mouth, the more lies she can spew out lies that helped her son win the presidency 2 years ago but when viewed in the context of now it's 2024 and the marcoses are back in malacanang, preserving the truth about our country's history is the least we can do",0

330,imelda marcos is the physical embodiment of delulu is the solulu,0
331,the amount of exposure this film gets to its subjects truly allows you to step foot in the room of the marcos family in a way that somehow not only showcases the reality for these human beings but also captures the corrupt and selfish pursuit of power with the destruction that their impact has left on the philippines,0
332,"well done documentation of the character of imelda selfish, vain, and narcissistic the documentary itself did a good job in displaying the electoral politics of the marcos era however the narrative was more on aquino v the controversy of the hacienda luisita massacre the cojuangco aquino plantation and corruption of noynoy and corey aquino was completely overlooked i wished they interviewed activists and political prisoners that are still active in the movement",0
333,"this movie is really well made, great cinematography and archival footage the movie shined when they interviewed the dissidents and revolutionaries, i wish it was more focused on them but this director is known for her obsession with rich people im off to find movies about the people power revolution",0
336,i watched this tv and was stunned by the power imelda marcos had she was a driving force behind her husbands regime in the philippines he ended up dying from an illness after he vacated power but she still maintained a presence on the political scene the amount of money she was able to take from the people and spend blows some minds it also follows her on the trail of getting her son involved in politics i didnt know too much about the philippines before this and it was very detailed,0

368,"there was music and there was beauty everywhere ... imelda marcos perfectly encapsulates the term avarice ... its evident that she has little to no regard for anything other than fame fortune this desire to rewrite and practically apotheosize her former husbands legacy the philippines kleptocrat in chief is further proof that shes an evil, calculated, and downright corrupt individual as many politicians are btw she longs for her glory days aka the days where she was carelessly stealing and spending billions from a developing country i do like how the people behind this made it a point to call out marcos for her bs like the fact she displaced an entire island to built some inbred zoo, the fact she hid her picasso and michaelangelo paintings from authorities, the fact martial law hurt the philippines more than it helped, and so on ... but still, part of me questions the validity of giving her such a major platform to begin with",0
369,"i haven't seen a lot of documentaries about the philippines but a story about the marcos family and their current political position is a deeply fascinating one i've spent a lot of my life, in some ways, disconnecting from my filipino past to fit in better but as i get older, i realize how important it is to try to fit both parts of who i am seeing the history, hearing from the people hurt during the marcos regime, seeing how they've managed to keep their ill begotten wealth and make a come back to politics is an important story for every human on earth we have too short of memories money, power, and corruption are the closest thing we'll have to time travel as they're used to rewrite history",0
370,this bitch is crazy okok a less simplistic review quite an insightful look into the backdrop of filipino politics and how fucked up it all is very cool that the documentary uses imelda as an anchor to tell the story of the larger trends of corruption in the filipino political landscape focusing on imelda is a good lens for this because of how extremely out of touch and outlandish her ideas so it adds a shock factor eg anna recommended me this a whiiile ago but i finally borrowed the dvd from the library now,0

375,does a great job of making you think its going to be all about fabulous shoes and butterfly sleeves before revealing that its actually a chilling portrait of a dictators political dynasty at work,0
377,what a beast,1
378,idk why she's still alive,0
379,"to an assistant in a hospital room full of potentially terminally ill children give me some money to give away maybe not the best day for me to watch this, but it's one of the last showtime docs i had queued up before the app goes kaput the film was captivating, concerning, and strange, but it's also more curious to watch in 2023, after the marcos family resumed control of the filipino government last year via son bongbong, who appears here so much feels telegraphed in hindsight when they get to talking about bongbong and his then vice president campaign i have no idea if this film gained exposure over there or not, and it looks like the marcoses had traction there regardless, but i can't help but wonder if putting this lady and her family back in the limelight didn't help gain some eyes, in spite of the film's potential intent i know it's a different political sphere and culture though, naturally the us is linked to all of this , but i feel the same way about the exposure of eccentrics like tr mp, who never would have made it into office if the media didn't constantly stick a camera on them wondering what kooky thing will they say next but here we are a year away from doing it all over again so much of this film feels scarily too familiar, seeing the history being rewritten in real time, and as such, it very much feels too late",0
380,"surreal, makes me want to rewatch evolution of a filipino family",0
383,imelda marcos makes amazing documentary filmmaking,0
384,"imelda marcos continues to charm and astonish well into her eighties it's easy to see how she wielded so much power during her husband's dictatorship her story, so important to the modern political reality in the philippines, was so carefully told to cover both the past and the present and how intricately wound they are brilliant to interweave the horrors of martial law in the 1970s with the rise of bongbong who really comes across as a doltish, boyish, puppet version of his dad and duterte the philippines has suffered from such rampant corruption with essentially only the aquinos offering a brief respite during the presidencies of cory and noynoy the latter of which is featured in this documentary and is quite an eloquent dude seeing the marcoses claw their way back to power by financing duterte's campaign and now, of course, with bongbong as president, i am very troubled for the future of this much abused, but beautiful and resilient country",0
385,"binibigyang perspektibo ng dokumentaryo si imelda marcos bilang isang ina a mother to her nation, the first family, and the world kasi nababahiran ng vulnerability at humanity ang pamilyang marcos, yung parehong pamilyang nanudla, nagnakaw, at nagpahirap sa pilipinas noong diktaturya ni marcos sr at patuloy na nagpapahirap sa bansa ngayon sa termino ni marcos jr nahuhumanize yung elitist tendencies ni imelda, najujustify yung paglabag ni marcos sr sa mga karapatang pantao noong batas militar, at nacocontextualize yung pagkaganid nila sa kapangyarihan, which, if not viewed critically, ay napakadelikado dahil nakapanlilinlang",0

387,watching imelda marcos sit in front of the camera trying to justify her and her husbands actions towards the filipino people and economy is like watching a train wreck because you cant look away no matter how much worse it gets,0
389,this lady is so fascinating and so evil...lowkey a bad doc tho,0
391,"i genuinely really love this documentary, not because i adore the marcos family or imelda marcos but because it showed the different sides of the stories, i really liked the different point of views on different events that occurred under the marcos rule like when imelda splurged on animals from africa and brought them to the philippines saying that she wanted the philippines to be a paradise like the garden of eden they legit have a painting of ferdinand marcos...",0

393,"as a social studies teacher, i help students sharpen their critical thinking skills by presenting them facts and figures to guide them in forming their own conclusions i don't infiltrate to them my own viewpoints, for it may influence their own views i want my students to form their own opinions and make sure that they are based on facts and empirical evidence this is exactly how lauren greenfield's the kingmaker presented one of history's most divisive topic it is a documentary where you see the camera roll and witness the actions speak for themselves the main subjects themselves, the marcos family mostly imelda marcos are the ones narrating the entire story the camera is basically a fly on the wall real footages and records from the exact events are also shown i've also read that the intended direction of the film depends on how interviews went this means the film does not intentionally gear towards one side of the story only, as both the marcoses side, the victims, and the witnesses were evenly presented the result a compelling story of a true event that almost feels like fiction due to its shocking and unbelievable accounts it makes you wonder why the marcoses agree to be the subject of this documentary and how they feel about this this educational documentary might be a hard watch for some, and i highly advice that the best way to watch this is to have an open mind, without any pre conceived notions about what the show is about now available on vimeo for free with a runtime of 1 hr 40 minutes synopsis this critics' choice usa and warsaw international film festival poland awardee examines the controversial history of filipino politician imelda marcos and her family that gave birth to one of the darkest impositions of martial law in the modern world history",0

426,incredible techniques that expose the marcos family,0
427,"was ultimately a more satisfying documentary at capturing not just the delusion of imeldas reframing of the martial law years of the marcos philippine dictatorship, but the horror of the rise of her children in modern government benefited from my having just seen imelda 2003 and its extensive interview footage giving such clear insight into her mindset in 2003, the further spiral into delusion is even more striking checking back in circa the 2016 election cycle with her renewed confidence seeing her children dominate political discussion juxtaposed with the widening gap between the the rich and poor of the philippines the contrast provided by footage from the creation and fall of imeldas calauit safari park island is especially fascinating",0
428,"it is very well made however i struggle to see the benefit of giving imelda marcos a platform to spout her shameless lies about her husband's totalitarian rule and juxtaposing it with the objective truth of history while somewhat giving off the impression that both outlooks are equal in their merit apparently some marcos apologists enjoyed this movie because of that still, i can sort of see the value of this work as an educational resource for the perspective of a foreigner wishing to know more about the history of this corrupt, kleptocratic family nonetheless, i commend the documentary's objective of educating foreigners about the dire situation here in the philippines where thieves are worshipped as idols and the corrupt elite manage to evade justice at every turn",0

443,"i understand why some people are morally opposed to imelda being documented like this however, i think it clearly shows how she and ferdinand were able to gain and keep control in the philippines before martial law and ward off opposition during it, besides just the killing which is very bad it also is important because clearly, people bought into her mirage again when bongbong was elected so if we can see her in a complete light like this, we can hopefully learn how to recognize players like imelda and avoid getting roped in ourselves",0

843,"a very well crafted documentary even when i was losing interest, lauren greenfield found a way to bring me back in",0

867,"these terrifying words come from the delusional imelda marcos, whose influence on politics in the philippines is scary her opulent lifestyle and desire to birth a paradise is slowly realised to come from a scary place as the kingmaker is mostly a conventional documentary, aside from its lack of chronology, it feels likely to become a neoliberal piece of mild condemnation without the guts to pick apart filipino politics yet the kingmaker does find a voice, and manages to find fault in the more liberal governments in the philippines who knows if the kingmaker is telling this slice of history at its beginning or end there's horrifying moments in the kingmaker, such as the chilling accounts of torture, the children who openly like martial law, and the fact that rodrigo duterte has any power as a documentary this may not be very inspired, but the subject matter is vital for us all to know the inbreeding nature of politics has allowed one family to have influence, either overtly or covertly, over an entire country for decades perhaps imelda marcos does have a plan for paradise, but is the path to it justifiable 2019 ranked",0

869,"followed by a q a featuring director lauren greenfield imelda marcos isnt someone i was familiar with at all prior to this documentary but it didnt take much to see how she is a prime candidate for a film her personality is eye catching and confusing while also being headstrong and assertive the q a that took place following the screening helped improved my view of the film as some of the directors choices made more scene after hearing how they came to be one issue i had have is the level of focus early on on imeldas bring of animals to an island and running off its prior inhabitants while this is an interesting and quirky story, it is later followed up with the films first deep dive into the era of marshall law in the philippines brought on by her late husband ferdinand marcos this is far more interesting and far more important to the narrative than this island full of giraffes and i had issues with the time allotment of the two, as well as how much of the earlier portion of the doc feels far too casual given the level of information that is conveyed in the later half while still is problematic for me, it helped to hear that over the process of filming this movie, much of the later events werent even in play yet so at the time the film felt like it was going to be one thing before new storylines emerged it doesnt completely remove my issues about it but it make more sense and for me makes it more understandable a choice it is a documentary worthy of keeping an eye out for as i think much of it will be a welcomed source of information for most about the political issues in the philippines and how people like imelda can be so influential to even if from a distance she looks like a comical character of sorts",0
870,to a person who only knows the history of the marcos dynasty from the wikipedia article this was appropriately terrifying and illuminating it feels tacked on but i'm not sure that there was any other way to convey the insane turn the story was taking,0
872,"the explosive story of imelda marcos, and her rise from being miss manila in phillipines to becoming the first lady there inspite of years or corruption, political manipulation, murders, and even after being sent to exile out of the country she still managed to come back, and remains relevant because of her political tact and emotional manipulation of the people of phillipines",0
873,"lauren greenfield the queen of versailles, generation wealth has once again proven why she's my favorite documentary filmmaker, and one of my favorite filmmakers, period she explores new territory in the kingmaker, without straying away from her signature photographic and intimate style the dna of her style is felt and serves as a backbone to new elements that elevate it to another level in order to successfully cover the story of imelda marcos and politics in the philippines everything i admire about her body of work is present on this one metaphors of excess and unbalance and its consequences glamour and its beauty, but also how comical it can be the obsession with material things and its demons however, due to the nature of the subject, it goes a step further, diving into political territory and giving us a cautionary tale about power and greed that is harsh, timely, but hopeful this project might not have been the culmination of 25 years of work like generation wealth, but it's probably the most challenging one greenfield has had to make the challenges of this five year endeavor are seen and felt on the screen, but they pay off if greenfield and her team were able to accomplish this, then i cannot wait to see what's next in store i highly recommend this documentary a portrait of a woman in and out of power of a country in and out of justice of a political system in and out of the past if you're in la or new york, make sure you catch it in theaters starting november 8th",0

882,this is just that john mulaney bit about how donald trump is a poor person's idea of what a rich person is like but absolutely terrifying,0

926,"classic greenfield imelda marcos is given free rein to exhibit her own folly and delusion, while interspersed archival footage and other interviews show the true story of the marcos regime in the philippines while generally a troubling and depressing story, the kingmaker has its lighter moments and dark comedy, a tonal mix that greenfield manages beautifully the ending hints at the possibility that rodrigo duterte's election as president may have been part of some larger plot to return a scion of the marcos family to power while interesting, i'm not sure this theory is fleshed out enough to merit inclusion",0
927,"lauren greenfield has made films about people with immense wealth before, and both those and her books tend to cover that uncomfortable collision of aspirational wealth and real lived experiences, about little corners of the human psyche or rather bigger ones in some cases that desire the glossy fashion spread lifestyle imelda marcos largely fits neatly into that, but with a far bigger and more dangerous political footprint that continues to make itself felt ostensibly the title is about her relationship with her husband, the massively corrupt dictator of the philippines for two decades from the mid 60s to the mid 80s at which point he was ousted by a 'people power' revolution via the wife of an assassinated opposition leader, corazon aquino , whose power she was said to manipulate for her own ends, most famously for the acquisition of art, designer items and of course shoes but the film moves quickly on from these trappings to her real and lingering effect on filipino politics, via her family's dynasty and their support for current dictator wannabe rodrigo duterte stylistically it frames marcos with the opulence of her living spaces, repeatedly showing her handing out money to her loyal supporters crowding around her car or in public appearances often held and distributed by her staff she shows off art and photos of her with world leaders at one point hilariously, but utterly unconcernedly, breaking some of these framed highlights while reaching to show off one, i think with her and nixon she is also apparently blithely unaware of how her namedropping comes across, especially when she's talking about aforementioned world leaders or her art collection she could be a figure of fun, but gradually the film becomes more and more serious about her impact, as it layers on the marcos's crimes and the real effects of the policies and division they have sowed within the society, paving the way for her and her family's chilling return to power",0
928,"to quote the film hustlets from this earlier this year, motherhood is a mental illness and imelda and the whole marcos family are the cause of the various illnesses that run plague in my home country being a filipino who lives abroad is a blessing as i am away from the violence and disasters back home, but a curse because i cannot be more than an observer i've been apathetic to injustice due to my privilege i am grateful for the life i have and what has been provided for me but it is that privilege that has made me not care the kingmaker has awakened a deep anger inside me regarding what has been done to my country i emplore all filipinos who have access to it, to see it even if you disagree with it i guarantee all filipinos can take something from watching it i can only hope that the marcos' never return to malacanang",0
929,"i'm pleased to report that this is a far superior and less odiously self indulgent that greenfield's generation wealth the kingmaker starts from a position of curiosity and sympathy there's something of the fog of war in jocelyn pook's philip glassy score imelda marcos as ridiculous but tragic, and maybe misunderstood ultimately a film that speaks to a variety of worrying political trends across the world, and how perception trumps truth at all turns",0
930,"really brilliantly constructed the film sets up as a cosy, cute, harmless portrait of an eccentric celebrity in her grey years, and allows itself to remain in that framework as the body count grows higher, as kissinger dances on the screen, as the talking heads, initially brought in to provide sappy reminiscing about imelda's public life, begin to admit propping up dictators for the us' foreign policy interests or detail their sexual assault at the hands of the marcos regime, as the gormless jeb bush like son goes from affable mummy's boy to a brutal example of the violence of capital exerting itself, and of course as it ends with the still unfolding nightmare of duterte the usefulness of this for the film is that it provides an aesthetic critique of the influence of capital on society by relating everything back to marcos, in that we see that all its awful violence, its total control over humanity, its manufacturing of poverty and suffering, don't serve some sort of greater noble cause, but instead simply exist so that an elite can buy shoes and completely bizarre confirmations of their self image it's useful sometimes to remember how utterly ugly it all is, and how power has no correlation to either intelligence or beauty, it just exerts itself in service of itself i'd never immediately disbelieve someone who told me the rich devote their whole lives to worshipping molloch and doing satanic rituals, because there's no need for these things to be real for the idiotic rich to exploit the world in practicing them, as marcos' obsessive world mother fantasy and surreal safari island show the woozy, nightmarish quality of the film's descent into horror doesn't distract from the reality, and it's a serious documentary that isn't reductive to just pointing at the absurdity of the rich instead, it uses these contrasts to make the total dominion of capital in public life and its attendant brutality that protects and asserts the power of the dominant elite all the more vivid, and shows how apparently laughable figures like duterte can exist as the sinew between capitalism and fascism, artificially creating a need and then fulfilling it with a solution that has no alternative or, a failed neoliberal alternative , like marcos literally buying the affection of the poor she helped impoverish it's that clear critique of capital as a structure and empathy for the oppressed throughout that keeps it from being just liberal aesthetic critique, although mockery of the venal rich still has its place don't let unfunny us talk show hosts take it away from you completely",0
931,"likable enough and entertaining but lacks the unique personal style of greenfield's previous work in a way, marcos is the ultimate greenfield subject and you kinda wish, it wasn't so focused with a yeoman like investigation on present day filipino political corruption and human rights crimes sure, marcos is a focal point in filipino politics but we spend a lot of time away from imelda, to focus on the other stuff",0
933,"after thursday's election results, i have come to the conclusion",-1
934,greenfield tells this story with almost a degree of flippancy at the beginning as the audience is invited to laugh at imelda marcos and her inflated ego and mock her for her crocodile tears for the victimhood she claims but greenfield hasn't done pulling the rug from under the audience's feet with a final horrible sting in the tail that really explains the film's title it turns out this is no laughing matter after all the bad guys are winning again,0
935,a stunning documentary not only does lauren greenfield have unprecedented access but the oblivious way in which imelda marcos talks is staggering a fascinating look inside a dictatorship from the inside a must see,0
937,"this felt like a lefty alex jones extended video to me, a long polemic about duterte they trotted out all 5 people still alive who remember the marcos dictatorship from the 70s 80s to trash imelda, only to tie her family to duterte",-1
938,"as with many documentaries we play at e street, i had no idea who the marcos family were i was instantly fascinated and was kind of into imelda's good nature and giving to the poor but then the documentary starts to unpack what her and her husband really did to the philippians it's directed by the same director of the queen of versailles and generation wealth and although i have been meaning to catch up on those, this fits perfectly in a trilogy about wealth and class it's really well put together and informative for those like me who don't know about this and the current state of the philippians politics and how this type of dynasty is being rooted into our politics today with jr having aspirations to run for mayor or governor of new york it's a really fantastic documentary and among the best of the year also my 100th landmark e street new release of 2019 only 2 left for my year challenge",0
939,"sly documentary follows an elderly imelda marcos as she works to install her feckless son with ferdinand marcos, bongbong, as vice president of the philippines imelda likes to lie just about as much as donald trump, and she likes power just about as much too director greenfield just stays quietly out of the way and lets the facts and imelda prosecute their own case one interesting line of thought suggests that the country's current murderous dictator, rodrigo duterte, is a marcos stooge installed to grease bongbong's path, who will step aside when it's time for bongbong to take power it's all jaw dropping, and provides a convenient road map to how dictators establish authoritarian rule we should be paying close attention",0
940,the story of imelda marcos is bigger than the doc,0
941,"portrait of a delusional yet absolutely terrifying persona, a comic book villain under whose absurdity lies the sinister potential to realise these delusions through the self justifying mythos of a national narrative wish this explored the tumultuous years under marcos martial law at a deeper socio economic level, and also the countrys political landscape during and post marcos make no mistake, the real star of the show is imelda, a seemingly impossible amalgamation of naivete and shrewdness, delusion and self awareness",0

950,"at least that's the hope however, a large population of the philippine still worship the marcos family and this is shown with how bongbong recieved a large percentage of votes when he ran for vp and how the marcoses are still engaged in politics would have loved for the director to have put a more critical eye on philippine politics i mean, the noynoy aquino was interviewed in this documentary and his family's hands aren't clean either google hacienda luisita and mendiola massacre",0
951,"it seems like most people watch movies to escape their every day reality so for the last few years for me, and i assume many others, it's been the current political climate in the u so what better way to escape this than a documentary about a different country's political history and current climate i was excited to see this based on the subject being former first lady of the philippines imelda marcos, but once i saw it was directed...",0
952,"saw this on a whim because long day's journey into night was sold out and now thinking about inbred giraffes, how horrible everything is, and imelda marcos giving birth to things",0
953,"i was left like an 80s cartoon with their mouth touching the ground and the eyes popping and it was for a foxy lady of a different kind very interesting political documentary in form having not much previous knowledge of the marcoses i entered the film experiencing the journey of illusion and dissolution as directed power is scary and money can buy you everything, even your name back",0
954,"fascinating subject matter keeps the film engaging and there is an admirable wealth of materials put together definitely an interesting watch if you know little about filipino politics it starts as a portrait of imelda marcos, turns into a broader study of recent filipino history, then becomes a film about the 2016 vice presidential election each could be a great film on its own, but thats too much for just 100 minutes it is interesting, but somewhat superficial for this reason reading imelda marcos wikipedia page or just checking who won the election if you dont already know could cover most of the same ground this is decent as a primer, but i now want to read watch much more about imelda marcos",0
956,"the kingmaker key takeaways imelda marcos, biggest clout chaser talo pa ko sandro marcos, the shadiest he shaded two presidents in his ballot the marcoses, delusional thieves filipino people are grateful and forgiving, pero i hope we never forget i sat at the back and nakakakilabot panoorin yung mga ulo ng mga tao na nanunuod attentively sa isang docu na basically telling us not to repeat what happened during the marcos regime and its from an american filmmaker, and that speaks a lot for itself knowing our government na mahilig mag sanitize ng anything na nagcicriticize sa kanila",0

963,never forget,-1
964,"furstrating in parts but important nevertheless noynoy aquino quotes santayana about how those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it, ironic considering how his administration's neoliberal policies contributed to the conditions that helped put another despot as depraved as marcos into power the marcoses are depicted as deluded oafs buoyed by the current of their unearned wealth, creating optics that somewhat distance the family from the atrocities they're responsible for, especially for those who are only learning about imelda through this film in one short scene, public school students casually repeat misinformation about martial law, mirrored in a sequence where imelda makes the same claims to the period's secure and prosperous nature, set against archival images and footage of arrests and accounts of torture at the hands of police employed by the marcoses viewed at the philippine premier in up cine adarna",0
965,"its one thing to watch this really well done documentary, but another thing to watch it in a theatre full of patriotic and passionate filipino students everyone should go see this",0
966,"great movie i learned so much, and kudos to the people behind this for creating this the only thing i have against it is that it kinda comes off as marcos vs aquinos at times",-1
967,"the cynical part of me thinks that, yes, films like this are great projects, but will they really matter much in the end but then, theres also that hopeful part of me that is stubborn even in exhaustion and wants to embrace every small win, every fighting chance the truth gets for that, im grateful for the kingmaker thank you to the crew for telling this story my fingers are crossed that this documentary gets a wide release, that it gets uploaded to a streaming service so more can have access to it, or that it becomes required viewing in schools the nation needs it i hope we keep repeating it until everyone believes it to be true",0
968,"i think the most important thing that the kingmaker did was to directly connect the marcoses to duterte the money, the power, the influence, the strategy, the long con in a way that is easy for people to follow and understand the main takeaway is proper education even i dont remember being taught about the horrors of martial law in elementary and high school i remember only memorizing that marcos was the president that stayed the longest in power if not for university, i probably would be as clueless as these kids in the movie, especially with how active the marcoses are paying people to revise history to their advantage which as we saw, our unreliable narrator imelda marcos has obviously started to believe and claim as historical facts germany has its holocaust memorial, and even cambodia has the same for the polpot genocides it is a testament to greenfields dedication and craft that she was able to cover 50 years of philippine history and show it in a very comprehensive and compelling structure, and managed to connect what has happened in the 70s to what is happening today by following the thread of money and power",0
969,"imelda is crazy and this film does not fully depict the horrifying things that shes done still, the fact that this movie had the participation of imelda and bongbong is amazing i wonder what they were told that made them say yes to be interviewed",0
973,"beautifully shot imoalso, alam kong medyo shallow or hindi talaga niya napakita yung worst ng martial law pero maganda na siyang transition movie to enlighten or to make people jump ship sa pagiging marcos apologist nila hek",0
975,"ive been craving for a film about the scope of this familys power grabbing, from the ill gotten wealth down to the control of todays president the kingmaker gave me exactly that, plus a clear eyed and brutal condemnation of the lies its all so satisfying and maddening at the same time",0
977,"there are no new insights, but then this wasnt a movie made for the ph audience anyway but it feels so its anti marcos but i wish it went deeper into the atrocities of the regime watched the 3pm ccp screening and people clapped afterwards and chanted, so i guess this film does something",0
979,"i'm probably one of the very few people who can actually say i have been inside that room filled with documents it's actually a ballroom yes they have a ballroom that they converted into an archive of documents relating to anything marcos the ballroom is actually beside their tennis court yes, they have a tennis court lol away from the main mansion in the middle of metro manila such is the story of the philippines as told in this docu ferdinand marcos may have been ousted in 1986 but he's still with us because of his family and because of the debt that we are still paying now just si imelda can buy her 3000 pairs of shoes and building in manhattan it's great that the movie was able to relate marcos to duterte, but it could have gone deeper how marcos is related to the present situation meaning poverty now other than that, it's a a great docu and this must be seen by every filipino out there",0

983,"amidst a chaotic political landscape that vacillates between black mirror and situational comedy, the filmthough honestly not providing any new informationis rather a grim reminder that even the dumbest people you see on air are conscious political actors beware the bato, panelo, go and uson above all, beware the marcoses and dutertes",0
984,"it feels like an hour long episode of the office but in this one, shit is real imelda is blatantly rewriting history right in front of us",0
985,imelda marcos' delusions can be seen throughout the movie you will laugh at first then you realize that this is an evil woman and her doings for the marcos family to be in malacanang again is indeed not laughable at all,0

987,"lets not forget the time last year where she almost killed her loyalistas for food poisoning sjfkkdkd this old bitch a killer, robber, and manipulator pick a struggle",0
990,"lauren greenfield has always had this strange fascination with showing how wealth corrupts people and how excess magnifies eccentricity i went to an exhibit of hers sometime last year and found it interesting how so many of the portraits were of imelda marcos imagine my excitement, then, when i found out that the reason behind that was that greenfield was making a documentary about imelda finally, the wider world would know about the regime that tore our country into pieces the kingmaker is mostly successful at that, but it hardly treads new ground she is portrayed in the documentary like she is portrayed in other international cultural works that feature her eccentric, charismatic, having led a charmed life, having possessed 3000 shoes in the end you have to wonder if it's greenfield who's tricking imelda into making this doc, or it's imelda who's playing greenfield there is a 30 minute digression where we hardly see imelda, and instead focus on the 2016 vice presidential elections the family sees it as a chance to regain power and redeem their name, but their delusions of grandeur and desperation are only magnified and while bong bong marcos lost the elections, it is apparent that their power only grows stronger with the allegiance of rodrigo duterte it feels less cohesive as a documentary as a result, but at least we're seeing something new so is it good i feel it is is it enough while there was a heartbreaking series of interviews with martial law victims, it is only implied that imelda marcos has something to do with this the kingmaker is just another piece of cinema that perpetuates imelda marcos's legend never forget",0
991,interesting doc,1
992,"or is everything that comes out of her mouth just a well crafted narrative na pinaninindigan niya to restore their power a good introduction to the evil of the marcoses their thirst for wealth and power, their efforts at historical revisionism, the human rights abuses they committed espouses the marcos vs aquino narrative, daming screentime ng aquinos liberal party as if ninoy and cory were revolutionary martyrs, as if the two aquino presidents we had did not commit atrocious human rights violations as well",0
993,"at this point, i want to believe there is a hell for people like imelda",0
994,"i've never heard so much aghast tutting in my life as from the audience at this screening imelda marcos was the wife of ferdinand marcos, dictator of the philippines from 1965 to 1986, when she and her husband fled into exile but in the early 1990s her family returned to the philippines and in the 2010s began it's return to the frontline of politics, seeking office for her son bongbong this film, with a tone of mounting horror, relates their appallingly successful efforts to return to power, the facts as frequently jaw dropping as they are terrifying for 90 minutes we watch this despicable cartoon villain throw herself a pity party while others suffer the consequences of her vomit inducing luxury the ripest metaphor at the films centre is the safari park she and her husband built, evicting hundreds of families from their island home to make way for animals poached from africa the film doesn't quite sell this as a metaphor for the political inbreeding, but it remains an incisive example of the cruelty and selfishness these vile humans spread the initial catalogue of corruption, fraud, ignorance, exploitation and negligence gradually gives way to the insidious background whispers of genuine atrocities committed, before, in the final act, the curtain is fully drawn back and the extent and immediacy of the consequences of their unquenched thirst for power are lain bare and we finally grasp how urgent and real the threat these people pose democracy truly is it is the rising panic of witnessing the wave of populism and post truth over the last half a decade condensed down into 90 minutes it's a stunningly effective, if incomplete, account of our nightmare modern reality",0
995,"this documentary would've worked without her but the thing is if given the chance for myself, i would've let it all be and made the documentary all about her relishing in her nonsense from the cartoonish first shot of imelda giving bills to the frenzied poor, the kingmaker had a sense of a mockumentary in it that aims to highlight imelda's delusions but then it went somewhere and i realized the film is not trolling us, it is trolling the marcos matriarch herself and in some moments of brilliant comedy, it seems that even she is trolling herself it looks like i am watching the office 2005 , even though i never did see an episode of the office or a taika waititi political satire akin to what we do in the shadows 2014 , but tyrants instead of vampires, even though i never did see what we do in the shadows this is the marcoses we are talking about for crying out loud some cuts evoke absurd motifs that elicit restrained laughs relax, it did go into serious territory at least in a self deprecating mockumentary, you would have focus it is obviously against tyranny, of course but then again the documentary could've been appropriated and misread as a loving portrait of the old hag by some people i know at least we had the unapologetic lols however, as an informative piece that serves as an entry level lesson to our history, the kingmaker is highly successful it even shed light on lesser known controversies that imelda managed to get her hands on the calauit island conversion to an african safari and displacement of its indigenuos people it portrays the aquinos as eventual heroes to history, as if the cory aquino administration saw significant improvement in the country's atmosphere it works for students and foreigners, the latter of which is the real audience of the film but to people who already made up their minds, there's only so much that this film could do in a perfect world, the kingmaker would educate more people on the truth of our history and it would push loyalists to be more critical of their politics hell, in a perfect world, there would've been no need for the kingmaker but this isn''t a perfect world in all seriousness, films like these are noble efforts and should be made more often only people should be more critical of what they watch in lesser seriousness, let me end by cherishing this gem of a scene from the documentary there's a scene where imelda recounts how she hid diamonds in diapers to be taken with her as they try to leave malacanang due to the people power revolution diamonds in diapers,'' jokes imelda then an awkward pause as she hopes for some laughs in the audience it's brilliant comedy",0
996,"at first, i couldn't believe how the marcoses had such an inflated sense of self importance, but then i quickly snapped back into reality and realized, of course they have these delusions of grandeur i mean, they are the marcoses while it only really scratches the surface of all the crimes this family has committed, documentaries like this need to be shown all over the philippines, and even the world, so we neverforget",0

1008,"the kingmaker may have illustrated some agitating parallels between the marcos regime and the duterte administration, but much of the film's fascinating quality comes from its deconstruction of imelda marcos' delusional psyche",0
1009,"lauren greenfield's latest documentary about the philippines' ex first lady starts off as a darkly comic portrait of a delusional woman, but later turns into a disgusting tale of a loathsome monster's ambitions lies in , we get a more personal look into the life of former first lady imelda marcos, their family's rose to power with her husband, the late ferdinand marcos being seated as the country's president the documentary starts off a bit humorous, with imelda introducing herself and her life before the things she tells the camera are quite funny because it makes her look delusional her actions are mostly eye rolling we spend a lot of time watching her give children with banknotes it's full of spectacle, with archival footage of her hanging out with foreign leaders like ronald reagan, fidel castro, saddam hussein, and mao zedong but as soon as the interviews with martial law survivors enters the picture, you realize that she's an unreliable narrator the story she's been telling us was leaning towards a certain narrative aiming to cleanse our view towards her, the marcos family, and martial law in general imelda is obviously using melodrama to get the poor's sympathy a strategic story to support their return to power as she her children, bongbong imee, try to climb the ladder back to the government at one point, some kids were asked what they know about martial law their answers stupefied me, with all of them saying that it was a 'golden' era for the philippines george santayana was right those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it definitely a must watch for everyone, with its sharp and biting depiction of marcos' regime and its connection with today's fascist regime of duterte",0
1010,"it's uncomfortable and infuriating, knowing that this family who has blantantly abused this country and still do i find it an interesting direction choice to use imelda as an unreliable narrator and then juxtaposing that with archival footage and firsthand testimonies of people affected by the 1972 martial law, which diametrically opposes what the marcos family claims the access greenfield and her team had with the family is also worth noting because it's quite obvious that they're all putting a showall part of their scheme to revise history and put themselves back into power but we know better than that greenfield used that access to present something beyond the marcoses' show families and villagers displaced from their homes because the marcoses want their very own island zoo, thousands of victims of human rights abuses, even the people working for them that are treated like pawns instead of human beings but it's a pity they still tried to play it safe if you're going to give people like the mythmaker a platform, you need to be clear and firm in your stance instead of staying neutral it's very important to process the film after watching it people who saw this film should note that all of this isn't about the marcos aquino family feud or a fight between political parties philippine premiere upfi cine adarna",0

1020,"i saw the kingmaker in up film institute during the 34th edsa anniversary, so the milieu made it feel like the movie is preaching to the choir at this point, so i was kind of disappointed that there was little nuance with how it talks about the connections between our current issues and the marcoses what's funny, i think, is that in its attempt to show the marcoses' humanityor lack thereofit did not let enough voice from the masses to speak that's why my favorite parts were when it touched on the calauit safari, because it puts the two classes at odds with each other and how order both in nature and in humans was threatened because of it still, i think it's an important film especially for people who are learning about the family's atrocities for the first time it would not win the conversion of the diehards or the undecided, but it does solidify one fact and one battlecry neveragain to a marcos in power",0

1046,"the first half of the kingmaker is a well made, if slightly eccentric, standard biodoc lauren greenfield carries on her investigations into wealth but this is by far and away her most incisive film the way it moves from well paced to rapid is wrong footing but the questions she can't ask imelda marcos are answered by current politics",0

1055,i'm loving this new genre exposing capitalism soft grunge eat shit,-1
1057,"so basically imelda marcos is the eva peron of the philippines but more sinister and eccentric both eva and imelda, beautiful women who came from the poor and rose to power beside their dictator husband, are similarly fascinating people who wield such influence that they start to believe they were saviors or mothers of their people plus they have great musicals based on their lives the interesting thing about lauren greenfield's the kingmaker is how the tone of the film shifts midway the first half of the doc shines on the past, presenting us with imelda's many eccentricities and extravagant lifestyle that were so funny to learn about but it then shifts into serious politics of the present where we get to learn that imelda is still wielding power by helping to elect his son into the vice presidency it's greenfield's way of forboding how the country is doomed to repeat history",0
1059,"it's women's history month love her or hate her, imelda marcos is definitely a woman who made history in short time i'm going to work my way backwards through documentarian lauren greenfield's filmography, starting with her most recent film, the kingmaker, profiling imelda marcos, the former first lady of the philippines notable for far more than just her epic shoe collection, marcos held the reigns of power behind the scenes during her family's time in office, and now has hopes to return to the presidential mansion greenfield's style in this film is to allow marcos to tell her own history and her own story at first we follow her in person as she is interviewed, talking about her family, upbringing, and rise to power in the mid 1960s for over two decades, her husband ferdinand ruled with her at his side, a political power broker and key agent in diplomacy, using her striking looks and infectious charm to be as close to other world leaders often conservative, often dictatorial as her husband ever was famously catching ferdinand cheating on her with tape recorder under the bed, which she used as blackmail to get what she wanted later, she grew in prestige and influence into the 80s as the family lived like extravagant royalty amidst a nation suffering in abject poverty it was the 1986 people power revolution and election of corazon aquino which forced them from office and exiled the family from ever ruling the philippines again of course, the marcos regime ruled with an iron fist in a military dictatorship, and gradually through the kingmaker the stories of others those affected by the imposition of martial law, the families evicted from their homes to the marcos family could build and renovate at will, the torture victims and political prisoners of innumerable amounts come to the fore, and the real truth is revealed about imelda that is, greenfield allows her to be an unreliable narrator, and brings in members of the aquino family and other opponents to counter her fabrications and exaggerations, like a form of fact checking along with her son bongbong who imelda wishes to see back in the presidential palace again and who probably likes parasite exactly twice as much as you do the two craft a fantastical tale of their birthright to rule, while everyone else fights against their corruption and misdeeds as the loving marcos clan cozies up to current sociopathic president duterte now in her late 80s, imelda appears unrepentant and even in denial of any of her family's actions she still maintains fabulous wealth that was shipped offshore and retained after exile, still flaunting it in the face of today's filipino people and using it to further bongbong's campaign in a bizarre state of denial about the years of horror her family brought to the philippines, imelda plays the victim and twists the facts to beg for sympathy unfortunately it has worked in some ways, stealing billions from the country while many filipinos suffered greenfield has explored themes of wealth, privilege, and bewildering ignorance of power and influence before, and the kingmaker does that effectively the doc plays with a linear timeline a little, and the shifting stories can make it difficult to follow if you don't already have knowledge of the era i imagine anyone not from the philippines and especially anyone under 30 might need more background information about this history to fully grasp the evil of the marcos regime and impact for decades more, as well as how it's profoundly affected the current duterte era this film though is an excellent start added to the best documentary films of 2019 added to lauren greenfield ranked",0
1061,might make another review of this soon you can check out my extensive take here bit ly 33gdbta but all i have to say for now is,1

1069,love how raw this documentary is i am in full support of imeldas right to shut the fuck up,0
1070,"it's so incredible to see my country's pocket of local history told on a global platform that it's by the deft hand of lauren greenfield, who seems to specialize in delusional rich folk, is just the cherry on top come see the southeast asian evita in all her garish opulence and stolen splendor it's quite a sight this makes an excellent double feature with another documentary released in 2019, the edge of democracy",0
1071,"the tone of this documentary is exquisite it is bold, sharp, and raw the right ingredients in fair fully exposing the marcoses marcos and marcoses, stop your delusions on presidency return what you stole from the filipinos and stop trying to steal the future of this country the filipino people need and deserve leaders who are genuine and has no hidden agenda to my countrymen, open your eyes widen your horizon you should die, slowly and painfully",0

1074,"essential film viewing for every filipino an updated version of ramona diazs imelda i believe imelda is the better film of the two, but the kingmakers appeal lies on the fact that it covers more recent histories that amplifies the sinister nature of its subject matter",0
1076,"great job to the filmmaker, she got the duality of imelda and the marcos regime",0
1077,"what a chilling, moving portrait of a power hungry woman i remember crying at around the end of the movie when the latter half transitioned to the repercussions of the marcos regime at present my eyes started to water at the descriptions of torture during martial law, was crying during the scene of the children talking about the revised version of history of the marcos era, and was full on sobbing during the highlighting of the ejks under duterte it brought me back to the beginnings of my activist lifethe pain and the anger that our country experienced i hope this never gets forgotten i hope that the latter half of the portrait is the one we remember the marcoses by i hope that we will continue to look at them as the power hungry, dynastic despots they are that continue to manipulate the filipino people to shape their world into their distorted version of beauty it's a chilling documentary, and i admire the effect it had during its screenings when the audience would lightning protest, say never again and marcos not a hero at the top of their lungs after the movie, that is hopeful i guess the white people who watched and were underwhelmed would never understand just how much it means to our nation being torn apart by this family and the other families who coalesce to their power",-1
1078,i don't have an answer for why we allow imelda to even open her mouth,0
1079,"i am not a polsci student nor have the credibility to speak up properly about politics and i don't know alot about this topic so i'm glad there is a proper documentary about this if u have the time to read it go ahead i'd like to start off by saying i absolutely love the camerawork here i love studying cinematography and hope to be a cinematographer someday and i must say that knowing this is a documentary, where the shots are more spontaneous and thinking of where to point the camera or keep what's in the frame is alot more crucial and i guess more thought is happening whilst operating it there were 3 parts that i loved the camera work so much imelda was at her garden flexing her framed photos and pics one up right in the middle she just fucking looked at it fall, brushed it off and continued speaking about whoever the fuck she was with while that was happening and this is where i talk abt camera work the cam zooooms out and shows one of her house help bending down to pick up the shattered pieces of her precious framed photos of her friends tangina nasugatan ba si kuya also with imelda's house help she was flexing this other hugeass picture frame of a newspaper clipping and she asked her househelp to hold it up she was hiding herself from the camera but had one eye peeping in between the crook of her elbow imelda was again flexing this part of her house with again extravagant paintings and sculptures, the camera was at a medium wide which already was showing enough of the venue but the cameraperson zoomed out slowly to reveal one of imelda's house help trying to inch their way out of the frame to hide but as he tried to inch himself out, the camera kept him in frame for the lack of a better term also wow just lauren greenfield ur mind i stan she beautifully crafted this docu to reveal the truth about the marcoses but not as an in ur face u suk type of way but in a way that really digs deep into ur psyche and just makes u feel the anger to ur core correct me if i'm wrong, but if u watch this documentary it can be interpreted in 2 main ways if you're a marcos supporter you'd watch this and see scenes you agree you'd agree with imelda when she'd say she's the matriarchal saviour of the philippines, you'd say martial law was a wonderful time for the ph but if you had common sense, or you know,,,, in the eyes of the well informed, we really know what this docu is about and i will absolutely hate them for it greenfield used inbreeding as a metaphor in a way that speaks to what they did in calauit island and the inbreeding of the marcoses inching their way back into politics is its own form of of parasitism",0
1080,great doc about a subject i knew little about fascinating though,1
1081,"imelda i want to mother the philippines john mulaney voice what kind of a cokehead relative in all seriousness, fuck the marcoses and all their cronies",0
1082,"imelda says the craziest things and if you had no clue as to what the philippines went through during her husband's regime, she sounds so believable to the untrained ear she truly believes in her bs she's insanely brillant evil, but brillant it all seems so surreal, but it's really happening and in my country too",0
1083,"essential imelda quotes that every filipino needs to hear then marcos answered, if that's the case, right now i quit politics when i heard that, and i knew he wanted to be president so that he could maximize his wealth and talent, then i said to myself, shame on you, imelda here is the one man who's going to give up everything for you i was only eight years old when i became orphaned if i'm going to the slum areas, i have to dress up and make myself more beautiful, because the poor always looks for a star in the dark of the night martial law, that was the best years of marcos because that was when he was ale to give the philippines sovereignty, freedom, justice, human rights i gave birth to what i dreamt of, and i always got my way now is the important thing, and so the past is past and finally,you're facing the mightiest sword of justice of the world, and you're alone, widowed, and homeless and countryless and penniless the jail would have been a welcome thing it would be free board and lodging never forget",-1
1085,sandamakmak ng tigas talaga tong pagmumuka ng mga marcos na to,0
1086,"in the battle for perception, the marcoses have been steadily gaining ground with just one monet painting, they can fund an army of historical revisionists and fake news peddlers to get back into power they did so in 2016 or probably even earlier , and are still doing it now more than just a delusional old lady who fashioned herself as the mother of a hopeless nation , imelda is a power hungry criminal favorite scene sandro marcos betraying his family's not so secret mantra that there is money in politics",0
1088,"i really wish everyone could watch this, stand firm and take collective action to ensure that the events of our dark past do not happen again correction, it's currently happening in duterte's regime in the words of dylan thomas, we must rage against the dying of light i know it won't be easy since the filipino masses are cluelessand it's not their fault this was shown in the film plus, it's so easy for them to control the poor even so, tireless persuasion pa rin",0
1089,me while watching i wonder if imelda ever touches 500 peso bills or is she petty cos of the aquinos,0
1090,"maganda ang pelikulang ito pero delusyonal si imelda one thing this documentary is doing right, is that our family will be sure to never vote for a marcos",0
1091,passes the six laugh in disbelief test,-1
1092,"haunting and just breathtaking, most especially with what marcos family can still do today",0
1093,it was when i entered college that i met and heard a victim's story about what her family faced during martial law it was enough to change my mind hearing imelda preaching about mothering a country just made me sick every filipino should watch this film,0
1094,good absorbing bio doc,1
1097,nothing has really changed,-1
1098,with what brain cell did the marcoses think participating in a documentary would be beneficial for them,0
1099,"so as someone who is a filipino fully knowing and aware of context of the marcos regime as well the current situation in the philippines, this was nothing new that being said, it did reinforce even more how how the marcoses and imelda in particular incredibly detached and self absorbed to the point that they see no faults in themselves and their motivations and actions the film does a good job of building up imelda as someone who at first seems okay only to later destroy her later on, particularly the sequences wherein imelda would say one thing then would immediately be contradicted afterwards it might be an effective way of getting the message across for someone who may be unaware of ph politics to not be sympathetic for them and in the end, they are really the audience of this documentary it scratches the surface with regards to the history of that time and circumstances of the now, and that's okay if it was intended to be that way",0
1100,"you need to fly first class this documentary hits too close to home for me because i grew up in the philippines and my mom lived through the marcos dictatorship also, knowing what actual martial law entails makes me think how stupid you are if you think the stay at home orders in your state is comparable to martial law it really isn't u stupid bufoon",0

1105,"it is scary times that we are living in, in the philippines right now we could feel every action of the duterte regime is aimed for taking absolute control, without regard to the filipino people, them and their cronies, a large part of which is the marcos double that with their dumbfounding popularity to the masses despite everything i love the comparison of inbreeding to political dynasties",0
1106,"watching this as my non marcos supporter father says noong panahon ni marcos, kahit kurakot siya, mabilis ang aksyon ng gobyerno sa mga krisis during marcos regime, even though hes corrupt, the governments aid to crises was fast so uh, im typing this as i pack my things up to leave this family",0
1107,"been waiting to activate my showtime trial for this, and it was definitely worth it especially timely now given that my aunt recently told me her experience under marcos' martial law made coronavirus shelter in place preparation feel second nature while it's definitely not a feel good movie, there's something awful and amazing about watching imelda spin a distorting web around history greenfield doesn't confront her directly, but then again i don't know how she could instead we get the other view of things through interviews, which might get at the truth, but don't let us see the delusional masterful reinterpretation of the past that imelda employs, which is the real star of the show in fact, the central question here might be which side of the fine line she is on is she consciously evil, or does she truly believe the things she is saying",0

1112,"the outrageous behavior it is all here while i applaud the filmmakers for having the balls to create this documentary at a time of political turmoil in the world, it's also quite ironic how this could end up as a platform for the marcoses to promote themselves i could only wish this were a bit more straightforward in it's framing and in turn, condemning imelda for what she has done this could have gone even deeper in more aspects that are not already common knowledge, but alas, a run time of an hour and forty minutes could never be enough",0

1127,i don't know how to rate this because i was confused ang angry the whole time but the filmmakers have done an excellent job in telling this controversial history so i'm just gonna give it 5 stars for the filmmakers,-1
1128,"very interesting and entertaining documentary on imelda marcos, the former first lady of the philippines who lived in a lavish lifestyle by plundering her nations wealthy, the kingmaker is an in depth feature that chronicles her legacy i found the film to be very good and shows that marcos was quite deceptive and dishonest it's quite an interesting film to watch and the way things are presented on screen makes the viewer form his or hers own opinion on marcos the film is quite fascinating in what it does, yet i think more things could have been added to the film too it's quite in depth, but the film could have been a bit longer too regardless the documentary covers enough ground to be a very thorough feature on its subject, and it is a very entertaining movie the kingmaker is entertaining from start to finish and the film features very good archival footage as well as interviews with imelda marcos and those who know her we get both sides of the story and it is a well constructed genre film the kingmaker is worth watching and if you are interested in the subject, you'll find everything that you want out of this film for what it is it is a good, well made documentary movie that is a very entertaining effort that focuses on a very controversial figure and although not a classic documentary, it manages to be worth watching because imelda marcos is quite a polarizing figure",0
1129,"really cant stand how ironic imelda tries to defend her family and saying they never stolen anything with thousands of cases against her and her family this documentary was beautifully made done on the transition of events having imelda interviewed about a certain topic, then jumps to someone whos...",0

1132,"rodriguez,2019",0
1133,felt empathetic yet distraught towards the marcoses knowing theyre still ascending from their posts,0
1134,"they found no skeletons only beautiful shoes is just one of the many striking and unbelievable lines that came from former philippine first lady imelda marcos in laura greenfield's documentary the kingmaker the line exhibits the nonagenarian's lavish perspective despite living in a third world country that suffered from the regime of her late husband and dictator ferdinand marcos greenfield's documentary shows how imeldific ostentatiously extravagant the mindset of imelda despite the numerous human rights violations and embezzlement that happened during the marcos regime after all of her controversial past, it is beyond belief how imelda is firm to declare that the philippines was in its glory during martial lawgreenfield portrays imelda as someone who has a savior complex imelda believes that being the first lady means being a mother to everyone so she wants nothing but the best for filipinos she visits the streets while aboard her car and gives out money to children she goes to the hospital and distributes huge bucks like its just coins to her but being a mother is beyond giving money for imelda she wants to convert the country into a paradise that will be looked up by other countries the kingmaker gives light to the usually undiscussed calauit safari park in palawan imelda was in awe of africa's beautiful safaris so she bought giraffes, zebras, monkeys, and more african animals and placed them on a small island the film shows imelda's inhumane mind when some residents of calauit island detailed how the military evicted them in favor of the animals that are not even natives in the southeast asian country it's an antithesis to imelda's own perception of being a mother to everything in the philippines, showing that she's only obsessed with the aesthetic surfaceimelda has also risen to a new societal power when she was shown leading infrastructure projects and buying expensive new york buildings at some point, it was also suggested that imelda was the one running the country as her husband is falling ill the kingmaker shows imelda as not just a first lady or the mother of filipinos she is also a puppeteer who can control everyone with the strings made out of php 1,000 bills greenfield was able to show imelda as an out of touch personality who still believes that her family has the solution to everything however, one has got to ask if greenfield wants to convince pro marcos and moderates to pick the other side in fact, they may have encountered the 2003 documentary about imelda but they are still firm on what they believe is right moreover, getting marcos' opponents such as vice president leni robredo and former president noynoy aquino son of slain senator and fierce marcos critic benigno sr hence, the discourse between the pro and anti marcos will be just filled with tiring justifications of the authorities' actions so, the question now is which perception is greenfield trying to appeal maybe except for the calauit safari the director could have focused her story on that island and meticulously unravel the fate of the residents and the animals there caused by imelda's shallow vision of a perfect and paradise like society",0
1135,maybe its only flaw is letting imelda open her mouth,0
1136,"the greatest performance of imelda marcos deserves an award for being the most conniving, manipulative, and self centered human or is she even considered one in her old age she's still convinced that she gave birth to the greatest era of the philippines bong bong looks like a pet more than a son you can see how he always seeks for his mother's approval imee just looks like the cheap dolls you get at divi purely plastic she even got her mother's big hair director lauren greenfield's documentary not only shows the two sides of politics in the philippines, but also explains how perception is not that easy to deceive from watching this film, i kept asking questions like how do the people not see it honestly, annalise keating should take a lecture from her you will see how quick and strategic the mind of the former first lady is which made things always go her way we often attach ourselves to our beliefs and create layers of lies in order to protect them there were a few significant events that were missed from the film however, from what was shown i think it was enough to make you understand and even empathize on behalf of the victims i hope that more people get a chance to watch and educate themselves of how power should not be in the hands of heartless people book recommendation the conjugal dictatorship of ferdinand and imelda marcos by primitivo mijares",0
1137,"i love everything lauren greenfield does, and this was no exception her photography is stunning as always",0
1138,"it's fascinating and i love lauren greenfield this is well, it's objectively empathetic toward imelda marcos in that it just shows her for who she is and unsurprisingly, she's an ambitious, power hungry person with delusions she's doing the right thing this documentary is not trying to make you like her, but just understand her i really went into this thinking i was maybe going to end up liking her or at least having some sympathy for her, like she was just misunderstood but as the political situation in the philippines changed, i think greenfield wasn't really equipped to keep up it became more of a news story rather than a people story and that's not her fault it's definitely worth watching, though, and the parts of it that work do work really well and the parts that don't work are still pretty good",0
1140,"during elementary school, the marcos regime is dubbed as the golden age of the philippines the usual narratives are the philippines was one of the richest countries in asia when marcos declared martial law, there was peace and order and that he ended poverty a lot of students are growing up thinking that he was the best president the philippines ever had even i, at one point, believed that fast forward to high school, the marcos dictatorship is once again discussed along with martial law there i learned that media companies are shut down to censor information, and that he imprisoned his political opponents however, accounts of torture and murder are not discussed as i grow older, i encounter more documentaries and articles proving that during his term was not the golden age of the philippines though it might be for his cronies now that information is more accessible with the help of the internet, more information regarding the crimes of the marcoses are revealed i remember watching a video on facebook wherein young people who grew up believing that marcos is the best president of the philippines are sat down with a victim of martial law after the young ones tell why they thought marcos was good president, the victims then narrate how they were tortured by marcos men however, the internet has also given a platform to marcos apologists to propagate the narrative that the marcos regime was best because of his infrastructure projects this documentary has let imelda tell her story without letting her control the narrative she was more than a lavish woman who indulges in shoes she was more than an accessory to her husband her image as the muse of manila has helped marcos ascend into power, and helped him in connecting with other world leaders until now, shes one of the reasons why her children even after all they have done to this country has been elected into government positions hoping that more people, especially filipinos, are given the chance to watch this",0

1147,"may rodriguez, activisti go for busalan na si imelda one of the things that struck me in this documentary is how the director has shone light on imelda's extensive influence on philippine politics i thought this would be about how she is painted as an extravagant, greedy, narcissist as is expected from a documentary about her , who is as accountable for all the crimes during the marcos regime as the dictator himself, but this goes way beyond that until now, decades after the fall of her husband's regime, her family still has philippine politics spinning within its fingers, pulling a few strings to accord things to their own political agendas the marcoses are not slowly making their way back to power they never lost it in the first place and it's only because we let them and for years, in a large part of the country, they've been winning it's time to hold them, their cronies and allies, and everyone like them, accountable",0

1154,"i was 10 or 11 years old in 1986 when the marcos family fled the philippines i knew nothing of martial law or potential human rights atrocities i got my news like everyone else from johnny carson imelda marcos' shoe collection provided a bevy of fodder for late night comedians of the era i'm surprised that no clips were inserted into this documentary i found this film to be fine, but a bit disappointing over all it was one i was very much looking forward to since it made the rounds at film festivals last year i never get to go to these festivals, but i try to look at the programming guide and make a schedule as if i was going i always tried to find room for this film in my make believe schedule luckily for me, this film was available as part of a free showtime weekend on sling, so my wait wasn't as long as it could have been i think that the film would have been better served by showing some present day imelda then going back to her marriage and really focus on the time of the marcos presidency dictatorship there is a lot of interesting information that is thrown up there to read instead of using time to show it on film i want to know more about that despite the, in my opinion, lack of focus the film seems to present, it is compelling to hear the thoughts of imelda",0

1159,"the power and money can influence an individual in many ways the kingmaker shows different sides of the history in the philippines these big names impact the people's mind with their advocacies, the illusion of power has grown into them without realizing that it kills thousands of people who are fighting for their rights we should never forget the past and don't get fooled for promises action is what we need",0

1162,probably long after she has died,0
1163,"the filipinos are very forgiving people sometimes i think we kinda deserve this, for being apathetic about history were too consumed with resilience that it would make us prone to abuse and yeah, at the end of the day the were the most forgiving people for the likes of delusional imelda",0

1166,"that she really believes that what she's done and is still doing is the result of her mothering and grand plan to make the philippines a paradise for us when, in fact, we all know that what she wants is to make it a paradise for her, for her family, no matter what the cost may it be the lives of other people i am frustrated and disgusted but i want to keep hoping that the filipinos will stop being very forgiving people and see the marcoses and their accomplices for what they really are that they'll start looking for people who have feasible and progressive plans, not six month promises",0
1169,"while she was living her delusions of grandeur as a motherly monarch, her people, were living in poverty she was bathing in riches and fancy things while her own countrymen were bathing in blood and hunger",0

1173,"greenfield did what she had to do and accomplished it well reeling from everything and anxious about how everything set up in this film and recent events in this country sync so well and they are indeed, now more than ever, poised for another dictatorship very accessible length that i feel should be shown in all schools, because i definitely think there hasnt been enough recent history lessons back in high school for me the marcoses absolutely welcoming to be featured in a documentary, perhaps believing greenfield will side with their revisions, really shows just how deluded they actually are deluded, but extremely wealthy and powerful the more accurate description would be neoliberal governments though",0
1174,"a bit over scored but yea, fuck the marcoses",0
1176,"watching the marcos family sing ako ay pilipino makes me sick also cringe when she said, there are many things women can do sometimes it helps that you are not taken too seriously",0
1177,i was watching this last night just before dutertes latest monologue you can only imagine how that magnified my anger oust duterte now,-1
1180,"a documentary that shows as neutral as it can the power of the marcoses and most especially imelda marcos in this documentary that seems to be surreal happens to be very true the power of the marcoses and the struggle of the filipinos are seen as clear as day i recommend all filipinos to watch this documentary and see for yourself, what a delirious politician can do in order to gain power their back",0

1193,"traditional documentary format, but chilling content nonetheless its interesting to see the side of imelda for the first time and it haunts me how detached and deluded she truly is from reality and how she molded the rest of her family to hold the same mindset the philippines truly deserves better",0
1194,"honestly if you knew nothing about philippine politics or political history, you'd start off the movie thinking imelda is a nice generous grandmother figure to the philippines and maybe she is in her own sick demented fucked up way but the truth is her whole family can burn in hell 100 times over for everything theyve done in the past and everything haven't done to make amends for it in the present the director retweeted and faved my tweet to her so 10 10 would recommend also oustduterte",-1
1195,everyone's a crony these days,0
1197,"to someone unfamiliar with philippine history, its almost dreamlike how the documentary paints the aspirations of the marcoses only for you to later be woken up to the grim repercussions of its reality",0
1198,"when that clip of imelda and her family singing to ako ay pilipino came up, and i felt the sudden rush of anger",-1
1200,"yes, keep spilling some tea honey",0
1201,"its a cliffsnotes version of the last near decade in the philippines, and i do think this is the type of cultural artifact that filipino documentarians cannot really package and broadcast at the very least for now the docus biggest strength is the way it captures imeldas twisted way of thinking its very natural for her to downplay a lot of history, and to drive the narrative convincingly its the same power you see in archival footage of the conjugal dictatorship, and the same power that is insinuated as puppetry or at least sponsorship for the currently sitting duterte the nugget quote perception is real and the truth is not is the ironic essence of our time, delivered by the patron saint of filipino boomers herself its a reminder that what seems new and surprising in the valley of fake news, is just what is and what has always been to a certain breed of alligator it should be noted that the docu scopes out a lot of nuance, atrocities and products of her edifice complex in favor of an introductory contrast between the marcos era and their rise back to power today yes, it includes heart wrenching testimonies of essential martial law era dissenters, and their harrowing experiences are just the tip of the bloody iceberg but understandably, you cant package all nuance into a digestible document, and the target audience is composed of non filipinos but letting them know about the basic stuff is still pretty important but i think the most important thing they gloss over is the corruption and or callousness of what came after it is mentioned, but it couldve used a few more minutes and why a nostalgic rose colored filter has colored many of those who lived through the toppling of the marcoses theres a lot in the docu that many critics of the marcoses already put forward, and a lot that his staunch loyalists deny or recontextualize , and its unlikely to change local perceptions for those who live in the thick of the topic at hand, a different approach to the documentation of this era seems more fitting its hard to predict what the imeldific kingmakers strategy is going to be about, but it likely will be the opposite of beautiful",0
1203,"as a filipino, i'd say it lacked an depth direction that could clearly angle a side better, but i understood that this film was more for an international audience that could use a briefer on what the marcoses were like",0
1204,"still laughing about the sound of breaking glass in the background from the falling picture frames wish i could say the same thing about imelda's delusions though, which enraged me so much i started drinking again neveragain",-1
1208,"the kingmaker comes to awaken national consciousness on the marcoses distorted reality, corruption, and how imelda marcos gained the term imeldific the audacity of this egotistical old hag to call herself the mother of the nation and even the world please have a seat and tell that to your bulletproof bra marcos is not a hero never forget oust duterte you know the drill, end them by voting wisely",0
1209,the best thing about this film is that i'm 100 sure that imelda had no idea how greenfield was going to fuck her image over for her to say that perception is real and truth is not speaks volumes on how far she's willing to go despite her age to regain the prestige of being a marcos i'm already sick of duterte but i guess y'all really had to put him there given recent events i was hoping the film would only be on imelda's delusional self because that was entertaining to see nice to see borgy do a cameo as well wonder what he's up to now but this has to be shown in schools,0
1212,"cannot describe how well researched this docu film was the fact that imelda had the audacity to say anything that could brainwash people to turn the history upside down power is powerful and scary cannot help but to feel really affected neverforget neveragainthis film must be seen by the filipinos to educate the masses especially the generations of the past, present and the future",0
1213,really interesting to see marcos' dictatorship through the eyes of imelda marcos a must see for everyone to prevent historical revisionism,0
1214,"lauren greenfield continues her treatise on the corrupting influence of wealth and power but while greenfield is retreading familiar territory in the kingmaker, the sheer size and scope of this semi biopic dwarfs any of her previous work imelda marcos is a familiar subject for the filipino people, but greenfield recontextualizes the delusional former first lady from within a nation run by president duterte the marcos family is still as narcissistic as ever, and to no one's surprise, is still trying to weasel their way back into power it's a story the filipino people should already know by heart, but considering our goldfish memory, it's a story worth retelling until the end of time as a documentary, the kingmaker says nothing new but it does say something important",0
1215,an important view,1
1216,"the documentary tries to present two sides of a coin, but ultimately reveals itself to be slanted in the right direction for humane reasons it is political, gripping, and deeply personal to the filipino's struggle for justice the film becomes even more relevant with a narrative on duterte and how everything potentially ties to the marcoses' bid for power again while i would have preferred there was less of imelda being given the avenue to try and twist history, i know only the ignorant can be fooled by her delusions",0
1217,"here is my position we should never put imelda marcos in front of a camera i've been hearing her say the same goddamn things for my entire life, and this movie reveals nothing new in its extended conversations with this immortal tyrant we do not need to talk to the marcoses to explore their evil we do not gain insight by spending time in their palatial homes, with their art and their clothes and all the aspirational bullshit that makes them weird antiheroes in this broken oligarchic society the best parts of this film are the parts where it talks to victims, where it talks to the poor there are no two sides when telling the story of the marcoses somewhere along the way, the film seems to come to the realization that imelda isn't the harmless old biddy that they thought she was but it's too late they talked to her, and gave her yet another chance to say the vile things she's always been saying",0
1218,"never have i felt more building anger towards the marcoses and the duterte regime after finishing the kingmaker i dont leave overly political statements in my reviews, but just for the sake of this insightful and enlightening documentarythis fascist regime has to be taken down and tore apart limb from limb",0
1219,definitely not the first of its kind re portraying imelda good thing about it is how it relates her to whats happening now,0
1220,"whatever platform that lets the marcoses speak is a step with their inherent attitude of brainwashing every person into ignorance of the reality behind the aesthetics that imelda brings with glamour and class imelda's mouth must be treated like a gas chamber where her words are poison to anybody's mind marcoses set up an illusion that poverty can be eradicated with beauty and elegance, and most importantly, ignorance",0
1221,the kingmaker paints a picture crafted by two sides the result is a fine surface level cautionary tale for everyone to see it's also a good beginners course for some whos not aware of this never ending narrative,0

1229,"on one hand this documentary exposes imelda marcos for the thieving liar and delusional old bitch that she is lauren greenfield, the director, uses a careful juxtaposition of imelda's outlandish pronouncements with testimonies from people who suffered and continues to suffer under their power to further highlight how ridiculous and unrepentant she is it also does a good job in exposing how they perpetrated mediocrity and impunity through her children who are now trying to reclaim the political clout that they lost years ago there is an undercurrent of rage in the entire documentary, as we slowly see this rotten family rebuild their reputation through deceit and political connections it ends on a terrifying note she and her family insist that we forget the past and move on to pave the way for their return yet on the other hand, it also needs to be said that this documentary also gave another opportunity for the marcoses to repeat their lies it humanized them in a way, and made it seem that there is another unheard side to the narrative of our nation and that's exactly what this movie did it allowed her to speak freely i commend it for reminding us of who our enemies are, but it's also a documentary that i wish didn't get made it's mere existence means we haven't learned our lesson yet",0
1232,"i wanted a little more on imelda's background, especially toward the beginning",0

1240,"the best documentary about a narcissistic, attention seeking despot since general idi amin dada 5 stars from me but i would gladly bump it up to 5 stars if imelda gives me some of that sweet fillipino cash like she does handing out wads of bank notes at a childrens hospital or to street urchins at a stop sign i loved the scene when two of her decoratively arranged photo frames fall on the ground and her man servant sweeps up the glass imelda marcos in her senior years bares an uncanny resemblance to edith massey in polyester",0

1243,"imelda is a narcissist i think she does believe her own story, but the self serving, strategic story, too i think that in the past, people have made the mistake of thinking shes delusional, and she kind of puts that out there, but i think its very strategic she says early on in the film, people underestimate women, and sometimes thats useful i think people have underestimated her, and thats made her only the more powerful and successful lauren greenfield, director",0
1244,"i just remembered my ap teacher back then, she was in favor of marcos burial because she said taxpayers' money were used on maintaining his museum in ilocos now he's in libingan ng mga bayani, and his wax figure is still there, showing that that was never his body, and his supporters were just kissing another lie must watch especially for the younger generation, which i am a part of, the students' responses when asked about martial law is very concerning i hope this helps them see the truth i swear by this review, we will exhume marcos from the heroes' cemetery and bring his dead rotting body where he belongs and imelda and the marcoses, my god if afterlife does exist, the end is waiting for all of you",0
1245,laura greenfield really thought how do i make the marcoses look like clowns,0
1246,ever since when i was young i'm still having goosebumps watching imelda documentaries it's delusional and it shows how tactical they are,0
1247,good access to complicated character its good the doc wasnt reduce to obsessing about the shoesappreciate the context the doc brings by speaking to important contributors marcos was the first dictator i recall,0
1248,crazy to think how imelda's thisclose to completing the hat trick of having her three kings crowned,-1
1249,"i mean obviously i'm biased but i enjoyed this tackled everything from historical revisionism around the partial law period, the rebirth of fascism in the philippines, us imperialism and it's hand in philippine history, and so much more could have certainly done a lot more on the condemnation end but hey, it's a starting point i guess warranted divergence in the last third in order to justify the importance of this story in the present usually don't like that sort of thing but here we are hopefully more of these sorts of docs get produced back home and get produced in such a way that is really for the people was thinking about a review on here that said the marcoses should never ever be given a platform again, and i agree however, i think the worry that the filipino people won't be able to think critically, turn this documentary around in their minds, and decide what they want to take away from it is a larger concern",0
1250,"greenfield appeared more fascinated in than critical of imelda as a singular political force after all, imelda made her out of touch decisions and delusions of grandeur unequivocally on her own terms this film is paler in comparison to and most of the time repetitive of diazs imelda 2003 when imelda said, sometimes it helps that you are not taken too seriously, greenfield seemed to agree with her",0
1251,fantastic documentary about the philippines and the corruption of the marcos regime told in a brilliant way,0
1253,"well, ain't that a 2010 quote if ever there was one the kingmaker is a documentary about the life and times of one imelda marcos, famous first lady of the philippines for 21 years i was generally unaware of her history and her influence going into this, though i'm pretty sure i had an inkling about the shoe thing the kingmaker begins innocently enough, starting with imelda herself she goes through her history, her upbringing, her marriage, and her pride in the political power she had she proclaims herself to be the mother of the nation, a symbol of hope to the masses people love her, she says, and we're given no reason to think otherwise regular documentary viewers may know where this is going we're being lulled into a false sense of security, before the filmmakers blindside us with a right hook and say, no, actually, this is how all that really went down and how it becomes clear as the kingmaker goes on that what we're seeing is a portrait of a raging narcissist, an inconsiderate dictator, and, in all likelihood, a mass murderer the film is directed by lauren greenfield, and while i've not seen any of her previous documentaries, i can tell looking at their descriptions the queen of versailles in 2012, and generation wealth in 2018 that the kingmaker falls right into her wheelhouse of examining and deconstructing the insanity of the rich and powerful right from the start, imelda marcos cuts a fascinating, and infuriating, figure the first thing we see her do in the film is ride around in her luxury limousine, passing by scenes of abject poverty and complaining, this used to be my little paradise in my time, there were no beggars later, we see her handing out giant wads of money to random passersby this is something we see her do a bit, and we come to understand it's a regular occurrence she will frequently walk around, or ride around in busses, handing out money to the impoverished masses, who obviously respond with gratitude that's how she wins their hearts and minds, see the film plays a tricky game with imelda marcos right from the start, we're encouraged to not take her at face value the film highlights the inherently ridiculous nature of her appeals to mass popularity, and her assurance that she's just as powerful and beloved as she was in her prime, when none of that is clearly true imelda marcos begins the kingmaker as a joke, and ends it as a monster as the net of the documentary's eye widens, and more and more talking heads emerge to tell their stories of what it was actually like under marcos dictatorship, the film repeatedly returns to imelda's silent, resilient gaze, and we're forced to ask surely, there's no way you didn't know about this, right after all, you were just bragging about how you were the secret power behind your husband surely, you knew in many ways, the kingmaker is the perfect documentary for our time because imelda marcos is a clown she's a vain, pompous, egotistical fool who at one point insists to the camera that she could've solved all the world's problems, because all the world leaders just found her so charming but behind all that, there's this twisted image of a frilly despot, lounging away as her country starves, and her people are tortured by her the kingmaker i think does an excellent job at painting imelda marcos into a corner from which she can't escape, using cutaway evidence and cross testimony, all while keeping her unaware that this puff documentary is actually a hit piece i appreciate that there's never really a moment that the kingmaker allows her to seem sincere even when the extent to her monstrosity isn't quite apparent, she comes across as a complete egomaniac, with way too much while her country has way too little but then things get serious, fast there are hints as to something darker lurking under the surface early on how she talks about the period of martial law being a golden age, or how she keeps the body of her husband perfectly preserved behind glass, which is just a horrific image those animals are still there, as cross breeding catastrophes we hear about the tunnel of love, which was built by imelda's husband for her, and then became the name of a particularly grisly method of torture and we follow a series of money trails, the end result of which is that the marcos family seems to have been robbing their country blind even more worryingly, the film will frequently cut to the present, where we see imelda masterminding her son's campaign to be vice president of the philippines vice president there is different than in america it's a separate election than that of the president, and the vp generally has more responsibility than they do here , with the money she seems to have stolen directly from the people it's here that the film begins to lose me a little by playing with nonlinear chronology, it sometimes becomes hard to track the exact order of events as they happened and every once in a while, i did find myself wondering, i wonder what was happening in the rest of the world at around this time the image of imelda marcos, now elderly, on the cusp of re achieving political dominance and still in complete denial about her family's evil legacy, is appropriately chilling there are so many things in the past that we should forget",0
1254,"after watching queen of versailles, i wanted some more documentaries in my life and went on to look at more of director lauren greenfield's work the kingmaker popped up and had actually been recommended to me before so i decided to watch i had a very surface level understanding of the political world this documentary showcased i think this is an example of really great, holistic documentary making i came out of this with a much greater understanding of the topic without it being too bogged down in talking head interviews the emotions kept hitting and there was just a really powerful storytelling arc put into place here one of the best documentaries i've seen in a long time",0
1255,the kingmaker is an eye opener for what happened in the past and what could happen in the future,0
1256,"all i knew about imelda marcos was that she was basically the filipina version of jackie kennedy, with her terno sleeves and thousands of pairs of shoes when the documentary starts, she talks about her role as a first lady, her husband's infidelities, and her commitment to her country, not as a political official, but as a mother figure as the film continues, it's clear that marcos's mothering of the nation was nothing more than widespread mismanagement of government funds, corruption, and human rights abuses i think that the documentary could have introduced this side of her sooner, because the first half an hour leads us to believe that she was a formidable force in philippine politics who was relegated to the sidelines because of her sex maybe that's the editing, but it probably has something to do with marcos's masterful manipulation skills she knows what to say and how to spin situations, so the documentary is much more powerful when juxtaposing her propaganda with the testimony of real life witnesses to her crimes crimes which, unfortunately, are not explored with much depth however, the half an hour spent on the marcos family's attempts to re infiltrate philippine politics is incredible they've worked with the current president to arrest their opposition, jail the vice president, and rig the supreme court, all to make marcos jr the president imelda marcos mentions that the country is full of forgiving people who love her because she was a good mother to them i hope that, despite all their forgiving, the people don't forget now is the important thing, and the past is the past also, shoutout to jocelyn pook for an incredible score",0
1257,"i like it it's daring what else can i say, it's philippine politics in the flesh this film is actually fascinating in the sense that this film exposes us to the different parts of the political spectrum in the philippines after you finish this film, it'll definitely make you think about the politics of the philippines",0
1258,"a relatively standard format documentary cataloguing the delusion, corruption, and excess of one imelda marcos here we are not simply covering greenfields standard morally questionable, terribly wealthy, yet absurdly oblivious subject, but an actual political tyrant who has perpetrated documented harm to many could have taken some notes from oppenheimers the act of killing in documenting this type of subject neutrally and honestly while leveraging the findings to tease out new truths",0
1259,"a true horror story, featuring the country's most powerful monsters",1
1262,"being first generation american filipino, i always crave any film that has to do with the motherland ahem ahem but i digress this documentary is a reflection of philippines political history it focuses on the reign of the marcoses growing up in hawaii i would here praises of the marcoses, so i had a biased opinion of them already but this documentary sheds some light on that any other people and also the opposing party know that the marcoses ran a dictatorship and hid it under the pretense of democracy he even enacted martial law and still i heard and hear people praise him but this documentary does show the facts it also hints a stark comparison between the current reigning presidency and americas current dicta ahem ahem ahem president the silver lining was seeing the stories of the survivors there was a great quote, which i cant remember of course, but to paraphrase it was something like, the power of democracy elects the president, and revolts ousts them it shows that you can break the the country and its people, but you can not break their spirit the revolution that ended the regime was a way to move forward i hope this documentary insights people to learn from the past, and learn the importance of reclaiming the reality in truth, and not perception four stars because this shouldve been a mini series",0

1265,"it tells us what most of us already know that the marcoses want to be back in power, despite everything they've already put us through this went beyond merely showing us the excesses of the marcos family, although it did that well it also summed up where the country is at in large part due to the former dictator's regime in a neat little two hour package it reminded me why we should keep fighting",0
1267,both fascinating and scary about a delusional woman and how corruption infests everything a real eye opener for me since i didn't know that much about imelda besides her shoes,0
1268,"i felt like this had the potential to be something really special given how much access the documentary had to the key people of imeldas story, but i id still recommend it for people who dont know much about the crimes and evils the marcoses have done towards the philippines",0
1269,"ive been wanting to watch this doc for a while i had no idea this was filmed basically in 2016 however, i still found it very interesting despite being filipino, im not that knowledgeable of it political history ive always heard of the marcos family, but i never knew what it was that made them significant",0

1332,"throughout the film there were various commentaries from people and the fact that they weren't positioned in the same background with the exact same static angle was very interesting each person that gave a commentary gave it in the comfort of either their own home or office with a full frontal view, giving off a feeling of rawness and vulnerability as they spoke, luring the audience to full believe in what they say in terms of audio, there was one mellow melancholy tune that would play whenever a devastating unfortunate event was brought up, which would of course elevate the feeling of loss and damage these two feelings are important because that's the main goal of the documentary for the people to feel the loss and damage that has happened to the philippines and the people because of the abuse of power by the marcos family although the film revolved around imelda, i deeply appreciated how it did not feel biased at all the people behind the film didn't just interview and capture people in awe of imelda, but also brought in people who found the family and their doings unjust you would expect this documentary to be very one sided, but instead you get two sides battling each other although it's subtle in the documentary, it's something that is actually happening in real life in the philippines even up to today it was clear that imelda was trying to paint this picture perfect image of herself to the audience she repeatedly states that she lost her mother and that she believes she is the mother of the philippines and that she birthed all these great and beautiful things, my only question is where throughout the film i could feel nothing but indecencies coming out of her mouth i firmly believe in actions speak louder than words and there's one scene in the whole documentary that really stood out to me the scene where imelda picks up the frame and the other frames fall on the floor she acts as if nothing happened, she does not even acknowledge, and she goes on and talks about the picture frame she's holding as a worker of her shyly cleans up the broken pieces of glass on the floor this scene is really interesting as she says all these good things about herself and all yet a small act such as recognizing the frames falling and seeing the worker clean up after her she cannot acknowledge and help this is very reminiscent of her as a first lady and the marcos family they see what they want and they get it without hesitation, complete unaware of the mess they left behind for the filipinos to clean up in addition, throughout the film she mentions that throughout her reign as first lady, she was friends with powerful people all across the globe, further proving how unaware she is of her and herhusbands doings lastly, its interesting how this film was made by someone that is not a filipino im not sure why someone who has no close ties to the philippines would make a documentary about something so notorious, however, perhaps the fact that its so notorious is probably the reason why it was made by the director in the first place whatever the reason is, i think that the fact this film was made by someone looking at the outside in really gives us a non biased and equal perspective, as well as a clear division on fact and truth my gripe with this documentary is how it felt that it shifted to duterte and that it meandered from imelda and the main topic on hand, however, i can't really rule this out as the documentary was stating facts and the fact about the marcos' funding duterte was vital for people to know this film was a beautiful yet disturbing layout of philippine history everything was presented in a way that would benefit the feeling and mood of the film its definitely not for people who are very sensitive to the marcos as this film obviously dives deep into them and imeldas delusions imelda may have thought that this film would bring her and her family justice, however personally, it just justified why the philippines and its people are having hardships today cheers to lauren greenfield and her team for doing a fantastic job",1

1384,"documentary filmmaker lauren greenfield established with the queen of versailles a talent for digging into and laying bare how the obscenely wealthy will stop at nothing in the pursuit for luxurious, expensive goods that make them feel validated in their gilded bubble of privilege with the kingmaker, greenfield extends her fascination with this habitual overindulgence to the realm of politics, where a rich person's gluttonous spending and consuming means that money is being denied to a whole lot of people whose welfare the rich person is ostensibly meant to care for former first lady of the philippines imelda marcos is the focus of greenfield's probing, involving study of despotic decadence, and when we're given a glimpse of a closet housing marcos' 1,000 pairs of nice shoes, it's pretty impossible as an american viewer not to think of how our current president once counted a solid gold toilet as one of his prized possessions as an interview subject, marcos is more shrewd at polite evasions and even tempered rationalizations than trump ever has been, so greenfield's interviews with filipino activists, former political prisoners, and other residents end up being more illuminating than her sit downs with the woman at the film's center but while the lack of hugely revealing soundbites from marcos is a flaw of this solid documentary, it's not one that greenfield should realistically shoulder the blame for if non fiction filmmakers focusing on politics were expected to find and interview only wealth hoarding rulers who are as rivetingly dumb and vicious as trump is, it's likely they'd never get any work done",0

1396,"it's pretty crazy how charisma works on many levels in the kingmaker, we see explore this through the marcos regime and its aftermath and perhaps future we see imelda sitting in her apartment, surrounded by the riches and the beauty she always seems to strive for some can probably note the piece behind her as something in the style of picasso, and yes, it is definitely a picasso she even proudly confirms this herself imelda has a way with words she interweaves her personal stories with sentiment, nostalgia, and this whole schtick with maternity i'll get to that later it's as sugar coated as it is convincing, especially if you don't know much about the marcos family or if your filipino history game is a bit lacking outsiders who are out of the loop may sympathise, and the filipino viewers most of who are tired and weary may even be captivated by her through their last shred of hope but this is where it gets good i really like how greenfield lets imelda talk, then juxtaposes it with accounts from multiple people the selection was very interesting, with the roster including people who sympathise with and fought against the marcos regime back in those days it even includes people who are currently in office at least during the time of this review then suddenly you, the viewer, realise that imelda's words are like a house of cards my favourite example of this is calauit island, where greenfield not only tells but shows exactly what exactly it had done to both the animals and people who lived there decades later this style of show and perhaps contradict repeats throughout the documentary, and greenfield lets it all speak for itself you, the viewer, doesn't really have to be told outright that imelda is a narcissist it just comes out she tries to hide it around this whole thing about how she is the, and i loosely quote, mother of the world that it perfectly justifies the reason why her son should be in power, and how they were actually doing a good thing this includes her husband's regime but through the help of the accounts of others, the kingmaker paints a disturbingly beautiful picture created by the brushstrokes of horror, pain, and struggle that trickles down even in modern filipino society while imelda sits in places of extravagance, and the kingmaker, does not hesitate in making us remember where exactly all that money came from a few notes trigger warning on sexual abuse and torture i was so mad for her, and mad that she experienced what she did the guy who had to pick up those glass shards i see you, and you are valid does require a basic knowledge of who marcos is and everything since this whole doc is mostly focused on imelda and their lifestyle, it doesn't delve deep into more of the questionable stuff they've done i'd say this doc requires a viewer who is open minded and can look at things objectively if you are considering to showing this to your nanay, tatay, and other members of the family, i'd say your chances of making them reconsider their stances are 50 50 i found that it's very easy to attach yourself to imelda family and ignore everyone else in this doc, especially if your insert family member here has an aversion to leni robredo who shares a decent amount of screen time in this doc",0
1397,"i wish the movie had the same ending as marie antoinette or maybe imelda marcos facing a firing squad nonetheless, its a powerful documentary that showed me that the marcos greed destroyed the philippines and they truly may never recover",0
1399,"unforgettable, unbelievable, batsh t crazy, and terrifying this is like a split screen funhouse mirror of our present and future right down to the make our country great again sloganeering giving marcos this platform at first feels like a familiar, kitschy, tiger king kind of exploitation, but that gets flipped once you realize the kind of horrific, cunning person this funny, eccentric woman is as abhorrent as she is, it's hard not to be impressed with her dynasty's surprise comeback might be best doc of the year",0
1400,"this multi faceted doc is very well made and i hope everyone watches it to my fellow filipinos, never forget",0
1402,"recent history and stories of shoe mountains aside, i didnt know much about the 20th 21st century political history of the philippines funny at the outset, it lulls you into a false sense of security before unleashing the ever increasing corruption, violence and greed of the political dynasties involved in running the country for the last century",0

1407,"to me, the best documentaries have me stalking around the house arguing with people ive made up in my own head the kingmaker reveals an ongoing chapter in history and flags up so many well worn axioms that us lot people the world over need to keep re learning history repeats itself and here its done so within living memory its also sad that we well know and in many cases celebrate the life and crimes of bad people and yet were less familiar with saints like corazon aquino, the marcos successor and mother of democracy read more",0

1413,"fascinating documentary about the marcos family at its centre the larger than life imelda this is definitely one to watch at the nziff we see imelda dishing out money to the poor lamenting that it was never like this in her day sitting in her house surrounded by her staff who fuss over her, and the paintings on the wall clearly a monet and picasso she sucks you in with her own version of the truth from her 'humble' beginnings...",0

1420,"we visited the house of representatives for our philippine politics and governance class about a year ago and imelda was there imagine that this woman, who throughout this whole movie flaunts her ill gotten wealth and love of shoes in the face of those she robbed, still has a place in philippine politics i never forgot that day, and i doubt i ever will anyway, for what this documentary accomplishes in unveiling the true nature of imelda, it is a good entry point into the crazy world of local politics what else can i say except mahirap talaga maging pilipino",0
1422,"from the title itself, it has this desire to say that there's a powerful woman behind every king this came out ingenuine and, who's to say that the filipino people are incapable of nurturing tyrannical kings too the kingmaker fosters the perception that imelda protects so much plus, the way she keeps talking about the ultimate goal of her life is to birth a country nourished by her motherly traits, and, for a while, she's been blessed to be that motherthe filipino's mother, our mother one thing that i found interesting in this film was the way it illustrated the parallelism of the mini zoo, that the marcoses have sheltered in calauit, to the marcos' clan likened to the giraffes and zebras, they're all inbred to create a perilous kingdoma political dynasty they're in a land where they are not welcome, and their inbreeding is almost a tactic to force themselves to remain herea land that's not theirs to rein the locals of calauit gets it every day, this mini zoo serves as a reminder that the country is a living circus with power thirsty freaks punyeta hahai wish the film could have centered more on the victims they were already therethey interviewed the right people, made them resurface the trauma that stemmed from the injustices during marcos' regime we've gone beyond the need for imelda marcos to exist",0

1424,"amazing access is given to the former first lady of the philippines and we hear in her own words what she believes her legacy to be in her country's history that the filmmakers essentially have her self incriminate for some of the worst aspects of her time in power and make no mistake, she held plenty of power is revelatory but it also exposes how much all supposedly democratic nations can colour over their past if a new narrative is more convenient scarily relevant for our current political climate",-1
1425,i'm giving this doc five out of five middle fingers for making me seethe with anger any time a marcos was on screen to speak,-1
1426,"i expected so much from this film i thought it's gonna call out the violence and oppression experienced by pilipinos during the late dictator, fascist ferdinand marcos's term but no, it just like praise imelda marcos, for i don't know the woman that she is",0
1427,"the kingmaker is a 2019 documentary film written and directed by lauren greenfield, featuring the political career of imelda marcos with a focus on the marcos family's efforts to rehabilitate the family's image and to return to political power, including her plans to see her son bongbong become president of the philippines, and the alliance that bongbong and imee marcos established with rodrigo duterte in his bid to win the 2016 philippine presidential election this documentary lays bare the vile nature of the political strategies deployed by the marcos family ferdinand marcos is deservedly portrayed as a fascist capitalist dictator but their greed and lust or power does not stop there after ferdinand dies and is denied a funeral in the philippines, they deploy covert secret strategic tactics to regain power, status and regain their former political reign i was shocked by the fact that the philippine people still believed in the marcos family even after ferdinand marcos had 30 for some unknown reason they still vote for imee marcos, ferdinand's daughter, and later on even for bong bong, ferdinand's son in actuality the marcos family had struck a deal with duterte, a former minister in marcos' government, for the mere purpose of letting duterte become president once duterte becomes president he removes all those who do not agree with marcos' views duterte when inaugurated acts just like his former co conspirator ferdinand marcos and keeps the people in check by oppression similar action are taken against the vice president robredo furthermore, imee has become a senator in the northern region of the philippines duterte, and the marcos family are now working towards having bong bong inaugurated as the new president of the philippines",0
1428,"a ridiculously intimate view into the life of imelda marcos and the legacy she has left behind its unthinkable how power concentrated in the hands of two peopleherself and her husband, back when he was still presidentcould rip apart the lives of millions, but this documentary leaves no stone unturned in its unflinching exploration of history as shaped by them the first half of the documentary is laughable, satirical almost, as one listens to imeldas own retelling of past events, perfected to a crisp with rehearsed smoothness but the second half is a punch in the stomach, once greenfield pieces together various stories regarding the political scene in the philippines to flesh out a portrait of greed, corruption, lavishness and cruelty that now runs through generations not only do the effects of the marcos regime still reverberate deeply through the country today, it feels almost as if they have never left with their relentless quest to return to power the photography is straightforward but agile the editing simple but powerful the soundtrack eerie but compelling put together, there cannot be a title more aptly descriptive about the rise and fall and rise again of imelda than the kingmaker",0
1429,ugh sobrang cringey and narcissistic ni madam at ng kanyang pamilya kadiri so full of themselves,0
1430,"this is a masterpiece level documentary, which exposes not just this former first lady, but all wanna be dictators and shows how they create these fictions to worm their way into national psyche and exploit the very people they claim to want to mother imelda marcos should be rotting in jail at this point, and yet she lives like a queen in america, the male equivalent to imelda reigns, and everything he touches turns to death, all the while enriching his family",-1

1432,"you can skip the first half we already know the marcoses are corrupt and power hungry plunderers the interesting matters actually come up in the second half where, curiously, imelda isn't even shown most of the time more questions and arguments are left open by the end",0

1436,"an object lesson in a documentarian's restraint, as imelda marcos displays all of the messianic pretensions that were the hallmark of the dictatorial regime she was at the head of and seeks to perpetuate through her children, who still hold sway despite their legacy of vast corruption and thousands of extrajudicial killings during the eight years of ferdinand marcos' martial law decree lauren greenfield's documentary might well be the defining record of the end of three decades of philippine democracy and the return to ruthless, kleptocratic autocracy",0
1437,"if you're looking for another populist dictator's rise to power to be terrified of, this is a must watch boy oh boy does democracy burn so easy",0
1438,"the kingmaker is a masterpiece of documentary filmmaking with clever editing, unexpectedly candid interviews and a recurring visual metaphor that keeps on giving, it is an impeccable depiction of how kleptocracy, ahistoricity and dynastic politics lead to fascism its themes are applicable way beyond the philippines but as a primer to the country's politics it is incredibly smooth",0
1439,"nziff 2020 15so incredibly interesting i've read a lot about the philippines politics from the last 4 years, but prior to that i knew nothing so 'the kingmaker' was super informative the way the film is set out, really gave this story the best emotional impact possible it did leave the moral question though, even if someone like imelda marcos comes off looking evil, is it right to give her a platform like this in the first place i dont know the answer, but i do know i was on the edge of my seat the entire runtime",0
1441,jail now,-1
1442,"we dont need to hear the marcoses speak to see what theyve done to the philippines this documentary meanders its way to its shocking conclusion, taking its time to first portray imelda as an eccentric, delusional, and seemingly harmless old bat but we shouldnt have to hear what the marcoses have to say anymore, no matter how ridiculous",0
1443,the kingmaker is an eye opener this documentary film taught me more about the true history of my country than what i merely heard growing up the past is not forgotten,-1
1444,"in this day and age where corruption is widespread in my own land, it is most disheartening to see these political families achieve the full potential of their own charisma towards the blind masses although unique from each other, the message is the same with the strong contemporary documentaries released within the first years of president dutertes administration such as a thousand cuts and aswang compared with the two however, lauren greenfields film is more well edited, hinting parallelisms from the past marcos administration with the current government, making imelda marcos as the bridge that kept filling the gap between the two grandiose and almost royal in manner, i see imelda in a two headed monster having one neck that is filled of delusions of grandeur the monsters other head died, and as the head was cut off and laid unfortunately to rest amongst the honorables, one head continues to rise this ardent and repugnantly wide neck is imelda herself being true to her brand, imelda blatantly shows wealth, which is a manifestation of her own understanding of beauty and love but hidden beneath her clamor were the suffering of many filipinos from the residents of calauit island to the murder and rape victims of martial law and to all the filipinos, to whom the marcoses are still accountable for she stood by ferdinand marcos dictatorial rule and shes standing by bongbongs political route to power the rise and fall and their rising again feels like that filipinos are inside a horror movie wherein it doesnt matter how many times you kill the monster rest assured that after the end credits, a resurrection will be shown, which will birth a series of never ending sequels with our body there are lots of checks and balances that maintain homeostasis likened to a well oiled machine, it is very organized up to a certain point wherein a harmful external factor can damage the whole organism with my country, it seems that theres a gradual reversal of this homeostasis slowly creeping in in the very own checks and balances of this countrys institutions as a healer by profession, i tend to the sick there is so much that i can do to save a life, but one cant save them all and with this film it serves this purpose recalling the past, stating the present and heeding a warning for the future",0
1445,"a very fascinating snapshot into the history of filipino politics and the marcos nasty dynasty ive heard about imeldas crazy excessive extravagant lifestyle, but didnt realize it was more than just that",0
1446,"if these people the marcoses will be brought to power again, there's a very big chance that the sins of the past will be committed again in the future the kingmaker managed to acclimate the political situation here in the philippines, both then and now when i was 8 years old, i remember my father brought a cd of imelda 2003 when he came home from work in manila i had a vague memory of me watching this film on tv, together with my family, when netflix or any streaming services weren't concepted yet little did i know that beyond the tapestry of all imelda's extravagant furniture and her infamous 3,000 pair of shoe collection shown in the film, is a lady who stood by a tyrant and a dictator, who's ill gotten wealth is being paid off by the filipino people up to this very moment what's even more baffling is the fact that in the kingmaker, imelda claims that the era of martial law in the philippines upheld sovereignty, freedom, justice, and human rights in our country it saddens me how students here define marcos' era as being peaceful and disciplined, as per reflected in the documentary i really hope colleges would mandatorily employ martial law studies in order to revisit the past, and scrutinize where things have gone wrong i'm glad how this documentary also pointed out the current duterte administration vis a vis marcos' era as a point of reference, i could enunciate a number of similarities between their presidencies it's like reliving the past and the horrors all over again god bless the philippines catch me on the road to mars whenever time permits so",0
1447,"i was always criticized for being excessive, but that is the spirit of mothering you cannot quantify love this film does an excellent job capturing imelda marcos as both a charismatic, captivating force of nature still at ninety and as a batshit crazy tyrant greenfields interviews with the controversial dictatorial matriarch provide shocking, probably unparalleled access into the views of a woman reflecting with pride upon half a century of corruption for me, the most insane new understanding gleaned from marcos life story is that while we like to simplify evil as the act of doing wrong for the sake of self interest, marcos truly seems to believe that her greed and self martyrdom and megalomania and family dynasty building is good for the philippines and the world holy fuck",0
1448,perception is real and the truth is not imelda's when you lose your money mother freudian slip is the best one i've ever heard,-1
1449,"i appreciate how lauren greenfield, a foreigner, has been so eager to share this story so the wider world can learn about the past horrors in the philippines under the marcos regime, which are repeating themselves under the duterte administration however, this film felt neutral and detached from the harsh reality faced by the victims of the marcos regime maybe its because its coming from a filmmaker who didnt experience martial law firsthand and grew up far from the story, relying only on research people in the philippines who experienced martial law and those who grew up hearing the horrifying stories and studying the historywe know that ferdinand marcos is no hero, and we will never forget his evil deeds there is only one side to the story about the marcoses they are monsters",0
1450,nziff 2020 7 wow,-1
1452,"i wouldn't say the film idolises her it is fairly transparent in its outsider perspective in condemning imelda marcos not exactly pressing or holding her to account, not that any filmmaker might be successful in such a pursuit, but revealing enough of her motivations",0
1453,"the rise and fall of imelda marcos and the marcos family, and their attempt to rise to power once more i find imelda's story tragic in my opinion because i honestly believe that she was a really strong and intelligent woman back in the day for having that charisma meeting and charming the strongest leaders of the world that at that time unfortunately, the pressure of politics took a toll on her mental state, the corrosiveness of power got into her, and ferdinand marcos's affairs was just the final nail on the coffin of her sanity and overall well being obviously, the insanity and the narrative that she convinced herself was passed down to her children and influenced their whole family for the worse ever since the new administration has come in, the marcoses have been able to regain political clout they have scrubbed clean the sins of the past, and they're trying to protect themselves as the leaders for the future andy baustista former chairman of elections and pcgg i liked that this documentary doesn't focus only on the past but also dwells on the danger of electing another marcos in malacanang presidential palace of the philippines i'm just in awe at the nerve of these people trying regain political power after all the atrocity they brought to the philippines that we are still suffering with until now imelda used ferdinand marcos as her puppet to get away from all the crimes she committed, and she is trying to attempt the same thing with her son bong bong marcos by pressuring him to run for the position bong bong just made it easy for her because he is desperate to get his mother's and his family's approval besides reviving their political clout and gaining power himself duterte revealed himself that his campaign was funded and supported by the marcoses and his father was a cabinet member of president marcos during his first term of candidacy this just gives us a reason to believe that even tho bong bong marcos did not win the elections, the marcos family still has their foot on the door one big evidence of this is that imelda is still on the loose even though she was already found guilty of graft and corruption 2 years ago which is only one of many more examples i really enjoyed the editing on this documentary, it really showed the true colors of the marcoses with the supposedly behind the scene shots a lot of infuriating moments too like when imelda hid her painting from the pcgg and the corrupt priest calling her the mother of all, our only first lady kudos to the filmmakers showing those scenes at the right moments which puts the context of imelda's wickedness on a whole different level with all said and done, all we can do now is educate the masses, improve our educational system, put the real history in our watered down textbooks history books, remind the people of the monstrosity that this family brought to the philippines with anecdotes in hopes that history won't repeat itself which is unfortunately slowly happening right now with the duterte administration what matters now is for them to be informed etta rosales activist and former congresswoman",0

1459,fascinating documentary and easy to follow even if you do not have an intimate interest into the affairs and history of the philippines the documentary is balanced and provides ample time to critics of imelda marcos to present a complex picture of the former first lady of the philippines,0
1460,so much to unpack here just by fact that the marcos regime plays such a singularly huge role in modern politics in the philippines to this day which is pretty mind bogglingso this is a pretty decent rundown of the last 60 years of social turmoil with an endlessly fascinating political figure as its subject in focus because it goes off on a bunch of potentially compelling tangents without going into detail i wish this was expanded to a series but this doc is well worth a look if youre interested,0

1478,"the whole documentary film revealed how horrible and dangerous the marcoses are from how they got the money and power down to how they used it to rewrite history and erase the atrocities during their regime at the present time when the possible resurgence of the marcoses in the philippine government, this film should be a reminder to everyone that if the marcoses were able to abuse and lie on the face of the filipino people in the past, there is also a big possibility that they will abuse the freedom and lie on the face of the filipino once again it will never be a surprise if in the future it will be proven that they maximized their machinery to get where they are today",0
1479,"the documentary perfectly captured the experiences of the marcoses and the exploited filipinos during their regime it shows what it is like to live with extensive wealth and how the marcoses used it for political power and self interests this is a must watch for those who wish to see the marcos' perspective on martial law and their countless political movements this documentary shows the truth, through direct interviews with the marcoses, and it is up to you if you will believe it as john henry newman would say we can believe what we choose but we are answerable for what we choose to believe",0
1480,"weathering the storm that is imelda marcos is difficult, deadly even however, lauren greenfield's haunting documentary the kingmaker proves that one can dance with the devil the film examines the lives of the marcos clan from their rise to the philippine government, their downfall, and their eventual return to their current political endeavors to those unfamiliar with their name, the presidency of ferdinand marcos 1965 to 1986 caused some of the worst human rights violations seen in philippine history, not to mention how the oppressive regime plunged the country's economy greenfield wastes no time in depicting the dichotomy between imelda and the everyday filipino citizen its first scene illustrates how emotionless she is when she hands out 50s to the beggars, proceeding to call their area depressing after reflecting on her loss of power this opening scene already sets imelda as someone immaculate, a savior orin her wordsa mother to those who are in need of her love but as the film proceeds, we see how the marcoses were never the loving parents every child wanted their names continue haunt the people who were tortured and killed during martial law the kingmaker beautifully interpolates many sides of those who lived during and beyond the marcos dictatorship it is this multisectoral approach that helps audiences understand how grave the consequences of martial law really are from imelda's friends to opposition figures and martial law victims and activists, no stone is left unturned in dissecting how imelda's brain works what took the cake for me was how these figures were visited a few years after for example, vice president leni robredo and activist may rodriguez' thoughts regarding bongbong marcos' vice presidential run were cut into twothe time leading up to the 2016 elections and the aftermath of robredo's win this follow up emphasizes how the marcoses' dirt will never be erased from history, despite their numerous attempts to do so it feels like the country hasn't moved much in terms of progression what's more haunting is that all the imagery of marcos running feels familiar, scarily real even now that marcos is vouching for president, it is deeply concerning how far their influence can go this is what exactly the kingmaker aims to address to expose the shoes and skeletons of the marcos family's closets and to remind filipinos of their oppressive rule it demonstrates how far one will go to sustain their wealth, power, and image time will tell when the marcos magic will finally disappear from the country but for now, let this film be a reminder to never forget the many lives that suffered under their brutal rule",0
1481,"the epilogue part is not biased it is a great movie every great movie, regardless of its genre and while this is a documentary, will leave you questioning this movie have broadened my knowledge and left my heart stirred just to give a little weigh to balance the majority of the reviews that has been shared above, i can say, the the epilogue really left me cluless about the later it help me become more aware about the history of the philippine politics probably, i will be seeing myself watching this documentary again i want to feel the tension in the converse between the statements of the characters choosen to be interviewed who ever is reading this, i challenge you try watching it again",0
1482,"this should be mandatory viewing for high school students as part of philippine history and a long test as part of your grades, plus an essay the marcoses want to take back malacanang palace to rule the country once again i think imelda really believes what she's saying in the documentary",0
