Quezon,"Both cinematic and educational: As a college student, this gave me wider perspective not only about Quezon and the other main historical characters of the film, but about election campaigns and politics and the games politicians play. In history, it is a hidden pearl to find a Filipino that is truly clean, without having to compromise or worse manipulate to achieve their goals. That is why we have to thorough and unbiased research and immersion between all candidates or parties whenever we vote.

MINOR SPOILERS: Through my favorite device that is film within a film, Quezon exposes the grey areas of politics, and that the historical theme of whether Filipinos truly understands what Independence entails is eye-opening (more so in the tie back ending sequence)

I also love the parallelism between the themes of the obsession of power (Osmeña but more Quezon) and hero complex (Aguinaldo and Wood) somehow disguised as public service. Don't get me wrong, in watching this film, I believe all these men had good intentions during their tenure, but in the end they all had their past and present mistakes that the film highlights for us to be skeptical about those intentions.

The film has the staple Bayaniverse cinematography and soundtrack!

My only nitpick with the film is (1) the ending kinda villianized Quezon just for dramatization and that (2) in the feminist perspective, there wasnt ample stress or building of the relationship between Quezon, Osmeña, Aguinaldo, Roxas and the women behind them, unlike in Heneral Luna and Goyo.

Quezon,"Higher Use of Creative License: Unlike previous installments that were close to real-life events, this movie contained a lot of purely fictional scenes and plot. It is more of a creative social commentary regarding the Filipino political system than a loosely-based historical recollection.

Overall, it is very good and creative in conveying the moral of the story but one must be careful in accepting any of the events as fact.",15/10/2025,positive,0.988818467,0
Quezon,"Enticing and fiery: By far this is one of the movies in our film making history that actually broke the ""Filipino"" style of film making, not that it is bad but it can be too predictive especially with the characters. It gave the protagonist a complex personality and background that almost we people relate to. Manuel Quezon in the movie is by far what I declare as THE best Filipino character made in this country's industry. Not to mention the performance made by the cast not just Jericho Rosales but all of them.

For the movie's feel everything and I mean everything is greatly beyond my expectation, it felt like it was true to life and it romanticized the vibe of that era. The music matched the personality of Quezon which was a spectacular. And the cinematography was handled by an artist of its craft.

Although in the last part (spoilers) as said in one of the reviewer's statement in the review section, they kind of made Quezon a villain in the end, to which I have no problem with as it is a creative liberty of the writer and director to do. Overall this film is breaking barriers and blockades. This might be my favorite movie this year.",19/10/2025,positive,0.996226072,0
Quezon,"October 31, 2025 - 1 of 2 general impression: Filipino  films rarely get played here in the US. So as soon as I saw this showing at the AMC app yesterday, I had to watch.

*** Note: I was not a good student during my school days - Elementary, Middle, High School years.

I graduated with a 1.2 GPA (Grade Point Average) So needless to say, I never had the capacity to retain any information - Science, Math, and History.

Both Philippine and US History.

This morning, the only perspective I had on Manuel Quezon was, he had a city named after him.

Where I was born and raised, Quezon City.

My mother worked closely with the former Mayor of Quezon City - Brigido ""Jun"" Simon, Jr. From 1986 to 1992. Her desk was right outside his office.

During those years, on Manuel Quezon's birthday, we would visit his tomb at the Quezon Memorial.

My general knowledge was that he obviously is a National hero.

Until after I saw this film.... Here's a line from the movie, towards the end, a line that was said to Manuel Quezon during his later years, ""You are not a King"" .... I'm pretty sure you all get the hint and tone of the movie.

I promise to myself, I will do diligent research to get both sides of his story. And come to a better understanding. Which will come most likely by next year. After the 2026 Academy Awards here in the US.

The overall Cinematography and Motion Picture soundtrack - is a 10.

Looking forward to watching this film again and downloading it for my personal collection of movies.

Currently as of 10/31/2025 count: Films watched (in-person Screener & viewed-on Mobile/at Home combined) - 66 TV series (in-person Screeners) 13.",31/10/2025,positive,0.779395342,0
Quezon,"Quezon Made Me Politically Numb: If there's one political drama set in the Philippines that actually feels real, this is it. Watch this film - it's got all the juicy elements of a Filipino political story: power, ego, corruption, and all that messy human stuff. But what's nice is it doesn't feel like a rip-off of some foreign political drama. It's so grounded, so Filipino, that you can almost smell the cigar smoke and hypocrisy. I'm talking about Quezon, the last part of Gerald Tarog's trilogy.

And man, classic Gerald Tarog move - he never gives you that simple ""good vs evil"" setup. Everything's in the gray area. You can't really tell who's the villain and who's supposed to be the ""hero."" Sure, the title says Quezon, but don't expect to be rooting for him. This version of Quezon? He's a piece of work - cunning, manipulative, and so Machiavellian it hurts. You kinda admire his brilliance, but at the same time, you can't stand how self-serving he is.

What's great is that the film doesn't try to moralize. It doesn't pretend to be righteous or ""for the people."" It just shows politics as it really is - dirty, ambitious, full of people pretending to be heroes while chasing power. It's not preachy at all, and that's what makes it hit harder.

The vibe? Think The Wolf of Wall Street, but make it political and Filipino. Everyone's selfish, everyone's got an agenda, and no one's clean. You can't fully hate them, but you sure can't love them either - and that's exactly why it feels so real.

If you've seen the first two films, you'll appreciate this one more. There are plenty of callbacks that make it feel like a proper closure. What's surprising is how Quezon ends up softening Aguinaldo's image. This time, he's shown as this calm, conservative old man - almost like a fallen sage. After being painted as the villain before, he finally feels human. It's like Tarog's saying, ""He wasn't a monster, just a flawed man in a broken system.""

Jericho Rosales gives a bold performance. At first, his Quezon feels a bit exaggerated - the accent, the gestures, the swagger - but the longer you watch, the more it makes sense. We don't have much real footage of the man, so Jericho's take feels like a believable reconstruction. Tarog clearly wanted this Quezon to feel both authentic and uncomfortable - the kind of leader you recognize in today's politics.

The script works. The occasional strong language fits perfectly - that's how real politicians talk behind closed doors. The dialogue sounds lived-in, the tension feels raw.

Visually, the film looks good, but you can tell there were budget limits. Some big events, like rallies, felt small in scale - more like social gatherings in hotel lobbies than massive political spectacles. Still, the indoor scenes look great and atmospheric. The American characters are forgettable except for Leonard Wood, but maybe that's intentional since they're not the focus anyway.

The pacing near the end feels rushed - especially the Corregidor and Malinta Tunnel scenes. The story wraps up fine, but the scale drops suddenly, like the production ran out of steam. You expect something grander, given the World War II backdrop. But even with those limits, Tarog still lands the emotional punch.

My only gripe is how the film implies that all our political rot - corruption, nepotism, oligarch control - started with Quezon. Symbolically, it's clever, but it's also unfair. It's not just one man's fault. This isn't about Quezon alone; it's about a system that's been rotten for generations.

What Quezon nails, though, is how it mirrors our current politics. The bribery, the PR manipulation, the media playing both sides - it's all there. Watching it feels like watching the evening news. Different names, same game. Tarog even captures the hypocrisy of the press: ""attack and collect, defend and collect."" That line alone could describe our political media today.

So yeah, Quezon isn't just about Quezon. It's a mirror - of power, greed, and us.

And after watching it, I didn't feel angry or inspired - just numb. The first film, Heneral Luna, fired you up. Goyo made you question heroism. But Quezon? It leaves you hollow, politically agnostic, almost hopeless. Maybe that's the point - that in our politics, no one's really clean, and the cycle never ends.

If that's what Tarog wanted to show, he absolutely nailed it.",16/10/2025,positive,0.975886583,0
Quezon,"A Lack of Critical and Actual Criticism for the Shady Quezon: I think the film has true promise. Quezon has always been quite a controversial figure of the early fight for true Philippine independence. He did as much good and as much bad if you really think deeply about it BUT the film is just presented in such a dense way.

In posits there is true good in Politics.

Even sections of actual criticism in the film is really hampered by Tarrog's insistence of the right 'governance'. The lack of a real alternative or an actual in depth conversations that does not really fall into this guise of moral grandstanding is prevalent that it was so eyeroll inducing.

You can read philosophies and still be the worst person ever - a college with Liberal Arts make you learn that quickly. If Quezon did not win, what does Aguinaldo can offer in the table that he himself had not done too?

Rather film, just villainizes Quezon's insistence to lead. One good example of the film's insistence for moralistic bent but lack of actual 'analysis' is the film's villainization of Quezon's use of his connection.

That is what connections are for. To create this dynamic give and take but it oh no, that is bad - because he can make so much campaign materials. It never really delivered on the fact on what would become the Nacionalista Party lead to one of the biggest ultra-majority in the Philippine's History, a familiar sight if anyone has lived to tell in the Duterte era Congress.

In fact, the film kinda glosses the fact that this same majority lead the changes in the constitution that inadvertently resulted to the Marcos Dictatorship. In fact, I do think the reason there are many rich families interested in Government is because how they were able to really to enter political spaces during this time.

Like for a film that prides itself as critical, it always uses these weak arguments to posit the rather double face attitude of Quezon. I was grasping straws, because it uses the worst criticisms (ad hominems) rather than just actually pulling real punches that is still present in the current Philippine political space.

It just bats this idea that Quezon wants the presidency is bad (it is not), because he wants it no matter what. His machination is bad since he is not truthful about his intention.

It literally facts that Quezon is a problematic and prolific muckraker, that most of what we hate about Aguinaldo is actually rooted towards his campaign against him. It is attested but a lot of actual paper trails sadly has been destroyed by the war of 45.

The film posits that is bad. (not necessarily) but the problem here is that the film also plays out the same muckraking as noble against some of his 'enemies' since they were not able to use it openly (hypocritical).

Like come-on now film. That is just plain stupidity at this point. You cannot just make this two sides of the coin when it's practically the same side. Even just picking cabinet members from his ultra-majority is played as if its bad since he is in the end trying to seek the 'faithfuls' of his herd - like that is weak criticism of Quezon's.

I also hate how the film hates Quezon for his aggressive approach to independence but loves the American simply because the Americans found that the filipino plebe does not know the word about the word for Independence.

Stupidity, THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT THE LEADERS to begin with. Another instance of the film going for the soft analysis over real question of readiness with the leadership.

And also, it really gives so much pass for the Americans and how they handled the Philippines, because they are well-meaning apparently. Suddenly, the atrocities is just a side comment here and there. Even Aguinaldo, who could have been more complex as a character himself is just plainly glorified.

I just feel there is so much more here that could have been made to make this actually critical in a sense that in actually is talking about things that would still be prevalent in our life and all.

On a lighter mode, Good performances though. Echo is effective as Quezon. I personally think certain actors looked closer to the very Hispanized Quezon but he has character for it. He performed really well and the cavalcade of supporting role was a welcome surprise. I personally think the film did well visually and editing wise, which is a lot for a local film, though the costuming though is really bad - a lot of badly fitted suits.

I will still recommend this BUT it lacks a deep reading about Quezon's role in PHI history tbh. It is important to look at this with a more critical eyes since this does tackle a lot of true issues about Quezon but in a way that feels misguided tbh.",19/11/2025,negative,0.719964564,0
Quezon,"Quezon (2025): ""The story & life of Quezon"": Quezon feels like a well-crafted film that Jerrold Tarog put a lot of effort into, both in writing and directing. Rosales's performance as the lead really stands out and carries the movie. Visually, it's a treat with a unique old-school style and great production design that captures the early 1900s vibe perfectly.

The story also creates a good amount of intrigue, even if some parts aren't perfectly executed. Despite its flaws, it's an interesting watch because of its strong visuals and engaging narrative. Overall, Quezon is a solid film that shows real craftsmanship and is worth a watch.

Quezon,"Good message, Bad Film: After watching Quezon. It truly feels like a hit piece for the old president. Arrogant, Megalomaniac, I am the Philippines.

The movie constantly states that you must look at things from different perspectives, yet shows that he does not have any redeeming quality. Other than i guess he looks good.

Satirical claims are understandable as this film is shot like a satire. Quezon v Osmeña, Quezon v Wood. But idk why its not like that with chapter 3, Quezon v Aguinaldo.

You can say that Quezon is already well regarded by many and a good film came out a few years back (Quezon's Game), but that is just careless in this day and age. As movies like this are perceived as truth by those who are not busily reading in-depth filipino history books, by students and others in the Philippines

But to give credit where credit is due. Most criticism in the film of quezon are real: the r**e case, the being two faced, being an arrogant/megalomaniac, back handing Osmeña.

One criticism i have is the I am the Philippines scene. I know this film uses fictional elements but pumping up the drama at the end while the truth (more of a rumor) is that he said this in a New York hospital.. while looking at refection of him self.

Its hard to like this film if you one of those that dont like grand standing and moral messaging being pushed in the forefront. Cause it happens a lot. With joven's uncle and wife.

Other than that, its filmed well, dialogues are written well, and great casting.",01/11/2025,negative,0.823808193,0

Quezon,"A few weeks ago Cinemartys reminded all of us the massacre committed by Leonard Wood in Mindanao. But somehow, this movie humanized Leonard Wood. Making him charismatic and only wants to serve the people, at worst, a bureaucrat. But Leonard Wood was racist and an imperialist. His writings about the Philippines, depicting Filipinos as mostly backward and savages, were the reason why the US government did not give us independence immediately. And yet the movie not only gave credence to his racist tirades, it made it into facts. This is wrong in so many levels. I understand that we should unmask our heroes, but making the founding fathers as villains is a slippery and dangerous slope for a nation that easily forgets its own history. At a time that our sovereignity is in peril by outside and even inside forces, a movie questioning our genesis is a bit irresponsible. Not to mention the hypocrisy of a rousing speech against patronage politics then thanking the sister of the sitting president and the daughter of the dictator in the end credits. Admittedly, Quezon is a much better film than Goyo, but it's irrelevant at this point. [Glorietta]",19/10/2025,positive,0.51179111,0

Quezon,"i had a chance to watch their block screening on the first day and got to see their amazing actors, mon confiado, benjamin alves, jake macapagal, ana abad santos, and therese malvar, thanks to national university.the concept of making a prequel about the people we call our national heroes is a smart and refreshing move in philippine cinema. the director shows them as normal people with strong political desires, which mirrors the never ending power game we still see today. from emilio aguinaldo to manuel quezon, all the way to the marcos-duterte tandem, i must say they follow the same pattern. we treat these men like mythical figures and grow up with a clean version of them. then the film shows them bargaining, manipulating, and protecting their own interests, and you realize the cycle never stopped. it feels heavy at first because you hope someone in that era stood as the clear hero, but the more the story unfolds, the more you see how power shaped all of them.what i love about this film is that i went inside the cinema thinking I would learn another honest story from our former presidents and understand why they are considered important figures in history, not just because they led the country but because of what they sacrificed during their time. but after watching it, i realized that both emilio aguinaldo and manuel quezon, despite the rivalry and the clear protagonist antagonist framing, never truly cared about the filipino people and were both playing dirty.quezon is a great communicator and strategist. these helped him rise from being a lawyer to becoming the second president of the philippines. we grow up hearing his name and thinking of one of the best presidents we ever had. in the film, all he talks about is independence, but I never actually saw the real reason behind it. was he doing it for the country, for the people, or to validate his own hard work and protect his power and money.it took me almost two months to write this review because the film stayed in my mind longer than i expected. every time I tried to sit down, i ended up thinking about another scene or another line that hinted at something deeper. it’s not the kind of film you watch and forget the next day. it leaves you with questions that don’t settle right away.i kept replaying how the characters moved and how their decisions shaped everything. the more i revisited it in my head, the more i understood why it bothered me in a good way. it challenges the way we grew up seeing these men. it makes you look past the titles and medals and ask who they were when the doors were closed.",15/10/2025,positive,0.992439985,0

Quezon,"I’m a Filipino student and we were given a activity, a small film critique for my social studies class worth 20 points for the seatwork and quiz. Ironic enough, this was announced 6 days after I watched the film.When you hear the name Manuel Quezon, what comes to mind is that he was the 2nd most beloved President of the Philippines. A man who fought cases against the poor before as a lawyer, and was able to serve our country, But after watching the film I realized there was a lot more about him. I realized that Quezon wasn’t really much of a good President for his achievements. He is not really effective as a leader or able to accomplish anything for the country. But instead taking the government’s power by maneuvering to get what he wants and to establish what once was a blissful tree to a rotten egg. He was a master of playing dirty tricks to bribe the people creating conflict against his rivals causing them to get in the way of propaganda like Osmena, General Wood, and Aguinaldo. Involving the press questioning their political views on both perspectives. Another thing I noticed is that the Americans were actually trying to help the Filipinos as General Wood realized the people didn’t have proper education just from not knowing what independence means. They were helping us to establish better roads and build a proper government system for our country.The biopic not only showcases Quezon’s rise and downfall but alongside how our government is still the same until now. “I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos, rather than a country run like heaven by the Americans, because no matter how bad the Filipino government might be, it can still be improved!” To quote Manuel L. Quezon himself, sums up how our government will always run like hell unlike the Americans even though they were also cruel back then. Our independence may never be claimed, but our pride and soul can not be taken for granted. The Filipino government we have today is still running like hell from our corruption, political dynasties, and both parties fighting left and right while the poor are fighting by themselves. No matter how many people vote for a good president, we will always end up in last place as poverty devours us whole. After watching Quezon’s biopic, I realized how important education is for us and our love for everything we have in this country. What I can use from what I learned in this film as a citizen is by being civilly determined and persevering when it is already my duty to vote for the leaders of this country. That I should be a responsible voter in the future by knowing who to vote for and understanding what this stands for. Other factors that I realized to consider are self-dignity and moral values are important to look for in a leader. Patriotism can be as simple as exercising your right to vote and to vote wisely. In conclusion, despite Manuel Quezon’s search for independence and freedom for the Philippines he was unsuccessful. I say that because up to this day, our political system is naive and independence is something we have been fighting for up till this day. Independence not only from other countries colonizing us, but independence from corruption, political agendas, poverty, miseducation and political dynasties.I LOVE THE FILM SO MUCH. I’m a very big history nerd especially Philippine History so 100% recommended to any historian fan out there.

Quezon,"jericho rosales alam lang kita kasi kamukha mo aso ng kaibigan ko (this is a neutral statement, cute naman yung aso) i was so pleasantly surprised by how well you acted, consider me a fan… i had doubts with the casting at first because irl quezon was a whitewashed mestizo, the stuff of envy for self hating transracial losers on discord, but your acting really sold me, wow… 10/10 trapo moves, no wonder nagalit grandbaby ni quezon HAHA…on a more serious note, i like how this film seems to be tarrog’s way of interrogating himself as a creative, especially with the unintended effect heneral luna (2015) had on swaying the public in support of strongman personas (re: duterte in 2016)… in what ways is the filipino artist complicit in propaganda? or i guess more broadly speaking, in what ways can art and narratives be co-opted? i like that this movie invites skepticism kumbaga… may bisa nga ang kwento oo pero bisa para kanino? bisa para saan / hanggang saan? and i think that’s why i have a soft spot for it… i respect movies that encourage the audience to ask questions. timely siya, in fairness, idk kung intended ba o hindi pero ayun, relevant nga, lalo na in this second marcos presidency where historical distortion thrives precisely because the will to question narratives is being stamped out…pero speaking of narratives, i wish the power of the masses was portrayed with more depth  lalo na dahil next movie tungkol kay magsaysay, grandfather of filipino populism… i was disappointed by the scene where woods asked farmers and peasants if they were in favor of independence because it was such a shallow (and quite homogenous??) portrayal of filipino sentiments on US colonization… where are the sakdals?? where is pkp-1930?? it’s historically inaccurate to suggest that all filipinos were passive about independence!!!  and speaking of pkp… SIGHHH i really don’t have high hopes for the magsaysay movie… basic details pa nga lang sa pkp di inaayos, huks pa kaya… fact check: the movie’s english subs are wrong, pkp cannot be translated as cpp, those are two different groups… second fact check: nabong was definitely affiliated with pkp but the aglipay-nabong duo did not run under the party name pkp… they were republicans… important distinction because since when tf was pkp ever allowed on the same playing field as quezon’s nacionalistas?? also since we’re already ranting tarrog do NOOOOOTTT try to sympathy bait me with aguinaldo’s flop campaign parade i will never extend sympathy for him i know for a fact that that loser was a collaborator for jpn during ww2 HE HAS NO LOYALTY FOR THE FILIPINO PEOPLE YOU CAN’T FOOL ME ",04/11/2025,positive,0.977038562,0
Quezon,"After   and :   , TBA Studios and director Jerrold Tarog closes the BayaniVerse trilogy with '' — a film that trades the sound of gunfire for the noise of politics, but still burns with the same intensity.It’s not a war of soldiers this time, but a war of ideals, egos, and ambitions — fought in meetings, elections, and through the public eye.Jericho Rosales gives a career-defining performance as Manuel L. Quezon. You can tell he studied Quezon’s mannerisms down to the smallest gesture — the posture, the pauses, even the rhythm of his voice. His portrayal balances elegance with cunning charm, showing us both the gentleman, the strategist, the patriot, and the politician.The film’s structure is bold and stylish — divided into four chapters, each framed like a “V” (versus) battle, pitting Quezon against different political and historical figures of his time, accompanied by a subtitle based on dialogues in each chapter. It feels very Snyder Cut in its presentation — grand, deliberate, and unapologetically significant. The fourth chapter, the longest one, brings everything to a dramatic and climactic close that feels inevitable and tragic.Mon Confiado returns as Emilio Aguinaldo, and once again, he commands attention. His portrayal of a president haunted by legacy and resentment is one of his best performances yet. His dialogues, essentially saying that he did everything he could for the Filipinos, echo with pride and regret.It’s still surreal to see Game of Thrones veteran Iain Glen as Governor-General Leonard Wood, but even in his few minutes onscreen, he leaves a strong impression with his performance. Romnick Sarmenta also deserves praise for his controlled and weighty take on Sergio Osmeña, grounding every scene he’s in.The film cleverly incorporates black-and-white silent film sequences, serving as historical vignettes and mirrors of Quezon’s inner world. They show us the contrast between the public image and private intentions. Even more playful are Benjamin Alves and Aaron Villaflor playing not only as the younger versions of Quezon and Joven Hernando in flashbacks but also as actors in those silent films.Karylle shines as Aurora Quezon, bringing class, grace, and quiet strength to her role as a partner who understands the weight of her husband’s ambition. Meanwhile, Joross Gamboa may be new to the BayaniVerse, stepping into the role of the recast Eduardo Rusca. But he still feels right at home in this trilogy, proving his versatility in dramatic territory.'' is, without a doubt, the most political film in the trilogy. While its predecessors dealt with wars and heroism through action and tragedy, this movie unfolds during the Commonwealth election era, where battles are fought through speeches, alliances, and betrayals. Tarog turns politics into theater, and every act has consequences.If I were to rank all three BayaniVerse films:Heneral LunaQuezonGoyo: Ang Batang HeneralAnd yeah, this movie may have lacked action compared to its predecessors, and some might find the pacing slow or the dialogue too heavy-structured, but that’s where its strength also lies. The movie challenges us to listen, read between the lines, and confront the truth that leadership often lives in the grey area between heroism and hypocrisy.What makes this linger isn’t a rousing battle cry, but a haunting reflection:       ,          —    ?Still, '' stands tall as a worthy conclusion to the BayaniVerse, both grand in scope, rich in detail, and haunting in its honesty about power and nationhood. And yes, stay for the end-credit scene — whether it truly closes the saga or hints at something beyond, it’s the vague ending that leaves you proud, curious, and reflective all at once.In the end, Tarog doesn’t just tell us who Manuel L. Quezon was — he shows us the kind of leader widely regarded as one of the most significant figures in Philippine history.With that being said, I’m going to give this movie…8/10!

Quezon,"Hell week is over, so I can finally write my recent movie reviews. Let's start with the movie I watched in the cinema this November: Quezon (2025)At first, I had no idea kung paano ang takbo ng kwento, but I've heard and we tackled it with one of our lesson sa ArtApp where we talked about the Art and Society, Art and Politics. Since then, I was curious about how the movie portrayed Quezon, and how his administration affected the Philippines. I'm glad to have a chance to see it in the theater, it was a different experience. This will be long as I did my research a while ago after watching it kasi as someone who is not that literate with the politics, it can be confusing. Pero, it gave me an opportunity to look at the history myself. Quezon Vs. OsmeñaDuring his time, hindi lang Americans ang kalaban ni Quezon. May mga kapwa Pilipino siya na may ibang idea para sa bansa. Hindi na kalaban from outside, but someone beside him. Quezon and Osmeña were both brilliant, but their visions didn’t always match. Their rivalry wasn’t about hatred. It was about direction. Who can lead the nation better? Which path will bring Filipinos closer to independence? Historically, after passing the Jones Law, Quezon became Senate President, pero kasama niya noon si Sergio Osmeña bilang Speaker of the House. May ideology clash sa pagitan nila. Osmeña was more open to gradual transition, maybe compromises. Pero si Quezon gusto ng mas klarong direksyon sa independence. Dumating yung time na naglatag ng Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act, batas na may planong bigyan ang Pilipinas ng independence pero may mga kondisyon tulad nung retention ng US military bases. Si Osmeña sumuporta, pero si Quezon tumutol, gusto niya tunay na kalayaan. Pinamunuan niya yung campaign para i-reject ang HHC at gumawa ng mas maayos na plano. This eventually led to the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934, which set up a 10-year transition period toward independence. Nagkaayos sila para sa 1935 election: Quezon bilang President, Osmeña Vice-President. Nanalo sila at nagsimula ang Commonwealth.It is a fact na nag-advance ang pilipinas during his term pero some elites benefited more than the common people, so the effects weren’t evenly felt. Basically, Quezon’s leadership advanced the country on paper and at the top levels, pero hindi lahat nakaramdam ng pagbabago sa araw-araw nilang buhay.Quezon Vs. WoodThere's this Wood’s mission sa Pilipinas, na tinawag na Wood–Forbes Mission, sent by the U.S. para i-assess kung ready na ba ang bansa for independence. Sila ni Forbes literally inikot ang halos lahat ng provinces, tiningnan yung governance, economy, education, at social conditions. Ang conclusion nila? Marami pang Pilipino hindi pa ready mag-govern on their own.At sa totoo lang, hindi sila totally mali. Marami sa mga pilipino noon lalo na ang mga pilipinong walang access sa edukasyon na hindi talaga alam kung ano ang ibig sabihin ng kalayaan. May scene doon sa movie inikot ni Wood yung mga baryo at tinanong ang mga tao tungkol sa freedom, may isang farmer na sumagot, “Masarap,” kasi akala niya ang kalayaan ay pagkain lang. It is sad but it's true na ang mga tao ay madalas na focus sa araw-araw nilang buhay, lalo na kung paano makakapag-hain ng pagkain sa kanilang hapag-kainan (wow, lalim). Kaya natural na naging skeptical si Wood sa kakayahan ng mga Pilipino na mag-govern.Kahit sa mga elite, may problema rin. Maraming local leaders yung mas interesado sa sariling kapangyarihan at personal gain na kaysa sa long-term good ng bansa. Madali silang magpadala sa opportunism, kaya minsan hindi sila sumusuporta sa reforms. Dahil don, kahit nakapagtayo si Quezon ng institutions at frameworks, hindi pantay yung epekto sa ordinaryong tao katulad ng mga magsasaka, mas nakinabang ang mga elite, habang karamihan ng masa stuck sa poverty, limitadong edukasyon, at lupa.Quezon Vs. AguinaldoThis part builds the tension gradually. I LOVEEE ITTT! The soundtrack, the camera work, everything! Makikita doon sa 1935 presidential campaign ni Aguinaldo. Kasama niya yung supposed VP niya, pero compared sa massive support ni Quezon, maliit lang yung entourage. Low-budget, few supporters, at sa maliit na pagtitipon lang, Di katulad kay Quezon, nasa sasakyan, maraming supporters, parang festival. Sa isang scene, pinapaalis siya sa lugar (hindi ko matandaan kung saan), tapos sinabi niya na hindi na siya babalik. Eto parang dramatization nalang, pero historical fact na natalo talaga siya ng malaki kasi Quezon got around 68% ng vote, habang Aguinaldo less than 20%. It's a matter of nationalism vs. new governance ni quezon.""Wala kayong utang na loob.""Controversial si Aguinaldo dahil sa mga paratang na involved siya sa deaths ni Andrés Bonifacio at Antonio Luna. After Tejeros Convention noong 1897, na-execute si Bonifacio at yung kapatid niya. Maraming sources ang nagsasabi na in-approve ni Aguinaldo yung order, sabi niya “for the sake of the country.” Later, si Luna naman na-lure sa meeting sa Cabanatuan at pinatay; may mga historians na tinutukoy yung telegram ni Aguinaldo bilang evidence na posibleng siya ang nag-orchestrate. Hindi lahat malinaw, pero malinaw na messy ang Filipino politics noon, halo-halo ang power, loyalty, at personal ambition.Aguinaldo could have humiliated Quezon by bringing up personal matters, pero hindi niya ginawa. Quezon won, became first president of the Commonwealth, and set up the all-Filipino cabinet. He tried reforms like the Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933, pero marami ang nagsasabi na hindi daw ito effective kasi controlled pa rin ng landlords ang local politics, kaya maraming peasants ang naiwan sa kahirapan.Quezon Vs. JovenFictional siya, I know. Pero, joven served as the eyes ng audience. Sa simula, nung nakita niya si Quezon sa boat, hopeful pa siya, baka this person is really the way to change. Simple pa yung pananaw niya noon, hero si Quezon, clear ang moral compass, he's a good person.Pero habang lumalalim yung kwento, habang mas nalalaman niya yung political struggles, nagbabago rin yung tingin niya. Nakikita niya yung tension kay Osmeña, kay Aguinaldo, pati sa mga pilipino. Kapag titignan mo, mas naiintindihan mo yung history, hindi na pure heroes and villains ang nakikita mo. People have their own agendas, limits, at minsan kailangan gumawa ng “dirty work” para maabot yung goals nila.Nakikita rin natin kung paano yung utang na loob, loyalty, at personal connections gumagawa ng ripple effects sa buong political system, at paano siya nakakaapekto sa mga ordinaryong pilipino.Overall, through technical, I love the cinematography, yung color theory na ginamit nila, yung soundtrack and everything. I love movies like this, and I'm looking forward for the next Bayaniverse ni Tarog, which I think is Magsaysay? Yay, the best president of the Philippines.",09/11/2025,positive,0.916704476,0
Quezon,"Throughout the ""Bayaniverse"" trilogy we see through the eyes of the fictitious journalist Joven Hernando as he witnesses the rise and fall of the national hero, and of himself. We share his naivete in ""Heneral Luna"", his awakening in ""Goyo"", and finally his hypocrisy in ""Quezon"".The character of Joven stands in as the Filipino people, whose principles waver at the sight of precious opportunity and promise. Joven has never fully let go of his tendency to idolize the man behind the power, his attachment to such figures taught him less to be wary of following their footsteps and taught him more of their machinations and how he could benefit from it all, only to be ultimately discarded after falling victim to the schemes of the ""hero"" he betrayed his principles for.Like Joven, we are complicit in the ills of our country by our own inaction and tolerance. It is much worse of a sin that we choose to close our eyes even if we have already seen the truth. We have the resources, the history, and the privilege of correcting our mistakes but why do we remain stubborn? We realize our own hypocrisy only when inconvenience has caught up to us.",25/11/2025,positive,0.826033056,0

Quezon,"i watched this a long time ago but i’m only reviewing it now because i have been trying to gather my very conflicting thoughts on it… alas, i still have not finished doing that but this review is long overdue.i think it’s an enjoyable movie but there were some times where the film—i’m not sure whether intentionally ur unintentionally—romanticizes certain figures that shouldn’t be romanticized at all, and in turn the audience for this film did exactly that. ironically, at the same time this film also tried to paint the figures in a bad light, and that’s exactly where the lines start to blur to the point you don’t know what the movie is trying to say anymore.i know this comes off as “that one friend who’s too woke”, but this is the best i can articulate my icky feelings toward this movie right now. in general, i do not think it had a good impact—it had a good concept, but ultimately i do not think it delivered a point at all.this review shares my sentiments quite well.",22/11/2025,positive,0.560292661,0
Quezon,"I get why the Quezon family might not love this.But honestly, that’s exactly what Gerald Tarog has been building toward since Heneral Luna and Goyo. The trilogy isn’t just about flawed heroes; it’s about a nation that has never been fully ready. Heroes rise because the people, the institutions, the country aren’t prepared to carry themselves. And Quezon leans into that idea.The film asks: What does independence even mean when you’re young as a nation and surrounded by bigger geopolitical forces? Here, politics is spectacle. Everyone is performing, maneuvering, managing appearances. It’s less “be angry” like Luna, and less “blind obedience” like Goyo. It simply shows you that everyone—from local elites to foreign powers—is taking us for a ride. And Quezon, in this telling, becomes a product of that pressure. Not a saint, not a villain—just someone doing what the moment required.What fascinated me was how consistent Aguinaldo is across all three films. You didn’t like him before, but here you can finally sympathize. The cast is strong, and the historical texture is rich.My issues are mostly structural. Since this is a biographical piece, the core tension is softer—alam mo na where it ends, alam mo na he becomes a hero, alam mo na we get independence. So the pacing won’t land for everyone. Luna worked because it tapped into a collective anger at a very specific time. Here, the emotional punch is more muted, more contemplative. I get why Tarog didn’t turn this into an activist film per se, but that choice also holds the film back from being as explosive as the first.Still, as a trilogy capstone, it’s thoughtful and well-acted. I admire the ambition, even if this one didn’t hit me as hard as the earlier entries.",22/11/2025,positive,0.943159223,0

Quezon,"While Heneral Luna showed the good and the bad of public service, Quezon showed the good and the bad of politics. It prioritized storytelling than historical accuracy, and there are a few times that that bias didn't work, specifically with their portrayal of Aguinaldo. It prioritized dialog over cinematography, and weirdly enough is as witty as Heneral Luna but without the stunning establishing shots. While it is not a 100% historically accurate movie, I highly recommend this film to those who think Manuel Luis Quezon is just the ""Father of the Filipino Language"", as its overall portrayal of him is a flawed politician that had the independence as his goal, but wants to save the Philippines on his own selfish terms.",22/11/2025,positive,0.967844486,0

Quezon,"I consider myself a history nerd and i love movies (obv), so getting to watch this masterpiece alone was a two-birds-in-one-stone situation.Disclaimer: this particular part of history isn't my specialty/fixation, this review is based on the movie direction. As for historical accuracy, would probably need to read up on it again.Firstly, my fav thing about this one was camera work. Props to Pong Ignacio for the brilliant shots (apparently he also worked for the director's other Bayaniverse films which is interestinggg). Secondly, the cinematography (still Ignacio) mmmm chef's kiss. Noticed this especially in wide shots and during the parallel campaign scenes between Aguinaldo and Quezon, where the color grading for Quezon's POV was bright and colorful while Aguinaldo's POV turned into this vintage dull tone that contrasted both of their character progressions/regressions.As a fan of arthouse films, where the direction of the storyline isn't really straightforward, absolutely loved the experimental storytelling which switches back and forth between Joven, Rusca, and Nadia watching the ""films"" as a narration guide then back to the actual events that happen. Found that very compelling. A scene I found rly funny (probs one of my favorites) was when Quezon and Joven bantered about Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Philosophy, and Ethics plsss (bc I get it help).Another fav abt the film was the score, especially in particular the one when Aguinaldo stood and walked towards the stage to give his speech during the 1935 elections scene, should've had a longer exposure hhhhTo summarize, I love how this depiction on one of the most notable ""National Heroes"" of the country serves as a critique to the twisted side of the road to the nation's independence and political power plays at the time that led up to world war ii. While there were a few things that irked me (won't spoil), loved Tarog's vision on this.(Also, Iain Glen aka Jorah Mormont in GOT and Batman in DC's Titans was here.

Supporting cast elevates every scene—no weak links, just ensemble excellence the film blurs reality and dramatization with reckless confidence—some scenes feel more myth than memory pacing wobbles in act two, indulging in grandeur over grit—some sequences feel like prestige filler the final act leans hard into legacy-building, sacrificing ambiguity for cinematic sainthoodfavorite scene: the debate was fire—but Quezon’s first wife showing up?

Quezon,"This was such a great movie. I’d rewatch it again once it’s on streaming platforms. It was really such an eyeopener that Quezon wasn’t really that good as a president even though it was for a good intent. You could really only win in politics if you play dirty with the others. This movie also made me realize that some facts about Quezon were just glossed over in schools.

I would say he plays a hand at why the government is the way it is today. Jericho Rosales did a really great job — from the accent to the slight mannerisms (all of which I am not sure if accurate but it made MLQ more real) I would say tho: the music mixing absolutely SUCKS ASS. Wow. It was so loud at some portions and so hard to hear in some. Before we went in, we overheard an older gentleman say that the sound was too loud, and I chalked it up to maybe he’s older that’s why. BUT HE WAS NOT WRONG. I hated the mixing, truly. It caused my rating to go down a full star and a half. The non-linear story telling would have worked for me, had it not been the “silent film” within the film treatement. It was more annoying to watch, than it was amusing. One thing’s for sure, the movie inspired me to go down a rabbit hole on MLQ and Sergio Osmeña, whose love-hate relationship was just truly so entertaining to watch.

Quezon,"Quezon is ambitious, centered on the dramatic rise and political maneuverings of Manuel L. Quezon, bringing into focus both his leadership and the moral complexities that come with power. Directed by Jerrold Tarog and starring Jericho Rosales, the film shows serious craft—period details, strong performances, and a desire to tell a sweeping national story. That said, while the intent is noble and the scale impressive, the film sometimes feels uneven—its pacing can feel heavy with exposition, and certain character arcs or motivations don’t always land with the emotional clarity you'd hope for.

Quezon,The humor of the entire film perfectly depicts Quezon's puppet government. The government of 1920s is just the same with the current one. Philippines is a circus and we never learn from it as we continue to masturbate for the elites. ,01/11/2025,positive,0.809981585,0
Quezon,"At its core, I found that the movie reflected my frustration in both the spectacle of political power plays, and the intellectual, moral decay of those who now hold the reins of government. Contemporary politicians—our so-called trapos—-have devolved into near-cartoonish figures: one-dimensional villains who plunder public funds, inherit their influence, and contribute little to the nation beyond perpetuating their dynastic entitlement. In comparison to Quezon, whose brilliance was matched by his ambition and corruption in equal measure, today’s leaders lack both vision and complexity. For all his duplicity, Quezon established systems that tangibly benefitted the poor in some ways, and he did grant us some period of independence (though that’s still debated). One cannot form a fixed opinion of him, for his legacy is both admirable and reprehensible. In this regard, Quezon (2025) mirrors its subject: difficult to pin down, simultaneously compelling and shallow. The film dramatizes power and corruption effectively, and inevitably tugs at the viewer’s frustration given the state of current politics. Yet it often flattens the historical depth of Quezon’s time, reducing the struggle for independence and the weight of colonial subjugation into a tale of political maneuvering. The controversy surrounding Quezon’s grandson’s reaction at the film’s premiere only reinforces the persistence of the Great Man myth, the impulse to sanctify flawed figures rather than confront their contradictions. While the Bayaniverse in general deconstructs this narrative, I think Quezon (2025) only partially succeeds. What emerges instead is a reflection of both the man and the nation: brilliant in flashes, compromised in execution, and perpetually caught between reverence and disillusionment.",11/11/2025,positive,0.609651864,0

Quezon,"First, QuezMena is real. This movie feels like both an ending and a beginning. For me, Quezon isn’t “bayani enough” to close this trilogy; he’s more like the start of what could be a pangulo-verse.Quezon is a master player in politics. The appointment game scene is one of my favorites because it shows how Quezon skillfully maneuvers people and the government itself. His ambition, driven by greed and power, is disturbing, yet Jericho Rosales portrayed it so convincingly that I couldn’t look away! ampogi. Quezon is selfish and trapo, and that’s what makes him believable. He mirrors the very kind of politics we see today, shifting how leadership and power are perceived in our system.I also liked how Joven became aware of what was really happening. He refused to be swayed again and stood firm in what he believed in. The two-hour film gave justice to how this trilogy ends. My favorite part is when Quezon said that being a hero is all about perception. That line sums up the whole point of the movie: that history and heroism depend on how we choose to see them and we create heroes in our likeness.",06/11/2025,positive,0.978359938,0

Clever and gripping, Jericho Rosales gives a larger than life portrayal of MLQ.Don't love how the movie turns Wood into a tired old man who just wants to be done with the mess that is the Philippines. It almost feels white man's burden-y, even worse when the Bud Dajo Massacre that he led is relegated to a throwaway line at the beginning then never mentioned again.As an analysis of Quezon the man and the long, long line of trapos that (figuratively) descend from him, it's above average. Not the ending though, where it feels like the writers forgot to weave in the patronage politics and capitalism commentary and threw it all in while they still could.To end, Quezmeña real.",08/11/2025,positive,0.988896608,0

Quezon,"10/10 = MASTERPIECE I didn’t expect this film to affect me the way it did. I thought I was ready, that it would simply be another historical piece about a man I’ve always admired. Instead, it left me still and uncertain, as if it reached into what I believed and rearranged it. It has been a long time since a film made me feel this kind of quiet turmoil.I have always seen Quezon as one of the strongest figures in our history. I saw him as a leader who carried both intellect and heart, a man who stood for what the Filipino could be. Watching this version of him felt painful. The film showed a Quezon who was cold, distant, even cruel at times. I disagreed with it deeply. Yet I could not turn away. It felt honest in its discomfort, as if the film was reminding me that greatness is never pure and that power often leaves scars no one else can see.I kept trying to defend him in my mind, to separate the man from the portrayal, but I realized that was the experience the film wanted me to have. It wanted me to struggle with the idea of Quezon himself. It wanted me to feel both admiration and doubt. That inner tension became the most human thing about the entire experience.When the credits rolled, I just sat there. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even think clearly. It reminded me how rare it is for a film to make me pause, to make me reflect not just on history but on the kind of leaders and ideals I believe in. It left me unsettled, but it also left me grateful.I still believe in Manuel Luis Quezon. I still see him as one of our greatest. Yet this film made me look at him again with clearer eyes. It made me realize that true admiration accepts flaws, questions myths, and still chooses to understand. That realization is what stays with me.Quezon (2025) gave me confusion, pain, and awe all at once. It made me think harder about pride, power, and the weight of building a nation. It is not an easy film to love, but it is a necessary one. And for me, that makes it a masterpiece.All the discomfort, all the challenge, all the awe I felt comes together in one simple truth. The film made me feel something that reminded me why I love history, leadership, politics, and philosophy.",10/11/2025,positive,0.985719025,0
Quezon,"Quezon at Osmeña RETRO BLpinayflix finds: ""20 pesos at 50 pesos nauwi sa alam niyo na"" ""Ah, banal-banalan kang burat ka !"" isa sa linya ni Quezon sa pelikula, pero sa totoong buhay, ito ang sigaw ng lahat sa mga uhaw sa kapangyarihan pero bulag sa bayan. Pag nanonood ka, akala mo nakikinig ka lang sa mga balita ngayon. Parang bawat eksena sa Quezon, bawat debate, bawat campaign parade — ay hindi na bago sa atin, dahil nangyayari ito sa totoong buhay. Ang mga salita, galaw, at taktika ng mga nasa kapangyarihan ay paulit-ulit, predictably corrupt, at puro palabas lang.Ika nga nila, ""Ang magulong bayan ay salamin ng magulong politika."" Hanggang ngayon, hindi naglalaho at patuloy pa rin na umiikot sa ating realidad. Sa palabas na ito, ipinakita kung gaano kadumi ang politika: nakakasuka, nakakagalit, nakakatakot. Pero alam naman nating lahat, it’s just the tip of the iceberg. Mas nakakatakot pa, dahil hanggang ngayon, wala pa ring tunay na pagbabago, at wala pa ring nakukulong. Ang ganda rin ng portrayal ng mga journalist — ipinakita kung paano sila naging mata’t tainga ng bayan. Nakakalungkot lang isipin na may ilan sa panahon ngayon na nagpapadala sa impluwensya, nagpapabayad, o nagpapagamit. Pero naniniwala akong mas marami pa ring tulad ni Joven — mga taong marunong magbago ng paniniwala para sa mas mabuti, marunong mamulat, at may tapang tumindig sa katotohanan. Bukod sa journalists, binigyan din ng pansin ang mga filmmakers. Ang pelikula ni Nadia ay simbolo kung paano naaapektuhan ang opinyon ng publiko sa bisa ng mahusay na kwento. Madaling maimpluwensiyahan ng propaganda, political ads, o social media narratives.Sa trilogy, masasabi kong ito ang paborito ko. May halong sarcasm pero masaya ang paraan ng pagkukwento. Isa sa pinakanagustuhan ko ang campaign scene — maliwanag at parang pista, pero sa kabila, naroon ang lungkot at muted na kulay, na parang isang funeral.Sa huli, napanood natin ang sinasabi ni Quezon na ""hindi natin mapanonood"" — parang ang tingin niya, habang buhay ay matatago ang baho ng pabango. Marami sa mga politiko ngayon ay ganoon din: puno ng palabas, sakim sa kapangyarihan, at bulag sa pangangailangan ng bayan. Para sa akin, hakbang na ito para mas mamulat at lumawak ang pananaw ng mga Pilipino. Nakakatuwa dahil hindi lang siya pangalan sa history books; nabigyan siya ng boses, ng puso, at ng karakter. Ang pelikulang ito ay magsisilbi bilang paalala ng paulit-ulit na dumi at kasinungalingan. Pero sa huli, nananatili ang katotohanan sa mata ng mga nakasubaybay at mulat.",15/10/2025,negative,0.686103523,1

Quezon,"the good:- i like na hindi nila binigyan masyado ng nuance si quezon dito. all throughout he’s just this cunning and ruthless asshole who happens to be the president and a senate president before that. we’ve seen countless pieces of media na pinapakita mabubuti niyang ginawa at niroromanticize buhay niya so it was very refreshing to see jericho’s version of quezon na masama ugali all throughout yet he never came across as shallow and one note. no art is meant to be isolated in vacuum so by placing it with another like the quezon movie prior to this gives you a fuller picture of who quezon is, even when theyre not entirely accurate.- was taken aback by how playful and satirical the movie’s tone was considering that it’s supposed to conclude the bayaniverse trilogy. galing. fave ko yung silent movie scenes grabe kuhang kuha yung blocking acting score at makeup! also works really well as a narrative device and cleverly points out how ridiculous quezon can be. - gusto ko yung movement ng camera it really made the movie entertaining- fave line: hindi ako kulangot wag mo kong binibilog!the bad and the ugly: - why remove the sakdalistas? gets na this is a movie about larger than life historical figures but the sakdalistas were popular enough to win a seat in the congress so bakit wala sila sa movie? the whole movie is structured around who quezon is going up against at different points in his political career so it would’ve been the perfect opportunity to explore the perspective of the masses and could have made the ending/message stronger but ok whatever. including the sakdalistas in the story could’ve shown a different side of quezon—one that was insecure enough to actually sabotage figures who are way less powerful than him even when he was already the commonwealth president- why portray filipinos as ignorant/unlearned when it comes to independence? that was the only time na may representation ang ordinaryong pilipino na nagsisilbi ring stand in for the audience tapos in that scene they chose to depict filipinos as mangmang na hindi alam kung ano pinaglalaban nila e kung tutuusin sila na nga yung nakarealize early on that independence should be achieved immediately hindi katulad ng filipino elite noon na kumapit pa rin sa colonial forces and chose delayed independence because they didnt wanna lose their privileges yet - not enough hate for the other key players. not enough hate for aguinaldo (but its okay bc we have luna movie and goyo movie to compensate for the lack of aguinaldo hate) but what bothers me the most is that there’s not enough hate for wood. leonard wood is depicted as this diplomatic and level headed guy who just wants to do his job so he can go home even though historical accounts say otherwise because he’s anti filipino, and orchestrated the massacre in bud dajo, etc. at the end of the day, mananakop siya na ang tingin sa mga pilipino ay mangmang na kailangan ng colonial intervention. ang mga amerikano din naman ang naginstitutionalize ng padrino system and the filipino elite just took advantage of it so why are they making it seem that quezon was the one who established such system? the issue isn’t about the movie omitting or adding events for creative purposes (it's a movie after all), the problem lies with the larger picture it ends up painting by taking those liberties and to me it just reeks american propaganda and i dont think the movie is aware of that. i know this is about quezon, i know this is a satire, pero kailangan ba si quezon lang yung ivivillainize/satirize? pagvillainize kay quezon gusto pagvillainize sa mga kano ayaw? eme- ewan andami ko ring issues pa like di convincing for me yung relationship ni joven at quezon and yung eventual split nila, yung over sa exposition na dialogue tipong subtext nawawala kasi lahat laid out na for you through dialogue, etc.",05/11/2025,positive,0.918555796,0

Quezon,"Ang panonood ng ""Quezon"" ay parehong pakiramdam ng pakikinig sa isang kakilalang naglalarawan sa isang taong nakadaumpalad mo na, ngunit hindi pa lubos na nakikilala. Kaya matapos makinig sa mga kuwento, may responsibilidad na kilalanin pa nang husto ang taong iyon sa kung anumang layuning mahalaga para sa iyo.Ang panganib lang dito ay kung paano tatanggapin ng nakinig: maniniwala agad-agad o aalamin muna ang kabuuang konteksto.Sa Araling Panlipunan/Sibika, limitado ang pagpapakilala kay Quezon. Kaya kung gagamitin itong pangunahing materyal ng DepEd at literal na bibigyang-interpretasyon, mayroong tendensiyang matuon sa ""sensationalism"" ang talakayan.Ngunit gayundin, magandang ipinakita ang kabuuang karakterisasyon ni Quezon at kung paano siya naging biktima rin ng sistema ng politika sa panahon ng pananakop ng mga Amerikano. Gayunpaman, sa personal kong opinyon, nakulangan ako sa pagpapakita kung paano tinawid ni Quezon ang grey areas--sa pelikula, tumatawid lamang si Quezon sa itim o sa puti. Kung maipakikita sana ang bigat ng pagkaipit sa sistema at pagpili na lamang sa ""lesser evil"", mas naging balanse at nagkaroon ng dagdag na layers ang kaniyang tauhan.Nakakabahala rin ang idea na mula pa noon ay umiiral na ang parehong maruruming taktika sa politika. Na parang ang pelikula ay direktang salamin ng kasalukuyang lagay ng politika sa bansa.Super like: Pagganap ni Jericho at ang acting ensemble. Karakter ni Nadia.

Quezon,"Honestly before watching the film I got a bit skeptical, not because of the relative's reaction rather, of how his death is going to be depicted - as most stories of ""Bayani"" ends with an abrupt bullet or a machete to the body (about 50 times). I vividly remember reading that he once gave his SONA in a hospital bed in Washington DC because he was fighting TB. While he often had that shiny 20-peso bill image to him, reading books like Nick Joaquin's A Question of Heroes (which this film takes inspiration) suggests a more open to interpretation viewpoint of the politician-statesman. You can write a persuasive essay about it, honestly, and your highschool AP teacher would probably applaud you by choosing either depictions and look at the complexities of the human character and the political environment he had to deal with. Going back to the ending though, you can very much understand the backlash because it really leaned into the creative side of the narrative. But I kinda like it because its a fun thought to have; if MLQ didnt get sick, what would he have done more as his legacy? Depicted as the savvy, charming, trickster of a politician playing ""the game of politics"" and always trying to get the upper hand on people, I'd like to think that he would've been similar to how Lee Kuan Yew did for Singapore. Similar in character in a lot of ways and tickling his way to almost authoritarian (competitive authoritarianism, that is). At least with the way how the film depicted it. ""I am the Philippines"" is definitely a bold line to say, but probably not too far off. And the line about ""Quezon may not have invented the game, but he sure damn played it well"" describes the character perfectly.The film is actually the commentary of Jerold Tarog, the director. He questions Manolo's morality and character because that's how we all should look at historical figures. I remember when Luna came out, everyone was preaching his machismo, especially at the height of Dutertismo. But Tarog probably saw the bad effects of the film and tell us: ""Hey, don't worship our heroes."" Funny how the film mocks the audience for incorporating the silent film-slide show scenes at points, as if they're trying to tell you ""this is how most people probably would've made this film: prim, proper, textbook-like, 'here's all the key highlights of his life and the good he's done, and then he died."" Rather, they chose to depict that complex, imperfect, flawed character that I would've been more interested in watching. He's never meant to be seen as a martyr. He's a historical figure, a real person. Is it 100% accurate? I don't know, ask your history teacher. Was it fun to watch? Was the acting great? More importantly, was the film good? All points to: Yes. Yes it was. Last note: MLQ III is right. The film is a horror story about corruption of power, the state of politics today, and the trajectory of Philippine politics from that point on.

Quezon,"fascinating film. clear eyed on its mission on dissecting how we got here and how we're still stuck here but I don't really think it does enough to condemn the actual system (capitalism and colonialism) that allows for the rise of populists. What I got most from this is I think Tarog is frustrated by the success of Luna and how it led us even just a tiny bit to electing the kind of person he warns us with in this film (TWICE IN A ROW, this god forsaken country man) given how much the framing device of this is about an alternate cut of what are essentially propaganda films. I think these films are really about the disillusionment of a man may it be Joven or Tarog himself in the Filipino project while I think it's valid (and I do share the sentiment a lot of the time) I don't really know if it's the sentiment we need in this moment considering his ideals about reviving the idea of national mythmaking through Philippine cinema. I hope people take something else from here other than, oh all politicians are the same and it is what it is, I hope they at least realize that the powers that be are fallible (Quezon eventually runs out of time) and that we see through their bullshit and that populists are really fucking bad for ""freedom"" and that we should get rid of them by hook or by crook although the film doesn't really go there because history didn't go there. Overall it's fascinating stuff. Really loved how propulsive his direction and editing are, the energy of this thing is just really great. The performances are impeccable and I didn't know Rosales had something like this in him.",08/11/2025,positive,0.996209264,0
Quezon,"Possibly one of my most engaging watches this year. Instead of picking up from where Goyo and Heneral Luna left off, Quezon abandons the tragic hero's tale of its predecessors and instead explores, for lack of a better word, its titular character's descent into madness and depravity. It's less a biopic and more of a character study that relishes in the drama of its narrative without needing to wink and nudge at the viewer. There's a lot of standout performances here, but Iain Glen, Romnick Sarmiento, and Jericho Rosales really stand head and shoulders above the rest in a very talented cast. Glen and Sarmiento especially bring a lot to their characters' tables with microexpressions that elevate already stellar performances. Sarmiento's facial expressions by themselves are strong enough to constitute dialogue. Rosales, meanwhile, really puts the larger-than-life aspects of the titular character at the forefront of his performance and just exudes the kind of charisma you would expect a man like Quezon to have. As much as I would've liked to see what TJ Trinidad would've done with the role had he not been replaced, it's hard to see how anyone other than Rosales was the best choice.On top of that, the movie pulls very little back in the way of punches. Very few characters are portrayed in a positive manner and it's the clashes between these strong personalities that make this picture so interesting to me. The film also uses these clashes as a Trojan horse for some scathing social commentary that, while on-the-nose, hardly ever crosses the line of being egregious or preachy.The visual and stylistic homages to Fritz Lang's works, especially, were the cherry on top for me.

Quezon,"It’s been a big year for Philippine cinema, and what could make it even bigger than a film about politics and power? Quezon dives deep into Manuel L. Quezon — his legacy, his triumphs, and all his mess and contradictions. The film portrays him as charming and eloquent, a political game player, and manipulative at times — without ever romanticizing him. It’s insane how the political landscape back then mirrors so much of what we still see today. The film serves as a fascinating tribute to one of the country’s most dominant and complex figures.The cinematography and editing are stunning. It's an ambitious step forward for Philippine cinema and a huge achievement in craft. The script, dialogue, and even the incorporation of silent film techniques beautifully capture the era. The acting is top-notch. Jericho Rosales, Romnick Sarmenta, and Mon Confiado delivered powerful performances!Overall, Quezon offers a sharp, compelling glimpse into the man behind the myth while holding a mirror to our present-day politics. It’s timely, daring, and deeply resonant. People really need to see this. What a great film.",07/11/2025,positive,0.997046411,0
Quezon,"This film for me is such a refresher because unlike the previous films about MLQ, it challenges the pedestal that he has been put on, which I believe is essential when we discuss important figures in our history. I think a lot of us (myself included) often fall into the trap of patronizing our heroes to the point that we romanticize them through the legacies that they have built. This was very much true for me, specifically with Heneral Luna (Naalala ko grabe yung galit ko kay Aguinaldo nung una kong napanood yung Heneral Luna na movie hahaha).While some may see this film as overtly negative and borderline slanderous against MLQ, I see it as a way to challenge the longstanding beliefs and notions regarding him. It pushes people to rethink our history, to be more critical, and to ask questions about what really happened in the past.And of course, the biggest elephant of them all is the connection between the past and the present. This is not just a historical film; it is also a social commentary about the current political climate we have right now. We can make the analogy of how the things from the past never really changed up to the present day. It merely evolved, adapted, and thrived. It persisted because the people in power willed it so.Going back to the film, we can also see how the concept utang na loob played a big part in ultimately shaping MLQ’s politicking. How it was first used on him and eventually, how he used this to take the reigns of our country.“You either die young as a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”In essence, MLQ wouldn’t have survived that long in the landscape of Philippine politics had he not conformed to the games being played on the floors of its administration. His good intentions, as genuine as it might have been when he first started, nevertheless was inevitably consumed by the environment he was in. Truly, it was a world of “eat or be eaten”.",03/11/2025,positive,0.936527491,0

Quezon,"We were supposed to do this at Amazon but what happened happened. Despite everything I’m lucky to have read three drafts of this and a treatment of what would have been its structure were it a series, and came in to the theater just to marvel at how Jerrold would pull this off. He pulled this off wonderfully, of course, with humor and aplomb. The script wasn’t as funny as it turned out to be on the screen, and kudos to Jerrold for seeing our government for the farce it is. Seeing Jericho play Quezon initially felt put on, but by the end you believe he’s the living, breathing embodiment of the 50 peso bill. Cris Villanueva puts some weight and character into the everpresent Joven. Jorah Mormont is a great Leonard Wood despite the accent. Karylle is always great and is missed on the big screen (follow her on Letterboxd). I really love Romnick as Roxas. And our dear beloved Mon Confiado, the survivor of the trilogy, plays Emilio Aguinaldo as the same person with the fire behind his eyes fully extinguished. It’s a painful portrayal, and will make you feel bad about all his shenanigans from the prior two films. End of the day I’m just grateful that during this time, what feels like such a low point for Philippine cinema, Jerrold continues to create his films about our flawed history, filled with stories of deluded strongmen, inexperienced boy generals and manipulative power players. He holds a mirror to our society that most people in power, heroes’ grandchildren included, don’t want to see. But when Leonard Wood talks about politicians using diplomatic trips as an excuse for family vacations and Filipinos not ready for independence with their infighting and greed, everything feels so eerily timely. Then you realize that’s the way it’s always been. Me: Question: matatapos na yung trilogy mo. After all is said and done is there an overarching message for the… bayaniverse?Jerrold: *shrugs* Aguinaldo outlived them all?There’s probably something in there. I’ll be thinking about that for a while.",06/11/2025,positive,0.989195824,0

Quezon,"Unlike Heneral Luna and Goyo, Quezon did not show any form of physical violence; rather, it portrayed violence through the use of words. Storytelling-wise, it was quite okay for me, but I think there are a lot of areas that could be improved. As someone who doesn’t appreciate slow-paced movies, Quezon felt really boring to me at the beginning. Nadia’s role as a storyteller throughout the film also felt somewhat messy—but then again, it allows the audience to form their own opinions and perspectives on the narratives and realities she presented during Quezon’s term.In both Heneral Luna and Goyo, Joven served as a symbol of youth—the hopeful defender of our country’s future and independence. In Quezon, however, he symbolized how people might abandon their morals because of the selective facts presented to them—facts that politicians carefully curate for their own benefit. Joven still represented hope for the Philippines, because even though he strayed from the beliefs he once fought for, he eventually came to understand how manipulative and power-hungry politicians can be. This idea was further emphasized by Miguel Laureano’s retirement, which symbolized the shift in political climate and the changing perception of the masses.The movie reflected the bitter reality of our current political state—it mirrored how Filipinos tend to be selective about what kinds of change and movement they are willing to support. As we moved on from Quezon’s term, we should have experienced growth and improvement, yet we did not. The film illustrated how our political system remains trapped in a constant loop, where we continue to vote for and campaign for politicians who ultimately serve Western interests rather than our own.",04/11/2025,positive,0.886485755,0
Quezon,"The controversy over this film has been severely overblown. Yes, it is satire. And just because it is, doesn’t mean it’s a joke that we can’t take seriously. I thought it was pretty good, it’s very well made with a really good performance by Jericho Rosales. My main issue is the character of Joven and his daughter. The use of a fictional journalist is interesting but I feel like him being so involved in the story was too much.

Quezon,"I rarely see Jericho Rosales in films but I think he does a good job capturing Quezon and the way people talk back in the late 1920s-30s. Of course I have to applaud the production and costume design! It’s excellent and if I remember my fashion history well, I think they did a good job at depicting the way Filipinos & especially Filipino women dressed back then. I also LOVE the format they chose to tell the story to stay true to the times, thru the silent films and then the 1920s-30s visual aesthetics. That aspect was so fun I love it so much!!!!!!! Anyway, it’s interesting to see how they portrayed Quezon because I vaguely remember how he was portrayed as a good President back in my elementary Philippine History lessons, how we briefly touched upon his “achievements”. But since they say that this depiction was backed by historians, public facts and documents then I think they really did a good job of humanizing him.

Quezon,"i remember quezon being one of the many names i had to memorize for some 4th grade exam alongside his contributions to the jones act and the tydings-mcduffie act. it was only until i became invested in historical movies that i decided to watch the bayaniverse, and it was in this trilogy where i started to look back and revisit my perspective on our national heroes. when we look at history, the act of calling someone a hero or a villain is very reductive, as it ignores the nuances of their decisions and their distinct worldviews and beliefs. the philippines is not exempt from this at all. in the context of the bayaniverse, these people (luna, goyo, quezon) are inept and egotistical at best, and downright criminal at worst, but put them in a movement, and you have the spirit of the filipino revolution, proud and waving the flag. and despite their flaws, that does not erase the efforts they've done for an independent republic.tarog, with quezon, aimed to showcase both his flaws and his accomplishments in a way that piques our interest and to go to our local library and read up on our history. we are directly anchored in through joven and his family, and through him, we get to interact with the true nature of quezon, one that, just as tarog intended, is not displayed in bullet text or powerpoint. he is a con man who thrives in confidence and does whatever is necessary, because to him, politics is a game of chess. he anticipates, he strategizes, and takes advantage of weakness. he is thrust into a system that benefits those in power, and considering his eagerness to satiate his thirst for power, he uses that system to gain complete control of his circle and of the country.its use of satire and the bravado of 1920s silent film aesthetic at certain points complements the big personality of quezon, immediately making it the most unique out of the trilogy, where the prior films were conventional war epics, rather showcasing the action of politics than the action of bloodshed, but it remains as violent and intense as the previous films, but what makes quezon stand out is that despite its lens (not borrowed from nepomuceno!), the situations facing the country remain significantly relevant. the constant trips costing filipino taxpayers millions? the fact that we have more politicians than public servants? infighting between two major political players? i forgot who said it, but they mentioned that quezon became the blueprint for modern day trapos, and i can see it! he possesses many of the traits that make up most of our senate, he's a cheat, a liar, and an opportunist! and that's what makes our national heroes so much more interesting. in one way or another, they are not faultless, nor are they necessarily bad people. despite all my shit talk on quezon, the one thing i'll give him credit for was his love for the country, his means justify the ends and he DELIVERS, at the cost of his morality and friendships.the chameleon will always fit in with anyone, but in the end, it will end up with no one, and that is the price one shall pay to become the chameleon.i got a good deal though, it was 13 dollars for one ticket? good shit",04/11/2025,positive,0.976348341,0

Quezon,"Kaya pala nagalit si Gov. Helen Tan at kapamilya niya cause they didn’t show a single redeemable trait of Quezon here, which honestly I kind of liked. He’s always portrayed as this larger-than-life president who accomplished so much. And although his flaws are in the history books, they’re rarely emphasized in schools. This movie finally showed that side of him. Although they still showed his contributions for the Filipino people, it was overshadowed by the scheming, womanizing, manipulative traits, and that lowkey god complex side of him, at least with how he was depicted in the movie.He’s still undeniably a great president who did a lot for the country, but it’s good that we don’t over-romanticize or idolize political figures. I just wish they also covered his actions during his term and during the Japanese invasion. It would’ve made a stronger conclusion and could have highlighted more of his contributions.As a Quezonian, this movie slapped. It honestly validated all the shady things I’ve researched about him before for a contest about.... well, him. Gets ko din naman bakit madami na offend, but yun nga we should also be aware of his flaws, and not glorify him too much. Overall great cast and great performances.",04/11/2025,positive,0.985540807,0
Quezon,"i’m in absolute awe of this film. the pacing is just right; the acting and chemistry are incredible; and the showcase of wit and humor—with the right blend of severity and weight in presenting these important moments of our history.i’ve thought of aguinaldo and hernando as “always the side-characters, never the main characters,” for being present in all bayaniverse but never had the chance to have their own movie. however, in this last installment of the trilogy, it was established that aguinaldo and hernando are both the central characters of bayaniverse. it all revolves around them. so i wonder, are their connections the standard or the criteria to be considered?lastly, jerrold tarog’s name will definitely be remembered. as i watch the credits, it’s not an isolated event for a director to be taking more parts of the film, but to direct, edit, transcribe, and score musical elements beautifully??

Quezon,"Echo will surely enjoy picking up trophies for next year's awards derby. A grand slam feat for Best Actor. I could have given QUEZON a perfect score of 5 but the conflict here possibly to give it more cinematic highlight aside from that toss coin sequence... we didn't see his accomplishments. He was presented as a womanizer, traitor friend and a political manipulator that brought controversy thrown to the cast and crew by one of the grandson of Quezon during the Q&A. Technically this is the most polished among the Bayaniverse which includes HENERAL LUNA & GOYO. A film like this comes as a manna from heaven since big budget period epic comes only in a blue moon for theatrical viewing. Kudos to TBA, cast and crew! I I only knew Leonard Wood as one of the roads in the City of Pines, this one gave me the curiosity the best time now to dig our history.And the fantastic ensemble cast along with Jericho Rosales includes Mon Confiado as Aguinaldo. How about a back to back win next year for Best Supporting Actor? Let time will tell if QUEZON will be on the league of our period epic classics like JOSE RIZAL, ORO PLATA MATA & GANITO KAMI NOON PAANO KAYO NGAYON but for the meantime let's be grateful that this film manage to keep Philippine Cinema alive at least for the meantime.",04/11/2025,positive,0.995288491,0

Quezon,"I watched Quezon yesterday in the cinemas. The movie leans heavily on the negative aspects of Manuel L. Quezon’s character—some of which are based on conjecture and lack sufficient historical evidence to be accepted as truth. For example, there is a scene portraying voters booing Emilio Aguinaldo during his presidential campaign, supposedly orchestrated by Quezon. There is no record of this ever happening.The film presents an unbalanced portrayal of the Philippines’ first president, further complicated by a fictional subplot involving made-up characters: journalist Jevon Hernando and his filmmaker daughter, Nadia, who produce campaign videos for Quezon’s presidential run while secretly creating “more honest” versions of each one.I didn’t quite understand the purpose of this subplot, except perhaps to draw parallels with the current political climate. The campaign videos felt like an early version of a “troll farm.” In that sense, the film invites viewers to reflect on the prevalence of “fake news” and how even legitimate journalists can become complicit in the myth-making that surrounds political figures.The film puts forward the idea that “democracy” in the Philippines has never been the real deal because of problematic leaders such as Manuel Quezon, and that the system has always been broken from the start. I think it’s a motivating sentiment; however, the message becomes contrived when retroactively applying it to Quezon’s story.It presents what on the surface appears to be a compelling question: What does it mean when a historical film uses a 21st-century lens to moralize the past? However, I personally disagree with this treatment of history. I believe history should be explored as unfamiliar terrain—something distinct from our present time. Otherwise, how could we genuinely learn anything from it? Imposing a modern framework of social media–driven politics onto the past flattens historical complexity, especially when many Filipinos don’t have access to in-depth historical education or materials outside of school.The story—not just of Manuel Quezon’s life, but of all Filipinos involved in the journey toward Philippine independence, from the formation of the Senate and Congress to the election of the first president—could have offered an inspiring message. Instead, all of this is portrayed as nothing but a sham. The film minimizes the work that Filipino figures did to win our independence by focusing only on the unsavory details of Quezon’s life, such as his love-hate relationship with Osmeña and his ploy to get Governor-General Leonard Wood removed from office. One of the film’s early fictional chapters is titled Quezon vs. Hernando: A Noble Lie, in which Quezon and Hernando debate the concept of “noble lies” using a quote from Plato. Quezon “loses” the argument simply because Hernando can name-drop more philosophers. Many scenes like this follow, reducing Quezon to a caricature—an exaggeratedly naïve and shallow version of himself.Because our history is often told through the lens of our colonizers, mainly Americans, Filipinos have long had a weak sense of the value of freedom and independence. We have been taught to believe that we are not ready to govern ourselves—and perhaps never will be. The film includes Quezon’s famous line: “I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by the Americans.” In a more balanced portrayal, this line could have carried real gravitas. But given the film’s cynical treatment of Quezon, it instead becomes further evidence of his supposed incompetence.This film could have offered audiences a meaningful, alternative way to engage with our history. Instead, it mimicked the very dynamics of social media, reducing historical events into digestible, sensationalized drama. Audiences should ask questions while watching the movie, such as: Is there any genuine historical basis for the scene in which Manuel Quezon asks Vicente Madrigal for a blank check to fund his presidential campaign? What was the purpose of showing a completely fabricated conversation between a drunk Leonard Wood and Manuel Quezon?I also took issue with the portrayal of Emilio Aguinaldo as Quezon’s more “credible” rival. The movie pits Quezon and Aguinaldo against each other, going so far as to fabricate or misrepresent events to exaggerate their rivalry—such as showing Quezon canceling Aguinaldo’s pension during his run against him and framing the loss of Aguinaldo’s farm as a personal attack. Neither of these are based on fact. It is well-documented that Aguinaldo ordered the executions of Andres Bonifacio and Antonio Luna. These are not Quezon’s political inventions—they are part of the historical record. Yet the movie invents an entirely fictional subplot involving Pedro Janolino, who reaches out to Joven Hernando to reveal that Aguinaldo ordered him to kill General Antonio Luna. He is later revealed to be Quezon’s sergeant-at-arms who planted the testimony to sabotage Aguinaldo. In truth, there really was a Pedro Janolino, and he did kill General Luna. He died before Quezon ran for president, and it was Panteleon Garcia who later revealed that Aguinaldo ordered Luna’s murder.Unfortunately, I didn’t find the film well-executed overall. The acting was uneven, with the exception of Jericho Rosales (Quezon) and Mon Confiado (Aguinaldo). The fictional film-within-a-film subplot featured unlikable, underdeveloped characters, and the “silent movie” aesthetic came across as contrived rather than clever. The production design was also disappointing. The U.S. colonial period was a stylish era—this is evident from the films and photographs of the time—yet the costumes, especially for the women, lacked both elegance and authenticity.In the end, I couldn’t understand the film’s motive in diminishing Quezon’s legacy. It seemed told through a distinctly pro-American lens: the Filipino masses are depicted as naïve and gullible, unable to grasp what “independence” truly means, while figures like Sergio Osmeña and Manuel Roxas are reduced to mere sidekicks without agency or depth—an unfair portrayal of these important historical figures.Ultimately, the film misses an important opportunity. Instead of offering a richer understanding of our nation’s early struggles for independence, it relies on cynicism, convenient narratives, and present-day parallels that oversimplify history—a treatment that is both disrespectful to Quezon and his descendants and intellectually irresponsible. That half the movie’s plot rests on a fabricated premise should be a sign for audiences to approach it critically. Quezon’s story deserves a more nuanced, intelligent retelling—one that trusts its audience to think deeply, not one that panders to the fleeting attention span of social media.",04/11/2025,negative,0.555675089,0

Quezon,"I can see why people would criticize this film for not representing the historical figures for all the actions they've done no matter how good or bad. But pieces of art, which this film is (regardless of quality), are meant to tell a thematic story.For what it is, a film and not a documentary, it uses historical figures as symbols to tell a story of political games and showmanship. They are not who they were in history but are instead used as a backdrop for the inner workings of politics still prevalent to this day. The addition of Joven Hernando as a fictional character, other than being a narrative device, is a clear intention of the story being fictional, not historical, even if his existence being too fantastical at times.Yes, it can be dangerous to represent a historical event/s and handwave all inaccuracies as necessary for drama. You can even call this film straight up propaganda since it aims to tell a certain message with regards to politics, but it still functions as a piece of art. There is a risk of audiences viewing this dramatization as historical fact. A risk that no amount of ""fictionalized"" disclaimers can make people believe it to be otherwise.Do I believe this film shouldn't have been made for the lack of historical context it portrays? No. Without this film, I don't think a lot of Filipinos would know who Leonard Wood is. It ignites interests about the historical figures and leads people to seek out the facts themselves. Not a lot of people, me included, were aware of all the shit Wood did as Governor-General prior to this film.I didn't rate this film 3.5/5 for its accuracy, but instead for its pacing and tendency to read between the lines for you. Otherwise, it has great cinematography and a huge improvement in production value compared to Jerrold Tarog's previous films.",03/11/2025,positive,0.94347626,0
Quezon,"This is very much a Bayaniverse entry without a single gunshot fired and the blood staining the chests of military men, its framework based on the idea of the camera being the real militant weapon of the times, and the truth is in the edit, despite Tarog rendering the device no weight. There is simply no richness to be dug from ur-text of Quezon—its notions on the gamification of governance blowing cobwebs off a tired and worn out thesis as its attempts to doll up the friction within his praxis end up flat (why the hell is Aguinaldo suddenly so scared of placards). And so it becomes all the more revealing when Tarog stayed silent during the meltdown of a Quezon descendant at their Powerplant Q&A: a silence that reveals a spinelessness unbecoming of a filmmaker who has made the Definitive Trilogy on behalf of the Filipino People™.

Quezon,"it felt like i was watching a theater play proshot (/pos)this movie, to me, is more of a political statement slash challenge than a biopic. i don’t have enough words yet to give a proper review (because of all the historical/current world contexts to take into consideration), but in this portrayal of quezon, he really was showed as a villainous bayani… there was a lot of room for more depth sana like focusing on his whys but wala eh, it was just a repetition of oooo ok quezon wasn’t all that good. to be clear, i am not defending him ok but i think his bad guy representation was a biiiiiit too excessive which rly strengthens my theory na this movie was made to parallelize (??? word ba ‘yun) our current politicians lol BASTA marami pa kong thoughts pero ‘yan na munabut anyway! the technical aspects of this film might be my favorite out of the three movies so far (luna, goyo, and this). 10/10 cinematography (direk pong you have done it again), movie pacing was great, scoring + sound design was superb, and i love love LOVED the distinct/purposeful color grading. ganda talaga fuck congrats prod team",03/11/2025,positive,0.964241982,0

Luna is a heroes hero, while Goyo and Quezon have little to no redeeming qualities in their portrayal.

Quezon,"Politics in the Philippines has always been a cycle of promises, lies, and abuse of power. This movie shows that Filipino politicians of the past are no different from those we have today. It shows us how we are deceived by lies, how we often choose the worst option when making decisions, and how “utang na loob” continues to shape our choices. The film’s pacing feels unique, almost like an American movie. It focuses on exposing Quezon’s wrongdoings, which explains why his grandson reacted strongly, but as they say, history doesn’t lie. I did find it hard to separate fact from fiction, especially since the place where Emilio was cornered in the movie wasn’t the same as in real life. That can be misleading for viewers, especially students. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the film; I didn’t even notice how quickly time passed while watching it.",03/11/2025,positive,0.962827981,0

Quezon,"It’s a pretty straightforward historical drama, chronicling the rise of a political leader and charting the path for independence for The Philippines. I’ll acknowledge that it doesn’t seem to be a shameless puff piece, and it acknowledges Quezon as a sort of leader without much personal integrity who focuses more on pragmatism, which perhaps may have been important for his goals, even if he was driven largely by ego. There is some interesting artistic flair with the silent film interpretations, which honestly should have been the entire film.Jericho Rosales is excellent at giving that Charlie Sheen vibe.It’s a solid film overall even if it does kind of drag with a bunch of political bullshit that’s admittedly all the same thing of constant backstabbing and alliances, which does sound cool, but it’s a pretty normal historical drama.",02/11/2025,positive,0.992553294,0
Quezon,"Just don’t compare Quezon to the first two films in the trilogy and you’ll find something to admire. It stands on its own as a portrait of power and pride, though at times unsure of which face to show. Jericho Rosales walks a tightrope between conviction and caricature, brilliant one moment, baffling the next. The production looks rich and patriotic, but the story doesn’t quite know what it’s fighting for. It wants to build a hero, but forgets to give him a clear battle. Still, if you let it be its own story, you’ll enjoy the echoes of history and the weight of what it tries to say.",03/11/2025,positive,0.949134052,0

Quezon,"The two sides of the same coin. The admired and the flawed. The good old fashioned politician and the staunch patriot.""QUEZON"" isn't particularly the film that one may expect from writer-director Jerrold Tarog's ""Bayaniverse"". The titular hero isn't glorified but examined - with all his strengths and imperfections. History, as rich as it gets, immortalizes the gripping and controversial facets of the beloved statesman that unsurprisingly still echo up to this day.Exceptionally played by Urian winner Jericho Rosales, we get to see the might, influence, charisma, narcissism, lies, and betrayals of Philippines' second president through his acting force and vulnerability. The penchant to roll the classic 4:3 movie aspect ratio in its short films and the interesting camera pans during the Congress election strategies a la chess moves are some of its strong suits. Art and production designs, although a good addition, can be improved to perfectly embody its era. Bearing its creative license, it dramatizes the calculated games and internal conflicts through (at times confusing) non-linear storytelling with hefty dialogues and politicking narratives that can be cut down in exchange for more warranted depictions of political effects to the society under the eight-year regime, apart from showcasing people's ignorance of the very notion of independence. Now that would be more compelling and cathartic. Rosales truly leads the pack but it's indubitable that every featured artist (Romnick Sarmenta, Mon Confiado, Cris Villanueva, Benjamin Alves, Karylle, and even its import Iain Glen to name a few) pours their heart to the material. A call to action in these trying times, may this push us to demand for a better nation.Joven Hernando and Alerta. Plato and Kant. Casey and the Philippines. Heroes are still humans. 3.5/5, folks!

Quezon,"'The Noble Lie'. This is one of the lines that resonated with me after watching the film. The mere fact that these traditional politicians boil everything that they do down to this idea of doing questionable means towards a 'good end' is not only narcissistic but also dangerous at best. These people genuinely believe that a lie could be considered 'noble'. Meaning, what is ethically right for them is already skewed, and that conscience no longer plays a role in the crux of their actions. Rosales' Quezon, even at the very end of the film, embodied this rotten mentality, thoroughly absorbed in the idea of being the 'Great Savior' that the Philippines needed for its independence--even at the expense of losing the true meaning of the word.Truly a magnificent end to the 'bayaniverse' trilogy, showcasing a 'war' that is not fought in the front (compared to 'Heneral Luna' and 'Goyo'). A war that is played behind cunning speeches and charming smiles, but is dangerous all the same. Not gonna lie, I thoroughly enjoyed Quezon and Osmena's dynamics (iykyk). Will definitely be watching again.",02/11/2025,positive,0.991451085,0

Quezon,"came for the politics, stayed for the toxic yaoiquezon was a fun yet impactful movie about what it means to be a ""bayani"" and the dark side of it. it mostly showed quezon and his two sides: the charming hero of the masses and the dirty tactics opportunist that keeps him in the business. i liked the film felt like a play mirroring how quezon was like a showman and despite a lot of creative liberties, they don't miss with the emotional story beats. it is a shame we didnt get more screentime in his term in ww2 (the standardization of the filipino language kinda does deserve its own film) and the positive effect of his accomplishments on the filipino besides morale but with the scope of the movie being really large, im fine with what we have. i think the film is important as it gives younger people a more accessible way to learn about and cultivate an interest in history, myself included.",02/11/2025,positive,0.991087973,0

Isa sa mga huli sa bayani trilogy ni Jerrold Tarog sums everything up. Imahe ni Quezon na akala natin na perpektong tao siya, ay malayo sa katotohanan. Ang mga itinuturing nating bayani ay meron at merong mga kamalian. Pakita sa pelikulang ito na ang pulitiko ay laro lamang ng mga ilan para sa sarili at di para sa tao, di para sa bayan. Ang satirang mapapaisip ka kung and independensya ay tunay o nakatanikala pa tayo sa mga banyaga. Ano nga ba ang independensya sa kasalukuyang panahon ngayon? Kung independensya ay di kalayaan, di tayo malaya. Isang kakaibang pelikula na dapat tuloy pa na pag-usapan ng tao at di lamang ipagbawalan dahil lamang sa pamilyang nakinabang sa imahe na ibinigay sa kanilang ninunong Quezon. Kahit nga si Quezon ay biktima dahil sa pananaw na sumabay at makilaro sa sistema upang sana matupad ang kalayaan. Ngunit nilubog siya hanggang hindi na siya kailangan ng mga banyaga.

Quezon,"I think the film has true promise. Quezon has always been quite a controversial figure of the early fight for true Philippine independence. He did as much good and as much bad if you really think deeply about it BUT the film is just presented in such a dense way.In posits there is true good in Politics.Even sections of actual criticism in the film is really hampered by Tarrog's insistence of the right 'governance'. The lack of a real alternative or an actual in depth conversations that does not really fall into this guise of moral grandstanding is prevalent that it was so eyeroll inducing. You can read philosophies and still be the worst person ever - a college with Liberal Arts make you learn that quickly. If Quezon did not win, what does Aguinaldo can offer in the table that he himself had not done too?Rather film, just villainizes Quezon's insistence to lead. One good example of the film's insistence for moralistic bent but lack of actual 'analysis' is the film's villainization of Quezon's use of his connection.That is what connections are for. To create this dynamic give and take but it oh no, that is bad - because he can make so much campaign materials. It never really delivered on the fact on what would become the Nacionalista Party lead to one of the biggest ultra-majority in the Philippine's History, a familiar sight if anyone has lived to tell in the Duterte era Congress. In fact, the film kinda glosses the fact that this same majority lead the changes in the constitution that inadvertently resulted to the Marcos Dictatorship. In fact, I do think the reason there are many rich families interested in Government is because how they were able to really to enter political spaces during this time. Like for a film that prides itself as critical, it always uses these weak arguments to posit the rather double face attitude of Quezon. I was grasping straws, because it uses the worst criticisms (ad hominems) rather than just actually pulling real punches that is still present in the current Philippine political space. It just bats this idea that Quezon wants the presidency is bad (not really bad), because he wants it no matter what. His machination is bad since he is not truthful about his intention. It literally is true facts. Quezon is a problematic and prolific muckraker, that most of what we hate about Aguinaldo is actually rooted towards his campaign against him. That is attested but a lot of actual paper trails sadly has been destroyed by the war of 45. The film posits that is bad. (not necessarily) but the problem here is that the film also plays out the same muckraking as noble against some of his 'enemies' since they it's not out there. Like come-on now film. That is just plain stupidity at this point. You cannot just make this two sides of the coin when it's practically the same side. I also hate how the film hates Quezon since he is sly about his approach on things but equally loves the American because of their you ready sine clearly the average filipino does not know the word for Independence. THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT THE LEADERS to begin with. Another instance of the film going for the soft analysis over real question of readiness with the leadership. And also, it really gives so much pass for the Americans and how they handled the Philippines, because they are well-meaning apparently. Suddenly, the atrocities is just a side comment here and there. Even Aguinaldo, who could have been more complex as a character himself is just plainly glorified. I just feel there is so much more here that could have been made to make this actually critical in a sense that in actually is talking about things that would still be prevalent in our life and all. On a lighter mode, Good performances though. Echo does well. I personally think certain actors looked closer to the very Hispanized Quezon but has character for it. He kinda performed really well and the cavalcade of supporting role was a welcome surprise. I personally think the film did well visually and editing wise, which is a lot for a local film. The costuming though is really bad - a lot of badly fitted suits. I will still recommend this BUT with a deep reading about Quezon's role in PHI history tbh. It is important to look at this with a more critical eyes since this takes a lot of true issues about Quezon but in a way that feels misguided tbh. (1) Hmmm. Surface level talks about Government leadership. I wish sana within true leaders dapat tbh. DDS sense is tingling.(2) Uy cinema scenes. Pero again this belief that there is only true good and true bad. And true good is not subtle . And by knowing western idealogy.(3) Konfirmed, half glass empty approach and very dds.(4) The American racism is played done here.(5) Also, Tarrog does hate Quezon here. Even a simple political function like Appointment is played against Quezon, because it is his literal job. He has a job to do, what do you mean he has to be true to some kind of moral logic.(6) Soft positive, great style from Tarrog.(7) Sa lahat ng oomff ko walang commentary about how American was never really into the Philippines, or the rather weird anti-independence belief in the film. but posits that murican cares about you and baddie quezon just want to be free.(8) Not the Aguinaldo advocacy in the film. I still have an hour left off this film and this awful and redeemable in my eyes.(9) Ang tanga na nung film. Literal na may political parties and donor ang isang politiko. Your unpopularity with donors/failing party is more of you problem.(10) There is credence on Aguinaldo vs Quezon. I do believe that Aguinaldo even tried to oust his presidency. (Incorrect it was much worst - collaboration with the Japanese). (11) But this feels like too critical to Quezon at all.(12) This is practically me trying to piece my history. Quezon is not the nicest man in all accounts - the film got that right but he pushed the buttons to where our country lead into. Successful or Not. The film is just too damn negative to the point That it rather be friendly to Americans and Aguinaldo and make them a densely woo is mee characters. (13) Aguinaldo being shocked that people hate after getting a bunch of KKK members death. Kkk is not the same klub from USA, btw.(14) This last section that heavily focuses on Quezon in his final days is so much better. It is a true character study that does not need grandstanding good or bad morality. Talaga namern.",02/11/2025,negative,0.501328826,0

Quezon,"Glad TBA had the budget to export Iain Glen to give an Off-Broadway theatre performance that only serves as a functional foil for a domineering Filipino icon. Speaking of, Rosales thankfully did not rely on the heroic gravitas of John Arcilla's General Luna and playful charm of Paulo Avelino's Goyo. Instead, he leans on the spiteful energy and conniving instincts of a Peter Sellers character, which fits on the pseudo-satirical bite that this Bayaniverse entry tries to achieve.It is not the best of the three. (In fact, it is the most eyebrow-raising but liberating of them.) Yet, if it spawns discussion of what is truth or fiction, satire or reality, heroism or populism, and identity or heritage, then it more than succeeds its intentions or un-intentions.2025 Movie Diary #81",26/10/2025,positive,0.95666045,0

Quezon,"The third installment of the Bayani-verse franchise yet again provides a compelling portrayal of another pivotal figure in Philippine history. Jericho and Karylle really stood out in their roles as President Manuel L. Quezon and First Lady Aurora Quezon. I particularly enjoyed the unraveling of the Aguinaldo vs. Quezon showdown in 1935, a satisfying karmic payback for the atrocities Aguinaldo did in the past. Understandably, the movie was not as action packed as its predecessors given that its events occurred post-Philippine revolution. But I found the movie’s exposition of the political drama at that time to have sufficiently made up for the lack of gunshots and wars as a backdropWhile the movie is set in the ‘20s-‘30s, “Quezon” poignantly mirrors the patronage and personality politics that continue to fester our country today. It ultimately makes one realize that our nation’s forefathers are as equally to be blamed, if not more, for the sorry state of our government today.

Quezon,"This third bayaniverse installment is more creative and whimsical. It's fitting to the message that the movie is trying to make about powerful men's greed that shaped the beginning of our republic (characterized by choreography, a performance, and ultimately a game where Filipinos lose). We feel more directly the decision to make the film allude to our current political landscape where media becomes a tool in dividing the people. I don't think people should take this as autobiographies of our ""bayani"" because this film is not just about Quezon but equally the beginnings of a Philippine government that the people deal with today. It's a reflection of our current conditions and the reasons why independence is still a thing our politicians utter but the people never fully grasp.

I love how there is this emphasis on us contributing to the very same system that hurts us (symbolized by Joven seeking Quezon out and promoting him), but at the same time the film does not fault us for this because it also acknowledges that we do this to secure our future and the lives of our families. At the end of the day, like Joven, we can still very much acknowledge that the system is absolute ass and fight against it.The unfortunate thing about Tarog's movies so far have been that they're too familiar. So familiar in fact that you can compare an event in the movie to a political event that happened, let's say, just a few weeks ago. Quezon said that he would rather a government run like hell by Filipinos, than a government run like heaven by Americans, because that means we -- the Filipinos -- have the freedom to improve it without outside forces pushing and pulling at us. The problem is, nothing has changed. The Philippines is as much run like hell today as it was way back then.I love you Nadia, 1930s Filipina movie director.

Quezon,"It’s very ambitious. Though it made a valiant attempt, I think it got lost in trying to tell the 30+ year story of the most powerful Filipino 2nd only to Ferdie. Malakas yung opening niya, pero as the screentime went on, naging paulit ulit nlng yung character beat ni Quezon. I think eto talaga yung kahinaan ng “Bayaniverse”. Though deep and well acted, ultimately 2D lng yung mga main characters. The ending was disappointing. Rinush yung “tragedy” ni Quezon to a single scene. It felt less like a story and more just a chronology/ documentary, which is the danger nmn of all biopics. Still, it was a fun watch. The smallest attention to detail (like 48 stars lng yung US flag not 50) kept me hooked since it showed na it was made with passion, nde lng for the cheap jokes/ caricatures of history.

Pulling off the production requirements for historical films is incredibly difficult, but what amazes me about director Jerrold Tarog is his profound sense of vision. It is creative, yet direct enough to clearly tell the narrative to a broad audience.Narrative-wise, the ""film within a film"" trope is a good idea, though it needs some polishing to make the 'buddy and soul' arc more impactful. Despite needing that refinement, it remains a highly creative approach to the story.While I struggle to engage during the very first few minutes, from my lens, this is a great film.

Jerrold Tarog must be commended for his continued examination of the nation’s founding fathers - and this is a fitting, albeit unofficial, conclusion to his ‘Bayaniverse’ trilogy.",16/10/2025,positive,0.996799469,0
Quezon,"All that for what, shits and giggles?I honestly am very disappointed by this movie. How was this movie PG, there were swear words every five seconds and smoking in every room?Film makers that continue to fumble when they have a book, a short story, a myth, or literally HISTORY, as reference material continues to baffle me. What a waste of resources and potential.These events happened already. Why the need to add fictional elements for thematic purposes? Was adding fictional character/s necessary, if their goal was to educate our generation of who Quezon really was? And why include flashbacks inside the movie, when we are already looking back into the past? It adds confusion as to where we are in the plot. I did not like the ugly art deco designs in the flashback scenes and as part of the office design. The over contoured faces. Using “Hallelujah Chorus” as background music during the signing of the Tydings-McDuffie Act was tasteless. Please try to be more imaginative next time.American characters (like Wood) being portrayed as morally upright in contrast with Quezon’s portrayal of character should be talked about more. It implies white supremacy and colonial mentality. Let’s not do that all over again :)There was a scene where they brought out Quezon’s first wife for five seconds, for what? Was the goal to empower women or to further impose traditional gender roles where women are pushed to the sidelines? She was dismissed, shrugged from the plot. Please do better next time.This movie had the potential to call out the dirty elections, spoils system, traditional politics, systematic corruption, and imperialism. The very same issues they faced (or should I say reinforced?) before that we still face today. While I do commend the morally stained portrayal of Quezon as it serves as a lesson to not idolize individuals (especially government officials). However, the public may be misled to believe this fictional plot points that are conveniently dramatic. We should not tolerate or promote historical distortion in media. It would be so much better to simply provide the public a historical film that adheres to historical documents and facts.Ps. These are just my opinions.

Quezon,"gets ko na yung nagsabing oppenheimer tagalog to... HAHAHAHAH as far as mainstream pinoy cinema goes, this is a pretty great takedown of the idea of the ""great man"" as told in the history textbooks that we grew up with. the act of framing manuel quezon's shenanigans in his rise to power as one of the seeds that bore our nation's problems in the present is a pretty brave and bold move for a big budget, mainstream studio film to take, especially in the context of our local cinema. what i think makes quezon work so well is how, unlike the previous two films, it still plots out a clear narrative without losing sight of its unifying thread despite chronicling more than decade's worth of history.the unfortunate caveat to all of this is, of course, the loss of focus on other significant political and social players during this time, such as the sakdalista movement, as well as the downplaying of the strength and significance of the presidential campaign of gregorio aglipay, who himself won two provinces, despite the insignificance that the film portrays him with.despite all that, for what it is, jerrold tarog's quezon is still one of the most exciting filipino releases in recent memory, and the inevitable role it will play in the further reassessment of the way we've learned our history and the eventual reckoning with it will be one that i will be watching out for.",24/10/2025,positive,0.980091751,0
Quezon,"Out of all the films in this trilogy, I think Quezon captures the thesis Tarog's take on the filipino hero the best. Comparing it to Luna and especially Goyo, Quezon seems to be more overt with its critique on filipino politics and the filipino people as spectators of what goes on in our society. Though, seemingly with the other films in this trilogy, its message is served to its audience on a silver platter (some would say very preachy) but I guess it's a hard responsibility to take as a directior especially with how a lot of people took Luna's messaging. So in a way that proves the message of the movie? How could the filipino understand freedom if they are deprived of learning about it? also the performances were so good, Jericho Rosales' charisma and his ability to look so scary and eerie in the most tense situations *chefs kiss* in another note, teasing magsaysay in a post credit scene like the next solo movie in the marvel cinematic universe is so funny.",31/10/2025,positive,0.987947643,0

Quezon,"While Quezon definitely has less action compared to Heneral Luna and Goyo, the other films in the “Bayaniverse,” I was not bored at all. The pacing might be gentler, but the storytelling and performances more than make up for it. The cast delivered strong portrayals that captured both the humanity and complexity of the historical figures, and the musical score complemented the drama beautifully. The production values were impressive as well. They may not be Hollywood-level in terms of scale, but they are undeniably Filipino in spirit and craftsmanship. You can really feel the trademark quality of TBA Studios throughout.As someone who’s a Filipino history nerd, I really appreciated how this film shed light on another side of Manuel L. Quezon, one that’s often overshadowed by his more famous political achievements. I also just learned that Quezon was a lawyer, and as a lawyer myself, it was fascinating to see how he was able to “play the game,” navigating from being a trial lawyer to eventually becoming the President of the Philippines. It added another layer of depth and respect for his intellect and political skill.Having just been to Bataan last week for a historical and heritage trip, I felt an even deeper connection to the story and the period it depicted.I was also fortunate enough to have seen Quezon’s Game a few years ago, and watching Quezon felt like seeing a grander, more expansive retelling of that same chapter in our history. The scope, emotion, and context were all heightened, giving a broader and richer perspective on Quezon’s legacy.Overall, Quezon might not rely on action or spectacle, but it delivers a story that deepens our understanding of one of the key figures in our nation’s history.",31/10/2025,positive,0.996252358,0

Quezon,"sinaunang yaoi is crazy bruh The first thing that really came to mind when I was watching this movie was the stylistic choice it decided to take on. The story-telling was incredible, following the movies made by Nadia with some scenes being her movie, while others being ""real life"". The way scenes were shot in ""real life"" in the style of a silent movie was genuinely so unique to me that it caught my eye. The merge of styles through out the entire movie all fit perfectly as well as contrasted each other well. Secondly, which is probably the most obvious, I enjoyed the perspective this movie gives towards not just Quezon but politics in general. I have heard the criticism about the fantasies this movie merges into what is the ""truth"", but I argue that is the point. The proper approach to movies like this is that after watching it, it should encourage you to research on your own. Be interested, be curious, and compare it to the life we live in. It brings Filipinos awareness back to the Philippines and our history. It may not all be true, but it sure is interesting. Of course, I have to mention the incredible acting of Jericho Rosales, Romnick Sarmenta, Mon Confiado, Therese Malvar, and the rest of the amazing cast. They brought these characters to life. There was a lot of debate about whether or not Jericho Rosales was the right fit for Quezon, but he did astoundingly well. I admire his efforts to be as true to life as he could be, accent and all. I am extremely attached to the style this movie had. Its use of colors, cinematography, and even sound were foundational to the narrative. The final scene, with quezon's quote of ""I am the Filipino People, I am the Philippines!"" brought chills all over my body. The envy in his voice when he questions why Osmeña was blessed with a healthy body and him not made me also question the irony of their story. It reminds me that sins are also reflected in the body. Wonderful movie, it brings about questions that we may never get answers to, and thoughts we may never complete. A beautiful and extravagantly painted picture of the past, that now leaves an impression on our present and the actions for our future.",31/10/2025,positive,0.990605295,0

Heavy on dialogue but instead of it being a weakness, it's definitely one of the film's strength especially with how they made it humorous.Visually, so dang gewd ! para akong pinasok sa black and white film and then narealize ko na may kulay nga pala ang mundo noon. It did not feel like that sa past two bayaniverse pero siguro kasi iba ang focus nila doon.My takeaway lang talaga ay quezon is so smart at the game. Karma siya ni aguinaldo, pero karma niya si sergio. If you think about it, the karma goes on and on until today.my dad quoted the saying na sa politika, there's no permanent friend or permanent enemy, only permanent intentions.

This unique take is a welcome for me, especially at a time when politics is very critical and in the spotlight.I like that with the leads' way of speaking, it also brings a level of absurdity and sarcasm, or clownery should I say; which echoes the times of the story, and now.",31/10/2025,positive,0.995434225,0

Quezon,"The Questions of QuezonThroughout Jerold Tarog's trilogy, he raises important questions about heroism — and in Quezon (2025), he explores it not as an absolute truth but as a matter of perception. Sa dami ng na-trigger at nabuong kontrobersya, it begs the question: handa na nga ba tayo sa malayang diskusyon tungkol dito?“Independencia!” The very ideal that Quezon and his forerunners fought and died for is finally within reach — pero paano ito aabutin ng bagong magiging presidente? The film thrives in the space between conflicting morals, fitting for a morally obsessed country riddled with corruption. Alin nga ba ang mas epektibo? Idealismo or realidad?The film is generous in portraying the old man's charm, eloquence, and impeccable sense of style. But in true Tarog fashion, he wasn't safe from being questioned either. Beneath the charisma lies his vanity, a leader fully aware of his strength and uses it to advance his ambitions -- whether for his country or for himself, who knows?Tarog's meta approach, blending fiction and history is a tricky but effective device. Nadia's films-within-the-film reveal two sides of the story, the same way Tarog does throughout his trilogy. The film doesn’t just retell the past; it exposes how the narratives we accept as truth are constructed. Gaano nga ba kalaki ang papel ng media, pelikula, o ngayon, ng TikTok sa politika ng bansa?What remains unclear, however, is the role of the Americans in the narrative. I didn’t quite appreciate how Governor Wood sort of became a ""father figure"" to the away-bati childishness of Quezon and Osmeña. Wasn’t this separation engineered by the ’Kano themselves?In today's battle against fake news, sensationalism and historical accuracy, Quezon's creative licenses may be a double-edged sword. But honestly? To hell with it!It's a triumph of Filipino filmmaking. It provokes, divides, and gets us all talking. Quezon doesn’t claim to be the truth, but it forces us to question who gets to tell it. So really, what is there to lose?---------On a lighter note, as a tubong Quezon myself, I have to say — Echo nailed Quezon’s American English accent of that time, but not quite his Tayabasing Tagalog.",27/10/2025,positive,0.888895392,0

Quezon,"Quezon provides an unbiased but contentious retelling of the titular character’s rise and fall in Philippine politics, his undeniable influence and charm, and his lasting impact in the country’s bid for independence.Despite the title, the film was not a glorification, but a critique on the character that is Manuel L. Quezon, the second president of the Philippines. Because while it was he who sought for Philippine independence, history tells us he might have done it in the not so cleanest of ways. While charming and influential, he was also brutal, unrelenting, and felt like he was Thanos or Darth Vader at times.The storytelling was great. Using film to backtrack the history of Quezon from his humble beginnings to his rise to presidency was really a good touch. It also really helped in presenting the exposition and Philippine history without it seeming like it was forced. It was like watching an educational film within a film.It was really paced well, too, as it divided chapters of Quezon’s life based on his political enemies at the time – it was like watching him go up the political ranks as he beat one adversary after another. Each scene felt intentional and it didn’t feel like 2 hours have passed.Like any other historical account, this film took some big creative liberties as well. While it could be really good for dramatic effect and inducing a reaction, it could also spark controversy and be misconstrued as the truth. With this, I thought some of the choices could’ve stuck to the truth and just exaggerated them a bit.But all in all, Quezon is a great film for both the casual audience and history buffs. It’s a good critique on the character of Manuel Quezon and as well as on all the political figures surrounding him at the time. At the same time, it’s also a good way to learn about the history of the Philippines, its political landscape, and its journey to independence.

Quezon,"i really wanted to love this film, i was looking forward to it. i did enjoy watching it, both as a film and for its historical subject. the performances were really good, i can see that the actors really enjoyed playing their roles. the story was a bit meta as well which i liked.but the film had a lot going for it that really held it back. the production felt rushed. the actor for wood was wasted with so few scenes showing him. the story also spanned too wide a period, leaving no room for additional context as to what was happening in the film. i knew the historical context behind those scenes, but i doubt the same can be said of the general public.then there's the narrative itself. one issue that really bothers me with this trilogy is how they portray the americans as reasonable. that scene where wood was talking to some locals and how they exclaimed that independence was good enough to eat was icky. what exactly is that scene supposed to mean. it feels patronizing. and how they felt quezon even more so. that he was manipulative, shrewd, was already known. the director said he wanted to humanize him. but quezon had no redeeming qualities in the film. he had no arc. actually, if you look at all three movies, all the leading characters had no arcs. they lived and ended their films with nothing about them having changed, nor something interesting shown about them. luna was a hothead, goyo was a womanizer, and quezon was conniving. luna being this unwavering patriot didnt make sense to me. he ratted out on the katipunan at first, and only joined the revolution when it was finally against the americans. goyo felt too small a figure that even in his own film, the focus wasnt on him, it was on aguinaldo and mabini (granted, that the trilogy was more of aguinaldo's arc, than the figures important to his story). and quezon, for all his and his colleagues' shrewdness, won ph independence from a country so reluctant to recognize it. that it played into their ambition shouldnt faze us from recognizing the monumental task ahead of them. these figures are not beyond reproach, nor are the films wrong from portraying them the way they were portrayed. there are just elements in these films, that quezon really amplify, that prevent them from reaching their potential. these movies have moved the discourse, both in history and in film far, but could not any further.",26/10/2025,positive,0.843927145,0

Quezon,"It’s a masterfully crafted yet morally complex film that dares to strip a national hero of sanctity and reveal him as flawed, strategic, and deeply human. Visually stunning and bold in its storytelling, it reimagines Quezon not as a savior, but as the architect of the very system that made such saviors necessary. Jericho Rosales delivers a remarkable performance—his Quezon feels layered, seamlessly shifting from statesman to tactician with effortless charm. You can sense the performance behind the persona, the fragility behind the power.For me, Quezon isn’t really a takedown of a hero; it’s a mirror. It forces us to see how the leaders we admire, and even the systems we live in, are built by people as fragile and flawed as we are. And maybe that’s what makes it sting—because it feels true.",25/10/2025,positive,0.979806781,0

Quezon,"Tarog’s bayaniverse trilogy ends in a more implicating interpretation of a hero than his two previous films. There is no ambiguity in Quezon’s machiavellian journey to power. Rosales treads close to a mere impersonation while Confiado shines through his restraint.Quezon’s portrayal is flat compared to Luna’s and Goyo’s because unlike the latter, the former is not portrayed as a human with flaws but simply a wretched opportunist fueled by greed and ego. Luna’s populist portrayal is balanced with his sincere desire to fight colonialism. Goyo’s naïveté is tempered by his youthful idealism. Quezon, on the other hand, shows no redeeming factor. All in all, the conclusion to the trilogy reiterates that meeting your heroes is less glamorous than it seems.",30/10/2025,positive,0.797159791,0

Quezon,"A very worthy end to the Bayaniverse Trilogy and I grow to appreciate our flawed heroes more now. The call backs to the previous 2 movies not only makes it interconnected but also historically accurate as the death of Antonio Luna and Goyo being mislead were points used against Aguinaldo during his campaign. Also really liked the character of arc of Joven, from an observer to a journalist, as he is now more present in this story who plays an important role in the plot. Though the movie paints an ugly picture of Quezon, I still see the humanity of a man that truly fought for the Philippines independence which is something we cannot deny. We also have accept that corruption, greed and deception is not new in filipino politics for it tells us that it began a long time ago but we have a lot of history of mistakes and failures to look back on to learn.",30/10/2025,positive,0.995698452,0

Quezon,"What a wonderfully nasty piece of work that portrays things in such a devilishly entertaining way. It was fun watching the politics in this movie portrayed in such a darkly comedic, performative, and theatrical way (especially the first half). The way everything seems so ultra rehearsed, the way they move, the way they’re blocked, etc. together with some lively camera work created for such a weirdly unserious yet engaging experience. Though its chronological sequencing was a bit confusing at the start, and it’s pretty easy to get lost in what point of time we’re in.It’s funny too because these people are determining the future and current state of the country, yet it’s just a game to them; a stupidly intricate, dangerous game for power on who yaps and complains the loudest, all while Americans meddle with everything (as they always have), so it was over when Quezon stated that he learned from them.The biggest compliment I’d give is how this movie lowkey had some balls. I did NOT expect it to paint characters the way they did. They imply a shocking amount of things, and just straight up show how disgusting and slimy people were, albeit really smart and strategic for the worse.The foundation of this country, and its current systems have always been stained by foreigners (particularly the Americans), and it continues to be. Deny it all you want, the worst country in the world has that much power because it convinced the world that it does. The same way the loudest people always have, or end up, with some level of power.That’s Philippine politics for y’all; a loud, nasty, slimy game where the occupiers are always somehow the winners despite what people want to believe. Where the nastiest ones always somehow win, and it’s because they know how to play this deranged, ugly game incredibly well.A game that sadly demands you surrender your morals for survival, and that survival turns into a disgusting lust for power. The worst guy you know won the game because the system favors them.Also, Ramon Magsaysay will appear in Avengers Doomsday ",30/10/2025,positive,0.964251578,0

I am glad that this film wasn't propaganda as it was basically no filter and they showed us plain history. I really salute the cast as they showed their absolute best, especially the main and returning characters of the Bayaniverse trilogy; They all excelled and was at their peak performance in this film and considering this, Yes, this is my favorite and the best film in the bayaniverse trilogy. I found myself very engaged with this film and I have to thank the writers and actors and just a special mention, Benjamin Alves who tried his best to keep up with Jericho Rosales' performance (He was really great by the way). Everyone was great in this film, Mon Confiado, and Romnick Sarmenta, just special shout outs but everyone was great. Visually speaking too, it was great.

Quezon,"It’s been a while since we’ve seen a political film that brings us back to our senses and challenges what it means to be patriotic. (Maybe Gomburza tho) Quezon is a fresh film that introspects on the evils in both society and ourselves, and how we even play our role in corruption. I loved that Quezon is humanized as someone who had to play the game against bigger evils. Props to the super creative use of storytelling devices and other details, like Joven (journalist), newspapers, and films (all seemingly inspired from Citizen Kane). Much like Kane too, Quezon’s character reveals itself and his ambitions piece by piece, shifting our perception of him until his death.The film does quite have a spoonfed narrative though. The script tends to overexplain its themes and motivations. Great that it makes everything more digestible to the general public, but it also takes away some subtlety.The cast is solid and GOATEDD, and special shoutout to DOP Pong Ignacio. Lighting and cameras were crazy. The production design also makes everything feels so real!! Excited for the next Bayaniverse",28/10/2025,positive,0.996469855,0

Quezon,"This film was indeed a pandora's box as how Mr. Avancena worded it. I came into the movie theater full of enthusiasm to watch it, but I came out full of questions, undecided if I was to believe the narrative, and unsatisfied. Upon going home, I had to research the next days about the veracity of this film. The film juxtaposed several elements of different timeframes such as colorized and non-colorized cinema to show the antagonist Quezon and the underdog Osmena narrative. It showed how Quezon tried to politick the Filipinos and Osmena (the Americans included)just to gain the seat for President. This also portrayed that patronage politics might have started in Quezon's time. However, just like the other Bayaniverse series, it is for the viewer to discern which part of the film was true or not because the disclaimer was only put in the beginning of the film. Thus, the viewers nee to read and research further. After watching the film, I also had the thought that publishing a book might not do so much after the trending phase of this film because in the era of social media, a book would not reach the same level of viewers that the film would reach especially if this will be released on online streaming platforms. On my part, it would be better if I would be able to read the researched part even on a blog online. The cast played well on their roles as Osmena, Quezon, and Aguinaldo. Other made up characters like Nadia and Joven, complemented the storyline . There was even a point where Nadia herself made fun of Quezon's traits. The main characters copied even the intonation of the politicians. Overall, it was a good film, but for a full length film, it feels incomplete. For a film just to end with ""I am the Philippines"", it feels unnatural. Well and good, Quezon died in America so there was really no good ending. But given that this was a mix of fiction and history, I hope they showed at least a memory of Quezon's memorial.",28/10/2025,positive,0.685326397,0

Quezon,"I am leaving here my thoughts I made on my notepad, if it seems very essay-ish and inaccurate I am sorry I tried my best to write my thoughts 4 hours after watching the film. Here it is:“Hindi ka hari!”“Sigurado ka?”In this film we unravel the first President of the Philippines in a time where we never really knew what independence or being free meant. It was just simply a glittery word we acquainted with being free from Americans and establishing our own rule.As far as I am aware 1935 was an establishment of a commonwealth to transition to 1946 which was our genuine independence as a nation. We see this film through a sort of journalistic storytelling lenses of Joven Hernando (a fictional character), as he threads through what he went through prior to this film and the aftermath of Goyo towards the time he was reporting Quezon’s senatorial endeavors, his run for presidency, and unspooling the threads of who and what Quezon is. What is Politics? What is Patronage Politics?Politics has roots in Aristotle’s work, Politika, a Greek word which consequently means things concerning the polis (city). It is the ability by which one can use power, or direct influences to an individual, group, community, or a nation that a person “doing politics” busy themselves with. This occurs at all levels of a society.Now what is patronage politics? Associations, positions, promotions, and contracts are based on personal connections and friendships rather than pure merit. This is also what we call the padrino system or clientelism. Why am I highlighting this? You may think of our so called Bayanis as the glorified images they were portrayed as and made up to be by textbooks, anecdotes, and so on. But, they are just as horrid and grotesque as any 21st century politician can be. As Quezon believed it, it was a game, and the trick was to cheat it. Noble LiesIn the movie we see Joven and Quezon have a short argument about truth, their difference, and why it matters when they’ve attained a victory for independence or freedom. They reference many classic texts and philosophical concepts from which Quezon mentioned “mentira noble”, Spanish for a noble lie.This is a concept derived from Plato’s ‘The Republic’ in which Plato discusses that societies are built on such lies. If the masses believe in something (independence), then there is something to fight for. (Krause, 2019) Which in the film he utilizes as a way to earn power and along the way do some good for those who have placed his trust on him.Joven’s dialogue and realizations in contrast to this throughout the film reflects the audience’s gradual disposition over what can we believe from Quezon or in contemporary times, those who claim to have the nation’s best interests.Are Filipinos that fucking stupid?The humor in the film is great. Satire doesn’t necessarily mean a quality of being funny but just the moments that are spread sporadically throughout the film makes you smile and chuckle while also grappling with how twisted the butt of the jokes are. There is this moment when Leonard Wood who went on a trip around the Philippines to survey whether the Filipinos were truly capable of independence asked a few townspeople along with his translator if they knew what independence meant, to which one replied that: “They become full (their stomach) from the thought of it,” I couldn’t help but laugh and overhear a chuckle from 1 other watcher besides me. (Albeit what I quoted is not direct as I am struggling remembering the exact line. )So the question is are Filipinos stupid? No. We believe the propagandas, the persuasive anecdotes, what others say, and what we say because we hope for nothing but the best for all of us. It is not our fault that those we place our trust in chooses to betray us—the same way Quezon did to Joven, the same way Quezon did to Aguinaldo, and the same way Aguinaldo did to Luna and Bonifacio. I cannot stress how we’re stuck in this perpetual loop and how deep-rooted such issue is. Alas, human nature and greed is a mystical thing, it surpasses all reasoning and thought.But, in this day and age, if you cannot use history and the information at your disposal to think rationally—you are a stupid Filipino. Sorry.The WomenWhat is Aurora Quezon, Maria Agoncillo, and Carmen and Nadia Hernando’s role in all of this? Well, to show the intricacies and persistence of women who stand at the shadows of history. Aurora Quezon, behind the scenes is a woman who could stand her ground at the same level as Manuel Quezon.Maria Agoncillo, becomes Aguinaldo’s anchor as he goes through the loss and dirty tactics done by Quezon. Carmen and Nadia are smart women whose integrity and careers are supported by their husband in a time where women were otherwise discouraged. An article by the Lifestyle Inquirer goes into interviews with the respective actresses and provides valuable insight for these characters and how important they are. You can search for it. With that, I hope to soon see a movie about a female hero, as the director also hopes to do if given the chance.Quezon has a husband, OsmenaThey should get married, honestly. They bicker and make up like a husband and his wife would. The parallels run deep, friend or foe, tampuhan, the ancient and homosexual version of Bongbong and Sara. You will understand what I mean when you see the film, it sounds diabolical, I know.Their dynamic is like two academic rivals who do nothing but outdo each other and try to tolerate each other and when hurt make up for it. For instance, the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act and the blatant copying of assignment but slightly changing the wording with the consequent Tydings-McDuffie Act all because Quezon wanted the credit when Hare-Hawes-Cutting was his idea. Finally…“Maybe it’s about proving what you can do, instead of proving what is right.” — Carmen HernandoShe’s right, at the end of the day why should these politicians never fulfill and serve their own interests? At this point it is an interplay of psychological warfare, scheming, power play, and gaining something out of their endeavors whether it be favors, money, or something to leverage themselves further. But how will we, as a country move on forward with confidence and trust towards those who govern us when betrayal is in the table? When the nation’s interests aren’t fulfilled? When they are the sole reason we can’t get ourselves out of this damning rut? Perhaps this 21st century we ask, if there is a 22nd century will the Filipinos then, be able to live a better life? Because I have seen enough to say that in my lifetime at least, it’s never going to get any better.Suffice to say, I loved this film. I availed of the ₱ 250.00 discount allowed for students and teachers, and I did not feel like I wasted money at all. If we talk about the technical aspects like: the direction, music, composition, casting, and wardrobe, they were all perfect. You’ll never think throughout watching that they chickened out with giving Quezon (2025) huge production value. In a time where corruption is rampant in Philippine politics, well in retrospect it has always been, this film could not be any more relevant and timely.

Quezon,"Jerrold Tarog closes his Bayaniverse trilogy with Quezon, a sharp, ambitious political drama that trades the gunfire of Heneral Luna and Goyo for quieter battles fought through charm, rhetoric, and image.Jericho Rosales completely disappears into the role, giving a performance that’s both commanding and unsettling. He plays Quezon not as a spotless hero but as a man who understands how leadership relies on performance. The film doesn’t glorify him; it examines him. It shows how charisma can inspire and manipulate at the same time, and how power often hides behind elegance.The movie looks beautiful, with careful production design, steady pacing, and clean editing that keeps even long political exchanges engaging. Tarog’s direction is thoughtful and confident, peeling back Quezon’s myth not to tear it down but to reveal the man underneath that’s ambitious, flawed, and burdened by what it takes to lead.Seen at SM City Dasmariñas",19/10/2025,positive,0.991965055,0

Quezon not as a flawless hero, but as a complex, ambitious individual, gives the film a bracingly fresh tone. The production design, pacing and cinematography all feel meticulously crafted, it’s clear the team sought to challenge the idea of grand national myth and instead expose the power-games behind it. In doing so, Quezon invites us to see how legacy is manufactured, and how leadership is as much performance as service. I found the portrayal compelling and the moral ambiguity rich, making the film more than just a biopic.

Quezon,"While considered polarizing, I still do appreciate the storytelling. I have a lot of thoughts on this as well as it's parallels to the ""Hamilton"" Broadway Musical, but I shan't divulge further. The only thing I would change about this is the use of the silent film aesthetic. At first, I liked it because it brought something new to the table and did tie well to the artistic intent to the film but as it went on, I felt like it somehow lost the plot. I felt like it didn't capture well which parts were reflective of the ""film"" and which ones were the supposed ""actual"" occurences. It was only at the end where I felt it become harmonious with the other two films in the series because of the familiar feeling it invoked. Maybe what I really wanted to get from the film was to viscerally understand the history it focuses on. How does it's overall storytelling differ from how I would read it from a textbook? How will an unbiased journalist portray it without being propaganda-like?Nonetheless, I loved the movie!

Glad to have watched this in the theater! —Nung una I was quite disappointed sa unang part, na parang preamble, pero I guess that’s just how they make use of the time.I like how they portrayed Quezon: a politician through and through: knows how to play a game, used PR, used ads, used propaganda. Technically he has the charisma (mestizo), uniqueness (maybe because mestizo nga, not as Filipino, Filipino), nerve – because in the movie he portrays really going after what he wants, and talent — he rose above the ranks from lawyer to president. I didn’t see him as a bad person, but as a politician, so technically a bad person. Lol.We can see the portrayal and effect of media, and its relationship to politicians. The connections, the benefits might really impair the judgement, and of course, the want to survive life with a job that brings food to the table. But I like that at the end, the media is aware of its rile and at the same time, still aware of its principles once awakened to see whats happening.I like a quote about idolizing person that you may be blinded — ugh, I hope to capture the whole thing when it’s online. I can awfully relate because it’s also applicable to love.I like the movie overall and it’s worth watching for.

Quezon,"Me and my friends were like seven minutes late to the cinema because of the ticket line which was. Devastating. I missed the first few scenes, which I think included JC Santos, and that just ruined the experience for me a little. You have no idea how sad that makes me. I kept thinking about it the whole time. Anyway. I really love the cinematography, the music, the production design, the pacing, everything. This movie felt so beautiful and put together. The colors and composition reminded me of Wes Anderson in a way and that was such a joy to look at. I always love a good non-linear story so that was extra fun to watch too, though I didn’t fully get it at first because I didn’t get to see the first few scenes. >:(I’ve always loved how Tarog uses Joven to tell the story so now, the use of Joven’s daughter’s film as a storytelling device really got me. The documentary (??) bits were one of my favorite parts. So Charlie Chaplin. I really loved that. The script was also really well written and the way the actors delivered them was so on-point. Most of them are some of my favorite actors too. Rusca got recast which made me sad for a minute because he was my favorite in Heneral Luna, but then I found out the old actor was actually a horrible person, so um. Sucks.The yaoification of Quezon and Osmeña is... interesting. They always find a way to make these movies seem a bit gay. Interesting. So. I think this movie is way better than Goyo because that one honestly bored me (I know the quiet aesthetic was intentional but I didn't like it okay). But Heneral Luna is still my favorite. Luna’s story just hits harder. But yh, this one still feels stronger in terms of the technical stuff. It's very neat and I can't wait to rewatch it. I think this would be 10x better after the 2nd watch.I don’t know much about history, so I really enjoy watching movies like this. So much stuff to learn.

Quezon,"​""Bakit siya ang pinagpala ng mabuting kalagayan? Hindi ba nila kilala kung sino ako? I am Manuel Luis Quezon! I am the Filipino People! I am the Philippines!""​The final lines of the film perfectly encapsulate the kind of person Manuel Luis Quezon was—a power-hungry, manipulative, all-knowing, chameleon king.​Tarog's portrayal of Quezon displayed him as a human being; a being with his own selfish greeds and desires. Books and documentaries would often portray Quezon as nothing but a ""perfect president,"" so shedding light on him as a trapo will definitely have his relatives shaking their heads at the representation.​Heroes were often depicted as nothing but that—perfect, heroic, symbols of peace and protection. However, in Tarog's final installment of the Bayaniverse Trilogy, he portrayed Quezon under a different lens: he was portrayed as imperfect, flawed. Quezon was sick, twisted, and outwardly selfish—something that made him stand out from Goyo and Luna. (Btw, my memory could be serving me wrong.) Goyo and Luna were portrayed as these ""sacrificial"" heroes whose actions were driven by their patriotism and love for the country. Quezon, however, was not. His actions were driven by his need to have and stay in power. As mentioned, ""Mauuna pang pumuti ang uwak kaysa mawalan ka ng kapangyarihan, Quezon"" for he did anything and everything in his power to ensure that he was never in a position of no power.​Quezon was terrifying for how ""real"" he is in this day and time. He was able to manipulate the people by abusing the Filipino's belief of utang na loob—and he used that as ammunition in every political war, which ultimately led to his victory. Another factor was how Quezon curated his image of ""perfection"" by utilizing his connections to the fullest—even going as far as trampling over the livelihood and well-being of the people if it meant staying in power. He used people at his disposal, all the while maintaining a picture-perfect image to the media and the people.​Quezon is terrifying because while he may not have been fighting armies on the war zones, he was pulling the strings from the best seat in the house.",29/10/2025,positive,0.780765533,0

Quezon,"Watched Heneral Luna one time ago and never seen Goyo (but willing to watch after). Quezon is the final film from TBA's Bayniverse. It honestly feels like a satisfying conclusion to its said trilogy. I was never known to be interested in early Philippine history. I watched this because it's a film that's highly anticipated nationwide. I was really impressed by how the film goes from Manuel's early life through films, and how his life is in turmoil through the battle for independence. However, the film explores his desire for deception to gain much power to become the second president of the Philippines. Something so sinister that I understand that's how Jerrold interpreted it based on facts about Quezon's ""game"".Every aspect in every scene resembles the reality we still have. We're still in a developed country, which is not surprising to say the least. We're humans playing by the rules and laws. But for our country, it's what we live for.I adored how the film opens, but then I get a bit overwhelmed afterward. Thankfully, I was able to connect the dots on what's happening. I was blown away by the visuals, production set, and its ensemble cast of this film. It's truly amazing to see those in a Philippine film. Although, the sound mixing and camera work felt they needed to fill up on some scenes. Almost to make this film perfect.Now, the film Quezon became a national debate, thanks to one of Quezon's descendants at the Q&A post-screening. He stated that the film affected him, claiming it's a satire rather than a biopic. And he's not the only one; a few of Quezon's families are also affected by the film afterward. Many hated, many defend. It is very common to see this happening in every biopic film ever made. Filmmakers create a film based on a real-life figure, followed by credible sources available. Despite that, you will never escape from any person who knows a real-life figure because they don't provide you with any consideration before the film was made. To respond to that fiasco, I dare to say that this film is worth watching for everybody who's not interested in or complains about it. The disclaimer says it all, and yet they roared for a boycott. But as long as Quezon tells you exactly what the director and writers had envisioned, the film is the representation of our struggle to handle our country due to lies and deception.",29/10/2025,positive,0.96172291,0

Quezon,"Just watched Quezon. I want to start by saying I think Filipino films are not quite my jam, unfortunately.I wanted to like this. It had its moments, and I get the idea it wanted to convey.Quezon is a depiction of how Americans influenced Philippine politics into what it is today—for better or worse (mostly worse). It was not a good painting of Manuel Quezon by any means.I grew up not really minding Philippine presidents. Quezon, for me, felt like a decent person, someone who was deeply connected with the US—President of the Commonwealth. The film depicted him as a sneaky politician who would do everything to stay in power. He was charismatic and had a way with his words and aura. Unfortunately, the whole time I felt like I missed much more nuance in him. I felt his characterization was too one-sided; it seemed like he was used as a plot point to get a point across. The film was actually confusing to follow at first due to the differing timelines.The problem with political films is that they tend to be biased from a certain point of view. This felt like one of those films. I wished I had seen a complex character—one who is a lion when he needs to be but perhaps also a person who genuinely believed in something.This was my first entry in the 'bayaniverse' by Tarog. Perhaps most of what was depicted was true, but I think it left out some of the important parts of what made Quezon a fascinating Filipino president.I did like the heart of what it wanted to depict. We live in a political regime where corporations are the boss and the leaders do things to stay in power—not for the people.The acting was not that good. They hired a 'for the money' American actor, and the leads did not feel authentically Filipino. Or maybe the writing was just mid.",23/10/2025,positive,0.695896506,0

But I am glad that it's sparked even more conversations between my family and I about figures and events in Philippine history that are basically repeating themselves in the present. Also, it helps to have a huge movie star attached to an otherwise flawed but still pretty entertaining story at the heart of Jerrold Tarog's latest addition to the Bayani-verse.

Quezon,"I am the Philippines The third installment of Tarrogs' Bayaniverse explores on Manuel L Quezon as a four part film; The Hero, The Great Political Player, and the lobbyists towards the Philippines' Independence.Unlike the first two films which focus on the fight for a Revolutionary Government, Quezon, sets up a new story toward nation building translated to themes of power and play in the political arena(of which parallels to the existing political patterns of Philippine Politics). The good points of the film would be the idea of a film within a film; how media was an excellent medium to portray the two sides of Quezon as the Hero and the Trapo(traditional politician). Jericho Rosales did and excellent execution portraying someone who despite being narcissistic and intelligent gentleman you can't help but to love the guy.Another good point was the role Joven Hernando as the main protagonist guised as a side character which has been consistent on all three films. The role of Joven, a fictional character meant to symbolize the viewers but my interpretation would also be the youth who are seeking for truth. Joven meaning youth in Spanish is an excellent name for the character inviting the youth to critically think and discern for a more Independent Philippines.This last installment,while it stirs controversy on the portrayal of President Manuel L.Quezon, opens a fresh perspective how we can further improve our flawed system To quote the late President MLQ""I would rather have a government run like hell by Filipinos,than run like heaven by Americans, because no matter how bad a Filipino Government might be, we can always change it""",28/10/2025,positive,0.984110475,0

Now it makes sense why the other movie has Quezon's Game. Basically and literally MLQ knows how to play his A-game. Madumi ang sistema ng politika. Kung gusto mo ng kapangyarihan, alyansa, at lakas — rurumihan mo at gagawa ka ng pangalan dahil nga ang sistema ng politiko sa ating bansa ay naghahangad tayo na mga leader na may 'messianic' dahil tayo ay lugmok sa mapang-alipustang sistema. Quezon's took that mindset kaya mabilis siya nakahanap ng propaganda.

Being an American Foreign-National (though coming from Philippine parentage) residing in the Philippines, I was amazed to have realized that I came into the movie with more than a rudimentary knowledge of modern Philippine History. This movie excelled in portraying President Quezon in a very ""larger-than-life"" person (who historically was very much so). Yet, at the same time, the movie seems to convey the impression that many artistic liberties were taken to make the movie more entertaining rather than to be a more historic portrayal of the real Quezon. Notwithstanding, the movie does not shy away from asking ground-breaking questions such as ""How far will one go to ensure the independence of a nation?""",27/10/2025,positive,0.983958602,0

Quezon,"There are different entry points on how to read Quezon. Perhaps the most urgent for me to look at, is its distribution and promotion — how its coining of ""Bayaniverse"" has transmuted to multiple efforts of sustaining its captured audience from Heneral Luna (2015) and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2018). In these ongoing attempts of serving its captured audience, Quezon has both failed and served them at best. By constantly challenging and deconstructing our ideals of heroism, Quezon has to eventually hurt the Pinoy pride, which I personally found an achievement. Sometimes, to offend the audience is to serve them best. By structuring a film (or films) within the film, Quezon mirrors what many of us refuse to see and can't yet actively confront, that our eventual participation in the culture of patronage politics has built the Duterte - Marcosverse.Meanwhile, I couldn't help but realize that Goyo is actually my favorite of the 3.

Jericho Rosales’s portrayal of Manuel Quezon is, for the most part, spot-on and convincingly delivered—he truly understood the assignment.

Quezon,"I appreciate how this film challenges the notion of being a “Bayani” differently compared to Heneral Luna (2015) and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2018).The film isn’t afraid to show that Manuel L. Quezon was a deeply flawed and problematic person despite all his achievements and contributions in helping the Philippines understand and reach independencia.(Random funny side note: It tickles my brain every time they say “independencia,” and when they curse in Filipino with their thick accents.)It’s necessary to have narratives like this every once in a while because people tend to put others on pedestals and perceive them as flawless and ideal individuals. This is dangerous because idolatry leads to leniency, leniency leads to conformity, and conformity leads to collapse.Everything breaks down when we put the weight and responsibility of an entire country on one person alone, instead of recognizing that it also takes an entire nation’s worth of people to create change.This story is socially relevant not only because of our current political landscape here in the Philippines, but also as a reminder of the importance of looking back on our history to ensure we never repeat the mistakes of the past.The film is also masterfully crafted on a technical level and is arguably the best in the Bayaniverse so far. The direction, cinematography, editing, staging, musical score, and performances from the entire cast. They all shine here. Every single department that worked on this film fired on all cylinders, and it shows.There is also a level of playfulness present here (Mostly because of the score, staging, and performances) in the film that I really appreciate. It’s like a new flavor being introduced for the Bayaniverse and I welcome it very much.It was exceptionally made and definitely one of my favorite films of 2025.

In this one, it wasn't even subtle in its way of putting a light on the Americans. This was especially evident with Leonard Wood.

Quezon,"Of all the Bayaniverse movies, Quezon (2025) is arguably the most polarizing. I'll try my best to condense my thoughts, organizing them based on meta analysis, historical truth, and social commentary.In its most meta, Quezon (2025) stands to subvert audience expectations with its characterization of Manuel L. Quezon. In Tarog's previous films, he sought to shed a more sympathetic light on misunderstood figures of Philippine history. Portraying Luna as a passionate and enlightened man, Goyo as misguided and young, and even Aguinaldo as complex and misunderstood. However, how could he showcase the story of a man who's well-beloved by a nation? It's in the best interest of many to concede that although polarizing, Quezon being characterized as the progenitor of patronage politics is on brand for Dir. Tarog. Luna and Goyo were already established by key aspects of their stories, either by being hot-headed or accomplished and young. Jerrold Tarog's brand has been to take what the audience may know and provide a different perspective, thus explaining Quezon's diva tantrums and arrogance. However, the question remains—Is it historically accurate? From my understanding of the film, Tarog already sought to answer those questions within the film itself. Accuracy and truth is greatly influenced by the filmmaker, her patron, and even preexistent ideas of who a person is. History is not my career, thus I can't provide a professional opinion on its accuracy. What I can say, however, is that if Tarog's own opus is be trusted—he, the director, is merely a man. He is not infallible and thus, the truth as he knows it, may not entirely be what it is. Historical accuracy cannot simply be based on its costuming and subtle details in props, but also the integrity of the story itself. Lastly, the movie is obviously a very nail-on-the-head commentary on politicians whose personal ambitions are hid thinly behind a persona of nationalism. It feels like a jab against growing populist sentiments, but antagonizes the greedy who sought to reap its benefits with little sincerity. It explores how the formula for gaining power as an ambitious, dynastic politician has never really changed in the past century or so. Unless the people themselves are willing to start questioning the integrity of the people they sought to empower with their votes, for every disgraced politician another corrupt politician will take his place. Perhaps I'm reading too much into this, but Quezon (2025) feels like some sort of cinematic social experiment that Jerrold Tarog gave us. He's seen the power of Heneral Luna and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, perhaps this is just him leaving a movie that's on-purposely polarizing so that the people can be forced to think about the credibility of everything they see. Even if not his intention, it's great to see this play out.The movie was enjoyable and the stylistic difference definitely ties into how we're in a brand new era of Philippine history. I'm hoping to see a similar thing be done with any of his future works ",24/10/2025,positive,0.822590828,0

Quezon is portrayed to have learned the worst of the political game from the Americans. Effective? Incredibly so. Honorable? Nope.I had to pull up some recordings of him afterwards, Rosales absolutely nailed his cadence. The acting here was incredible. The cinematography some of the best I've seen from a Filipino movie. And best of all, it LOOKED like a movie. This was cinematic.And surprising for a political biopic, this was a blast. It was hilarious. It didn't take itself too seriously (or seriously at all, really).Maybe those more familiar with the story will be annoyed by the heavy use of exposition, but I found it to be helpful. I'm not here to shit on anyone else's national heroes—I've got plenty of American historical figures I can do that to. But, this does do a great job of depicting how Quezon's style of politicking, and selling off his country's resources to the highest bidders, seems to have led to the rampant levels of corruption seen today, 100 years later.Added to My Filipino Film Diary",27/10/2025,positive,0.976592779,0

Quezon,"A scathing and surprisingly humorous indictment of Quezon and his supposedly scummy character, so much so that it enters caricature territory, but I'm reminded of Tarrog's overarching project of interrogating what a bayani means. This is supported further by the dimension that the film adds to Aguinaldo who was a clear villain in ""Heneral Luna."" There's a dearth of (good) films about history and politics in mainstream contemporary Filipino film, so I was pleased to see some unconventional editing and cinematographic choices here that are more common in foreign biopics. The incorporation of the silent film was a clever device all around – a way to deepen the fictional Joven's story while beefing up the commentary on media as a tool of propaganda, a cost-cutting yet effective touch on the artificiality of celebrity politics, a self-aware reflection on how history is written by the victors. Rosales' transformation is a thrill to watch and a testament to the ripening of his craft but I was also really captivated by Sarmienta's performance. Sometimes the script sounds like it's lifted from a HEKASI textbook but it's forgivable for people like me who need the refresher course.",27/10/2025,positive,0.979379535,0
Quezon,"With memorable performances from the cast, compelling storytelling, and masterful direction, Quezon (2025) deserves to stand and be praised on its own. Still it’s best viewed as the final installment to the Bayaniverse trilogy. In this lens, we really see Jerrold Tarog’s thesis throughout the series: “Ang pagkabayani, it’s all about perception.”Heneral Luna (2015) showed a hero with unrivaled passion and patriotism. John Arcilla’s Luna is a hero people wanted to rally behind and emulate. He was branded as a leader who could have saved the Philippines, if not for the infighting between the revolutionaries. Yes, he was a flawed character, but you wanted to root for him. Never mind that he never won a battle – his profound love of country made up for it. The timing of the film also couldn’t be more perfect — it was released during an intense rise in populism. The film arguably contributed to Rodrigo Duterte winning the 2016 presidential elections, but that’s another story.Goyo: The Boy General (2018) was more subdued. There was no way to replicate Luna’s fiery personality and Arcilla’s performance as a cussing, temperamental general, so it was only natural to take another approach. Paulo Avelino gave life to the young, inexperienced boy general. In history classes, Goyo was often described as a martyr who died for his beloved country. The film portrayed his conflict – was he really loyal to his country or only to Aguinaldo? Was his sacrifice heroism or blind servitude?Quezon depicted a trapo’s rise to power. Jericho Rosales’ Quezon showed ability to pull all the tricks in the book: propaganda, lying, self-serving alliances, politicking, patronage politics. He wasn’t the first to do them (and we know from our daily experiences now that he’s not the last), but he no doubt mastered them. Describing him as a chameleon was an understatement. Always performing and projecting what the other side wants him to be.More importantly, Quezon brought the trilogy’s thesis full circle. The film, like the two before it, argues that heroism is not black and white. “Ang pagkabayani, it’s all about perception.”The film within a film device effectively blurred the lines between reality and fiction. The switching between different Quezons (the old version, the young version, the fictionalized young version), the nonlinear storytelling and changing perspectives, further served to confuse the audience about objective history and revisionist recollection.But the film’s biggest and most-rewarding bet is making Joven Hernando (the audience surrogate) an active participant to the story. By showing that he can be swayed by narratives, blinded by his own biases, be bought, but ultimately speak truth to power, the challenge is flipped back to the viewer. How should we view heroes? When we know that they “get their hands dirty” with politics; they forge convenient alliances; they stage publicity stunts; they do everything not for the greater good, but to push their own ambitions. How should we question our leaders and speak truth to power when we can also benefit from them if only we played our cards right?Looking at the trilogy as a whole, it is clear that our heroes, despite their contributions to the nation, are flawed individuals. Despite their larger-than-life personas, they are just people too. Like us. The whole time we were focused on the titular characters, on supposed saviors we have preconceived perceptions on. But this conclusion just reminded us we ought to look at ourselves and our relationship with these heroes too.",18/10/2025,positive,0.967779279,0

It took me a beat to remember who Joven Fernando was because it's been so long since I saw the two earlier films, but once I remembered it made me appreciate the decision to insert an audience avatar into this remix of Philippine history. It's not a perfect film and it leans too heavily on exposition several times (e.g. one character notably sketches Quezon's pre-presidential career in the space of a minute, as if he were reading from a Wikipedia entry), but as a whole I enjoyed the creative decisions made and the liberties taken. The best thing about it, by far, is the performances by its cast. Jericho Rosales, Cris Villanueva, Romnick Sarmenta, and Mon Confiado in particular were wonderful to watch.

I remember learning about the Tydings–McDuffie Act back in sixth grade and wishing we could explore it more deeply but was ultimately met with disappointment when we only touched on it briefly before moving on to another topic. That being said, hearing familiar names and events in this movie made me geek out so much. More than that, I truly appreciated how it gave a deeper look into Quezon’s life and not just his role in our history. I liked that the film showed his flaws and his “dark games,” making him feel more real and human.Without giving away any more spoilers, this film is both thought-provoking and relevant today. It leaves us with something important to reflect on: to question, to stay aware, and to take an active role in shaping our nation.

This use of cinema itself as a device to propel the narrative forward makes it compelling, seamlessly blurring the lines between fact and fiction, much like how the main characters easily manipulate these concepts.Despite clearly steering away from the literal warfare of the previous two installments, the film still manages to grip audiences through a high-stakes chess match between the titular character and his rivals.",26/10/2025,positive,0.991984308,0

Quezon,"Had a great time with this and it's a refreshing injection of optimism for the Philippine cinema scene. Love that our theater was packed and our audience was constantly engaged with every bit of dialogue, every Rosales enunciation, and every plot turn - the theater experience definitely amplified it. I cannot emphasize how lovely it is how this film ignited film discourse that I haven't felt about a local movie in a while since Heneral Luna.Jerrold Tarog's direction and screenplay with Rody Vera feel so ambitious in its approach to this type of film. The confidence seeps through every scene and how we're carried through scene by scene through its Hollywood level production design, editing, costume design, and unique biographical structure. Always been wowed at the idea of Joven Hernando and who he represents and this is all the more captivating as what transpires in this film. I felt like it may have some minor pacing issues that don't really tank the movie but it might've helped to have certain scenes/sequences a bit tighter.Jericho Rosales makes up for not looking like Casey through his fantastic line deliveries and not breaking a sweat while embodying this fascinating gray area of a man. Confiado (loved his presence very extra this time), Eusebio, and Villanueva also give fantastic turns as mostly returning cast members while Kris Villanueve takes over Joven easily. I missed you in this one, Epy as Mabini.As the emphatic period to TBA Studios' highly impressive Bayaniverse trilogy, it felt appropriate enough to lean more into the Oppenheimer-esque epic tale as opposed to just giving us another Luna story. This is not an action-packed war flick but rather a captivating portrait of political power plays, American colonial dynamics, and the roots of so many of our problems today. I'm sure there's more to take away from it and I'm going to continue browsing the internet to find out what else - that's what makes this movie-loving thing so much fun.",24/10/2025,positive,0.997735381,0

Quezon,"WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW.Can't believe that's the conclusion of the Bayaniverse trilogy, a mere transition from the violent Revolution to the ego-driven politics.From the epic and fierceness of Heneral Luna, from the heartbreak and beautiful sights of Goyo, now to the perception of heroism through Quezon.Echo really killed this role, alongside Sarmenta, Villanueva, Confiado, and Sir Iain Glen.He really is one helluva egoist ngl. Love the callbacks to the previous films, the flashback scenes of our previous leads, the callback to the ""Ang tao may damndamin ay hindi alipin."" scene and the fierce energy and the tons of PI and PYTA based from Heneral Luna, the quotes from Pule (Mabini) and the beautiful color grading from Goyo, and notable characters from the respective films!I feel like theres gonna be fanfics about 70 (Quezon x Osmeña). They had such chemistry in this film more than their spouses.Throughout the Bayaniverse, this just shows that in history, there are no heroes and villains, just humans with flaws. From each film, we learn about each characters' traits and flaws that are something we can learn from them. Like our fav character throughout the trilogy, Joven Hernando, we are the observants, observing the two sides of a coin of each sides. Our voice may be silent as we watch, but the truth and the voice we yearn for is loud.What a nice conclusion to the trilogy, thank you TBA and Direk Jerrold Tarog for giving us great movies that we can go back and learn all about our country's history.

May fave character since HL. Kaso dito for some reason parang di na siya yung eyes nating viewers, parang part na talaga siya ng current cast. Di ko makuha yung Joven vibes kahit nandito yung actor na gumanap sa last 2 movies. Isa pa, parang under utilized siya sa ending. Yung anak niyang si Nadia parang cutout from that era talaga. May vibes siyang ganon ang ganda ng pagkakacast. Di ko magets yung cameo ni Cong at Iza. Ang random. Yung kay Iza parang iisipin mo na may malaki siyang character sa past movies dahil sa reaction niya pero wala naman??? Si Cong akala mo di solid north eh. Medyo nakakaawa si Aguinaldo dito. Lalo na nung pinaalis siya sa farm at tinanggalan ng pension. Dumi ni Quezon. Pero katulad niya mga pulitiko ngayon. Medyo nakakamiss Mabini-Aguinaldo tandem sa movie na 'to. Sayang deads na si Mabini, nakakamiss presence niya. Galing ni Jericho Rosales. Biggest what if si TJ Trinidad eh pero galing din naman ni Echo.

No matter which angle you look at it, the film portrayed a negative and unflattering image of Quezon during his lifetime.From his beginnings as a lawyer, to his time as governor of Tayabas, Senate President, and eventually as President — the movie showed how deeply rooted traditional politics was, even back then. Maybe they were the ones who started it; the methods may have changed over time, but the goal remained the same — to gain and keep power.It’s hard to accept that our own ancestors might have been the ones who taught us how to become monsters in the world of politics — corrupt and power-hungry. But hopefully, this film serves as an eye-opener for all of us — a reminder not to repeat the same history.

Kitang kita mo yung malaking budget na meron para dito and this should set the standard of a filipino biopic. Production design was so good, ganda din ng script, hindi pilit yung dialogue and it wasnt cringe to hear the actors speak unlike sa dialogue ng heneral luna LOL. Galing din ni jericho rosales pati yung mga white actors (minsan kase di rin magaling yung mga puting actors na pinipili nila dati). Honestly didnt expect to like this kase i really didnt like the previous movies, but this is really a huge step from heneral luna. And i also liked that the film didnt spoon feed everything to the audience. Yan din kasi problema sa mainstream filipino movies ngayon, wala nang room for artistic expression, bigay lang ng bigay for the sake of pleasing the masses. This movie did a really good job in doing the opposite. Anyways, gets ko naman din yung apo ni quezon kase if my lolo was portrayed as a snake, id crash out too ",26/10/2025,positive,0.959769487,0

Quezon,"“I got one more in me,” exclaimed Jerrold Tarrog as he laid the finishing touches of his 3rd film in this ironically-titled Bayaniverse.Wilfredo Garrido has this scathing accusation that Quezon in its entirety is a hackjob in itself. It's very easy to glean the bias from which his status update after watching the film errs on, and I feel the need to start from this note because by no means does the film really sit on the fence.In fact, and if I may declaratively highlight in all its fictional and non-fictional aspects, Quezon sits as one of Jerrold Tarog's best pieces for being able to angle this part of history in a way never really seen. The recurring clamor for a film that talks of the Philippine Commonwealth has been something desired of, and Quezon being able to position itself in this manner is a welcome one.At the end of the day, one is left sitting at Quezon and possibly thinking about how the Philippine government is fundamentally a government of demons of all shapes and sizes. If you come out of this film arguing that the film itself makes Aguinaldo look like a saint (someone on Twitter says this), you may want to rewatch Heneral Luna as the center of all this is a series of heroes who are profoundly individual at their core, espousing social values and claiming to be champions of the greater good.Addendun: Raymond Red during a talkback of his Bayani (1992) screening earlier recalls the uproar he faced from the academic community for being the first to depict Aguinaldo as a piece of shit. In a way, history corrects itself down the line and one could only glean that reception towards Quezon will face the same developments.",26/10/2025,positive,0.866185963,0
Quezon,"I had the chance to experience watching this film in the Cinemas. Jericho Rosales as Quezon didn't disappoint, as well as the other actors. I love cinematic scene shown at first, the silent film theme one made by Nadia where he was portrayed as a good guy for his campaign, even though the contents of it are far from truth and how we're watching from Joven's perspective because the contents of the film revisiting Quezon before entering politics and during it is all in a film made by Nadia, a second version with more truth contrasting what she had made for his Ninong for Presidential Campaign. My thoughts on this film is that they executed the film really well. It showed their flaws, not just their good side. I like Joven Hernando's character, he's a fictional character but represent us really well. All of his lines really aligns with what the audience thinks when watching the film. From supporting and believing Quezon to questioning him and eventually criticizing him. It also reminded me of how Schools always teach and portrayed them as great heroes, but never really show what's behind the door. Osmeña's character is someone easily swayed with sweet words and Quezon took advantage of that, leading, swaying him with his words even though they've had their own disputes—rivalry turned allies. Roxas's character is like a child, easy to be pawn. Quezon's character was portrayed as someone good at playing a game at politics, he knows how to play his cards very well; using every tactic and opportunities just like how he used Patriotism and Independence as a Propaganda. They also showed Quezon's side being a Womanizer and portrayed him as someone always concerned with good image in the public—although his bad side was shown, it still wouldn't erase the great things he did but it's refreshing to see that this film didn't glorify anyone. It instead showed that even these people in the end of the day are Humans. They're not perfect or saints, they have their own flaws. You can also see how our government back then still mirrors our present government. Corruption isn't new, it has always been there. There's a lot of things that you can realize watching this film, I wouldn't really rely on it for accuracy, after all it's mixed with fiction, myths and certain rumours for humour, that's why it's still better to research thoroughly. Overall this is a great film, Jerold Tarog and Tba Studios never disappoint!

Quezon,"Body and soul?Jerold Tarog's ""Quezon"" narrates a period of our history that mirrors the current state of politics in the country. Men in power takes advantage of the other men in the circle and, when its not convenient anymore, easily, casually dropping them dead. History, almost 100 years ago, is repeating itself. The dirty tricks, power-hunger, and betrayal that happened under the Commonwealth government employed by President Quezon are not new to me. My history lessons, albeit shallow, have taught me that while we recognize the efforts of our forefathers, they were after all human and susceptible to corruption. It is politics afterall. What surprised me tho is how this part of the country's history was presented through this film. The cinematography, sound production, and set designs, and of course the acting (especially Jericho Rosales) were beautifully blended considering the theme of politics and history.

What did it aim to achieve after that?For me, it merely opened up a controversy without offering any resolution. It’s similar to hearing endless news about corruption in the country without actually seeing justice served. Has anyone even been jailed yet?After tarnishing Quezon’s name and linking him to the culture of political patronage and under-the-table negotiations, what was the movie really calling for? This is one of the things I find lacking in the film.I was also confused about Jericho’s acting choices and the director’s decisions regarding narration. I understand that comedy can be an effective way to deliver a message in a relatable manner, but to me, the message—still unclear—was blurred by the slapstick. Tarog's disclaimer at the beginning and his response to Quezon's grandchild also did not help in his attempt to convey his message.And really, is that an attempt to give redemption to Aguinaldo?",25/10/2025,negative,0.681199431,0

Quezon,"This film was exhausting to watch. I'm not saying it's not good, more like I was the one getting tired for MLQ. All that intelligence used to claim power. Gosh. As a Social Sciences teacher, it didn't occur to me the extent of greed some people could have. This is a good retelling of a piece from our history. Slowly, through films and discussions, I believe we can complete our historical panorama. It's scary though, because this film has been injected with bits of fiction already (like the existence of Joven), so it worries me that other Filipinos would take it as it is.

Quezon,"Wrapping up a trilogy about the Philippines' revolutionary past with a relatively uneventful political biopic about some unremarkably corrupt politician really is a bold and interesting choice. Moreover, Quezon really is a rejection of the two films that came before.By no fault of its own, Heneral Luna is one of the most misunderstood and bastardized cautionary tales about patriotism and masculinity I've seen in my lifetime. Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral is a bitter demolition of the mindless jingoism and fascism that Heneral Luna became synonymous with. Finally, Quezon is a eulogy to the Philippines' revolutionary hopes and idealism; a resignation to a pathetic country's inescapable doom under so-called Great Men and self-proclaimed patriots.Problem is, Quezon is also the weakest of the trilogy from a structural level. Its transition from a winking mockery of the cosmic joke that is Filipino government to the bleak demystification of Quezon's self-made myth isn't as smooth as it could've been. The film's dragging length is impossible to deny by the midway point, though it's understandable given how long Quezon's story is. Worst of all, a literal half of Quezon's dialogue is a preachy lecture told at the audience. More than once, characters stop everything to become mouthpieces for the ideologies they represent and the timely commentary they embody. None of this is diegetic, and it's as awkward as it sounds. I also don't really jive with how the film ends by blaming the Filipinos for things and bastards they can't control. I too am disillusioned, but come on now with this ivory tower shit.Then again, after seeing how Heneral Luna's point was deliberately ignored, used to prop up a murderous shithead, then basically losing a decade in the process, I'm not too surprised by Quezon treating Filipino viewers like a bunch of gullible idiots who need everything to be spoon-fed at least twice.",25/10/2025,positive,0.50537461,0

Quezon,"2025 RankedTBA Studios RankedBACKGROUNDThis franchise is one of the most unique franchises out there by connecting Philippine historical films with each other into a singular cinematic universe, which is distinct from those that are fictional in nature. There are fictional elements in these films, but they are overall based on true events. It may not be as popular as other franchises that have existed for decades, but it does not have to be, considering that the number of movies are three so far. Regardless, it is still a franchise that I am going to look forward to for its next entry.POSITIVESThe gap between Quezon from the previous film, Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, is seven years, which could be a bit too long to wait, but it was worth it because I did not expect for the third installment to turn out to be the best in the franchise so far. The tone and style of filmmaking was different compared to its predecessors, which reflects how much Jerrold Tarog has grown as a filmmaker. The choice to use the early stages of film as a way to reflect and criticize him as a leader not only adds more creativity and style to the film but also reflects the phase of technology at the time, and how it can be used as a powerful tool to spread influence. The storytelling is not straightforward or linear, but it is organized into chapters based on who Manuel Quezon has to face or deal with in order to rise in power. It is an approach that I did not expect, but it is a success for being able to tell a cohesive story. Jericho Rosales's portrayal is one of the aspects that I was looking forward to seeing in the film, and he succeeded my expectations. He has so much command, control, and confidence in his performance. His enthusiasm and charisma match his goal to elevate his status by playing ""mind games"" with his opponents. This puts the audience in an unsettling position because it becomes clear the kind of leader Manuel Quezon was. There are moments that would make me feel the intensity and pressure as I am piecing out the next moves of each player and the events that could happen. The production design was impressive that made me wonder about how they were built or where they were located. I also admire the various use of cinematography like panning and tracking to make the film livelier and to set the tone.MIXEDI was really impressed by the editing of this film, but there is a particular scene where the editing did not work for me because I felt that it did not fit into its tone. This film has the most number of significant characters in the franchise and there are a lot of time jumps, which makes it a bit difficult to catch up with certain plotlines for me, but it is understandable because it reflects how complex and complicated the situations are.NEGATIVESDue to how plenty the characters are, some of them were not given enough depth. There are a few of lines of humor that did not work for me.CONCLUSIONIt is clear how the film wants Manuel Quezon to be portrayed, which they were able to accomplish. The tone and genre of this film may not be similar to the past films in the franchise like scenes involving gunshots, but its unique approach to the story makes it stand out from other Philippine historical films.",25/10/2025,positive,0.98435241,0

Kase di ko pa alam implications, di ko pa alam kung anong magiging epekto sa political landscape (kase diba tanda niyo General Luna nag enable kay duterte hahahahahahahah kaya nagiingat pa ko), di ko pa masyadong ma gauge kung saang politics nagle-lean, pero sobrang nag enjoy ako sa quezonI LOVE yung framing ng kwento using yung propaganda films nung anak ni joven to show flashbacks. Mej madali maintindiihan kung alin ang flashback at alin ang nangyayare in the presentI LOVE yung mga different chapters showing yung iba ibang girian ni quezon sa iba ibang mga characters, V impressive way para i-pace yung kwento ng pelikulaI LOVE how it (kinda) connected yung themes at hanging plot threads nung unang dalawang pelikula don sa narrative ng kwento, yung pag patay kay luna, yung pagiging flawed ng mga leaders. Yung character ni Joven. I LOVE how despite being a sequel nung Goyo at General Luna, SOBRANG SOBRANG IBA YUNG TONE NG PELIKULA IT'S INSANE. Its less grim and edgy and pessimistic, and more satirical and comedic. Siguro kase na umay ako sa MCU na lahat ng pelikula sa shared universe nila isang genre and tone lang. I LOVE na it almost explicitly depicts na masamang tao si quezon. Maybe need ko pa panoorin ulet para mas ma gauge, pero i didn't feel na fine frame ng story si quezon as ""flawed"". Sa comprehension ko, he's evil.I LOVE yung yung body and soul chapter. I think it's insane yung line na yon. BODY AND SOUL. Grabe chills ko. Traydor talaga.I LOVE LOVE LOVE YUNG ACTING WHAT THE FUCK. ESPECIALLY SI JERICHO WHAT. WHEN I THINK OF JERICHO, ANG NAIISEP KO IS YUNG PANGAKO SAYO, GREEN ROSE, MGA ROMANTIC ROLES NA LEADING MEN SIYA. Its insane, grabe yung portrayal ng unapologetic opportunitistic scumbag.This last one. Isa sa nitpick ko sa karamihan ng pelikula, parang plot delivery device lang. they just tell a story and nothing much else pero eto hindi ganon. yung paggamit ng comedy, creative shots at story framing, mga emotional setpieces atsaka editing. grabe, its very deliberate ayokong magpanggap na cinephile pero It's insane, it feels very professional, very deliberate.again, di pa ko sigurado sa magiging implications at epekto ng pelikulang to sa political landscape ng bansa, initial opinion ko palang to.

Quezon,"Gets ko si Joven. When you sit down and watch the film as it starts, highly likely you will suddenly be reminded of how Heneral Luna and Goyo went—the first two movies of Bayaniverse—and your expectation would somehow be related to those two. But Tarog did a different approach in Quezon, where satire is ultimately obvious, as much as it is also intended to be taken seriously. The fast-pace approach, the quick-changing of scenes, the conversations which aren't dragging, and riddles exchanged between the characters. These same characters delivered well and Tarog made sure the comedic stance are appropriately placed where necessary. It's just that for the majority of the time, I have this moment where the scenes are already at its peak, only to be steered in a different direction since, clearly, this film wants to tell more. I guess 2 hours will never be enough. I've always admired how he interpreted Luna and Goyo in a way that is culturally and politically provoking, yet easy to grasp, relate to, and branches out even more questions. Looking back at the Quezon film, it’s hard not to realize how little we’ve actually progressed as a country. We never truly learned. We forget too easily, and us being gullible, though partly not our fault, continues to hold us back. That's why it's vital that a fictional character like Joven Hernando comes in as a storyteller. We need a narrator that subtly contributes to the narrative, yet obviously part of it. He witnessed three generations of it all, with his perspective changing and honing, and revolving with the three personalities - Luna, Goyo, and now, Quezon. We are Joven. And would you ever disagree with Joven knowing that to our core, he is the representation of us all?Joven proved that as a nation, we want change. But individually? We really just wanted to survive, to focus on our families, to build our career around the things we love doing the most. At the same time, we want to see our country thrive, see it receive its deserved peace and rightful independence. We believe it's ours to begin with and no one should take that away from us. That's how us, Filipinos. We struggle to keep moving as a progressive nation because our minds are cut in half—in many pieces for some—because we have a lot to think about. Sa dulo ng bawat araw, karamihan sa atin gusto lang umuwi, magpahinga, at siguraduhing kinabukasan ay may pagkaing nakahain sa lamesa. Kaya gets ko si Joven. Kung nalinlang man siya, kung napaniwala man siya nila Luna, Goyo, at Quezon, at kung kumapit man siya sa kakarampot na pag-asa mula dun sa tatlo, hindi niya naman talaga kasalanan. Gaya ng karamihan, nagtiwala lang din siya. Kasi sino bang aayaw sa pangakong kalayaan para sa isang bansang inaabuso at kumakalam ang sikmura?As film goers, audience, and product of PH education, our role is to scrutinize and be doubtful, along with enjoying the film, because at the end of the day, a film remains a form of art, and art supposedly have its interpretation by whoever is looking at it.

Quezon,"Source: www.reeladvice.net/2025/10/quezon-2025-movie-review.htmlThe war is over, and now the battle is set in the world of politics. Quezon takes us front and center into the seemingly heroic life of Manuel L. Quezon - a personality Filipinos look up to as a hero, a visionary, and one of the nation’s key founders. But much like its predecessors in the Bayaniverse franchise, the film tackles head-on the sheer humanity and fallibility of Quezon, questioning whether the ends justify the means in the battlefield of power and the making of a young nation.Manuel L. Quezon (Jericho Rosales) has just won the 1935 elections, becoming the first elected Filipino president and the second president of the Philippines. But the journey to win that coveted and historically significant seat wasn’t an easy one, and you don’t get to the top without getting your hands dirty and making a few enemies along the way.On its third outing, the Bayaniverse comes full circle by slowly shifting from the action-packed Heneral Luna to a somber drama in Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral and finally to a full blown political drama in Quezon. The literal battles here are replaced by heated confrontations between Quezon and his contemporaries, showing how he fought and negotiated his way through power by any means necessary. While we can’t say for sure if every revelation in the film is historically accurate, this is far from the textbook version of Quezon we grew up with. This is a human Manuel Quezon up front and center. One who is charming, cunning, and deeply flawed. The film hits hard, especially when viewed against the backdrop of today’s political landscape, reminding us that the people we idolize are often far more complicated than their public images suggests.The film’s chapter-based narrative structure was something we appreciated, breaking down Quezon’s political battles into distinct segments. However, the pacing felt uneven at times, with one chapter taking up a disproportionate part of the runtime. In terms of performances, though, everyone delivered. Mon Confiado stood out as a somber, grounded Emilio Aguinaldo, while Jericho Rosales embodied Quezon’s ambition and deceitful charm perfectly. We found ourselves surprisingly invested in Quezon, and by the time the credits rolled, it hit us hard much like the other Bayaniverse films. Like before, it left questioning whether the struggles we face today were shaped by the same heroes we’ve long revered. As a potential bookend to the franchise, Quezon closes the trilogy in the way we hoped it would which is powerful, reflective, and important for Filipinos.",13/10/2025,positive,0.961828887,0

Quezon,"I think it's really best to now see all three films as one long project, all of it built around the deconstruction of the national hero. It is through that lens that the character of Joven finally makes sense, the trilogy's audience surrogate who attaches himself to these larger-than-life figures, only to witness their downfall. Joven believes in the Great Man: in the singular figures that will lead our nation out of the darkness. The film openly exposes that idea as foolhardy at best, because these Great Men are just people, too. And they're all deeply flawed individuals that just get their dirty laundry swept under the bed precisely because they feel like they could be our saviors.This third film is practically a farce, with Rosales' Manuel L. Quezon treating nationhood as a rigged game where only he can come out on top. He blatantly lies to his friends when it's convenient to do so, and accumulates power through every dirty trick in the politician's playbook. He is the Ur-TRAPO, basically creating the systems that would make TRAPOs an inescapable reality in the Philippines.Rosales is terrific here, his Quezon constantly performing for whoever's in front of him. He projects being a loyal ally, or a mentor, or a friend, or indeed the great savior of the Philippines. He plays that big, while in private moments Quezon is all vulnerability: a man who sees how delicate the house of cards he's built is, and worries about whether his health will allow him to see his dreams come to fruition.I do think the film has a tendency to overexplain, to have characters speaking the subtext out loud. But considering how some people took Heneral Luna, maybe this was always the tack to take. In any case, the film is unequivocal with how it wants us to see Quezon: he is what Chiz Escudero wants to be, and maybe what made Chiz Escudero possible. Welcome to our Sad Republic. Here's the guy that made it happen.",15/10/2025,positive,0.952153563,0
Quezon,"One McGuffin in the film is a Philippine peso coin that Quezon offers Joven the first time they meet. Quezon tells Joven, “pasisikatin ko ang pangalan mo,” “I will make your name famous.” It is offered as a symbol of promise. Later in the film, we understand that Quezon is a businessman and how we sees his wits as he steers money into his electoral campaign. Quezon knows how to invest in the hearts of the people he influences. He fully understands the weakness of Filipinos when it comes to “utang na loob” or debt of gratitude. We see this coin move between Quezon and Joven. Joven, who later finds out Quezon’s dirty tricks, returns the coin. In the last act, the coin is returned, becoming a powerful metaphor for the cost Filipinos pay when voting for leaders who manipulate their perception.Quezon is intriguing, comical at times, but otherwise compelling in that you’re hypnotized and drawn to the flipping of Quezon’s coin, who is on one side a hero, and on the other a flawed human being. We see him as a player, incisive in his chess pieces in Philippine politics. But also a sociopath when he deals with his cards in a game of poker with his enemies. The dialogue in the film never lets up, with pacing that keeps you glued to your seat. The film makes you love-hate the man, and Jericho Rosales’ performance stands out, supported by an impressive powerhouse cast.Overall, the film is witty and entertaining. The political play may be on the nose, but should not alienate a regular Filipino moviegoer. And should be able to provide a proper dissection of the politicians we placed in their positions, and a wake-up call to vote better in the next elections.see video version on Tiktok or Instagram @reyraymundv",13/10/2025,positive,0.969728231,0

Quezon,"The Bayaniverse films have always been about showing how these heroes, whom we have put up on a pedestal, are in reality very flawed humans as well. With ‘Quezon’ we not only see a very flawed human, but one that could have possibly set up the many political systems in play today. Jericho Rosales who plays the titular chameleon ‘Quezon’ brings his A game to the role. You can see his range with Quezon’s cunning smiles, and explosive anger. The entire cast is a powerhouse one as well, bringing their own strengths to their characters. Technically, I was impressed by how the film was shot, employing black and white film work to mimic films from the 1930s. The production design was also on point with the props and costumes used, even the set pieces were impressive. The story itself shows how Quezon, who might be seen as a hero, has some skeletons in his own closet, and even had some strings pulled to help his rise to power, the reveal is a treat, and even though this is already history, there was a scene where I had to hold my breath.",13/10/2025,positive,0.986230135,0

Of course, we felt cheated, beaten. When I returned the question to him, he sighed and said, “Well, sanay na kami.”Watching Quezon, that statement makes even more sense. The film is a mirror—almost like a satire—protesting to our faces what we’ve been enduring for years.We’re all familiar with the Filipino game of politics (brought to life first by our colonizers, if I may add), but seeing it up close through this film is heartbreaking.We are being played by our politicians, and though we feel it deeply today, it’s something that has persisted for years.

Quezon,"A pretty compelling dissection of the messiness of politics. Mind you there's some bits here I would have loved to have seen pared down-- some speeches here often read as plain and didactic as thesis statements and some visuals come across as painfully obvious. There's a lot of reiteration of the theme of games being played here in the pull for power, even down to, in one scene, a clear chessboard referenced in both dialogue and image in a moment of Quezon's play for power and assembly of political pieces. And to be honest, the whole idea of politics being a game is something that simply comes across as trite (I mean, there is already a biopic out there that exists called Quezon's Game).At the same time, you have to admire the ambition of just implementing those ideas so clearly on levels of craft and storytelling. On the whole this is a sumptuously put together film that manages to make a whole lot of talking deeply delightful. This is especially remarkable considering that A. Dialogue-heavy films can easily bore if pulled off improperly and B. Quezon as a person is a character that, in actuality, should come across as deeply uncompelling due to how awful he actually is as a person-- which the film does not shy away from. To tackle the former, some truly astounding filmmaking is on full display here, really playfully swinging that camera and injecting a constant sense of energy through the movement of visuals. And for the latter, this is simply a sharp, wise, and surprisingly comedic script that really sells in its details. Manuel Quezon ultimately is a mess of a human being, but the film really has a lot of fun examining how this man claimed power instead of resigning to singing praises on who this powerful person is. It becomes truly engaging, even clever as a film that dissects a man who is gifted and unmatched at negotiation and talking but ultimately is still acknowledged as deeply problematic. Other than that, the performances here really do a lot of heavy-lifting as well. Rosales makes a full meal of the material, really exuding effortless and entertaining charm. Confiado controls the screen whenever he appears. Ultimately, this is simply a delight to watch through and through. Which is pretty astounding for a film that is essentially just about a bunch of politicians bickering. Hey, tale as old as time.",15/10/2025,positive,0.987548709,0

Quezon,"Quezon (Jerrold Tarog, 2025) culminates the Bayani Trilogy that started with Heneral Luna and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral. The trilogy examines three historical (and controversial) figures who helped in fleshing out our concept of a nation under tyrannical colonial rule. In this film, Manuel L. Quezon comes alive as a fierce politician who would stop at nothing to fulfill his ambition which is not to serve but to lead. He destroyed reputations and livelihoods of opponents and critics and possible nurtured the budding seeds of patronage politics which is still practiced contemporaneously. He loved the limelight (at some point, even literally), thrived in public attention, and treated the people in his circle depending on how useful they would be for his advancement. Public service is immaterial as long as benefits come pouring in.Jericho Rosales played Quezon with such aplomb and vigor that you couldn't help but be irritated at his antics. He is good. I had initial reservations when he was cast but I realized he was a good fit and he played the role well. He owns the screen every time he is on which could be reminiscent of how the real Quezon chews the scenery whenever he could. The film is a good reminder of how devious politicians could be and how easily can we be blinded by adoration even if we should have known better. If anything, this film posits that politicians come and go but our country remains and therefore, our faith should be placed on people who would serve it the best.

Quezon,"The finale (or is it?) to Jerrold Tarog’s ongoing thesis on what it means to be a national hero cleverly frames the retelling of the titular character’s life as a film within a film, one that’s purposefully laden with creative license and narrative freedom — blending truth and fiction to get its themes across (or, depending on your politics, to serve as propaganda or a fluff piece). It’s fitting, then, that the final confrontation between the real-life character and the fictional surrogate who’s been our audience stand-in since the start of this interconnected project takes place inside a movie theater — the very medium through which myths are made.The film — and its film-within-the-film (yes, it gets that meta) — traces Quezon’s journey from his beginnings as part of the revolutionary army, to his days as a lawyer of the people, to his rise from local town governor to the first president of an autonomous Philippine government, free from direct foreign control. Each retelling presents not so much the man himself, but how he wanted to be remembered: as a patriot, a reformist, a visionary — or perhaps just a man intoxicated by the idea of power.We see a Quezon who thirsts not only for independence but also for control — and at times, for affairs and questionable advances — justifying the bending of truths and the moral grayness of politics as necessary evils to “effect real change.” He preaches independence to a populace not yet aware of what it truly means, wielding the idea as a political tool. Even when confronted by findings that autonomy may have come too soon — that corruption and cronyism were inevitable — he presses on, clinging to power in the name of progress.The production design is remarkable, a clear step up in scale and ambition — grand, intricate, and indicative of a much higher budget. Tarog’s decision to divide the film into cinematic “chapters” gives it an epic sweep, though it also makes the storytelling feel jumpy at times, leaving certain emotional and narrative threads unresolved. The script leans a bit too heavily on exposition, and the occasional bursts of humor sometimes undercut the otherwise serious tone.Still, Quezon (2025) succeeds where it matters most: in driving home its central theme — that our so-called national heroes, for all their grandeur and idealism, were also deeply flawed, morally ambiguous men shaped by ambition and compromise. It leaves us with a haunting question that lingers long after the credits roll:Are our political leaders — past and present — truly heroes, or simply the kind of villains we’ve learned to celebrate?",15/10/2025,positive,0.97090596,0

Quezon,"I'm still not convinced that we need a film about Quezon because he is so bland as a greedy populist political figure that any attempt to explore him will be preachy and on-the-nose, relentlessly hammering the problem with the current zeitgeist with little catharsis. It entailed a perilous narrow line between portraying him as a brilliant charismatic political mastermind or a typical power hungry politician who reflect most public servant in the government today that they framed this story with journalists and filmmakers who would provide the commentary for the audience. It was looking at the eponymous protagonist from a distance, dissecting his essence and stripping him of all subjectivity, but it was also not presented objectively since they needed to ensure that the audience would not receive the wrong message, so more telegraphed commentary from the minor character. They should have simply written an informative paper discussion instead of making a film about the subject, because they had a lot to say but no compelling story to tell. It was so disorganized narratively that halfway through the film, it was difficult to tell where it was meant to go, and at least three elderly audience members were sleeping and snoring loudly from my theater.The visual language utilized in this movie is quite odd, most likely because they are unable to find a mean to convey the screenplay in a cinematic or visually appealing manner. It kept repeating the same shots and camera movements, which grew tedious at some point given the scale and time period it meant to communicate. There are too many tilt and boom shots, and the blocking tends to follow a formalism with a lot of symmetrical orientation that looked so theatrical with the camera slowly moving in, even though they desperately needed dynamic filmmaking to hide the limited production design. It relied on theatricality to pull this off, and even the performances adapt that theatrical mechanics where it devolved into actors yelling their dialogue, which was noticeable with the pitch of the sound, prompting me to be conscious with the sound system to see whether the problem was with the theater or the sound mixing itself. Not to nitpick the technical filmmaking further, but the way they filmed those propaganda short films looked too modern for the time period, and not because they were shot with a digital camera, which is totally understandable for budgetary purposes and accessibility of equipment, but they were edited and lit with a modern sensibility. Nonetheless, the intent of those short films narratively was rather intriguing since I'm pretty sure they were fictional and only used as a narrative device for the commentary. It was trying to offer that film within a film structure, peeling away the propaganda, but it just became too on-the-nose and a convenient excuse for their chosen narrative structure. They should have adopted a traditional narrative approach for this film since it would have been more compelling to show that point-of-view as Quezon rose and fell, with all of his hypocrisy and politicking, but doing so could have humanized the protagonist to the point that the audience would love him. It was a tricky film to make, and I appreciate that it did not humanize or glorify Quezon as an anti-hero at all, but it grew monotonous and painfully obvious when it could have been more mean-spirited and nuanced. I am so familiar with Quezon's political career that I was able to follow all of the political strife in the film, which made me upset since it seemed like I was reading my notes from my history class rather than following a cohesive narrative. However, I'm not sure what an audience unfamiliar with the subject matter can take away from this film, which moves from one battle after another with far too many expositions. It was bombastic and loaded with information, and without knowing the significance and relationship of each character, along with the political backdrop around the time, it will probably be alienating for others. It was still able to deliver some of the story in an innovative way, notably the Quezon versus Osmena fight, which is the most visually interesting, easy-to-follow and entertaining story throughout the film. It is actually impressive how it created a pace and tone that made sense for what it was trying to do narratively.Lastly, I want to discuss the Aguinaldo aspect, which was jarring since it nearly made him likable and probably the protagonist of this film, despite having a far worse reputation than most national heroes. It further claims that Quezon invented the beliefs that Aguinaldo killed Luna. It was strange since the film rehabilitated him with a title credit that celebrated how he is the last one to die among Quezon, Osmena and Roxas. Are we expected to feel bad for him? I don't know about that, and the way it was dramatized at the end makes it seem like we were wrong to hate him all along. Aside from being a nepo baby, I believe he tried to sold the Philippines revolution to the Spaniards in exchange for an exile in Hong Kong and allegedly 800,000 that is supposed to be handed in two parts, one of which were delivered but the other half was not, so he resumed the revolution. It almost feels like it was gaslighting the audience, but it was more likely illustrating that Quezon is beloved when he is actually worse.**Endnote: How dare them not to mention Pascual Racuyal, the bulakenyo mechanic who run for presidency every election from 1935 until the snap election during 1986?",15/10/2025,negative,0.563601613,0

Everything works together so well — from the casting, music choices, filming perspectives, editing style, characters, and writing. Everyone who worked in this you deserve every piece of credit Not only does this depict how despicable Quezon was as a politician but even applies to the current state of Philippine politics and how politicians work to gain power. A friend who has watched the films in the bayaniverse told me this was a more “light” film compared to the other ones already released and that depicts a lot from Quezon’s character, a charismatic leader. I really enjoyed the campaign video having Quezon’s achievements and the alternative one showcasing the steps he took and people he conflicted with to be the man he is. And Jericho Rosales as Quezon? It works so well! The casting they do is so great and loved it a lot. Though I wish they didn’t picture Aguinaldo in a pitiful aspect since he has his fair share of dirt. Overall, a great cinematic masterpiece because I could apply my knowledge of politics and governance  Quezon may have had his lies and manipulation tactics, but he was right about how beautiful the film industry will be and still is. This film is solid proof to it. Great job to the people who worked on this!! Your art is loved!",15/10/2025,positive,0.997719228,0

Quezon,"“I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by the Americans, because however a bad Filipino government might be, we can always change it.” -Manuel L. Quezon, 1939Well we did it Quezon, we're now living in a country run like hell by Filipinos, like you said. Not sure how that last part of the quote will fare out, but let's hope it'll ring true at some point. Quezon is yet again another substantive display of one of the Philippine's most important historical figures. Following Heneral Luna and Goyo, this is Jerrold Tarog's third attempt of this kind of historical drama that puts these historical figures on the spotlight in a way that provides discourse on the political state of the Philippines during their time; a discourse of which that's unfortunately relevant to this day. As opposed to both Antonio Luna and Gregorio Del Pilar, who were generals, this film focuses on Manuel L. Quezon, a prominent Filipino political figure in the early 20th century (the 2nd Philippine President, specifically). While he's more known in the history books (or at least how I was taught in school) as someone who made changes in the Philippine government to make the nation more independent, the movie gives a transparent perspective of his rise to Presidency in both a positive light and negative light, the latter of which is shown in the misdeeds and manipulation he did behind the scenes in order to gain his power. It's come to the point where the interactions feel so Mean Girls-coded, in a sense where Filipino political affairs feel so parallel to high-school drama, where people try to one-up themselves over others in the political game of seeing whoever takes the highest form of power. It's funny to think about at first, but it's much more depressing if you really put your mind to it; Filipino politicians have never really gotten past this political game for power that it's still very much relevant to this day. Instead of addressing the actual issues in the country like the lack of education, proper infrastructure, and better living conditions for the lower class, you see Quezon do a lot of back-and-forth between his opponents and other people just to retain his position. And when he does interact with the lower class, he instills this fake hope in the independence of the Filipino nation, which sounds so good that even those who don't know what the word ""independence"" actually means were sold by his charismatic and inspiring words. Though Quezon has done a lot of good for the country, the film shows just how flawed he is, and how we shouldn't just take the positive impact he had, but also take in his wrongdoings as a view on the saddening reality of politics. There's a recurring motif of characters being tired of all the back-and-forth interactions that lead to nothing productive, which feels very reflective of how the director Jerrold Tarog feels about modern Filipino politics; he's tired of his more subtle approach in his two aforementioned films that he tackles the topic in this film in a more straightforward way.As a result, the film can get preachy and waaaaay too obvious in its approach to this topic, which throws subtlety out of the way. But I understand how this is done intentionally to really get the point across, especially to the young Filipino viewers who will be watching this and be urged by educators in doing so, especially through the student discounts (of which I got, because I'm still in college lol). Normally, I'd be against this obvious approach in such an important topic, but seeing that it intends on educating the Filipino youth regarding the political state of the country, and seeing how poor the reading and art comprehension are of most Filipinos, I can forgive the film for this. It has a lot of good things to say, albeit there were some inaccuracies here and there, though they were done for a more cohesive narrative and theme throughout. Jericho Rosales gave a really good performance as the titular character, Iain Glenn was a standout to me, despite his considerably short appearance, and there weren't any bad actors in this at all. Tarog's direction was quite good, the pacing was always on point and never got boring, the cinematography was mostly great, and the production and set design were so insanely well done and there was a lot of attention to detail. Though the editing can sometimes be jarring and the music gets a bit overbearing at times, the film was still really good overall. Really hope that the students watching this film will take the good out of the film and be inspired to become the change that we need in the Philippines, especially since the future isn't looking so bright for our country. I liked Lav Diaz's Magellan, but honestly I wish this were picked as the entry to the Oscars for Best Foreign Film instead. This was a much more accessible film that will definitely speak to a lot of Filipinos and will definitely leave a lasting impact to Filipinos much more than Magellan did. Not saying that the entry should be chosen based on accessibility, but rather, it should be chosen based on how important it is in representing the country's cinema as a whole, and this was a great representation for our country's cinema and our history.

Quezon,"First of all, Jericho Rosales is such a great actor — his acting totally mogged Mon Confiado’s, and that’s impressive because Mon never fails to amaze me even now.Next, I honestly didn’t expect the plot to go that way. I had no idea it was about Quezon’s dirty politics and the manipulative things he did to get the people he needed on his side.This movie really shows that behind every successful politician, there’s always something hidden. It’s also interesting how school never really told us about Quezon’s wrongdoings — just that he gave the Philippines its independence and the other good stuff. They never mentioned the questionable stuff behind it. Quezon’s a funny character though; he’s like that one confident, good-looking classmate who cracks jokes and somehow always has everyone’s attention.At first, I wasn’t into the movie — it didn’t seem catchy. But I’m glad I stayed until the end because it was worth watching. Not just because of CongTV, who honestly felt a bit random and unnecessary. I also don’t get the hype about Aguinaldo’s supposed innocence when there’s really nothing to be innocent anout. Quezon was totally right about Joven’s hypocrisy too.

Quezon,"A sharp, smart, and playful deconstruction of The Life of a Showman.It's all for show. A call for Independence. A promising election campaign. A mythmaking agenda built on propaganda. That's the thing about politicians—they act, project, and perform for everyone. QUEZON is a timely & grim reminder that virtually nothing has changed over the last 100 years in our padrino & utang na loob ecosystem. In between political breakups and unnecessary theatrics, the country remains a farce governed by clowns. The film nudges the audience to see through the web of lies.What QUEZON also achieves brilliantly is turning political maneuverings into a compelling drama through a kinetic screenplay, smoothly switching from a frame story, to an analepsis, to its current timeline. Think Succession, but set in Malacañang.The newspaper montage works as an effective storytelling device, grounding its viewers to the historical context. It tends to overexplain and simplify its message but in an age where satire is a dying art, this may be the way to make its point crystal clear. The dynamic blocking, characters walking ahead or standing a tier higher, are used to convey fragile egos, shifting alliances, and subtle power plays.Jericho Rosales is simply terrific, inhabiting the role with such bold, infectious energy. Jerrold Tarog skillfully balances tone and themes, providing a fresh way to tackle a historical drama. The ensemble is stellar across the board, with everyone getting their moment. Karylle, with limited screentime, leaves a lasting impression. She’s often seated while Quezon towers above, until a full-circle moment where life throws a reminder that power, like fate and politics, always turns like a wheel.Entertaining & thought-provoking, QUEZON is a fitting conclusion to the Bayaniverse trilogy. Brush up with your high school history knowledge to achieve a richer experience. TBA Studios should be proud of this, especially with its grand production that’s 100% deserving of the big screen.

It’s wild because you know you’re supposed to be enticed by his noble lies, even while you can see the calculating political games happening behind all that famous charisma.And that's exactly why I love how this is so out of the box with how it was directed. Seriously, the structural choices are amazing.The first part is all shine and facade, there to show us the kind of politics Quezon wants us to see: the grand, heroic statesman fighting for independence.But the second part? That was everything that gave me goosebumps all throughout the second half of the film! It delivers the film’s devastating thesis by explicitly showing us the dirty politic framework Quezon has basically founded in this country, which we suffer to experience to this day.That face-off of Quezon and Aguinaldo? The acting of Jericho Rosales and Mon Confiado absolutely sealed my rating on this film. I can't believe a single ""don't you dare"" line could make me feel so tense!A must-watch if you want to understand why our system is the way it is now.

Quezon,"It's funny how this movie, even with all its fictional creative freedom, perfectly mirrors the political realities of the Philippines today. Jerrold Tarog doesn't just present a history lesson, he offers a raw, unflinching look at the budding Philippine government in a way that contemporary audiences should study closely. The film makes it brutally clear that this country's foundation wasn't laid purely with high ideals and patriotism, but was instead built on a messy combination of greed, manipulation, betrayal, and the relentless pursuit of power.What truly stings was the realization that after decades upon decades of supposed journey toward claiming true independence and stability, we always seem to cycle back to the same messy politics, just in a different font and under new names. And at the center of this perpetually recurring drama, the film powerfully argues, is a key player silently pulling the strings, moving the local pawns for their own geopolitical gain: the Americans. The film's narrative highlights how foreign interests often shaped the domestic landscape, making us question who are our true allies and enemies.This is uncomfortably sad, but Quezon is beyond a mere entertainment affair. It’s not just a historical drama but rather an outcry of what we have become as a nation, especially how we form our opinions with blind idolatry in mind, just like how Quezon blindly idolizes himself of what he thought he was, and that in itself is alarming.",15/10/2025,positive,0.815210462,0

Kaunti lang ang lingkod bayan”I wish we all had a lens clear enough to see what truly drives every politician when they chase power.Watching how Quezon played with the emotions of those around him, with position and power, I couldn’t help but wonder: maybe deception has long been ingrained in what it means to be Filipino. Maybe we’ve always been “mabilis mabilog” and “magaling mambilog”. This is where the cycle started, and no doubt why it still continues. It’s a system like a game with set mechanics—only the players change, and the tricks evolve.The film itself is incredible. There’s a sense of power here that’s difficult to explain and an emotional pull so strong you can’t decide whose side you’re on, because each character’s truth unfolds with raw honesty. You see their flaws, their desires, and how their ideals clash for the same country. Oh and i love how Tarog uses cinema and journalism as tools of truth. The transitions, the way history is woven through reels of film, are brilliant. The color palette alone tells a story—Quezon bathed in rich, vivid hues, while Aguinaldo fades into muted tones. And the score! Haha. The circus-like and chaotic score is perfect reflection of the madness, the spectacle that politics has always been. Ang husay. The cast is insane, and I couldn’t be more proud because wow..such a powerful ensemble of artists.Jerrold Tarog is bold and fearless, and such a great storyteller.By the end of the film, I found myself asking: Will this game ever end?

Quezon,"As the Bayaniverse comes to a close, we now see Joven Hernando for who he's always been: all of us. The quintessential Filipino everyman; blissfully hopeful yet willfully ignorant when it suits him. Someone so desperate for salvation they kneel before madmen, canonizing them as saints. And when this precarious house of cards that they—we—have helped build comes tumbling down, blame spreads like thick, choking smoke and we're left exposed, haunted by our own folly and the delusions we built our faith upon. Like the return of a Marcos to power, propped up by the despotic Duterte machinery, and the mess that ensued. But not all comebacks have to be so daunting.

Ang husay nung pagkalatag ng story and it would really make you want to not miss any scene. Grabe yung politics since then. It's all a game. I like how chess was widely used as a metaphor for this film. It was so soooo good.Joven's character was the one that tied it all together since the first film. We've seen him grow from a spectator, a young journalist from Heneral Luna's time to someone who played an active role in MLQ's presidency. The cast also did really well. Kuhang kuha yung accent and gestures ni MLQ. I was hesitant at first when I learned it was Jericho playing the lead role kasi I really wanted TJ Trinidad but Jericho really delivered.Of course, the film will make you realize that corruption & dirty politics has always been deeply ingrained in our system. What makes a hero? Sino nga ba ang tunay na naglilingkod sa Bayan? Najujustify ba ng means (patronage politics, fake news, spoils system among others) ang end (independence)? And no. I don't believe in what MLQ said that he would rather see a nation run like hell by Filipinos than a nation run like heaven by the Americans. Look where it got us.",15/10/2025,positive,0.963644266,0

Quezon,"Quezon by Jerrold Tarog#CJSays Super Nice! 4/5 stars  Finally after years of waiting, the third installment to the Bayaniverse is here! I'm so excited to watch this since I'm so curious to get to know President Quezon like what Direk Jerrold did to Heneral Luna and Goyo and after watching this movie twice, andami Kong naisip after.We all know that President Manuel L.Quezon is that guy from the 20 pesos bill and our ""Ama ng Wikang Pambansa"" but in this movie, they were able to humanize him, Nasabi ko sa sarili ko na, Gaya din sya ng iba! The ensemble cast were all brilliant! Kudos to the cast led by Jericho Rosales who really gave justice to the role! This is his best performance yet and I will not be surprised if he will get an award through this movie! His portrayal is powerful! Sir Mon Confiado is always on top of his game in everything he does, nabigyan ng character arc si Aguinaldo dito, I'm also happy that Joven was given a spotlight here and kudos to Sir Cris Villanueva and Arron Villaflor! Bagay Kay Karylle ang role na Aurora Quezon!The cinematography is good, the set design is perfect! It feels like I was transported to the Commonwealth era! The story focuses on the rise to power of Quezon but I wish they also featured his early life like his lovestory with Aurora, exciting story Sana yun since they were cousins (Yes!) and also I wish nabigyan din ng highlight si Dona Aurora since she's a vital character in Quezon's life and to the history of the Philippines, Quezon was told in a non linear storytelling and sometimes I got confused if the scene is a backstory, or a scene to Nadia's movie or a scene in the present time, may blur yun department na yun and how I wish it was polished!After watching the movie as I leave the cinemas, mapapaisip ka, bakit sa Kabila ng lahat, mula noon hanggang ngayon, why are we still electing trapo leaders? Para syang multo na hindi matakasan!Quezon is an important movie event best experience in cinemas, it mirrors the current state of our nation with the recent happenings nowadays (That Quezon vs Osmena for example) and I hope this movie ignites our awakening to choose and vote the right leaders!

Joven (who was initially a symbol for the youth and the audience's lenses into Heneral Luna) had lost his function in the previous films, and had become a character deeply intertwined with MLQ's politics.The dialogue and pacing, too, was evidently not as spicy as Heneral Luna's (or even Goyo's).Overall, it's an okay movie.",16/10/2025,positive,0.977606177,0

At ang malupit na katotohanan: sa pagkakataong ito, wala nang bansang kailangang manakop upang ipagkait sa atin ang kalayaan—sapagkat tayong mga Pilipino mismo ang hindi marunong lumaya.

Ilang henerasyon na nating binibihag ang ating mga sarili, ilang Quezon pa ba ang darating upang humingi ng independencia at gaya niya ay paulit-ulit na maligaw ng landas.

Quezon,"It’s always a peculiar experience watching a Jerrold Tarog film. There’s a quiet unease that comes with it. Maybe it’s because I’ve followed his work long enough to know he never really plays it safe; every film feels like a balancing act between vision and vulnerability. I know he’s not flawless, and neither are his films, even the ones I hold close (Confessional, Senior Year, Bliss). But there’s something about the way he tells stories that always feels searching and alive. He’s never been after polish (and sometimes that’s the most frustrating part of his cinema) but he’s always been after answers. New answers to the kind of questions only a history geek would ask in the shower. So whenever I enter a Direk Jerrold film, I brace, because I know it might reveal something I wasn’t ready to see about us, or about what we’ve become.Of all the BAYANIVerse films, QUEZON feels the most adventurous — not in scale, but in spirit. It’s Direk Jerrold’s boldest experiment in this saga: a film that knows it’s a film. He borrows from Mike de León’s Bayaning Third World, playing with the grammar of cinema itself: reenactments, reconstructions, meta-frames. The satire is there, but softer now, as if Direk Jerrold has accepted that to film history is to fictionalize it. Every frame of patriotism is, by nature, a kind of performance.What’s interesting is how Quezon almost feels like a return to where Direk Jerrold began: to the heart of his first feature Confessional. That film was all about guilt and exposure. It blurred the line between truth and performance, between what’s real and what’s edited for the camera. Quezon carries that same unease, only now the canvas is larger: not one man’s confession, but an entire nation’s. It’s still about projection; about editing who we say we are. In both films, Direk Jerrold wrestles with the same dilemma: that the story of the country, like the story of the self, is always partly fabricated. The distance between public myth and private truth isn’t new to him; it’s the ground he’s been standing on all along.The beginning, though, is difficult. It unfolds like an essay: brisk, detached, almost indifferent to its own characters. We’re given on-screen identifiers to remember names, but no real reason to care about them yet. It’s matter-of-fact to the point of numbness. And while I understand the intention — that deliberate coldness, that resistance to sentimentality — it keeps me at a distance. Maybe that’s the point: that our first encounter with history is always sterile, a list of names before they become people. But it’s still a hard place to start for a film that ultimately depends on emotional investment. If the audience doesn’t feel invited in, the ideas risk floating above the story, detached from the very humanity they’re trying to illuminate. It’s a fascinating gamble: to alienate first, and hope empathy arrives later.Eventually, it warms. Theory turns into theater: infidelity, betrayal, the exhausting pettiness of ambition. The shift happens quietly, and suddenly, these figures in textbooks begin to ache, to resent, to want. The sarcasm becomes sorrow. Direk Jerrold lets Quezon’s charisma clash with his contradictions, and the film begins to reveal what the trilogy has been circling all along: that our heroes were never saints, just men rehearsing greatness for a stage called history.Still, Quezon is uneven in texture. It moves between stylization and realism so freely that the seams sometimes show. One moment it looks painterly, the next like something out of a morning kiddie show. Some transitions feel deliberate; others feel like accidents. At times I even caught myself wondering — is this stylized, or a little off? But at some point, the film begins to carry those inconsistencies as part of its design. The tone itself becomes a kind of argument: that history, like cinema, is never seamless. Its rough edges start to feel less like errors and more like evidence: that the story of a nation is always told through competing frames, through sincerity and performance, myth and memory all bleeding into one another.It’s also the most intimate of the trilogy, and paradoxically, the smallest. The 1935 election feels less like a historical event and more like a town contest, the scale reduced to smoke-filled rooms, small plaza gatherings, and even smaller street marches. But maybe that’s where politics truly happens: not on the battlefield, but in the room where stories are shaped or in those short walks in between campaign speeches. The Philippines, Direk Jerrold seems to say, wasn’t born in fire but in fog — not through heroism, but through negotiation. He shrinks the myth to scale, and somehow that feels truer.Jericho Rosales is remarkable. His Quezon is a performer to his bones: charming, strategic, aware that every gesture is part of a show. It’s a portrayal that understands leadership as theater. But it’s Karylle as Aurora Quezon and Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña who give the film its soul probably because I believe they are able to play characters that are also written better. They play the roles history often edits out — the ones who absorb power’s aftershocks. Their warmth gives the film the emotional gravity that its cleverness sometimes withholds.And the film is funny! Not that it’s a surprise, since the trailers already gave that away. But what’s interesting is how the humor works; it never feels forced. In all the politics of it all, the humor really lands. You laugh, but it’s the kind of laughter that feels like recognition — the ache of realizing how cyclical our myths have become. Watching Quezon today, it’s hard not to see the reflection: new leaders, same spectacle, the same applause for the illusion of change. The crowd has changed, but the choreography hasn’t. Politics has always been performance; we’ve just upgraded the stage lights.[SPOILER ALERT]What makes Quezon linger though isn’t how it ends, but how it fades. In a quiet mid-credits scene, a radio hums with “Mambo Magsaysay.” It sounds harmless at first, even nostalgic, until it sinks in. The trilogy that began with men dying for freedom ends with a jingle: a hero reborn not through valor, but through publicity. The revolution has learned rhythm; the myth, melody. What began in blood and fire now survives through broadcast. Heroism no longer dies; it loops endlessly on air, selling itself back to a nation that keeps forgetting.Maybe that’s Direk Jerrold’s quiet brilliance. Heneral Luna was about rage — the passion that builds nations. Goyo was about disillusionment — how conviction collapses once heroism becomes habit. Quezon is about myth — how belief turns into image, and image into machinery. It’s not just the end of a trilogy; it’s the moment when the revolution becomes a system. Because Quezon, for all his brilliance, also built the architecture of the politics we still live in: the patronage, the alliances, the transactional warmth that makes power feel personal but never equal. The birth of democracy was also the birth of dependency.And if the hinted Magsaysay film ever comes, then it will tell the story of how that system learned to sing. Because Magsaysay was the first modern president sold like an idea — a leader branded through music, charisma, and American approval. His legacy marks the shift from politics as negotiation to politics as emotion. If Luna died for the nation, and Quezon built it, then Magsaysay would show how the nation learned to perform itself — how conviction turned into choreography, leadership into branding, and the state into a stage where power thrives not by being just, but by looking relatable.The question now isn’t “Who is the hero?” but “Who’s holding the camera — and for which story, for whose gain, and at what cost to the truth?”",15/10/2025,positive,0.954160094,0

Quezon,"The long-awaited final chapter in the Bayaniverse trilogy brilliantly shifts gears from the battlefield to the backroom, immersing us in the ruthless political game that defined the early Philippine Commonwealth. If nothing else, it shows that 100 years ago marumi na ang pulitika sa Pilipinas. The story is eerily reminiscent of the current political landscape na kung sinabi mo sakin na last month lang sinulat at ginawa to, pwedeng maniwala ako.Director Jerrold Tarog, once again, doesn't offer a statue but a scalpel, dissecting the myth of Manuel L. Quezon. This film is a compelling, dialogue-driven epic that strips away the heroic luster to reveal the manipulative acumen, charm, and sheer ambition required to forge a nation. It’s a messy portrait that feels urgently relevant, proving that the high drama of power politics can be as engrossing as any war epic.For me, the performances elevate the entire experience. Jericho Rosales is genuinely great in the titular role; he captures the former President's fire and charisma while still managing to hint at the deep contradictions beneath the tailored suits. However, this is truly an ensemble piece, and Romnick Sarmenta (as Sergio Osmeña) and Mon Confiado (reprising Aguinaldo) also shine, providing compelling foils and complexity. They make the political chess feel weighty and personal. Game of Thrones alum Iain Glen is a welcome and commanding presence, though I have to admit, his very distinct British accent occasionally pulls me out of the moment because he’s playing an American character - but maybe that’s just me being picky.I genuinely admire and respect the approach that Jerrold Tarog and team chose for this movie. A simpler but probably more boring version of this would be a straight up biopic that mythologizes Quezon. That being said, I sincerely hope our audiences are truly ready for a treatment of a national subject such as this, one that so meticulously deconstructs the idea of a great man. It requires a level of critical historical consumption that can sometimes be lacking. This film isn't just a history lesson; it's a call for discernment, and I hope Pinoys are able to understand and grapple with the deeper message it provides.My worst fear, and what keeps me thinking about the film's potential impact, is for people to come out of this movie with a shallow understanding—with the notion that all politicians are fundamentally flawed, so it's okay to support the corrupt ones they are currently ""fans"" of. I have this suspicion that when some people saw Heneral Luna, ang takeaway nila ay “Kita mo na! Kaya okay lang yung matapang tsaka palamura e” rather than the bigger and more important lessons that the movie tried to impart about nationalism.Quezon shows complexity, not blanket moral equivalence. It shows a flawed man achieving monumental goals, but critically examines the cost. It is a brilliant and challenging piece of filmmaking with terrific performances from the cast. It should be watched, discussed, and debated for years to come.",16/10/2025,positive,0.985713482,0

Quezon,"I’ve always loved antihero narratives, and Quezon fits that mold perfectly. The film illustrates how populism can bring one to power. It skirted on a single word, ""independence"", and forces you to ask what it has ever truly meant. After all, the government we have now is the same one we’ve always had, merely dressed in different fashions for each generation.But where the film stumbles is in telling historical facts. Too much of its narrative hinges on the fictional character Joven Hernando and his descent into Quezon’s pitfall of populism and cronyism. This might have worked if Quezon were intended as historical fiction. But it's not. It focused too much on Joven’s disillusionment and Quezon’s perspective that it glossed over factual events a historical film should have covered.Overall, the film was both compelling and timely. I only hope we finally learn not to mistake charisma with integrity. Lies and manipulations, however noble the cause, are always self-serving. In a nation built on lies, speaking the truth is the greatest act of defiance. When will we ever learn? Only history can tell.

Even funnier was how Tarog and co used Joven's character arc as a preemptive defensive measure against valid critiques of this film's real-life political-economic implications (""I have a family to feed"").

Quezon,"It's odd that a film so much about a man who campaigned on national independence, whose supposed saving grace is that he ultimately did bring it about, says so little about what that independence even meant. This film adds nothing to the discourse of national independence.This is another glossy entry to Jerrold Tarog’s “Bayani-verse” series of films, which some have described as an attempt to deconstruct the Philippine national hero. It's the most fictionalized of the three*. And it's another one that gets worse the more you think about it. Hopefully it’s the last, as they say, for I have no interest in seeing another one of these movies about Ramon Magsaysay. My biggest issue with this film in particular is that it subsists so much on the surface of its subject matter that it fails to say anything interesting about the context in which its events occur. What does it actually say about the 50-year American occupation of the Philippines? What does it actually say about Manuel Quezon as a president? As a leader of the country? What does it say about how everyday Filipinos experienced his rule? Does it say anything at all?It's mostly about Manuel Quezon as a politician, or more so, how he performs politics. It's about his two-facedness, his scrupulousness, his constant need to one-up his political opponents at any chance he gets. The film successfully contextualizes the absurd spectacle of 21st century politics by telling us that its roots go back to the very inception of our political independence nearly a century ago. But this is also where the film's issues lie.The film appears to critique Quezon for how he participated in and fine-tuned the garish spectacle of modern political campaigning, of setting the stage for our present day election cycles. But despite the film’s acknowledgment of the shallowness of these tactics, it still chooses to disproportionately focus on them. It reduces the American occupation of the Philippines to a series of interpersonal squabbles, as opposed to focusing on the actual impact of Quezon’s rule over the Filipinos at the time. Based on what we see in the film, the legacy of Manuel Quezon is in how he engaged with politics, as opposed to the impact of his actions on everyday people. But what was the actual situation of Filipinos back then? One of the only times we hear the perspective of a farmer is to highlight their ignorance of the word “independence.” A few scenes later we hear Osmeña and Quezon agree with Leonard Wood that the Filipinos just aren't ready for independence yet. But why? The film doesn't explore it further. And in the latter half of the film, some of the more intriguing critiques of Quezon’s political impact on the country are undermined by the fact that they’re coming out of the mouth of Emilio Aguinaldo, the Bayani-verse’s primary villain.There's just no inkling at all in the film of what life was like for the average Filipino under American occupation or the Quezon-led Commonwealth. It's 2025. We need to be looking past myopic personalizations of the past. We need to think about the actual situations of the Filipino people. We need to think about what independence actually means and what form of ""independence"" we actually got, both in 1935 and 1946. We don't need more Great Man biopics.Does the film have anything to say about independence at all? We hear the word constantly bandied around like a slogan, as if saying it out loud is enough to signal what the country needs. But the filmmakers don't bother to unpack it. Perhaps the real-life Quezon also didn't explain what was meant by this in the 1920s and 1930s, but that shouldn't excuse our filmmakers today. Unless they genuinely believe that all independence entails is a democracy to vote for our leaders. Perhaps a good question to ask is the opposite. How did Quezon continue the structures of colonial dominance during his rule?What the film seems to try to say is that our first president embodied a lot of the best and worst qualities of many politicians today, but ultimately, it can perhaps be justified because it was for something greater — it was for our independence. But it doesn't bother to explore what this proposed independence even means; it doesn't bother to distinguish political and economic independence; it doesn't even offer any useful corollaries to thinking about these issues today.So why was this film even made?*What makes it so much more fictionalized than the previous two films is the huge prominence of the narrative conceit of telling the film through the perspectives of Joven Hernando and his daughter. The closing down of Hernando’s Alerta publication and the idea of a young female director shooting short films to publicize Quezon’s campaign are totally fictional. There was some suppression of the press, for sure, during Quezon’s time, but Alerta doesn’t have any direct correlates. Perhaps it’s more to symbolize the shut down of ABS-CBN during Rodrigo Duterte’s term. And I could be wrong, but I don’t think Quezon had films made about himself to promote his campaign. Ferdinand Marcos definitely did though. **Very briefly towards the end of the film we get a 30-second critique of Quezon's impact on patronage politics and the disbursement of spoils (pork barrel). That's good. But I don't think it makes up for the other 130 minutes or so of the film that takes more seriously as an issue scandals such as whether he had a first wife or not.",16/10/2025,negative,0.639693558,0

Quezon,"The third film in the Bayaniverse series, Quezon, finally arrives a decade after Heneral Luna. Once again, Jerrold Tarog proves himself as an icon of Philippine cinema. As the film’s writer, director, editor, composer, and producer, Tarog demonstrates complete creative freedom. His distinct artistic voice resonates throughout the film. Tarog doesn’t shy away from drawing parallels between the political struggles of the past and the issues plaguing the Philippines today. It’s disheartening, as a Filipino, to realize how history continues to repeat itself, where those in power remain driven by greed and ambition.The film also challenges how we view Manuel L. Quezon. Was he truly a hero? Have we been blinded by the glorified version of our history, knowing only the good side of his leadership? These questions lingered with me long after the credits rolled.Visually, Quezon excels. The production design beautifully transports viewers to the past, recreating the era with meticulous detail. I was especially excited to see Iain Glen, though I admit I was a bit disappointed by how limited his screen time was. Jericho Rosales, on the other hand, delivers a refreshing performance, showing a side of him we haven’t seen before.Still, I felt the film could have explored more, particularly Quezon’s pivotal role as the “Father of the National Language.” That historical thread seemed missing and could have added more depth to his character and legacy.Overall, I genuinely liked Quezon. While Heneral Luna remains my favorite, this film stands strong in its own right. It’s thought-provoking, relevant, and undeniably crafted with passion. Perhaps it could have benefitted from more time in production, considering it was shot earlier this year, but its brilliance still shines through.Rating:  (4.5/5) — A brilliant and insightful look into our past that continues to speak to the present.",16/10/2025,positive,0.994102299,0
Quezon,"The shining stars of QUEZON are the charismatic performances, intricate impartiality and visceral storytelling. Its place in the Bayaniverse and the entire trilogy itself acts as a strong reminder of the country's implications of its actions and choices.Perspective is the game in the politics of this time - Quezon exploits it to his advantage; a businessman in essence, a fiery public speaker, a charismatic strategist, thus leading him to power. Rosales captures the eponymous character with such gusto, power and dynamicism. One could say he indeed was Quezon in the flesh.But, this is still the Bayaniverse. Through journalist Joven Hernando, plus his filmmaker daughter Nadia in this film, provide an impartial lens where the modern audience is their envoy. Hernando's arc through the trilogy has satisfyingly gone full circle. Powerful for a fictional character in this context.Quezon brought this game - these political tricks, to light. Then us, the current generation, young and old, can still feel its heat. But at this point, it's a sprawling fire, unable to control. Is the future actually equipped enough to take it down? Ultimately, that's for us to decide.This film leaves viewers in deep critical thinking, as what this trilogy has gone out to do, and they've done it triumphantly. Between the humor, lightheartedness and cinematics, the questions confidently linger through, lasting long after the credits roll.",16/10/2025,positive,0.991447926,0
Quezon,"If you haven't watched the first two movies of the Bayani series, I suggest you should. Although it did not affect the understanding for this movie, you'll have a better grasp of the other important character's background. Jericho Rosales is an actor you should look out for. He put a lot of effort duplicating Manuel L. Quezon, especially the way he speaks. I think being able to change the way you speak for a 2-hour movie is dedication— Jericho has a lot of that. My last memory of watching Jericho Rosales was in a romance movie and I almost forgot how good he is. (Ito na magtatagalog na ako bdjsjsj) Nagulat ako kasi for someone na matagal nang hindi nakikita sa TV, sobrang pasabog ng pinakita niya na acting. This one really deserves to be in line with the other two Bayani movies. Sobrang galing din ng ibang actors as they also gave justice to the development of Manuel's character. Romnick wow! I already know he was an A-list actor, but seeing him with the others just made him stand out more (also maybe because he is an important character, but nonetheless). Mon, Karylle, Therese, Aaron, Cris, Joross, Ketchup, and JC were also freaking great. Ang lupit talaga ng line up ng artists kasi saan ka makakakita ng movies na kasama silang lahat? Sa Quezon lang. If you want to properly understand why we have this kind of government today, go watch Quezon and reflect as to why that kind of mindset persisted until today. It did not meant to make the people see Manuel as a hero, rather, it wants to make us realize why a revolution happened in the first place. It did not come from merely opposing a person— it is the generational urge to be in a better place that we can call ours. If politics is indeed a game, what choice do we have, as pawns, if we don't fight back and make a stand?

Quezon,"The movie Quezon shows how patronage politics started in the Philippines. It’s a plea for people to always be critical because not everything is as it seems, especially when power and politics are involved. Dakila ang paglilingkod, but we can’t deny that even the brightest minds, no matter how noble their intent, have their own interests to protect, whether it’s power, greed, or pride. The film also leans into the idea of politics as performance, where charisma and public image often overshadow truth. It blurs the line between sincerity and spectacle, showing how easily stories can be staged, not just on screen, but in history itself. Beyond its message, this film feels like a love letter to the older forms of cinema now rendered obsolete by technology. In a world full of unfinished or half-hearted stories, it's admirable that Quezon made it to the screen despite all the odds. The more I think about the state of film today, the more I realize how fragile the whole industry is. The infrastructure is massive, and if one part of it falls, whether it’s funding, distribution, or technological support, the whole system would crumble.Watching Quezon in theaters felt like joining a fight to keep cinema alive. But it also made me realize that in a world where storytelling is changing rapidly, staying critical of what we consume is more important than ever. As technology brings new voices and narratives, we must stay aware of how stories are shaped. Quezon shows how the politics behind a film can influence its message, reminding us to be conscious of the contradictions in storytelling, especially with complex topics like politics.",15/10/2025,positive,0.93345809,0

Quezon,"It's all fun a games for our politicians while the Filipino people continue to be the pawnsWhen I saw the trailer for the first time I was a bit confused. Why were they using a Filipino children's game song in the trailer? It all made sense after watching the film.Quezon did not have the action and angst of its co-Bayaniverse film Heneral Luna nor it did not have the suspense and romanticization of Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral but what it did have is a very intentional unraveling of a revered historical figure. This third Bayaniverse film is probably the best and my most favorite.From the very beginning of the film it captures you with its unique treatment of blending in a non-linear narrative with the meta-ness of using silent films as a medium to tell the story while it being contained in its own film. I admit at first there was some confusion in terms of the timeline and the determination of what is reality in the case of the film but as I patiently watched, it all meshed together really well. The end product was so good!I was waiting on moments where I could point out ""show-don't-tell"" moments but the expositions and explanations of what happened were really visualized and conveyed in such creative manners. Was it info overload? Well, if you didn't have any background/knowledge on Philippine History, it will be. But still, it's not a reason for someone to not watch it cause it will make you understand.Jericho Rosales, Karylle, Romnick Sarmenta, and Mon Confiado really stood out. Manuel Quezon was personified through Jericho Rosales' effortless and magnetic performance. He embodied the late president so flawlessly. Karylle's Aurora Quezon was so specific and precise with her portrayal. Her eyes spoke a thousand words and she made us gravitate towards her in every scene she was in.Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña was a crowd-favorite. The eventual first Visayan President was performed with charm and likeability. Even sometimes stealing the scene away from Quezon.But my favorite performance in the film was Mon Confiado's Emilio Aguinaldo. I don't know if I'm being biased because my great grandfather was one of his secretaries but the way Emilio Aguinaldo was written and performed in this film is so complete and really bookends his character arc since he was first seen on Heneral Luna. What I love most about this film is that it vilifies no one but at the same time it does not champion anyone as well. Yes, Quezon was a really influential and well-loved president. Dare I say, the first true performative-male. And in a country where celebrity and politics win the votes of the people, he really, admittedly, played a good game. If he was in Game of Thrones he could've sat on the Iron Throne. It did not smear Quezon's name in any way, yet, it revealed to us who he really was and how he played the game.I keep going back to ""game"" cause this was basically the main theme of the film. A poker-playing politician who always aim to one-up his foes, and even friends. He played the game right but at what cost. People being stuck between colonialism and independence, propaganda against the heroes who fought for our freedom, and a never-ending cycle of patronage politics that was mentioned in the film.I'm so glad I watched this film and I learned about this. And what's funny is that the silliness that happened during their time is still the same silliness happening in our politics up to this date. Senators and congressmen further delaying our countries progress, pork barrels and nepobabies, the ""utang na loob"" culture in politics, all of these are still happening today.Now it gets me questioning whether the fight they fought was really a success or are we just in a new hell created by being collateral damage from their wars. I guess to end this on a positive note, at least now we have people waking up, we have strong journalist and filmmakers ready to be the voice of truth, and the Filipinos are now desperate for a change. may this film be one of the flames that will truly ignite our fight for a better life and TRUE INDEPENDENCE here in our country.",16/10/2025,positive,0.996024847,0

Quezon,"Good movie that is carried by its excellent performances and undeniable timeliness. It does a good job of paying reverence to the Quezon’s legitimate political savviness while also depicting the back and forth of the political game as something childish and worthy of contempt. The movie is at its best when Jericho Rosales fires on all cylinders by being as abrasive and forceful as possible. Its these scenes, where Quezon seems deathly close to crashing out without actually doing it, where you can’t help but be mystified by his character, while simultaneously growing increasingly tired of him.The biggest problem with the movie is the problem with all the Bayaniverse movies, and a lot of movies in general nowadays, which is that it cannot help but over-explain. I get it, Manuel Quezon doesn’t exactly have the most well-known biography, but I feel like there’s a bit of projection that the audience won’t be able to understand the story without all the narrative cues, or the themes without the use of Joven as a narrator. Perhaps im more optimistic about Filipino literacy than i should be, but at some point, Jerrold Tarrog just needs to trust the audience. Joven is an incredibly lazy storytelling device that he has used as a crutch for three movies now, and made this movie twenty minutes longer than it should’ve been. I don’t need him to tell me what the movie is trying to say, and we can’t train audiences to be more literate if he keeps telling them. If Joven still somehow shows up in the next movie despite ostensibly being over a century old by then, please either end the cinematic universe as a whole or reveal that he was Juan Ponce Enrile the whole time.",16/10/2025,positive,0.988964677,0

Quezon,"Jerrold Tarog's Quezon isn't just a historical biopic; it's a masterclass in political drama and the long-awaited final word in the Bayaniverse trilogy. This film brilliantly connects the trilogy, giving us the clearest and most satisfying explanation yet for the complex state of Philippine politics and leadership.At the heart of this engrossing narrative is Jericho Rosales' magnetic performance as Manuel L. Quezon. Rosales embodies the former president as a charismatic, cunning, and fiercely intelligent political operator. He portrays the energy, oratorical flair, and sheer force of will that defined Quezon, making it clear why this complicated, flawed man was able to navigate the brutal political game and change the course of history. It's a powerhouse portrayal that anchors the entire film.The fear in a dialogue-heavy historical film is a dragging pace, but Quezon defies it. The film moves with precision and purpose, making its runtime feel taut and engaging. You'll find your eyes peeled and attention held by the intense political maneuvering.This is history not as a dusty textbook, but as a live, urgent confrontation with power, compromise, and charisma.

Jericho Rosales is a revelation in his portrayal of the titular role. He spoke Tagalog in a slightly high-pitched almost-comical voice, and would switch to English in the accent of a timog-katagalugan everyman combined with the transatlantic cadence of a prohibition era radio personality. Equal parts charming and ruthless, hysterical and terrifying, he treated the character of Quezon as a ringmaster, and the Philippine Legislature his three-ring circus. As with the two other entries in Bayaniverse, Quezon holds a cinema screen-sized mirror to its audience as it peels away the layers of the man who planted the seeds of trapo culture in the Philippines. This is as much a character study of Quezon as it is of Joven, the makabayan surrogate character present in all three films, as he realizes in a full circle moment that even he and his uncompromising ideals of the Philippines' independence are susceptible to propaganda. Jerrold Tarog made a bold creative choice to cast deeper doubts on the conspiracies surrounding the murders of Andres Bonifacio and General Luna. He asks us viewers to look beyond the historical narratives we accept as facts, and to make wiser decisions on who we should put on the pedestal next as a hero of the nation.",16/10/2025,negative,0.619220972,0
Quezon,"""Hindi ako kulangot, 'wag mo akong binibilog.""Bilang isang tambay ng sinehan, naalala ko na nakalagay sa trailer ng Quezon na it is ""the last chapter in our quest to define bayani"". So pagkatapos panoorin nito, mapapaisip ka nalang talaga: ano nga ba ang bumubuo sa isang bayani? Paano nga ba nagiging bayani ang isang tao? Pinakagusto kong desisyon na ginawa nila ay yung pagpapakita ng bagong paraan sa pagdefine ng ""bayani"". Kung sa Heneral Luna at Goyo ay nakita natin ang mga digmaan at ang laban para sa kalayaan ng Pilipinas, dito naman sa Quezon, ang sandata na ginamit para sa pagpapatuloy ng laban para sa kalayaan ay pananalita. Totoo na medyo mali nga lang yung paggamit nun ng iba sa movie na to huhuhfsdsa pero alam mo yun marina gets mo na yun matanda ka na.Di rin nahiya yung movie na ipakita ang dalawang panig ni Manuel Quezon at kung ano ang mga ginawa niya para lang makamit ang paulit-ulit na tinutukoy na ""independensiya"" ng bansa, kasabay ng kapangyarihang lagi niyang ninanais at di niya kayang bitawan. May kakaunting labo kung saan pumapanig ang pelikula pagkatapos ng lahat, pero nagulat na rin ako na ganun kalayo ang inabot nila sa pagpapakita ng pati na rin ang mga kasamaan niya.Ang nakalulungkot nga lang ay sabi dalawang beses dito na ""out with the old, in with the new"" (di ko naintindihan yung talagang sinabi nila sa tagalog sorry), pero wala pa ring nagbabago eh... ganito pa rin galawan ng mga pulitika. Yung pagbabago na hinahanap natin, hinahanap din nila noon, kaya if anything, sana magamit ang pelikulang ito upang patuloy na gumising ang mga tao at mamulat ang mga mata nila sa katotohanan ng lahat ng gulong ito, at kung sino ang mga may tunay na pananagutan sa lahat ng ito.",16/10/2025,negative,0.804835498,1

Quezon,"really really good film and a wonderful ending to this bayaniverse trilogy. it reminded me of Nick Joaquin's A Question of Heroes - like a deep dive into the people behind the heroes, asking the question: what does ""bayani"" really mean - are these heroes even real, or are they only heroes because of how the narratives of history have shaped them out to be? the performances, cinematography, the blocking, costuming, set design, color grading, soundtrack, and sound design are all absolutely a treat to watch. despite not being as action-packed as Heneral Luna and Goyo, it never feels dull because of how the screen is filled with life. watching this just after Hamilton was very interesting too, what with colonialism and independence being common themes. at the end of the day, they are both stories about flawed people who shaped the history of their respective nations, yet were also shaped by their skewed beliefs and the people and circumstances around them. overall a very very good and thought-provoking movie and I can't wait to rewatch it!",16/10/2025,positive,0.998074174,0

Quezon,"An ambitious film that tries a nuanced form of storytelling for an audience consisting of mostly high school graduates. Despite this, the movie is very engaging. It is firm in its stance on the character of the people in its story, but is intentionally ambiguous in its presentation of information on which there is no conclusive truth. Just like its predecessors, it is able to open conversation about topics which are relevant to ongoing affairs in the country; though perhaps this is simply reflective of the fact that the Filipino people have not learned from their history.Jericho Rosales shows the growth in his range as an actor with this film. This is easily one of his best, if not his best, performances ever. The other major characters in the film are able to hold their own ground here as well, though the minor characters show the clear difference in their level of skill.Great film.",16/10/2025,positive,0.996125996,0

Quezon,"Unfortunately, I haven't watched any of the Bayaniverse until this one. Well, it's an impulsive one for me to watch it but it's good to have it as somehow my last film before flying to the US and also, my first time at the director's club in our local cinema.I do not remember any moment where I felt so much giddy, excitement and anticipation watching a historical film but with this one, this excited me so much, amplified by the plethora (PLETHORA?!?!) of great actors (Rosales, Sarmenta, Santos, Lorenzo, Confiado, Villanueva, Tatlonghari-Yuzon, Abad Santos, Bayani, etc.) that just simply serve masterclass in acting and projecting. Jericho Rosales' portrayal of Quezon, from his demeanor up to his accent, it reminded me of how Vic Robinson portrayed Emilio Jacinto, that also shares an accent, it will really give you that good cherry on top for their characterizations.I really loved how the film was very rhythmic. That's the only word that comes to mind as the progression of the storylines per act is mainly governed by its accompanying track that somehow engages you to a certain feeling they want to invoke from you and that gives me so much fun because it really keeps me up and keeps me so engage, waiting for what's to come. But the accompanying track also somehow fasttracks certain transitions that make the flow of the story a little disorienting at times. There are moments where I am confused on what timeline it is or what reality it is. If I am in before of after Quezon's presidency or if I am in the silent movie created by Nadia or the reality alone.But beyond that, this is a good one and I can't wait to see both Heneral Luna and Goyo in the next few following days to see where this has started. p.s. How sad it is for the audience to realize that the reality of the Philippines in its early times is still the reality of the Philippines in the current times.",16/10/2025,positive,0.995942533,0

Quezon,"Absolute Pinoy Cinema. The style, cinematography, the lines, it's beautiful and charismatic. I felt like I travelled through time during the whole movie especially on the old film sequences, it made me feel like I was watching from an old cinema. I can almost smell the setting, specifically the wood elements from the interior scenes and I can also feel the warmth of the exterior scenes during the day. This may be the first time I felt magic in the cinema.In addition, the way the story was build from start to finish, I don't know how to describe it but it's like Oppenheimer with a hint of Wes Anderson's quirkiness from The French Dispatch. This film is 2 hours long but I do not recall a dull moment. If I'm to pin point this film's flaw, it's obviously Cong's cameo lol.I just love this film very much, can't wait to see what's next.",15/10/2025,positive,0.997914612,0

Quezon,"I like this take on Quezon better than that of Quezon's game. This film showcased Quezon as a caudillo lite politician (which he is) but its only limited to that. It only showed his performance not the consequences of his actions, The film glazed all of the events in history that without the necessary context you will probably be lost on them. Some moments it feels like a sparknotes entry on Quezon's career rather than a far more deeper look into these events and how it affects him. In hidisght tho, Jericho Rosales managed to do Quezon so well that his visuals never really distract me. If there is going to be a Ramon Magsasay film, hopefully it will be the same approach as this one because I do not want a film that is only showcased the ""heroism"" of Magsasay but rather the consequences of a Magsaysay"" (basically politicians tried to emulate his charisma and personality).

Quezon,"Jones Law. Tydings–McDuffie. Commonwealth. Republic. First president. The film playfully turns these terms we learned in school into a clear, engaging source of politically-charged cinematic plot. The sets are impressive and elevate the viewing (something we now often see in recent Pinoy history films), but focusing mostly on them would be a disservice to a competently written and made film. I was entertained, with twists that made familiar Sibika lessons feel new.Lowkey and right after watching Cinemartyrs from Cinemalaya, Quezon is another film that champions women in the early history of Philippine cinema. Similarly from Cinemartyrs, it also considers America's influence on the country, for better or worse. Independence still feels like a concept, and it has fostered a culture of gratitude that can imply a sense of inferiority, even up to now. Jerrold Tarog always has something to say about these things, showing how far people will go for power. Change the world or seek power or both, it's the same old story. Even before Philippine independence, that was the world. Nothing new there, but it is a welcome reminder.Seems like Jerrold Tarog is not just done yet. And that should be exciting. Although like our thoughts about Villeneuve making franchise films, it would be nice to see Tarog go back to modernly-set films. Maybe it's just a phase and this isn't new for directors locally or internationally.",17/10/2025,positive,0.990744412,0

Quezon,"Quezon isn’t just another film. It’s a bridge between the raw, emotional grit of indie cinema and the accessibility of mainstream storytelling. At its core, it’s a story about a protagonist who feels more like an anti-hero. Quezon could easily fit the mold of a Marvel villain, his intentions are clear and rooted in conviction, but he’ll do whatever it takes to achieve them. It’s all about perception, really, and how morality can shift depending on where you stand. Di siya masamang tao. Pero willing siya gawin ang lahat. Para sa kanya or para sa bayan niya? On the technical side, the film shines. The use of parallelism, the sharp direction of Jerrold Tarog, and the deliberate framing from Pong’s cinematography all reflect a meticulous attention to detail. As an aspiring filmmaker and cinephile, you’ll find yourself appreciating every choice they made; nothing feels accidental.The performances are equally impressive. Every actor fully embodies their role, responding naturally to one another. There’s no unnecessary showboating, no scene-stealing, just grounded, organic acting that serves the story.Emotionally, Quezon hits hard. It’s not an easy watch, but it’s a necessary one. The film mirrors the pain and complexity of the times we live in. It feels like an origin story for where we are as a nation today.As a frustrated creative from the Philippines, this is the kind of film that makes you proud. Quezon is proof that we can create something deeply cinematic, intelligent, and emotionally resonant, something that can stand proudly on the international stage.",17/10/2025,positive,0.967221856,0
Quezon,"1) Being in the “Bayani”-verse is kinda funny when you watch. Is this what we really consider a national hero?2) This is a historical film, so I’m expecting to revisit and just know about the things that have happened during the days I wasn’t even born, but why does the film feel so familiar as if I’ve seen this all before?3) These are the things you don’t learn in school.And I blame all these with the decision-making of Filipinos rooted from how our “leaders” led by example. Dala-dala natin ang kultura at pag-iisip na ito hanggang ngayon. Sobrang nakakalungkot. And even when presented with real change and solution, it’s still not enough for us to realize.I understand now that one review saying this film is meant to be watched in the cinemas, as it will surely give a different feel when just watched on streaming platforms. The Philippines surely is just a whole ass drama that we’re currently living in.The history repeats itself, indeed.

Quezon,"Great filmmaking. Great shots. Great music. Great editing. But I felt nothing. Was I supposed to conclude that corruption, manipulation and politics go together since time immemorial? Don't I know that already? Doesn't everyone? And even if I did not, if that was all that I needed to realize by film's end, that was not much. That information could have been good for a documentary to explore and analyze. This drama bored me because it was not dramatic enough. A tragic figure, who doesn't change or is pulled further into sad or wrong choices, has to be set up as someone who seems heroic or as one who is given a chance to change his ways by the middle of the film. For all its freneticism, it droned. I think it wanted to be entertaining like a Scorsese or a Chazelle, but the writing caused a pacing problem. Also wondered if anyone who did not have an idea of who Quezon was would be invested in knowing why this is important to see for any human being. I wish all this technique was used on a good screenplay.",17/10/2025,positive,0.719823003,0

Instead, I sat through two hours of people suggesting that Quezon wasn't what he seemed, until we saw his camp sell the Philippines literally towards the end of the fucking movie in a throwaway scene. Why the fuck is the Big Bad Thing they used to make Quezon look like a bad guy was having his first wife literally walk plaintively around the assembly hall So many issues, there was a good movie in here somewhere many drafts ago.

Quezon,"""Bayan o sarili, pumili ka?""The Bayaniverse may have ultimately been a series of movies that are (if not for the same cast members/ completely standalone, but the bigger picture it paints is asking us the same question John Arcilla's Heneral Antonio Luna once asked a decade ago: ""Bayan o sarili?""""Heneral Luna"" is about a man who is dedicated to giving the country its rightfully earned freedom, no matter who he has to piss off to get it.""Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral"" is about a man who ultimately takes the fight, despite his selfish and somewhat childish nature.""Quezon"" is about a man who is nothing but a slimy and greedy politician who uses the country's independence as a bargaining chip so he can gain power and keep it for as long as he lives.The movie tells us outright that Quezon is not a good man, nor is he the hero of this story. He is a villain who uses every dirty trick in the book to remain one step ahead. It paints a picture of Quezon that is all too familiar to the everyday Filipino: a politician who plays dirty games to gain sympathy so they can climb higher into power.I love how Joven Hernando, who has always been the audience surrogate, has become a more active participant in the story. He becomes one of Quezon's pawns, another piece he could use to further his agenda. And once Joven reverts to his roots and once again becomes an observer, that's when the rug is pulled from under him.Joven is human. He is just like the ""heroes"" we've followed throughout the trilogy, flawed.Quezon brings the Bayaniverse into a solid finish, bringing back everything that came from Luna and Goyo all so it can ultimately tell the big punchline: Aguinaldo outlived every single one of the people we've followed in this trilogy.The Bayaniverse doesn't treat each and every single one of its focus as a holier-than-thou hero, but rather, humans who are just as flawed as everyone else. And in this landscape where every other biopic in the Philippines is treated like a glorified Wikipedia list, it's a breath of fresh air.Now, nobody knows what happens after this movie, after Bayaniverse. Who knows, maybe the Magsaysay tease could lead into a new trilogy that once again examines the Philippines and how we've become who we are today. Whether that happens or not, I'm glad we got to see these three movies come to life, the long way round. And if this does lead to another trilogy of movies, you know where I'll be.(P.S. Docking one star because the movie's soundtrack is sang by the jootsex guy.)",17/10/2025,positive,0.954176366,0

Quezon,"One of those movies you are just so incredibly engrossed in that you don’t even realize how long it actually is To utilize a film within a film was amazing to watch because of its simple yet amusing execution, not to mention its accuracy and relevance during that time. To see lessons and personalities I once learned in class brought to life was all the more fun… na para bang napapanood ko na lahat unfold with my own two eyes ! And lastly, to see the mischievous games and calculated steps & agenda that transpire within the government was insane, funny, compelling, nakakagalit, nakakainis, and overall nakakagulo ng isip kasi hindi mo alam sino papanigan mo……. Which is the point. These political leaders are meant to be humanized. They are complex and abundant of fault. Sabi nga ni Quezon, in order to lead the nation in prosperity he needs to get his hands dirty from time to time. Everyone in this cast was remarkable, lalo na sina Jericho Rosales and Romnick Sarmenta. Their performance in this film gave justice to the brilliance of Quezon, as well as Osmeña. All in all, napakahusay talaga. As usual. Everyone watch Quezon. PLEASE. Sobrang importante ng pelikulang ‘to especially in a time where political games and corruption remain to prevail.

Quezon,"A long, amoral dance between people who enjoy playing dirty games. Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted—as my partner remarked, it was less of a board game and more of a sarswela.The narrarive itself could’ve trimmed a lot of fat. It felt like the makers wanted to provide all relevant facts while at the same time letting the people decide for themselves. I think that if this series hadn’t gotten too meta, too self-conscious about its actual effect on Philippine society, it could’ve really been more courageous and straightforward.Hearing Jericho Rosales speak was jarring at first—having known him as an affable romantic lead—but he dissolves into his playful characterization. Women were also there, but they didn’t really do much to move the story along, or at all participate in it—perhaps a choice in storytelling, and a subconscious tendency that may need to be reflected on.All in all, extremely fun!",17/10/2025,positive,0.996817708,0

It’s really depressing that despite Quezon happening a few decades after the death of Heneral Luna and Goyo, the Philippines was still suffering with the same issue. Actually it has been decades (nearing 100 years) since the Commonwealth period and a century since Heneral Luna’s time and we are still facing the SAME issue now.

Quezon,"What a beautifully shot film that screams “sarswela” from start to end. As remarked by my partner, political dramas told by pinoys for pinoys are best presented in a comedic angle with the frequent spoonfeeding just to make sure the audience is caught up. This is personified by Joven’s character with the insistent need to have a third person pov to narrate the story (similar to Himala’s Orly), rather than just showing the events for what they are, otherwise the narrative can’t be controlled. Further amplified in the scene of Wood asking if Filipinos actually understood what “independence” truly meant. Maybe that’s the point of sandwiching humor (today: memes) in the gravity of our political state, it’s still relevant to the sarswela we have in the government today.The theme of storytelling through film does hit a very important mark in this trilogy— how heneral luna influenced the rise of a strongman president, and how it circled back in this third installation portraying the power of politcal alliances, uniteam. Haha. I do want to point out how so filipino movie-coded this is, with, of course, using women’s suffering as a plot device to move men’s story forward! How necessary was it to use a rape case other than as a threat and show the title character as cocky(we already know that), or how it’s scandalous that he’s bigamous (we already know that), or how aurora is complicit to all these. And, at the end, bears nothing to the story. Honestly, all those parts could’ve been cut from the film and it would have still held up. Lastly, I was first distracted looking at Jericho Rosales and not think of Echo the Hunk. By the end of the film he was truly Quezon to me.

Quezon,"I can never forget the optional reading given to us in Kasaysayan 1 class by Prof. Karl Poblador. It was Alfred McCoy’s paper “Quezon's Commonwealth: The Emergence of Philippine Authoritarianism”. I was shocked at first at how absurd the title seemed. Quezon being the blueprint of dictators like Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and Rodrigo Duterte seemed like a stretch.The common Filipino mostly associates Manuel L. Quezon with positive things. The Father of Philippine Independence. The face on the P20 bill. Ama ng Wikang Pambansa. Namesake of the most populous (maybe even the best) city in the country. Strangely though, historical films about the struggle for Philippine independence rarely focus on the life of the first President of the Commonwealth. There are countless cinematic imaginations of figures like Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, and Emilio Aguinaldo. But I can only remember one film about Quezon, the very bland Schindler’s List knock off Quezon’s Game. Quezon is portrayed as a stoic hero, allowing Jewish people to seek refuge as Nazis and World War II circle in on the country. After reading McCoy and watching Jerrold Tarog’s film, that film even looks worse. Tarog’s Quezon is what exactly the country needs right now. A repudiation of the myth of a “Great Man” and his legacy. A stark reminder of the illusion of Philippine independence and the role of native elites in perpetuating the very system the foreign colonizers used for subjugation. The election race between Aguinaldo and Quezon, framed as a battle between the old and the new, even resembles the upcoming 2028 presidential race between the Marcos and the Duterte dynasties. A choice between two evils. The screenplay is impressive in its weaving of multiple timelines in Quezon’s political career, examining the key relationships (Sergio Osmeña, Emilio Aguinaldo, Leonard Wood, the fictional Joven Hernando) that defined it. It reminds me of The Social Network and Oppenheimer in its nonlinearity, an always welcome structure compared to the dominant cradle to grave biopic structure. Black and white 1930-style sequences, featuring the best looking shots of an otherwise blandly photographed and colored film, frame the entire narrative. And it is here where Tarrog’s screenplay surprises in its examination of the role of cinema in political propaganda and collective imagination. Joven, the Bayaniverse’s audience surrogate, finally becomes a compelling character, as he wrestles with supporting Quezon’s presidency.The humorous tone is another welcome approach, playing up the ironies of Quezon’s political decisions from being a collectivist ideologue to supporting the working class to slightly changing an independents act to take credit away from Osmeña. The tone is a good contrast to the rather dull self seriousness of the preceding Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral. Quezon is a comical figure: a petty, narcissistic, scheming con artist. A far cry from the image of a noble patriot many have. Jericho Rosales radiates an almost DiCaprio-like energy and charisma; the loudness of Rosales’s Quezon, in his verbal sparring and speeches, masks the shallowness of his intentions for independence.Tarrog’s screenplay does flounder with the theme of the hollowness of Philippine independence. “Do you know what independence means?”, asks Governor-General Wood to peasant Filipino farmers. The scene seems to be played for laughs at the expense of Filipinos who are portrayed as having a simplistic understanding of the meaning of freedom. Rather than further visualize the plight of working class Filipinos, the film does relegate them to the margins. The formation of Quezon City, the planned home for Manila’s laborers, is a pivotal moment in Quezon’s political career and the country’s history. And yet, the film omits or does not tackle what would have been a perfect illustration of Quezon’s contradictions. But, to the film’s credit, it is long enough already. Perhaps it’s best discussed by another film. Quezon is a rare biopic in this country. We’ve had cinematic deconstructions of Filipino heroes like Rizal and Aguinaldo already. But never has there been a film that demystifies a supposed hero as nothing more than an egotistical opportunist — not unlike the greedy and insincere politicians at the center of the ongoing DPWH flood control investigation. Even if the film has flaws in its bland cinematography and visualizing the struggle of working class Filipinos, it’s hard for me to not be riled up after watching Tarrog’s Quezon. That’s great enough for me.",15/10/2025,positive,0.870559335,0
Quezon,"The movie, “Quezon” by Jerrold Tarog completes the so-called BAYANIverse trilogy that also includes “Heneral Luna” and “Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral”. The trilogy (post-credit suggests a fourth biopic) was designed to deconstruct the myth surrounding Philippine national heroes by portraying them as flawed and complex human beings rather than perfect heroes we place on pedestals.This is an enjoyable, brisk, and highly opinionated biopic on Quezon. Making a film about history in an entertaining manner is always a challenge but Tarog and co-screenwriter Rody Vera passed with flying colors with a screenplay that intricately weaves historical facts with cinematic storytelling. They did this with the masterful insertion of fictional characters Joven Hernando and his daughter Nadia Hernando. They also avoided the pitfall biopics usually fall into—pointlessly following a chronological order and trying to present everything. Here, they used Quezon's political skirmishes with Leonard Wood, Sergio Osmeña and Emilio Aguinaldo to tell the story of the consummate politician.Kudos to Jericho Rosales for his portrayal of Quezon: temperamental, mercurial, and unpredictable. I had my doubts if he could pull it off when I saw the trailer but happy to have been proven wrong. He is at his best when attempting to charm his way out of a predicament and outwitting his adversaries. Quezon is undoubtedly a compelling and complex individual. “Elastic, electric”; “one of the world’s supplest and hardest-boiled practical politician”; these were some of the words used by John Gunther in an article for January 1939 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. But such reading of the man who became President of the Philippine Commonwealth, Gunther noted, was “only a fraction of the complex, composite truth”. The movie portrays Quezon as Machiavellian—scheming, manipulative, and self-interested. He bossed legislators using the largesse at his disposal, and by threatening them with political ostracism. He valued the loyalty and gratitude of those around him. He would reward those who helped and followed him with jobs and pensions. This is clearly portrayed in his relationship with Emilio Aguinaldo, whose farm and pension he took away when the latter dared to run against him in the country’s first ever elections. But Quezon was also “a genuine revolutionary” as Gunther noted, “the history of the Philippine Islands in the twentieth century and the biography of Manuel Quezon are indissolubly one”. He was also loved by the masses because of his support for the marginalized. He was the one who set minimum wages for government laborers, established an eight-hour working day, and slapped higher taxes on the rich. I had to rewatch Heneral Luna and Goyo before watching Quezon. I think the trilogy succeeded in reimagining these three heroes revealing more intricate, conflicted human beings. But I also hoped that the trilogy could have focused more on nation-building rather than personalities. I understand the need to focus on heroic personalities in these biopics but I hope viewers came out of cinemas not just thinking about heroes as history but also this: the road to nationhood and statehood is complicated. It is still unraveling today. It is still complicated.Saying that the Filipinos united against colonizers to fight for freedom and become one nation is naive. To be fair, Tarog hinted at this in Heneral Luna and Goyo by depicting the regional differences of the revolutionaries and how it contributed to Aguinaldo’s defeat. But can we blame the Ilocanos or the Kapampangans? The revolutionaries from the different regions were fighting for a nation that wasn't there yet. This was Jose Rizal’s obsession during his time—the lack of a national consciousness. He spent, and offered, his life to lay the groundwork for a collective national identity, a shared sense of being a nation. Quezon was more pragmatic in his approach. He said, “In statecraft the most important thing is the goal.” In other words, the end justifies the means. Quezon, of course, would never publicly admit that the goal of independence from the United States is intrinsically tied to ambition. To his mind, what hurt would it do if the national goal and his interest align? One of the most powerful moments in the film was when Joven was pontificating in front of Quezon, berating him for his greed and scheming ways. Quezon then turned the tables around telling Joven that he was in fact an accomplice because he also benefitted from Quezon. The US role in all these should not be diminished. By organizing local elections they essentially empowered local warlords to acquire power setting the stage for their capture of central government.There were instances when the movie relied too much on commentaries rather than storytelling. I really appreciate movies, especially those with political and social messages, that exercise restraint—when it does not tell us how to feel and what to think. Rather than spoon-feeding us it is more important to give us the opportunity to decide for ourselves.",15/10/2025,positive,0.992618978,0

Quezon,"The third movie in the franchise and I love how distinct each movie's tone from one another. Inspired by the American colonial era and Hollywood influence, Quezon proved how entertainment, facade, and shallow promises built the system of the Philippine politics. How can a belief rooted on community and collectivism, utang na loob, be used as a tool to advance evil and selfish desires?Jericho Rosales's portrayal of the former president captures raw greed and charming manipulation despite moments of animated dialogue.

Quezon,"This film is a sharp contrast to Henral Luna and Goyo, but somehow it blends in. It is the same game in a new mask—the same battle in a different battlefield. It has always caught my interest that the Bayani-verse shows the humanity in figures revered by their good actions in the past. It grounds the character to a playing field in which we can analyze their actions and flaws as if they are not above us at all. It gives the audience space to ponder the differences between the praises given on history books and the reality of the human experience. Film is always such an amazing platform for storytelling in ways that capture essence and displays an overarching sense of humor in our lives even in serious moments.Quezon concludes the first battle by showing us that in war or in the pursuit of independence, politics has always been the same. It is rooted in tactics and is played out as a game. Battle of minds and leverage is the front of all this. A greater focus should be on the sequence in which they discuss the readiness of the country for independence. From now and then, the comprehension of concepts allows the nation to grasp what it wants. If the word independence could not be understood before, now it has ballooned to so much more. Terms that now hide from the public to understand. Watching this film, the people behind me were in shock when the word communist was mentioned. I knew there and then that they do not know the concept of this ideology much like the Filipinos that did not understand independence. In the very seats that welcome watchers is also the very seats that criticizes us. Anyways—preparing for the teaser shown as a mid credit scene. I expect a lot considering the impact of the bayani verse to the film industry, to Filipino culture, and Philippine perception. Magsaysay!",18/10/2025,positive,0.984177113,0

Quezon,"“Mauuna pa atang pumuti ang uwak kaysa bitawan mo ‘yang kapangyarihan mo.”Unlike the first two installments of the Bayaniverse, Quezon throws all subtlety out the window and says everything straight to your face. I took an elective on the History of the Philippine Presidency last semester, and we spent almost half of it just talking about Quezon. Watching the film felt exactly like that — a two-hour lecture where all the facts are dumped on you. Maybe that's not entirely a bad thing. Maybe it's better that there's no room for misinterpretation or assumptions of what the film wants to say. Maybe that's what we need as a nation: to be told, directly and unapologetically, what needs to be done for us to become better.Quezon feels painfully familiar because everything in it mirrors our current news cycle — a political shitshow where those in power do everything to hold on to it. At first, it’s laughable. But eventually, it stops being funny, and we’re just left angry.We deserve better than someone like Quezon. We deserve better than leaders obsessed with themselves but blind to the people they’re supposed to serve. We deserve better than naming cities after them or printing their faces on our money. We need to stop turning flawed men into untouchable icons and start being honest about what their legacies should look like.Tarog’s meta-commentary in this third installment is interesting, but the constant switching between the younger and older versions of the characters can get confusing. I get what he’s trying to do. He wants us to remind that history can be reconstructed or reinterpreted, but sometimes it pulls the story away from having emotional or narrative depth.That said, the ensemble was great, but Karylle was especially exceptional. The unsure, restrained, and quiet glances she gives when the camera lingers on her say so much about a woman’s place in our nation’s fight for independence: sidelined and often overlooked. As her character tells his husband, “Naniniwala akong naniniwala kang tama ‘yang pinaglalaban mo.”With Tarog’s Bayaniverse coming to a close (or is it?), it feels like the fight that should’ve started long ago is only just beginning. Saying “we should fight” can get tiring and repetitive, but then again, maybe that’s why films like this still matter. Because we still see leaders like Quezon today.

Quezon,"Manuel Luis Quezon (Benjamin Alves as the younger version) inside the prison cell at the beginning of the film submits to a calling he himself invokes,an act of total surrender to the shining light of messianic delusion: he as a vanguard of freedom,a savior of the nation. This scene lays down the very blueprint of the man, and the DNA of the third film of Jerrold Tarog's Bayaniverse shown at such a time as this. Tarrog's deconstruction of Manuel Quezon easily reveals a pattern, the four chapters proving how the Commonwealth figure wields power. The film depicts Joven Hernando (Aaron Villaflor/Cris Villanueva) as the conflicted source of truth and keeper of lies, he being witness to the former and he being made to hide the latter. Quezon ought to strip Hernando of his journalistic freedom lest he (Hernando) destroy the masses' perception of the politician. Cassey, as the Americans call Quezon,orders silence as a tool that the film also uses to depict politics as a performance where Cassey plays the main part and masters it to perfection. Cassey's political campaign by way of showing silent films visualizes the performative act. A man plays someone he is not,living the dream so long as he has the power, so long as he is able to craft perception and accord himself the grandeur. His bouts against Sergio Osmeña (Romnick Sarmienta), Leonard Wood (Iain Glenn), and Emilio Aguinaldo (Mon Confiado) easily reflect what we see today: politics as a game, interests at the center, power as the ultimate goal. The scene where Quezon walks back to his seat after his speech while Aguinaldo walks towards the podium projects a duel reflective of the political motion that haunts our nation: each going a different direction but aiming for the same peak of dominance.The score is aptly dramatic and haunting, giving the scene the verve that seals what we make of our politicians--if we haven't settled that yet.Jericho Rosales brilliantly plays Manuel Quezon as the Senate President and the President of the Commonwealth by consistently creating the identity of the man who cannot be caught defeated. His performance naturally shows Quezon as a larger-than-life figure, the center around which everything revolves. That the film depicts him in this magnitude makes everyone else small, especially the masses whom he declares he works for.But not only are they rendered small; they are also voiceless and invisible. When a poor man defines independence as food, the film unmistakably captures power and its fuel. It rightfully pictures the masses being the ultimate victims of the fraud that is politics, the victims of the insatiable dreams of the narcissists where they (masses) are subconsciously the empaths that support their (narcissists) fantasy.And so we laugh because the film is a farce as much as it is a political drama whose emotional interjection comes at the far end of the spectacle. It comes as a silent wave of heartbreak and desperation. For ourselves. For our nation. How else should the film show Quezon at the end but the way the film does? Did his dreams come true? At a point where he no longer has influence,what are the words that matter? The film serves the closure we deserve from a man we've come to know from the very beginning,the consistency Quezon can never make himself to break because his nature will never allow it. His last words affirm his fantasy.Saying ""I am the Philippines"" can never be more delusional. To this day, we continue to see this delusion. And it harms us more than ever.",18/10/2025,positive,0.944467485,0

Quezon,Ahhhh. This movie is so good. I know that this is a story based on Quezon but this is just as timely as it could have been with all the political statements that they have showed us here. I think it is truly important to note how power can be intoxicating but we also have to be reminded as voters that we have power to put these people in positions. We should be more critical of them and make them understand that who they are serving are us and not themselves. The film also encapsulates how media can also be used to change narratives and we have seen that be weaponized in today's time as well. We need stories like these to remind us of where power should lie and how these politically corrupt actions can lead to our demise as a nation. There are good and bad sides to people but I think it is important to remember them both and not put anyone on a pedestal high enough for no one to reach them but instead make them understand where true power lies - in us.

With those editing and transitions, it feels like I’m watching a Coen Brothers’ film, and in the writing, he stays true to his style. Round of applause to Jericho Rosales for his accent and acting skills. He was a revelation in this movie, and every shot of him is just amazing to watch and left me in awe. Romnick Sarmenta and JC Santos are also fun to watch; well done. Having Iain Glen on this, as Leonard Wood, is just perfect for the role. Mon Confiado reprising the role as Emilio Aguinaldo—it really does suit him. The cinephile in me is in pure joy and tickled by this movie.In terms of the history, as Mark Twain says, “history repeats itself, but it often rhymes.” With the current situation in the Philippines, it reflects a lot, and it is sad to think that we’re in a cycle. The feeling that we’ve never learned our lesson from the past. Quezon using independence for power to get into a higher position, and the way he acts, he is the epitome of a “trapo.” With all things considered, it is hard to be a Filipino and to be hopeful that one day we will be able to elect someone who has a pure intention to help every Filipino and make decisions that are for the betterment of the Filipino people. Thank you, Jerrold Tarog, for continuing to create these movies. In this way—hopefully—Filipinos will reflect and learn something from the past, see the current situation of our country, and make better decisions for the future of our country.",18/10/2025,positive,0.997625887,0

Quezon,"Film Review: Quezon (dir. Jerrold Tarog, 2025)When I was young, Manuel Quezon was a romanticized figure, hailed as the one who earned the Philippines its independence, and also the “Father of the National Language.” Aside from that, I really know nothing about that guy.Several years later, I came across a copy of Ambeth Ocampo’s “Quezon’s Sukiyaki,” a collection of essays about several historical figures in Filipino history. It contained some interesting notes on Quezon’s boisterous nature. Further readings unraveled Quezon’s more devious side as a politician, which was the main theme of Jerrold Tarog’s newest film.“Quezon” chronicled the rise of the titular character from a veteran of the Filipino-American War to the president of the Philippine Commonwealth. The movie deviated from the typical depictions of the former president. Here we saw Quezon at his most unscrupulous, a true political chameleon. Whatever glazed images I had of the man evaporated after watching this movie. Suffice to say, Quezon was the original trapo. While it can be said that he genuinely cared about independence, he surely had his hands dirty, and his priority was after all, his own interests.Jericho Rosales was phenomenal in his role- adapting Quezon’s speech patterns and mannerisms. I was a bit skeptical when he was announced to be the lead, but Echo was a great actor after all and he surely proved it. Mon Confiado’s performance in this movie as Aguinaldo was a stark contrast from the other Bayaniverse films: the Aguinaldo in “Quezon” was more mellow, seemingly remorseful, softened by age. It was amazing of Mon to portray the same character in three different ways.The performance of the actors in this film was phenomenal, and I think everyone pulled their weight. I must specifically praise Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña. His bickering with Quezon was one of the film's highlights. I think “Quezon” was the most creative in all Bayaniverse films. I particularly liked the silent film snippets. It showed us the importance of media arts in shaping political opinions. I also appreciated the use of the rondalla as the main musical force of the movie: it made the movie sound more like a Filipino political comedy, compared to its militaristic predecessors. Compared to “Heneral Luna” and “Goyo” there were barely any action scenes in the movies. The battles were fought through verbal sparring, scheming, and persuasion. It was a unique Bayaniverse movie. I don't have many criticisms against this movie, although a certain cameo mildly soured my viewing experience. Also, I wish we saw more of the Japanese occupation, to see a different side of Quezon. I must say though, that the ending was hauntingly good. A great film, nonetheless.",18/10/2025,positive,0.964190423,0

Now, here comes the much awaited final film of the Bayani trilogy, at last.Quezon has a much refined commentary compared to the first two. It's well-paced. Couple of hours flew by quick. If Filipinos weren't brainwashed with fake news on a reel-to-reel basis for the past nine years, this film could've easily made an impact in our political landscape heavier than Luna ever did.Another quality film worth seeing in the big screen.

He was always dubbed as the “Father of the Filipino Language” and it didn’t help that he was my Grandpa’s favorite president ever. All I heard about Manuel was good things. This film shocked me, as the once perfect image I had of this “great” man (and I put quotation marks on that word because iykyk) was systematically debunked by the exposition of all his flaws. Direct Tarog succeeded in humanizing this man.Jericho really disappeared in this role, as I was convinced that he was a direct 1:1 copy of Mr. Quezon himself. The mannerisms, the intensity, the accent; he nailed it and really captured the swagger of this “great” man (again, iykyk).Mon Confiado is Mon Confiado, Rominick was great and very adorable as Osmeña, Iain Glen was excellent also, despite only appearing briefly.I loved the music, the occasional slapstick comedy, and the silent film parts.

Quezon,"Simply an amazing film to end Tarog’s Bayani Trilogy. Quezon harnessed the strengths of its predecessors Heneral Luna and Goyo, producing a film with strong storytelling, great actors, and awesome cinematography. Although he did not physically look like the mestizo Casey, Jericho Rosales delivered an enigmatic performance well-deserving of acting awards. But among its merits, perhaps my favorite thing about Quezon is its pointed delivery of political critique not only towards the current administration but to the long history of corrupted, patronizing, and self-serving Philippine politics.I know for sure that it is not only me who feared that Quezon would end up sanitizing the former president’s image, as films about politicians and heroes tended to do so. But alas, Quezon was not usual biopic that mythologized the man — instead, it demystified him, reintroducing the former President that plastered his and his wife’s name all over his home province and the biggest city in Metro Manila. It was able to effectively deliver Manuel Luis Quezon as the cunning politician, borderline dictator that he is.Alongside his intelligent spiels and populist rhetoric, the film revealed the unapologetic and manipulative character of the 2nd President of the Philippine Republic — the man who laid the formula of political maneuvering for the politicians and would-be presidents after him, proving Alfred McCoy’s view that Quezon’s Commonwealth paved the way for Philippine authoritarianism.I do hope that Tarog continues to develop new historical fiction films in the future.

Though we know him as the Father of the Filipino Language, Social Reformist but behind all of it do you know his game politically? You'll see a Quezon that no one has seen before (textbook-wisely speaking). You'll see how he the dirty game in politics has already been in their age (he prolly learned it to the Gringos while he was in the States). You'll see him greedy and hungry for power and you know that he doesn't like when people do not make something good out of him. Connecting this movie Quezon's Game (2018), without giving any spoilers, the influence of MLQ to the whites is superior over Aguinaldo's stance. Speaking of Aguinaldo, this is where I think he's reaping what he had sowed the bad decisions he had done. Though you may fill pity for him because of what he had faced in the movie. You'll witness also how JOVEN that was beside MLQ throughout the movie to confront him and protested what he truly feels and that stands out because Joven, he witnessed the history and voices what a youth could've said it also before. I give this a SOLID NORTH (iykyk) 3.5/5 because there are things that could've been told more while Quezon's president (that Quezon's Game highlighted) and adds fuel to fire that Quezon did that and that yada yada.

Quezon,"Quezon closes out Jerrold Tarog's Bayaniverse as a farcical deconstruction of the idea that one ""Great Man"" can lead a nation to prosperity. With Joven as the audience surrogate of the trilogy, Tarog makes sure that this myth is shattered. We see Joven slowly but surely become disillusioned as he realizes the dangers of putting a face to a political movement. Gone are the days where he puts these strong and charismatic men on a pedestal. This film feels the most pointed of the trilogy. Tarog's screenplay feels quite self-conscious as it sometimes overexplains itself. This film really wants to make a point amidst today's political turmoil. Politics is a game. It paints Quezon as a charismatic yet narcissistic manipulator who knew how to play it so well that he may just be the showman who invented political chess. He's basically a glorified ""trapo"" who's tidied up by our history books with titles like ""Ama ng Wikang Pambansa."" His methods are the reason why Filipinos today are so swept up by populist and charismatic leaders. Whether we like it or not, his methods paved the way for the dominance of ""trapos"" in our Senate today. On the other hand, I feel like the lack of subtlety did remove the nuances and gray areas that I was looking for in a take like this. It does become just a fight between good and evil in some parts. For one, I did not understand the choice of glazing over Aguinaldo in this when even he lead a regime built upon manipulation. Felt like Tarog retracted from his stance against Aguinaldo in Heneral Luna where he was heavily villainized (deservedly so) in that third act. I also wanted more nuance with its take on Quezon himself. He was quite the showman who shifted his principles and narratives when it's convenient for him. I guess I just wanted more moments of self awareness and reckoning from him. Him being an egotistical maniac just felt a bit too clean and clear cut. Loved how Jericho Rosales just threw himself into this role though. Even if he is over the top, you really buy the charms and sales talking that he does in the film. Despite my gripes with it, I do think this is a refreshing historical biopic and I like how it played with its structure. It wants to make a point and it delivers with clarity and conviction. I ultimately do think this is a national hero biopic that we deserve right now as a nation. Something that will serve as a caveat and hopefully, an antidote to our deep fanaticisms with populists and demagogues.",18/10/2025,positive,0.95796138,0

Quezon,"Tarrog’s most scathing work on a historical figure yet. At times, it can border into the saccharine, but that can be forgiven in consideration of the necessity for its themes to be communicated to the widest possible audience. However, much less forgivable is that in establishing Quezon’s manipulative and underhanded methods in politics, it may have presented his contemporaries, even the Americans, in a less critical light. Quezon becomes so comically evil towards the end that he makes everyone else look like saints.And yet, even as you grow to despise Quezon more and more, Jericho Rosales’ performance transfixes and commands attention. It should be praised that a portrayal that slimy and morally despicable continues to compel and leave you hanging on his every word. If not for the historical accuracy, a criteria I can’t attest to, watch this one for Rosales’ performance alone.",18/10/2025,positive,0.877016664,0

We are still paying for the crimes Quezon committed and the peak form of it has been achieved by no less than Duterte who couldn't even be moreso the antithesis to everything MLQ lectured upon. Jerico Rosales brings an exuding energy I haven't felt in any historical film in a long while. The versatile Mon Confiado nails Emilio Aguinaldo to a tee. The writing was great but too much at times. Directing did not overplay nor stumble in the length of Quezon's regime. Ultimately, body and soul was really the gameplay from the Battle of Tirad Pass to his death.

Quezon,"“a house divided against itself must fall” its been a few hours since i’ve seen this film because i want to digest everything that i can from the film before writing a review. i haven’t seen the previous films in such a long time but i do think this is the best one from bayaniverse. this has been one of my most anticipated films this year and man it did not disappoint. since i saw the trailer i knew it was promising and seeing it today i can honestly say that it exceeded my expectations. i love that the movie didn't shy away from criticizing quezon and showing us exactly who he really is? unlike the books from school that made him look like a great man the way it did with that propaganda movie that nadia made for his presidential campaign. when it comes to history talaga you really do have to read more than what they teach you from school (and its books) because if you haven’t i think people would've been so shocked at how disgusting and evil quezon is. quezon is exactly the reason why we have the type of politicians we have now, it started with him and it’ll continue to infiltrate the government as years goes by if we don’t do anything about it. a chameleon who changes its skin with every person he interacts with, even his own wife and friends to reap its benefits. to quezon the country is just a game to be played with and as long as it makes him look good and he comes out at the top he will continue to play that game until his last breath, hence, “I am the Philippines”.incredible incredible acting performance from every single actors in this cast especially jericho rosales who is undoubtedly the stand out, he really reminded everyone how great of an actor he is wow. other than jericho of course, we also have mon confiado, romnick sarmenta, cris villanueva, and benjamin alves who stood out as well but lets not forget the women who supported this actors. karylle, ana abad santos, and angeli agbayani who wasn’t able to do much or even say much but you can feel and see everything that theyre feeling in their face, and especially their eyes, the subtleties of it all made such a huge impact. although i do wish that we were able to hear from them more, to know about their thoughts and feelings, to ser them more than as the wives of these men. especially with aurora who stuck by him and so loyal to him till the very end despite him being an unloyal douchebag. the film is so creative as well, its like watching a movie within a movie. the cinematography is so so so beautiful, theres this specific shot towards the end —kudos to the editing as well i got goosebumps with the back and forth between quezon and aguinaldo doing their campaign and its contrast— where they were calling aguinaldo a traitor, such a good fucking shot wow. sound design and production design are undoubtedly incredible as well. i do think theres still so much to say about this film but i think this is all i got for today. i however cannot wait to see this again — hopefully soon — in streaming so i can pick up the parts and pieces i have missed during the first watch. tl;dr this is a good ass fucking movie and i had an incredible cinematic experience which is made even better because mon confiado and benjamin alves showed up at our screening",18/10/2025,positive,0.995732725,0

Quezon,"Would’ve been a 4-5!! The color grading was unexpected for a film that tackled the Philippine Commonwealth. It felt off, almost too modern for the time period it was supposed to capture. The play on jazz tried to reflect how playful and full of tricks Quezon was, but it ended up feeling out of place rather than symbolic. Watching it with the expectation that it would have the same weight or sharpness as Goyo or General Luna, medyo wala siyang dating. It lacked the same power, emotion, and impact those films delivered.The storyline and its modern approach made a few interesting points, but overall, it felt just okay. The movie leaned in on how the Philippine press was going against the idea of too much “idealism” and not enough on honesty. The Philippines has always had issues with its government, and the film, while trying to shed light on a heroic act, missed the chance to question the systems and attitudes that kept those issues alive. Since the beginning, it’s always been about finding leaders who are good enough—but sometimes, films like this forget that good enough isn’t the same as good.",18/10/2025,positive,0.652443647,0

Quezon,"What if politics was really just about having flair and good theatrics? Unfortunately, it’s not a what if. Through the vibrant and bold filmmaking of dir. Tarog, the film explored the conquest of Manuel Quezon with all of its grit and glory. Personally liked the use of silent film and newspaper montages into the story, as well as the surprisingly heavy plot point of journalism throught the movie. Of course, Jericho Rosales portrayed the former President Quezon remarkably. His accent and mannerism was so animated and persuasive. But Mon Confiado’s iconic performance as Aguinaldo was my favorite. Sir Mon’s character throughout the Bayaniverse is definitely cemented in Philippine cinema history.Quezon serves as a stark reminder about the disheartening loop of our so-called “democracy” filled with figures vying for power using schemes and tricks. Sad to see that after 100 years, this has been our case — being a politician all boils down to the ability to sway the public’s opinion to one’s side with the incompetency to serve.With our current issues, this is for sure an essential watch. ‘Di dapat tayo magpapaloko sa mga trapong pera at kapangyarihan lang ang habol sa gobyerno.

It's impressive that they managed to make this biopic without full reverence to the subject matter.This also feels like the best potential of a Filipino historical biopic. Everything feels lush, and the scope feels big, and yet it's a personal and intimate story about an event that will have prolonged effects in the future to come. The entire cast was great, especially Jericho Rosales, Mon Confiado, and Romnick Sarmenta. The ending was sublime.The film reminds us that we're long overdue for a political reform.

But when the scene shifts to Aguinaldo, everything becomes dark and gloomy, representing the old republic. (I’m mind-blown!!!)BUT MY REAL TAKE HERE IS!!!This movie perfectly depicts our political system!!! politicians hungry for power, cronies filling every seat in the cabinet, Filipinos against Filipinos, and a lack of knowledge when it comes to voting and the law. All these problems are beautifully portrayed through Jerrold Tarog’s storytelling!!",18/10/2025,positive,0.975715637,0

Quezon,"Planned to rewatch Heneral Luna and Goyo first before catching this so I could have a more comprehensive picture, but I couldn't find the time to do so.That being said, I'm a huge fan of the first two entries and the concept of this franchise as a whole. It's always interesting to me when films or any form of media provide a deconstruction and humanization of historical figures who are otherwise just names in our minds carved by our history lessons. With this kind of movies, our heroes become flawed men, far from the shallow descriptions in lectures and closer to the people in power currently governing our countries. With that, everything becomes much more real, and much more depressing.The campaign film gimmick is an endearing choice, and it definitely made the story livelier and much more engrossing. This film, unlike its predecessors, is less on guns and bombs and more of battles fought in the realm of politics. For Quezon, it's all just a game. And he's bloody good at it. The chapters entertainingly break down how Quezon is an early manifestation of a trapo, arrogantly moving to serve his personal interests at the expense of true service to the people.What stood out to me the most is this film's depiction of the arts (e.g. film) and the press (e.g. newspapers). It deftly demonstrated how both can be weaponized by the state to spread its propaganda, often to the point of manipulation and deception. It rings true up to now.",17/10/2025,positive,0.991895735,0

Quezon,"PUTANG INA TALAGA NG SISTEMA NG PILIPINAS.noon, hanggang ngayon, ginagawang laro ang politika natin. if Luna and Goyo tried to humanize their protagonists, Quezon DE-HUMANIZES its own. the film's storytelling is non-linear, so makikita mo sa una na nanalo si Quezon as President (makikita mo na agad kung paano siya maglaro ng politika sa opening scene pa lang), then cut to Aguinaldo, stating na he's been cheated with (sa una akala mo sore loser lang si aguinaldo), then as the film progress, we sympathize with Aguinalado more than Quezon, with how the latter is manipulative and ruthless with his politics, na para bang si Quezon ang antagonist sa sarili niyang biopic. i just want to applaud the filmmakers by showing the relevant social issues of our country within a historical context, at the cost of creative liberties (tangina di ko talaga inexpect si Janolino kahit nagpakita siya sa trailer). cinematography is still superb, music just fits the whole vibe of the film, and the ACTORS/ACTRESSES putangina, walang tapon na acting sa film na toh, Jericho Rosales really embodies Quezon's swag, arrogance, and THE FUCKING ACCENT (mas malutong pa mag mura kesa kay Luna eh). the ending just gives me chills, like makikita mo talaga na concerned si Osmeña sa kalagayan ni Quezon, but yung outburst ni Quezon made me re-think about the popular line ""I am the Philippines"" of Quezon. Pinapalakas ng pelikulang toh ang pag-kwestyon ko sa motibo ng iba't-ibang politiko natin ngayon, and sa tingin ko yun din naman ang gusto ipahayag ng mga filmmakers nito. anyways, such a 10/10 film.+++TAWANG-TAWA AKO DUN SA ""AGUINALDO OUTLIVED ALL THREE"" LINE SA CREDITS NA PARA BANG SIYA SI ENRILE.",18/10/2025,positive,0.957376778,0
Quezon,"This is by far the weakest installment in Tarog's Bayaniverse, and yet a strong start for an ""experimental screenplay"" by the director. Tarog isn’t just known for his heroic-themed films but also for horror works like Shake, Rattle & Roll. This time, however, it's different. He used plenty of comedic acts—so much that I almost forgot the film was a drama—which made it feel very unconventional and rare for him to explore such an approach.Still, he was clever and creative for going unorthodox, especially since the film revolves around sheer politics. It was dense with overwhelming dialogue. Perhaps he decided to use comedy to maintain the audience’s attentiveness, as casual moviegoers tend to have short attention spans and might easily doze off. I think it was intentional, and he just saved his cinema from a bland, dull, and boring screenplay.As for the main character, Jericho Rosales did excellently in this film. He gave an astounding performance as Quezon—enough to provoke the audience’s emotions. The mannerisms, gestures, and expressions were on point. However, I believe there might still be another actor who could’ve portrayed Quezon better, as there were scenes where the acting felt somewhat unnatural, as if he was ""acting an acting."" On the side of fiction, Joven’s monologue never disappoints! From Luna to Goyo to Quezon, the consistency is just commendable.In addition, I really loved Tarog's uniqueness with his cinematic strategies on how he delivered the story of Quezon, plus the coin as an allegory, which is something I couldn’t explain in detail because it’s better if you watch it on the big screen. I still have a lot in mind, but I wish I were that diligent to write it all down. Anyway, this film is rated as a standalone piece, not part of the trilogy when the first two are taken into account.Overall, the film was entertaining, and the production was, as always, all-out. If you can, please watch it in cinemas. It’s worth watching.P.S. Kaya pala naging barya ang bente kasi dasurb nya???P.P.S.

While not completely dissimilar to the Bayaniverse Trilogy, Jerrold Tarog made it comedic and hilarious without compromising the historical storyteling. In traditional fashion, I expected a censored coverage of Quezon’s life, but I was left stunned at how they told atleast most of it. While only knowing a few of his life, it felt like I’ve seen and known him; primarily because he perfected the traditional politics we see today. Although he was not the one to initiate it, he did it so masterfully that his political approach remained in place until the present.Like what Ms. Marian Roces stated, it is already given that the film is relevant, but the real battle is how it would translate into discussions among the masses and questioning of how we would define a Filipino hero.JERICHO ROSALES CAMPAIGN IS NOW!!!!!!Huge thanks to Dakila & Active Vista for organizing a special block screening and a talkback session!",18/10/2025,positive,0.979965806,0

Quezon,"Alam naman natin na may katiwalian sa pamahalaan dahil sa pamumulitika at sa pangingibabaw ng sariling interes kaysa maglingkod para sa kapakanan ng bayan. Nandiyan ang pork barrel scam noon at ang anomalya sa flood control projects ngayon. Pero bakit nga ba paulit-ulit natin sila binoboto? Sa panulat at direksiyon ni Jerrold Tarog, isa itong historical drama na tumatalakay sa buhay ng kinikilalang ikalawalang pangulo ng bansa na si Manuel Luis Quezon (Jericho Rosales) at kung paano niya nilaro ang politika. Ito ang pangatlo sa Bayaniverse ng nasabing direktor, una ang ""Heneral Luna"" (2015) at ikalawa ang ""Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral"" (2018). Sa higit na dalawang oras na takbo ng pelikula na puro diyalogo, napanatili nito ang aking interes dahil sa kakaibang direksiyon nito. Bukod sa paglalagay kay Joven Hernando (Cris Villanueva at Aaron Villaflor), nakatulong dito ang satirikong tono nito sa halip na isalaysay lamang ito nang tuwiran na makikita sa naunang dalawang pelikula. Nakatatawa na nga ang mga eksena, malalaman at maiuugnay mo pa ang mga patutsada sa kasalukuyang lagay ng politika sa bansa o sa sinumang politiko. Hindi naman kataka-taka na maitatagpi ito sa kalagayan ng pamahalaan ngayon. Ang may mas dating para sa akin ay ang gampanin ng mamamahayag sa lipunan. Ayon nga sa nalaman ko sa nadaluhang online seminar workshop para sa mga mag-aaral na mamamahayag at tagapayo ng pahayagang pampaaralan, walang obhetibo sa pamamahayag dahil may pinipiling anggulo ang tagapagbalita kaya mahalaga na maging mapanagutan at mapanuri sa isisiwalat tungo sa paghulma ng isipan at boses ng sambayanan. Kung patuloy na mas nagbibigay ng atensiyon ang mainstream na midya sa mga walang kawawaang paandar ng ilang opisyal, bago man o beterano, kaysa sa mga napapanahong isyu at adbokasiya, hindi na nakagugulat kapag nanalo ang mga ito kung sakaling tumakbo ito sa mas mataas na posisyon. Kitang-kita ito sa pelikula sa tulong ni Joven Hernando at ng kaniyang anak na si Nadya. Sumunod, kapuri-puri at kapani-paniwala ang pagganap ng mga artista. Noong una na nasa post-credit scene ng Goyo si Benjamin Alves bilang Manuel Quezon, nakakasabik dahil kamukha niya ito. Nang binago ito at naging si Jericho Rosales, nagtaka ako pero namangha pa rin kasi kamukha rin. Ngayong napanood ko sila pareho, palagay ko na tama na si Rosales ang gumanap dito. Kitang-kita sa kilos at pananalita at iisipin mo na si Quezon ang kaharap mo. Bukod dito, nag-iwan din ng impak ang ni Romnick Sarmenta bilang Sergio Osmeña at muling pagganap ni Mon Confiado bilang Hen. Emilio Aguinaldo. Hindi rin nagpahuli sina Karylle bilang asawa ni Quezon at Angeli Bayani bilang asawa ni Aguinaldo. Panghuli, nakatulong din ang disenyong pamproduksiyon upang maging kapani-paniwala hindi lamang ang pagganap ng mga tauhan pati na rin ang tagpuan ng pelikula. Nakapag-ambag din ang musika at tunog sa tono nito. Sa kabuuan, nagkaroon ako ng kawili-wiling karanasan sa panonood nito dahil sa bagong direksiyon, kapuri-puring pagganap, kapani-paniwalang disenyong pamproduksiyon, at angkop na musika at tunog sa pang-uuyam nito. Batid nga natin na may kanser sa ating lipunan ngunit bakit ba natin pinipili pa rin ang mga trapo? Dahil sila at sila pa rin naman ang tatakbo? Dahil kilala ang apelyido nila at may malawak na makinarya sa pangangampanya kaya naniniwala tayo na sila ang magpapaunlad sa atin? O dahil naging kuntento na lamang tayo sa paniniwala na kurakot naman silang lahat? Hindi man namamalayan ng karamihan ngunit may paniniwala na may ambag ang ""Heneral Luna"" sa kaisipan na ayos lamang na may palamurang pinuno. Sa ""Quezon"", nangangamba ako na baka ang mapulot lamang ng karamihan ay iboto na lang ang kahit na sino dahil tiwali rin naman silang lahat. Hetong Bayaniverse ang magsilbing paalala sa atin na huwag makuntento sa natatamasang kaginhawaan ngayon (kung mayroon man dahil sa mga pribilehiyo) sapagkat mas karapat-dapat pa na matamo natin ang tunay na mabuting pamumuno. Huwag tayong sumamba sa mga opisyal at pumanig sa kapuwa mamamayan. Maging mapanuri at manawagan tayo sa mga pinuno dahil ito ang ating gampanin bilang kanilang nasasakupan na nakararanas ng mga pagpapasiya nila sa pamamalakad sa bansa.",18/10/2025,positive,0.769803882,1

(parang endemic na sila atp) and for us non-reptilians, are we complicit in the ecosystem we live in?i read a review somewhere where they said this film is nothing but a mirror and tells us what we already know. but you know what? WE FILIPINOS ARE HARD HEADED! we forgive and forget like its breathing when we often shouldn’t. so yes, we do need this mirror up every single day until we learn. we can’t also expect this film to give us a solution to our recurrent (if not perpetual) problem. it being a mirror does not reduce its value in asking us what we want to do when we don’t like what we see in the looking glass.this installment of the trilogy finally made me un-demonize aguinaldo. he’s still shit but he isn’t the devil incarnate. just as we examine the meaning of “bayani”, we also get to examine those who have fallen from grace. mon confiado proves why he is el presidente in capturing the complexities of the man.echo truly did the role justice with the way he became a chameleon! i love the focus on this aspect of quezon especially when irl there have been 3 actors in the bayaniverse to play quezon (long live the quezon multiverse!). he will act and (literally) look different depending on his audience and what he can gain from them. this is why i don’t think we actually see the real quezon in each of these scenes. they’re all an act. its only when you piece them together where you can see a better picture of the guy. (and even then, you doubt yourself bc he has never been transparent) also, los sientos, i was confused for a few secs who was casey • needed more aurora scenes ! ! ! i loved how she put him in his place often even in the most gentle of ways. • i love the repeated use of the phrase “its not personal, its just politics” because POLITICS WILL ALWAYS BE PERSONAL! our personal values are what inform our political beliefs.• now it makes sense why we have joven and had him as the pov. in a way, we are joven.• if this film’s goal was to make people ask questions and feel things, they went WELL BEYOND that goal bc YES I HAVE MANY QUESTIONS AND YES I AM FEELING A LOT OF THINGS• pleasant surprises for the cameos• jack en poy by bullet dumas has a whole new meaning now • BITCH “I AM THE PHILIPPINES” WTF stop making me depressed • Serging my bias ",18/10/2025,positive,0.67370683,0

There is enough history lesson here to make one revisit old textbooks, and some of the issues surrounding the larger-than-life Manuel Luis Quezon are brought to light. My only gripe with this is that the script does very little to nothing with the issues presented. The film is only concerned with exposing MLQ as a flawed man --- perhaps as a reflection of the current Filipino politician who will do whatever it takes to amass power.I also found the portrayal of Aurora Quezon (Karylle) a little jarring. While there was an intention to highlight the immense potential of women to shape society (as with Therese Malvar's fimmaker character), Aurora on the other hand is given almost nothing to do but be a sounding to board to her husband (Jericho Rosales). In one climactic scene, where Quezon's secrets are thretatened to be exposed, the camera cuts to Aurora for a reaction shot --- and then nothing. The issue would no longer be discussed for the remainder of the film, and we never really see how Aurora views her husband in light of his duties as a husband, a father, a politician, and as a leader of a nation.The film also commits several sins of omission, including the portrayal of Leonard Wood as a mere bureaucrat, completely neglecting his involvement in the Bud Dajo Massacre in 1906.Nevertheless, the ensemble piece features several noteworthy performances, led, of course by Rosales as Quezon, Benjamin Alves as the younger Quezon, Mon Confiado, who will forever be associated with the Emilio Aguinaldo role, Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña, Cris Villanueva as an older Joven Hernando (a fictional character used to bridge the three films) and Iain Glen as Leonard Wood. Of the films in this trilogy, Aguinaldo gets the most interesting story arc in ""Quezon,"" as do Joven. The humor, too is at par with the best bits from ""Heneral Luna,"" which is fitting I guess because what is politics in the Philippines but a big farcical extravaganza? Something to commend here as well is the film's use of the silent film era to portray Quezon's rise to power, leveraging the power of images to form (or better yet, manipulate) public opinion. As ""Quezon"" takes place during the rise of cinematic consciousness around the world, it is nice to hear Murnau, Fritz Lang, Nepomuceno, and Harris and Tait mentioned in the same breath as the country's exodus towards independence from American rule. One thing I missed here was Epy Quizon's calming voice of reason as Apolinario Mabini, but by this timeline, Mabini is already dead (he died in 1903). Perhaps a voiceiver from the dead? Perhaps not.In closing, is ""Quezon"" a perfect film? Like the person it portrays, it is far from perfection. But is it provocative? Does it invite dialogue and introspection into our complicated history with truth, idolatry, and the persistence of patronage politics? Definitely.",19/10/2025,positive,0.864478409,0

Quezon,"written and directed with precision by tarrog, quezon is an entertaining and smart depiction of history's manchilds and the ""heroic"" games they play for the ""independence"" of the nation.its double-edged sword, however, is its effectivity in critiquing and being propaganda. while it critiques film as the very medium for this ideological and calculated systemic myth-making (we are rooting for comrade nadia), it also falls under this trap by centering narratives on the humanity of history's people with less attention to the bigger powers in play that hold the strings to these figures.by focusing on quezon’s child's play hiding over his performed wit and individual brilliance, the film risks personalizing what is, at its core, a systemic issue: that philippine politics has always been a performance crafted under the watchful eye of american imperialism. politicians will choose their ideological stance based on available choices, independence is highlighted as the goal of the masses who is alienated by its very language, and in every six years, we will be given choices for leaders who will never trully represent us.the film eventually reveals this control, but the critique is softened, overshadowed by the dramatized rivalry between the opportunist quezon and leonard wood, and other names in history. the bigger villain, the structure that rewards political ego and molds philippine politics and elections to all be a game, remains unscathed. it is named. but it seems like right now, like quezon, we end up turning toward the nearest villains — within reach, within us.",18/10/2025,positive,0.920804501,0

Quezon,"what’s interesting about bayaniverse — or perhaps, historical movies in general — is that you see these figures as human beings. there is this sort of doomed faith that the audience harbor, only to get disappointed with the characters’ actions, hence making it more humane. these people, despite being heroes, are fallible. as you get deeper into the film, you get to realize and understand why certain people act the way they do and how their brain works. it would be illegal to compare quezon to the two previous films namely luna and goyo’s. luna cultivated a sense of patriotism, leaning more on aggression and one’s burning desire, perfectly encapsulating antonio himself. on the other hand, goyo shifted its focus from war to the dilemma the young general is caught in, emphasizing how young he still is (GOYO MY FAVE FR + the OST made by direk je.

Quezon,"Been looking forward to this film forever. It’s one of those films in PH cinema that really stands out and feels well-invested. The cinematography was excellent, the sound was even better, and I have to say, the nuances of Osmeña and Quezon were portrayed accurately. The script was well writtenI especially loved how they showed Quezon’s lobbying skills, how he hinted, persuaded, and almost fed the egos of the members of the House and the Senate. It was both fascinating and nauseating to see how power was exchanged and traded so openly. It leaves you wondering whether this film makes you feel more hopeless and jaded, or simply resigned to the fact that you’re seeing the same things happen again & that none of it really surprises you anymoreAfter watching Luna before, I was left with frustration. Then came Goyo, which didn’t really resonate with me. But this one, this one did. I had been wondering how they would approach Quezon’s story. There’s been so much written about him, but I love how the film showed his showmanship, his dirty politics, and how he practically set the precedent for how politics are still played...manipulative, strategic, and all at onceAnd while this is a biopic, I think cinema about history should be done this way. If Goyo felt subpar compared to Luna in terms of cinematic and entertainment value, Quezon was endearing and powerful It makes you think, if politics were already that dirty back then, how much worse is it now, when people don’t even hide their corruption and proudly brand themselves as “noble” while stealing the people’s money?

Quezon,"if history were a movie, Quezon would be the scene where the lights stay on too long where the glamour fades and all that’s left is the politics, the pride, and the people pretending not to notice the cracks.i went in expecting something noble, something textbook. but what i got felt… human. painfully human. quezon (jericho rosales, absolutely magnetic) isn’t painted as a saint here he’s ambitious, clever, exhausted, and aware that being “good” doesn’t always win you the game. it’s that messy, moral middle ground where idealism meets ego, and somehow that felt more honest than any patriotic speech ever could.and then there’s aguinaldo. he’s not the villain not really. he’s just another man trying to keep his version of the world alive. it’s poetic in this haunting way that the movie reminds us: he was supposed to die early, yet outlived everyone. quezon. roxas. the whole lineup. and that irony? it stings. like history laughing quietly in the background.but what hit me hardest was how quezon shows corruption not as an event, but as a tradition. it’s not a scandal that shows up one day it’s baked into the foundation. this movie doesn’t even need to say it outright; you just feel it in every handshake, every campaign promise, every smile that lasts one second too long.by the end, i wasn’t just watching a historical biopic it felt like a loop. like we’ve been here before. same speeches, different microphones. same dreams, slightly more polished lies.Quezon isn’t perfect, but maybe that’s what makes it hit. it’s hopeful and heavy at the same time like loving a country that keeps breaking your heart but you can’t walk away because it’s yours.",19/10/2025,positive,0.976477206,0
Quezon,"If there’s an alamat of the pagiging Pinoy TraPo, maybe this is it... the origin story of politics as performance... (just for show, performative politicians ).""Masyadong maraming pulitiko sa bansa, kakaunti lamang ang mga lingkod-bayan.""I hate history classes, but I love revisiting history through travel, museums, and movies.  Quezon (2025) is exactly the kind of film that makes history come alive...even for those who never liked it.It’s funny, sharp, and feels like a political satire about the past that mirrors the present. The film follows former President Manuel L. Quezon’s political rise and how he played the game of politics brilliantly, but not always cleanly. If there’s an alamat of the Pinoy trapo, maybe this is it -- the origin story of politics as performance (just for show).Jericho Rosales nailed the role of Manuel L. Quezon. I’ve seen clips of the real Quezon before, and every time Rosales spoke, it felt like I was hearing the late president himself. They don’t even look alike, but he captured Quezon’s spirit perfectly. Benjamin Alves, who played the younger Quezon in the silent film sequences, also impressed me. Alves could easily carry the role in a full-length version too.Supporting actors also deserve credit. Romnick Sarmenta (as Osmeña) complements Rosales well. Karylle, as Aurora Quezon, was charming but underutilized, perhaps reflecting how women were sidelined back then. In contrast, Angeli Bayani, playing Aguinaldo’s wife, had limited screen time but left a strong impression. Mon Confiado’s take on Aguinaldo was refreshing, showing a more vulnerable side (though I still have to see the other movies in the Bayaniverse). Arron Villaflor and Cris Agustin, as Joven Hernando, were remarkable too,you almost forget they’re fictional characters.Though a biopic, the movie plays like a satire. It’s unserious but smartly so funny, biting, and painfully familiar. The humor lands because the parallels with today’s politics are impossible to ignore. Everything feels like ""pang front lang"" and the nation’s welfare often comes second to pride and image.As I said, it might just be the origin story of the Pinoy trapos. Maybe Quezon didn’t invent dirty politics but as Joven Hernando puts it, he perfected the game.By the end, you’ll find yourself asking: What does independence (independencia) really mean? Are we truly free, or have we simply learned to believe we are? Maybe it’s like Plato’s “noble lie”, a story told to keep people hopeful, obedient, and proud. Tayong mga Pilipino, ika nga ni Romnick Sarmenta bilang si Osmeña, “hindi naman tayo kulangot, pero bakit tayo binibilog?”Maybe it’s because we love beautiful stories, stories that let us escape, even when they blur the line between truth and illusion. Kailan kaya tayo tunay na lalaya mula sa mga politikong inuuna ang sarili bago ang sambayanan?at ’yun na nga... nabilog na kc tayo. Marahil, just like being a hero, independencia is often just a matter of perception.(i am just wondering how Quezon's descendants would react to this movie)",18/10/2025,positive,0.97798723,0

Quezon,"There were so many layers to this film but it did not feel overdone. I left the movie theatre feeling like i have a lot to unpack.

""Masyadong maraming politiko sa bansa, kaunti lang ang lingkod bayan."" --- almost a century later and we still fall for the same old tricks.Among the 3 Bayaniverse movies, the storytelling format of Quezon is what I enjoyed the most. Since MLQ is more of a political figure rather than a wartime hero, there were more interior scenes rather than landscape wide shots (which I loved from its 2 predecessors -- Heneral Luna & Goyo). Still, it felt like they're in a battlefield where one must fight in order to survive.Kudos to all the creatives behind this, for always using their art to disturb us, the comfortable masses. Madaling makalimot tayong mga Pilipino, at napakadali nating maniwala sa pangako ng pag-asa. As painful as it may be, pero baka nga hindi pa tayo handa sa independencia -- until now most people don't even know what that word means. Or maybe, we were never really truly independent because we never had the chance. I didn't know one could feel hopeful and hopeless at the same time, but right now this is our reality, and the longer we let ourselves be run by the likes of Quezon, the further we are from having true independencia.",18/10/2025,positive,0.967492819,0

Quezon,"being a hero is all about perspective.i greatly enjoyed this film. hence, here are my footnotes:negatives:1. the ""eh yung ____"" ""sa susunod po"" sequencing became overly repetitive.2. wdym third and final installment??? DAGDAGAN. charpositives:1. the first thing i noticed was the characterization of quezon. i applaud the great effort and commitment it took to get the accent, speaking voice, and mannerisms in line. jericho rosales did a fantastic job. i think it's about time to give filipino actors a chance. 2. i appreciate the stance of joven in this movie. his character embodied what it meant to only see one side, to only want to see one side. it highlighted the importance of understanding bias and what it truly means to be a citizen—to weigh both sides and to pick the lesser evil.3. oh emilio aguinaldo you morally grey silly goose. i think the switch of aguinaldo's characterization here greatly emphasizes that things are not black and white. things are not simply good and bad, evil and pure. human as we are, our actions are multiple colors. aguinaldo is an example of that. i want to praise mon confiado for being exemplary. it takes incredible skill to have his character be hated on the first two movies, and be pitied in the next. bravo.4. great cinematography, music, and pacing. i love the use of colors and songs. also great use of creative and artistic freedom.5. what great mirroring. these series of events happened decades ago, yet still apply to our current politics. why do we never learn? why do we allow ourselves to keep being played over and over again? remember: politics is a game to the wealthy, but the lives of the poor. my god, wake up!6. fund the paper. fund the films. fund the art. i so so appreciate the film emphasizing the importance of art and how it can directly influence people's views and opinions about certain topics, nuances, and even people. art is the driving force. art is just as important. and in this modern world where we see art as less, let us be reminded that the beauty of art is the power of human race.history is important. we must continue to learn our past so that we are able to unlearn and re-learn.history is not just the past but the guide to our future.'wag na tayong pauulit-ulit. the present is also the history. today will be yesterday. kaya, now's the time to write the narrative that the future will live. ika nga nila, history repeats itself, diba? mamulat, makibahagi, makiboses!",19/10/2025,positive,0.981741965,0
Quezon,"A decade ago, Jerrold Tarog asked the Filipino audience what it really meant to be a hero. With his Bayaniverse, he aimed to deconstruct the heroes that we've come to know during our history lessons as kids. In Heneral Luna (2015), he showed us the fiery and passionate patriotism that is willing to do anything to protect our freedom. It introduces the idea of mythmaking, as it positions the entire Philippine–American War into the hands of its protagonist, and by killing off the only person who could have led us to victory, the government simply proved that our biggest enemy was not the Americans but our own Filipino countrymen—ourselves.Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2018) breaks this down further, showing us that the hero we glorified all this time was nothing more than a blind fanatic who died a futile death out of his arrogance and lack of experience—all this time, all he had to offer was this confidence and loyalty to his president, and nothing more. Then came 2025's Quezon. As he states in the film:""Ang pagkabayani—it's all about perception"" (Being a hero—it's all about perception).Becoming the hero means you get to decide whose story gets to be told and how it is told.In this third and final installment of Tarog's Bayaniverse, we follow the life of Manuel L. Quezon (Jericho Rosales), who would go on and become the first Filipino elected to head a government of the entire Philippines after 34 years of being governed by American governor generals. All throughout the film, we see him in different stages of his life through different chapters, depicting how he manipulates his way from the bottom to the top, including his conflicted relationships with Sergio Osmeña (Romnick Sarmenta), governor-general Leonard Wood (Iain Glen), and even his former president, Emilio F. Aguinaldo (Mon Confiado).Penned by Tarog and Rody Vera, this concluding chapter of the Bayaniverse trilogy is a fun, engaging, yet biting and farcical take on its titular character's meteoric rise and eventual downfall. Intending to portray the historical figures in the film series often regarded as national heroes as ""flawed characters,"" the film, while showing the achievements they accomplished, also shows their cunning and manipulative tactics to get where they wanted to be.The best comparison I could come up with for Quezon is Orson Welles' 1941 film, Citizen Kane, which also features the rise and fall of its main protagonist (Quezon even opens with a series of silent films, similar to how Citizen Kane introduces its main character through a series of newsreels). It's structured similarly too, told in a nonlinear narrative. Unlike Heneral Luna and Goyo, Quezon is divided into several chapters, with each of these beginning with Quezon headbutting with someone to achieve his goal, highlighting how he played many political games to secure his survival and to maintain his power. Another departure for the film is its setting—while the first two films are set during the Philippine-American War, this latest film explores the period of American political supervision that followed, eventually leading to the founding of the Philippine Commonwealth. It doesn't have the big battle scenes of his first two predecessors and instead focuses on the war they fought within their offices and desks. Unlike its predecessor, whose battles occur in sweeping landscapes and terrains complete with all the explosions and gunfights, Quezon is mostly confined in enclosed spaces and is more dialogue-driven.It's also the most visually imaginative film in the trilogy, as it incorporates a series of silent films to create the myth behind Quezon's heroism. The film creates different tones to emphasize the varying timeline and mood for several sequences: black-and-white color grading for the silent film sequences, a vintage palette look to depict the time of the young Quezon (played by Benjamin Alves), realistic and vibrant three-strip Technicolor for the old Quezon, and a dull and dreary tone for Aguinaldo. This also highlights the difference between the way the public embraced Quezon and Aguinaldo's candidacy—one with color and life, while the other was marred by the death of Andres Bonifacio and Heneral Luna. The film's production design managed to stay true to its milieu too, beautifully captured on camera by Pong Ignacio, who returns from the last two films.Most importantly, the film depicts the evolution of two of the trilogy's most important characters: Joven Hernando and Emilio Aguinaldo. In the film, Joven is played by Arron Villaflor as the young version, while Cris Villanueva is the older one. Unlike in the first two films, where he is depicted as merely an observer for the two titular heroes, here in the third film, he becomes an active participant in the story. However, he is no longer the reliable narrator that he once was, as we realize that he himself has turned a blind eye to Quezon's flaws as an individual and as a politician. On the other hand, the film looks at Aguinaldo with a gentler and softer view, portraying him as this weakened veteran who tries to fight against the giant that Quezon eventually turns out to be in the film, falling victim to his propaganda.And this is where the film's strength lies: with its powerful cast. Mon Confiado delivers a more nuanced turn here as the veteran Emilio Aguinaldo, perfectly complemented by an equally restrained yet compelling performance from Angeli Bayani playing his wife, Maria Agoncillo-Aguinaldo. Arron Villaflor is brilliant as always portraying Joven Hernando, but Cris Villanueva adds another layer of depth to his character. Benjamin Alves also has an interesting part in the film, as he portrays the young Manuel Quezon but also as the actor portraying Quezon within the silent film world, existing on two separate planes and blurring the lines between fiction and reality and between the revised history and actual memory. Of course, Scottish actor Iain Glen deserves a special shoutout for his portrayal of Governor-General Leonard Wood. Karylle also deserves some praise for her understated yet exquisite performance as Aurora Quezon. Romnick Sarmenta also impresses as Sergio Osmeña. But the one who really carries the film from start to finish is none other than Jericho Rosales, with his committed performance as the titular Quezon. Honestly, I was expecting Manuel L. Quezon to have a somewhat full and deep voice, but when I saw the videos of his actual speeches, Rosales nailed his pitch and tone. It's fun to see Rosales as Quezon manipulates his way through politics using one trick after another. He dazzles with his stirring and dedicated turn as the late president, warts and all.Rosales perfectly captures the cunning nature of his character—a two-faced Janus head who uses deception and whispers sweet nothings to charm and manipulate everyone around him like chess pieces. With Quezon, Tarog delivers his ultimate thesis statement: that heroism isn't black or white. We have to understand the grey areas in between. The heroes depicted in his trilogy did a lot of good things that led them to be celebrated as the heroes they are known as now. But like any other human being, they also did some pretty bad things—and Quezon, sadly, did a lot. He inadvertently paved the way for patronage politics, or the spoils system, to take over our government—one that is still prevalent today. His intentions started out as noble—he wants to give the Philippines the independence it has sought after for so many years. But along the way, he realizes that he has to play by the rules, bend some promises, and ultimately lie for what he believes is good for the country. Sadly, the things that he did led him to crave and hold on to his power for as long as he could.Later, Quezon exclaims:""I am the Filipino people. I am the Philippines."" He spent the entire film creating this image of him as the only person who could bring independence to this country—by hook or by crook. But as we see his final image in the film, we all come to the very conclusion that Quezon is nothing but a megalomaniac. He is not the savior he thinks he is. He is but a man.Flawed. Fallible. Mortal.",18/10/2025,positive,0.898118794,0
Quezon,"I always had a keen interest in history. I think this started with my likes to learn about what happened before and knowing all these famous people that the cartoons and shows I watched as a kid that keep on referencing, such as Thomas Jerferson, Benjamin Franklin, etc. This was further cemented by the social studies classes we had that focused on historical events of the world and the like. Philippine history was one and this led me to be more appreciative of what we went through as a nation. Naturally, this pushed me to more interested with movies that portrayed this events, even tho they weren't as accurate to what they wanted to represented *Ahem* El Presidente *Ahem* Fast forward to the release of Heneral Luna and Goyo, I was blown by how the films tried to show these people with a degree of understanding that wasn't as seen in previous historical movies portraying Heroes. Luna and Goyo made me feel angry and surprised, respectively. And now with Quezon, rarely do I get to see Philippine cinema being continued like this. One that continues to show how the past can be a reflection of what we are today, especially when it comes to politics. Its dirty, bloody and downright a game to some. I was sceptical at first with the announcement of Jericho taking the role of Quezon. All those worries faded once he got lost into this performance as the convicing, and coniving, president. Past and new characters were also introduced, adding so much to the story and how they all relate to one another. They portrayed well the friendly banters, conversations, and even betrayals. This connectedness and being one in a shared universe is amazing and works well with this film and the films before, even if each one feels different and stands on their own. The Bayaniverse feels like a proper universe and one that I wish for more Filipino films. This is a culmination of trying to define and portray heroes in ways that don't treat them to be outright heroes. No, these are people who are both perpratrators and victims of their own aspirations, dreams, agendas, laurels and even mistakes. This further pushes us to question those who led us before, and even those who lead us in the present. I'm looking forward for more films like this. And judging from the movie, I have a good feeling that there will be more!",19/10/2025,positive,0.993038952,0

Quezon,"Hindi kasing emotionally charged ng Heneral Luna, o kasing tahimik at mapanuri ng Goyo, ngunit may sariling bigat at diin ang Quezon. Dito, ang digmaan ay wala na sa larangan ng putukan; nasa entablado na ng pulitika. At gaya ng lahat ng magagandang palabas, bawat ngiti, bawat pakikipagkamay, at bawat pangako ay may kasamang pinag-ensayuhang pananalita.Jericho Rosales delivers one of his best performances yet: charming, makinis, pero mapanganib. Bilang Manuel L. Quezon, hindi siya ipininta bilang bayani kundi bilang isang politiko na marunong maglaro ng sistema. Hindi niya winawasak ang istruktura ng katiwalian; siya mismo ang bumuo nito. Ang trapo sa katauhan ni Quezon ay isang masalimuot na larawan ng kapangyarihan. Nakakatawa siya sa kanyang karisma ngunit nakakikilabot sa likod ng ngiti, kung saan namamayani ang tuso at mapanlinlang na pag-iisip.Ang direksyon ni Jerrold Tarog ay mas pulido at teatrikal kumpara sa unang dalawang pelikula. Halata ang diin sa blocking, sa staging ng mga eksena, at sa simbolismo. Parang chess match na bawat galaw ay may kapalit. Ang cinematography ay malinis, kulay-aristokratiko, at puno ng simetrya, na tila ipinapakita kung paanong ginawang perpektong entablado ang politika. Ang musical scoring naman ay naglalaro sa pagitan ng dalamhati at panunukso, na tila tugtugin ng isang entablado kung saan ang kapangyarihan ay ginagawang palabas.Hindi ito kasing-sakit ng Heneral Luna o kasing-lalim ng Goyo, ngunit mararamdaman mo ang maruming realidad ng politika. Naroon ang mga kasinungalingang nakabalot sa magarang retorika, at kung paanong ang kalayaan ay maaaring gamitin bilang produkto ng kampanya. Dito mo makikita kung saan nagsimula ang mga siklong hindi pa rin tapos hanggang ngayon: utang na loob, padrino system, at ang walang katapusang pagbilog sa ulo ng taumbayan.Tarog closes the Bayaniverse not with a scream or a whisper but with a smirk. Isang paalala na ang ating bansa ay itinayo hindi lang sa dugo ng mga bayani kundi sa galing ng mga manlalarong marunong tumaya. Sa dulo, hindi mo alam kung matatawa ka o maiiyak, dahil ang pelikulang ito ay parehong kasaysayan at salamin: mapanlinlang, maganda, at masakit tanggapin.Hindi ito aral tungkol sa kabayanihan; ito ay babala tungkol sa kapangyarihan.Sa pagtatapos ng Quezon, tila tayo ay nanonood ng salamin na bumabalik sa ating paningin. Dito natin nakikita na ang politika ay matagal nang pagtatanghal, at ang mga aktor ay nagpapalit lang ng kasuotan. Ang palabas ay nabago na ng panahon, ngunit ang manuskrito ay ganoon pa rin.",19/10/2025,negative,0.669920444,-1
Quezon,"Small kwento: We saw Mon Confiado before watching the film kasi may surprise talkback session siguro before our showtime. We asked for a photo, then ang sabi niya sa amin: “Please review the film. Bad or good, it’s okay.”I actually didn’t want to watch Quezon yet kasi gusto ko may talkback. I really wish every screening of Quezon had one. Somehow, it’s not enough that we just witnessed what happened on screen. It’s also important to have a discourse about it.I understand that would be difficult and probably impossible to do for every showing. But it's a nice to have. Jerrold and the cast spent months or even years researching these heroes, and it feels lacking if all that effort just ends in a two-hour movie. I’m sure there were stories cut short or ideas that couldn’t be fully explored. It would’ve been so nice to hear more about it directly from them.So we ended up dissecting the film among ourselves after watching. The first thing we all said was how Quezon made it so easy to understand Manuel Luis Quezon. The film is divided into chapters, and in each one, it’s clear who he’s up against and what they are fighting about. And in every chapter, he always comes out winning.Quezon is unafraid to exhaust all his resources and even resort to dirty tricks to gain the upper hand. He can come up with unorthodox ways to defeat his enemies, and sometimes, he even teams up with them to take down bigger and badder ones. Quezon is just good at what he does. But he also thinks so highly of himself as the savior of the Philippines that it eventually becomes his downfall.It’s all very interesting. Like Luna and Goyo, Quezon is deeply flawed. In our minds, he's a great president for bringing independence to the country. But we all agreed that we never really saw Quezon this way before. It’s also amazing how the old problems in the film mirror the issues we still see in Philippine politics today. Maybe even worse.I’d say Quezon is a must-watch. We had a blast watching it, and it’s even better when you get to talk about it afterward with friends or family.",18/10/2025,positive,0.912688136,0

Quezon,"watched in a block screening of my tito who plays nieto!!welcome to philippine politics — where everything is a game, and things can get messy. this is such a rich character study on manuel quezon, backed by a generational performance from jericho rosales. quezon really laid out the foundations of how a filipino leader is made; through the manipulation of power and by being really loud. production-wise this is a huge step up from goyo even if there aren’t any war scenes — the PD and the cinematography really leveled up, like wow. slight complaint but i think the choice to use arron villaflor in most of the flashbacks was poor, because it got kind of confusing when we’d have flashbacks with jericho rosales as the old quezon but have arron villaflor as a young joven — though it did click eventually, it could have been much smoother if they just used cris villanueva and used make-up on him to make him a bit younger. but still, a really well-done film… magsaysay movie next? watched in SM Aura cinema, director’s club",19/10/2025,positive,0.996229947,0

It is ingrained in our culture and it will never be removed.Tarog and Vera's screenplay is also impressive. The Bayaniverse is now completed and I hope this does not ends here.

You are conflicted as you should be. There are no favorites.What we have left to root for is the normal citizen, Joven, that is genuis as the film's creative liberty that represents us as filipinos and honesty which is all we need and Cris Villanueva's role for me, just blends into another great film he's in about deconstructing the strucuture for a flawed hero that is José Rizal in Bayaning 3rd World.

Quezon,"“The Philippine Assembly is yours—body and soul.”#QUEZON felt pretty much of a movie closer to our present day than did Heneral Luna and Goyo. I suppose it could be because of the timeline, but the events in this movie mirrored the present more harrowingly and realistically.I must say that my favorite scene in the film has to be the scene when a hauntingly troubled Aguinaldo was climbing up the stage in what pretty much seemed to be a miting de avance some time before the 1935 elections. When it was Aguinaldo’s turn to speak, he rose from his seat and walked towards the stage as the charming Quezon climbed down parallel to him. The background music intensified. The room did not know of the weight of the moment for Aguinaldo—only he and his Vice Presidential running mate Raymundo Melliza knew of what seemed to be their greatest leverage in the elections and against Quezon for all we know. The living evidence was there, present in that one corner—Quezon’s alleged first wife—a seemingly powerful instrument that could determine Quezon’s reputation. Aguinaldo had a smoking gun. Even I sat in the audience wondering, “Would he drop the ball?” Though Melliza was right in saying that they had no formal proof that the woman and Quezon were indeed married, the positive assertion could spark reasonable doubt on the perceived savior of the Philippines that is Quezon. The visibly horrified, pale-faced Quezon was standing aghast—would Aguinaldo get his own hands dirty as well? Perhaps, Aguinaldo’s option not to pursue the scheme significantly supported the image he had throughout the film: a noble, self-redeeming character in the nation’s struggle for independence who played the bigger man and refused to revenge out of spite.Another interesting point that made me leave the theater with more questions than answers was the re-introduction of Capt. Janolino, the man who made the first blow on Hen. Luna upon alleged orders from Aguinaldo some three decades ago. History tells us that Ka Miong purportedly sent four telegrams to the general, instructing the general to meet with him in Cabanatuan. Janolino sent the first attack, striking the general in the face while the others followed suit. In the film, Janolino was brought to Joven, the fictional figure, in order to clear his own conscience and finally become the man who lived to tell the tale. Janolino told Joven that his conscience no longer could contain the guilt, and that Aguinaldo indeed ordered the Luna massacre while handing Joven one of the four telegrams.History is not just about going back to the past, or connecting it to the present; it, too, is about questioning the narratives that we have long grown up believing, and more importantly, questioning what really was the truest truth about the motives of the people that shaped our history, yes, even forty, sixty, or ninety years apart. There is no question that Janolino was a blessing that came to Quezon’s lap at the right place and in the right time. We know the man. Quezon was too old of a hand in politics, or rather, in the craftsmanship of political manipulation. Quezon had Janolino as his final act of ragebait against Aguinaldo, leading to the latter’s eventual loss in the elections. But the question that left me mentally running in circles was, was Janolino really sincere in coming forward? Or was he yet another opportunist who took the chance to clear his name before anything happens to his life? Worst, was he yet another strategist who switched sides when it was most convenient to feast at the banquet of Quezon’s Senate as his Sergeant-at-Arms? We never know. We could only do so much as cast a doubt on true intentions, no matter how impractical, to really arrive at the truth. Was Janolino’s coming forward an altruistic move, or was it a plot to be thyself’s own saving grace? If you know the reference, good for you.Anyhow, despite the complicated cable spaghetti of neophyte Philippine politics, one can deduce but a single, unfortunate fact that not even Quezon, in a hypothetical redemption moment of his, could deny, and it is this: that corruption is as old as time, and that much of what we see today is utterly of little to no difference with what the country suffered before. It’s all a real déjà vu, only worse. “The Philippine Assembly is yours—body and soul.” If, before, the yours Quezon “sold” the people to are the Americans, now, the ones who sold the Filipino people and the yours these people are sold to are our fellow Filipinos: politicians who connive among themselves to lay bare the people as mere commodities. I am not so sure for everybody else but to me, that sounds like holding up a mirror in the face of Philippine history, except this time, the canon events seem more horrid.May the lessons of history cease to remain as lessons. May we make them cease to remain as lessons. Vote wisely. Think critically. Fight courageously.———PS: Props to Echo! A brilliant artist in the last of Bayaniverse trilogy.

The film is very timely for our political milieu, it shows how politics is like a game of chess — you take as much as you can from your opponent until they have nothing left. Politics aside, this film knows how to tell a story creatively. I enjoyed the “film within a film” aspect without it falling flat or cliché, I found it extremely satisfying. Cinematography ? FUTANGINA ANG GANDA. Every scene feels so cohesive and proper, like a political debate of some sort. I loved the juxtaposition between Quezon and Aguinaldo’s scenes — the loud and blaring music and overbearing lighting for Quezon, and the almost quiet and dull lighting for Aguinaldo. Everything was so tight knit and well executed and truly added more to the story. This film is truly thought-provoking and is definitely a cinematic experience as a Filipino.HM : putangina/punyeta counter when ?",19/10/2025,positive,0.992614627,0

Quezon,"i adore how the film transitions between fiction and reality, much like how history and fact are always muddied in the game of politics. it almost breaks the fourth wall at times—the language of film nearly breaking at the seams by design. i loved how they integrated joven, nadia, and miguel as both audience surrogates and parts of political machinery (excluding miguel bc my man knew what was up)the film tends to overexplain itself at times, especially in the first half when it has to get the audience up to speed on historical events. things are spelled out for you in ways that should already be obvious by just...listening to the dialogue and watching the damn movie. tbh this really was the only aspect i was pretty annoyed at by the film.once it gets past this is when the film feels most electric—you could cut the tension with a knife in the cinema i was in during the candidates' election speeches. jericho rosales absolutely kills it, especially when delivering quezon's mannerisms, way of speech, and subtle tics. mon confiado returns as aguinaldo, showing so many facets to him that you'd almost think to root for him. i wish karylle had more to do as aurora quezon—i could say the same for pretty much the entire female cast atp, who all felt a bit underutilized.as with the other bayaniverse films, these are always worth the price of admission (especially with the student and teacher's discount!). a bit rough around the edges, but sometimes by design which i appreciated. i can only hope people pick up the right lessons when they walk out the cinema.(intentional or not, the fucking congtv cameo jumpscare might be the funniest thing in this movie. the irony is INSANE)",19/10/2025,positive,0.99382484,0
Quezon,"The movie Quezon was really nice because it showed a different side of President Manuel L. Quezon that we don’t usually see in our history lessons. In school, we just learn that he was the first president of the Commonwealth and made Tagalog the national language. But in the film, he was shown as a kind and brave person who truly cared for people. One scene that touched me was when he helped the Jewish refugees during World War II. It showed how he wanted to save lives even if it was hard for him and his government.If I compare Quezon’s time to politics now, I feel like there’s a big difference. Quezon really cared about people, while some politicians today care more about fame and power. The way Quezon stood up for what was right reminded me that leaders should have strong values like honesty, courage, and compassion.The movie made me realize that our country needs leaders like Quezon—people who think about others before themselves. If we all had those values, maybe our society would be a better place.",19/10/2025,positive,0.993086219,0

Quezon,"Quezon definitely still suffers from the over-explaining this type of movies can get. You can still feel Tarog’s hand writing the audience into a corner where the “message” lies. Who can blame him? Even Rizal talked to the people of Calamba directly in El Fili. Maybe it is a feature of the Filipino art form. A feature I don’t like. This made me appreciate the deft rendering of Luna in Heneral Luna.If not for that, I think this would’ve been my favorite entry in the Bayaniverse. You feel all the people involved having fun while doing their jobs. You get used to the out of place existence of the Joven character by now so you just accept the somehow modern Taglish way his daughter talks because the previous entries have utilized him well. I didn’t notice the over 120-minute runtime unlike in Goyo.I will forever bang the drum for more Romnick Sarmenta roles. It was also refreshing to see JC Santos being treated the way Nolan treated Rami Malek in Oppenheimer (which is definitely an influence here). I needed more of the talky genre here though.

Quezon,"The press releases brand Quezon as the third in Jerrold Tarog's ""BAYANIverse"" trilogy, but it's quite clear early into the film that Manuel L. Quezon, the second President of the Philippines, doesn't quite live up to the term ""bayani"" or hero. Yes, he was instrumental in taking the country through its first steps into independence from its colonial masters, but the film also unabashedly shows him as manipulative, petty, and spiteful. Worst of all, particularly in the context of today's incendiary socio-political climate, the film explicitly blames him for laying the foundations for the patronage politics that has plagued the country for decades. It's certainly not stress-free viewing for those among us who are already anxious over our current national situation.If his highly skilled work on the gem Sana Dati and the first two entries in the BAYANIverse films, Heneral Luna and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, did not manage to convince you that Tarrog is one of Pinoy cinema's most masterful directors, this film should. His direction of Quezon is superb. Sequences are creatively and tightly shot, producing a beautiful rhythm that belies the films runtime of over two hours. The [silent] film-within-a-film is a very nice touch, showcasing Tarrog's ability to balance pathos and humor, and also conveniently explaining why young Quezon is played by another actor (Benjamin Alves) in the first two films. Jericho Rosales is pitch-perfect as Quezon. His Quezon is cocky and assured, but also vulnerable and volatile. Cursory surveys of old video and audio clips of Quezon make it clear how well former matinee idol Rosales captures the Commonwealth President's vocal cadence, but the way he moves his body, a lot of which is presumably not visible in most existing videos, gives him ownership of the character. Rosales has proven his acting mettle in previous turns in both film and television, but this is probably the role that he was born to play. Among the supporting actors, the highlight is Mon Confiado as Emilio Aguinaldo, owning the role to the point that it's probably difficult to think of any other actor doing it as successfully. Confiado is often an uneven and divisive actor especially when it comes to loud, overtly physical characters, but here he shows how skilled he is with more quiet, introspective roles. The ever-reliable Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmena, Bodjie Pascua as Raymundo Melliza, and Angeli Bayani as Maria Agoncillo also give laudable turns. Meanwhile, Karylle, who is no slouch in acting, is barely given anything to do as First Lady Aurora Quezon, which is a shame because of Mrs. Quezon's stature in Philippine history.The technical details are admirable, particularly the editing and the production design, which provides a genuine period look and feel to the film. The black-and-white scenes give lenser Pong Ignacio room to play with light, but it's rather unfortunate that the makeup on the actors during those sequences makes them look like the ghouls from Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls. The true standout, however, is the score (by Tarrog himself), which propels the film's pace with alternating whimsy and somberness, and it never feels out of place or overly used (which is very common in local films).Quezon is a true cinematic achievement. For both its quality and its socio-political message, it is must-see Pinoy cinema. Sure, it takes liberties with historical accuracy (the filmmakers are quick to disabuse us of the notion that it's meant to be fully historically accurate), but it asks the right questions, just as Heneral Luna did (remember its iconic ""Bayan o sarili?"" challenge?). Hopefully, the film's message does not fall on deaf ears and will further drive the social movement for true accountability and patriotism in governance.",18/10/2025,positive,0.915699005,0
Quezon,"This should have been the real ""Quezon's game"" since Manuel L. Quezon was the one who mastered politics.

Quezon,"One of the poems I memorized back in elementary school was actually about him, but it never really introduced me to who Manuel L. Quezon truly was or what his role in our history meant. Growing up, I only knew few of his personal and political life from HEKASI and Sibika’t Kultura textbooks, so watching the film was full of surprises, every twist and turn caught my attention and kept me hooked.The reason why I love the Bayaniverse series is because it doesn’t just retell history, it shows the lives of our national heroes and questions what truly makes them a hero… or not. Take him, Quezon, for example. I found myself asking, Was he really a hero? Or could he also be a villain? Maybe Quezon was indeed a hero in governance and nationalism, but also a politician with many flaws. Through this film, we saw his strong will, pride, and even arrogance.Jericho Rosales, who played Quezon, did an amazing job. Honestly, if I had known that TJ Trinidad backed out of the role, I wouldn’t have thought of anyone else who could replace him. When it was announced that Echo would play Quezon, I was doubtful at first, mainly because they don’t look alike. But after watching the trailer and hearing him on Quezon’s accent, I said to myself, “Ayos 'to!” and I was right. His performance made Quezon feel real and relatable, showing not just the hero, but the man behind the title. His accent was consistent from start to finish, and the rest of the cast did great too, especially Romnick Sarmienta as Sergio. And for the first time, Joven Hernando’s role actually made sense to me, even though he doesn’t exist in real life.The music? I loved it. Just wow. It felt like a roller coaster of emotions, especially during the tense moments. Every background score matched perfectly with each shot. And the cinematography? Definitely a step up from Heneral Luna and Goyo. I didn’t expect the “film within a film” concept, but it worked beautifully.Overall, it was a great film, probably a fitting end to the Bayaniverse. Totally worth every peso spent and definitely a must watch Filipino historical film.

Also, when watching someone “perform” or “manipulate”, the audience may subconsciously hold back emotionally. So maybe that’s why I felt less connected to Quezon compared to Heneral Luna and Goyo.

Quezon,"Jerrold Tarog delivers his third and final (maybe?) act of his Bayani-verse, and while it may not be the conventional trilogy that we expect where it gets bigger and more spectacular with each installment, Quezon is more gut-wrenching, diabolical and closely resembles the truth we have today in politics. It successfully and awkwardly shows us a mirror that continuously slaps us Filipinos in the face real hard with questions about fake independence and our failure as a nation, after Heneral Luna (2015) and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2017).Jericho Rosales played the role to the tee, an opportunity of a lifetime, with enough force and conviction. Other cast who stood out were Iain Glenn who played Leonard Wood and Mon Confiado's Emilio Aguinaldo. So entertaining to see Manuel L Quezon, Emilio Aguinaldo, Sergio Osmeña and Manuel Roxas, who I only used to see in paper bills, got brilliantly fleshed out on screen. Jose Rizal wrote Noli and Fili to provoke the nation para magalit, because anger signifies that we've had enough and that we need to take action. National Artists for Film Lino Brocka and Ishmael Bernal also did during Martial Law. Now Tarog, Jadaone, and other current film makers are raising the same flags so it is our duty to ask ourselves as a society. Many times I felt being pinched through the heart, kasi thats how its supposed to feel. Masakit marinig ang totoo, masakit aminin na kapwa Pilipino ang nagpapalubog sa kapwa Pilipino.

Quezon,"hmmMmmMmmAlways had a soft spot for Quezon, if only because of that face. Heroism is all about perception! and he looked the part, was a veritable statesman in his tailored suits. Insidious as the joke about the judge was, I could believe it. But as one should, I reckon with history and necessarily position myself from within contestation — a place the Bayaniverse likewise occupies. What comes out is an interesting, if a little heavy-handed, depiction of hero-making as practice, and the complicity of media in its propagation. Rosales is a good actor, but I do feel the movie could have benefited from someone not quite aware of the performance. It’s part of the project, of course, but Rosales-as-Quezon seemed too aware of the duplicity to be believed. It was only at the end, sick and brought low literally, that one would think he’s bought into the fiction. A shame, since I think it would’ve added depth. Still, I appreciate the obvious staging of it—the choreography, the conceit of the film-within-the-film—and I especially love that it’s Quezon who gets this treatment.

Quezon,"Jerrold Tarog is quite consistent. This film has both the faults and the strengths of its predecessors despite the change in tone and characters here. This trilogy sensationalizes these historical figures and is over-acted by much of its cast (although let's face it, that's a common issue within Philippine cinema), but it is also intentional in creating a narrative about the Bayani that makes a lot of sense when you look at the trilogy as a whole. Like the first two movies, this movie has so many odd creative choices where the intention is in full display but doesn't really serve the overall narrative. Case in point for this film, while the writing is funny at times, it feels so hollow because it's so evidently trying to get a laugh from its audience but fails in its purpose because it detracts from the story rather than enriches it. Many other such choices can be pointed out all across the trilogy. Overall though, I have to give Tarog his flowers. The trilogy has inspired renewed national interest in our history and revisits our national heroes in a way that invites us to re-evaluate where the education we received about them might have been wrong.",19/10/2025,positive,0.954024315,0

Quezon,"Body and Soul.Finally got to witness the end of a saga that I can personally say I grew up on. As someone who loves history the “Bayaniverse” is franchise close to my heart. This time we got to do a character study on Manuel Luis Quezon. A man who is a prominent figure of our history. A political chameleon as to how others describe him. Heneral Luna was the “dagitab” that started it all, Goyo is fine film that dealt with the immediate aftermath of its predecessor and Quezon is this franchise’s final salvo. The pacing of the film is good. I liked how each scenes was able to give tension and stakes. My only nitpick was how the first hour of the film had a slower pace and then as we approach the end it felt rushed but maybe this was made so that it echoes Quezon’s desperate cling to power he built. Each scene felt like a game of chess and it is what kept me entertained. As a history fan I love it when I recognize people or events the people on the film talk about. Jericho Rosales as Manuel Quezon? Superb. How he speaks, his mannerisms, his quips were all spot-on. It was like I was really watching MLQ. Romnick Sarmienta as Sergio Osmeña shower how resolve and silence can both be a good and a bad thing. I wish JC Santos and Karylle had more screentime as I believe their performances were also so good. Mon Confiado as an older version of Emilio Aguinaldo was also a delight to watch. Ibang iba sa mga naunang Aguinaldo and I saw comments na they pity the old man but the way I saw it it, it was his karma that came to bite him.Quezon is a different film from the first two, it is not riddled with guns and canons, there is no physical war. Sabi nga ni Wood “We are fighting behind desks” and this political warfare is entertaining, riveting, and at most times fascinating. Nilatag sa atin kung paanong ang isang taong magaling sa manipulasyon at pamumulitika ay pinapaboran ng panahon. Ipinakita sa palabas kung hanggang saan ang kayang ibigay at kunin ng isang tao para sa kapangyarihan. Pero masayang panoorin ang mga ito dahil ito ay pelikula, nakakalungkot na ilang taon at pangulo na ang lumipas pero nakikita pa rin natin sa mundong ating ginagalawan ang mga pangyayaring ganito.

It features a huge ensemble of actors giving their best impression of the historical figures they are portraying, with Jericho Rosales and Romnicak Sarmenta lightening up the screens everytime they show. Sarmenta, in particular, is a complete scene stealer. Other than the acting and the pacing, Quezon is mostly lackluster in terms of storytelling. The film doesn’t have an interesting visual style, and its look doesn’t fit the ambition and tone it wants to achieve. The script, while commendable on its structure, features some really underwhelming dialogue that feels less punchy than its predecessors.

Quezon,"As the Bayaniverse trilogy comes to a close, Jerrold Tarrog delivers his best one yet. Simula pa nung una, ang ating gobyerno ay itinatag sa maliliit na pabor na lumaki bilang utang na loob. Utang na loob na di na mabayad-bayaran. Totoo bang nakamit na natin ang kalayaan? Ang independencia? O ipinahiram lang ito sa atin at balang araw ay babawiin ito kapalit ng tulong ng ibang bansa?Pinanood namin ng mga kaibigan ko ang Heneral Luna, Angelito, at Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral upang maalala ang mga pangyayari bago kami sumabak sa Quezon. Isa pang nangyari sa akin ay pinanood ko ang Pingkian: Isang Musikal na storya ni Emilio Jacinto haka noong siya ay nagdedeliryo sa tama ng baril noong panahon ng himagsikan. Isa sa unang linya ng musikal ay ang mga katagang,""Doon sa Biyak na Bato, pinatigil ang putukan. Isinuko ni Aguinaldo ang apoy ng himagsikan!"" True to his style, ipinakita ni Direk Jerrold ang tao sa likod ng pagiging bayani. Na kahit isang matalinong heneral si Antonio, siya ay mainitin ang ulo at mapusok. Na kahit si Goyo ang paboritong Heneral ni Aguinaldo, siya ay nababalot ng takot kung ano ba talaga ang kanyang hinaharap, at bilang isang bata, hindi niya rin alam kung sino talaga siya. Sa dalawang pelikula ay makikilala mo rin si Aguinaldo, ang ating unang presidente, na nakadikit sa mga mayayamang miyembro ng kanyang gabinete. Unang tumatakbo pag parating na ang mga amerikano, at dala ang kanyang buong pamilya sa isang mahabang lakarin.May tatlong karakter akong hinihintay na makita; si Aguinaldo na kabado ako kung ano ang kanyang magiging storya. Siya ba ay bibigyan ng redemption arc? Si Quezon na tuso at naging batayan ng political warfare sa atin ngayon, At si Joven na tumanda na. Ginawa upang irepresent ang kabataan, ngunit ano na kaya ang kinahantungan niya ngayon? Masaya akong malaman na lahat ng teorya ko sa palabas na ito ay mali, and it has exceeded ALL my expectations. Panoorin mo nalang kung gusto mong malaman kung bakit. Pero masasabi ko na sinasalamin nga ni Joven ang kabataan, lalo na ang mga kabataang ipinaglaban ang bayan noong bata pa, ngunit noong tumanda ay nahumaling sa mga taong ipinangako ang kalayaang kanyang tinatamasa, kaya nagbulag-bulagan sa mga maling gawain kapalit ng mabuti. The end justifies the means ika nga nila.Napakahusay ng pelikula na ito, sa direksyon, cinematography, sa acting (hindi si Jericho ang makikita mo kundi si Quezon), costume, at production. Halatang tumaas ang budget hahaha. Well versed kami ng kaibigan ko sa kasaysayan, dala ng guro namin noong highschool na napakagaling magturo ng AP st World History. Parehas naming minahal ang kasaysayan dahil sa isang guro na itinuro ang lahat samin nang buong pagmamahal. Pero hindi pa rin itinuturo sa mga kabataan ang lahat. Marami pa ring mga accounts na kung gusto mong makita at marinig upang mapagaralan ay kailangan mong saliksikin ang mga ito. Sana ma-engganyo ang mga kabataan na saliksikin pa ang ating kasaysayan, sa labas ng mga petsa, sa labas ng exams at quizzes. Dahil paulit-ulit lang ang mga nangyayari sa ating bansa.

Quezon embodies both faces: public heroism and private ambition.He did what we think he will, but we didn't how he did it. He is not portrayed here as a hero, but a man playing the game of politics.

Quezon,"Quezon is a historical biopic of the Philippines’ 2nd President - Manuel Luis Quezon. Look what you can do with a big budget! Great cast! Jericho Rosales was a gem in portraying Quezon. Cris Villanueva did so well, with his very natural portrayal of his character, and of course - Mon Confiado as Hen. Emilio Aguinaldo, bravo!Jerrold Tarog’s direction and screenplay came out very strong and powerful in his 3rd “Bayaniverse” installment. Can’t wait for his fourth! This film, just like his previous ones - Heneral Luna and Goyo, mirrors the present through our past, showing how painful that we have not yet learned from the mistakes of the men of our history. This is a film that we should all watch. Every year, we should be able to tell this kind of story.Cast: Jericho Rosales, Benjamin Alves, Mon Confiado, Arron Villaflor, Cris Villanueva, Romnick Sarmenta, Iain Glen, Karylle, Jake MacapagalDirector: Jerrold TarogWriters: Jerrold Tarog, Rody VeraProduction Company: TBA Studios",18/10/2025,positive,0.997026265,0

Quezon,"We are genuinely fucked. It is heartbreaking that we are still in the same hell since the 1930s. As Quezon has said, “I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by the Americans, because however a bad Filipino government might be, we can always change it.”And there we have, the seeds were planted and 90 years after, the seed had grown in a full blown tree and continues to spread in the years that was and will be. Unpopular opinion: We were never ready to be free. We can never be free until we understand the true meaning of freedom and independence. Up until now, we are still seeking for it but in a different context. Freedom from the seeds of politics and politicians whose intentions are for political survival but in the mask of public service. As I watch the film, it dawned in me that good governance will never materialize in my generation. I now know how it feels when we say, “Ang Kabataan ang Pag-Asa ng Bayan.” God bless the Philippines",20/10/2025,negative,0.501858532,0

Quezon,"Coming from the unbridled fury of Heneral Luna and the reflective nature of Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, this installment takes us to the performance of nation-building, set not in battlefields but at podiums and facing cameras. Quezon, as the third larger-than-life figure, enjoys high production value as well, even if the centerpieces are explosive conversations and political machinations rather than fight scenes.Rosales as Quezon is a spectacle, with his high-pitched Tagalog-accented voice that mimics the gravitas of a transatlantic declamatory statesman. It matches, too, with the crux of his character being that of a man who learned from the Americans’ game of politics, and brought it back home. His performance and chemistry with the rest of the cast (namely his hilarious toxic yaoi push-and-pull with Sarmenta’s Osmeña and his dogged face-off with Confiado’s Aguinaldo) make a strong case for this film being the most entertaining of the three.Unfortunately, it may also be the one with the least heart in it. The senseless politicking and pandering to the promise of independence at any cost includes a pessimistic, self-referential plot point for the journalist character and his filmmaker daughter. The two fall prey to making propaganda for Quezon but ultimately can't make any definitive, concrete stand. It succeeds at holding up a mirror to the audience members watching, who decry corruption and bad governance, but cannot suggest or invoke any alternative. Quezon is a strong biopic and historical drama that satirizes politics through sensational slapstick moments starring some of the Philippines’ most known figures from the American period. For a dialogue-heavy film, it’s thrilling to follow thanks to its playful structure, making it stand out from its two predecessors which were mainly linear and battle-focused.What it didn’t really account for was the impact of Quezon’s actions. It only focused on the political spectacle that worsens the state of the nation and makes the dream of independence unreachable, even laughable. There’s a small scene where a farmer reveals that most people don’t understand what independence means. The film doesn’t explore beyond that — how the Filipino politicians and the American occupiers take advantage of this ignorance, what the average Filipino’s life is like, and why independence is such a pipe dream. Perhaps there we could have found the film’s heart.Full review here.",16/10/2025,positive,0.968674421,0

Quezon,"“utang na loob”a filipino value that still lingers the filipino society to this day, may it be in its smallest form or one that murks around the walls within our government: patronage politics. in the movie, it highlights how Manuel Quezon essentially gave birth to patronage politics in our nation’s government with how he deliberately moves around the walls of politics to set himself as the one with the most decorated achievements among his peers and foes. politics is a game for him. and in the end, he will use all his power to remain at the podium. all this to feed his ego. i believe that the release of this movie is relevant to the current issues Philippines is battling with today. just like Manuel Quezon, many politicians use “utang na loob” to their advantage, for their self-interest, which cost the lives of many ordinary Filipino people who are struggling everyday to make a living. moreso, this movie serves as a wake-up call to Filipinos that we must no longer be tolerant of how damaging patronage politics is to our society, especially on the topic of nepotism. i hope that one day, the concept of “utang na loob” will be redefined by generations to come. i hope that we open our eyes to see how this Filipino value has taken the route of submission to the one who has given you generosity. i hope that us, Filipinos, will one day, fully understand how “utang na loob” has impacted us in the grand scheme of things.",20/10/2025,positive,0.927370012,0

Quezon,"As the Bayaniverse concludes with the film Quezon, we are left to ponder: Who are truly considered heroes? Does Heneral Luna—who, despite his temperamental and tactless nature, led his men to fight for the country at the cost of their own lives—fit the mold of a hero? How about the composed and charismatic Heneral del Pilar, known for his loyalty to President Emilio Aguinaldo? Or is it Manuel Luis Quezon, the first President of the Philippine Commonwealth, who relentlessly championed the nation’s independence?Unlike the tension-driven Heneral Luna or the meditative Goyo, Quezon leans toward diplomacy and vision—the making of a statesman rather than a soldier. Mon Confiado, reprising his role as El Presidente Aguinaldo, provides a strong emotional bridge across the trilogy. His nuanced performance ties the films together with quiet power—a fitting irony, given how Aguinaldo outlived these three who once served under him. Jericho Rosales, meanwhile, delivers a commanding portrayal of Quezon—a politician who knows how to play the game of politics, both as one of the chess pieces and as the one who moves them. This may well be the most compelling performance of Rosales’ career. Rosales and Romnick Sarmenta, who plays Sergio Osmeña, show an undeniable chemistry that is utterly entertaining. This dynamic between Quezon and Osmeña is refreshing to see, and is something that I just discovered from the film.While the cast performed well and Tarog's vaudeville-inspired storytelling was interesting, there was no singular standout in the film. The attempt to encapsulate Quezon's life after reading through 50 reference books made the narrative feel dense and uneven. The intent to inform and educate was there, but it came at the expense of smooth transitions and richer character development. A minor subtitle error (""kada buwan"" translated as ""per year"") is forgivable, but the lack of emotional buildup for the audience was a missed opportunity.Many historical moments were highlighted, yet the film fell short in conveying their emotional and moral implications. Still, the complicated feelings I had after watching it are proof that the filmmakers succeeded in presenting a layered, complex figure in Quezon.In the end, the Bayaniverse is more than a trilogy of historical films—it is a mirror reflecting who we were, who we are, and who we hope to become as Filipinos. Through Luna's fury, Goyo's doubt, and Quezon's ambition, we are reminded that heroism is not born from perfection or victory, but from conviction and purpose. Perhaps instead of searching for a hero to emulate or a leader to inspire today's generation, it may be far better to embrace a collective effort—despite our differences—to build the change we have long yearned for across generations. Tarog's decade-long storytelling, with all its flaws and brilliance, draws us back to the past that shaped us and rekindles our desire to strive for a nation better than the one we inherited.",18/10/2025,positive,0.976441503,0

Quezon,"The last entry in the Bayaniverse trilogy which aims to deconstruct historical figures. Kudos to the production design and the cast which was of high quality ever since Heneral Luna 10 years ago.Jericho Rosales did very well in acting especially on his accent. The film showed Quezon as this political figure who was great in playing the politics game. I liked how Aguinaldo mentioned the difference between being a public servant and being a politician. It was interesting to see the dynamics of Casey and Serging (Quezon and Osmena) and I found their conversations amusing. In my interpretation, the coin that Quezon gave to Joven is a form of utang na loob which is kind of rooted in our politics relating to the padrino system.I wish that the patronage politics was explored a bit more though.Personally, I would have liked this film even more if it had more runtime because a part of me felt they condensed all that they could into the movie runtime. I hope TBA studios gets to have miniseries for more comprehensive storytelling. All in all, congrats to the Quezon team and TBA studios for pulling off a wonderful Bayaniverse trilogy which I hope would just be the start of many more films to come.",19/10/2025,positive,0.99525106,0

I HATED THE TRAILER, I DIDNT LIKE THE FACT THAT IT WAS GONNA CENTER AROUND POLITICS AND NOT BRAVERY, HEROISM, AND JUSTICE FOR THE FILIPINOS!! But oh my days I was so wrong, I love it sm (not Manuel Quezon obvi).This truly acknowledged the lack of information given to me about the presidents of the Philippines. Politics truly is a silver lining, there is no good or bad, ""it's just politics."" This movie truly made the loudest statement of how corruption GREW in the Philippines but I have yet to research and make an informed opinion, but this— this was truly something. It isn't like the rest of the ""Bayani"" films I've watched— no war, no bloodshed, just politics. Also shows how us voters HAVE to dig deeper on the track record of our candidates and CREATE informed decisions if whether or not their mistakes should be forgiven. It truly takes critical thinking to assess our presidential candidates if they truly wish the best for the people or they only wish the best for themselves.I keep repeating about critical thinking, informed decisions, research, but I cannot stress this enough. PEOPLE NEED TO LEARN TO READ MORE! Anyways the movie was great, the overall aesthetic of the film was amazing. Jericho truly EMBODIEEEED Manuel Quezon and cutie patootie Sergio Osmeña, huhu kaluoy.

Quezon,"The last of the Bayaniverse trilogy unfolds almost in tension with the first. While Heneral Luna (2015) almost glorifies nationalism and patriotism as the purest routes to independence, Quezon exposes a more unsettling truth: that nation-building, too, can be an enterprise of deception, politicking, and personal ambition.What struck me just as deeply was the film’s portrayal of the media. In the same way we inherited American politics and governance, we also inherited their media system. In the film, the two are almost indistinguishable. For Quezon, media is political machinery; politics, in turn, is media spectacle.To its credit, Quezon is an unforgiving dissection of a cunning man long revered in Philippine history as the architect of constitutional democracy. The film spares no illusions: it renders him not as a flawless hero, but as an American lackey who wielded independence as a political instrument for self-fulfillment. In the buildup to his presidential campaign, he is almost canonized as a saint, a portrayal that feels eerily symmetrical to the myth-making that defines our politics of today.I also think about Joven, how in Luna he was the youth whose fire needed to be fanned. Now, in Quezon, he was the people, blamed for falling victim to — and almost being complicit for having benefitted from — the very system of patronage. But the film offers more than this bobotante framing, as we observe Joven quite literally see through blind faith. Although the film had the tendency to slip into a romanticized treatment of Aguinaldo, it compels reflection on our country’s institutional memory. Why do we not know this Quezon: the ambitious, calculating politician beneath the marble statue? Why have patronage and our reverence for the West endured as the constants that anchor our political imagination? And why, almost a century later, do we find ourselves in the same predicament, still circling the same myths of power and nationhood?",17/10/2025,positive,0.884284377,0

Quezon,"“I am the Philippines”The clashing philosophy is the undercurrent that carries this movie. It isn't explicitly delivered; it's not visible on the surface, but it is deeply embedded for those who look closely enough. We witness the vivid interpretation of the rise and fall of a truly great figure, supported by compelling storytelling. The cinematography is strong, the acting is excellent, and the production design is surely top-notch.However, I can recognize that the movie's portrayal was somewhat tempered. We move from a brutal Luna and the edginess of Goyo to a Quezon who feels more approachable, child friendly, fun, and bright. Perhaps this interpretation reflects an intentional focus on Quezon’s charisma, or maybe it’s simply how the filmmakers intended for us to view his specific burden.I deeply admire the film's message—the political philosophy—and how acutely it mirrors our current government. It forces us to confront the question of how we arrived at this point. The answer, the film suggests, is woven into our history; the seeds were planted long before we were born. This system is so profoundly rooted that it cannot be simply plucked out. This, right here, is absolute storytelling. The core concept isn't forcefully presented to the audience; instead, the film allows us to arrive at the message through our own contemplation.There is much more to discuss, but the direction and storytelling are what I loved most. I can confidently say that those who see this as the least installment in the trilogy are missing the point. Each movie is a unique and great piece on its own. But Quezon—it delivers a sense of euphoria, emerging as a brilliant work of art that demands appreciation.",20/10/2025,positive,0.991737664,0

I think it’s just a fun film.Tarog and Vera’s criticism of the Philippine government and its people through this movie is something they’ve shouted at the viewers in the two previous films, but it’s more poignant this time. Through Rosales’ Quezon, they acknowledge at how tired they are with the same observation of indecent play that happens within politics—but of course they’re not gonna go down without putting up a good fight. I genuinely wish they made Rosales look much more older than he is, so that he looks like the real Quezon.

Quezon,"Ang lahat ng ito ay politika lamang, walang personalan.Just watched Quezon, and it awakened that history buff inside of me. Like Heneral Luna and Goyo, this was well done. It does complete the trilogy of what truly defines a political figure in the Philippine context. Its narrative and screenplay are peak, I adore the score, editing and art direction, and the production design was so good. Very interesting to see the early days of pork barrel, patronage politics, media ""envelopes"", and dirty tricks. Power play and mind game at its finest.Quezon, in its very core, is a film that presents itself as satirical, perhaps offering a timely commentary on the Philippines’ current political landscape and the ongoing struggle with personality politics. Themes including power and ambition just resonate with contemporary issues in the Philippines, sparking important conversations about governance and nation-building. I do commend Quezon’s portrayal here, as if he were a challenged hero who is worshipped. Jericho Rosales’ portrayal of Quezon was commanding; he brought depth and nuance to the role, capturing the former president’s complexities and leadership style. His performance conveyed the character’s passion, conviction, charisma, and flaws, making Quezon relatable and human. In addition, Mon Confiado was quietly powerful as Aguinaldo. While the film doesn't glorify Quezon, it reveals the cracks and how ambition can stain even the purest intentions until history decides whether you're an ideal or a sinner. There is more to be discussed in the historical events depicted. Politics is a game of thrones, mula noon hanggang ngayon.Quirky, silly and indeed a good game. It is a must-watch.

Quezon,"Waited for this movie for maybe 8 years and I was not left disappointed. This is the historical drama I was waiting for and the depiction I never knew I wanted. This trilogy has proven and show that our heroes weren't perfect people. They've done bad things, got their hands dirty, and burned bridges but they were also instrumental in building our nation. Sometimes, these heroes are also reflective of our nation and who we can be. The Philippines has its share of problems but it's still a beautiful country and has the potential to be something great. We might be just as imperfect as the heroes in Jerrold Tarog's trilogy were but just like them, we still have the capability to bring the country somewhere great. I hope that one day, we bring this country away from where it is right now and beat the corruption that plagues it.Besides that important lesson and theme I got from the movie, I think the movie is an amazing piece of Philippine cinema from its acting to the cinematography to the editing. It's truly amazing. There were a few creative choices that I feel like could've been edited or shot better but I still think this movie is a masterpiece just like the other two in the trilogy.",19/10/2025,positive,0.994792521,0

The film invites reflection rather than worship.Heneral Luna started the fire. Goyo showed the cost. Quezon’s the anti hero master stroke that perfectly wraps up the Bayaniverse trilogy. One small gripe: Iain Glen does his best as Leonard Wood, but the accent keeps playing hide & seek w/ the dialogue. He’s commanding, sure, but his Scottish accent slips through just enough to break the illusion.

Quezon,"I have nitpicks with this that I don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing:1. The execution of this was disorienting at first. Because all of a sudden it was theatrical, vaudeville, and full-on period. But when the plot thickens, it suddenly makes sense — On how the politics at the time (let’s face it, until today), is just one big show and performance at stake of actual lives.2. The timejumps was a bit confusing at first. When it jumped from film to life and back out again with no immediately understandable visual cues, it was snapping me out of the world. But again, when the plot thickens, you kinda get the point. This may be my personal issue, but it took me sometime to get to that point.And my most major thing with this:I BOTH LOVE AND HATE, I AM BOTH AMAZED AND DISAPPOINTED, ALL AT THE SAME TIME - On how this reflects to until today. This was basically the birth of a trapo. It says so in the film that this was the game of politics, showcased at large on how it was played, and how it evolved into the game of today. What I hate most is that the main messaging of political idolatry is still a rampant and relevant message that still needs to be relayed to today. And mind you, this was more or less than 80 years ago. How far we’ve gotten yet how slow our progress be.Also, I watched this one alone. And I kinda regret that, which is a RARE reaction I get from watching a film (because I love watching films alone). But this is a discussion me and my friends had before that we may dive deeper into after this film: “Was the Philippines premature to be independent before? Should we have taken more time to be colonized?”. No ill-intent in that question, it is purely a curious question. And one that was once again, sparked by this film.A thinktank, a conversation-igniter, which is how historical films should be.

Ang pinaka obvious ay ang Chess, kung saan ang naglalaban ay ang panig ni Quezon para sa puti, at si Osmeña naman ang sa itim. Isa sa mga paborito kong scene yung nasa isang malaking kwarto sila at tila naglalaro ng Chess para masukat kung sino ba ang mas ma-impluwensiya sa kanila. Sa huli, na checkmate si Osmeña. Talo siya.Pangalawa naman ay ang tila paglalaro nila ng Snakes and Ladders. Maraming scene ang nagaakyat-baba ang mga karakter sa hagdan, madalas ay kapag nabibigo silang makuha ang nais nila, galit silang bumababa, parang natuklaw ng ahas— tingin nila, ipinagkanulo sila ng panahon o ng mga kasamahan. Lahat gustong umakyat ng hagdan, lahat gustong manalo.Huli ang poker. Kanya-kanyang laro ng kani-kanilang mga baraha. Kung sino ang may mas maaalam na baho ng kalaban, siya ang panalo.

I love the fact that Quezon isn't shown as a protagonist that you wanted to cheer for all through out. It captures the very idea of politics itself, its not black or white, it is a game in which in order to get what you want, you have to do some underhanded tactics. Quezon himself knew how to play the game. Lets talk about, Aguinaldo next, in this film he is tired and beaten down, he was out of his depth in challenging Quezon. Aguinaldo was characterized in which a part of you will feel sympathy for him, but makes you aware that everything that led to his downfall was through his actions.

Quezon,"On the critique that Quezon (the film) is vague in its idea of independence:That's exactly part of MLQ's politics: the wielding of power is being the origin or source of a great idea, the new republic as a goal only Cassey can achieve. That is how political campaigns are inspired. That's how devotion to political figures has taken its root. Whatever concept of freedom there is should appear like it's going to come directly from the politician. Independence being perceived as food conveys the idea that it's constantly asked, not fought for, by the masses that wait for 'ayuda' rather than the affirmation of their capacity to hold freedom in their hands. And why is 'independence' or 'new republic' mentioned in the film like a byword? It's because Quezon wears it like a badge. But it serves a more important purpose: It floats as a concept that's never really understood. It remains to be a hollow idea associated with patriotism. So it continues to be talked about because it's never truly experienced. Valid pa rin ang tanong na ""What is a new republic?"" hanggang ngayon. So it's odd to expect the film to define independence for us when what it does is actually more essential.We define it. I trust that we know how to.",21/10/2025,positive,0.630943418,0
Quezon,"Sabi ni Cinemaster Nadz Amata:Simply an amazing film to end Tarog’s Bayani Trilogy. Quezon harnessed the strengths of its predecessors Heneral Luna and Goyo, producing a film with strong storytelling, great actors, and awesome cinematography. Although he did not physically look like the mestizo Casey, Jericho Rosales delivered an enigmatic performance well-deserving of acting awards. But among its merits, perhaps my favorite thing about Quezon is its pointed delivery of political critique not only towards the current administration but to the long history of corrupted, patronizing, and self-serving Philippine politics.I know for sure that it is not only me who feared that Quezon would end up sanitizing the former president’s image, as films about politicians and heroes tended to do so. But alas, Quezon was not usual biopic that mythologized the man — instead, it demystified him, reintroducing the former President that plastered his and his wife’s name all over his home province and the biggest city in Metro Manila. It was able to effectively deliver Manuel Luis Quezon as the cunning politician, borderline dictator that he is.Alongside his intelligent spiels and populist rhetoric, the film revealed the unapologetic and manipulative character of the 2nd President of the Philippine Republic — the man who laid the formula of political maneuvering for the politicians and would-be presidents after him, proving Alfred McCoy’s view that Quezon’s Commonwealth paved the way for Philippine authoritarianism.I do hope that Tarog continues to develop new historical fiction films in the future. More than ever, we need more films that tackle and communicate our history in interesting ways that provoke the audience to revisit our past and reexamine our stances on our ‘great’ men.",21/10/2025,positive,0.991629243,0

Quezon,"news flash, quezon was the BLUEPRINT on how to be a TRAPO. fueled by remorseless charisma, endless antics, and 'utang na loob' schemes that never seemed to run out. traditional politics in the country has been forcely ingrained within our culture where filipinos greatly suffered from the power-hungry politicians, presenting it as a fight for independence. what i didn't like about the film is how they didn't emphasize the role americans played, and somewhat leaned towards blaming our own demise to the filipinos itself. but i believe, to put it quite plainly, we have never been truly free from the colonialism. however, as my sister would say, ""take it with a grain of salt"", because even if it is grounded by history, it is still a work of fiction at malaking bahagi pa rin ang artistic values ng direktor at lahat ng naging parte sa pag buo nito.",21/10/2025,positive,0.81226182,0

Quezon,"What a way to close out the Bayaniverse trilogy. From the ultraviolent chaos of Heneral Luna, to the somber introspection of Goyo, Quezon rounds things off as a psychological thriller-slash-political comedy-slash-drama that’s as ambitious as it is sharp.What I’ve always admired about Jerrold Tarog’s depiction of these historical figures is how human they are. There are no pure heroes here—only flawed men navigating ambition, ego, and nationhood. Quezon, played brilliantly by Jericho Rosales, is a political gamemaster: part statesman, part showman, and wholly cunning. I love that the film doesn’t dwell on textbook achievements, but rather on the intricate dance of manipulation, charm, and power that defined his leadership.Like the best Filipino historical films of recent memory, Quezon reflects its own era back at us—the politics of then echoing the politics of now, for better or worse.And while it’s billed as the end of the Bayaniverse, I hope this isn’t an exclamation point, but a comma—especially after that tantalizing post-credits tease.",21/10/2025,positive,0.987248838,0
Quezon,"Here we begin with a shapeshifting exploiter on one hand and a docile, equally ambitious prowler on the other, juggled and brandished to trade barbs and heave vitriol at each other, both would later dismiss as mere politics to justify a much-needed partnership, then finding a common enemy in a chagrined former revolutionary leader and president. The ping-pong exchange of politicking and smear campaigns is its most coruscating part—electrifying to me, actually—a protracted look at our current politics' saddening origin. Quezon—now that there is no need for battle pieces, as that is not Tarog's turf—is the most polished in the entire trilogy, only slightly tarnished by its caricature bits and overreliance on fictional characters. The decision to minimize young Joven's speaking lines saves the entire cast's immaculate efforts from futility.",21/10/2025,positive,0.91593796,0

Quezon,"It was so fascinating to see the things I've learned in history books be dramatized in film.What a time to be alive to witness a trilogy of films that tells a story of heroes, but also deconstruct them, showcase them as three-dimensional characters, as people and not as good guys up on pedestals.The change of tone from the seriousness and war setting of Heneral Luna and Goyo to the more modern setting of Quezon threw me off, but also had me engaged. Especially with the way they make a meta-commentary of the power of film and media to portray these stories. Jericho Rosales is wonderful to see on screen as MLQ, and Romnick Sarmienta as Sergio Osmeña showed a fun dynamic--almost like a romantic couple--between Quezon and Osmeña.The non-linear storytelling was also a change that I had to adjust after re-watching the first two in preparation for this. Thankfully, there are title cards and chapters that serve as good guide posts for the pacing of the story.Speaking of story, as this film spanned a longer timeframe compared to the two, it's written to showcase more vignette-type and montage-style of events rather than the more straightforward storytelling in Luna and Goyo. While it's not a bad thing, it can be difficult to keep track of while watching. Also, pacing is an issue as some parts dragged and other moments could've used more time to absorb its messaging.The showcase of Quezon's con artistry and showcasing him as a chameleon is done very well. This movie was really a battle of wits instead of arms--and it truly showcased the Filipino political culture.The production and set design were done incredibly well. A lot of effort was put to make this a period piece. While some seams and cracks can be seen here-and-there, those can be mostly ignored and do not hinder my enjoyment of the film. There isn't that much bloodshed and prosthetic wounds to be seen here, but more on CG buildings, vehicles, and recreation of period appropriate settings and props.---SPOILER THOUGHTS---I think they could've had a Mabini scene somewhere as having Aguinaldo, Joven, Rusca, and Janolino weren't enough connective tissue for me to fully connect this movie with the previous two.The Alerta storyline and Nadia filmmaking storyline could've been tighter as these were the parts that dragged the most. Though I do appreciate having this fictional plot point to give commentary on the importance of film, media, journalism, and media literacy--I do think this could be polished more and make less preachy. In the previous films, I didn't feel like I was being banged with the head with all of its messaging because of how beautiful the writing is and how its themes weave together with its characters. In here, that magic was kinda muddled a bit. But there were still some scenes and lines that made such a good impact on me.His abrupt death and shouting into the abyss, left me dissatisfied to be honest. Both Luna and Goyo's death were shown on-screen while here, it's just implied and presented to us through text. I would've loved to see him actually die in his sleep or something or maybe have Osmeña receive the news and take his place and then have the epilogue of the movie there.Lastly, all three films had some sort of subplot of the protagonist having some sort of affair. I think Aurora Quezon was underutilized here. Luna's affair with Isabel makes sense as the character was an amalgamation of various women in Luna's life. Goyo's love affairs with Felicidad and Dolores were the most poetic and beautifully done juxtaposed with the sacrifices of war. Quezon's love for Aurora and the affair with Ana Ricardo was so tense but not as strong as I would like it to be as both women were more plot device than actual characters.---END OF SPOILER THOUGHTS---Quezon is a great film and I am thankful to have watched it on the big screen. I think it is the weakest of the trilogy, but it still has its redeeming qualities. It can be frustrating in a negative sense with some of the complaints I have, but this film and the entire Bayani-verse trilogy of movies are frustrating in the positive sense--as ALL three were well-written to present themes, lessons, and events that are still relevant to this day. These films show history but as so well-crafted to mirror the political issues we have at present.I don't want this to be the last film. I do hope there are more stories to tell and themes to explore in our history.",21/10/2025,positive,0.987690806,0

Jericho Rosales doesn't really look like Quezon, I was really hesitant at his casting first especially as the original Quezon TJ Trinidad (and even the younger Quezon Benjamin Alves as well as Apolinario Mabini actor from previous Bayaniverse films Epy Quizon) looks more similar to the real Quezon, but Jericho did really make up for his acting. I love how the political tactics and intrigue are made with comedic timing, keeping audiences interested in the screen. I thought Mon Confiado was really perfect as Quezon and Iain Glen's special appearance as Governor General Leonard Wood was fantastic. I thought Karylle's Aurora Quezon doesn't have much to do in the movie, but I was really impressed with her acting especially when she realized Quezon's first ""wife"" was in the same event as her and Quezon.The movie seems to be based strongly on facts, but I couldn't find from my research information about this so called first ""wife"" of Quezon before Aurora. But I do think she was used very well in the plot of this movie. The fictional characters Joven Hernando and his daughter Nadia are well used in this movie as well. They are intended to represent the audiences (especially Filipino audiences as their Filipino history shown in this movie is still relevant today). Overall a great third movie in Jerrold Tarrog's Bayaniverse movie films (along with 2015's Heneral Luna and 2018's Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral).",17/10/2025,positive,0.99770385,0

Quezon,"the writing, visual production, and sound design were so, so sharp; it was impossible to be bored, even for a film that centered around talking politicians. ang galing! maybe not my favorite out of the three in the bayaniverse, but i do believe it to be the most relevant as its closest to our present reality today. it very effectively punctures our lack of regard for some of the earliest developments of our current republic. it then became a great illustration of how the governance and systems we face today doesn’t fall far from the tree (unfortunately). in that sense, the film is a lot less emotionally moving compared to its counterparts in the trilogy. instead, it was moreso unsettling: and maybe that’s the point!! history is not merely the study of the past, but it is also how the present came to be and continues to evolve as we speak. moreover, heroes are but names we give to very much real people with a human capacity for malice and fault. much credit to jerrold tarog for the bayaniverse trilogy. had it not been for general luna, i’d not have gone on history deep dives in my free time (because unfortunately the last time we had proper philippine history as a class was in grade 6). we’re often apprehensive to approach history as the mere thought of the many big names and events intimidate us — especially when we think that history is just dead people and shit that went down years ago. but what if we just don’t realize that history is actually, very much as well, the now? quezon (2025) is a great ender to the trilogy because it cements such idea. it’s chilling to think about how time has passed and how much has stayed the same. thinking about it all has made me unsettled (which, again, i think is the point).",21/10/2025,positive,0.991241038,0

Quezon,"marami ang politiko, ngunit kakaunti lamang ang lingkod bayan.there are numerous reasons in which individuals desire to enter politics, but not everyone is really a public servant. you have to possess tremendous power to influence in order to become such a powerful individual. my opinion is that many who become so influential are not exercising this power for good governance, rather for personal interests. this thinking can bring about patronage politics, corruption, and insensitivity to the needs of the people(which is actually happening rn).It's sad to see people put personal interest ahead of the common good.this film sheds some light on this aspect by depicting the shrewd personality of Manuel Quezon, our first president commonwealth president(that’s why andaming palang proposed constitution, and yung transition about tydings-mcduffie act hindi tinuro sa’min kung what was the real story behind those numerous revisions and amendments). It depicts how his calculated and shrewd politics influenced the country's history, but at the same time points out the ambiguity between heroism and manipulation. the film instigates us to challenge our understanding of historical icons and what it actually means to be a hero. It gives us inspiration to think critically on leadership and governance, and to aim for a system where power is utilized for the common good, not for a chosen few. while reflecting on Quezon's legacy, we are reminded that genuine public servants are those who put the greater good first, not personal interests.",21/10/2025,positive,0.604560494,0

Quezon,"Quezon, in terms of storytelling, is different from the approach of Heneral Luna and Goyo. Not that the previous films were set during the war for independence and Quezon was more about words, but Tarog’s treatment here was somewhat different.What I appreciate about this new approach is its new perspective. In this film, we see Quezon through the lens of Nadia’s works, portrayed as both a hero and a shrewd politician — a duality reflected by the people around him like Joven, who seem like spectators to his life. The storytelling feels more playful yet sharp, much like the mind games shown in the film, which perfectly capture his wit and sly character. I also liked the use of the title card inspired by the silent era in the sequence that introduces Quezon — a clever way to bridge the past and the present.The scenes of love-hate tension between him and Osmeña, his attempts to outsmart Leonard Wood, and his feud with Aguinaldo make us, as viewers, feel like spectators in this grand game of politics. Despite the seriousness of the subject, the humor and comedic tone remain, giving the film a lighter touch — something I truly appreciate. It also highlights the absurdity of politics, showing how politicians can sometimes be clowns themselves. Quezon is definitely a film worth watching in cinemas. I also appreciate its cinematography and sound design, which add so much to the overall narrative.",20/10/2025,positive,0.989677012,0
Quezon,"Quezon is less about defining a hero and more about what a hero isn't. With no guns and battles this time, Tarog's final film in the trilogy relied on a well-written screenplay and a brilliant direction and editing. This felt polished and grand.Jericho Rosales plays Quezon masterfully with his unmatched charisma and mischievous persona. Every department of this production brought their A-game (except the makeup which was at times distracting). The writing here is particularly good, in my opinion the best of the trilogy.Quite an experience going home from the cinema in a motorcycle, seeing his name in every corner of every street in this city named after him. His legacy indeed lived on. Scary to think that the unprincipled legacy of the people running this country today might live on too just like his.",21/10/2025,positive,0.997325301,0

Quezon,"Quezon is not your typical biopic. It doesn’t simply glorify the titular figure, nor does it aim to reduce him to a villain. It’s a sharp, unsettling mirror. The cinematography is well-executed, every shot deliberate and meaningful. I loved how the film plays with style: the silent movie and noir sequences are such clever touches. There’s a bit of camp, even excess, but it works. Politics has always been a performance in the Philippines anyway, and this film leans right into that.It’s not afraid to show Quezon as both idealist and egotist, leader and manipulator. The movie calls out how he perfected the art of political spectacle, something we’re still drowning in today. At times, it gets too caught up in that same spectacle, focusing on power plays more than the people affected by them, but maybe that’s part of the point.What stings most is how familiar it all feels. The greed, the posturing, the foreign meddling: it’s the same game, just with new players. Quezon isn’t perfect, but it’s sharp, stylish, and painfully relevant. It doesn’t just revisit history; it forces us to realize we’ve never really left it.(P.S. Give Jericho Rosales his well-deserved FAMAS now!! that perforamance was spectacular!!)",22/10/2025,positive,0.984533429,0

Quezon,"Nakakatuwang isipin na kahit medyo natagalan bago nasundan at dumaan sa maraming hamon, ngayon ay mapapanood na rin natin ang “final installment” ng Bayaniverse. This time, nakatutok ang pelikula kay Manuel L. Quezon, upang ipakita sa mga Pilipino kung ano nga ba ang tunay na kahulugan ng pagiging bayani. So, was it worth the wait?One thing’s very clear: this movie is made with passion and love. Every aspect, production design, costume, music, sound design, acting, and screenplay, everything feels precise and deliberate. Walang sayang. Busog ang mata mo, at napakasarap sa pandinig ng bawat linya at tugtugin.I also appreciate that the film didn’t contradict anything from the previous installments. There’s no unnecessary retcon, and even smaller roles were reprised by the same actors (except for Joross Gamboa as Eduardo Rusca, previously played by Archie Alemania). Hindi ko nga agad napansin na siya pala iyon until I checked online, still, I appreciate his inclusion.What leaves me conflicted, however, is how the narrative perspective centers on Joven. He’s a good character, pero minsan nawawala ang connection natin kay Quezon. Unlike the first two films where we clearly see the world through the minds of Luna and Goyo, dito parang ikinukuwento lang sa atin ang nararamdaman ni Quezon. That sometimes creates a bit of emotional distance. I get that the film wants to show that our heroes are just as flawed and human as we are, and I love that message, but I wish we could’ve seen more of Quezon’s inner struggle.The non-linear structure works surprisingly well. Kahit medyo gimmicky, it adds flavor to the storytelling, especially since we already know where the story is headed.Jericho Rosales delivers a powerful and charismatic performance as Quezon. Mon Confiado also brings his A-game, while Cris Villanueva, Arron Villaflor, and Rominick Sarmenta shine in their respective roles. For Iain Glen, I honestly feel another actor could’ve played the part, but it’s still commendable that they brought in a respected Hollywood actor for the role.Overall, Quezon is a strong and passionate film. It may be overly ambitious at times, occasionally losing sight of its identity, but its heart is in the right place. The message remains powerful: kahit ilang taon na ang lumipas, tila hindi pa rin nagbabago ang mga Pilipino.And if ever this isn’t truly “the end,” I hope we still get to see more stories from the Bayaniverse, especially with that mid-credit scene tease.",19/10/2025,positive,0.840082645,0
Quezon,"It was a good film, though I'm still trying to understand why some consider it to be the weak link in the Bayaniverse trilogy. It's actually a wonderful movie. Confiado's delivery was excellent, it even brought me to tears because you could truly feel how he fought back against political corruption in the Philippines. I'm not just talking about the character, but this actually reflects our society today and how we struggle and fight against corrupt politicians. It's also great…",19/10/2025,positive,0.996896863,0

Quezon,"Independence: Good enough to eat.127 years of Philippine independence, but are we truly free? Do our statesmen really know how to operate this country with 'freedom' in their hands? Do we even deserve this freedom? Will we ever learn?​This is what Quezon leaves you with. This movie is enjoyable and, as always, provoking.​It brings to mind that known quote from him: ""I'd rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by Americans."" Hearing that again, with what's happening to our country, made me laugh. I like how Tarog thinks, always aiming for relevance by connecting his historical movies to what's happening right now.​As someone who didn't know much about Quezon, I learned a lot and was reminded of the things he did. But it's also a movie about politics. We are introduced to their games, how they operated, and how they think. Today, it might seem obvious. But to think that this has been happening long before our independence has me worried. I was sitting in the cinema literally not knowing exactly how I feel, other than discomfort.​Technically, I appreciated the writing. Despite being dialogue-heavy, the lines are witty and written with a style similar to the Bayaniverse. I also like the aesthetic; it reminds me of Wes Anderson (very subtle) and the likes with its use of symmetry, colors, and scores.​Ultimately, we are shown the humane side of our celebrated heroes. While we appreciate what they've done for our country, we should not be blind to consider them human—not idols, not kings, not gods.​Maraming magagandang salita sa pelikula, pero siguro ang mainam na panapos ay:Maraming politiko, kakaunti ang lingkod-bayan.",22/10/2025,positive,0.989388764,0

While the masses suffer, politicians are just playing game pieces to get more power.4. Makes me question our whole history.5. Too many politicians.

Quezon,"“Body and soul?”Our answer to an Armando Ianucci political satire. Dare I say well shot, exquisitely paced, with nail-biting dialogue that speaks from a century ago to our time. Quezon is a political animal that knew no satisfaction but perhaps was a mere reflection of the period where America (his puppet masters) were too first learning the prizes of Empire. Rosales gives perhaps his defining performance in this stage of his career. Just verve and energy radiating off the screen! Like any of history’s narcissists, it was a downfall well portrayed and a rise to power that echoes DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort. (Where to mention the crispness of a Scorsese film’s editing is also possibly a clear inspiration for this film). Mon Confiado’s Aguinaldo was humanized well away from the El Presidente’s mythic stature. The birth of patronage politics and its attacks on journalism and truth was impeccably presented. Never to the point of celebrating it but dangles its dangers for people to discover and hopefully decry. 4/5",23/10/2025,positive,0.992722332,0

It's a game, as they said.I think we've gone past the idea of portraying a benevolent leader in film, especially in today's political climate, though that Quezon's Game movie kinda did that, but this approach with its series of quarreling is a lot more interesting to me, which has been the motif of this series, anyway.",21/10/2025,positive,0.938659132,0

Quezon,"Director Jerrod Tarog delivers another masterpiece in the Bayaniverse with a showcase in filmmaking excellence in acting, cinematography, editing, production and costume design. I was initially thrown off by Jericho Rosales and Romnick Sarmienta's accents (never bothered to check if that's how Quezon and Osmena sounded in real life) but they're 2 of today's best actors that I eventually appreciated how they fully embodied their respective roles. Ditto Mon Confiado as Aguinaldo, Karylle as Doña Aurora, JC Santos as Roxas, and even Cris Villanueva as fictional character journalist Joven Hernando. It was also nice to see Iain Glen (Jorah Mormont in Game of Thrones) play Governor-General Wood. Quezon's bantering/arguments with both Osmena and Wood were quite amusing/entertaining. Also commend the shift in tone which was like a breath of fresh air in telling a Pinoy historical drama (sort of reminded me of Mike de Leon's 'Bayaning 3rd World' which also starred Villanueva). But if I were to nitpick, I'd note that if Luna and del Pilar were humanized in their respective biographical war dramas, Quezon was villainized here as the idealistic patriot fighting for Philippine independence turned scheming, power hungry politician.

But lord, also the very definition of maingay, chicharon, bungangera. Exposition as dialogue, and not even doing the subtlest job at hiding it.

Quezon,"YOU CAN’T LOSE WITH QUEZONAfter three watches, I can safely say one thing: I have so many thoughts about the Quezon movie, and yet so little words to convey it in. I wrote so many passages down in my notebooks. All of them half-finished or just me arguing with myself trying to make sense of what I was feeling. I’ll try my best to write them here.The Bayaniverse, one of my favorite Filipino movie series, has finally come to a close with (arguably) one of their best movies yet. Quezon veers away from the usual historical biopic formula and moves into the territory of being a social commentary.Instead of the “event A happened, so event B follows” format, Quezon asks us to sit with discomfort. Rather than simply glorifying its subject, the movie presents a national hero who reflects the leaders we have now. A visionary who fought for Filipino independence, yet, a calculating statesman who mastered the performance of politics. Charming when needed, ruthless when required, and deeply aware of optics.I see the movie as something that doesn’t necessarily paint Quezon in a necessarily evil nor corrupt light, but as a pragmatic who knew that idealism alone could not dismantle a colonial-imperialism system built on inequality. That pragmatism, however, is exactly what built the foundations of our current political structure.What does that say about our national heroes? What does that say about the kinds of people we choose to enshrine and remember? Most importantly, what does that say about us?The Quezon we see in the movie is not simply Quezon–he’s also the collective psyche of the nation that produced him and the time that he lived in. He lived under an imperialist, racist U.S. government! As the movie perfectly states, “Quezon may not have made the game, but he sure did play it.”I think Quezon challenges the comfort that we have in hero worship. It dares us to look at power. Not as a moral test or a path to self-actualization, but as a mirror to who we are as a nation going through growing pains. Is it worth acknowledging that building a road to greatness often comes with destroying whatever comes ahead?The real message of the Bayaniverse, in my opinion, is that the nation was not built by perfect saints. It was also built by people who have the tendency to be selfish, flawed, ambitious, and painfully human. The series tells us that our understanding of heroism must mature as we continue to mature as a nation.On a more personal note, I will never forget the feeling of watching it on the big screen. What an amazing movie. The dialogue is witty, suspenseful, and human. Another thing I love about it is the casting. Everyone is so perfect! I knew that Jericho Rosales was a good actor, but he was PHENOMENAL as MLQ! I didn’t expect it at all.The music and cinematography are top-notch too. What a movie! I’d love to be part of something like this one day.I’ve been told that I have the tendency to go insane about the things I love. I’m not a movie person, but I’d love to go to the theater to watch it again, but that’d require me to open my commissions (and so, I’m opening my commissions to watch it again).",24/10/2025,positive,0.984667957,0
Quezon,"It is undeniable that Quezon was depicted as a power-hungry egoistical person in this film. If you think about it, the film unfolds based on the journalist’s perspective. Both on different sides of the coin, but then again, it was the same coin.. talagang morality bends if ikaw ang nakikinabang. Every scene felt like a chess move, a power move even. The Quezon-Osmeña dynamic is so compelling to watch, I am definitely moved.Now about the movie, the cinematography is noticeably visibly great. Even the details tell a story and are so hard not to miss.. the color grade, the camera movement, the aesthetics, and the pacing, all on point !!! Jerrold Tarog showed me a fresh new perspective that makes me want to go down the rabbit hole and watch all his films. hehe I think I just fell in love with history?

Quezon,"Quezon feels like a well-crafted film that Jerrold Tarog put a lot of effort into, both in writing and directing. Rosales’s performance as the lead really stands out and carries the movie. Visually, it’s a treat with a unique old-school style and great production design that captures the early 1900s vibe perfectly.The story also creates a good amount of intrigue, even if some parts aren’t perfectly executed. Despite its flaws, it’s an interesting watch because of its strong visuals and engaging narrative.

Quezon,"painful irony of a nation striving for independence while simultaneously being undermined by internal disunity and dependence on external influence.the film offers a sharp critique of the deeply rooted filipino concept of utang na loob and exposes how it can distort the ideals of governance and public service. what once began as a moral virtue, a sign of respect and loyalty, becomes a political instrument that undermines integrity, opening the door to corruption, favoritism, and blind allegiance. it challenges viewers to reflect on how certain filipino values, while culturally meaningful, can be misused to sustain systems of power that work against true progress.at the same time, the film also confronts a difficult truth: it’s not easy to question or turn away from this cycle, especially when one is personally benefiting from those in power. comfort and convenience can blur one’s moral vision, making it hard to see the injustice hidden behind acts of generosity. it takes courage and self-awareness to break free from that dependence, to open one’s eyes and choose integrity over personal gain.",24/10/2025,positive,0.63076967,0
Quezon,"It depicts how, even long before, politicians have always been performative when it comes to their propaganda just to appear pleasing to the people. Human as we are, Filipinos as we are, we tend to be easily blinded by whatever “truth” is presented to us, especially when it aligns with our values and principles. What struck me most (in the worst way possible) and I was genuinely flabbergasted was the case with his first wife and how he defended himself in court, saying something along the lines of, “Does this face really need to rape someone?” It shows how contradicting his principles already were. You cannot fight for your country if you are struggling to be humane yourself. Quezon took Filipinos as nothing but mere tools for him to gain power. In reality, isa pa rin siyang tuta ng mga Amerikano by adhering to the same vicious practices as those American people.“Independence is just a word.” – QuezonWhat really is independence? Have we truly achieved it if we remain enslaved by poor governance and corruption? After all, he said it himself that he would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by Americans. Perhaps Hobbes was right, man is selfish in nature, and he will do anything through voluntary acts if the object serves some good to himself.Is it the lesser evil for the Philippines to barely progress under Filipino rule, rather than to thrive under an American one? This isn’t to claim that the latter would be preferable, rather, it’s to assert that we deserve a government that upholds both, a competent leadership and a genuinely Filipino sense of governance.",24/10/2025,negative,0.560213983,0

Quezon,"I entered the cinema expecting a crashcourse on history, yet I've been dished with a more nuanced understanding on our collective perception of history as a whole. The movie itself is the statement. Heneral Luna and Goyo have already fixed our expectation/s on how this will turn out: a valorous exhibit on the lives of ""national heroes"" that shaped Philippines as we know it; setting a preliminary idea that it will follow the same pattern about building Quezon as a major contributor of our independence. Yet, as it turns out, the movie stitches reflective points gauging on what these historical acts truly mean to us and the manner as to how these information precipitated through our minds. A magnified look into Quezon as an individual, almost overshadowing the historical context within them opens up a rare opportunity for critiqe against our national heroes. Oftentimes, we are trained to consume knowledge as quick as light, yet there is lesser existential emphasis that allow us to reject passivity in learning. I am too drowsy to add more (i will edit this soon tho), but I really enjoyed thinking about a lot of things such as the state of Philippine politics, statehood, and the lingering wonder as to what truly constitus a hero and power as recursive influence on the trajectory of history and how its viewed.",24/10/2025,positive,0.97735548,0

It’s more than just “crab mentality”; it’s systemic and rooted deep within, right into this country’s body and soul. So when the character of Quezon, an ambitious man who benefitted from (and allegedly originated) the country’s rotten practices, shouted “I am the Philippines”, I was inclined to believe him. On a side note, I’ve always wanted to see more Filipino movies about politicking — which is why the feature scripts I’ve written tackle it extensively — and so this was such a feast for me.",24/10/2025,positive,0.891674221,0

Quezon,"The film’s most intriguing throughline lies in Manuel Quezon’s (Jericho Rosales) exchanges with Joven Hernando (Arron Villaflor as the young journalist, Cris Villanueva as the older one). Joven, who once idolized Quezon, becomes his conscience and later his accuser, returning a coin once given to him as a symbol of principle. Their relationship encapsulates writer-director Jerrold Tarog’s grand question: can integrity survive intimacy with power? It’s through Joven’s eyes that we watch the statesman’s transformation into strongman, his lofty rhetoric curdling into patronage politics. When Quezon shuts down Joven’s newspaper for publishing an exposé, the betrayal stings not only as political allegory but as personal tragedy—the loss of faith in leadership itself.What I found most striking here (and which I strongly feel is the film’s strongest aspect) is how Tarog, through Joven’s eyes, frames Quezon as the unwitting architect of a system that still defines us. Joven suggests that while Quezon didn’t invent patronage politics, he definitely perfected its choreography: every favor disguised as friendship, every handshake turned into hierarchy. The film doesn’t condemn him outright for this; it simply watches how such pragmatism metastasizes into a national reflex that still nags at us today.In one exchange, Quezon insists that principle must bend to survival, a line that feels less like justification than prophecy. Tarog lets that sentiment resonate across the film like a curse. We see it in the way Quezon rewards loyalty with access, in the quiet humiliation of those who refuse to play along, and in the hollow triumph of independence negotiated rather than fought for. The movie’s politics are cyclical, almost fatalistic: power breeds corruption, corruption demands compromise, and compromise becomes governance. Tarog doesn’t spell this out; he lets it unfold in the pauses between alliances and betrayals, in the small intimate silences that follow Quezon’s public victories.Joven’s arc, meanwhile, becomes our moral compass—a journalist who believes truth can coexist with patronage, only to learn that one always consumes the other. His disillusionment is as national as it is personal. By the time he returns the coin Quezon once gave him, the gesture feels both intimate and historical, like a nation finally returning the debt of false ideals. Tarog’s “Bayaniverse” has always traced this erosion, but here it feels complete: Quezon may have built the country’s first Republic, but he also built the template for its recurring undoing.What the film ultimately suggests is that corruption in the Philippines isn’t an aberration—it’s an inheritance. Quezon’s genius wasn’t that he corrupted the system, but that he understood how to make corruption look like leadership. His brand of “opportunistic nationalism,” as historians have called it, didn’t die with him; it evolved, refined by each successor who learned the same survivalist grace. Tarog’s gaze isn’t accusatory, though. It’s almost elegiac, as if recognizing that Quezon’s contradictions—his brilliance, his vanity, his compromises—are also ours.",24/10/2025,positive,0.859989107,0

Quezon,"As the final chapter of Jerrold Tarog’s Bayaniverse trilogy, Quezon wraps things up in a way that’s both bold and refreshing. I went into this with zero expectations since it didn’t get much buzz, but honestly, it’s a must-watch even if you haven’t seen Heneral Luna or Goyo. It may not be as explosive or emotionally charged as Heneral Luna, nor as poetic as Goyo, but its quirky, satirical tone gives it a distinct identity that stands strong alongside the first two films.Seeing Quezon’s story unfold beyond the pages of history books is fascinating. Tarog leans into dark humor and sharp political satire, exposing the manipulative, chaotic world of power struggles — Quezon versus fellow politicians and the Americans. This isn’t your typical biopic; it’s a political farce where Jericho Rosales’ Quezon treats nationhood like a rigged game only he can win. He lies when needed, bends the truth to his advantage, and embodies both heroism and hypocrisy.What makes this film stand out is its honesty. It doesn’t glorify Quezon... it exposes his flaws, ambition, and contradictions. The inclusion of media’s role in shaping narratives adds another layer, reminding us that there are always two sides to every story. The line “heroism is just a perception” sums it up perfectly.Jericho Rosales is phenomenal here that you forget you’re watching him, he is Quezon. Mon Confiado as Aguinaldo, and the actors portraying Osmeña and Roxas, all deliver sharp, grounded performances that complement the film’s tone.The ending hits hard with its satirical bite, when Quezon declares, “I am the Philippines.” Tarog leaves it open to interpretation, but to me, it’s a powerful commentary on power, ego, and politics — on how even noble intentions can rot when corrupted by greed. A hero proclaiming that he is the country becomes the same figure consumed by its flaws. It’s ironic, timely, and uncomfortably reflective of the state of our nation today.Quezon isn’t just a political film — it’s a mirror held up to our nation, to our leaders, and to ourselves. It’s raw, funny, unsettling, and deeply Filipino. A brilliant, unflinching finale to Tarog’s Bayaniverse.",23/10/2025,positive,0.988800049,0

Quezon,"""madaming pulitiko pero kakaunti lamang ang lingkod-bayan""the last installment to the bayaniverse of tba studios takes a 180 turn in terms of offering its narrative to a hero that this movie is supposed to glorify. While Manuel Quezon remains as a polarizing figure in Philippine history what Quezon offers is trying to show both sides of the coin. That Manuel Quezon has his fair share of contribution to the independence of the country while also not turning a blind eye to his ill deeds. While the film is historically accurate and strong with its references to past events what drags it down is the fictional dramatization for story build-up purposes. My personal fave in this movie hihi that I loved how they told the narrative of the movie within a movie itself (this may make or break the viewing experience depends on the audience preference however in my case it worked!). What confused me, though, was how the film tried to paint Emilio Aguinaldo as a noble hero despite the long-standing accusations against him. Still, as a self-proclaimed history nerd, this film was a feast for my brain and how it challenged, debunked, and reanalyzed so much of what I thought I knew. The sharp dialogues also double as timely social commentary that still hits hard today.",25/10/2025,negative,0.52077961,0

Quezon,"A bit better than Heneral Luna and ties together all the themes established from the first two movies. Siyempre andiyan pa rin yung mga ""audience surrogate"" scenes in which the characters engage in dialogue that's artificial instead of letting the audience figure it out for themselves. Case in point: yung kumakain sina Joven, Rusca, Carmen at Nadia while mansplaining that being educated doesn't mean you cannot be fooled. Also, I don't understand getting miffed by Quezon's portrayal in a negative light — deconstruction is the whole shtick of the ""Bayaniverse"". It's intended to serve as counterpoints to the textbooks that mythologize historical figures. Hindi naman siya malicious. They're humans after all and politics is intrinsically dirty and ugly. Quezon even correctly points out that Joven is a hypocrite for trying to cast stones. May false equivalence pa yung relative na under Trump daw tayo if Quezon didn't push for independence. Ah ewan. Basta gumana yung tradecraft nila na yan to get more butts in the seats. And on that note, I look forward to phase two with Magsaysay.

Quezon,"Easily one of my most favorite films of all time, not because of my personal bias towards the Bayaniverse films nor because of my views and opinions on MLQ, but because of how much impact this could make in shaping conversations about our ""heroes.""Historical figures are all subject to the judgment of history. We cannot confine MLQ into being an exclusively great statesman, nor into a cunning chameleon of a politician. We've got to see the good, the bad, and the ugly.After all, his decisions are a product of the conditions of the Philippines during his time. Love him or hate him, MLQ made his mark in our history. Marks that should be studied and learned from, lest we repeat the mistakes of the past.Anyway, what really stood up to me in this film is the wide use of juxtaposition and contrast in its storytelling, in the conversations between Quezon and Osmeña, Quezon and Aguinaldo, Aguinaldo and Wood, Wood and Quezon, so on.This film made me want to re-read Nick Joaquin's 'A Question Of Heroes'. And of course, learn more about the man himself, Manuel Luis Quezon. Ironic lang na nauna ko pa ito mapanood before 'Quezon's Game'.Though it must be said. The ""government run by hell by Filipinos"" is pretty much Quezon's legacy, a legacy of ambition-driven politics fueled by patronage.

Quezon,"I finally watched Quezon with my family after we got the time to see it in the cinema. It is the final and third film released after Goyo which was shown seven years ago. This film took several years into production which made me think if ever this will be finished since it would take a lot of money to make it and possibly got delayed because of the pandemic as well.When the cast and more details were announced, I am glad that it still pushed through despite some delays in production. However, what raised some eyebrows is the announcement of Jericho Rosales as Manuel L. Quezon since there was another actor that was supposed to portray an older version of him. I was surprised because Quezon is a mestizo while Rosales is a moreno actor. While I think this must be a miscast, I was intrigued whether he can pull this off since he is also a good actor too and has played lead roles in the past. Watched the movie, I was impressed by Rosales's portrayal of Quezon as an ambitious yet charismatic senator who wants to liberate the Philippines from the Americans. I had my doubts at first that Jerrold Tarog would make Quezon a good person yet what he did in this film he made him a morally grey character. It based Quezon on several historical documents and articles. While it didn't cover much about everything, it is clear that Quezon is what we call in a politics a "" trapo"" where he uses people to his advantage and perception in winning the elections and attaining power. Watching the film made me realize that everything is still relevant to what is happening today. Same people but different faces. The movie depicts how politics is game for the politicians where the masses are still considered pawns and the rich and elite still dictate everything and control the society. In this film, I didn't root for either Quezon or Aguinaldo. There is neither black and white nor good and bad. Overall, the film is great and entertaining to watch. The veteran and rising cast is great. I also think that Quezon and Osmeña here have chemistry as rivals turned to running mates. It's also an eye-opener to everyone especially when some of the issues in this film are still relevant to our country. Joven and his family represent our struggle in facing the reality of our country. Corruption is a systemic problem in our country and the film makes us think whether we are truly free. Even if we are independent, imperialism still exists in our country especially with how first world countries interfere with our affairs and also control our economy in other ways. The political system is still same but worse and I can still see Quezon in some politicians in the news. With Quezon showing in cinemas, I hope that more people will learn to discern and choose leaders carefully and see them in a lens where they don't vote them just because they're popular or owe them everything. Quezon is not perfect in terms of production and pacing, but it's a fun watch and has served its purpose for the general public.

Quezon,"jericho delivered a layered performance so i’ll deliver a layered reviewat first, I thought the choice to tell the story from That POV was just a gimmicky choice, like form over substance, but as the film continued it felt like a very relevant meta commentary (idk for sure if that’s the intention). (For added context for the succeeding parts of this review, Quezon’s grandson crashed out during a press tour as he claims there are gross inaccuracies in the film.)The way this film dealt about propaganda stuck with me. Choosing to tell the story in that POV further drives the point for me. Quezon’s grandson crashed out because of inaccuracies, but this film isn’t supposed to be seen as an historical account (as well as the previous films in this trilogy for that matter). Telling the story from the perspective of the film reels for me feels like the director’s way of telling us that these films shouldn’t be read as historical accounts because they are just not. In fact it could even be interpreted as propaganda by some. But that is what the film means to me at least. When TJ Trinidad was recast, I was hesitant, mainly because TJ looked like a modern Manuel Quezon. But after seeing Jericho’s performance as the titular character, no one could’ve done a better job. The voice, the mannerisms, the small details, it’s so layered and I could watch it for hours on end. Everyone else in the cast did a fantastic job as well. (Fuck the CongTV cameo tho)I was shocked by how much they grounded Manuel Quezon back to reality and deconstructed the person. Quezon is one of my favorite presidents, but this made me look at him at a less fanatic perspective. Quezon was one smart mf, but that was also his flaw. He may be the our country’s best example of what a Machiavellian is. He played the cards he was dealt with yes, but he did so knowing the game was rigged while still benefiting from it, and even contributing to the rot. The way imperialism and independence is dealt with here has me conflicted, I still have no cohesive thoughts about how they discussed it, maybe on a rewatch. Politics is a game to those in power even if it shouldn’t be because our lives depend on it. ALSO the tension built in the Bagac Bataan scene IS SO!!!!!!also i geeked tf out when they mentioned Murnau like hellooo (felt like the director just wanna flex his knowledge about filmmaking but still appreciated lol)anyways, I need to see it again",25/10/2025,positive,0.935423434,0

Quezon,Quezon is a somewhat tacky drama that reduces the life and career of former Philippines president Manuel L. Quezon to a series of trite political battles. All the characters have shallow personalities. The dialogue and acting are often cringeworthy.,04/11/2025,negative,0.638094783,0
Quezon,"If Tarog’s goal was to make history feel alive again, then he has succeeded—sometimes to the point of discomfort. As cinema, “Quezon” is impressive. As history, it’s provocative. And as myth, it’s necessary.",25/10/2025,positive,0.976554751,0
