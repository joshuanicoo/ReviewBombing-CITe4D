21,3,charles2002,2024-01-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,This film starts during his early childhood days up to his demise
21,4,charles2002,2024-01-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It's difficult to make a biopic with such scope, other biopics tend to focus on one important event of someone's life but this film really tried to cover everything, I must say that they were able to achieve in showing the essence and ideals of the church leader in their perspective but provided merely a glimpse of the significant events that challenged the institution since they transitioned from one important event to another every 2-3 minutes"

21,8,charles2002,2024-01-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,This film has its merits but the obvious one-sidedness and bias towards Manalo made the film more of a propaganda

38,4,punq,2017-01-22 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,"So not unlike just about every religious group sponsored film, it's cringe worthy to watch for a non-believer"

38,12,punq,2017-01-22 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,"While the acting is respectable, it's still what these actors do on a daily basis on daytime soaps"
38,13,punq,2017-01-22 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,"Not the worst offender of religious propaganda, it serves as a part filipino history lesson, but it's not the epic it promised to be"
