Hayop Ka,12,21,aumarivero,2020-11-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,As in going back to square one or zero
Hayop Ka,12,22,aumarivero,2020-11-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,Or is it a depiction of a second chance at love at the same start
Hayop Ka,12,23,aumarivero,2020-11-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,I don't know the answers but I'm happy to be intrigued
Hayop Ka,12,24,aumarivero,2020-11-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,Good job and again congratulations to the team behind this
Hayop Ka,13,1,bergenkremer,2021-01-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,"Visually pleasant, rather disappointing story-wise: All that is good in this title is it's eye-catching art"
Hayop Ka,13,2,bergenkremer,2021-01-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,"Granted, I watched the English dub, so I could have missed a lot of untranslatable jokes throughout the movie, but it seemed that most of them are toilet humour and jokes for 12-year-olds anyway"
Hayop Ka,13,3,bergenkremer,2021-01-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,The whole plot revolves around such trivial and beaten tropes that nothing in the movie strikes me as exciting or unexpected
Hayop Ka,13,4,bergenkremer,2021-01-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,"This title could have tried to be anything else but the cheesy and unoriginal romcom that it is, and with the beautiful art direction it could be more mature and bring more to the table in terms of story and characters"
Hayop Ka,13,5,bergenkremer,2021-01-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,"The main plot doesn't grab any stars from the sky, nor does it even try to be original"
Hayop Ka,13,6,bergenkremer,2021-01-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,"My takeaway: I would love to see more projects by the animation team behind this movie, but in a title that will actually make me feel something"
Hayop Ka,14,1,merylldiola,2021-01-11 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,PLEASE MAKE MORE FILMS LIKE THIS

Hayop Ka,15,1,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"Nice graphics and amusing characters, but terrible message: The movie has been a pleasant eye candy visually, the characters somewhat enjoyable,though a bit insipid and cliché"
Hayop Ka,15,2,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,But what is the moral of the story
Hayop Ka,15,3,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,Its OK to cheat
Hayop Ka,15,4,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"Its OK to laugh and be angry on somebody because he is poor and you want more than that, that you just like him for sex, and insult him for loving you and wanting to be with you"
Hayop Ka,15,5,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,Not saying he was the greatest but the main character was angry at him and laughing at him for unreasonable motives
Hayop Ka,15,6,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"Also throwing a fit over something she herself ends up doing, having unprotected sex resulting in a baby"
Hayop Ka,15,7,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,And happy in the end because
Hayop Ka,15,8,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"what, she made a new friend"
Hayop Ka,15,9,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"Almost instantly after a rage fuelled cat fight with the rich guy and his""friend""

What is the reason of this movie"
Hayop Ka,15,10,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,I feel sorry for the animators that had to put up with such a dull content
Hayop Ka,15,11,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,They made me give it 3 stars rating and one more star for some amusing scenes
Hayop Ka,15,12,Frutic,2022-01-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,But it's not saving the movie at all

Hayop Ka,17,3,adriannieva,2020-11-03 00:00:00.000,30.0,imdb,"With animation, you can show more of your imagination that is difficult to perform with live actors but unfortunately they stuck with the usual filipino content"
Hayop Ka,18,1,kirkespinar,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,Philippine Animation at its best: I loved every single bit of it
Hayop Ka,18,2,kirkespinar,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"From the animation, to the witty dialogue, to the story (you'll like it better once you're aware that it's supposed to be a parody of Filipino teleserye romcom tropes), and even the music"
Hayop Ka,18,3,kirkespinar,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"As contrary to what some might have said about it, I actually find it to be pretty woke and progressive, with its not-so-subtle nods to current social issues such as contractualization, police brutality, etc"
Hayop Ka,18,4,kirkespinar,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Like, there was even a scene in the film where you can find a poster with Duterte's face on it depicted as a literal dog; how can you be more woke than that"
Hayop Ka,18,5,kirkespinar,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Politics aside, I really enjoyed the film overall"
Hayop Ka,18,6,kirkespinar,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,I hope Hayop Ka

Hayop Ka,19,5,ArtSmart-40856,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"The same studio that created Saving Sally, you can easily tell their signature style that separates them from other animation studios here and globally"
Hayop Ka,19,6,ArtSmart-40856,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Much like Cartoon Saloon, an animation studio based in Ireland (Song of the Sea, Bread Winner to name a few of their movies) focus on their unique styles of visuals in their story telling"

Hayop Ka,21,4,psalmgerhartbecodovargas,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,It's creepy and cringey

Hayop Ka,23,8,breadandhammers,2023-05-12 00:00:00.000,,imdb,A wonderful film
Hayop Ka,23,9,breadandhammers,2023-05-12 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"Personally, I don't think of this as a ""dirty"" film"

Hayop Ka,24,2,djked,2020-09-26 13:36:05.362,,ltbx,The film's title fits him

Hayop Ka,27,1,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I was pretty much on the bandwagon with this movie, mostly because of the devoted effort that the animators have worked on from Rocketsheep Studio's last film from 2016, Saving Sally, a beautifully made film mixing animated and live-action elements in a seamless polish, only to be pulled down with a standard plot and intolerable characters"
Hayop Ka,27,2,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"So even with my skewed expectations for this film, I still do hope that this would fare better, and"
Hayop Ka,27,3,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It does, but it does not at the same time"
Hayop Ka,27,4,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"So I may as well start out with the cons before the pros, and these have to do with the story and themes itself and how the tone can clash with the animation"
Hayop Ka,27,5,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Given that it's rated 18, the themes that it tackles do fit well, but how they are executed is in poor taste, which does remind me of how Saving Sally executes its own mature themes, but at least this film gives these themes a bit more room for discussion, even if it's dealt with in a sour, and sometimes questionable manner"
Hayop Ka,27,6,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The story is simple yet dramatic and can hit some good moments
Hayop Ka,27,7,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I just wished it was a bit longer and does not cut through dramatic scene to dramatic scene so quickly, which made the resolution and ending so spotty, unsatisfying, and utterly rushed"
Hayop Ka,27,8,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The overall tone can clash with the animation in a consistent way, as some scenes do not mesh well with the hyperbolic nature of the animation, which can make some of the melodramatic scenes to be unfit and oddly uncomfortable with the cinematic and energetic flow of the animation"
Hayop Ka,27,9,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Pushing the flaws aside, I will say that the animation is excellent all throughout"
Hayop Ka,27,10,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Smooth, expressive, and gives the characters a lot of personality"
Hayop Ka,27,11,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The backgrounds are detailed with anthro versions of real-life brands, mottos, and references which gives more attention to detail to the movie"
Hayop Ka,27,12,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And the performances for the most part are also in their A-game as well, especially Angelica Panganiban"
Hayop Ka,27,13,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even despite my mixed feelings for this movie, I still do want to convince everyone to watch the film, because if the film managed to succeed in its streaming sales, then that would determine how many animated films would go down the line in the years to come"
Hayop Ka,27,14,ruke256,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And hey, with the animation this good, who wouldn't be excited for more locally animated films such as this one"

Hayop Ka,28,2,christianserdon,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The characters are horrible and even the titular role isn't really admirable nor rootable at the very least

Hayop Ka,76,2,lydiatar,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,i stopped watching filipino tv dramas because of their constant misogynistic and classist storylines and it makes me sad that this promising pinoy-made animation film followed that toxic path

Hayop Ka,83,6,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I got to be honest, 2020 is the year where the small and low-budget animated movies managed to be at times on par with the mainstream giants"

Hayop Ka,83,10,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The amount of animal-related puns, innuendos and sexual tensions justify the M18 rating there, but it also sacrificed the cohesion and flow of the love triangle, an absolute shame given that it's the writing that mainly let the whole movie down (also, a little bit too many storylines to cover in such a short frame)"
Hayop Ka,83,11,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Still, for their first animated movie attempt, the story is still enjoyable to a certain extent"
Hayop Ka,83,12,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But, let's talk about the most surprising element of the movie: the animation"

Hayop Ka,83,14,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I know I prefer 2D animation to 3D CGI, but for an animated movie made in the Philippines, this is a solid attempt"
Hayop Ka,83,15,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There are moments where the colours are a little bit flat, but when the animation gets dynamic, it shows the full potential of its animation and we rarely get this type of animation anymore"
Hayop Ka,83,16,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kudos to the guys at Rocketsheep for such great animation
Hayop Ka,83,17,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As for characters, most of the main cast are full realised, although given its 73-minute runtime, some of the development felt rushed"
Hayop Ka,83,18,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I feel for the main character Nimfa (voiced by Angelica Panganiban) as she struggled to keep her affection with the rich businessman a secret as well as the two main male leads
Hayop Ka,83,19,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"If the story is a letdown, the entertaining characters did not"
Hayop Ka,83,20,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I will give Hayop Ka credit for one thing: they should not be underestimated when it comes to low budget animated movies that came out in 2020, especially when it's easily one of the most entertaining low budget animated movies of 2020"
Hayop Ka,83,21,blaziker,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's currently available in most Asian countries that has Netflix, so if you can't wait to support Filippino animation but you are outside Asia, do keep a lookout for its release in other countries on Netflix"

Hayop Ka,100,13,conan101,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The story and the script are kinda bad tho
Hayop Ka,100,14,conan101,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"All in all, You can skip this film"
Hayop Ka,101,1,pmec,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This film missed the chance to use ‘MEOWther Fvcker’ as a translation to Pusang Ina
Hayop Ka,101,2,pmec,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Animation is on a hundred
Hayop Ka,101,3,pmec,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Super love the visuals
Hayop Ka,101,4,pmec,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Most of the jokes landed and it’s actually really funny
Hayop Ka,101,5,pmec,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Even the little details like Nimfa tried pushing the automatics sliding door
Hayop Ka,101,6,pmec,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The story is a little bit
Hayop Ka,101,8,pmec,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And not the one coming from The boobs of Nimfa’s mom
Hayop Ka,102,1,ladyl,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"""Mas masarap kaya mag angkas sa motor"

Hayop Ka,103,1,juansolo81,2020-10-30 10:36:37.485,20.0,ltbx,The best thing I can say is that it had animation and I got drunk while watching
Hayop Ka,104,1,jelplanas,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,only thing bad about this is robin padilla being in the cast
Hayop Ka,105,1,karasuno,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"the animation was absolutely amazing, but the plot was mediocre at best"
Hayop Ka,105,2,karasuno,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"also, the voice acting was meh"
Hayop Ka,105,3,karasuno,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,this is lowkey a furry conversion movie
Hayop Ka,106,1,abnerdormiendo,2020-10-30 12:43:34.957,80.0,ltbx,It makes for an entertaining half-told story
Hayop Ka,106,2,abnerdormiendo,2020-10-30 12:43:34.957,80.0,ltbx,But that's it
Hayop Ka,106,3,abnerdormiendo,2020-10-30 12:43:34.957,80.0,ltbx,It's half a story
Hayop Ka,107,1,yourpotato,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,my stars are only for the animators
Hayop Ka,107,2,yourpotato,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,they did well
Hayop Ka,107,3,yourpotato,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,don't like the story but it is funny
Hayop Ka,108,1,geraidine,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,one and a half  for the animation
Hayop Ka,108,2,geraidine,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to save the film"
Hayop Ka,108,3,geraidine,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,the artists who worked hard to bring this to life deserve a better narrative to productively waste their time on the next time
Hayop Ka,108,4,geraidine,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"an additional half  for the poorly executed attempt to squeeze the plethora of social issues in the country (contractualization, sex education, to name a few) and other glorified constructs we should never even have in the first place (i’d like to think their characters as satire, most especially Inigo’s"
Hayop Ka,108,5,geraidine,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"tangina, El*n M*sk"
Hayop Ka,109,1,jsphqlo,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,ok sige sobrang ganda ng animation pero basura talaga yung kwento tapos sana voice actors na lang kinuha nila yun lang
Hayop Ka,110,1,goromajima,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"the art is really really pretty, i appreciate the jokes here and there and the hard work the studio put behind this"
Hayop Ka,110,2,goromajima,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,i'd also probably rewatch to read all the witty background signs but i wish there was more to the story than just that
Hayop Ka,110,3,goromajima,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,the misogyny truly jumped out
Hayop Ka,111,1,samricasata,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,kwentong kalye at its finest
Hayop Ka,111,2,samricasata,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,all the stars are for the super pleasing animation
Hayop Ka,111,3,samricasata,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,could’ve been a great chance to tell a meaningful story so sayang
Hayop Ka,112,1,nikkibon,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Beautiful animation and an enjoyable performance from Sam Milby, though I must agree na parang sayang nga"
Hayop Ka,112,2,nikkibon,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Entertaining to some extent, lalo na sa jokes and puns, but I think writing and development could’ve been better, and I think it’s more obvious as you go along"
Hayop Ka,112,3,nikkibon,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Gets na satire etc etc pero pwede pa rin naman i-push yun eh
Hayop Ka,112,4,nikkibon,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Also would’ve been interesting to see professional voice actors star in this, but ayun"
Hayop Ka,112,5,nikkibon,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Cute ng character ni Jerry and lol
Hayop Ka,112,6,nikkibon,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Moira de la Torre and Papa P in this
Hayop Ka,113,1,fabgelous,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The characters are so cute
Hayop Ka,113,2,fabgelous,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Great illustration and animation
Hayop Ka,113,3,fabgelous,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The attention to detail was amazing
Hayop Ka,113,4,fabgelous,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There are a few misogynistic undertones though but all in all, I enjoyed it"
Hayop Ka,114,1,belletoledo,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The animation and attention to detail = chef's kissBut the storyline  I was waiting for it to redeem itself
Hayop Ka,114,2,belletoledo,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It did not
Hayop Ka,115,1,jaireyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,at least na feel kong gusto ko ng hotdog dahil sa palabas na to
Hayop Ka,116,1,watchedbykeith,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,wtf is this shit
Hayop Ka,117,1,waydowntown,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,can’t believe this is the shit storyline they decided to go with
Hayop Ka,118,1,kenntouchthiss,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Genuinely liked this a lot cause it felt more like a satirical perspective on the usual Filipino mainstream movies (adultery, class issues, you get it)"
Hayop Ka,118,2,kenntouchthiss,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Story really was just meh tho the plot could have been more fleshed out, dialogue was pretty witty tho plus the voice acting was surprisingly well done too (fuck u pa din Robin P"
Hayop Ka,118,3,kenntouchthiss,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,) But what really takes the bait is the animation my god it really sucks you in and reminded me of how bojack horseman (who makes a silent guest appearance at the end) used to do that too
Hayop Ka,118,4,kenntouchthiss,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"So yeah heavy 3 to light 4 (out of 5) on thisFun time if you're drunk, or even if you're not"
Hayop Ka,119,1,orbskie,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Amazed with the attention to detail, context, setting, THE ANIMATIONS"
Hayop Ka,119,2,orbskie,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,First time to see an animated film that I can understand its local language (didn't need subs for this one
Hayop Ka,119,3,orbskie,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,) Though ngl there’s so much to improve on especially in terms of plot and casting
Hayop Ka,119,4,orbskie,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Either way, it was an enjoyable watch"
Hayop Ka,120,1,jeizukafu,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sobrang ganda kasama na rin ang produksyon at pag-arte
Hayop Ka,120,2,jeizukafu,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Panalo para sa unang animasyon na pelikula sa ating bansa
Hayop Ka,121,1,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"SPOILERS all the way1) Since I watched the film with friends (through Netflix Party/Teleparty), there was entertainment in its crude dialogue and spotting out several puns, even the corny ones like in the police station: ""We Serve and Protecc"" but it became apparent, around halfway through the run time, the film has nothing else to offer"
Hayop Ka,121,2,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,2) Inconsistent characterization with ML (Huskie)
Hayop Ka,121,3,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"At first, he was portrayed as an arrogant rich snob by buying a whole restaurant for failing to honor his reservation"
Hayop Ka,121,4,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"Then, for the most part, he was actually kind"
Hayop Ka,121,5,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,Not only to the FL but to everyone
Hayop Ka,121,6,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"His character came back near the end where he says ""Girls no need to fight"
Hayop Ka,121,7,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"You can share me"""
Hayop Ka,121,8,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,But at that point it was already a hopeless case
Hayop Ka,121,9,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,3) There are some potential dramatic scenes but somewhat downplayed by execution
Hayop Ka,121,10,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,Example near the end where the FL finds that her sister is already a parent
Hayop Ka,121,11,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,There is no apparent build-up
Hayop Ka,121,12,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"It escalated quickly, in this case, to a cat fight, which to be honest lost its effectiveness"
Hayop Ka,121,13,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"A sample of a proper build-up is that classic ""Wag Mo Akong Ma Terry Terry"" scene"
Hayop Ka,121,14,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"In this scene, there was also a beat of the sister returning a money FL sent through the years"
Hayop Ka,121,15,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,I like this beat
Hayop Ka,121,16,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,It gives the sister a bit more depth that she is not solely living off FL's allowance and is actually serious about earning her keep
Hayop Ka,121,17,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"But it was just downplayed, as if it didn't happen"
Hayop Ka,121,18,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,Like FL didn't even recognize this
Hayop Ka,121,19,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,It would have been nice if sister put up a fight with FL
Hayop Ka,121,20,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,It was all too one-sided
Hayop Ka,121,21,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"Also in this scene, I'm 50/50 on this"
Hayop Ka,121,22,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,They made a joke after the dramatic scene
Hayop Ka,121,23,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,Can't recall it properly but it includes FL saying you are too young
Hayop Ka,121,24,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,You don't have breast
Hayop Ka,121,25,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,I might even have to breast feed your baby
Hayop Ka,121,26,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"Then FL's mother rebuts, don't worry I can still breastfeed while she massages her breast"
Hayop Ka,121,27,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"Like whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut I mean per se its funny, it's just a bit out of place"
Hayop Ka,121,28,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"4) At its current state, the writing is just an excuse to make the film rather than the basis of the film"
Hayop Ka,121,29,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,This is a shame because the script has a potential dramatic core
Hayop Ka,121,30,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"I'm referring to FL discovering she is (A) pregnant not with her current BF but with her recent ex, (B) who happens to now be with her best friend and all the while (C) her sister is also pregnant"
Hayop Ka,121,31,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,The way I would see it is her sister represents hope so seeing that hope broken also affects her
Hayop Ka,121,32,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,Another depth is the FL is now being a hypocrite by not practicing what she preach which is use contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancy
Hayop Ka,121,33,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"As you can see, there are a lot of events that carry the film"
Hayop Ka,121,34,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"If only that drama happened much earlier and they tackled it properly with proper thought process, it would have be a concrete film"
Hayop Ka,121,35,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,What happened in the film is FL goes to radio station and asks for advice
Hayop Ka,121,36,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,I mean how lazy can you be
Hayop Ka,121,37,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"I can't wholeheartedly recommend Jowables but at least that film did justice to unwanted pregnancy plot point5) So, for the most part of the film, our FL is the ""bad character"" for intentionally cheating"
Hayop Ka,121,38,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"One way or another, the film will eventually redeem her"
Hayop Ka,121,39,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"Apart from having unwanted pregnancy which audience pity, the film ""redeems"" FL by having FL's ex hook up with FL's best friend"
Hayop Ka,121,40,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,I actually don't mind this per se
Hayop Ka,121,41,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,What I mind is the ex instantly became an asshole and the FL's best friend a bitch
Hayop Ka,121,42,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"Oh if you're wondering how does this redeem the FL, it's the case of ""I am bad, but other people do more bad to me"
Hayop Ka,121,43,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"So I'm not that bad"" kind of narrative"
Hayop Ka,121,44,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"It's subtle but, since at this point, the FL is now a total underdog, the audience will naturally root for her, to some degree"
Hayop Ka,121,45,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,6) Part of #4
Hayop Ka,121,46,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,If only we get the side of FL's ex and FL's best friend after hearing about the pregnancy
Hayop Ka,121,47,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,Would have been a proper film
Hayop Ka,121,48,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"7) The music, both the BGM, fx, foleys etc, are somewhat shabby choices"
Hayop Ka,121,49,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,Can't really support this one since I'm not a music/audio person but it's the type not quite for film-material
Hayop Ka,121,50,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,8) I also don't get why the characters need to be animals
Hayop Ka,121,51,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"In Zootopia or Beastars, it makes sense because it's part of their discrimation plot point (i"
Hayop Ka,121,53,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,prey vs predator)
Hayop Ka,121,54,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"The only reference I can is in the title ""Hayop Ka"" where the FL obeys her survival or pleasure instinct like an animal"
Hayop Ka,121,55,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,They could have been just human characters and it wouldn't make much difference
Hayop Ka,121,56,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,"9) The FL's love problem is somewhat resolve by hooking up with the driver character, the frog"
Hayop Ka,121,57,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,I'm not sure what to feel about that
Hayop Ka,121,58,bentraje,2020-10-31 01:14:15.561,80.0,ltbx,10) I like the ending montage sequence
Hayop Ka,122,1,ironwasp,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,2 stars for the animations ONLY
Hayop Ka,122,2,ironwasp,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,typical philippine cinema trope YUCK
Hayop Ka,122,3,ironwasp,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,this made me laugh nonetheless
Hayop Ka,123,1,laikhuh,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,hayop bat ko ba to pinanood
Hayop Ka,124,1,aynz,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I watched this for the animation and bore through the cringe-worthy voice acting and unlike-able characters
Hayop Ka,124,2,aynz,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"There was no character development whatsoever and the story is borderline problematic to say the very least, but what refreshing visuals"
Hayop Ka,124,3,aynz,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Let's support Filipino animators so that they won't have to bring to life stories like this again
Hayop Ka,125,1,stefunny,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"thanks i hate it,,,,,,, ganda pa naman ng animation but the story is,,, ugly"
Hayop Ka,126,1,jrayvillanueva,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I feel bad rating it this low but the quality of the animation cannot redeem how awful the story is
Hayop Ka,127,1,rundomron,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,binawas ko ng one star kasi binigyan nila ng trabaho si Robin Padilla

Hayop Ka,132,1,myzk,2020-10-31 10:23:42.157,60.0,ltbx,ampanget ng story and script pero in fairness nice yung animation
Hayop Ka,133,1,rosevalentine,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The animation is great but yes, there are times it can be a bit constrained"
Hayop Ka,133,2,rosevalentine,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The story is mainstream (typical Filipino mainstream movies) but the script has its moments--it has a bit of witty dialogues here and there
Hayop Ka,133,3,rosevalentine,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The ending though, is problematic"
Hayop Ka,133,4,rosevalentine,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,You don't portray female characters with that kind of perspective
Hayop Ka,133,5,rosevalentine,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It's not just women who are to blame for their relationship problems
Hayop Ka,134,1,enzangeles,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Despite the obvious problems with the films topics, I felt like the writers could have pushed the story towards a deeper ""bojack-finding-himself"" approach instead of the typical nice guys finish last trope because we all know that its just way overused"
Hayop Ka,134,2,enzangeles,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,But kudos to the people who worked on the film
Hayop Ka,134,3,enzangeles,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Totally enjoyed the subtle bastos jokes and the beautiful art
Hayop Ka,134,4,enzangeles,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,This film might seem like a setback but I do hope the production learns from their mistakes and keep making films

Hayop Ka,136,1,roynarra,2020-10-31 13:52:05.424,100.0,ltbx,Underdeveloped story but the animation and the voice performances of Angelica Panganiban and Piolo Pascual were enough to salvage this
Hayop Ka,137,1,gracekclly,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"pros include the animation, details & angelica panganibancons include bakit si robin padilla yung si roger :((( dami ngang dds sa voice actors huhuhu and i guess the plot too"
Hayop Ka,138,1,lejacobins,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Yes support local but it has to be good local or else we'll be complacent with bad local and keep making bad local
Hayop Ka,138,2,lejacobins,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,This movie's saving grace is really its animation and it's sad to know that the artists got underpaid
Hayop Ka,138,3,lejacobins,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, the form isn't always what a movie is and it also needs substance"
Hayop Ka,138,4,lejacobins,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Literally Nimfa did not learn anything at the end of the movie as he hooks up with the frog
Hayop Ka,138,5,lejacobins,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,A lot of things in…

Hayop Ka,140,1,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this is getting 3 stars solely because of the animationI just finished this and I swear this may be another huge step for Filipino animation
Hayop Ka,140,2,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The animation is gorgeous here
Hayop Ka,140,3,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I love it so much
Hayop Ka,140,4,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,One would see all the references of the local places here and that just made me so excited
Hayop Ka,140,5,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Gosh, Filipino animation definitely needs more support"
Hayop Ka,140,6,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In line with that need for support,major oof for the narrative"
Hayop Ka,140,7,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Nimfa isn't a character you would actually root for, sadly"
Hayop Ka,140,8,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I'm really sad how the plot is constructed and how it ended
Hayop Ka,140,9,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I was really annoyed at the part wherein Nimfa was being dragged down even more for her ""human choices"" like oof, she was legit called out in a really terrible way on live radio"
Hayop Ka,140,10,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Gosh that was really an oof
Hayop Ka,140,11,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"PLUS, THAT WAS A CLIMAX MAN HHHHH"
Hayop Ka,140,12,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This film pretty much used a lot of stereotypes commonly seen in Filipino media hhhhhhh
Hayop Ka,140,13,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Love triangles, the romanticization of pregnancy, cinderella stories, misogyny, rich families, and kinda a lot more, just oof, really"
Hayop Ka,140,14,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There's kinda a lot of romanticization hhhhh
Hayop Ka,140,15,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Nimfa tries to be a redeeming character who's slightly politically and socially aware but that's not enough to redeem herself as a protagonist
Hayop Ka,140,16,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I enjoyed a lot of the animation and references mostly
Hayop Ka,140,17,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The fight scenes and change of animation styles throughout the story is what honestly allowed me to stay hooked in this film
Hayop Ka,140,18,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This Filipino animation film is another huge step for animation in the country, but it is also a wake-up call for Filipino storytellers to change the landscape of storytelling"
Hayop Ka,140,19,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Yes, we should serve the masses and let them relate"
Hayop Ka,140,20,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"but the more we maintain those tropes and stereotypes, the more we are to promote them in actual society which SHOULD NOT be the norm"
Hayop Ka,140,21,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We need more progressive stories to influence both the youth and adults
Hayop Ka,140,22,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The voice acting though needs a bit of work
Hayop Ka,140,23,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Also, well oof for some of the voice actors hhhhhhhh"
Hayop Ka,140,24,ghosteyes,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Anyway, I'd only recommend you to watch this film for the sake of supporting Filipino animators"
Hayop Ka,141,1,mikeybaketba,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,napangiti naman aq neto pinupuri ko yung mga animators ang gagaling pero nakakaumay na kasi na puro ganto nagiging takbo ng storya sa pilipinas
Hayop Ka,142,1,samuelramos,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,My cat can write a better story than this
Hayop Ka,142,2,samuelramos,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Good visuals though
Hayop Ka,143,1,oecix,2020-10-31 16:28:19.035,80.0,ltbx,"one star for the animators (the animation was DELICIOUS, seriously) and one star for angelica panganiban"
Hayop Ka,143,2,oecix,2020-10-31 16:28:19.035,80.0,ltbx,but ngl nasayang yung animation sa plot nung film
Hayop Ka,143,3,oecix,2020-10-31 16:28:19.035,80.0,ltbx,i really thought the hype was gonna be worth it but it wasnt :/
Hayop Ka,144,1,fruitbowl,2020-10-31 16:45:49.706,80.0,ltbx,"I have a strong, strong feeling they're gonna screen this during the next FurryPinas convention"
Hayop Ka,145,1,lance_christoff,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Excellent graphics however the narration is off-putting
Hayop Ka,146,1,iamphilsm,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Don't get deceived by its colorful and cute animation because this animated film was very sexual
Hayop Ka,146,2,iamphilsm,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Felt like the nice animation got wasted due to its bad story but this was funny though
Hayop Ka,146,3,iamphilsm,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Angelica Panganiban is a huge comedy talent
Hayop Ka,147,1,kandreamt,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The animation in itself is already a huge feat for this film (and , consequently, Philippine cinema) but the story doesn’t seem fully fleshed out"
Hayop Ka,147,2,kandreamt,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There were scenes where the voice acting fell short, particularly the confrontation scene between Nimfa and Roger— I couldn’t quite call it dialogue because it really just felt like they were alternating aggressive monologues (there is a difference I swear)Anyway, I think the film is suffering from such tedious reviews given the anticipation it garnered before its release"
Hayop Ka,147,3,kandreamt,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Everyone’s got their eyes on it and we want it to be good
Hayop Ka,147,4,kandreamt,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It was entertaining
Hayop Ka,148,1,callis213,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Really impressive voice acting performances and funny animal puns
Hayop Ka,148,2,callis213,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Also pretty interesting animation choices and styles
Hayop Ka,148,3,callis213,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Other than that, everything else is meh"
Hayop Ka,148,4,callis213,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,How I wish the story is more solid and has something bigger to say as the credits rolled
Hayop Ka,149,1,snapmare,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The art is STUNNING
Hayop Ka,149,2,snapmare,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Saturated kung saturated sa puns at visual gags
Hayop Ka,149,3,snapmare,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I feel like alam naman nating lahat na wala dapat tularang character sa movie na to (except si Jerry at si manong sa Batangas
Hayop Ka,149,4,snapmare,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"), plus the script of the movie itself"
Hayop Ka,149,5,snapmare,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's in the same vein as the ""nawawalang anak"" stereoype ng mga palabas"

Hayop Ka,149,7,snapmare,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's a sakto lang movie for me
Hayop Ka,149,8,snapmare,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Edit: docking a half-star kasi sana mas naghanap sila ng mas bagay na voice actors

Hayop Ka,150,1,coffeesnclosers,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,had high expectations for this since it would be a huge breakthrough for the animation industry here but no we just got bad va's and a somewhat rushed ending
Hayop Ka,150,2,coffeesnclosers,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,the animation itself is really pretty though so that's that
Hayop Ka,151,1,findingnorry,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It had so much potential

Hayop Ka,164,9,phantomess,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The characters were dumb with no redeeming qualities
Hayop Ka,164,10,phantomess,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I'm kind of bummed because this had so much potential to be good
Hayop Ka,164,11,phantomess,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I actually wanted to give this a 2-star but changed my mind because the animation was incredible
Hayop Ka,164,12,phantomess,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kudos to the Filipino animators
Hayop Ka,164,13,phantomess,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Overall, Hayop Ka"
Hayop Ka,164,14,phantomess,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,is pretty much an average film
Hayop Ka,164,15,phantomess,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I was so excited for this, but my expectations fell short"
Hayop Ka,164,16,phantomess,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's not that bad and it made me a laugh a bit, but there were several corny/cringey moments that I wanted to skip through"
Hayop Ka,164,17,phantomess,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even so, Filipino animation is looking really good so far"
Hayop Ka,165,1,adryengabriel,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,ganda ng animation T________T walang palya hng
Hayop Ka,166,1,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,"Oh boy, here we go"
Hayop Ka,166,2,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,"Mostly a thought vomit, so be warned"
Hayop Ka,166,3,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,"The visuals and animation are world-class, hands down"
Hayop Ka,166,4,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,But holy shit I wish they had a different script
Hayop Ka,166,5,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,The writing in itself is thematically flawed which would have been okay if it wasn't for the portrayal in itself
Hayop Ka,166,6,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,"I appreciate the efforts of the film for tackling certain issues such as the woes of the working class, contractualization, and such"
Hayop Ka,166,7,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,But who is this story for
Hayop Ka,166,8,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,Is it simply trying to portray the struggles of a modern working-class woman
Hayop Ka,166,9,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,Is this supposed to be a commentary for something bigger
Hayop Ka,166,10,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,Why does this film feel like it's an MMK episode with a high production value
Hayop Ka,166,11,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,"I discussed this film with my boyfriend, and we both agreed that perhaps the target audience of this film is the masses and the working class"
Hayop Ka,166,12,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,This is quite ironic because the film was released on Netflix (which caters to mostly the privileged people)
Hayop Ka,166,13,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,"Direction wise, boy I wish they hired professional VOs instead"
Hayop Ka,166,14,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,The film would have been more bearable
Hayop Ka,166,15,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,The surprising delight for me is Sam Milby's performance as a VO
Hayop Ka,166,16,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,He's the only competent performance in the film for me
Hayop Ka,166,17,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,My main beef with the film is that it’s a very well made film with an awful story that perpetuates the system it wants to critique in the first place
Hayop Ka,166,18,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,"Cheers, nonetheless to the hardworking artists behind this film"
Hayop Ka,166,19,maybeitsceline,2020-11-01 10:22:52.615,60.0,ltbx,And may they invest in better writers instead
Hayop Ka,167,1,ellescape,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,super ganda ng animation

Hayop Ka,180,1,dayneishere,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,the animation was so good but the topics were so romanticized when it shouldn't be in the first place
Hayop Ka,180,2,dayneishere,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,especially when it is already 2020

Hayop Ka,182,2,heysunkid,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"If it wasnt for the talent that these animators put in this movie, I probably would not have started on this at all"
Hayop Ka,182,3,heysunkid,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"The plot is representative of a good majority of Filipino films - classist, shallow, peddling mediocre mindsets all for the sake of comedy"
Hayop Ka,182,4,heysunkid,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"If you look back on the story and how it was executed, none of the characters have any redeeming character traits"
Hayop Ka,182,6,heysunkid,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Not even in the main character
Hayop Ka,182,7,heysunkid,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"And that's so fucking sad to me that they were all painted to be some shallow mockery of a person, without any thoughts or feelings for other people"
Hayop Ka,182,8,heysunkid,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,I love the Philippines but sometimes Philippine movies really suck
Hayop Ka,182,9,heysunkid,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"If someone, a better director or screenwriter, can hire these artists again to produce work that's meaningful and amusing and interesting, I would absolutely support the shit out of it"

Hayop Ka,183,2,ccsediaren,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"(lol)If you look past the outdated story (that doesn't really aim to give substance, I feel), this gets really hilariously Pinoy with in all its raunchy kasabawan, though I wish it could have been about something else instead"
Hayop Ka,183,3,ccsediaren,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The animation and sound are just top-notch, I'd watch it all over again just for that alone"
Hayop Ka,183,4,ccsediaren,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And plus points for all the genius animal puns scattered all throughout the story
Hayop Ka,184,1,lonelyhag,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,i wouldn't have finished this if the animation wasn't nice
Hayop Ka,184,2,lonelyhag,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,it had a really messy plot (+ furry porn
Hayop Ka,185,1,nikolavin,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Nice animations; unecessarily sexulized every single aspect of the story into a cheesy, sexist, and misogynistic clusterfuck"
Hayop Ka,186,1,treetoonein,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Story and the characters were a mess
Hayop Ka,186,2,treetoonein,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"But still, the animation is still something to admire about this movie"
Hayop Ka,186,3,treetoonein,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"So much attention to detail with the backgrounds too that in almost every scene, I wanted to read the animalised brand and establishment names"
Hayop Ka,186,4,treetoonein,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Btw, anyone catch what animal Jose Rizal was in this universe during the PetmaLuneta scene"

Hayop Ka,188,2,kleoamo,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,every single scene i was in awe of how detailed it is
Hayop Ka,188,3,kleoamo,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"how they captured ph culture, the puns, the exaggeration lack of 1 star because of misogynistic tones and the overly sexual scenes"
Hayop Ka,188,4,kleoamo,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i must admit there were jokes that made me laugh, there were scenes that i liked but i feel like i can excuse the stereotypical love triangle plot for how great the animation is"
Hayop Ka,188,5,kleoamo,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i feel like they had to do something the masses are familiar with to attract them to watching pinoy animation films
Hayop Ka,189,1,ratedgv,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,props to the animators
Hayop Ka,189,2,ratedgv,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,that’s all i’ve got to say
Hayop Ka,190,1,augenblick,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Even if this was probably intended to be satire, it wasn’t a very good one"
Hayop Ka,190,2,augenblick,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Instead of critiquing, it seemed to embrace misogyny, abuse, classism, and other societal ills that it tried to touch upon"
Hayop Ka,190,3,augenblick,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Similar to Rocket Sheep’s earlier production Saving Sally, the animation was just bogged down by"
Hayop Ka,190,4,augenblick,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,everything else
Hayop Ka,191,1,robitonin,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,1 star for animation

Hayop Ka,192,2,leampo,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,just support the movie for the animators
Hayop Ka,193,1,bluieen,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Frankly, the visuals is impressive and enjoyable"
Hayop Ka,193,2,bluieen,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,BUT progress on the animation department should not have the story as trade-off
Hayop Ka,193,3,bluieen,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Always, the story should be the driving force"

Hayop Ka,195,1,seventieshead,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i am only disappointed with the fact that this could've been much more class conscious with how many tongue-in-cheek moments it had regarding labor unions, class antagonisms, etc which surprised me coming from something on netflix"
Hayop Ka,195,2,seventieshead,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"seemed to be socially aware enough of telenovela tropes it tried to play off but not enough to subvert them to say something more meaningful, and i was definitely more invested in the world than any of the characters"
Hayop Ka,196,1,nomer123,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hayop ka is definitely offensive and vulgar but the lack of enthusiastic profanity and sustained laugh-to-gag ratio made the film flat and blasé
Hayop Ka,196,2,nomer123,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film has too mature content to be enjoyed by the youth and too immature to be enjoyed by adult audience
Hayop Ka,196,3,nomer123,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It feels like it was written by a group of high school students and produced by their rich parents
Hayop Ka,196,4,nomer123,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The animators did a splendid job

Hayop Ka,204,1,aksn_red,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"As much as the visuals aim to impress, this is a film that is boggled down by a lack of substance and sensitivity"
Hayop Ka,204,2,aksn_red,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It could have tackled important issues (as it was trying to do), but it fails and in doing so, becomes another forgettable film that feels like it only exists in order to show that Philippine animation is improving"
Hayop Ka,204,3,aksn_red,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Sadly, this film might have just pulled down those hopes instead"

Hayop Ka,207,1,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Rocketsheep Studios needs to stop hiring shitty writers

Hayop Ka,207,3,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"This movie is an amalgamation of everything familiar and stereotypical of an afternoon at a local TV channel: homewreckers, cheaters, exaggerated rich-poor conversations, and all the things regular viewers across the country seem to swoon over on the daily"
Hayop Ka,207,4,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The folks over at Rocketsheep seem to think that this makes for a passable idea in the animation department
Hayop Ka,207,5,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Did it work
Hayop Ka,207,7,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Do I like it
Hayop Ka,207,8,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,FUCK NO
Hayop Ka,207,9,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"If the goal of this cartoonish re-imagining of a soap opera is to drown it in cutely-drawn pastel-style animation interspersed with clear homages to GMA-7's Astig Authority (afternoon segments where international anime series are dubbed in Tagalog for local audiences), then congratulations, they're going to successfully hook in the support"
Hayop Ka,207,10,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,But to explicitly juxtapose this advocacy of creative animation with the morally replete narratives of your average Philippine soap is just deplorable
Hayop Ka,207,11,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"What they're doing here, is making a statement that the only way to somehow succeed and get more support from everyone is to just get what already works for the masses"
Hayop Ka,207,12,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,This isn't something I look forward to if the future of the industry is really dictated by the preposterous concept that is this movie
Hayop Ka,207,13,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Put it this way, the story can just as easily be inserted as a real-life adaptation in the hands of grubby network executives"
Hayop Ka,207,14,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"If independent studios like Rocketsheep are already behaving in the same manner when it comes to advocating the #SupportLocal mentality, then we have a big problem here"

Hayop Ka,207,18,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Jesus christ, none of the writers here can write for shit"
Hayop Ka,207,19,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The only way I found myself laughing here was when the animation took center stage over the story itself
Hayop Ka,207,20,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,which only happens when the film approaches the lewd and sleazy story developments that they're relying on
Hayop Ka,207,21,tuesjays,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Everything else was just an entire cringe-fest left and right
Hayop Ka,208,1,happikuy,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the controversy
Hayop Ka,208,2,happikuy,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the plot per se is very wattpad-ish, telenovela-ish, and full of cliches"
Hayop Ka,208,3,happikuy,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i detest as well how they sexualized the anthromorphic characters
Hayop Ka,208,4,happikuy,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the aspirations of this film are somewhat questionable—hoping they're aiming to really critique the depicted themes tho by satirical means
Hayop Ka,208,5,happikuy,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,also don't get me started at the problematic cast; i prefer professional voice actors more than them
Hayop Ka,208,6,happikuy,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"in spite all of these, this film's good animation doesn't genuinely deserve this problematic plot"

Hayop Ka,239,1,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,Let me get this straight first
Hayop Ka,239,2,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,"I haven't watched this movie, and the only way you'll make me see this movie is if my viewing of the movie will not support the movie in any way"
Hayop Ka,239,3,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,I'm writing this review right now to post my stance regarding this movie
Hayop Ka,239,4,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,"I am all for supporting local animation studios, but my support will never come in the form of blind support"
Hayop Ka,239,5,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,"We've already heard the stories and news everywhere of Robin Padilla being casted as a character in the movie and while I do not support Robin Padilla in any way, his casting isn't what doesn't sit right with me"
Hayop Ka,239,6,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,What doesn't sit right with me is the fact that Joyce Bernal is one of the producers of the film
Hayop Ka,239,7,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,"For the ill informed, Joyce Bernal is a D/D/S director who is the director behind all of D/utert/e's SONAs (among some other terrible movies that she's also directed)"
Hayop Ka,239,8,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,"Not only that, but Piolo Pascual is also a producer"
Hayop Ka,239,9,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,"While Piolo Pascual hasn't directly come out as a supporter of D/utert/e, he has previously worked with Joyce Bernal on a project in support of D/utert/e, and that makes him an enabler"
Hayop Ka,239,10,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,"So, we now have three D/D/S supporters/enablers involved with the movie"
Hayop Ka,239,11,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,THAT'S what doesn't sit right with me
Hayop Ka,239,12,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,Surely there are other producers or actors they could've approached
Hayop Ka,239,13,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,"I will never support the art or the creative works created by or produced/financed by supporters of this horrible administration and nor bootlickers who try to act ""apolitical"" despite being enablers themselves"
Hayop Ka,239,14,ajsurema,2020-11-04 13:48:28.464,,ltbx,"Again, I am for the support of the works of local animation studios, but should that support come blindly all in the name of ""support lokal"""

Hayop Ka,242,2,iamcjreyes,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Colloquialism at its finest - the script is relatable and funny, the narrative truly Filipino, and the visuals reminds us that this is made in our own country"
Hayop Ka,242,3,iamcjreyes,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I was about to comment on the cliché plot of adultery but decided not to ponder on it and just support this local product

Hayop Ka,243,28,primecruz,2020-11-04 21:05:39.562,100.0,ltbx,Yes lagi nalang mahirap/mayaman storyline but maybe there’s a reason why the boss-katulong trope(the powerful loving the powerless) works so well in our country
Hayop Ka,243,29,primecruz,2020-11-04 21:05:39.562,100.0,ltbx,Maybe it’s because most of us Filipinos still see that as the only means of escape
Hayop Ka,243,30,primecruz,2020-11-04 21:05:39.562,100.0,ltbx,"And hayop ka lays bare that truth: If you’re poor, falling in love out of economic need is very much a reality"

Hayop Ka,243,41,primecruz,2020-11-04 21:05:39.562,100.0,ltbx,-1 half star ulit for the ending with empoy the frog
Hayop Ka,243,42,primecruz,2020-11-04 21:05:39.562,100.0,ltbx,"I get that the film had to end on a somewhat lighthearted note, after it literally kicked rich prince charming out the window, mejo corny lang yung promo ng walang ka paris and laughter laughter"

Hayop Ka,246,2,bryllefajardo,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"is a tongue-in-cheek and provocative 2D animated film seen from the perspective of proletariat catwoman Nimfa Dimaano, as she finds herself slowly loosening her morals in desperate exchange of economic indemnity"
Hayop Ka,246,3,bryllefajardo,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film is deceptively simple, but functions intelligently to provide a scathing representation of the cyclical, problematic lives of the working class Filipino: their desensitisation to the methods they cling onto for their own economic benefit, the internalized sexist and especially misogynistic paradigm that remains hegemonic among both Filipino men and women, and how all this disturbingly becomes the mundanity of everyday life in a third-world country"
Hayop Ka,246,4,bryllefajardo,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Moreover, although the narrative might simply appear as an animated rehash of what has plagued local TV for years, it cleverly utilizes these teleserye tropes to construct a sociological examination on capitalism's destruction to society; more specifically, to the Filipinos that belong to the lower end of the social strata"

Hayop Ka,246,6,bryllefajardo,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Hence, the anthropomorphism of these animals becomes a clever display of how capitalism has made literal animals out of us— easily succumbing to carnal desires and almost devoid of empathy"

Hayop Ka,246,10,bryllefajardo,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Needless to say, Hayop Ka"
Hayop Ka,246,11,bryllefajardo,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"is up there thematically, and can even suffice to be the lovechild of two classics that eloquently critique capitalism: last year's Parasite, and 1962 Mexican film The Exterminating Angel"
Hayop Ka,246,12,bryllefajardo,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Definitely one of the year's best
Hayop Ka,247,1,erennoterin,2020-11-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,animation was really cool :// kaso yun nga ://
Hayop Ka,248,1,christhefeline,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"i liked this better than saving sally, but as much as i wanted to believe that the writers were self-aware enough to make a story that seems to poke fun at typical love triangle/adultery tropes in philippine cinema/telenovelas"
Hayop Ka,248,2,christhefeline,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,the pay-off of this film really broke that optimistic belief in me
Hayop Ka,248,3,christhefeline,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"the animation is better than saving sally though, so there's that"
Hayop Ka,249,1,zoemei,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"the credits sequence was more interesting than the actual movie :[ if this is meant to be satirical, man i really did NOT get that from the way this was written"
Hayop Ka,249,2,zoemei,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"as with many of the reviews on here i think the animation saved this, but it seems a little wasted on a script prioritizes punchlines over story"
Hayop Ka,250,1,dysfunctile,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"literally just an hour-long compilation of sex jokes superb visuals, absolutely shitty writing"
Hayop Ka,250,2,dysfunctile,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,it’s not even that the plot’s “overused” — nothing is ever truly original these days and a cliché story doesn’t automatically lead to a bad film my issue with this is that there’s no actual story
Hayop Ka,250,3,dysfunctile,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,it’s of a progression of random events happening in rapid succession
Hayop Ka,250,4,dysfunctile,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,the film featured several heavy topics (ie
Hayop Ka,250,5,dysfunctile,2020-11-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"poverty, infidelity, single & teenage motherhood) but none of them were properly explored, so…"
Hayop Ka,251,1,chazaiya,2020-11-06 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,this movie is so horny it's not even funny
Hayop Ka,252,1,emmancon,2020-11-06 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Typical story (which isn't bad by itself) but the jokes seems too far apart for me to enjoy the campiness of the movie
Hayop Ka,252,2,emmancon,2020-11-06 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Or maybe it's just because of Robin Padilla's voice which annoyed me
Hayop Ka,252,3,emmancon,2020-11-06 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In paper, he's a good pick (if you ignore his political views) since he's a good fit for the common macho Filipino"
Hayop Ka,252,4,emmancon,2020-11-06 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But I just can't help to shake the vibe that it's not coming from a place of humor when you hear his voice call a woman a pokpok because she slept with another man
Hayop Ka,252,5,emmancon,2020-11-06 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Overall experience is not really good but animation and the visual jokes gives it an extra star
Hayop Ka,253,1,jooolyooos,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Really, really good animation and I'm glad this is not copying any Japanese anime style"

Hayop Ka,255,2,kimberlyhart,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"i'm writing this four days after watching the movie and letting it sink in, and i'm sad thinking about how so many easter eggs and puns and poetry in a certain language get lost in translation"
Hayop Ka,255,3,kimberlyhart,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,you have to really speak the language and know the culture that shapes it to really get it and it does make you feel like you're missing out on a lot

Hayop Ka,260,3,awkwrdcinephile,2020-11-07 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"I'm impressed with the animation and aesthetics, though"
Hayop Ka,260,4,awkwrdcinephile,2020-11-07 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I think it's a step up from Saving Sally (2016)

Hayop Ka,263,8,pathcarcer,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Problematic ang plot and it can be better
Hayop Ka,264,1,gabbspitargue,2020-11-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Parodies and satires are meant to criticize and emphasize the problem of what it is copying

Hayop Ka,264,6,gabbspitargue,2020-11-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I was supposed to give it at least two stars because the background art was fun to look at and the animation had improved from the last animation of this studio that took a decade to finish

Hayop Ka,271,5,profkeating,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Or is it just a complete piece of trash poorly dressing up as a story

Hayop Ka,284,1,copadete,2020-11-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Telenovelas desensitized me to the point I enjoyed this film
Hayop Ka,284,2,copadete,2020-11-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Great Animation and background art, but the characters are just telenovela characters all over again, but this time it’s interesting cuz’ they’re FURRIES"

Hayop Ka,285,3,sukiyaki_,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Most people don't like the way it's satirical and say the plot was pretty bad but I guess if you grew up in the lower class life (like me) with Filipino telenovelas as a part of your everyday life and environment, everything about this film is actually really fucking funny"
Hayop Ka,285,4,sukiyaki_,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I love the dialogues and the way the voice fit the personality of the characters so well

Hayop Ka,285,6,sukiyaki_,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I'd say people might have not enjoyed the way it's satirical and funny because they might have not really experienced growing up in an environment where filipino telenovelas were the only tv shows you could watch
Hayop Ka,285,7,sukiyaki_,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I appreciate the film a lot

Hayop Ka,286,2,annikamariano,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And sad too
Hayop Ka,286,3,annikamariano,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I’m not saying it sucked
Hayop Ka,286,4,annikamariano,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But it could’ve been way better
Hayop Ka,286,5,annikamariano,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This film, and everything about it had so much potential, especially with the amount of people who were excited to watch it, before it was released"

Hayop Ka,287,3,nutmheg,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Story is typical
Hayop Ka,287,4,nutmheg,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s not a groundbreaking story but I think there are worse things out there
Hayop Ka,287,5,nutmheg,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I enjoy watching films that I really don’t need to think too hard for me to enjoy it
Hayop Ka,287,6,nutmheg,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The movie is pretty okay for me at first but is kind of like a train wreck by the end of it there and I don’t know whether I am satisfied or not
Hayop Ka,287,7,nutmheg,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Do I want to know more about what happens next
Hayop Ka,287,9,nutmheg,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maybe next time there is a big shot animation film it would be better

Hayop Ka,289,7,vulprick,2020-11-14 12:21:11.993,100.0,ltbx,"The ingrained stiffness of social mobility, how shaming of women persists and perpetuates, how children are perceived as living investments"

Hayop Ka,291,1,thatsilverguy,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While the animation is great and the animators deserve recognition, the film itself was a weird flipflop between plots and was a bit too fast or slow in some scenes"
Hayop Ka,291,2,thatsilverguy,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Despite being Filipino myself, I never cared for the telenovelas that were constantly on TV, so this film doesn’t really stick to me"
Hayop Ka,291,3,thatsilverguy,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, this could be the potential start of more original Filipino animations being produced, as well as animation as a whole being taken more seriously here in the Philippines"

Hayop Ka,292,6,ndrnzdr,2020-11-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I get that the whole thing was a satire on the Filipino teleserye, but eventually, you need to create characters we can root for"
Hayop Ka,292,7,ndrnzdr,2020-11-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"""Hayop Ka"" has no one to root for and everyone to despise"

Hayop Ka,292,12,ndrnzdr,2020-11-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"So no, don't boycott this film just because you disagree with its morals (it's not supposed to be for kids in the first place) or because it features a voice actor whose politics are against yours"
Hayop Ka,292,13,ndrnzdr,2020-11-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Animation in this country is still trying to get back on its feet and while there's a lot of story improvement that could be done in this film, it's a good start, nonetheless"

Hayop Ka,305,1,alexyoken,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The animation was really good (sans some awkward movement in some scenes), love the work when it comes to the character designs and especially the backgrounds as it really makes the movie's world shine I also got some cheap laughs from the random sexual jokes all throughout (sorry not sorry)thing is, none of the main cast of characters aren't good people by any means (except for the frog who tells corny jokes), and as a result, the story is just yikessI get it's a satire but u got to at least have brains and a heart either way, this movie's just meh, but I applaud the animators for pouring their hearts out, so 90% of the rating is bc of it[available in Netflix PH]"
Hayop Ka,306,1,ronpadilla,2020-11-17 09:22:40.630,100.0,ltbx,this animation film might set a boundary to the Philippine animation industry
Hayop Ka,306,2,ronpadilla,2020-11-17 09:22:40.630,100.0,ltbx,"each scene is greatly animated; it does resonate a huge sarcasm on the ""normal-soap-opera-ish"" story that keeps on repeating on the Philippine cinema"
Hayop Ka,306,3,ronpadilla,2020-11-17 09:22:40.630,100.0,ltbx,I do hope we get more animated films made locally
Hayop Ka,307,1,cocaconan,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Have waited for this film since one of its earliest teasers were out
Hayop Ka,307,2,cocaconan,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Got around to watch it this day with adjusted expectations considering the political climate (not only of the country but also the stance of the attached producers and a lead actor) and my personal view of the studio's previous effort Saving Sally (2016)
Hayop Ka,307,3,cocaconan,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It plays out as a telenovela/teleserye/soap opera with themes of infidelity
Hayop Ka,307,4,cocaconan,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The greatest standout is the animation and design even with a vague story in the background that is a lot more interesting than the main story (endo, abortion, labor strikes, etc"
Hayop Ka,307,5,cocaconan,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,") Which is kind of expected as the Philippines is one of the major places of outsourcing in a lot of known animated projects (film, video games, visual effects)"
Hayop Ka,307,6,cocaconan,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The voice acting is fine but could be better either with a good voice cast director or hiring the professional dubbers (which is also a rising industry here but lack of support and recognition over popular celebrities)
Hayop Ka,307,7,cocaconan,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The decision to make the cast anthropomorphic animals is likely to avoid an uncanny valley feeling
Hayop Ka,307,8,cocaconan,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Though I also saw it as playing with their strengths as one of the strengths of Saving Sally was its monster/creature designs
Hayop Ka,307,9,cocaconan,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Though it doesn't make a difference here if they did it with human figures anyway
Hayop Ka,307,10,cocaconan,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Anyway, I still would recommend to anyone to give this a chance especially for the work of the animators and other just as essential crew"
Hayop Ka,308,1,daftgorillaz,2020-11-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's a fun film but it has so many awkward moments
Hayop Ka,309,1,kateboats,2020-11-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Simple, charming, and funny"
Hayop Ka,309,2,kateboats,2020-11-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Support Filipino media
Hayop Ka,310,1,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"As always, pretty and commendable animation could never be saved by horrible storytelling, subpar voice acting and horrendous/tasteless jokes"
Hayop Ka,310,2,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,What was the point of making this film anyway
Hayop Ka,310,3,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,To prove that a romance between two cheaters could make an intriguing concept
Hayop Ka,310,4,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The narrative itself was already borderline predictable and it still managed to shit on itself, causing everything to go further downhill by the third act"
Hayop Ka,310,5,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Also, fuck whoever thought of making this film another misogynistic, classist, love-triangle adultery-is-a-must type of bullshit"
Hayop Ka,310,6,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I am genuinely SICK of these kinds of Filipino movies
Hayop Ka,310,7,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Kailangan talaga puro kabalbalan, kabastusan, kalandian, at pandaraya ang laman ng kwento para bumenta sa Pinoy"
Hayop Ka,310,8,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Tanginang mga ‘to
Hayop Ka,310,9,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Kayo ang patuloy na nagpapabobo sa Pilipinong manonood
Hayop Ka,310,10,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Add to that, this film has no proper conclusion"
Hayop Ka,310,11,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Nothing happens to any of the characters by the end of this trainwreck
Hayop Ka,310,12,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Hopeless and infuriating
Hayop Ka,310,13,shep_rod,2020-11-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"1 full star goes to all the animators, editors and sound designers who put in the REAL WORK for this film"
Hayop Ka,311,1,carizzajanine,2020-11-19 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,the artists who made this deserve a lot and they really deserve a story worth telling
Hayop Ka,312,1,jasonrcf,2020-11-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I really wanted to come out of this heaping praises on the film for its incisive social commentary and for its hilarious satire of the Filipino telenovela industry but instead I‘ve been left with the sinking feeling that I should have just read a book to bed instead
Hayop Ka,312,2,jasonrcf,2020-11-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I wasn’t a fan of Saving Sally either so maybe Avid Liongoren’s films are just not for me
Hayop Ka,312,3,jasonrcf,2020-11-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,In fact I just re-read my Saving Sally review from 4 years ago and realized that almost all my issues (and even what I enjoyed) with that one persist quite strongly for Hayop Ka
Hayop Ka,312,4,jasonrcf,2020-11-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,as well so I’ll just link that review here
Hayop Ka,313,1,sambaparade,2020-11-21 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Gorgeous animation doesn't necessarily have to come with mostly unsympathetic characters, but"

Hayop Ka,314,1,cinemareverie,2020-11-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Hahahaha, wala, inenjoy ko lang yun kacornyhan"

Hayop Ka,321,2,carpihoe,2020-11-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this movie proves that the local industry is more than capable of making a name for itself rather than just being outsourced by bigger international sharks in the industry
Hayop Ka,322,1,nomadikamata,2020-11-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,ang galing ng animation bwakanang shet kaso sayang yung narrative - nag-empower lang ito ng patriarchy

Hayop Ka,346,1,jazzaberilla,2020-12-15 08:40:51.583,100.0,ltbx,animation is superbbbb
Hayop Ka,346,2,jazzaberilla,2020-12-15 08:40:51.583,100.0,ltbx,I don't get the hate about this film
Hayop Ka,346,3,jazzaberilla,2020-12-15 08:40:51.583,100.0,ltbx,The plot may be the usual Pinoy drama plot but Nimfa got what she deserved in the ending
Hayop Ka,347,1,narniascat,2020-12-19 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"it had some funny lines, but overall, it’s eh"
Hayop Ka,347,2,narniascat,2020-12-19 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,the plot is kinda messy
Hayop Ka,347,3,narniascat,2020-12-19 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,liked the animation tho
Hayop Ka,348,1,cinemawebb,2020-12-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This was a weird one
Hayop Ka,348,2,cinemawebb,2020-12-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Who is the target audience of this
Hayop Ka,348,3,cinemawebb,2020-12-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"It’s supposed to be adult, but that’s mostly in the form of a bunch of dick jokes"
Hayop Ka,348,4,cinemawebb,2020-12-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The romantic love triangle made me think the target audience was women, but it gets awfully preachy near the end"
Hayop Ka,348,5,cinemawebb,2020-12-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"But the setting is novel and its short, so it has that going for it"
Hayop Ka,349,1,jaijaibinkss,2020-12-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the animation and art style the plot and the voice acting
Hayop Ka,350,1,semi_joatmon,2020-12-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,im giving it 4 stars for the animation bc the artists dont deserve this 2
Hayop Ka,350,2,semi_joatmon,2020-12-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,5-star average
Hayop Ka,351,1,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"You have no idea the effort I put in to actually watch this, and I can't really recommend it to anybody else - an animated film with spot-on Cartoon Network aesthetics, relentless sex jokes, and a setting (Metro Manila) where I spent a lot of my formative years"
Hayop Ka,351,2,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Clearly, this work was calling me"
Hayop Ka,351,3,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,So let me make this plain: this film's sexual and gender politics are - put charitably - regressive
Hayop Ka,351,4,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The humor is largely juvenile, with not a single innuendo left unsaid"
Hayop Ka,351,5,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,And the story is propelled by thoroughly unlikable characters
Hayop Ka,351,7,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I was ultimately entertained
Hayop Ka,351,8,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"A large part of that was just pure nostalgia for the Phillipines, getting to see all signifiers I remembered (The Supermall"
Hayop Ka,351,10,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,") and several I forgot (the wire mesh displays for drinks, holy shit"
Hayop Ka,351,11,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,") The animation and design are lovely, but are helped by some truly genius visual comedy and meme references"
Hayop Ka,351,12,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"And for as selfish as our protagonists are, I thought their motives made sense"
Hayop Ka,351,13,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The story may go full soap opera, but at least it's never boring"
Hayop Ka,351,14,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"From what I've seen on Letterboxd, most of the reviews compliment the film's look but criticize it for perpetuating tropes of clasism and misogyny that are apparently well-represented in Filipino media"
Hayop Ka,351,15,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"For all the time I spent living there, I never really watched much that was locally made, and am only vaguely familiar with the craziness that has been going on with the current government"
Hayop Ka,351,16,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"As a piece of satire, I thought this worked"
Hayop Ka,351,17,gem37,2020-12-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"But, I'm also not the smartest guy I know"
Hayop Ka,352,1,polarizedfilms,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The animation and voice acting (tho I hate robin in this he does an ok job ig) is a very good one but the plot is written very poorly
Hayop Ka,352,2,polarizedfilms,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I was expecting something good Kasi the visuals are really fine ://
Hayop Ka,353,1,monicacanlas,2020-12-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,(Oplan: Rate the Filipino Movies available in Netflix)I want more of this
Hayop Ka,354,1,maxthemovieguy,2020-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,thank you but no thank you
Hayop Ka,355,1,hope13,2020-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,sayang naman ung animation kung ganito istorya
Hayop Ka,356,2,mamaru,2020-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,5/5 stars for the animation only
Hayop Ka,357,1,jamiegamboa,2020-12-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,y’all r so mean
Hayop Ka,358,1,andreaferma,2020-12-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Letterboxd and Twitter people hate this so much haha but this is a work of art - from the animation down to the simple and obviously satirical story
Hayop Ka,358,2,andreaferma,2020-12-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Loved every minute of it
Hayop Ka,359,1,sheerioo,2021-01-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I was really drawn to it as soon as it entered the first scene
Hayop Ka,359,2,sheerioo,2021-01-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A typical dilemma that was interpreted with an unusual style
Hayop Ka,359,3,sheerioo,2021-01-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I would understand that animation may not be one of those we see from Disney and Pixar
Hayop Ka,359,4,sheerioo,2021-01-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But the cinematography and the humor was fantastic
Hayop Ka,359,5,sheerioo,2021-01-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I really love it
Hayop Ka,359,6,sheerioo,2021-01-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I will give this 9
Hayop Ka,360,1,geldof,2020-11-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,My love for Angelica is probably the reason why I watched this in the first place
Hayop Ka,360,2,geldof,2020-11-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,She’s her usual self which I admire and the animation was promising
Hayop Ka,360,3,geldof,2020-11-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,But the story is such a mess
Hayop Ka,360,4,geldof,2020-11-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Just no
Hayop Ka,361,1,throughnelyt,2021-01-03 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"the animation is good, the story is not"
Hayop Ka,361,2,throughnelyt,2021-01-03 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"lame, typical, unrealistic"
Hayop Ka,361,3,throughnelyt,2021-01-03 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"it was typically for adults because of sensitive scenes but storywise, can't find its relevance"
Hayop Ka,362,1,percosadt,2021-01-03 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,putangina talaga
Hayop Ka,362,2,percosadt,2021-01-03 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,TANGINA TALAGA
Hayop Ka,362,3,percosadt,2021-01-03 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,ano 'to
Hayop Ka,363,1,icefernando,2021-01-03 15:43:27.101,100.0,ltbx,watch it for the visual ok
Hayop Ka,364,1,tonttegonzaga,2021-01-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Funny siya
Hayop Ka,364,2,tonttegonzaga,2021-01-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,May times na medyo unrealistic yung reaction characters pero di naman ako nabother kasi may pagkasatire din yung film
Hayop Ka,364,3,tonttegonzaga,2021-01-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Flawed yung characters at may times na di sila tama pero naiintindihan ko na may ganun talagang mga tao na mag-isipGusto ko yung naging ending kaso kung ako yung nasa posisyon ni Nimfa, sasagarin ko na yung pagiging social climber ko"
Hayop Ka,364,4,tonttegonzaga,2021-01-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Mabait naman at di mapagmata nanay ni Inigo eh
Hayop Ka,364,5,tonttegonzaga,2021-01-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sam and Piolo best voice performers for me
Hayop Ka,364,6,tonttegonzaga,2021-01-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Di ko akalain na si Piolo yun
Hayop Ka,365,1,mistanglawin,2021-01-07 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Such a waste of talented animators
Hayop Ka,365,2,mistanglawin,2021-01-07 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"This doesn't deserve a long review, as it already wasted an hour of my life"
Hayop Ka,365,3,mistanglawin,2021-01-07 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,This ruined my day
Hayop Ka,366,1,friendlikeme93,2021-01-11 01:09:22.758,40.0,ltbx,"The animation can be really nice in some scenes, but the rest of this movie is a hot mess"
Hayop Ka,368,1,not_am,2021-01-11 20:27:03.566,100.0,ltbx,Great animation and overall illustrations
Hayop Ka,368,2,not_am,2021-01-11 20:27:03.566,100.0,ltbx,Hate the cheating plotline
Hayop Ka,369,1,kruwie,2021-01-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"looking forward to more Filipino animated movies, hopefully with better plots"
Hayop Ka,370,1,nico_quejano,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Admittedly, there was avoidance on my end to support this movie because of the Duterte enablers that the producers are"
Hayop Ka,370,2,nico_quejano,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But i had to watch it to catch up on some Filipino films
Hayop Ka,370,3,nico_quejano,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And it turns out to be one the funniest comedies i have seen coming from this side of Asia
Hayop Ka,370,4,nico_quejano,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Reminded me a bit of Booba
Hayop Ka,370,5,nico_quejano,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"After reading a lot of the reviews calling the film misogynystic, i had to reassess my own reading, and although i understand where people are coming from, i disagree"
Hayop Ka,370,6,nico_quejano,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Nimfa was a strong woman in touch with her femininity and her own sexuality, she has ambitions and the choices she made was for herself"
Hayop Ka,370,7,nico_quejano,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Although that radio DJ was really spouting chauvinistic things, i thought it was established by the movie that the radio program was misogynystic"
Hayop Ka,370,8,nico_quejano,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"(As a person who had to endure THAT radio program during my cab rides, i agree with that sentiment"
Hayop Ka,370,9,nico_quejano,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,") Besides, she was awarded her own agency at the end"
Hayop Ka,370,10,nico_quejano,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They didn't make her settle (for money) or beg (forgiveness)
Hayop Ka,370,11,nico_quejano,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She didn't need saving
Hayop Ka,371,1,archeraguilar,2021-01-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Gorgeous animation that shows the ugliness of Philippine culture
Hayop Ka,372,1,kysh27,2021-01-15 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I'd choose Sam Milby over Robin Padilla anyday duh
Hayop Ka,373,1,notmariecurie,2020-12-19 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"these stars are just for the animation which was really good, but as soon as i heard robin padilla's voice, i started to doubt"
Hayop Ka,373,2,notmariecurie,2020-12-19 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,bc why hire the guy lol
Hayop Ka,373,3,notmariecurie,2020-12-19 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,then the rest of the story unfolded :(
Hayop Ka,374,1,candynams,2021-01-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Animations are really good
Hayop Ka,374,2,candynams,2021-01-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The plot isn’t as complex though
Hayop Ka,374,3,candynams,2021-01-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I expected more
Hayop Ka,375,1,jimmygreen1998,2021-01-16 20:49:48.447,,ltbx,Why am I not shocked with Netflix catering to furries now
Hayop Ka,376,1,tedpacis,2021-01-23 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The discourse of this movie really had potential beyond the superficial presentation of sexual and comic Filipino tropes, but still got buried by it"
Hayop Ka,376,2,tedpacis,2021-01-23 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"I still enjoyed it for what it had, I suppose"
Hayop Ka,377,1,theofrese,2021-01-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the voice acting is starting to get on my nerves
Hayop Ka,378,1,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Getting back to the r/letterboxd Film Raffle after my 6 month hiatus with this wild recommendation from Antoine
Hayop Ka,378,2,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I also get to add one more country to My Cinematic TravelsI actually really liked this and even if I hadn’t I would still appreciate how the film raffle gave me the chance to see it
Hayop Ka,378,3,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I can guarantee I would have never seeked out a Filipino adult animated furry film on my own
Hayop Ka,378,4,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The animation is fantastic
Hayop Ka,378,5,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I absolutely loved the style, effects and great attention to detail and really appreciate the effort that must have gone into making it"
Hayop Ka,378,6,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is even more impressive considering it’s from a country that isn’t known for its animated works or even live-action film industry really
Hayop Ka,378,7,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I enjoyed the humour a lot, both the dark comedy and the immature dirty jokes"
Hayop Ka,378,8,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Comedy is universal, but I’m sure it would have been funnier to people who speak the language and can relate to the culture"
Hayop Ka,378,9,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Or they could have hated it much more judging by all the very low ratings on Letterboxd
Hayop Ka,378,10,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They seem to be judging this for the presence of some questionable names in the cast/crew and for being misogynist and encouraging toxic behaviour
Hayop Ka,378,11,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I obviously can’t speak for the former, but to me this very much seemed like a satire poking fun at toxic masculinity rather than trying to encourage it"
Hayop Ka,378,12,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It also seemed to have some surface level commentary on class and how love is sometimes a luxury only the rich can afford
Hayop Ka,378,13,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I didn’t feel like it had something whether the actions of Nimfa, Roger and Inago were justified nor did they seem to want the audience to make up their mind"
Hayop Ka,378,14,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This is obviously much less concerned with sending a message than with making a funny piece of entertainment, and I was certainly very entertained"
Hayop Ka,378,15,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The ending was the only part I didn’t enjoy and it seemed totally inconsistent with the rest
Hayop Ka,378,16,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I don’t have much more to say other than warn everyone about Netflix’s evil furry agenda
Hayop Ka,378,17,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Furries are degenerates that must be combatted at all costs (/s
Hayop Ka,378,18,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I think) and yet Netflix continues to promote the likes of this and shows like Beastars
Hayop Ka,378,19,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and they even have the audacity to be pretty good
Hayop Ka,378,20,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s interesting how the language spoken is a mixture of English and Tagalog which does happen in certain segments of Egyptian society but not to this extent
Hayop Ka,378,21,mithras_,2021-01-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Is this how the average person from the Philippines speaks or is it another level of satire
Hayop Ka,379,1,nikkinique,2021-01-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I don't care much for the story/plot but only giving it 3 stars for the quality of the animation
Hayop Ka,379,2,nikkinique,2021-01-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Gotta give it to our local animators
Hayop Ka,381,1,ourange,2021-01-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The animations are very lovely but the message isn't delivered thoroughly for me
Hayop Ka,382,1,claud_,2021-01-29 17:32:59.653,80.0,ltbx,i liked the animation
Hayop Ka,382,2,claud_,2021-01-29 17:32:59.653,80.0,ltbx,just the animation though
Hayop Ka,382,3,claud_,2021-01-29 17:32:59.653,80.0,ltbx,the fact that it's a satire film doesn't work for me
Hayop Ka,383,1,doublecakes,2021-01-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Although the story lacked anything of subtext and the plot was overdramatic, the film is elevated with great animation and nice character designs"
Hayop Ka,383,2,doublecakes,2021-01-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I like the film's aesthetic, but the comedy didn't do much for me"
Hayop Ka,383,3,doublecakes,2021-01-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film also had the right amount of raunch; it's horny in a fun way and not a gross way
Hayop Ka,384,1,donsimeoniv,2020-11-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It's like a flower vase; beautiful and elegant on the outside but hollow and devoid of content on the inside
Hayop Ka,385,1,ramona_willow,2021-02-05 12:20:43.654,60.0,ltbx,I apologize for hyping this film up the way I did

Hayop Ka,386,3,notselina,2021-02-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The story is surprisingly empowering but at the same time bittersweet
Hayop Ka,387,1,mimsymoon,2021-02-06 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"there are witty little details and the animation is excellent, but i had to turn it off halfway, sorry"

Hayop Ka,388,2,fwalsh,2021-02-11 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The pacing was weird in some places but it was still enjoyable
Hayop Ka,388,3,fwalsh,2021-02-11 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The designs are really cute too
Hayop Ka,388,4,fwalsh,2021-02-11 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Also this movie is like,,, RIDDLED with memes in the backgrounds"

Hayop Ka,389,1,21reelbinders,2021-02-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The story is just average
Hayop Ka,389,2,21reelbinders,2021-02-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The animation is great showcase of what pinoy animation prod can do
Hayop Ka,390,1,lecros49,2021-02-16 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,This wasn't really for me
Hayop Ka,390,2,lecros49,2021-02-16 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The plot and characters were unlikeable (especially Nimfa)
Hayop Ka,390,3,lecros49,2021-02-16 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The animation style was excellent however, I only wish the Filipino animators get a chance to use their skill on a better screenplay in the future"
Hayop Ka,391,1,snoopysuho,2021-02-21 02:31:31.063,80.0,ltbx,kudos to the animators for creating a visual treat
Hayop Ka,391,2,snoopysuho,2021-02-21 02:31:31.063,80.0,ltbx,i just wish the same level of care was given to the story
Hayop Ka,392,1,clintlock,2021-02-24 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"While the overall design of the film is consistently engaging, colorful, and surprisingly textured, the film is let-down severely by an awkward, unfunny script"
Hayop Ka,392,2,clintlock,2021-02-24 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Much like most ""adult animation"" where adult actually translates to ""immature,"" the film is beside itself with forced, silly sex puns that land with a thud in conversations between barely developed characters"
Hayop Ka,392,3,clintlock,2021-02-24 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Our protagonist pursues an affair for some reason (unfulfilled life with her loving long-term boyfriend, impulsivity, take your pick) and because she is so underwritten and flat we never know nor care when her decisions come back to hurt her"
Hayop Ka,392,4,clintlock,2021-02-24 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"And besides, her entire arc is only an excuse to force in some bland titillation and more high school level sex jokes into this already barren narrative"
Hayop Ka,393,1,diego_jt,2021-02-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Es como una comedia romántica estúpida, algo más sexual, con los clichés del triángulo amoroso, el tema de la diferencia de clases, y una protagonista insufrible y odiosa, que se porta mal con todo el mundo"
Hayop Ka,393,2,diego_jt,2021-02-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Lo único que reivindico es la animación, para ser de Filipinas han hecho un buen trabajo, y el tema de los cambios entre el inglés y el filipino es cuanto menos curioso"
Hayop Ka,393,3,diego_jt,2021-02-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Pero la película es malísima, y bastante tóxica y cliché"

Hayop Ka,398,1,burgitoes,2021-03-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I mean, it’s not that explicit as most mature cartoons in America"
Hayop Ka,398,2,burgitoes,2021-03-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is more so like a tame and less depressing Bojack Horseman made in the Philippines

Hayop Ka,400,2,akahana_21,2021-03-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Only thing that kept me going are the animation, effort of the whole cast and crew, and hope that the ending would be somewhat decent"

Hayop Ka,403,1,reenactment,2021-04-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Animation deserved better than this story
Hayop Ka,404,1,davoarid,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Yep, an animated comedy for adults released straight to Filipino Netflix"
Hayop Ka,404,2,davoarid,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,This was roughly equal in quality to that SING movie Illumination made a few years ago
Hayop Ka,404,3,davoarid,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,They don't do anything clever with the animals
Hayop Ka,404,4,davoarid,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It's like each character was assigned to a different animal *at random*
Hayop Ka,404,5,davoarid,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I hate that
Hayop Ka,404,6,davoarid,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Oh yeah, and also none of the jokes are funny, but, ya know, that's to be expected"

Hayop Ka,406,2,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And my god is this film sexually charged
Hayop Ka,406,3,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Like, I knew going in that it was a soap opera-esque love triangle type thing that very much took advantage of appealing to adults, but man I didn't expect it to go like it did"
Hayop Ka,406,4,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The pacing is alllllllll over the place, and a lot of tensions in the film don't get resolved"
Hayop Ka,406,5,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Despite that though
Hayop Ka,406,6,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's actually kind of nice
Hayop Ka,406,7,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I dunno if I'd watch it again, but overall, I'm glad I watched it"
Hayop Ka,406,8,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Nimfa, the main character, is a bit unlikable at times -- she's unfaithful as hell and has some priorities a bit mixed, and can be somewhat hypocritical at times -- but the entire cast is flawed in some form"
Hayop Ka,406,9,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's very grounded in that sense, and she's not above growing"
Hayop Ka,406,10,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her two love interests are similar
Hayop Ka,406,11,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Roger, he's rough around the edges, but overall is a nice dude"
Hayop Ka,406,12,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"albeit with a temper, and real poor money management skills"
Hayop Ka,406,13,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Iñigo is the other -- a tried and true stereotypical businessman type, slinging deals and reveling in his riches"
Hayop Ka,406,14,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Overall a nice dude, though very much enjoys all the whims his life offers"
Hayop Ka,406,15,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"If you don't like soapy drama or heavily sexually charged energy (my god), it wouldn't be for you, but it is BEAUTIFULLY animated"
Hayop Ka,406,16,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The style is distinct and very nice to look at, and it has gorgeous fight scenes, of all things"
Hayop Ka,406,17,themilliemania,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"If interest is relatively piqued, I'd say find a way to watch it, it's worth at the very least it's runtime"
Hayop Ka,407,1,loobadomidoo,2021-04-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Imma bring this movie’s ratings UP with my 5
Hayop Ka,408,1,grey_the_dot,2021-04-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is a hard one
Hayop Ka,408,2,grey_the_dot,2021-04-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I obviously love the animation but found the story insufferable
Hayop Ka,408,3,grey_the_dot,2021-04-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Everybody is a terrible person in this movie
Hayop Ka,408,4,grey_the_dot,2021-04-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Strangely they're not terrible people in a villainous bad guy movie kinda way but in a normal regular people making bad decisions kinda way
Hayop Ka,408,5,grey_the_dot,2021-04-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The conflict is driven by the characters indulging in their worst instincts that they know will not turn out well but they do so anyway because of the thrill and it is very much not fun to watch
Hayop Ka,408,6,grey_the_dot,2021-04-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Then you have the animation that makes all this tolerable
Hayop Ka,408,7,grey_the_dot,2021-04-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The animation isn't always a good thing
Hayop Ka,408,8,grey_the_dot,2021-04-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"A special mention must be made of the first sex scene between Nimfa and Inigo where they're drawn super detailed but they still keep their geometric cartoon shapes, it was so unsexy that I think my penis shrunk"
Hayop Ka,409,1,lisztomenia,2021-04-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,sayang (37)
Hayop Ka,410,1,glb,2021-05-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this sure was a movie
Hayop Ka,410,2,glb,2021-05-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i liked jerry and all the background/scenery art
Hayop Ka,411,1,diremopery,2021-05-13 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Have to say that I really like the design of this, especially with the scene settings and the cute ass animations like stars when there was a fight"
Hayop Ka,411,2,diremopery,2021-05-13 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"But c'mon, this was a crusty-poo wattpad-traditional storyline"
Hayop Ka,411,3,diremopery,2021-05-13 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It is in line with the typical pinoy drama— poor girl + rich man, sexism and adultery"
Hayop Ka,411,4,diremopery,2021-05-13 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Had me cringing half the time but it makes sense with the cast of this film
Hayop Ka,411,5,diremopery,2021-05-13 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,overall a painful experience and I should have known better
Hayop Ka,412,1,nathanaelmonte,2021-04-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"woah, loved the animation like wala akong masabi"

Hayop Ka,412,3,nathanaelmonte,2021-04-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,pero bakit masyadong problematic yung story
Hayop Ka,413,1,marbenp,2021-05-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We need more Filipino Animated movies with visuals on this level
Hayop Ka,413,2,marbenp,2021-05-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Pero sana okay yung story sa next time na yun
Hayop Ka,414,1,distantdreams,2021-05-26 07:14:28.154,100.0,ltbx,Actually enjoyed this movie a lot
Hayop Ka,414,2,distantdreams,2021-05-26 07:14:28.154,100.0,ltbx,"Not something to take very seriously at all, just be there for humour and ridiculousness"
Hayop Ka,414,3,distantdreams,2021-05-26 07:14:28.154,100.0,ltbx,Characters are all flawed in some way or another (‘cept for Larry
Hayop Ka,414,4,distantdreams,2021-05-26 07:14:28.154,100.0,ltbx,) Was in a blue funk for a while and this brought me right out of it
Hayop Ka,414,5,distantdreams,2021-05-26 07:14:28.154,100.0,ltbx,Great daytime movie over lunch
Hayop Ka,414,6,distantdreams,2021-05-26 07:14:28.154,100.0,ltbx,"Story could have done with some work, especially with character development and themes, but still felt enjoyable"
Hayop Ka,414,7,distantdreams,2021-05-26 07:14:28.154,100.0,ltbx,"Not a perfect movie, but a enjoyable one I’d say"
Hayop Ka,415,1,aicawastaken,2021-05-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"i really wanted to like this film, but i was only left with disappointment"
Hayop Ka,415,2,aicawastaken,2021-05-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,hire better writers
Hayop Ka,416,1,devillaeon,2021-06-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,funny but wtf
Hayop Ka,417,1,chelsonduty,2021-06-08 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Zootopia but make it wasak
Hayop Ka,417,2,chelsonduty,2021-06-08 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The rating is for the animation alone
Hayop Ka,417,3,chelsonduty,2021-06-08 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,'Yun lang talaga nagdala
Hayop Ka,417,4,chelsonduty,2021-06-08 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The jokes are very Pinoy, the story could've been better pero too much to ask for na siguro lalo kung may hayop sa cast sa totoong buhay"
Hayop Ka,418,1,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This movie stinks
Hayop Ka,418,2,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"First off, the animation is goddamn gorgeous"
Hayop Ka,418,3,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It’s really good and it’s something I honestly didn’t expect going into this movie
Hayop Ka,418,4,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It’s clear to me that everyone in the animation department for this movie just let loose and went bananas with charm and colors that pop
Hayop Ka,418,5,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"It creatively welcomes the audience and allows them to find delight in a world where people are, in essence, human-animal hybrids without them reeling back and thinking “wtf are these human-animal hybrids”I didn’t think about this until the very end of the movie, but secondly, the voice acting was also surprisingly decent in my opinion"
Hayop Ka,418,6,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Something I also did not expect
Hayop Ka,418,7,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The dialogue felt organic because of that, and because the lines were never dry nor dull"
Hayop Ka,418,8,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, that’s everything good about this movie"
Hayop Ka,418,9,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"I see this film as another dished-out entry in the Filipino film industry, as nothing sets it apart from other films of said industry (apart from the animation)"
Hayop Ka,418,10,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"It doesn’t bring anything new to the table plot-wise, since everything that’s been done here feels like, no wait, IS something that’s been done by so many other goddamn movies (albeit in a lighter tone) I can’t even begin to count"
Hayop Ka,418,11,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"I just think this: if we strip this movie of the obviously gorgeous animation, if we take out the witty/funny lines, the voice acting, the editing, if we just leave the plot all on its own, will it still be able to stand all by itself"
Hayop Ka,418,12,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"To me, the answer is a big fat no"
Hayop Ka,418,13,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"It isn’t a very good story in my opinion, and as I’ve said, this is in essence a movie with themes and elements that are in many other Filipino movies, executed and presented almost exactly the same way most of the time"
Hayop Ka,418,14,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"You don’t have to look or try very hard to find hit-or-miss jokes, cheesy lines, and bad writing along with classism, misogyny, and adultery among other things as themes in other Filipino films/series"
Hayop Ka,418,15,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Also there are times when, weirdly, the movie kind of asks the audience to take a certain scene or moment seriously, but then it wusses out and overshadows said moments with *funny action scene"
Hayop Ka,418,16,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"*, stopping anyone from caring about our protagonist’s worries, doubts, and hurt"
Hayop Ka,418,17,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It could not commit to a pause just a while to let us feel and instead convinces itself that *funny action scene
Hayop Ka,418,18,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,* is necessary to maintain attention

Hayop Ka,418,21,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I just find it odd how some people who did enjoy this movie go out of their way and say “Oh yeah

Hayop Ka,418,28,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,okay let’s talk about this for a bit
Hayop Ka,418,29,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Firstly, in my opinion, if it was really satire then it still didn’t do a very good job"
Hayop Ka,418,30,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"At no point did the movie mock the themes and elements it was said to make fun of, nor did it make a point that it was indeed satirical, subtle or otherwise, like a satire would do"
Hayop Ka,418,31,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It was just doing it’s own thing without……
Hayop Ka,418,33,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"If that’s the case, then it’s just a regular Filipino screenplay with a “satire” sticker slapped onto it"
Hayop Ka,418,34,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Secondly, I find it weird when people say “What did you expect"
Hayop Ka,418,37,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"” as if it’s okay to stay in a box contented, conforming to the usual formula without experimenting, venturing out or aspiring to have as strong an emotional connection and impact with the audience as Disney/Pixar movies"
Hayop Ka,418,38,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This is not to say it SHOULD BE Disney/Pixar
Hayop Ka,418,39,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"I’m just saying any piece of art isn’t worth much if it isn’t the best it could be, if it never went the distance, if it never evolves and adapts"
Hayop Ka,418,40,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,That’s my two cents
Hayop Ka,418,41,abrealad,2021-06-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Great animation, lackluster story"

Hayop Ka,442,3,thatshelf,2021-08-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,First: the film is inspired by popular Filipino telenovelas
Hayop Ka,442,4,thatshelf,2021-08-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,These beloved soap operas usually feature characters who scream “Hayop Ka
Hayop Ka,442,5,thatshelf,2021-08-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,",” which translate to “You Animal"
Hayop Ka,442,6,thatshelf,2021-08-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"” or “You Son of a B****”, in the height of conflict"
Hayop Ka,442,7,thatshelf,2021-08-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The fact that the central figures in director Avid Liongoren’s cheeky animated comedy are, in fact, animals should tell you what type of film you are watching"
Hayop Ka,442,8,thatshelf,2021-08-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The second thing to note is that shock jock radio hosts have increasingly become surrogate therapists for those who lack the funds to get professional advice
Hayop Ka,442,9,thatshelf,2021-08-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,This is a double-edged sword though as the hosts usually turn the caller’s personal hardships into humiliating spectacles for ratings
Hayop Ka,442,10,thatshelf,2021-08-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"While this unfair trial by public opinion appears in the later sections of the film, Hayop Ka"

Hayop Ka,453,2,justrlo,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The type of film I'm uncertain to dive in- but here we are
Hayop Ka,453,3,justrlo,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The animated flick is definitely new and fresh for Filipino viewers but the themes and plot are very familiar
Hayop Ka,453,4,justrlo,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is a staple contribution to the animation industry here in the country since it's the first animated film to be launched in Netflix worldwide
Hayop Ka,453,5,justrlo,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Rocketsheep Studio did their homework and polished their art
Hayop Ka,453,6,justrlo,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The world is very well done and with closer inspection, it's full of easter eggs inspired from different films"
Hayop Ka,453,7,justrlo,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Additionally, the animation was solid like it came off from a western film"
Hayop Ka,453,8,justrlo,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film itself is good and definitely worth checking out
Hayop Ka,453,9,justrlo,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I can't wait for more animated films to be recognized in the platform made by Filipinos

Hayop Ka,455,1,lumpyknees,2021-09-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Just watching this to show my support for the burgeoning Filipino animation industry
Hayop Ka,455,2,lumpyknees,2021-09-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,No other reason
Hayop Ka,456,1,miserame,2020-11-11 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The plot was nothing too special
Hayop Ka,456,2,miserame,2020-11-11 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, they did a pretty good job with animation and visuals so props to them"
Hayop Ka,457,1,disappointment,2021-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Review by Sean Boelman
Hayop Ka,457,2,disappointment,2021-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hayop Ka
Hayop Ka,457,3,disappointment,2021-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The Nimfa Dimaano Story is an excellent reminder of the tremendous potential that independent adult animation has
Hayop Ka,457,4,disappointment,2021-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"A hilarious soap opera parody, the film doesn’t aim for the low-hanging fruit in poking fun at one of the lowest art forms there is"
Hayop Ka,457,5,disappointment,2021-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But the real success of the film is the way in which it creates a genuine emotional connection to these characters
Hayop Ka,457,6,disappointment,2021-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even though it’s obviously melodramatic (on purpose), the genuine heart in the film is absolutely charming and unexpected"
Hayop Ka,457,7,disappointment,2021-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,MORE FANTASIA THOUGHTS HERE
Hayop Ka,458,1,rodvillafuerte,2021-09-04 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The ending feels like more a consolation rather than an actual reaolution
Hayop Ka,458,2,rodvillafuerte,2021-09-04 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It could give hope but it could also be another impending tragedy
Hayop Ka,459,1,alexwfinch,2021-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Filipino animation about a bunch of horny animals, where cat Nimfa is dating macho dog Roger, but then a rich wolf comes along and she wants to fuck him instead"
Hayop Ka,459,2,alexwfinch,2021-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The animation is impressive and there's some okay background jokes, but many are very similar to those in Bojack Horseman and this pales in comparison, with the characters being far less appealing and amusing, and some acts of violence (Nimfa repeatedly hitting her sister when she finds out she's a…"
Hayop Ka,460,1,aaaliya,2021-09-11 16:32:43.526,100.0,ltbx,ang ganda ng animation
Hayop Ka,460,2,aaaliya,2021-09-11 16:32:43.526,100.0,ltbx,pati yung details sobrang nagandahan ako
Hayop Ka,460,3,aaaliya,2021-09-11 16:32:43.526,100.0,ltbx,nagustuhan ko rin yung voice acting NUNG IBA kasi though medyo exaggerated (
Hayop Ka,460,4,aaaliya,2021-09-11 16:32:43.526,100.0,ltbx,) at times bagay naman DIBUH
Hayop Ka,460,5,aaaliya,2021-09-11 16:32:43.526,100.0,ltbx,yun nga lang… YUNG PLOT… MEDYO ANO… pero aun looking forward to more animated films from rocketsheep
Hayop Ka,461,1,dianapg,2021-09-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,If u wanna see a sexy husky x cat scene this is the movie for u
Hayop Ka,462,1,sapph1c,2021-09-25 04:11:18.059,40.0,ltbx,1 star for the animation
Hayop Ka,462,2,sapph1c,2021-09-25 04:11:18.059,40.0,ltbx,animation pretty i like it
Hayop Ka,462,3,sapph1c,2021-09-25 04:11:18.059,40.0,ltbx,"the story, however"
Hayop Ka,463,1,eggydrago,2021-09-27 11:12:30.435,100.0,ltbx,"very basic romcom storyline that gets hard carried by the art, animation, and setting"
Hayop Ka,464,1,domisshortfor,2021-10-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"4 stars for the art style but story-wise, it's a 3it was fun"
Hayop Ka,464,2,domisshortfor,2021-10-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,WILD but fun
Hayop Ka,465,1,maalab,2021-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the stars are mostly for the animation
Hayop Ka,465,2,maalab,2021-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"story-wise it’s not all new and i get that it’s a parody of the pinoy romcoms but it really copied the beats down to what makes pinoy romcom movies a bit problematic, so take what you will with it"
Hayop Ka,465,3,maalab,2021-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i am gonna say i was entertained, but this movie will definitely be only remembered for its animation which is good i might say and the direction they took with it is actually really creative and fun"
Hayop Ka,465,4,maalab,2021-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"other than that, i’m sure (qnd hopefully) Pinoy animation will grow more from here, and hopefully we have more meaningful and inspired stories that go along with the fantastic medium"
Hayop Ka,466,1,stitchcastle,2021-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Beautifully animated and hilariously raunchy
Hayop Ka,466,2,stitchcastle,2021-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s charming in its own way but its morals are very eschewed, which is I guess a good reflection of the society it’s borne out of"
Hayop Ka,466,3,stitchcastle,2021-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"(I’m filipino and raised there, so I know what I’m talking about) It’s always toeing the line between misogyny and feminism which is just a really odd thing to behold"
Hayop Ka,466,4,stitchcastle,2021-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It would’ve been awesome if the movie had something real to say about women in modern day Manila, but coming from the point of view of male writers and directors who are enamored with the idea of this being a pastiche of the old bold-star era of Philippine cinema, it was never gonna go down that route"
Hayop Ka,466,5,stitchcastle,2021-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Which, it is a shame because it had all the ingredients to do so"
Hayop Ka,466,6,stitchcastle,2021-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That being said, it works well as a glimpse into life within modern day Philippines, with its matter-of-fact way of showing social and class divides and the strange double standards on gender that are the result of colonial patriarchy being thrust into an inherently matriarchal society"
Hayop Ka,466,7,stitchcastle,2021-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The humor is also quintessentially filipino with its focus on puns (jokes that are so lost in translation that the subtitles are basically a whole different screenplay)
Hayop Ka,467,1,shortywarp,2021-06-18 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This movie is hoooorrrrnnnyyyy

Hayop Ka,475,1,tatot,2021-11-15 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I felt the potential of the animation of this film was wasted because of the storyline itself, which was very misogynistic"
Hayop Ka,475,2,tatot,2021-11-15 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,There is absolutely nothing new
Hayop Ka,475,3,tatot,2021-11-15 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I did laugh in some parts tho haha
Hayop Ka,476,1,jamesabelc,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"So me choice ka to watch this in support of Pinoy animators, or not to watch this because ayaw mo sa mga taong involved"

Hayop Ka,476,4,jamesabelc,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Susko a little over an hour nga lang sya pero andito yung mga realidad sa buhay na palagi na lang din naman nagiging subject ng mga movies / teleseryes / indie films : simpleng buhay, breadwinner, kapatid na nabuntis sa halip na nag-aaral (spoiler), yung makatikim ka ng panandaliang ginhawa at handa ka nang talikuran at gawin ang lahat, traffic at kung anu-ano pa"
Hayop Ka,476,5,jamesabelc,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,these are all familiar
Hayop Ka,476,6,jamesabelc,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ginawa lang siyang animated para siguro ibang atake

Hayop Ka,480,3,aremcu,2025-12-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"storywise, i know that it is satirical, and i think, if you're one of those people na gusto ng seryosong film with mas seryosong plot, you need to LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS, yung tipong nasa ilalim ka na ng lupa, because this movie is not made for that"
Hayop Ka,480,4,aremcu,2025-12-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the story is about a girl na gustong umangat sa buhay kaya nagmahal ng mayamang lalaki, typical pinoy, umamin man tayong lahat dito o hindi, shows betrayal na friend mo tas pinatos yung ex mo right after nyong mag-break, and all of these things, kahit gaano kaseryoso yung topic, nung nabuntis man siya or kahit ano, joke pa rin siya at nakakatawa pa rin"
Hayop Ka,480,5,aremcu,2025-12-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and maybe that alone, to make me laugh every time na may ibatong sarcasm o joke or scenes na sobrang pambobo, it IS SO GOOD, kaya masasabi kong bagay siyang maging animation movie lang at wag nang ireenact with real people, because this type of movie needs to say na HOYY WAG MONG SESERYOSOHIN HA sa pinakaunang punto palang na makita mo yung poster, pusang ina kasi"

Hayop Ka,491,3,ratemytaste,2025-10-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The movie was also clear about class contradictions with Inigo’s character (hated that nothing happened to him in the end)

Hayop Ka,538,10,hannavyr,2025-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her dissatisfaction with her current boyfriend and her attraction to a wealthier partner may seem superficial at first, but it reflects how the system conditions people to equate love with upward mobility and financial security"
Hayop Ka,538,11,hannavyr,2025-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film satirizes how consumer culture commodifies even emotions and human connection, turning them into transactions rather than purely personal bonds"
Hayop Ka,538,12,hannavyr,2025-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Looking at it through feminist theory naman, my initial impression of Nimfa as ""malandi"" for wanting more felt unfair"
Hayop Ka,538,13,hannavyr,2025-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"On rewatch, I realized this judgment reflects how women are often shamed for pursuing their desires, especially if those desires break away from traditional expectations"
Hayop Ka,538,14,hannavyr,2025-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film suggests that Nimfa’s choices are not purely personal flaws but rather shaped by the larger forces of patriarchy and capitalism, where women are pressured to chase an “ideal” version of love, security, and femininity"
Hayop Ka,538,15,hannavyr,2025-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It questions why women are criticized for seeking better lives, while men who fail to provide are rarely scrutinized in the same way"

Hayop Ka,538,17,hannavyr,2025-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"may seem chaotic and shallow at first glance, but digging deeper, it becomes a satirical mirror of our society; where class, consumerism, and gender roles intersect to shape even the most personal aspects of life like love and relationships"
Hayop Ka,539,1,fayelune27,2025-09-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Nimfa should’ve gotten an abortion, just sayinSurprisingly enjoyed this silly anthro telenovella"

Hayop Ka,539,3,fayelune27,2025-09-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But holy shit we spent the whole movie wanting to end the cycle of poverty, and it ends with her raising her baby as a single mom…"
Hayop Ka,539,4,fayelune27,2025-09-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And despite its pretty neutral portrayal of female sexuality in the beginning, she gets shamed for having sex by that weirdo radio jockey, gross"
Hayop Ka,539,5,fayelune27,2025-09-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We should be past this “children are a punishment for having sex” type of plotline already
Hayop Ka,539,6,fayelune27,2025-09-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Not surprised that the billionaire boyfriend thing didn’t work out, not just because he’s had a history of cheating but because Nimfa had shitty communication skills and kept pushing away Inigo so…But honestly these half star reviews are a bit harsh"
Hayop Ka,539,7,fayelune27,2025-09-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I’d love to see more from this studio and encourage Southeast Asian animation, even if the output isn’t always appealing"

Hayop Ka,542,3,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Your way of life and finances really do dictate how you live your life tbh… the resentment towards each other (Nimfa, a saleslady, belittling his janitor boyfriend) is real; you resent each other because you both cannot lift each other up, yet the system is unfortunately devised in a way that keeps you both down"
Hayop Ka,542,4,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While it very much feels like something so inspired by films from the late 2010s, its themes held up really well"
Hayop Ka,542,5,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Five years after its release, I’ve never seen class resentment be so pervasive all over"

Hayop Ka,542,7,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Nimfa resorts to participating as a caller in a radio program, whose misogynist host attacks her for her decisions"
Hayop Ka,542,8,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, Nimfa’s actions were dictated so by her circumstances; you cannot blame someone for doing what they do if they’re in the margins of society"
Hayop Ka,542,9,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I really liked how Raffy Tulfo was satirized here
Hayop Ka,542,10,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Its ending was a bit too far-fetched, if you watched in 2020"
Hayop Ka,542,11,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But in a time that is currently very much intent on ‘eating the rich,’ and after Luigi Mangione did what he did, it’s not far-fetched anymore"
Hayop Ka,542,12,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maybe this film was ahead of its time tbh… Anyway, I was cracking up over several jokes"
Hayop Ka,542,13,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I particularly liked the scene where Nimfa’s workmate was revealed to be fucking Nimfa’s boyfriend  just insane throughout
Hayop Ka,542,14,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I just didn’t really like the abundance of sexual jokes… it felt incredibly juvenile
Hayop Ka,542,15,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"If you get off on making animals freaky, then please go all the way, instead of showing them moaning so sexually and then revealing they’re just having a foodgasm"
Hayop Ka,542,16,davidnigelco,2025-09-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This was hailed as a boundary-pushing film, but all I got was a work that felt too afraid to be unabashedly themselves"

Hayop Ka,544,1,livelaughlebi,2025-09-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I'm so torn about this film; on one hand, the plot reeked of played-out Filipino movie tropes, and on the other, the animation was just breathtaking"
Hayop Ka,544,2,livelaughlebi,2025-09-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The opening scenes showing the animated version of a furry alternate universe of Manila was both amusing and astounding, as they were able to capture the essence of the urban streets, not to the countless nods to certain Filipino customs"
Hayop Ka,544,3,livelaughlebi,2025-09-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, from the get-go, I was also able to predict more than half of the plot"

Hayop Ka,545,2,violets97,2025-09-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"though the story is a typical filipino story, it wouldn’t be as good if it wasn’t for the animation"
Hayop Ka,545,3,violets97,2025-09-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the animation itself gave the story its charm for how ordinary it is, yet done extraordinarily because of the animation"
Hayop Ka,545,4,violets97,2025-09-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,all i wish is for more filipino animated movies because this one was really great

Hayop Ka,594,3,erisleepy,2025-02-19 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,the story was really real though but kind off-- like it's nothing I've seen before and it had a lot of political innuendos which made the movie kind of relatable

Hayop Ka,600,11,cathxo,2025-06-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I think it's about time they stop using sex jokes/sexual comedy to sell whatever they're trying to sell or fill a gap they couldn't pull together just because they can't think of anything funny

Hayop Ka,611,1,impluvial,2025-06-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,main thought: animations and jokes were on pointthe movie def commented in the social issues of the philippines whilst making fun of the classic teleserye tropes we enjoy
Hayop Ka,611,2,impluvial,2025-06-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the whole rich guy working class girl dynamic is so overused and this movie did just exactly that while being sarcastic
Hayop Ka,611,3,impluvial,2025-06-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the whole pregnancy thing at the end def circled back to the abortion “juice” shown at the intro — a reflection of how women still do not have full control of their body and are afraid of pregnancy
Hayop Ka,611,4,impluvial,2025-06-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"hated the belittling of janitors, sales workers and valets in the movie, like they are just trying to get by stfu rich ppl"
Hayop Ka,611,5,impluvial,2025-06-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the way the movie ended with nimfa being with jerry kind of represented the sad reality of people being unable to break the chain of poverty and middle class in the phil
Hayop Ka,612,1,nikarue,2025-06-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Unang una, animation-wise, ang ganda"

Hayop Ka,612,5,nikarue,2025-06-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Kahit gaano pa kaganda ang animation, kung paulit-ulit pa rin ang narrative themes, walang bago at walang depth hindi na rin kayang isalba ng visuals even though I'm a sucker for visuals, masarap sa mata kaso ang hirap i-ignore 'yung nilalangaw na plot"
Hayop Ka,612,6,nikarue,2025-06-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I'm not expecting some Pixar story plotline pero it doesn't hurt to criticize kung paano nila in-execute

Hayop Ka,612,9,nikarue,2025-06-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Instead of elevating the story with the animation, parang mas lalo lang na-highlight kung gaano kababaw at problematic ‘yung plot"
Hayop Ka,612,10,nikarue,2025-06-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Even the dialogues felt off awkward, minsan cringey, minsan tone-deaf"

Hayop Ka,612,13,nikarue,2025-06-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Ang ganda ng animation, pero nasayang sa isang plot na hindi masyadong pinag-isipan or nag-stick sa classic tropes ng Philippine media"

Hayop Ka,623,2,calciferwelles,2025-05-20 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And while the writing isn’t great, the animation is pretty damn good for something rarely made in the Philippines, you can definitely feel the backgrounds and details of the authenticity of what the Philippines looks like in animation, I swear the animation is infinitely better than most of shitty CGI uses in other Filipino movies, and I liked the dub and I thought it was good"

Hayop Ka,641,12,mello_creme,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Fingers crossed we get more Filipino animated films like this one
Hayop Ka,642,1,jaskywalker,2025-03-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,its actually not bad
Hayop Ka,642,2,jaskywalker,2025-03-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,give this film a chance
Hayop Ka,643,1,andreax_,2025-03-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this gets too much hate chillaxx
Hayop Ka,644,1,redfreevillage,2025-03-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The strength of this film is the local color
Hayop Ka,644,2,redfreevillage,2025-03-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The art quality and the attention to details is something that every watcher should pay attention to
Hayop Ka,644,3,redfreevillage,2025-03-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Almost every moment is filled with references that every Filo watcher would love
Hayop Ka,644,4,redfreevillage,2025-03-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Good work to the creative team
Hayop Ka,645,1,ra11nview,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The animation style deserves five stars, but the story can be better"
Hayop Ka,645,2,ra11nview,2020-10-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Please hire professional voice actors for animated movies too
Hayop Ka,646,1,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I really wish I could figure out just why this is rated so low on Letterboxd
Hayop Ka,646,2,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"If ever there was a movie I wanted to have a conversation about, this is it, because I fail to see why this really fun, slightly dramatic, but overall interesting slice of life is so universally panned"
Hayop Ka,646,3,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I think it goes without saying to praise the animation in Hayop-ka - it’s smooth and moves fluidly, it leaves itself open for some really impressive expressions and powerful images in scenes"
Hayop Ka,646,4,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The backgrounds are picturesque, and create a very vivid feeling of what this version of the Philippines is like: lively, energetic, maybe a little crowded but full of interesting characters"
Hayop Ka,646,5,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I think it’s worth mentioning, too, how good these backgrounds are at communicating different regions: the scenic beach near the luxury cabin, the quiet village that’s contrasted by its tight knit sense of community, both contrasted against the usual setting of the city"
Hayop Ka,646,6,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And while I’ve seen in other reviews that people find the innuendos in the background jokes to be tacky or in poor taste, I actually found that not only were a lot of them funny, but I think it creates a tangible sense of a world populated by Anthro animals more than other media tends to"
Hayop Ka,646,7,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I think sex is a pretty natural human experience, and a lot of real life marketing sells sex very transparently, and lots of mainstream Anthro animation doesn’t address that"
Hayop Ka,646,8,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s outside the ratings for films like Zootopia and Sing, and sexuality is so central a focus of a story like Beastars that normalizing it would kind of destroy its themes"
Hayop Ka,646,9,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And I think that perhaps Hayop-Ka’s depiction of sexuality in this world is one of its greatest strengths
Hayop Ka,646,10,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Which, I guess, is interesting, because it seems like part of the negative backlash to Hayop-Ka is the accusation that is perverse or obscene for its sexual nature"
Hayop Ka,646,11,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Which seems… weird to me
Hayop Ka,646,12,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The sex isn’t explicit in it, and Nimpha is only pictured having sex in the film once"
Hayop Ka,646,13,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The films setting is steeped in sexuality: sexuality is marketed on every sign on every street, and Nimpha’s motivation is mostly based around sex,But it doesn’t feel that weird I guess"
Hayop Ka,646,14,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s a story about an adult woman making adult choices, and the use of sexuality is only out of place because it’s animation - but there’s a lot of animated stories that are a lot more sexual than this"
Hayop Ka,646,15,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And like I said, I think the sexuality makes the plot kind of interesting"
Hayop Ka,646,16,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"By the third act, the novelty of animal-sex-world kinda dies off, and the film isn’t really about that, as it becomes a series of Nimpha making increasingly more destructive decisions with basically everyone involved in her life"
Hayop Ka,646,17,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But by that point in the film, I had already been hooked in, and I was interested in what would happen to Nimpha"
Hayop Ka,646,18,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The positive sexual expression was a great hook for the first act, and moving into the second and third, I cared enough about the established characters enough to weigh the morality of their decisions in my head"
Hayop Ka,646,19,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Nimpha does something objectively bad to Roger, but it is understandable that she wants to better herself, and Roger’s tendency towards violence make him seem like a less dependable partner"
Hayop Ka,646,20,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But Inigo’s a literal villain, and if him talking about partnering with Elon musk didn’t telegraph that enough, he is a character who openly talks about working with the Filipino president to keep wages down"
Hayop Ka,646,21,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"When Nimpha confronts her family in the third act, she’s objectively wrong, but I can’t really be mad at her, because it’s a realistic emotional outburst"
Hayop Ka,646,22,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I’ve watched a lot of stories about bad people who misuse sexuality in their lives
Hayop Ka,646,23,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And I’ll never claim that Hayop-Ka - an animated parody of soap operas meant to poke fun at infidelity - is even half as weighty as Tár or Bojack Horseman - heavy commentary about how celebrity is used to leverage power
Hayop Ka,646,24,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But, I do file this movie in a similar place in my head"
Hayop Ka,646,25,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Watching a not great person try to be better and trying to figure out why things are so messy
Hayop Ka,646,26,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And frankly
Hayop Ka,646,27,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I actually adore the ending for that
Hayop Ka,646,28,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Because Nimfa does fuck up, she does do bad things, but people in her life do bad things back to her"
Hayop Ka,646,29,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And in the end the best thing Nimfa can do is just… walk away
Hayop Ka,646,30,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Start a new life
Hayop Ka,646,31,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And she does and I think that’s beautiful
Hayop Ka,646,32,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I do think it’s worth mentioning the sexist overtones in the climax of the movie - when Nimfa calls the radio station
Hayop Ka,646,33,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A reference to an unfortunately very real trend of men berating women for doing anything other than serving whatever man is already present in her life
Hayop Ka,646,34,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I feel like part of the negative reception of Hayop Ka is that people read this as him being right but like… no
Hayop Ka,646,35,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,He’s just not
Hayop Ka,646,36,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maybe it’s my prior knowledge making me biased against a man in a recording booth telling a woman how to live her life, but in that moment I think it’s Nimfa’s last attempt to rely on men, and her faith in it is shattered when she talks to Inigo again"
Hayop Ka,646,37,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Because yeah - don’t know if you notice - she can’t even try to follow that bull’s advice, because she never gets a chance to come clean to Inigo if she wanted to"
Hayop Ka,646,38,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And I think that Nimfa marching for maternity leave and raising her child on her own with her family shows that Nimfa’s life isn’t going to revolve around the approval of men anymore
Hayop Ka,646,39,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s possible that’s cope: that this is a sexist message I’m jumping through hoops to spin in a way that empowers the protagonist in the end
Hayop Ka,646,40,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But I dunno, I kinda constructed that reading without thinking about it"
Hayop Ka,646,41,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I don’t think it’s that much of a stretch
Hayop Ka,646,42,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I’m going to be coming back to Hayop-Ka at some point, for sure"
Hayop Ka,646,43,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s filed in my brain alongside a lot of my favorite depictions of every day life in an animal world
Hayop Ka,646,44,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s a little melodramatic, but I do think that the depiction of Nimfa, and how her story ends, does tell a good, grounded story"
Hayop Ka,646,45,jyujinplus,2025-03-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I think I, a bunny, am always going to be happy with a film that I start and whose title very loudly says to me,“You’re an animal”"
Hayop Ka,647,1,zoyavezu,2025-03-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,the ending is actually cute but its painfully boring
Hayop Ka,648,1,invyctus06,2025-03-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Couldve casted John Arcilla instead of wanderpul tonayt

Hayop Ka,656,3,kayongbughaw,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But the plot was snubbed

Hayop Ka,672,1,dweebzeeji,2025-01-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,was in the mood to watch filipino adult animation after thoroughly enjoying the marvelous iti mapukpukaw (2023) and remembered that my first foray into the genre was this good find and that it was available to stream on netflix

Hayop Ka,764,1,starllia,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Personal preferences:- Animation and art style was good the story not so much
Hayop Ka,764,2,starllia,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,- lost interest in the middle of the movie
Hayop Ka,764,3,starllia,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,- voice acting was okay but could be better
Hayop Ka,764,4,starllia,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Key points of the movie:- I personally find the main character annoying, although it was refreshing to see a main character who is not your typical goody two shoes I love it"
Hayop Ka,764,5,starllia,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,- educational; the lesson was clear towards the end of the movie

Hayop Ka,781,6,laudelgs,2023-09-10 15:27:23.295,100.0,ltbx,And it's obvious din dito sa movie na ito na may patutunguhan ang animations natin

Hayop Ka,786,2,hnslvoid,2023-08-17 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,medyo nagkulang sa execution or terrible lang siya overall considering it was akin to being extracted from the depths of wattpad

Hayop Ka,788,2,mattinthecinema,2023-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Plus, you gotta give it to the animation it looks pretty resonant"
Hayop Ka,788,3,mattinthecinema,2023-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This feels like your daily dramedy soap opera crammed into a one hour animation fest which I actually had a pleasant time with, plus it's pretty cool to get an adult animated movie once in a while other than 'Sausage Party'"

Hayop Ka,789,2,kahelleon,2023-08-03 12:26:01.762,100.0,ltbx,I get it's a satire but it doesn't really excuse how cliche it is nor how it doesn't really satorize anything about the genre outside of participating in it
Hayop Ka,789,3,kahelleon,2023-08-03 12:26:01.762,100.0,ltbx,"The voice acting was better than I expected it to be, especially Angelica Panganiban as Nimfa"
