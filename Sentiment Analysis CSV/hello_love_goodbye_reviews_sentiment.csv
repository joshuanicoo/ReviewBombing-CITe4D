3,3,richarddillomes,2020-03-22 00:00:00.000,70.0,imdb,"Still I was skeptic because the assumption was it will be another one of those formulaic Star Cinema movie starring Kathryn Bernardo, directed by Cathy Molina-Garcia, set in an international location, usual love story but with a twist: we get a new boy this time in the form of Alden Richards"

3,10,richarddillomes,2020-03-22 00:00:00.000,70.0,imdb,"Acting-wise, Kathryn and Alden both delivered but both lacked maturity which I'm hoping can be improved on once the sequel rolls around"
3,11,richarddillomes,2020-03-22 00:00:00.000,70.0,imdb,There were exchanges that fell flat because either a) it was poorly-written or b) both did not have the capacity to deliver them with the emotions needed
3,12,richarddillomes,2020-03-22 00:00:00.000,70.0,imdb,"It took a while for their chemistry to kick in, possibly a result of being pigeonholed in their respective love teams for a long time"

3,18,richarddillomes,2020-03-22 00:00:00.000,70.0,imdb,"Obviously this is not it, but delightfully it's not a step back as well"
3,19,richarddillomes,2020-03-22 00:00:00.000,70.0,imdb,"Knowing this specific tandem and formula works, hopefully everyone involved will be more keen on wanting to elevate the viewing experience the second time around"
3,20,richarddillomes,2020-03-22 00:00:00.000,70.0,imdb,I keep harping on this because I honestly believe it has the potential to become even more special than what they've already done here

5,2,Sirfaro11,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,imdb,"Although the story is as typical as any Filipino love/romance movie could be, I like the fact that the writer and director went for the bold path of ending the movie with ""goodbye"", instead of coming up with an epilogue that let the two lovers meet again in some future"
5,3,Sirfaro11,2020-10-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,imdb,The two lead stars are engaging enough for you to care what happens to them in the end but there are some parts where it could drag

17,14,wilfredlucas,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,30.0,imdb,"In a similar vein with 'Sunday Beauty Queen,' the film resonates with Filipinos because of its sensible portrayal of what it is like to work abroad in a job you are overqualified in"
17,15,wilfredlucas,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,30.0,imdb,"But Cathy Garcia-Molina's picture falls apart as the annoying, melodramatic score continues to play in the background, tackier drone shots are added, and more forced, ""hugot"" dialogues are delivered by the leads"

32,3,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,: Lets start with how great Kathryn's acting is
32,4,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,As expected from her The Hows of Us piece
32,5,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,Alden did OK
32,6,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,Wasn't expecting much but it was a solid performance
32,7,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,However his acting reminds me of John Lloyd
32,8,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,And if you act like someone else's then you should give justice to it or do better
32,9,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,But in this movie it's neither
32,10,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,Then again a solid one
32,11,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,"Now, the lines"
32,12,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,"They are trying to squeeze the ""hugots"" absolutely anywhere they want in the film"
32,13,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,And it's absolutely out of timing
32,14,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,The lines are so bad that I can say I can write that
32,15,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,Yeah its that bad
32,16,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,The songs doesnt go well with the scenes which completely ruined the greatness of the song
32,17,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,They could have done it better
32,18,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,"Cinematography is so bad, its like you're watching a TV series"

32,20,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,There are many scenes that could've shot with them both in the frame to show their emotions at the same time

32,23,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,Next line
32,24,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,The style of shots just changed in about 10-15mins remaining in the film
32,25,og-klippz,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,50.0,imdb,It looked like they realized it and hired someone else

579,65,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Very Predictable storyline and character problems
579,66,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It doesn’t offer anything new sa plight ng OFWs
579,68,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Masyadong stereotypical yung lead characters
579,69,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Just like any leading man, toxic and possesive si Ethan"
579,70,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I like how the actor portrayed the character even if overused na yung puro red flag ang male lead (The Hows of Us, Rewind, One More Chance, My Ex, and whys), pero ang creepy ng pagkakasulat kay Ethan sa simula"
579,71,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The stalking
579,72,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Ang cringe di siya nakakakilig even if his character redeemed himself
579,73,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Then si Kath she deserved more than umiyak and halos lahat na lang gusto niya maayos na problem

579,75,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,They deserved better characters
579,77,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,This film begs the question sa dynamics of the new trend of OFW
579,78,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Dati kasi yung Nora and Vilma OFWs, parents ang OFW"
579,79,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Now naman may Maymay and Kathryn how did it end up na children are now sacrificing their dreams and even love life
579,80,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Although mentioned naman sa situation kay Maricel Laxa, but at least di ba sa generation nina Kath"
579,82,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Masyadong forced yung ibang hugot and cheesy lines na malayo sa objective ng film to be realistic
579,84,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Why do Filipino films really don’t invest sa soundtracks
579,85,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Umay ako sa Ikaw at Ako playing sa mga specific moments

579,88,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I wish nagpakita sila na nurse si Kath na nagstruggle naghanap ng trabaho sa Hongkong when she arrived
579,89,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Yung innocent version niya na akala niya basta graduate ng nursing
579,90,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It would’ve been transformational to see her growth na that kind of promise is not true
579,91,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,That’s the fantasy na after we graduate may job ka na
579,92,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Ang ganda sana may dialogues about Brain Drain ng nurses natin and grab foreign opportunities dahil sa mababang salary sa PH
579,93,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Yung scene ni Maymay na nakarating sa Hongkong sana lay Kath yun
579,95,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Also Joy entering Canada doesn’t seem like a realistic solution we can all root for
579,96,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Yes it has benefits but…… nasaan yung representation ng Pinay nurses who go to Canada who take exams and assessments
579,97,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"In real life, they still experience a much more complex and competitive process pa"
579,99,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"There were illogical and avoidable moments in the film (running kahit sinabihan na stop, yung away sa bar) 9"
579,100,jamiejcerrero,2025-02-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,May characters na halatang siksik lang and unnecessary na makasama sila

656,1,marilag_alwina,2025-01-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"they engaged ethan's (alden richards) character into a playboy-turned-humbled archetype - genuinely falling in love with joy (kathryn bernardo), despite the latter's constant disregard to his actions when initially pursuing her"
656,2,marilag_alwina,2025-01-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"the film provides a definite picture of the fate of their relationship, though cute and sweet, is quite less interesting, honestly"
656,3,marilag_alwina,2025-01-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,not to mention the soundtrack of the film (charot)
656,4,marilag_alwina,2025-01-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,and this is coming from the fact that they also chose to navigate a much essential story: the collective plight of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) in Hong Kong
656,5,marilag_alwina,2025-01-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,there have been numerous films capturing the stories of overseas workers
656,6,marilag_alwina,2025-01-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,this film specifies the struggles in the eyes of domestic helpers in HK
656,7,marilag_alwina,2025-01-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,joy is among those who has made sacrifices in an attempt to experience an economic progress
656,8,marilag_alwina,2025-01-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"they have to live in a system that limits them as well, yet, for joy, she continues to live beyond the limited lines and risks her life for arrest and deportation"
656,9,marilag_alwina,2025-01-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"at the center, we get to immerse in the crowds of workers: 'veteran' workers hyping-up 'fresh' workers saying they will get used to it, workers busily arranging packages to send back home, phone calls of longingness and heartbreak, and we even get a glimpse of the tragic situation of joy's mother"
656,10,marilag_alwina,2025-01-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,kathryn bernardo potrayed the character like her rent is due
656,11,marilag_alwina,2025-01-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"ang daming nangyari sa buhay niya with all the struggles, responsibility, pressures, all that continue to burden her, and she carried it all"

657,2,stevenfilmino,2025-01-14 06:00:02.969,90.0,ltbx,Another thing is that we are capable of becoming more than we think we can
657,3,stevenfilmino,2025-01-14 06:00:02.969,90.0,ltbx,"The story beautifully revolves around the life of an OFW, shedding light on aspects often unseen by many—the need for a safe space and a reason to save up"
657,4,stevenfilmino,2025-01-14 06:00:02.969,90.0,ltbx,"Sometimes, life becomes hard to understand, especially when we decide to choose ourselves, only to meet someone who might also choose us"

666,1,lil_light,2025-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"This movie has a lot of charm and I love the acting between the two leads, but man are there plot holes and a lot of male toxicity (which does make sense for the movie) than I remember"
667,1,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Really disappointed with this one
667,2,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,For me this is yet again one of the most highly overrated Filipino film mainly because it stars two very famous young talents of today
667,3,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The plot was good but it was not amazing or special or different in any other way
667,4,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,There are times when the character's lines were too deep that it doesn't feel normal at all
667,5,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Maybe they've adapted this deep and hurtful ""hugot"" lines because that's what catches viewer's attention when watching trailers and that's what is used for memes on social media"
667,6,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Alden Richards proved to people that he does know how to act
667,7,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,He has this charm that can make you swoon but it was not enough for me to feel a spark between him and Kathryn Bernardo
667,8,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Kathryn just keeps getting better and better
667,9,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Her acting on this film is way more mature than those of her other films
667,10,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It's sad that her performance and Alden's was not on the same level
667,11,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,You can really feel that gap during the climax when they were throwing overly dramatic lines with each other
667,12,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Cinematography is good especially during the first part and the climax
667,13,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I love how the pallette switches from vivid & strong colors in the drama's ""hardworking"" scenes to dark, warm colors for its personal and intimate parts"
667,14,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Not that crazy about the scoring though
667,15,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Filled with long dialogues,and clichés, Hello Love, Goodbye still did not capture the drama of being an OFW in Hongkong"
667,16,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It tried, and it did on the first half but ultimately it failed because that part was later merely used as a tool to make a different setting for a love story"
667,17,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Being a romantic movie, the film was not something worth remembering"
667,18,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Even though the hard to get scenes and perseverance to woo the woman are there, it remains on the box of a typical romance flick which we have already seen a number of times"
667,19,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It sure adapted a different ending from our most typical Pinoy movie hits back then but the execution of presenting the reason behind it was not that powerful as well
668,1,vincerovic,2025-01-09 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"This filipino movie though, Bernardo’s best performance yet"

834,24,thepatricisreal,2024-11-25 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,She had the best performance in the movie
834,25,thepatricisreal,2024-11-25 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,Her co-star Alden Richards matched her incredible acting and energy with his character Ethan

834,27,thepatricisreal,2024-11-25 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,But we can all relate to Ethan because love makes you do strange things
834,28,thepatricisreal,2024-11-25 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,However Alden Richards adds a lot of charm and sincerity to Ethan

834,31,thepatricisreal,2024-11-25 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"For we all have been in similar situations when it comes to relationships, dreams and love"
834,32,thepatricisreal,2024-11-25 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,I’ve always maintained that the best romance films aren’t the ones that give you the typical happy ending
834,33,thepatricisreal,2024-11-25 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"This is what makes Hello, Love, Goodbye beautiful"

838,5,regalsreelview,2024-11-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The story is simple, but the combination of immigration, a global pandemic, and a pinch of cultural humor makes it unique"
838,6,regalsreelview,2024-11-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The story shares how love grows and changes and how individuals must grow and change to survive and thrive
838,7,regalsreelview,2024-11-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"With a runtime of two hours and two minutes, some parts are unnecessary and slow the overall development of the story"
838,8,regalsreelview,2024-11-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,This is a great movie to stream for a unique international romance

1057,5,abcdefghijkelle,2024-11-15 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,although sa last part natanggap din ni ethan and sinuportahan niya rin si joy with her decision

1104,17,anlureii,2024-11-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,i was honestly surprised bc i grew up watching some of kaths films and thought she never had a romance one without that daniel padilla dude
1104,18,anlureii,2024-11-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,and i am NOT mad that i was wrong bc i rlly liked alden and kathryn together

1104,25,anlureii,2024-11-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,im giving it only 3 n a half stars tho bc i js still found myself cringing like hell everytime alden richards character was being creepy af and IDK theres js this vibe ab filo movies i cant get over

1218,2,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But this film definitely made me change my mind
1218,3,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It’s a great film
1218,4,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Kathryn is an amazing actress and Alden wasn’t so bad as well
1218,5,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This film really depicts the sad reality that several Filipinos must go through due to financial instability
1218,6,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The director of this film did an amazing job capturing the real-life struggles of our OFWs
1218,7,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Aside from that, Kathryn’s character Joy definitely breaks the typical female protagonist stereotypes in romance films where the girl gives up everything just to be with the love of her life"
1218,8,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"In this film, Joy taught us that sometimes it’s okay to be selfish for once"
1218,9,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Especially when you’ve been nothing but selfless all your life
1218,10,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"In life, we have to make decisions no matter how painful it gets"
1218,11,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Some decisions are necessary in order for us to have a brighter future to look forward to
1218,12,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I admire her character because it shows how much of a strong-willed person she is
1218,13,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Despite Ethan’s attempt to make Joy stay, she knew that this wasn’t the life that she wanted and that she could do so much more"
1218,14,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Leaving wasn’t easy for her but she knew that she had to in order to achieve her dreams
1218,15,chzanelle,2024-11-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Overall, this film is so worth watching"

1231,2,yourstrulyhans,2024-11-04 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"but for a film to have uniquely crafted characters (ones we don't usually see in mainstream media anymore), it would've been wayyyy better if the film focused on being realistic about their individual growth, and kept the romance as undertones of the story ://but idk am just a girl"

1302,1,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,My biggest gripe with the movie is that Joy's decision to move to Canada is unrelated to her familial dilemma
1302,2,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"She was going to leave regardless, and the revelation of the truth to her did not make her decision to leave any harder"
1302,3,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I think this movie wanted to be a lot of things
1302,4,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It wanted to be an OFW story, a love story, and a Filipino story"
1302,5,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The ending was a story trying to find a grip most of the time
1302,6,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"OFW stories have the same formula, one person jaded by reality, and another who yearns for something more"
1302,7,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It works wonders if done well, and the authenticity of this one really makes for an engaging world"
1302,8,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I left the movie knowing that I understood the Filipino subculture that occurs overseas compared to movies like ""Milan"" and ""Barcelona"""
1302,9,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"But it gets old, and it gets predictable"
1302,10,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I would love to see a version of this movie where Joy doesn't have to leave because she's grown attached to the child and the grandmother
1302,11,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,And working hard for them is making up for the love she missed out on
1302,12,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The emotional anchor of the movie just didn't work for me because I know there's no question that she'll leave
1302,13,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"But it is an OFW story, and the family she serves will have to have some hostile moment to make us feel sympathetic to her cause"
1302,14,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,And it's getting old fast
1302,15,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Also, the unrelenting stalker-like behavior really does sour Alden's character"
1302,16,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,And I find it weird that the script is spear-headed by at least 2 women
1302,17,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Will give it props that it didn't take the safe-ending - where Ethan and Joy meet somewhere and they'll both have it all
1302,18,mattcastaneda,2024-10-14 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Their decisions have consequences, and I like that they accepted it in the end"

1305,2,somebellmount,2024-10-13 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The contrast of Joy's mom's story to hers shows that she dares to be different and wouldn't want to suffer the same fate
1305,3,somebellmount,2024-10-13 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Having Hong Kong as the setting of the story enhances the experience

1310,4,faierest,2024-10-10 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,alden is also very charming and the little actions he does like how he moves closer to kathryn during the kitchen scene after he spent a night with his ex and she won't talk to him because she's jealous

1310,7,faierest,2024-10-10 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"he was very clingy and tried to do everything he could to provide for her and, in turn, convince her to stay in hong kong to be with him despite her saying the entire time they were together that she wanted to go to canada and make use of her degree and do something with her life other than be a domestic helper"
1310,8,faierest,2024-10-10 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"there was even that moment when everything was falling apart for joy with her finding out that her mother doesn't intend on leaving her husband and her father not wanting to go to canada and ethan's response was essentially, ""maybe this is the universe telling you that you don't have to leave hong kong and you can just stay here with me"" like"
1310,10,faierest,2024-10-10 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"with that being said, though, the way ethan loves"

1336,5,dizzy_bee,2024-09-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I always notice the crowd looking or recoginizing the actors in the background
1336,6,dizzy_bee,2024-09-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It is also noticable how some scenes seems to be forced or unnatural just to advance the plot
1336,7,dizzy_bee,2024-09-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It also ironic how a film shot abroad will make you feel that it is really a small world after all, the characters are always on the same places, casually bumping into each other too much"
1336,8,dizzy_bee,2024-09-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"While budget costraints are completely understandable, there is definitely a room for improvement"

1344,1,belabela,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I do not like the romance plot in this movie and thats my biggest gripe with filipino movies
1344,2,belabela,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,i believe this was interesting enough as a movie about a struggling young filipina in a foreign country
1344,3,belabela,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Kathryn can really sell the idea that this is an end all be all situation for her
1344,4,belabela,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"That she is serious and wants more in life, the average ofw experience and that she convinced me that she is her character here"

1345,1,jjajangmyeonim,2020-07-11 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Alden is the real antagonist in this movie
1345,2,jjajangmyeonim,2020-07-11 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I think Joy would've still thrived without his help + he just messed her life up more by making her decide to stay in Hong Kong with him or follow her own dreams

1403,7,fronkezz,2024-08-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"In terms of the main theme about love being present, I think they’re actually onto something and most of the time we put a lot of pressure in relationships by thinking about lasting forever and the future"

1407,2,philomenaa,2024-08-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,5 to a flat 4 stars out of 5 starsSiguro ang mali sa film na ito is more than the film itself but rather ang ating pag-iisip
1407,3,philomenaa,2024-08-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Napaka-weirdong lalaki ni Ethan sa totoong buhay kung tutuusin
1407,4,philomenaa,2024-08-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Siya yung lalaking mapilit na hindi kayang tumanggap ng hindi for an answer
1407,5,philomenaa,2024-08-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Siya yung gaslighter mong boyfriend na lowkey pa-sad boy
1407,6,philomenaa,2024-08-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Magaling mangmanipula at may paniniwalang siya ang may kakayahang gumawa ng tamang desisyon

1407,8,philomenaa,2024-08-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Nakakatuwa na hindi ito ginawang typical love story ni Direk Cathy with the motto na love concurs all type shitTotoo, may pagka-predictable ang flow ng plot pero it doesn't erase the beauty of it anyway"
1407,9,philomenaa,2024-08-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Kailangan natin ng ganitong mga palabas na inilalabas sa masa dahil nagiging impluwensya ang media sa tunay na buhay ng mga tao and vice versa
1407,10,philomenaa,2024-08-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Kailangang mabura sa isipan ng mga babaeng pilipino ang pagiging martyr at mapagparaya sa mga relasyon

1413,1,pizzunnie,2024-07-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,so goof realistic ending i love it when women win
1414,1,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"my mum turned on the TV and i fully expected her to put on a stereotypical cheesy filipino romcom where the man and the women have absolutely no flaws whatsover, the gay best friend/2 sassy women pushing her to “step out of her comfort zone” ending with the woman giving up on her hopes and dreams to be with the guy"
1414,2,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,but i was so so wrong
1414,3,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,i was pulled in from the beginning
1414,4,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"the story of OFWs in countries like HK and SG has been told in documentaries before, but i always felt so disconnected ("
1414,5,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,") from it, i dont really know why, until now"
1414,6,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,this movie really resonated with me having grown up with a filipino immigrant mum and her community of OFW domestic helper friends in singapore
1414,7,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"in spite of all the pressure they faced to provide for their families at home, the abuse they may have faced from their employers, they were always so cheerful and somehow had the money to buy me gifts every once in a while"
1414,8,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,the love and the culture i experienced growing up have shaped me into the person i am today and i will always be grateful
1414,9,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,one of my qualms about this movie is the guy (as all of lifes problems stem from /s) and how he couldnt seem to respect her boundaries and kept harassing her until she agreed to date him
1414,10,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"girl, youre better than him"
1414,11,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,thats whats stopping me from giving this movie a higher score tbh
1414,12,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,another is definitely the cringe cliches that still plague this movie
1414,13,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,slightly forgivable given the other things i highly praised about
1414,14,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,but i loved the movie’s exploration of women and their responsibilites towards their family
1414,15,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,there was once a time i believed that we had fully achieved gender equality only for that idea to be shattered as i grew up
1414,16,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"all over the world, women are the ones who leave their families, giving up on their dreams to work in an ass job in hopes of a better life"
1414,17,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,many women work full time and are yet expected to hold down the fort at home
1414,18,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,women are abused every day
1414,19,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,paid less than their male counterparts

1414,21,rebegae,2024-07-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"and my heart breaks for these women, including my mum, who gave up on her dream of being a nurse in canada to be in singapore as a retail worker because she met a guy whom she would marry and have me"

1420,3,tadaomi444,2024-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i love how brave she is when she wants to go to canada even if she met someone who can possibly be a hindrance to her dreams
1420,4,tadaomi444,2024-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i also love how Ethan changed his mind to not stop Joy for leaving
1420,5,tadaomi444,2024-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,he realized at the end that he trusts Joy and they will cross their paths again
1421,1,mrcshill,2024-07-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,One thing going for it besides an amazing female lead is its portrayal of Overseas Filipino workers
1421,2,mrcshill,2024-07-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Many films have done justice for the hardships of OFWs but this film offers a more unsatisfied and discontent perspective
1421,3,mrcshill,2024-07-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"As most OFW stories is heavily backed up by there ""willpower"" to provide for their family therefore giving a more touching and empowering feeling"
1421,4,mrcshill,2024-07-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The film went on another direction that provided a sense of realism and emptiness
1421,5,mrcshill,2024-07-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It's mostly sad but it's mostly true
1421,6,mrcshill,2024-07-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Film is a gem hidden under pretty big flaws (sound and just the dynamic of the leads [loved the chemistry though])

1571,6,shimochan,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Moreover, I also applaud that the struggles in the movie are what most women (with dreams and aspirations) OFW workers go through"
1571,7,shimochan,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"This highlights and raises awareness more about the life of our nanay, ate, lola, tita overseas"

1577,1,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"with the announcement of “hello, love, again”, it’s was time yet again for me to visit this romcom gold mine"
1577,2,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"and for this second viewing, i have seemed to appreciate it a half-star more"
1577,3,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"the operatic, dramatized monologues and back-and-forths between joy and ethan have grown in me"
1577,4,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"i felt their words better than last time, somehow, and though i understand that these types of writing were manufactured to emit such reactions from the audience, i cannot deny the goosebumps-y tingling sensation i felt during such dramatic scenes"
1577,5,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"the performances i still find amazing, the dramatic scenes punched hard, the romantic scenes were cheesy but sweet, and the funny side characters were wholesome-ly funny"
1577,6,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"i did say last time that this was problematic, which if looking at it at one side, it is, but i think it was necessary to further enhance the stakes and to give the characters more reason to go or not to go ahead with their decisions"
1577,7,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"this problematic element is not in any harmful way being glorified, thus its usage increases the dramatic structure of the story and gives justification to the dramatic choices, thus giving layer to the characters and their inner selves"
1577,8,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,i’ve also come to appreciate some tiny details
1577,9,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,the montage-like cutting was very effective in building the world and the budding relationship
1577,10,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,maricel laxa played her short appearances amazingly
1577,11,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,the final exchange between the leads was greatly implied like their wedding vows
1577,12,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"and surprisingly, i didn’t hate the endless “kung ‘di rin lang ikaw” in the background"
1577,13,bossch1ef,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"reading the logline for the sequel, i really hope they don’t fumble it, they have something special here"

1580,3,shenthecat,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,So excited for Kath & Alden's comeback

1583,1,vanteflies,2024-05-19 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,can’t let anyone know i somehow fw this
1584,1,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,You know what
1584,2,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It’s actually pretty good for the most part
1584,3,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I still would’ve preferred a slightly different ending that still retains Joy getting to follow her dreams of moving to Canada, but color me surprised even with the positive reactions, I didn’t hate this"
1584,4,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,As much as I disliked Alden’s character (and his acting
1584,5,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I’m so sorry), it’s a great decision to actually have him learn rather than have men like him win in the story even if they are actually wrong"
1584,6,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Still, I am quite mixed on several aspects of the film"
1584,7,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Script-wise, for one, I am aware that this is a romance film but I ended up being more interested in the OFW subplot"
1584,8,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I have merely seen the trailer of Sunday Beauty Queen but parts of this instantly reminded me of that film
1584,9,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"To bring forward a topic such as that in a mainstream film is a nice change of pace; however, it is instantly forgotten about and left unexplored by the second half"
1584,10,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Some may say that the film already needed more time dedicated to the romance plot but I wish it was a little more consequential to tie itself to its OFW subplot
1584,11,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The dialogue is a little too on-the-nose at times as well, which can make some scenes feel a little superficial"
1584,12,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Please get rid of full English dialogue between our pure Filipino leads, please, unless absolutely necessary (in which case, it wasn't)"
1584,13,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"In terms of cinematography, I found it to be on and off"
1584,14,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"There are some good shots with impressive lighting here and there, yet they are never consistent as there are also shots that are too overexposed and poorly lit for my liking"
1584,15,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I am aware that the motifs in the score would always be based off of a mainstream song, but having heard Kung 'Di Rin Lang Ikaw even months before this film's initial release (high school tingz), I find it to be a little overplayed at some points"
1584,16,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Oh, and louder music doesn't always mean more emotional impact"
1584,17,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Still, I guess the film's biggest redeeming point is its direction"
1584,18,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Yes, it's a mainstream romance film, but it offers different flavor through its more mature approach"
1584,19,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Spotty dialogue aside, the more emotional scenes work well on their own and never feel forced, even if they are a little too on the nose"
1584,20,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I did not feel the chemistry of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards at first, but damn it, Kathryn can carry hard"
1584,21,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,She just knows how to ground her character so well without making it feel superficial
1584,22,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Some people are probably tired of the comedic 'sidekick' best friend(s) of the lead female character but I personally found Kakai Bautista to be hilarious
1584,23,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Not all of her jokes land, but when they do, it's absolutely funny (the Vilma Santos scene probably got the loudest laugh out of me)"
1584,24,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"And holy fuck, I knew that was Jameson Blake playing Peter"
1584,25,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Why is he just so good at everything, even in playing an annoying character"
1584,26,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Everything said here may have come across as if the negatives outweight the positives but Hello, Love, Goodbye is thankfully saved by Garcia-Sampana's (no longer Garcia-Molina) honest direction and Bernardo's strong acting"
1584,27,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Perhaps its approach to showing the OFW life in Hong Kong can be shallow, but it's a good first step to bringing that story tied with its main romance plot into a mainstream Filipino film"
1584,28,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Other aspects are quite weak (God, I'm sorry, but I couldn't stand Alden's acting), and perhaps a slightly different ending would have sufficed, yet by the end of it, it didn't feel poorly-made for the sake of profit"
1584,29,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"By utilizing the appeal of the two leads from their own different loveteams to tell a new romance story, it gets its point across effectively"
1584,30,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Once the credits have rolled, I was relieved that I did not hate it, even if it's not quite my thing"
1584,33,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I haven’t heard Ikaw At Ako in so long (high school has officially been very long ago for me) and I had no idea it would play here, nor have I known that I would hear J@$0n M@rv"
1584,34,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,n’s voice again 2-3 years P

1597,31,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Alden Richards plays Ethan who is more of a sassy comic relief yet effective MPDG for Kathryn Bernardo as Joy
1597,32,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,His character as Ethan started out as a male creep stalking Kathryn Bernardo as Joy in a misogynist distasteful manner that even Senator Risa Hontiveros would never approve of
1597,33,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I guess Direk Cathy Garcia Molina is trying to make a Daniel Padilla out of Alden Richards with Daniel Padilla always bullying or tormenting Kathryn Bernardo for her to love him

1597,38,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,But I really DO NOT MIND Alden Richards portraying as a sex-crazy playboy luring Kathryn Bernardo into a one-night stand
1597,39,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I believe his flawed character gives merit to the powerful first hour and what Hello Love Goodbye is supposed to be
1597,40,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,But I do wonder if Direk Cathy Garcia Molina inject that sex maniac character flaw for the male MPDG to justify that one-night stand motel scene
1597,41,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Seems Direk Cathy and the Filipino masses are really after Kathryn Bernardo shoving her face to Alden Richard's bare muscular chest
1597,43,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,No wonder Daniel Padilla never passionately supports Hello Love Goodbye

1597,64,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,So Cathy Garcia Molina still adopts her standard Star Cinema family romcom formula into the promising Hello Love Goodbye story even when the film does not really need it
1597,65,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Resulting to a big pile of mainstream Star Cinema SHIT taking over the 2nd half of the film

1597,134,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The unusually bright lighting on various Hong Kong settings are slightly irritating to the eyes
1597,135,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"I can't really determine if Hello, Love, Goodbye has poor cinematography or Direk Cathy Molina intends to have this visual flaw on purpose to support the real theme & message of the film"
1598,1,peteragbayani,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"You can look past through the sappy by it being filled with palpable OFW stories and heartfelt moments of almost every character (that scene when Joy sees her Nursing classmate having his honeymoon in HK, then is asked what is she doing there, what a tearjerker)"
1598,2,peteragbayani,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"It has many subplots about family, self-worth, career, and brief encounters that can stand alone, but their sum is a surprising and refreshing experience"
1598,3,peteragbayani,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,(so much better when rewatched)
1599,1,mikkoringia,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It’s actually good
1599,2,mikkoringia,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"There were parts of the plot that would make a better, stand-alone film such as Joy and her mother, the tricks for survival for Filipino DHs in HK, among others"
1599,3,mikkoringia,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It was understandable that the movie fell for the blockbuster dilemma but in total, I can see how the writing process was thorough, impressive, and a tad frustrating"
1600,1,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It's the specificity that I enjoyed the most
1600,2,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"There have been many movies about the OFW experience, but this one roots itself in the particulars of the Hong Kong domestic helper"
1600,3,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,They're women who have made the great sacrifice to be separated from their families for the sake of potential economic prosperity
1600,4,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But they labor under a system that seems intent on limiting them
1600,5,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"They are given work, certainly, but they aren't free to seek other work"
1600,6,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,To do so is illegal
1600,7,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Joy is pursuing a dream, seeking a life beyond being the absent breadwinner for a family that doesn't feel her suffering"
1600,8,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"And because she wants more, she can't just stay within the very limited lines of her existence, risking arrest and deportation just to scrape together enough money to find a means to a better existence"
1600,9,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"In the margins, we see the internalized tragedy of a people convinced that this is somehow an acceptable situation: veteran domestic helpers constantly telling a neophyte that she'll get used to this life, a phone call back home that's about having to extend a contract another two years"
1600,10,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"And at the center, we learn about Joy's mother, whose tragic situation exemplifies the commodification of the Filipino woman, and the trauma that it brings"
1600,11,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The relationship stuff is less specific
1600,12,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Ethan fits into the playboy made good archetype: a lothario who develops real feelings for a girl because she initially rejects him, and then seems to tirelessly pursue her despite her consistent pleas for him to stop"
1600,13,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"That's a lot less interesting, even though there are aspects to Ethan's story that are kind of intriguing as well"
1600,14,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The film bends its story around the fate of their relationship, and it isn't quite able to make it feel weighty enough to stand up to the larger issues that the characters are facing"
1600,15,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"It's cute and stuff, but it feels like a distraction from the genuinely incisive examination of the Hong Kong OFW situation"
1600,16,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But none of that erases all the good that the film does
1600,17,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Even as the romance takes the fore, the movie is smart enough to make it all feel burdened by the tragedies inherent to a people who have resigned themselves to the reality of a home that can no longer be their home"
1600,18,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Also, Kathryn Bernardo is great in this"
1600,19,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Joy is a fully formed character: an industrious young woman who has deferred her dreams under the pretense of a necessary selflessness, struggling under the weight of responsibility all while learning sad truths that will come to shatter her conception of the life she's been pursuing"
1600,20,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"There's a lot going on there, and Bernardo just takes it all in and makes it work"
1600,21,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Good stuff
1601,1,jrtawasil,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,My favorite part of the movie was when Maymay Entrata did an interpretative dance and ended her routine with a kamehameha

1603,3,calumpagpatrise,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Pero aminin niyo, habang lalong tumatagal, mayroon siyang refreshing feeling"

1604,1,therielle,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,One of the best Filipino romantic dramas I’ve seen in a while
1604,2,therielle,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It has to be said that the movie is of its time; it has many layers that reveal much about the current social, cultural, economic, and political landscape"
1604,3,therielle,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It moves you to redefine what it means to truly love someone
1604,4,therielle,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s definitely more than just a love story
1605,1,jims,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I love that the characters for this movie aren’t that toxic
1605,2,jims,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"That somehow, despite being very vulnerable and emotional, they are practical and still uses their heads to make decisions"

1605,4,jims,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,HahahHmm ganda ni Kathryn pero may times na i feel she moves too much to project that she’s tired

1605,16,jims,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Come through kween
1606,1,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This is a film I normally don’t go for
1606,2,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I chickened out of a midnight screening of Midsommar and caught this one instead
1606,3,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,(I felt I wasn’t mentally ready for that haha
1606,4,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,)But I was surprised because this one wasn’t a walk in the park too—it dropped some heavy emotional bombs
1606,5,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,With grace though
1606,6,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I liked it as a whole
1606,7,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Was it cheesy/sometimes overly romantic
1606,8,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Hell yeah
1606,9,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But it was good
1606,10,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Because it was honest
1606,11,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Honest is beautiful
1606,12,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Well-acted, too"
1606,13,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I cried lots
1606,14,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"And they portrayed the OFW life honorably and respectfully, I think"
1606,15,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Never underestimate an OFW’s plight
1606,16,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"As an immigrant’s kid, I deeply appreciated how this film didn’t shy away from the messy parts of life away from one’s home country—the ugly parts of choosing to be displaced for some years in hopes of saving enough to build a better life for OTHERS who might not even deserve it"
1606,17,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I liked the subtle commentaries
1606,18,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Life is unfair
1606,19,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"It also didn’t present perfect characters, which is rare for a Filipino mainstream romance movie"
1606,20,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This one had messy people
1606,21,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,No hints of self-righteousness
1606,22,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,And you can’t help but root for them because of that
1606,23,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I love films that do this
1606,24,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Remind you of the cheesiness and beauty of being human
1606,25,dianedayang,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Of falling in love, of owning pain, of being honest about hurting, of independence and codependency, of giving and dreaming"

1609,8,shanerikim,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Pero aside from that, yung hirap ng OFW talaga is yung central theme ng kwento"
1609,9,shanerikim,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Yung pangarap mo versus pangarap mo para sa pamilya mo
1609,10,shanerikim,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Yung paano ka ba pipili sa ganun
1609,11,shanerikim,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Yung sitwasyon mo na wala ka naman choice
1609,12,shanerikim,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Salamat CGM for another worth na movie
1609,13,shanerikim,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Ang ganda niya in fairness
1610,1,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Hello, Love, Goodbye starts with Joy (played by Kathryn Bernardo) saying something like, ¨In Hongkong we don´t waste time because every second counts and every second we are payed¨"
1610,2,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,The film works best when it follows this premise- when Joy acts as the ´kayod lang ng kayod´ breadwinner of the family and when she desperately searches for ways to support her dream of flying to Canada to seek a job and follow her passion
1610,3,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"However, when Ethan (played by Alden Richards) comes into the picture, this premise suddenly shatters, bringing back the movie to its commercial origin"
1610,4,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"A DIFFERENT CATHY GARCIA-MOLINA FILMThis film is envisioned to be like one of the remarkable classic OFW films in the past like ´Dubai´, and ´Milan´"
1610,5,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Fortunately, the film doesn´t settle for that vision alone"
1610,6,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"It raises the story, nuanced to experiences by domestic helpers based in Hong Kong, where it is illegal to take another job aside from being a DH"
1610,7,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"It also digs deeper, creating a more compelling and informative story about the overseas Filipino workers in Hong Kong"
1610,8,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"To this end, the film may be given credit for its thorough research"
1610,9,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"THE MIDDLE STUMBLESIt could have been great if the film lived up to that premise and made that nuanced Hong Kong experience as it`s core, but instead it uses the romantic narrative as a way to effectively communicate with its audience"
1610,10,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"It is here, in the halfway of the movie, where it fails to function as a compelling narrative piece"
1610,11,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Just when Ethan comes into the picture, familiar Filipino movie production processes and cliches come into play"
1610,12,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Take for example the Wattpad-ish treatment of Ethan´s character, the way he is perceived as a playboy and later on revealed that he´s not so bad after all because of previous traumas he had encountered, the cringey mix of English and Tagalog to try to create remarkable lines, inserting some product brands into the movie that never really contributes to the story, using some irrelevant sequences and drone shots that make the film look weird and the quality subpar, and most importantly the redundant score that´s being played using different instruments to create a grandiose melodrama just like every Cathy Garcia-Molina film"
1610,13,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Truth be told, there´s really nothing that is compelling in the film´s second part"
1610,14,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,It all looks like a really long pantomime with ¨Kung ´Di Rin Lang Ikaw¨ as background
1610,15,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"THE SLIGHT RESURRECTIONThankfully, all the second part craze undos itself in the film´s last few minutes"
1610,16,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Here, the struggles of both Joy and Ethan are discussed and are powerfully put together to give the film a compelling touch, grounded to the themes presented in the film´s opening"
1610,17,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,The last few minutes of the film however still feels like a long music video
1610,18,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Only this time, it´s disguised as a travelogue"
1610,19,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Although, it is in this long sequence where the most delightful shots are shown, it kind of feels just like a long compilation of tourist vlogs rather than an essential part of the story"
1610,20,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,Another resurrection comes at the film´s last minute
1610,21,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"It brilliantly presents the resolution, bringing it to a powerful last shot reminiscent to that of Alfonso Cuaron´s `Roma´, but more explicitly told"
1610,22,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"THE BEST OF KATHRYNI never thought I would say this, but this is definitely Kathryn´s film"
1610,23,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Though this is her most daring and demanding role yet, she perfectly portrays Joy´s desperation, desire, and inherent sadness"
1610,24,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"This performance is her all-time best and I can, with no doubt say that it is something that should seriously be considered by the country´s award-giving bodies"

1610,26,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Despite this, Alden Richards still plays the role with heart"
1610,27,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Unlike Kathryn´s role, Ethan is not a dramatically demanding character"
1610,28,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,This is somehow opposite to Richards´ past roles which never fails to use tears and eye acting as tools for storytelling
1610,29,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"In the end, it feels like Alden is only a supporting character in this movie"

1610,32,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Sometimes it also shines as a narrative piece while the next second, it reeks of shit"
1610,33,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"This film has a lot of potential, in all honesty"
1610,34,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"However, it does not consistently makes use of that potential, and most of the time it acts like one of those commercial films in the market- settles for the mediocre, and the audience appeal while sacrificing good storytelling"
1610,35,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,70.0,ltbx,"Despite this, it still should be regarded as a cinematic achievement as it presents a raw aspect of the difficult life abroad despite being a studio-made film"

1613,2,kaitlynpastor,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"They had definitely given the audience another chemistry and vibe to maybe spice things up and break that notion of having the same couple on screen; however, what really made this movie so good is its plot"
1613,3,kaitlynpastor,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"Every bit of its scene mirrors the reality of life and through that, true love is depicted in the story"
1613,4,kaitlynpastor,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"You may bump into some cheesy and corny lines, but you could quite see how the two leads were able to emulate the vibes of Filipinos"
1613,5,kaitlynpastor,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"If you're not into romantic type of movies, don't worry"
1613,6,kaitlynpastor,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,You can still relate to it in some other perspective
1613,7,kaitlynpastor,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,Love can also be expressed in a platonic way

1615,2,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I went to the cinema with a passive indifference to pass the time, yet I was utterly blown away once the opening montage scene started"
1615,3,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It reminded me of the claustrophobic isolation and weariness of Chungking Express, which also took place in Hong Kong"
1615,4,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I thought to myself that it wasn't a bad start at all and it piqued my interest, hoping it manages to be consistently good throughout"
1615,5,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,And it did
1615,6,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The portrayal of domestic helpers is realistic
1615,7,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It doesn't go all the way to make it a tragic story, to the point of being depressing, as it manages to be hopeful at times with frequent lighthearted moments"
1615,8,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I have a soft spot for stories about OFW struggles

1615,11,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Surprisingly, I didn't find the romance corny at all"
1615,12,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards both come from different well-established love teams, and I was initially skeptical that a chemistry between them wouldn't work"
1615,13,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"However, they manage to exceed expectations as they bring the best out of each other"
1615,14,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Kathryn portrayed the role of Joy convincingly as a struggling domestic helper trying to make ends meet and realize her dreams
1615,15,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Alden portrayed the role of Ethan as your typical playboy, but he manages to bring out enough nuance to an honestly flawed character escaping the ghosts of his past"
1615,16,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The cinematography is decent, providing enough satisfactory camera angles to capture the scenic Hong Kong backdrop"
1615,17,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The script is pretty standard for a Cathy Garcia-Molina film but sufficiently witty, sappy, and genuine all at once"
1615,18,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The score is average but serviceable
1615,19,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Certain scenes could've had more emotional impact and tension without the dramatic music
1615,20,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The acting of some minor characters needs improvement
1615,21,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Despite that, it's not distracting when you have two lead characters pouring their heart out in their respective roles"
1615,22,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"To conclude, Hello, Love, Goodbye isn't just a typical straightforward romance film for me"
1615,23,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It had enough going on in its story to be engaging while being paced well enough

1615,25,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Ultimately what resonated with me most in this particular film is how it addresses love in the most honest and vulnerable way possible
1615,26,kiteman,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Every subplot is instrumental and significant to the film's conclusion, making a brutal yet optimistic statement that I rarely see in romance stories in general"

1622,1,darkbluebk,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"My expectations for this were high because of the praise it has been getting, and it does not disappoint"
1622,2,darkbluebk,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Beyond the romance blossoming between the two leads, this shows the hardships and difficulties of life while living as an OFW (Oversees Filipino Worker) - the limited choices and the sacrifices the characters have to endure"
1622,3,darkbluebk,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Kathryn Bernardo gives a stellar performance as Joy - and this is possibly her best performance to date
1622,4,darkbluebk,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,She is clearly supported by her male co-star who reciprocates her performance though Bernardo is the center of the story
1622,5,darkbluebk,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,My primary issue with Filipino romance films is the direction the romance will take when the leads are faced with a dilemma
1622,6,darkbluebk,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Usually it’s the woman who ends up self-sacrificing for love, or the issues of the man are not addressed while giving the couple their happy ending"
1622,7,darkbluebk,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Sometimes the ending could be a cop-out, instead of letting it naturally play out"
1622,8,darkbluebk,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This played out perfectly - it was sensible and realistic
1622,9,darkbluebk,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"There was no gimmick, and the direction their relationship headed addressed the situation the leads were in"
1622,10,darkbluebk,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This is one for the books
1622,11,darkbluebk,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Also kudos to the cinematographer and the writer
1623,1,marcjoshualo,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Kathryn's performance here was quintessential Kathryn, Kathryn on The Hows of Us was really the best I have seen from her"
1623,2,marcjoshualo,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Akala ko I won't hold on to Alden's character

1623,4,marcjoshualo,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The way the film presented his character and how we got to know him better was very effective
1623,5,marcjoshualo,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,(May I just note that Joross Gamboa's performance here was so hilarious
1623,6,marcjoshualo,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Like, as in sobrang benta ng jokes na kahit ano nalang din siguro lumabas sa bibig niya ay nakakatawa rito)Story wise, what I really did like was it didn't romanticize the hardships of our OFWs, it presented the harsh reality of working outside the country"
1623,7,marcjoshualo,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Kathryn really captured it
1623,8,marcjoshualo,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The film wasn't really the dark, heavy drama-ish film but it made me reflect on the privileges that I have and shouldn't take for granted"
1623,9,marcjoshualo,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Last note, sana mapalitan 'yung chroma part sa last scene choz"
1624,1,mohdsarj,2019-08-04 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It is not a pabebe romcom film
1624,2,mohdsarj,2019-08-04 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It is not a puro hugot lines and heartbreaking songs film
1624,3,mohdsarj,2019-08-04 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,This movie will prove that the tangent-line kind of relationship fate exists you might be meeting exactly once but you can still make great moments from it
1624,4,mohdsarj,2019-08-04 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,So so so film
1625,1,malcolm1980,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,A young Filipino woman working in Hong Kong meets a young bartender

1625,3,malcolm1980,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Normally, I wouldn't go for this type of film"
1625,4,malcolm1980,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"And it's by Cathy Garcia-Molina, so seeing her name normally makes me go to the opposite direction, having seen a few of her past films"
1625,5,malcolm1980,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"But this one, to her credit, has a bit more substance"
1625,6,malcolm1980,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,There's a compelling drama here about the plight of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW's) but blended with the formulaic romantic-dramedy that is her bread and butter
1625,7,malcolm1980,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"They do the usual ""hugot"" emotional romantic scene in the end where they telegraph every emotion through overly written emotional speeches each trying to out-romance each other"
1625,8,malcolm1980,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But it's still a solid drama before that

1628,1,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"If there's one thing the movie can really boast about, it's the strength of the acting between its two leads"
1628,2,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Kathryn Bernardo acted her heart out in this
1628,3,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"You can literally feel the sweat, desperation and exhaustion her character endures in her stint as a domestic helper in Hong Kong"
1628,4,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"At this point, she proved that she can carry a movie all by herself"
1628,5,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Alden Richards also proved here that he came a long way from his pabebe Aldub days
1628,6,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,His acting definitely improved and was pretty solid overall
1628,7,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Although I did have a problem with how the relationship started in the first half (Alden really was a straight up stalker, wasn't he"
1628,8,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"), the movie redeemed itself after, not just with how the relationship was ultimately executed, but the execution of the film's central message of how loving yourself over everything else is not necessarily a selfish thing"
1628,9,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"There's definite chemistry between the two of them, and given how successful the movie is critically and financially speaking, I'm looking forward to their next movie together"
1628,10,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Another thing that I really like is that (without getting into spoilers) the movie could had easily ended in a traditional happy ending
1628,11,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,They could had easily added a certain scene in the end to do that
1628,12,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"But they chose not to, instead delving more into an ending that is whilst bittersweet, much more grounded and admirable"
1628,13,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It made the movie had so much more of an impact at the end (and I already really dug the last ten minutes so that was something)
1628,14,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Hopefully Star Cinema does keep up this surge of quality and care in its films
1628,15,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I mean, it's not a stunning innovation per se, but it's a noticeable improvement in quality (*coughs* Vice Ganda *coughs*)"
1628,16,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"If there's one thing to be learned from this movie, it's that Filipino audiences do are starting to care on the quality of their local mainstream films, and less on cheap laughs and hollow kilig moments"

1630,5,jessiahannah,2019-08-04 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Hindi ko naman ginusto 'to
1630,6,jessiahannah,2019-08-04 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Kahit isang beses lang, gusto kong unahin 'yung sarili ko"

1630,10,jessiahannah,2019-08-04 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Tuwing bumabanat siya, lumulutang 'yung kaluluwa ko kasi laging may collective ""yieeeeeeee"" sa sinehan"
1630,11,jessiahannah,2019-08-04 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"As always, tibagin na talaga ang mga love teams"
1630,12,jessiahannah,2019-08-04 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Ang galing ni Kathryn (at crush ko pa rin si Jameson Blake ng slight kahit pilit siya umarte)

1632,5,gabramos,2019-08-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I expected for an ugly-cry (based on the reviews of my friends)
1633,1,thevisualbones,2019-08-05 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Kathryn was a revelation

1635,1,jirehisles,2019-08-05 05:33:03.873,80.0,ltbx,I loved the film
1635,2,jirehisles,2019-08-05 05:33:03.873,80.0,ltbx,Kathryn nailed it
1635,3,jirehisles,2019-08-05 05:33:03.873,80.0,ltbx,If you want a rom-com that has a mature narrative and character driven plot
1635,4,jirehisles,2019-08-05 05:33:03.873,80.0,ltbx,This is really a must-watch
1636,1,time_,2019-08-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This film is what Never Not Love You aspired to be + a little bit of Sunday Beauty Queen mixed in

1639,6,rc612,2019-08-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"I love it when a romcom teaches our two leads about life and they do that here, the whole resolution to their problems were great"
1639,7,rc612,2019-08-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The problem was getting there
1639,8,rc612,2019-08-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,There were just so many scenes with Alden that I was squirming in my seat and TONS of over melodramatic scenes
1639,9,rc612,2019-08-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It makes me sad because Joy's story here was strong and Ethan's but it gets too focused on the melodramatic scenes and Alden's ""hugot lines"" that it puts the film way down"
1639,10,rc612,2019-08-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I may look like I'm hating Alden but no
1639,11,rc612,2019-08-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,this was just a miscast

1644,2,trishesmeralda,2019-08-07 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,There’s a formula for most filipino romantic movies
1644,3,trishesmeralda,2019-08-07 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,It’s as if they make the same movies just with different actors and settings

1646,2,hamilcar,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Surprisingly, Kathryn and Alden definitely have a chemistry, even if they were in different TV stations"

1646,4,hamilcar,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It's not that over-the-top drama but the supporting actors really did all of that
1646,5,hamilcar,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It's a signature CGM move

1662,2,clararoxas,2019-08-08 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"But the film is too self-aware, relying too much on its tension points to hold up a flimsy love story between two people whose reasons for loving each other, you don’t even get"
1663,1,theamoureuse,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Wrongly marketed as a romantic comedy when it had so much to say about family, self-worth, and OFW/caregiver culture"
1663,2,theamoureuse,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The opening sequence was gorgeously shot and surprisingly heavy

1678,1,raymond_lo,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,saw this latest star cinema drama and i wish i could say i loved it
1678,2,raymond_lo,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"true, it’s a marked improvement from the typical rom-coms the studio is famous for but still, despite its spotlight on a subculture of filipino expatriates living as quasi-citizens/residents of hongkong, it is still saddled by the usual storytelling cliches and harrowing contrivances that makes the film less involving and feels a tad bit manufactured"
1678,3,raymond_lo,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,the movie tells the story of ethan and joy who meets in hongkong at a wrong time in their lives — she is trying to get away from hongkong and live her dream in canada while he is trying to reestablish his roots and his relationship with his family in the island after a failed relationship in the US
1678,4,raymond_lo,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,it’s a good setup but it was not unfortunately sustained when the narrative decided to give more time on cutesy scenes featuring the usual go-to “best friends” that may be permanently engraved at every screenplay that’s greenlit by star cinema bosses
1678,5,raymond_lo,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"and i observed one very sad thing about the movie: i understand that the intention is good but this movie seems to be telling us that families, at least in the vision of the filmmakers, are the modern-day representation of “talangka filipino mentality” — in this movie, they seem to get, however unintended, in the way of the dreams, ambitions and happiness of the main protagonists even if the portrayal depicts the age-old child sacrificing all for family"
1678,7,raymond_lo,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,disclosure: i saw the brilliant film “the farewell” one day before this film and i may have been unfairly influenced by it into expecting that all films could be just as good
1678,8,raymond_lo,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,this movie was a quick wake-up call that not all movies are good no matter how well-intentioned they are

1681,7,iamppatrickk,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It is well and good that they showed the harsh reality of the life of an OFW; as a family of an OFW, it is sad for us"

1681,11,iamppatrickk,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,These stories are a gateway to show the main characters’ internal conflict not just between them
1681,12,iamppatrickk,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,COMEDY IS ON POINT
1681,13,iamppatrickk,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Just as expected with Joross Gamboa

1681,15,iamppatrickk,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Also, there are too many cliché moments, but it worked out well without me cringing"
1681,16,iamppatrickk,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,This is one of the Filipino’s illness when it comes to films; they are too afraid of just letting the visual tell the story
1681,17,iamppatrickk,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Lines are too much; they somewhat gave away the story before the climax
1681,18,iamppatrickk,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,They did not let the audience think instead they laid it all out for us
1681,19,iamppatrickk,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I hope that they overcome this fear and let the visual tell the story
1681,20,iamppatrickk,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I’m also glad that they used the original artist’s songs and not just cover it
1681,21,iamppatrickk,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It sets the mood rather than someone covering it

1724,12,dvlapuz,2019-08-17 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The movie never failed to give a sense of claustrophobic feeling of alienation and loneliness in a developed world— the very reason why I think portrayal of Maymay’s character was so realistic

1764,4,crazyaiden,2019-08-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Her character was well developed and mature and Bernardo was able to fully portray it with finesse
1764,5,crazyaiden,2019-08-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,As you watch the movie and Joy's development you'd feel like you're watching the true pains and hardship that our fellow domestic helpers go through with their work and life in Hong Kong which I think is when the movie is at it's best
1764,6,crazyaiden,2019-08-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,As for the romance part of the movie I did enjoy the on screen chemistry of the two leads and how they went through although their story is not as strong as Joy's personal story alone
1764,7,crazyaiden,2019-08-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Richards is fine as the opposite of Bernardo although I do cringe whenever he needs to deliver the cheesy taglish lines which I really don't like in most Cathy Garcia-Molina movies especially that the way those lines was written in the script, it's just that it did not matched with Richard's character Ethan"

1781,3,echototheeye,2019-08-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"All the while, she brought it with some weight and optimism that makes it stand out from her recent movies, even though the tone seems derivative from them"
1781,4,echototheeye,2019-08-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It all works because of the performances of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards, who are able to carry the levity of their down-to-earth characters"
1781,5,echototheeye,2019-08-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,And their chemistry is surprisingly exquisite and wonderfully executed that their solution pays it off
1781,6,echototheeye,2019-08-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The rest of the movie is filled with neat cinematography, a good pace and a cinematic feeling"
1781,7,echototheeye,2019-08-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"And even if the rest of the cast fall on the usual entrapped cliches, it is Bernardo and Richards' rapport that makes ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" transcend to its audience"
1781,8,echototheeye,2019-08-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It is one of those Filipino romance movies where I do not hear an over-the-top shouting match

1815,3,john_raymond,2019-09-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I was surprisingly riveted by the first part but then it lost steam in the middle
1815,4,john_raymond,2019-09-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I didn't feel the romance between the characters of Alden and Kathryn that much, but I commend their performances"

1821,4,sanriel,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"There were also bad moments - a lot of typical annoying acting from their friends, the why-does-Ethan-keep-on-touching-his-cap scene, the second half almost drowned with score-after-score, the stalker-ish first half, the drone shots gosh, and that awkward final all-english moment before Joy left"
1821,5,sanriel,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"But has to be one of the more satisfying Star Cinema endings in a while, so that left a good taste in my mouth"

1823,2,alleyson,2019-09-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"at first i thought it was just because i wasn't used to kathryn not having daniel as her partner in a film, but later on i realized that it was because i hated how half of the dialogue was overly cliché (ESPECIALLY alden's parts) in a way it felt like i was reading one of those funny crush memes on fb LOL"

1825,2,setherex,2019-09-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"But as an immigration/emigration story goes, ""Hello, Love Goodbye"" weaves around its complexities more deftly than most - love overcomes displacement, but it doesn't vanquish it, even in the most heart-stricken princess stories"

1826,7,jiannemsoriano,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"What’s also surprising is that Bernado and Richards are from rival television networks; in the Philippines, it’s common for actors to be signed to one network exclusively"
1826,8,jiannemsoriano,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Their performance in Hello, Love, Goodbye proves that once in a while, it doesn’t hurt to break out of your loveteam to grow as an artist"

1826,11,jiannemsoriano,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"To get into their roles, Bernardo was separated from the cast to better empathize with Joy’s feelings of isolation; after just a week of filming in Hong Kong, she wanted to go back to the Philippines"

1826,13,jiannemsoriano,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Molina is notorious for her strictness with the artists that she works with—but it’s paid off as they are all household names, and her films have been blockbuster hits"

1826,15,jiannemsoriano,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The film tears away the layers of the OFW experience with sheer intensity
1826,16,jiannemsoriano,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Shifting away from showing the employee-employer relationship found in other films about OFWs, Molina brings her focus to the OFWs themselves, and their families back home"

1828,2,themickeym,2019-09-11 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"The romance wasn't new ground, but still relatively mature within Filipino sensibilities"
1828,3,themickeym,2019-09-11 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,But the nail in the coffin for this film: the emotion wouldn't stop flowing as I thought about my Tita who’s life pretty closely to Joy's where she came to America as a worker to work to send money back to her family and then fell in love
1828,4,themickeym,2019-09-11 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,The movie leans in to the “Novela” aspect just enough while keeping its feet on the ground

1859,2,iamphilsm,2019-12-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Kathryn Bernardo is really effective in her role as a selfless domestic helper and I'm surprised that she and Alden Richards has chemistry onscreen

1868,10,louthe,2020-01-04 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"And so, that brings us to the other side of the film that makes the romance that they try to invigorate worth buying into knowing their stories that can pretty much be anyone's"

1916,9,mattcarrillo96,2020-05-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"It’s arguably comical for characters to have the same arguments over and over, but it stagnated portions of the story"
1916,10,mattcarrillo96,2020-05-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"I’d say if it were 10-15 min shorter, it would’ve felt more efficient with its time"
1916,11,mattcarrillo96,2020-05-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Gorgeous film though, and worthy of its title as the highest-grossing Filipino film"

1918,2,keiryaknightley,2020-05-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,ayokong magbring up ng ibang mga movie pero:1) ang galing galing pa rin ni kathryn
1918,3,keiryaknightley,2020-05-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"habang nanonood naalala ko talaga yung barcelona lmao si joy yung parallel universe version ni hindi celine2) sinubukan kong intindihin character ni ethan pero hindi siya gio smith ng never not love you (2018) na kahit unlikeable at papunta na sa selfish mga action, may pinanggagalingan"
1918,4,keiryaknightley,2020-05-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,at least si ethan nagkaron ng character development
1918,5,keiryaknightley,2020-05-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,pero ayoko na parehas silang stalker lmao kaylan ba magkakaron nng matinong romance sa opm 3) tbh di ko rin bet si alden bilang love interest for personal reasons na parang ang dami niyang kamuka sa probinsya namin HAHA (dadagdagan ko nalang)
1919,1,denielemein,2020-05-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,not going to complain regarding the fact that this is Philippines’s highest-grossing film of all time

1925,1,czxrinx,2020-06-12 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,was disappointed that it was not the kathniel love team we know but alden and kathryn’s chemistry was good
1926,1,lovelily,2020-06-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Is it wrong if this movie‘s spotlight on Hong Kong makes me romanticise Hong Kong more from the view of a foreigner
1926,2,lovelily,2020-06-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The movie poster caught me but the synopsis made me watch it as I am interested in discovering more narratives of domestic helpers
1926,3,lovelily,2020-06-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"As an Indonesian, I learned a lot more of Filipino words which are surprisingly similar to my language, such as ‘bangon’ and ‘utang’, so that was interesting and made me curious to learn the language"
1926,4,lovelily,2020-06-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"As a woman, I hate the fact that body-shaming was absorbed into a couple of jokes during some scenes, notably Miss Central 2019"
1926,5,lovelily,2020-06-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"As a nobody who is not qualified to give any critics on film but will do it anyway, I would say that this movie centres around the life of one domestic helper which is pretty illustrative but not of the domestic work itself"
1926,6,lovelily,2020-06-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It disentangles a bunch of issues which may probably be central to some women foreign domestic helpers
1926,7,lovelily,2020-06-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,If there is anything that I would like to underline is that Joy helps Ethan and not the other way round
1926,8,lovelily,2020-06-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,If you cannot see something as simple as that then I do not know what else to say except to recommend you watch the movie again
1926,9,lovelily,2020-06-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"This kind of movies that reinforces the idea that men are allowed to force the love out of a responsible, ambitious, and bright young lady just because that lady is too arrogant to love is just"
1926,11,lovelily,2020-06-14 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"We need to stop praising men for doing the bare minimum and stop romanticising creepy, forced love-lines"
1927,1,azrdl,2020-06-16 18:17:15.650,90.0,ltbx,i cried like i was an ofw (i am not btw)

1928,1,yourpotato,2020-06-17 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,this is definitely better than most drama/romcom filipino movies
1928,2,yourpotato,2020-06-17 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,it deserved the hype
1928,3,yourpotato,2020-06-17 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,ganda rin batuhan ng line

1930,1,jasonrcf,2020-06-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,unfortunately closer to what i thought it would be than what i hoped it would be
1931,1,janyuan,2020-06-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Sometimes, rewatching a film you loved in the first time you saw it can be a bad idea"
1931,2,janyuan,2020-06-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I like this film a bit less now after a re-watch
1931,3,janyuan,2020-06-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The problems in the screenplay is much more evident this time, I disliked Alden's character a lot more, and the film depends on the scoring wayyy too much"
1931,4,janyuan,2020-06-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"But I still like how Star Cinema tried to push their boundaries on the stories that they tell, Kathryn Bernardo's acting performace is still worthy of tons of awards, and I'm lowkey happy that this is now the highest grossing Filipino film"
1932,1,earnestattempts,2020-06-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,this is my comfort movie thanks very much

1934,2,vnsrfn,2020-06-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I don’t know the details of what my mom went through working also as a domestic helper in Hong Kong
1934,3,vnsrfn,2020-06-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,What i do remember though is something she said in passing; that she would cry every night because she was away from me
1934,4,vnsrfn,2020-06-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I never thought of my mom leaving me in the Philippines when i was younger as something easy
1934,5,vnsrfn,2020-06-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I knew it was hard, i just didn’t know HOW hard"
1934,6,vnsrfn,2020-06-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I respect and love my mom so much and knew she did a lot for me but this film made me see things differently
1934,7,vnsrfn,2020-06-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"That respect and love blinded me, it never crossed my mind to really think about what she went through and now to think that she did all of that for me fills me with emotions i can’t even begin to explain"
1934,8,vnsrfn,2020-06-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I’m so thankful but also so sorry
1934,9,vnsrfn,2020-06-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I just hope i’m able to repay even just half of what she has given me and she has and continues to give me everything
1935,1,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,"I read somewhere once that flying makes you more prone to crying but I think that even at ground-level, this movie would have made me cry"
1935,2,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,"On the surface, it looks like your typical Filipino romcom"
1935,3,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,"Guy meets girl, one of them dislikes the other initially, the other person is interested and tries to win their affection by being both pabebe yet persistent, a montage ensues, and as much as one party tries to fight it, they eventually fall in love (chAr)"
1935,4,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,I remember seeing the trailer for this sometime last year and wanting to watch it because it looked promising
1935,5,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,"While the movie does fall trap to some of the cheesiness and tropes (read: Ethan's backstory) that make the aforementioned typical local romcom weak, it manages to bring a depth to its characters, including l Hong Kong itself, that usually escapes mainstream blockbusters"
1935,6,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,This is exemplified in Joy's character
1935,7,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,I've been a Kathryn Bernardo fan since grade school (hello Mara Clara) but this is probably her best performance to date
1935,8,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,"We are thrown headfirst into the demands of Joy's life and her routine, the pacing of which I really enjoyed"
1935,9,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,"Duty to family, the dichotomy between practicality and passion, and the price of following your dreams take on a new meaning in her situation"
1935,10,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,You can't help but root for her and (if you're like me) want to throw a shoe at Ethan
1935,11,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,The movie never outright asks you for sympathy
1935,12,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,"Instead, it paints an honest picture of things as they are for so many OFWs in Hong Kong"
1935,13,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,"It leaves the viewer instead to decide how they feel about not just the characters' situations, but also the very systems that birth and perpetuate them"
1935,14,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,Glad I was finally able to catch it
1935,15,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,70.0,ltbx,I didn't manage to finish the whole thing but am hoping to during quarantine
1936,1,julied2019,2020-07-11 09:22:40.986,80.0,ltbx,"After seeing Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards with other screen partners for so long, who would have thought that they too could ooze out an undeniable chemistry"
1936,2,julied2019,2020-07-11 09:22:40.986,80.0,ltbx,I admire both of their performance in this film and I really hope they'll have more projects in the future
1937,1,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Hmm, sounds like ""Three Words from Forever"""
1937,2,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Straightforward as this title is, whatever the complications and heartbreak in Cathy Garcia-Molina's latest romantic tragedy, they can't be any heavier than the story that has to be behind Kathryn Bernardo not playing opposite Daniel Padilla"
1937,3,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"No, I'm sure their marriage is as annoyingly adorable as ever, especially since this film doesn't set a good tone for them seeing other people, onscreen alone"
1937,4,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Bernardo plays a free-spirited domestic worker in Hong Kong, with a diverse network of friends that - don't worry, Filipino conservatives upset about an onscreen couple not being married offscreen - isn't too diverse"
1937,5,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"She naturally hits it off with a handsome fellow Philippines expat, an ambitious bartender looking to lay some roots down in the city our woman can't wait to get the heck out of"
1937,6,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"As the two begin to look to their seemingly temporary friendship to help them weather the Hong Kong hustle, it becomes clearer that they have ideas to spend their lives together, and extremely different ideas about how to"
1937,7,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"As the title plainly tells you, this story won't work out, but it is charming, way to a fault"
1937,8,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I mean, this is clearly just another trite and sappy romantic-comedy-drama, of little consequence and even less surprise, with a runtime of two hours"
1937,9,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"This doesn't want to be ""just another"", as it lives up to its title by methodically examining the process of a potentially doomed romance with the intimacy and draw of a prestige love story"
1937,10,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"There's more potential on paper than you'd think, but of course it's all hijacked by overwrought rom-com sensibilities, especially with bouncy pacing and gratingly corny, relentless music"

1937,12,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Lasaten's score sucks, and it's just about omnipresent throughout an authentically paced drama to bring out the inauthenticity of its melodramatic situations, frilly farce and general genericism"
1937,13,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The script doesn't help with its quirky sense of humor and hearty or histrionic breakthroughs, all cheapening substance that is just full enough to water down that punch-up"
1937,14,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"That script may only feel obligated to pander to the lowest common denominator, but it sits between the tritest of romantic melodramedies and the most cloying of aesthetics"
1937,15,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The average rom-com viewer may also get bored with the runtime, so of course I find more compelling than the average rom-com"
1937,16,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"There's certainly a unique enough romance in the gorgeous, ever-bustling backdrop of Hong Kong explored extensively as its own character"
1937,17,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,This scope is more than enough to liven up this intimate love story
1937,18,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"but just to be safe, let's overshoot the environment, overwork the editors, and overplay an oppressively corny score"
1937,19,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"There's nothing refreshing or challenging about this shameless fluff piece, but its themes are a little more grown-up than usual, more frank about the chore of reconciling romantic interests with personal ones"
1937,20,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Histories of failures and potentials for success are heavily debated and approached in this two-hour dual-character study, at a methodical clip that may bore certain viewers without the fallback of zanily colorful supporting characters"
1937,21,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"They bring some laughs, and texture the personalities of lead characters who are spoiled by their own, more mundane humor and quite a few humiliatingly cheesy bearings of soul"
1937,22,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Besides that, their motivations and relationship turns are thoroughly, even complexly drawn, and tightened under the solid chops and crisp chemistry of the beautiful Kathryn Bernardo and the handsome Alden Richards"
1937,23,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"This takes the time to build a genuine human drama, but it's squandered on meager fluff"
1937,24,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Between the ready-made claptrap and the meanderingly thoughtful romantic dual-character study, the former pretty much prevails on grating music, style, comedy and melodrama, with enough entertaining sprawl in the lavish Hong Kong setting, more colorful characters and endearing flair, and enough real nuance in the characters, their relationship and the performances, to make Cathy Garcia-Molina's ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" a touchingly heartfelt, just as abrasively disingenuous romantic melodramedy"
1937,26,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,75/5 - Fair

1943,1,dibidi,2020-08-09 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"This is a movie that normalizes and romanticizes harassment, gaslighting, and manipulation and justifies it by having the antagonist having had his heart broken by another woman too"
1943,2,dibidi,2020-08-09 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,so it’s misogynist as well

1961,6,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It had the most noisy and annoying sidekicks ever
1961,7,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,They all follow the typical formula of sidekick friends telling the main protagonists what and how to feel

1963,4,anadominiquea,2020-10-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Joy was such a strong character which Bernardo was just enough to portray
1963,5,anadominiquea,2020-10-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I could imagine other actresses who would be able to give justice to the same role
1963,6,anadominiquea,2020-10-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I was not surprised at how Bernardo was able to incredibly pull off that “What if I choose not to stay

1982,2,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"Against the backdrop and introspective of our country's modern day heroes, the OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers) specifically domestic helpers in Hong Kong, the film was able to bank on even more emotions than expected"
1982,3,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,Life in Hong Kong is not easy more so for the domestic helpers who are unable to improve their lives even if they wanted to
1982,4,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,One of these domestic helpers is Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) who has wants to leave Hong Kong and find a better life in Canada as a nurse

1982,8,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,But their polar opposite circumstances and dreams will make the decision to continue with their relationship a difficult one to make
1982,9,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" does enough to make it one of the better romance drama films we have seen"
1982,10,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,How it accomplishes this is by pretty much making outstanding work on the basics
1982,11,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"First and foremost, the central characters of Ethan and Joy were well-written and well-scripted"
1982,12,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,Both characters had deep-seeded personal issues that were not only central to the film's main conflict but grounded and believable
1982,13,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"The script was mostly great having its fair share of emotional one-liners and witty banters but we have to admit, it went a little too cheesy in some scenes"
1982,14,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"Beyond that, both characters had great actors and performances behind them that gave these characters much life and much justice"
1982,15,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"Additionally, the main narrative was well-written"
1982,16,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"It felt fresh and had a lot of unexpected twists, turns, and surprises along the way"
1982,17,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,The ending was satisfying without spoiling much
1982,18,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,It also presented a basic look into the stark reality of the OFW domestic helpers in Hong Kong
1982,19,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"However, we felt that the film failed to establish more emotions on this introspective"
1982,20,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"While it had some unnerving revelations about the domestic helper life, most of these have been tackled better in other films previously"
1982,21,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,What surprised us most though if the film's cinematography
1982,22,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,It's a given that Hong Kong is a beautiful city to begin with but the camera work here impressed us
1982,23,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"Overall, ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" is a great romance drama film worth your time and one heck of a dramatic film at its core"

1988,1,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The film had a lot of technical flaws and passé comedy injected into it (fat jokes in 2019
1988,2,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,really cathy
1988,4,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It would have worked better if it hadn't been for the half-baked (arguably unnecessary) romance plot but who are we kidding
1988,5,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,This is Star Cinema
1988,6,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, very un-Star Cinema-esque is its approach to the struggle of our OFWs and I respect it for that"
1988,7,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Joy's character is solid and human, the driving force of the film despite the cringey corniness of her ""romance"""
1988,8,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Kathryn deserves all the praise and her chemistry with Alden was surprising, especially in the early days of their ~love story~"
1988,9,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The only real gripe I have against this film is how severely underdeveloped Ethan's character was
1988,10,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"He didn't deserve the quotation markable dialogue in the end, because he learned so little even when the lesson was staring right at him"
1988,11,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Overall, I loved Joy's story"
1988,12,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It separates itself from the usual martyrdom leading ladies in romantic films usually take on
1989,1,mnugaspar,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Strong opening scene
1989,2,mnugaspar,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I liked the camerawork and how it captured the repetitive and lonely life of someone named Joy
1989,3,mnugaspar,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"From then on, HLG is mostly formulaic"
1989,4,mnugaspar,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Kathryn Bernardo shines but some of her lines sounded too melodramatic
1989,5,mnugaspar,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I think Alden Richards’ character was underdeveloped - and while this has made me expect less of him, his Ethan leaves a lot to be desired"
1990,1,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It's the bothering solitude of my Christmas eve evening that led me to watch this
1990,2,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Kathryn surely deserved that acting award for this film because she single-handedly carried it
1990,3,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Alden too carried for some parts but then again I can't say that much for a character I didn't like
1990,4,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The plot about OFWs hurts because it's honest but the way it's written is loose especially Ethan's backstory
1990,5,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Cannot pity a guy like him
1990,6,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,They had a chance na rin naman to showcase Hong Kong as a place na shithole for domestic helpers or a tourist area pero parang di ko naman masyado nakita sa film
1990,7,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Screw the drone shots as well
1990,8,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Also the script, god, the script"
1990,9,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I speak in Taglish rin naman but their dialogues are really fictional because if you talk like that in real life then I am actually judging you
1990,10,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Scoring bothered me too because I like the silence of films especially kapag mabigat na yung batuhan
1990,11,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Sorry to the music director but I will not feel anything kapag nilapatan niyo ng overplayed song yan; why can't we just compose new soundtracks for new films
1990,12,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"In summary, I give licenses to Kathryn & Alden's fans by presenting this film as proof for their acting calibre then I will snatch it back once they start speaking how good it was"
1991,1,cosmythr,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"carmi raymundo's best, i think"
1992,1,bianx,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I couldn't care less about Ethan and Joy's love story
1992,2,bianx,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I wish this movie was more about Joy because it shines when it's about her struggles in HongKong and her trying her utmost best to be more and have more in life because I love ambitious women like that
1992,3,bianx,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"No offense to Alden Richards but full offense to the writers, the movie lost me the moment Ethan's creepy and pushy ass showed up"
1993,1,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Two stars para sa acting ni Kathryn na bumuhat ng pelikula at para sa chemistry nina Kathryn at Alden
1993,2,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Other thoughts:1
1993,3,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,So I just watched a pretty good movie before this (Fan Girl by Jadaone) so ramdam ko yung contrast ng good vs not so good film
1993,5,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Masyadong ""in your face"" yung music"

1993,12,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Corny ng script
1993,13,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Buti okay bumato ng linya si Kathryn but not even that can hide the fact na hindi maganda yung script
1993,15,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Yung character ni Alden only works in movies
1993,16,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,That's a creep irl
1993,18,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Uhh wala akong nakuhang value sa mga eksena kasama ng mga kaibigan niya (Kakai, Maymay, etc"
1993,20,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Or baka di lang kasi maganda yung script at yung OA na acting nila
1993,22,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I'm hoping na magkaron ulit ng project etong dalawang 'to with a better script and director

1996,2,drew_phoenix,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I remember liking it before, and I think I still like it now"
1996,3,drew_phoenix,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The best scene for me though was neither with Alden nor Kath, but with Joy's mom talking about what happened with her and Joy's dad"

1998,1,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"For a Star Cinema fare, the best thing this film does is to finally not force a happy ending to please its target audience"
1998,2,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"That was my biggest issue with Cathy-Grace Molina’s previous film, The Hows of Us — resolving all conflicts in order to reach a happy ending that feels fake"
1998,3,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Make no mistake, this film is also boggled down by the same trite and cheesy writing (Making Kath’s and Alden’s character an official couple is so forced), overblown musical score, and emotionally manipulative sequences that have plagued the quality of Star Cinema films for the past few years"
1998,4,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, this film is effective as a drama that talks about Filipino Diaspora"
1998,5,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It even takes away the usually bright gloss aesthetic of a Star Cinema film; which I loved
1998,6,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,There’s a sense of realism at play
1998,7,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It shines at moments when it doesn’t delve on the romance, but on the struggles faced by Filipinos working abroad"
1998,8,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,When we are shown how these Filipinos find ways to cope up and form a stronger bond as a community of overseas workers — the film is at its most human
1998,9,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Past its flaws, the film is something I appreciated"
1998,10,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It’s a semi-fresh take that is just a bit uneven
1999,1,lyndethegrande,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,This narrative hits too close to home
1999,2,lyndethegrande,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I will spend the rest of my 2020 reflecting about my decisions and crying about it
2000,1,nataliep0rtman,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,it could've been better if they focused more on the struggles of an ofw than the romance department
2000,2,nataliep0rtman,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,i got touched on some scenes but the romance thing made me cringe
2001,1,gjrvalenzuela,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,it is refreshing to see kathryn bernardo paired up with a different partner
2001,2,gjrvalenzuela,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"no doubt that her acting skills, as well as alden’s, are very raw and vulnerable and believable"
2001,3,gjrvalenzuela,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"however, this is too dramatic for me, i mean, i have seen rom-coms with the same point — that is to put one’s self and pursue a career and turn down a man who would be willing to do literally anything just to be with you — that aren’t very heavy to the heart"

2035,4,geldof,2020-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Plus, the title itself and the start of their romance takes away the thrill of wondering what will be the ending"

2040,2,kmp091,2021-01-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But the reductive comparison doesn’t diminish how well the details are colored
2040,3,kmp091,2021-01-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Even the nuances of the script are actually nice, though I could use a better delivery mechanism than the “full English back and forth” that has become a staple of many contemporary productions"

2042,3,smh_life,2021-01-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It really does highlights the nature of impermanence and show a realistic nature love and not some glossed version of it

2043,1,jackcordero,2021-01-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"**Watched this for class, and we talked about the rift between mainstream and independent cinema in the Philippines"
2043,2,jackcordero,2021-01-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"**The opening sequence of Hello, Love, Goodbye (2019) is almost exactly the same as the first few minutes of Sid & Aya: Not a Love Story (2018), as it makes use of a montage of the scenes to come, all while Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) describes Hong Kong, and her life, and how she perceives love"
2043,3,jackcordero,2021-01-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Again, similarly with Sid & Aya, the first part only follows Joy as she lives her life as a domestic helper, then it pulls the ""then it all changed"" cliché when Ethan (Alden Richards) comes in and pulls out some weird and cringe-y pick up lines to woo her (And funny enough, just like Sid & Aya, the woman has little to no interest in the man)"
2043,4,jackcordero,2021-01-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This film almost masquerades as the usual mainstream Filipino romance, with its structure and overall production"
2043,5,jackcordero,2021-01-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It has invisible editing, clear visuals, and an upfront and chronological structure (with exception to the first flash forward montage and a few flashbacks)"
2043,6,jackcordero,2021-01-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"But where Hello, Love, Goodbye diverts from the ""usual"" is in the complexity of its characters' struggles as its plot progresses"
2043,7,jackcordero,2021-01-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Joy is ""lost potential,"" with the film implying that she was an excellent college graduate"
2043,8,jackcordero,2021-01-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"She is almost drowning in responsibilities as a domestic helper, but continues to hustle harder and harder to provide for her family, and to keep her fading dreams alive"
2043,9,jackcordero,2021-01-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Ethan is a hotshot bartender who is secretly full of regret, as he previously left his whole life behind just to chase a girl he desperately loved"
2043,10,jackcordero,2021-01-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Joy and Ethan's dynamic starts out weird, but their love reluctantly grows as Joy comes closer to her dreams and as Ethan slowly comes to terms with his past"

2108,1,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,A surprisingly affecting romantic drama about the large community of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong
2108,2,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"This is something that has been recently explored as a more heart warming drama with Oliver Siu Kuen Chan and Anthony Wong's excellent Still Human, however here we have a similar situation but shown almost entirely from the Filipino workers perspective and with a significant romantic plot"
2108,3,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Through central character Joy, who wants to be a nurse, but is forced into the domestic helper lifestyle like her mother, it looks at the difficulties and exploitation inherent in these worker's arrangements"
2108,4,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Paid a pittance, and treated appallingly by their employers and the state, this film examines how they can be trapped into this existence and life, allowing them to send a bit of money home to family in the Philippines that they only speak to via video calls, promising a reunion that will never happen"
2108,5,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"There's an excellent movie in here, but the film stumbles significantly when introducing Joy's love interest, barman Ethan"
2108,6,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"While it may appear like this film is going to be a standard romantic comedy, it's not really, and Ethan's initial characterisation is straight out of a lunatic American rom-com"
2108,7,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"After being introduced by pretending to be immigration police and arresting Joy, he's harassing and calling her constantly, that even within the constraints of a romantic comedy (which this isn't"
2108,8,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"), he's basically a stalker"
2108,9,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It's a shame that the film goes down this initial cliched route, after introducing Ethan's character for the next twenty minutes, because at it's core, and once Ethan stops behaving like a lunatic, it's a genuinely tender and quite tragic film about a doomed romance, and about how Filipino immigrants to Hong Kong are never made to feel part of society"
2108,10,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The films portrayal of both Ethan's father and Joy's parents is well done, and very sympathetic, which makes it more frustrating that they wasted so much time with Ethan's initial character, when they could have skipped that and presented him as he appears for the last hour of the film"
2108,11,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It's filmed on the streets and alleys of Hong Kong, and all extremely recognisable and vivid, clearly made by someone who understands the areas, full of classic ""oh yeah, I know where they are"" moments"
2108,12,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Surprisingly bittersweet ending too
2108,13,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"This is mostly an excellent film, that's dragged down unnecessarily by the initial appearance of Ethan - made even more frustrating that they roll that characterisation back"
2108,14,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Still, definitely worth my time, and a lot better than I expected (but it could have been just that bit better)"

2110,6,kalidyllic,2021-04-22 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i’m not going to downgrade the film just because alden’s character is ‘toxic’

2135,5,meewars,2021-06-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,definitely one of the best filipino films out there
2136,1,ajstarr,2021-06-10 18:01:30.380,90.0,ltbx,This I think is my most favorite Cathy Garcia-Molina flick
2136,2,ajstarr,2021-06-10 18:01:30.380,90.0,ltbx,Not her usual glossy meet-cute which I like more
2136,3,ajstarr,2021-06-10 18:01:30.380,90.0,ltbx,A bordering arthouse material at last
2137,2,nimuy,2021-06-13 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"5/10For me, it’s a very typical Pinoy romance you’d expect from Star Cinema, so I won’t really go into the quality and narrative of the film"
2137,3,nimuy,2021-06-13 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,What always fascinated me was how this stands as the highest grossing film of all time in the Philippines
2137,4,nimuy,2021-06-13 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Having an OFW-centred story would definitely play a huge role in this benchmark, since the OFW struggle is a very real experience among working class Filipinos"
2137,5,nimuy,2021-06-13 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,There’s a whole history behind OFW films that I’d love to look into further while I’m still studying Honours
2137,6,nimuy,2021-06-13 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It was also jarring to have watched this after seeing two Wong Kar Wai films these past few days — I say this because this film is set in Hong Kong
2137,7,nimuy,2021-06-13 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"So for me, it felt like an interesting exercise in comparing both localised and transcultural portrayals of a country"
2137,8,nimuy,2021-06-13 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I don’t really have a right to comment on the way Cathy portrays Hong Kong people, or whether or not this captures an “authentic” Hong Kong experience outside the OFW life, but this is also something I’d like to scrutinise more closely"
2137,9,nimuy,2021-06-13 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I think I can get behind why people would see this as above average, and despite it being an average experience for me, I appreciate the film for what it is"
2137,10,nimuy,2021-06-13 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I would love to write further about the film’s OFW narrative and transcultural elements, as they are both integral to shaping Philippine cinema as a globalised medium"
2137,11,nimuy,2021-06-13 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,(PS: watching Kathryn Bernardo sing badly has been the most cathartic thing I’ve seen all year)

2142,2,dnie_cc,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The plot was alright and the acting was good
2142,3,dnie_cc,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I just hope we don't romanticize these types of hardships and don't consider the family dynamics in this movie as acceptable and normal
2142,4,dnie_cc,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Plus, Alden's character was kind of scary"
2142,5,dnie_cc,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Anyway, the characters eventually developed and the movie ended with a resolution"
2142,6,dnie_cc,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Still an alright film
2143,1,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Cathy Garcia-Molina departs from rom-coms in a touching tale of sacrifice and love in a city far from home

2143,4,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"This latest offering from Cathy Garcia-Molina, best known for her Filipino romantic comedies, is set in Hong Kong"
2143,5,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Molina sheds light on the experiences of Filipinos working overseas by following the story of Joy and Ethan, two Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)"
2143,6,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"We see their lives unfold through the eyes of Joy, a hardworking domestic helper who’s trying to save money to move to Canada as a nurse, and Ethan, a bartender trying to find his motivation in life"
2143,7,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Hello, Love, Goodbye stars two of the Philippines’ biggest names from the two of the biggest “loveteams”—Kathryn Bernardo (from KathNiel) and Alden Richards (from AlDub)"
2143,8,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"What’s also surprising is that Bernado and Richards are from rival television networks; in the Philippines, it’s common for actors to be signed to one network exclusively"
2143,9,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Their performance in Hello, Love, Goodbye proves that once in a while, it doesn’t hurt to break out of your loveteam to grow as an artist"

2143,12,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"To get into their roles, Bernardo was separated from the cast to better empathize with Joy’s feelings of isolation; after just a week of filming in Hong Kong, she wanted to go back to the Philippines"
2143,13,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Richards, on the other hand, lost almost 25 kg to play Ethan"
2143,14,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Molina is notorious for her strictness with the artists that she works with—but it’s paid off as they are all household names, and her films have been blockbuster hits"
2143,15,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Hello, Love, Goodbye’s love story is not new, yet it provides us with a unique perspective of the realities of being an overseas worker"
2143,16,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The film tears away the layers of the OFW experience with sheer intensity
2143,17,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Shifting away from showing the employee-employer relationship found in other films about OFWs, Molina brings her focus to the OFWs themselves, and their families back home"
2143,18,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The film strips down the glamor of Hong Kong, as we follow Joy waking up at 5am every day, hustling through the crowded streets of Hong Kong—away from her family, never catching a dream"
2143,19,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,She sits down on top of cardboard boxes on Sundays in Central and juggles taking care of her employer’s daughter and grandmother while selling power banks as a side job (which is actually illegal)
2143,20,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Molina blends drama and clarity in portraying these hardships, and most importantly, tells the “whys"

2143,23,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"We watch as Joy’s friend reminds her cousin to be smart with her money so she can have enough to send back to the Philippines, as the same friend tells her father that she’ll stay two more years because they need the money"
2143,24,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Domestic helpers only earn as little as HK$4,520 (US$576) per month, while working long hours"
2143,25,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"In Joy’s words, if you stop working, your family will starve"
2143,26,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Making sacrifices is almost always a given—a harsh reality if you’re an OFW because you have a responsibility to your family back home
2143,27,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This responsibility that Joy carries is one that resonates with many other OFWs
2143,28,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But OFWs carry out this responsibility at what expense
2143,29,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Similar to Still Human, which also featured a Filipino domestic helper, Joy has a degree in nursing"
2143,30,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"In fact, nursing is a common degree among Filipinos with the hope of working overseas for better pay than what they can get back home"
2143,31,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"As it turns out, nursing is actually the dream that Joy wants to pursue, and being a domestic helper is just a stepping stone to that goal"
2143,32,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Then Ethan comes into the picture
2143,33,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"While a movie following the plight of domestic helpers and OFWs doesn’t really need a romance story, the love story still has a purpose"
2143,34,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Ethan’s character contrasts with Joy’s
2143,35,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"While Joy is hardworking, determined, and knows what she wants in life, Ethan is a happy-go-lucky guy who jumps from one relationship to the next and doesn’t know what he wants in life"
2143,36,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"But his character’s free-wheeling life also echoes Joy’s self-questioning of whether choosing ourselves over our family makes us a disappointment, or selfish"
2143,37,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Joy laments the lack of choice she has in life
2143,38,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"As the family’s breadwinner, her family doesn’t know what she has to endure on a daily basis"
2143,39,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"A nursing graduate that cleans the toilet and eats leftover food—“I’m more than this job, I’m more, and I want to be more,” Joy says"
2143,40,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Surely, this sentiment reflects the many dreams of other overseas Filipino workers"

2143,43,queegqueeg,2021-06-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Even something as minor as buying a snack or not is difficult, because every dollar spent is a dollar you could have saved to give back to your family"

2205,16,soooz,2021-12-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Like if you go out on the streets and ask an ordinary Pinoy any director they know, high chance that you’ll hear Cathy Garcia-Molina, Joyce Bernal, Antoinette Jadaone, which is the exact opposite in the international scene where names like Lav Diaz (deserved tho), Brillante Mendoza, or Erik Matti are more recognized (well Isabel Sandoval too but just referring to the ones based in PH)"
2205,17,soooz,2021-12-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Well, at least female directors are popular amongst the locals haha (unlike in other countries where the local and international scene are still heavily dominated by male directors)"
2205,18,soooz,2021-12-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Anyways, overall I still enjoyed this but istg we really need tighter storylines and perhaps bigger budget for these mainstream movies lmao"

2224,2,ahsb,2022-01-18 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,This was at its best whenever Joy was onscreen as she was perfectly played by Kathryn Bernardo and her character was well developed and interesting
2224,3,ahsb,2022-01-18 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"On the downside, the love story and the various subplots served no purpose and detracted from the overall enjoyment with the final act falling into full-on maudlin, soap opera territory"
2225,1,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,This is one of the best films of Modern FIlipino cinema I would say especially in the field of mainstream media
2225,2,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,It's no surprise that the film is the highest grossing in the Philippines
2225,3,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,I like how Joy's character and how she narrates the film through her eyes
2225,4,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,I like how she's not ashamed to tell her job to one of her friends
2225,5,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,I like how she's so candid in trying to keep herself whole amidst the things that try to crumble her into broken pieces
2225,6,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,I like how she well portrays how awful and difficult it is for people like her to be steps closer in attaining her goals
2225,7,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,This is one of Kath's best roles to date
2225,8,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,I also like how Ethan made it a bit difficult for her to leave Hong Kong after falling into each other's intentions and vulnerabilities
2225,9,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,What's a bit problematic though is Ethan's character especially in the beginning
2225,10,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,It could be a little offsetting if it were to be done to girls in real life with him being a bit pushy when a girl you like is already gate keeping herself from you
2225,11,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,But it's good that there was some character development from him going halfway through the film
2225,12,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,It's nice he understand Joy has big plans to fulfill and he trusts they'll be together in time

2225,14,carlobayan,2022-01-19 06:28:47.912,80.0,ltbx,It makes you question if your own dreams are really worth giving up if you can have another one with the person you love

2234,12,theburkenation,2022-01-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Some of the dialogue is also really unintentionally hilarious, like the scene where a character is berated for opening a bar instead of becoming a doctor or store manager"

2248,3,sircylovesyou,2022-03-09 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,We need to adhere to this concern because the breadwinners were sometimes deprived to live their dreams because of the unexpected weight of responsibility we carry once we earn a degree

2249,2,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Cut to 20 minutes from the end and I am sobbing, SOBBING"
2249,3,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Not what I was expecting at all
2249,4,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"I'll be honest, Ethan's initial pursuit of Joy is maybe questionable, and judging by the most popular review for this film, a lot of people could not see past that, which is a shame, I think"
2249,5,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Once the characters actually connect properly this is a really sweet and lovely romance
2249,6,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"And as much time as that romance does take up, it's not at the expense of Joy as a character"
2249,7,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"She is always at the centre of this story, which is about so much more than a really quite cute love story"
2249,8,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"I wasn't familiar at all with the cultural setting here, but I think there's enough context for everything that it's very easy to understand the employment situations, as well as the family commitments, and all the stress and pressure that comes with that"
2249,9,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Joy and Ethan's situations are different but they're a result of the same social, economic and familial restrictions/obligations, and these things hang over their romance the whole time, which adds a layer of urgency and also sadness to them both"
2249,10,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"There's a scene pretty early on with Joy on a bus, and she bumps into an old college friend, there on his honeymoon, and it's just devastating"
2249,11,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I knew at that point this wasn't the film I was expecting it to be
2249,12,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Kathryn Bernardo is quietly heartbreaking in that scene, and she really does centre this entire film"
2249,13,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"And later when she realises that she's been working towards an unattainable goal for her family, and now she finally gets to have a choice of what happens to her but it's not as simple as she hoped it might be, I was so invested in her that my heart was simultaneously soaring for her, while also breaking"
2249,14,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"There's one or two little things in here that keep it from being 5 stars, but if you can see past Ethan's somewhat questionable initial pursuit of Joy then there's a really beautiful film here"
2250,1,twiceyoursize,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"beside from Alden's creepy character vibes, i really liked the entire movie"
2250,2,twiceyoursize,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,it puts into perspective how life is as a domestic worker in Hong Kong and has some really good romance and comedy scenes :)

2253,8,efdiii_,2022-03-15 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The little colour grading works for this type of film
2253,9,efdiii_,2022-03-15 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Camera works were also on point and engages the audience to the energy of the characters

2256,4,pooploverz69,2022-03-17 11:54:45.252,50.0,ltbx,"The most interesting aspect of this otherwise heinous picture is its idealized portrait of OFW life, which opens questions that are not only timely, but important discussions that need to be had about the Philippine economy and its foreign relations"
2256,5,pooploverz69,2022-03-17 11:54:45.252,50.0,ltbx,The love story is also forgettable

2264,3,komaedanagito,2022-04-03 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"it got better over later on (i guess mostly when joy stopped rejecting ethan so their relationship was less about ethan pestering her, while she wants him to go away) but yeah"

2287,1,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"I think ito na ang extent ng pagiging experimental ng Star Cinema, lol"
2287,2,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"First and foremost, Kathryn Bernardo proved once again that she can evoke whatever emotion she wants from her audience"
2287,3,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"She acts with her eyes, body language, speech tone, just overflowing with passion"
2287,4,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Nakakadala ang performance niya
2287,5,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I don't quite get why every single major family in the film had a member who had some sory of disability
2287,6,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It didn't really contribute anything to the story's development nor was it even explored through dialogue
2287,7,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It felt like an easy excuse to elicit sympathy from the viewers, which is problematic as PWDs have been forever subject to being accessorized in films and tv"
2287,8,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Wasn't a fan of Alden's character
2287,9,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Too shallow imo
2287,10,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"However, Alden himself did a great job in matching Kathryn's splendid acting"
2287,11,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,He was decent enough to keep me engaged
2287,12,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Played it safe on the ending
2287,13,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Of course, it had to have even a tinge of a happy ending because it is a mainstream film and lots of Filipinos consider a film bad if it doesn't have a light or a positive-leaning ending"
2287,14,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It was building up nicely to an emotional climax but the moment Joy and Ethan had that confrontation scene, everything that followed felt like an attempt to repair the sad atmosphere that it produced"
2287,15,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I wish the film maximized that misery and took a full-on drama end
2287,16,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Maybe then it would have more impact
2287,17,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Technicalities were subpar
2287,18,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The film did not look aesthetically pleasing most of the time
2287,19,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Perhaps it wanted to portray the gritty experience of living as a DH in HK, but it could have been better"
2287,20,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Score utterly sucked
2287,21,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The audience does not need to hear a full track while the scenes transpire
2287,22,jimeeeeey,2022-06-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,This is not a music video

2294,6,chesse69,2022-06-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t portray Bernardo and Alden as some people who need your pity—but rather portrays the characters humanely, with stories and experiences that empower them to ultimately choose how to pave their own way for their futures—with or without each other"

2300,1,lanidelrey,2022-07-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"not this movie weaving a La La Land-esque romantic arc around very visceral Filipino experiences - sacrificial romantic and familial love, OFWs (overseas Filipino workers), the eldest daughter being the pillar of the family, caregiving as profession and responsibility, globally dispersed family, survival mode as the only life mode, moving to the US/Canada in hopes to petition your family to move to be together, corny jokes & jumping photoschoosing yourself feels new in the Filipino cultural consciousness, but I’m here for that healthy individualization I’m not taking points off for the cheesy dialogue and dramatic acting because it’s part of the culture"

2309,2,pogij99,2022-07-16 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The climax between Ethan and Joy was surprisingly good and I actually was impressed in the way that it becomes really self-aware about what I think is the biggest crux for a lot of Filipino romcoms about love being the answer, that love will just solve everything and make all the worlds problems go away"

2310,3,spencer_reid11,2022-07-17 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,it's not your typical movie where everything magically falls into place and the female protagonist chooses love over her dreams yet she got her happily ever after

2441,9,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Maybe it's at this crucible where a bachelor--who has no reason to like a woman who doesn't come from money--suddenly becoming obsessed with her that people find truly romantic, but then he admits to later gaslighting and manipulating her the entire time towards the end (but he did it for love"
2441,11,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"That cute montage of them taking selfies all over iconic landmarks in Hong Kong while a Filipino ballad lulls in the background, is supposed to ignite lots of warm feelings in the belly, but for those who didn't buy into this relationship, can feel misplaced"
2441,12,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The only part of the romance I liked were Joy and Ethan's friends cheering their relationship on
2441,13,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Others may see them as one dimensional who act as nothing but cheerleaders, but these Filipino romances know how to make really damn great cheerleading supporting characters that makes you wish you had them in your life"

2442,4,samsaraatkis,2023-02-23 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The male lead was honestly immature and did not carry as much depth as the female MC
2442,5,samsaraatkis,2023-02-23 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,And I kept wanting to explore more of her history and depth
2442,6,samsaraatkis,2023-02-23 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"I honestly wish the movie was longer, enough that we could see her family, friends and their stories more"

2620,1,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,A romance different enough from the formula to make it interesting yet close enough to keep it undeniably familiar
2620,2,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The first third of the film was filled with much promise, dipping its toes on social commentary by exploring the world of Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong"
2620,3,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"In the film’s first conflict, we see Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) deftly running away from police — even hiding in the garbage"
2620,4,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,This must not be her first time
2620,5,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Was this film going to have something to say about the Filipino diaspora
2620,6,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Once it begins to introduce the romance, though, it left that promise to immerse deeply in the tried-and-tested formula"
2620,7,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Which is not such a bad thing
2620,8,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"What’s refreshing about it is its confident departure from two-dimensional, well-defined fantasy"
2620,9,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"An attempt to re-define the ‘Star Cinema romantic film’, as it were"
2620,10,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"I once read about the ‘Star Cinema audience’ ’s rigid expectation of their movies, that they enter the theater fully expecting their ‘happily-ever-after’s and their convenient closures"
2620,11,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"* While I disagree with this sense of non-adventure, it is naïve to discount this insight significant enough to define the film-watching market for generations"
2620,12,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Garcia-Molina’s cache is exactly in catering to this sensibility
2620,13,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The scene of Ethan’s (Alden Richards) introduction is as jarring to Joy as Ethan’s character is to the film
2620,14,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"To be honest, I kept on expecting him to revert to some sort of savior trope in Joy’s life all throughout the film, even in his turn as a toxic Nice Guy in a pivotal moment further in the story"
2620,15,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"To her credit, Garcia-Molina gave Ethan the room to decide realistically and bear the weight of these choices‘ consequences"
2620,16,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It was surprising how natural Richards was able to play Ethan
2620,17,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The writers forced his character to say some purely cheesy lines for the sake of saying them — as lip service to this Twitter generation — but Richards was somehow able to pull it off
2620,18,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,And Bernardo did well enough in her turn as the headstrong Joy that I merely had to stop comparing her to Nadine Lustre and start appreciating what she was giving to the film
2620,19,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The chemistry was there, too, in that I could see them pulling off a dialogue-heavy romance à la THAT THING CALLED TADHANA, which is in no way easy to do"
2620,20,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Those scenes where they were wasting time beside each other were gold
2620,21,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"If our mainstream romance is really shaping up to this mold — influenced by the efforts of Antoinette Jadaone, Dan Villegas, Sigrid Bernardo, and others from the independent scene — then I’m definitely looking forward to more pleasantly-surprising, insightful entertainment"

2696,1,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I appreciate the premise and how it's been told
2696,2,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The realities of being an OFW and how specific it is in the context of the Filipino community in Hong Kong
2696,3,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,What bothered me were two things:1
2696,4,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Is a preference thing, but Alden and Kathryn held their own, but apparently doesn't work together for me"

2696,6,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,And it is a romance so it's kind of fundamental
2696,8,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Is a technical thing - But I was bothered how this was filmed all throughout in 16:9 ratio
2696,9,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I feel like it diminished the scenic appreciation for the location which is Hong Kong
2696,10,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"It could be beautifully picturesque in a theater screen, but with the ratio it felt very TV show"
2696,11,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This is basically me nitpicking but I would appreciate a noticeable difference with TV and movie
2696,12,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"But overall, not a bad watch"
2696,13,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Did it waste my time

2696,15,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Will I consciously choose to watch this again
2696,16,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"To kill time, maybe"
2696,17,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Does it deserve to be the highest grossing Filipino film
2696,19,kuyaed,2023-12-06 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The cast was heavily influencing for that

2878,1,jazsisante7,2024-01-20 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It's not an unusual OFW love story but I liked that it's distinctly advocating for standing up for yourself, being individualistic (Joy still choosing herself & Ethan persisted on building a new chance to live a good life), and taking & earning the ""2nd chances"" in life"
2878,2,jazsisante7,2024-01-20 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It has its problems in regards with the character Ethan (he's pushy and a bit creepy especially in the first part) but regardless, I appreciate that it is realistic to the struggles and situations of being an OFW and the relationship between the couple and the character's family dynamics as well"

2918,2,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It’s more than just a typical romance film because it also explored the struggles and plights that OFWs experience
2918,3,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Plus, it delivered a beautiful message about dreams and why we shouldn’t give up on them despite the setbacks we encounter"

2918,7,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"As the film focused on Joy and Ethan’s love story, many subplots got overshadowed and lost their emotional impact"
2918,8,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The one with Joy’s mother towards the end wasn’t even built up properly

2918,11,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I appreciate the representation but these disabled characters were just… there
2918,12,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,They didn’t serve any crucial purpose apart from highlighting the difficulties in Joy and Ethan’s lives
2918,13,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,And why is it that both of Joy and Ethan’s fathers were disabled
2918,14,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I get that the director may have wanted to portray them as weakened, but frankly, having both of them disabled felt forced"
2918,15,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Also, the portrayal of Annie’s disability is stereotypical"
2918,16,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"-As other reviewers have said, Alden’s character (Ethan) is a big red flag"
2918,17,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I feel like they could’ve written the conflict without making Ethan a red flag character — without making him disregard Joy’s dream
2918,18,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Also, he was creepy in the beginning"

2918,20,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,-Mary Dale’s disappearance subplot was unnecessary
2918,21,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It came out of nowhere and lasted only for a while, which undercut the emotions"
2918,22,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"If they spent more time on it, it would’ve hit harder and would’ve really highlighted Mary Dale’s plight as an OFW"
2918,23,imjustdrey,2024-02-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Nevertheless, despite these criticisms of mine, I really love this film"

2920,9,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,I initially thought the role didn't suit him based on the trailer but he just proved that he's one of the best young actors around

2920,11,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"The supporting cast were all great from Joross Gamboa, Cacai Bautista and Lovely Abella (these 2 were riotous), MaiMai Entrata, Jeffrey Tam, Jameson Blake to veterans Lito Pimentel, Maricel Laxa-Pangilinan and William Lorenzo to even the local Hongkong actors"
2920,12,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,But it was Kathryn Bernardo who surprised me the most
2920,13,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,She really has grown as an actress from her teleserye days
2920,14,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"Since I choose not to see her movies with Daniel Padilla, I never expected her to be so effective and sympathetic as the young woman torn between following her own dreams over love"
2920,15,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,I thought this was more of her movie than Alden's
2920,16,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,(3) The soundtrack
2920,17,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"Moira, Moira, Moira"
2920,18,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,Just hearing her voice in 'Kung 'Di Rin Lang Ikaw' and 'Ikaw At Ako' gave me goosebumps
2920,19,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,And these 2 songs were the perfect soundtrack to Ethan and Joy's love story
2920,20,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,(4) The setting
2920,21,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,Who would've thought that the busy streets of urban Hongkong would look beautiful on the big screen
2920,22,silentcinephile,2024-02-13 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,Kudos to the cinematographer

3109,3,gbrielleaa,2024-04-27 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,it captured the hardships and realities of what DH Filipinos experience on a subtly deep level
3109,4,gbrielleaa,2024-04-27 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,the longing for ‘more’ but you have to remain in that level just because there is a need to provide
3109,5,gbrielleaa,2024-04-27 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"tbh, ethan and joy’s love story was not the main point of this movie; it was more of a side story that helped resurface joy’s character of resilience and strength"
3109,6,gbrielleaa,2024-04-27 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,those characteristics were used by ethan as a stepping stool not to use it against her but to help her

3109,8,gbrielleaa,2024-04-27 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,it was extremely notable how he didnt force her even though he knows he soon can provide and actually just gave her the best possible 3D2N ‘tour’ joy could bring as a memory before she departs
3109,9,gbrielleaa,2024-04-27 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,i love that he didnt stray her away from her independence
3109,10,gbrielleaa,2024-04-27 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"it couldve went to a whole diff direction where they built a life in HK but, direk cathy made it a point to make sure that the viewers heard and saw what she wanted the movie to focus on"
3109,11,gbrielleaa,2024-04-27 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"not ur typical love story, so impactful and so realistic esp to filipinos"
