Hello Love Goodbye,667,5,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maybe they've adapted this deep and hurtful ""hugot"" lines because that's what catches viewer's attention when watching trailers and that's what is used for memes on social media"
Hello Love Goodbye,667,6,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Alden Richards proved to people that he does know how to act
Hello Love Goodbye,667,7,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,He has this charm that can make you swoon but it was not enough for me to feel a spark between him and Kathryn Bernardo
Hello Love Goodbye,667,8,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kathryn just keeps getting better and better
Hello Love Goodbye,667,9,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her acting on this film is way more mature than those of her other films

Hello Love Goodbye,667,11,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,You can really feel that gap during the climax when they were throwing overly dramatic lines with each other
Hello Love Goodbye,667,12,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Cinematography is good especially during the first part and the climax

Hello Love Goodbye,667,14,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Not that crazy about the scoring though
Hello Love Goodbye,667,15,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Filled with long dialogues,and clichés, Hello Love, Goodbye still did not capture the drama of being an OFW in Hongkong"
Hello Love Goodbye,667,16,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It tried, and it did on the first half but ultimately it failed because that part was later merely used as a tool to make a different setting for a love story"
Hello Love Goodbye,667,17,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Being a romantic movie, the film was not something worth remembering"
Hello Love Goodbye,667,18,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even though the hard to get scenes and perseverance to woo the woman are there, it remains on the box of a typical romance flick which we have already seen a number of times"
Hello Love Goodbye,667,19,pigmarked,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It sure adapted a different ending from our most typical Pinoy movie hits back then but the execution of presenting the reason behind it was not that powerful as well

Hello Love Goodbye,1584,2,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s actually pretty good for the most part
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,3,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I still would’ve preferred a slightly different ending that still retains Joy getting to follow her dreams of moving to Canada, but color me surprised even with the positive reactions, I didn’t hate this"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,4,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,As much as I disliked Alden’s character (and his acting
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,5,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I’m so sorry), it’s a great decision to actually have him learn rather than have men like him win in the story even if they are actually wrong"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,6,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Still, I am quite mixed on several aspects of the film"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,7,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Script-wise, for one, I am aware that this is a romance film but I ended up being more interested in the OFW subplot"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,8,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I have merely seen the trailer of Sunday Beauty Queen but parts of this instantly reminded me of that film
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,9,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"To bring forward a topic such as that in a mainstream film is a nice change of pace; however, it is instantly forgotten about and left unexplored by the second half"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,10,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Some may say that the film already needed more time dedicated to the romance plot but I wish it was a little more consequential to tie itself to its OFW subplot
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,11,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The dialogue is a little too on-the-nose at times as well, which can make some scenes feel a little superficial"

Hello Love Goodbye,1584,15,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I am aware that the motifs in the score would always be based off of a mainstream song, but having heard Kung 'Di Rin Lang Ikaw even months before this film's initial release (high school tingz), I find it to be a little overplayed at some points"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,16,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Oh, and louder music doesn't always mean more emotional impact"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,17,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Still, I guess the film's biggest redeeming point is its direction"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,18,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Yes, it's a mainstream romance film, but it offers different flavor through its more mature approach"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,19,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Spotty dialogue aside, the more emotional scenes work well on their own and never feel forced, even if they are a little too on the nose"

Hello Love Goodbye,1584,22,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Some people are probably tired of the comedic 'sidekick' best friend(s) of the lead female character but I personally found Kakai Bautista to be hilarious
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,23,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Not all of her jokes land, but when they do, it's absolutely funny (the Vilma Santos scene probably got the loudest laugh out of me)"

Hello Love Goodbye,1584,26,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Everything said here may have come across as if the negatives outweight the positives but Hello, Love, Goodbye is thankfully saved by Garcia-Sampana's (no longer Garcia-Molina) honest direction and Bernardo's strong acting"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,27,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Perhaps its approach to showing the OFW life in Hong Kong can be shallow, but it's a good first step to bringing that story tied with its main romance plot into a mainstream Filipino film"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,28,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Other aspects are quite weak (God, I'm sorry, but I couldn't stand Alden's acting), and perhaps a slightly different ending would have sufficed, yet by the end of it, it didn't feel poorly-made for the sake of profit"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,29,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"By utilizing the appeal of the two leads from their own different loveteams to tell a new romance story, it gets its point across effectively"
Hello Love Goodbye,1584,30,joshclaude,2024-05-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Once the credits have rolled, I was relieved that I did not hate it, even if it's not quite my thing"

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,44,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I actually like the unusual pairing of the troubled & serious Kathryn Bernardo with the carefree & hypersexual Alden Richards
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,45,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This unusual pairing reminds me of Alexandra de Rossi and Empoy Marquez of Kita Kita
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,46,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The Kathden dynamic in Hello Love Goodbye could have been a more improved, more substantial version of Alempoy in Kita Kita"

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,48,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Only, the Kathden may be something more meaningful than a unusual campy romantic/sexual pairing"
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,50,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The first half of Hello Love Goodbye really sets us up for a promising story that I am eager to watch
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,51,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Until the second half came which quickly abandons this great promising story for Direk Cathy Garcia Molina to POOP to us the standard Star Cinema formulaic SHIT that STINKS already
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,52,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Hello Love Goodbye starts well
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,53,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The film establishes an interesting, heartfelt OFW story, introduces a charismatic, relatable and empowering female Kathryn Bernardo lead character and builds up an uncanny yet endearing relationship between Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards"
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,54,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Am really expecting the real plot to unravel on the second half
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,55,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"However, I got appalled when Hello Love Goodbye suddenly shifts into your typical standard shitty Star Cinema family romcom formula that is so uncalled for"
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,56,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This really RUINED the movie
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,57,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Depriving and ROBBING us of a great story to unravel

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,64,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,So Cathy Garcia Molina still adopts her standard Star Cinema family romcom formula into the promising Hello Love Goodbye story even when the film does not really need it
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,65,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Resulting to a big pile of mainstream Star Cinema SHIT taking over the 2nd half of the film

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,69,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The typical Star Cinema family romcom formula that Direk Cathy Garcia Molina is fond to insert is not bad always
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,70,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This overused family formula does work well for some of the following Cathy Molina's films:1

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,75,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Instead, this Star Cinema formula injected at the middle part of Hello, Love, Goodbye causes a sudden change of the story, making me feel that I am not watching the continuation of its promising first half"
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,76,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"This Star Cinema romcom formula which thrills the Filipino masses, unfortunately causes a big void at the 2nd half of the real promising story of Hello Love Goodbye"
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,77,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Which is TOO BAD and VERY DISAPPOINTING
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,78,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It is really STUPID for Star Cinema ever since to forcibly insert that singular usual repetitive worn-out family romcom formula on most Star Cinema movies of varying stories
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,80,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,SO STUPID INDEED

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,85,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Just like any other typical Star Cinema filmsHello Love Goodbye is so BLOATED
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,87,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Maymay Entrata is so underutilized
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,88,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Although she has a charming potential to have an Pinay HK OFW movie of her own
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,90,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Alden Richards as Ethan's personal existential struggle may not be necessary but should not be emphasized as much as the struggles of Kathryn Bernardo as Joy
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,92,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Alden Richards as Ethan's family should never be one of the main focus of the film

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,96,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Maxine Medina is a beautiful yet useless distraction to the movie
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,98,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Those kilig scenes are so forced upon Alden Richards and Kathryn Bernardo
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,99,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The REAL story does not even require for Ethan and Joy to madly fall in love and become sassy sweethearts

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,103,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,These bloated 2nd half of Hello Love Goodbye gives us unnecessary SHIT while DEPRIVING us of the real stakes of the story that really matter
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,104,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I assume that Cathy Garcia Molina intend to portray the over-glamorized 2nd hour to be Ethan and Joy's existence in the NOW

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,107,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It is actually the real resolution to the existential OFW crisis that both Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards are facing
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,108,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But it is TOO LATE
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,109,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,A big void is left on the 2nd half of the film which fails to bear fruit the promising OFW story that the film first introduces to us

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,113,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,And that is where their prospect about love in the world of constant demands and uncertainties take place
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,114,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,All other supporting characters interact at their minimum as the real Hello Love Goodbye story is soley focused on Alden and Kathryn
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,115,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,This is how the movie should be if it were serious enough to be a great movie
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,116,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I guess Hello Love Goodbye could've worked if it follows the story and cinematic style of Kita Kita
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,117,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"I do wish Cathy Garcia Molina consulted with Sigrid Bernardo on how to make Hello, Love, Goodbye work"

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,119,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Rather than making a great movie which is a worthy follow-up to the great Quezon's Game movie 9/10
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,120,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Star Cinema chose to inject the usual mainstream formulaic SHIT that really leaves a void on the potentially inspiring OFW story which really shortchanges the audience outright
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,123,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"As Hello, Love, Goodbye is an exhibition of Kathryn Bernardo at her bestAlden Richards at first plays a convincing & effective uncanny free-spirited character worthy of a companion for Kathryn Bernardo"
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,124,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Too bad Direk Cathy Garcia Molina fails to handle Alden Richards's good talent well in the film as she foolishly swings his character from a free-spirited sex-crazed playboy into a more serious yet passionate romantic
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,125,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"With this, Alden Richards still performs his best in his previous film, ""Imagine You and Me"" as Direk Mike Tuveria really puts Alden's talent to good use to make the ALDUB film work somehow"
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,126,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"""The Hows Of Us"" may not be a great film"
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,127,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But its strength is its middle part which Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla exhibits that magical romantic feeling artfully around an old house that is really glamorously teasing our emotions
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,128,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Some scenes before that mid-scene and the later scenes after are somewhat unnecessary and could be SHIT
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,129,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But it didn't damage the story for its mid-scene is awesome
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,130,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" is the opposite"
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,131,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The first half and the last 15 minutes of the film are GOLD in the story
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,132,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"However, the middle second half of the film suddenly turns to SHIT which irreversibly DAMAGED the integrity of the entire story and film"

Hello Love Goodbye,1597,134,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The unusually bright lighting on various Hong Kong settings are slightly irritating to the eyes
Hello Love Goodbye,1597,135,chasingmovies,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"I can't really determine if Hello, Love, Goodbye has poor cinematography or Direk Cathy Molina intends to have this visual flaw on purpose to support the real theme & message of the film"
Hello Love Goodbye,1598,1,peteragbayani,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"You can look past through the sappy by it being filled with palpable OFW stories and heartfelt moments of almost every character (that scene when Joy sees her Nursing classmate having his honeymoon in HK, then is asked what is she doing there, what a tearjerker)"
Hello Love Goodbye,1598,2,peteragbayani,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It has many subplots about family, self-worth, career, and brief encounters that can stand alone, but their sum is a surprising and refreshing experience"

Hello Love Goodbye,1599,1,mikkoringia,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It’s actually good
Hello Love Goodbye,1599,2,mikkoringia,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"There were parts of the plot that would make a better, stand-alone film such as Joy and her mother, the tricks for survival for Filipino DHs in HK, among others"
Hello Love Goodbye,1599,3,mikkoringia,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It was understandable that the movie fell for the blockbuster dilemma but in total, I can see how the writing process was thorough, impressive, and a tad frustrating"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,1,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's the specificity that I enjoyed the most
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,2,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There have been many movies about the OFW experience, but this one roots itself in the particulars of the Hong Kong domestic helper"

Hello Love Goodbye,1600,4,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But they labor under a system that seems intent on limiting them
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,5,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"They are given work, certainly, but they aren't free to seek other work"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,6,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,To do so is illegal
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,7,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Joy is pursuing a dream, seeking a life beyond being the absent breadwinner for a family that doesn't feel her suffering"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,8,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And because she wants more, she can't just stay within the very limited lines of her existence, risking arrest and deportation just to scrape together enough money to find a means to a better existence"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,9,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In the margins, we see the internalized tragedy of a people convinced that this is somehow an acceptable situation: veteran domestic helpers constantly telling a neophyte that she'll get used to this life, a phone call back home that's about having to extend a contract another two years"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,10,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And at the center, we learn about Joy's mother, whose tragic situation exemplifies the commodification of the Filipino woman, and the trauma that it brings"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,11,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The relationship stuff is less specific
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,12,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ethan fits into the playboy made good archetype: a lothario who develops real feelings for a girl because she initially rejects him, and then seems to tirelessly pursue her despite her consistent pleas for him to stop"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,13,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That's a lot less interesting, even though there are aspects to Ethan's story that are kind of intriguing as well"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,14,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film bends its story around the fate of their relationship, and it isn't quite able to make it feel weighty enough to stand up to the larger issues that the characters are facing"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,15,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's cute and stuff, but it feels like a distraction from the genuinely incisive examination of the Hong Kong OFW situation"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,16,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But none of that erases all the good that the film does
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,17,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even as the romance takes the fore, the movie is smart enough to make it all feel burdened by the tragedies inherent to a people who have resigned themselves to the reality of a home that can no longer be their home"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,18,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Also, Kathryn Bernardo is great in this"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,19,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Joy is a fully formed character: an industrious young woman who has deferred her dreams under the pretense of a necessary selflessness, struggling under the weight of responsibility all while learning sad truths that will come to shatter her conception of the life she's been pursuing"
Hello Love Goodbye,1600,20,philbertdy,2019-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There's a lot going on there, and Bernardo just takes it all in and makes it work"

Hello Love Goodbye,1610,2,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,The film works best when it follows this premise- when Joy acts as the ´kayod lang ng kayod´ breadwinner of the family and when she desperately searches for ways to support her dream of flying to Canada to seek a job and follow her passion
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,3,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"However, when Ethan (played by Alden Richards) comes into the picture, this premise suddenly shatters, bringing back the movie to its commercial origin"

Hello Love Goodbye,1610,5,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"Fortunately, the film doesn´t settle for that vision alone"
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,6,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"It raises the story, nuanced to experiences by domestic helpers based in Hong Kong, where it is illegal to take another job aside from being a DH"
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,7,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"It also digs deeper, creating a more compelling and informative story about the overseas Filipino workers in Hong Kong"
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,8,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"To this end, the film may be given credit for its thorough research"
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,9,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"THE MIDDLE STUMBLESIt could have been great if the film lived up to that premise and made that nuanced Hong Kong experience as it`s core, but instead it uses the romantic narrative as a way to effectively communicate with its audience"
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,10,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"It is here, in the halfway of the movie, where it fails to function as a compelling narrative piece"

Hello Love Goodbye,1610,12,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"Take for example the Wattpad-ish treatment of Ethan´s character, the way he is perceived as a playboy and later on revealed that he´s not so bad after all because of previous traumas he had encountered, the cringey mix of English and Tagalog to try to create remarkable lines, inserting some product brands into the movie that never really contributes to the story, using some irrelevant sequences and drone shots that make the film look weird and the quality subpar, and most importantly the redundant score that´s being played using different instruments to create a grandiose melodrama just like every Cathy Garcia-Molina film"
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,13,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"Truth be told, there´s really nothing that is compelling in the film´s second part"

Hello Love Goodbye,1610,17,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,The last few minutes of the film however still feels like a long music video

Hello Love Goodbye,1610,19,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"Although, it is in this long sequence where the most delightful shots are shown, it kind of feels just like a long compilation of tourist vlogs rather than an essential part of the story"
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,20,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,Another resurrection comes at the film´s last minute
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,21,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"It brilliantly presents the resolution, bringing it to a powerful last shot reminiscent to that of Alfonso Cuaron´s `Roma´, but more explicitly told"

Hello Love Goodbye,1610,25,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"Alden Richard´s Ethan however feels like a character that was written for Kathryn´s on-screen partner, Daniel Padilla"
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,26,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"Despite this, Alden Richards still plays the role with heart"
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,27,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"Unlike Kathryn´s role, Ethan is not a dramatically demanding character"
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,28,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,This is somehow opposite to Richards´ past roles which never fails to use tears and eye acting as tools for storytelling
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,29,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"In the end, it feels like Alden is only a supporting character in this movie"

Hello Love Goodbye,1610,34,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"However, it does not consistently makes use of that potential, and most of the time it acts like one of those commercial films in the market- settles for the mediocre, and the audience appeal while sacrificing good storytelling"
Hello Love Goodbye,1610,35,ijazzkent,2019-08-02 13:48:10.817,100.0,ltbx,"Despite this, it still should be regarded as a cinematic achievement as it presents a raw aspect of the difficult life abroad despite being a studio-made film"

Hello Love Goodbye,1628,8,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"), the movie redeemed itself after, not just with how the relationship was ultimately executed, but the execution of the film's central message of how loving yourself over everything else is not necessarily a selfish thing"

Hello Love Goodbye,1628,10,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Another thing that I really like is that (without getting into spoilers) the movie could had easily ended in a traditional happy ending
Hello Love Goodbye,1628,11,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They could had easily added a certain scene in the end to do that

Hello Love Goodbye,1628,13,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It made the movie had so much more of an impact at the end (and I already really dug the last ten minutes so that was something)
Hello Love Goodbye,1628,14,btzneb92,2019-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hopefully Star Cinema does keep up this surge of quality and care in its films

Hello Love Goodbye,1868,6,louthe,2020-01-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"What makes it so is the strength of the discourse that astonishingly, marvelously overpowers that of the Star Cinema rom-drama formula that Molina has always gripped onto"
Hello Love Goodbye,1868,7,louthe,2020-01-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It seems to have came at an opportune time, too, considering the state of Hong Kong during the time of its release which makes it a film of considerable significance that brings enlightenment to a wide audience about the OFW experience overseas"
Hello Love Goodbye,1868,8,louthe,2020-01-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film can work and be enjoyed both ways, and that's really where the magic can be found, tasted, and adored"
Hello Love Goodbye,1868,9,louthe,2020-01-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As a social commentary piece about the lives of OFWs in Hong Kong, it's fascinating and moving specially because of how the characters of Joy and Ethan are written with specificity where the drama is stressed and is made impactful"
Hello Love Goodbye,1868,10,louthe,2020-01-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And so, that brings us to the other side of the film that makes the romance that they try to invigorate worth buying into knowing their stories that can pretty much be anyone's"
Hello Love Goodbye,1868,11,louthe,2020-01-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Looking deeper into those two facets of the film, it seems like everything here works fine and well, and indeed it does that it feels like a charm so unbelievable in how it is conceived"
Hello Love Goodbye,1868,12,louthe,2020-01-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Though the film may still fall under the trappings of Cathy Garcia-Molina's films, such as the sappiness of the romance or the movie-like dialogue that takes away an amount of authenticity, they aren't huge hindrances to the film being well-formed"
Hello Love Goodbye,1868,13,louthe,2020-01-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Molina doesn't merely make it all feel like a star vehicle for Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards after all since there's meat given to the characters they play courtesy of co-writers, Carmi Raymundo and Rona Co"
Hello Love Goodbye,1868,14,louthe,2020-01-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It may be unexpected, but believe it or not, the screenplay of the film is astonishingly rich even if the direction isn't as masterful as one would like it to be"

Hello Love Goodbye,1935,5,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,100.0,ltbx,"While the movie does fall trap to some of the cheesiness and tropes (read: Ethan's backstory) that make the aforementioned typical local romcom weak, it manages to bring a depth to its characters, including l Hong Kong itself, that usually escapes mainstream blockbusters"
Hello Love Goodbye,1935,6,issatong,2020-07-05 16:28:56.854,100.0,ltbx,This is exemplified in Joy's character

Hello Love Goodbye,1937,2,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Straightforward as this title is, whatever the complications and heartbreak in Cathy Garcia-Molina's latest romantic tragedy, they can't be any heavier than the story that has to be behind Kathryn Bernardo not playing opposite Daniel Padilla"

Hello Love Goodbye,1937,4,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Bernardo plays a free-spirited domestic worker in Hong Kong, with a diverse network of friends that - don't worry, Filipino conservatives upset about an onscreen couple not being married offscreen - isn't too diverse"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,5,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She naturally hits it off with a handsome fellow Philippines expat, an ambitious bartender looking to lay some roots down in the city our woman can't wait to get the heck out of"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,6,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As the two begin to look to their seemingly temporary friendship to help them weather the Hong Kong hustle, it becomes clearer that they have ideas to spend their lives together, and extremely different ideas about how to"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,7,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As the title plainly tells you, this story won't work out, but it is charming, way to a fault"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,8,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I mean, this is clearly just another trite and sappy romantic-comedy-drama, of little consequence and even less surprise, with a runtime of two hours"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,9,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This doesn't want to be ""just another"", as it lives up to its title by methodically examining the process of a potentially doomed romance with the intimacy and draw of a prestige love story"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,10,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There's more potential on paper than you'd think, but of course it's all hijacked by overwrought rom-com sensibilities, especially with bouncy pacing and gratingly corny, relentless music"

Hello Love Goodbye,1937,12,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Lasaten's score sucks, and it's just about omnipresent throughout an authentically paced drama to bring out the inauthenticity of its melodramatic situations, frilly farce and general genericism"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,13,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The script doesn't help with its quirky sense of humor and hearty or histrionic breakthroughs, all cheapening substance that is just full enough to water down that punch-up"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,14,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That script may only feel obligated to pander to the lowest common denominator, but it sits between the tritest of romantic melodramedies and the most cloying of aesthetics"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,15,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The average rom-com viewer may also get bored with the runtime, so of course I find more compelling than the average rom-com"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,16,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There's certainly a unique enough romance in the gorgeous, ever-bustling backdrop of Hong Kong explored extensively as its own character"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,17,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This scope is more than enough to liven up this intimate love story
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,18,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"but just to be safe, let's overshoot the environment, overwork the editors, and overplay an oppressively corny score"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,19,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There's nothing refreshing or challenging about this shameless fluff piece, but its themes are a little more grown-up than usual, more frank about the chore of reconciling romantic interests with personal ones"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,20,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Histories of failures and potentials for success are heavily debated and approached in this two-hour dual-character study, at a methodical clip that may bore certain viewers without the fallback of zanily colorful supporting characters"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,21,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"They bring some laughs, and texture the personalities of lead characters who are spoiled by their own, more mundane humor and quite a few humiliatingly cheesy bearings of soul"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,22,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Besides that, their motivations and relationship turns are thoroughly, even complexly drawn, and tightened under the solid chops and crisp chemistry of the beautiful Kathryn Bernardo and the handsome Alden Richards"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,23,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This takes the time to build a genuine human drama, but it's squandered on meager fluff"
Hello Love Goodbye,1937,24,cameronwjohnson,2020-07-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Between the ready-made claptrap and the meanderingly thoughtful romantic dual-character study, the former pretty much prevails on grating music, style, comedy and melodrama, with enough entertaining sprawl in the lavish Hong Kong setting, more colorful characters and endearing flair, and enough real nuance in the characters, their relationship and the performances, to make Cathy Garcia-Molina's ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" a touchingly heartfelt, just as abrasively disingenuous romantic melodramedy"

Hello Love Goodbye,1943,2,dibidi,2020-08-09 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,so it’s misogynist as well
Hello Love Goodbye,1943,3,dibidi,2020-08-09 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"the tragedy here is that there is a much better story buried here about joy’s life working as a domestic helper in an all woman household, a cousin who is having a more difficult time adjusting to life as an OFW, and a mother who was essentially sold off into marriage by her father who chooses to stay with her abusive husband regardless"
Hello Love Goodbye,1943,4,dibidi,2020-08-09 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,all of that is ignored for a mediocre love story that doesn’t add anything to the genre nor give a good example of what being in a relationship should be

Hello Love Goodbye,1961,8,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I especially dislike one of the lady friends - the one with the thick Visayan accent
Hello Love Goodbye,1961,9,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The accent was obviously put on as some form of comedic relief
Hello Love Goodbye,1961,10,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But it was not funny; it was extremely annoying
Hello Love Goodbye,1961,11,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,No real Visayan talks like that

Hello Love Goodbye,1961,13,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"He works in a TV network that I hate, so I’ve never really seen him act that much"
Hello Love Goodbye,1961,14,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Anyway, I’ve been trying to figure out what’s different about his face"
Hello Love Goodbye,1961,15,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"He’s handsome, for sure; but I just couldn’t put a finger on that one thing that’s different until I saw him in this movie"
Hello Love Goodbye,1961,16,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I know it now — he has a very shallow, barely there philtrum"
Hello Love Goodbye,1961,17,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maybe from the years of wearing braces, his upper lip flattened out"
Hello Love Goodbye,1961,18,cesandpooh,2020-09-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Anyway, Kathryn was good"

Hello Love Goodbye,1963,4,anadominiquea,2020-10-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Joy was such a strong character which Bernardo was just enough to portray
Hello Love Goodbye,1963,5,anadominiquea,2020-10-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I could imagine other actresses who would be able to give justice to the same role
Hello Love Goodbye,1963,6,anadominiquea,2020-10-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I was not surprised at how Bernardo was able to incredibly pull off that “What if I choose not to stay

Hello Love Goodbye,1963,9,anadominiquea,2020-10-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Ethan, on the other hand, was a bad character and Richards was not able to make it any better"
Hello Love Goodbye,1963,10,anadominiquea,2020-10-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I hated how they had to used “Anak” to emphasize the struggles of OFWs

Hello Love Goodbye,1982,2,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Against the backdrop and introspective of our country's modern day heroes, the OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers) specifically domestic helpers in Hong Kong, the film was able to bank on even more emotions than expected"
Hello Love Goodbye,1982,3,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Life in Hong Kong is not easy more so for the domestic helpers who are unable to improve their lives even if they wanted to

Hello Love Goodbye,1982,10,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,How it accomplishes this is by pretty much making outstanding work on the basics
Hello Love Goodbye,1982,11,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"First and foremost, the central characters of Ethan and Joy were well-written and well-scripted"

Hello Love Goodbye,1982,14,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Beyond that, both characters had great actors and performances behind them that gave these characters much life and much justice"

Hello Love Goodbye,1982,19,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, we felt that the film failed to establish more emotions on this introspective"
Hello Love Goodbye,1982,20,reeladvicenet,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While it had some unnerving revelations about the domestic helper life, most of these have been tackled better in other films previously"

Hello Love Goodbye,1988,6,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, very un-Star Cinema-esque is its approach to the struggle of our OFWs and I respect it for that"
Hello Love Goodbye,1988,7,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Joy's character is solid and human, the driving force of the film despite the cringey corniness of her ""romance"""
Hello Love Goodbye,1988,8,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Kathryn deserves all the praise and her chemistry with Alden was surprising, especially in the early days of their ~love story~"
Hello Love Goodbye,1988,9,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The only real gripe I have against this film is how severely underdeveloped Ethan's character was
Hello Love Goodbye,1988,10,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"He didn't deserve the quotation markable dialogue in the end, because he learned so little even when the lesson was staring right at him"
Hello Love Goodbye,1988,11,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Overall, I loved Joy's story"
Hello Love Goodbye,1988,12,pinklights,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It separates itself from the usual martyrdom leading ladies in romantic films usually take on
Hello Love Goodbye,1989,1,mnugaspar,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Strong opening scene
Hello Love Goodbye,1989,2,mnugaspar,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I liked the camerawork and how it captured the repetitive and lonely life of someone named Joy
Hello Love Goodbye,1989,3,mnugaspar,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"From then on, HLG is mostly formulaic"
Hello Love Goodbye,1989,4,mnugaspar,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kathryn Bernardo shines but some of her lines sounded too melodramatic
Hello Love Goodbye,1989,5,mnugaspar,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I think Alden Richards’ character was underdeveloped - and while this has made me expect less of him, his Ethan leaves a lot to be desired"
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,1,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's the bothering solitude of my Christmas eve evening that led me to watch this
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,2,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kathryn surely deserved that acting award for this film because she single-handedly carried it
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,3,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Alden too carried for some parts but then again I can't say that much for a character I didn't like
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,4,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The plot about OFWs hurts because it's honest but the way it's written is loose especially Ethan's backstory
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,5,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Cannot pity a guy like him
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,6,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They had a chance na rin naman to showcase Hong Kong as a place na shithole for domestic helpers or a tourist area pero parang di ko naman masyado nakita sa film
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,7,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Screw the drone shots as well
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,8,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Also the script, god, the script"
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,9,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I speak in Taglish rin naman but their dialogues are really fictional because if you talk like that in real life then I am actually judging you
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,10,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Scoring bothered me too because I like the silence of films especially kapag mabigat na yung batuhan
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,11,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sorry to the music director but I will not feel anything kapag nilapatan niyo ng overplayed song yan; why can't we just compose new soundtracks for new films
Hello Love Goodbye,1990,12,interheaven,2020-12-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In summary, I give licenses to Kathryn & Alden's fans by presenting this film as proof for their acting calibre then I will snatch it back once they start speaking how good it was"

Hello Love Goodbye,1992,2,bianx,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I wish this movie was more about Joy because it shines when it's about her struggles in HongKong and her trying her utmost best to be more and have more in life because I love ambitious women like that
Hello Love Goodbye,1992,3,bianx,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"No offense to Alden Richards but full offense to the writers, the movie lost me the moment Ethan's creepy and pushy ass showed up"
Hello Love Goodbye,1993,1,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Two stars para sa acting ni Kathryn na bumuhat ng pelikula at para sa chemistry nina Kathryn at Alden

Hello Love Goodbye,1993,3,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,So I just watched a pretty good movie before this (Fan Girl by Jadaone) so ramdam ko yung contrast ng good vs not so good film
Hello Love Goodbye,1993,5,ellekaie,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Masyadong ""in your face"" yung music"

Hello Love Goodbye,1998,1,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"For a Star Cinema fare, the best thing this film does is to finally not force a happy ending to please its target audience"
Hello Love Goodbye,1998,2,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That was my biggest issue with Cathy-Grace Molina’s previous film, The Hows of Us — resolving all conflicts in order to reach a happy ending that feels fake"
Hello Love Goodbye,1998,3,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Make no mistake, this film is also boggled down by the same trite and cheesy writing (Making Kath’s and Alden’s character an official couple is so forced), overblown musical score, and emotionally manipulative sequences that have plagued the quality of Star Cinema films for the past few years"
Hello Love Goodbye,1998,4,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, this film is effective as a drama that talks about Filipino Diaspora"
Hello Love Goodbye,1998,5,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It even takes away the usually bright gloss aesthetic of a Star Cinema film; which I loved
Hello Love Goodbye,1998,6,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There’s a sense of realism at play
Hello Love Goodbye,1998,7,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It shines at moments when it doesn’t delve on the romance, but on the struggles faced by Filipinos working abroad"
Hello Love Goodbye,1998,8,aksn_red,2020-12-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,When we are shown how these Filipinos find ways to cope up and form a stronger bond as a community of overseas workers — the film is at its most human

Hello Love Goodbye,2107,1,lezard,2021-04-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Will people love this film as much if someone else played the role of Joy
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,1,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,A surprisingly affecting romantic drama about the large community of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,2,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"This is something that has been recently explored as a more heart warming drama with Oliver Siu Kuen Chan and Anthony Wong's excellent Still Human, however here we have a similar situation but shown almost entirely from the Filipino workers perspective and with a significant romantic plot"
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,3,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Through central character Joy, who wants to be a nurse, but is forced into the domestic helper lifestyle like her mother, it looks at the difficulties and exploitation inherent in these worker's arrangements"
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,4,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Paid a pittance, and treated appallingly by their employers and the state, this film examines how they can be trapped into this existence and life, allowing them to send a bit of money home to family in the Philippines that they only speak to via video calls, promising a reunion that will never happen"
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,5,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"There's an excellent movie in here, but the film stumbles significantly when introducing Joy's love interest, barman Ethan"
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,6,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"While it may appear like this film is going to be a standard romantic comedy, it's not really, and Ethan's initial characterisation is straight out of a lunatic American rom-com"
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,7,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"After being introduced by pretending to be immigration police and arresting Joy, he's harassing and calling her constantly, that even within the constraints of a romantic comedy (which this isn't"
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,8,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"), he's basically a stalker"
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,9,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It's a shame that the film goes down this initial cliched route, after introducing Ethan's character for the next twenty minutes, because at it's core, and once Ethan stops behaving like a lunatic, it's a genuinely tender and quite tragic film about a doomed romance, and about how Filipino immigrants to Hong Kong are never made to feel part of society"
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,10,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The films portrayal of both Ethan's father and Joy's parents is well done, and very sympathetic, which makes it more frustrating that they wasted so much time with Ethan's initial character, when they could have skipped that and presented him as he appears for the last hour of the film"
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,11,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It's filmed on the streets and alleys of Hong Kong, and all extremely recognisable and vivid, clearly made by someone who understands the areas, full of classic ""oh yeah, I know where they are"" moments"
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,12,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Surprisingly bittersweet ending too
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,13,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"This is mostly an excellent film, that's dragged down unnecessarily by the initial appearance of Ethan - made even more frustrating that they roll that characterisation back"
Hello Love Goodbye,2108,14,georgedcc,2021-04-16 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Still, definitely worth my time, and a lot better than I expected (but it could have been just that bit better)"

Hello Love Goodbye,2110,6,kalidyllic,2021-04-22 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i’m not going to downgrade the film just because alden’s character is ‘toxic’

Hello Love Goodbye,2249,5,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Once the characters actually connect properly this is a really sweet and lovely romance

Hello Love Goodbye,2249,9,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Joy and Ethan's situations are different but they're a result of the same social, economic and familial restrictions/obligations, and these things hang over their romance the whole time, which adds a layer of urgency and also sadness to them both"
Hello Love Goodbye,2249,10,theshiftyshadow,2022-03-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There's a scene pretty early on with Joy on a bus, and she bumps into an old college friend, there on his honeymoon, and it's just devastating"

Hello Love Goodbye,2441,1,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A story in two layers
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,2,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The first is with Joy and her experiences as a Filipino overseas domestic helper living in Hong Kong
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,3,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"We not only delve into her journey of wanting a better life for her and her family, but we also get a glimpse of this particular subculture of Filipinos living in Hong Kong, who have carved out a little community for themselves away from their home"
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,4,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Between poor pay, long hours of work, and shuffling through countless jobs and hustles to make ends meet, seeing these workers come together to host their own makeshift beauty pageant, or weeping together as they're watching Filipino dramas on someone's phone while they're in the middle of illegally peddling retail, it's those small moments of solidarity that adds a charming touch"
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,5,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It adds an extra dimension to this life that isn't just all doom, gloom, and abuse (and sadly there's a lot of it) to make you sympathize with their struggle"
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,6,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The second layer is a Wattpad fueled, Twilight charged romance full of the same toxic tropes with the weird stalking and complete disregard for boundaries"
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,7,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"They made sure to make Ethan seem like such a bad boy who can get any woman he wants (and they display this by his friends joking around about how all his flings are named after a day in the week), yet he drops them all for Joy because"
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,8,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I don't know actually
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,9,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maybe it's at this crucible where a bachelor--who has no reason to like a woman who doesn't come from money--suddenly becoming obsessed with her that people find truly romantic, but then he admits to later gaslighting and manipulating her the entire time towards the end (but he did it for love"
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,11,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That cute montage of them taking selfies all over iconic landmarks in Hong Kong while a Filipino ballad lulls in the background, is supposed to ignite lots of warm feelings in the belly, but for those who didn't buy into this relationship, can feel misplaced"
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,12,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The only part of the romance I liked were Joy and Ethan's friends cheering their relationship on
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,13,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Others may see them as one dimensional who act as nothing but cheerleaders, but these Filipino romances know how to make really damn great cheerleading supporting characters that makes you wish you had them in your life"
Hello Love Goodbye,2441,14,kabloke,2023-02-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Now if only these male leads can actually be decent guys for once

Hello Love Goodbye,2442,4,samsaraatkis,2023-02-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The male lead was honestly immature and did not carry as much depth as the female MC
Hello Love Goodbye,2442,5,samsaraatkis,2023-02-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And I kept wanting to explore more of her history and depth
Hello Love Goodbye,2442,6,samsaraatkis,2023-02-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I honestly wish the movie was longer, enough that we could see her family, friends and their stories more"
Hello Love Goodbye,2442,7,samsaraatkis,2023-02-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They clearly have their own stories that are reminiscent of all the Non-chinese hongkongers who sacrifice everything to suffer in a foreign nation for money
Hello Love Goodbye,2442,8,samsaraatkis,2023-02-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The opening montage is so good and reminded of Kimi No Nawa's

Hello Love Goodbye,2620,1,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,A romance different enough from the formula to make it interesting yet close enough to keep it undeniably familiar
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,2,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The first third of the film was filled with much promise, dipping its toes on social commentary by exploring the world of Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong"
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,3,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"In the film’s first conflict, we see Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) deftly running away from police — even hiding in the garbage"

Hello Love Goodbye,2620,5,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Was this film going to have something to say about the Filipino diaspora
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,6,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Once it begins to introduce the romance, though, it left that promise to immerse deeply in the tried-and-tested formula"

Hello Love Goodbye,2620,8,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"What’s refreshing about it is its confident departure from two-dimensional, well-defined fantasy"
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,9,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"An attempt to re-define the ‘Star Cinema romantic film’, as it were"
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,10,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"I once read about the ‘Star Cinema audience’ ’s rigid expectation of their movies, that they enter the theater fully expecting their ‘happily-ever-after’s and their convenient closures"
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,11,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"* While I disagree with this sense of non-adventure, it is naïve to discount this insight significant enough to define the film-watching market for generations"
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,12,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Garcia-Molina’s cache is exactly in catering to this sensibility
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,13,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The scene of Ethan’s (Alden Richards) introduction is as jarring to Joy as Ethan’s character is to the film
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,14,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"To be honest, I kept on expecting him to revert to some sort of savior trope in Joy’s life all throughout the film, even in his turn as a toxic Nice Guy in a pivotal moment further in the story"
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,15,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"To her credit, Garcia-Molina gave Ethan the room to decide realistically and bear the weight of these choices‘ consequences"
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,16,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It was surprising how natural Richards was able to play Ethan
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,17,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The writers forced his character to say some purely cheesy lines for the sake of saying them — as lip service to this Twitter generation — but Richards was somehow able to pull it off
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,18,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,And Bernardo did well enough in her turn as the headstrong Joy that I merely had to stop comparing her to Nadine Lustre and start appreciating what she was giving to the film
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,19,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The chemistry was there, too, in that I could see them pulling off a dialogue-heavy romance à la THAT THING CALLED TADHANA, which is in no way easy to do"
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,20,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Those scenes where they were wasting time beside each other were gold
Hello Love Goodbye,2620,21,marckie,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"If our mainstream romance is really shaping up to this mold — influenced by the efforts of Antoinette Jadaone, Dan Villegas, Sigrid Bernardo, and others from the independent scene — then I’m definitely looking forward to more pleasantly-surprising, insightful entertainment"
