61,1,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"There used to be a time when the powers-at-be were trying to convince people that Daniel Padilla was cool, casting him as the broody teenage bad-boy that had to be won over by the steely determination of his good-girl paramour Kathryn Bernardo"
61,2,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"But he's not cool, at least in that way"
61,3,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"He's got a big goofy smile, a friendly presence, and an earnestness that gives his characters surprising vulnerability"
61,4,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"His growth as an actor largely involves him being comfortable up on screen, being some version of himself that's closer to who he really is"
61,5,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"And this leads to the best bits of this movie, which almost seem to happen in a vacuum of narrative"
61,6,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It doesn't matter what came before or what might happen after
61,7,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"In the moment, it just looks like these two kids are enjoying themselves"
61,8,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Kathryn Bernardo hasn't quite kept up with Padilla's development, her performances getting a little stiffer as she gets older, but their clear affection for one another smooths out a lot of these scenes"
61,9,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,But these moments don't actually exist in a vacuum
61,10,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"There's a movie around it, and like so many local big romcoms, there are just too many things going on"
61,11,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"All the classic formula markers are there, too: some sort of medical problem, some parental issues and a whole bunch of characters that exist purely to tell the leads what they're supposed to be feeling"
61,12,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The movie stretches into two hours with the added weight of these rote elements, and by the time they fly off to some foreign land, it kind of feels like an entirely different movie"
61,13,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It shifts focus completely, and starts filling in even more backstory through yet another character that just says everything outright"
61,14,philbertdy,2018-08-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The story they end up telling is actually pretty simple, but there are just so many other things that crowd out the much more affecting core of this story: two people still clearly in love with each other, just trying to overcome the hurt that also still exists between them"

128,3,chzzzie,2019-04-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Little bit disappointed because the trailer was really slight misleading
128,4,chzzzie,2019-04-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The only problem for me, was the phasing of the movie"
128,5,chzzzie,2019-04-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"At first, it gave us some very dramatic and heart wrenching moments but at the 2nd and 3rd act it just gave us some typical Filipino Rom-Com moments but the ending is definitely the best part of the movie"
128,6,chzzzie,2019-04-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Still a great movie though
129,1,iamtylerdurden,2019-04-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The movie has its moments, good ones, but these moments are already included in a repetitive formula for Romantic Comedies, something you've already seen before"
129,2,iamtylerdurden,2019-04-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Star Cinema only seldom takes risks on bringing their stories as close to reality as possible, and this movie is not one of them"

133,3,iamphilsm,2019-05-04 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,This film could be more realistic if the usual Star Cinema tropes were excluded

140,1,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I don't know if I have nearly as many questions about how this couple happened than I do about the one in ""She's Dating a Gangster"""
140,2,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"This onscreen romance between Kathryn Benardo and Daniel Padilla can only be healthier than their last one under Cathy Garcia-Molina, but we're still talking about an aspiring musician and a medical student moving in together after she inherits her great aunt's hows-I mean house"
140,3,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I don't know how mature the film itself is with that wordplay in the title, so of course it's not too long before the med student gets tired of supporting the bum"
140,4,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Years later, ""he just happens"" to return declaring that he is a ""changed man"", but at least sticks around when he discovers that his ex-girlfriend blew up her medical career to whine about breaking up with her boyfriend"
140,5,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"As if that's not unhealthy enough, after they ruined their first relationship with too much pressure, they have to start a new one by selling the house and finding the female lead's estranged father before her brother goes blind from diabetes"
140,6,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Along the way, they figuratively return to the debate club where they literally met to assess the ""hows"" that will save these lovers, even though the only one that counts is that they're played by Kathryn Benardo and Daniel Padilla"
140,7,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Filipino cinema's hottest power couple are sure to draw a crowd to what bickering they can manage, but the film still has to pander to them to oblivion"
140,8,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The masses might be a bit thrown off by the film's wildly convoluted nonlinear storytelling, and even then, it's mostly hard to keep up with the rapid-fire progression of the characters' arc settling into the house and adapting to their draggier reunion some years later"
140,9,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Something as overdramatic as a flashback structure mostly just shows how contrived this thing is, as a simplistic melodrama that forces conflict in the flashback storyline to spice up an initially ""happy"" home and facilitate its downfall, and blows the reunion arc on either randomly searching for an estranged father or a grown-ass doctor screaming about the ""tragedy"" of getting dumped"
140,10,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"This film deals with some pretty sophisticated themes on how individuals are complexly shaped by their relationship, and although fairly likable character undergo a lot of change, it's all undone by those ""I can't live with you"" confrontations and ""I can't live without you"" declarations"
140,11,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"It's never a particularly well-written romp, of course, the comedy being almost singularly embarrassingly juvenile screwball banter with friends or cutesy shenanigans with the couple, whose romantic interplays are devalued by sexual tension and saccharine dramatic progression"
140,12,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"For the film to talk about moving into an adult relationship, this is in no way an adult movie, with Cathy Garcia-Molina being just one of many writers on a flimsy committee, and giving up on carrying this above that as directress"
140,13,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"As full-hearted as her frantic overstylization, over-scoring, overpacing and overall overhandedness are, it's yet more grating pandering that wears down a superficial romantic dramedy"
140,14,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"It's just a fluff piece, and it's sure to please the crowd, sometimes with actually tasteful elements"
140,15,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The wooded suburban house is a key character, and a comely one at that, with a beauty and humility beaming with some of the truest romance in the atmosphere of a film all about the hassle of a couple settling down"
140,16,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"This sentimental tone is carried over by Jessie Lasaten's sweetly bright score and Noel Teehankee's dreamily polished cinematography, but without the maturity naturally inherent in that home"
140,17,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Cathy Garcia-Molina's direction just keeps going too far with the romantic disposition, but no matter how cloying this gets, there's always such honesty in such fiery emotion"
140,18,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"As melodramatic as the film gets, there are times when Garcia-Molina is simply owning up to that with her dreamy sentiments, trusting that the cheese will be grounded by the admittedly fairly solid character factor"
140,19,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"It's a romantic drama about growing up that is in no way grow-up, until there comes a point in both the flashback and present-day segments when the characters really start to break through, losing a grip of their prospects under the pressure of making a home, then reuniting some time later to further contemplate how they function as a unit"
140,20,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Juxtaposing these two processes deepen fairly sharp themes on understanding the differences between healthy dependency and toxic codependency; sacrificing your own prospects and supporting someone else's; and succumbing to the burden of a serious relationship and giving it time to breathe
140,21,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I can tell you one thing: it's getting hard to see Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla functioning without each other, their radiant chemistry continuing to flourish alongside their bubbly charms and often surprisingly piercing emotional forces, as they try to hold together a film that is having a harder time managing fluff with true maturity"
140,22,cameronwjohnson,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The nonlinear narrative is just part of the incessant contrivances that devalue a would-be mature love story, but not like the grating humor, histrionics and overstylization that render this strict pandering, with enough charm in its craft and punch-up, if not enough depth in its character developments and the leads' chemistry, to save Cathy Garcia-Molina's ""The Hows of Us"" a likably farcical romantic drama that warms your heart in some places and leave it cold in others"

208,3,pezka,2020-07-20 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The beginning was so promising, may pa-slow motion pa, but it wasn't consistent"
208,4,pezka,2020-07-20 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Also, I'm curious as to how and why they make the audio in these types of films"
208,5,pezka,2020-07-20 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,There's something about how voices are amplified too much or smoothened out
208,6,pezka,2020-07-20 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Sometimes, it looks like it was dubbed which I find disturbing"

209,1,makilim,2020-08-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"While the start and main problem were promising, the formulaic resolution was very disappointing"
209,2,makilim,2020-08-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I just don't get the point of already starting with the post-breakup, and then showing the redeeming value of Primo was with him all along, even before the breakup, as if pointing out that it was all a misunderstanding"
209,3,makilim,2020-08-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,This subtly puts the blame on George for not knowing that Primo was actually a good man (she should have just trusted him
209,5,makilim,2020-08-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This should have been a film about HOW Primo acknowledges his accountability and redeems himself, and HOW George finally finds in herself the courage to forgive and love again"
209,6,makilim,2020-08-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"That would have been less formulaic, less harmful, and most probably very endearing"
209,7,makilim,2020-08-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Also, what's with the exaggerated acting"
209,8,makilim,2020-08-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Almost all of them are good to great actors (except of course for Espanto), and yet most of them were also over the top"
209,9,makilim,2020-08-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I think, because they have proven in their other projects that they can act, that it's a directorial problem"
209,10,makilim,2020-08-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Which is also suprising, given that this is Garcia-Molina we are talking about"
210,1,heysol,2020-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,the only thing i don't like about this movie is that we all know that their relationship is already toxic and yet we are being forced to root for that said couple
210,2,heysol,2020-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"but i also believe that there is a room for change and development for one's self, and both george & primo showed that they did become better people"
210,3,heysol,2020-08-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,anyway 1 star because this movie almost made me cry

218,2,jojokuneho,2020-09-28 21:36:35.782,40.0,ltbx,they look like kids
219,1,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is the first Kathniel project i ever truly liked — loved even
219,2,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In typical Star Cinema fashion, the movie starts with a chaotic scene depicting hyperactive leads that, somehow, lose that hyperactivity through the rest of the film"
219,3,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In another typical Star Cinema fashion, insert the need to shoot in a foreign country"
219,4,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I have to be honest, though — those Amsterdam scenes could have also panned out effectively if shot in some remote province in the Philippines"
219,5,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But, yeah, I know Amsterdam doesn’t require permits for filming there, so I guess Star Cinema took the opportunity to film and have a European vacation at the same time"
219,6,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Typical Filipino showbusiness tactic

219,8,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It did the job for this movie, though"
219,9,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It worked as a story device that did not feel forced
219,10,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Anyway, Kathryn and Daniel have both really matured in this movie"
219,11,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Especially Kathryn — in all her previous movies where she was supposed to play an adult, she didn’t quite do so well"
219,12,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I mean, acting-wise, she did"
219,13,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But in terms of looks, she always looked like some teenager and, sometimes, even a child"
219,14,cesandpooh,2020-09-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,So I commend the styling team for doing a good job with her look for “The How’s of Us”

242,3,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I saw him grow as an actor from the same bad boy teenager roles since Growing Up, and his comfortability on screen makes him better"
242,4,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"What I do not like about the film is the same medical-related subplot, the parental issues, friends/family conflicts"
242,5,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Same Cathy Garcia-Molina formula
242,6,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Same Filipino romcom formula
242,7,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,What made this film better though is how warm and pleasant Kathryn and Daniel act together
242,8,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Their chemistry made this film work
242,9,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I would have loved this more if the film focuses on Primo and George's story
242,10,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"More scenes during their stay on Tita Lola's house, what happened after Primo left, and after Primo came back"
242,11,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It's like the Barcelona: A Love Untold
242,12,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Too many sub-stories that could have been deleted
242,13,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Overall, I love it"
242,14,faatrckarc,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,THIS IS DANIEL PADILLA'S MOVIE

243,2,jjlynx,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,” Sakit
244,1,miggyber,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,hindi talaga ako naging invested kay primo
244,2,miggyber,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,ang annoying niya para sa akin kahit sinubukan nilang iredeem siya halfway
244,3,miggyber,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,si mikko lang may sense na karakter sa pelikulang ito
245,1,ledzepolin,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,tumutulo pa rin sipon ko habang tinatype to pero ok  also: kathryn carried
246,1,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"At two hours long, ""The Hows of Us"" was limited severely by so much bloat and so many tropes that it really made us wonder why they just didn't tell a straightforward story in the first place"
246,2,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"But don't get us wrong though, it wasn't a bad experience at all and we actually found ourselves liking this film much more than we anticipated"
246,3,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But its barely middling middle section should have been reworked maybe even removed
246,4,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"For years, Jo (Kathryn Bernardo) and Primo (Daniel Padilla) had a long-lasting relationship so much so that when Jo’s Aunt died, she left her house to the both of them"
246,5,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"But with Primo, a budding musician, failing to attain the success that he feels he is beholden to and with Jo feeling that Primo’s failures are holding her back, Primo abandons Jo all by herself"
246,6,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,A few years pass by when Primo suddenly shows up and wants to fix the wrongs he has done in the past - including his relationship with Jo
246,7,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But this isn’t as simple as it sounds as Jo plans to sell their house soon and hasn’t really forgiven and forgotten that Primo left her to fend for herself
246,8,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,We must admit that “The Hows of Us” left us with a heavy dose of mixed feelings
246,9,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"On one hand, its narrative and story really had potential to be substantially and emotionally moving"
246,10,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But the film also suffers because it felt it needed to do genre tropes within its story that was just unnecessary
246,11,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"For example, there’s a parent or sibling who suffers a sickness in the most opportune time or simply travelling to a foreign country"
246,12,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,We wished it just told a more straightforward and down-to-earth story - one that we could actually imagine happening in real-life and not one obviously written for the big screen
246,13,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"While the overall narrative was bloated, the film actually had bright spots"
246,14,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"In fact, the first thirty minutes and last thirty minutes were outstanding in our opinion"
246,15,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It had us gripping our seats with emotionally moving moments
246,16,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Of course, these scenes were bolstered by the great chemistry and acting between Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla"
246,17,reeladvicenet,2020-10-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Overall though, “The Hows of Us” will make you swoon in key moments and if that’s what you’re after, you’ll actually find it a story worth experiencing"

252,2,rmvjre,2020-10-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Hindi naman sa pagiyak lang nakikita ang pag arte
252,3,rmvjre,2020-10-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Also, kailangan talaga laging umuulan pag dramatic scene"
252,4,rmvjre,2020-10-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,This is not Kathryn’s movie obviously this was Daniel’s
252,5,rmvjre,2020-10-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Pero lagi naman si Daniel ang magaling sa kanila

255,1,mrspeanutbutter,2020-10-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,CGM's style just hasn't aged well
255,2,mrspeanutbutter,2020-10-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,People in her movies don't talk and act like people normally would
255,3,mrspeanutbutter,2020-10-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Mas concerned sila with inserting catchy lines they can put in their trailers than with actually making human stories
255,4,mrspeanutbutter,2020-10-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Kathryn is great in her dramatic moments, and I think those moments show sparks of how much better this movie could have been"
255,5,mrspeanutbutter,2020-10-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"However, you could really feel her exerting in moments where she should come off as steely or sexy"
255,6,mrspeanutbutter,2020-10-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"I think Daniel is the better actor between the two, but his character is just irredeemably awful"
255,7,mrspeanutbutter,2020-10-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,They are both really capable actors but it almost feels like they're being forced to recite these awful and cheesy lines
255,8,mrspeanutbutter,2020-10-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I hate when movies try to make toxic relationships cutesy
255,9,mrspeanutbutter,2020-10-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Like the years of him disrupting her from achieving her dreams and holding her back is not enough, he has to force himself back into her life, and we're supposed to find it cute"

257,4,_girlwhowaited,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The two had revealed that some of their lines had been taken from their own relationship, and it makes a lot of sense"
257,5,_girlwhowaited,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The emotion they'd all put out was genuine, and it was all a lot of great acting"
257,6,_girlwhowaited,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It was also a really good story for the duo's usual repertoire, and I love that they decided to give them a more mature story that was on the level of Cathy Garcia-Molina's masterpieces like One More Chance"
257,7,_girlwhowaited,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It was relatable, fun and heartbreaking all at the same time"

287,2,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"it has everything you’d expect; flashbacks and flashforwards, a junket trip to Europe, 2 charismatic leads, etc"
287,3,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"what separates this from the fluff is its execution, the story (up until the end) is well crafted and avoids the natural pitfalls of the premise it set up for itself"
287,4,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,the protagonists have agency and do not make any decision just for plot contrivance
287,5,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"not to say this is a perfect movie, it has its problems— the editing and pacing is not quite there"
287,6,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"it spends way too much time meandering through Amsterdam, and crafting a Pixar Up-like sequence in the beginning was not necessary if they were only going to spend a lot of running time going through the past all over again, so there is no economy of storytelling present"
287,7,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,my biggest problem though is the ending
287,8,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"i understand why they did it the way they did, but imo it was completely unnecessary and actually harms the characters’ growth during the movie"
287,9,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"SPOILER what the ending does is retcon the movie’s story; we find out in the end that Primo actually knew he was being a selfish prick before he left, but instead of actually doing something about it, he instead, what, wrote a letter"
287,10,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,that makes it okay
287,11,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"that actually makes it worse, because now we know he had a CHOICE to be better 2 years ago, but he chose not to"
287,12,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"his 2 years of change therefore did not matter because it implies he in fact didn’t change, at all"
287,13,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,then they have George APOLOGIZING to him
287,14,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,as if anything was her fault
287,15,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,that is wrong on so many levels
287,16,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"this development looks unfortunately to have been put there only to create a reason for George to get back together with Primo in time for the movie to end, but this was completely unnecessary"
287,17,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Primo has grown as a person, he’s already shown this to George, and George already acknowledges that he has"
287,18,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,there was no need for the letter
287,19,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"instead, what they should have done was, after all the items have been sold off, have both of them say farewell to their past selves, the people that owned that house, and reintroduce each other as new people"
287,20,dibidi,2020-11-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"have the movie end with George agreeing to go on a first date with Primo, a chance that this time around, things will work out"
288,1,yazflix,2020-11-06 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Told myself I wouldn’t watch it, but here we are"
288,2,yazflix,2020-11-06 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Honestly it just seemed like a hallmark type film but Filipino
288,3,yazflix,2020-11-06 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Didn’t hate it & didn’t love it
288,4,yazflix,2020-11-06 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The part where they go to Amsterdam  that shit was so funny and cringe and so poorly done
288,5,yazflix,2020-11-06 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The white woman looks at her Filipino step daughter and literally says “you have your dads nose” LMAOOOO out of all the other things she could’ve said  and the Dutch people literally couldn’t…

290,2,joshmeow,2020-11-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,the first half is undeniably okay (for me) but the other half is just plainly clichè and pretentious and sorry to tell you this but the film would have been somehow better if darren (and his weird characterization) wasn't there
290,3,joshmeow,2020-11-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,one star for kathryn

294,4,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Direk Cathy Garcia's signature ill-fitted wigs
294,5,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"Seriously, why"
294,7,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Overly cheesy dialogue
294,8,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"Nobody talks like that in real life, especially those 2 leads, it just doesn't suit them"
294,9,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,It's so forced
294,11,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Meh plotline
294,12,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Nothing new there
294,13,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"It's obviously a money-grabbing, fan service blandness"
294,15,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Not well-acted at all
294,16,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Not one of them
294,17,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"But especially, Kathryn"
294,18,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"Please, crying easy doesn't mean your acting is effective"
294,20,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Philippine cinema formula
294,21,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"Yes, let's shoot at overseas location to use the beautiful sceneries as background and our studio gave us extra budget anyway eventhough it doesn't really add anything to the story itself"
294,24,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,The unnecessarily long runtime of 117 minutes
294,25,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,There's lot of useless stuff there
294,26,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Does this film think it's an epic
294,28,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,What's up with that end credits scene
294,29,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Soooo cringey
294,31,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"If Kathniel and Direk Cathy think this is their mature take on romance movie, they're deluded"
294,32,aclethic,2020-11-08 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,It's another pinoy love team movie crap wrapped in shiny paper designed to tickle non-thinking fans so the movie team can reap the blockbuster benefits

307,5,apokolipschild,2020-11-16 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The dialogue feels cringe but still has some impactful one-liners that somehow make this watchable
307,6,apokolipschild,2020-11-16 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Overall, the film has a powerful high concept and it would've been more solid if it stuck with a more serious tone: finding the balance between the priority of saving a relationship or chasing one's dreams"

328,2,jazesedgwick,2020-12-11 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It started with a promising first act that got me really hooked on to the movie and liking it right away
328,3,jazesedgwick,2020-12-11 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,There were scenes that were all too real and relatable
328,4,jazesedgwick,2020-12-11 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Then the second act came and this movie just falls into like any other Filipino romantic drama films with the “return of the exes and still hung up from each other after not seeing or communicating after many years but it felt like nothing has changed and we still love each other so much that we end up together because LOVE CONQUERS ALL ADVERSITIES” trope with a little bit of an identity crisis from our supporting characters as a side plot
328,5,jazesedgwick,2020-12-11 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I really thought this film was gonna give us a tale of couples dealing with ups and downs and eventually, a breakup and going through the transition of being single after being in a committed relationship for so long"

328,7,jazesedgwick,2020-12-11 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I really believe this movie isn’t really worth the hype

340,1,baljeetwatch,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The Hows of Us is a beautifully written film that touches all the romantics out there - giving us the beauty and sappiness of romantic comedies while giving the harsh realities that hurt us within
340,2,baljeetwatch,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Kathryn Bernardo is in her prime in this movie, given with such great lines, direction, and build up with her partner Daniel Padilla"
340,3,baljeetwatch,2020-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I just cannot emphasize more how the characters have provided bittersweet scenes

345,2,miasama,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,probably the best one if not at least in the top 3
345,3,miasama,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Plot and some scenes will always be cheesy but it's too be expected so I wasn't thrown off

345,8,miasama,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Daniel ofc that FACE and the VOICE, but it's hard to comment on his acting since he gets generally the same roles with very similar personalities"
345,9,miasama,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,There was definitely more depth this time around
345,10,miasama,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I enjoyed it way too much to get into the things i didn't like that are just ingrained in these romcoms

346,1,dufreshest,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The Hows of Us is a drama romcom type film about a Filipino boyfriend musician and a girlfriend on her way to being a doctor growing individually as well as through their relationship in ties with their new home purchase
346,2,dufreshest,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The film touches on aspects of romance/love, aspects of grief loss, aspects of depression, aspects of addiction, aspects of being a homeowner, aspects of negative pride, aspects of romantic relationships/friendships, aspects of maturity, aspects of family, and aspects of diabetic retinopathy amongst other points"
346,3,dufreshest,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The camera work is on point
346,4,dufreshest,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The acting partners fulfill the film
346,5,dufreshest,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I find the film funnier than sad
346,6,dufreshest,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The film has some interesting messages about relationships
346,7,dufreshest,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Though I think a lot is simply put together to fluff the film/make it make more sense toward the end, I find the film entertaining"
347,1,nielmnopakyu,2020-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,this would've been a great film if they didn't end up with each other

350,1,peregrintook12,2021-01-03 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,The film tries hard to make us root for a very dysfunctional relationship

355,1,gayshipseries,2021-01-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,filipino love team culture is toxic and usually the members of that love team cant act but kathryn is different
355,2,gayshipseries,2021-01-11 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,she IS that ACTRESS
356,1,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,hindi ko alam if i’m just getting back into pinoy movies or my star cinema melodrama bias is acting up but i really liked this movie
356,2,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,kathryn is such a good actor and i’m realizing that more than ever
356,3,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,daniel is decent at most but it does feel natural to see him with kathryn— and that plays a huge part on how we see him on screen
356,4,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,most actors are great aside from darren
356,5,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,palagi naman may ini-introduce na “young talent” ang star cinema in all of their movies na hindi talaga marunong umarte so i guess masasanay ka na din
356,6,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"yun lang, ang pangit at awkward talaga"
356,7,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,isa pang pansin ko: color grading sa amsterdam scenes sobrang processed
356,8,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"you’re already in amsterdam, might as well follow its natural vibe instead of presenting it as a much brighter, summery place compared to the philippines (where it’s always bright and summery)"
356,9,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"plot-wise, decent pero overused as usual"
356,10,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,sa script lang lagi nagkakatalo ang mga star cinema melodramatic romance blockbusters and this was average
356,11,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,kathryn lang talaga nagdala
356,12,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,and she did a damn good job
356,13,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"parang character niya sa movie, dalang-dala niya si daniel"
356,14,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,good for her
356,15,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,go girl
356,16,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"ayun, overall ay bigyan natin siya ng 3"
356,17,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,5 stars
356,18,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,it’s definitely good enough to be called generally well-made
356,19,cinephyte,2021-01-16 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,at napaiyak niya ako so laking factor din yun for this very serious and very lengthy review in the very revered letterbox
357,1,mems7,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Super love this movie
357,2,mems7,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,High quality production
357,3,mems7,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Great acting and great direction
357,4,mems7,2020-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I cried many tears
358,1,miseokim,2021-01-19 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,you can't change my mind when i say kathryn bernardo is the filipina actress of our generation
359,1,ironicmajesty,2021-01-22 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The Hows Of Us could've been a strong film, especially with Kathryn Bernardo's effective acting"
359,2,ironicmajesty,2021-01-22 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,But the topsy turvy storytelling ruined a good experience
359,3,ironicmajesty,2021-01-22 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It started off too serious and heavy, then shifted to a corny rom-com approach and a third act that's unnecessary (ma-justify lang ng prod team pag-abroad nila under Star Cinema's expense)"
359,4,ironicmajesty,2021-01-22 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Daniel Padilla's acting is generic and was overshadowed by Kathryn's more upfront character
359,5,ironicmajesty,2021-01-22 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Still, they do kilig scenes the best"
359,6,ironicmajesty,2021-01-22 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The dialogue would hit couples who experienced a similar dilemma as Primo and George - and that's a real dart to the heart
360,1,antonioagregado,2021-01-22 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"""'Yan naman kasing tita-lola niyo e, masyadong naniwala na forever ang loveteam niyo e"

362,1,jcapati,2021-01-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The best so far
362,3,jcapati,2021-01-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Kathryn just kills it every time
363,1,lance_christoff,2021-01-30 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The dialogues– the lines, how powerful they are"
364,1,thetalaendaya,2021-01-31 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,moral lesson: huwag sundin ang passion kasi hindi ka naman mapapakain niyan charot
365,1,theblover69,2021-02-02 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,only watched like 15 mins and then stopped because i realized this is just a concoction of all the things i hate in filipino cinema
365,2,theblover69,2021-02-02 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,also wtf were those misogynistic lines WHAT WAS THE POINT
366,1,romiii,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Okayy something new to me
366,2,romiii,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I don't usually do pinoy films, but I was urged by a friend to see flicks featuring Kathryn Bernardo and first up was this film"
366,3,romiii,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I think this is the 1st time for Kathryn to bask into a more mature role, and she did great showing off some skin (e"
366,5,romiii,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"sandos, sleeveless shirts lol)"
366,6,romiii,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Pretty straight forward plot, yet brought to life by the good performance by Kath who carried the whole film unto her tiny shoulders"
367,1,quark,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"So this is the first time for me to watch a KathNiel film, and HOLY MOTHER OF GOD KATHRYN IS THE MOST ADORABLE ACTRESS"
367,2,quark,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"She so adorable I want to hold her back in the Jeepney and tell her ""no girl he ain't worth it don't go saving that drunk"
367,3,quark,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,""" She so adorable I want to put a towel over her as she monologues in the rain"
367,4,quark,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,She so adorable I want to drink with her and Ria and Gege and convince her that she deserves better
367,5,quark,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,She so adorable that I want to find a cure for Darren Espanto's diabetic retinopathy so she won't have to worry so much
367,6,quark,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,She so adorable I want to find that record under the fridge and give it to her at the start of the film so she won't have to go through all that torment
367,7,quark,2021-02-03 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"What a star, this girl"
368,1,cassperalta,2021-02-03 17:33:15.224,60.0,ltbx,lets just say im naive and i liked this movie
369,1,ellexbee,2021-02-06 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The real star of this movie is the couch

373,1,calebpinson,2021-02-20 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I genuinely found the opening an interesting and creative way of establishing the story even if the narration at points was a little too much

376,2,elizabethbasili,2021-02-26 01:56:38.459,60.0,ltbx,movie goes on a little too long especially with the amsterdam portion of it
376,3,elizabethbasili,2021-02-26 01:56:38.459,60.0,ltbx,didnt really feel the chemisty bc i didnt really like primo lol

379,1,amazingaims,2021-02-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,cried on my first watch but now
380,1,wilo,2021-02-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"It's been a long time (years) since my last Thailand's movie, and The Hows of Us reminds me on Thailand's movie ability to make us laugh at their silliness, the authentic stupid dialogue, I enjoy that so much (a lot of time I find it hard to accept the slow motion scene and the cheesy dialogue on Korean movie, but Thailand's unrealistic stupid dialogue is just so pure and authentic I love it cso much)"
380,2,wilo,2021-02-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"There's nothing special from the plot, it's a basic romance story line--the couple fall in love, flirt and fight with each other, act stupid--just like other relationship"
380,3,wilo,2021-02-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"But I like this movie because I just miss watching an enjoyable basic romantic comedy movie, my all time favorit, my comfort zone"
381,1,miguelhanz,2021-03-01 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"still surprisingly rich with insight about relationships and the time we spend up keeping them, ourselves and the thresholds we maintain for sanity, and how integral sacrifice is for survival"
381,2,miguelhanz,2021-03-01 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,this film probably does not deserve my musings
381,3,miguelhanz,2021-03-01 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,a good tear or two were shed
382,1,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The film's premise surely captures the kind of sentimentality that is born out of selfless devotion
382,2,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,George (Kathryn Bernardo) represents every doting lover who understands that love is both a struggle and sacrifice
382,3,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"But she's human enough to reach her breaking point, that non-singular moment Primo (Daniel Padilla), her lover, erodes into a miserable man"
382,4,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"That's outright promising, given an opportunity to go deep into the characters' core"
382,5,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Until the narrative submits to Star Cinema formula
382,6,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"While Primo tries to win George back, a lot of other things happen, all brazenly pointing to them realizing they need to be back together, even if he decides to set her free--a banal device that aims to make love look elusive but more intense"
382,7,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Because how are these two characters supposed to respond to other charcters whose sole duty is to remind them that they still love each other
382,8,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The sequences in Amsterdam feel like you're watching a different film, with characters so eager to accomplish something for a great cause"
382,9,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The attempt at proving its significance by way of editorializing the flowers and the sunset does not put weight on either the characters or the narrative itself
382,10,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Daniel effortlessly delivers, his eyes expressing the right emotions"
382,11,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Kathryn tries hard, a few times she's hitting it"
382,12,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Other times she's like a dainty, vulnerable young girl being forced to battle tough times"
382,13,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Her eyes convey ambiguity rather than perceptive and penetrating responses that don't demand words
382,14,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Her delivery of ""quotable quotes"" and the lines in the debate scene sounds like a graded recitation (yung mukhang minemorize nang maigi)"
382,15,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"And then the film gets too didactic, telling us what we should make of how Primo and George triumphed at their story and how we should distinguish battle and war as metaphors for love (kung maka-figure of speech"
382,17,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The film is supposed to tackle maturity in relationship, but it appears that its depiction does not quite go with its marketing"
382,18,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,And Star Cinema is not bothered by such incongruency
382,19,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It just continues to shape love through a narrative that always turns factitious and simplistic
382,20,denlebantino,2021-03-02 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It does not mind reducing it into the fundamentals of melodrama and simplified association or discourse
383,1,beeyuncuh,2021-03-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,kathryn hard carried this one
384,1,melthing,2021-03-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Kathryn did well
384,2,melthing,2021-03-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Realistic scenes of heartbreak is hard to execute, i think Daniel can relate in this film"
384,3,melthing,2021-03-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The film is well done, a bit of a bumpy road in the middle but the ending is actually good"
384,4,melthing,2021-03-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Underrated film imo
384,5,melthing,2021-03-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,people don’t appreciate this much as a good executed film
384,6,melthing,2021-03-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"some see it as “Kathryn, Daniel movie"
384,8,melthing,2021-03-04 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"which is fair,, but appreciate it while not overrating it pls"
385,1,martysantos,2021-03-06 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,One of Kathryn and Daniel’s best films in terms of acting
385,2,martysantos,2021-03-06 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The story did really well in the first half, but it eventually got lost"
385,3,martysantos,2021-03-06 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,There were many out of place scenes that also felt unbelievable
385,4,martysantos,2021-03-06 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The movie would’ve been better if they didn’t drag it too much
386,1,4ngel4,2020-10-25 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,diba sabi you can't go back to the same person who broke you before eme something like that ba't ganon kathryn bernardo hard carried this

388,1,jimeeeeey,2021-03-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Primo crushed George's heart and thought he could just walk into her life like that didn't happen
388,2,jimeeeeey,2021-03-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Please don't do that in real life
389,1,melthing,2021-03-20 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The sub plot is actually similar to Marriage Story
389,2,melthing,2021-03-20 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Kathryn did great
389,3,melthing,2021-03-20 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I just hoped some didn’t play too exaggerated at times and this would have been a 4
389,4,melthing,2021-03-20 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,i surprisingly like this more than most people

389,7,melthing,2021-03-20 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"well, this was executed in a way i really didn’t like, i’m not invested in the characters so much mainly because they are not relatable but they are imaginable, so imaginable that a kid can imagine making these characters"
389,8,melthing,2021-03-20 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Again, storyline is good"
390,1,forgineo,2021-03-22 14:41:31.163,40.0,ltbx,It is hard to root for a character who doesn't fully embody full remorse
390,2,forgineo,2021-03-22 14:41:31.163,40.0,ltbx,I hated that forgiveness can be earned by mushy and cheesy efforts but never really using or giving emphasis on the issues at hand
391,1,izzyroxas,2021-03-26 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,raph whyd u rate dis 2 stars this is so good

397,1,lyndethegrande,2021-04-07 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I’m sorry but I just don’t like Primo with a passion
397,2,lyndethegrande,2021-04-07 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Also, the third act in Amsterdam is really unnecessary to the plot but what is a star cinema romcom without a one perfect shot in a foreign country"
398,1,centgomezzz,2021-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,simple yet effective
399,1,rlawlsgur,2021-04-17 16:12:37.262,40.0,ltbx,i still don't get why this was once the all-time highest grossing filipino film
400,1,nlongno,2021-04-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,YouTube dramas are far from entertaining than this one
401,1,red_shifts,2021-04-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"This film glorifies giving chummy ""efforts"" and gifts as a way to earn female affection and forgiveness"
401,2,red_shifts,2021-04-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"But I will not comment on that yet, and instead focus on the scene that I think gave me the impression that this film could be considered a cultural artifact of our time"
401,3,red_shifts,2021-04-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"And that scene is when Bernardo and Padilla's characters were putting price tags on the items from their house, as if memories are quantifiable in pesos"

406,2,_lizzie_,2020-12-10 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Amsterdam and dead dad subplot was unnecessary

421,1,dianarar,2021-06-14 01:48:45.121,80.0,ltbx,Kath's acting did so much for a script that was bloated and a bit jumbled
421,2,dianarar,2021-06-14 01:48:45.121,80.0,ltbx,"I like Cathy Garcia Molina's work, because she incorporates emotionally resonant themes into campy genres in a way that always works"

438,2,143volts,2020-01-19 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,did not deserve george
439,1,gelbadoodle,2021-07-23 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,the movie would have been the same without amsterdam…
439,2,gelbadoodle,2021-07-23 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,i feel like there’s also a lack of context sa panahon na ginugol ni george sa pagbubuhat kay primo
439,3,gelbadoodle,2021-07-23 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,and i kept on asking myself where in the philippines the movie was set bc that provides a lot of context to their situation as well
439,4,gelbadoodle,2021-07-23 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,the lack of specificity with these things really waters down their struggles because the story feels like a lot of other stories
439,5,gelbadoodle,2021-07-23 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,even the way they talk adds to the questioning of where all of this is happening
439,6,gelbadoodle,2021-07-23 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,or maybe im just stoned at the nail salon
439,7,gelbadoodle,2021-07-23 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,(also ang tagal nilang pagkasama tapos di nasabi ni primo kay george yung sinulat nya for her birthday nang mas maaga

482,2,davoarid,2021-09-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,") that distract from the central relationship (and they do much more than merely distract: they actively conspire against it, as it keeps alive the dream that external events could solve the problems in their relationships"

553,8,raymond_lo,2022-02-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The conflict is as old as Sharon Cuneta’s first movie (or could be older) but the execution somehow feels novel
553,9,raymond_lo,2022-02-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,There are many cutesy scenes definitely constructed for the diehard fans of the loveteam but it somehow does not offend or get in the way of the developing drama
553,10,raymond_lo,2022-02-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,There is a subplot that will not ordinarily work but somehow works here
553,11,raymond_lo,2022-02-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Every emotion this movie elicits from the audience is definitely earned
553,12,raymond_lo,2022-02-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The great character actress Odette Khan appears in a cameo towards the end of the movie that only made me love this film more

557,2,magallanes,2022-02-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,At Least for Kathryn and sometimes Daniel
557,3,magallanes,2022-02-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But Miss Cathy Garcia Molina has a lot of cheesy scenes and lines in her movies and the plot is the same formula
557,4,magallanes,2022-02-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I don’t know but with confrontation scenes, It is somehow working"

562,1,nathandrakes,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,My second rewatch thoughts:This film is actually kind of good
562,2,nathandrakes,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"What I don't like about it is how unrealistic some of the scenes are, but it's saved by the amazing performance of Kathryn and her co-star Daniel"
562,3,nathandrakes,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The chemistry they both have is seen clearly in here

562,9,nathandrakes,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,cheesy and sometimes even cringy lines that feels unrealistic if said in real life
562,10,nathandrakes,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"With all of these in mind, I enjoyed the film because it shows the struggle between the people, and how we should always have each other's back no matter what"
562,11,nathandrakes,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,""" The story they end up telling is actually pretty simple, but there are just so many other things that crowd out the much more affecting core of this story: two people still clearly in love with each other, just trying to overcome the hurt that also still exists between them"

565,2,fjorgynn,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,"as per usual, filipino rom-com tropes were at play here — which contributed to its downfall"
565,3,fjorgynn,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,cheesy scenes with corny lines that fell flat and even were downright cringy
565,4,fjorgynn,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,"i'll give them this, kathryn bernardo and daniel padilla are amazing but good acting can't always save a bad script"
565,5,fjorgynn,2022-03-13 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,"unfortunately, this is still a star cinema film, so what can one expect right"

570,2,shiversteel,2021-08-21 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Anchored by two appealing actors, this is just another generic romance/drama film with a stereotypical moral lesson"
570,3,shiversteel,2021-08-21 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I will just agree with others saying that Bernardo saved this film
570,4,shiversteel,2021-08-21 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I should just reevaluate after rewatching it, but that's unlikely"
570,5,shiversteel,2021-08-21 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,This is because I don't find this very rewatchable

596,4,tonttegonzaga,2022-04-15 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Contrary sa nakita kong reactions ng fans, di ako agree na problematic si Primo"

596,12,tonttegonzaga,2022-04-15 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Di sinabi ni George yung expectations niya kay Primo at nagtiis nalang siya sa gilid hanggang napuno na siya3

596,14,tonttegonzaga,2022-04-15 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Parang dito sa movie na to, albeit lovestory siya, mas focused kay George yung kwento"

596,18,tonttegonzaga,2022-04-15 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,May ibang plot lines and characters na unnecessary at naging plot device lang sila
596,19,tonttegonzaga,2022-04-15 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Gaya nung past romance movie na napanood ko, di na kelangan pumunta sa ibang bansa para gawing nakakakilig yung story"
596,20,tonttegonzaga,2022-04-15 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Tbh, parang irrelevant nga sa main story yung Amsterdam plot nila"
596,22,tonttegonzaga,2022-04-15 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Sobrang rare talaga siguro ng filipino romance (lalo na yung focused sa loveteam) na maging grounded sa reality

827,1,kirstenie,2023-01-07 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,daniel padilla has too much power over me
827,2,kirstenie,2023-01-07 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"other than that, kathryn bernardo absolutely carried this film but i hate how they romanticize toxic relationships, george's med school friend was correct and george's office friend was wrong"
827,3,kirstenie,2023-01-07 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"george deserved better :(the tension during some of the scenes got to me though i will not lie, kathniel always has the best kilig scenes i swear"

828,2,jjmary,2023-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The first few minutes of the film was okay, a bit realistic, but onwards, it became super cheesy and frustrating"
828,3,jjmary,2023-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Please, for the love of God, free Kathryn Bernardo from Daniel Padilla and Cathy Garcia Molina (and other mainstream directors)"
828,4,jjmary,2023-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,She either greatly overshadows DJ's acting skills or DJ drags her down with his acting (or the lack thereof)
828,5,jjmary,2023-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,She also wouldn't grow as an actress if she just keeps getting the same role with different names
828,6,jjmary,2023-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Cathy Molina has done it again with her favorite movie formula: the toxic guy gets in a relationship with the positive strong woman, they break up, guy or girl goes to a different country and then goes back to the Philippines years later, guy woos girl (redemption arc), girl forgives guy, and they live happily ever after"
828,7,jjmary,2023-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"God, this is why Filipinos love to romanticize problematic relationships and toxic men"

829,4,hthyhl,2023-01-10 06:04:03.501,80.0,ltbx,Solely the rain scene can outshine all of her co-actor's scene in any of his film discography
829,5,hthyhl,2023-01-10 06:04:03.501,80.0,ltbx,Which is funny because both of them has almost the same film discography
829,6,hthyhl,2023-01-10 06:04:03.501,80.0,ltbx,How is that her acting just gets better and better while the other one somehow got

870,7,abigailgzmn,2023-02-03 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I figured it must be symbolism for George's turmoiled feelings toward Primo
870,8,abigailgzmn,2023-02-03 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Tulips are definitely a symbolism as well for George's ideal partner

1146,8,augustusrai,2023-07-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"While Primo was chasing his dreams, he forgot that he has a partner to take care of and consider"

1146,11,augustusrai,2023-07-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,What I didn't like though was the fact na nagkabalikan sila and how they approached it
1146,12,augustusrai,2023-07-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Para kasing nabura rin kung gaano ka-shitty yung ginawa ni Primo kay George over the course of their relationship

1388,4,josephweirdness,2023-09-15 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,So much feels authentic and even the silliness of the core concept (dividing a house in half out of spite) feels grounded in a strong emotional reality that it passes by without much resistance from myself

1388,8,josephweirdness,2023-09-15 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Obviously the divided house concept gives her a lot of chance to play with these ideas and generally speaking, they work to the film's benefit more than they detract"

1929,1,punanicega,2024-01-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Star Cinema have to stop producing repetitive and mediocre storyline for a romantic-drama/comedy film while using famous love teams to extract money from the audience especially to avid Kathniel fans
1929,2,punanicega,2024-01-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"first, there are so many side stories such as the medical problem and the daddy issue which i find it unnecessary"
1929,3,punanicega,2024-01-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,i also want to point out the longingness of Darren to his father does not break the social construct of a traditional family and his acting makes it even annoying
1929,4,punanicega,2024-01-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"second, the part where they go abroad seems forced, just to say that the movie is set in Amsterdam"
1929,5,punanicega,2024-01-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,it is irrelevant and a waste of production's money especially they can use provincial places in our country
1929,6,punanicega,2024-01-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"third, the friends of Kathryn and Daniel are trying hard to be funny and have no significance to the character development of the protagonists even if Juan Miguel's role makes sense"
1929,7,punanicega,2024-01-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"fourth, the dialogues are too cheesy and have so many ""hugot lines"""
1929,8,punanicega,2024-01-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"fifth, the moral story of this film only taught audiences to be hopless romantic and to endure toxicity in order to save the relationship"
1929,9,punanicega,2024-01-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,the only breakthrough somehow is the absence of third party in the relationship
1929,10,punanicega,2024-01-08 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"as well, Kathryn is too good as an actress to play another fragile female character"

2034,7,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I know how comforting it is that you know that there's someone rooting for you in what you feel are your darkest times

2034,12,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,you dont need a jowa to save you from yourself HAHA)My favorite part was when Jo opened up about how she felt about their breakup
2034,13,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The choice the scriptwriters made to have Jo angry at the fact that Primo left, rather than the fact that we was a piece of shit on the days leading to their breakup made it clear that she really was rooting for him"
2034,14,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,That her love for Primo was rooted in something deeper than the idea of what he could offer her
2034,15,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,She was simply disappointed that he gave up on what they had when she started to break down as well
2034,16,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I definitely feel like their breakup was necessary
2034,17,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"At that point, Jo's hope was the singular thread keeping that relationship intact, and hope can only take so much"
2034,18,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"So when it wasn't strong, the relationship had to unravel"
2034,19,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,And it was good that they both grew despite being apart
2034,20,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Did she have to go back to Primo
2034,21,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I don't know
2034,22,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"If she didn't, i think it'll go to a ""Past Lives"" type of scenario when they meet each other again in the far far future, except with more contempt"

2034,25,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I wish I knew the answer
2034,26,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I always always want people to choose passion
2034,27,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But I can't relate because I don't have passion
2034,28,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I simply have a drive to survive
2034,29,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,So I go for practicality
2034,30,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"But if I had passion like Primo, I understand why he acted the way he did"
2034,31,piattos,2024-02-17 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I always imagine that it must be nice to want something so strongly

2617,2,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Because in years of subscribing to that app, the ones I've always wanted to watch are not in this app and no, I'm not gonna risk my time and waste it by watching their own horrible production films"
2617,3,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Crazy that they managed to change their price when they couldn't even give me a quality… you're really just enjoying this app if you're still a koreaboo (at this time), if you're also a Filipino media enjoyer or an Adam Sandler movie enjoyer and thankfully, I'm not one of either of the three"
2617,4,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,So yeah that app is just being logged in our TV but no one is actually using it unless we have friends coming over
2617,5,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Totally a waste of money I think but my mother is enjoying it I guess…I literally just said what the hell
2617,6,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"If I can't always find the movie I wanted to watch then I'm just wasting the consecutive suspensions of classes so yeah fawk it, I will just whatever's on the table"
2617,7,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Well, it's not exactly in the table because I still searched in this app what hideous film I would waste my time and something ticks in me that I should watch a Kathniel movie because why not"
2617,8,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"And then I remembered that this is one of their films that I still haven't watched but knowing how impactful it is to this country, maybe this is the time"
2617,9,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"You know, I have always been not a fan of Kathniel"

2617,13,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I'm sorry I'm just a normal Filipino who loves gossip and nosing my butt in other's lives
2617,14,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I remembered back when I was Grade 12, we had a roleplay activity that we had to do in front of us and we had some movie references that we could copy and this movie is one of them"
2617,15,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"First is, the teacher showed us the scene of Kathryn’s crying in the rain scene and lol I literally take a picture of that and posted in my story and said that this woman really cannot act and all my classmates saw it and laugh about it so that's why one of the best known of me is being a hater of Kathryn Bernardo"
2617,16,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,And hey
2617,17,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I'm sorry if I was called that
2617,18,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I never wanted it and I never intended to
2617,19,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I was just being honest and I told you that I still haven't watched this movie so watching that scene out of context really brought the wrong and early judgment of me
2617,20,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But this is why I'm changed now that I watched this film
2617,21,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I don't know if I can do it since I still haven't watched all of her films but based on the films that I watched, this really might be her best performance yet"
2617,22,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But I wouldn't say the best… I mean she definitely improved maybe because her roles have always been the same for years and this role back then might be the most mature one yet and I really see that
2617,23,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Her character here is one of the best ones she played and one of the best written yet considering this was written by the same director who always gives the same quality of characters for me
2617,24,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,There's an attempt here that I really appreciate but I still hope that it could've been more just like the rest of all people
2617,25,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I need her to be bolder, stronger and better"
2617,26,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But it's enough I guess if this is actually the story they wanted to portray since the start
2617,27,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I know one thing that we can agree on liking this
2617,28,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The YEARNING
2617,29,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It might be the best love approach that can be shown in the media
2617,30,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,And it's rare for me to watch a Filipino movie that the yearning was done right
2617,31,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,This is the highlight of the film for me
2617,32,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,You can really feel the couple’s chemistry in this movie and I understand and see that considering this is one of this couple's peak years
2617,33,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I was smiling, giggling like a girl and entertained"
2617,34,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But it's also annoying to watch now
2617,35,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I think this is really one of the films that can be watched back then but cannot be now
2617,36,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,This is their best role yet if we're gonna base it on the chemistry like they're literally just being a couple in here but with a plot
2617,37,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,And it's making me mad that they can't be like that off camera now because this man played his role a little too well
2617,38,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Fawk this guy to death like I wish he never finds a stardom again after what he did to their relationship
2617,39,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Everybody is worshiping your relationship like it was a major holiday whenever you're doing something
2617,40,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But you are also the one who ruined it
2617,41,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Men really are ruining everything
2617,42,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Straight men specifically
2617,43,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I like Primo in this movie but I can't bear to see that it was being played by this man
2617,44,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"There's still some bad acting in this movie that of course, will never go in Filipino movies"
2617,45,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,And yes that was you Darren
2617,46,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Question, why is he here"
2617,49,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I remember now
2617,50,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I live in the Philippines where everybody can be anything just because they can
2617,51,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Like just go back being a singer or do something but just please don't ever step foot in the acting industry
2617,52,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I think the gay best friend is doing the bare minimum too, like a little bit overacting for me because I'm a gay bestfriend too or maybe I just didn't like his character in here"
2617,53,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I mean it's obvious to me in the start how he didn't want her to be happy and I wouldn't do that to my girl besties
2617,54,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It's not right for me to see Jean Garcia not acting an antagonist because she really solidified her career in those roles
2617,55,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Like why do I kinda need her to slap Primo in here
2617,56,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The thing is, I wouldn't hate this movie so much because my friend right literally acted like George who is always coming back to her ex and I know a lot of y’all are being hypocrites too because I'm sure as hell you would do the same as George or far worse"
2617,57,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I mean that's literally one of the reasons why we don't have proper birth control in our country, right"
2617,58,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But I'm glad the quote of “Love is not enough” is being taken seriously now and being the base or references of every couple now because it's always been the right statement for every couple
2617,59,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The ending was a lackluster for me
2617,60,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I mean I literally have to go through their makeup which is too long for me
2617,61,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It is too long just to end it with George seeing Primo’s letter that he hid in the music record which is I still think why'd he have to hide in there
2617,62,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I don't think the finding father plot was out of place but if the results are like that then the whole Amsterdam scene should've been the time where the finally made up and spent each other's lives again together and better
2617,63,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"In short, the yearning was too good just to have unsatisfying results"
2617,64,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I might say that this was a good choice of movie
2617,65,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,This is definitely Kathryn's one of best roles and I hope she continues to improve and I will continue to support her career and wish the downfall of that man on the other hand
2617,66,akenonaevis,2025-09-23 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I hope she's happy and is eating a good meal everyday

2670,2,gruffe,2025-09-16 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,He was PMO cuz he was so intentionally dense when returning and I hate the trope of “I care abt u but I can’t express it so I’m gonna annoy you till you and ride off our previous relationship” I’m like  but I did feel like his redepmtion was lowk believeable by the end of the movie like he really did lock in once her brother started having health complications and just accepted they wouldn’t get back together and openly tried to help her respectfully out of his objective love for her regardless of the outcome

3906,11,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"His actions throughout the film made it clear that George deserved better, and it was exhausting to see her continuously put up with him"
3906,12,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,One of the most heartbreaking moments in the movie was when George was on her way to take her board exam
3906,13,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"She was already in the jeep, finally choosing herself and her future, but she still got off to check on Primo"
3906,14,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"That moment was painful to watch because it showed how much of herself she had given to him—even when she was about to take one of the most important exams of her life, she still prioritized him"
3906,15,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It was frustrating, but it also reflected the reality of many relationships where one person keeps giving while the other keeps taking"
3906,16,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Another scene that struck me was when George confronted Primo and said, “Kahit cupcake, hindi mo ako mabigyan"
3906,17,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"” That line wasn’t just about a cupcake—it was about all the little efforts that Primo never made, the small but meaningful ways he could have shown he cared but never did"
3906,18,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It summed up how unreciprocated George’s love and sacrifices had been, and it was heartbreaking to see her reach her breaking point"
3906,19,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Some people say romance films feel “sayang” when the leads don’t end up together, but I don’t think that’s always the case"
3906,20,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"In The Hows of Us, I honestly wouldn’t have minded if George had walked away for good"
3906,21,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The emotional damage was already there, and she had given so much of herself without getting anything in return"
3906,22,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"While the film tries to redeem Primo in the end, it doesn’t erase the fact that George had to suffer before he even realized her worth"
3906,23,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The story would have been just as powerful—if not more—if George had chosen herself instead
3906,24,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"That being said, I also can’t blame George for acting the way she did"
3906,25,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,One thing I’ve learned and seen from people around me is that love isn’t universal—everyone experiences it differently
3906,26,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Love can be complex and complicated to the point that it doesn’t make sense to others anymore
3906,27,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Even though I think she deserved better, if she couldn’t see it, then there’s no point"
3906,28,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It’s her love, her story, and her choice"
3906,29,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,This movie made me reflect on love and sacrifice
3906,30,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,How much should someone give before realizing they’ve lost themselves
3906,31,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Does love always have to come with suffering
3906,32,colleenrecato,2025-02-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"While the film gives hope in the end, it also makes you question whether some relationships are worth holding on to or if letting go is the better choice"

4289,1,vndui,2019-07-03 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,maybe what jo said na “pagod na pagod na pagod na pagod na ako” was actually for daniel not primo
4291,1,ultravioiet,2024-10-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"yall i think i need to grow up more because the if i were george and primo started singing hanggang kailan to me while playing the guitar i would take him back right away  the movie actually made me cry because as someone fresh out from a 20-month relationship, it’s sad to see the version of someone you once loved dearly fade & suddenly you’re stuck with someone who you don’t seem to recognize anymore BUT ACTUALLY hot take … i think primo deserved a second chance with george  he seemed to have learned his lesson and was actively showing george how he’s changed after years of not beinf in contact"
4291,2,ultravioiet,2024-10-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,i also think that the vinyl he gave george on her birthday (which she found years after) shows us that he never ignored george’s struggle and was also affected by it as it was a result of his situation
4291,3,ultravioiet,2024-10-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"if she only read the letter on the vinyl, i think things would’ve been different actually"
4291,4,ultravioiet,2024-10-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"for me, primo was just misunderstood  he wasn’t a red flag (at least for me) but he was just very passionate about something that he has poured his whole life into"

4291,7,ultravioiet,2024-10-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"both of them had their faults as characters, george’s being not communicating her feelings to primo (she did this once and it was DONE) and primo… well he has a lot of flaws let’s not dig deeper"
4291,8,ultravioiet,2024-10-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,but yeah that’s basically itthree stars because the movie made me smile and cry
4291,9,ultravioiet,2024-10-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,minus two stars because some of the scenes were a hard watch  and because i just didn’t get the whole “we will go to amsterdam but my dad ends up being dead” plot love can be sweeter the second time around
4291,10,ultravioiet,2024-10-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,or maybe the third time around
