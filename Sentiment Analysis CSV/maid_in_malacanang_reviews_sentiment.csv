Yet, the movie didn't give the experience of a family in their last 72 hours

The progression of events is anti-climactic

The flow of conversation is hollow

The choice of words contribute to the hollowness

The storytelling is disorderly

Continuously changes format narratives

I think if they stuck to a ""documentary"" type of movie it would've fit well

They didn't know what to tell and how to tell it, so it became an amalgamation of every movie format possible

They just combined all their scenes by inserting ""chapters"" and ""long texts"" in between that literally summarizes what they want to tell-which defeats the purpose of a movie

Cristine Reyes carried the movie, Ella Cruz has solid crying acts

Cesar Montano, playing the infamous dictator, has no semblance of the supposed 'strongman' traits of the one he's playing Diego Loyzaga literally has no emotion

Others didn't do anything Looking at you Kiko Estrada

Misrepresentation of nuns with Giselle Sanchez playing mahjong already crosses this film out as a supposed ""addition"" to history, since said nuns are cloistered

Usage of words that were not present those days, but are yet frequently heard in the movie

Usage of musical scores are way off, since most of the scores play in scenes that are unremarkable

Then by the end, there's a weird and sudden tribute to characters that were not given its decent exposure during the actual movie runtime"

572,2,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,: It is not my habit to watch films on the first day they're shown in theaters
572,3,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Knowing ""Maid in Malacañang"" is viral, popular, and controversial, I knew the cinemas would be packed so I did not make it an exception"
572,4,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,I watched it on the second day yet the theater was still full
572,5,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"This movie is about a family that Filipinos are used to see on TV and read in newspapers and magazines, but never seen and heard behind closed doors"
572,6,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,This is the first time to see the candid side of the Marcoses and how they dealt with one of the most tumultuous parts of their regime
572,7,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"The first part had the ""Nosi Balasi"" playing in the background, which made me think of the critics and the detractors that continue to discredit the Marcoses and their supporters through the years"
572,8,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"When you read the lyrics of this song, you'll realize that's exactly how the Marcoses treated their critics in the last 36 years"
572,9,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,I knew this film only presents one of the many perspectives of the so-called People Power Revolution in 1986
572,10,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"As the movie progressed, however, it became evident that two main perspectives are being narrated: those of the ""maids"" or the kasambahays, and that of the other ""maid"" in Malacanang who promised her father to tell their story in due time: Imee Marcos"
572,11,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Others may disagree with me on this but I see this film more as Imee's perspective of events as the ""panganay"" and as the unpaid ""maid"" in Malacanang, who did her best to give order to chaos and make some of the important decisions for her family during the last 72 hours of her father's regime"
572,12,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Having watched so many of Imee's vlogs and interviews, I can only imagine what she was like behind closed doors"
572,13,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,It was Christine Reyes' portrayal of the character that gives glimpses of Imee's younger self in a way that I believed she was Imee
572,14,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Christine showed Imee's facets convincingly: she was feisty, a quick thinker, always on her toes, decisive, a multi-tasker, and at times appeared to be a control freak"
572,15,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"The stories of the helpers inside the palace gave me a roller coaster of emotions; but more importantly, they gave the audience an idea of how the Marcoses treated their workers"
572,16,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"The fact that the maids could be candid around the president, the first lady, and their children speaks volumes"
572,17,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"They also had accounts that painted the Marcoses as ""just like other good employers"""
572,18,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,One important bit that got me was when the maids showed their furs given by Imelda
572,19,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"The former First Lady told them that they, too, deserved to own furs"
572,20,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,This reminded me of what FEM and Imelda often talk about in their writings and interviews: to give dignity to the Filipino people
572,21,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Of course, I couldn't help but mentally ""fact-check"" and compare some information in the movie with what I read from books and other publications throughout the campaign period"
572,22,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"The part about mainstream media spreading fake news that the Marcoses had already left Malacanang when they were still in the palace can be found in Paul Goldstein's article in EIR Journal dated July 25, 1986"
572,23,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,There was also the bit about Cory winning the elections based on NAMFREL's tally and FEM winning based on COMELEC's tally
572,24,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"You can find this info in Cecilio Arillo's book, A Country Imperiled and Rigoberto Tiglao's book, Debunked"
572,25,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"The part where the people at EDSA headed to Radio Veritas can be found in Paul Goldstein's article in EIR dated July 15, 1986

There's also something I noticed that's unique in this film that I don't see often in other Filipino films: the art of long takes"
572,26,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"A ""long take"" is a shot that's intended to appear as a single, uninterrupted take in the final edit of a film"
572,27,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,I thought this was interesting as it made the scenes appear more intimate
572,28,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,Long takes can draw you closer to the scene
572,29,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"At times, I felt transported into the story as if I were there in the moment with the characters, but as a silent and invisible observer"
572,30,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"As the camera gracefully glided from one angle to another, the drama and tension became more palpable"
572,31,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"That's because long takes mimic the real-life scenarios of freely moving through space and time while expressing feelings of agony, confusion, and fear"
572,32,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"I jokingly posted yesterday on Facebook: ""Who wrote the screenplay, Direk"
572,33,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,Because it was attempting to make me cry
572,34,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"""

And I did cry an ugly cry"
572,35,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Darryl, you're a brilliant writer"
572,36,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"I felt the suffering, the confusion, the hopelessness, and the shattering of the souls of the characters"
572,37,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,The simplest of lines can turn those who are hardened into misty-eyed
572,38,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"You will identify something very personal in your own life with a line, a scene, a character, or a moment in this movie"
572,39,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,I am not sure anyone could have written the screenplay any better as you did
572,40,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Another thing that I liked about this film is there were almost no actions and no special effects -- just a family and their staff talking to one another sometimes in a group, sometimes just between two people or among the family members"
572,41,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,It's the simplicity of it that highlights its sentimental edge with dialogues so movingly performed
572,42,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,You'll probably never find the stories of these characters in any publications mainly because they chose to remain quiet for decades or maybe they were not given the chance to air their side
572,43,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"While others will most likely question the accuracy of the narratives in this film, no one should invalidate them especially when these perspectives come from characters who LIVED inside Malacanang for several years"
572,44,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Like I said several times in my previous posts, there are hundreds or even thousands of ways to narrate an event depending on who is telling it"
572,45,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,Maid in Malacañang is about the perspectives of those inside the palace at the time when the opposition and the people on EDSA also crafted their own stories to tell
572,46,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"All perspectives are valid, especially of those who were in the same rooms as the president of the Republic These perspectives are pieces that help complete a puzzle that perplexed the nation for decades"
572,47,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,The movie did not negate exiting perspectives at all
572,48,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"In fact, perspectives should be looked at and treated separately without prejudice against one another"
572,49,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,This is how we understand both sides objectively
572,50,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,This is how we form a more complete picture of an important event in our history
572,51,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,Maid in Malacañang is about how it makes you feel in the end
572,52,benzxx,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"This movie makes me feel hopeful as a Filipino because, perhaps, this can help pave the way to national reconciliation so we can finally move on together as one"

642,30,LunaRafaelo,2022-08-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"""

The team tried to build up the story by ""Chaptering"" the whole plot which is I think is kind of in the infant stage of Philippine cinema, at least they tried, and I should give credit to them because it was in a unique way of directing/producing the film"
642,31,LunaRafaelo,2022-08-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Given the fact that our movie industry is falling apart because of the likes of mainstream tweetums drama cliche stories of Cardo Dalisay, Kim Chiu, Vice Ganda and the like"

642,35,LunaRafaelo,2022-08-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"It was okay for references but again, it could be portrayed/edited better"
642,36,LunaRafaelo,2022-08-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"But nevertheless, the cinematic feels is there"

1081,5,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,I don't like it
1081,6,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,But read along before you attack with torches and hurl insults
1081,7,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,Here are reasons why
1081,8,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"(Warning : Few Spoilers)

This is not a historical movie"
1081,9,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"If you want to see something stronger, then watch Brocka's banned movie or actual news footage"
1081,10,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"Not a movie told from the perspective of the producer, the director or the award giving bodies"
1081,11,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"If you are expecting a revisionist movie like dispelling rumours about the Marcoses excesses and opulence, this is not for you"
1081,12,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"It doesn't hide their wealth and their control of people around them - from the luxury-wearing zero-gravity moving Imelda, to the scary bossy angered Imee, the party going camou-wearing brave-wanting Bonget"
1081,13,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,No sugar coating here - they are revealed as spoiled people
1081,14,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"It doesn't portray the Marcoses as the bravest souls as they show here how they spiraled to their fears and frustrations, the latter shown by former President FEM himself"
1081,15,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"If you are expecting them to be portrayed here as a blameless hero family, they aren't as even Irene

It doesn't show the Marcoses as the most powerful family in the country as they too failed to save their entire extended household (meaning those who lived long with them in the palace)"
1081,16,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"The mahjong scene that irked many before the actual showing revealed the figures who were more powerful, and I emphasize, were as it is passe"
1081,17,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,And it is not the one who sat at the mahjong table but the bigger entity some tried to represent mockingly
1081,18,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,It didn't show the atrocities during Martial Law nor it depicted further the evil side of many politicians some have come to worship for decades
1081,19,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,Nor did it tackle the roots of what made Martial Law to be declared
1081,20,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"It didn't utilise more some actors like Elizabeth Oropesa, the controversial Ella Cruz and even the most hated actress now for portraying the symbolic yellow wearing saint, Gieselle Sanchez"
1081,21,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,I feel like some scenes really got stolen much by the superb timing and acting of Beverly Salviejo aka Manang Biday

1249,7,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"On a larger scale, the entire movie was actually a wicked punchline to rudely douse water ON the misplaced fears, the ruckus and the noise, about this movie becoming a monumental sacrilege to the altars of historical purity"
1249,8,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"There is nothing in this movie that actually distorts, revises, or replaces what we already know"
1249,9,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"This is not Yap and Viva Films trying to assault history with outlandish claims, but simply a dramatic, and sometimes hilarious, representation of a powerful family at their most vulnerable, most defeated state as they faced their imminent downfall"
1249,10,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"It is the story of an eldest daughter, a role excellently enacted by Cristine Reyes playing Senator Marcos who struggled to lead a family in the throes of collapse, trying to hold it together"
1249,11,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"It is the story of a son, poignantly played by Loyzaga as the young President Ferdinand Marcos Jr"

1249,14,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Some people took note of the absence of any reference to the actual reasons why EDSA took place, and count this as a deficiency of the movie"
1249,15,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"What they missed is that this movie is less a historical account of EDSA, or the political downfall of the Marcoses, but a family drama to reveal the stories behind the façade of the presidential palace"
1249,16,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"Ella Cruz's character of Irene summed up what can possibly be said about the rule of her father - that his government was not perfect, and that he lost control of it and his people, many of whom betrayed him"

1249,21,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"It establishes the fact that indeed there were boxes full of undistributed cash, which many would interpret as money intended to buy voters in the 1986 snap elections, but the character representing Senator Marcos rationalized it as payment for people who actually worked for the Marcos campaign"
1249,22,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,It was left to the viewers to form their own conclusions as to which narrative we will believe
1249,23,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"The much talked about, and bashed scene, of former president Corazon Aquino playing mahjong with nuns, who incidentally are clearly represented not as the Carmelite sisters, is actually an artistic and symbolic representation, following another symbolic scene where Ferdinand and Imelda waltzed while Malacañang was being attacked by a mob"
1249,24,gerald_knights-27808,2022-09-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"If there is one moment where Yap made a political commentary, it would be in this symbolic representation of the political elites playing with the Church during EDSA"

1326,20,bananachip,2023-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,Almost every Malacañang staff loved the Marcoses and it's a commendable Filipino trait as maids are always treated as part of the family
1326,21,bananachip,2023-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,"So the history is actually factual, so where's the fiction"
1326,22,bananachip,2023-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,Opinion: Personally I feel that Imee's entire character is fiction
1326,23,bananachip,2023-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,"As she heavily contributed to this film, it feels as though this is what she wanted it to have been rather than what actually happened"
1326,24,bananachip,2023-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,"In the film, Imee is treated as the leader of the household that even her parents can depend on"
1326,25,bananachip,2023-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,"But witnessing the dynamics of older Ilocano households and even in Bongbong Marcos' own words, the Parents are never questioned and they lead the family by themselves"
1326,26,bananachip,2023-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,WHY THE RATING
1326,27,bananachip,2023-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,"As stated, my only problems were two elements so 8/10 but overall, it was enjoyable to watch"
1326,28,bananachip,2023-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,The solemn scenes are beautifully intermixed with the humorous scenes
1326,29,bananachip,2023-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,It doesn't follow the Filipino extreme like making us think someone's dead only to reveal that they were sleeping

1326,34,bananachip,2023-04-10 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,Seeing your parents relate to the 80's references makes you feel like your bonding with them and the theme of the entire film is a lesson on how strong family bonds always prevail over petty political fights

1335,2,ocampojp,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,,imdb,: Historical Distortion

1336,1,marcolacsonml,2023-02-09 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Possible Marcos propaganda: I see the reviews majority is 10 out of 10
1336,2,marcolacsonml,2023-02-09 00:00:00.000,,imdb,It is rare to see the majority with this kind user rating review
1336,3,marcolacsonml,2023-02-09 00:00:00.000,,imdb,It's either 7 to 10 and not all 10
1336,4,marcolacsonml,2023-02-09 00:00:00.000,,imdb,I have a feeling fans of Marcos are giving this rating
1336,5,marcolacsonml,2023-02-09 00:00:00.000,,imdb,The reviews for this movie should have been for the neutral people let's say people overseas and not the philippines
1336,6,marcolacsonml,2023-02-09 00:00:00.000,,imdb,The rest of the reviews might have been placed 10 without even watching it
1336,7,marcolacsonml,2023-02-09 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Which is why there are people who are not smart enough to understand the situation
1336,8,marcolacsonml,2023-02-09 00:00:00.000,,imdb,They are not being honest and just want the movie to be perfect

1336,10,marcolacsonml,2023-02-09 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Please stop
1337,1,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,The movie isn't a total rotten fruit but a lot of things need improvement
1337,2,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,: Just watched Maid in Malacañang a couple of days ago
1337,3,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"This is my first time to write a movie review and since I have no expertise in anything related to film production and writing stories, take this as a piece from an ordinary moviegoer"
1337,4,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"You might come across some strange expressions here, so I'm sorry in advance"
1337,5,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,TECHNICAL STUFF
1337,6,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"Whether it's the cinema's systems or the film's audio mixing, I found the sound so terrible that it affected my experience during the entire time"
1337,7,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"It was too loud that I had to cover my ears sometimes, even more for the moments when Cristine Reyes as Imee was shouting"
1337,8,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,And the balance between dialogue and music wasn't great; the Nosi Ba Lasi song didn't fit in well
1337,9,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,And I wanted to enjoy the song naman while following the scenes
1337,10,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Another thing is the text
1337,11,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Did they make the text switch too soon or am I just a slow reader
1337,12,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"I think it was too fast, and was part of my thought about the story feeling so rushed"
1337,14,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Nosi Ba Lasi is the theme song of the film
1337,15,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,I didn't pay attention to the lyrics (never listened to the song before) but this version of Sampaguita's song did give some melancholic feeling to the story
1337,16,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Also I wished the background music wasn't so plain
1337,17,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,I'm a sucker for movie soundtracks
1337,18,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,The music score should have a unique identity
1337,19,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,It wasn't memorable
1337,20,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Also the sound of plucking strings during the maids' scenes felt pretentious
1337,21,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Didn't fit in with the sound style of the film
1337,22,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,CAST AND CHARACTERS
1337,23,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"Okay, so I know nothing about the personalities of the family, so I wanted to see how the film would portray them whether it's assuming we already know the kind of people they are or it's gonna introduce them to us as if they're new (of course, accompanied with the knowledge this film is about the presidential family living at the Palace)"
1337,24,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,I'm on the latter
1337,25,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"I think Imee's introduction was good because I got to know her as this woman who's always moving, got a lot on her mind"
1337,26,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"When she gets back to the Palace, she's shown as the person most concerned about matters at home"
1337,27,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,I would be disappointed too if my siblings don't know what to do with their responsibilities haha
1337,28,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,So I got the impression that the story would focus more on her development but the film dropped her in the middle of it
1337,29,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"Irene, Imelda, and Bongbong suddenly got scenes of their own when I didn't really get to know them before that"
1337,30,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,(And clearly the father Ferdinand is a secondary character)
1337,31,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"Like, okay, I didn't care about their emotionals because I was already hooked on Imee's development from the start"
1337,32,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,The actors weren't bad actually
1337,33,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Christine Reyes as the stressed out Ate-of-the-house was impressive
1337,34,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"Of course, she's the star here"
1337,35,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"For the other actors, I wasn't really impressed with them"
1337,36,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,I wish the story was written differently to bring out their best talent
1337,38,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"Bruh, I didn't enjoy the pacing"
1337,39,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"Too much tense and emotional scenes, it felt like a drag"
1337,40,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,I actually zoned out during Bongbong and Ferdinand's scene
1337,41,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,And I saw two people on their phones during that scene too
1337,42,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"I was expecting a good breathe of air after that but Irene's scene came next, I think"
1337,43,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Hopefully my memory isn't bad
1337,44,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Also maid Biday's presence during that scene felt so out of place
1337,45,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,I actually found it funny but it still didn't fit in appropriately
1337,46,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,I wish the household staff had more scenes on their own since I felt they were important people in the story
1337,47,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"If the story was written to not focus so much on the family but the Palace as a whole, I would've found it more interesting"
1337,48,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,The balance between serious and comedy needs improvement
1337,49,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"Last thing, Robin Padilla's cameo was goddamn too cringe"
1337,50,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,What is this
1337,51,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,The MCU
1337,52,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,Welcome to the Malacañang-verse
1337,53,kittengab,2022-08-08 00:00:00.000,,imdb,"And IRM 2022 during the Bongbong & Imelda scene was, er, cheesy"

1503,1,khelx,2023-11-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"Very underwhelming, tried hard not to fall asleep - whilst at certain points very informative but in others just noisy with no true depth in the narrative or dialogue of the story"
1503,2,khelx,2023-11-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,It tried to do something that it unfortunately did not reach and the movie plainly makes the Marcos’ look like Martyrs in the making
1503,3,khelx,2023-11-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Still… very informative of the events that occured at that time
1504,1,villonesvey,2023-11-12 14:50:28.305,10.0,ltbx,parang ang asim ng cast
1506,1,pussilog,2023-10-19 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,watched (online for free) for a film criticism assignment and holy shit that was such a humbling experience (realized my vocabulary isn't enough to describe how terrible this film is and how much i grieve the time i have spent watching)
1507,1,sophasaurus,2023-10-17 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,marcos family can suck my ass
1508,1,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,+ Let's start with the few positives
1508,2,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,How this film looks is amazing
1508,3,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"Though, for most of the time, people are just standing and exchanging dialogues, the colors of this film really feels like a step-up, relative to Filipino comedies and teleseryes"
1508,4,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"Also, I guess I liked how it utilized old news footages"
1508,5,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"And, that's pretty much it"
1508,6,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"+ Anyways, leaving all politics aside (even though it's hard to do so), if we are going to just view this on the technicality of film making and writing, it's bad"
1508,7,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"The writing, sound design, and score are overly dramatic clichés you would expect from a family drama, a low-brow comedy, and from a historical and political biopic"
1508,8,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"Though I appreciate the long takes as it really let's the drama feel natural, however, it also exposes just aforementioned poor writing because it's dialogue that serves nothing to progress the story other than sending their propaganda"
1508,9,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"+ But truly, one cannot really discuss how this film is written without acknowledging the context of which it arose from"
1508,10,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"If we really dissect the film, it will not stop bleeding ""Marcos Apologist"" and historical revisionism"
1508,11,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,It is also troubling how the film really conveniently is not interested in truly discussing the politics with enough rigor and discipline
1508,12,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,It really overly simplifies the entire EDSA People Power to just a dangerous riot orchestrated by power hungry politicians
1508,13,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"It leaves out all the complexity of the political climate, as well as all the money laundering which sparked the entire social crisis"
1508,14,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Not to mention the violences inflicted during the Martial Law
1508,15,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"There really is the sense that Daryll Yap, the director and writer, was only really interested in telling one minute moment of this dark but important part of Philippine history"
1508,16,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,And he did not even discipline himself enough to not fall prey to self-indulgence
1508,17,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"He really wrote it as if its a novel which ironically, made all of the actors in this film feel like they are overacting"
1508,18,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,+ What is also troubling is how it did not even shy away from truly depicting the regal and glamorous life of the Marcos' in Malacañang
1508,19,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"From the number of loyal maids, every wall plastered with life size portraits, easy international travels, among others"
1508,20,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"And with that kind of glamorous mise en scene, the audacity of this film to mention that the Marcos are not elitists, and that it's the reason for the hate they get"
1508,21,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"+ Christine Reyes, portraying a younger Sen"
1508,22,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"Imee Marcos, who happens to be a creative and executive producer of this film, had the highest screen time with acting that knows only to scream frantically"
1508,23,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"It really is interesting that the senator allowed herself to be depicted and written like this, a controlling paranoid daughter flustered by their family's downfall"
1508,24,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,And how they revealed she is the Maid in Malacañang
1508,26,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,+ And let me just point out how blasphemous this film can get sometimes
1508,27,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Other than the regal mise en scene that competes with churches and their number of Christian iconographies
1508,28,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"The scene where President Marcos scolds his son, Bongbong Marcos, the camera gradually and steadily circles around the two as they exchange their dramatic dialogue"
1508,29,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,The scene is honestly one that I can appreciate because of how it chose to keep this camera circling them technique continue on one long take
1508,30,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"But during this long take, there are a handful of moments when the ceiling lights goes behind the President's head resembles a saint with a halo"
1508,31,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"It's a small nitpick but, dear Jesus, this film really wants to be on the Marcos' good side"
1508,32,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"+ Another nitpick I want to highlight is how in the scene where Bongbong and Imelda Marcos are talking, they seem to have overestimated the Philippine government after the Dictatorship, stating once they leave, the people of the Philippines would do everything not to let them come back"
1508,33,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"It does make the audience wonder, and potentially realize the failures of the republic that came after"
1508,34,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"But what bothers me is this will only paint the democratic and liberal ideas, that should govern us, with yellow And because of it, the discourse of political awareness goes down as just another color contest"
1508,35,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"And that ""IRM 2022"" just screams corny"
1508,36,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,+ There's no substance to this film other than the blatant propagandist nature of it
1508,37,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"I recommend watching, not to support this types of film, but to persecute it"
1509,1,keithhuman,2023-09-19 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST FILMS OF ALL TIME
1509,2,keithhuman,2023-09-19 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,Never regretted hating it
1510,1,pochitaa,2023-09-15 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I like the soundtrack
1511,1,123gir_hermione,2023-08-22 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,Should not have been made

1524,1,ajtn05,2023-07-18 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,The Robin Padilla cameo was real
1524,2,ajtn05,2023-07-18 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"Anyways, I thought it was supposed to be a propaganda piece but it doesn't really work as one"
1524,3,ajtn05,2023-07-18 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"I guess if you already like the Marcoses, maybe you'll like them more, but if you're a critic, it will do nothing to change your views on them"
1524,4,ajtn05,2023-07-18 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"In terms of the technical aspect of the movie, its pretty decent"
1524,5,ajtn05,2023-07-18 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,The composition and camerawork look good when contrasted with some of the soulless garbage that have come out of Hollywood recently
1524,6,ajtn05,2023-07-18 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"The performances, if they were done in a different context would have been considered compelling"
1524,7,ajtn05,2023-07-18 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"None of that however, changes the fact that it is a shameless attempt to make you sympathize with the people who destroyed this country and also as a bonus, happens to be directed by a pedophile"
1524,8,ajtn05,2023-07-18 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"pero nakasavage ako sa ML habang nanonood nito, so half-star"
1525,1,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"Nakakahiya lang…Looking for a movie to assist with Tagalog exposure, I thought this one might stand out amid what looked mostly like a sea of lukewarm romantic comedies"
1525,2,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"As it happens, this was substantially worse than I could possibly have feared about the others"
1525,3,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,You know you’re in trouble right from the jump when Imee Marcos is listed as both a creative and executive producer and then turns out to be the main character of the film
1525,4,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"I suppose you can’t blame the Marcos clan for trying to further whitewash history now that they’ve fully completed their comeback with the ascension of Bongbong to the presidency a month before this was released, but I almost wonder why they even bothered when the attempt was so dire"
1525,5,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"This movie is two hours long and it could have cut down to about 20 minutes total - most of the runtime is occupied by interminable scenes of characters saying anything and everything they’re thinking, none of which would be particularly interesting even if most of it weren’t focused on the thesis that Ferdinand Marcos was not an oppressive dictator but rather a Great Man who Loved His People, Actually"
1525,6,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,Even by Filipino movie standards the overacting is intense - virtually every member of the main cast gets at least one showpiece to absolutely devour the scenery
1525,7,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"The actress playing Imee screams so much she must have needed a lozenge by the end of filming (how this was intended as a flattering portrait of a producer of the film I have no idea, but I guess she is referred to as a “genius” multiple times)"
1525,8,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,This reminded me of nothing so much as the kind of thing that might be dumped out by American *cough* “auteur” Dinesh D’Souza
1525,9,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"It evinces absolutely zero talent on the part of anyone involved - the acting stinks, the writing would stink even if the message weren’t horrendous, the tone lurches wildly between melodrama and slapstick for no apparent reason, and the long takes (with their constantly moving camera) are insanely tedious"
1525,10,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,Paul Thomas Anderson this ain’t
1525,11,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"But you actually have to appreciate how badly this is made - if this were a better movie, it might actually have some hope of convincing people of what it’s trying to do"
1525,12,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,But it’s such a mess it’s hard to imagine anyone getting all the way through unless they’re already enormous Marcos fans or absolute gluttons for punishment like me
1525,13,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"For anyone else, don’t waste your time, and I do mean waste"

1611,7,shuafilms,2023-02-11 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,call it trash as much as you want but it is undeniable how this is such strong material for Marcos propaganda
1611,8,shuafilms,2023-02-11 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,the Marcoses were put in such a good light and it's easy to empathize with them after seeing this if you are in the latitude of noncommitnent

1613,7,chuzen,2023-02-10 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"nonetheless, i found this to be more entertaining than basically any lav diaz film i’ve seen, and less offensive than the racist film of (the otherwise great auteur) mike de leon (both of whom - rightfully so - are marcos critics)"
1613,8,chuzen,2023-02-10 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"at least with maid in malacanang i knew what to expect - diaz is so pretentious i dgaf how much my politics align with his, and the fact that filipinos ignore the (not even casual) racism of kakabakaba ka ba really makes me want to bash my brains out"
