Yet, the movie didn't give the experience of a family in their last 72 hours

The progression of events is anti-climactic

The flow of conversation is hollow

The choice of words contribute to the hollowness

The storytelling is disorderly

Continuously changes format narratives

I think if they stuck to a ""documentary"" type of movie it would've fit well

They didn't know what to tell and how to tell it, so it became an amalgamation of every movie format possible

They just combined all their scenes by inserting ""chapters"" and ""long texts"" in between that literally summarizes what they want to tell-which defeats the purpose of a movie

Cristine Reyes carried the movie, Ella Cruz has solid crying acts

Cesar Montano, playing the infamous dictator, has no semblance of the supposed 'strongman' traits of the one he's playing Diego Loyzaga literally has no emotion

Others didn't do anything Looking at you Kiko Estrada

Misrepresentation of nuns with Giselle Sanchez playing mahjong already crosses this film out as a supposed ""addition"" to history, since said nuns are cloistered

Usage of words that were not present those days, but are yet frequently heard in the movie

Usage of musical scores are way off, since most of the scores play in scenes that are unremarkable

Then by the end, there's a weird and sudden tribute to characters that were not given its decent exposure during the actual movie runtime"

Maid in Malacañang,1081,2,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,This is a non paid review for this film
Maid in Malacañang,1081,3,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,Unlike trolls who reviewed this film and gave this bad marks without watching it
Maid in Malacañang,1081,4,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,So to start
Maid in Malacañang,1081,5,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,I don't like it
Maid in Malacañang,1081,6,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,But read along before you attack with torches and hurl insults
Maid in Malacañang,1081,7,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,Here are reasons why
Maid in Malacañang,1081,8,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"(Warning : Few Spoilers)

This is not a historical movie"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,9,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"If you want to see something stronger, then watch Brocka's banned movie or actual news footage"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,10,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"Not a movie told from the perspective of the producer, the director or the award giving bodies"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,11,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"If you are expecting a revisionist movie like dispelling rumours about the Marcoses excesses and opulence, this is not for you"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,12,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"It doesn't hide their wealth and their control of people around them - from the luxury-wearing zero-gravity moving Imelda, to the scary bossy angered Imee, the party going camou-wearing brave-wanting Bonget"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,13,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,No sugar coating here - they are revealed as spoiled people
Maid in Malacañang,1081,14,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"It doesn't portray the Marcoses as the bravest souls as they show here how they spiraled to their fears and frustrations, the latter shown by former President FEM himself"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,15,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"If you are expecting them to be portrayed here as a blameless hero family, they aren't as even Irene

It doesn't show the Marcoses as the most powerful family in the country as they too failed to save their entire extended household (meaning those who lived long with them in the palace)"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,16,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"The mahjong scene that irked many before the actual showing revealed the figures who were more powerful, and I emphasize, were as it is passe"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,17,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,And it is not the one who sat at the mahjong table but the bigger entity some tried to represent mockingly
Maid in Malacañang,1081,18,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,It didn't show the atrocities during Martial Law nor it depicted further the evil side of many politicians some have come to worship for decades
Maid in Malacañang,1081,19,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,Nor did it tackle the roots of what made Martial Law to be declared
Maid in Malacañang,1081,20,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"It didn't utilise more some actors like Elizabeth Oropesa, the controversial Ella Cruz and even the most hated actress now for portraying the symbolic yellow wearing saint, Gieselle Sanchez"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,21,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,I feel like some scenes really got stolen much by the superb timing and acting of Beverly Salviejo aka Manang Biday
Maid in Malacañang,1081,22,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"But it did reveal some things that would make more people ponder, especially with the ""what ifs"""
Maid in Malacañang,1081,23,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"Highly entertaining as was the movie, I am left with questions after seeing it as the pieces still don't feel complete"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,24,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"With many puzzle pieces hidden before like actual video clips of how the palace was stormed and yes, burned (as there are actual reports to such in the news), the actual announcements to join EDSA uprising (I wish they put recordings of those actual announcements of Sin calling the faithful), to the big reveal for some that Marcoses were aimed to be killed by friends and some organised people, I can't help but ponder is the running time enough for film or is this better a series"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,25,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,Some things are made clear here though
Maid in Malacañang,1081,26,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"First, and I won't be apologetic"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,27,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,This is a middle finger movie to Ramos who died days before the movie was shown
Maid in Malacañang,1081,28,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,Maybe he chose to die before his humiliation can be revealed that he was indeed part of planners to kill off the first family
Maid in Malacañang,1081,29,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,I know BBM paid respects but the Maid in Malacañang didn't and I understand her for that
Maid in Malacañang,1081,30,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,This is also a big middle finger movie to family and friends who betray us for politics
Maid in Malacañang,1081,31,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,Darryl never shies away from controversy and arguments
Maid in Malacañang,1081,32,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,With the 2022 election campaign being hailed as the most toxic we experienced (and maybe the worst of all time)
Maid in Malacañang,1081,33,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,The lines hit hard that you eat on the same plate with people who wish you dead
Maid in Malacañang,1081,34,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"Sadly, toxicity is shared on the plate"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,35,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,This is not a hate film though
Maid in Malacañang,1081,36,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"In fact, it is a beautifully crafted melodrama with light touches of humor and reference to 80s, to telenovelas and even PRRD's expletives"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,37,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"The music was superb, the pacing mostly on point but always easy to follow and the acting delivered credibly by everyone in the main cast"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,38,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"If Cesar Montano and Beverly Salviejo don't get awards here, we know some directors probably thought to award it to someone else and found their own reflections"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,39,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,Darryl also is masterful in creating memorable lines like how he delivered with his notoriously popular LenLen series
Maid in Malacañang,1081,40,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,My dad kept repeating some of the lines he remembered and I of course love villains so you know whose I remember the most
Maid in Malacañang,1081,41,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"Add the symbolisms, references and mild swearing he put may look or sound cliche for some but those are reminders that this movie is not perfect nor the people shown in it"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,42,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"It doesn't lie like others hailing their own as absolute truth and true masterpiece that must be seen again (and I say again as not much watched the first run, it wouldn't earn either with a re-run if not put side by side with Maid in Malacañang)"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,43,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,It doesn't lie that it is not without creative liberties meant to stir emotions at almost every chapter as they hit the right nerves at most points
Maid in Malacañang,1081,44,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,Maid in Malacañang is not a movie made to justify lies as others claim it would be
Maid in Malacañang,1081,45,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"Rather, it presents itself as a vulnerable piece prone to dissection - hence chapters"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,46,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"It is highly entertaining as it is thought provoking, tear inducing, BP raising, heart warming"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,47,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,So I don't like it
Maid in Malacañang,1081,48,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,I love it
Maid in Malacañang,1081,49,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,"PS the final mahjong scene looks funny in the trailers but it is actually a sinister dark energy filled take, from the daunting music which reminds of The Omen, to the evil spewed out lines to the closing of hands playing with yellows"
Maid in Malacañang,1081,50,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,A promotion of what was to come
Maid in Malacañang,1081,51,atsharamusic,2022-08-06 00:00:00.000,90.0,imdb,Darryl should make a horror film continuation about this
Maid in Malacañang,1082,1,kukawbubuh,2022-08-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,imdb,"A Real Eye Opener: For those wondering how much lies we had been fed with for the last 36 years, this movie, based on the last 72 hours of the Marcos family will give you the other side of the story"

Maid in Malacañang,1507,1,sophasaurus,2023-10-17 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,marcos family can suck my ass
Maid in Malacañang,1508,1,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,+ Let's start with the few positives
Maid in Malacañang,1508,2,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,How this film looks is amazing
Maid in Malacañang,1508,3,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Though, for most of the time, people are just standing and exchanging dialogues, the colors of this film really feels like a step-up, relative to Filipino comedies and teleseryes"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,4,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Also, I guess I liked how it utilized old news footages"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,5,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"And, that's pretty much it"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,6,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"+ Anyways, leaving all politics aside (even though it's hard to do so), if we are going to just view this on the technicality of film making and writing, it's bad"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,7,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The writing, sound design, and score are overly dramatic clichés you would expect from a family drama, a low-brow comedy, and from a historical and political biopic"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,8,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Though I appreciate the long takes as it really let's the drama feel natural, however, it also exposes just aforementioned poor writing because it's dialogue that serves nothing to progress the story other than sending their propaganda"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,9,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"+ But truly, one cannot really discuss how this film is written without acknowledging the context of which it arose from"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,10,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"If we really dissect the film, it will not stop bleeding ""Marcos Apologist"" and historical revisionism"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,11,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It is also troubling how the film really conveniently is not interested in truly discussing the politics with enough rigor and discipline
Maid in Malacañang,1508,12,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It really overly simplifies the entire EDSA People Power to just a dangerous riot orchestrated by power hungry politicians
Maid in Malacañang,1508,13,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It leaves out all the complexity of the political climate, as well as all the money laundering which sparked the entire social crisis"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,14,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Not to mention the violences inflicted during the Martial Law
Maid in Malacañang,1508,15,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"There really is the sense that Daryll Yap, the director and writer, was only really interested in telling one minute moment of this dark but important part of Philippine history"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,16,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,And he did not even discipline himself enough to not fall prey to self-indulgence
Maid in Malacañang,1508,17,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"He really wrote it as if its a novel which ironically, made all of the actors in this film feel like they are overacting"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,18,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,+ What is also troubling is how it did not even shy away from truly depicting the regal and glamorous life of the Marcos' in Malacañang
Maid in Malacañang,1508,19,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"From the number of loyal maids, every wall plastered with life size portraits, easy international travels, among others"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,20,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"And with that kind of glamorous mise en scene, the audacity of this film to mention that the Marcos are not elitists, and that it's the reason for the hate they get"

Maid in Malacañang,1508,22,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Imee Marcos, who happens to be a creative and executive producer of this film, had the highest screen time with acting that knows only to scream frantically"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,23,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It really is interesting that the senator allowed herself to be depicted and written like this, a controlling paranoid daughter flustered by their family's downfall"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,24,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,And how they revealed she is the Maid in Malacañang
Maid in Malacañang,1508,26,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,+ And let me just point out how blasphemous this film can get sometimes
Maid in Malacañang,1508,27,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Other than the regal mise en scene that competes with churches and their number of Christian iconographies
Maid in Malacañang,1508,28,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The scene where President Marcos scolds his son, Bongbong Marcos, the camera gradually and steadily circles around the two as they exchange their dramatic dialogue"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,29,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The scene is honestly one that I can appreciate because of how it chose to keep this camera circling them technique continue on one long take
Maid in Malacañang,1508,30,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"But during this long take, there are a handful of moments when the ceiling lights goes behind the President's head resembles a saint with a halo"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,31,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It's a small nitpick but, dear Jesus, this film really wants to be on the Marcos' good side"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,32,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"+ Another nitpick I want to highlight is how in the scene where Bongbong and Imelda Marcos are talking, they seem to have overestimated the Philippine government after the Dictatorship, stating once they leave, the people of the Philippines would do everything not to let them come back"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,33,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It does make the audience wonder, and potentially realize the failures of the republic that came after"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,34,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"But what bothers me is this will only paint the democratic and liberal ideas, that should govern us, with yellow And because of it, the discourse of political awareness goes down as just another color contest"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,35,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"And that ""IRM 2022"" just screams corny"
Maid in Malacañang,1508,36,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,+ There's no substance to this film other than the blatant propagandist nature of it
Maid in Malacañang,1508,37,lhyemarp,2023-10-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"I recommend watching, not to support this types of film, but to persecute it"

Maid in Malacañang,1525,2,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"As it happens, this was substantially worse than I could possibly have feared about the others"
Maid in Malacañang,1525,3,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,You know you’re in trouble right from the jump when Imee Marcos is listed as both a creative and executive producer and then turns out to be the main character of the film
Maid in Malacañang,1525,4,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"I suppose you can’t blame the Marcos clan for trying to further whitewash history now that they’ve fully completed their comeback with the ascension of Bongbong to the presidency a month before this was released, but I almost wonder why they even bothered when the attempt was so dire"
Maid in Malacañang,1525,5,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"This movie is two hours long and it could have cut down to about 20 minutes total - most of the runtime is occupied by interminable scenes of characters saying anything and everything they’re thinking, none of which would be particularly interesting even if most of it weren’t focused on the thesis that Ferdinand Marcos was not an oppressive dictator but rather a Great Man who Loved His People, Actually"
Maid in Malacañang,1525,6,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Even by Filipino movie standards the overacting is intense - virtually every member of the main cast gets at least one showpiece to absolutely devour the scenery
Maid in Malacañang,1525,7,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"The actress playing Imee screams so much she must have needed a lozenge by the end of filming (how this was intended as a flattering portrait of a producer of the film I have no idea, but I guess she is referred to as a “genius” multiple times)"
Maid in Malacañang,1525,8,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,This reminded me of nothing so much as the kind of thing that might be dumped out by American *cough* “auteur” Dinesh D’Souza
Maid in Malacañang,1525,9,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"It evinces absolutely zero talent on the part of anyone involved - the acting stinks, the writing would stink even if the message weren’t horrendous, the tone lurches wildly between melodrama and slapstick for no apparent reason, and the long takes (with their constantly moving camera) are insanely tedious"
Maid in Malacañang,1525,10,windiermegatons,2023-07-12 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,Paul Thomas Anderson this ain’t

Maid in Malacañang,1613,2,chuzen,2023-02-10 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"thus, the way to view this film is as a window to how delusional the marcoses and their supporters are"

Maid in Malacañang,1889,123,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Giselle Sanchez's depiction of Democracy Icon Cory Aquino is her worst acting ever that could damage her career
Maid in Malacañang,1889,124,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,That post-credit scene where Cory play mahjong with the Carmelite Sisters in Cebu is a malicious smear to the undisputed Revolutionary and Democracy Icon
Maid in Malacañang,1889,125,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's even a blatant attack on the Carmelite Sisters as well
Maid in Malacañang,1889,126,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But at least this is considered to be a post-credit scene that is actually not an integral part of the main story and message of the film
Maid in Malacañang,1889,127,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This malicious scene could be easily taken away on future releases on television, Vivamax & other streaming sites & on official physical copies,In case the Carmelite Sisters or the Aquino estate would file an injuction order to the courts against the film"
Maid in Malacañang,1889,128,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But that mahjong scene is part of Darryl Yap's cinematically poetic metaphor reinforcing its message that no political ruler or ideology would last forever
Maid in Malacañang,1889,129,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Panahon-panahon lang ang pulitika
Maid in Malacañang,1889,130,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,As there is also a mahjong scene in Imee Marcos's residence at the beginning of the film
Maid in Malacañang,1889,131,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And that Robin Padilla cameo scene truly shows that he's a sellout
Maid in Malacañang,1889,132,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I remembered his past interviews that he idolizes Che Guevarra & other armed revolutionaries

Maid in Malacañang,1889,134,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"So Robin Padilla projecting his bad boy, rebel, revolutionary persona on movies is nothing but a farce"
Maid in Malacañang,1889,135,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Robin Padilla is truly a sell-out and a tool

Maid in Malacañang,1889,137,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"""Maid In Malacañang"" is a creative decent art film that does not primarily alter, revise or distort our Philippine history, except for the last scene out of ""poetic justice"""
Maid in Malacañang,1889,138,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film embraces actual history accepting the fate of the Marcoses falling from grace as their dictatorship is collapsing in front of them just as stipulated from a dictator's playbook
Maid in Malacañang,1889,139,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But inspite of the Marcos's downfall, they still put their heads up high and salvage whatever dignity is left from them to finally leave the Philippines effectively ending their brutal dictatorship"
Maid in Malacañang,1889,140,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is what the film is all about
Maid in Malacañang,1889,141,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Very harmless, accessible and even interesting"

Maid in Malacañang,1889,145,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, whatever the film DOES NOT SAY, makes it truly BAD"
Maid in Malacañang,1889,146,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film continues to depict the Marcoses as the fallen victims of their impending doom
Maid in Malacañang,1889,147,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And those angry rallyists storming Malacañang really look rabid and inhumane (Since most these rallyists are actually rabid Communist militant activists who should be wearning red not yellow
Maid in Malacañang,1889,149,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film keeps on stressing that the Marcoses are betrayed, coerced & are ousted for the patriarch is a probinsyano which is utterly ridiculous"
Maid in Malacañang,1889,150,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But what the film FAILED to show is the background behind the call to oust Marcos from power
Maid in Malacañang,1889,151,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Surely, there are actual historical reasons why there are loud clamors for the Marcos to finally step down and to get out of the Philippines"
Maid in Malacañang,1889,152,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's surprising that ""Maid In Malacañang"" does not mention the Marcos dictatorship and Martial Law itself"
Maid in Malacañang,1889,153,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film does not let the Marcos characters reflect or retrospect their 20+ years of Marcos rule and dictatorship
Maid in Malacañang,1889,154,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film does not even justify why the elder President Marcos has to declare Martial Law and even address the Cold War & Communist insurgency as an excusable reason for Marcos to declare Martial Law and rule as a dictator in order to save the Philippines
Maid in Malacañang,1889,155,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"No refelections or justifications are made on the First Quarter Storm, Martial Law & the Marcos dictatorship ruling with an iron first"

Maid in Malacañang,1889,161,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Perhaps narrating the context & events behind President Bongbong Marcos walking along Chinese Communist leader Mao Ze Dong would be a great idea for a movie that would put the Marcoses in a good respectable reputation
Maid in Malacañang,1889,162,chasingmovies,2022-08-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"With the dicator's son as our current President, I would expect a Heneral Luna-like movie about the dictator Ferdinand Marcos"

Maid in Malacañang,1966,4,adrianmoviez,2022-08-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,but the fact that they put this in IMAX was just sad
Maid in Malacañang,1967,1,jansol,2022-08-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The ""source material"" lends to much more and the film could have been executed better without being too melodramatic for those who just want to see a proper historical film adaptation and without being too propagandist for the subject's political rivals; near the end of the film almost of the characters have spouted general, grand statements of how another character is supposed to be and what he's not supposed to be"
Maid in Malacañang,1967,2,jansol,2022-08-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The titular characters aren't even the main focus of the film
Maid in Malacañang,1967,3,jansol,2022-08-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The authenticity of the film, despite the touch of old logo of the production company, the setting, the cars, the aspect ratio are lost becuase rather than not being lazy and have the actors replaced the original people in the background photos and paintings, we see the real people instead"
Maid in Malacañang,1967,4,jansol,2022-08-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The tension was undercut due to screen narration rather than being the underlying atmosphere of the historicla situation and the melodramatic scenes being topped-off with Marvel-like comic quips

Maid in Malacañang,1972,1,jaelenebrielle,2022-08-28 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,This film is just (inaccurately) telling the events instead of showing by displaying searchable documented videos and bland text cards
Maid in Malacañang,1972,2,jaelenebrielle,2022-08-28 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"What they do show is just jarring, out-of-place comedy along with weak melodramatic characters screaming at and crying with each other"
Maid in Malacañang,1972,3,jaelenebrielle,2022-08-28 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"Constant, repetitive dialogue suggesting that former President Marcos’s drive was to serve his people simply defaults this movie to propaganda, not to mention that one of his daughters Imee being creative producer of this film proves this movie feebly attempted to shine favorable light on the Marcos family name"
Maid in Malacañang,1972,4,jaelenebrielle,2022-08-28 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"Despite all the political issues with this film, this movie on its own shows that Filipino cinema is sadly sticking to its stale teleserye-esque writing and unlayered acting and trying to advance by following empty stylistic cinematographic and aesthetic choices"
Maid in Malacañang,1973,1,kristinebauti3,2022-08-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It shows an “unreleastic” POV of what the Marcoses have gone through
