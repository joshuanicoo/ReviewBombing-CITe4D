0,2,IAmRalphTrani,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,imdb,"It's like every filipino horror film, always start with a jumpscare or a suspense already, this makes every scare in the movie expected"

4,4,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,The way they CGI'd Gloria Diaz was cringey AF

4,8,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,It looked so fake I couldn't take him seriously
4,9,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,They honestly should've just invested on the cast's makeup or prosthetics to make everything look convincing
4,10,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,I honestly could not help but compare it to cult favorite Filipino horror movies like Feng Shui and Sukob
4,11,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,No CGIs there but it was definitely scarier and more realistic by a mile
4,12,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"I still gave it four stars because, okay, it was ambitious - I'll give them that"
4,13,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,But it was too ambitious it failed to just stick to what people came to watch the movie for - Fr

5,1,katrinamacaballug,2024-07-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,imdb,The script is lacking
5,2,katrinamacaballug,2024-07-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,imdb,: The stort is about the first serial killer accounted even before jack the ripper and I really expected for it to have more eccentricities or edge in it's script alone wherein the whole concept of the movie is about the dark side of the Philippine history
5,3,katrinamacaballug,2024-07-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,imdb,"The jumpscares are not that good as well, the acting of the main characters are lacking as well"
5,4,katrinamacaballug,2024-07-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,imdb,"However, kudos to the production team in having that courage to showcase a fresh idea in the mainstream entertainment, I have been hearing this in documentaries and podcasts for quite sometime already but not to actually watch it and be reinvented"

7,4,darkgreymatter,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,"Regrettably, the movie's downside lies in the inclusion of unnecessary jump scares, creating an abrupt disruption in the flow of the film"
7,5,darkgreymatter,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,imdb,This drawback proves to be a significant dent in the overall quality of an otherwise promising story

8,4,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,The movie falls on a lot of tropes
8,5,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"It has a lot of cheap jumpscares, and I wish they'd have used more of the runtime of the film to flesh out the story, rather than use it on not-so-great jumpscares"
8,6,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"The cinematography for this film was good, as well as the acting, but the script was just okay- this isn't to say the story is bad but the dialogue could've been written better"
8,7,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"The story *is* ambitious, but I feel as if it wasn't fleshed out enough to be worthy of a rewatch, and the script is okay, but it did definitely wasn't good"

8,9,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"Basically, a character was walking in the night, in the middle of the forest while having e-s*x"

8,11,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"The scene wasn't that sexually explicit, but the dialogue, as well as the character's hand motions made it uncomfortable to watch"
8,12,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"If the dialogue's purpose in that scene was to be humorous, it failed- as when I watched it in a packed theater, most were silent, even when said character was hacked to death"
8,13,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"There are more scenes to where I feel the film jumps the shark, like when a character loses their keys in an struggle with the murderer, but end up knocking them out, then going down to try and escape using their car but realizing they don't have it then going back to where the murderer is just for the key"
8,14,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,"Then a scene where the same character very clearly has the ability to kill the murderer, but does not despite the murderer having clear killing intent"
8,15,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,imdb,I feel like this scenes like this spefically devalues and reduces the enjoyment of the film for some

67,4,cmbynfred,2025-11-09 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It’s not perfect — the pacing dips at times, and some twists feel a bit too heavy-handed — but its ambition and emotion more than make up for it"
67,5,cmbynfred,2025-11-09 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,You can tell it’s a film made with vision and courage
67,6,cmbynfred,2025-11-09 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Mallari isn’t just a horror story; it’s a tragic reflection on guilt, faith, and the darkness that lingers inside us all"

71,5,kalbryne,2025-11-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The storyline was okay for me—not that outstanding, just okay"
71,6,kalbryne,2025-11-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Now that I’ve rewatched it, I still find the visuals, production, and cinematography stunning"

71,8,kalbryne,2025-11-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Like, yeah, it’s trying everything but still gives nothing, which comes off a bit messy"

71,10,kalbryne,2025-11-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"For me, it could’ve been better if they focused more on the biography of Mallari rather than adding a touch of modernity to his story"
71,11,kalbryne,2025-11-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Nevertheless, this film is a huge step up for the Philippine horror movie industry"

73,2,mattypd,2025-11-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I think this movie would’ve benefited greatly from focusing on that aspect rather than trying to build a modern day story around it
73,3,mattypd,2025-11-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The (very handsome) lead actor did a great job playing three different parts, I just think the actual horror story of the priest’s actions/motivations is a better story than the ghost stuff that carried us through to modern times"

320,1,coffayebean,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"didnt expect a lot when i started this, but i certainly wasn’t expecting THAT"

322,1,questopwatching,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,piolo’s face card saved this movie i fear
324,1,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Mallari is a rare offering in Philippine cinema, a genre piece that dares to excavate spiritual dread through a historical lens, delivering both psychological unease and cultural reflection with surprising sophistication"
324,2,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Inspired by true events, the film braids fact and fiction with eerie precision, conjuring a portrait of evil that is neither gratuitous nor shallow"
324,3,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"It does not sensationalize its horror, but rather embeds it within the folds of human frailty, trauma and unspoken guilt"
324,4,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"What emerges is a haunting exploration of generational sin: how belief systems, when warped by grief and power, can descend into darkness"
324,5,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Pascual commands the screen with a quiet, brooding intensity, shifting seamlessly across timelines and psyches"
324,6,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"His performance anchors the film's ambitious structure, which traverses multiple epochs without losing thematic coherence"
324,7,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The supporting cast enriches the tapestry, though it is Pascual's psychological unraveling that most compellingly draws the viewer into Mallari's descent"
324,8,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The cinematography is meticulously composed, leveraging lighting and period detail to amplify atmosphere rather than overshadow it"
324,9,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"There is enough restraint in the visual language, a refusal to rely on cheap thrills, that allows the dread to simmer rather than erupt"
324,10,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The score, too, underscores the unease without overwhelming the narrative, enhancing moments of revelation with quiet dread"
324,11,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Mallari is a meditation on guilt, belief, and the persistence of evil across generations"
324,12,jmsurio_,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"In summoning the ghosts of the past, it forces the viewers to confront the ones we still live with"

343,1,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I was really hyped for this one
343,2,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Like, really"
343,3,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I’ve spent hours researching Juan Severino Mallari myself — not even kidding, I know more about serial killers than I do about algebra"
343,4,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,His story
343,6,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,A priest who killed over 57 people just to try and heal his sick mother
343,7,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"That’s the kind of dark, layered horror story I LIVE for"
343,8,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,So when I found out there was a whole-ass movie about him
343,9,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I was on it
343,10,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I had that trailer play a few times, even YouTube e-mailed my ass and said, ""bitch, you gonna watch something else"
343,11,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,""" But I remember being hyped to watch it tonight, and boy…This movie felt like homework"
343,12,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Long, bloated, and just a messy watch"
343,13,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,They seriously took creative liberties with Mallari’s story — and not in a good way
343,14,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Like, that's not how his mother was treated, at all  And don’t even get me started on the VFX… I’ve seen better CGI on 2009 YouTube screamers"
343,15,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It gave unauthorized fan film with a budget
343,16,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,What stings the most is how much potential it had
343,17,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"They could’ve easily made a 90-minute slasher film set between 1816–1826, and it would've eaten"
343,18,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"But instead, they threw in this confusing-ass time travel angle"
343,19,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Girl, be serious"
343,20,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,And suddenly it’s supernatural
343,21,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,No thanks
343,22,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The kills were predictable, mostly off-screen, and the rare on-screen ones were so over-the-top they looked fake"
343,23,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"It felt like the director just watched Insidious once and said, ""Yeah, I can do that"
343,24,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"""I will say — it tried to be interesting"
343,25,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,But this felt like someone's first time making a horror film… and it showed
343,26,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"If they stripped it back to its core — the madness, the religious guilt, the murders — it could’ve been powerful"
343,27,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Instead, it was a drag"
343,28,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"A stylish, confused, occasionally interesting drag"
343,29,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,My expectations were way too high
343,30,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I should’ve grabbed a glass with a beverage to carry my ass through, dimmed the lights, and lowered my standards"
343,31,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"But meanwhile, the guy who played Severino Mallari"
343,33,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Like fine as hell, no debate"
343,34,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"When he showed up on screen in that priest getup, I literally whispered, ""Hellooooo, fatherrrr…"" The man was serving murderous thirst trap and I was eating it up"
343,35,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,But even that face card couldn’t save this mess of a movie
343,36,ninetieslashers,2025-07-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"While it’s not terrible, it’s definitely not good either"

457,2,ebbimae,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Severino Mallari when I was in 10th grade for our written essay in Filipino
457,3,ebbimae,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,He was a 19th-century Catholic priest from Pampanga who was said to be the first recorded serial killer in the Philippines
457,4,ebbimae,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"He was reportedly mentally ill and murdered at least 57 people, believing that each death would help cure his ailing mother"
457,5,ebbimae,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,He was eventually imprisoned and later executed by hanging
457,6,ebbimae,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,His case is considered one of the earliest recorded instances of serial killing in the country — and yet it has been largely forgotten in mainstream Philippine history until recently
457,7,ebbimae,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"So when the movie Mallari was first aired, my older sister and I immediately watched it out of both curiosity and excitement to see how director Derick Cabrido would portray such a dark and complex figure on screen"
457,8,ebbimae,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Although the movie adds a heavy layer of fiction — including themes of reincarnation, supernatural visions, and a futuristic timeline (which clearly didn't happen in real life) — it was still incredibly engaging to watch"
457,9,ebbimae,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual did an excellent job portraying three different characters across the film's distinct timelines
457,10,ebbimae,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"He carried the emotional and psychological weight of the role with such depth, especially in the scenes where guilt and madness were most apparent"

458,2,qualityapeman,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The storyline is a really interesting time travelling horror mystery
458,3,qualityapeman,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It can be a bit convoluted at times, but it's also incredibly ambitious and refreshing"
458,4,qualityapeman,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,A tighter script would have helped tremendously
458,5,qualityapeman,2025-06-18 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Sadly, the film relies too much on cheap jump scares with poor digital effects, especially in its first half"

696,2,kitchienadoll,2025-04-13 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I remember a subreddit i read saying that perhaps part of the reason why this isn’t really a “thing” here is because we had been preoccupied with survival that the thought of butchering someone never really occurred to our untapped minds lolThis film was ambitious and I like how they went the extra mile to incorporate folklore and science fiction into this but unf the appeal of these elements didn’t quite translate as strongly as I had hoped
696,3,kitchienadoll,2025-04-13 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"If anything, I think this just made the story and timeline a bit convoluted—time travel and all"

731,1,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"A Beautifully Shot, But Clunky and Overstuffed Horror AttemptI watched Mallari out of curiosity, intrigued by its premise and the promise of psychological horror—my favorite genre"
731,2,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"My partner and I decided to give it a go, and while there were some strong points, the film ultimately felt like a wasted opportunity"
731,3,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The Good: • The cinematography, color grading, and framing choices were stunning"
731,4,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Certain scenes had a distinct, almost painterly quality that added to the film’s eerie atmosphere"
731,5,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"• Piolo Pascual delivered a solid performance, effectively portraying three different characters despite criticisms that he was just “playing himself in three fonts"
731,6,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,” • JC Santos completely stole the show in his final scenes
731,7,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,His performance was so gripping that I found myself thinking he might have been a better fit for Juan Severino Mallari
731,8,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The Bad:1
731,9,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Repetitive and Meaningless Scares • The eyeless souls were unsettling at first, but after the third time, they felt like cheap filler rather than an effective horror element"
731,10,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,• The film never explains why the souls are trapped in the house when they were murdered elsewhere
731,11,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,• The scene with the children breaking into the house felt unnecessary—what was its purpose
731,13,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"A Confused, Overstuffed Narrative • The film tries to be everything at once—supernatural horror, historical thriller, cult mystery, and even a time-travel story—but ends up feeling like a jumbled mess"
731,14,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,• Juan Severino Mallari was a real historical figure—the first recorded Filipino serial killer
731,15,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Instead of leaning into historical horror and exploring corruption within the colonial church (which would have been a logical reason for how he got away with 57 murders), the film adds a convoluted subplot about a cult of witches raising a supernatural “sisiw” entity"
731,16,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,• The cult’s motivations are unclear—do they want immortality
731,17,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Revenge against the ruling class
731,19,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It’s never explained
731,20,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,They just need a vessel for the sisiw… so they can take care of it
731,21,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,• There was already enough real-life material to craft a compelling 1800s storyline without forcing in aswang elements and cults
731,22,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Instead, the film almost seems to justify Mallari’s killings, framing him as a tragic figure rather than a murderer"
731,24,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Inconsistent Character Writing and Awkward Shifts • Gloria Diaz’s character starts as an abusive, religiously fanatical noblewoman, hinting at her darker tendencies"
731,25,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"But midway through the film, she’s suddenly framed as an innocent victim"
731,26,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"This abrupt shift feels forced, as if the filmmakers changed their minds halfway through"
731,27,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,• The CGI transformation scene (especially the “Gollum” filter on Gloria Diaz) was jarring and unconvincing
731,28,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,• Johnrey turning into a werewolf after taking the sisiw was the moment I officially gave up trying to rationalize anything in the film
731,29,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"At that point, I just thought, Okay sure, do whatever, it’s your movie"
731,30,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"• Then they introduced time travel through astral projection, which ultimately did nothing to resolve the story’s core conflicts"
731,32,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Forced and Cringe-Worthy Romance • The relationship between Jonathan (Piolo Pascual) and Agnes (Janella Salvador) had zero chemistry
731,33,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"• Agnes, despite being introduced as an intelligent doctor, was completely one-dimensional"
731,34,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Her dialogue felt forced and unnatural, which wasn’t helped by Janella’s flat performance"
731,35,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,• The romance subplot added nothing to the film
731,36,redbricksweater,2025-03-31 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Jonathan could have uncovered his family’s dark history on his own without a love interest tagging along

1008,1,otsotso,2025-01-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Quite disappointed
1008,2,otsotso,2025-01-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It was partly my fault for expecting that this movie would focus on the serial killer aspect and push that horror genre (maybe crime too) but it never really did any of the sort
1008,3,otsotso,2025-01-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It has jumps scares, which at first, when you barely have any information about the movie is slightly effective"
1008,4,otsotso,2025-01-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"However, those jump scares are just that, a jump scare and it does not lead into anything"
1008,5,otsotso,2025-01-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I expected more
1008,6,otsotso,2025-01-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Half-way through the movie, when sufficient information have been given to clue you in on the direction it wants to take, it gradually lost its lustre"
1008,7,otsotso,2025-01-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"By then, it focused a lot on the supernatural and the ideas within the film began to feel too much"
1008,8,otsotso,2025-01-01 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Some of the ideas were interesting, and some of them were straight up dumb"

1022,1,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"*long review & slight spoilers ahead* ""Mallari"" (2023) had the potential to be a compelling film, but unfortunately, it fell short of expectations"
1022,2,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The plot felt disjointed and rushed, with certain plot points (such as the astral projection and the curse) introduced abruptly and without proper development"
1022,3,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The narrative suffered from trying to do too much (shocking considering the runtime), ultimately deviating from what could have been a more focused and impactful story"
1022,4,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"While the film attempted to address the theme of mental health in the context of religious influence, it missed the opportunity to delve deeper into this complex issue"
1022,5,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Instead, it resorted to familiar Filipino horror tropes, relying on excessive ""fear factor"", predictable and unnecessary jump-scare placements, and plot twists that detracted from the overall narrative"
1022,6,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"I wish they could have possibly explored the Marxist perspective on the use of black magic as a form of resistance by the oppressed class against the ruling class, instead of just completely antagonizing/demonizing the workers of the Mallari family"
1022,7,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"One redeeming aspect of the film was its cinematography and color grading, which were visually striking and well-executed"
1022,8,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"However, the technical merits couldn't salvage the film's shortcomings in storytelling and thematic exploration"
1022,9,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"""Mallari"" could have been a powerful commentary on the historical and social context of mental health in the Philippines"
1022,10,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Instead, it became a fictionalized account that missed the opportunity to engage with more profound and meaningful themes"
1022,11,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"I can’t help but have a sour taste on my mouth given that we live in a political climate where history is being distorted, and where this film got its inspiration from is still a piece of history"
1022,12,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Overall, ""Mallari"" is a film with unrealized potential"
1022,13,migseu,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Its narrative flaws and heavy reliance on genre conventions overshadow its technical achievements and prevent it from being a truly impactful narrative

1642,24,cameronwjohnson,2024-08-01 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"This struggles for find coherent pacing in its wildly nonlinear story, bound by awkwardly moralistic subplots and clunky writing unto classically cloying pop slasher/horror tropes, still elevated enough by the intriguing plot, themes and lead performance(s) for those rousing thrills to salvage Roderick Cabrido's ""Mallari"" as a soul-chilling, if a little braindead representation of evil through history"

1808,3,kahzumi,2024-06-25 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,"Plus, I thought I was getting a historical serial killer thriller"
1808,4,kahzumi,2024-06-25 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,Instead I got a religious fantasy horror that wasn’t even done well

1816,2,ricaptured,2024-07-20 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,i thought the film would be based on the true events of Mallari’s killings and it turned out to be a horror film instead of a thriller
1817,1,chocobutternutb,2024-07-20 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,ayoko sa balut
1818,1,jeselle,2024-07-20 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,ang gwapo talaga ni piolo pascual sa kahit anong henerasyon

1820,1,itsearlthepearl,2024-07-20 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"At the side of the discussion of ""Gomburza"" (2023) as definitely the Filipino film for that year lies ""Mallari,"" which had a plot and premise that is so inviting and attractive"
1820,2,itsearlthepearl,2024-07-20 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"I love how this film was composed, coming from a historical drama which (unfortunately) removed its history and replaced it with folk mystery"
1820,3,itsearlthepearl,2024-07-20 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"As a horror film, it brought the classic tropes that make it as a recognizable 2020s Filipino horror film, much like the curse that the Mallari clan supposedly carried"
1820,4,itsearlthepearl,2024-07-20 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"The plot was mostly well-done, with a decent sequence (maybe except for some parts), the cast also were done well"
1820,5,itsearlthepearl,2024-07-20 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"Add to that a sprinkle of existential moralizing about personhood, decisions, the past, and the future"
1820,6,itsearlthepearl,2024-07-20 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,It has the perfect concoctions of an Eastern / Asian movie with Western elements
1820,7,itsearlthepearl,2024-07-20 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"Although some points for improvement: I wish that there were less jumpscare moments that did not progress the plot forward, more historical elements melded into the mystery of the curse, and BETTER MUSIC, which I believe should have been filled more with orchestric slow music that conveys more drama than horror, which could also make its frightening atmosphere lasting and subtle"
1821,1,hannahbishii,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"When the Aswangs said that they will be only heard if someone from higher hierarchy of society will speak for them, I felt it"
1821,2,hannahbishii,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,That's reality
1821,3,hannahbishii,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Poor people doesn't have a voice; only the people with money and status can speak out for their concerns because everyone will listen
1821,4,hannahbishii,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, it's doesn't justify the curse of their family and the killings"
1821,5,hannahbishii,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It just doesn't make sense

1876,3,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"i anticipated its netflix release for a long time and i wish i could say that it was giving everything and more,, but given my misguided, and quite frankly, very steep expectations the only thing i can say right now is that it was extremely promising if only they focused on the structure of the story better and made more practical choices"
1876,4,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,by practical i mean mostly in terms of the special effects for the creatures and the way they aged the actors
1876,5,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,they could have just used prosthetics and other more tangible effects and it would have looked far more believable and less jarring/out of place as opposed to the visual effects that were present throughout the entire material
1876,6,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,as for the story
1876,7,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,i really liked the way it enriched and utilized lower mythology and how they incorporated the various time periods in the philippines
1876,8,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"the superstitions, mixed with factual elements, and everything in the story comprising and lending filipino-ness to the film was refreshing as opposed to the constant cliches and re-hashing of tired tropes from the west in most horror films we encounter in mainstream filipino media"
1876,9,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"the antagonist was easy to spot early on in the film, i think it was a mix of the foreshadowing/direction and the acting"
1876,10,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,perhaps they could have made less obvious choices on both the acting and script to be able to make the reveal less predictable
1876,11,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,also there were parts in the script wherein they could have removed the dialogue
1876,12,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,too much tell and not enough show
1876,13,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,there were so many unnecessary monologues and it kind of removed me from urgent scenes wherein i would have appreciated just SEEING what the characters were saying out loud
1876,14,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,it's a film
1876,15,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,SHOW don't TELL right
1876,16,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,the story also only really picked up its pace in the final 1/4 part of the entire running time which is a bummer
1876,17,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,honestly it could have been trimmed down if only they removed some unnecessary monologues
1876,18,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,if they did this the pacing of the entire film could have been better i think
1876,19,aleiaanies,2024-07-17 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"overall i enjoyed it, i just felt disappointed because it could have been a cinematic masterpiece"

1878,1,cescamae,2024-07-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,plot was really interesting
1878,2,cescamae,2024-07-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"although, the sfx makeup was underwhelming it could've been more gory and horrifying"
1878,3,cescamae,2024-07-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,ALSO severino's facial hair is taking me outtt what was thaaaaaat
1878,4,cescamae,2024-07-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"and the cgi was not seamless huhu u can literally tell doña facunda's face is about to fall awff in her last scene,, it reminds me of reneesmee T_T"
1878,5,cescamae,2024-07-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,production design is good though
1878,6,cescamae,2024-07-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"overall, there's something empty about it i cannot pinpoint what but something about it feels short"
1878,7,cescamae,2024-07-16 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"but the plot is there, the music is good as well, and the production wowww"

2282,3,_deknees,2024-07-04 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,the correlation of witchcraft and curses could’ve been good if it was executed better
2282,4,_deknees,2024-07-04 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,The astral projection shit was just an excuse to make the movie longer and idk it just felt like the plot as whole was lacking something

2286,2,unraveling,2024-07-04 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,the title is basically carrying his name – make it about him and not this astral projection whatsoever

2312,1,cazzlacman,2024-07-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,ok i didn't expect this elaborate of a storyline because i thought it would be a generic like following the life of fr mallari but the jumps between generations made it more interesting
2312,2,cazzlacman,2024-07-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,im always a fan of these timetravel(
2312,3,cazzlacman,2024-07-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,) bullshit timeline bullshit so i was so seated
2312,4,cazzlacman,2024-07-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,there are moments that didn't needed to be there because it literally ruined the movie for me personally
2312,5,cazzlacman,2024-07-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,the special effects and the dialogue at times
2312,6,cazzlacman,2024-07-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,like casually saying kiffy like what the fuck it was funny but damn ruined it for me

2312,12,cazzlacman,2024-07-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,everything did kinda wrapped all together nicely and i understood everything but how it concluded kinda disappointed me so
2312,13,cazzlacman,2024-07-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,overall fun and cool watch especially the inclusion of the ph history and legends around that time

2490,3,mmkl,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,—because this just goes to show to never underestimate the middle children

2490,9,mmkl,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The ending, tying all the stakes to Jonathan’s choices, love, and mistakes, is probably the only end of the road that I will accept given that this film’s agenda was to take things up a notch from the current movie landscape that can be seen in our locality"
2490,10,mmkl,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Johnrey (being my favorite of the Mallari men, so let me once again shine a light on him) was there to create contrast, moral ambiguities, and drive the stakes into an extensive pitfall—and the pitfall was just that, balls-deep"
2490,11,mmkl,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Mallari, then, for all its worth and not just the ending, was an adventurous take of the Filipino supernatural lores, the historical figure that heralded the first serial killings sighted in the country, and the ambition to create a noir motion picture avant-garde among films in the industry that are still struggling to get away from the love teams and third-parties formula"
2490,12,mmkl,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Perhaps, the glaring criticism to be made is the shortcomings in execution that anchored what turned to be just potential by the end"

2490,18,mmkl,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"On the note of acknowledging Jonathan, his storyline couldn’t have happened without the intergenerational storyline connecting the characters that Piolo Pascual embodied"
2490,19,mmkl,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It is with such element, aided by time traveling and the use of vintage themes, that Mallari became what it is: an explored genre"
2490,20,mmkl,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"In spite of my criticisms, it was still a hard work to have made a movie such as this one, and even harder still to execute interconnected storylines resulting to an impressionable film—of that, it was never a doubt"
2490,21,mmkl,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I do hope that directors and production crews alike take note of choices, as expounded in the story, and the film itself in its entirety, for future projects"

2583,2,lordgallenghein,2024-06-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,One thing I must admit is that the film has great spectacular production sets & designs
2583,3,lordgallenghein,2024-06-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,And it's such a shame that it was implemented for this horror film with cheap jump scares and unnecessary time-traveling twist to make the premise so interesting
2583,4,lordgallenghein,2024-06-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I wished the story should've been like GomBurZa

2583,7,lordgallenghein,2024-06-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I said ""loosely based"" because the film even adds two unnecessary fictional characters related to Mallari"
2583,8,lordgallenghein,2024-06-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The Mallari trio is played by none other than Piolo Pascual
2583,9,lordgallenghein,2024-06-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"It is very impressive for one actor to play three roles in this film, but his ""present"" Mallari performance was so unconvincing throughout the film, compared to his two roles"

2583,11,lordgallenghein,2024-06-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The story is complicated and it makes me wonder what are they trying to tell other than Mallari's actions for his killings
2583,12,lordgallenghein,2024-06-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I can't get enough about this time-travelling twist
2583,13,lordgallenghein,2024-06-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It creates a turmoil to its story that I can't describe and say anything positive about it

3085,5,spidejrr,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Mallari has gone through as well as how he was persecuted and convicted

3163,2,acebron,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The movie spans tropes from thriller, sci-fi, folklore, historical, romance, even family drama genres"
3163,3,acebron,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Many interesting threads woven together, sure, but the design of this script could have been less busy so we could appreciate each one – personally, I would have liked more of a story behind the dark magic stuff so that it would be less of a twist in the final act and more of a creepy world long hidden in the shadows"
3163,4,acebron,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Also, since the main character is a priest, a peek into the social climate of the church-centered 1800s provincial barrio would have been interesting (though I guess we already have Gomburza in the MMFF lineup to show us something like it)"
3163,5,acebron,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"This is a horror movie with high-quality visuals, so you'd think the scares should at least be good"

3163,9,acebron,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Mostly, it's thanks to a solid cast led by Piolo Pascual as three different characters and his friend Lucas played by JC Santos"

3167,4,niborquinones,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Enjoyment of it depends on your willingness to accept whatever it throws on you
3167,5,niborquinones,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Astral projection, time travel, manananggal — they are all present here and it is admirable how the film balances all of these elements, jumping from one concept to another with ease"
3167,6,niborquinones,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It helps that at the center of it is Piolo Pascual delivering his most exciting performance in years, and leading a solid cast"

3181,2,lovejazzy,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,the entirety of it was just equsite and just what you expectedsome little things that bothered me a bit were that the reveal of the origin and stuff felt a bit rushed and didn't feel like it had the same dramatics that was persistent throughout the film which i expected to see there (this is a bit nitpicky i admit) and the ending felt a bit of a big fall from the energy of the climax which was just amazing
3181,3,lovejazzy,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,BUT OVERALL just so damn amazing

3183,3,jokinnie,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"i just dislike how the first half is very slow tapos sa remaining minutes parang sobrang dami nang nangyayari, kinda puts me off"
3183,4,jokinnie,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,the pacing could’ve been better i think plus the ending was a bit let down
3184,1,eniaaal,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Overall, I think the story is quite interesting"
3184,2,eniaaal,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The execution though, they were trying to congest a lot of plots that loopholes were starting to emerge"

3186,2,femfatalee,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"we got to see different genres of piolo, he was creepy asl as severino"
3186,3,femfatalee,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"honestly the jumpscares were too predictable and has a weak build up, wished they didn’t just dropped random jumpscares"
3186,4,femfatalee,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"nonetheless, definitely one of my fave scenes was the bayle with her mother"

3191,2,allenmollo,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"i thought the first half of this film was gripping, i liked the idea of tying three generations of Mallari’s"
3191,3,allenmollo,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,pero nawala na ako nung may manananggal element na pati yung binhi from ‘magandang hatinggabi’
3191,6,allenmollo,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"ang galing ni piolo dito though, it’s giving aga muhlach in ‘sa aking mga kamay’"
3191,7,allenmollo,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,too bad na wala halos documentation sa mga pinaslang ni fr
3191,9,allenmollo,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,it would’ve given the film more focus
3192,1,samami,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"If there’s one thing I appreciated about mallari, it’s definitely the intentionality of it all"
3192,2,samami,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Each scene was there for a reason and the whole film was building up to a perfectly full circle
3192,3,samami,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Satisfying to see how it all came together but i feel like the film was too full circle that some parts were just predictable
3192,4,samami,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I loved how mallari explored Filipino folklore because istg mfs be sleepin on that shit
3192,5,samami,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The sci-fi twist was definitely interesting and I can’t say that I hated it
3192,6,samami,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Honestly it kept me even more interested because I wanted to see how piolo pascual’s acting would survive in a sci-fi setting lawlz
3192,7,samami,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Moral of the story: Ang pagibig nga naman… But also I love how the ending kinda explored something I think about at the end of the horror movies when the survivor walks off before the credits roll
3192,8,samami,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Coz it’s like ok you survive but what quality of life are u rlly walking into
3192,9,samami,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"And when the girl said in the end that he should’ve just let her die, I was like damn fax that’s what I’m saying"
3193,1,mariaantonio,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"piolo pascual was incredible here, i think i now get his appeal to all the titas and lolas out there"
3193,2,mariaantonio,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,wish we’ve gotten a more focused material revolving around the story of father mallari
3194,1,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Mallari excels as a mystery/thriller, skillfully interweaving Fr"
3194,2,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Severino Mallari's story with Filipino mythology, delving into themes of love, sacrifice, and the supernatural"
3194,3,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"For those seeking heart-pounding horror and intense scares, this might not cater to your expectations"
3194,4,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Piolo Pascual's outstanding portrayal of three distinct characters remains a highlight, although some supporting actors struggle to match his depth, impacting the film's overall cohesiveness"
3194,5,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Additionally, attempts at modern dialogue occasionally feel forced, aiming to resonate with contemporary audiences but often missing the mark"
3194,6,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"However, it falls short in certain technical aspects, with some special effects momentarily disrupting the immersion"
3194,7,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Moreover, the excessive use of predictable jump scares might disappoint those seeking a more nuanced and suspenseful thriller experience"
3194,8,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"While the narrative's non-linear structure converges effectively, some scenes in the first act might feel eye-roll-worthy"
3194,9,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Despite these initial hiccups, Mallari gains momentum over time"
3194,10,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The clever interweaving of timelines culminates in a gripping third act, redeeming the movie's earlier flaws"
3194,11,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Noteworthy performances, including JC Santos's compelling contribution, complement the film's exploration of mythology and folklore"
3194,12,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Ultimately, Mallari remains a captivating watch for enthusiasts of intricate storytelling, showcasing Pascual's remarkable acting abilities"
3194,13,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"As it navigates through love, sacrifice, and the supernatural, Mallari's imperfect yet engaging portrayal leaves an indelible mark, resonating with those fascinated by the depths of human experience and the enigmatic allure of Filipino folklore"
3194,14,pm1spicy,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Peak Filipino cinema is back on the menu
3195,1,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Mallari, the 3rd film I’ve seen this MMFF 2023"
3195,2,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Maybe I was expecting it to be good but it left me pretty disappointed
3195,3,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Pros: Sound design was pretty effective
3195,4,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I think JC Santos and Piolo Pascual’s acting was effective
3195,5,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Cons: Convoluted story made it hard to understand
3195,6,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"I like non-linear storytelling, but in this case, It wasn’t executed properly"
3195,7,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The dialogues were cringey
3195,8,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Aside from JC and Piolo, the supporting cast didn’t help in elevating the movie"
3195,9,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I don’t know if its bad writing or the actors didn’t give the script justice
3195,10,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The insertion of humor is unnecessary and didn’t add anything to the table
3195,11,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I wish that they have stick to a specific storyline of the 1st Pinoy serial killer instead of adding storylines involving Filipino mythology and creatures
3195,12,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It guises itself to be complex but ended up dumbing the whole thing out
3195,13,pilbiray,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Visual effects could be better
3196,1,nccampo,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,the only thing redeemable about this movie is Papa P on a tank top
3197,1,arjaycl,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Ang daming gustong sabihin, pero wala namang impact"
3197,2,arjaycl,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I'd appreciate it more if they just focused on one timeline and on the killer aspect
3197,3,arjaycl,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It relies on jumpscares too much
3197,4,arjaycl,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The dialogues are also awkward - trying too hard
3197,5,arjaycl,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The acting of JC Santos was so good though
3198,1,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The nonlinear structure, intercutting with three different timelines, finding the connection with its sometimes steady or stagnant pacing, finds its way nowhere near home"
3198,2,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"A must-be realization for Enrico Santos, the screenwriter"
3198,3,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The killing never stops, but producing a big project with magnificent visuals with, no disrespect, a very disappointing writing shall stop"
3198,4,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Forty-five minutes into the cinema, the film finally makes sense that the intro is trying to foreshadow — manlalakbays"
3198,5,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,No question about it
3198,6,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, the use of jump scares to prolong the first act of the film is way too traditional or 2000s"
3198,7,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Those do not contribute nor give any hint at all on why Piolo is in search of answers to their three generations of Mallari’s story
3198,8,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Admittedly, the first hour can be shortened to 15-25 minutes"
3198,9,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Remove the jump scares
3198,10,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Just do not feed anything information through visuals; then that alone is enough for the audience to feel the genre
3198,11,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"A bummer, still, is the used dialogues to tell a piece of information about either the timeline of the present or the story of past Piolo generations"
3198,12,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It could have used the very evident big budget to convey information through visuals instead of throwing lines
3198,13,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Imagine, the film is visually pleasing and plausible, but it does not give anything or help in the progress of the plot"
3198,14,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Such, such a waste of opportunity"
3198,15,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The detour part of this journey is beauty — production visuals and cinematography
3198,16,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,All-in production design
3198,17,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The worlds, as in three different timelines, are well put together"
3198,18,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,No one dares to refute or even question its costume or the artistic choice; the use of wardrobes and prosthetics
3198,19,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It speaks so much about how the audience accepts the world is shown, displayed, and given to them"
3198,20,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Not an easy task to build a world that the audience can easily comprehend, but Mallari does it, and mind you, building THREE TIMELINES"
3198,21,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Moreover, the sound design and music score need recognition"
3198,22,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Although the need for a revisit in sound mixing due to its inconsistent loudness is a must, it still is a world-class quality"
3198,23,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"These perfectly and exactly convey the emotion of the characters, as well as the atmosphere of different sequences"
3198,24,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Neither a riser nor a drone are instruments or techniques used in the film
3198,25,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,An example is the use of bells as a score while killing the landlord in 1812
3198,26,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Feels bad for Piolo Pascual in a good manner
3198,27,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,He looks exhausted by performing three characters with different distinctive personalities but conveys it justly and rightly
3198,28,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,He may soon retire after pulling off such a performance in Mallari
3198,29,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,No one can do that
3198,30,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Despite the negatives, the film counters its flaws through a good, well-thought mise-en-scene"
3198,31,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The job of director does well in directing, putting all together by using each department’s strengths while masquerading its lows"
3198,32,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"In simple terms, the film is in the right hands, the right job, and the right driver"
3198,33,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Writing aside due to its being subpar, all goes well"
3198,34,yenfilmreview,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The audience just needs to learn and get used to it
3199,1,noodkadito,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Mallari successfully weaved an intricate tale of horror w/ a dash of sci-fi & folklore
3199,2,noodkadito,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It's heart however, which is a tale of love, is actually what prevented me 4m giving it a higher score"
3199,3,noodkadito,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It set back its own visual myth by excessive jump scares and didacticism
3199,4,noodkadito,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Pasimplehin natin, minurder ni Enrico Santos yung sarili niyang script sa dulo with cheesy declarations na para bang bigla akong nanood ng Cathy Garcia Molina film"
3199,5,noodkadito,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Yung shift gear ni Derrick Cabrido to borderline campy sa dulo eh magegets mo, ito parang tinamad o nilagnat nung sa dulo"
3199,6,noodkadito,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Even though it draws inspiration from Insidious and Suspiria, it has managed to be unique and memorable"
3199,7,noodkadito,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Di ba, mga ka-sisiw"
3200,1,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The concept of having three generations of Mallari, delving on folklore and catholicism is the strength of this film"
3200,2,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Although it was based from the true story of Fr
3200,3,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Severino Mallari's serial killing, it was fictionalized by creating a generation of Mallari to show how love and curse overlap over the course of time"
3200,4,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Is curse inevitable, is anything done for love be justified, are the existential questions that can be seen with the acts of the three main characters"
3200,5,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, despite its good points, it has to be said that it has dumb and unnecessary parts for the sake of being called horror, like most horror films, of course"
3200,6,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It holds so much potential
3200,7,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Maybe that's why it's ambitious for wanting a lot to happen
3200,8,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Glad that transitions are good in the middle because the beginning seemed shaky to me due to its overuse of jumpscares (that are, by the way, predictable)"
3200,9,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Also, I see that it has to involve folklore, but does it really have to include the scene of Facunda transforming into a manananggal (just one of the many weird stuff)"
3200,10,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The belief of killing to save more lives is enough to incorporate it
3200,11,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"As to script, it's as if there's not much research on language use"
3200,12,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"As a Kapampangan, the sudden switch from Filipino to Kapampangan to Filipino again didn't seem natural, as if it was only used to show it explored the setting but failed nonetheless"
3200,13,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The usage of Tagalog as to period is a bit inappropriate as well
3200,14,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Overall, the attempt to tell the story of the first serial killer in the Philippines in a creative way is something I can appreciate"
3200,15,anjelx1,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I just wish it's more psychological
3201,1,nicocollantes,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,This film earns every praise
3201,2,nicocollantes,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"From the cinematography, direction, acting, color grading, editing, sound design, and musical score, this is unlike any Filipino horror film in recent history"
3201,3,nicocollantes,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"While the writing and handling of multiple timelines can sometimes feel jarring, it was redeemed by its dark tone, atmosphere, twists, and a story that feels unique and very ambitious"
3201,4,nicocollantes,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual is excellent in portraying the three lead characters
3201,5,nicocollantes,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"But the real surprise here is JC Santos, who gave an impressive performance as Brother Lucas"
3201,6,nicocollantes,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The rest of the cast gave it their all, too"
3201,7,nicocollantes,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The theme song for this film by juan karlos and Quest is *chef's kiss*

3206,1,watchwithj,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It was okay
3206,2,watchwithj,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I got lost when her mother became a manananggal

3207,2,mxkyla,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"nevertheless, watching this gave me so much hope for ph horror films"
3207,3,mxkyla,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"mallari’s story, production design, scoring, and of course, piolo’s acting were all so impressive"

3210,2,jehon,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"there was also this priest afraid of ""woke culture"" and getting cancelled so my brain shut down every time he was on screen lol"
3211,1,meewars,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"apart from the cheesy dialogue on some parts, this was actually a pretty good horror movie"
3211,2,meewars,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,reminded me of the classic feng shui
3211,3,meewars,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,best actor papapi and best supporting actor jc santos indeed
3212,1,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Padre Severino Mallari is the first document serial killer from the Philippines with 57 victims under his name
3212,2,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It was believed that his mother was cursed thats why Mallari resorted to unaliving to counter the black magic
3212,3,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"What really left an impression for me from this film is the line saying, we are all Severino"
3212,4,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Parang sinasabi sa atin na lahat tayo ay may bersyon ng sarili nating halimaw
3212,5,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,And this clearly seen in the movie
3212,6,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,His mother’s curse had its own form
3212,7,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Years later the curse takes on a different form when it moves to its next body
3212,8,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,And along those lines we discover how intergenerational trauma is passed on
3212,9,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,At the same time it lets us explore the deep end of what we can do when we are pushed to the brink
3212,10,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,How much of ourselves we are willing to sacrifice in order to save a loved one
3212,11,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Blurring the lines between right and wrong
3212,12,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,At napakagaling ni Piolo Pascual having to portray 3 different characters struggling along those lines
3212,13,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Hindi ako as much a big fan of jump scares but i appreciate it when done well
3212,14,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But not so much on this movie and the sound design made it a bit more cliche
3212,15,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Although i greatly appreciate the score though, mas nadagdagan ang tension and atmosphere ng mga scenes na nakakatakot"
3212,16,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"This film excels in a lot of its technical aspects, from cinematography, production design, costumes and editing"
3212,17,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,And it makes it worth the cinema ticket to watch this on the big screen
3212,18,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Was really impressed at Mallari
3212,19,reyraymundv,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Shoutout sa katabi ko kanina sa cinema na di ko kilala na tumalon sa kanyang upuan after one of the jump scares
3213,1,malingwarrior,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,This movie is only a fun watch if you are in the cinema with everyone laughing and screaming
3213,2,malingwarrior,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Production design is also great
3213,3,malingwarrior,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,But by itself without spoiling anything the film is both obtuse/confusing and over explained at the same time
3213,4,malingwarrior,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Also it feels kinda lazy in the way it portrayed the local filipino villagers as this evil pagan force that is against the ""good"" of the catholic church and manipulates people to do evil things"
3213,5,malingwarrior,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It's like it wanted to show the desperation of these people and how they fight back- but decided not to resulting into this demonized portrayal of local culture and beliefs which sucks
3214,1,nicolebeatrizs,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Best Filipino movie I’ve ever watched
3214,2,nicolebeatrizs,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I believe that it can actually compete with international movies, that’s how good of a film Mallari is"
3214,3,nicolebeatrizs,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Stunning performances from Piolo Pascual and JC Santos
3214,4,nicolebeatrizs,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They’ll definitely bag the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor award
3215,1,veesuns,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"+ Top-tier actong from Piolo (3 generations), Janella, Elisse, Gloria Diaz, and JC santos+ i love how they designed the setting, it was effective in making the scenario unsettling"
3215,2,veesuns,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"+ the arrangement of the plot+ how they added filipino lore the story, which is bagay for the theme— napaka unnecessary ng jumpscares, it would've been effective if the cgi/makeup was good, but it's not— it would have been better if they focused on the thrill instead of jumpscares— the manananggal scene and the wolf: the cgi was too cringe"
3215,3,veesuns,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"hope they made thought of something different, lesser cgi"
3216,1,ferycinemafiles,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"ganda ng story telling lalo na yung nareveal lahat ng back story dun sa timeline na nagkasama sama lahat ng generation, but there’s really something (that i can’t point out) that made me kind of lose my engagement in the movie half way thru"
3216,2,ferycinemafiles,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"in short, may part talaga na inantok ko ako"
3216,3,ferycinemafiles,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"nonetheless, napaka galing ng buong cast"
3216,4,ferycinemafiles,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,the musical scoring was insane
3216,5,ferycinemafiles,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,i love it so much and the cinematography is god tier
3217,1,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,i looooved watching this pero i have a lot of totz
3217,2,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,obviously anlaki ng budget az andaming partner/sponsor pero i think that was kind of its downfall also
3217,3,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"like for example dahil may pambayad, nagcast ng napakalaking star na si papa p"
3217,4,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,i dont think this role was for him and sobrang nakulangan ako sa acting niya for 2/3 of the duration
3217,5,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,honestly the muchachas ate him up sa mga scenes nila together
3217,6,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,love them ang talented nila <3and then isa pa yung chemistry nila ni janella salvador
3217,7,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"first of all, ang weird lang kasi parang super different generations sila ng actors, and second of all wala lang talaga silang chemistry like nde ko maramdaman na totoo yung nangyayari sa screen"
3217,8,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,tapooos finally may budget for matinding cgi and actually bet ko ang pagkagawa dun sa eyeless ghosts (literally my #1 fear) KASO ginamitan rin nila ng cgi si ms gloria diaz and di siya kasing ganda nung ghosts
3217,9,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,feeling ko lang mas effective ang practical fx sa ganun especially since parang matandang kandila na natutunaw na ang look na habol (similar to the matanda sa X)
3217,10,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"seeing poor editing really takes you out of the experience :(sa screenplay side naman, i think visually, maganda ang kanyang ginawa sa larger plotline kaso yung dialogue talaga medyo nakakatanga"
3217,11,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,hindi ko magets bakit may napakagen z na dialogue
3217,12,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,para ba maemphasize na yun yung modern timeline
3217,13,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,i think it would have worked without that though kasi napakaiba naman ng costume and set design ng 1940s timeline
3217,14,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,ewan iritado lang ako sa masyadong chronically online dialogue kasi it really dates a film and kind of yun nga
3217,15,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,takes me out of the experience
3217,16,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,ang weird rin ng representation sa lgbt+ community
3217,17,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,i think they were trying to be woke pero why naman ganun pagkasulat sa kanya
3217,18,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,a flighty gay person who everyone knows is a sex worker catering to foreigners
3217,19,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,yan pa lang naaalala ko for now so might edit pag meron pa
3217,20,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,overall i enjoyed it pero this really would have been better with another lead actor
3217,21,yuwondrei,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"though some things are very similar sa The Dream Thieves by Maggie Stievfater, i think medyo original naman ang kanyang idea :)"

3250,1,erin666,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,oooh i honestly enjoyed this more than i expected
3250,2,erin666,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,piolo pascual was so good
3250,3,erin666,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,the plot was okay
3250,4,erin666,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,i'm a huge fan of time traveling themes and i like the way they used it
3250,5,erin666,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"overall, this was a fun watch and a whole trip"
3250,6,erin666,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"i just didn't like the cheap and unnecessary jumpscares in the beginning, and the really bad vfx  also hiiiii piolo pascual"
3251,1,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Two Piolos wrestling each other

3251,3,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,(Spoilers incoming)This almost worked
3251,4,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The 1800s sequences, in particular, are the film’s shining moments"
3251,5,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It was creepy and almost compelling — the occult infiltrating Christianity/the oppressed tearing down the elite from the inside are proof that this should’ve been a period piece
3251,6,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Still, this particular section of the film is also riddled with sins"
3251,7,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The crux of it (showing how Father Severino started with his murder spree) was believable but was not strong enough
3251,8,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"You mean, Father Severino is so downtrodden in faith that he resorted to do…that"
3251,9,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,In one request
3251,10,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The film didn’t even allow the character to explore options or resist
3251,11,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,A film about a crisis of faith
3251,13,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,A missed opportunity
3251,14,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,He was just a piece of this convoluted puzzle
3251,15,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,And when his faith was shattered
3251,16,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,No one batted an eye
3251,17,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,His relationship with his mother wasn’t explored enough nor who Father Severino really is — again why this should’ve been a period piece that began with his childhood
3251,18,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Well, this was tooled to be commercially successful and how else to fulfill that but peppering with deadly tropes — time travel, astral projection, love is also a curse shenanigans, innocent ghosts who also like scaring people for the heck of it, a dozen of jump scares, and TikTok humor"
3251,19,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Don’t get me wrong
3251,20,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,This was so much fun
3251,21,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Especially with a packed theater
3251,22,invadersim,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Mallari, unfortunately, hacked into many elements but only managed a minor cut"
3252,1,yvonniee,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,A horror movie that I actually enjoyed
3252,2,yvonniee,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Would give a 5 buuuut the manananggal scene was ehh
3253,1,gabryanz,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"from the get-go, mallari works with an interesting premise: the first documented serial killer in the country"
3253,2,gabryanz,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"it takes the story a step further by introducing two other timelines, with characters that interact through lucid dreaming"
3253,3,gabryanz,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"the story is weaved together spectacularly, as the threads among such time periods felt smooth and weren’t forced"
3253,4,gabryanz,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"the concept is set up nicely, providing sufficient suspense to keep one hooked throughout the movie"
3253,5,gabryanz,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,i guess my most major issue with it is its framing…
3254,1,amnqsia,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,we need of ph horror films like this - i think the movie's strength was that it was able to use existing information based on a real story and connect it to a fictional modern one in a way that isn't cheesy or over done- jc santos in roles like this pls
3254,3,amnqsia,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,he did such a great job with this film and made sure everyone knew he isn't an actor that's only good in…
3255,1,mauricelleson,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"While it does, at points, play like a pastiche of the most well-known genre tropes (not just horror), I am willing to overlook that nature of Mallari as what we get here, beyond the clichés, is a very meaty and layered story with pensive meditations on the bounds of a person’s love and familial loyalty"
3255,2,mauricelleson,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"As the film was running I was thinking of how they were going to resolve the story and while I couldn’t, at the time, pinpoint how I would want the story to wrap up, I could very well list a handful of ways how I wouldn’t want the film to end and, without spoiling anything, I think they really stuck the landing with that ending"
3255,3,mauricelleson,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"We may have different tastes and what we look for in films may be different but, Mallari, as a whole, is a film that just works, at least for me"
3255,4,mauricelleson,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I definitely recommend seeing this

3264,1,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Gorgeous production; it definitely surpassed my expectations a little bit, considering that it was a locally-made film"
3264,2,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,This is noteworthy as I don't watch them that often
3264,3,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, it is also different from what I expected"
3264,4,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I was anticipating something of a biopic, telling the story of the first-ever recorded PH serial killer"
3264,5,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The direction that the movie took was a bit different, but it's fine, as it was still interesting"
3264,6,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"For me, the jump scares were not that effective"
3264,7,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Considering that it is a high-budget and relatively costly production, you would expect great ones, but most of them were just cheap jump scares carried by loud sounds"
3264,8,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The film also focused on too many genres, such as family, horror, comedy, and fantasy, to name a few"
3264,9,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I wish those concepts were not overloaded so that we could focus more on the lore
3264,10,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The character of Lucas (JC Santos) was not that convincing, given that he had a huge role"
3264,11,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It felt lackluster due to his character's development
3264,12,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The pacing and direction were mediocre at best
3264,13,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"There were some highs where the theater was excited about what events might unfold next, screaming and just being hyped"
3264,14,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, there were also disadvantages, such as in the first act where the film was kinda hard to follow"
3264,15,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"On a positive note, the concept itself was enticing since it's about horror (my favorite genre), and the Philippine mythology was also showcased well"
3264,16,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual also looked great and proved himself to be a versatile actor
3264,17,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"His supporting cast also did really well, providing twists and more diversity"
3264,18,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"All in all, the concept was interesting; it just was not executed to its fullest"
3264,19,daivd_tr,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Elements were overloaded, and it was a bit hard to follow, but the cast was great, and the production is definitely a level up from its predecessors"

3272,4,inksandfilms,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Pero that’s not the focus naman of the film

3272,7,inksandfilms,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,You can clearly see the differences of each character that he played
3272,8,inksandfilms,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I really like how Piolo can show his emotions through his eyes
3272,9,inksandfilms,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The best
3272,10,inksandfilms,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"JC Santos, whom I don’t really like at all ( sorry, I might now have watched enough movies to say that I like him and his acting) I was surprised that I like his acting in this one"

3273,3,elai_,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The story itself is fast-paced and makes some crucial parts feel abrupt

3276,1,denlebantino,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual's portrayals of the three characters are mostly inconsistent and lacking nuance
3276,2,denlebantino,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,There are scenes where his Johnrey and his Jonathan are almost alike
3276,3,denlebantino,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"When his Severino and his Jonathan meet in one of the crucial scenes, the former seems to have become the latter"

3276,11,denlebantino,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It is JC Santos who is consistently impressive in the film
3276,12,denlebantino,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,His evolution comes to a riveting performance deserving of recognition
3276,13,denlebantino,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Watch out for this one scene where he outshines his co-actor
3276,14,denlebantino,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The film could have done more in terms of VFX
3276,15,denlebantino,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Its score could have been tempered for a more dramatic effect, but despite what the film lacks, it achieves something remarkable for the genre"
3276,16,denlebantino,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Enrico Santos wrote a screenplay that weaves an interesting mix of the horror and the time-travel narrative
3276,17,denlebantino,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The script is complemented with well-paced execution and engaging scenes
3276,18,denlebantino,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Overall, Mallari is a compelling watch--a Pinoy genre film not easy to forget"

3278,1,thejsv,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I’m not usually a fan of horror, but this one had vibes of Conjuring and Insidious that I couldn't ignore"
3278,2,thejsv,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"What got me hooked was how they spun the horror elements within a Filipino context, set against a historical backdrop"

3286,4,princesssison,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I was intrigued by the idea of a filipino serial killer but ofc it wouldn't be a filipino film without the element of family/tradition to it  overall it was a Meh movie and I wish they focused more on the history / setting of the real-life story it was based on
3286,5,princesssison,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,was quite an experience watching this alongside Kapampangans because the audiences' side comments that came with how the actors spoke the language made the experience more fun  also the collective and sometimes unnecessary screaming on the side HAHAHA

3294,3,riverkieran,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,This kind of horror movie would've sold in the late 2000s to early 2010s but now the style and direction this movie had is pretty outdated
3294,4,riverkieran,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Two stars because the cast, save for Gloria Diaz, was actually pretty good; the script isn't their fault"
3294,5,riverkieran,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"I've seen Janella Salvador's acting and coming from watching GomBurZa earlier in the day I know Piolo Pascual was awesome in that one, but no amount of acting talent can save a terrible script and story"

3299,6,ljcap,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"Then fictional characters Johnrey Mallari, a documentarist in 1948, and Jonathan Mallari, a doctor in the present day"
3300,1,kristana,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The commendable cinematography paints a visually arresting landscape, showcasing a keen eye for detail in every scene"
3300,2,kristana,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, the film's occasional dependence on excessively loud sounds for an eerie effect raises concerns about its subtlety and may potentially overpower the audience's senses"
3300,3,kristana,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"While the narrative unfolds, numerous unnecessary jump scares seem to be sprinkled throughout"
3300,4,kristana,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The inclusion of cheesy dialogue exchanges between Agnes and Jonathan, these moments, rather than enhancing the story, feel gratuitous and detract from the overall viewing experience"

3300,6,kristana,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, there are certain parts that leave some viewers questioning the subtlety of its approach"

3301,2,junmendoza,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It had the mass appeal of a true horror flick (including the character's dumb decisions) but still made sure that there were no loose ends

3301,5,junmendoza,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The 3 characters also needed a bit more distinction but still a commendable performance nonetheless
3301,6,junmendoza,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But probably the biggest blunder is how it was overscored
3301,7,junmendoza,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The source material I believe can shine by itself without us being dictated by the score on where to get scared

3363,3,jansol,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I would even recommend this as one to see among the current available selection of what to watch in the latest Manila Film festival

3379,2,macjohnearl,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"A really formally engrossing work, but potency doesn’t just stem from imagination"
3379,3,macjohnearl,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"As for every one step this film takes forward, it takes two steps back"
3379,4,macjohnearl,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"For Mallari, The presence of a tangible threat stems from our protagonist’s dream, and the fact that he can see"
3379,6,macjohnearl,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It deeply fails to create a sense of narrative urgency it needed until about halfway through, where suddenly it livens up its form and picks up a lot of heat"
3379,7,macjohnearl,2023-12-27 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"This is a movie that believes spectacle can be derived from the eruption of background music and a jagged, accelerated frame, which is ironic considering how listless it is a unit"

3386,3,krstnaiz,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"First of all I love the plot and the concept they have, they took an already interesting topic (Mallari, the first serial killer in the Philippines) and decided to play with it adding multiple themes and concepts and mixing genres to make the story interesting and enjoyable to watch"

3387,2,resurgamz,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,so implied ba na salot ang pagiging trans at sex worker

3391,2,mikel1921,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I always complain about majority of the mainstream Filipino movies because they always seem so uninspired
3391,3,mikel1921,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,They're usually either tired recreations of frustratingly melodramatic stories I've seen a million times over or they're copies of recently popular movies produced by other countries with a better film scene
3391,4,mikel1921,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,So I have to commend Roderick Cabrido and the rest of the filmmakers who worked on…
3392,1,bluedesvus,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The concept was great but there were so many ideas introduced that it all got so convoluted
3392,2,bluedesvus,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I came for a biopic of Padre Mallari but I got manananggal, kulam, etc"
3392,3,bluedesvus,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Although it was great that they added Filipino Mythology on the plot, it still feels like there were tons of ideas thrown around that it got so jarring"
3392,4,bluedesvus,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I love the idea of astral projection and time travel as it is not often seen in Filipino Horror movies, however, I feel like it got too much that you'd think this is not about Padre Mallari anymore"
3392,5,bluedesvus,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Also, I don't also feel any chemistry between Piolo and Janella"
3392,6,bluedesvus,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,They feel more like Uncle-Niece whenever they're together
3392,7,bluedesvus,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"And although, it's been instilled multiple times that Jonathan (Piolo) is obsessed with Agnes (Janella), I still don't feel it"
3392,8,bluedesvus,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Like they were not able to translate it on screen
3392,9,bluedesvus,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Also the theater in Evia fucked up the sound system so all through out the film, I was in a sour mood"
3392,10,bluedesvus,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Furthermore, It's been a while since I've actually watch a Pinoy Horror film so I was amazed by the camerawork"
3392,11,bluedesvus,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I think this could've been great as a series rather than a movie to fully tackle what they wanted to portray
3393,1,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"MMFF Marathon Disclaimer:I went in blind to all MMFF entries this year, no idea on it but the poster, didn't even check the genres"
3393,2,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,So expect me being surprised on most things
3393,3,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I liked it just because I love Piolo Pascual and JC Santos (most of all JC, but let's talk about that later) but I gotta admit storytelling of this has lots of room to improve"
3393,4,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It had a lot of jumpscares from ghosts that didn't lead to anywhere
3393,5,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I expected some payoff on the ghosts other than who they were, which was obvious on the getgo"
3393,6,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"When it was a slasher horror by the first act I was engaged gotta admit, but when the second act started and the time-traveling sci-fi direction went on the film kinda lost me"
3393,7,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"And when it went more fantastical by the third act by introducing witchcraft and a literal ""manananggal"" it lost me completely"
3393,8,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"As this is inspired from real events, I wish they just added upon the plot inspiration since that is an interesting story itself"
3393,9,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I was just put-off on the closing title cards where they debunked their own story just to clarify the real story, because it kind of defeated the film"
3393,10,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I feel like they accepted that the past 2 hours were fictional but then opening titles said it was inspired from true events
3393,11,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,On the brighter side I saw a LOT of improvements here
3393,12,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Color grade was stellar, and lighting design"
3393,13,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Night scenes were still visible (ehem hollywood for making night scenes literal darkness), also the VFX and make-up for the spirits were BEAUTIFUL, the ""manananggal"" part, not so much"
3393,14,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Also, the production design"
3393,15,kuyaed,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Set served

3425,3,dumbgeek,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,i just wish it was fleshed out better especially the lore of the cult and the lore of the monsters

3426,13,jjmosca,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,There were a lot of useless and predictable jumpscares
3426,14,jjmosca,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It was marketed as a horror film but it really wasn't as scary as I thought it would be
3426,15,jjmosca,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Overall, a good attempt but there were too many ideas (serial killing, folklore, ghosts, time travel) that fell all over the place"

3428,1,ccsediaren,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"There’s a bit too much to unpack with Mallari, serving too many elements that it takes away from the main narrative, and in turn removes from the scare factor aside from mostly meaningless jumpscares"
3428,2,ccsediaren,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"While we barely even learn of the true origins of the titular character, it’s the production value that really makes the film great, from the visuals, prod design, scoring, and what is probably Piolo Pascual in his best role(s) yet"
3428,3,ccsediaren,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Despite its setbacks (and unnecessary homophobia/transphobia), Mallari’s production remains to be an impressive standard Filipino cinema should aspire to continue"
3429,1,mrsummerpurns,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Not much is known about priest Juan Severino Mallari, said to be the Philippines' first and only serial killer, but that was all it took to create a feature film for the Metro Manila Film Festival"
3429,2,mrsummerpurns,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"""Mallari"" (2023) won four awards at this year's Gabi ng Parangal — 3rd Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for JC Santos, Best Musical Score, and Best Visual Effects — and of those four it is the latter that appears unconvincing"
3429,3,mrsummerpurns,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"No doubt that win is attributed to scenes in the latter part of the film as the so-called mystery unravels, but these effects come off as cheesy like the initial jumpscares that build the film"
3429,4,mrsummerpurns,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The score by Von De Guzman can be forceful and insistent at times, but it gradually allows the film's horror structure to take charge"
3429,5,mrsummerpurns,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"However Santos' win is fully well-deserved, an extreme compliment as most of his scenes are with the more seasoned Piolo Pascual and yet he manages to give his character a believable descent"
3429,6,mrsummerpurns,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,That is not to be hard on Pascual though as he is given the task of juggling three different characters; his charm just happens to be too strong for this foray into horror
3429,7,mrsummerpurns,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"There is one scene though where Pascual's dramatic chops shine so bright, and it is during a silent reckoning with his actions as he dances with Gloria Diaz's Facunda, she too committed to the cause of her character"
3429,8,mrsummerpurns,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Mallari's story is undoubtedly an intriguing one to tackle, however Enrico Santos' screenplay doesn't do enough to fully utilize that premise and the plotline he decides on"

3430,2,japacastro,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Technically, this is a great looking film"
3430,3,japacastro,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The cinematography (my fave part of the movie are the transitions
3430,4,japacastro,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"), the styling, the sets, the grading, the SFX, visually the movie really is on point"
3430,5,japacastro,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"However, the movie literally tried to do too much with so many different horror elements coming up that everything felt half baked"
3430,6,japacastro,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,A slasher with a priest turning evil
3430,8,japacastro,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Three different characters from three different time periods and how they are connected
3430,10,japacastro,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"But when all the supernatural stuff came in, the movie went so overboard with the story that it went nowhere"
3430,11,japacastro,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,But if you wanna watch Piolo Pascual being hot af x3

3432,1,dennisperez,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Instead of an interesting exploration of the Philippines' only priest-turned-serial killer, MALLARI devolves into a convolution of time travel, astral projection, and local folklore"
3432,2,dennisperez,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It misses to touch on the dark psyche of what could have been a good subject in film
3432,3,dennisperez,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The use of horror and jump scares get in the way of the narrative; pulling the audience farther from what could have been a real terror: that of serial killer in an institution Filipinos revere
3433,1,awriirey,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,ok but jc santos as a killer
3434,1,muttsunone,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,A unique story that is a breath of fresh air for us pinoy horror fans
3434,2,muttsunone,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I also like how the film uses scoring to amplify its horror scenes— much like a lot of slasher films in the 80s
3434,3,muttsunone,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I would like to see more about how Mallari did the killings
3434,4,muttsunone,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Also, it can be too much since there are a lot of backstories but nevertheless, I enjoyed the juxtaposition of local folklore and sci-fi"
3434,5,muttsunone,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,This makes it more enjoyable to watch compared to its competitors this year
3435,1,sams3pi0l_,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,the plot was so predictable
3435,2,sams3pi0l_,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,i thought the premise had so many potential to become more historical but the plot became a let down
3435,3,sams3pi0l_,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,the lines were too cheesy and the details were in-your-face
3435,4,sams3pi0l_,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"the CGI was okay, borderline bad"
3435,5,sams3pi0l_,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,there's this frame that piolo's face overlapped with the CGI

3458,10,ishidotgeee,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"perfect color grading that matches the theme, not like those very muted filters they put on films"
3458,12,ishidotgeee,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"honestly, wasn't very amazed with it"
3458,13,ishidotgeee,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"it's only my opinion, and i love judging other people's acting performance as if i'm a professional critic"

3458,15,ishidotgeee,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"but then again, it's piolo's first horror movie, so there is still room for improvement if he wanted to continue this path (i would honestly support him 'cause he's such a beaut on screen)"

3458,23,ishidotgeee,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,was it scary
3458,24,ishidotgeee,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"wouldn't say so, coming from someone who doesn't get scared easily (i do, but only for movies that has exorcism involved in it lol, i always feel like i'm gonna be possessed too)"
3458,25,ishidotgeee,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"the amount of unnecessary jumpscare is sending me off, there's that one scene that felt like my soul left me, other than that, i ended up predicting what's gonna come next (cause i like doing that, to minimize the jumpscare effect lol)"
3458,26,ishidotgeee,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"anyway, this is still worth watching"
3458,27,ishidotgeee,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"i hope this movie will open up for more international collaboration (imagine my surprise when i saw "" warner bros' "" on the opening scene)"

3463,3,lemongaab,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The themes are certainly there: generational trauma represented by haunted houses, reflections of the past present and future, and a mangled commentary on class politics"
3463,4,lemongaab,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This was admittedly poorly paced, like a run-on sentence"
3463,5,lemongaab,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I wish prestige TV was a thing locally because this would have been better fleshed out in a 7-9 episode miniseries, a la The Terror or 1899"
3463,6,lemongaab,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The poor pacing resulted in what should have been an interesting premise and strong themes turned to a hodgepodge of ideas
3463,7,lemongaab,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Gorgeously produced and well acted, but with way too much fat to trim off"
3463,8,lemongaab,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"But like I said in my Smaller and Smaller Circles review, if this paves the way for more serial killer themed local media, let's get at it"

3496,2,cinephileckurt,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It's a slasher, also a sci-fi because of the time travel aspect and also a period piece"
3496,3,cinephileckurt,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It's a fictionalized story about Severino Mallari, a parish priest in Pampanga who is the first Filipino serial killer"

3496,9,cinephileckurt,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Piolo Pascual really did served, one of his best performances, I like it when he plays characters outside his comfort zone"
3496,10,cinephileckurt,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Also JC Santos is pretty good here, he really deserves that best supporting actor award"
3496,11,cinephileckurt,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"First time ko rin na mapanood si Janella Salvador sa big screen, finally she's in a horror movie that doesn't suck"
3496,12,cinephileckurt,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The film does fall into the usual horror cliches unfortunately
3496,13,cinephileckurt,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"First, the jumpscares, there are so many jumpscares here that are just so unnecessary"
3496,14,cinephileckurt,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Ghosts appearing left and right accompanied by a loud sound, without any purpose or significance with the story and most of the time, they are just so predictable"

3496,17,cinephileckurt,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It does overexplain a lot to the audiences
3496,18,cinephileckurt,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"A noticed a lot of exposition scenes, this film is not for children, please let the audience think and piece together the mystery themselves or just show don't tell"
3496,19,cinephileckurt,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Mallari is an enjoyable horror film with a pretty unique concept, despite doing too much, there are many things here that you will appreciate and as a horror fan, this MMFF is a great start to finally make original and good pinoy horror films"

3501,2,polaris21,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Adding some sci-fi elements (although not new concepts) and modern day language (that sparked laughter at times) also proved to work in favor of this film, in its attempt to differentiate itself from other period horror films in the PH"

3507,2,mundingsalao,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"But as the movie progressed, it grew on me and eventually captured my full insatiable attention"
3507,3,mundingsalao,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The story pretty much revels in its intruiging mystery
3507,4,mundingsalao,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It's bold and deliciously insidious
3507,5,mundingsalao,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Its wicked irreverence reminds me of films like The Omen and Rosemary's Baby
3507,6,mundingsalao,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Piolo taking on the three roles reminds us of how talented he is as an actor and is pretty much capable of stretching his range
3507,7,mundingsalao,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The music is powerful and tickles the horror fan in me with how much it effectively marinated the movie

3509,1,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Short Review: Ang Alamat ng DinuguanI like it but not wholly - I think the two major plot concept of the film didn’t gel well for me
3509,2,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Actually, more of they can go separately as I wished this was more of a psychological thriller than a fictional thriller"
3509,3,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Some thoughts:- Cast was on the spot
3509,4,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Everyone was really good - even the side characters
3509,5,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,And they felt more fleshed out than I expected
3509,6,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,- Plot was good … till it wasn’t
3509,7,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But there were really good direction here but somewhere somehow it became off
3509,8,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I think when it was started to do expositions
3509,9,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,- There were too on the nose lines and on the nose scenes
3509,10,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The blanket realization irked me the most as it was obvious but the lead had to have a line for it
3509,11,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,- Production overall was well made - but I don’t know why but PH media (regardless whether high budget or low) felt cramped/limited
3509,12,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It’s like the invisible wall in video games that makes it feel small
3509,13,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"With that said, this had potential and I thoroughly enjoyed it"
3509,14,yupeh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,It will probably be one of my fave MMFF movies this 2023
3510,1,saetori,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,I dunno if we watched the same movie based on you guys' rating but this was the biggest bullshit i've ever seen

3512,1,imata,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,it was good but the manananggal scene happened
3513,1,amarilyo,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"watching horror movies with a big audience just never fails to be really fun, which kind of saved the film for me"
3513,2,amarilyo,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,the score was just immersing and was almost another character in itself
3513,3,amarilyo,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"the cinematography was also stunning, historical dramas have this cheat code of being able to use so much warm light from candles and windows that makes any scene beautiful (i also just personally adore warm lighting)"
3513,4,amarilyo,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,however its shortcomings really come from the script
3514,1,chaosbringer,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,In my fleabag era
3515,1,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,lucas is queer coded
3515,2,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,a fellow moviegoer pointed this out and i agree
3515,3,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,don't tell me he didn't at least like jonathan

3515,5,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,years and years of friendship and he's always there for him
3515,6,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"went with jonathan to pampanga in a heartbeat, and forgave him just as quick as well"
3515,7,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,hated gays but that's the internalized homophobia talking (probably went to a seminary to pray the gay away)
3515,8,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"and when the opportunity struck, wanted to kill his gf"
3515,9,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,and the betrayal scene
3515,10,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"(also: jc santos, you are sent from the heavens above) yeah, it's not platonic for lucas"
3515,11,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,wanting to continue his bloodline's vow is a less compelling motivation
3515,13,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,just because
3515,14,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,not really explained
3515,15,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,but it's giving master x slave
3515,16,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,him being gay is a much more compelling reason
3515,17,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"like dude admit it, you're in love with him and want to be with him"
3515,18,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,but that's just a theory
3515,19,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,a film theory
3515,21,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,—real review:i hated how jonathan never learned
3515,22,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,he had the choice to break generational curse for both families but didn't
3515,23,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,he chose pussy over allat (same)i wish they simplified the story a bit more because it gets a bit busy
3515,24,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,and i agree with some reviewers this would've been better as a crime/thriller and you can even put supernatural in the mix but not horror (i can say the same for some horror films in the ph)but great acting from piolo and jc
3515,25,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,expected performance from janella
3515,26,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,and gloria diaz
3515,27,natjmd,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,she was not acting

3516,1,xynema,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,liked it lots
3516,2,xynema,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,intrigued from the plot / trailer alone
3516,3,xynema,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,the way they explored fr
3516,4,xynema,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"mallari's story was really interesting, something i've never really seen before; the time-travelling aspects introduced a sci-fi twist to the collonial piece that made it more  for me"
3516,5,xynema,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"questionable sfx and prosthetics aside, the demonic / cult-ish plotline entwined with the religious main character really did it for me"
3516,6,xynema,2023-12-26 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,the ending was unsatisfactory from an audience standpoint as in nairita ako kay jonathan but i love u janella salvador u're so girlboss demonyita slayyy (literally) she ate (literally)
3517,1,andie_mov,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,it gets to a certain point where everything in this felt like a plot twist cause i walked into this blind so what the heyll

3519,1,chuboobster,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Carried in large part by the breathtaking performances of Piolo Pascual and JC Santos (ABSOLUTELY ATE) and solid world building but it was pretty thematically incoherent
3519,2,chuboobster,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Sci fi - occult - horror elements were thrown around without logic
3519,3,chuboobster,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Characters were thinly written – I wasn't sold on why they, especially present-day Piolo, were doing whatever the hell they were doing"

3521,7,junejuly1,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"storyline wise, so ayun na nga medyo na-confuse rin ako slight kasi may fly high manananggal beh"
3521,8,junejuly1,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"like, ano na ba ‘toh"
3521,10,junejuly1,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"may pass the balut pa beh, so sobrang confusing talaga"
3521,11,junejuly1,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"stupid rin kasi ako, i thought real life story ‘toh ni fr"
3521,12,junejuly1,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"mallari and shit, u know kinda like a docu-film ba"
3521,13,junejuly1,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,so yung subjects such as the manananggal and yung sisiw confuses me a lot
3521,14,junejuly1,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"cgi wise, singit ko lang beh"
3521,15,junejuly1,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"natawa ako beh  especially yung cgi sa mulha ni gloria diaz, may improvements pa talaga huhu"
3521,16,junejuly1,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"but overall tho, i’m officially a johnrey mallari stan"
3521,17,junejuly1,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"i bow down to the king jokes aside, there’s a lot that needs improvement but THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE A BOMB"

3522,1,eliezerpen,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,they made piolo wear cassock in a slasher movie and expect me to not like it

3524,2,babaylans,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"another ""everything everywhere all at once"" film but idgaf because i enjoy horror, thriller, crime, folklore, religion, period and family drama"
3524,3,babaylans,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"i love the many things they tried to do, and i think it worked"
3524,4,babaylans,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"i just wish it was more of a ""show"" than ""tell"" film"
3524,5,babaylans,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,dialogues also tend to state the already obvious
3524,6,babaylans,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"example: when john rey found out that he brought back jonathan's towel, he voiced it out as if the audience couldn't see towel in his hand"
3524,7,babaylans,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,characters KEEP speaking out their thought process
3524,8,babaylans,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"it threw me off because (1) real people don't do that, (2) it takes away the mystery, (3) EVERY actor are talented enough, i am sure they can deliver the thoughts and emotions of their characters through their body language and facial expressions alone"
3524,9,babaylans,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"mallari is a smart film (at least smarter than many recent filo films), but it sees its audience as stupid or ppl who needs to be spoonfed"
3524,10,babaylans,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,THIS IS A PROOF THAT WE NEED MORE PHILIPPINE FOLK HORROR
3524,11,babaylans,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"we don't need to borrow from other countries' horror genre, no need for filipino versions of annabelle, saw, and carrie"
3524,12,babaylans,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,our folklore is vast and more interesting
3525,1,trainwrecktim,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Too much going on and too ambitious for its own good
3525,2,trainwrecktim,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Wish it stuck to its best bits, the 1800s, all the way through and really tightened that script"
3525,3,trainwrecktim,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,But the score was fabulous
3526,1,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Is it justifiable when a human kills others in the name of justice
3526,2,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,To eliminate the evil in this world

3526,4,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Are we able to escape the fate that has been sealed long before our parents existence
3526,5,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Is love really the biggest curse of it all
3526,6,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,These are all the questions that came to mind as I was watching Mallari
3526,7,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Before I continue, I just wanted to point out that they executed the connection between the 3 generations of Severinos seamlessly"
3526,8,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It was really impressive how they wove the stories of the different generations of Mallari into the final fate of the present one
3526,9,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,He who determines whether a person is the sum of all his decisions or his mistakes
3526,10,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,More than anything I adore films that evokes questions out of me
3526,11,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,There's just this juvenile wonder that comes after witnessing a story unfold in front of you
3526,12,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Something about it makes my morale skyrocket
3526,13,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"That, for me, is one of the factors I consider when writing about films I watch"
3526,14,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"In conclusion, I ask of you (to whoever may be reading this, anyone who doesn't have a short attention span like I do), to watch this film"
3526,15,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It has a very intriguing plot, features great performances from the leads, tells the story fate or trauma being hereditary, and the gift and curse of love to humans"
3526,16,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Also what the actual fuck
3526,17,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Piolo is jaw-droppingly gorgeous AND talented
3526,18,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"I knew he was all that, but goddamn did this punch me in the face just how he is that"
3526,19,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,bitch 100%
3526,20,7lioh,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,JC Santos also absolutely devoured that role of being the blind worshipper and he rightfully won Best Supporting Actor ikdr
3527,1,jmsawitfirst,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,they just missed the opportunity to make it a psychological thriller masterpiece
3527,2,jmsawitfirst,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"this movie has the best storytelling of multi-verse/time travelling, i have ever seen in a filipino movie"
3527,3,jmsawitfirst,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,the biggest downside for me is the forced demonic possession and aswang plot which was very unnecessary to the story
3527,4,jmsawitfirst,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,this could have been one of the best filipino horror movie
3528,1,niquelya,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It’s been a long time since I watched a Filipino horror movie that didn’t make me cringe so much
3528,2,niquelya,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This reminded me of Insidious 1 and 2 and though there were parts I found dragging, it is still enjoyable"
3528,3,niquelya,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I wish they gave the priest a major part in the actual storyline
3528,4,niquelya,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I also found Janella’s character weak
3528,5,niquelya,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,They should have just gone with the usual aswang instead of a manananggal with poor cgi
3528,6,niquelya,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Overall this wasn’t so bad compared to the recent SR&R
3529,1,maxbautista,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,araw-araw bang pula buwan sa pampanga
3530,1,miku0110,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The storyline is too predictable
3530,2,miku0110,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,They should have stuck with the suspenseful psycho killer plot and omitted the CGI elements like Manananggal and Werewolf
3530,3,miku0110,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The explanations are overly obvious; it would have been better to let the audience creatively piece them together
3530,4,miku0110,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"However, there are some genuinely impressive shots"
3531,1,clodii,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Solid 7/10Maganda naman yung premise nya and ang exciting nya talaga nung una
3531,2,clodii,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Nung tungkol sa mga multo mutlo pa sya but i dont know, parang na turn off ako, kumbaga, dun sa part na dahil pala sa mga servants yun ni severino na demon worshipers kaya may mga murders kemerut"
3531,3,clodii,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Tapos yung part also na cgi LIKE ANG UNEXPECTED TALAGA NA NAGING MANANAGGAL YUNG DONYA HAHAJAHA TAPOS WEREWOLF/TIKBALANG SI JOHNREY
3531,4,clodii,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Pero yunn sarap ni papa P

3533,1,wonuspopcorn,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,difficult to focus on; the idea was rich but poorly executed
3534,1,metromanella,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"My rating is related to the horror aspect, which was what it tried to achieve"
3534,2,metromanella,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I am a horror/thriller sucker so I have really high expectations when it comes to this genre
3534,3,metromanella,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This film is ambitious and derivative to its core, with everything going all at the same time BUT I think it was able to seamlessly tie all timelines together and Piolo Pascual's acting to each persona is just god-tier"
3534,4,metromanella,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"With regards to the horror side, the CGI is just so bad, that 1 scene completely threw the audience off"
3534,5,metromanella,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Jumpscares are there but it's a blend of sci-fi, folklore and history, which was a bit convoluted"
3534,6,metromanella,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Now I understand why JC Santos won Best Supporting Actor; he's beyond scary, he was frightening to watch"
3534,7,metromanella,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,1 question I just had was why Piolo did not win Best Actor with his 3 role portrayals (4 plus the alter-ego)
3534,8,metromanella,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,This has potential

3536,2,laya_kathleen,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Watched it at SM Sto
3536,3,laya_kathleen,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Tomas and I loved the crowd I watched with
3536,4,laya_kathleen,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Aliw sa intense habulan scene as everyone was holding their breaths and screaming
3536,5,laya_kathleen,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It was a good experience
3536,6,laya_kathleen,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I thought it would be a really scary horror story but it wasn't
3536,7,laya_kathleen,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It was also funny at some points, like for example, the priest na sobrang gen z HAHAHAHA…"
3537,1,orangelilies,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,would’ve been better if it remained a true crime/mystery/thriller film (or maybe i’m just not a big fan of horror movies)
3537,2,orangelilies,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"but really interesting plot, loved seeing how everything came together in the end"

3538,3,malikhain,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Embodying three distinct characters is no small feat
3538,4,malikhain,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, he struggles to convincingly portray the nuanced differences among these characters, leaving one yearning for an acting style akin to James McAvoy in ""Split"
3538,5,malikhain,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"""On the contrary, JC Santos delivers an outstanding performance, effortlessly stealing the spotlight from Piolo"
3538,6,malikhain,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"But despite this, the film still struggles to evoke spine-chilling moments"
3538,7,malikhain,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It relies heavily on jump scares that, unfortunately, don't significantly impact the overall storyline"
3538,8,malikhain,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Also, the narrative style of withholding key information, strategically aiming for impactful revelations towards the end, serves as one of its major pitfalls"
3538,9,malikhain,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"While effective in building suspense, this approach renders characters—especially Jonathan—somewhat devoid of logical thinking, an odd characteristic given his role as a doctor"
3538,10,malikhain,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Despite these shortcomings, the film remains a worthwhile watch for those seeking a fusion of scares and suspense"

3589,1,rafael199,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,3 stars for that unnecessary specific scene
3590,1,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Delving into three intertwining timelines and employing a time-traveling twist, ""Mallari"" presents an ambitious scope"
3590,2,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"While the writers were able to tame this beast with a narrative that manages to engage and leaving its audiences intrigued, the overreliance on jump scares and the occult fails to tie up effectively with the overall storyline"
3590,3,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This heavy-handed (and unnecessary) approach to horror detracts from what could have been a refined, narrative-driven film instead"
3590,5,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Jonathan Mallari de Dios (Piolo Pascual) embarks on a journey to his ancestral home in Magalang, Pampanga, in search of a hidden chamber from his childhood - a chamber purportedly holding a cure for his fiancée's (Janella Salvador) severe illness"
3590,6,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Upon arrival, we're introduced to his ancestors: Fr"
3590,7,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Juan Severino Mallari (Piolo Pascual), the notorious 19th-century Filipino serial killer, and Johnrey Mallari (Piolo Pascual), a chronicler of World War II in the Philippines for the Americans"
3590,8,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"As eerie occurrences unfold within the house, it becomes evident that his quest may bring more harm than good to his loved ones"
3590,9,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"In the realm of fantastical and supernatural cinema like ""Mallari,"" stringent logic isn’t always to be expected"
3590,10,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,There's always a give and take involved as we're delving into imaginary stuff
3590,11,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Yet, the fundamental plot struggles to find coherence"
3590,12,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Elements often feel forced, serving the narrative agenda without solid grounding"
3590,13,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The biggest question for us is why is there a need to continue the legacy of murders across time
3590,14,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,While the rationale is clear in the 1800s in Fr
3590,15,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Mallari's time, subsequent timelines lack this clarity and cohesion"
3590,16,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The handling of time travel also raises eyebrow-raising issues, from small stuff such as our protagonists modern-day attire back in time without issue to seamless communication across eras to bigger issues such as the reasons how the Mallaris are able to go selectively go back in time"
3590,17,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, the film's glaring misstep lies in its gratuitous use of unnecessary horror and jump scares"
3590,18,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The continuous barrage of ghostly appearances lacks purpose, serving more to frustrate than thrill"
3590,19,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It's apparent why they put this excessive amount in ""Mallari"" and ironically it backfires by producing the opposite effect"
3590,20,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Despite these drawbacks, ""Mallari"" maintains a level of entertainment"
3590,21,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It's fundamentally flawed but manages to strike occasional emotional chords, buoyed by its visually captivating cinematography and commendable performances by Piolo Pascual and JC Santos in particular"
3590,22,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Surprisingly, a degree of attachment develops with the main characters, though the film could have greatly benefited from more refinement and streamlining"
3590,23,reeladvicenet,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"""Mallari"" assumes forced scares are necessary for a fulfilling experience, missing the mark on delivering a cleaner and better narrative in the process"

3733,7,aphrod,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This film could have scrapped some of those, since the way most scenes are shot already got the atmosphere to give you the creeps"
3733,8,aphrod,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The abundance of jump scares comes off like the film's underestimating the audience's perception of fear, and that aspect would have made me give this 2"

3733,10,aphrod,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"But the story it's trying to tell surely won me over, hence the 3 stars"
3733,11,aphrod,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Though the social commentary in the film is weaker and there are lapses in the fiction part of the narrative, it succeeds to tell how love is the main predictor for the curse that plagues the Mallari bloodline"
3733,12,aphrod,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It also successfully tells how in some cases, history is truly repeated if ignored"
3733,13,aphrod,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I see why Piolo Pascual was also others' bet for Best Actor, his acting really made the 3 main characters shine in their own ways (and his role as Fr"

3733,16,aphrod,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Too bad that for me, his storyline doesn't seem as fleshed out as Severino's or Jonathan's, as he is the ""tragic hero"" of the movie"
3733,17,aphrod,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"In spite of the film's blatant flaws, it's still a movie that deserves all the hype and the awards they've received from the Gabi Ng Parangal"

3734,3,satuwina,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Well, for me, it brought me back to the old horror films filled with the typical jumpscares thag you'll still get surprised but it also gives you this suspense feeling like sitting at the edge of your chair wondering what could be the next thing that will happen in the movie"
3734,4,satuwina,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The transitions between the three eras were smooth that it was a little bit confusing at first glance but I loved how it incorporates the three timelines on a single important event of the whole story and presents you each on how they are intersected at that moment
3734,5,satuwina,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,It was definitely good on how they are able to play around the plot and not spill the whole thing on one go
3734,6,satuwina,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I loved that portion and Piolo Pascual's acting is the best I've seen and maybe this is his best movie on his entire career
3734,7,satuwina,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"From the visual, to the acting, to the pronounciations that make the timelines distinct on their own helps very well on distinguishing the three different timelines of Severino, Johnrey and Jonathan"
3734,8,satuwina,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I would also love to add some praise for JC Santos

3734,11,satuwina,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"1) The Manananggal Scene (did not resonated as much or did not do anything for the plot, I guess"
3734,12,satuwina,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,And a little too corny for the well produced film)2) The Ending (I am looking for more information on how things end up like that
3734,13,satuwina,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Like from JC's character to Janella's ""memory"" of who she is now after what Piolo did)But despite these things, I found Mallari to be a good film and despite not being a fan of horror films, this is one of those horror films at the top my list (as it was a good horro movie and because I can still sleep st night after watching this)"

3739,3,csndr,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Hence, when I found out this had a horror element to it, I was confused"

3804,11,terriblejasf,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,", time traveling) could have been better with a less cheesy dialogue"

3804,13,terriblejasf,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Piolo's acting was the weakest despite portraying the MAIN character; he was outshined by the supporting actors
3804,14,terriblejasf,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,There were multiple layers to the story that influenced the characters' complexity
3804,15,terriblejasf,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Wikipedia would tell us that Fr

3804,17,terriblejasf,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,But the movie went all out: There was MORE to show within 2 hours
3804,18,terriblejasf,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I loved the ending

3810,1,migocean_,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,BECAUSE OF THAT ONE F SCENE
3811,1,delleesther,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,3 different Piolos differentiated by hair
3812,1,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"+:- plot-wise, it's def a richer, more nuanced, and more thought-out narrative compared to most PH horror na super predictable na ng plot twists + generic elements"
3812,2,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,i like what it tried to do with 3 diff time periods though ofc the time traveling/astral projecting was a stretch and maybe a tad too ambitious writing-wise
3812,3,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,still a good effort tho- characters: all played well
3812,4,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,i liked the juxtaposition between severino - a serial killer who didn't enjoy it and didn't actually WANT to be it - and lucas who DID enjoy being a copycat killer and WANTED to do it
3812,5,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,jc santos deserved his best supporting actor award
3812,6,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,- technical elements: production design goes so hard esp knowing they built some of the key parts of the setting
3812,7,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"the score was also particularly good tho maybe im just biased for church/choral elements-:- im not a big fan of origin stories of ""female monsters"" when the presented origin is so male-centric"
3812,8,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"sure, in this case it was women who set upon the curse that started the monster - but why"
3812,9,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,just for someone else to do their bidding
3812,10,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,i wish they showed more of the alarcons and why they did what they did
3812,11,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"if the motivation is supposed to be wrath at the injustice done against ppl like them, then i wish they leaned into that more, kulang lang ng detail pa for that- mallari stopped being scary the moment it was revealed that his mom saw smth nieves led her to watch"
3812,12,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"dun palang i already knew severino would only be forced to kill, not that he wanted to himself"
3812,13,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,im not a fan of this either lol he'd be a much more sinister character if HE was the fanatic and saw himself as san bartolome on his own accord BUT i know that's not the point of the story so sige na nga- why naman di na lang niya niligtas si agnes eh doktor din naman si jonathan
3812,14,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"tapos pampanga yan in present time beh dami dami nang ospital tas may kotse rin naman si agnes mabilis kayo makakarating dun medyo nkklk- AND SPEAKING OF THE HOSPITAL: in the first scene na pinakitang nasa hospital bed si agnes, ang sabi ng nurse ""end stage na po siya"" so akala ko naman cancer or some life-threatening disease"
3812,15,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,ngayon pala stab wound amp pano yon end stage nakapagsalita pa nga and all ewan ko ba- and the ending
3812,16,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"i get it they needed a shot of jonathan like that, but i wish it was even more tragic"
3812,17,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,filipino writing is sometimes so hooked on expositional writing but sometimes that gets too annoying to listen to and to act out
3812,18,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,i wish they didn't show agnes eating the chick
3812,19,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"ok na sana that they showed jonathan smiling while holding up johnrey's head and the chick is coming out of its mouth - and then cut na agad to the mallari house and the secret room, where agnes is chained and jonathan is ""lovingly"" feeding her entrails while she looks like she'd rather be dead after killing him IDK"
3812,20,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"personally didnt feel like all that dialogue was necessary in the end but ok gets pa rin namanoverall tho, i hope this film encourages more horror filmmakers to take on compelling stories"
3812,21,anaiela,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,our culture is SOOO rich for this literally andaming pwedeng material for horror and im so glad to see i can look forward to more daring horror films like this now in the PH

3815,2,anito,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Piolo was great the only thing I wasn't convinced by is his demon character in the church scene

3815,4,anito,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Maybe even his Fr
3815,5,anito,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Severino was the best
3815,6,anito,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I don't think the jumpscares were unnecessary
3815,7,anito,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Us pinoys would eat the up anyway
3815,8,anito,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"But its use of time travel or astral projection as the film says is kinda weak I think, I wished it was more utilized to move the narrative better but a 2 hr cut wouldn't really suffice so I guess it's good as it is"
3815,9,anito,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,+ it really tries to fit in a lot of genres so I think that's a plus for me on that part

3846,1,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Mallari is a horror-thriller film based on the Philippines' first recorded serial killer hailing from Pampanga
3846,2,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"With this in mind, the film attempts to take us on a wild ride of discovery, boldly mixing genres that, while commendable, more often than not gets derailed into different directions"
3846,3,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"MAZES AND DAZESFirstly, it's admirable how the story attempts to give Filipino audiences something different"
3846,4,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It marries the familiar Philippine folklore horror elements with sci-fi and mystery thriller with dashes of history, comedy, and even family drama"
3846,5,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The story unfolds with a non-linear structure, too, which makes it interesting"
3846,6,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The issues lay with this very idea that it wanted to do so much with so little time
3846,7,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The first half of the film lays all of the mystery, while the second half picks up the pace and fully turns into a horror story"
3846,8,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Jamming too many elements somehow took away from what could have been great points in the story if only they leaned more into them and chose: did it want to be more of a historical horror or a mystery thriller slasher cult modern classic
3846,9,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,BRIGHT AND DULL SPOTSPiolo Pascual playing multiple roles across generations would've been a great feat for an actor of his caliber
3846,10,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"But somehow, something was missing in his portrayal that left me wanting more"
3846,11,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"His characters felt like they were the same people, save for two distinct moments in the chapel and in the hospital towards the end"
3846,12,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Undeniable standouts were JC Santos and Gloria Diaz
3846,13,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,They were spectacular and generous in their supporting roles and stole scenes whenever they came up beside Pascual
3846,14,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,They were delightful to watch
3846,15,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"OVERALLDespite its major flaws, I like how everything was wrapped up"
3846,16,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"All of the mysteries and questions set up were resolved and given their end, no loose ends (which could've easily been the case given its ambition and scope)"
3846,17,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Mallari is an example of what happens when you allow filmmakers to be adventurous and bold in their ideas
3846,18,atablefortwo,2023-12-31 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It can lead to a bumpy and crazy, yet fun and adventurous ride"
3847,1,henlobea,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,a pretty solid movie
3847,2,henlobea,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,definitely not perfect but has the potential to kickstart a new age for filipino horror movies
3848,1,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,watching this in the cinemas was definitely a fun experience especially when the audience (mostly strangers) also insert funny commentaries here and there that you can’t help but laugh at
3848,2,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,the people behind our backs were especially funny i couldn’t help but to acknowledge how that elevated my experience
3848,3,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,as for the movie itself…
3848,4,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"first, i would like to point out how much i loooooove the musical scoring"
3848,5,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,i have no complaints about that
3848,6,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,i also liked the acting especially jc santos like woah okay best supporting actor indeed
3848,7,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,and also liked the fact that janella salvador is here like woah everyone’s eye candy is piolo pascual but mine is janella so there’s room for everybody
3848,8,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"that said, what i didn’t like about the movie is how they didn’t explore much about the first filipino serial killer aspect more"
3848,9,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"i went in expecting that they would explore the story of the murders itself, the aftermath, the consequences, and how the priest was discovered as the murderer but i guess that’s on me for expecting something like that, something nbc hannibal-like"
3848,10,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"honestly, i just really wished they focused more on the murders since it is a mystery/thriller aspect in itself but i guess mallari wasn’t going for that"
3848,11,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"like hello, the first documented serial killer of the philippines was a catholic priest and that in itself is intriguing as a predominantly catholic country"
3848,12,freshlinen,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"anyway, i did like the time traveling aspect to explore the narrative but at the same time i feel like it wasn’t utilized well enough to really wrap up the story… but props to piolo pascual for pulling off the roles well"
3849,1,ohohleoph,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Grabe yung Mallari
3849,2,ohohleoph,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Deserve yung nominations at lahat ng awards nung Gabi ng Parangal
3849,3,ohohleoph,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Grabe yung utak ni Enrico Santos at Derrick Cabrido for creating such masterpiece
3849,4,ohohleoph,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is Piolo versus Piolo versus Piolo

3849,6,ohohleoph,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Talagang lumaban si JC Santos literally and figuratively at pasabog naman po si Gloria Diaz
3849,7,ohohleoph,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Kung ako magdedecide, bibigyan ko na lang sila ng tig-iisang BALUT para tumigil silang lahat"

3850,3,remremiah,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Though a handful of ridiculous jumpscares, and horrible cgi was painful enough to watch"
3850,4,remremiah,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The cringe, dramatic lines, and the predictable plot twists was forgivable"
3850,5,remremiah,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,And the ending was a piece of cake
3850,6,remremiah,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It was delicious and satisfying
3850,7,remremiah,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"There was a part where a tape recording of Johnrey's wife was giving her own confession, it was full of shit but I'll let it slide"
3850,8,remremiah,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Overall, for a filipino horror film, this probably has the most beautiful shots of aesthetic horror elements, (does not include the jumpscares), great production (does not include the cgi) and cinematic experience"
3851,1,teppyyy,2024-01-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,it was a good fun watch and piolo was the most scrumptious as johnrey dze 1948 docu filmmaker liiikeeeee

3862,3,californiamacky,2024-01-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is brilliant filmmaking
3862,4,californiamacky,2024-01-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Piolo serving us an acting masterclass
3862,5,californiamacky,2024-01-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Much of the criticism about MALLARI is the abundance of jump scares, and I agree that they are quite tiring after a certain time"
3862,6,californiamacky,2024-01-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,MALLARI works best during its moments of quiet dread: two scenes in particular (without giving much away) are my favorite

3863,3,shoggre,2024-01-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,i do love the overall concept
3863,4,shoggre,2024-01-03 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,its very unique and i do appreciate the storytelling although i wish it wasnt reliant on jumpscares for the fear factor

3867,2,rynethewatcher,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,) combined with great acting made me hopeful that this would turn into an actual top tier Filipino movie
3867,3,rynethewatcher,2023-12-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"But the ineffective jumpscares, bad CGI at times, and the questionable ending (which demanded more scenes between Piolo and Janella to solidly establish their relationship) prevented what I hoped for from happening"

4067,4,idkaboutfilms,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,i read that most local tv shows scrimp on their sfx editors to allocate their funds to other needs or are generally on a tight budget but seriously hanggang dito ba naman
4067,5,idkaboutfilms,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,huhu sayang kasi its these little repetitive things that hinder the quality

4085,1,ohemjayps,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,A decent one with intriguing concepts and elements that aren't prevalent in other horror-thriller movies
4085,2,ohemjayps,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Some jump scares shouldn't be included, imo"
4085,3,ohemjayps,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The creepy scoring is more than enough to fit the screenplay; the pacing is a bit messy and could be improved, but the last stretch swiftly sums up how good the plot line is"
4085,4,ohemjayps,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Piolo's portrayal definitely showed the differences between the three generations; I have to commend how it was depicted
4085,5,ohemjayps,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,JC Santos' performance was top-notch; no wonder he won as the best supporting actor for this filmfest
4085,6,ohemjayps,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I'm also impressed by how it includes Filipino folklore and mythology, how Christianity has severely influenced us all up until now, and the way they show how religion affects one's overall character"
4086,1,aliahssi,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,My first film for 2024 and I would say I fairly had fun
4086,2,aliahssi,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I think the deciding factor whether one will like this film is the astral projection/time travel direction on the screenplay based on actual history
4086,3,aliahssi,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"I definitely did not expect that going into this film, although eventually I enjoyed the plot as it went on"

4097,2,21p,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,May potential sana kaso medyo magulo yung pagkaka-execute at may mga plot holes

4099,1,mrdj1721,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The film looks good
4099,2,mrdj1721,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Both in terms of production design and cinematography
4099,3,mrdj1721,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The film sounds good, both in terms of sound design and scoring"
4099,4,mrdj1721,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The film also manages to weave together the three narratives of three generations of the Mallari clan very well
4099,5,mrdj1721,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I just wish that the narrative themselves were fleshed out and developed well
4099,6,mrdj1721,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It felt like the film is trying to say too much that it ended up not saying anything at all
4099,7,mrdj1721,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"However, I do think that the film's epilogue is easily its greatest strength"
4099,8,mrdj1721,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Particularly, the hospital scene"
4099,9,mrdj1721,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The way it was shot, the way it was scored, the performances truly hooked me in that moment"
4099,10,mrdj1721,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"I wish there were more moments like that in the film, but what we got were CGI-elongated faces of dead people followed by sudden hitting of notes in an attempt to produce scares out of the audience"

4101,4,astrudiswatchin,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Plus Piolo Pascual as three different leads

4102,2,jimxon,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"bravo to the actors, the production team, and the director of this film"
4102,3,jimxon,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"the story makes sense as well, since the movie's plot thickens considerably when the characters and dialogue are introduced"
4103,1,kxairo,2024-01-06 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Definitely one of the more ambitious Filipino horror films I've seen in a while
4103,2,kxairo,2024-01-06 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"A bunch of cool concepts and I like all the cultural tie ins and nods to Filipino folklore, and history"
4103,3,kxairo,2024-01-06 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Good acting and cinematography but the horror element definitely could've done some work especially with the cheap jump scares
4103,4,kxairo,2024-01-06 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Some vfx shots were a bit ehh but passable
4103,5,kxairo,2024-01-06 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,A lot of gen z lingo and humor felt forced throughout as well and the whole deal with the non binary person in the beginning felt unnecessary and the stereotypes used felt mean spirited and out of taste

4106,1,colxxn,2024-01-06 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"promising start, disappointing end"

4108,1,donskie,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The film's cinematography was amazing
4108,2,donskie,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"For me, it was Piolo and Elise's acting that carried the whole film"
4108,3,donskie,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I like how the director thinks by connecting different generations of Mallari to one another
4108,4,donskie,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The CGI could have been improved and I was literally annoyed with the ending but it later sank in that the ending of the film should not be changed at all
4108,5,donskie,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,That it was the perfect ending
4109,1,henjunle,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,genuinely good plot with a few misses on the unnecessary cgi effects that sprung out of nowhere so saks langggg
4110,1,jom_reviews,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,82/100 - Satisfactory (83-82)Negatives:-The dialogues were too sloppy
4110,2,jom_reviews,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The film has three time frames and it didn't manage to be consistent throughout
4110,3,jom_reviews,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The plot was oversaturated with great ideas with no sufficient developments
4110,4,jom_reviews,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"-With a lot of characters and plotlines to chew under a 2hr runtime, I find the some sequences abnormally fast-paced"

4110,6,jom_reviews,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Positives:-Piolo giving another great performance as expected
4110,7,jom_reviews,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The standout for me was definitely JC; I view him as the Barry Keoghan of PH
4110,8,jom_reviews,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"-The horror elements were definitely effective, the theater audience really elevated the experience"
4110,9,jom_reviews,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"-Although it felt rushed, the film managed to tie together the different plots of the different timeframes properly"
4111,1,panaderyanilinm,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,Some scenes of the movie caught me off guard but the reason why I rate this 4
4111,2,panaderyanilinm,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,5 is because the musical scores instead of the story of the movie XD

4114,4,keiize,2024-01-03 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,the only thing i liked about this movie is the plot which i still consider to be mediocre
4115,1,inclarkselement,2023-12-25 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,good for a thriller film; some scenes are irrelevant though

4116,2,borassi,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,some scenes were unnecessary though
4116,3,borassi,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,jump scares were so-so
4117,1,piaisabel,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,A solid attempt at Filipino magical realism
4117,2,piaisabel,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Do not expect a historical horror film
4117,3,piaisabel,2024-01-05 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The plot may diverge and expand needlessly but the core of the film is strong in its main character and thesis

4244,5,iamdamnation,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"I just wished the movie went on a different direction than this because the fantastical element - including the time travel, agawang sisiw, etc - while interesting, to some extent, felt too absurd and unnecessarily convoluted especially since this was based on a true story"
4244,6,iamdamnation,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The twists were frustratingly predictable and some of the jumpscares felt too heavy handed

4279,3,hellopaolo,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It's overly ambitious with a really thin time travelling plot and heavy handed screenplay that tried to tie all three generations but failed to do so

4292,1,bunnwatch,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,they multiversed a serial killerit could have gone somewhere with the main plot device – something about closed time loops and a haunting of hill house-style theme/take on ghosts – but on god the addition of demons & folklore made it messy
4292,2,bunnwatch,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,the beginning was strong; but does it look like this script took at least 4 revisions
4292,3,bunnwatch,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,cinematography for the most part good or decent and music goes hard and the actors are amazing but the script
4292,6,bunnwatch,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,like there could have been a way to smoothly combine elements but the tropes of pinoy horror strike again and it could have hit (it did a lil bit) but ehhhh not completelyit's a good change to the mmff scene (i hope it influences a shift in horror filmmaking because something was there)
4292,7,bunnwatch,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,but as a standalone horror/thriller film in itself

4314,2,cinephileiggy,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,There was so much happening and too many themes were being introduced

4451,1,paulenicola,2024-01-09 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"MALLARI, MMFF2023: Based on Filipino Catholic priest Juan Severino Mallari (1785–1840), the first documented serial killer from the Philippines; Director Roderick Cabrido and writer Enrico Santos deliver a story that takes the premise of Mallari's serial killing and uses it as backstory to advance the horror elements of the film's three-timeline, three-Piolo Pascual act"
4451,2,paulenicola,2024-01-09 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Personally, I might be in the minority who thinks that, with reports of Mallari showing signs of mental instability around the same time of his killing spree, the film would have worked better as a psychological thriller, sans the folk horror aspect"
4451,3,paulenicola,2024-01-09 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The filmmakers seemingly took advantage of the paucity of verifiable records about the man's life — so much that the liberties they took just screams 'WOW'
4451,4,paulenicola,2024-01-09 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Mallari, in its sheer unapologetic glory, is a very interesting mess"
4451,5,paulenicola,2024-01-09 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"As an alchemy of historical thriller and folk horror, at times it becomes too tiring, that audiences can be forgiven for expecting scares before they even appear onscreen"
4451,6,paulenicola,2024-01-09 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This marriage ultimately combusts in the end, leaving only one of the two as the last genre standing"
4451,7,paulenicola,2024-01-09 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"And for that, flaws and all, I feel Mallari deserves a closer look for its guts to prioritize jump scares to frighten its audiences shitless; even if by doing so, it compromises history — and the last ounces of accuracy remaining — by putting it on the back burner"
4452,1,rhytious,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Horror film na may kuwento at hindi jump-scares lang ang puhunan

4452,10,rhytious,2024-01-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Marami ring plot twist na dapat abangan

4499,5,korthius,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"however, i really wish the movie didn't use jump scares so much to double down on its horror"
4499,6,korthius,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"the atmosphere, sound design, and camerawork were plentiful in creating a suspenseful environment, but because of how many telegraphed jump scares there are, i ended up simply waiting for the surprise rather than immersing in the movie"

4507,2,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,May inaasahan na ako sa Mallari dahil sa mga magagandang salita na nabasa ko
4507,3,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Pero hindi naging sarado para hindi maging sariwa ang pagkilala ko sa pelikula
4507,4,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Mabilis na ipinakilala ang karakter
4507,5,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Hindi sila nagpahaba ng paghihintay bago mo malaman kung tungkol saan ang pelikula

4507,7,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,May mga panahon napabilib ako sa paraan ng editing at pagkuha ng eksena pero hindi ito naging sapat para mailatag ng malinaw ang istorya
4507,8,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,May iilang eksena na hindi nakatulong sa pagkukwento bagkus nag-iwan lamang ng mga katanungan hindi na nabigyan ng kasagutan
4507,9,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Maayos ang ipinakita ni Piolo pero hindi ako tiyak kung ito ay kayang magpanalo sa kanya ng parangal
4507,10,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Pero gusto ko at nararapat siyang bigyan ng pagkilala sa maraming karakter na ginampanan niya
4507,11,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Kung pagbabasehan ang akting na ipinakita, SI JC Santos ang magbubuhat ng bandera sa gabi ng parangal"
4507,12,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Mahusay at nararapat ang ipinakita niya
4507,13,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Medyo naguluhan lang ako sa mga manunulat kung anong kwento ba ang gusto nila para sa mga manunuod
4507,14,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,May mga oras na mapapasigaw ka pero mas maraming oras na mapapahula ka kung ano nga ba tong pinapanuod mo sa sinehan

4507,17,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Oo, isa itong pelikulang magpapatalon sa iyo sa kinauupuan gamit ang biswal at tunog ngunit napasobra ata ito sa lakas kumpara sa mga napanuod natin may ganitong tema"
4507,18,jastinjohnson,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,2/5 ang rating na aking ibibigay

4514,1,sethjt,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It’s ambitious and stylish but got mentally exhausted by the multiple plot twists (and plot holes)

4517,1,againstthetide,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,the poison drips through
4518,1,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,(Note: This review contains spoilers
4518,2,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,)This is certainly one of the most bizarre films I’ve ever seen
4518,3,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I entered the theater expecting a retelling of Juan Severino Mallari’s story in the form of a slasher film, but ended up witnessing something completely different"
4518,4,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,My expectations were completely subverted
4518,5,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The film took so much creative license and put some fantasy and supernatural twists on Juan Severino Mallari’s story, which is really inventive"
4518,6,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"But while I do appreciate this creative effort, I was not quite satisfied with its outcome"
4518,7,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"As much as I want to give lots of praises to the film, I believe it has some flaws, which, unfortunately, brought down its quality"
4518,8,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Frankly, the film was too ambitious"
4518,9,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It tried too hard to present a complex and mind-boggling concept but ended up executing it poorly
4518,10,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Hence, when I left the theater, I felt that something was missing"
4518,11,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The film didn’t turn out to be as impressive and groundbreaking as I expected it to be
4518,12,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Perhaps, they should have just focused on the time travel aspect, because that was done brilliantly"
4518,13,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Fusing it with Juan Severino Mallari’s story and excessive supernatural elements ruined what could have been an amazing time-travel historical film
4518,14,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The foundation was already there
4518,15,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It would’ve created something truly impressive and groundbreaking, until… the poor execution of the story’s very ambitious plot"
4518,16,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Also, the dialogues were clunky"
4518,17,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Many of the conversations between characters who are supposedly close to one another felt forced and awkward
4518,18,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,An example is when Jonathan suddenly shouted at Lucas after the latter butted in on his conversation with Agnes
4518,19,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"His shouting came out of nowhere, and it felt so forced"
4518,20,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Sure, he was angry at Lucas, but I didn’t feel its emotional weight due to how forced it was"
4518,21,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"(I’m aware of the reason for Jonathan’s anger, it’s the clunky dialogue that’s the problem"
4518,22,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,") There are more instances like this throughout the film, and it really bothered me"
4518,23,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The timing of the dialogues, as well as the choice of words, were really off"
4518,24,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"But despite my gripes with the film, I’m gonna give it three stars because it has some redeeming qualities"
4518,25,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Among these are Piolo Pascual and JC Santos’ impeccable performances
4518,26,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I was absolutely impressed with how Piolo was able to portray three different characters while putting certain nuances to each of them
4518,27,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The three characters are really different from one another, and you could tell that based on their individual demeanors, personalities, and body languages, which Piolo fantastically depicted"
4518,28,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I really hope he wins an award for this, because not many actors could pull this off"
4518,29,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"And JC Santos… man, he really deserves his Best Supporting Actor award"
4518,30,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Even though I was able to predict it easily, I had goosebumps when his character, Lucas, turned out to be the killer in the present day"
4518,31,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,JC pulled off the Jekyll and Hyde persona so well
4518,32,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,He should do this type of role more often
4518,33,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Furthermore, the film did well when it comes to building suspense"
4518,34,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Although it is not as scary as typical horror films, the jump scares were still frightening"
4518,35,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Additionally, the score and sound effects were spectacular — they fitted every scene perfectly and greatly intensified the eerie atmosphere of the film"
4518,36,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,And the pacing was surprisingly good
4518,37,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"In contrast to most long films, I wasn’t bothered with the runtime of this one"
4518,38,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Most scenes were paced appropriately
4518,39,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Overall, disregarding my criticisms, I enjoyed watching this film"
4518,40,imjustdrey,2024-01-07 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"It had a lot of wasted potential, but it still gave me a nice cinematic experience"
4519,1,caminavanessa,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It was nice until it got
4519,3,caminavanessa,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Decent jump scares, but that was just me shouting at everything"
4520,1,heyimspidey,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,He did all that and for what
4520,2,heyimspidey,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"But I will say it's a good slasher type film, has good enough scares and the filipino folklore into it"
4520,3,heyimspidey,2024-01-11 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Was surprised to see english subtitles already in place, so definitely will recommend to foreign oomfs if it's out digitally"
4521,1,jayclops,2024-01-09 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Missteps along the way, still I'm giving it plus (pogi papa p) pts for the ambitious adaptation of a material & fashioning some kind of a pinoy folk/urban legend concoction"

4676,1,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"One of the most anticipated films of this year's MMFF is about the curious case of Father Severino Mallari, a real-life Filipino priest who is also the country's first-ever documented serial killer"
4676,2,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"What makes people even more excited is that this is lead actor #PioloPascual 's first horror film to date, after being tried and tested in romance/drama/comedy genres"
4676,3,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"This is among the final batch of films announced to be a part of the festival shortlist, which now has 2 entries more than its usual 8"
4676,4,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"In this film, Pascual plays three distinct characters in different time periods: Doctor Jonathan (present time), war documentarian Johnrey (1940s) and the serial killer Fr"
4676,5,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Severino (1800s)
4676,6,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Individually, these key characters all face the fears of their respective eras, while their paths converge in one hidden room of the Mallari mansion"
4676,7,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"It is delightful to watch Pascual step up his game in portraying the triple characters with distinct personalities, perhaps one of the most memorable performances in this festival"
4676,8,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"However, #JCSantos brings out the real surprise of this film and there's genuine terror in his character's ultimate reveal"
4676,9,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"If only the CGI effects were polished and convincing enough, then its horrific atmosphere may have been consistent"
4676,10,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The film sure took a risk in mixing a lot of elements that could be too much to absorb in one sitting
4676,11,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Honestly, I would've wanted it to focus more on the killer priest and explore his psyche on a deeper level - his internal battles and the impact of his killings"
4676,12,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The concept of an astral time travel could be saved on another film, the blood relation of the three leads may already be used to explain their connection"
4676,13,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,They could've used the time building up the crime-horror-folklore angles rather than explain all the sci-fi
4676,14,lerryjohnofcl,2023-12-30 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Still, Mallari is a good attempt at elevating our taste in cinema"

4689,1,triplecrong,2024-01-16 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,I think what makes many people disappointed at this film was because they assumed it'd be true to historical fact

4743,3,jinuelzymon,2024-01-19 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,the sound effects was its strongest point
4743,4,jinuelzymon,2024-01-19 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,the dialogue and some scene executions were awkward
4743,5,jinuelzymon,2024-01-19 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,they failed so bad to achieve the effect of suspense
4743,6,jinuelzymon,2024-01-19 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,yes it's unusual and different if i compare it to other mainstream filipino films but the proper execution wasn't just

4747,3,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I believe this is the theme of the movie
4747,4,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Father Mallari is a real figure in Philippines history, the first documented serial killer in the country"
4747,5,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The movie tells his story from the angle of love and madness
4747,6,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"After some researches, I found that the real Father Mallari might have acted with love or he had mental issues"
4747,7,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This movie is a fiction based on the real story of Father Mallari; it has a very mysterious background and I like the darkness it presented and how the story didn’t end with political correctness; however, the ending couldn’t have ended earlier"
4747,8,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Nevertheless, there are too many jump scares (with unnecessarily too strong sound effect), which didn’t help pushing the plot forward and made it draggy"
4747,9,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The acting range (and muscles) of Piolo are amazing; his has 4-style in the movie, if you watch close enough, there is a small detail for the style of Johnathan"
4747,10,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Since Piolo has a mole near his left ear, to further differentiate the style of Johnrey and Johnathan, his mole was removed (likely by CG) when he plays Johnathan"
4747,11,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"JC Santos is really outstanding, he definitely stole the spotlight"
4747,12,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The buildup of atmosphere is great, technical aspects are pretty impressive like visual effect, lighting and scores"
4747,13,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, editing seems to be another issue"
4747,14,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"For example, the scene where Father Mallari just returned home and almost encountered Johnrey and Johnathan, had repeated 3-time in the movie"
4747,15,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Is it really necessary or audiences would be that absent-minded
4747,16,snowstage,2024-01-18 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I’m not sure whether relatively jumpy editing is the storytelling style of Director Cabrido, because his last movie      also has this issue"

4808,1,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,A familiar yet refreshing take on Filipino horror
4808,2,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Mallari served as the frontrunner for last year’s MMFF months before the festival
4808,3,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Trailers were good and promotions were good as well, but what surprised me is the difference between the final film and these promotional materials"
4808,4,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I was expecting Mallari to be Psychological Thriller or a slasher film but it was meddled with paranormal and time travel
4808,5,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"You can already pinpoint who the killer is in the first 30 minutes of the film, which is a bummer"
4808,6,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,JC Santos gave a splendid performance but his character and the twist of the story could be done better
4808,7,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Magulo yung first act, it felt like marami silang gustong ilagay sa marrative"
4808,8,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Lines were cringy and walang tao sa totoong buhay na ganon mag salita
4808,9,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The film also had unnecessary jumpscares na walang purpose sa story, very Filipino horror movie core"
4808,10,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,The second and the last act is where the story started to take ita shape and form
4808,11,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,I was glued down to my seats with what I was watching

4808,17,ayesak21,2024-01-01 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,Mallari has some of the elements of a bad and cringey horror movies but it also has refreshing takes on a newer form of horror and storytelling that uses a lore to expound on a subject matter

4819,2,myscenery,2024-01-14 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"laughed at some of its absurd parts but in hindsight, this is not a comedy film"

4836,1,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,Perhaps the most surprising aspect of Mallari is how the director Derick Cabrido managed to weave together a staggering amount of narrative threads and somehow still ended up with a cohesive story
4836,2,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Although the same thing cannot be said about its many thematic layers that often felt convoluted and reactionary, there is something to be admired (or at least respected) with how textually rich Cabrido aims his film to be"
4836,3,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Albeit inferred only through the choice of time periods (1818/1948/2018), Mallari succeeds in tracing a historical and cultural perspective on the Duterte drug war–that of a messianic figure (Duterte/Fr"
4836,4,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Mallari) assuming the role of both judge and executioner of perceived ""plagues"" of society (the sinful/addicts)–and clearly demonstrates why this is problematic and is ultimately an act of self-preservation"
4836,5,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The film takes a firm stance against mass murder, especially when it is enacted by the elites, and in the current Filipino socio-political climate this sentiment is well-appreciated"
4836,6,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"However, Mallari's portrayal of folk religion/mythology vis-a-vis Christianity is rather questionable"
4836,7,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"On one hand the film explores its anti-colonial capacity, that its integration into a Western notion of Christianity did not necessarily result into assimilation; indeed, through sinister shots littered with religious figurines (rooted in pagan worship) and the psychological corruption of Fr"
4836,8,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Mallari's morals, the film shows that folk traditions' effects and influences have stood the test of time and could even be argued as the primary feature through which Filipinos practice modern Christianity"
4836,9,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"On the other hand, however, Mallari is still unable to resist the hegemonic assumptions that these folk practices are inherently evil; they may be anti-colonial but they're just as bad, maybe even worse"
4836,10,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,They function mainly to bolster the film's hypothesis—that evil is the primary component of the world and that everything else exist only in relation to it
4836,11,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This argument is most explicitly shown through the construction of Casa Mallari as a liminal space, where different temporal (past, present, future) and existential (living and non-living) realities converge"
4836,12,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This is also the reason why the scares, although seemingly imitating the effect of sudden shock, are deliberately designed to evoke diminishing affective returns; fear is not an anomaly in the film's diegesis but is rather the norm, further supporting the essentialist view of the world and humanity as evil"
4836,13,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"And although this position works within the confines of the horror genre in which Mallari operates, I remain not fully sold on such bleak and defeatist attitude"
4836,14,gmcajayon,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I'd rather believe that there exist other ""manlalakbays"" (time travelers) with the capacity to intervene and put an end to this cycle of violence"

4847,9,gagambaboy,2024-02-02 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The ending scene, where Piolo is facing the audience as if telling them that he will be hunting them for the night, is just brilliant"

4896,1,targlicious,2024-02-27 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,three stars because: piolo FINEEEE pascual
4897,1,briancly,2024-02-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Though there was a tendency to use the cheapest of jump scares, I’d have to say that this was otherwise a fairly effective horror that was pretty decent at atmosphere building"
4897,2,briancly,2024-02-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It did drag a bit long at times and there was some confusion with it constantly switching time periods, but I can’t say it was a bad time"
4897,3,briancly,2024-02-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual is a solidly charismatic lead
4897,4,briancly,2024-02-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It was a pretty solid effort even if I wasn’t totally happy with its execution
4897,5,briancly,2024-02-28 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I can definitely respect the film
4898,1,aaronlm,2024-01-17 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,This film fumbles its creepy Filipino folklore concept
4898,2,aaronlm,2024-01-17 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The concept had potential – a creepy urban legend stemming from a small provincial town, it was an interesting background"
4898,3,aaronlm,2024-01-17 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The film tries to be complex, weaving multiple narratives and timelines together, delving into astral projects and whatnot"
4898,4,aaronlm,2024-01-17 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"However, this complexity ends up muddying the story instead of enriching it"
4898,5,aaronlm,2024-01-17 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"It feels like the writer bit off more than they could chew, lacking the clear vision needed to pull off a compelling horror or thriller"
4898,6,aaronlm,2024-01-17 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The tension and suspense, crucial ingredients for any horror film, are noticeably absent"
4898,7,aaronlm,2024-01-17 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The overall storytelling, from pacing to camerawork, shot selections and editing choices fail to build any real sense of unease, suspense or anticipation; falling short of the genre's demands"
4898,8,aaronlm,2024-01-17 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"With a tighter focus, a clearer narrative structure, and a director with a stronger grasp of the genre, ""Mallari"" could have been a genuinely scary and unsettling experience"
4898,9,aaronlm,2024-01-17 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"As it stands, it's a forgettable mess"
4899,1,sorrelspiral,2024-02-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Came for a Janella Salvador film, came out with lots of surprises in this filmAlthough she didn't have a large part in this film, she's great as a supporting character with Piolo Pascual's striking performance as Johnathan who tries to bring closure to a family curse that spans generations"
4899,2,sorrelspiral,2024-02-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"Was not expecting a lot of supernatural elements to this film, along with attempted social commentary that ended up falling flat"
4899,3,sorrelspiral,2024-02-29 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,All I can say is that Agnes deserved better
4900,1,hmaverion,2024-02-29 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Watched this in an empty theatre with my parents, kinda made up for the bad VFX"

4913,1,jmxxz69,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,I still appreciated how they tried exploring more of the mythical side of Pinoy folklore beyond just the typical serial killer priest storyline So yun ngaa
4913,2,jmxxz69,2023-12-28 00:00:00.000,90.0,ltbx,"It proves Pinoy horror can be truly gripping kung ma invest sa ambiance, culture research and solid acting performances instead of relying on cheap pop-out scares"
4914,1,11threel,2024-03-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,loved how it took a (slight) unconventional turn towards most Filipino horror films but still remained to its roots as it leaned towards folklore and telltales
4914,2,11threel,2024-03-12 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,but the latter part was quite EASY to predict

4918,3,evilngk,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"one of those films i knew instantly i wouldn't like it in the prologue and title card, and was so deeply disappointed at having been conned by that synopsis"
4918,4,evilngk,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"it's not a period psychological horror about religion and mental illness, which is what that description implies, but so much bullshit with astral projection and time travelling (you can't be fucking kidding me"
4918,5,evilngk,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,) jump scares and spirits zooming into the camera
4918,6,evilngk,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"it addresses nothing about spanish colonialism, christianity, or the locals, but rings through the same cycle about the ~ugly poors~ and lower class being practitioners of evil and the dark arts"
4918,8,evilngk,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"okay, groundbreaking and sooo progressive"
4918,9,evilngk,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,of course
4918,10,evilngk,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,but what i absolutely loathed and consider super juvenile in horror filmmaking were the jump scares and sound design
4918,11,evilngk,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,i HATED the way sound was used in this
4918,12,evilngk,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"disgusting, cheap, no finesse or subtlety, the kind of thing writers and directors with no creativity use to spook the audience cos they have no talent crafting an atmospheric horror with the background and environment of its characters"
4918,13,evilngk,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,"came back home and discussed it a lot and everything we talked about just got me angrier, seeing how dumb this film was"
4918,14,evilngk,2024-03-14 00:00:00.000,10.0,ltbx,a waste of my time and money

4928,7,ferdsquinio,2024-03-17 18:07:41.954,10.0,ltbx,the feel of having an animated manananggal in full focus made me think like im watching Gagamboy with better graphics; manananggal scenes look like she's a gagamboy villain for a superhero genre than a ghost for horror film
4928,8,ferdsquinio,2024-03-17 18:07:41.954,10.0,ltbx,i dont know how to articulate better than this--maybe Shake Rattle and Roll Extreme sequel

4933,2,ohlunes,2024-03-23 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,+adding half a star bc i watched this at a screening in a (rumored to be) haunted hotel which just made everything so much betteredit: after a few rewatches and pondering i kinda realized the misogynistic undertones of this movie and it doesn’t sit right with me

4936,2,mcrodriguez,2024-03-21 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I consider the portrayal of the trans character problematic because there is a greater focus on their perceived immorality compared to the other victims of Mallari

4936,5,mcrodriguez,2024-03-21 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,A greater emphasis is on trauma similar to the works of Mike Flanagan
4936,6,mcrodriguez,2024-03-21 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I think the story is a combination between midnight mass and haunting of Hill house
4936,7,mcrodriguez,2024-03-21 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Piolo Pascual convincingly portrays three different roles
4936,8,mcrodriguez,2024-03-21 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Elisse Joson's mid Atlantic accent was a surprising detail that definitely sets her character in that time and place

5090,12,poet1c_,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,His story is rich with moral dilemmas and gray areas and very significant and relevant topics such as psychological disorders that could have been interpreted and revealed to us in a way na may twist pa rin siguro
5090,13,poet1c_,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,without adding those unnecessary fictional elements

5090,27,poet1c_,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,I liked or maybe loved the creativity that was poured unto to the making of this film
5090,28,poet1c_,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,I needed some hope na mayroon pa ring mga sining na pinaghihirapan at hindi pineperahan
5090,29,poet1c_,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,30.0,ltbx,"And, Mallari maybe gave me that hope, gaano man kaliit"

5100,31,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,This film was mediocre
5100,32,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Here are my thoughts on the movie:Positives:- It’s a decently directed film
5100,33,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Roderick Cabrido did a fairly serviceable job with the film’s overall direction
5100,34,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,There are definitely some moments here where I can see what they’re going for
5100,35,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"As for the cast, I thought they were pretty solid"
5100,36,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,A lot of the performances here are good
5100,37,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Their chemistry with each other was also fairly decent here
5100,38,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual’s performance certainly shines throughout the entire duration of the film
5100,39,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,He’s performance was good
5100,40,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"- Visually, the film actually looks pretty good"
5100,41,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"There are plenty of shots here that looks excellent, especially the final shot"
5100,42,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Some of the camera work that they’ve done here is also pretty good
5100,43,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Aside from its overall cinematography, the film also has a solid atmosphere"
5100,44,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,There were some moments where I find this aspect to be incredibly effective
5100,45,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The music composed by Von de Guzman is excellent
5100,46,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"It fits the tone of the film, and at times, it was effective"
5100,47,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"- As for its premise, this aspect was the reason I wanted to watch it"
5100,48,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"The film has a very intriguing premise, and there are moments where I can see the potential"
5100,49,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, the execution could’ve been better (more on that later on)"

5100,54,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Negatives:- As for my issues, despite a pretty interesting premise, the execution certainly leaves a lot to be desired, especially with the script, which was rather lackluster"
5100,55,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"There are some moments here where I can see the potential that it has, but it often devolves into a generic and messy story"
5100,56,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The structure here was all over the place
5100,57,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It doesn’t really help that it was also underdeveloped
5100,58,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It’s really disappointing how underbaked the premise of this movie is
5100,59,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"- Not only is the story very lackluster, but the same thing can also be said about the characters themselves"
5100,60,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Sure, the performances from the cast members may be solid, the characters that they are portraying, on the other hand, just fall flat to me"
5100,61,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,I didn’t really care about or find any of them to be all that interesting
5100,62,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The dialogue is also pretty terrible at times
5100,63,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"It tries to be modern with its dialogue here, but it usually ends up being really cringeworthy"
5100,64,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"- Aside from that, the editing here is also pretty choppy"
5100,65,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Not only from the overall structure of its narrative but also within its jump scares
5100,66,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Speaking of its jump scares, they aren’t good"
5100,67,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Sure, the film can be creepy at times, but it’s not all that scary"
5100,68,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The jump scares that it does here often end up being predictable and clichéd
5100,69,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It did this weird edit that was really sloppy
5100,70,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It doesn’t help that the movie also bombards you with unnecessary sound effects
5100,71,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"- As for its visual effects, they aren’t good either; they’re actually quite awful"
5100,72,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,Some of the special effects that it does in here look pretty cheap and noticeable
5100,73,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It could’ve been a lot better
5100,74,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Pacing-wise, this aspect is very inconsistent"
5100,75,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"There are a couple of moments where the movie is a bit of a drag to get through, and other times, it feels incredibly rushed"
5100,76,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It just felt messy
5100,77,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Some scenes here are also pretty lackluster, which affects the pacing even more"
5100,78,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Final Thoughts:Overall, Mallari (2023) is such a mixed bag for me"
5100,79,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"There are aspects here that I really liked, and some that don’t really work whatsoever"
5100,80,bogs02,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,It’s a decently directed film by Roderick Cabrido

5107,2,dolores_manapat,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,this movie otherwise you'll miss the important details
5107,3,dolores_manapat,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Despite having a messy flow of events, if you have enough comprehension of it all, it's a good film until towards THE ENDING"
5107,4,dolores_manapat,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The ending could have been better
5107,5,dolores_manapat,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The clues and evidences were already there, he was JUST SO BAD at investigating and connecting shit and he was so impulsive in his decisions and there is no scene he is CALM AND THINKING RATIONALLY"

5107,8,dolores_manapat,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,The ending really disappointed me I wanted it to be a happy ending where the curse is no longer existent yet he (main protagonist) didn't learn anything at all despite everytthing he saw in time travelling and watching the tapes of his ancestor
5107,9,dolores_manapat,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I bet his ancestors had the biggest facepalm in their graves when he decided his decision

5107,13,dolores_manapat,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,yes piolo in this film is so hot no wonder he was my first childhood crush
5108,1,nullkiosk,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,natatawa ako sa mga jumpscares huhu
5109,1,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,There were a lot of good elements but ultimately this movie fell flat for me
5109,2,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It just felt like the movie was trying to do too much and alot of it just ended up half-baked and under developed
5109,3,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"It's supernatural horror, a slasher, a time travel movie, a murder mystery, a social commentary, a psychological thriller, it just feels disjointed and I'm left feeling disapointed because there were alot of good ideas that felt just felt jammed in there"
5109,4,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I really didn't care much for the time travel plot which is unfortunate because it makes-up like 85% of the plot
5109,5,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I would have much loved to see how they would have approached the film if they went full on psychological horror cause the third act with JC Santos and Piolo Pascual duking it out was so great
5109,6,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Dialogue and Acting was so on point and the scene just felt so fleshed out compared to the rest of the screenplay
5109,7,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I would have loved to see an angle where the mallari curse wasn't real so Jonathan just feels like he's going insane for the whole film and maybe he thinks that he's the killer and the whole 3rd act scene with JC Santos just plays out
5109,8,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,But yeah we got this instead
5109,9,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I will say though I did like the final scene at the hospital It was probably the only supernatural scene in the whole movie where I actually felt unnerved but then they followed it up with the next scene which not only ruined the momentum but it was just completely uneccessary
5109,10,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,We know that what jonathan did was wrong and we know the implications of his actions because we literally see it as clear as day in the scenes prior so why add another scene of the characters just talking about what we already know
5109,11,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Don't take your audience for granted we can understand what you're trying to say without you having to spell it out for us
5109,12,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Another issue I had with the film was the fact that it just wasn't scary
5109,13,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The ""horror"" in this movie just comes from an abundance of jumpscares and loud accompanying music stings"
5109,14,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Of course if you're gonna throw something at my face I'm bound to react
5109,15,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,All in all I really feel like this movie was a missed opportunity
5109,16,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The acting is great, production and sets were great"
5109,17,strawberry_tea,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Maybe it was just too ambitious or maybe it wasn't ambitious enough
5110,1,jyvynce,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,nice premise
5110,2,jyvynce,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"the movie tried, i guess"

5111,2,veeeenx,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,The first hour of the movie will make you curious about the story but i expected the plot twist to be as great as the first hour but nope

5113,1,kkongnyangz,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Whoever was in charge of the story/screenplay for this film was heavily inspired by existing horror movies such as the entire Insidious franchise (the traveling through dreams concept among the Mallaris was too reminiscent of the franchise), Inception, and the like"
5113,2,kkongnyangz,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"The Avengers Infinity War-esque CGI makes the scenes a bit funnier than scary, too"
5113,3,kkongnyangz,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I see why people would view this film as a piece that's undergoing an identity crisis (because I agree)

5241,1,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"this is the characters' review:if there is anything we know about the mallaris, it's that they're devoted to the people they love"
5241,2,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"father severino mallari, despite being the marketed center of the story as the first serial killer priest in the philippines, turned out to be a tortured character, who was flawed enough to make mistakes and have turbulent emotions about the people he loved"
5241,3,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"they gave father severino, a supposed serial killer, a heart, and a facet that made him undeniably human"
5241,4,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"personally, i like when supposed villains/evil characters show that human quality to themselves"
5241,5,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"severino, all distraught and maddened yet surrendered by the situation of his mother, still found the strength in his knees to dance his monster-turned-mother"
5241,6,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sure, poke fun at him and call him a ""mama's boy"", but it's not like he had a choice in the matter"
5241,7,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,especially not when the choices were your own mother or your principles
5241,8,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and how many times have our mothers derailed our principles completely
5241,9,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,severino's love was devout
5241,10,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"moving onto the second mallari, johnrey: i couldn't say much about him that isn't about his intelligence, martyrdom, and commitment to the future generation"
5241,11,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,johnrey ended the curse by not choosing the same path severino did
5241,12,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"johnrey was selfless, and his love didn't manifest in a way that would put others in harm's way"
5241,13,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,johnrey's love was kind
5241,14,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and to the third mallari, jonathan"
5241,15,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"amongst the rest, jonathan chose all the wrong choices"
5241,16,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,even agnes herself said it would've been better had jonathan let him die
5241,17,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"jonathan all throughout the film was misleading, taking on the role of an unreliable narrator, or at least, an ambiguous one"
5241,18,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"if anything, jonathan's love is unrelenting"
5241,19,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and to the special mention, lucas"
5241,20,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"lucas, oh, he could've been everything"
5241,21,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"had this been an alarcon-centric film, it would still be as interesting"
5241,22,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"lucas's motivations which eventually flowed into desperation almost sounded as if he wasn't only faithfully attached to jonathan mallari, but also a servant who loved his faulty master through and through"
5241,23,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"lucas calling jonathan ""amo"" was something else"
5241,24,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i'm not sure whether i'm viewing everything through the colored lenses of queerness, but lucas's devotion to jonathan had undertones of romanticism and obsession that could only be explained if he were in love with him"
5241,25,ave8888,2024-06-21 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and such display would make for good alternate universe writings about this story

5264,9,escapistmedia,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,70.0,ltbx,"The suspense was present, though I wish Mallari had touched upon the concepts of folk religion and witchcraft a little further to better understand the sociocultural contexts in which the settings of the film revolved in"

5504,2,jamcritics,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Except it was

5504,4,jamcritics,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It becomes very awry and sleazy as the film drags on, hoping to reach a certain angle that only becomes a disappointment especially for horror fans"
5504,5,jamcritics,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,There were so much that bothered me from this one especially as a horror and film fan
5504,6,jamcritics,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,And it didn’t help knowing that Mallari is based on a real person

5504,8,jamcritics,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The only merit I would give this film is JC Santos’ performance that always has me in awe
5504,9,jamcritics,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,He can play any sort of role perfectly that just suits him
5504,10,jamcritics,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Also the cinematography that had great camera tricks using the Dutch angles and that one scene using mirror between JC Santos & Piolo Pascual’s fight in the end
5504,11,jamcritics,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The point for this film was to follow the true story of Mallari, the Philippines’ first ever recorded serial killer from the 19th century"
5504,12,jamcritics,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Except it was all a ploy to lure people in, making its audience expect a biopic of some sort of a serial killer that only became stupid, fictionalizing almost everything there is to Mallari and making the audience see that serial killers can have good intentions"
5504,13,jamcritics,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"There are a few serial killer films/shows that actually lets its audience look further into the person’s story (or from their perspective), yet also distinguishing the fact that these people are villains and that you have to understand that you are seeing everything from the villain’s eyes"

5675,2,thereseybanez,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,was hoping for a telling of his lore but instead had an overly dramatized rendition of his storyit's okay naman just not what i expected and it was incredibly difficult to follow along with the plot

5676,1,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,When I first saw the trailer for this last MMFF I was onboard with it
5676,2,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,I read ahead about what Fr
5676,3,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Severino Mallari was all about
5676,4,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Biopics are my bread and butter, and with every biopic, or in this case, an adaptation, I anticipate a degree of creative storytelling to make it more feasable for cinema"
5676,5,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,What was the films take on this
5676,6,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"A Generational ""curse"" in the Mallari family"
5676,8,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"The real Mallari was allegedly scizhophrenic; so I was hoping theyd explore that, a mental illness angle plaguing the family for generations"
5676,9,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Much to my disappointment, the movie veered away from that and laid blame not into the serial killer but to an entirely fictional group of people who ""used"" this serial killer to kill"
5676,10,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Severino (Piolo Pascual) was essentially forced to kill out of love
5676,11,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,A theme which kind of fell flat because of how many things the film wanted to juggle
5676,12,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Was it a mystery
5676,13,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Was it a thriller
5676,14,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,A supernatural horror
5676,15,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,A sci-fi
5676,16,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Yes, sci-fi"
5676,17,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Taking away Fr Severino's agency erases or paints the actions of the real Mallari as not his own choice; if it was indeed mental illness it wouldve made more sense but instead it was the malicious work of well meaning witches
5676,18,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Which, in an original story MAY work, but not in this"
5676,19,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,Its supposed to be BASED on a real story yet it strayed a little too much into fiction
5676,20,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,A creative choice that MIGHTVE worked if only they didnt add astral projection and timey wimey shit into it too
5676,21,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,OH plus origins of a notorious Philippine mythic creature
5676,22,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"There were some creative shots here and there, I particularly liked this one shot when John was walking through a door and a dolly zoom boxed him in the corridor"
5676,23,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,However the scares were lack luster
5676,24,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,It relied heavily jumpscares which became old fast and can be easily expected
5676,25,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"While the makeup and visual effects were great, I dont think it utilized it enough to anything other than"
5676,26,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,** SPOILERS FOR THE ENDING **god I hated ending
5676,27,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Heres DOCTOR John Mallari; granted hes a pediatrician (I think) with a FIANCE whose also a DOCTOR thats dying bc she got stabbed, his first response was NOT to bring her to a nearby hospital for first aid"
5676,28,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"And despite being on life support clearly conscious and capable of surviving given medical aid, MISTER JOHNATAN STILL DECIDES TO BRING BACK THE BIRD AND TAKE THE CURSE"
5676,29,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,WHICH IS THE WORST WAY TO GIVE AGENCY BACK TO THE MALLARI FAMILY when the previous 2 mallari's tried retreiving their lost agency by breaking the curse only for millenial Piolo Pascual to take it back
5676,30,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"In summary, story is Messy"
5676,31,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"Acting is subpar, EXCEPT for JC Santos he stole the show"
5676,32,suusheese,2024-06-23 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,He was amazing and a twist I saw a mile a way but still welcome because of how well he acted

5882,2,riri_lv,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Ang ganda pa ng concept, something I would be interested to know so much about"
5882,3,riri_lv,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,This film truly has a great potential if only was written with a different and clearer storyline
5882,4,riri_lv,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Una sa lahat, nakakanginig ‘yung mga linyahan haha akala mo mga nakuha lang somewhere on the internet just to match this generation’s language"
5882,5,riri_lv,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Hay, na-dismaya lang ako nang kaunti pero ayos na rin"
5882,6,riri_lv,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Nawalan na rin ng sense of suspense sa ibang mga scenes dahil nga ang predictable na ng mga susunod na jumpscare, halos sunod-sunod kasi at ‘yung iba parang out of context pa"
5882,7,riri_lv,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Despite all the shortcomings, cinematography still did its job"

5882,11,riri_lv,2024-06-22 00:00:00.000,50.0,ltbx,"Overall, this horror film definitely achieved its purpose to make the audience feel scared but just fall short to convey the concept’s full potential"

5889,3,miguellugtu,2024-06-24 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,So the first Pinoy serial killer story is also because of manananggal and witches and werewolves and ghosts and astral projection and copycat killers

5890,2,athsxx,2024-06-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,It's just that there sooo many things happening and the plot twist was became too much that it feels like it was actually unnecessary
5890,3,athsxx,2024-06-24 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,I wish they could have just focus on the story of Father Mallari and his life story rather than inserting generational curse

5924,2,wilfredlucas,2024-06-24 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,"""Mallari"" uses a fact-based story about the Philippines' only serial killer to tell a mess of a time travel, witchcraft, and folk creature story, and it's not even scary at all"

5924,4,wilfredlucas,2024-06-24 00:00:00.000,40.0,ltbx,The three-timeline narrative is a bit too ambitious for what the film ends up being since the direction and production just could not create any dramatic tension

5955,1,cxtianblas,2024-06-24,70.0,ltbx,"not that scary at all, but it can be more, btw piolo outlives his acting here and jc really again proves how good he is as an actor"
5955,2,cxtianblas,2024-06-24,70.0,ltbx,this is such an explanation of generational curse of filipino traits that can't even be broken

5966,2,gabeeopinion,2024-06-24,40.0,ltbx,"though, what they did with the complex plot and how they laid it out without being confusing was good"
5966,3,gabeeopinion,2024-06-24,40.0,ltbx,the visuals of the film were decent but i wish they paid more attention to the camera & lens they used since i think it took away from the mood and overall vibe of the film
5966,4,gabeeopinion,2024-06-24,40.0,ltbx,the choreographed fight scenes were pretty good doe and acting from papa p and the rest of the cast was superb
5967,1,twinkoyaki,2024-06-24,70.0,ltbx,should've stayed with the genre psychological/thriller where they focused on Father Severino instead of doing these
