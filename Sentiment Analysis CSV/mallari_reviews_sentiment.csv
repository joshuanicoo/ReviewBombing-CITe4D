Mallari,0,1,IAmRalphTrani,2024-01-01,60.0,imdb,"Great story, Cheap Jumpscares: The story was alright, it had a little bit of humour, a little bit of twist, but I wished the story showed a little bit of a long prologue before the scary parts started"
Mallari,0,2,IAmRalphTrani,2024-01-01,60.0,imdb,"It's like every filipino horror film, always start with a jumpscare or a suspense already, this makes every scare in the movie expected"
Mallari,0,3,IAmRalphTrani,2024-01-01,60.0,imdb,The cinematic camera movements we're pretty good especially when the mother and the old century priest started dancing each other
Mallari,0,4,IAmRalphTrani,2024-01-01,60.0,imdb,"Some of the dialogues weren't fit for the scene, but that dosen't mean the whole story is bad"
Mallari,0,5,IAmRalphTrani,2024-01-01,60.0,imdb,The movie will be still counted for being a horror but do not expect good scares
Mallari,1,1,redemptions_love,2024-07-09,70.0,imdb,Interesting plot
Mallari,1,2,redemptions_love,2024-07-09,70.0,imdb,: There are pros and cons to this film
Mallari,1,3,redemptions_love,2024-07-09,70.0,imdb,"It did remind me of a Made for Television Movie, and horror elements did come across rather B Grade"
Mallari,1,4,redemptions_love,2024-07-09,70.0,imdb,Because of the latter this film may not be for everyone
Mallari,1,5,redemptions_love,2024-07-09,70.0,imdb,Certainly elements of it could be improved upon
Mallari,1,6,redemptions_love,2024-07-09,70.0,imdb,"In terms of horror, I personally find B Grade Slashers and special effects to be rather campy and fun"
Mallari,1,7,redemptions_love,2024-07-09,70.0,imdb,So this didn't bother me at all
Mallari,1,8,redemptions_love,2024-07-09,70.0,imdb,"The reason I watched this film all the way through was 100% due to the plot to the film, I found it very interesting and well done"

Mallari,1,11,redemptions_love,2024-07-09,70.0,imdb,"I won't leave any spoilers, all I will say is that right at the end the plot caught me by surprise, which rarely happens when I watch movies"

Mallari,1,15,redemptions_love,2024-07-09,70.0,imdb,"Lastly, I found the switching of time periods to not be confusing in this film at all"
Mallari,1,16,redemptions_love,2024-07-09,70.0,imdb,"It worked smoothly in my opinion, it's actually one of the things I enjoyed the very most"
Mallari,2,1,phristocardiel,2023-12-29,50.0,imdb,It's ok: A few jump scares here and there
Mallari,2,2,phristocardiel,2023-12-29,50.0,imdb,Movies' first half was well written
Mallari,2,3,phristocardiel,2023-12-29,50.0,imdb,Script had humor and energy during the first half
Mallari,2,4,phristocardiel,2023-12-29,50.0,imdb,"The 2nd half, though, felt like it was originally written in English and then translated to Tagalog"
Mallari,2,5,phristocardiel,2023-12-29,50.0,imdb,Dialogue felt off sometimes and I wish the attitude of the first half carried on throughout the movie
Mallari,2,6,phristocardiel,2023-12-29,50.0,imdb,The mystery and the way things unfold will keep you hook
Mallari,2,7,phristocardiel,2023-12-29,50.0,imdb,"But once everything is out, it all goes downhill"

Mallari,2,9,phristocardiel,2023-12-29,50.0,imdb,It's been done multiple times and I wish the film could've wrapped differently
Mallari,2,10,phristocardiel,2023-12-29,50.0,imdb,Horror fans might find this average
Mallari,3,1,ralphralf,2024-06-30,60.0,imdb,Good but there are buts

Mallari,3,3,ralphralf,2024-06-30,60.0,imdb,"The atmospheric tension is palpable, and the eerie settings enhance the overall sense of dread"
Mallari,3,4,ralphralf,2024-06-30,60.0,imdb,"However, despite its strong elements, the film falls short in delivering a seamless narrative"
Mallari,3,5,ralphralf,2024-06-30,60.0,imdb,"The storytelling feels convoluted at times, which detracts from the otherwise engaging experience"
Mallari,3,6,ralphralf,2024-06-30,60.0,imdb,"The acting is commendable, with the cast delivering convincing performances that elevate the film"
Mallari,3,7,ralphralf,2024-06-30,60.0,imdb,"Additionally, the film's setting is well-executed, effectively immersing the audience in the haunting world of **Mallari**"
Mallari,3,8,ralphralf,2024-06-30,60.0,imdb,"While the presence of typical Filipino tropes might be seen as a drawback by some, I personally didn't mind them as they added a cultural authenticity to the film"
Mallari,3,9,ralphralf,2024-06-30,60.0,imdb,"Overall, **Mallari** is a solid horror film with a lot of potential"
Mallari,3,10,ralphralf,2024-06-30,60.0,imdb,"With some refinements in its storytelling, it could have been a standout in the genre"
Mallari,3,11,ralphralf,2024-06-30,60.0,imdb,"Nonetheless, it remains an enjoyable watch for horror enthusiasts and a notable entry in Filipino cinema"
Mallari,4,1,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,"Had huge potential but failed miserably: Movie could've been great but as I was watching it, I got totally lost and confused as to what the movie was trying to achieve"
Mallari,4,2,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,The jump scares were so predictable and the CGI was just plain awful
Mallari,4,3,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,What's with those CGI ghost faces
Mallari,4,4,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,The way they CGI'd Gloria Diaz was cringey AF
Mallari,4,5,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,Not to mention those awful manananggal wings which literally made us want to stop watching the entire film
Mallari,4,6,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,One major ick I have was Padre Severino's weird beard
Mallari,4,7,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,Like couldn't they have made it more natural
Mallari,4,8,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,It looked so fake I couldn't take him seriously
Mallari,4,9,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,They honestly should've just invested on the cast's makeup or prosthetics to make everything look convincing
Mallari,4,10,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,I honestly could not help but compare it to cult favorite Filipino horror movies like Feng Shui and Sukob
Mallari,4,11,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,No CGIs there but it was definitely scarier and more realistic by a mile
Mallari,4,12,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,"I still gave it four stars because, okay, it was ambitious - I'll give them that"
Mallari,4,13,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,But it was too ambitious it failed to just stick to what people came to watch the movie for - Fr

Mallari,4,15,agnesmarieglapus,2024-06-22,40.0,imdb,"I think a lot of people were expecting to watch and know more of his backstory and his motivation, but sadly this was a huge opportunity missed"

Mallari,5,1,katrinamacaballug,2024-07-01,60.0,imdb,The script is lacking
Mallari,5,2,katrinamacaballug,2024-07-01,60.0,imdb,: The stort is about the first serial killer accounted even before jack the ripper and I really expected for it to have more eccentricities or edge in it's script alone wherein the whole concept of the movie is about the dark side of the Philippine history
Mallari,5,3,katrinamacaballug,2024-07-01,60.0,imdb,"The jumpscares are not that good as well, the acting of the main characters are lacking as well"
Mallari,5,4,katrinamacaballug,2024-07-01,60.0,imdb,"However, kudos to the production team in having that courage to showcase a fresh idea in the mainstream entertainment, I have been hearing this in documentaries and podcasts for quite sometime already but not to actually watch it and be reinvented"
Mallari,6,1,cyrilgetroika,2024-06-24,10.0,imdb,"Promising plot, brutal storytelling: I was expecting a historical narration of what transpired 200 years ago, instead I got a crappy, delusional story that's literally all over the place"
Mallari,6,2,cyrilgetroika,2024-06-24,10.0,imdb,"I hope the writer took the time to really research this thing, instead we got something inspired by Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"
Mallari,6,3,cyrilgetroika,2024-06-24,10.0,imdb,"He might have come up with a great idea, then midestream decided, ""heck, I don't have enough factual info I'll just swing by the fences and hope I hit gold"
Mallari,6,4,cyrilgetroika,2024-06-24,10.0,imdb,It's such an awful film I was embarrassed 30 mins in during movie night
Mallari,6,5,cyrilgetroika,2024-06-24,10.0,imdb,Apologies to my family for dragging them to watch and waste 2+ hours of their time
Mallari,6,6,cyrilgetroika,2024-06-24,10.0,imdb,FAMAS should be ashamed for giving the Best Picture award to this film
Mallari,6,7,cyrilgetroika,2024-06-24,10.0,imdb,As Filipinos I'm sure we can come up with something better than this

Mallari,7,4,darkgreymatter,2024-01-05,80.0,imdb,"Regrettably, the movie's downside lies in the inclusion of unnecessary jump scares, creating an abrupt disruption in the flow of the film"
Mallari,7,5,darkgreymatter,2024-01-05,80.0,imdb,This drawback proves to be a significant dent in the overall quality of an otherwise promising story
Mallari,7,6,darkgreymatter,2024-01-05,80.0,imdb,"Despite this setback, it's important to note that ""Mallari"" still stands as a commendable horror film, especially when compared to the usual offerings in the Philippine horror genre"
Mallari,7,7,darkgreymatter,2024-01-05,80.0,imdb,"Its compelling plot, historical ties, and the commendable performances of the cast elevate it above many counterparts, making it a worthwhile watch for enthusiasts of the genre"
Mallari,8,2,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,: The movie has it's moments
Mallari,8,3,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,"The actors did a good job with what they had, and personally, the best scenes of the movie were in the 1800s"
Mallari,8,4,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,The movie falls on a lot of tropes
Mallari,8,5,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,"It has a lot of cheap jumpscares, and I wish they'd have used more of the runtime of the film to flesh out the story, rather than use it on not-so-great jumpscares"
Mallari,8,6,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,"The cinematography for this film was good, as well as the acting, but the script was just okay- this isn't to say the story is bad but the dialogue could've been written better"
Mallari,8,7,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,"The story *is* ambitious, but I feel as if it wasn't fleshed out enough to be worthy of a rewatch, and the script is okay, but it did definitely wasn't good"
Mallari,8,8,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,"(Personal problems or nitpicks with the movie) I can recall this one scene, near the start of the film of which I couldn't exactly point out it's purpose"
Mallari,8,9,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,"Basically, a character was walking in the night, in the middle of the forest while having e-s*x"
Mallari,8,10,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,"While the character has e-s*x, the murderer sneaks up from behind them and hacks them too death"
Mallari,8,11,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,"The scene wasn't that sexually explicit, but the dialogue, as well as the character's hand motions made it uncomfortable to watch"
Mallari,8,12,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,"If the dialogue's purpose in that scene was to be humorous, it failed- as when I watched it in a packed theater, most were silent, even when said character was hacked to death"
Mallari,8,13,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,"There are more scenes to where I feel the film jumps the shark, like when a character loses their keys in an struggle with the murderer, but end up knocking them out, then going down to try and escape using their car but realizing they don't have it then going back to where the murderer is just for the key"
Mallari,8,14,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,"Then a scene where the same character very clearly has the ability to kill the murderer, but does not despite the murderer having clear killing intent"
Mallari,8,15,kaiyamaramobs,2024-01-07,40.0,imdb,I feel like this scenes like this spefically devalues and reduces the enjoyment of the film for some
Mallari,9,1,ecadiente,2024-01-02,100.0,imdb,"We still want to watch this Mallari: Movie review of Mallari (2023) is called: ""Fates Entwined: The Chilling Legacy of Fr"

Mallari,10,2,jeromesgabilo,2024-06-27,30.0,imdb,"I don't even think that this horror film was worthy of bagging the Best Picture trophy at the FAMAS Awards, which was the Philippines' Oscars counterpart"
Mallari,10,3,jeromesgabilo,2024-06-27,30.0,imdb,I really think that Piolo Pascual being the protagonist lifted the entire film to its heights
Mallari,10,4,jeromesgabilo,2024-06-27,30.0,imdb,His performance was indeed one of the most excellent I've seen this year
Mallari,10,5,jeromesgabilo,2024-06-27,30.0,imdb,"Unfortunately, even his performance could not save the poor writing of the film"
Mallari,10,6,jeromesgabilo,2024-06-27,30.0,imdb,The scripts felt amateurish and second-rate
Mallari,10,7,jeromesgabilo,2024-06-27,30.0,imdb,"It was a wasted potential, and I wished the scenes were compressed to just one and a half hour running time"
Mallari,11,1,ana_k31,2024-06-29,40.0,imdb,What's the hype about
Mallari,11,2,ana_k31,2024-06-29,40.0,imdb,: I honestly thought that I'd be seeing something that somehow has a bit of historical twist at least but yeah what they had was this horror movie
Mallari,11,3,ana_k31,2024-06-29,40.0,imdb,"I mean, come on, it's the first serial killer in the Philippines and then suddenly it all turns to aswang and kulam"
Mallari,11,5,ana_k31,2024-06-29,40.0,imdb,I feel like it's slow paced because a lot has gone on and it's only the half of the film
Mallari,11,6,ana_k31,2024-06-29,40.0,imdb,"Well, a lot will happen, but was all of it needed"
Mallari,11,7,ana_k31,2024-06-29,40.0,imdb,"Sorry, but I just need to point this out, most of the actors don't know how to speak kapampangan"

Mallari,11,9,ana_k31,2024-06-29,40.0,imdb,"Lols

Overall great acting from the cast most especially Piolo"
Mallari,11,10,ana_k31,2024-06-29,40.0,imdb,"But, I have to agree with what everyone is saying, it's not Best Picture material and what is with all the hype"
Mallari,12,1,oliverosjulianna,2024-01-19,40.0,imdb,MID: They really had potential with this movie because of the plot but they blew it up BIG TIME

Mallari,12,6,oliverosjulianna,2024-01-19,40.0,imdb,"The main character is DUMB, NAIVE, AND EPAL SOOOOO EPAL"
Mallari,12,7,oliverosjulianna,2024-01-19,40.0,imdb,The only reason why this has 4 stars was because they featured the true to life serial killer priest and his segment of the story was good
Mallari,12,8,oliverosjulianna,2024-01-19,40.0,imdb,Do yourself a favor and not watch the movie cause you did not miss much tbh
Mallari,13,1,horrorlover-96807,2024-06-22,90.0,imdb,Only the CGI effects bothers me

Mallari,13,7,horrorlover-96807,2024-06-22,90.0,imdb,"The only thing that I really didn't like was the corny CGI especially the Manananggal scene, and the 3D shadows"
Mallari,13,8,horrorlover-96807,2024-06-22,90.0,imdb,(Except on the CGI old creepy face of Donña Facunda I really like that) If they fix and work more on the CGI I would give this the perfect rating
Mallari,13,9,horrorlover-96807,2024-06-22,90.0,imdb,I know that some Filipino editors have hard time working on CGI's but I would love if they just use a person shadow rather then 3D

Mallari,14,3,masrandomness,2024-07-02,50.0,imdb,"Turns out the movie includes elements of time travel and explores various Filipino ""aswangs"" and beliefs"
Mallari,14,4,masrandomness,2024-07-02,50.0,imdb,"Overall, the film isn't bad, but it focuses on the wrong ideas and characters"
Mallari,14,5,masrandomness,2024-07-02,50.0,imdb,I would have preferred if it had delved deeper into Father Mallari's mental breakdown and what set him apart from those who choose not to commit murder
Mallari,14,6,masrandomness,2024-07-02,50.0,imdb,"Instead, the movie emphasizes Filipino folklore, which downplays the severity of his crimes"
Mallari,14,7,masrandomness,2024-07-02,50.0,imdb,"One particular scene that I disliked is when Father Mallari tells Jonathan not to get the ""sisiw"", despite having killed over 50 people himself for it"

Mallari,15,10,ReviewbyAfrica,2024-06-30,100.0,imdb,"Hence, I am writing this review"
Mallari,15,11,ReviewbyAfrica,2024-06-30,100.0,imdb,It is best to watch with friends
Mallari,16,1,pliant-moods,2024-07-10,10.0,imdb,"Plot lacks creativity, better off as a true-crime: The casts were exceptionally well"
Mallari,16,2,pliant-moods,2024-07-10,10.0,imdb,The lighting choice really brought me back to each intended timeline in the movie
Mallari,16,3,pliant-moods,2024-07-10,10.0,imdb,"However, I'm disappointed with the postcolonialism story twist they chose--further capitalizing the story that precolonial practices are but witchcraft and therefore ""evil"""
Mallari,16,4,pliant-moods,2024-07-10,10.0,imdb,"The worst part is the reconstruction of an evil and murderous ""man of God"" to be a subject of Filipino witchcraft, deeming his act of murders as ""innocent"""
Mallari,16,5,pliant-moods,2024-07-10,10.0,imdb,These angles mean capitalizing on: 1
Mallari,16,6,pliant-moods,2024-07-10,10.0,imdb,The majority catholic population 2
Mallari,16,7,pliant-moods,2024-07-10,10.0,imdb,"Non-christian filipino practices are evil

This movie would have more credibility if more facts and research were done about Mallari"
Mallari,16,8,pliant-moods,2024-07-10,10.0,imdb,A true crime category would have been more fit
Mallari,16,9,pliant-moods,2024-07-10,10.0,imdb,"Irrespective, I think they should have stick to the fact that the priest was what he really was, a murderer and an evil man"
Mallari,16,10,pliant-moods,2024-07-10,10.0,imdb,Nothing justifies the terror he did
Mallari,17,1,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,Piolo carried this Horror Movie very well
Mallari,17,2,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,: They could have omitted the monster scene and the movie would have been perfect
Mallari,17,3,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,"The CGI was the only downside, good that there is only one scene"
Mallari,17,4,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,Piolo was a convincing psycho serial killer
Mallari,17,5,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,Awesome acting on his part considering he is playing multiple character
Mallari,17,6,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,There were a couple of Jumpscare that got me but it was the story that made me stay
Mallari,17,7,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,Cinematography was awesome
Mallari,17,8,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,"There were no scenes, that were too dark and the gore was just right, not too much and not too little"
Mallari,17,9,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,Love how they explained the timetravel aspect of the movie
Mallari,17,10,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,It wasn't too complicated but not to simple that would bore the audience
Mallari,17,11,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,The movie is something fresh
Mallari,17,12,paoloenad,2024-06-23,90.0,imdb,Horror movie fans should check it out
Mallari,18,1,thedwl,,140.0,ltbx,"The movie is okay, not giving too much expectations"

Mallari,22,2,soundfables,,160.0,ltbx,By no means am I saying that this movie is perfect but I think it’s a great start to challenge linear storytelling that’s been a longtime trend in the Philippine’s current world of filmography

Mallari,41,1,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,I gagged over twist after twist
Mallari,41,2,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,honestly one of the few Filipino horror/crime films I've actually liked in a long time
Mallari,41,3,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,"Cinematography, astral projection across different time periods, the concept, musical scoring is on point and impressive— all solid"
Mallari,41,4,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,The whole part about the family taking care of the sisiw or “maligno” added a really interesting layer
Mallari,41,5,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,John Rey tho
Mallari,41,6,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,I really feel so bad for him
Mallari,41,7,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,he's the only one who knows how to love someone properly
Mallari,41,8,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,"he sacrificed so much over the years, only to see it wasted again kasi tatanga tanga si Jonathan sa pag ibig"
Mallari,41,9,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,"ang selfish, kainis"
Mallari,41,10,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,The ending worked for me though
Mallari,41,11,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,It felt perfect for this coz it didn’t wrap everything neatly
Mallari,41,12,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,"Instead, it left the sense that the horror isn’t over, that more evil and chaos is just waiting to spill out"
Mallari,41,13,nrlnmk,,160.0,ltbx,"Overall, good film and way better than most PH horror"
Mallari,42,1,marukeruu,,100.0,ltbx,so the mallaris have the shine

Mallari,44,3,axe_lord,,140.0,ltbx,I felt that the astral projecting plot was a really cool idea that I haven't seen
Mallari,44,4,axe_lord,,140.0,ltbx,"While technically 'horror', the ghosts of the dead become so common that it loses its scare and just becomes a mystery movie"
Mallari,44,5,axe_lord,,140.0,ltbx,The ending was not what I would have liked but it was fine

Mallari,53,2,joellacabalu,,120.0,ltbx,"It’s a horror, but also based on a historical figure, with three timelines interweaving, but it’s also a sci-fi"
Mallari,53,3,joellacabalu,,120.0,ltbx,"And it’s also a love story, and a story of betrayal, and it has monsters and witchcraft and action"
Mallari,53,4,joellacabalu,,120.0,ltbx,I watched it with friends which made it more fun and bearable

Mallari,66,1,sielyn101,,200.0,ltbx,Anong ending 'yan
Mallari,67,1,cmbynfred,,140.0,ltbx,"A haunting mix of history, faith, and horror — Mallari stands out as one of the more ambitious local thrillers in recent years"
Mallari,67,2,cmbynfred,,140.0,ltbx,"Piolo Pascual delivers a chilling and layered performance that keeps you hooked, even when the story starts blurring the line between the supernatural and psychological"
Mallari,67,3,cmbynfred,,140.0,ltbx,"The film’s atmosphere is eerie and unsettling, with stunning cinematography that makes every shadow feel alive"
Mallari,67,4,cmbynfred,,140.0,ltbx,"It’s not perfect — the pacing dips at times, and some twists feel a bit too heavy-handed — but its ambition and emotion more than make up for it"
Mallari,67,5,cmbynfred,,140.0,ltbx,You can tell it’s a film made with vision and courage
Mallari,67,6,cmbynfred,,140.0,ltbx,"Mallari isn’t just a horror story; it’s a tragic reflection on guilt, faith, and the darkness that lingers inside us all"
Mallari,68,1,oliverous_,,80.0,ltbx,"The story had great potential, but the sloppy production and poor direction really let it down"
Mallari,68,2,oliverous_,,80.0,ltbx,Bakit naman gano’n yung dulo
Mallari,68,3,oliverous_,,80.0,ltbx,"Buti na lang, magaling si Papa P"
Mallari,69,1,lousol,,120.0,ltbx,jonathan and lucas were gay lovers
Mallari,70,1,seolaphori,,60.0,ltbx,hmmmmm papa p in different eras is a treat but the time travel concept for this real life murder story did not work for me :/ felt like the film was unnecessarily lengthy too
Mallari,71,1,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"The first time I watched this movie, I remember how scared I was, especially since I was watching it alone in my room at dawn"
Mallari,71,2,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"I didn’t finish it because I was too scared, and I only continued watching it in the morning"
Mallari,71,3,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"Honestly, the film was great when I first saw it"
Mallari,71,4,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"I was literally amazed by the cinematography—I mean, compared to other Filipino horror movies, the visuals here were on par with international films"
Mallari,71,5,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"The storyline was okay for me—not that outstanding, just okay"
Mallari,71,6,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"Now that I’ve rewatched it, I still find the visuals, production, and cinematography stunning"
Mallari,71,7,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"At some point, though, the film tried to do a lot of things; everything felt all over the place"
Mallari,71,8,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"Like, yeah, it’s trying everything but still gives nothing, which comes off a bit messy"
Mallari,71,9,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"I don’t know, this is just my honest opinion"
Mallari,71,10,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"For me, it could’ve been better if they focused more on the biography of Mallari rather than adding a touch of modernity to his story"
Mallari,71,11,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"Nevertheless, this film is a huge step up for the Philippine horror movie industry"
Mallari,71,12,kalbryne,,120.0,ltbx,"Not to mention, Piolo proved his versatility by portraying various characters in this film"
Mallari,72,1,drunksaba,,140.0,ltbx,pass sa mama's boy
Mallari,73,1,mattypd,,80.0,ltbx,This is a ghost/horror story based around the real story of a serial killer priest in the Philippines in the 1800s
Mallari,73,2,mattypd,,80.0,ltbx,I think this movie would’ve benefited greatly from focusing on that aspect rather than trying to build a modern day story around it
Mallari,73,3,mattypd,,80.0,ltbx,"The (very handsome) lead actor did a great job playing three different parts, I just think the actual horror story of the priest’s actions/motivations is a better story than the ghost stuff that carried us through to modern times"

Mallari,77,2,cashukey,,140.0,ltbx,The acting was outstanding—especially Lucas (JC)
Mallari,77,3,cashukey,,140.0,ltbx,"The intensity was insane, and I was genuinely scared by his portrayal, particularly his facial expressions"
Mallari,77,4,cashukey,,140.0,ltbx,"The scene where he and Jonathan (Piolo) were fighting was chilling, and Lucas’s eagerness to convince Jonathan to look for the sisiw—wow"
Mallari,77,5,cashukey,,140.0,ltbx,It’s no wonder he won Best Supporting Actor at that time
Mallari,77,6,cashukey,,140.0,ltbx,Piolo was also amazing

Mallari,156,8,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,Haunted house  BONUS: a scene set there with children scaring each other shitless that ends with a possession 3
Mallari,156,9,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"Jump scares galore unconvincingly shot through jump cuts, where a ghost either looks away from the camera or has a ""normal"" face then faces the camera with ghastly make up on accompanied by sudden jolt in the score 4"
Mallari,156,10,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"Shoehorned romance subplot as a shorthand for character motivation I can get behind these cliches if they're done well enough for me to still enjoy the movie, but I was disappointed with the lackluster script and the story structure, even early on before the reveal of the movie's supernatural bent"
Mallari,156,11,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"Mallari starts off interestingly, featuring the on-screen kill of a well-known Filipina actress in surprisingly gory detail"
Mallari,156,12,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"I honestly thought that this was going to be a straightforward slasher movie, something that is so rare in Filipino cinema, so maybe it's my fault for setting those expectations"
Mallari,156,13,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,We flash forward more than a century later with the descendant of the infamous Fr
Mallari,156,14,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"Severino Mallari, a doctor named Jonathan De Dios, both played by Piolo Pascual"
Mallari,156,15,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"Throughout the course of the movie, Jonathan encounters through dreams, astral projection and just plain old haunting another descendant nearer his bloodline, a war documentarian named Johnrey Mallari, also portrayed by Piolo Pascual"

Mallari,156,19,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,", in the scene after the first contemporary murder, the cops say they went to Jonathan first but we don't see that scene ever, which doesn't add to doubts about Jonathan's identity as the new iteration of the killer"
Mallari,156,20,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,The movie suffers from clunky dialogue throughout
Mallari,156,21,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,Character actions are written as actual speaking lines (there are a lot of expository and internal realizations spoken by the characters on their own in this movie)
Mallari,156,22,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"Despite the cast's best efforts in their line deliveries, some come off as unintentionally hilarious (like Janella Salvador's line, ""Bago ka umalis, doctor ka"

Mallari,156,26,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"Characters come and go as they please without establishing where they were in between scenes, which doesn't help if you want your audience to guess who's the one going around killing people (immediately after that first murder in the modern times, there's no doubt who it is), or if you want to establish some tension before a victim is dispatched (such was the case with Manang Mes, who is absent from the film until she was killed, only explained with a throwaway line from the cops)"
Mallari,156,27,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"There is one character who gets a little bit of background before getting killed off, but it leaves a sour taste because many of the surrounding characters say homophobic stuff (although that tracks for the world this is set in) and it also doesn't help that even that character's own lines didn't seem to be well thought of"
Mallari,156,28,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"However, it is the inclusion of the supernatural angle that made my head spin the most"

Mallari,156,37,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"Or using the concept of the aswang and Filipino folk beliefs as a scapegoat, which would have contrasted nicely with his status as an ordained Catholic priest"
Mallari,156,38,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,Or is the misdirect done to be more commercially pleasing
Mallari,156,39,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"Luckily, the folk horror parts of the story tie neatly until the end, but on top of the multigeneration arc, present-day investigation, and time travel subplots, Mallari already has too much on its plate"
Mallari,156,40,ervienflix,,80.0,ltbx,"The only things I could think of worth praising with Mallari are the production design, costumes and lighting for the parts set in 1812 and 1948 (it's obvious that the budget went there), Gloria Diaz's pitch perfect doña of the household, and the clever incorporation of Catholic iconography into the killings (St"

Mallari,178,4,misshemm,,100.0,ltbx,"The pacing is uneven, and the horror sequences feel predictable rather than spine-chilling, leaving much of the tension flat"
Mallari,178,5,misshemm,,100.0,ltbx,"Despite decent performances and atmospheric visuals, the movie struggles to build sustained suspense, relying on familiar tropes instead of innovative storytelling"

Mallari,200,1,komradeioseb,,140.0,ltbx,It dropped off hard nearer to the end
Mallari,201,1,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,"When Geto Suguru said ""At least curse me a little in the end"
Mallari,201,2,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,""" This wasn't what he meant"
Mallari,201,3,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,I have so much to say and I will
Mallari,201,4,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,"To put it mildly, it was disappointing"
Mallari,201,5,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,"It started off pretty good, who wouldn't be interested in a movie with a priest serial killer"
Mallari,201,6,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,"As the movie went on, it could've progressed in two ways"
Mallari,201,7,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,A horror movie that would terrify the audience out of their skin or an accurate depiction of the historical killings of Fr
Mallari,201,9,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,It went both ways and I mean that as an insult
Mallari,201,10,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,"It set up a beautiful potential for the movie to progress into, and then drove the movie into a lackluster fantasy"
Mallari,201,11,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,"The astral projection idea was good, had it been executed properly"
Mallari,201,12,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,"The writers were probably so proud of themselves for adding the manananggal ""plot twist"" if you can even call it that, they shouldn't be"
Mallari,201,13,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,It was like they were pilling all the possible plots in the world that the movie had become too ambitious for something they can't even achieve
Mallari,201,14,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,I just wish that they shouldn't've made this movie about Fr
Mallari,201,15,azeriaphale,,100.0,ltbx,"Mallari because that was real life, this was far from that"

Mallari,322,1,questopwatching,,120.0,ltbx,piolo’s face card saved this movie i fear
Mallari,324,1,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"Mallari is a rare offering in Philippine cinema, a genre piece that dares to excavate spiritual dread through a historical lens, delivering both psychological unease and cultural reflection with surprising sophistication"
Mallari,324,2,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"Inspired by true events, the film braids fact and fiction with eerie precision, conjuring a portrait of evil that is neither gratuitous nor shallow"
Mallari,324,3,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"It does not sensationalize its horror, but rather embeds it within the folds of human frailty, trauma and unspoken guilt"
Mallari,324,4,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"What emerges is a haunting exploration of generational sin: how belief systems, when warped by grief and power, can descend into darkness"
Mallari,324,5,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"Pascual commands the screen with a quiet, brooding intensity, shifting seamlessly across timelines and psyches"
Mallari,324,6,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"His performance anchors the film's ambitious structure, which traverses multiple epochs without losing thematic coherence"
Mallari,324,7,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"The supporting cast enriches the tapestry, though it is Pascual's psychological unraveling that most compellingly draws the viewer into Mallari's descent"
Mallari,324,8,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"The cinematography is meticulously composed, leveraging lighting and period detail to amplify atmosphere rather than overshadow it"
Mallari,324,9,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"There is enough restraint in the visual language, a refusal to rely on cheap thrills, that allows the dread to simmer rather than erupt"
Mallari,324,10,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"The score, too, underscores the unease without overwhelming the narrative, enhancing moments of revelation with quiet dread"
Mallari,324,11,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"Mallari is a meditation on guilt, belief, and the persistence of evil across generations"
Mallari,324,12,jmsurio_,,160.0,ltbx,"In summoning the ghosts of the past, it forces the viewers to confront the ones we still live with"

Mallari,343,1,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,I was really hyped for this one
Mallari,343,2,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"Like, really"
Mallari,343,3,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"I’ve spent hours researching Juan Severino Mallari myself — not even kidding, I know more about serial killers than I do about algebra"
Mallari,343,4,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,His story
Mallari,343,6,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,A priest who killed over 57 people just to try and heal his sick mother
Mallari,343,7,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"That’s the kind of dark, layered horror story I LIVE for"
Mallari,343,8,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,So when I found out there was a whole-ass movie about him
Mallari,343,9,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,I was on it
Mallari,343,10,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"I had that trailer play a few times, even YouTube e-mailed my ass and said, ""bitch, you gonna watch something else"
Mallari,343,11,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,""" But I remember being hyped to watch it tonight, and boy…This movie felt like homework"
Mallari,343,12,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"Long, bloated, and just a messy watch"
Mallari,343,13,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,They seriously took creative liberties with Mallari’s story — and not in a good way
Mallari,343,14,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"Like, that's not how his mother was treated, at all  And don’t even get me started on the VFX… I’ve seen better CGI on 2009 YouTube screamers"
Mallari,343,15,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,It gave unauthorized fan film with a budget
Mallari,343,16,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,What stings the most is how much potential it had
Mallari,343,17,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"They could’ve easily made a 90-minute slasher film set between 1816–1826, and it would've eaten"
Mallari,343,18,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"But instead, they threw in this confusing-ass time travel angle"
Mallari,343,19,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"Girl, be serious"
Mallari,343,20,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,And suddenly it’s supernatural
Mallari,343,21,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,No thanks
Mallari,343,22,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"The kills were predictable, mostly off-screen, and the rare on-screen ones were so over-the-top they looked fake"
Mallari,343,23,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"It felt like the director just watched Insidious once and said, ""Yeah, I can do that"
Mallari,343,24,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"""I will say — it tried to be interesting"
Mallari,343,25,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,But this felt like someone's first time making a horror film… and it showed
Mallari,343,26,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"If they stripped it back to its core — the madness, the religious guilt, the murders — it could’ve been powerful"
Mallari,343,27,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"Instead, it was a drag"
Mallari,343,28,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"A stylish, confused, occasionally interesting drag"
Mallari,343,29,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,My expectations were way too high
Mallari,343,30,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"I should’ve grabbed a glass with a beverage to carry my ass through, dimmed the lights, and lowered my standards"
Mallari,343,31,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"But meanwhile, the guy who played Severino Mallari"
Mallari,343,33,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"Like fine as hell, no debate"
Mallari,343,34,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"When he showed up on screen in that priest getup, I literally whispered, ""Hellooooo, fatherrrr…"" The man was serving murderous thirst trap and I was eating it up"
Mallari,343,35,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,But even that face card couldn’t save this mess of a movie
Mallari,343,36,ninetieslashers,,100.0,ltbx,"While it’s not terrible, it’s definitely not good either"

Mallari,448,4,miloouu,,120.0,ltbx,"Despite the film's weaknesses, the film's cast, especially Piolo Pascual, delivers a really strong performance and some of the time travel sequences where in Severino Mallari's descendants travel back in time to solve the mystery of the Mallari curse had me in the edge of my seat"

Mallari,457,1,ebbimae,,160.0,ltbx,"As an avid Filipino history lover, I did a lot of research on the real-life story of Fr"
Mallari,457,2,ebbimae,,160.0,ltbx,Severino Mallari when I was in 10th grade for our written essay in Filipino
Mallari,457,3,ebbimae,,160.0,ltbx,He was a 19th-century Catholic priest from Pampanga who was said to be the first recorded serial killer in the Philippines
Mallari,457,4,ebbimae,,160.0,ltbx,"He was reportedly mentally ill and murdered at least 57 people, believing that each death would help cure his ailing mother"
Mallari,457,5,ebbimae,,160.0,ltbx,He was eventually imprisoned and later executed by hanging
Mallari,457,6,ebbimae,,160.0,ltbx,His case is considered one of the earliest recorded instances of serial killing in the country — and yet it has been largely forgotten in mainstream Philippine history until recently
Mallari,457,7,ebbimae,,160.0,ltbx,"So when the movie Mallari was first aired, my older sister and I immediately watched it out of both curiosity and excitement to see how director Derick Cabrido would portray such a dark and complex figure on screen"
Mallari,457,8,ebbimae,,160.0,ltbx,"Although the movie adds a heavy layer of fiction — including themes of reincarnation, supernatural visions, and a futuristic timeline (which clearly didn't happen in real life) — it was still incredibly engaging to watch"
Mallari,457,9,ebbimae,,160.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual did an excellent job portraying three different characters across the film's distinct timelines
Mallari,457,10,ebbimae,,160.0,ltbx,"He carried the emotional and psychological weight of the role with such depth, especially in the scenes where guilt and madness were most apparent"
Mallari,458,1,qualityapeman,,140.0,ltbx,Almost great
Mallari,458,2,qualityapeman,,140.0,ltbx,The storyline is a really interesting time travelling horror mystery
Mallari,458,3,qualityapeman,,140.0,ltbx,"It can be a bit convoluted at times, but it's also incredibly ambitious and refreshing"
Mallari,458,4,qualityapeman,,140.0,ltbx,A tighter script would have helped tremendously
Mallari,458,5,qualityapeman,,140.0,ltbx,"Sadly, the film relies too much on cheap jump scares with poor digital effects, especially in its first half"

Mallari,692,1,lacymov,,120.0,ltbx,that one scene was so unnecessary imo
Mallari,693,1,notcvstx,,80.0,ltbx,the potential of this movie and they literally threw the plot away by making it a typical filipino horror movie
Mallari,694,1,dimsumpuppy,,140.0,ltbx,"Rough start but highkey if you stick with it, the story’s pretty compelling & I think uniquely tropically gothic in so many ways — chief among them the tendency to recycle intergenerational trauma in horrific, intertwined folktales across time"
Mallari,695,1,jololist,,120.0,ltbx,"dahil oo, ang tao ay kabuuan lamang ng pagkakamali nito"
Mallari,696,1,kitchienadoll,,120.0,ltbx,This was such a fresh and interesting concept because serial killers have always been a rare phenomenon in this country to begin with (thank god)
Mallari,696,2,kitchienadoll,,120.0,ltbx,I remember a subreddit i read saying that perhaps part of the reason why this isn’t really a “thing” here is because we had been preoccupied with survival that the thought of butchering someone never really occurred to our untapped minds lolThis film was ambitious and I like how they went the extra mile to incorporate folklore and science fiction into this but unf the appeal of these elements didn’t quite translate as strongly as I had hoped
Mallari,696,3,kitchienadoll,,120.0,ltbx,"If anything, I think this just made the story and timeline a bit convoluted—time travel and all"
Mallari,696,4,kitchienadoll,,120.0,ltbx,"Nonetheless, this was a decent watch, with Piolo’s performance being the film’s driving spirit"

Mallari,730,2,erofebsunrise,,120.0,ltbx,Piolo so pogi tho
Mallari,731,1,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"A Beautifully Shot, But Clunky and Overstuffed Horror AttemptI watched Mallari out of curiosity, intrigued by its premise and the promise of psychological horror—my favorite genre"
Mallari,731,2,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"My partner and I decided to give it a go, and while there were some strong points, the film ultimately felt like a wasted opportunity"
Mallari,731,3,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"The Good: • The cinematography, color grading, and framing choices were stunning"
Mallari,731,4,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"Certain scenes had a distinct, almost painterly quality that added to the film’s eerie atmosphere"
Mallari,731,5,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"• Piolo Pascual delivered a solid performance, effectively portraying three different characters despite criticisms that he was just “playing himself in three fonts"
Mallari,731,6,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,” • JC Santos completely stole the show in his final scenes
Mallari,731,7,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,His performance was so gripping that I found myself thinking he might have been a better fit for Juan Severino Mallari
Mallari,731,8,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,The Bad:1
Mallari,731,9,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"Repetitive and Meaningless Scares • The eyeless souls were unsettling at first, but after the third time, they felt like cheap filler rather than an effective horror element"
Mallari,731,10,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,• The film never explains why the souls are trapped in the house when they were murdered elsewhere
Mallari,731,11,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,• The scene with the children breaking into the house felt unnecessary—what was its purpose
Mallari,731,13,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"A Confused, Overstuffed Narrative • The film tries to be everything at once—supernatural horror, historical thriller, cult mystery, and even a time-travel story—but ends up feeling like a jumbled mess"
Mallari,731,14,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,• Juan Severino Mallari was a real historical figure—the first recorded Filipino serial killer
Mallari,731,15,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"Instead of leaning into historical horror and exploring corruption within the colonial church (which would have been a logical reason for how he got away with 57 murders), the film adds a convoluted subplot about a cult of witches raising a supernatural “sisiw” entity"
Mallari,731,16,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,• The cult’s motivations are unclear—do they want immortality
Mallari,731,17,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,Revenge against the ruling class
Mallari,731,19,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,It’s never explained
Mallari,731,20,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,They just need a vessel for the sisiw… so they can take care of it
Mallari,731,21,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,• There was already enough real-life material to craft a compelling 1800s storyline without forcing in aswang elements and cults
Mallari,731,22,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"Instead, the film almost seems to justify Mallari’s killings, framing him as a tragic figure rather than a murderer"
Mallari,731,24,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"Inconsistent Character Writing and Awkward Shifts • Gloria Diaz’s character starts as an abusive, religiously fanatical noblewoman, hinting at her darker tendencies"
Mallari,731,25,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"But midway through the film, she’s suddenly framed as an innocent victim"
Mallari,731,26,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"This abrupt shift feels forced, as if the filmmakers changed their minds halfway through"
Mallari,731,27,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,• The CGI transformation scene (especially the “Gollum” filter on Gloria Diaz) was jarring and unconvincing
Mallari,731,28,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,• Johnrey turning into a werewolf after taking the sisiw was the moment I officially gave up trying to rationalize anything in the film
Mallari,731,29,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"At that point, I just thought, Okay sure, do whatever, it’s your movie"
Mallari,731,30,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"• Then they introduced time travel through astral projection, which ultimately did nothing to resolve the story’s core conflicts"
Mallari,731,32,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,Forced and Cringe-Worthy Romance • The relationship between Jonathan (Piolo Pascual) and Agnes (Janella Salvador) had zero chemistry
Mallari,731,33,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"• Agnes, despite being introduced as an intelligent doctor, was completely one-dimensional"
Mallari,731,34,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,"Her dialogue felt forced and unnatural, which wasn’t helped by Janella’s flat performance"
Mallari,731,35,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,• The romance subplot added nothing to the film
Mallari,731,36,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,Jonathan could have uncovered his family’s dark history on his own without a love interest tagging along
Mallari,731,37,redbricksweater,,100.0,ltbx,• The worst moment was Agnes’ final line: “Bilog na naman ang buwan… magugutom ako mamaya

Mallari,853,4,siegfred7,,60.0,ltbx,"the slasher element was so ugly, no thrill at alll, he slash like her mother hitting his butt when he did something terrible, also those repetitive scene, was not a good idea, i hate that"
Mallari,853,5,siegfred7,,60.0,ltbx,this could've better if it fully served as crime/thriller or suspense/thriller and not as a horror
Mallari,853,6,siegfred7,,60.0,ltbx,"the killing spree was decent, at least it has blood on their faces"
Mallari,853,7,siegfred7,,60.0,ltbx,"that bloodline was a good concept, but sadly it was executed poorly, oh they try to do multiverse of madness too, and guess what they're twinning, MoM sucks but this sucks even more harder"
Mallari,853,8,siegfred7,,60.0,ltbx,"also the make up/prosthetics on the freaks look so fake, and the cgi on manananggal sucks, a mess indeed"
Mallari,853,9,siegfred7,,60.0,ltbx,"love Piolo's dedication on the job, its good, so is the rest too"

Mallari,877,2,alexyoken,,140.0,ltbx,Once the plot stops fucking around and opens up its structure and elements it's an entertainingly scrappy synthesis/chimera of premises that don't exactly make too much of a sense but with the atmosphere so heightened you kinda have to sorta take it on face value
Mallari,877,3,alexyoken,,140.0,ltbx,"Rewards you with a lot of the thoughtless anarchy you're hoping for in a set up like this, and for each scene that exposes the seams in the narrative thread, comes another so ridiculous that it made me forgive those flaws for it's modest ambition to baffle"

Mallari,883,2,redsanrangan,,100.0,ltbx,"Mallari is basically a movie about social inequality and the systemic poverty that pushes people into doing the extreme and how the more fortunate would exploit this to further their means or it's simply a movie about ghosts, either way it's just okay"
Mallari,883,3,redsanrangan,,100.0,ltbx,It didn't really serve any groundbreaking social critique nor was it particularly scary (coming from a scaredy-cat)
Mallari,883,4,redsanrangan,,100.0,ltbx,"With a 2 hour duration, this was at least engaging though not as interesting as the real life story"

Mallari,899,1,ariecu,,60.0,ltbx,"wanted to like this so much more… definitely moments in there I appreciated but the plot was too overstuffed (witches, time traveling, astral projecting, copycat killer, soapy romance) for me to find the focus here"

Mallari,900,4,aldrinvzenki,,180.0,ltbx,"As a casual moviegoer, I usually dislike movies that bombard me with questions in every scene and leave me hanging until the very end"

Mallari,900,8,aldrinvzenki,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s proof that you can make a suspense/thriller/horror film na hindi ka nakakunot noo mo habang nanonood kasi halos wala ka nang maaninag—unlike that movie (yes, I’m looking at you, Deleter) where everyone might as well have been silhouettes in the dark - even after 2 years di pa rin ako maka-move on talaga"

Mallari,925,2,yaniebravo,,60.0,ltbx,The concept had so much potential—how could you go wrong with the story of the first parish priest turned serial killer
Mallari,925,3,yaniebravo,,60.0,ltbx,"It’s such a compelling idea, and the plot could’ve carried itself without unnecessary additions"
Mallari,925,4,yaniebravo,,60.0,ltbx,"But instead of sticking to the suspense and thriller elements, they shoehorned in the whole “aswang” angle, which felt completely unnecessary and poorly executed"
Mallari,925,5,yaniebravo,,60.0,ltbx,"Horror like this, especially in Philippine cinema, needs to be done with care, and unfortunately, this just missed the mark"
Mallari,925,6,yaniebravo,,60.0,ltbx,"I had high hopes because of Piolo Pascual and Janella Salvador, but the film devolved into a melodrama instead of leaning into the dark, gripping thriller it was supposed to be"

Mallari,976,2,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,I was expecting a crime thriller/period drama
Mallari,976,3,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,I would even have settled for a slasher film
Mallari,976,4,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,Instead I got a supernatural folk horror

Mallari,976,6,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,"Even as a horror film, it's still bad"
Mallari,976,7,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,The plot is convoluted
Mallari,976,8,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,The dialogue is cringey
Mallari,976,9,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,The jumpscares are cheap and randomly inserted throughout the movie
Mallari,976,10,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,The only redeeming factor is JC Santos' acting
Mallari,976,11,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,He was acting like he had top billing
Mallari,976,12,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,"Overall, Mallari is a hot mess"
Mallari,976,13,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,"Hopefully someday, someone more capable can tell the story of the serial killer through film"
Mallari,976,14,themichaelcarlo,,80.0,ltbx,Maybe JC Santos could even play the serial murderer

Mallari,1007,1,jxrad,,100.0,ltbx,It was good until the over the top supernatural stuff
Mallari,1008,1,otsotso,,80.0,ltbx,Quite disappointed
Mallari,1008,2,otsotso,,80.0,ltbx,It was partly my fault for expecting that this movie would focus on the serial killer aspect and push that horror genre (maybe crime too) but it never really did any of the sort
Mallari,1008,3,otsotso,,80.0,ltbx,"It has jumps scares, which at first, when you barely have any information about the movie is slightly effective"
Mallari,1008,4,otsotso,,80.0,ltbx,"However, those jump scares are just that, a jump scare and it does not lead into anything"
Mallari,1008,5,otsotso,,80.0,ltbx,I expected more
Mallari,1008,6,otsotso,,80.0,ltbx,"Half-way through the movie, when sufficient information have been given to clue you in on the direction it wants to take, it gradually lost its lustre"
Mallari,1008,7,otsotso,,80.0,ltbx,"By then, it focused a lot on the supernatural and the ideas within the film began to feel too much"
Mallari,1008,8,otsotso,,80.0,ltbx,"Some of the ideas were interesting, and some of them were straight up dumb"
Mallari,1008,9,otsotso,,80.0,ltbx,Which definitely impacted how scary this movie could have been
Mallari,1008,10,otsotso,,80.0,ltbx,"Good thing though, the production is excellent and Janella Salvador is in it"

Mallari,1022,1,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"*long review & slight spoilers ahead* ""Mallari"" (2023) had the potential to be a compelling film, but unfortunately, it fell short of expectations"
Mallari,1022,2,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"The plot felt disjointed and rushed, with certain plot points (such as the astral projection and the curse) introduced abruptly and without proper development"
Mallari,1022,3,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"The narrative suffered from trying to do too much (shocking considering the runtime), ultimately deviating from what could have been a more focused and impactful story"
Mallari,1022,4,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"While the film attempted to address the theme of mental health in the context of religious influence, it missed the opportunity to delve deeper into this complex issue"
Mallari,1022,5,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"Instead, it resorted to familiar Filipino horror tropes, relying on excessive ""fear factor"", predictable and unnecessary jump-scare placements, and plot twists that detracted from the overall narrative"
Mallari,1022,6,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"I wish they could have possibly explored the Marxist perspective on the use of black magic as a form of resistance by the oppressed class against the ruling class, instead of just completely antagonizing/demonizing the workers of the Mallari family"
Mallari,1022,7,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"One redeeming aspect of the film was its cinematography and color grading, which were visually striking and well-executed"
Mallari,1022,8,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"However, the technical merits couldn't salvage the film's shortcomings in storytelling and thematic exploration"
Mallari,1022,9,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"""Mallari"" could have been a powerful commentary on the historical and social context of mental health in the Philippines"
Mallari,1022,10,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"Instead, it became a fictionalized account that missed the opportunity to engage with more profound and meaningful themes"
Mallari,1022,11,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"I can’t help but have a sour taste on my mouth given that we live in a political climate where history is being distorted, and where this film got its inspiration from is still a piece of history"
Mallari,1022,12,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,"Overall, ""Mallari"" is a film with unrealized potential"
Mallari,1022,13,migseu,,80.0,ltbx,Its narrative flaws and heavy reliance on genre conventions overshadow its technical achievements and prevent it from being a truly impactful narrative

Mallari,1061,11,pancakeiku,,40.0,ltbx,"Didi's scene is deeply problematic, as it presents a portrayal that is highly discriminatory, particularly from the perspective of societal norms and, more pointedly, the Church's viewpointThe film's departure from its historical premise is both baffling and disappointing"

Mallari,1191,2,iluvel,,160.0,ltbx,Filipino filmmaking really improved a lot in terms of storytelling and cinematography regardless of its reference
Mallari,1191,3,iluvel,,160.0,ltbx,The mystery behind through different timelines intertwining revealing time travel scenarios is pure genius and superb screenwriting
Mallari,1191,4,iluvel,,160.0,ltbx,Bringing folklore tales to the table is somewhat forced yet they properly execute the story
Mallari,1191,5,iluvel,,160.0,ltbx,"Perfect casting, hence piolo pascual's performance is exceptional"

Mallari,1193,6,jekkuencha,,120.0,ltbx,Medyo na turn off lang ako sa manananggal na plot

Mallari,1194,1,themiggynator,,120.0,ltbx,"I'm so left behind with this, however, I must say that Mallari wasn't as bad as I thought"
Mallari,1194,2,themiggynator,,120.0,ltbx,"Sure, I expected more but for someone who barely set high expectations on Filipino films, I enjoyed this one"
Mallari,1194,3,themiggynator,,120.0,ltbx,Cinematography was okay so was the production design
Mallari,1194,4,themiggynator,,120.0,ltbx,Performances were fairly decent
Mallari,1194,5,themiggynator,,120.0,ltbx,I thought Piolo Pascual did good playing multiple characters
Mallari,1194,6,themiggynator,,120.0,ltbx,"I'm not familiar with the origin story, but it sucks that this involved witchcraft and a manananggal"
Mallari,1194,7,themiggynator,,120.0,ltbx,Could've been nice if it's a straight up serial killer story
Mallari,1194,8,themiggynator,,120.0,ltbx,I also didn't like the editing of this
Mallari,1194,9,themiggynator,,120.0,ltbx,There are scenes that shouldn't be there
Mallari,1194,10,themiggynator,,120.0,ltbx,Scenes that didn't make sense and should've just been cut
Mallari,1194,11,themiggynator,,120.0,ltbx,"Anyway, I guess the fight for the best modern serial killer Filipino film is still on"

Mallari,1198,2,lncrxv,,140.0,ltbx,"surprisingly, the time jumps and the storyline worked well enough for me"
Mallari,1198,3,lncrxv,,140.0,ltbx,"this is already an improvement in the pinoy horror genre, but it was lacking in the final act that could have made this a solid four"

Mallari,1206,1,carizzajanine,,80.0,ltbx,it is very true that papa p really exudes the kind of sensuality that lacks from today’s crop of actors but to see it wasted on a film that’s so disjointed and fragmented
Mallari,1206,2,carizzajanine,,80.0,ltbx,"fragments always work best when the emotions are wielded properly, it gives us something potent"
Mallari,1206,3,carizzajanine,,80.0,ltbx,there’s something interesting at the core of the mallari men but much of the complexities im looking for are lost
Mallari,1206,4,carizzajanine,,80.0,ltbx,the horrors turn less of a medium and used more as a cheap trick
Mallari,1206,5,carizzajanine,,80.0,ltbx,but at least the sensuality is wielded well for a crowd looking for papa p in different kinky roles

Mallari,1306,2,nobing,,160.0,ltbx,"First off, Piolo Pascual was phenomenal"
Mallari,1306,3,nobing,,160.0,ltbx,"I mean, I've always known he's a great actor, but in Mallari, na wow-an jd kos iyang performance"
Mallari,1306,4,nobing,,160.0,ltbx,Watching him play different characters in one movie was just
Mallari,1306,5,nobing,,160.0,ltbx,something else
Mallari,1306,6,nobing,,160.0,ltbx,My exact thoughts after watching the movie
Mallari,1306,7,nobing,,160.0,ltbx,"Yawa ka, Jonathan"
Mallari,1306,8,nobing,,160.0,ltbx,"Seriouslyyyy, his character was maddening in the best way possible"
Mallari,1306,9,nobing,,160.0,ltbx,"Like I hate him, but I can't look away"
Mallari,1306,10,nobing,,160.0,ltbx,I enjoyed this movie overall (na stress)
Mallari,1307,1,sueysitta,,140.0,ltbx,whatever happened to ending generational trauma
Mallari,1308,1,maifartsstinky,,100.0,ltbx,the real curse was love so moral of the story wag kayo magmahal
Mallari,1309,1,temperinferno69,,120.0,ltbx,The film is a reflection of the colonial period while also reinterpreting modern themes in order to bridge generations of Philippine history
Mallari,1309,2,temperinferno69,,120.0,ltbx,It was also a critique of the religious structures that enable persecution and violence to continue towards the marginalized
Mallari,1309,3,temperinferno69,,120.0,ltbx,The film's ending is basically an evil one where the main character wants to continue the very same violence that his ancestors warned him of in pursuit of love
Mallari,1309,4,temperinferno69,,120.0,ltbx,I think another theme is about the masculine savior complex…
Mallari,1310,1,bachingchung,,80.0,ltbx,Bad rhytm
Mallari,1311,1,thonymb,,140.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual what a DILF

Mallari,1316,1,jujihua,,100.0,ltbx,nicee moviee
Mallari,1316,2,jujihua,,100.0,ltbx,"i like how they slowly put details on every scene & repeating it so that we can understand what is the context, but sadly the ending wasn’t just so enough for the viewers like me  however, there are similar things that actually happen irl, like love is blind talaga, u cant stop urself for doing such things that either can be beneficial to a specific person and disadvantageous to others"
Mallari,1317,1,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,= Spooktober Film No
Mallari,1317,2,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,"2  =No'ng lumabas trailer nito last year, gustong-gusto ko siya panoorin"
Mallari,1317,3,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,"Ang ganda kasi ng plot, at mahilig ako sa mga horror set in ancient times"
Mallari,1317,4,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,"But having watched it today, super na-disappoint ako"
Mallari,1317,5,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Sayang kasi e
Mallari,1317,6,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,"Nando'n 'yong potential to be the best horror released in a while, pero wala e, sinayang"
Mallari,1317,7,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Ay pa'no ba naman sadyang napakagulo ng kuwento
Mallari,1317,8,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,"Hindi mo maintindihan kung ano ba talagang gusto nitong gawin, ano ba gusto nitong sabihin"
Mallari,1317,9,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,"Hindi naman 'to 'yong tipo ng pelikula na may deep meaning at hindi madaling intindihin, pero heto't 'di pa rin maintindihan"
Mallari,1317,10,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Daig pa nito jowa mo sa sobrang dami ng mood swings
Mallari,1317,11,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Tapos lipat-balik pa ang gimik ng naratibo
Mallari,1317,12,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Paulit-ulit binabalikan at ine-explain ang mga pangyayari kahit obvious naman na
Mallari,1317,13,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Buti sana kung may naidadagdag sa kuwento e
Mallari,1317,14,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Pinahaba lang tapos bibigyan tayo ng lintek sa pangit na conclusion
Mallari,1317,15,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Masyadong naging ambisyoso ang pelikula na 'to
Mallari,1317,16,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Napakaraming gustong mangyari
Mallari,1317,17,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,"Napakaraming unnecessary na dinagdag para magkaroon ng ""WOW, I'M CONFUSED THIS MUST BE GOOD"" effect sa manonood"
Mallari,1317,18,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Akala ata effective
Mallari,1317,19,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Daig pa nito Dingdong mixed nuts sa sobrang mixed bag
Mallari,1317,20,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,"Ang pinagkaiba nga lang, mas masarap 'yong Dingdong"
Mallari,1317,21,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Hindi ko rin bet 'yong special filter na ginamit
Mallari,1317,22,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Napaka-unnatural tignan
Mallari,1317,23,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Hindi ko 'to kayang seryosohin no'ng una kasi parang sobrang obvious na pelikula lang siya
Mallari,1317,24,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Tipong walang effort na paniwalain tayo na totoo 'yong mga nangyayari (kahit na based on true story siya)
Mallari,1317,25,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Mas nagmukha 'tong comedy horror
Mallari,1317,26,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Sino ba namang hindi matatawa kung gano'n ka-cringe ang script
Mallari,1317,27,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Ipinilit pa ang GenZ slang kahit hindi akma
Mallari,1317,28,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Wala chemistry si Piolo at Janella
Mallari,1317,29,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Super cringe ng scenes nila
Mallari,1317,30,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Isa pa 'yong saksakan scenes halatang ang layo
Mallari,1317,31,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Nakailang taga na buhay pa rin
Mallari,1317,32,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Sa 57 na tao na pinatay ni Fr
Mallari,1317,33,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,"Mallari, iisipin mo expert na siya manaksak pero hindi pa rin pala"
Mallari,1317,34,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,O baka mapurol lang 'yong itak
Mallari,1317,35,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Ginawa niya 'tong career pero 'di siya nag-invest sa equipment
Mallari,1317,36,hanajoyb,,40.0,ltbx,Super wrong
Mallari,1318,1,juliewatches,,80.0,ltbx,good concept but overwhelming in a bad way
Mallari,1319,1,wakenziee,,160.0,ltbx,Puta so sayang lang ginawa ni John Rey jusq
Mallari,1320,1,giopuyat,,80.0,ltbx,"I still got to hand it to a local filmmaker putting concepts like astral travel, filipino folklore and cult horror into an MMFF film"
Mallari,1320,2,giopuyat,,80.0,ltbx,The intent was there and that's progress for me
Mallari,1320,3,giopuyat,,80.0,ltbx,But execution was way off
Mallari,1320,4,giopuyat,,80.0,ltbx,It failed in the one thing horror movies should do: establish mood
Mallari,1320,5,giopuyat,,80.0,ltbx,It immediately started with jump scares so random it felt like a carnival horror ride the whole time
Mallari,1320,6,giopuyat,,80.0,ltbx,Also Piolo's makeup and fake beards were laughably bad
Mallari,1320,7,giopuyat,,80.0,ltbx,Did all the budget go into the Gloria Diaz manananggal scene
Mallari,1320,8,giopuyat,,80.0,ltbx,That was pretty fun though
Mallari,1321,1,mfbgarcia,,100.0,ltbx,"Contrary to popular opinion, I find it good"
Mallari,1321,2,mfbgarcia,,100.0,ltbx,It gave me chills because it was based on a true to life story coupled with a bit of fiction
Mallari,1321,3,mfbgarcia,,100.0,ltbx,Had a very bad graphics tho
Mallari,1321,4,mfbgarcia,,100.0,ltbx,The “aswang” twist was unnecessary
Mallari,1322,1,jenjenjenjeeeen,,140.0,ltbx,I watched it last year with my Mom
Mallari,1322,2,jenjenjenjeeeen,,140.0,ltbx,I kid you not she fell asleep from half of the movie
Mallari,1322,3,jenjenjenjeeeen,,140.0,ltbx,I love Janella

Mallari,1325,1,rawrzamyrrh,,140.0,ltbx,took me a lot of courage tomwatch it and it was actually good
Mallari,1326,1,sayakasaeki,,120.0,ltbx,god there are so many things that could've been done better to make this movie perfect but instead they did that
Mallari,1326,2,sayakasaeki,,120.0,ltbx,"imagine fumbling such compelling film material (the first serial killer in the ph being a priest), makes me hope they create more film(s) in the future using this subject exploring different directions, maybe focusing on a realistic crime/thriller perspective, or maybe another mythical horror but done better"
Mallari,1326,3,sayakasaeki,,120.0,ltbx,also tawang tawa ako sa mga review under this movie bwiset anong pasahan ng sisiw reunion
Mallari,1327,1,_zemonreviews,,100.0,ltbx,"i mean, maganda sana yung plot, panget lang yung story telling"
Mallari,1328,1,jegwii,,140.0,ltbx,It's okay
Mallari,1328,2,jegwii,,140.0,ltbx,Interesting naman yung story though sana hindi nito ma-justify yung killings na ginawa ni Fr
Mallari,1329,1,moshihanju,,180.0,ltbx,4 points para kay paolo

Mallari,1334,5,shanebernal,,200.0,ltbx,"IF THEY COULD HIRE A TOP-TIER VFX ARTIST TO PERFECT THE ANIMATION, IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE REALISTIC"
Mallari,1334,6,shanebernal,,200.0,ltbx,"OVERALL, I AM BEYOND SATISFIED WITH THE LEVEL OF SUSPENSE DELIVERED BY THIS FILM"

Mallari,1335,5,p0tatochi,,120.0,ltbx,haha siguro sana ginawa nalang na loosely based kay severino mallari (or yung idea of a killer priest) at hindi si mallari mismo

Mallari,1338,1,wyntermelon,,120.0,ltbx,i don't know why but it leaves a very bad taste in my mouth that the first victim in the modern age is a queer sex-worker
Mallari,1338,2,wyntermelon,,120.0,ltbx,"gets na yung victims are bad people but why choose the background of that character to be a queer sex-worker, like it's definitely a choice"
Mallari,1338,3,wyntermelon,,120.0,ltbx,"overall, ang galing ng performances from all around especially piolo and jc (lalo na si jc, dasurv talga best supporting actor)"
Mallari,1338,4,wyntermelon,,120.0,ltbx,pero parang kulang pa for me yung story
Mallari,1340,1,ramenpax,,60.0,ltbx,i was stoned when i watched this so i was pretty much amused all the way through
Mallari,1340,2,ramenpax,,60.0,ltbx,i was laughing through the scares while tripping balls and imagining myself on a rollercoaster that i once went on
Mallari,1340,3,ramenpax,,60.0,ltbx,i barely know anything (as of right now) about the Mallari family
Mallari,1340,4,ramenpax,,60.0,ltbx,"i don’t even know how i exactly feel about making fiction about a real life tragedy, let alone into a horror-thriller-soap-drama-comedy cacophony"

Mallari,1345,3,catsoupp,,80.0,ltbx,The concept of a Filipino serial killer priest predating Jack the Ripper was already interesting enough
Mallari,1345,4,catsoupp,,80.0,ltbx,"I feel like whatever existing historical accounts already gave enough room for exploration without having to reach for mananggals, wolves, and time traveling oh my"
Mallari,1345,5,catsoupp,,80.0,ltbx,I’m not even going to touch the implication that trans persons or prostitutes come under the heading of “masasamang tao”

Mallari,1356,11,lemonadefreckle,,80.0,ltbx,I think it was cool they had the actor play 3 roles
Mallari,1356,12,lemonadefreckle,,80.0,ltbx,Some of the lines/acting was cheesy
Mallari,1356,13,lemonadefreckle,,80.0,ltbx,maybe it’s the translation

Mallari,1391,1,oxxen,,80.0,ltbx,CONS:Stiff acting ni Papa P (maliban dun sa dulo nung pinapakain na niya kay Janella Salvador yung sisiw dun sa pinugutan niya)
Mallari,1391,2,oxxen,,80.0,ltbx,Hindi ko alam pero parang dun lang sa eksena na yun nagpakita ng mahusay na acting chops si Papa P
Mallari,1391,3,oxxen,,80.0,ltbx,"Pangit din writing dahil sa mga exposition dumps ng mga karakter nila Carlo, mga kasambahay sa bahay ni Severino, at mga Mallari boys ni Papa P mismo"
Mallari,1391,4,oxxen,,80.0,ltbx,Wala akong paki tuloy nung nagddrama na mga characters nila dahil hindi ko sinasabayan yung progression ng istorya habang nageexposition dump sila ng walang ka dating-dating

Mallari,1391,6,oxxen,,80.0,ltbx,Hindi ako expert sa costume design at sa time period na sinusubukan nilang i-visualize sa pelikulang ito pero believable naman ang sets at costumes sa uneducated kong mga mata
Mallari,1391,7,oxxen,,80.0,ltbx,"Lastly, trip ko yung ideya ng istorya na gawing backdrop ang ibat-ibang time period sa kasaysayan ng Pinas"
Mallari,1391,8,oxxen,,80.0,ltbx,Naalala ko yung ginawa ni Park Chan-wook sa The Handmaiden
Mallari,1391,9,oxxen,,80.0,ltbx,"Kung yung pelikula na yun ay nagpapakita ng mastery sa storytelling through film sa pamamaraan ng eye-catching yet purposeful camera tricks, realistic performances, at subtle but poignant writing, etong Mallari naman ay nagpakita ng amateur na version in comparison"

Mallari,1427,1,opinionkolangah,,200.0,ltbx,I love that this horror film is anchored on real historical events
Mallari,1427,2,opinionkolangah,,200.0,ltbx,"Mostly kasi ng ganitong type of horror films, foreign"
Mallari,1427,3,opinionkolangah,,200.0,ltbx,Ang ganda lang na this time Filipino naman
Mallari,1427,4,opinionkolangah,,200.0,ltbx,"Nagtataka nga ako, on why do scriptwriters don't encorporate historical events much sa gawa nila, eh ang interesting kaya ng history ng Philippines"
Mallari,1428,1,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,The film kind of reminds me weirdly enough of something like Psycho 3
Mallari,1428,2,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"A competent film with a bit more to say than the last, but definitely not enough to feel like a worthwhile experience"
Mallari,1428,3,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"Because, there have been quite a few films similar to this over the past few decades"
Mallari,1428,4,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"Films like Mike de Leon's Itim, Erik Matti's Seklusyon, Rico Maria Ilarde's Altar"
Mallari,1428,5,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"These films have fascinating explorations on the difficult truths of a nation's collective past, on the definition of the family unit, and about the melding of religion on the Filipino's consciousness"
Mallari,1428,6,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"On paper, Mallari has all three in spades"
Mallari,1428,7,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"But, it also has the disadvantage of having a conflated story with very little to say once everything has transpired"
Mallari,1428,8,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"I usually enjoy pointless genre films like those from Eddie Romero, but this one takes itself so seriously"
Mallari,1428,9,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,Too seriously
Mallari,1428,10,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"I couldn't bring myself to take any of what I saw seriously, because there was nothing really thought provoking being forwarded"
Mallari,1428,11,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"Yet, the film seems to act like it has something really impressive to say like M"
Mallari,1428,12,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,Night Shyamalan wrote it
Mallari,1428,13,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"It shows a lot of punch with its special effects, but nothing underneath all the bells and whistles"
Mallari,1428,14,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,A lot of the scenes felt particularly stagy and stilted
Mallari,1428,15,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,Seeing Piolo Pascual swallowing that cursed gastropod thing did nothing for me
Mallari,1428,16,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,And more baffling than that is this obnoxious musical score and sound design
Mallari,1428,17,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"It really takes you out of the narrative, which wasn't particularly absorbing in the first place"
Mallari,1428,18,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"Personally, the very first time I had a mania for films was when I was a kid sifting through tons of horror classics"
Mallari,1428,19,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"I remember falling in love with Tod Browning's Freaks, Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and bawling over William Friedkin's The Exorcist"
Mallari,1428,20,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,I always felt that horror gave the biggest thrill and the most exuberant high of any genre
Mallari,1428,21,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"But, I feel myself more and more disappointed the further along I see from a genre that holds a lot of sentimental value for me"
Mallari,1428,22,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,"Overall, Mallari feels more like a half-baked cool idea for historical fiction combining a spiritual, sci-fi element with a scary real life figure, as opposed to a compelling drama of genuine, purposive scares to bring something meaningful on what it's based on"
Mallari,1428,23,pooploverz69,,60.0,ltbx,The film is terribly forgettable

Mallari,1625,1,adv00_,,80.0,ltbx,first filipino serial killer pala c abraham lincoln
Mallari,1626,1,lunafleurette,,100.0,ltbx,they had a promising idea to explore (the philippines' first serial killer) but the execution left much to be desired
Mallari,1626,2,lunafleurette,,100.0,ltbx,lost the thread when they decided to overcomplicate things with a kitchen sink of supernatural elements
Mallari,1626,3,lunafleurette,,100.0,ltbx,"manananggal and aswang, fine"
Mallari,1626,4,lunafleurette,,100.0,ltbx,then you included astral projection and time travel and the focus was no longer on the story of the serial killer priest the title is named for
Mallari,1626,5,lunafleurette,,100.0,ltbx,"like, why"
Mallari,1626,6,lunafleurette,,100.0,ltbx,piolo pascual showed great acting chops and the sound + set + costume designs were nice
Mallari,1626,7,lunafleurette,,100.0,ltbx,the jumpscares felt cheap
Mallari,1626,8,lunafleurette,,100.0,ltbx,overall it feels rather disappointing
Mallari,1627,1,felicioso,,120.0,ltbx,the writing was peak
Mallari,1627,2,felicioso,,120.0,ltbx,could've taken its place as one of the best Filipino films if not for the cheap jumpscares and poor execution of scenes
Mallari,1627,3,felicioso,,120.0,ltbx,still a pretty solid movie tho
Mallari,1628,1,kkurafilm,,200.0,ltbx,"honestly, it’s an amalgamation of popular western horror films but they did make the plot work surprisingly"
Mallari,1628,2,kkurafilm,,200.0,ltbx,"also, modern filipino horror films are so bad but i think this is finally a step on the right direction"

Mallari,1636,2,mandycakes20,,180.0,ltbx,"our culture provides so many interesting concepts for horror films; pinoy mythical creatures and pamahiins, and although there's plenty of old films that had already used those concepts, it will still be a huge hit especially with modern cinematography"

Mallari,1641,2,rinoahk,,120.0,ltbx,me asf: goodnight that one scene where severino came back to the house calling nieves after his first kill
Mallari,1642,1,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"Welp, I sure hope no Philippine moviegoers mistook this for the more inspiring Piolo Pascual biopic on a subversive priest during Spanish occupation"
Mallari,1642,2,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"It sounds like ""GomBurZa"" is a more profitable Christmas release than I thought, but all other Mallaris can take comfort in this being about distancing from that name"
Mallari,1642,3,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"In the 1810s, Juan Severino Mallari seems to be a perfectly decent priest in Magalang, until he discovers that a cult got a hold of his mother"
Mallari,1642,4,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,He saves her soul by taking on a double-life as a serial killer whose moralistic slayings throw the town into turmoil
Mallari,1642,5,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"Over a century later, amid the Hukbalahap Rebellion, Johnrey Mallari is working on a documentary about his great-uncle when he realizes that there may be something to his delusions"
Mallari,1642,6,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"2023 finally brings it all down to Jonathan Mallari de Dios, a physician who is summoned to Malang by a disturbing vision, only to be swept up in murders committed by a lookalike priest"
Mallari,1642,7,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"Okay, this is at least definitely no biopic, but it may be a little too easy to mass-market"
Mallari,1642,8,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"We Westerners have seen too much Jack the Ripper fanfiction for me to call that take on a historic serial killer inherently distasteful, but the ancestral slasher fantasy is indicative of the film's clumsy visions"
Mallari,1642,9,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"Things are already destabilized by the lack of rhythm in how this corresponds three storylines across two centuries, that wildly convoluted structure being even harder to invest in for the respective subplots"
Mallari,1642,10,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"Each storyline is also overdriven by some regressive agenda, with the 1810s probably being less grating in its Filipino religious nationalism because it's too distant from modern audiences"
Mallari,1642,11,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"The 1940s is an almost comically exploitative caricature of American colonialism and xenophobic representation (Oh, we didn't have that many serial killers then"
Mallari,1642,12,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,I don't think)
Mallari,1642,13,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"Before you tankies start in with ""Well, actually"
Mallari,1642,14,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,""", the 2023 storyline is hardly woke as the lineup's most archaic slasher, with such clunky archetypes as a stupefying transphobic murder fantasy"
Mallari,1642,15,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"These inane trappings and the flimsy dialogue they entail steadily overwhelm the convoluted narrative, folding its ambitions to the usual overproduced style, jump scares and exposition"
Mallari,1642,16,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"Mostly, the rote supernatural slasher is distinguished by overambition"
Mallari,1642,17,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"The extensive nonlinear and historical plotting practically demands your attention across 130 minutes of almost mean-spirited narrative gymnastics, ever-focused on building some grand scheme"
Mallari,1642,18,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"The Philippines' ""first serial killer"", a paradoxical figure in his own right, sets up an interesting allegory for the nature of evil as it evolves throughout history and manifests in a lineage"
Mallari,1642,19,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"However you feel about the kind of allegory that would start with ""Juan Severino Mallari couldn't have been that bad if he was a priest"", there is compelling character drama unraveling with the twists along this transgenerational saga"
Mallari,1642,20,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"It helps that Piolo Pascual is really good at capturing the unique natures and emotional layers of his three characters, when half of the cast's acting is arguably the most horrifying part of the movie"
Mallari,1642,21,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"For all of the dynamic production values and lofty storytelling around a chilling supernatural lore, I'm afraid a lot of this is typical trash horror"
Mallari,1642,22,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"And as such, it matches its campy charms with genuinely freaky visuals and atmosphere, and kills or action scenes that are gruesome without being too sensationalistic"
Mallari,1642,23,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"It's passably made for what it wants to be, but the first problem is that it doesn't fully know what that is"
Mallari,1642,24,cameronwjohnson,,100.0,ltbx,"This struggles for find coherent pacing in its wildly nonlinear story, bound by awkwardly moralistic subplots and clunky writing unto classically cloying pop slasher/horror tropes, still elevated enough by the intriguing plot, themes and lead performance(s) for those rousing thrills to salvage Roderick Cabrido's ""Mallari"" as a soul-chilling, if a little braindead representation of evil through history"

Mallari,1691,9,filmlauver,,140.0,ltbx,but historically kasi yun yung sabi sabi noon kaya very understandable bakit kailangan itong isama
Mallari,1692,1,orven,,140.0,ltbx,"Sometimes bonkers and sometimes unbearably cringe and unfinished, this is a film that honestly shows a bit of what Pampanga is all about"
Mallari,1692,2,orven,,140.0,ltbx,"A place with a lot of haunted memories—colonialism, counterinsurgency, vigilantism, etc"
Mallari,1692,3,orven,,140.0,ltbx,—that remain repressed to preserve some fragile semblance of sanity
Mallari,1692,4,orven,,140.0,ltbx,"as the protagonist shows, this cycle is notoriously hard to break"
Mallari,1692,5,orven,,140.0,ltbx,I think some better execution would have made this film honestly amazing
Mallari,1692,6,orven,,140.0,ltbx,I see it as having a political bite that most mainstream Filipino films frankly don’t have

Mallari,1702,2,aceoker_,,20.0,ltbx,"Maybe my expectations were too high because this film was suppose to be inspired from the first serial killer ever recorded in the Philippines and I was actually quite excited for that, but it was just another typical corny Filipino horror movie"
Mallari,1702,3,aceoker_,,20.0,ltbx,"For me, I feel like they wasted so much potential with this movie"
Mallari,1702,4,aceoker_,,20.0,ltbx,I actually hated the time travelling aspect of it so much

Mallari,1790,2,leccie,,160.0,ltbx,"the man you are- amazing artists i love itttt- cinematography is chefs kiss- tbh it was a bit predictable, but if i wasnt watching it w someone who has already seen it and stopped making side comments, i probably wouldn’t have been so sure of my guesses (bc i predicted smth that was abt happen then he kept asking questions testing me omg like ik im smart stop HAHAHAH"
Mallari,1790,3,leccie,,160.0,ltbx,and then the questions he was asking kept leading me to the right answers like pls ayaw ko pangunahan ang movie but its fun figuring it out lmao i felt so smart)overall
Mallari,1790,4,leccie,,160.0,ltbx,"i enjoyed it very muchalthough, what was the point of agnes dropping the keys to her car then coming back to get it and making it back to the car safe, like why did they focus on the keys in the first place if she was gonna be safe anyway lmaopwede nmn mangyare yung scene na yon w/o dropping her keys HAHAHA sayang lng memory charotedit: a lot of ppl didn’t like the ending, i guess bc of his love, he got so absorbed with saving his fiancé that he ended up causing his foresight to come true"
Mallari,1790,5,leccie,,160.0,ltbx,i love it bc it proved the line “lahat kayo ay si severino” to be true (well ig except johnrey

Mallari,1791,1,frommies,,40.0,ltbx,"weirdly written, weird dialoguepiolo pascual’s acting was pretty good but i personally hate the script that was given to him"
Mallari,1791,2,frommies,,40.0,ltbx,"also i kinda hate it bc the actual story its based off of is a priest who killed 57 people who attended the church (not people he believed was a plague to society like in the movie) believing it would heal his mother - it frames it as such that priests are incapable of doing bad things because they’re priests but ANYONE can be a bad personalso for a movie in 2023 they frame LGBTQ+ people horribly,,,"

Mallari,1816,2,ricaptured,,80.0,ltbx,i thought the film would be based on the true events of Mallari’s killings and it turned out to be a horror film instead of a thriller

Mallari,1820,1,itsearlthepearl,,180.0,ltbx,"At the side of the discussion of ""Gomburza"" (2023) as definitely the Filipino film for that year lies ""Mallari,"" which had a plot and premise that is so inviting and attractive"
Mallari,1820,2,itsearlthepearl,,180.0,ltbx,"I love how this film was composed, coming from a historical drama which (unfortunately) removed its history and replaced it with folk mystery"
Mallari,1820,3,itsearlthepearl,,180.0,ltbx,"As a horror film, it brought the classic tropes that make it as a recognizable 2020s Filipino horror film, much like the curse that the Mallari clan supposedly carried"
Mallari,1820,4,itsearlthepearl,,180.0,ltbx,"The plot was mostly well-done, with a decent sequence (maybe except for some parts), the cast also were done well"
Mallari,1820,5,itsearlthepearl,,180.0,ltbx,"Add to that a sprinkle of existential moralizing about personhood, decisions, the past, and the future"
Mallari,1820,6,itsearlthepearl,,180.0,ltbx,It has the perfect concoctions of an Eastern / Asian movie with Western elements
Mallari,1820,7,itsearlthepearl,,180.0,ltbx,"Although some points for improvement: I wish that there were less jumpscare moments that did not progress the plot forward, more historical elements melded into the mystery of the curse, and BETTER MUSIC, which I believe should have been filled more with orchestric slow music that conveys more drama than horror, which could also make its frightening atmosphere lasting and subtle"
Mallari,1821,1,hannahbishii,,120.0,ltbx,"When the Aswangs said that they will be only heard if someone from higher hierarchy of society will speak for them, I felt it"

Mallari,1841,2,ingyyy,,40.0,ltbx,I think the creepy witchcraft cult plot about escaping death would have been enough but they threw in monsters and astral projection/dreams and I wondered what else they could throw in there

Mallari,1876,1,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,a few thoughts on mallari
Mallari,1876,2,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,i didn't dislike it but i also didn't love it the way i thought i would
Mallari,1876,3,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,"i anticipated its netflix release for a long time and i wish i could say that it was giving everything and more,, but given my misguided, and quite frankly, very steep expectations the only thing i can say right now is that it was extremely promising if only they focused on the structure of the story better and made more practical choices"
Mallari,1876,4,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,by practical i mean mostly in terms of the special effects for the creatures and the way they aged the actors
Mallari,1876,5,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,they could have just used prosthetics and other more tangible effects and it would have looked far more believable and less jarring/out of place as opposed to the visual effects that were present throughout the entire material
Mallari,1876,6,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,as for the story
Mallari,1876,7,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,i really liked the way it enriched and utilized lower mythology and how they incorporated the various time periods in the philippines
Mallari,1876,8,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,"the superstitions, mixed with factual elements, and everything in the story comprising and lending filipino-ness to the film was refreshing as opposed to the constant cliches and re-hashing of tired tropes from the west in most horror films we encounter in mainstream filipino media"
Mallari,1876,9,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,"the antagonist was easy to spot early on in the film, i think it was a mix of the foreshadowing/direction and the acting"
Mallari,1876,10,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,perhaps they could have made less obvious choices on both the acting and script to be able to make the reveal less predictable
Mallari,1876,11,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,also there were parts in the script wherein they could have removed the dialogue
Mallari,1876,12,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,too much tell and not enough show
Mallari,1876,13,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,there were so many unnecessary monologues and it kind of removed me from urgent scenes wherein i would have appreciated just SEEING what the characters were saying out loud
Mallari,1876,14,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,it's a film
Mallari,1876,15,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,SHOW don't TELL right
Mallari,1876,16,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,the story also only really picked up its pace in the final 1/4 part of the entire running time which is a bummer
Mallari,1876,17,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,honestly it could have been trimmed down if only they removed some unnecessary monologues
Mallari,1876,18,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,if they did this the pacing of the entire film could have been better i think
Mallari,1876,19,aleiaanies,,80.0,ltbx,"overall i enjoyed it, i just felt disappointed because it could have been a cinematic masterpiece"
Mallari,1877,1,zcenik,,120.0,ltbx,"love this film, another opportunity na gawing role ni janella ang pagiging halimaw sa ganda na haha"
Mallari,1877,2,zcenik,,120.0,ltbx,funny yung movie for me
Mallari,1878,1,cescamae,,80.0,ltbx,plot was really interesting
Mallari,1878,2,cescamae,,80.0,ltbx,"although, the sfx makeup was underwhelming it could've been more gory and horrifying"
Mallari,1878,3,cescamae,,80.0,ltbx,ALSO severino's facial hair is taking me outtt what was thaaaaaat
Mallari,1878,4,cescamae,,80.0,ltbx,"and the cgi was not seamless huhu u can literally tell doña facunda's face is about to fall awff in her last scene,, it reminds me of reneesmee T_T"
Mallari,1878,5,cescamae,,80.0,ltbx,production design is good though
Mallari,1878,6,cescamae,,80.0,ltbx,"overall, there's something empty about it i cannot pinpoint what but something about it feels short"
Mallari,1878,7,cescamae,,80.0,ltbx,"but the plot is there, the music is good as well, and the production wowww"
Mallari,1879,1,phiya_,,120.0,ltbx,Gusto ko nalang maging artista para mahalikan si Piolo

Mallari,1885,1,apricityfilms,,120.0,ltbx,kinda boring lol but still very scary because of unnecessary jump scares
Mallari,1886,1,charlynnicole,,160.0,ltbx,"bat kasi ang pogi ni piolo as severino, actually lahat sila  medj naging kahawig niya si cedric sa gomburza kapag naka-priest attire siya"
Mallari,1886,2,charlynnicole,,160.0,ltbx,"ang cheesy niya, lalo na yung lines na pang-gen z"
Mallari,1886,3,charlynnicole,,160.0,ltbx,"anyway, first time ko ulit manood ng movie sa tv namin, AND TELL YOU WHAT super awkward nung part na may ka-svc si Didi HUHUHUHU ang stiff ko non as in hindi ako gumagalaw kasi naririnig ng mga tao dito sa bahay yung moans bwiset tas ako lang mag-isa non na nanonood sa sala, i was like “ang tagal naman nung papatay dito huhu”so, yon nga"

Mallari,1886,6,charlynnicole,,160.0,ltbx,"ang slayable pa ng character ni janella sa huling part hahahahah, but, want me a man like jonathan"
Mallari,1886,7,charlynnicole,,160.0,ltbx,"medyo hindi na nakakatakot yung mga taong palitaw-litaw, iisang make-up lang kasi sila  speaking of make-up, yung balbas ni severino  girl, buti nalang kahawig ni cedric"
Mallari,1886,8,charlynnicole,,160.0,ltbx,"ang pogi rin ni lucas, lalo na nung"

Mallari,1916,1,kate_do,,80.0,ltbx,"However I enjoyed the latter part of the movie, I still don't understand why they went the time travelling-aswang-astral projection route for a character as real as Severino Mallari, an actual serial killer"

Mallari,1920,5,tobzxv,,120.0,ltbx,"like, the mananaggal storyline, yun ba talaga ang sabi sabi noon kaya pumapatay si fr"

Mallari,1925,25,geoffr3ys,,80.0,ltbx,"the whole thing was messy and it had me questioning most of the scenes relativity to the plot as well as the characters and their history (kimi), it did scare me though, but not the type of scare that will stick for a long time and scare me as I go to sleep or take a shower"

Mallari,1946,1,cyrnryc,,80.0,ltbx,Predictable na si JC Santos yung bata sa umpisa pa lang and medyo overused na yung revenge angle ng alila sa amo na nang alipusta sa kanila
Mallari,1946,2,cyrnryc,,80.0,ltbx,Mas may igaganda pa sana yung pelikula kung ang naging focus ng narrative ay kung ano ang ugat ng mga kulto at kung ano ang impluwensiya nito sa pananampalatayang kristiyano
Mallari,1946,3,cyrnryc,,80.0,ltbx,"Pakiramdam ko lang din parang pilit yung pagkakacorrelate ng ""sumpa"" sa ""pag-ibig"" dahil para sa akin, real love is not a curse but a gift"
Mallari,1946,6,cyrnryc,,80.0,ltbx,Sana mag-improve pa yung CGI work sa Pinas para naman tumaas ang kalidad ng special fx dito sa ating bansa
Mallari,1946,7,cyrnryc,,80.0,ltbx,"At siguro kahit walang concept ng time travel dito sa pelikula, sa tingin ko ay magiging epektibo pa rin ito kung mas malalim pa yung pagkakadetalye sa pagkatao ni Severino Mallari"

Mallari,1953,3,neslxycream,,140.0,ltbx,Visual fx didn’t really do it for me; it would’ve been better if they used prosthetics and mechanics instead of doing it full digital

Mallari,1964,3,astraeachu,,80.0,ltbx,"Feeling ko rin folk culture was used para iparating na kahit papano malinis pa rin konsensya ni Mallari at napilitan lang siya, kumbaga to give him some sort of salvation even if in real life hindi naman ganoon ang nangyari"

Mallari,2269,1,athenamikk,,180.0,ltbx,the concept was definitely there
Mallari,2269,2,athenamikk,,180.0,ltbx,"yung time travel, the killings and why they were happening, and how piolo played out 3 different characters"
Mallari,2269,3,athenamikk,,180.0,ltbx,storyline/plot wise goods naman e i found it really interesting
Mallari,2269,4,athenamikk,,180.0,ltbx,or baka sadyang mahilig lang ako sa mga ganitong genre
Mallari,2269,5,athenamikk,,180.0,ltbx,we will never knownakulangan lang ako sa acting in some parts like yung takot ni piolo and yung mga scenes na kasama si janella
Mallari,2269,6,athenamikk,,180.0,ltbx,"it just felt so awkward, so forced"
Mallari,2269,7,athenamikk,,180.0,ltbx,i mean its not a romance film naman pero it was just so
Mallari,2269,9,athenamikk,,180.0,ltbx,i kind of get naman why they tried to incorporate horror into the film pero a lot of the scenes needed more work pag dating sa editing
Mallari,2269,10,athenamikk,,180.0,ltbx,JC WAS SO SO GOOD
Mallari,2269,11,athenamikk,,180.0,ltbx,if piolo werent so yummy baka i would definitely have him as my fav actor in this film cheretang sad lang nung ending especially for janella and 2nd gen piolo kasi imagine all those decades that 2nd gen endured halos nauwi lang sa wala
Mallari,2269,12,athenamikk,,180.0,ltbx,it was a selfish act na nagmukhang selfless lang to mr 3rd gen because of his love for janella

Mallari,2270,3,scoutisha,,120.0,ltbx,janella salvador 2
Mallari,2270,4,scoutisha,,120.0,ltbx,admitting piolo is a good actor n a good looking one
Mallari,2271,1,matchalatte808,,80.0,ltbx,the ending is not giving
Mallari,2272,1,mairemar,,120.0,ltbx,idk what else to expect but i was almost acting crazy just by watching them make their silly goofy life decisions… i miss when horrors just let people scream and die tbh
Mallari,2273,1,sansrio,,120.0,ltbx,ang random nung manananggal transformation putangina
Mallari,2274,1,bernth4lbae,,80.0,ltbx,DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL
Mallari,2274,2,bernth4lbae,,80.0,ltbx,"the concept of it being focused on the first serial killer in Philippines turned into a bunch movie tropes (horror, fiction, sci fi, and melodrama)"
Mallari,2274,3,bernth4lbae,,80.0,ltbx,The production is great but the acting isn't good
Mallari,2274,4,bernth4lbae,,80.0,ltbx,Jumpscares were underwhelming and cheap (Having big black eyes isn't scary)
Mallari,2274,5,bernth4lbae,,80.0,ltbx,"I was expecting a crime/thriller movie, which could've been good and way better rather than mixing it with fiction, gulat ako may aswang na nadamay tapos yung sisiw na lipat ng lipat ughh"
Mallari,2274,6,bernth4lbae,,80.0,ltbx,Had the potential ganda na sana
Mallari,2274,7,bernth4lbae,,80.0,ltbx,"Many scenes in the movie are anti climax, jumpscare that had nothing to do with the plot but still proceed to scare the character wahh scary"
Mallari,2274,8,bernth4lbae,,80.0,ltbx,I cannot explain how I want just a simple crime/thriller movie that isn't mainstream or indie typa movie
Mallari,2274,9,bernth4lbae,,80.0,ltbx,Just a perfect crime based movie here in the Philippines with a better production and this was it but it took a big turn to be THAT
Mallari,2274,10,bernth4lbae,,80.0,ltbx,OVER ALL 2 STARS one for Papi P and one for Janella Salvador
Mallari,2275,1,halasijanee,,140.0,ltbx,family reunion game idea: pasahan ng sisiw

Mallari,2282,1,_deknees,,20.0,ltbx,This was based on true events which could’ve made it a great movie
Mallari,2282,2,_deknees,,20.0,ltbx,BUT it was overdone tbh
Mallari,2282,3,_deknees,,20.0,ltbx,the correlation of witchcraft and curses could’ve been good if it was executed better
Mallari,2282,4,_deknees,,20.0,ltbx,The astral projection shit was just an excuse to make the movie longer and idk it just felt like the plot as whole was lacking something
Mallari,2282,5,_deknees,,20.0,ltbx,Another reminder that horror movies made in ph is just not it

Mallari,2285,3,pistachoblud,,40.0,ltbx,+ all that shit for nothing
Mallari,2286,1,unraveling,,100.0,ltbx,"i expected this movie to be more about juan severino mallari's life story, how he came to be a filipino priest during the spanish rule, his talent for calligraphy, his descent to psychosis, how he became physically ill, instead of focusing on a bunch of elements that doesn't get that much closure and ultimately flops"
Mallari,2286,2,unraveling,,100.0,ltbx,the title is basically carrying his name – make it about him and not this astral projection whatsoever
Mallari,2286,3,unraveling,,100.0,ltbx,"also, i think there's more horror to being labeled as the first documented filipino serial killer, but then i get why his story was interpreted this way"
Mallari,2286,4,unraveling,,100.0,ltbx,"with the lack of accurate accounts about his life, the mystery can be a really good horror material"
Mallari,2287,1,softstills,,120.0,ltbx,interesting plot but

Mallari,2296,1,aejwan,,160.0,ltbx,"everything seems in place except sa manananggal at pasahan ng sisiw thingy, i just hope they’ve replaced it with a creepier scene since we’re talking about a serial killer here"

Mallari,2309,5,iscreamavalor,,80.0,ltbx,"if u think about it, he was no different than any serial killers nowadays, he was just more concerning because he was a man of God"

Mallari,2312,1,cazzlacman,,140.0,ltbx,ok i didn't expect this elaborate of a storyline because i thought it would be a generic like following the life of fr mallari but the jumps between generations made it more interesting

Mallari,2490,3,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,—because this just goes to show to never underestimate the middle children
Mallari,2490,4,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,Or something along the lines
Mallari,2490,5,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"If we reach quite a bit further, the shoe will fit"
Mallari,2490,6,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,I’m a strong believer that Mallari is also big on middle child propaganda
Mallari,2490,8,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"Johnrey just raised the bar, and he never got down from there"
Mallari,2490,9,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"The ending, tying all the stakes to Jonathan’s choices, love, and mistakes, is probably the only end of the road that I will accept given that this film’s agenda was to take things up a notch from the current movie landscape that can be seen in our locality"
Mallari,2490,10,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"Johnrey (being my favorite of the Mallari men, so let me once again shine a light on him) was there to create contrast, moral ambiguities, and drive the stakes into an extensive pitfall—and the pitfall was just that, balls-deep"
Mallari,2490,11,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"Mallari, then, for all its worth and not just the ending, was an adventurous take of the Filipino supernatural lores, the historical figure that heralded the first serial killings sighted in the country, and the ambition to create a noir motion picture avant-garde among films in the industry that are still struggling to get away from the love teams and third-parties formula"
Mallari,2490,12,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"Perhaps, the glaring criticism to be made is the shortcomings in execution that anchored what turned to be just potential by the end"
Mallari,2490,13,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"A lot of efforts have gone into this and if we nitpick each of them, I am fairly certain that on their own, these individual efforts are granted high praises"
Mallari,2490,14,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"In some aspects, however, when they are expected to work well together, they grapple with finding such a way to actually mesh in compatibility—but end up leaving one, two, or the other on a rather lackluster note, holding back what could have been a remarkable sequence"
Mallari,2490,15,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"(There are choices that I disagree with, among them, sequences that translate to transphobia and hate crimes against prostitution—but to further name a few of these choices, this review would do well on that"
Mallari,2490,16,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,")That is to say that, though I agree with the choice for wrapping up the primary character’s story, among (above-mentioned) other things, the progression of his character could have been subtly shown and fine tuned throughout the film"
Mallari,2490,17,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"Alas, with such an extravagant narrative filled with complicated layers, the movie being too busy, the ending became abrupt"
Mallari,2490,18,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"On the note of acknowledging Jonathan, his storyline couldn’t have happened without the intergenerational storyline connecting the characters that Piolo Pascual embodied"
Mallari,2490,19,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"It is with such element, aided by time traveling and the use of vintage themes, that Mallari became what it is: an explored genre"
Mallari,2490,20,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"In spite of my criticisms, it was still a hard work to have made a movie such as this one, and even harder still to execute interconnected storylines resulting to an impressionable film—of that, it was never a doubt"
Mallari,2490,21,mmkl,,140.0,ltbx,"I do hope that directors and production crews alike take note of choices, as expounded in the story, and the film itself in its entirety, for future projects"

Mallari,2549,3,ilaka131,,100.0,ltbx,"At times, this movie borderlines on the comedic muses of a Praybet Benjamin movie"
Mallari,2549,4,ilaka131,,100.0,ltbx,"The horror aspects are not scary at all, and the inter connectivity between generations is terribly written"
Mallari,2549,5,ilaka131,,100.0,ltbx,"The Philippines can do so much better, and I’m sure it has, but it’s got to find its next visionary to usher Pinoy film into a new/uncharted territory of greatness"

Mallari,2566,5,angeeeeel,,80.0,ltbx,"like the predictable ""twists"", the unnecessary scenes, and questionable dialogue choices in certain parts of the movie just made me roll my eyes everytime"
Mallari,2567,1,mnchrbndct,,80.0,ltbx,This film had a lot of potential and received significant praise and support during the MMFF last year
Mallari,2567,2,mnchrbndct,,80.0,ltbx,"However, as I watched it, I couldn't help but feel disappointed"
Mallari,2567,3,mnchrbndct,,80.0,ltbx,"It's the type of film that ""could've been better, but they chose a different path and stuck with it"
Mallari,2567,4,mnchrbndct,,80.0,ltbx,""" Many scenes felt odd to me"
Mallari,2567,5,mnchrbndct,,80.0,ltbx,"The sound design was terrific, but the jump scares weren't very scary, to be honest"
Mallari,2567,6,mnchrbndct,,80.0,ltbx,What I really loved about the film was JC Santos's top-tier acting
Mallari,2567,7,mnchrbndct,,80.0,ltbx,"Despite its flaws, it's still a solid horror film with a great effort in delivering Mallari's story, though it could have been better executed"

Mallari,2574,2,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"I went in to this with high expectation kasi it was so well received during Metro Manila Film Festival 2024 but I ended up just being disappointed and frustrated, bullshit ba yung mga reviews nun"
Mallari,2574,3,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"They heavily marketed this as based on Juan Severino Mallari's life, but it's not really"
Mallari,2574,4,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,It's pure fantasy
Mallari,2574,5,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"Ang dami nilang creative input/choices that it reminded me so much of when Eugene Domingo was making a ""movie"" about Josephine Bracken's life in Ang Babae Sa Septic Tank 3 (2019)"
Mallari,2574,6,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,A time travelling serial killer
Mallari,2574,7,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,Seryoso ba
Mallari,2574,8,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,Also did they really try to justify a serial killer's actions
Mallari,2574,9,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"Sa panahon ngayon I feel like that is something the storytellers need to be careful with, example yung Netflix's Dahmer series; it's so crazy to think na that had some ""influence"" on some people"
Mallari,2574,10,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"Not even 15 minutes in sa movie may mga cheap jumpscares na, they heavily relied on it through out the movie too, it got boring really fast"
Mallari,2574,11,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"There was even one jumpscare na I'm sure they ripped off from Smile (2022), I never watched it but it was on trailer"
Mallari,2574,12,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,Mallari also does a lot of telling and not showing; information dumping is so lazy
Mallari,2574,13,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,Why do we need to know why this random old lady has a long life
Mallari,2574,14,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,And bakit kailangan natin malaman yung wife ni Johnrey Mallari is like a coconut na brown on the outside and white on the inside
Mallari,2574,15,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"Like, So"
Mallari,2574,16,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,ANO NAMAN
Mallari,2574,17,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"As a viewer, anong use ng information na to"
Mallari,2574,18,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"The movie is 2 hours long and I felt every minute of it, ang daming unnecessary scenes"
Mallari,2574,19,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,And the ghosts and monsters in this
Mallari,2574,20,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"Holy sh*t, it looked so bad"
Mallari,2574,21,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"Using CGI was really a choice, their faces ended up looking so goofy"
Mallari,2574,22,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"To think na this is something they could've easily done with makeup/practical effects, like aren't we known for that"
Mallari,2574,23,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"Nakita na natin yung talent ng Filipinos dun with the Shake, Rattle and Roll movies through the years"
Mallari,2574,24,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,Were the filmmakers so cheap and it's something na ayaw nilang gastusan
Mallari,2574,25,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,And the 21 year age difference between Janella Salvador and Piolo Pascual; the Philippine entertainment industry needs to stop doing this
Mallari,2574,26,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"Like, maybe Piolo doesn't look it but he's old enough to be her Dad"
Mallari,2574,27,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,Na he has a son na just a year older lang kay Janella Salvador
Mallari,2574,28,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"Mallari (2023) is way too goofy for me to even notice if the actors are doing good, or if anything in it is"
Mallari,2574,29,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,Nakakagigil lang yung movie
Mallari,2574,30,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"Apparently there's another Juan Severino Mallari project in the works, but this one is an international series and starring Dennis Trillo, and said to be more of a biopic"
Mallari,2574,33,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"I paused halfway through this movie because I needed a break, it gave me a headache"
Mallari,2574,34,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,I watched Running Man Philippines' latest episode and then Sunod; another MMFF 2019 movie entry because I feel like I needed a dose of a good Pinoy horror movie
Mallari,2574,38,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"That scene of the manananggal flying around the room, obviously panicking and then it cuts to some characters just staring at it, mixed with the goofy looking cgi"
Mallari,2574,39,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,Seryoso ba talaga
Mallari,2574,40,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,I ended up laughing so much during that scene
Mallari,2574,41,aguynamedivan,,20.0,ltbx,"Even replayed it because it was so goofy na it's funny, it was the only scene in the movie that got a reaction out of me"

Mallari,2580,3,leandrokevino,,100.0,ltbx,Had it focused on Fr
Mallari,2580,4,leandrokevino,,100.0,ltbx,"Severino, I think this could have been phenomenal"
Mallari,2580,5,leandrokevino,,100.0,ltbx,The biggest letdown of this film was CGI
Mallari,2581,1,look4angel,,140.0,ltbx,I think I set the expectations too high… The time traveler plot was so good I kinda wish that they stayed with it
Mallari,2581,2,look4angel,,140.0,ltbx,"That twist was a twist, it was a wtf moment"
Mallari,2581,3,look4angel,,140.0,ltbx,"I think I would have enjoyed it if it was a slow burn, there is a lot happening like for example that random mananangal and tikbalang (I guess) is unnecessary"

Mallari,2582,2,fxxiii,,140.0,ltbx,"oh piolo piolo piolo like there’s too much going on, the scares are heavy handed and so badly executed, the ideas behind the class and religious themes are"

Mallari,2582,4,fxxiii,,140.0,ltbx,"with all these elements and ideas juggling around, it definitely could’ve been executed better, but alas, I love you convoluted filipino horror period piece"

Mallari,2583,1,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,"Mallari (2023) was considered a historical thriller film but instead, we got a horror fantasy film that somehow got recognized by Warner Bros"
Mallari,2583,2,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,One thing I must admit is that the film has great spectacular production sets & designs
Mallari,2583,3,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,And it's such a shame that it was implemented for this horror film with cheap jump scares and unnecessary time-traveling twist to make the premise so interesting
Mallari,2583,4,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,I wished the story should've been like GomBurZa
Mallari,2583,5,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,"I actually do not know that this film is ""loosely"" based on Fr"
Mallari,2583,6,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,"Juan Severino Mallari, who is the first documented serial killer from the Philippines"
Mallari,2583,7,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,"I said ""loosely based"" because the film even adds two unnecessary fictional characters related to Mallari"
Mallari,2583,8,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,The Mallari trio is played by none other than Piolo Pascual
Mallari,2583,9,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,"It is very impressive for one actor to play three roles in this film, but his ""present"" Mallari performance was so unconvincing throughout the film, compared to his two roles"
Mallari,2583,10,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,"It would've been nice if Piolo just played the actual Mallari, not this make-believe storytelling"
Mallari,2583,11,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,The story is complicated and it makes me wonder what are they trying to tell other than Mallari's actions for his killings
Mallari,2583,12,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,I can't get enough about this time-travelling twist
Mallari,2583,13,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,It creates a turmoil to its story that I can't describe and say anything positive about it
Mallari,2583,14,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,"If Mallari take the GomBurZa approach as a proper historical thriller, it would've been a great film"
Mallari,2583,15,lordgallenghein,,100.0,ltbx,"But unfortunately, the film shall take its path for being a convoluting mess with great visuals and production design"
Mallari,2584,1,yoomivs,,100.0,ltbx,"wtf was that movie, the idea was there but poorly executed, def had a potential if it was executed well"

Mallari,2686,3,k_guzuguzu,,120.0,ltbx,"Piolo Pascual, and overall the writing of the main character Jonathan, I think, is a main weak point of this movie for me"
Mallari,2686,4,k_guzuguzu,,120.0,ltbx,"Piolo was not believable as a doctor or as a filmmaker (maybe a little bit as a serial killer), his character is weakly fleshed out outside of the obsession with some vague thing with the house and its connection to Janella, and the moustache and glasses are just laughable"
Mallari,2686,5,k_guzuguzu,,120.0,ltbx,I was honestly more captivated by Lucas and the other mga mambabarang
Mallari,2686,6,k_guzuguzu,,120.0,ltbx,"Overall, needed paring down -- some roles were superficial yet occupied too much screen time (cough the kids and I mean all the kids, and the policemen cough) -- should imo have focused on Severino Mallari more, and not used godawful CG for old Gloria Diaz"

Mallari,2714,2,zachtheestal1,,140.0,ltbx,"I think watching it first in cinema had a different experience than watching it at home because I loved the scoring and sound of the film, it literally echoed in the cinema"
Mallari,2714,3,zachtheestal1,,140.0,ltbx,"Plotwise I liked the premise, some dialogues a lil questionable but the acting was actually pretty good, some held backs only was the cgi, which is a bummer"

Mallari,2719,3,1876,,60.0,ltbx,"this movie was lacklustre at the very least, and mediocre at best"
Mallari,2719,4,1876,,60.0,ltbx,"apart from its borderline misogynistic and transphobic elements, its ambition to sprinkle in a little bit of everything was quite disappointing in its delivery (especially the sci-fi bit)"

Mallari,2821,8,moresbi,,100.0,ltbx,"I thought the movie went a bit over its head, to be honest"
Mallari,2821,9,moresbi,,100.0,ltbx,Both plot and execution-wise
Mallari,2821,10,moresbi,,100.0,ltbx,"On a more ""focused"" perspective, the plot has a few glaring plotholes and some underwhelming execution (particularly where action and horror are involved, for the most part)"
Mallari,2821,11,moresbi,,100.0,ltbx,"Several different approaches: some better, some worse (personally, I didn't enjoy some of the jumpscare technique with the editing)"

Mallari,2821,15,moresbi,,100.0,ltbx,"The latter stages were reasonable, particularly again structure-wise"
Mallari,2821,16,moresbi,,100.0,ltbx,"I didn't particularly enjoy the ending, though it should be ok-ish (if you enjoy the ""reason""; I didn't and I missed some wickedness, for sure)"
Mallari,2821,17,moresbi,,100.0,ltbx,"Overall, an ambitious and interesting movie that I felt went for more than it could manage, though it's certainly understandable that you should go for it ^_^ I felt the plot could've been stronger, particularly around the ""origin/reason"" and the execution could also have been better"
Mallari,2821,18,moresbi,,100.0,ltbx,"The horror elements felt lacking, particularly in several (avoided) scenes"
Mallari,2821,19,moresbi,,100.0,ltbx,"But I think they did pretty great in creating something quite interesting around the ""main story"" element"
Mallari,2821,20,moresbi,,100.0,ltbx,I think this can totally be a 6 too but I'll fall back to the reasonable 5 for this one

Mallari,2951,3,heyyitsiosef,,140.0,ltbx,I think this performance if Piolo Pascual is a bit lukewarm
Mallari,2951,4,heyyitsiosef,,140.0,ltbx,"Despite their short appearances in the film, JC Santos and Janella Salvador had great performances here"
Mallari,2951,5,heyyitsiosef,,140.0,ltbx,"For the most part, it was a bit sad that the film leaned more into the cheap jump scare horror when it could have capitalized on the opportunities brought about by religion and humanity"
Mallari,2951,6,heyyitsiosef,,140.0,ltbx,"However, it would take a certain awareness and attention to detail to realize that there is a deeper horror embedded in the film - that love is a curse, and the lengths that a person will go through for the person they love, regardless of the consequences they face in return"

Mallari,2994,3,hazelmarie,,100.0,ltbx,"the plot was all over the place, the dialogue trying to sound deep even when they were in the present time, the distracting CGI, the time traveling"
Mallari,2994,4,hazelmarie,,100.0,ltbx,i can go on but i think the main issue was the film failed to just focus on one thing and flesh out the story from there
Mallari,2994,5,hazelmarie,,100.0,ltbx,the main plot about a priest who's a serial killer is interesting enough but they just had to add a bunch of other elements that resulted to a convoluted story

Mallari,3019,11,slasherhimbo,,160.0,ltbx,"Do note that despite this being based off a serial killer, it is highly fictionalized, so if you're expecting a biopic, you'll surely be disappointed"

Mallari,3024,2,jpismyname,,100.0,ltbx,"It mostly resorts to ineffective jump scares, the movie isn't that scary and there are also a few dull moments"
Mallari,3024,3,jpismyname,,100.0,ltbx,Even the audience sa sinehan aren't reacting sa mga ibang nakakatakot na eksena and no one seemed enthusiastic or something

Mallari,3026,1,inkproductions,,140.0,ltbx,"An entertainingly insane, if at times, clunky murder thriller that is more compelling with the crazy plot threads and character motivations and choices, and far less so with incredibly cheap scares and a mix of beautiful cinematography and design and underwhelming visual effects"
Mallari,3026,2,inkproductions,,140.0,ltbx,"Performances are strong all around, esp Piolo Pascual being able to somehow have a incredible range playing three versions of himself"
Mallari,3026,3,inkproductions,,140.0,ltbx,One scene with him in a church talking to demons is more compelling and scary then the litany of pointless jumpscares that didn't add much at all
Mallari,3027,1,macchiathos,,120.0,ltbx,Writing is all over the place but Piolo's performance held the movie together

Mallari,3031,2,kayeyay,,140.0,ltbx,Ending is quite satisfying but it relies heavily on jump-scares making the experience kinda random and cheap
Mallari,3031,3,kayeyay,,140.0,ltbx,Piolo killed in this
Mallari,3032,1,reyryy,,120.0,ltbx,The CGI was horrific and the horror was average
Mallari,3032,2,reyryy,,120.0,ltbx,But I really liked the plot
Mallari,3032,3,reyryy,,120.0,ltbx,"The concept was quite similar to Attack on Titan, but in this case, instead of past holders of the “Attack Titan”, the protagonist can communicate with his ancestors"
Mallari,3032,4,reyryy,,120.0,ltbx,JC’s acting was incredible
Mallari,3032,5,reyryy,,120.0,ltbx,The scene where Lucas was fighting with Jonathan was so cool
Mallari,3032,6,reyryy,,120.0,ltbx,The scene where Severino was dancing with his mom with the epic music at the end was beautiful
Mallari,3032,7,reyryy,,120.0,ltbx,I really wish they did better with the CGI though
Mallari,3033,1,tamboexit,,,ltbx,"Gusto ko lang sabihin na hindi ikinahiya ng film na ito ang transphobia & criminalization ng sex work - baka kasi kailangan lang din masabi sakaling may nakikinig, so yeahhh…nakalulungkot"
Mallari,3033,2,tamboexit,,,ltbx,"Anyways, the concept could have been a top tier religious horror/suspense/slasher/thriller (heck even camp) but it was horror only during the sigawan moments"
Mallari,3033,3,tamboexit,,,ltbx,After that nothing was sustained
Mallari,3033,4,tamboexit,,,ltbx,I left the theater na walang baon pauwi
Mallari,3033,5,tamboexit,,,ltbx,I learned nothing new abt Fr
Mallari,3033,6,tamboexit,,,ltbx,"Severino Mallari, what was his real motive labas sa fiction…or idk  which was real and documented (ang ganda sana i-explore)"
Mallari,3033,7,tamboexit,,,ltbx,"Di ko rin maiwasan ikumpara sa Seklusyon ni Erik Matti which was for me, an eye opener to the horrors of the Catholic church"
Mallari,3033,8,tamboexit,,,ltbx,That film perfectly blended horror + criticism on the Catholic church
Mallari,3033,9,tamboexit,,,ltbx,I remember leaving the cinema with lots of questions on Catholicism
Mallari,3033,10,tamboexit,,,ltbx,"Dito wala, purely entertainment"
Mallari,3033,11,tamboexit,,,ltbx,"Pero yun nga, gets ko kasi ito ay MMFF at hindi Cinemalaya (pero MMFF din naman yung Seklusyon kaya lang that was a different time I guessss huehue)"
Mallari,3033,12,tamboexit,,,ltbx,So sana ibang direction naman ang tahakin ng Severino ni Dennis Trillo (looking forward to that)

Mallari,3034,1,cee_jay03,,120.0,ltbx,"Let’s get the good things out of the way: Piolo Pascual is terrific portraying multiple characters, each of his character given just enough time to be fleshed out in a 2-hour runtime"
Mallari,3034,2,cee_jay03,,120.0,ltbx,"The production is gorgeous, a really big step up here for Filipino cinema"
Mallari,3034,3,cee_jay03,,120.0,ltbx,"I admire the concept of this film, has so much potential to showcase a unique Filipino horror experience with a touch of history and historical fiction"
Mallari,3034,4,cee_jay03,,120.0,ltbx,"The history side of things was handled pretty decently, but unfortunately the horror itself is the singular thing holding this film back, relying on the usual cheap jumpscare tactics, with lackluster use of its unique atmosphere to build up dread and tension"
Mallari,3034,5,cee_jay03,,120.0,ltbx,"This film could’ve been so much more than what we have, but at the very least I’ll give it this: it is a step-up from the generic Filipino horror rubbish that we get every year"
Mallari,3035,1,janyuan,,140.0,ltbx,sobrang needy and clingy nung sisiw parang ako lang emei wish it didn't resort to cheap jumpscares too often just to fill the run time because it's the last thing it needed
Mallari,3035,2,janyuan,,140.0,ltbx,"the dread, creepy atmosphere is already there that cabrido has crafted the backdrop of these three characters quite nicely"
Mallari,3035,3,janyuan,,140.0,ltbx,"the film had A LOT of creative freedom and shied away from being historically accurate and became a non-linear multiverse folk horror that might've been easily given me the ick, but i still appreciated how it became its own thing as it progresses, which leads as to why i still think it worked for me; it is committed on what it wanted to be and its theme of greed for power is clearly understood"
Mallari,3035,4,janyuan,,140.0,ltbx,"piolo proved his acting prowess once again playing three generations of mallari, a tour de force performance"

Mallari,3037,1,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,"Initially gave this four stars after leaving the theater, but after giving it some thought I’m taking it down to 3"
Mallari,3037,2,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,5 Mallari (2023) boasts impeccable set design and costumes that make each time period feel robust yet still feel lived in
Mallari,3037,3,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,Pascual and Santos’ performances carry a lot of the weight of this film for me with Pascual delivering in all three roles and Santos’ grit as Lucas
Mallari,3037,4,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,Janella Salvador’s Agnes also packed a punch despite her somewhat short screen time
Mallari,3037,5,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,"Apart from Pascual’s portrayal of each Mallari, the film’s choice of anchoring each era to the conflicts that affected the Filipino of its period"
Mallari,3037,6,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,The feudal tensions of the 1800s and the CIA Aswang psy-op gave more body to the time periods presented
Mallari,3037,7,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,The burden each Mallari carried through time eventually made that ending make sense to me
Mallari,3037,8,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,"Greed, on both systemic and intimate levels, drive the motivations of each character"
Mallari,3037,9,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,"Considering all of this, what made Mallari (2023) fall flat for me was its horror aspect"
Mallari,3037,10,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,"I am no expert on the horror genre and seeing this film made me want to read up on it haha lol but I found that the jumpscares eventually felt cheap, predictable, and unnecessary"
Mallari,3037,11,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,"The CGI also faltered during one scene with Doña Facunda, though it warrants a pwede na from me kasi di naman siya ganun ka-distracting"
Mallari,3037,12,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,So ayun
Mallari,3037,13,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,Also the girl who played Felicity looks like she knows what an iPhone is so medyo di bagay sa time period
Mallari,3037,14,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,"Anyways, fun movie"
Mallari,3037,15,kandreamt,,140.0,ltbx,Folk catholicism in Filipino horror is always so interesting
Mallari,3038,1,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,A smorgasbord of horror genres that worked well
Mallari,3038,2,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,Watching Mallari is an journey and the ride paid off really well
Mallari,3038,3,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,"The film had such an interesting oremise and promise that accounted for a fictional spin on a historical event that shaped the town of Magalang, Pampanga"
Mallari,3038,4,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,Pao Orendain's lenses played such a big role in making sure every beat was felt and audiences were immersed
Mallari,3038,5,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,"From the colos and light8ng used up to the choreography of the camerawork, it was a feast fornthe eyes"
Mallari,3038,6,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,The overall production design was superb as well
Mallari,3038,7,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,"Having three eras worth of costumes, props, sets is a hard task but it was executed really well"
Mallari,3038,8,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,Everything felt too realistic and you can't deny the time out into crafting each set
Mallari,3038,9,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,"But of course, the acting performances of the cast are the highlight"
Mallari,3038,10,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual delivered such a great take on three distinct personalities from three different time periods
Mallari,3038,11,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,"From the murderous priest, steadfast documentarian, up to the persistent doctor, all Piolos had their own personalities and nuances"
Mallari,3038,12,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,Best actor calibre performance
Mallari,3038,13,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,JC Santos and Gloria Diaz also shone in their roles by delivering really strong and powerful performances
Mallari,3038,14,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,"As usual, JC Santos was amazing and undoubtedly a strong contender for Best Actor with this performance"
Mallari,3038,15,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,"Meanwhile, Gloria Diaz was eerie, creepy, and committed"
Mallari,3038,16,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,"Last time I saw a strong Gloria Diaz performance like this was way back in ""Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo"" & its sequel and ""Nasaan Ka Man"
Mallari,3038,17,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,"""Special shoutout to Paps Raffy Tejada"
Mallari,3038,18,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,"Again, giving life to roles he's portraying"
Mallari,3038,19,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,He's a breath of fresh air amidst the eerie fele8ng this film gave off
Mallari,3038,21,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,Kuddos to Direk Derick Cabrido for successfully mounting such a great film
Mallari,3038,22,franzhalili,,160.0,ltbx,It's one of the best Filipino horror films in modern times

Mallari,3040,2,kung_fu_kiks,,120.0,ltbx,"Sakit sa tenga ng sounds di siya jumpscary masyado tulad ng Marita, ma a-amaze ka sa gimmick pero palpak pa din ending"
Mallari,3041,1,thesuperkayo,,180.0,ltbx,"Aside from being an intense and original folk horror, MALLARI is a provocative portrayal of how greed, obsession of power, and complacency allow evil to thrive"
Mallari,3041,2,thesuperkayo,,180.0,ltbx,"Religion, imperialists, and landlords… they create monsters"
Mallari,3041,3,thesuperkayo,,180.0,ltbx,"Piolo Pascual gives the performance of his career, and JC Santos proves once again that he is a one of a kind talent"
Mallari,3041,4,thesuperkayo,,180.0,ltbx,"There are times when the script’s expository dialogue makes the film cringey, but Mallari is still a powerful, thoughtprovoking film"
Mallari,3042,1,rendezwolves,,120.0,ltbx,"the editing of the first half stressed me out, could’ve been better if they explored the backstory more"

Mallari,3050,3,kimpoybrian,,160.0,ltbx,JC Santos is a favorite for me — that exact moment of his was significant and breathtaking

Mallari,3052,2,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,"Severino Mallari's killings, it's a complex and expansive story, going back & forth through 3 centuries worth of lore"
Mallari,3052,3,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,"It's also an opportunity for some gorgeous production, showcasing 19th & 20th century dialect, environment, and aesthetic, which this film brilliantly executed"
Mallari,3052,4,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,"The storytelling itself left something to be desired, where more proper character exploration were more than welcome"
Mallari,3052,5,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,The killings as well is something that is promised but weren't fully delivered
Mallari,3052,6,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,"It's worst aspects are it's delivery of horror, its plot twist, and ending"
Mallari,3052,7,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,"It has the worst standards of Philippine horror filmmaking, or rather, the standard is the worst, relying solely on loud sounds and jumpscares"
Mallari,3052,8,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,"They could've saved it with the make-up & design, but it's not enough"
Mallari,3052,9,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,"The plot twist can be seen a mile away, being able to call it out by a single scene"
Mallari,3052,10,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,"And lastly, without a doubt it's worst liability, is it's ending"
Mallari,3052,11,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,"It tries to be smart, aiming for shock value, but instead comes across as self-indulgent, and downright idiotic"
Mallari,3052,12,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,"It's a classic horror trope that thinks it's clever, but rather dumb"
Mallari,3052,13,lowwwwwwwwenz,,100.0,ltbx,"The concept and ambition is worth checking it out, but it really just can't shy away from the worst tendencies and shortcomings of Philippine horror clichés, which is a real shame as it has everything going for it to be a trailbrazer & change mainstream Philippine cinema for the better, but i guess for now, this will do, and i hope it's enough to spark more films like these"

Mallari,3054,2,maramingdada,,120.0,ltbx,the movie didn't have to rely much on jumpscares
Mallari,3054,3,maramingdada,,120.0,ltbx,the story of fr
Mallari,3054,4,maramingdada,,120.0,ltbx,mallari in itself was already chilling enough
Mallari,3054,5,maramingdada,,120.0,ltbx,"that was enough for the ""scary parts"" to revolve around it"
Mallari,3054,6,maramingdada,,120.0,ltbx,"trust me, the parts with real live humans were way scarier"
Mallari,3054,7,maramingdada,,120.0,ltbx,*that* chasing scene was even scarier
Mallari,3054,8,maramingdada,,120.0,ltbx,the jumpscares already drained the viewer's energy to the point that they can no longer react well to the parts that actually mattered
Mallari,3054,9,maramingdada,,120.0,ltbx,"overall, though, i liked the folk horror film this story became"
Mallari,3054,10,maramingdada,,120.0,ltbx,for a more historically accurate take on this i'll wait for the tv series
Mallari,3054,11,maramingdada,,120.0,ltbx,"AV-wise, everything is perfect"
Mallari,3054,12,maramingdada,,120.0,ltbx,i've become a fan of piolo and jc santos now
Mallari,3055,1,dennisthemenace,,140.0,ltbx,"A very ambitious attempt in holding a story of three generations of the Mallari clan, adding Filipino folklore as part of its speculative writing, Mallari struggles to land smoothly"
Mallari,3055,2,dennisthemenace,,140.0,ltbx,It’s a mystery/psychological thriller/folklore tale mashed into historical account of the very first Filipino serial killer
Mallari,3055,3,dennisthemenace,,140.0,ltbx,"Almost all tropes from recent horror films, such as the Insidious, The Conjuring, and even The Nun series of films, appear in this film"
Mallari,3055,4,dennisthemenace,,140.0,ltbx,"Filipino filmography-wise, it has a touch of Nocebo and Ang Mga Kaibigan Ni Mama Susan"
Mallari,3055,5,dennisthemenace,,140.0,ltbx,"Despite it being so convoluted, the film managed to deliver a horror film that showcases the talents of its ensemble—Piola Pascual cementing himself as one of the actors in the industry to not underestimate"
Mallari,3055,6,dennisthemenace,,140.0,ltbx,"Personally, these kinds of stories are my jam"
Mallari,3055,7,dennisthemenace,,140.0,ltbx,And yes gwapo si Papa P
Mallari,3056,1,charles2002,,120.0,ltbx,"The plot of this film was promising, they could've focused only on the astral projection ability of the Mallari clan and build something on that alone but what happened was, they stuffed so much subplots to cut the loose ends"
Mallari,3056,2,charles2002,,120.0,ltbx,"As the film progressed, the aswang element was added, then the caretaker element, then the curse (sisiw) inheritance, and so on"
Mallari,3056,3,charles2002,,120.0,ltbx,It became less interesting to me because of those subplots
Mallari,3056,4,charles2002,,120.0,ltbx,I was expecting it to be a psychological horror like The Shining but the subplots kind of ruined it
Mallari,3056,5,charles2002,,120.0,ltbx,"Still, this film offers something new and leaves a lot of room for discussion, there is so much to unpack"
Mallari,3056,6,charles2002,,120.0,ltbx,"Again, I really think the subplots were employed to remove the plot holes and I think they are successful in accomplishing that objective but at the expense of a better storyline"
Mallari,3057,1,patgallardo1999,,140.0,ltbx,"""Walang Diyos Sa Gabi""Mallari is a horror flick that is surprisingly good"
Mallari,3057,2,patgallardo1999,,140.0,ltbx,There are elements that you would not expected to be added in this film
Mallari,3057,3,patgallardo1999,,140.0,ltbx,It has shockingly many twists and turns in this movie
Mallari,3057,4,patgallardo1999,,140.0,ltbx,"If you thought this is a typical slasher/ serial killer movie, then think again"
Mallari,3057,5,patgallardo1999,,140.0,ltbx,The cons of the movie is many annoying and unnecessary jumpscares
Mallari,3057,6,patgallardo1999,,140.0,ltbx,The beginning is also confusing and some characters are cringe to watch but the middle point of the movie will definitely recover what they did to the beginning
Mallari,3057,7,patgallardo1999,,140.0,ltbx,"Also, the cinematography and performances of main characters is surprisingly good and it is worth to watch"
Mallari,3057,8,patgallardo1999,,140.0,ltbx,Masasabi ko lang na may pag asa pa ang pelikulang Filipino pagdating sa horror
Mallari,3057,9,patgallardo1999,,140.0,ltbx,Dapat tayo wag mawawalan ng pag asa at least we are improving and learning from the mistakes
Mallari,3057,12,patgallardo1999,,140.0,ltbx,I nominate JC Santos for Best Supporting Actor and Gloria Diaz for Best Supporting Actress char hahaha

Mallari,3162,12,amezrouuu,,160.0,ltbx,"kainis lang ending ANTANGA but still, would reco this"
Mallari,3162,13,amezrouuu,,160.0,ltbx,seryoso ako sa review na 'to dahil passionate talaga ako sa panonood ng mmff
Mallari,3162,14,amezrouuu,,160.0,ltbx,kaya sana seryosohin niyo rin 'to
Mallari,3163,1,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,"A promising concept centered on the Philippines' first serial killer who is a priest, but ultimately wasted by filling it with multiple ideas"
Mallari,3163,2,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,"The movie spans tropes from thriller, sci-fi, folklore, historical, romance, even family drama genres"
Mallari,3163,3,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,"Many interesting threads woven together, sure, but the design of this script could have been less busy so we could appreciate each one – personally, I would have liked more of a story behind the dark magic stuff so that it would be less of a twist in the final act and more of a creepy world long hidden in the shadows"
Mallari,3163,4,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,"Also, since the main character is a priest, a peek into the social climate of the church-centered 1800s provincial barrio would have been interesting (though I guess we already have Gomburza in the MMFF lineup to show us something like it)"
Mallari,3163,5,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,"This is a horror movie with high-quality visuals, so you'd think the scares should at least be good"
Mallari,3163,6,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,"But no, they're all cheap jumpscares carried by a loud score or sound"
Mallari,3163,7,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,I will admit that being in a packed theater contributes to a better viewing experience
Mallari,3163,8,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,"People were really into it, screaming at the right parts, laughing at the right parts, anticipating with bated breath the (sometimes predictable plot twists) at the right parts"
Mallari,3163,9,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,"Mostly, it's thanks to a solid cast led by Piolo Pascual as three different characters and his friend Lucas played by JC Santos"
Mallari,3163,10,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,"Technically, aside from a particularly bad CGI scene, this is a decent feat for the Philippine horror genre"
Mallari,3163,11,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,If only it were more focused
Mallari,3163,12,acebron,,100.0,ltbx,Full review here
Mallari,3164,1,jomarkrebs,,100.0,ltbx,This is just about as disappointing as Gloria Diaz’s opinion on trans women
Mallari,3165,1,punkroqu,,80.0,ltbx,"this could have been a blood-racing violent thriller or an eerie supernatural horror, but instead we got the usual overdone jumpscares and tacky cgi that takes you out of the story"
Mallari,3165,2,punkroqu,,80.0,ltbx,"we could have gotten an engaging historical fiction, but instead we got a plot twist you could see from miles away"
Mallari,3165,3,punkroqu,,80.0,ltbx,at least it gave us piolo pascual in 3 different flavors
Mallari,3166,1,lionbleu,,140.0,ltbx,"Since I'm tired of crafting an essay about this film, ilalatag ko na lang ang pros and cons for me"
Mallari,3166,2,lionbleu,,140.0,ltbx,"Pros:-The music score was amazing, at umaakma sa timing ng mga specific scenes"
Mallari,3166,3,lionbleu,,140.0,ltbx,-Yung pagkakalatag ng timeline at perspective ng 3 characters ay mahusay na nagawa at hindi lubhang nakakalito
Mallari,3166,4,lionbleu,,140.0,ltbx,"-Ang setting ng bawat timeline ay maganda tignan, walang gamit o kahit anumang bagay ang hindi nailagay na magmumukang weird sari-sariling scenes"
Mallari,3166,5,lionbleu,,140.0,ltbx,-Ang pagkakasulat sa storya ay maayos at…
Mallari,3167,1,niborquinones,,140.0,ltbx,Mallari did not fully satisfy as a horror film with its overreliance to jump scares that hinders the atmosphere-building
Mallari,3167,2,niborquinones,,140.0,ltbx,"And yes, that one scene with a full-on CGI took me out for a bit"
Mallari,3167,3,niborquinones,,140.0,ltbx,"Still, this is crazy"
Mallari,3167,4,niborquinones,,140.0,ltbx,Enjoyment of it depends on your willingness to accept whatever it throws on you
Mallari,3167,5,niborquinones,,140.0,ltbx,"Astral projection, time travel, manananggal — they are all present here and it is admirable how the film balances all of these elements, jumping from one concept to another with ease"
Mallari,3167,6,niborquinones,,140.0,ltbx,"It helps that at the center of it is Piolo Pascual delivering his most exciting performance in years, and leading a solid cast"
Mallari,3168,1,recsfromnics,,80.0,ltbx,ill never look at sisiws ever again charotedit: akala q sisiw bat naging wolf (

Mallari,3169,1,joaquindreyfus,,40.0,ltbx,it infuriates me that filipinos are so complacent with its film industry
Mallari,3169,2,joaquindreyfus,,40.0,ltbx,this movie is everything wrong with filipino films
Mallari,3169,3,joaquindreyfus,,40.0,ltbx,obviously i dont rly watch filo movies but i wanted to give this a chance
Mallari,3169,4,joaquindreyfus,,40.0,ltbx,IDK IM SO UPSET AT HOW BAD THIS MOVIE IS
Mallari,3169,5,joaquindreyfus,,40.0,ltbx,everything is so excessive and it doesnt do anything right
Mallari,3169,6,joaquindreyfus,,40.0,ltbx,they need to pay filipino creatives more so that they’re encouraged to make better things
Mallari,3169,7,joaquindreyfus,,40.0,ltbx,I HATE THIS COUNTRY
Mallari,3170,1,eishley91,,140.0,ltbx,Papa P slayed
Mallari,3171,1,heyalex,,160.0,ltbx,"Superb writing, production design, and acting"
Mallari,3171,2,heyalex,,160.0,ltbx,"Mallari opened a new path for the Filipino horror genre, despite the lack of technical effects"
Mallari,3172,1,freethinkermory,,200.0,ltbx,sarili laban sa sarili
Mallari,3173,1,lhyemarp,,120.0,ltbx,"+ Though being a Filipino horror-flick filled with cheap unearned jumpscares, the inspiration of classical Manananggal folklore, and having Philippines' first and only recorded serial killer as it's backbone, ""Mallari"" attempts to create a mythology around Fr"
Mallari,3173,2,lhyemarp,,120.0,ltbx,"Mallari and their cursed bloodline, and succeeds only because it's clear that Warner Bros"
Mallari,3173,3,lhyemarp,,120.0,ltbx,really poured money into this
Mallari,3173,4,lhyemarp,,120.0,ltbx,Plus points on it's creativity and ambition but its faults of overstaying it's welcome is prevelent
Mallari,3173,5,lhyemarp,,120.0,ltbx,"The messy pacing, editing, and story makes for a complicated albeit entertaining watch —carried by Piolo Pascual"
Mallari,3173,6,lhyemarp,,120.0,ltbx,Maybe Fr
Mallari,3173,7,lhyemarp,,120.0,ltbx,"Mallari's silhouette is enough to make this a memorable, maybe somewhat Hollywood 90s campy, horror film but, really, to hope for that is foolish"
Mallari,3173,8,lhyemarp,,120.0,ltbx,"Still, I'll consider this a step in the right direction towards a future of more and more creative, challenging, and entertaining stories"
Mallari,3173,9,lhyemarp,,120.0,ltbx,Welcome to the Philippine entertainment industry Warner Bros
Mallari,3174,1,d____r____to,,140.0,ltbx,"loved the piolo multiverse, my bias was sando piolo, who’s yours"

Mallari,3177,1,azrdl,,140.0,ltbx,"the first half was good like i loved how all the povs tie up together, that was good storytelling"
Mallari,3177,2,azrdl,,140.0,ltbx,however i fear we have lost the plot with the god-awful cgi used for the aswang arc
Mallari,3177,3,azrdl,,140.0,ltbx,the last fourth wall break kinda came in clutch

Mallari,3178,3,katchot,,200.0,ltbx,This is his best film where he truly showed his versatility as an actor
Mallari,3178,4,katchot,,200.0,ltbx,"Three characters and lahat sila may sari-sariling tindig, tingin, and kilos"

Mallari,3178,6,katchot,,200.0,ltbx,Credit of course to Derick Cabrido
Mallari,3178,7,katchot,,200.0,ltbx,I think Mallari will become the standard for psycho-thrillers in the Philippines
Mallari,3178,8,katchot,,200.0,ltbx,This will surely leave a mark in Philippine cinema
Mallari,3178,9,katchot,,200.0,ltbx,I’m looking forward to what Direk Derick Cabrido has to offer
Mallari,3179,1,zsenz,,140.0,ltbx,NOCEBO and Mallari were smoking the same blunt on this one
Mallari,3180,1,roizyrilb,,120.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual multiverse has a lot going on
Mallari,3181,1,lovejazzy,,160.0,ltbx,so good
Mallari,3181,2,lovejazzy,,160.0,ltbx,the entirety of it was just equsite and just what you expectedsome little things that bothered me a bit were that the reveal of the origin and stuff felt a bit rushed and didn't feel like it had the same dramatics that was persistent throughout the film which i expected to see there (this is a bit nitpicky i admit) and the ending felt a bit of a big fall from the energy of the climax which was just amazing
Mallari,3181,3,lovejazzy,,160.0,ltbx,BUT OVERALL just so damn amazing
Mallari,3182,1,ikalabingisa,,180.0,ltbx,pinoy horror never dies
Mallari,3183,1,jokinnie,,140.0,ltbx,"cinematography wise, it’s so good"
Mallari,3183,2,jokinnie,,140.0,ltbx,it’s also vv intense that it got me gripping my seat so hard lol
Mallari,3183,3,jokinnie,,140.0,ltbx,"i just dislike how the first half is very slow tapos sa remaining minutes parang sobrang dami nang nangyayari, kinda puts me off"
Mallari,3183,4,jokinnie,,140.0,ltbx,the pacing could’ve been better i think plus the ending was a bit let down
Mallari,3184,1,eniaaal,,140.0,ltbx,"Overall, I think the story is quite interesting"
Mallari,3184,2,eniaaal,,140.0,ltbx,"The execution though, they were trying to congest a lot of plots that loopholes were starting to emerge"
Mallari,3184,3,eniaaal,,140.0,ltbx,Still an enjoyable film
Mallari,3185,1,mikajln,,140.0,ltbx,"me na may midnight snack cravings: ""bilog ang buwan"

Mallari,3185,4,mikajln,,140.0,ltbx,malaking step up na rin 'to when it comes to filipino horror movies
Mallari,3185,5,mikajln,,140.0,ltbx,ang husay din talaga umacting ni piolo and jc
Mallari,3185,6,mikajln,,140.0,ltbx,"naloka lang ako sa pa-aswang fx, naging nanay siya ni bayani"
Mallari,3186,1,femfatalee,,140.0,ltbx,"i know they were trying to include our folklore but that one scene was so uncalled for tbh they could’ve done it better, though the storyline was good"
Mallari,3186,2,femfatalee,,140.0,ltbx,"we got to see different genres of piolo, he was creepy asl as severino"
Mallari,3186,3,femfatalee,,140.0,ltbx,"honestly the jumpscares were too predictable and has a weak build up, wished they didn’t just dropped random jumpscares"
Mallari,3186,4,femfatalee,,140.0,ltbx,"nonetheless, definitely one of my fave scenes was the bayle with her mother"
Mallari,3186,5,femfatalee,,140.0,ltbx,BANGER soundtracks and sound effects omg
Mallari,3187,1,srdd,,140.0,ltbx,It was a decent watch

Mallari,3189,1,_4tmos,,100.0,ltbx,"beautifully executed film, first part really kept me at the edge of my seat but felt like it just became dumb towards the endgets ko na yung mga nanay kung bakit sila gwapong-gwapo kay Papa P though"
Mallari,3190,1,franzhernandez7,,160.0,ltbx,So so good for a Filipino horror film
Mallari,3190,2,franzhernandez7,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, Bravo Piolo Pascual"
Mallari,3191,1,allenmollo,,140.0,ltbx,My 50th film of the year
Mallari,3191,2,allenmollo,,140.0,ltbx,"i thought the first half of this film was gripping, i liked the idea of tying three generations of Mallari’s"
Mallari,3191,3,allenmollo,,140.0,ltbx,pero nawala na ako nung may manananggal element na pati yung binhi from ‘magandang hatinggabi’
Mallari,3191,6,allenmollo,,140.0,ltbx,"ang galing ni piolo dito though, it’s giving aga muhlach in ‘sa aking mga kamay’"
Mallari,3191,7,allenmollo,,140.0,ltbx,too bad na wala halos documentation sa mga pinaslang ni fr
Mallari,3191,9,allenmollo,,140.0,ltbx,it would’ve given the film more focus
Mallari,3192,1,samami,,140.0,ltbx,"If there’s one thing I appreciated about mallari, it’s definitely the intentionality of it all"
Mallari,3192,2,samami,,140.0,ltbx,Each scene was there for a reason and the whole film was building up to a perfectly full circle
Mallari,3192,3,samami,,140.0,ltbx,Satisfying to see how it all came together but i feel like the film was too full circle that some parts were just predictable
Mallari,3192,4,samami,,140.0,ltbx,I loved how mallari explored Filipino folklore because istg mfs be sleepin on that shit
Mallari,3192,5,samami,,140.0,ltbx,The sci-fi twist was definitely interesting and I can’t say that I hated it
Mallari,3192,6,samami,,140.0,ltbx,Honestly it kept me even more interested because I wanted to see how piolo pascual’s acting would survive in a sci-fi setting lawlz
Mallari,3192,7,samami,,140.0,ltbx,Moral of the story: Ang pagibig nga naman… But also I love how the ending kinda explored something I think about at the end of the horror movies when the survivor walks off before the credits roll
Mallari,3192,8,samami,,140.0,ltbx,Coz it’s like ok you survive but what quality of life are u rlly walking into
Mallari,3192,9,samami,,140.0,ltbx,"And when the girl said in the end that he should’ve just let her die, I was like damn fax that’s what I’m saying"
Mallari,3193,1,mariaantonio,,140.0,ltbx,"piolo pascual was incredible here, i think i now get his appeal to all the titas and lolas out there"
Mallari,3193,2,mariaantonio,,140.0,ltbx,wish we’ve gotten a more focused material revolving around the story of father mallari
Mallari,3194,1,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"Mallari excels as a mystery/thriller, skillfully interweaving Fr"
Mallari,3194,2,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"Severino Mallari's story with Filipino mythology, delving into themes of love, sacrifice, and the supernatural"
Mallari,3194,3,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"For those seeking heart-pounding horror and intense scares, this might not cater to your expectations"
Mallari,3194,4,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"Piolo Pascual's outstanding portrayal of three distinct characters remains a highlight, although some supporting actors struggle to match his depth, impacting the film's overall cohesiveness"
Mallari,3194,5,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"Additionally, attempts at modern dialogue occasionally feel forced, aiming to resonate with contemporary audiences but often missing the mark"
Mallari,3194,6,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"However, it falls short in certain technical aspects, with some special effects momentarily disrupting the immersion"
Mallari,3194,7,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"Moreover, the excessive use of predictable jump scares might disappoint those seeking a more nuanced and suspenseful thriller experience"
Mallari,3194,8,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"While the narrative's non-linear structure converges effectively, some scenes in the first act might feel eye-roll-worthy"
Mallari,3194,9,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite these initial hiccups, Mallari gains momentum over time"
Mallari,3194,10,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"The clever interweaving of timelines culminates in a gripping third act, redeeming the movie's earlier flaws"
Mallari,3194,11,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"Noteworthy performances, including JC Santos's compelling contribution, complement the film's exploration of mythology and folklore"
Mallari,3194,12,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"Ultimately, Mallari remains a captivating watch for enthusiasts of intricate storytelling, showcasing Pascual's remarkable acting abilities"
Mallari,3194,13,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,"As it navigates through love, sacrifice, and the supernatural, Mallari's imperfect yet engaging portrayal leaves an indelible mark, resonating with those fascinated by the depths of human experience and the enigmatic allure of Filipino folklore"
Mallari,3194,14,pm1spicy,,160.0,ltbx,Peak Filipino cinema is back on the menu
Mallari,3195,1,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,"Mallari, the 3rd film I’ve seen this MMFF 2023"
Mallari,3195,2,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,Maybe I was expecting it to be good but it left me pretty disappointed
Mallari,3195,3,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,Pros: Sound design was pretty effective
Mallari,3195,4,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,I think JC Santos and Piolo Pascual’s acting was effective
Mallari,3195,5,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,Cons: Convoluted story made it hard to understand
Mallari,3195,6,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,"I like non-linear storytelling, but in this case, It wasn’t executed properly"
Mallari,3195,7,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,The dialogues were cringey
Mallari,3195,8,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,"Aside from JC and Piolo, the supporting cast didn’t help in elevating the movie"
Mallari,3195,9,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,I don’t know if its bad writing or the actors didn’t give the script justice
Mallari,3195,10,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,The insertion of humor is unnecessary and didn’t add anything to the table
Mallari,3195,11,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,I wish that they have stick to a specific storyline of the 1st Pinoy serial killer instead of adding storylines involving Filipino mythology and creatures
Mallari,3195,12,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,It guises itself to be complex but ended up dumbing the whole thing out
Mallari,3195,13,pilbiray,,80.0,ltbx,Visual effects could be better
Mallari,3196,1,nccampo,,60.0,ltbx,the only thing redeemable about this movie is Papa P on a tank top
Mallari,3197,1,arjaycl,,100.0,ltbx,"Ang daming gustong sabihin, pero wala namang impact"
Mallari,3197,2,arjaycl,,100.0,ltbx,I'd appreciate it more if they just focused on one timeline and on the killer aspect
Mallari,3197,3,arjaycl,,100.0,ltbx,It relies on jumpscares too much
Mallari,3197,4,arjaycl,,100.0,ltbx,The dialogues are also awkward - trying too hard
Mallari,3197,5,arjaycl,,100.0,ltbx,The acting of JC Santos was so good though
Mallari,3198,1,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"The nonlinear structure, intercutting with three different timelines, finding the connection with its sometimes steady or stagnant pacing, finds its way nowhere near home"
Mallari,3198,2,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"A must-be realization for Enrico Santos, the screenwriter"
Mallari,3198,3,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"The killing never stops, but producing a big project with magnificent visuals with, no disrespect, a very disappointing writing shall stop"
Mallari,3198,4,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"Forty-five minutes into the cinema, the film finally makes sense that the intro is trying to foreshadow — manlalakbays"
Mallari,3198,5,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,No question about it
Mallari,3198,6,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"However, the use of jump scares to prolong the first act of the film is way too traditional or 2000s"
Mallari,3198,7,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,Those do not contribute nor give any hint at all on why Piolo is in search of answers to their three generations of Mallari’s story
Mallari,3198,8,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"Admittedly, the first hour can be shortened to 15-25 minutes"
Mallari,3198,9,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,Remove the jump scares
Mallari,3198,10,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,Just do not feed anything information through visuals; then that alone is enough for the audience to feel the genre
Mallari,3198,11,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"A bummer, still, is the used dialogues to tell a piece of information about either the timeline of the present or the story of past Piolo generations"
Mallari,3198,12,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,It could have used the very evident big budget to convey information through visuals instead of throwing lines
Mallari,3198,13,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"Imagine, the film is visually pleasing and plausible, but it does not give anything or help in the progress of the plot"
Mallari,3198,14,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"Such, such a waste of opportunity"
Mallari,3198,15,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,The detour part of this journey is beauty — production visuals and cinematography
Mallari,3198,16,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,All-in production design
Mallari,3198,17,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"The worlds, as in three different timelines, are well put together"
Mallari,3198,18,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,No one dares to refute or even question its costume or the artistic choice; the use of wardrobes and prosthetics
Mallari,3198,19,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"It speaks so much about how the audience accepts the world is shown, displayed, and given to them"
Mallari,3198,20,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"Not an easy task to build a world that the audience can easily comprehend, but Mallari does it, and mind you, building THREE TIMELINES"
Mallari,3198,21,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"Moreover, the sound design and music score need recognition"
Mallari,3198,22,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"Although the need for a revisit in sound mixing due to its inconsistent loudness is a must, it still is a world-class quality"
Mallari,3198,23,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"These perfectly and exactly convey the emotion of the characters, as well as the atmosphere of different sequences"
Mallari,3198,24,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,Neither a riser nor a drone are instruments or techniques used in the film
Mallari,3198,25,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,An example is the use of bells as a score while killing the landlord in 1812
Mallari,3198,26,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,Feels bad for Piolo Pascual in a good manner
Mallari,3198,27,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,He looks exhausted by performing three characters with different distinctive personalities but conveys it justly and rightly
Mallari,3198,28,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,He may soon retire after pulling off such a performance in Mallari
Mallari,3198,29,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,No one can do that
Mallari,3198,30,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"Despite the negatives, the film counters its flaws through a good, well-thought mise-en-scene"
Mallari,3198,31,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"The job of director does well in directing, putting all together by using each department’s strengths while masquerading its lows"
Mallari,3198,32,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"In simple terms, the film is in the right hands, the right job, and the right driver"
Mallari,3198,33,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,"Writing aside due to its being subpar, all goes well"
Mallari,3198,34,yenfilmreview,,120.0,ltbx,The audience just needs to learn and get used to it
Mallari,3199,1,noodkadito,,140.0,ltbx,Mallari successfully weaved an intricate tale of horror w/ a dash of sci-fi & folklore
Mallari,3199,2,noodkadito,,140.0,ltbx,"It's heart however, which is a tale of love, is actually what prevented me 4m giving it a higher score"
Mallari,3199,3,noodkadito,,140.0,ltbx,It set back its own visual myth by excessive jump scares and didacticism
Mallari,3199,4,noodkadito,,140.0,ltbx,"Pasimplehin natin, minurder ni Enrico Santos yung sarili niyang script sa dulo with cheesy declarations na para bang bigla akong nanood ng Cathy Garcia Molina film"
Mallari,3199,5,noodkadito,,140.0,ltbx,"Yung shift gear ni Derrick Cabrido to borderline campy sa dulo eh magegets mo, ito parang tinamad o nilagnat nung sa dulo"
Mallari,3199,6,noodkadito,,140.0,ltbx,"Even though it draws inspiration from Insidious and Suspiria, it has managed to be unique and memorable"
Mallari,3199,7,noodkadito,,140.0,ltbx,"Di ba, mga ka-sisiw"
Mallari,3200,1,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,"The concept of having three generations of Mallari, delving on folklore and catholicism is the strength of this film"
Mallari,3200,2,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,Although it was based from the true story of Fr
Mallari,3200,3,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,"Severino Mallari's serial killing, it was fictionalized by creating a generation of Mallari to show how love and curse overlap over the course of time"
Mallari,3200,4,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,"Is curse inevitable, is anything done for love be justified, are the existential questions that can be seen with the acts of the three main characters"
Mallari,3200,5,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,"However, despite its good points, it has to be said that it has dumb and unnecessary parts for the sake of being called horror, like most horror films, of course"
Mallari,3200,6,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,It holds so much potential
Mallari,3200,7,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,Maybe that's why it's ambitious for wanting a lot to happen
Mallari,3200,8,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,"Glad that transitions are good in the middle because the beginning seemed shaky to me due to its overuse of jumpscares (that are, by the way, predictable)"
Mallari,3200,9,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,"Also, I see that it has to involve folklore, but does it really have to include the scene of Facunda transforming into a manananggal (just one of the many weird stuff)"
Mallari,3200,10,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,The belief of killing to save more lives is enough to incorporate it
Mallari,3200,11,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,"As to script, it's as if there's not much research on language use"
Mallari,3200,12,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,"As a Kapampangan, the sudden switch from Filipino to Kapampangan to Filipino again didn't seem natural, as if it was only used to show it explored the setting but failed nonetheless"
Mallari,3200,13,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,The usage of Tagalog as to period is a bit inappropriate as well
Mallari,3200,14,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,"Overall, the attempt to tell the story of the first serial killer in the Philippines in a creative way is something I can appreciate"
Mallari,3200,15,anjelx1,,120.0,ltbx,I just wish it's more psychological
Mallari,3201,1,nicocollantes,,140.0,ltbx,This film earns every praise
Mallari,3201,2,nicocollantes,,140.0,ltbx,"From the cinematography, direction, acting, color grading, editing, sound design, and musical score, this is unlike any Filipino horror film in recent history"
Mallari,3201,3,nicocollantes,,140.0,ltbx,"While the writing and handling of multiple timelines can sometimes feel jarring, it was redeemed by its dark tone, atmosphere, twists, and a story that feels unique and very ambitious"
Mallari,3201,4,nicocollantes,,140.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual is excellent in portraying the three lead characters
Mallari,3201,5,nicocollantes,,140.0,ltbx,"But the real surprise here is JC Santos, who gave an impressive performance as Brother Lucas"
Mallari,3201,6,nicocollantes,,140.0,ltbx,"The rest of the cast gave it their all, too"
Mallari,3201,7,nicocollantes,,140.0,ltbx,The theme song for this film by juan karlos and Quest is *chef's kiss*
Mallari,3202,1,dunkphys,,140.0,ltbx,"oh god… excellent visuals, unique non linear structure (which i liked"
Mallari,3202,2,dunkphys,,140.0,ltbx,"), and a gagging performance from piolo pascual"
Mallari,3203,1,elpepeyonce,,120.0,ltbx,"relied too much on jumpscares and story was kinda similar to nocebo however, pao orendain’s lensing and luscious cinematography is FUCKING AMAZING"

Mallari,3206,1,watchwithj,,120.0,ltbx,It was okay
Mallari,3206,2,watchwithj,,120.0,ltbx,I got lost when her mother became a manananggal
Mallari,3206,3,watchwithj,,120.0,ltbx,They could’ve maintained the eerie psycho vibes
Mallari,3206,4,watchwithj,,120.0,ltbx,So many unnecessary ghosts
Mallari,3206,5,watchwithj,,120.0,ltbx,Too many Piolos in one film
Mallari,3206,6,watchwithj,,120.0,ltbx,"Scoring is good, prod is good, cinematography is good, all actors are good"
Mallari,3207,1,mxkyla,,160.0,ltbx,would have been perfect if it wasn’t for the laughably bad cgi
Mallari,3207,2,mxkyla,,160.0,ltbx,"nevertheless, watching this gave me so much hope for ph horror films"
Mallari,3207,3,mxkyla,,160.0,ltbx,"mallari’s story, production design, scoring, and of course, piolo’s acting were all so impressive"
Mallari,3208,1,nikka_yla,,160.0,ltbx,Sayangg ng marami what it could have been if they put more thought into the story
Mallari,3208,2,nikka_yla,,160.0,ltbx,"Was scared for a few times, which is rare for me when watching Fil horror"
Mallari,3209,1,juanbonifacio,,120.0,ltbx,A loud and twisted take on the Mallari murders
Mallari,3210,1,jehon,,140.0,ltbx,the transphobia was so
Mallari,3210,2,jehon,,140.0,ltbx,"there was also this priest afraid of ""woke culture"" and getting cancelled so my brain shut down every time he was on screen lol"
Mallari,3211,1,meewars,,160.0,ltbx,"apart from the cheesy dialogue on some parts, this was actually a pretty good horror movie"
Mallari,3211,2,meewars,,160.0,ltbx,reminded me of the classic feng shui
Mallari,3211,3,meewars,,160.0,ltbx,best actor papapi and best supporting actor jc santos indeed
Mallari,3212,1,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,Padre Severino Mallari is the first document serial killer from the Philippines with 57 victims under his name
Mallari,3212,2,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,It was believed that his mother was cursed thats why Mallari resorted to unaliving to counter the black magic
Mallari,3212,3,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"What really left an impression for me from this film is the line saying, we are all Severino"
Mallari,3212,4,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,Parang sinasabi sa atin na lahat tayo ay may bersyon ng sarili nating halimaw
Mallari,3212,5,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,And this clearly seen in the movie
Mallari,3212,6,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,His mother’s curse had its own form
Mallari,3212,7,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,Years later the curse takes on a different form when it moves to its next body
Mallari,3212,8,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,And along those lines we discover how intergenerational trauma is passed on
Mallari,3212,9,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,At the same time it lets us explore the deep end of what we can do when we are pushed to the brink
Mallari,3212,10,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,How much of ourselves we are willing to sacrifice in order to save a loved one
Mallari,3212,11,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,Blurring the lines between right and wrong
Mallari,3212,12,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,At napakagaling ni Piolo Pascual having to portray 3 different characters struggling along those lines
Mallari,3212,13,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,Hindi ako as much a big fan of jump scares but i appreciate it when done well
Mallari,3212,14,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,But not so much on this movie and the sound design made it a bit more cliche
Mallari,3212,15,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"Although i greatly appreciate the score though, mas nadagdagan ang tension and atmosphere ng mga scenes na nakakatakot"
Mallari,3212,16,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"This film excels in a lot of its technical aspects, from cinematography, production design, costumes and editing"
Mallari,3212,17,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,And it makes it worth the cinema ticket to watch this on the big screen
Mallari,3212,18,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,Was really impressed at Mallari
Mallari,3212,19,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,Shoutout sa katabi ko kanina sa cinema na di ko kilala na tumalon sa kanyang upuan after one of the jump scares
Mallari,3213,1,malingwarrior,,80.0,ltbx,This movie is only a fun watch if you are in the cinema with everyone laughing and screaming
Mallari,3213,2,malingwarrior,,80.0,ltbx,Production design is also great
Mallari,3213,3,malingwarrior,,80.0,ltbx,But by itself without spoiling anything the film is both obtuse/confusing and over explained at the same time
Mallari,3213,4,malingwarrior,,80.0,ltbx,"Also it feels kinda lazy in the way it portrayed the local filipino villagers as this evil pagan force that is against the ""good"" of the catholic church and manipulates people to do evil things"
Mallari,3213,5,malingwarrior,,80.0,ltbx,It's like it wanted to show the desperation of these people and how they fight back- but decided not to resulting into this demonized portrayal of local culture and beliefs which sucks
Mallari,3214,1,nicolebeatrizs,,200.0,ltbx,Best Filipino movie I’ve ever watched
Mallari,3214,2,nicolebeatrizs,,200.0,ltbx,"I believe that it can actually compete with international movies, that’s how good of a film Mallari is"
Mallari,3214,3,nicolebeatrizs,,200.0,ltbx,Stunning performances from Piolo Pascual and JC Santos
Mallari,3214,4,nicolebeatrizs,,200.0,ltbx,They’ll definitely bag the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor award
Mallari,3215,1,veesuns,,140.0,ltbx,"+ Top-tier actong from Piolo (3 generations), Janella, Elisse, Gloria Diaz, and JC santos+ i love how they designed the setting, it was effective in making the scenario unsettling"
Mallari,3215,2,veesuns,,140.0,ltbx,"+ the arrangement of the plot+ how they added filipino lore the story, which is bagay for the theme— napaka unnecessary ng jumpscares, it would've been effective if the cgi/makeup was good, but it's not— it would have been better if they focused on the thrill instead of jumpscares— the manananggal scene and the wolf: the cgi was too cringe"
Mallari,3215,3,veesuns,,140.0,ltbx,"hope they made thought of something different, lesser cgi"
Mallari,3216,1,ferycinemafiles,,160.0,ltbx,"ganda ng story telling lalo na yung nareveal lahat ng back story dun sa timeline na nagkasama sama lahat ng generation, but there’s really something (that i can’t point out) that made me kind of lose my engagement in the movie half way thru"
Mallari,3216,2,ferycinemafiles,,160.0,ltbx,"in short, may part talaga na inantok ko ako"
Mallari,3216,3,ferycinemafiles,,160.0,ltbx,"nonetheless, napaka galing ng buong cast"
Mallari,3216,4,ferycinemafiles,,160.0,ltbx,the musical scoring was insane
Mallari,3216,5,ferycinemafiles,,160.0,ltbx,i love it so much and the cinematography is god tier
Mallari,3217,1,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,i looooved watching this pero i have a lot of totz
Mallari,3217,2,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,obviously anlaki ng budget az andaming partner/sponsor pero i think that was kind of its downfall also
Mallari,3217,3,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,"like for example dahil may pambayad, nagcast ng napakalaking star na si papa p"
Mallari,3217,4,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,i dont think this role was for him and sobrang nakulangan ako sa acting niya for 2/3 of the duration
Mallari,3217,5,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,honestly the muchachas ate him up sa mga scenes nila together
Mallari,3217,6,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,love them ang talented nila <3and then isa pa yung chemistry nila ni janella salvador
Mallari,3217,7,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,"first of all, ang weird lang kasi parang super different generations sila ng actors, and second of all wala lang talaga silang chemistry like nde ko maramdaman na totoo yung nangyayari sa screen"
Mallari,3217,8,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,tapooos finally may budget for matinding cgi and actually bet ko ang pagkagawa dun sa eyeless ghosts (literally my #1 fear) KASO ginamitan rin nila ng cgi si ms gloria diaz and di siya kasing ganda nung ghosts
Mallari,3217,9,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,feeling ko lang mas effective ang practical fx sa ganun especially since parang matandang kandila na natutunaw na ang look na habol (similar to the matanda sa X)
Mallari,3217,10,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,"seeing poor editing really takes you out of the experience :(sa screenplay side naman, i think visually, maganda ang kanyang ginawa sa larger plotline kaso yung dialogue talaga medyo nakakatanga"
Mallari,3217,11,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,hindi ko magets bakit may napakagen z na dialogue
Mallari,3217,12,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,para ba maemphasize na yun yung modern timeline
Mallari,3217,13,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,i think it would have worked without that though kasi napakaiba naman ng costume and set design ng 1940s timeline
Mallari,3217,14,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,ewan iritado lang ako sa masyadong chronically online dialogue kasi it really dates a film and kind of yun nga
Mallari,3217,15,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,takes me out of the experience
Mallari,3217,16,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,ang weird rin ng representation sa lgbt+ community
Mallari,3217,17,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,i think they were trying to be woke pero why naman ganun pagkasulat sa kanya
Mallari,3217,18,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,a flighty gay person who everyone knows is a sex worker catering to foreigners
Mallari,3217,19,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,yan pa lang naaalala ko for now so might edit pag meron pa
Mallari,3217,20,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,overall i enjoyed it pero this really would have been better with another lead actor
Mallari,3217,21,yuwondrei,,120.0,ltbx,"though some things are very similar sa The Dream Thieves by Maggie Stievfater, i think medyo original naman ang kanyang idea :)"

Mallari,3224,6,entanglemeant,,60.0,ltbx,"Spoilers below Gara nung character na trans/non-binary, equating a queer sex worker to oppressive landlords and calling them salot ng lipunan is so problematic and unnecessary"
Mallari,3225,1,onatsky,,140.0,ltbx,I could have given MALLARI a perfect score of 5 but to call it a cinematic from hell masterpiece is a big no
Mallari,3225,2,onatsky,,140.0,ltbx,The narrative seems to be my reservation here
Mallari,3225,3,onatsky,,140.0,ltbx,Not really a fan of time travel except for SOMEWHERE IN TIME where the narrative is neatly tied up and HAPLOS
Mallari,3225,4,onatsky,,140.0,ltbx,There are times that it's rather confusing and how I wish D Cabrido divided the time frame from the first time Fr MALLARI appeared in 1800s to 1940s ended with the present times

Mallari,3231,2,hereneshantal,,160.0,ltbx,it was more of folklore-ish rather than attacking the mallari plot with more of a thriller/serial killer

Mallari,3240,6,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,Its thrilling score and effective jump scares (although I wish there's more slow burn approach) make a good form that we don't usually experience in most Pinoy horror films

Mallari,3247,1,koolas,,80.0,ltbx,The concept is promising that’s why I invested my time on watching this
Mallari,3247,2,koolas,,80.0,ltbx,Little did I know the convoluted and messy plot that’s in it
Mallari,3247,3,koolas,,80.0,ltbx,"How I wish they have just focused on the elderly Mallari and his real motive behind the killings, not to the extent of feeding her Manananggal Mom"

Mallari,3249,2,craaae,,120.0,ltbx,"Would have also been nice if they let the scenes breathe and do the talking versus having the characters say everything that’s a) about to happen, b) happening, c) happened"
Mallari,3249,3,craaae,,120.0,ltbx,I don’t know if they just didn’t trust the audience to put the pieces together on their own
Mallari,3249,4,craaae,,120.0,ltbx,Kinda makes me feel sad about how filmmakers perceive their audiences
Mallari,3249,5,craaae,,120.0,ltbx,"But I could just be overthinking it lol Para naman sa themes religion/good or evil, medyo hilaw/surface din"
Mallari,3249,6,craaae,,120.0,ltbx,"Maybe not a fair comparison but because I saw how Seklusyon did it, and wish it leaned more into something more similar"

Mallari,3251,3,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,(Spoilers incoming)This almost worked
Mallari,3251,4,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,"The 1800s sequences, in particular, are the film’s shining moments"
Mallari,3251,5,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,It was creepy and almost compelling — the occult infiltrating Christianity/the oppressed tearing down the elite from the inside are proof that this should’ve been a period piece
Mallari,3251,6,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,"Still, this particular section of the film is also riddled with sins"
Mallari,3251,7,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,The crux of it (showing how Father Severino started with his murder spree) was believable but was not strong enough
Mallari,3251,8,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,"You mean, Father Severino is so downtrodden in faith that he resorted to do…that"
Mallari,3251,9,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,In one request
Mallari,3251,10,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,The film didn’t even allow the character to explore options or resist
Mallari,3251,11,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,A film about a crisis of faith
Mallari,3251,13,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,A missed opportunity
Mallari,3251,14,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,He was just a piece of this convoluted puzzle
Mallari,3251,15,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,And when his faith was shattered
Mallari,3251,16,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,No one batted an eye
Mallari,3251,17,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,His relationship with his mother wasn’t explored enough nor who Father Severino really is — again why this should’ve been a period piece that began with his childhood
Mallari,3251,18,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,"Well, this was tooled to be commercially successful and how else to fulfill that but peppering with deadly tropes — time travel, astral projection, love is also a curse shenanigans, innocent ghosts who also like scaring people for the heck of it, a dozen of jump scares, and TikTok humor"
Mallari,3251,19,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,Don’t get me wrong
Mallari,3251,20,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,This was so much fun
Mallari,3251,21,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,Especially with a packed theater
Mallari,3251,22,invadersim,,100.0,ltbx,"Mallari, unfortunately, hacked into many elements but only managed a minor cut"

Mallari,3252,2,yvonniee,,160.0,ltbx,Would give a 5 buuuut the manananggal scene was ehh
Mallari,3253,1,gabryanz,,140.0,ltbx,"from the get-go, mallari works with an interesting premise: the first documented serial killer in the country"
Mallari,3253,2,gabryanz,,140.0,ltbx,"it takes the story a step further by introducing two other timelines, with characters that interact through lucid dreaming"
Mallari,3253,3,gabryanz,,140.0,ltbx,"the story is weaved together spectacularly, as the threads among such time periods felt smooth and weren’t forced"
Mallari,3253,4,gabryanz,,140.0,ltbx,"the concept is set up nicely, providing sufficient suspense to keep one hooked throughout the movie"
Mallari,3253,5,gabryanz,,140.0,ltbx,i guess my most major issue with it is its framing…
Mallari,3254,1,amnqsia,,200.0,ltbx,we need of ph horror films like this - i think the movie's strength was that it was able to use existing information based on a real story and connect it to a fictional modern one in a way that isn't cheesy or over done- jc santos in roles like this pls
Mallari,3254,3,amnqsia,,200.0,ltbx,he did such a great job with this film and made sure everyone knew he isn't an actor that's only good in…
Mallari,3255,1,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"While it does, at points, play like a pastiche of the most well-known genre tropes (not just horror), I am willing to overlook that nature of Mallari as what we get here, beyond the clichés, is a very meaty and layered story with pensive meditations on the bounds of a person’s love and familial loyalty"
Mallari,3255,2,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"As the film was running I was thinking of how they were going to resolve the story and while I couldn’t, at the time, pinpoint how I would want the story to wrap up, I could very well list a handful of ways how I wouldn’t want the film to end and, without spoiling anything, I think they really stuck the landing with that ending"
Mallari,3255,3,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"We may have different tastes and what we look for in films may be different but, Mallari, as a whole, is a film that just works, at least for me"
Mallari,3255,4,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,I definitely recommend seeing this

Mallari,3264,2,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,This is noteworthy as I don't watch them that often
Mallari,3264,3,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"However, it is also different from what I expected"
Mallari,3264,4,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"I was anticipating something of a biopic, telling the story of the first-ever recorded PH serial killer"
Mallari,3264,5,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"The direction that the movie took was a bit different, but it's fine, as it was still interesting"
Mallari,3264,6,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"For me, the jump scares were not that effective"
Mallari,3264,7,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"Considering that it is a high-budget and relatively costly production, you would expect great ones, but most of them were just cheap jump scares carried by loud sounds"
Mallari,3264,8,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"The film also focused on too many genres, such as family, horror, comedy, and fantasy, to name a few"
Mallari,3264,9,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,I wish those concepts were not overloaded so that we could focus more on the lore
Mallari,3264,10,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"The character of Lucas (JC Santos) was not that convincing, given that he had a huge role"
Mallari,3264,11,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,It felt lackluster due to his character's development
Mallari,3264,12,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,The pacing and direction were mediocre at best
Mallari,3264,13,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"There were some highs where the theater was excited about what events might unfold next, screaming and just being hyped"
Mallari,3264,14,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"However, there were also disadvantages, such as in the first act where the film was kinda hard to follow"
Mallari,3264,15,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"On a positive note, the concept itself was enticing since it's about horror (my favorite genre), and the Philippine mythology was also showcased well"
Mallari,3264,16,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual also looked great and proved himself to be a versatile actor
Mallari,3264,17,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"His supporting cast also did really well, providing twists and more diversity"
Mallari,3264,18,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"All in all, the concept was interesting; it just was not executed to its fullest"
Mallari,3264,19,daivd_tr,,120.0,ltbx,"Elements were overloaded, and it was a bit hard to follow, but the cast was great, and the production is definitely a level up from its predecessors"

Mallari,3272,4,inksandfilms,,160.0,ltbx,Pero that’s not the focus naman of the film
Mallari,3272,5,inksandfilms,,160.0,ltbx,There are plot holes din pero I pretend that I did not see them because… Piolo Pascual
Mallari,3272,6,inksandfilms,,160.0,ltbx,"Piolo Pasucal’s acting is great, as always"
Mallari,3272,7,inksandfilms,,160.0,ltbx,You can clearly see the differences of each character that he played
Mallari,3272,8,inksandfilms,,160.0,ltbx,I really like how Piolo can show his emotions through his eyes
Mallari,3272,9,inksandfilms,,160.0,ltbx,The best
Mallari,3272,10,inksandfilms,,160.0,ltbx,"JC Santos, whom I don’t really like at all ( sorry, I might now have watched enough movies to say that I like him and his acting) I was surprised that I like his acting in this one"

Mallari,3273,1,elai_,,140.0,ltbx,Piolo did well with his Severino characters
Mallari,3273,2,elai_,,140.0,ltbx,JC Santos as Lucas too
Mallari,3273,3,elai_,,140.0,ltbx,The story itself is fast-paced and makes some crucial parts feel abrupt
Mallari,3273,4,elai_,,140.0,ltbx,Jump-scares are only sprinkles
Mallari,3273,5,elai_,,140.0,ltbx,"Special effects are a little off-putting, and it kills the scary vibe for me"

Mallari,3276,2,denlebantino,,140.0,ltbx,There are scenes where his Johnrey and his Jonathan are almost alike
Mallari,3276,3,denlebantino,,140.0,ltbx,"When his Severino and his Jonathan meet in one of the crucial scenes, the former seems to have become the latter"

Mallari,3276,11,denlebantino,,140.0,ltbx,It is JC Santos who is consistently impressive in the film
Mallari,3276,12,denlebantino,,140.0,ltbx,His evolution comes to a riveting performance deserving of recognition
Mallari,3276,13,denlebantino,,140.0,ltbx,Watch out for this one scene where he outshines his co-actor
Mallari,3276,14,denlebantino,,140.0,ltbx,The film could have done more in terms of VFX
Mallari,3276,15,denlebantino,,140.0,ltbx,"Its score could have been tempered for a more dramatic effect, but despite what the film lacks, it achieves something remarkable for the genre"
Mallari,3276,16,denlebantino,,140.0,ltbx,Enrico Santos wrote a screenplay that weaves an interesting mix of the horror and the time-travel narrative
Mallari,3276,17,denlebantino,,140.0,ltbx,The script is complemented with well-paced execution and engaging scenes
Mallari,3276,18,denlebantino,,140.0,ltbx,"Overall, Mallari is a compelling watch--a Pinoy genre film not easy to forget"

Mallari,3278,2,thejsv,,140.0,ltbx,"What got me hooked was how they spun the horror elements within a Filipino context, set against a historical backdrop"
Mallari,3278,3,thejsv,,140.0,ltbx,"Pretty refreshing, I'd say"
Mallari,3278,4,thejsv,,140.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual killed it playing different characters from various timelines

Mallari,3279,1,chynnatown,,120.0,ltbx,so much potential here if they trusted the viewer to piece the parts together instead of infodumping… gorgeous sets na underutilized imo… SAYANG TALAGA i can imagine an alternate superior version of this
Mallari,3279,2,chynnatown,,120.0,ltbx,the horror part is the worst thing here kasi it’s the typical jumpscare which detracts from the seriousness of the film
Mallari,3279,3,chynnatown,,120.0,ltbx,BUT i respect the vision and the dedication sa historical accuracy of events

Mallari,3284,3,popscicle,,160.0,ltbx,"The team behind the film Mallari took MANY liberties, and they mostly work (the use of dark folklore is particularly enticing), though one of the main conceits (an ability inherited through the character's bloodline) is rather questionable in terms of its utility and necessity"

Mallari,3286,1,princesssison,,100.0,ltbx,first film I watched from this year's mmff was a horror movie (was surprised by this decision given how talote I am)
Mallari,3286,2,princesssison,,100.0,ltbx,but yeaaa um the movie had a Lot of jumpscares and I was alternating between covering my ears and eyes because of how unnecessarily loud everything was >
Mallari,3286,3,princesssison,,100.0,ltbx,< CGI was hilariously bad and some action scenes just straight up made us laugh  idrk what to feel about the movie -- the buildup was good but its potential got lost when they started adding mythical creatures into the mix
Mallari,3286,4,princesssison,,100.0,ltbx,I was intrigued by the idea of a filipino serial killer but ofc it wouldn't be a filipino film without the element of family/tradition to it  overall it was a Meh movie and I wish they focused more on the history / setting of the real-life story it was based on
Mallari,3286,5,princesssison,,100.0,ltbx,was quite an experience watching this alongside Kapampangans because the audiences' side comments that came with how the actors spoke the language made the experience more fun  also the collective and sometimes unnecessary screaming on the side HAHAHA

Mallari,3290,1,dulcineapx,,80.0,ltbx,"Mallari was one of the most anticipated films for this year’s MMFF — so much potential with its great actors, interesting premise, and production; only for it to end up a disappointment with its lackluster jump scares and twist after twist that seemingly didn’t enhance the storyline"
Mallari,3290,2,dulcineapx,,80.0,ltbx,Don’t get me wrong — JC deserved the best supporting actor recognition and the score by De Guzman; wish it wasn’t such a disappointment

Mallari,3293,1,ctheat,,80.0,ltbx,"Before I start this review, I'd like to point out that the main point of my critique may come off as confusing for most since I'm well aware that a good factor of horror is that it is supposed to be excessive"
Mallari,3293,2,ctheat,,80.0,ltbx,"Whether this excessiveness leads to successfully scaring the viewers or it leads into this camp-y road of corniness is up to the viewers to judge— in my own personal opinion, it was very much the latter"
Mallari,3293,3,ctheat,,80.0,ltbx,This movie…
Mallari,3294,1,riverkieran,,80.0,ltbx,Ugliest script I've seen this year
Mallari,3294,2,riverkieran,,80.0,ltbx,I don't think this movie knows what tf kind of movie did it want to make nor do they know exactly the story it wants to tell
Mallari,3294,3,riverkieran,,80.0,ltbx,This kind of horror movie would've sold in the late 2000s to early 2010s but now the style and direction this movie had is pretty outdated
Mallari,3294,4,riverkieran,,80.0,ltbx,"Two stars because the cast, save for Gloria Diaz, was actually pretty good; the script isn't their fault"
Mallari,3294,5,riverkieran,,80.0,ltbx,"I've seen Janella Salvador's acting and coming from watching GomBurZa earlier in the day I know Piolo Pascual was awesome in that one, but no amount of acting talent can save a terrible script and story"

Mallari,3299,2,ljcap,,180.0,ltbx,One of the best horror films I have ever watched
Mallari,3299,3,ljcap,,180.0,ltbx,It is a three-timeline story that is all being connected by a single superstition
Mallari,3299,4,ljcap,,180.0,ltbx,The story revolves around Fr
Mallari,3299,5,ljcap,,180.0,ltbx,"Severino Mallari, a true-to-life priest from Pampanga in 1812 and is the first ever documented serial killer in the Philippines"
Mallari,3299,6,ljcap,,180.0,ltbx,"Then fictional characters Johnrey Mallari, a documentarist in 1948, and Jonathan Mallari, a doctor in the present day"
Mallari,3300,1,kristana,,120.0,ltbx,"The commendable cinematography paints a visually arresting landscape, showcasing a keen eye for detail in every scene"
Mallari,3300,2,kristana,,120.0,ltbx,"However, the film's occasional dependence on excessively loud sounds for an eerie effect raises concerns about its subtlety and may potentially overpower the audience's senses"
Mallari,3300,3,kristana,,120.0,ltbx,"While the narrative unfolds, numerous unnecessary jump scares seem to be sprinkled throughout"
Mallari,3300,4,kristana,,120.0,ltbx,"The inclusion of cheesy dialogue exchanges between Agnes and Jonathan, these moments, rather than enhancing the story, feel gratuitous and detract from the overall viewing experience"
Mallari,3300,5,kristana,,120.0,ltbx,"Despite these drawbacks, this film manages to reach a level of acceptability"
Mallari,3300,6,kristana,,120.0,ltbx,"However, there are certain parts that leave some viewers questioning the subtlety of its approach"
Mallari,3300,7,kristana,,120.0,ltbx,"Undoubtedly, Johnrey is my bias"
Mallari,3300,8,kristana,,120.0,ltbx,"He's the only one tunay, palaban, at makabayan <3[By the way, opting for a late-night cinema screening at 10:45 PM added a dimension to the viewing experience"
Mallari,3301,1,junmendoza,,140.0,ltbx,"Mallari highly delivered the fright taking this historically accurate character and building this disturbing world that bridges both ""sci-fi"" and Philippine folklore"
Mallari,3301,2,junmendoza,,140.0,ltbx,It had the mass appeal of a true horror flick (including the character's dumb decisions) but still made sure that there were no loose ends
Mallari,3301,3,junmendoza,,140.0,ltbx,"Even with these merits, it suffered a few mishaps"
Mallari,3301,4,junmendoza,,140.0,ltbx,"In the performances, Piolo did his best portraying these three separate individuals from different timelines but it did not help that JC Santos outacted him in almost all of their scenes together"
Mallari,3301,5,junmendoza,,140.0,ltbx,The 3 characters also needed a bit more distinction but still a commendable performance nonetheless
Mallari,3301,6,junmendoza,,140.0,ltbx,But probably the biggest blunder is how it was overscored
Mallari,3301,7,junmendoza,,140.0,ltbx,The source material I believe can shine by itself without us being dictated by the score on where to get scared
Mallari,3301,8,junmendoza,,140.0,ltbx,"And the ""manananggal"" too was a choice"

Mallari,3345,5,kaarujon,,180.0,ltbx,The acting is superb; Piolo is exceptional in his portrayal of the three Mallaris
Mallari,3345,6,kaarujon,,180.0,ltbx,"His short portrayal of the demonic hallucinations, though, was chef's kiss"
Mallari,3345,7,kaarujon,,180.0,ltbx,"The screenplay kept me thinking about how the movie would end, even until the last 5 minutes"
Mallari,3345,8,kaarujon,,180.0,ltbx,"My main takeaway from this movie is that peace as a goal, when achieved by killing socially undesirable people, is diabolical"
Mallari,3345,9,kaarujon,,180.0,ltbx,"And while we may have our own personal thoughts of unaliving bad people for the sake of a better society, it is our demons that are speaking for us"
Mallari,3345,10,kaarujon,,180.0,ltbx,"Fundamentally, the movie is a satirical expression of our human follies, including extreme desire, sanctimony, and lack of good judgement"

Mallari,3348,15,jikookiesncream,,180.0,ltbx,The film may remind one of Luca Guadagnino’s Bones and All (2022) with its presence of common themes such as gore and manslaughter
Mallari,3348,16,jikookiesncream,,180.0,ltbx,"It is also important to note how both Carido and Guadagnino have commonly used manslaughter as a dark metaphor for love as a motive of sacrifice and self-discovery, which the former has executed very well and evidently in Mallari (2023)"
Mallari,3348,17,jikookiesncream,,180.0,ltbx,"It also bears similarities with Edgar Wright’s Last Night in Soho (2021) not just with the presence of gore and manslaughter, but also with the key theme of time travel, which the two Mallari descendants have used in order to learn about the dark secret of their family for this film"
Mallari,3348,18,jikookiesncream,,180.0,ltbx,"The film had a well-organized flow of events, as well as a smooth transition in between time periods"

Mallari,3348,21,jikookiesncream,,180.0,ltbx,"Another thing to love about this film is that not only did it have Gothic themes and the use of the Catholic faith, which are associated as Western literary and cultural elements, but it also incorporated the use of Filipino folk medicine and faith healing, which are indigenous Filipino cultural elements, as important parts of the film"
Mallari,3348,22,jikookiesncream,,180.0,ltbx,"In conclusion, Mallari (2023) was a great watch, and it definitely deserved the accolades"

Mallari,3392,6,bluedesvus,,100.0,ltbx,They feel more like Uncle-Niece whenever they're together
Mallari,3392,7,bluedesvus,,100.0,ltbx,"And although, it's been instilled multiple times that Jonathan (Piolo) is obsessed with Agnes (Janella), I still don't feel it"
Mallari,3392,8,bluedesvus,,100.0,ltbx,Like they were not able to translate it on screen

Mallari,3392,11,bluedesvus,,100.0,ltbx,I think this could've been great as a series rather than a movie to fully tackle what they wanted to portray

Mallari,3393,3,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"I liked it just because I love Piolo Pascual and JC Santos (most of all JC, but let's talk about that later) but I gotta admit storytelling of this has lots of room to improve"
Mallari,3393,4,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,It had a lot of jumpscares from ghosts that didn't lead to anywhere
Mallari,3393,5,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"I expected some payoff on the ghosts other than who they were, which was obvious on the getgo"
Mallari,3393,6,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"When it was a slasher horror by the first act I was engaged gotta admit, but when the second act started and the time-traveling sci-fi direction went on the film kinda lost me"
Mallari,3393,7,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"And when it went more fantastical by the third act by introducing witchcraft and a literal ""manananggal"" it lost me completely"
Mallari,3393,8,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"As this is inspired from real events, I wish they just added upon the plot inspiration since that is an interesting story itself"
Mallari,3393,9,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"I was just put-off on the closing title cards where they debunked their own story just to clarify the real story, because it kind of defeated the film"
Mallari,3393,10,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,I feel like they accepted that the past 2 hours were fictional but then opening titles said it was inspired from true events
Mallari,3393,11,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,On the brighter side I saw a LOT of improvements here
Mallari,3393,12,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"Color grade was stellar, and lighting design"
Mallari,3393,13,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"Night scenes were still visible (ehem hollywood for making night scenes literal darkness), also the VFX and make-up for the spirits were BEAUTIFUL, the ""manananggal"" part, not so much"

Mallari,3393,17,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"Also, Piolo Pascual delivered on different nuances of different eras which made his performance very distinct"
Mallari,3393,18,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"Without reintroducing who is who even with change of wardrobe, I knew who he was just by posture and speech"
Mallari,3393,19,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"But what impressed me more is JC Santos, both sides of the coin in the soft-spoken to the gnarly side he delivered"
Mallari,3393,20,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,The plot twist was underwhelming but his performance gave it a bit of value added
Mallari,3393,21,kuyaed,,120.0,ltbx,"Addendum:One dialogue didn't sit with me after they killed off Didi, it's along the lines of: ""She's a sex worker, she's a plague to society"""

Mallari,3394,2,bjtfaj,,140.0,ltbx,Using local history and folklore always gives a unique touch to a film; Mallari even highlights JC Santos (who plays Lucas) using his Kapampangan fluency

Mallari,3400,1,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,"Watched during the 2023 Metro Manila Film FestivalIf someone caught me being m*rdered by Piolo Pascual, then that's on ME, do NOT arrest him"
Mallari,3400,2,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,"Went into this thinking it would be a retelling or highlighting the murders or the actual Severino Mallari's process as a serial killer, so that one bit admittedly let me down, but I'm aware that's a me problem"
Mallari,3400,3,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,"*That aside, wow what a film"
Mallari,3400,4,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,I truly went into it blind and admittedly I am not a fan of horrors so this is your pass to bash me or just take what I say with a grain of salt
Mallari,3400,5,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,"I am a fan of the time-travelling aspect, so I appreciated seeing that in the film"
Mallari,3400,6,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,"It was really interesting to see the ties between two distant pasts and the present entwined with family ties, fate, withcraft and all that"
Mallari,3400,7,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,I loved it
Mallari,3400,8,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,"I think that Piolo was fucking amazing in his triple roles, we are so blessed to have him in such a role on the big screen today"
Mallari,3400,9,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,"JC Santos truly deserved his Best Supporting Actor win, he is truly insane in this"
Mallari,3400,10,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,"It's kinda unfortunate the jumpscare horror elements did not really lead to anything, I feel the film could've made do with less of that or made these horror elements mean something than just cheap thrills"
Mallari,3400,11,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,"To me, those bits just hindered the atmosphere-building and it bothered me"
Mallari,3400,12,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,It was a bit funny to me too though that the scenes that garnered most audience reaction were scenes that just involved people
Mallari,3400,13,goromajima,,140.0,ltbx,"I am also not a big fan of the ending, but I'll keep it at that for you to discover if you, dear reader, will like it or not"

Mallari,3405,1,edriaaaann,,120.0,ltbx,"I actually like how they sequenced the film; it's good, but the pacing is kinda slow I would say"
Mallari,3405,2,edriaaaann,,120.0,ltbx,"The cinematography and score are also great, but there's one particular scene that makes me wanna jump off a cliff—it's THAT BAD"
Mallari,3405,3,edriaaaann,,120.0,ltbx,"Well, the cast ATE no pun intended"
Mallari,3405,4,edriaaaann,,120.0,ltbx,"Overall, a decent entry for the 2023 MMFF"
Mallari,3406,1,wilyfreddie,,80.0,ltbx,The characters definitely lacked character motivation
Mallari,3406,2,wilyfreddie,,80.0,ltbx,The decision taken by them was unbelievable or unjustified
Mallari,3406,3,wilyfreddie,,80.0,ltbx,I just don't feel any strong emotional connection with the characters that would make me understand why the did what
Mallari,3406,4,wilyfreddie,,80.0,ltbx,The film was also packed with a bunch of cheap scares with unnecessary sound effects
Mallari,3406,5,wilyfreddie,,80.0,ltbx,You could even make it more scarier if they just removed the sound effects
Mallari,3406,6,wilyfreddie,,80.0,ltbx,Great acting and cinematography though
Mallari,3407,1,seantimothy,,140.0,ltbx,"Although the non-linear editing of this complex story did not produce a cohesive plot, the movie was carried by its cinematography, musical score and the excellent performances from the Piolo Pascual and JC Santos"
Mallari,3407,2,seantimothy,,140.0,ltbx,"It successfully incorporated Philippine folklore to the horror genre, but I would have appreciated it more if the impact of religion was further explored, similar to Seklusyon"
Mallari,3407,3,seantimothy,,140.0,ltbx,"The jump scares were good, however, the reveal of twists after twists made the final act difficult to digest"

Mallari,3411,3,targrod,,180.0,ltbx,"The genre mechanics became as polarized and those who found value in it, cared no less and the silliness is a great add-on to its narrative"
Mallari,3411,4,targrod,,180.0,ltbx,The thematic journey of defeatist films always has a lot to say about bad decisions and the value of good as non-existent

Mallari,3411,6,targrod,,180.0,ltbx,"Said film excessively warns the audience about the eventual demise of the couple, the acceptance of one's fate just sets in"
Mallari,3411,7,targrod,,180.0,ltbx,"Mallari though, tries to fight back with its barbs and your usual good should always win over evil"
Mallari,3411,8,targrod,,180.0,ltbx,It's funny that the whole point of the film had an underlying message that is extremely familiar in the recent and current political climate in the Philippines
Mallari,3411,9,targrod,,180.0,ltbx,"The characters are represented by people, factions, and the entire nation"
Mallari,3411,10,targrod,,180.0,ltbx,It's a sight for social media and fantasy for the optimist

Mallari,3428,2,ccsediaren,,140.0,ltbx,"While we barely even learn of the true origins of the titular character, it’s the production value that really makes the film great, from the visuals, prod design, scoring, and what is probably Piolo Pascual in his best role(s) yet"
Mallari,3428,3,ccsediaren,,140.0,ltbx,"Despite its setbacks (and unnecessary homophobia/transphobia), Mallari’s production remains to be an impressive standard Filipino cinema should aspire to continue"
Mallari,3429,1,mrsummerpurns,,100.0,ltbx,"Not much is known about priest Juan Severino Mallari, said to be the Philippines' first and only serial killer, but that was all it took to create a feature film for the Metro Manila Film Festival"
Mallari,3429,2,mrsummerpurns,,100.0,ltbx,"""Mallari"" (2023) won four awards at this year's Gabi ng Parangal — 3rd Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for JC Santos, Best Musical Score, and Best Visual Effects — and of those four it is the latter that appears unconvincing"
Mallari,3429,3,mrsummerpurns,,100.0,ltbx,"No doubt that win is attributed to scenes in the latter part of the film as the so-called mystery unravels, but these effects come off as cheesy like the initial jumpscares that build the film"
Mallari,3429,4,mrsummerpurns,,100.0,ltbx,"The score by Von De Guzman can be forceful and insistent at times, but it gradually allows the film's horror structure to take charge"
Mallari,3429,5,mrsummerpurns,,100.0,ltbx,"However Santos' win is fully well-deserved, an extreme compliment as most of his scenes are with the more seasoned Piolo Pascual and yet he manages to give his character a believable descent"
Mallari,3429,6,mrsummerpurns,,100.0,ltbx,That is not to be hard on Pascual though as he is given the task of juggling three different characters; his charm just happens to be too strong for this foray into horror
Mallari,3429,7,mrsummerpurns,,100.0,ltbx,"There is one scene though where Pascual's dramatic chops shine so bright, and it is during a silent reckoning with his actions as he dances with Gloria Diaz's Facunda, she too committed to the cause of her character"
Mallari,3429,8,mrsummerpurns,,100.0,ltbx,"Mallari's story is undoubtedly an intriguing one to tackle, however Enrico Santos' screenplay doesn't do enough to fully utilize that premise and the plotline he decides on"

Mallari,3430,1,japacastro,,100.0,ltbx,"I can sum it up as “all style, little substance”"
Mallari,3430,2,japacastro,,100.0,ltbx,"Technically, this is a great looking film"
Mallari,3430,3,japacastro,,100.0,ltbx,The cinematography (my fave part of the movie are the transitions
Mallari,3430,4,japacastro,,100.0,ltbx,"), the styling, the sets, the grading, the SFX, visually the movie really is on point"
Mallari,3430,5,japacastro,,100.0,ltbx,"However, the movie literally tried to do too much with so many different horror elements coming up that everything felt half baked"
Mallari,3430,6,japacastro,,100.0,ltbx,A slasher with a priest turning evil
Mallari,3430,8,japacastro,,100.0,ltbx,Three different characters from three different time periods and how they are connected
Mallari,3430,10,japacastro,,100.0,ltbx,"But when all the supernatural stuff came in, the movie went so overboard with the story that it went nowhere"
Mallari,3430,11,japacastro,,100.0,ltbx,But if you wanna watch Piolo Pascual being hot af x3
Mallari,3430,12,japacastro,,100.0,ltbx,Go watch it
Mallari,3431,1,12mncereal,,80.0,ltbx,ayusin ko lang review ko guys…
Mallari,3432,1,dennisperez,,80.0,ltbx,"Instead of an interesting exploration of the Philippines' only priest-turned-serial killer, MALLARI devolves into a convolution of time travel, astral projection, and local folklore"
Mallari,3432,2,dennisperez,,80.0,ltbx,It misses to touch on the dark psyche of what could have been a good subject in film
Mallari,3432,3,dennisperez,,80.0,ltbx,The use of horror and jump scares get in the way of the narrative; pulling the audience farther from what could have been a real terror: that of serial killer in an institution Filipinos revere
Mallari,3433,1,awriirey,,120.0,ltbx,ok but jc santos as a killer
Mallari,3434,1,muttsunone,,140.0,ltbx,A unique story that is a breath of fresh air for us pinoy horror fans
Mallari,3434,2,muttsunone,,140.0,ltbx,I also like how the film uses scoring to amplify its horror scenes— much like a lot of slasher films in the 80s
Mallari,3434,3,muttsunone,,140.0,ltbx,I would like to see more about how Mallari did the killings
Mallari,3434,4,muttsunone,,140.0,ltbx,"Also, it can be too much since there are a lot of backstories but nevertheless, I enjoyed the juxtaposition of local folklore and sci-fi"
Mallari,3434,5,muttsunone,,140.0,ltbx,This makes it more enjoyable to watch compared to its competitors this year
Mallari,3435,1,sams3pi0l_,,120.0,ltbx,the plot was so predictable
Mallari,3435,2,sams3pi0l_,,120.0,ltbx,i thought the premise had so many potential to become more historical but the plot became a let down
Mallari,3435,3,sams3pi0l_,,120.0,ltbx,the lines were too cheesy and the details were in-your-face
Mallari,3435,4,sams3pi0l_,,120.0,ltbx,"the CGI was okay, borderline bad"
Mallari,3435,5,sams3pi0l_,,120.0,ltbx,there's this frame that piolo's face overlapped with the CGI
Mallari,3435,6,sams3pi0l_,,120.0,ltbx,the musical scoring is good though

Mallari,3443,2,sigmagosling69,,160.0,ltbx,"Mallari is a film with three different storylines that met halfway and were easy to follow because the writing, direction, acting, and cinematography were all spot on"
Mallari,3443,3,sigmagosling69,,160.0,ltbx,I absolutely loved it
Mallari,3443,4,sigmagosling69,,160.0,ltbx,The effects were still a little bit wonky but that was only a small part of the film
Mallari,3443,5,sigmagosling69,,160.0,ltbx,"There were three scenes in particular that made me fall in love with the film, but I won't write them here as this is a spoiler-free review"
Mallari,3443,6,sigmagosling69,,160.0,ltbx,"My final thoughts are that I would definitely watch this again, it was all executed beautifully"

Mallari,3458,3,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,i had the chance to watch this on big screen
Mallari,3458,4,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,"don't get me wrong, this movie is good and all it's glory"
Mallari,3458,5,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,but why 2½/5
Mallari,3458,6,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,"storyline wise, great"
Mallari,3458,7,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,couldn't say anything more other than the fact that the transition from different generations was seamless
Mallari,3458,9,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,absolutely yes
Mallari,3458,10,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,"perfect color grading that matches the theme, not like those very muted filters they put on films"
Mallari,3458,12,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,"honestly, wasn't very amazed with it"
Mallari,3458,13,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,"it's only my opinion, and i love judging other people's acting performance as if i'm a professional critic"
Mallari,3458,14,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,"i'm not sure if it's because the dialogue/script, because i felt awkwardness when they're saying their lines"
Mallari,3458,15,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,"but then again, it's piolo's first horror movie, so there is still room for improvement if he wanted to continue this path (i would honestly support him 'cause he's such a beaut on screen)"
Mallari,3458,16,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,jc was phenomenal
Mallari,3458,17,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,such a versatile actor
Mallari,3458,18,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,sound design

Mallari,3458,20,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,can't get enough of it
Mallari,3458,21,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,they did an amazing job choosing bgmusic/sounds
Mallari,3458,22,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,kudos for that
Mallari,3458,23,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,was it scary
Mallari,3458,24,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,"wouldn't say so, coming from someone who doesn't get scared easily (i do, but only for movies that has exorcism involved in it lol, i always feel like i'm gonna be possessed too)"
Mallari,3458,25,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,"the amount of unnecessary jumpscare is sending me off, there's that one scene that felt like my soul left me, other than that, i ended up predicting what's gonna come next (cause i like doing that, to minimize the jumpscare effect lol)"
Mallari,3458,26,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,"anyway, this is still worth watching"
Mallari,3458,27,ishidotgeee,,100.0,ltbx,"i hope this movie will open up for more international collaboration (imagine my surprise when i saw "" warner bros' "" on the opening scene)"

Mallari,3461,3,plasticd0ll,,160.0,ltbx,"its always described as a ""purging of emotions"", which i think is a really hard way to understand and explain it"
Mallari,3461,4,plasticd0ll,,160.0,ltbx,"so isa sa interpretation ko since then was that its just a fancy way to say ""payoff"" sa plot"

Mallari,3463,2,lemongaab,,120.0,ltbx,"Kidding, it's not fair to the movie to talk about it on the basis of comparisons"
Mallari,3463,3,lemongaab,,120.0,ltbx,"The themes are certainly there: generational trauma represented by haunted houses, reflections of the past present and future, and a mangled commentary on class politics"
Mallari,3463,4,lemongaab,,120.0,ltbx,"This was admittedly poorly paced, like a run-on sentence"
Mallari,3463,5,lemongaab,,120.0,ltbx,"I wish prestige TV was a thing locally because this would have been better fleshed out in a 7-9 episode miniseries, a la The Terror or 1899"
Mallari,3463,6,lemongaab,,120.0,ltbx,The poor pacing resulted in what should have been an interesting premise and strong themes turned to a hodgepodge of ideas
Mallari,3463,7,lemongaab,,120.0,ltbx,"Gorgeously produced and well acted, but with way too much fat to trim off"
Mallari,3463,8,lemongaab,,120.0,ltbx,"But like I said in my Smaller and Smaller Circles review, if this paves the way for more serial killer themed local media, let's get at it"

Mallari,3496,1,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,Mallari is a pretty ambitious film
Mallari,3496,2,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"It's a slasher, also a sci-fi because of the time travel aspect and also a period piece"
Mallari,3496,3,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"It's a fictionalized story about Severino Mallari, a parish priest in Pampanga who is the first Filipino serial killer"
Mallari,3496,4,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"First, I just wanna say that the visuals were pretty amazing"
Mallari,3496,5,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"As a horror fan, I'm glad to say that we are now catching up"
Mallari,3496,6,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"Andaming magagandang ideas at concepts sa mga local horror films natin, di nalang tayo paulit-ulit"
Mallari,3496,7,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,Praise-worthy ang cinematography and production design dito
Mallari,3496,8,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"The score is amazing, it really fits to the tone of the film"
Mallari,3496,9,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"Piolo Pascual really did served, one of his best performances, I like it when he plays characters outside his comfort zone"
Mallari,3496,10,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"Also JC Santos is pretty good here, he really deserves that best supporting actor award"
Mallari,3496,11,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"First time ko rin na mapanood si Janella Salvador sa big screen, finally she's in a horror movie that doesn't suck"
Mallari,3496,12,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,The film does fall into the usual horror cliches unfortunately
Mallari,3496,13,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"First, the jumpscares, there are so many jumpscares here that are just so unnecessary"
Mallari,3496,14,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"Ghosts appearing left and right accompanied by a loud sound, without any purpose or significance with the story and most of the time, they are just so predictable"
Mallari,3496,15,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"Di naman kasi nakakatakot ang gulat eh, hinay hinay lang din sa paggamit"
Mallari,3496,16,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,I also have problems with the script
Mallari,3496,17,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,It does overexplain a lot to the audiences
Mallari,3496,18,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"A noticed a lot of exposition scenes, this film is not for children, please let the audience think and piece together the mystery themselves or just show don't tell"
Mallari,3496,19,cinephileckurt,,120.0,ltbx,"Mallari is an enjoyable horror film with a pretty unique concept, despite doing too much, there are many things here that you will appreciate and as a horror fan, this MMFF is a great start to finally make original and good pinoy horror films"

Mallari,3501,1,polaris21,,140.0,ltbx,"Although the modern day killer is a subtly hinted at in the beginning, the unfolding of events by the end of the film shows great promise in mixing things up on the horror genre in the country"
Mallari,3501,2,polaris21,,140.0,ltbx,"Adding some sci-fi elements (although not new concepts) and modern day language (that sparked laughter at times) also proved to work in favor of this film, in its attempt to differentiate itself from other period horror films in the PH"

Mallari,3507,1,mundingsalao,,120.0,ltbx,"Initially, I found myself being quite nitpicky and complaining about a couple of minor details, visuals, jump scares and effects choices"
Mallari,3507,2,mundingsalao,,120.0,ltbx,"But as the movie progressed, it grew on me and eventually captured my full insatiable attention"
Mallari,3507,3,mundingsalao,,120.0,ltbx,The story pretty much revels in its intruiging mystery
Mallari,3507,4,mundingsalao,,120.0,ltbx,It's bold and deliciously insidious
Mallari,3507,5,mundingsalao,,120.0,ltbx,Its wicked irreverence reminds me of films like The Omen and Rosemary's Baby
Mallari,3507,6,mundingsalao,,120.0,ltbx,Piolo taking on the three roles reminds us of how talented he is as an actor and is pretty much capable of stretching his range
Mallari,3507,7,mundingsalao,,120.0,ltbx,The music is powerful and tickles the horror fan in me with how much it effectively marinated the movie
Mallari,3507,8,mundingsalao,,120.0,ltbx,"MALLARI has a spectacular appeal that I enjoyed, and I was also glad to hear, once more, loud screams and reactions from horror cinema audiences"
Mallari,3507,9,mundingsalao,,120.0,ltbx,"In a really good way, it reminds me of those great Pinoy horror comicbooks from the good old days"

Mallari,3509,1,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,Short Review: Ang Alamat ng DinuguanI like it but not wholly - I think the two major plot concept of the film didn’t gel well for me
Mallari,3509,2,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,"Actually, more of they can go separately as I wished this was more of a psychological thriller than a fictional thriller"
Mallari,3509,3,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,Some thoughts:- Cast was on the spot
Mallari,3509,4,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,Everyone was really good - even the side characters
Mallari,3509,5,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,And they felt more fleshed out than I expected
Mallari,3509,6,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,- Plot was good … till it wasn’t
Mallari,3509,7,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,But there were really good direction here but somewhere somehow it became off
Mallari,3509,8,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,I think when it was started to do expositions
Mallari,3509,9,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,- There were too on the nose lines and on the nose scenes
Mallari,3509,10,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,The blanket realization irked me the most as it was obvious but the lead had to have a line for it
Mallari,3509,11,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,- Production overall was well made - but I don’t know why but PH media (regardless whether high budget or low) felt cramped/limited
Mallari,3509,12,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,It’s like the invisible wall in video games that makes it feel small
Mallari,3509,13,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,"With that said, this had potential and I thoroughly enjoyed it"
Mallari,3509,14,yupeh,,140.0,ltbx,It will probably be one of my fave MMFF movies this 2023
Mallari,3510,1,saetori,,20.0,ltbx,I dunno if we watched the same movie based on you guys' rating but this was the biggest bullshit i've ever seen
Mallari,3511,1,jeffencinas,,100.0,ltbx,okay lang na pangit second half may ka-holding hands naman ako
Mallari,3512,1,imata,,120.0,ltbx,it was good but the manananggal scene happened
Mallari,3513,1,amarilyo,,140.0,ltbx,"watching horror movies with a big audience just never fails to be really fun, which kind of saved the film for me"
Mallari,3513,2,amarilyo,,140.0,ltbx,the score was just immersing and was almost another character in itself
Mallari,3513,3,amarilyo,,140.0,ltbx,"the cinematography was also stunning, historical dramas have this cheat code of being able to use so much warm light from candles and windows that makes any scene beautiful (i also just personally adore warm lighting)"
Mallari,3513,4,amarilyo,,140.0,ltbx,however its shortcomings really come from the script
Mallari,3514,1,chaosbringer,,200.0,ltbx,In my fleabag era
Mallari,3515,1,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,lucas is queer coded
Mallari,3515,2,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,a fellow moviegoer pointed this out and i agree
Mallari,3515,3,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,don't tell me he didn't at least like jonathan
Mallari,3515,4,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,"i mean, even if you were straight, you'd question kasi si papa p na 'yan eh"
Mallari,3515,5,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,years and years of friendship and he's always there for him
Mallari,3515,6,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,"went with jonathan to pampanga in a heartbeat, and forgave him just as quick as well"
Mallari,3515,7,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,hated gays but that's the internalized homophobia talking (probably went to a seminary to pray the gay away)
Mallari,3515,8,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,"and when the opportunity struck, wanted to kill his gf"
Mallari,3515,9,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,and the betrayal scene
Mallari,3515,10,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,"(also: jc santos, you are sent from the heavens above) yeah, it's not platonic for lucas"
Mallari,3515,11,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,wanting to continue his bloodline's vow is a less compelling motivation
Mallari,3515,13,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,just because
Mallari,3515,14,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,not really explained
Mallari,3515,15,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,but it's giving master x slave
Mallari,3515,16,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,him being gay is a much more compelling reason
Mallari,3515,17,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,"like dude admit it, you're in love with him and want to be with him"
Mallari,3515,18,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,but that's just a theory
Mallari,3515,19,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,a film theory
Mallari,3515,21,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,—real review:i hated how jonathan never learned
Mallari,3515,22,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,he had the choice to break generational curse for both families but didn't
Mallari,3515,23,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,he chose pussy over allat (same)i wish they simplified the story a bit more because it gets a bit busy
Mallari,3515,24,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,and i agree with some reviewers this would've been better as a crime/thriller and you can even put supernatural in the mix but not horror (i can say the same for some horror films in the ph)but great acting from piolo and jc
Mallari,3515,25,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,expected performance from janella
Mallari,3515,26,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,and gloria diaz
Mallari,3515,27,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,she was not acting
Mallari,3515,28,natjmd,,120.0,ltbx,great set design as well
Mallari,3516,1,xynema,,160.0,ltbx,liked it lots
Mallari,3516,2,xynema,,160.0,ltbx,intrigued from the plot / trailer alone
Mallari,3516,3,xynema,,160.0,ltbx,the way they explored fr
Mallari,3516,4,xynema,,160.0,ltbx,"mallari's story was really interesting, something i've never really seen before; the time-travelling aspects introduced a sci-fi twist to the collonial piece that made it more  for me"
Mallari,3516,5,xynema,,160.0,ltbx,"questionable sfx and prosthetics aside, the demonic / cult-ish plotline entwined with the religious main character really did it for me"
Mallari,3516,6,xynema,,160.0,ltbx,the ending was unsatisfactory from an audience standpoint as in nairita ako kay jonathan but i love u janella salvador u're so girlboss demonyita slayyy (literally) she ate (literally)
Mallari,3517,1,andie_mov,,100.0,ltbx,it gets to a certain point where everything in this felt like a plot twist cause i walked into this blind so what the heyll
Mallari,3518,1,mgz_png,,120.0,ltbx,“obsessed ka ba sakin
Mallari,3518,2,mgz_png,,120.0,ltbx,” lol
Mallari,3519,1,chuboobster,,80.0,ltbx,Carried in large part by the breathtaking performances of Piolo Pascual and JC Santos (ABSOLUTELY ATE) and solid world building but it was pretty thematically incoherent
Mallari,3519,2,chuboobster,,80.0,ltbx,Sci fi - occult - horror elements were thrown around without logic
Mallari,3519,3,chuboobster,,80.0,ltbx,"Characters were thinly written – I wasn't sold on why they, especially present-day Piolo, were doing whatever the hell they were doing"
Mallari,3520,1,jimyumang,,160.0,ltbx,slay (literally)enjoyed the movie until the wings came out lolpapa p ure so pogi
Mallari,3521,1,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"oke so, ang daming nangyari eh noh HAHAHA"
Mallari,3521,2,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"spoiler tho, i watched this movie without watching the trailer so si anteh walang clue sa storyline/plot ng movie, ang alam ko lang is kung sino ba talaga si fr"
Mallari,3521,3,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,mallari and pogi si papa p
Mallari,3521,4,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"cinematography wise, it was good naman"
Mallari,3521,5,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,pinatunayan na unti unti na nagpro-progress ang pelikulang pilipino
Mallari,3521,6,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,there are transitions throughout the movie na na amaze ako and may lavarn naman talaga
Mallari,3521,7,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"storyline wise, so ayun na nga medyo na-confuse rin ako slight kasi may fly high manananggal beh"
Mallari,3521,8,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"like, ano na ba ‘toh"
Mallari,3521,10,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"may pass the balut pa beh, so sobrang confusing talaga"
Mallari,3521,11,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"stupid rin kasi ako, i thought real life story ‘toh ni fr"
Mallari,3521,12,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"mallari and shit, u know kinda like a docu-film ba"
Mallari,3521,13,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,so yung subjects such as the manananggal and yung sisiw confuses me a lot
Mallari,3521,14,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"cgi wise, singit ko lang beh"
Mallari,3521,15,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"natawa ako beh  especially yung cgi sa mulha ni gloria diaz, may improvements pa talaga huhu"
Mallari,3521,16,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"but overall tho, i’m officially a johnrey mallari stan"
Mallari,3521,17,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"i bow down to the king jokes aside, there’s a lot that needs improvement but THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE A BOMB"
Mallari,3521,18,junejuly1,,120.0,ltbx,"3/5 stars muna, para paginipan ko rin si johnrey mallari HUOY"
Mallari,3522,1,eliezerpen,,160.0,ltbx,they made piolo wear cassock in a slasher movie and expect me to not like it
Mallari,3523,1,yiacdg,,120.0,ltbx,insidious red door + nocebo + piolo pascual multiverse
Mallari,3524,1,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,im so sorry u can sell to me anything that is folk horror  i loved many things here
Mallari,3524,2,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,"another ""everything everywhere all at once"" film but idgaf because i enjoy horror, thriller, crime, folklore, religion, period and family drama"
Mallari,3524,3,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,"i love the many things they tried to do, and i think it worked"
Mallari,3524,4,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,"i just wish it was more of a ""show"" than ""tell"" film"
Mallari,3524,5,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,dialogues also tend to state the already obvious
Mallari,3524,6,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,"example: when john rey found out that he brought back jonathan's towel, he voiced it out as if the audience couldn't see towel in his hand"
Mallari,3524,7,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,characters KEEP speaking out their thought process
Mallari,3524,8,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,"it threw me off because (1) real people don't do that, (2) it takes away the mystery, (3) EVERY actor are talented enough, i am sure they can deliver the thoughts and emotions of their characters through their body language and facial expressions alone"
Mallari,3524,9,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,"mallari is a smart film (at least smarter than many recent filo films), but it sees its audience as stupid or ppl who needs to be spoonfed"
Mallari,3524,10,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,THIS IS A PROOF THAT WE NEED MORE PHILIPPINE FOLK HORROR
Mallari,3524,11,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,"we don't need to borrow from other countries' horror genre, no need for filipino versions of annabelle, saw, and carrie"
Mallari,3524,12,babaylans,,160.0,ltbx,our folklore is vast and more interesting
Mallari,3525,1,trainwrecktim,,80.0,ltbx,Too much going on and too ambitious for its own good
Mallari,3525,2,trainwrecktim,,80.0,ltbx,"Wish it stuck to its best bits, the 1800s, all the way through and really tightened that script"
Mallari,3525,3,trainwrecktim,,80.0,ltbx,But the score was fabulous
Mallari,3526,1,7lioh,,,ltbx,Is it justifiable when a human kills others in the name of justice
Mallari,3526,2,7lioh,,,ltbx,To eliminate the evil in this world
Mallari,3526,3,7lioh,,,ltbx,Does one person that you love most's life matter more than the lives of others
Mallari,3526,4,7lioh,,,ltbx,Are we able to escape the fate that has been sealed long before our parents existence
Mallari,3526,5,7lioh,,,ltbx,Is love really the biggest curse of it all
Mallari,3526,6,7lioh,,,ltbx,These are all the questions that came to mind as I was watching Mallari
Mallari,3526,7,7lioh,,,ltbx,"Before I continue, I just wanted to point out that they executed the connection between the 3 generations of Severinos seamlessly"
Mallari,3526,8,7lioh,,,ltbx,It was really impressive how they wove the stories of the different generations of Mallari into the final fate of the present one
Mallari,3526,9,7lioh,,,ltbx,He who determines whether a person is the sum of all his decisions or his mistakes
Mallari,3526,10,7lioh,,,ltbx,More than anything I adore films that evokes questions out of me
Mallari,3526,11,7lioh,,,ltbx,There's just this juvenile wonder that comes after witnessing a story unfold in front of you
Mallari,3526,12,7lioh,,,ltbx,Something about it makes my morale skyrocket
Mallari,3526,13,7lioh,,,ltbx,"That, for me, is one of the factors I consider when writing about films I watch"
Mallari,3526,14,7lioh,,,ltbx,"In conclusion, I ask of you (to whoever may be reading this, anyone who doesn't have a short attention span like I do), to watch this film"
Mallari,3526,15,7lioh,,,ltbx,"It has a very intriguing plot, features great performances from the leads, tells the story fate or trauma being hereditary, and the gift and curse of love to humans"
Mallari,3526,16,7lioh,,,ltbx,Also what the actual fuck
Mallari,3526,17,7lioh,,,ltbx,Piolo is jaw-droppingly gorgeous AND talented
Mallari,3526,18,7lioh,,,ltbx,"I knew he was all that, but goddamn did this punch me in the face just how he is that"
Mallari,3526,19,7lioh,,,ltbx,bitch 100%
Mallari,3526,20,7lioh,,,ltbx,JC Santos also absolutely devoured that role of being the blind worshipper and he rightfully won Best Supporting Actor ikdr
Mallari,3527,1,jmsawitfirst,,140.0,ltbx,they just missed the opportunity to make it a psychological thriller masterpiece
Mallari,3527,2,jmsawitfirst,,140.0,ltbx,"this movie has the best storytelling of multi-verse/time travelling, i have ever seen in a filipino movie"
Mallari,3527,3,jmsawitfirst,,140.0,ltbx,the biggest downside for me is the forced demonic possession and aswang plot which was very unnecessary to the story
Mallari,3527,4,jmsawitfirst,,140.0,ltbx,this could have been one of the best filipino horror movie
Mallari,3528,1,niquelya,,120.0,ltbx,It’s been a long time since I watched a Filipino horror movie that didn’t make me cringe so much
Mallari,3528,2,niquelya,,120.0,ltbx,"This reminded me of Insidious 1 and 2 and though there were parts I found dragging, it is still enjoyable"
Mallari,3528,3,niquelya,,120.0,ltbx,I wish they gave the priest a major part in the actual storyline
Mallari,3528,4,niquelya,,120.0,ltbx,I also found Janella’s character weak
Mallari,3528,5,niquelya,,120.0,ltbx,They should have just gone with the usual aswang instead of a manananggal with poor cgi
Mallari,3528,6,niquelya,,120.0,ltbx,Overall this wasn’t so bad compared to the recent SR&R
Mallari,3529,1,maxbautista,,,ltbx,araw-araw bang pula buwan sa pampanga
Mallari,3530,1,miku0110,,100.0,ltbx,The storyline is too predictable
Mallari,3530,2,miku0110,,100.0,ltbx,They should have stuck with the suspenseful psycho killer plot and omitted the CGI elements like Manananggal and Werewolf
Mallari,3530,3,miku0110,,100.0,ltbx,The explanations are overly obvious; it would have been better to let the audience creatively piece them together
Mallari,3530,4,miku0110,,100.0,ltbx,"However, there are some genuinely impressive shots"

Mallari,3534,2,metromanella,,120.0,ltbx,I am a horror/thriller sucker so I have really high expectations when it comes to this genre
Mallari,3534,3,metromanella,,120.0,ltbx,"This film is ambitious and derivative to its core, with everything going all at the same time BUT I think it was able to seamlessly tie all timelines together and Piolo Pascual's acting to each persona is just god-tier"
Mallari,3534,4,metromanella,,120.0,ltbx,"With regards to the horror side, the CGI is just so bad, that 1 scene completely threw the audience off"
Mallari,3534,5,metromanella,,120.0,ltbx,"Jumpscares are there but it's a blend of sci-fi, folklore and history, which was a bit convoluted"
Mallari,3534,6,metromanella,,120.0,ltbx,"Now I understand why JC Santos won Best Supporting Actor; he's beyond scary, he was frightening to watch"
Mallari,3534,7,metromanella,,120.0,ltbx,1 question I just had was why Piolo did not win Best Actor with his 3 role portrayals (4 plus the alter-ego)
Mallari,3534,8,metromanella,,120.0,ltbx,This has potential

Mallari,3536,5,laya_kathleen,,120.0,ltbx,It was a good experience

Mallari,3537,1,orangelilies,,140.0,ltbx,would’ve been better if it remained a true crime/mystery/thriller film (or maybe i’m just not a big fan of horror movies)

Mallari,3538,8,malikhain,,80.0,ltbx,"Also, the narrative style of withholding key information, strategically aiming for impactful revelations towards the end, serves as one of its major pitfalls"
Mallari,3538,9,malikhain,,80.0,ltbx,"While effective in building suspense, this approach renders characters—especially Jonathan—somewhat devoid of logical thinking, an odd characteristic given his role as a doctor"
Mallari,3538,10,malikhain,,80.0,ltbx,"Despite these shortcomings, the film remains a worthwhile watch for those seeking a fusion of scares and suspense"

Mallari,3585,1,karlllll2424,,160.0,ltbx,"Wow kaya naman pala natin na mag produce ng gantong horror movie,for me its kinda rare to watch this kind of story in philippine cinema specially in horror genre"
Mallari,3585,2,karlllll2424,,160.0,ltbx,Overall I really enjoyed this movie even though some of the scenes ware kinda off specially the cgi effects of some scenes
Mallari,3585,3,karlllll2424,,160.0,ltbx,"But the acting and story was great,the actors did a great job playing their roles kudos to piolo pascual and jc santos"
Mallari,3586,1,julyyyyyy_,,160.0,ltbx,"minus the horrible manananggal and doña facunda cgi, i liked this a lot"
Mallari,3586,2,julyyyyyy_,,160.0,ltbx,a good filipino horror movie
Mallari,3587,1,asmabdulgafor,,40.0,ltbx,"it's like nagbrainstorm sila ng idea kung pano sasabihin yung story ni Mallari in a creative way: time travel, astral projection, aswang, ghosts, witchcraft, occult, whodunit -- then the director decided to put all of them into the film"
Mallari,3588,1,ezpirited,,140.0,ltbx,dapat firefly papanoorin ko kaso di tumugma yung sched ko so i chose what is aligned with my schedule and at the same time looks great (
Mallari,3588,3,ezpirited,,140.0,ltbx,i was really curious with this one especially after that promising trailer
Mallari,3588,4,ezpirited,,140.0,ltbx,i am really an avid fan of horror entries from mmff cause i'm different ayy charot
Mallari,3588,5,ezpirited,,140.0,ltbx,"on a serious note, it wasn't that bad"
Mallari,3588,6,ezpirited,,140.0,ltbx,i am always fascinated with the intriguing world of church and serial killers and serial killers…
Mallari,3589,1,rafael199,,120.0,ltbx,3 stars for that unnecessary specific scene
Mallari,3590,1,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"Delving into three intertwining timelines and employing a time-traveling twist, ""Mallari"" presents an ambitious scope"
Mallari,3590,2,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"While the writers were able to tame this beast with a narrative that manages to engage and leaving its audiences intrigued, the overreliance on jump scares and the occult fails to tie up effectively with the overall storyline"
Mallari,3590,3,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"This heavy-handed (and unnecessary) approach to horror detracts from what could have been a refined, narrative-driven film instead"
Mallari,3590,5,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"Jonathan Mallari de Dios (Piolo Pascual) embarks on a journey to his ancestral home in Magalang, Pampanga, in search of a hidden chamber from his childhood - a chamber purportedly holding a cure for his fiancée's (Janella Salvador) severe illness"
Mallari,3590,6,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"Upon arrival, we're introduced to his ancestors: Fr"
Mallari,3590,7,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"Juan Severino Mallari (Piolo Pascual), the notorious 19th-century Filipino serial killer, and Johnrey Mallari (Piolo Pascual), a chronicler of World War II in the Philippines for the Americans"
Mallari,3590,8,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"As eerie occurrences unfold within the house, it becomes evident that his quest may bring more harm than good to his loved ones"
Mallari,3590,9,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"In the realm of fantastical and supernatural cinema like ""Mallari,"" stringent logic isn’t always to be expected"
Mallari,3590,10,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,There's always a give and take involved as we're delving into imaginary stuff
Mallari,3590,11,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"Yet, the fundamental plot struggles to find coherence"
Mallari,3590,12,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"Elements often feel forced, serving the narrative agenda without solid grounding"
Mallari,3590,13,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,The biggest question for us is why is there a need to continue the legacy of murders across time
Mallari,3590,14,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,While the rationale is clear in the 1800s in Fr
Mallari,3590,15,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"Mallari's time, subsequent timelines lack this clarity and cohesion"
Mallari,3590,16,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"The handling of time travel also raises eyebrow-raising issues, from small stuff such as our protagonists modern-day attire back in time without issue to seamless communication across eras to bigger issues such as the reasons how the Mallaris are able to go selectively go back in time"
Mallari,3590,17,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"However, the film's glaring misstep lies in its gratuitous use of unnecessary horror and jump scares"
Mallari,3590,18,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"The continuous barrage of ghostly appearances lacks purpose, serving more to frustrate than thrill"
Mallari,3590,19,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"It's apparent why they put this excessive amount in ""Mallari"" and ironically it backfires by producing the opposite effect"
Mallari,3590,20,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"Despite these drawbacks, ""Mallari"" maintains a level of entertainment"
Mallari,3590,21,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"It's fundamentally flawed but manages to strike occasional emotional chords, buoyed by its visually captivating cinematography and commendable performances by Piolo Pascual and JC Santos in particular"
Mallari,3590,22,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"Surprisingly, a degree of attachment develops with the main characters, though the film could have greatly benefited from more refinement and streamlining"
Mallari,3590,23,reeladvicenet,,120.0,ltbx,"""Mallari"" assumes forced scares are necessary for a fulfilling experience, missing the mark on delivering a cleaner and better narrative in the process"

Mallari,3609,15,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,"First, how did i get ""hyped"""
Mallari,3609,17,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,This was produced by Warner Bros
Mallari,3609,18,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,"So obviously, as dumb as i am, i assumed we had done something right cinematically or atleast screenplay-wise"
Mallari,3609,20,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual plays several roles
Mallari,3609,21,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,Piolo's been one of the best at picking which movies to appear in and who's passionate to what they do
Mallari,3609,22,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,"Being present in Lav Diaz's films, being the best actor (imo) in Erik Matti's On The Job 1, he is significant in starring and helping produce the most ambitious flicks out there"

Mallari,3609,32,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,This flick does not move our overall filmography at all even being produced by such prestigious film production
Mallari,3609,33,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,"I expected Warner Bros to teach us how to make a proper film, how to fix the wrongs that we do"
Mallari,3609,34,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,"Nah, they just gave us a big budget of which we wasted to VFX that Filipinos love and never do right, Unneeded plot-twist and the props/design of which is actually one of the few okay things they managed to do"
Mallari,3609,35,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,So the visuals are good
Mallari,3609,36,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,"Nah the cinematography, blocking, coloring and effort in framing overall just didn't help the film at all"
Mallari,3609,37,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,"The directing and editing is so abrupt at times as well, even cutting to improper angles or jump cutting without a hint of pace at all"
Mallari,3609,38,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,The 3rd act felt so rushed yet so dragged by the end
Mallari,3609,39,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,"No sense of pacing, completely ruining their own thrill in the climax by rushing their cuts and scenes just to complete the slow and boring end to the story"
Mallari,3609,40,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,"Just an absurd choice of story, obviously this is from the tales they must've heard from the locals and connected it to what seems to be an engaging flick with its unique premise and even unique portrayal"
Mallari,3609,41,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,"But this just shows that those things are NOTHING without the talent of a director, the invisible string that'll try to make a joke have profound meaning"

Mallari,3609,43,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,What's the profoundness supposed to be
Mallari,3609,44,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,It's a complete waste of a good topic or story to unravel
Mallari,3609,45,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,It's a complete mess in filmmaking and an emotionless try to make something intriguing
Mallari,3609,46,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,I don't recommend watching this (unless you're going to the cinema with the people you're happy with like i did so i left there feeling well nonetheless
Mallari,3609,47,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,How can they dehumanize such inhumane actions to the point that it doesn't seem inhumane anymore
Mallari,3609,48,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,It felt like a joke horror rather than a meaningful or cold story
Mallari,3609,49,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,Korean cinema would EAT this
Mallari,3609,50,melthing,,100.0,ltbx,Hollywood would KILL for this script

Mallari,3631,8,onleefranz,,120.0,ltbx,Scoring was amazing but sometimes the scares were too much carried by the scoring and not by what’s happening within the film

Mallari,3667,10,nothisispatrck,,140.0,ltbx,Some elements hold it back from truly achieving greatness but Mallari is a step up from previous MMFF horror entries not named 'Seklusyon' and pushes the boundaries of how good the technical quality of pinoy films could be

Mallari,3679,1,a_sreview,,160.0,ltbx,I've been hearing a lot of good reviews about Mallari so I decided to give it a shot as well in this year's Metro Manila Film Festival
Mallari,3679,2,a_sreview,,160.0,ltbx,The concept of Mallari is very risky especially in the horror genre but it was offered to the viewers as simply satisfying by focusing solely on the story not the scares
Mallari,3679,3,a_sreview,,160.0,ltbx,"The casts were obviously great, they were able to shine each moment they have within minutes and frames"
Mallari,3679,4,a_sreview,,160.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual had to internalize his characters in a good way since we see different personalities in different people and generations
Mallari,3679,5,a_sreview,,160.0,ltbx,A horror film that is so good to watch in which we should be proud of
Mallari,3679,6,a_sreview,,160.0,ltbx,"Mallari does it the right way with the scares, philippine folklores, and the bits of history"
Mallari,3680,1,chinvincible,,140.0,ltbx,"There are flaws here and there, and questionable scenes that negate or contradict the story, but hell yeah, I don't give a damn"
Mallari,3680,2,chinvincible,,140.0,ltbx,"I like how in the end the main lead's character came to full circle—Mallari is and was, a serial killer, and there is no redemptive way to change history"
Mallari,3680,3,chinvincible,,140.0,ltbx,"I'm sure that most of you don't see that angle but once you realize—as the mc broke the third wall, like what Damien did for The Omen—that he decided to become what he is supposed to be, and he embraced it with his eyes wide open then, you'll probably find some appreciation for how this story was told rather than just do the usual ""historical"" route"
Mallari,3680,4,chinvincible,,140.0,ltbx,"Wasn't super scary, but it's a fun experience"

Mallari,3684,1,cabiria_,,20.0,ltbx,Of course they just had to narrate everything
Mallari,3685,1,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"In this time travelling horror mash up from director Derick Cabrido, Piolo Pascual plays not one, not two, but four different characters from three different timelines"
Mallari,3685,2,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"In the first timeline, we follow the newly assigned parish priest, Fr"
Mallari,3685,3,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"Severino Mallari (Pascual) and his mother, Doña Facunda (Gloria Diaz) as they both settle in the sleepy town of Magalang, Pampanga, circa 1812"
Mallari,3685,4,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"Here, we learn what drove him to become the serial killer that we know today"
Mallari,3685,5,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"In the second one set in 1948, we follow his descendant, filmmaker Johnrey Mallari (played again by Pascual) and his wife, Felicity (Elisse Joson), as he investigates the mysterious case of his ancestor, Severino, who has killed 57 victims"
Mallari,3685,6,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"In the present time, Dr"
Mallari,3685,7,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"Jonathan Mallari De Dios (Pascual) returns to his family's ancestral home in Magalang to search for a way to save his fiancé, Agnes (Janella Salvador) from dying"
Mallari,3685,8,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"He believes that the cure lies at the hands of his ancestors, Doña Facunda and Severino Mallari"
Mallari,3685,9,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"It's admittedly an interesting concept, as the film presents itself as inspired by the true to life crimes of Juan Severino Mallari, Phillippines' first documented serial killer during the 1800s, predating London's Jack The Ripper by more than 60 years"
Mallari,3685,10,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"However, all that potential is sadly wasted in this film"
Mallari,3685,11,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"Penned by Enrico Santos and helmed by Derick Cabrido, this horror film feels like a multitude of films stitched together, thanks to its many story arcs and concepts"
Mallari,3685,12,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"A big chunk of the film plays out like a slasher flick, as we watch Severino Mallari dispatching a couple of victims along the way"
Mallari,3685,13,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,The film also plays around with the idea of time travel and astral projection
Mallari,3685,14,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"A portion of it also feels like a creature feature, while the remaining part is your standard ghost story, as the characters are occasionally terrorized by the souls of Mallari's victims"
Mallari,3685,15,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"The film is enjoyable in some parts, but as a whole, it feels convoluted"
Mallari,3685,16,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"At times, it even feels confusing"
Mallari,3685,17,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"The script tries to make the merging of the overarching story arcs and timelines as smooth as it can, but it can't help but feel overstuffed and too muddled"
Mallari,3685,18,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"Enrico Santos' screenplay also didn't fully utilize the concept, although I appreciate the film's outlandishness"
Mallari,3685,19,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"Imagine, from a serial killer, we eventually get to see ghosts, witches and aswangs in one sitting"
Mallari,3685,20,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,Although I did find the film's blatant transphobia a bit icky as it didn't sit well with me
Mallari,3685,21,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"Despite that, the film is undeniably worth checking for two things: its production value and the cast"
Mallari,3685,22,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"The film looks very impressive, with Pao Orendain's slick camera work brilliantly capturing Marielle Hizon's highly detailed production design"
Mallari,3685,23,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,"You know they really spent time and money just by looking at those highly detailed set pieces and costumes, from that town church made from scratch to the period accurate wardrobe"
Mallari,3685,24,filmcirclerjct,,100.0,ltbx,It's only the CGI effects that looks pretty inconsistent

Mallari,3689,1,roughangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"The film weaves an intricate horror lore out of the flimsiest of historical material, as not much else is really known about the real-life serial killer Juan Severino Mallari"

Mallari,3734,4,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,The transitions between the three eras were smooth that it was a little bit confusing at first glance but I loved how it incorporates the three timelines on a single important event of the whole story and presents you each on how they are intersected at that moment
Mallari,3734,5,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,It was definitely good on how they are able to play around the plot and not spill the whole thing on one go
Mallari,3734,6,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,I loved that portion and Piolo Pascual's acting is the best I've seen and maybe this is his best movie on his entire career
Mallari,3734,7,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,"From the visual, to the acting, to the pronounciations that make the timelines distinct on their own helps very well on distinguishing the three different timelines of Severino, Johnrey and Jonathan"

Mallari,3734,13,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,"Like from JC's character to Janella's ""memory"" of who she is now after what Piolo did)But despite these things, I found Mallari to be a good film and despite not being a fan of horror films, this is one of those horror films at the top my list (as it was a good horro movie and because I can still sleep st night after watching this)"
Mallari,3735,1,godd6mn,,40.0,ltbx,Why was Johnrey giving Javier Peña from Narcos… I thought this was Piolo Pascual not Pedro Pascal wtf

Mallari,3739,2,csndr,,120.0,ltbx,"Ironically, I also stay away from horror, because I just can't with the jumpscares, I prepare myself too much to be scared, but end up underwhelmed"
Mallari,3739,3,csndr,,120.0,ltbx,"Hence, when I found out this had a horror element to it, I was confused"
Mallari,3739,4,csndr,,120.0,ltbx,The story being told in the point of view of 3 Mallaris plus the time traveling angle made this…

Mallari,3741,1,reinenshine,,120.0,ltbx,"I liked the movie, but I was so lost"
Mallari,3741,2,reinenshine,,120.0,ltbx,They should have stuck to the psychological thriller and not gone off the paranormal route
Mallari,3741,3,reinenshine,,120.0,ltbx,"Moreover, although it was supposed to be a horror thriller, I feel like they compensate the horror genre with lots of jumpscare"
Mallari,3741,4,reinenshine,,120.0,ltbx,"I loved the premise, but the execution was very confusing"
Mallari,3741,5,reinenshine,,120.0,ltbx,"Not to mention, the dialogue in the current timeline was very awkward"

Mallari,3742,1,hector_films,,140.0,ltbx,a missed opportunity but piolo did great portraying 3 different characters
Mallari,3743,1,wthruwatchinsam,,60.0,ltbx,"Has a decent story, nice non-linear story telling to provoke our thoughts, remarkable performance from Pascual and Santos, and outstanding visuals and audio design, but suffers miserably in execution"
Mallari,3743,2,wthruwatchinsam,,60.0,ltbx,The first half was boring and the pacing was not good
Mallari,3743,3,wthruwatchinsam,,60.0,ltbx,It was only in the third quarter of the film where it became interesting
Mallari,3743,4,wthruwatchinsam,,60.0,ltbx,The conclusion was also weak
Mallari,3743,5,wthruwatchinsam,,60.0,ltbx,Looking for the three video reels for a couple of days in a small house to solve a mystery was ridiculously stupid
Mallari,3743,6,wthruwatchinsam,,60.0,ltbx,The screenplay was not very good most especially in the wedding proposal scene; and the delivery of lines were bad
Mallari,3743,7,wthruwatchinsam,,60.0,ltbx,There was barely modulation in line delivery
Mallari,3743,8,wthruwatchinsam,,60.0,ltbx,It contains many cheap and ineffective jumpscares although two of them were remarkable (i
Mallari,3743,9,wthruwatchinsam,,60.0,ltbx,"e, hospital scene in the beginning and ghost hunting with the children)"
Mallari,3743,10,wthruwatchinsam,,60.0,ltbx,The horror elements in the film was also full of cliché

Mallari,3746,5,gardpm,,140.0,ltbx,"Definitely a weak point of the film despite the incredible cinematography and camera work, perhaps among the best I’ve seen in the genre locally"

Mallari,3779,5,demi_kid,,160.0,ltbx,"Sa kabila ng ganda ng cinematography at ang kahusayan ng pagganap ni Piolo at ng buong cast, hindi maikakaila na tila iniiwasan ng pelikula ang pangwakas na may saya"

Mallari,3779,7,demi_kid,,160.0,ltbx,"Ang mga eksena ay nadama ko sa bawat angulo, at ang husay ng mga aktor, lalo na si Piolo at ang buong cast, ay nagbibigay-buhay sa karakter"

Mallari,3796,2,ellaletter_,,60.0,ltbx,"However, throughout the movie, I noticed that it relied heavily on jump scares, making it seem frightening due to the surprising elements"
Mallari,3796,3,ellaletter_,,60.0,ltbx,"Secondly, the story isn't overly confusing; it's just a bit lacking in depth"
Mallari,3796,4,ellaletter_,,60.0,ltbx,"Yes, it connects various elements and effectively showcases Filipino traditions, but the plot feels incomplete, and the concept of love is somewhat overshadowed by Piolo's character"

Mallari,3803,2,illlegitimaine,,180.0,ltbx,"on one hand, I'd argue that Cedrick Juan can play Mallari because his malalamin na mata will be an asset"
Mallari,3803,5,illlegitimaine,,180.0,ltbx,please watch Nocebo before or after this hehehe
Mallari,3804,1,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,I didn't expect much from this movie as I'd been hearing a LOT of negative reviews
Mallari,3804,2,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,"I went in blind, and I happened to enjoy it"
Mallari,3804,3,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,"It was a horror movie that made sense (if you're open to peculiar storylines, of course)"
Mallari,3804,4,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,"The first half was confusing and wonky, but the latter half at least made up for it by tying up the initially disconnected events together in a way that stimulated the audience's minds"
Mallari,3804,5,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,Plot twists were revealed in this way when I didn't think there was anything more to expect
Mallari,3804,6,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,The movie was intentionally NOT subtle about the true culprit's identity because there were MORE IMPORTANT twists
Mallari,3804,7,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,"Some bits of dialogue, especially in the romantic scenes, were cringe-inducing and unnatural"
Mallari,3804,8,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,Even Janella's and Piolo's decent acting couldn't make it bearable
Mallari,3804,9,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,The insertion of key story elements (e
Mallari,3804,11,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,", time traveling) could have been better with a less cheesy dialogue"
Mallari,3804,12,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,"Speaking of acting, JC Santos DESERVES the Best Supporting Actor Award"
Mallari,3804,13,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,Piolo's acting was the weakest despite portraying the MAIN character; he was outshined by the supporting actors
Mallari,3804,14,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,There were multiple layers to the story that influenced the characters' complexity
Mallari,3804,15,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,Wikipedia would tell us that Fr
Mallari,3804,16,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,"Juan Severino Mallari killed 57 people as a ""cure"" for his mother's sickness, which he deemed cursed"
Mallari,3804,17,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,But the movie went all out: There was MORE to show within 2 hours
Mallari,3804,18,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,I loved the ending
Mallari,3804,19,terriblejasf,,140.0,ltbx,Life's true horror did not come from stories about ghosts but from a person's adamance in committing mistakes that would negatively impact the people around them

Mallari,3810,1,migocean_,,140.0,ltbx,BECAUSE OF THAT ONE F SCENE
Mallari,3811,1,delleesther,,120.0,ltbx,3 different Piolos differentiated by hair
Mallari,3812,1,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,"+:- plot-wise, it's def a richer, more nuanced, and more thought-out narrative compared to most PH horror na super predictable na ng plot twists + generic elements"
Mallari,3812,2,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,i like what it tried to do with 3 diff time periods though ofc the time traveling/astral projecting was a stretch and maybe a tad too ambitious writing-wise
Mallari,3812,3,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,still a good effort tho- characters: all played well
Mallari,3812,4,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,i liked the juxtaposition between severino - a serial killer who didn't enjoy it and didn't actually WANT to be it - and lucas who DID enjoy being a copycat killer and WANTED to do it
Mallari,3812,5,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,jc santos deserved his best supporting actor award
Mallari,3812,6,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,- technical elements: production design goes so hard esp knowing they built some of the key parts of the setting
Mallari,3812,7,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,"the score was also particularly good tho maybe im just biased for church/choral elements-:- im not a big fan of origin stories of ""female monsters"" when the presented origin is so male-centric"
Mallari,3812,8,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,"sure, in this case it was women who set upon the curse that started the monster - but why"
Mallari,3812,9,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,just for someone else to do their bidding
Mallari,3812,10,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,i wish they showed more of the alarcons and why they did what they did
Mallari,3812,11,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,"if the motivation is supposed to be wrath at the injustice done against ppl like them, then i wish they leaned into that more, kulang lang ng detail pa for that- mallari stopped being scary the moment it was revealed that his mom saw smth nieves led her to watch"
Mallari,3812,12,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,"dun palang i already knew severino would only be forced to kill, not that he wanted to himself"
Mallari,3812,13,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,im not a fan of this either lol he'd be a much more sinister character if HE was the fanatic and saw himself as san bartolome on his own accord BUT i know that's not the point of the story so sige na nga- why naman di na lang niya niligtas si agnes eh doktor din naman si jonathan
Mallari,3812,14,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,"tapos pampanga yan in present time beh dami dami nang ospital tas may kotse rin naman si agnes mabilis kayo makakarating dun medyo nkklk- AND SPEAKING OF THE HOSPITAL: in the first scene na pinakitang nasa hospital bed si agnes, ang sabi ng nurse ""end stage na po siya"" so akala ko naman cancer or some life-threatening disease"
Mallari,3812,15,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,ngayon pala stab wound amp pano yon end stage nakapagsalita pa nga and all ewan ko ba- and the ending
Mallari,3812,16,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,"i get it they needed a shot of jonathan like that, but i wish it was even more tragic"
Mallari,3812,17,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,filipino writing is sometimes so hooked on expositional writing but sometimes that gets too annoying to listen to and to act out
Mallari,3812,18,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,i wish they didn't show agnes eating the chick
Mallari,3812,19,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,"ok na sana that they showed jonathan smiling while holding up johnrey's head and the chick is coming out of its mouth - and then cut na agad to the mallari house and the secret room, where agnes is chained and jonathan is ""lovingly"" feeding her entrails while she looks like she'd rather be dead after killing him IDK"
Mallari,3812,20,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,"personally didnt feel like all that dialogue was necessary in the end but ok gets pa rin namanoverall tho, i hope this film encourages more horror filmmakers to take on compelling stories"
Mallari,3812,21,anaiela,,140.0,ltbx,our culture is SOOO rich for this literally andaming pwedeng material for horror and im so glad to see i can look forward to more daring horror films like this now in the PH
Mallari,3813,1,chzsaucefries,,140.0,ltbx,tumatanda na ata ako kaya mas nagiging pogi si papa p T_T

Mallari,3815,2,anito,,160.0,ltbx,Piolo was great the only thing I wasn't convinced by is his demon character in the church scene
Mallari,3815,3,anito,,160.0,ltbx,But all other 3 Mallari was great
Mallari,3815,4,anito,,160.0,ltbx,Maybe even his Fr
Mallari,3815,5,anito,,160.0,ltbx,Severino was the best
Mallari,3815,6,anito,,160.0,ltbx,I don't think the jumpscares were unnecessary
Mallari,3815,7,anito,,160.0,ltbx,Us pinoys would eat the up anyway
Mallari,3815,8,anito,,160.0,ltbx,"But its use of time travel or astral projection as the film says is kinda weak I think, I wished it was more utilized to move the narrative better but a 2 hr cut wouldn't really suffice so I guess it's good as it is"
Mallari,3815,9,anito,,160.0,ltbx,+ it really tries to fit in a lot of genres so I think that's a plus for me on that part
Mallari,3816,1,catsheepgarden,,180.0,ltbx,ang gandaaaa

Mallari,3818,3,jaredkcl,,120.0,ltbx,Love the concept and source material
Mallari,3818,4,jaredkcl,,120.0,ltbx,"Issues: (1) Jump scares felt unnecessary and did not really lead up to anything, (2) film kinda lost me when Doña Facunda spread her wings and flew to the ceiling Technically great but plot could have been better"
Mallari,3818,5,jaredkcl,,120.0,ltbx,Still good for a Filipino horror film

Mallari,3820,1,tobreakfree,,140.0,ltbx,this did not need that many OA sound effects for the jumpscares to be good piolo's acting ate DOWNNNN srsly
Mallari,3820,2,tobreakfree,,140.0,ltbx,"enjoyed a lot of things about this, but some scenes did make the movie feel a bit shallow"
Mallari,3820,3,tobreakfree,,140.0,ltbx,"one thing i did want to point out was how construed the idea of a ""bad"" person was (who was, therefore, justified to die) in the movie"
Mallari,3820,4,tobreakfree,,140.0,ltbx,didi and aunt mes's sins were repentable
Mallari,3820,5,tobreakfree,,140.0,ltbx,"nevertheless, i enjoyed the movie's premise as someone who watched it blind"

Mallari,3832,4,theultmtfangirl,,140.0,ltbx,But overall the movie married the time travel aspect with the pagan and religious themes
Mallari,3832,5,theultmtfangirl,,140.0,ltbx,Wish they believed more in their audience's brain capacity tho
Mallari,3832,6,theultmtfangirl,,140.0,ltbx,Need not to share it and show it all the time

Mallari,3838,3,vielovescats,,160.0,ltbx,"interesting naman yung plot, the cinematography is superb, and the musical score is just ughhh chef's kiss"
Mallari,3838,4,vielovescats,,160.0,ltbx,"corny lang ng slight yung jumpscares huhuhu to be fair, may times naman na mej nagulat ako but still asdfghjk"
Mallari,3838,5,vielovescats,,160.0,ltbx,"but the plot's quite thrilling, especially sa dulo, i'll give them that"
Mallari,3838,6,vielovescats,,160.0,ltbx,"dito mo makikita na minsan, may mga tao talagang selfish enough para hindi makita ang tunay na mahalaga"
Mallari,3838,7,vielovescats,,160.0,ltbx,and it also saddens me na may mga sakripisyong ginawa ang mga ninuno natin na nauwi lang sa wala dahil sa refusal natin to learn from our own history

Mallari,3839,5,itchoboideo,,120.0,ltbx,Ang daming jump scares
Mallari,3840,1,_ajsison,,80.0,ltbx,It had a promising concept and a fantastic cast but fragmented execution
Mallari,3840,2,_ajsison,,80.0,ltbx,"The eerie scoring primarily led to the horror factor, and jump scares were cheesy at some bits, like putting a jump scare just for the sake of it"
Mallari,3840,3,_ajsison,,80.0,ltbx,"The story could have been more concise, and the revelation of events was overly explained, as if the film treated the audience as stupid enough not to state the obvious"
Mallari,3840,4,_ajsison,,80.0,ltbx,It’s still a fantastic attempt and a thrilling movie overall
Mallari,3840,5,_ajsison,,80.0,ltbx,JC Santos truly deserved that Best Supporting Actor award

Mallari,3846,1,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,Mallari is a horror-thriller film based on the Philippines' first recorded serial killer hailing from Pampanga
Mallari,3846,2,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,"With this in mind, the film attempts to take us on a wild ride of discovery, boldly mixing genres that, while commendable, more often than not gets derailed into different directions"
Mallari,3846,3,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,"MAZES AND DAZESFirstly, it's admirable how the story attempts to give Filipino audiences something different"
Mallari,3846,4,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,"It marries the familiar Philippine folklore horror elements with sci-fi and mystery thriller with dashes of history, comedy, and even family drama"
Mallari,3846,5,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,"The story unfolds with a non-linear structure, too, which makes it interesting"
Mallari,3846,6,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,The issues lay with this very idea that it wanted to do so much with so little time
Mallari,3846,7,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,"The first half of the film lays all of the mystery, while the second half picks up the pace and fully turns into a horror story"
Mallari,3846,8,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,Jamming too many elements somehow took away from what could have been great points in the story if only they leaned more into them and chose: did it want to be more of a historical horror or a mystery thriller slasher cult modern classic
Mallari,3846,9,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,BRIGHT AND DULL SPOTSPiolo Pascual playing multiple roles across generations would've been a great feat for an actor of his caliber
Mallari,3846,10,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,"But somehow, something was missing in his portrayal that left me wanting more"
Mallari,3846,11,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,"His characters felt like they were the same people, save for two distinct moments in the chapel and in the hospital towards the end"
Mallari,3846,12,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,Undeniable standouts were JC Santos and Gloria Diaz
Mallari,3846,13,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,They were spectacular and generous in their supporting roles and stole scenes whenever they came up beside Pascual
Mallari,3846,14,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,They were delightful to watch
Mallari,3846,15,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,"OVERALLDespite its major flaws, I like how everything was wrapped up"
Mallari,3846,16,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,"All of the mysteries and questions set up were resolved and given their end, no loose ends (which could've easily been the case given its ambition and scope)"
Mallari,3846,17,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,Mallari is an example of what happens when you allow filmmakers to be adventurous and bold in their ideas
Mallari,3846,18,atablefortwo,,140.0,ltbx,"It can lead to a bumpy and crazy, yet fun and adventurous ride"
Mallari,3847,1,henlobea,,140.0,ltbx,a pretty solid movie
Mallari,3847,2,henlobea,,140.0,ltbx,definitely not perfect but has the potential to kickstart a new age for filipino horror movies
Mallari,3848,1,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,watching this in the cinemas was definitely a fun experience especially when the audience (mostly strangers) also insert funny commentaries here and there that you can’t help but laugh at
Mallari,3848,2,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,the people behind our backs were especially funny i couldn’t help but to acknowledge how that elevated my experience
Mallari,3848,3,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,as for the movie itself…
Mallari,3848,4,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,"first, i would like to point out how much i loooooove the musical scoring"
Mallari,3848,5,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,i have no complaints about that
Mallari,3848,6,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,i also liked the acting especially jc santos like woah okay best supporting actor indeed
Mallari,3848,7,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,and also liked the fact that janella salvador is here like woah everyone’s eye candy is piolo pascual but mine is janella so there’s room for everybody
Mallari,3848,8,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,"that said, what i didn’t like about the movie is how they didn’t explore much about the first filipino serial killer aspect more"
Mallari,3848,9,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,"i went in expecting that they would explore the story of the murders itself, the aftermath, the consequences, and how the priest was discovered as the murderer but i guess that’s on me for expecting something like that, something nbc hannibal-like"
Mallari,3848,10,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,"honestly, i just really wished they focused more on the murders since it is a mystery/thriller aspect in itself but i guess mallari wasn’t going for that"
Mallari,3848,11,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,"like hello, the first documented serial killer of the philippines was a catholic priest and that in itself is intriguing as a predominantly catholic country"
Mallari,3848,12,freshlinen,,120.0,ltbx,"anyway, i did like the time traveling aspect to explore the narrative but at the same time i feel like it wasn’t utilized well enough to really wrap up the story… but props to piolo pascual for pulling off the roles well"
Mallari,3849,1,ohohleoph,,200.0,ltbx,Grabe yung Mallari

Mallari,3850,3,remremiah,,120.0,ltbx,"Though a handful of ridiculous jumpscares, and horrible cgi was painful enough to watch"
Mallari,3850,4,remremiah,,120.0,ltbx,"The cringe, dramatic lines, and the predictable plot twists was forgivable"
Mallari,3850,5,remremiah,,120.0,ltbx,And the ending was a piece of cake

Mallari,3862,4,californiamacky,,200.0,ltbx,Piolo serving us an acting masterclass
Mallari,3862,5,californiamacky,,200.0,ltbx,"Much of the criticism about MALLARI is the abundance of jump scares, and I agree that they are quite tiring after a certain time"
Mallari,3862,6,californiamacky,,200.0,ltbx,MALLARI works best during its moments of quiet dread: two scenes in particular (without giving much away) are my favorite
Mallari,3862,7,californiamacky,,200.0,ltbx,"ONE, the film showing featuring some unwelcome guests"
Mallari,3862,8,californiamacky,,200.0,ltbx,"TWO, that Baile scene"
Mallari,3862,9,californiamacky,,200.0,ltbx,"Pao Orendain's camerawork is dizzying, maddening, which like the storytelling, is taking all of us for a spin"

Mallari,3863,2,shoggre,,140.0,ltbx,"first half felt quite cheesy with its jumpscares accompanied with screaming sfx which made it impossible for me to take the movie seriously but the second half was surprising, still quite a few jumpscares yet the twists and acting made it worth sticking around 'til the end"
Mallari,3863,3,shoggre,,140.0,ltbx,i do love the overall concept
Mallari,3863,4,shoggre,,140.0,ltbx,its very unique and i do appreciate the storytelling although i wish it wasnt reliant on jumpscares for the fear factor
Mallari,3863,5,shoggre,,140.0,ltbx,it's worth a watch imo if you're interested
Mallari,3864,1,losanhel,,180.0,ltbx,"I'm in love with this film's plot and timeline, like wow— they really managed to pull a concept like this"

Mallari,3864,3,losanhel,,180.0,ltbx,"The casts in this is PERFECT, Piolo Pascual you're fucking eternal of an actor"
Mallari,3864,4,losanhel,,180.0,ltbx,"And ngl, I'd do the same for Janella Salvador"
Mallari,3864,5,losanhel,,180.0,ltbx,"Not a fan of horror films with lots of jumpscares tho, hence why I didn't give this 5 stars— and because of some cgi effects that are just off putting"

Mallari,3867,1,rynethewatcher,,140.0,ltbx,"The very interesting plot sprinkled with a lot of nuanced elements (time jumps, time travel, astral projection, witchcraft, murder, different eras, etc"
Mallari,3867,2,rynethewatcher,,140.0,ltbx,) combined with great acting made me hopeful that this would turn into an actual top tier Filipino movie
Mallari,3867,3,rynethewatcher,,140.0,ltbx,"But the ineffective jumpscares, bad CGI at times, and the questionable ending (which demanded more scenes between Piolo and Janella to solidly establish their relationship) prevented what I hoped for from happening"

Mallari,3877,3,paulofabregas,,40.0,ltbx,relies on jump scares as crutch instead of setting the tone/mood with other elements

Mallari,3901,1,francecruz024,,100.0,ltbx,"Not even Piolo Pascual and JC Santos can carry this convoluted ass plotThe movie was marketer as a slasher horror but became a hodge podge of horror subgenres that the film didn't seem to know what it wanted itself to beThe movie could have been better if it had less jump scares, more consistency, focused more on building tension, and kept itself more grounded or making it more suspense thriller with slasher elements"

Mallari,3901,3,francecruz024,,100.0,ltbx,"The manananggal was unnecessary and was just too sillyAlthough i was surprised to enjoy the time travel subplot, the movie throws away 2 hours of character development and exposition for an ending that repeats itself from the beginning"

Mallari,3910,2,ally_alano,,80.0,ltbx,the jumpscares were unnecessary and did nothing for the plot but to scare the audiencethe movie also felt too long
Mallari,3910,3,ally_alano,,80.0,ltbx,"they could have cut down a lot scenes, the pacing could have been better, and they could have revised the script more"
Mallari,3910,4,ally_alano,,80.0,ltbx,it also thinks that that the viewers are dumb by over explaining some of the key plot points and reiterating information that was already shown beforehand
Mallari,3910,5,ally_alano,,80.0,ltbx,"(more show, less talk guys)however, I do want to note the best thing about this movie is its scoring, its really no wonder why it won best musical score because the music just gets you and pulls you into the creepy supernatural atmosphere that they wouldn’t have fully accomplished without its great scoringoverall, it had potential and I thought this had a different approach to the material, but ultimately left disappointed"

Mallari,3936,3,reyes4204,,120.0,ltbx,Although a lot of elements leaves so much to be desired
Mallari,3936,4,reyes4204,,120.0,ltbx,I really liked how they combined time travel and horror elements in this film
Mallari,3936,5,reyes4204,,120.0,ltbx,"I just wished effort was put into the story-telling, because there are a lot of parts in this movie where the story…"
Mallari,3937,1,ekolsnfilms,,160.0,ltbx,a beautiful take on a serial killer case
Mallari,3937,2,ekolsnfilms,,160.0,ltbx,except when the characters had to talk
Mallari,3937,3,ekolsnfilms,,160.0,ltbx,the aswangs were more realistic than the things that come out of their mouths
Mallari,3937,4,ekolsnfilms,,160.0,ltbx,what kind of script was that
Mallari,3938,1,holmesyyawle,,120.0,ltbx,"san o pa ayhan ma achieve sang pinoy ang indi oa nga multo sa mga horror movie, the story is unique tho tapos na explain mayo okay lang sya"
Mallari,3939,1,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"Horror, I guess, is truly the most challenging film genre, and you feel it in the struggles of PH cinema"
Mallari,3939,2,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"Often, in our horror films, the story is either unclear or unintentionally turns into comedy due to poor visual effects"
Mallari,3939,3,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"In this film, I don't quite get why the fear factor feels forced"
Mallari,3939,4,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,There are numerous jumpscares that seem repetitive and not very surprising
Mallari,3939,5,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"Perhaps the film could still deliver (or even be better) if the horror vibes weren't forced (especially the manananggal scene, it might have been better off excluded)"
Mallari,3939,6,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,But it's still a 4-star rating from me because I did enjoy watching it
Mallari,3939,7,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"It gives off similar vibes to Seklusyon since both are horror and revolve around religion, making it inevitable to compare the two"
Mallari,3939,8,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"There are few local horror films with a good screenplay, and this is one of those succeeding in that aspect"
Mallari,3939,9,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,The disturbing ending was exactly what I wanted to spark discussions and curiosity about the life of Father Severino Mallari
Mallari,3939,10,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"Kudos to the filmmakers for the smooth transitions between scenes, and you genuinely feel the thrill"
Mallari,3939,11,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"The score was superb (the bayle scene was chef's kiss), but there were times when the sound effects are annoying because it's too loud and hurts the ears"
Mallari,3939,12,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,The editing still needs more improvement
Mallari,3939,13,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"The visual effects are far from perfect, but they're already good and a significant improvement compared to other local films, especially in the horror genre"
Mallari,3939,14,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"What truly stood out here is the phenomenal acting of Piolo Pascual, with three characters portrayed, and JC Santos, who is truly deserving of his Best Supporting Actor award (they nailed it in their last scene together)"
Mallari,3939,15,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,I believe Piolo Pascual is the Brad Pitt of the Philippines because he never seems to age
Mallari,3939,16,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"There are many loopholes and points for improvement, but the film's concept is indeed impressive, and in some ways, it probably delivered the intended message to viewers"
Mallari,3939,17,aarondavem,,140.0,ltbx,"I'm happy because I see this as a launching pad for the progress of local horror films, and the trajectory is only heading upwards"

Mallari,3947,3,radviews,,140.0,ltbx,"However, there were lots of unnecessary jumpscares and it leaned little too much on being a typical horror which was a distraction from its good narrative and pacing"
Mallari,3947,4,radviews,,140.0,ltbx,"I think this would actually be better if it focused on being a crime thriller rather than a jumpscare horror but keeping the nice blend of crime, horror, historical, time-travel, fantasy and filipino folklore themes that made this gripping and worth the while"

Mallari,3963,3,rodmagaru,,160.0,ltbx,"Its story, its riddles, its terror, and all of its aesthetically pleasing eras are cohesive"
Mallari,3963,4,rodmagaru,,160.0,ltbx,I appreciate how they told the plot without losing sight of the fact that you are still seeing a masterful horror movie
Mallari,3963,5,rodmagaru,,160.0,ltbx,"I was a little lost in the present day, but the plot's shifting texture gave the stories, folklore, and social constructs more substance"
Mallari,3963,6,rodmagaru,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s easy to follow despite moving around inti three periods because its visuals made sure they compliment, and at the same time contradict each other"

Mallari,3965,17,xpert_ninja,,120.0,ltbx,"Suspenseful equences that paralyze you for a minute, instead of five seconds of jumpscare"

Mallari,4001,1,scade510,,180.0,ltbx,"Mallari Some thoughts:- the 3 eras of Mallari was easy to distinguish, transitions were smooth"
Mallari,4001,2,scade510,,180.0,ltbx,"- the twists were surprising, you'll have to be focused sa movie to really get the scenes (esp sa end)- cinematography was superb, the sound effects/music made the scenes creepier- in awe with how they mixed historical horror with the concept of fictional time travelingOverall, the plot, cinematography, visuals, sound effects, characters, concept created one impressive film"

Mallari,4020,2,mingmieyo,,140.0,ltbx,"but this movie would've been more ecstatic if it was just focused on the psychological thriller aspect of the main character, the serial killer priest"
Mallari,4020,3,mingmieyo,,140.0,ltbx,there were too much going on really (especially jump scares out of nowhere)
Mallari,4020,4,mingmieyo,,140.0,ltbx,one thing also that would make it better (sana) is to delve deeper on the political situation of filipinos back then which drives their concept of justice ba
Mallari,4020,6,mingmieyo,,140.0,ltbx,it would've been more powerful

Mallari,4028,3,saisronan,,120.0,ltbx,I feel like it started strong and then it was just jump scares and confusion from then on
Mallari,4028,4,saisronan,,120.0,ltbx,"anyway here are things it could have delved deep on rather than making it about love: - ph catholic church then & now- ph witchcraft- the ability of chismis- johnrey or papa p in that sando nevertheless, papa p you will always be famous"

Mallari,4035,3,river_kio,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite having three different timelines, it did not lead to confusion or a ""wtf is happening"" moment"
Mallari,4035,4,river_kio,,160.0,ltbx,The timelines were executed really well
Mallari,4035,5,river_kio,,160.0,ltbx,"2) The amount of jumpscares, or even just the scary parts, is commendable"

Mallari,4035,10,river_kio,,160.0,ltbx,Timelines were differentiated and can be easily identified
Mallari,4035,11,river_kio,,160.0,ltbx,"Areas to Improve:- Played too safe with the gore, hence it was something we don't really mind"
Mallari,4035,12,river_kio,,160.0,ltbx,The horror elements are enough
Mallari,4035,13,river_kio,,160.0,ltbx,"- 2 murders in the modern day could not justify the ""serial killings"", would be great if there were at least one or two more"
Mallari,4035,14,river_kio,,160.0,ltbx,"- I, personally, did not like Janella's fate"

Mallari,4042,3,franceschyla,,140.0,ltbx,The only thing I didn't like was1
Mallari,4042,4,franceschyla,,140.0,ltbx,I didn't think some of the language used in some parts of the movie were appropriate for the time/era they were portraying
Mallari,4042,5,franceschyla,,140.0,ltbx,Modern Tagalog during the 1800s2
Mallari,4042,6,franceschyla,,140.0,ltbx,"Would've been better if they sticked to demon/cult beliefs without any transformation of Facunda into aswang, esp the use of CGI Kinda ruined the movie for me"
Mallari,4042,7,franceschyla,,140.0,ltbx,But good film nonetheless
Mallari,4042,8,franceschyla,,140.0,ltbx,I think Piolo as a villain for next movie would be great

Mallari,4052,3,cjshua,,100.0,ltbx,I didn't like how it relied on useless jump scares in the first half as it really goes to unsettling territories in its second half
Mallari,4052,4,cjshua,,100.0,ltbx,The pacing overall feels very clunky and the characters are stiff and almost dumb at some parts

Mallari,4067,2,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,(editing aspect) i cant believe the bad gma-inspired cgi still passes on even on the big screen
Mallari,4067,3,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,imposible talaga na kulang o limited ang mga mahuhusay na cgi artists sa ph
Mallari,4067,4,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,i read that most local tv shows scrimp on their sfx editors to allocate their funds to other needs or are generally on a tight budget but seriously hanggang dito ba naman
Mallari,4067,5,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,huhu sayang kasi its these little repetitive things that hinder the quality
Mallari,4067,6,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,"in some scenes, imo mas maganda kung dinaan nlang nila sa sfx na makeup hindi cgi"
Mallari,4067,7,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,"to add sa editing nito, the transitions please yes to experimenting & gaining inspiration from creative transitions but please not in your entries for an anticipated film festival, and im not just talking about this movie but in the other entries as well"
Mallari,4067,8,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,i really would have settled with a simple cut transition or a basic fade in/out huhu(plot aspect + cinematog + misc) idk i liked their twist to the og story of ph's first serial killer
Mallari,4067,9,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,"it strayed from ur normal historical piece such as gomburza, heneral luna, etc"
Mallari,4067,10,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,"i really liked how there were scenes u would dismiss at the start and by the end, its so satisfying to revisit those scenes but with all the pieces finally falling into place"
Mallari,4067,11,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,also hindi sila bobo
Mallari,4067,12,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,except sa dulo cguro pero di tanga tanga mga desisyon nila like the typical horror movie
Mallari,4067,13,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,just a bit weird with the out of place comedy (still enjoyable tho) tsaka ewan may moments na mapapa tanong ka lang kung controversial ba toh o oa lang ba ako
Mallari,4067,14,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,anw my last criticism would be on the jumpscares
Mallari,4067,15,idkaboutfilms,,100.0,ltbx,again please we can do better than this

Mallari,4082,4,domiditz,,120.0,ltbx,"I hate the sound design, so many scenes could be so scary but because of the choices made theyre almost laughable - the jumpscares are not jumpscaring - overusing scream effects (wala nang impact)I thought id get icked by the time travel aspect but its actually ""executed"" really well heheMAKEUP AND FX IS REALLY GOOD BELIEVABLE AND SCARY ENOUGHit WAS good until that fucking manananggal cgi THIS MOVIE WOULDVE BEEN GOOD HAD IT NOT BEEN GRRRR IT LOOKS SUPER DATED ALREADY LIKE THAT WAS NIT NECESSARY AT ALLANG GANDA NA SANA MAY PINAGGAGAWA PA SILANG GANUN OKAY LANG NMN KUNG WALA ,honestly liked watching this pero i feel like the plot is very predictable from the beginning palang i dont get why they were so obvious with the clueskeep forgetting to make a review so enjoy my late in-theatre notes"

Mallari,4085,1,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,A decent one with intriguing concepts and elements that aren't prevalent in other horror-thriller movies
Mallari,4085,2,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,"Some jump scares shouldn't be included, imo"
Mallari,4085,3,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,"The creepy scoring is more than enough to fit the screenplay; the pacing is a bit messy and could be improved, but the last stretch swiftly sums up how good the plot line is"
Mallari,4085,4,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,Piolo's portrayal definitely showed the differences between the three generations; I have to commend how it was depicted
Mallari,4085,5,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,JC Santos' performance was top-notch; no wonder he won as the best supporting actor for this filmfest
Mallari,4085,6,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,"I'm also impressed by how it includes Filipino folklore and mythology, how Christianity has severely influenced us all up until now, and the way they show how religion affects one's overall character"
Mallari,4086,1,aliahssi,,140.0,ltbx,My first film for 2024 and I would say I fairly had fun
Mallari,4086,2,aliahssi,,140.0,ltbx,I think the deciding factor whether one will like this film is the astral projection/time travel direction on the screenplay based on actual history
Mallari,4086,3,aliahssi,,140.0,ltbx,"I definitely did not expect that going into this film, although eventually I enjoyed the plot as it went on"
Mallari,4086,4,aliahssi,,140.0,ltbx,"Corny scenes at times, but overpowered by the cinematography and haunting score"

Mallari,4099,2,mrdj1721,,100.0,ltbx,Both in terms of production design and cinematography
Mallari,4099,3,mrdj1721,,100.0,ltbx,"The film sounds good, both in terms of sound design and scoring"
Mallari,4099,4,mrdj1721,,100.0,ltbx,The film also manages to weave together the three narratives of three generations of the Mallari clan very well
Mallari,4099,5,mrdj1721,,100.0,ltbx,I just wish that the narrative themselves were fleshed out and developed well
Mallari,4099,6,mrdj1721,,100.0,ltbx,It felt like the film is trying to say too much that it ended up not saying anything at all
Mallari,4099,7,mrdj1721,,100.0,ltbx,"However, I do think that the film's epilogue is easily its greatest strength"
Mallari,4099,8,mrdj1721,,100.0,ltbx,"Particularly, the hospital scene"
Mallari,4099,9,mrdj1721,,100.0,ltbx,"The way it was shot, the way it was scored, the performances truly hooked me in that moment"
Mallari,4099,10,mrdj1721,,100.0,ltbx,"I wish there were more moments like that in the film, but what we got were CGI-elongated faces of dead people followed by sudden hitting of notes in an attempt to produce scares out of the audience"

Mallari,4102,2,jimxon,,140.0,ltbx,"bravo to the actors, the production team, and the director of this film"
Mallari,4102,3,jimxon,,140.0,ltbx,"the story makes sense as well, since the movie's plot thickens considerably when the characters and dialogue are introduced"
Mallari,4103,1,kxairo,,120.0,ltbx,Definitely one of the more ambitious Filipino horror films I've seen in a while
Mallari,4103,2,kxairo,,120.0,ltbx,"A bunch of cool concepts and I like all the cultural tie ins and nods to Filipino folklore, and history"
Mallari,4103,3,kxairo,,120.0,ltbx,Good acting and cinematography but the horror element definitely could've done some work especially with the cheap jump scares
Mallari,4103,4,kxairo,,120.0,ltbx,Some vfx shots were a bit ehh but passable
Mallari,4103,5,kxairo,,120.0,ltbx,A lot of gen z lingo and humor felt forced throughout as well and the whole deal with the non binary person in the beginning felt unnecessary and the stereotypes used felt mean spirited and out of taste
Mallari,4104,1,letterswithfilm,,140.0,ltbx,jonathan mallari de dios when i catch you…
Mallari,4105,1,laurami,,40.0,ltbx,"I just know for sure that the director was a man by watching this, I thought I was going to watch a film about the priest itself, but it was more of an apology or excuse video of why a priest can't be evil, that he must be forced by evil witchcraft of some filipino women in order to have done those kind of thing, had the potential but was done poorly"
Mallari,4106,1,colxxn,,40.0,ltbx,"promising start, disappointing end"

Mallari,4108,2,donskie,,160.0,ltbx,"For me, it was Piolo and Elise's acting that carried the whole film"
Mallari,4108,3,donskie,,160.0,ltbx,I like how the director thinks by connecting different generations of Mallari to one another
Mallari,4108,4,donskie,,160.0,ltbx,The CGI could have been improved and I was literally annoyed with the ending but it later sank in that the ending of the film should not be changed at all
Mallari,4108,5,donskie,,160.0,ltbx,That it was the perfect ending
Mallari,4109,1,henjunle,,120.0,ltbx,genuinely good plot with a few misses on the unnecessary cgi effects that sprung out of nowhere so saks langggg
Mallari,4110,1,jom_reviews,,120.0,ltbx,82/100 - Satisfactory (83-82)Negatives:-The dialogues were too sloppy
Mallari,4110,2,jom_reviews,,120.0,ltbx,The film has three time frames and it didn't manage to be consistent throughout
Mallari,4110,3,jom_reviews,,120.0,ltbx,The plot was oversaturated with great ideas with no sufficient developments
Mallari,4110,4,jom_reviews,,120.0,ltbx,"-With a lot of characters and plotlines to chew under a 2hr runtime, I find the some sequences abnormally fast-paced"
Mallari,4110,5,jom_reviews,,120.0,ltbx,"-I just don't buy the time travel thing, it's nonsense"
Mallari,4110,6,jom_reviews,,120.0,ltbx,Positives:-Piolo giving another great performance as expected
Mallari,4110,7,jom_reviews,,120.0,ltbx,The standout for me was definitely JC; I view him as the Barry Keoghan of PH
Mallari,4110,8,jom_reviews,,120.0,ltbx,"-The horror elements were definitely effective, the theater audience really elevated the experience"
Mallari,4110,9,jom_reviews,,120.0,ltbx,"-Although it felt rushed, the film managed to tie together the different plots of the different timeframes properly"
Mallari,4111,1,panaderyanilinm,,180.0,ltbx,Some scenes of the movie caught me off guard but the reason why I rate this 4
Mallari,4111,2,panaderyanilinm,,180.0,ltbx,5 is because the musical scores instead of the story of the movie XD

Mallari,4114,2,keiize,,80.0,ltbx,"it looks like they tried to push it as a horror film by adding unnecessary ghosts, where it would have been better as just a thriller"
Mallari,4114,3,keiize,,80.0,ltbx,"the movie was already bad, but the ending somehow made it even worse"
Mallari,4114,4,keiize,,80.0,ltbx,the only thing i liked about this movie is the plot which i still consider to be mediocre
Mallari,4115,1,inclarkselement,,140.0,ltbx,good for a thriller film; some scenes are irrelevant though
Mallari,4116,1,borassi,,80.0,ltbx,nice concept (filipino folklore)
Mallari,4116,2,borassi,,80.0,ltbx,some scenes were unnecessary though
Mallari,4116,3,borassi,,80.0,ltbx,jump scares were so-so
Mallari,4117,1,piaisabel,,160.0,ltbx,A solid attempt at Filipino magical realism
Mallari,4117,2,piaisabel,,160.0,ltbx,Do not expect a historical horror film
Mallari,4117,3,piaisabel,,160.0,ltbx,The plot may diverge and expand needlessly but the core of the film is strong in its main character and thesis
Mallari,4117,4,piaisabel,,160.0,ltbx,"This will be my go-to film recommendation for any foreigner or diasporic Filipino looking to learn about Filipino culture: religion and spirituality, community justice, generational trauma, familial dependency, colonial and post-colonial society, and folklore"
Mallari,4118,1,gh0stz44,,100.0,ltbx,interesting concept with an uninteresting execution
Mallari,4118,2,gh0stz44,,100.0,ltbx,"i do love the catholic imagery, religious themes, filipino witchcraft and mythology combined with filipino history"

Mallari,4131,2,citronia,,120.0,ltbx,I did not expect to come out of the cinema witnessing a movie which is basically an amalgamation of multiple genres
Mallari,4131,3,citronia,,120.0,ltbx,"Mallari's strengths were its phenomenal acting from a star-studded cast, its great cinematography, and its pacing is okay"
Mallari,4131,4,citronia,,120.0,ltbx,"Mallari's weaknesses were its all over-the- place writing and personally, I think, the movie could've done better and not spoonfeed everything to the viewers and let them think for themselves"
Mallari,4131,5,citronia,,120.0,ltbx,"Also, it had tons of ineffective jumpscares that do not contribute anything to the plot and for some scenes, the scoring was kind of jarring and felt in-your-face"

Mallari,4133,2,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,Isang tanyag na kura paroko na nagngangalang Juan Severino Mallari ang pinaghihinalaang pumatay sa humigit kumulang 57 katao
Mallari,4133,3,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,"Sa pelikulang ito ni Direk Derick Cabrido, hindi lamang niya tinutukan ang buhay ni Father Severino bilang kauna-unahang serial killer sa Pilipinas, ito rin ay nagbibigay ng makabuluhang mensahe tungkol sa pag-ibig, bagamat isang nakakakilabot na representasyon ng pag-ibig, habang nilalakbay ang mga masalimuot na landas ng pagmamahal, kahit pa ito ay may kaakbay na panganib"
Mallari,4133,4,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,Talagang hindi matatawaran ang pagganap ng isa sa pinakakilalang aktor sa bansa na si Piolo Pascual
Mallari,4133,5,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,"Ibang ""Papa P"" ang makikita sa pelikulang ito"
Mallari,4133,6,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,"Iba't ibang pagkatao, iba't ibang emosyon, at iba't ibang kwento"
Mallari,4133,7,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,Hindi madali ang gumanap ng tatlong persona kaya kahanga-hanga ang ipinamalas ng aktor
Mallari,4133,8,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,Isa sa gusto kong karakter na ginampanan niya ay si Father Severino Mallari
Mallari,4133,9,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,"Nabigyan nya ng hustisya ang karakter na ito, makikita mo sa mga mata niya kung anong emosyon ang nais niyang ipahatid sa mga manonood"
Mallari,4133,10,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,"Takot, galit, at pagmamahal, walang duda, nakilala siya dahil sa kanyang angking galing"
Mallari,4133,11,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,"Gaya ni Piolo, ipinamalas rin ni JC Santos ang kanyang galing sa pag-arte na gumanap bilang Lucas"
Mallari,4133,12,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,"Isa siya sa pinakanagdala ng pelikula, kaya naman hindi nakakapagtaka na sya ang napiling bigyan ng parangal ng MMFF bilang Best Supporting Actor ngayong taon"
Mallari,4133,13,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,"Kakaiba ang atake na bitbit ng “Mallari” dahil hindi lamang nakasentro sa horror ang pelikula ngunit sumasaklaw din ito sa iba't ibang genre tulad ng thriller, sci-fi, folklore, kasaysayan, romance, at family drama"
Mallari,4133,14,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,Nakakamangha na napagsama-sama ito sa iisang pelikula
Mallari,4133,15,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,Mahusay nitong inilarawan ang kontradiksyon ng pag-ibig bilang isang biyaya at sumpa
Mallari,4133,16,feufilmsoc,,,ltbx,"Katulad ng sinabi sa pelikula “Ang isang tao ay kabuuan ng kaniyang mga desisyon, minamahal, at mga pagkakamali,"" gaano nga ba kalalim ang kaya nating isugal para sa pag-ibig"
Mallari,4135,1,maramaroon,,40.0,ltbx,at first i was so excited to watch this movie because the concept of telling the details of the life events of mallari and his victims was actually intriguing
Mallari,4135,2,maramaroon,,40.0,ltbx,and i was genuinely curious about the first documented serial killer in the philippines and it WAS good at first  when stuff was mysterious until unnecessary plots occurred like the whole manananggal thing  the time travelling thing could have worked but it didnt  i just think…

Mallari,4229,1,pearchip,,140.0,ltbx,"— PAPA P — jc santos i was not familiar with your game— felt like they gave things away in bits and pieces, a big reveal would’ve been cool— this movie didn’t need a romance angle… there were already so many genres and the romance didn’t contribute much to the story besides providing jonathan w a motivation— idk if the jumpscares rly just weren’t scary or if the noisy group of kids behind us in the cinema shattered the illusion LMAO— could’ve been more subtle in its scariness"
Mallari,4229,2,pearchip,,140.0,ltbx,— overall though i found this quite impressive
Mallari,4229,3,pearchip,,140.0,ltbx,(or maybe i’m just a history nerd)
Mallari,4230,1,l2nyt,,100.0,ltbx,"the plot can survive without the ghosts (mga taong itim mata at bibig), and the manananggal scene ruined the film"
Mallari,4231,1,lechonkawaii,,120.0,ltbx,Tried to do too much with its story but it was fun enough even with some noticeably bad cgi
Mallari,4231,2,lechonkawaii,,120.0,ltbx,Wish that Warner Bros budget went into more practical effects
Mallari,4231,3,lechonkawaii,,120.0,ltbx,And JC ate down
Mallari,4232,1,veiveigirl,,160.0,ltbx,papa p please save me i forgive your sins
Mallari,4232,2,veiveigirl,,160.0,ltbx,alot of unnecessary jumpscares but whatever… the plot was also kind of all over the place and predictable
Mallari,4232,3,veiveigirl,,160.0,ltbx,nakakabadtrip talaga yung ending di ko pa tanggap
Mallari,4232,4,veiveigirl,,160.0,ltbx,love makes u do crazy n selfish things… i guessang galing ng cast esp ni JC Santos
Mallari,4232,5,veiveigirl,,160.0,ltbx,im happy that prods are getting more creative and experimental with filipino horror folklore movies

Mallari,4239,1,kimpossible_,,180.0,ltbx,johnrey looking like freddie mercury
Mallari,4240,1,grborlongan,,120.0,ltbx,Intermittently falling asleep for the first hour due to the cheap scares but Mallari redeemed itself when it has begun unraveling its mysteries
Mallari,4241,1,kloudyday,,20.0,ltbx,it's trying to be many things at once
Mallari,4241,2,kloudyday,,20.0,ltbx,there's too many things going on and yet it failed to do even a single thing right
Mallari,4241,3,kloudyday,,20.0,ltbx,"i expected to be offered a glimpse into the mind of a filipino catholic priest and serial killer, fr"
Mallari,4241,4,kloudyday,,20.0,ltbx,"juan severino mallari (who's a real person btw), but all we get are these unnecessary and irrelevant characters, relationships, and subplots"
Mallari,4241,5,kloudyday,,20.0,ltbx,the writing and dialogue is so off and weird
Mallari,4241,6,kloudyday,,20.0,ltbx,"overall, it feels like a highschooler made this film"
Mallari,4243,1,xavegregorio,,100.0,ltbx,An entertaining watch if only you would completely suspend your disbelief
Mallari,4243,2,xavegregorio,,100.0,ltbx,"Otherwise, it is an intellectual nightmare, which is perhaps the real horror this film brings"
Mallari,4244,1,iamdamnation,,80.0,ltbx,"Not sure what I was expecting, but this was not it"
Mallari,4244,3,iamdamnation,,80.0,ltbx,"Look, the film was visually stunning from the cinematography, camera work, and transitions"
Mallari,4244,4,iamdamnation,,80.0,ltbx,I also didn’t mind the overbearing score and the acting was fine
Mallari,4244,5,iamdamnation,,80.0,ltbx,"I just wished the movie went on a different direction than this because the fantastical element - including the time travel, agawang sisiw, etc - while interesting, to some extent, felt too absurd and unnecessarily convoluted especially since this was based on a true story"
Mallari,4244,6,iamdamnation,,80.0,ltbx,The twists were frustratingly predictable and some of the jumpscares felt too heavy handed
Mallari,4244,7,iamdamnation,,80.0,ltbx,I wanted something more grounded and what I got was a gorgeous looking Pinoy horror film that gave me nothing other than a bunch of eye rolls and confused look
Mallari,4245,1,k0pikobianca,,80.0,ltbx,moral lesson: wag magpakatanga sa pag-ibigspoiler alert: tbh magandang philosophical discussion to about ethics kung papipiliin ka na papatay ka ng tao para mabuhay yung mahal mo (yung mga papatayin mong tao ay “evil” or “plague to the society”) or hahayaan mo na lang mamatay yung mahal moadditional review:-maganda yung production pero tangina ang daming unnecessary jumpscares sa umpisa ang corny na-di talaga mawawala sa horror films yung mga bobo moments no -minsan parang nanginginig yung camera HAHA -tanginang special fx yan  nagmukhang ET si gloria diaz naur -pogi ni piolo sa tatlong characters nya pero ang bobo mo johnathan -JANELLA SALVADOR SLAYED AS A MALIGNO KWEEN

Mallari,4279,2,hellopaolo,,120.0,ltbx,Mallari is a disappointing horror film filled with contrived jump scares
Mallari,4279,3,hellopaolo,,120.0,ltbx,It's overly ambitious with a really thin time travelling plot and heavy handed screenplay that tried to tie all three generations but failed to do so
Mallari,4279,4,hellopaolo,,120.0,ltbx,"Should've focused on ""first serial killer"" instead of it being a fantasy because the tragedy in all of it felt wasted"
Mallari,4279,5,hellopaolo,,120.0,ltbx,This really felt like a passion project of a folklore/ghost enthusiast with so much ideas in their mind

Mallari,4285,4,qrovers,,120.0,ltbx,or just focus on priest piolo… pls every scene set in 1800s was sooo good

Mallari,4292,1,bunnwatch,,140.0,ltbx,they multiversed a serial killerit could have gone somewhere with the main plot device – something about closed time loops and a haunting of hill house-style theme/take on ghosts – but on god the addition of demons & folklore made it messy
Mallari,4292,2,bunnwatch,,140.0,ltbx,the beginning was strong; but does it look like this script took at least 4 revisions
Mallari,4292,3,bunnwatch,,140.0,ltbx,cinematography for the most part good or decent and music goes hard and the actors are amazing but the script
Mallari,4292,6,bunnwatch,,140.0,ltbx,like there could have been a way to smoothly combine elements but the tropes of pinoy horror strike again and it could have hit (it did a lil bit) but ehhhh not completelyit's a good change to the mmff scene (i hope it influences a shift in horror filmmaking because something was there)

Mallari,4317,1,paperofaugust,,160.0,ltbx,Kind of predictable but it would still make you want to watch what happens next Watched this at the cinema alone and it’s the best experience to watch this (I think)
Mallari,4317,2,paperofaugust,,160.0,ltbx,In fairness hindi corny ‘yung pagka horror
Mallari,4317,3,paperofaugust,,160.0,ltbx,"Jumpscare ibang scenes talaga, ang funny din nung iba"

Mallari,4317,6,paperofaugust,,160.0,ltbx,Pero I think that’s what makes it more creepy in way
Mallari,4318,1,christianserdon,,100.0,ltbx,Mallari carries so much potential but completely loses all of it as the film tries to be a lot of things all at once
Mallari,4318,2,christianserdon,,100.0,ltbx,"Heavily relies on jumpscares to justify that it is indeed horror, but jumpscares, at this point, always come across as cheap and an easy way out for horror films, especially with the potential that Mallari holds"

Mallari,4320,1,__inaaah,,140.0,ltbx,"yes, my original rating is 3 stars but i give it an extra half because PIOLO PASCUAL'S BICEPS WERE SUCH A PHENOMENAL SCRUMPTIOUS THING TO LOOK AT"
Mallari,4321,1,i7zha,,120.0,ltbx,Has a good story line and great potential
Mallari,4321,2,i7zha,,120.0,ltbx,But sadly the cgi killed the suspense  either way twas a good film but the ending's vv disappointing (Jonathan
Mallari,4322,1,charmanderchrl,,100.0,ltbx,you could really feel that piolo is a veteran actor since you could tell the differences among the characters that he portrayed

Mallari,4326,3,emeryuh,,200.0,ltbx,ang ganda rin ng presentation ng mga background stories ng mga characters and how they tell the story of Father Severino Mallari
Mallari,4326,4,emeryuh,,200.0,ltbx,love ko rin yung consistency ng production design and also yung idea nilagyan nila ng touch of present times yung pagku-kuwento ng istorya ng mga Mallari
Mallari,4326,5,emeryuh,,200.0,ltbx,"plus,,, sobrang na-enlighten ako sa culture ng black magic and all during colonial period"

Mallari,4333,1,garbagekira,,120.0,ltbx,Would’ve been better if it was a historical crime thriller instead of a scifi horror crime historical fantasy whtvr clusterfuck
Mallari,4333,2,garbagekira,,120.0,ltbx,I mean—
Mallari,4334,1,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,The concept of time travel in storytelling is a nice approach
Mallari,4334,2,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,"It was well presented how the 3 different generations of Mallari were portrayed, but it also showcased that—even now and then, there’s a curse that has been happening in our country (in the context of societal injustices)"
Mallari,4334,3,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,“Ang isang tao ay kabuuan ng kanyang mga desisyon… minamahal… at mga pagkakamali
Mallari,4334,4,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,”The Love lies at the core of all three varieties of Mallari
Mallari,4334,5,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,"Two are driven by love for their spouses, and one is out of love for the mother"
Mallari,4334,6,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,"However, Jonathan and Juan Severino both have the trait of sacrificing others in order to save their loved ones"
Mallari,4334,7,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,"Johnray, however, gives his life to save everyone, even his loved ones"
Mallari,4334,8,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,It all leads me to the question: to what extents are we willing to go for the sake of love
Mallari,4334,9,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,"For the production, when it comes to horror, it’s either you go big or go home"
Mallari,4334,10,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,"This means that to be able to justify the concept of a horror film, you will need to exert a lot of effort in executing it, from cinematography, lights, sound design, production design, and wardrobe & prosthetics"
Mallari,4334,11,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,"I applaud the sound design that carried the whole jump scare, the lights that signified each scenery, the PD, wardrobe, & hmu, who emphasized the time frame, symbolism, and their story as a character"
Mallari,4334,12,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,"Though there are some unnecessary parts and certain areas that could use of improvement, but overall, I applaud how well they have shown the history, culture, and Filipino myths in this film"
Mallari,4334,13,matchartsy,,200.0,ltbx,"The messages they unfold about societal issues, needs to be recognized more; hence, they tackle serious issues such as the injustice killing which represents the EJK, and how the lgbtq community is still considered as part of the “salot ng lipunan”, and many more, that are still happening today"
Mallari,4335,1,winnpapel,,160.0,ltbx,I appreciate the musical scoring
Mallari,4335,2,winnpapel,,160.0,ltbx,JC Santos deserves to win best supporting actor in MMFF
Mallari,4335,3,winnpapel,,160.0,ltbx,That Piolo-Janella chemistry has potencial I must say
Mallari,4335,4,winnpapel,,160.0,ltbx,I liked how they connected the dots in each eras and timelines
Mallari,4335,5,winnpapel,,160.0,ltbx,But why does a buried Piolo did not age at all if he did not eat any organs
Mallari,4335,6,winnpapel,,160.0,ltbx,They need that to defy aging right
Mallari,4335,7,winnpapel,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, thinking if this will have part 2"
Mallari,4335,8,winnpapel,,160.0,ltbx,I want to end my review emphasizing that Piolo Pascual is insanely hot
Mallari,4336,1,milopoke,,120.0,ltbx,Pros:- An incredibly engaging time-travel plot point- The color grading in this was BEAUTIFUL- Piolo Pascual's Tatiana Maslany era - JC Santos proving once again that he can act the house down boots alongside veterans- Gloria Diaz actually using her acting muscles
Mallari,4336,2,milopoke,,120.0,ltbx,- The second half of probably has the TIGHTEST writing for a Pinoy horror movie - 1940s Piolo Pascual can GET IT Cons:- Janella and Piolo have ZERO chemistry it's actually…

Mallari,4363,2,vincentbg,,140.0,ltbx,sadt that it wasn't pushed much better towards it
Mallari,4363,3,vincentbg,,140.0,ltbx,"film's narrative is wholesome, Piolo atleast gave a justice to it, it's just that the internal monologues sounded too unnatural and scripted"
Mallari,4363,4,vincentbg,,140.0,ltbx,some jumpscares were so random

Mallari,4405,5,alocasean,,120.0,ltbx,"The constant flashbacks and sudden time jumps were bordering on overkill, I personally would’ve enjoyed if the movie was sectioned into three parts instead to have a consistent story line because trying to decipher each time period’s plot made the movie feel longer than it actually was"
Mallari,4405,6,alocasean,,120.0,ltbx,Reading the wikipedia plot was more entertaining
Mallari,4405,7,alocasean,,120.0,ltbx,"Also, what the hell is this movie’s lightning problem"
Mallari,4405,8,alocasean,,120.0,ltbx,A majority of the jump scares are either the killer or ghosts in the background but I wouldn’t know because I couldn’t see shit
Mallari,4405,9,alocasean,,120.0,ltbx,"Speaking of jump scares, Philippine cinema needs to find new ways of scaring its viewers rather than the typical ~scary image~ with loud music"
Mallari,4405,10,alocasean,,120.0,ltbx,"I admit, some of it worked, but the tension in teasing a potential jump scare is more memorable than a lousy 5 second scare imo"
Mallari,4405,11,alocasean,,120.0,ltbx,Or maybe I’m just used to the American horror movie industry and the likes of Blumhouse or A24
Mallari,4405,12,alocasean,,120.0,ltbx,"To cut it sweet, the parts I liked: the hospital scene at the end being shown in the beginning, each Mallari’s origins in how all three ended up being in one room at the same time shown throughout the movie, Janella Salvador, the manananggal reveal, generational Alarcon vs Mallari, Piolo Pascual’s acting, and the overall filmography of it all"
Mallari,4405,13,alocasean,,120.0,ltbx,Would I watch it again
Mallari,4405,14,alocasean,,120.0,ltbx,"Mhm, probably not"

Mallari,4409,14,monicachelsey,,200.0,ltbx,"Cinematography: Seamless and Experimental Since the story has 3 different timelines, it jumps from one timeline to another and super clean ng transitions"
Mallari,4409,15,monicachelsey,,200.0,ltbx,Experimental in a way na they’ve incorporated transitions to jump from one dialogue to another and from one Mallari to the next Mallari in another timeline
Mallari,4409,16,monicachelsey,,200.0,ltbx,"For the color grading, *chef’s kiss* it speaks for itself and bawat history ng family nila seamless ang colors"

Mallari,4409,27,monicachelsey,,200.0,ltbx,"With the added themes, it’s too chaotic, in somewhat a good way"

Mallari,4451,2,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"Personally, I might be in the minority who thinks that, with reports of Mallari showing signs of mental instability around the same time of his killing spree, the film would have worked better as a psychological thriller, sans the folk horror aspect"
Mallari,4451,3,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,The filmmakers seemingly took advantage of the paucity of verifiable records about the man's life — so much that the liberties they took just screams 'WOW'
Mallari,4451,4,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"Mallari, in its sheer unapologetic glory, is a very interesting mess"
Mallari,4451,5,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"As an alchemy of historical thriller and folk horror, at times it becomes too tiring, that audiences can be forgiven for expecting scares before they even appear onscreen"
Mallari,4451,6,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"This marriage ultimately combusts in the end, leaving only one of the two as the last genre standing"
Mallari,4451,7,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"And for that, flaws and all, I feel Mallari deserves a closer look for its guts to prioritize jump scares to frighten its audiences shitless; even if by doing so, it compromises history — and the last ounces of accuracy remaining — by putting it on the back burner"

Mallari,4460,3,junasine,,120.0,ltbx,the jumpscares are just there to add more “horror” when the story itself is already scary as it is
Mallari,4460,4,junasine,,120.0,ltbx,some scenes do not make any sense
Mallari,4460,5,junasine,,120.0,ltbx,but piolo and jc’s acting skills are to be aplauded

Mallari,4499,5,korthius,,140.0,ltbx,"however, i really wish the movie didn't use jump scares so much to double down on its horror"
Mallari,4499,6,korthius,,140.0,ltbx,"the atmosphere, sound design, and camerawork were plentiful in creating a suspenseful environment, but because of how many telegraphed jump scares there are, i ended up simply waiting for the surprise rather than immersing in the movie"

Mallari,4507,2,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,May inaasahan na ako sa Mallari dahil sa mga magagandang salita na nabasa ko
Mallari,4507,3,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,Pero hindi naging sarado para hindi maging sariwa ang pagkilala ko sa pelikula
Mallari,4507,4,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,Mabilis na ipinakilala ang karakter
Mallari,4507,5,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,Hindi sila nagpahaba ng paghihintay bago mo malaman kung tungkol saan ang pelikula
Mallari,4507,6,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,"Ngunit sa simula pa lang, alam mo na yung inihahanda nilang ibunyag sa dulo ng pelikula"
Mallari,4507,7,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,May mga panahon napabilib ako sa paraan ng editing at pagkuha ng eksena pero hindi ito naging sapat para mailatag ng malinaw ang istorya
Mallari,4507,8,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,May iilang eksena na hindi nakatulong sa pagkukwento bagkus nag-iwan lamang ng mga katanungan hindi na nabigyan ng kasagutan
Mallari,4507,9,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,Maayos ang ipinakita ni Piolo pero hindi ako tiyak kung ito ay kayang magpanalo sa kanya ng parangal
Mallari,4507,10,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,Pero gusto ko at nararapat siyang bigyan ng pagkilala sa maraming karakter na ginampanan niya
Mallari,4507,11,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,"Kung pagbabasehan ang akting na ipinakita, SI JC Santos ang magbubuhat ng bandera sa gabi ng parangal"
Mallari,4507,12,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,Mahusay at nararapat ang ipinakita niya
Mallari,4507,13,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,Medyo naguluhan lang ako sa mga manunulat kung anong kwento ba ang gusto nila para sa mga manunuod

Mallari,4507,16,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,Hindi ko alam kung sa sinehan ba o sadyang ganun ang pagka-edit ng pelikula
Mallari,4507,17,jastinjohnson,,80.0,ltbx,"Oo, isa itong pelikulang magpapatalon sa iyo sa kinauupuan gamit ang biswal at tunog ngunit napasobra ata ito sa lakas kumpara sa mga napanuod natin may ganitong tema"

Mallari,4517,1,againstthetide,,100.0,ltbx,the poison drips through
Mallari,4518,1,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,(Note: This review contains spoilers
Mallari,4518,2,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,)This is certainly one of the most bizarre films I’ve ever seen
Mallari,4518,3,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"I entered the theater expecting a retelling of Juan Severino Mallari’s story in the form of a slasher film, but ended up witnessing something completely different"
Mallari,4518,4,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,My expectations were completely subverted
Mallari,4518,5,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"The film took so much creative license and put some fantasy and supernatural twists on Juan Severino Mallari’s story, which is really inventive"
Mallari,4518,6,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"But while I do appreciate this creative effort, I was not quite satisfied with its outcome"
Mallari,4518,7,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"As much as I want to give lots of praises to the film, I believe it has some flaws, which, unfortunately, brought down its quality"
Mallari,4518,8,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"Frankly, the film was too ambitious"
Mallari,4518,9,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,It tried too hard to present a complex and mind-boggling concept but ended up executing it poorly
Mallari,4518,10,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"Hence, when I left the theater, I felt that something was missing"
Mallari,4518,11,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,The film didn’t turn out to be as impressive and groundbreaking as I expected it to be
Mallari,4518,12,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"Perhaps, they should have just focused on the time travel aspect, because that was done brilliantly"
Mallari,4518,13,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,Fusing it with Juan Severino Mallari’s story and excessive supernatural elements ruined what could have been an amazing time-travel historical film
Mallari,4518,14,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,The foundation was already there
Mallari,4518,15,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"It would’ve created something truly impressive and groundbreaking, until… the poor execution of the story’s very ambitious plot"
Mallari,4518,16,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"Also, the dialogues were clunky"
Mallari,4518,17,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,Many of the conversations between characters who are supposedly close to one another felt forced and awkward
Mallari,4518,18,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,An example is when Jonathan suddenly shouted at Lucas after the latter butted in on his conversation with Agnes
Mallari,4518,19,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"His shouting came out of nowhere, and it felt so forced"
Mallari,4518,20,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"Sure, he was angry at Lucas, but I didn’t feel its emotional weight due to how forced it was"
Mallari,4518,21,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"(I’m aware of the reason for Jonathan’s anger, it’s the clunky dialogue that’s the problem"
Mallari,4518,22,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,") There are more instances like this throughout the film, and it really bothered me"
Mallari,4518,23,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"The timing of the dialogues, as well as the choice of words, were really off"
Mallari,4518,24,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"But despite my gripes with the film, I’m gonna give it three stars because it has some redeeming qualities"
Mallari,4518,25,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,Among these are Piolo Pascual and JC Santos’ impeccable performances
Mallari,4518,26,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,I was absolutely impressed with how Piolo was able to portray three different characters while putting certain nuances to each of them
Mallari,4518,27,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"The three characters are really different from one another, and you could tell that based on their individual demeanors, personalities, and body languages, which Piolo fantastically depicted"
Mallari,4518,28,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"I really hope he wins an award for this, because not many actors could pull this off"
Mallari,4518,29,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"And JC Santos… man, he really deserves his Best Supporting Actor award"
Mallari,4518,30,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"Even though I was able to predict it easily, I had goosebumps when his character, Lucas, turned out to be the killer in the present day"
Mallari,4518,31,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,JC pulled off the Jekyll and Hyde persona so well
Mallari,4518,32,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,He should do this type of role more often
Mallari,4518,33,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"Furthermore, the film did well when it comes to building suspense"
Mallari,4518,34,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"Although it is not as scary as typical horror films, the jump scares were still frightening"
Mallari,4518,35,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"Additionally, the score and sound effects were spectacular — they fitted every scene perfectly and greatly intensified the eerie atmosphere of the film"
Mallari,4518,36,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,And the pacing was surprisingly good
Mallari,4518,37,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"In contrast to most long films, I wasn’t bothered with the runtime of this one"
Mallari,4518,38,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,Most scenes were paced appropriately
Mallari,4518,39,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"Overall, disregarding my criticisms, I enjoyed watching this film"
Mallari,4518,40,imjustdrey,,120.0,ltbx,"It had a lot of wasted potential, but it still gave me a nice cinematic experience"
Mallari,4519,1,caminavanessa,,100.0,ltbx,It was nice until it got
Mallari,4519,3,caminavanessa,,100.0,ltbx,"Decent jump scares, but that was just me shouting at everything"
Mallari,4520,1,heyimspidey,,140.0,ltbx,He did all that and for what
Mallari,4520,2,heyimspidey,,140.0,ltbx,"But I will say it's a good slasher type film, has good enough scares and the filipino folklore into it"
Mallari,4520,3,heyimspidey,,140.0,ltbx,"Was surprised to see english subtitles already in place, so definitely will recommend to foreign oomfs if it's out digitally"
Mallari,4521,1,jayclops,,140.0,ltbx,"Missteps along the way, still I'm giving it plus (pogi papa p) pts for the ambitious adaptation of a material & fashioning some kind of a pinoy folk/urban legend concoction"
Mallari,4521,2,jayclops,,140.0,ltbx,JC Santos dasurv
Mallari,4522,1,mewxtong,,140.0,ltbx,Want to like this movie… but the climax/resolution wasn’t really giving
Mallari,4522,2,mewxtong,,140.0,ltbx,I didn’t feel the motivation behind the choice by the finale

Mallari,4525,3,yan_son,,160.0,ltbx,"It's not that scary, and I am not a fan of how they execute the jump scares, but I enjoyed the storyline, and it is definitely a step up"

Mallari,4552,3,janiene,,20.0,ltbx,"The rare silver linings were how Kapampangan was spoken throughout the film and JC Santos' performance, but I agree with popular sentiments: it was promising but overambitious, which resulted in a half-baked film with visual jumpscares that looked like TikTok filters"
Mallari,4552,4,janiene,,20.0,ltbx,"It also felt like the crew involved hated its future audience, getting ahead of themselves with ""pa-woke"" references and poor depiction of a LGBTQ character"
Mallari,4552,5,janiene,,20.0,ltbx,"I know the movie was about folk spirituality gone awry, but I guess I just expected more compassion from a movie related to religion"

Mallari,4676,2,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,"What makes people even more excited is that this is lead actor #PioloPascual 's first horror film to date, after being tried and tested in romance/drama/comedy genres"
Mallari,4676,3,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,"This is among the final batch of films announced to be a part of the festival shortlist, which now has 2 entries more than its usual 8"
Mallari,4676,4,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,"In this film, Pascual plays three distinct characters in different time periods: Doctor Jonathan (present time), war documentarian Johnrey (1940s) and the serial killer Fr"
Mallari,4676,5,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,Severino (1800s)
Mallari,4676,6,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,"Individually, these key characters all face the fears of their respective eras, while their paths converge in one hidden room of the Mallari mansion"
Mallari,4676,7,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,"It is delightful to watch Pascual step up his game in portraying the triple characters with distinct personalities, perhaps one of the most memorable performances in this festival"
Mallari,4676,8,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,"However, #JCSantos brings out the real surprise of this film and there's genuine terror in his character's ultimate reveal"
Mallari,4676,9,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,"If only the CGI effects were polished and convincing enough, then its horrific atmosphere may have been consistent"
Mallari,4676,10,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,The film sure took a risk in mixing a lot of elements that could be too much to absorb in one sitting
Mallari,4676,11,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,"Honestly, I would've wanted it to focus more on the killer priest and explore his psyche on a deeper level - his internal battles and the impact of his killings"
Mallari,4676,12,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,"The concept of an astral time travel could be saved on another film, the blood relation of the three leads may already be used to explain their connection"
Mallari,4676,13,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,They could've used the time building up the crime-horror-folklore angles rather than explain all the sci-fi
Mallari,4676,14,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,"Still, Mallari is a good attempt at elevating our taste in cinema"
Mallari,4676,15,lerryjohnofcl,,140.0,ltbx,May this inspire more filmmakers to experiment in the horror genre

Mallari,4678,1,acethetical,,100.0,ltbx,really rootong for this ever since but was disappointed  overhyped
Mallari,4678,2,acethetical,,100.0,ltbx,the movie started with a lot of potential but ends with a messy and too ambitious plot
Mallari,4678,3,acethetical,,100.0,ltbx,it became like a freak show by including too many philippine folk elements
Mallari,4679,1,joshleen,,120.0,ltbx,"for being based on the true story of the first filipino serial killer, the plot was pretty good, but could've def been executed better"
Mallari,4680,1,nedelacruz_,,120.0,ltbx,MMFF #1nakaabot rin ng mmff

Mallari,4685,2,coochiemeowmeow,,120.0,ltbx,Dona focunda flying caught me off guard  Wouldve been better if she looked more ill rather than transforming to a mananggal  it was so unnecessary (same with johnrey cause wtf a werewolf
Mallari,4685,4,coochiemeowmeow,,120.0,ltbx,Should’ve focused more on the story buildup in the beginning instead of putting unnecessary jumpscares (but the subtle ones )

Mallari,4689,1,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,I think what makes many people disappointed at this film was because they assumed it'd be true to historical fact
Mallari,4689,2,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,"I came in with no knowledge and expectations, so I loved the ride"
Mallari,4689,3,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,It's amazing to think this is a local film
Mallari,4689,4,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,"Great pacing, clear cut differentiation from each character/ timeline, and surprisingly the film was able to ease in sci-fi and supernatural concepts smoothly even if it was a bit out of left field"
Mallari,4689,5,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,"I honestly enjoyed the film, and it felt like going on a ride where you'd think it'll end soon, but turns out there's another part to explore and visit"
Mallari,4689,6,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,"It gave me the same amazement as I had with Parasite, with how the film felt like 3 movies in 1"
Mallari,4689,7,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,"So yeah, that was cool"

Mallari,4691,1,inherprod,,200.0,ltbx,"To watch again a horror movie coming from a Philippines cinema, this entry for MMFF is top tier with a partnership with warner bros it enhances the quality and not typical horror story of mallari"
Mallari,4691,2,inherprod,,200.0,ltbx,From its cinematography to production you can tell that they put a lot of time to have this outcome of film
Mallari,4691,3,inherprod,,200.0,ltbx,Papa p played the threr great roles of mallari without leaving a hang part all the characters played by papa p left no crumbs
Mallari,4691,4,inherprod,,200.0,ltbx,And also are we not to talk about ellise joson character

Mallari,4692,1,zhendiary,,120.0,ltbx,actually quite a decent filipino horror film
Mallari,4692,2,zhendiary,,120.0,ltbx,i liked the storytelling techniques of time-traveling throughout generations + the relevance of the church in ph history

Mallari,4699,5,imbtan,,140.0,ltbx,Medyo cheesy lang mga linyahan especially pag nagenglish na
Mallari,4699,6,imbtan,,140.0,ltbx,Tawa ako ng tawa nung sinabi yung astral projection HAHAHA
Mallari,4699,7,imbtan,,140.0,ltbx,Yung horror aspect niya hindi ko nafeel
Mallari,4699,8,imbtan,,140.0,ltbx,Medyo pilit yung jumpscares and heavily reliant sila sa audio cues
Mallari,4699,9,imbtan,,140.0,ltbx,Hindi rin ako kinakabahan throughout sa movie
Mallari,4699,10,imbtan,,140.0,ltbx,Siguro kasi walang stakes na napepresent
Mallari,4699,11,imbtan,,140.0,ltbx,Nakita ko rin yung effort nila mag CGI kaso derecho kaagad sa uncanny valley

Mallari,4701,2,drea_cbln,,180.0,ltbx,"Hindi masyadong horror yung atake and feel ko oa lang yung jumpscare, parang nilagay lang para maging ""horror"" yung film"
Mallari,4701,3,drea_cbln,,180.0,ltbx,Ang ganda ng cinematography kaya madali rin maintindihan yung pag jump sa three generation
Mallari,4701,4,drea_cbln,,180.0,ltbx,"And tbh, na impress din talaga ako sa acting ni Piolo since bihira ako makanood ng films niya"
Mallari,4701,5,drea_cbln,,180.0,ltbx,Only meh part sa film nung may nag transform kasi going well na yung story tapos may ganon HSHAHAHA idk what to feel doon
Mallari,4701,6,drea_cbln,,180.0,ltbx,Spoiler Alert
Mallari,4701,7,drea_cbln,,180.0,ltbx,Kinda disappointed ako sa ending since I thought ang whole essence ng ginagawa ni Jonathan is para ma break ang curse ng pamilyang Mallari then ganon ginawa
Mallari,4701,8,drea_cbln,,180.0,ltbx,"I mean kahit ako naman kung si Janella need iligtas, ito na kunin niyo na ko kimmy pero I expected lang na something like that magiging ending"

Mallari,4704,3,chloerod,,100.0,ltbx,Um kind of ambitious/convoluted plot but i was really invested in knowing what happens next
Mallari,4704,4,chloerod,,100.0,ltbx,we all agreed that it would have been better as a mini-series
Mallari,4704,5,chloerod,,100.0,ltbx,"Filipino horror is so camp its kind of awesome, but I always yearn for something more"
Mallari,4704,6,chloerod,,100.0,ltbx,as a culture we have A LOT of material

Mallari,4712,2,celinaa_,,180.0,ltbx,but despite all that this was still well executed imo  minus 0
Mallari,4712,3,celinaa_,,180.0,ltbx,5 star lang kasi predictable na si lucas una pa lang

Mallari,4743,2,jinuelzymon,,80.0,ltbx,"anyway, i appreciate that mallari tried to be complex and different, a horror-fantasy and historical fiction, i saw that they really tried but i wasn't impressed"
Mallari,4743,3,jinuelzymon,,80.0,ltbx,the sound effects was its strongest point
Mallari,4743,4,jinuelzymon,,80.0,ltbx,the dialogue and some scene executions were awkward
Mallari,4743,5,jinuelzymon,,80.0,ltbx,they failed so bad to achieve the effect of suspense
Mallari,4743,6,jinuelzymon,,80.0,ltbx,yes it's unusual and different if i compare it to other mainstream filipino films but the proper execution wasn't just
Mallari,4743,8,jinuelzymon,,80.0,ltbx,this would work so well in a comics or webtoon format

Mallari,4746,1,jnnlnpbnn,,100.0,ltbx,"i agree that it was too ambitious—and for its own good, perhaps—that it ended up seeming like they couldn’t choose just one thing to go with so they tried to fit it all in the 2-hour duration of the film (huhu)"
Mallari,4746,2,jnnlnpbnn,,100.0,ltbx,"one thing na hindi ko din makalimutan na i’m unsure baka misstep lang or sumn: yung batang babae, who encountered a ghost during their “tour”, said when she got out na “pinapaabot nila” or sumn along that line"

Mallari,4747,2,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,”How far will you go for love
Mallari,4747,3,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,I believe this is the theme of the movie
Mallari,4747,4,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,"Father Mallari is a real figure in Philippines history, the first documented serial killer in the country"
Mallari,4747,5,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,The movie tells his story from the angle of love and madness
Mallari,4747,6,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,"After some researches, I found that the real Father Mallari might have acted with love or he had mental issues"
Mallari,4747,7,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,"This movie is a fiction based on the real story of Father Mallari; it has a very mysterious background and I like the darkness it presented and how the story didn’t end with political correctness; however, the ending couldn’t have ended earlier"
Mallari,4747,8,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,"Nevertheless, there are too many jump scares (with unnecessarily too strong sound effect), which didn’t help pushing the plot forward and made it draggy"
Mallari,4747,9,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,"The acting range (and muscles) of Piolo are amazing; his has 4-style in the movie, if you watch close enough, there is a small detail for the style of Johnathan"
Mallari,4747,10,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,"Since Piolo has a mole near his left ear, to further differentiate the style of Johnrey and Johnathan, his mole was removed (likely by CG) when he plays Johnathan"

Mallari,4747,12,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,"The buildup of atmosphere is great, technical aspects are pretty impressive like visual effect, lighting and scores"
Mallari,4747,13,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,"However, editing seems to be another issue"
Mallari,4747,14,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,"For example, the scene where Father Mallari just returned home and almost encountered Johnrey and Johnathan, had repeated 3-time in the movie"
Mallari,4747,15,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,Is it really necessary or audiences would be that absent-minded
Mallari,4747,16,snowstage,,120.0,ltbx,"I’m not sure whether relatively jumpy editing is the storytelling style of Director Cabrido, because his last movie      also has this issue"

Mallari,4757,4,_boxtina,,140.0,ltbx,napagtagpi nila lahat sa kwento
Mallari,4757,5,_boxtina,,140.0,ltbx,"malayo na ang nararating ng philippine horror, pero malayo pa talaga; sana lang mas gory yung film kasi abt sa serial killer nga naman yung kwento"

Mallari,4758,25,bebigorl,,20.0,ltbx,"Ayon pa pala, walang chemistry yung mga actors, esp si papa p at janella at elisse"
Mallari,4758,26,bebigorl,,20.0,ltbx,Parang pilit na pilit yung relationship

Mallari,4758,28,bebigorl,,20.0,ltbx,"Ang ambitious ng movie na toh, parang ang daming gustong talakayin na topics pero sa sobrang dami, ayon, underdeveloped lahat"
Mallari,4758,29,bebigorl,,20.0,ltbx,Dat kase isa isa lang

Mallari,4763,4,pjramoss,,180.0,ltbx,"The film showcased into the nuanced relationship between religion, kulam, hierarchy, and also shows on how mental illness was once a taboo topic (till now lol)"

Mallari,4788,1,jhonmark,,120.0,ltbx,- a must watch for fans of horror films- enjoyed how it didn't rely on scares despite being a horror film and instead focused on developing the plot- it was also interesting how the concept of time traveling was included- loved the incorporation of Filipino mythology without feeling tacky or cheap- quite successful in its overall execution and didn't feel overwhelming even with the flashbacks between three different time periods and with the added concepts of serial killing and time traveling

Mallari,4808,1,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,A familiar yet refreshing take on Filipino horror
Mallari,4808,2,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,Mallari served as the frontrunner for last year’s MMFF months before the festival
Mallari,4808,3,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,"Trailers were good and promotions were good as well, but what surprised me is the difference between the final film and these promotional materials"
Mallari,4808,4,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,I was expecting Mallari to be Psychological Thriller or a slasher film but it was meddled with paranormal and time travel
Mallari,4808,5,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,"You can already pinpoint who the killer is in the first 30 minutes of the film, which is a bummer"
Mallari,4808,6,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,JC Santos gave a splendid performance but his character and the twist of the story could be done better
Mallari,4808,7,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,"Magulo yung first act, it felt like marami silang gustong ilagay sa marrative"
Mallari,4808,8,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,Lines were cringy and walang tao sa totoong buhay na ganon mag salita
Mallari,4808,9,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,"The film also had unnecessary jumpscares na walang purpose sa story, very Filipino horror movie core"
Mallari,4808,10,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,The second and the last act is where the story started to take ita shape and form
Mallari,4808,11,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,I was glued down to my seats with what I was watching
Mallari,4808,12,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,Magulo ang simula pero natahi nila nang maayos ang lahat ng elemento sa dulo which is what made me like this film despite its issues
Mallari,4808,13,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual showed how great he was in his craft
Mallari,4808,14,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,Sa pelikulang ito makikita mo kung bakit sought after si Piolo
Mallari,4808,15,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,"Janella Salvador was also great in this movie, she can be the queen of filipino horror movies"
Mallari,4808,16,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,"Sound design and the set designs were my favorite, dito mo makikitang pinaghandaan at may malaking budget ang palabas na ito"
Mallari,4808,17,ayesak21,,140.0,ltbx,Mallari has some of the elements of a bad and cringey horror movies but it also has refreshing takes on a newer form of horror and storytelling that uses a lore to expound on a subject matter

Mallari,4819,1,myscenery,,140.0,ltbx,was originally planning to give this movie 4 stars since i genuinely had a good ol fun camp time
Mallari,4819,2,myscenery,,140.0,ltbx,"laughed at some of its absurd parts but in hindsight, this is not a comedy film"
Mallari,4819,3,myscenery,,140.0,ltbx,"it was entertaining enough to me since the premise is really interesting, but its narrative get more ridiculous as the story progresses"
Mallari,4819,4,myscenery,,140.0,ltbx,"still love the cinematography tho (except for that aswang cgi effect in that one scene, wished they just showed its shadow like what they did in the werewolf transformation), and i think this could really be a proper horror thriller film if they didnt over complicate things haha"

Mallari,4823,5,luisadearos,,120.0,ltbx,But I love Piolo and JC soooo :>>
Mallari,4824,1,sandiinas,,120.0,ltbx,"solid effort- garbage ending and story stops making sense pretty early on, and lots of “””homages””” to existing horror franchises that are so obvious they’re distracting lol"
Mallari,4824,2,sandiinas,,120.0,ltbx,"great cast though, they do their best with what theyre given"
Mallari,4825,1,sigmagosling69,,180.0,ltbx,"Second watch, loved it even more"
Mallari,4825,2,sigmagosling69,,180.0,ltbx,Philippine Cinema is so back
Mallari,4825,3,sigmagosling69,,180.0,ltbx,I'm obsessed with it
Mallari,4825,4,sigmagosling69,,180.0,ltbx,Mallari is an incredibly well-executed Filipino horror film and has now become a personal favorite
Mallari,4825,5,sigmagosling69,,180.0,ltbx,I've never cared much about local films until now because they've significantly improved
Mallari,4827,1,chouheavenly6,,120.0,ltbx,imagine ilang dekada mo ibinaon yung sumpa para lang hukayin ulit
Mallari,4828,1,yannaj,,140.0,ltbx,Okay na sana yung storyline kung di lang nagfly-fly si lola
Mallari,4828,2,yannaj,,140.0,ltbx,Naging fiction pa tuloy
Mallari,4828,3,yannaj,,140.0,ltbx,Should be focus only on being a serial killer without magical/non realistoc elements in the story
Mallari,4828,4,yannaj,,140.0,ltbx,JC acting is really great
Mallari,4828,5,yannaj,,140.0,ltbx,I already predicted what's gonna happen in just 20mins watching the movie
Mallari,4829,1,awanik0,,120.0,ltbx,"And that’s how you do a nonlinear narrative, Philippine Cinema"
Mallari,4830,1,thatguyrobertt,,200.0,ltbx,Should’ve been the best picture
Mallari,4830,2,thatguyrobertt,,200.0,ltbx,Story is intact
Mallari,4830,3,thatguyrobertt,,200.0,ltbx,Actors were great especially JC Santos despite having limited screentime
Mallari,4830,4,thatguyrobertt,,200.0,ltbx,He easily Outshined Piolo who is by the way representing 3 characters
Mallari,4830,5,thatguyrobertt,,200.0,ltbx,Would also like to commend Janella Salvador’s sultry and fierce persona throughout the movie
Mallari,4830,6,thatguyrobertt,,200.0,ltbx,One of the best Filipino movie of all time
Mallari,4830,7,thatguyrobertt,,200.0,ltbx,Only downfall of this movie was the CGI effects but I’ll let it pass
Mallari,4830,8,thatguyrobertt,,200.0,ltbx,"Just like in “Nocebo,” I’m really invested and got curious about the “sisiw” (chick) tradition that’s passed to generations"
Mallari,4830,9,thatguyrobertt,,200.0,ltbx,Would really like to study about it
Mallari,4831,1,jandrikc,,120.0,ltbx,it took me a while to digest the movie
Mallari,4831,2,jandrikc,,120.0,ltbx,"anyway, the casting and cinematography were SUPERB janella and piolo really took me by surprise kasi 'di ako naniwala na magw-work yung chemistry nila pero it did, also ang galing ng mga batang artista na cast"
Mallari,4831,3,jandrikc,,120.0,ltbx,"when it comes sa plot, siguro na-off lang ako doon sa manananggal and werewolf part"
Mallari,4831,4,jandrikc,,120.0,ltbx,HOWEVER gets ko rin kasi parang that's a part of our culture (
Mallari,4831,5,jandrikc,,120.0,ltbx,"), may mga manananggal, kulam, tikbalang, kung…"
Mallari,4832,1,joulethegreat,,120.0,ltbx,The 'mananangal' scene made it off
Mallari,4833,1,br_owen,,120.0,ltbx,The manananggal scene is so off
Mallari,4833,2,br_owen,,120.0,ltbx,Cinematography and color grading are good tho
Mallari,4834,1,stargaezed,,120.0,ltbx,piolo pascual
Mallari,4835,1,annebaz,,120.0,ltbx,Good k lang
Mallari,4836,1,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,Perhaps the most surprising aspect of Mallari is how the director Derick Cabrido managed to weave together a staggering amount of narrative threads and somehow still ended up with a cohesive story
Mallari,4836,2,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Although the same thing cannot be said about its many thematic layers that often felt convoluted and reactionary, there is something to be admired (or at least respected) with how textually rich Cabrido aims his film to be"
Mallari,4836,3,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Albeit inferred only through the choice of time periods (1818/1948/2018), Mallari succeeds in tracing a historical and cultural perspective on the Duterte drug war–that of a messianic figure (Duterte/Fr"
Mallari,4836,4,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Mallari) assuming the role of both judge and executioner of perceived ""plagues"" of society (the sinful/addicts)–and clearly demonstrates why this is problematic and is ultimately an act of self-preservation"
Mallari,4836,5,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"The film takes a firm stance against mass murder, especially when it is enacted by the elites, and in the current Filipino socio-political climate this sentiment is well-appreciated"
Mallari,4836,6,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"However, Mallari's portrayal of folk religion/mythology vis-a-vis Christianity is rather questionable"
Mallari,4836,7,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"On one hand the film explores its anti-colonial capacity, that its integration into a Western notion of Christianity did not necessarily result into assimilation; indeed, through sinister shots littered with religious figurines (rooted in pagan worship) and the psychological corruption of Fr"
Mallari,4836,8,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Mallari's morals, the film shows that folk traditions' effects and influences have stood the test of time and could even be argued as the primary feature through which Filipinos practice modern Christianity"
Mallari,4836,9,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"On the other hand, however, Mallari is still unable to resist the hegemonic assumptions that these folk practices are inherently evil; they may be anti-colonial but they're just as bad, maybe even worse"
Mallari,4836,10,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,They function mainly to bolster the film's hypothesis—that evil is the primary component of the world and that everything else exist only in relation to it
Mallari,4836,11,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"This argument is most explicitly shown through the construction of Casa Mallari as a liminal space, where different temporal (past, present, future) and existential (living and non-living) realities converge"
Mallari,4836,12,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"This is also the reason why the scares, although seemingly imitating the effect of sudden shock, are deliberately designed to evoke diminishing affective returns; fear is not an anomaly in the film's diegesis but is rather the norm, further supporting the essentialist view of the world and humanity as evil"
Mallari,4836,13,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"And although this position works within the confines of the horror genre in which Mallari operates, I remain not fully sold on such bleak and defeatist attitude"
Mallari,4836,14,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"I'd rather believe that there exist other ""manlalakbays"" (time travelers) with the capacity to intervene and put an end to this cycle of violence"
Mallari,4837,2,ssmidas,,60.0,ltbx,nice score though
Mallari,4838,2,hachicave,,100.0,ltbx,5 stars para sa biceps ni papa p

Mallari,4839,5,tfcine,,120.0,ltbx,"Oh god, how much I love this man"
Mallari,4839,6,tfcine,,120.0,ltbx,"Sayang lang, Hindi ka pa ready mag commit"
Mallari,4840,1,bigdsheika,,140.0,ltbx,may god guide him to mewe watched this because we didn't have much options so it's kinda forced but it's honestly better than we expected since we don't have much expectations in filipino films sorry LOL the story is nice the ghosts are just not scary but it was very entertaining i don't regret it
Mallari,4841,1,ealmario,,120.0,ltbx,They didn't have enough material from where they based it from so they made shit up and it didn't stick
Mallari,4841,2,ealmario,,120.0,ltbx,They're going to milk the f out of this if they make more
Mallari,4842,1,queenofkhearts,,140.0,ltbx,og light yagami

Mallari,4842,3,queenofkhearts,,140.0,ltbx,acting is best when they're doing those crazy eyes and are screaming
Mallari,4842,4,queenofkhearts,,140.0,ltbx,kinda messy writing at the end but I think it's doing what it set to do
Mallari,4842,5,queenofkhearts,,140.0,ltbx,"great cinematography, think haunting of hill house if it LOVED the color blue"
Mallari,4842,6,queenofkhearts,,140.0,ltbx,hot priests era is forever
Mallari,4842,7,queenofkhearts,,140.0,ltbx,I think the score is at its best with the choir (which is a filipino choir slayyy) but I wasn't really feeling the instrumentals
Mallari,4842,8,queenofkhearts,,140.0,ltbx,I was gagged by janella's last line and those glasses
Mallari,4842,9,queenofkhearts,,140.0,ltbx,also PRODUCTION DESIGN
Mallari,4843,1,anonym0use,,120.0,ltbx,Asan na yung sisiw
Mallari,4844,1,052201,,80.0,ltbx,This actually might have worked better as a psychological thriller
Mallari,4844,2,052201,,80.0,ltbx,Decent editing tho
Mallari,4845,1,leiizero,,120.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual was definitely mewing in that one scene
Mallari,4846,1,shookenfilms,,120.0,ltbx,plsss john rey's cock plssss
Mallari,4847,1,gagambaboy,,160.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual has proven why he is still at the top of his game
Mallari,4847,2,gagambaboy,,160.0,ltbx,He has departed from the romantic heartthrob roles and has taken on more challenging and diverse characters than we usually see him in
Mallari,4847,3,gagambaboy,,160.0,ltbx,"In ""Mallari,"" he portrays three related characters across different generations"
Mallari,4847,4,gagambaboy,,160.0,ltbx,"I enjoyed the diversity in each character and how they all have different fates, showcasing various kinds of love"
Mallari,4847,5,gagambaboy,,160.0,ltbx,"As Severino, the murderous priest with a malicious intent to kill the bad seed in his community and free his mother from a curse, Piolo is very convincing as a serial killer"
Mallari,4847,6,gagambaboy,,160.0,ltbx,"The transition scene in the church, where he was being convinced by the Patron Saint Bartholomew, was just a chef’s kiss"
Mallari,4847,7,gagambaboy,,160.0,ltbx,"As Johnrey, Piolo transitions into a man willing to do everything to rid himself of the curse"
Mallari,4847,8,gagambaboy,,160.0,ltbx,"And as Jonathan, who was willing to do everything to save a loved one, Piolo was so good that you might want to express frustration for all the stupidity and recklessness he portrayed"
Mallari,4847,9,gagambaboy,,160.0,ltbx,"The ending scene, where Piolo is facing the audience as if telling them that he will be hunting them for the night, is just brilliant"
Mallari,4847,10,gagambaboy,,160.0,ltbx,This is a one-of-a-kind Filipino horror movie
Mallari,4848,1,vipress_,,120.0,ltbx,Surprisingly good
Mallari,4848,2,vipress_,,120.0,ltbx,It keeps you on the edge during the first act but kinda fell down during the second
Mallari,4848,3,vipress_,,120.0,ltbx,Third act was predictable but that twist in the end is just so good
Mallari,4849,1,linusmxx,,140.0,ltbx,"Instead of opting for a straightforward depiction of the infamous case of Philippines’ first documented serial killer, Mallari chooses a wild, albeit frustratingly complex, yet enjoyably ambitious approach that may or may not impress you"
Mallari,4849,2,linusmxx,,140.0,ltbx,Read the full review on Sinegang
Mallari,4850,1,ellestluna,,120.0,ltbx,expected crime/thriller

Mallari,4857,1,newzer0kaneda,,40.0,ltbx,waste of time
Mallari,4857,2,newzer0kaneda,,40.0,ltbx,"a big filipino production jumping on the trend of glorifying and sensationalizing real-life serial killers, the only difference being it comes with a twist of the supernatural (in other words, the story is now completely fabricated)"
Mallari,4857,3,newzer0kaneda,,40.0,ltbx,all the hallmarks and tropes of filipino horror flicks over the years are rife in this movie
Mallari,4857,4,newzer0kaneda,,40.0,ltbx,nothing new other than cheap thrills
Mallari,4857,5,newzer0kaneda,,40.0,ltbx,dont get me started on how the first victim of this wannabe-supernatural-slasher is a caricature of filipino queer folk and sex workers
Mallari,4857,7,newzer0kaneda,,40.0,ltbx,stupid film
Mallari,4857,8,newzer0kaneda,,40.0,ltbx,stupid fucking film

Mallari,4857,11,newzer0kaneda,,40.0,ltbx,props to jc santos for doing his best with such a corny script while next to a usually-comatose piolo pascual
Mallari,4858,1,kimchipotatofry,,140.0,ltbx,"nice concept, almost there in execution"

Mallari,4897,2,briancly,,80.0,ltbx,"It did drag a bit long at times and there was some confusion with it constantly switching time periods, but I can’t say it was a bad time"

Mallari,4898,3,aaronlm,,100.0,ltbx,"The film tries to be complex, weaving multiple narratives and timelines together, delving into astral projects and whatnot"
Mallari,4898,4,aaronlm,,100.0,ltbx,"However, this complexity ends up muddying the story instead of enriching it"
Mallari,4898,5,aaronlm,,100.0,ltbx,"It feels like the writer bit off more than they could chew, lacking the clear vision needed to pull off a compelling horror or thriller"
Mallari,4898,6,aaronlm,,100.0,ltbx,"The tension and suspense, crucial ingredients for any horror film, are noticeably absent"
Mallari,4898,7,aaronlm,,100.0,ltbx,"The overall storytelling, from pacing to camerawork, shot selections and editing choices fail to build any real sense of unease, suspense or anticipation; falling short of the genre's demands"
Mallari,4898,8,aaronlm,,100.0,ltbx,"With a tighter focus, a clearer narrative structure, and a director with a stronger grasp of the genre, ""Mallari"" could have been a genuinely scary and unsettling experience"

Mallari,4899,1,sorrelspiral,,140.0,ltbx,"Came for a Janella Salvador film, came out with lots of surprises in this filmAlthough she didn't have a large part in this film, she's great as a supporting character with Piolo Pascual's striking performance as Johnathan who tries to bring closure to a family curse that spans generations"

Mallari,4918,9,evilngk,,20.0,ltbx,of course

Mallari,4918,12,evilngk,,20.0,ltbx,"disgusting, cheap, no finesse or subtlety, the kind of thing writers and directors with no creativity use to spook the audience cos they have no talent crafting an atmospheric horror with the background and environment of its characters"

Mallari,4936,1,mcrodriguez,,,ltbx,The dialogue is pandering
Mallari,4936,2,mcrodriguez,,,ltbx,I consider the portrayal of the trans character problematic because there is a greater focus on their perceived immorality compared to the other victims of Mallari
Mallari,4936,3,mcrodriguez,,,ltbx,The servants are the villains that the wealthy master needs to defeat
Mallari,4936,4,mcrodriguez,,,ltbx,"There is a love for the horror genre with homages to psycho, Rosemary's baby, the Innocents"
Mallari,4936,5,mcrodriguez,,,ltbx,A greater emphasis is on trauma similar to the works of Mike Flanagan
Mallari,4936,6,mcrodriguez,,,ltbx,I think the story is a combination between midnight mass and haunting of Hill house
Mallari,4936,7,mcrodriguez,,,ltbx,Piolo Pascual convincingly portrays three different roles
Mallari,4936,8,mcrodriguez,,,ltbx,Elisse Joson's mid Atlantic accent was a surprising detail that definitely sets her character in that time and place

Mallari,4955,3,mahuika,,160.0,ltbx,"The nice visual effects were really nice, and I was not expecting the quality to be THAT good"
Mallari,4955,4,mahuika,,160.0,ltbx,Byfar the BEST Filipino film I’ve seen
Mallari,4955,5,mahuika,,160.0,ltbx,It boasts a captivating plot intricately linked to Philippine history and urban legend
Mallari,4955,6,mahuika,,160.0,ltbx,The commendable acting skills of all characters significantly contribute to the film’s appeal
Mallari,4955,7,mahuika,,160.0,ltbx,"The pacing strikes a perfect balance—neither too fast nor too slow, preventing viewers from experiencing boredom, or confusion"
Mallari,4955,8,mahuika,,160.0,ltbx,"Regrettably, the downside lies in the inclusion of unnecessary jump scares, creating an abrupt disruption in the flow of the film"
Mallari,4955,9,mahuika,,160.0,ltbx,This drawback proves to be a significant dent in the overall quality of an otherwise promising story
Mallari,4955,10,mahuika,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite this setback, it’s important to note that “Mallari” still stands as a commendable horror film, especially when compared to the usual offerings in the Philippine horror genre"
Mallari,4955,11,mahuika,,160.0,ltbx,"Its compelling plot, historical ties, and the commendable performances of the cast elevate it above many counterparts, making it a worthwhile watch for enthusiasts of the genre"

Mallari,4958,2,kqersh,,60.0,ltbx,this film proved yet again that filipinos cannot produce good horror films
Mallari,4958,3,kqersh,,60.0,ltbx,"they will just put 20 jumpscares throughout the film, then be satisfied with the results"
Mallari,4958,4,kqersh,,60.0,ltbx,"the potential is there na e, the cinematography and the acting are top notch, but the writing completely ruined it"
Mallari,4959,1,heyjsunga,,200.0,ltbx,"Watched 3 films in last year’s MMF, and this was the last of the 3 (Rewind and Gomburza as the first 2), and quite frankly Mallari was the best"

Mallari,4961,2,sienfuwi,,160.0,ltbx,its not just because i'm an avid horror fan
Mallari,4961,3,sienfuwi,,160.0,ltbx,the plot was confusing at first as it felt like a multiverse of the mallari's
Mallari,4961,4,sienfuwi,,160.0,ltbx,"the vfx were bad, we couldn't help but laugh when that ""creature"" came up"
Mallari,4961,5,sienfuwi,,160.0,ltbx,"but god, piolo really carried the whole movie"

Mallari,4970,2,karlagundaya,,160.0,ltbx,"Of course there were jump scares and frightening parts, but towards the end you'd end up with a chuckle"
Mallari,4970,3,karlagundaya,,160.0,ltbx,"Nonetheless, it was beautifully executed"

Mallari,4975,2,pewpoll,,120.0,ltbx,the plot kinda lost it for me (wasn't a fan of how it ended)
Mallari,4976,1,samhaines_,,60.0,ltbx,Good plot; it has so much potential

Mallari,4977,1,noomori,,140.0,ltbx,ไอเดียหนังเจ๋งดีนะ คาราวะคนคิด คนผูกเรื่อง สร้างเรื่องเลยแบบ…เค้าสามารถเอาตำนานฆาตรกรต่อเนื่องสมัยก่อน มาผูกกับศาสตร์มืด แถมตำนานปีศาจ ดูจบแล้ว เชื่อตามอ่ะว่ามันคือเรื่องจริงตัวเอกเล่นดีอ่ะ เล่นเป็นคน 3 คนแบบต่างกันจนตอนแรกๆคือเข้าใจว่าคนล่ะคนจริงๆเสียดายผู้กำกับเล่าเรื่องไม่เก่ง ช่วงแรกๆ อิหยังว่ะและงงหนักมาก อารมณ์ตัวละครต่างๆคือไม่ได้อินตามเลย
Mallari,4978,1,violettabel,,100.0,ltbx,จริง ๆ การหยิบตำนานสยองพื้นบ้านมาผนวกกับคดีฆาตกรต่อเนื่องตัวจริง ถือเป็นเส้นเรื่องพื้นฐานที่แข็งแรง ซีนสยองก็ถึงเครื่อง แต่หนังพยายามจะเล่นท่ายากมากไปจนคุมไม่อยู่ มีส่วนเกินของเส้นเรื่องที่ทำให้ปมไม่ราบรื่นและเต็มไปด้วยฉากที่สามารถตัดออกได้เต็มไปหมด เสียดายไอเดีย
Mallari,4979,1,samkmfb,,40.0,ltbx,ไม่สนุกเลย ในหัวมีแต่คำถามเต็มไปหมด

Mallari,4983,3,ulysisq,,160.0,ltbx,In horror context of course) and incorporating it into local ones
Mallari,4983,4,ulysisq,,160.0,ltbx,"While the production was impressive, the ‘Manananggal’ scene just dragged it down by an inch"
Mallari,4983,5,ulysisq,,160.0,ltbx,"The sequence felt out of place but hey, we don’t get much…"
Mallari,4984,1,poom5551,,100.0,ltbx,หนังมีความทะเยอทะยาน แต่กลับไปไม่ถึงฝัน เพราะประเด็นที่จะเล่าดันซับซ้อนเกินไป ด้วยการเป็น 3 ไทม์ไลน์ การตัดต่อไม่ชัดเจน เล่าเรื่องก็ไม่ค่อยต่อเนื่องนักและหนังก็มีประเด็นที่เกิดขึ้นจริงน้อย (ส่วนของฆาตกรต่อเนื่องคนอีกของฟิลิปปินส์) แล้วดันเสริมเติมแต่งเยอะ จนรู้สึกว่าไม่ต้องขายมากก็ได้ว่าสร้างจากเรื่องจริงส่วนที่ชอบที่สุดคือนักแสดงที่เต็มที่กับบทเท่าที่จะส่งมาให้ โดยเฉพาะ พิโอโล ที่รับบท 3 ตัวละครได้แตกต่างจนเชื่อสนิทใจ

Mallari,5015,5,saintssss,,160.0,ltbx,The scoring gave justice to how the film should feel like
Mallari,5016,1,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,"I went into ""Mallari"" with a mixture of excitement and skepticism because of how well-received it was by Filipino viewers on social media"
Mallari,5016,2,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,"Regretfully, the film's execution left me feeling disappointed, and my expectations were not fulfilled"
Mallari,5016,3,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,"To bring the story to its best, the screenplay in particular needs to be significantly revised"
Mallari,5016,4,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,"On the one hand, the film's artistic vision is praiseworthy"
Mallari,5016,5,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,It is creative and promising that the authors chose to examine several incarnations of the Mallari family in diverse eras
Mallari,5016,6,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,But the execution is inadequate
Mallari,5016,7,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,It's challenging to fully immerse yourself in the characters and their struggles because of the story's rambling dialogue and pacing
Mallari,5016,8,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,"Despite being a crucial part of the movie, the big reveal feels hurried and doesn't have the emotional impact it needs"
Mallari,5016,9,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,"The final choice made by the protagonist, which is supposed to be a pivotal moment in the narrative, is disappointing and has no lasting effect"
Mallari,5016,10,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,"Additionally, there is no tension or surprise because the criminal killer's identity is revealed right away"
Mallari,5016,11,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,"Furthermore, the movie's depiction of Mallari's deeds and killings is a little sanitized, which lessens the story's overall impact"
Mallari,5016,12,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,"The final product does not justify the audience's reaction to the story, nor does it fully realize its complexity"
Mallari,5016,13,dmfetalvero,,80.0,ltbx,It was a failure all around

Mallari,5090,7,poet1c_,,60.0,ltbx,Where was his story

Mallari,5090,11,poet1c_,,60.0,ltbx,Ano kayang sasabihin ni Mallari kung bumangon siya sa hukay niya ngayon
Mallari,5090,12,poet1c_,,60.0,ltbx,His story is rich with moral dilemmas and gray areas and very significant and relevant topics such as psychological disorders that could have been interpreted and revealed to us in a way na may twist pa rin siguro
Mallari,5090,13,poet1c_,,60.0,ltbx,without adding those unnecessary fictional elements
Mallari,5090,14,poet1c_,,60.0,ltbx,This could have been the chance to talk more about the Church and our individual beliefs and how it clashes with each other but they didn't

Mallari,5090,28,poet1c_,,60.0,ltbx,I needed some hope na mayroon pa ring mga sining na pinaghihirapan at hindi pineperahan
Mallari,5090,29,poet1c_,,60.0,ltbx,"And, Mallari maybe gave me that hope, gaano man kaliit"

Mallari,5090,31,poet1c_,,60.0,ltbx,"They were just so limited, perhaps, by factors such as censorship, pressure from corporations from investors"
Mallari,5090,32,poet1c_,,60.0,ltbx,"O, kaya, iniisip na lang lagi ng mga filmmakers natin na ang mga manonood ay yung mga casual moviegoers lang, ganon ganon"
Mallari,5090,33,poet1c_,,60.0,ltbx,Ayaw kong maging masyadong harsh sa kanila dahil siguro nahihirapan din sila

Mallari,5100,9,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,“The movie is inspired by true events
Mallari,5100,10,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"The story is set in three generations and follows the Mallari family: Juan Severino, John Rey, and Jonathan (all of whom are portrayed by Piolo Pascual)"
Mallari,5100,11,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Juan Severino was a Catholic priest and serial killer during the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines in the 19th century
Mallari,5100,12,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,John Rey is a photo journalist and also the grandnephew of Juan Severino during post-World War II
Mallari,5100,13,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Johnathan is his great-grandnephew and also a doctor in the modern world
Mallari,5100,14,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Their stories interlink with one another
Mallari,5100,15,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,”I was honestly looking forward to this film
Mallari,5100,16,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Ever since I’ve read about its premise, it immediately caught my attention"
Mallari,5100,17,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,The trailer was solid
Mallari,5100,18,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,It has a pretty interesting premise
Mallari,5100,19,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,The history that aspects of its story have taken inspiration from catches my attention
Mallari,5100,20,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"If executed properly, this would be a really solid movie"
Mallari,5100,21,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"I was eagerly waiting for its release on Netflix, and after finally watching it, I have to say that I was rather disappointed with it"
Mallari,5100,22,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"I really wanted to like this film, but there are a lot of things here that are pretty dull"
Mallari,5100,23,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Mallari (2023) is a mixed bag
Mallari,5100,24,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"It’s decently directed, and it also has a solid cast"
Mallari,5100,25,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Visually, it looks great, and the music was excellent"
Mallari,5100,26,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"There is some creepy atmosphere here, and again, the premise was interesting"
Mallari,5100,27,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, the film leaves a lot to be desired, especially with its script"
Mallari,5100,28,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"It has a very messy, bland, and uninteresting story"
Mallari,5100,29,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"The characters are wooden, and a lot of the dialogue was cringeworthy"
Mallari,5100,30,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"The pacing is inconsistent, and the scares are very cheap"
Mallari,5100,31,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,This film was mediocre
Mallari,5100,32,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Here are my thoughts on the movie:Positives:- It’s a decently directed film
Mallari,5100,33,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Roderick Cabrido did a fairly serviceable job with the film’s overall direction
Mallari,5100,34,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,There are definitely some moments here where I can see what they’re going for
Mallari,5100,35,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"As for the cast, I thought they were pretty solid"
Mallari,5100,36,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,A lot of the performances here are good
Mallari,5100,37,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Their chemistry with each other was also fairly decent here
Mallari,5100,38,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual’s performance certainly shines throughout the entire duration of the film
Mallari,5100,39,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,He’s performance was good
Mallari,5100,40,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"- Visually, the film actually looks pretty good"
Mallari,5100,41,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"There are plenty of shots here that looks excellent, especially the final shot"
Mallari,5100,42,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Some of the camera work that they’ve done here is also pretty good
Mallari,5100,43,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Aside from its overall cinematography, the film also has a solid atmosphere"
Mallari,5100,44,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,There were some moments where I find this aspect to be incredibly effective
Mallari,5100,45,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,The music composed by Von de Guzman is excellent
Mallari,5100,46,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"It fits the tone of the film, and at times, it was effective"
Mallari,5100,47,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"- As for its premise, this aspect was the reason I wanted to watch it"
Mallari,5100,48,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"The film has a very intriguing premise, and there are moments where I can see the potential"
Mallari,5100,49,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, the execution could’ve been better (more on that later on)"
Mallari,5100,50,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Aside from that, there are a couple of decent moments here and there"
Mallari,5100,51,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"There are a couple of creepy moments, especially with the atmosphere"
Mallari,5100,52,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Its production is a mixed bag
Mallari,5100,53,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"At times, this aspect here was fairly decent"
Mallari,5100,54,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Negatives:- As for my issues, despite a pretty interesting premise, the execution certainly leaves a lot to be desired, especially with the script, which was rather lackluster"
Mallari,5100,55,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"There are some moments here where I can see the potential that it has, but it often devolves into a generic and messy story"
Mallari,5100,56,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,The structure here was all over the place
Mallari,5100,57,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,It doesn’t really help that it was also underdeveloped
Mallari,5100,58,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,It’s really disappointing how underbaked the premise of this movie is
Mallari,5100,59,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"- Not only is the story very lackluster, but the same thing can also be said about the characters themselves"
Mallari,5100,60,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Sure, the performances from the cast members may be solid, the characters that they are portraying, on the other hand, just fall flat to me"
Mallari,5100,61,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,I didn’t really care about or find any of them to be all that interesting
Mallari,5100,62,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,The dialogue is also pretty terrible at times
Mallari,5100,63,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"It tries to be modern with its dialogue here, but it usually ends up being really cringeworthy"
Mallari,5100,64,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"- Aside from that, the editing here is also pretty choppy"
Mallari,5100,65,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Not only from the overall structure of its narrative but also within its jump scares
Mallari,5100,66,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Speaking of its jump scares, they aren’t good"
Mallari,5100,67,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Sure, the film can be creepy at times, but it’s not all that scary"
Mallari,5100,68,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,The jump scares that it does here often end up being predictable and clichéd
Mallari,5100,69,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,It did this weird edit that was really sloppy
Mallari,5100,70,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,It doesn’t help that the movie also bombards you with unnecessary sound effects
Mallari,5100,71,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"- As for its visual effects, they aren’t good either; they’re actually quite awful"
Mallari,5100,72,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Some of the special effects that it does in here look pretty cheap and noticeable
Mallari,5100,73,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,It could’ve been a lot better
Mallari,5100,74,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Pacing-wise, this aspect is very inconsistent"
Mallari,5100,75,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"There are a couple of moments where the movie is a bit of a drag to get through, and other times, it feels incredibly rushed"
Mallari,5100,76,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,It just felt messy
Mallari,5100,77,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Some scenes here are also pretty lackluster, which affects the pacing even more"
Mallari,5100,78,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Final Thoughts:Overall, Mallari (2023) is such a mixed bag for me"
Mallari,5100,79,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"There are aspects here that I really liked, and some that don’t really work whatsoever"
Mallari,5100,80,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,It’s a decently directed film by Roderick Cabrido
Mallari,5100,81,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"The premise itself is pretty interesting, and there are a couple of moments here where you can definitely see the potential"
Mallari,5100,82,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"As for the cast themselves, they’re pretty good"
Mallari,5100,83,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,A lot of the performances are great
Mallari,5100,84,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,There’s also some fairly decent chemistry between the cast members in here
Mallari,5100,85,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual shines throughout the movie’s entire runtime
Mallari,5100,86,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Visually, I think the film actually looks pretty good"
Mallari,5100,87,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,There are a couple of terrific shots here and there
Mallari,5100,88,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,The cinematography also does a good job of giving the film a bit of a creepy atmosphere
Mallari,5100,89,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Aside from that, the music that was composed by Von de Guzman is excellent"
Mallari,5100,90,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,This also helps with the film’s atmosphere
Mallari,5100,91,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"The overall production here can be a little bit of a mixed bag, but there are some moments where it was quite decent, in my opinion"
Mallari,5100,92,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Aside from that, there are also a couple of pretty decent moments here and there"
Mallari,5100,93,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, despite an intriguing premise, the execution was just all over the place"
Mallari,5100,94,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"The script is pretty lackluster in a lot of aspects, often making its story feel messy and underdeveloped"
Mallari,5100,95,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"This was such a shame because there are some moments here where I can see what they’re going for, but the story just felt really generic at times"
Mallari,5100,96,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Aside from its story, the characters here are also rather bland, making me not really care much for any of them"
Mallari,5100,97,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,Some of the lines of dialogue here are also pretty awful
Mallari,5100,98,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,They can be cringeworthy
Mallari,5100,99,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Aside from that, its editing can be very choppy in some scenes, especially when it comes to its jump scares"
Mallari,5100,100,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"Speaking of its jump scares, there’s way too much here, and none of them works"
Mallari,5100,101,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"They’re just predictable, and there is also an overabundance of sound effects"
Mallari,5100,102,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"The visual effects are atrocious, and the pacing here is very inconsistent"
Mallari,5100,103,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,There are instances where the film is a bit of a drag to get through
Mallari,5100,104,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,I really wanted to like this film; I really do
Mallari,5100,105,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,"But despite some pretty solid ideas, as a whole, this just leaves a lot to be desired"
Mallari,5100,107,bogs02,,100.0,ltbx,5/10What are your thoughts

Mallari,5107,1,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,You REALLY Need your brain to focus in
Mallari,5107,2,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,this movie otherwise you'll miss the important details
Mallari,5107,3,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,"Despite having a messy flow of events, if you have enough comprehension of it all, it's a good film until towards THE ENDING"
Mallari,5107,4,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,The ending could have been better
Mallari,5107,5,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,"The clues and evidences were already there, he was JUST SO BAD at investigating and connecting shit and he was so impulsive in his decisions and there is no scene he is CALM AND THINKING RATIONALLY"
Mallari,5107,6,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,And his fiancee was even the first one to solve the mystery of the present killings
Mallari,5107,7,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,"If he could have known who the killer was earlier, he could have saved his fiancee"
Mallari,5107,8,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,The ending really disappointed me I wanted it to be a happy ending where the curse is no longer existent yet he (main protagonist) didn't learn anything at all despite everytthing he saw in time travelling and watching the tapes of his ancestor
Mallari,5107,9,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,I bet his ancestors had the biggest facepalm in their graves when he decided his decision
Mallari,5107,10,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,"To be fair, the cinematography, props, setting, are really good"
Mallari,5107,11,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,BUT THE FLOW OF EVENTS JUST AAAAAATHIS MOVIE GOT ME STRESSSSSINGGp
Mallari,5107,13,dolores_manapat,,120.0,ltbx,yes piolo in this film is so hot no wonder he was my first childhood crush
Mallari,5108,1,nullkiosk,,100.0,ltbx,natatawa ako sa mga jumpscares huhu
Mallari,5109,1,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,There were a lot of good elements but ultimately this movie fell flat for me
Mallari,5109,2,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,It just felt like the movie was trying to do too much and alot of it just ended up half-baked and under developed
Mallari,5109,3,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,"It's supernatural horror, a slasher, a time travel movie, a murder mystery, a social commentary, a psychological thriller, it just feels disjointed and I'm left feeling disapointed because there were alot of good ideas that felt just felt jammed in there"
Mallari,5109,4,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,I really didn't care much for the time travel plot which is unfortunate because it makes-up like 85% of the plot
Mallari,5109,5,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,I would have much loved to see how they would have approached the film if they went full on psychological horror cause the third act with JC Santos and Piolo Pascual duking it out was so great
Mallari,5109,6,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,Dialogue and Acting was so on point and the scene just felt so fleshed out compared to the rest of the screenplay
Mallari,5109,7,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,I would have loved to see an angle where the mallari curse wasn't real so Jonathan just feels like he's going insane for the whole film and maybe he thinks that he's the killer and the whole 3rd act scene with JC Santos just plays out
Mallari,5109,8,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,But yeah we got this instead
Mallari,5109,9,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,I will say though I did like the final scene at the hospital It was probably the only supernatural scene in the whole movie where I actually felt unnerved but then they followed it up with the next scene which not only ruined the momentum but it was just completely uneccessary
Mallari,5109,10,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,We know that what jonathan did was wrong and we know the implications of his actions because we literally see it as clear as day in the scenes prior so why add another scene of the characters just talking about what we already know
Mallari,5109,11,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,Don't take your audience for granted we can understand what you're trying to say without you having to spell it out for us
Mallari,5109,12,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,Another issue I had with the film was the fact that it just wasn't scary
Mallari,5109,13,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,"The ""horror"" in this movie just comes from an abundance of jumpscares and loud accompanying music stings"
Mallari,5109,14,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,Of course if you're gonna throw something at my face I'm bound to react
Mallari,5109,15,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,All in all I really feel like this movie was a missed opportunity
Mallari,5109,16,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,"The acting is great, production and sets were great"
Mallari,5109,17,strawberry_tea,,80.0,ltbx,Maybe it was just too ambitious or maybe it wasn't ambitious enough
Mallari,5110,1,jyvynce,,120.0,ltbx,nice premise

Mallari,5111,1,veeeenx,,100.0,ltbx,mallari multiverse— expected so much from the film and really expect the unexpected
Mallari,5111,2,veeeenx,,100.0,ltbx,The first hour of the movie will make you curious about the story but i expected the plot twist to be as great as the first hour but nope

Mallari,5113,1,kkongnyangz,,120.0,ltbx,"Whoever was in charge of the story/screenplay for this film was heavily inspired by existing horror movies such as the entire Insidious franchise (the traveling through dreams concept among the Mallaris was too reminiscent of the franchise), Inception, and the like"
Mallari,5113,2,kkongnyangz,,120.0,ltbx,"The Avengers Infinity War-esque CGI makes the scenes a bit funnier than scary, too"
Mallari,5113,3,kkongnyangz,,120.0,ltbx,I see why people would view this film as a piece that's undergoing an identity crisis (because I agree)
Mallari,5113,4,kkongnyangz,,120.0,ltbx,But at the end of the…

Mallari,5234,1,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"a fresh concept, and i couldn't be more glad that it was piolo pascual who starred in it"
Mallari,5234,2,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"however, we shouldn't forget jc santos's spectacular supporting performance during the unravelling of the story"
Mallari,5234,3,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"i'm not sure whether to review the films based on the technicalities of the plot or the in-depth interweaving of the characters' relationships, but safe to say, both are well written"
Mallari,5234,4,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"let me first start with the technicalities, which can be simply ruled out by semantics: baby jonathan calling johnrey ""tito-lolo"""
Mallari,5234,5,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"jonathan isn't johnrey's son with felicity, given that he is his ""tito-lolo/lolo-tito"""
Mallari,5234,6,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"and so, johnrey must have a sibling, from which jonathan came from"
Mallari,5234,7,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"or if we lean to the ""lolo"" part, jonathan's direct relationship with johnrey is by johnrey's child with felicity"
Mallari,5234,8,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"but then again, the same question arises with severino"
Mallari,5234,9,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"being a priest, he isn't supposed to have descendants, which opens the possibility that the mallaris played by piolo pascual have siblings that aren't in the story, but had the chance to continue the blood line"
Mallari,5234,10,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"given the time gap between 1812 to 1948 and 1948 to 2023, i assume that the ability to ""travel"" skips every one or two years in the mallari blood line"
Mallari,5234,11,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"and if we were to get a spin-off film about those undisclosed generations but with their own peculiarities, why not"
Mallari,5234,12,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,i enjoyed this film enough that i'd want a second one
Mallari,5234,13,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"as for the review about the characters' relationships, which i'd admit is a more informal review, i'll do in another entry"

Mallari,5241,2,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"father severino mallari, despite being the marketed center of the story as the first serial killer priest in the philippines, turned out to be a tortured character, who was flawed enough to make mistakes and have turbulent emotions about the people he loved"
Mallari,5241,3,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"they gave father severino, a supposed serial killer, a heart, and a facet that made him undeniably human"
Mallari,5241,4,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"personally, i like when supposed villains/evil characters show that human quality to themselves"

Mallari,5241,6,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"sure, poke fun at him and call him a ""mama's boy"", but it's not like he had a choice in the matter"
Mallari,5241,7,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,especially not when the choices were your own mother or your principles
Mallari,5241,8,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,and how many times have our mothers derailed our principles completely
Mallari,5241,9,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,severino's love was devout
Mallari,5241,10,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"moving onto the second mallari, johnrey: i couldn't say much about him that isn't about his intelligence, martyrdom, and commitment to the future generation"
Mallari,5241,11,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,johnrey ended the curse by not choosing the same path severino did
Mallari,5241,12,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"johnrey was selfless, and his love didn't manifest in a way that would put others in harm's way"
Mallari,5241,13,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,johnrey's love was kind
Mallari,5241,14,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"and to the third mallari, jonathan"
Mallari,5241,15,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"amongst the rest, jonathan chose all the wrong choices"
Mallari,5241,16,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,even agnes herself said it would've been better had jonathan let him die
Mallari,5241,17,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"jonathan all throughout the film was misleading, taking on the role of an unreliable narrator, or at least, an ambiguous one"
Mallari,5241,18,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"if anything, jonathan's love is unrelenting"
Mallari,5241,19,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"and to the special mention, lucas"
Mallari,5241,20,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"lucas, oh, he could've been everything"
Mallari,5241,21,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"had this been an alarcon-centric film, it would still be as interesting"
Mallari,5241,22,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"lucas's motivations which eventually flowed into desperation almost sounded as if he wasn't only faithfully attached to jonathan mallari, but also a servant who loved his faulty master through and through"
Mallari,5241,23,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"lucas calling jonathan ""amo"" was something else"
Mallari,5241,24,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,"i'm not sure whether i'm viewing everything through the colored lenses of queerness, but lucas's devotion to jonathan had undertones of romanticism and obsession that could only be explained if he were in love with him"
Mallari,5241,25,ave8888,,200.0,ltbx,and such display would make for good alternate universe writings about this story

Mallari,5264,2,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"Kidding aside, Mallari had lots of potential as a culturally-nuanced Filipino horror film, but fell short on certain aspects"

Mallari,5264,4,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"Severino Mallari — reported to be the Philippines' first serial killer — into a film that incorporates elements of folk horror, historical fiction, science fiction, and thriller was promising"
Mallari,5264,5,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"It succeeded in drawing upon elements of folk religion and true crime to invite viewers into the life and motives of a creepy and murderous priest, and Piolo Pascual — timeless of an actor he is — nailed the triple roles of Fr"
Mallari,5264,6,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"Mallari, Johnrey, and Jonathan quite excellently"
Mallari,5264,7,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"The storytelling and production design were quite able to establish the settings in each of the Mallari eras, but the horror elements of the film were left to be desired"
Mallari,5264,8,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,The jump scares felt gimmicky and did not serve any real purpose to the storyline other than to imply that Johnrey and Jonathan had psychic abilities
Mallari,5264,9,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"The suspense was present, though I wish Mallari had touched upon the concepts of folk religion and witchcraft a little further to better understand the sociocultural contexts in which the settings of the film revolved in"
Mallari,5264,10,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"The motives behind Maria Capac's practice of witchcraft wasn't made clear, apart from maybe the implication that peasant folk like them just wanted to exact revenge on the elite"
Mallari,5264,11,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"It would've been nice if the subversiveness of the practice of occultism had been given better emphasis within the contexts of colonial and post-war Philippines, but maybe that's just the sociological analysis-hungry viewer in me wanting more lol"
Mallari,5264,12,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"There were also moments when I felt as if the depiction of occultism in the film was a little clichéd (""impoverished househelp uses dark magic against the rich people they serve"" felt a little telenovela-esque), but maybe that was intentional to reflect its generally taboo reputation"
Mallari,5264,13,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"I did notice, however, similarities in the portrayal of the practice with what was shown in Lorcan Finnegan's Nocebo (2023), where Chai Fonacier played a vengeful mangkukulam disguised as a timid homeopathy-practicing OFW"
Mallari,5264,14,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"But all in all, Mallari is a refreshing take on horror, especially for a MMFF release"
Mallari,5264,15,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"It's dark, eerie, and adds to the foray of contemporary Filipino media that draws inspiration from real historical events and figures"
Mallari,5264,16,escapistmedia,,140.0,ltbx,"I'm no horror enthusiast, but I do appreciate it when a Filipino film weaves our history and culture into its storytelling"

Mallari,5267,9,jamenn,,80.0,ltbx,Magandang ideya ngunit pakiramdam ko may mali dahil sa pagkawala ng originality ng palabas na ito

Mallari,5267,14,jamenn,,80.0,ltbx,Tambay ba sa Twitter ang writer nito
Mallari,5267,15,jamenn,,80.0,ltbx,medyo hindi lang ako sang-ayon sa mga piniling salita at nagsasalita kasi pakiramdam ko ay pinipilit lamang ito para makisabay sa panahon ngayon
Mallari,5267,16,jamenn,,80.0,ltbx,"Wala ring saysay at hindi ako tinamaan sa mga huling kataga ng mga karakter, ang cringe bwisit"
Mallari,5267,17,jamenn,,80.0,ltbx,Magw-work pa rin naman ang palabas na ito kahit na walang mga multo
Mallari,5267,18,jamenn,,80.0,ltbx,Magandang ideya sana ngunit naging isa sa mga sablay nito ang pagdagdag pa ng multo ng mga pinatay
Mallari,5267,19,jamenn,,80.0,ltbx,Minsan epektibo ang jumpscares sa palabas na ito pero bakit ginagasgas nito dahil sa paulit-ulit at prediktableng pananakot

Mallari,5267,23,jamenn,,80.0,ltbx,"Para naman kay JC Santos, lupit ka rin talaga, puwede na maging Joker ng Pinas"
Mallari,5267,24,jamenn,,80.0,ltbx,"Si Janella, okay lang, parang akala niya nasa Darna TV show pa rin siya"

Mallari,5267,27,jamenn,,80.0,ltbx,Sablay lang talaga siguro ang production sa VFX dahil napa-WHAT nalang ako sa isang scene (nakakasura after mo mapanood dahil mapapaisip ka kung 2 to 3 stars nalang ba ang mair-rate mo rito sa Letterboxd)

Mallari,5276,6,kxx89,,120.0,ltbx,"My favorite scenes were the interactions of Mallari men, and I loved the concept of being able to return to a specific time by carrying a Mallari keepsake with them when they sleep"
Mallari,5276,7,kxx89,,120.0,ltbx,"What else… oh, medyo tumatak yung acting ni Elisse dito — the way she delivered her coconut line was smooth, believable yung implied background ng character niya"
Mallari,5276,8,kxx89,,120.0,ltbx,"The jumpscares were pretty weak, the writing was a little all over the place, but most of the actors were good in the roles given to them"
Mallari,5276,9,kxx89,,120.0,ltbx,"I feel like it could’ve been a shorter film, though"
Mallari,5276,10,kxx89,,120.0,ltbx,I wish they chose fewer folk / supernatural tales to incorporate in the story
Mallari,5276,11,kxx89,,120.0,ltbx,"That would’ve made the movie’s plot tighter and maybe, a bit more compelling"

Mallari,5303,3,zoey_de_leon,,100.0,ltbx,It was justified for the story but it could have been done differently in a more thriller than a fantastical way

Mallari,5303,5,zoey_de_leon,,100.0,ltbx,Add in the ghosts of the victims played for cheap jumpscares
Mallari,5303,6,zoey_de_leon,,100.0,ltbx,could have reduced those into some few scenes than be played repeatedly
Mallari,5303,7,zoey_de_leon,,100.0,ltbx,Talking about the ending
Mallari,5303,8,zoey_de_leon,,100.0,ltbx,"It switches its theme of the whole movie where it is supposed to be a serious horror melodrama but it ends into taken out of a Shake, Rattle & Roll ending where jt is all like campy and hits with a punchline"
Mallari,5303,9,zoey_de_leon,,100.0,ltbx,It was kind of funny but it does feel out of place
Mallari,5303,10,zoey_de_leon,,100.0,ltbx,But this is still a fun story with a bunch of cool ideas crammed in to satisfy me

Mallari,5307,1,xytationss,,80.0,ltbx,"worse, the film perpetuates harmful stereotypes about sex workers and transgender individuals, presenting them in a negative and transphobic light"
Mallari,5307,2,xytationss,,80.0,ltbx,"cpmbined with uninspired direction, dragging pacing, and mediocre cinematography and effects, the film not only misses the mark as a horror film but also reinforces damaging societal stigmas, making it a troubling and unengaging watch"
Mallari,5307,3,xytationss,,80.0,ltbx,"ang pelikulang ito ay nagpapakita ng kahalagahan ng maingat na paggamit ng kasaysayan sa pelikula, dahil sa hindi maayos na pagkakaugnay-ugnay ng mga pangyayari, nagdulot ito ng kakulangan ng konteksto at lalim"

Mallari,5325,2,moviexrants,,120.0,ltbx,this was mediocre at best)
Mallari,5326,1,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Sa direksiyon ni Derick Cabrido at panulat ni Enrico Santos, isa itong pelikulang horror na tungkol sa isang doktor na si Jonathan Mallari De Dios (Piolo Pascual) na bumalik sa bahay ng kanilang angkan upang hanapin ang maaaring lunas sa sakit ng kaniyang fiancee na si Agnes (Janella Salvador)"
Mallari,5326,2,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Habang hinahanap niya ito, matutuklasan niya ang sikreto ng kanilang angkan partikular sa buhay nina John Rey Mallari na isang dokumentarista at Fr"
Mallari,5326,3,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,Severino Mallari na isang pari at pinaniniwalaang unang serial killer sa bansa
Mallari,5326,4,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,Mapupuri ko ang pelikula sa effort nito na tahakin ang ibang direksiyon sa halip na magtuon lamang sa sub genre ng horror na slasher o patayan
Mallari,5326,5,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Sa kasamaang palad, sa sobrang gustong pagsanibin ang halos lahat ng mga elemento rito ng horror, naging magulo na ito"
Mallari,5326,6,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Kahit iyong paggamit ng konsepto ng time travel at astral projection ay magulo para sa akin sapagkat sa pagkakaalam ko, magkaiba ang dalawang ito"
Mallari,5326,7,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Mas nakagulo pa sa pelikula ang pag-eedit nito ng di-linyar na pagsasalaysay dahil sa ilang paulit-ulit na eksena na tingin ko, puwede pang gawing pulido sa isahang pagpapakita lamang"
Mallari,5326,8,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,Hindi rin gaanong nabigyan ng linaw ang motibo ng pamilya Alarcon sa pamilya Mallari
Mallari,5326,9,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,Kapuri-puri din ang disenyong pamproduksiyon nito ngunit napag-iwanan naman ang visual effects nito gayong medyo bumubuti naman ito
Mallari,5326,10,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,Napag-iwanan kasi isa sa mga prodyuser nito ay Warner Bros
Mallari,5326,11,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,Philippines tapos ganoon lang ang inabot ng VFX
Mallari,5326,12,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,Ewan ko ba
Mallari,5326,14,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Bilang karagdagan, ayos din naman ang sinematograpiya at musika at tunog nito ngunit dahil naging paulit-ulit ang paglapat ng musika sa pare-parehong jump scares, ang unang karanasan na nakakagulat ay naging nakaiirita habang tumatagal"
Mallari,5326,15,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Sa tuwing may paparating na halatang jump scare, napapairap na lang ako at minsan, napapabuntunghininga"
Mallari,5326,16,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Sa pagganap naman ni Piolo Pascual, hindi ko nakitaan ng pagkakaiba-iba ang tatlong Mallari"
Mallari,5326,17,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,Parang pare-parehong Jonathan lamang ang nakikita ko na nag-iba-iba lamang ng bihis
Mallari,5326,18,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Marahil, nakaapekto rito ang kulang na karakterisasyon nina John Rey na nalimitahan lamang sa pagiging dokumentarista at Jonathan na nalimitihan lamang sa papel nito sa buhay ni Agnes"
Mallari,5326,19,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Kung mayroon man akong papupurihan kay Pascual, iyon ay ang eksena matapos ang una niyang pagpatay na lumabas ang kaniyang kakayahan bilang aktor sa drama"
Mallari,5326,20,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Bukod pa rito, iyong alter ego ni Fr"
Mallari,5326,21,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Severino Mallari na nakabihis bilang San Bartolome, mahusay"
Mallari,5326,22,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,Medyo nasapawan nga rin siya ni JC Santos sa totoo lang kaya nakuha ko na iyong pagkapanalo niya ng Best Supporting Actor sa nakaraang Gabi ng Parangal ng MMFF 2023 dahil malinaw na naipakita ni Santos ang pagbabago sa katauhan ni Brother Lucas
Mallari,5326,23,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Napaisip tuloy ako, paano kaya kung si Santos ang leading role"
Mallari,5326,24,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Sa tingin ko, naging disadvantage ng pelikula ang pag-promote nito bilang kakaibang horror kaya nadismaya nga ako"
Mallari,5326,25,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Sa ganda ng trailer nito, naging mataas ang inaasahan dito"
Mallari,5326,26,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Sa panonood ko nito, nakita ko iyong effort sa direksiyon at bisyon ng pelikula pero habang tumatagal, nagiging trying hard na ito"
Mallari,5326,27,azuregq,,80.0,ltbx,"Kaya, masasabi ko na mas maayos pa ang pagkakabuo ng Kampon (2023) dito"

Mallari,5392,6,evervaled,,60.0,ltbx,but there was something about his performance(s) that didn’t sit right with me
Mallari,5392,7,evervaled,,60.0,ltbx,i have the screenplay to blame for that
Mallari,5392,8,evervaled,,60.0,ltbx,"a movie about true crime, time travel, horror, and philippine folklore"

Mallari,5392,17,evervaled,,60.0,ltbx,it could’ve been a stepping stone for filipino movies to move away from the same boring and redundant plots

Mallari,5553,3,sinephile17,,100.0,ltbx,I expected to get chills and creepiness because afterall the hype of the movie was centered around the serial killer but it didn't hit the way i wanted it to

Mallari,5585,9,renuelfallore,,100.0,ltbx,I guess those were just like fillers so you can feel its “horror” vibe tho I never looked at Mallari as a horror flick anyway lol
Mallari,5585,10,renuelfallore,,100.0,ltbx,"As the revelations unfolded and as it reaches the end, it morphed into something borderline absurd"
Mallari,5585,11,renuelfallore,,100.0,ltbx,But I appreciate the effort of this film in attempting to bring something fresh to PH cinema

Mallari,5649,20,mae_quinn,,120.0,ltbx,)One of the points sa review na 'yun is the cgi
Mallari,5649,21,mae_quinn,,120.0,ltbx,It was not the best but it tried
Mallari,5649,22,mae_quinn,,120.0,ltbx,"We put the Filipino Film industry in such high standards that we're not allowing our OWN movies to make mistakes, learn better, and grow from it"
Mallari,5649,23,mae_quinn,,120.0,ltbx,"The thing that I find weird is, we're all screaming for better Filipino films, but then we have one that is trying its best, and then we laugh at it"

Mallari,5676,1,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,When I first saw the trailer for this last MMFF I was onboard with it
Mallari,5676,2,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,I read ahead about what Fr
Mallari,5676,3,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,Severino Mallari was all about
Mallari,5676,4,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"Biopics are my bread and butter, and with every biopic, or in this case, an adaptation, I anticipate a degree of creative storytelling to make it more feasable for cinema"
Mallari,5676,5,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,What was the films take on this
Mallari,5676,6,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"A Generational ""curse"" in the Mallari family"
Mallari,5676,8,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"The real Mallari was allegedly scizhophrenic; so I was hoping theyd explore that, a mental illness angle plaguing the family for generations"
Mallari,5676,9,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"Much to my disappointment, the movie veered away from that and laid blame not into the serial killer but to an entirely fictional group of people who ""used"" this serial killer to kill"
Mallari,5676,10,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,Severino (Piolo Pascual) was essentially forced to kill out of love
Mallari,5676,11,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,A theme which kind of fell flat because of how many things the film wanted to juggle
Mallari,5676,12,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,Was it a mystery
Mallari,5676,13,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,Was it a thriller
Mallari,5676,14,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,A supernatural horror
Mallari,5676,15,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,A sci-fi
Mallari,5676,16,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"Yes, sci-fi"
Mallari,5676,17,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,Taking away Fr Severino's agency erases or paints the actions of the real Mallari as not his own choice; if it was indeed mental illness it wouldve made more sense but instead it was the malicious work of well meaning witches
Mallari,5676,18,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"Which, in an original story MAY work, but not in this"
Mallari,5676,19,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,Its supposed to be BASED on a real story yet it strayed a little too much into fiction
Mallari,5676,20,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,A creative choice that MIGHTVE worked if only they didnt add astral projection and timey wimey shit into it too
Mallari,5676,21,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,OH plus origins of a notorious Philippine mythic creature
Mallari,5676,22,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"There were some creative shots here and there, I particularly liked this one shot when John was walking through a door and a dolly zoom boxed him in the corridor"
Mallari,5676,23,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,However the scares were lack luster
Mallari,5676,24,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,It relied heavily jumpscares which became old fast and can be easily expected
Mallari,5676,25,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"While the makeup and visual effects were great, I dont think it utilized it enough to anything other than"
Mallari,5676,26,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,** SPOILERS FOR THE ENDING **god I hated ending
Mallari,5676,27,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"Heres DOCTOR John Mallari; granted hes a pediatrician (I think) with a FIANCE whose also a DOCTOR thats dying bc she got stabbed, his first response was NOT to bring her to a nearby hospital for first aid"
Mallari,5676,28,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"And despite being on life support clearly conscious and capable of surviving given medical aid, MISTER JOHNATAN STILL DECIDES TO BRING BACK THE BIRD AND TAKE THE CURSE"
Mallari,5676,29,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,WHICH IS THE WORST WAY TO GIVE AGENCY BACK TO THE MALLARI FAMILY when the previous 2 mallari's tried retreiving their lost agency by breaking the curse only for millenial Piolo Pascual to take it back
Mallari,5676,30,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"In summary, story is Messy"
Mallari,5676,31,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,"Acting is subpar, EXCEPT for JC Santos he stole the show"
Mallari,5676,32,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,He was amazing and a twist I saw a mile a way but still welcome because of how well he acted
Mallari,5676,33,suusheese,,80.0,ltbx,This movie couldve been something but ended being about nothing

Mallari,5793,3,lukabongdick,,120.0,ltbx,"the incorporation of filipino folklore, visuals and slick camerawork in some scenes were highlights"
Mallari,5793,4,lukabongdick,,120.0,ltbx,wished for the gore to be better executed tho

Mallari,5799,1,arvieee,,100.0,ltbx,It was fine
Mallari,5799,2,arvieee,,100.0,ltbx,The whole background ghosts should have been played more subtle than giving it background music everytime it has one
Mallari,5799,3,arvieee,,100.0,ltbx,"Like, let the audience realize they are hiding in plain sight than giving them away"
Mallari,5799,4,arvieee,,100.0,ltbx,It started to become boring after some time to be honest

Mallari,5829,2,jjmary,,80.0,ltbx,"It was inspired by a real event in history, but I feel like I didn't learn much about Father Mallari except for what I already know---he was a priest and he killed people"
Mallari,5829,3,jjmary,,80.0,ltbx,It would've been better if they thrown much factual stuff rather than fictionalized it almost completely
Mallari,5829,4,jjmary,,80.0,ltbx,"However, I did think it was great that they tried to do something different"
Mallari,5829,5,jjmary,,80.0,ltbx,Pero they did too…
Mallari,5830,1,shellsilk,,120.0,ltbx,burst out laughing when 1948 piolo pascual appeared
Mallari,5831,1,prcsmae,,80.0,ltbx,the 2 stars are for jc santos' acting and the cinematography (not the cgi that was so ugly)its cheap screams and scares
Mallari,5831,2,prcsmae,,80.0,ltbx,ganda ganda sana nung premise ampanget lang pagsulat nila ng story
Mallari,5831,3,prcsmae,,80.0,ltbx,also what was the overdramatization of a trans (also a sex worker) character purposely trying to depict them as evil
Mallari,5831,4,prcsmae,,80.0,ltbx,in 2024
Mallari,5831,5,prcsmae,,80.0,ltbx,"also cringy ass writing for the priest for the present (yung plantito) trying so hard to appeal to gen z and FAILING SO HARDbut janella's last scene was so cunty yes maam ""magugutom ako mamaya *wears shades*"" POTA YES panindigan mo pinanggagawa mo piolo"

Mallari,5835,2,ridleycheung,,80.0,ltbx,"not bad, but i definitely expected something leagues better"

Mallari,5840,3,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,aliw rin si amal at ng colloquialism ng film na ‘to
Mallari,5840,4,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,“pasensya na kung amoy kiffy” -amal bwahahahaha
Mallari,5840,5,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,"putting jest aside, i came to a realization that this nail-biting Filipino film, inspired by true events yet interwoven with fictional elements, fundamentally springs from undying love"
Mallari,5840,6,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,"each character, driven by their own ambitions, had one thing in common: their actions were motivated by love"
Mallari,5840,7,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,"among Piolo's three portrayals in ""Mallari""—Severino, Johnrey, and Jonathan—it was Johnrey i found as the most courageous character"
Mallari,5840,8,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,"his initial ambition to investigate the Mallari family's history and his selfless sacrifices, motivated by love, set him apart"
Mallari,5840,9,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,"meanwhile, Jonathan’s determination to keep Agnes alive demonstrated a different facet of this enduring theme"
Mallari,5840,10,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,"as for severino, i sympathized with him, recognizing that he never truly desired the tragic events that transpired"
Mallari,5840,11,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,"yet, he continued to submit himself in vicious killings to save his beloved mother which only reveal that desperate times need desperate actions"
Mallari,5840,12,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,lason ang wagas na pagmamahal
Mallari,5840,13,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,lason ang pamilyang alarcon

Mallari,5840,15,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,"sadly, parang ang sumira nga lang sa patronage ng traditional philippine architecture ay dahil sa mga ganitong horror films"
Mallari,5840,16,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,"nevertheless, i give this film a 10/10"
Mallari,5840,17,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,as it brings a refreshing justice in demands in the realm of modern Filipino horror cinema
Mallari,5840,18,gininina,,180.0,ltbx,lesson learned: “ang isang tao ay kabuuan lamang ng kaniyang mga pagkakamali”
Mallari,5841,1,arachnophobik,,160.0,ltbx,"CGI aside (and maybe some bad acting from small-scale actors), its quite good"

Mallari,5843,8,imbalances,,120.0,ltbx,"severino mallari, a priest from the early 1800s"
Mallari,5843,9,imbalances,,120.0,ltbx,with a fictional twist
Mallari,5843,10,imbalances,,120.0,ltbx,"non-linear storytelling, told in fragments from the past and the present (and the future—depending on how you look at it)"
Mallari,5843,11,imbalances,,120.0,ltbx,and the priest with the wig…

Mallari,5846,1,moonbeamspirit,,180.0,ltbx,"Improvements in the script, acting, and direction on differentiating the 3 timelines can still be improved"
Mallari,5846,2,moonbeamspirit,,180.0,ltbx,But I think it does a good job intermingling the 3 timelines
Mallari,5846,3,moonbeamspirit,,180.0,ltbx,Good mixing of genres too
Mallari,5846,4,moonbeamspirit,,180.0,ltbx,And exemplary acting from the cast
Mallari,5847,1,joemcua,,120.0,ltbx,"A somewhat bipolar film that when it works, it works really well but when it doesn’t, it’s glaringly obvious"
Mallari,5847,2,joemcua,,120.0,ltbx,I hope one day Philippine Cinema would embrace again practical effects we’ve done so well in the past

Mallari,5874,1,felixreyvan,,80.0,ltbx,"this has the potential to become such a great movie, but i hate how they were making it with the notion that their audience is dumb"
Mallari,5874,2,felixreyvan,,80.0,ltbx,"over-explaining some encounters, putting dialogues where dialogues shouldn't be (to allow the scenes to speak for itself), and overall just a lot of unnecessary details that didn't contribute to the story"
Mallari,5874,3,felixreyvan,,80.0,ltbx,"the story was there, the cast— manageable, and the special effects agreeable"
Mallari,5874,4,felixreyvan,,80.0,ltbx,still a big leap for filipino cinema

Mallari,5882,2,riri_lv,,100.0,ltbx,"Ang ganda pa ng concept, something I would be interested to know so much about"
Mallari,5882,3,riri_lv,,100.0,ltbx,This film truly has a great potential if only was written with a different and clearer storyline
Mallari,5882,4,riri_lv,,100.0,ltbx,"Una sa lahat, nakakanginig ‘yung mga linyahan haha akala mo mga nakuha lang somewhere on the internet just to match this generation’s language"
Mallari,5882,5,riri_lv,,100.0,ltbx,"Hay, na-dismaya lang ako nang kaunti pero ayos na rin"
Mallari,5882,6,riri_lv,,100.0,ltbx,"Nawalan na rin ng sense of suspense sa ibang mga scenes dahil nga ang predictable na ng mga susunod na jumpscare, halos sunod-sunod kasi at ‘yung iba parang out of context pa"
Mallari,5882,7,riri_lv,,100.0,ltbx,"Despite all the shortcomings, cinematography still did its job"
Mallari,5882,8,riri_lv,,100.0,ltbx,"Kudos din sa casting, magagaling naman talaga mga napili"
Mallari,5882,9,riri_lv,,100.0,ltbx,"Especially si JC Santos, never fails talaga parang paghinga lang ang pag-arte sa kanya kahit na hindi gaanong suwak ‘yung mga lines for his energy eh"
Mallari,5882,10,riri_lv,,100.0,ltbx,Binuhat nalang talaga ng acting skills ni bes ko
Mallari,5882,11,riri_lv,,100.0,ltbx,"Overall, this horror film definitely achieved its purpose to make the audience feel scared but just fall short to convey the concept’s full potential"

Mallari,5889,1,miguellugtu,,40.0,ltbx,2024 na puro useless jump scares pa rin
Mallari,5889,2,miguellugtu,,40.0,ltbx,Makes zero sense
Mallari,5889,3,miguellugtu,,40.0,ltbx,So the first Pinoy serial killer story is also because of manananggal and witches and werewolves and ghosts and astral projection and copycat killers
Mallari,5889,4,miguellugtu,,40.0,ltbx,I mean fine bold move to try this story out but so so so dumb
Mallari,5890,1,athsxx,,120.0,ltbx,"I think this movie has a lot of potential, from the acting down to the plot"
