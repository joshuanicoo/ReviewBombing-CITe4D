5,3,prospectus_capricornium,2014-12-25 00:00:00.000,70.0,imdb,"Deramas has heavily relied on the same old formula for years, and while he lost hold over the intellectual and high-brow comedy followers, his works never failed to dominate the mass market that easily get drawn to his mindlessly entertaining brand of comedy"
5,4,prospectus_capricornium,2014-12-25 00:00:00.000,70.0,imdb,"In 'The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin', his magic once again works effortlessly"
