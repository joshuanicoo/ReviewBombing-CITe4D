Praybeyt Benjamin 2,3,12,opprime-52812,2015-04-07,10.0,imdb,Perhaps the only acting that was not as cringe-worthy was the villain's which was not even that good
Praybeyt Benjamin 2,3,13,opprime-52812,2015-04-07,10.0,imdb,The only character well-developed was the main character's and no one else's
Praybeyt Benjamin 2,3,14,opprime-52812,2015-04-07,10.0,imdb,"Overall, I would recommend burning your DVD copy of this film or permanently deleting your pirated copy of it and just watch your dog take a crap as it has the same amount of entertainment in it"
Praybeyt Benjamin 2,4,1,Lloydee98,2019-01-17,70.0,imdb,"OK: James Bimby Aquino's understandably bad acting aside, ('cause he's still a child) ""The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin"" is still good"

Praybeyt Benjamin 2,5,3,prospectus_capricornium,2014-12-25,70.0,imdb,"Deramas has heavily relied on the same old formula for years, and while he lost hold over the intellectual and high-brow comedy followers, his works never failed to dominate the mass market that easily get drawn to his mindlessly entertaining brand of comedy"
Praybeyt Benjamin 2,5,4,prospectus_capricornium,2014-12-25,70.0,imdb,"In 'The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin', his magic once again works effortlessly"

Praybeyt Benjamin 2,5,6,prospectus_capricornium,2014-12-25,70.0,imdb,"Here, Vice Ganda is joined by Alex Gonzaga, Richard Yap and Bimby Yap"
Praybeyt Benjamin 2,5,7,prospectus_capricornium,2014-12-25,70.0,imdb,"Alex Gonzaga proves to be a reliable comic support, while Richard Yap provides mostly the 'kilig' element in the movie"
Praybeyt Benjamin 2,5,8,prospectus_capricornium,2014-12-25,70.0,imdb,"Storywise, there is nothing much to see, at its heart is still Benjamin, now consumed by fame and pride, and from there the film attempts to deliver lessons on humility and family"

Praybeyt Benjamin 2,194,6,davoarid,,40.0,ltbx,Praybeyt Benjamin is funny due to the clash between Ganda's bakla persona and the macho nature of the military
Praybeyt Benjamin 2,194,7,davoarid,,40.0,ltbx,"But then on this one the entire plot keeps Vice out of the military, and instead it does the comedy chestnut of ""person who is really bad at taking care of children has to take care of a child"
