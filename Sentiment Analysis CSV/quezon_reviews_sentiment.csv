Quezon,0,1,cjmff,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"Both cinematic and educational: As a college student, this gave me wider perspective not only about Quezon and the other main historical characters of the film, but about election campaigns and politics and the games politicians play"
Quezon,0,2,cjmff,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"In history, it is a hidden pearl to find a Filipino that is truly clean, without having to compromise or worse manipulate to achieve their goals"
Quezon,0,3,cjmff,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,That is why we have to thorough and unbiased research and immersion between all candidates or parties whenever we vote
Quezon,0,4,cjmff,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"MINOR SPOILERS: Through my favorite device that is film within a film, Quezon exposes the grey areas of politics, and that the historical theme of whether Filipinos truly understands what Independence entails is eye-opening (more so in the tie back ending sequence)

I also love the parallelism between the themes of the obsession of power (Osmeña but more Quezon) and hero complex (Aguinaldo and Wood) somehow disguised as public service"
Quezon,0,5,cjmff,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"Don't get me wrong, in watching this film, I believe all these men had good intentions during their tenure, but in the end they all had their past and present mistakes that the film highlights for us to be skeptical about those intentions"
Quezon,0,6,cjmff,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,The film has the staple Bayaniverse cinematography and soundtrack
Quezon,0,7,cjmff,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"My only nitpick with the film is (1) the ending kinda villianized Quezon just for dramatization and that (2) in the feminist perspective, there wasnt ample stress or building of the relationship between Quezon, Osmeña, Aguinaldo, Roxas and the women behind them, unlike in Heneral Luna and Goyo"
Quezon,0,8,cjmff,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"Pulitika lamang, walang personalan"
Quezon,1,1,NashA-80,2025-10-15,80.0,imdb,"Higher Use of Creative License: Unlike previous installments that were close to real-life events, this movie contained a lot of purely fictional scenes and plot"
Quezon,1,2,NashA-80,2025-10-15,80.0,imdb,It is more of a creative social commentary regarding the Filipino political system than a loosely-based historical recollection
Quezon,1,3,NashA-80,2025-10-15,80.0,imdb,"Overall, it is very good and creative in conveying the moral of the story but one must be careful in accepting any of the events as fact"
Quezon,2,1,SanchoD-7,2025-10-19,90.0,imdb,"Enticing and fiery: By far this is one of the movies in our film making history that actually broke the ""Filipino"" style of film making, not that it is bad but it can be too predictive especially with the characters"
Quezon,2,2,SanchoD-7,2025-10-19,90.0,imdb,It gave the protagonist a complex personality and background that almost we people relate to

Quezon,2,5,SanchoD-7,2025-10-19,90.0,imdb,"For the movie's feel everything and I mean everything is greatly beyond my expectation, it felt like it was true to life and it romanticized the vibe of that era"
Quezon,2,6,SanchoD-7,2025-10-19,90.0,imdb,The music matched the personality of Quezon which was a spectacular
Quezon,2,7,SanchoD-7,2025-10-19,90.0,imdb,And the cinematography was handled by an artist of its craft
Quezon,2,8,SanchoD-7,2025-10-19,90.0,imdb,"Although in the last part (spoilers) as said in one of the reviewer's statement in the review section, they kind of made Quezon a villain in the end, to which I have no problem with as it is a creative liberty of the writer and director to do"
Quezon,2,9,SanchoD-7,2025-10-19,90.0,imdb,Overall this film is breaking barriers and blockades

Quezon,4,10,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,This version of Quezon
Quezon,4,11,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"He's a piece of work - cunning, manipulative, and so Machiavellian it hurts"
Quezon,4,12,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"You kinda admire his brilliance, but at the same time, you can't stand how self-serving he is"
Quezon,4,13,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,What's great is that the film doesn't try to moralize
Quezon,4,14,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"It doesn't pretend to be righteous or ""for the people"
Quezon,4,15,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,""" It just shows politics as it really is - dirty, ambitious, full of people pretending to be heroes while chasing power"
Quezon,4,16,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"It's not preachy at all, and that's what makes it hit harder"
Quezon,4,17,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,The vibe
Quezon,4,18,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"Think The Wolf of Wall Street, but make it political and Filipino"

Quezon,4,22,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,There are plenty of callbacks that make it feel like a proper closure
Quezon,4,23,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,What's surprising is how Quezon ends up softening Aguinaldo's image
Quezon,4,24,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"This time, he's shown as this calm, conservative old man - almost like a fallen sage"

Jericho Rosales gives a bold performance"
Quezon,4,28,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"At first, his Quezon feels a bit exaggerated - the accent, the gestures, the swagger - but the longer you watch, the more it makes sense"
Quezon,4,29,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"We don't have much real footage of the man, so Jericho's take feels like a believable reconstruction"
Quezon,4,30,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,Tarog clearly wanted this Quezon to feel both authentic and uncomfortable - the kind of leader you recognize in today's politics
Quezon,4,31,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,The script works
Quezon,4,32,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,The occasional strong language fits perfectly - that's how real politicians talk behind closed doors
Quezon,4,33,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"The dialogue sounds lived-in, the tension feels raw"
Quezon,4,34,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"Visually, the film looks good, but you can tell there were budget limits"
Quezon,4,35,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"Some big events, like rallies, felt small in scale - more like social gatherings in hotel lobbies than massive political spectacles"
Quezon,4,36,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"Still, the indoor scenes look great and atmospheric"
Quezon,4,37,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"The American characters are forgettable except for Leonard Wood, but maybe that's intentional since they're not the focus anyway"
Quezon,4,38,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,The pacing near the end feels rushed - especially the Corregidor and Malinta Tunnel scenes
Quezon,4,39,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"The story wraps up fine, but the scale drops suddenly, like the production ran out of steam"
Quezon,4,40,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"You expect something grander, given the World War II backdrop"
Quezon,4,41,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"But even with those limits, Tarog still lands the emotional punch"
Quezon,4,42,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"My only gripe is how the film implies that all our political rot - corruption, nepotism, oligarch control - started with Quezon"
Quezon,4,43,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"Symbolically, it's clever, but it's also unfair"
Quezon,4,44,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,It's not just one man's fault
Quezon,4,45,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,This isn't about Quezon alone; it's about a system that's been rotten for generations
Quezon,4,46,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"What Quezon nails, though, is how it mirrors our current politics"
Quezon,4,47,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"The bribery, the PR manipulation, the media playing both sides - it's all there"

Quezon,4,49,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"Different names, same game"
Quezon,4,50,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"Tarog even captures the hypocrisy of the press: ""attack and collect, defend and collect"
Quezon,4,51,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,""" That line alone could describe our political media today"
Quezon,4,52,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"So yeah, Quezon isn't just about Quezon"
Quezon,4,53,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"It's a mirror - of power, greed, and us"

Quezon,4,56,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,Goyo made you question heroism
Quezon,4,57,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,But Quezon
Quezon,4,58,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"It leaves you hollow, politically agnostic, almost hopeless"
Quezon,4,59,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"Maybe that's the point - that in our politics, no one's really clean, and the cycle never ends"
Quezon,4,60,EMMANUELG-626,2025-10-16,90.0,imdb,"If that's what Tarog wanted to show, he absolutely nailed it"
Quezon,5,1,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,A Lack of Critical and Actual Criticism for the Shady Quezon: I think the film has true promise
Quezon,5,2,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,Quezon has always been quite a controversial figure of the early fight for true Philippine independence
Quezon,5,3,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,He did as much good and as much bad if you really think deeply about it BUT the film is just presented in such a dense way
Quezon,5,4,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,In posits there is true good in Politics
Quezon,5,5,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,Even sections of actual criticism in the film is really hampered by Tarrog's insistence of the right 'governance'
Quezon,5,6,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,The lack of a real alternative or an actual in depth conversations that does not really fall into this guise of moral grandstanding is prevalent that it was so eyeroll inducing
Quezon,5,7,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,You can read philosophies and still be the worst person ever - a college with Liberal Arts make you learn that quickly
Quezon,5,8,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"If Quezon did not win, what does Aguinaldo can offer in the table that he himself had not done too"
Quezon,5,9,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"Rather film, just villainizes Quezon's insistence to lead"
Quezon,5,10,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,One good example of the film's insistence for moralistic bent but lack of actual 'analysis' is the film's villainization of Quezon's use of his connection
Quezon,5,11,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,That is what connections are for
Quezon,5,12,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"To create this dynamic give and take but it oh no, that is bad - because he can make so much campaign materials"
Quezon,5,13,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"It never really delivered on the fact on what would become the Nacionalista Party lead to one of the biggest ultra-majority in the Philippine's History, a familiar sight if anyone has lived to tell in the Duterte era Congress"
Quezon,5,14,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"In fact, the film kinda glosses the fact that this same majority lead the changes in the constitution that inadvertently resulted to the Marcos Dictatorship"
Quezon,5,15,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"In fact, I do think the reason there are many rich families interested in Government is because how they were able to really to enter political spaces during this time"
Quezon,5,16,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"Like for a film that prides itself as critical, it always uses these weak arguments to posit the rather double face attitude of Quezon"
Quezon,5,17,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"I was grasping straws, because it uses the worst criticisms (ad hominems) rather than just actually pulling real punches that is still present in the current Philippine political space"
Quezon,5,18,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"It just bats this idea that Quezon wants the presidency is bad (it is not), because he wants it no matter what"
Quezon,5,19,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,His machination is bad since he is not truthful about his intention
Quezon,5,20,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"It literally facts that Quezon is a problematic and prolific muckraker, that most of what we hate about Aguinaldo is actually rooted towards his campaign against him"
Quezon,5,21,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,It is attested but a lot of actual paper trails sadly has been destroyed by the war of 45
Quezon,5,22,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,The film posits that is bad
Quezon,5,23,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,(not necessarily) but the problem here is that the film also plays out the same muckraking as noble against some of his 'enemies' since they were not able to use it openly (hypocritical)
Quezon,5,24,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,Like come-on now film
Quezon,5,25,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,That is just plain stupidity at this point
Quezon,5,26,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,You cannot just make this two sides of the coin when it's practically the same side
Quezon,5,27,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,Even just picking cabinet members from his ultra-majority is played as if its bad since he is in the end trying to seek the 'faithfuls' of his herd - like that is weak criticism of Quezon's
Quezon,5,28,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,I also hate how the film hates Quezon for his aggressive approach to independence but loves the American simply because the Americans found that the filipino plebe does not know the word about the word for Independence
Quezon,5,29,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"Stupidity, THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT THE LEADERS to begin with"
Quezon,5,30,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,Another instance of the film going for the soft analysis over real question of readiness with the leadership
Quezon,5,31,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"And also, it really gives so much pass for the Americans and how they handled the Philippines, because they are well-meaning apparently"
Quezon,5,32,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"Suddenly, the atrocities is just a side comment here and there"
Quezon,5,33,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"Even Aguinaldo, who could have been more complex as a character himself is just plainly glorified"
Quezon,5,34,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,I just feel there is so much more here that could have been made to make this actually critical in a sense that in actually is talking about things that would still be prevalent in our life and all
Quezon,5,35,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"On a lighter mode, Good performances though"
Quezon,5,36,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,Echo is effective as Quezon
Quezon,5,37,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,I personally think certain actors looked closer to the very Hispanized Quezon but he has character for it
Quezon,5,38,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,He performed really well and the cavalcade of supporting role was a welcome surprise
Quezon,5,39,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,"I personally think the film did well visually and editing wise, which is a lot for a local film, though the costuming though is really bad - a lot of badly fitted suits"
Quezon,5,40,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,I will still recommend this BUT it lacks a deep reading about Quezon's role in PHI history tbh
Quezon,5,41,akoaytao1234,2025-11-19,30.0,imdb,It is important to look at this with a more critical eyes since this does tackle a lot of true issues about Quezon but in a way that feels misguided tbh
Quezon,6,1,FLICKSWITHMIGS,2025-10-24,80.0,imdb,"Quezon (2025): ""The story & life of Quezon"": Quezon feels like a well-crafted film that Jerrold Tarog put a lot of effort into, both in writing and directing"
Quezon,6,2,FLICKSWITHMIGS,2025-10-24,80.0,imdb,Rosales's performance as the lead really stands out and carries the movie
Quezon,6,3,FLICKSWITHMIGS,2025-10-24,80.0,imdb,"Visually, it's a treat with a unique old-school style and great production design that captures the early 1900s vibe perfectly"
Quezon,6,4,FLICKSWITHMIGS,2025-10-24,80.0,imdb,"The story also creates a good amount of intrigue, even if some parts aren't perfectly executed"
Quezon,6,5,FLICKSWITHMIGS,2025-10-24,80.0,imdb,"Despite its flaws, it's an interesting watch because of its strong visuals and engaging narrative"
Quezon,6,6,FLICKSWITHMIGS,2025-10-24,80.0,imdb,"Overall, Quezon is a solid film that shows real craftsmanship and is worth a watch"
Quezon,7,1,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,"Good message, Bad Film: After watching Quezon"
Quezon,7,2,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,It truly feels like a hit piece for the old president
Quezon,7,3,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,"Arrogant, Megalomaniac, I am the Philippines"
Quezon,7,4,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,"The movie constantly states that you must look at things from different perspectives, yet shows that he does not have any redeeming quality"
Quezon,7,5,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,Other than i guess he looks good
Quezon,7,6,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,Satirical claims are understandable as this film is shot like a satire
Quezon,7,7,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,"Quezon v Osmeña, Quezon v Wood"
Quezon,7,8,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,"But idk why its not like that with chapter 3, Quezon v Aguinaldo"
Quezon,7,9,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,"You can say that Quezon is already well regarded by many and a good film came out a few years back (Quezon's Game), but that is just careless in this day and age"
Quezon,7,10,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,"As movies like this are perceived as truth by those who are not busily reading in-depth filipino history books, by students and others in the Philippines

But to give credit where credit is due"
Quezon,7,11,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,"Most criticism in the film of quezon are real: the r**e case, the being two faced, being an arrogant/megalomaniac, back handing Osmeña"
Quezon,7,12,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,One criticism i have is the I am the Philippines scene
Quezon,7,13,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,I know this film uses fictional elements but pumping up the drama at the end while the truth (more of a rumor) is that he said this in a New York hospital
Quezon,7,14,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,while looking at refection of him self
Quezon,7,15,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,Its hard to like this film if you one of those that dont like grand standing and moral messaging being pushed in the forefront
Quezon,7,16,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,Cause it happens a lot
Quezon,7,17,JohnB-8497,2025-11-01,50.0,imdb,With joven's uncle and wife

Quezon,13,1,calliebaby,,200.0,ltbx,i never doubted jericho rosales’ casting
Quezon,13,2,calliebaby,,200.0,ltbx,"he harnessed the charisma needed to portray the cunning of quezon from all those years of heartthrob and leading man roles, and it resulted in an exceptional performancealso, quezon-osmeña bl when EME HAHAHAHAHA"
Quezon,14,1,cocoberts,,200.0,ltbx,I like how the movie was sequenced in a sort of “flashback” story telling up until the last few bits of the movie for closure
Quezon,14,2,cocoberts,,200.0,ltbx,"However the closure didnt even feel like closure after all the mess, it just left the audience to just know what the mess was and there wasnt really like a conclusive ending except for the fact that quezon’s life simply just went on after all that mess being on the brink of ruining him"
Quezon,14,3,cocoberts,,200.0,ltbx,But i liked the fact that there wasnt like an absolute closure part of the movie

Quezon,22,2,marcelo___,,120.0,ltbx,"It aims for epic, but somewhere between the dramatic speeches and historical gravitas, it loses its spark"
Quezon,22,3,marcelo___,,120.0,ltbx,"Ambitious, yes, but the heavy-handed theatrics and slow pacing make it more exhausting than engaging"
Quezon,22,4,marcelo___,,120.0,ltbx,"A decent attempt at history, but not one I’ll remember fondly"
Quezon,23,1,junreyisageek,,180.0,ltbx,"Pinaka maganda sa trilogy ng bayaniverse, Very Good casting lahat walang tapon, hopefully maraming Pinoy Ang makapanood neto, sana maaga mailabas sa Netflix para mas maraming audience, the Philippines need this kind of film, Jerold Tarog is now my favorite Filipino film Director"
Quezon,24,1,nico_quejano,,40.0,ltbx,A few weeks ago Cinemartys reminded all of us the massacre committed by Leonard Wood in Mindanao
Quezon,24,2,nico_quejano,,40.0,ltbx,"But somehow, this movie humanized Leonard Wood"
Quezon,24,3,nico_quejano,,40.0,ltbx,"Making him charismatic and only wants to serve the people, at worst, a bureaucrat"
Quezon,24,4,nico_quejano,,40.0,ltbx,But Leonard Wood was racist and an imperialist
Quezon,24,5,nico_quejano,,40.0,ltbx,"His writings about the Philippines, depicting Filipinos as mostly backward and savages, were the reason why the US government did not give us independence immediately"
Quezon,24,6,nico_quejano,,40.0,ltbx,"And yet the movie not only gave credence to his racist tirades, it made it into facts"
Quezon,24,7,nico_quejano,,40.0,ltbx,This is wrong in so many levels
Quezon,24,8,nico_quejano,,40.0,ltbx,"I understand that we should unmask our heroes, but making the founding fathers as villains is a slippery and dangerous slope for a nation that easily forgets its own history"
Quezon,24,9,nico_quejano,,40.0,ltbx,"At a time that our sovereignity is in peril by outside and even inside forces, a movie questioning our genesis is a bit irresponsible"
Quezon,24,10,nico_quejano,,40.0,ltbx,Not to mention the hypocrisy of a rousing speech against patronage politics then thanking the sister of the sitting president and the daughter of the dictator in the end credits
Quezon,24,11,nico_quejano,,40.0,ltbx,"Admittedly, Quezon is a much better film than Goyo, but it's irrelevant at this point"

Quezon,27,1,alexdgo,,140.0,ltbx,"He takes and he takes and he takes, and he keeps winning anyway"
Quezon,28,1,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,"i had a chance to watch their block screening on the first day and got to see their amazing actors, mon confiado, benjamin alves, jake macapagal, ana abad santos, and therese malvar, thanks to national university"
Quezon,28,2,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,the concept of making a prequel about the people we call our national heroes is a smart and refreshing move in philippine cinema
Quezon,28,3,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,"the director shows them as normal people with strong political desires, which mirrors the never ending power game we still see today"
Quezon,28,4,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,"from emilio aguinaldo to manuel quezon, all the way to the marcos-duterte tandem, i must say they follow the same pattern"
Quezon,28,5,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,we treat these men like mythical figures and grow up with a clean version of them
Quezon,28,6,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,"then the film shows them bargaining, manipulating, and protecting their own interests, and you realize the cycle never stopped"
Quezon,28,7,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,"it feels heavy at first because you hope someone in that era stood as the clear hero, but the more the story unfolds, the more you see how power shaped all of them"
Quezon,28,8,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,"what i love about this film is that i went inside the cinema thinking I would learn another honest story from our former presidents and understand why they are considered important figures in history, not just because they led the country but because of what they sacrificed during their time"
Quezon,28,9,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,"but after watching it, i realized that both emilio aguinaldo and manuel quezon, despite the rivalry and the clear protagonist antagonist framing, never truly cared about the filipino people and were both playing dirty"
Quezon,28,10,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,quezon is a great communicator and strategist
Quezon,28,11,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,these helped him rise from being a lawyer to becoming the second president of the philippines
Quezon,28,12,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,we grow up hearing his name and thinking of one of the best presidents we ever had
Quezon,28,13,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,"in the film, all he talks about is independence, but I never actually saw the real reason behind it"
Quezon,28,14,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,"was he doing it for the country, for the people, or to validate his own hard work and protect his power and money"
Quezon,28,15,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,it took me almost two months to write this review because the film stayed in my mind longer than i expected
Quezon,28,16,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,"every time I tried to sit down, i ended up thinking about another scene or another line that hinted at something deeper"
Quezon,28,17,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,it’s not the kind of film you watch and forget the next day
Quezon,28,18,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,it leaves you with questions that don’t settle right away
Quezon,28,19,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,i kept replaying how the characters moved and how their decisions shaped everything
Quezon,28,20,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,"the more i revisited it in my head, the more i understood why it bothered me in a good way"
Quezon,28,21,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,it challenges the way we grew up seeing these men
Quezon,28,22,yvreim,,160.0,ltbx,it makes you look past the titles and medals and ask who they were when the doors were closed

Quezon,45,3,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,"When you hear the name Manuel Quezon, what comes to mind is that he was the 2nd most beloved President of the Philippines"

Quezon,45,5,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,I realized that Quezon wasn’t really much of a good President for his achievements
Quezon,45,6,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,He is not really effective as a leader or able to accomplish anything for the country
Quezon,45,7,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,But instead taking the government’s power by maneuvering to get what he wants and to establish what once was a blissful tree to a rotten egg
Quezon,45,8,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,"He was a master of playing dirty tricks to bribe the people creating conflict against his rivals causing them to get in the way of propaganda like Osmena, General Wood, and Aguinaldo"
Quezon,45,9,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,Involving the press questioning their political views on both perspectives
Quezon,45,10,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,Another thing I noticed is that the Americans were actually trying to help the Filipinos as General Wood realized the people didn’t have proper education just from not knowing what independence means
Quezon,45,11,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,They were helping us to establish better roads and build a proper government system for our country
Quezon,45,12,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,The biopic not only showcases Quezon’s rise and downfall but alongside how our government is still the same until now
Quezon,45,13,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,"“I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos, rather than a country run like heaven by the Americans, because no matter how bad the Filipino government might be, it can still be improved"

Quezon,45,21,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,That I should be a responsible voter in the future by knowing who to vote for and understanding what this stands for
Quezon,45,22,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,Other factors that I realized to consider are self-dignity and moral values are important to look for in a leader
Quezon,45,23,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,Patriotism can be as simple as exercising your right to vote and to vote wisely
Quezon,45,24,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,"In conclusion, despite Manuel Quezon’s search for independence and freedom for the Philippines he was unsuccessful"
Quezon,45,25,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,"I say that because up to this day, our political system is naive and independence is something we have been fighting for up till this day"

Quezon,45,28,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,I’m a very big history nerd especially Philippine History so 100% recommended to any historian fan out there
Quezon,45,29,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales and Jerold Tarog (big fan to both of them) did another phenomenal project for not only themselves but to every Filipino
Quezon,45,31,crow_355,,200.0,ltbx,At Maraming Salamat for making this film come true
Quezon,46,1,rhosynn,,200.0,ltbx,"jericho rosales alam lang kita kasi kamukha mo aso ng kaibigan ko (this is a neutral statement, cute naman yung aso) i was so pleasantly surprised by how well you acted, consider me a fan… i had doubts with the casting at first because irl quezon was a whitewashed mestizo, the stuff of envy for self hating transracial losers on discord, but your acting really sold me, wow… 10/10 trapo moves, no wonder nagalit grandbaby ni quezon HAHA…on a more serious note, i like how this film seems to be tarrog’s way of interrogating himself as a creative, especially with the unintended effect heneral luna (2015) had on swaying the public in support of strongman personas (re: duterte in 2016)… in what ways is the filipino artist complicit in propaganda"
Quezon,46,2,rhosynn,,200.0,ltbx,"or i guess more broadly speaking, in what ways can art and narratives be co-opted"
Quezon,46,3,rhosynn,,200.0,ltbx,i like that this movie invites skepticism kumbaga… may bisa nga ang kwento oo pero bisa para kanino
Quezon,46,4,rhosynn,,200.0,ltbx,bisa para saan / hanggang saan
Quezon,46,5,rhosynn,,200.0,ltbx,and i think that’s why i have a soft spot for it… i respect movies that encourage the audience to ask questions
Quezon,46,6,rhosynn,,200.0,ltbx,"timely siya, in fairness, idk kung intended ba o hindi pero ayun, relevant nga, lalo na in this second marcos presidency where historical distortion thrives precisely because the will to question narratives is being stamped out…pero speaking of narratives, i wish the power of the masses was portrayed with more depth  lalo na dahil next movie tungkol kay magsaysay, grandfather of filipino populism… i was disappointed by the scene where woods asked farmers and peasants if they were in favor of independence because it was such a shallow (and quite homogenous"
Quezon,46,7,rhosynn,,200.0,ltbx,) portrayal of filipino sentiments on US colonization… where are the sakdals
Quezon,46,8,rhosynn,,200.0,ltbx,where is pkp-1930
Quezon,46,9,rhosynn,,200.0,ltbx,it’s historically inaccurate to suggest that all filipinos were passive about independence
Quezon,46,10,rhosynn,,200.0,ltbx,"and speaking of pkp… SIGHHH i really don’t have high hopes for the magsaysay movie… basic details pa nga lang sa pkp di inaayos, huks pa kaya… fact check: the movie’s english subs are wrong, pkp cannot be translated as cpp, those are two different groups… second fact check: nabong was definitely affiliated with pkp but the aglipay-nabong duo did not run under the party name pkp… they were republicans… important distinction because since when tf was pkp ever allowed on the same playing field as quezon’s nacionalistas"
Quezon,46,11,rhosynn,,200.0,ltbx,also since we’re already ranting tarrog do NOOOOOTTT try to sympathy bait me with aguinaldo’s flop campaign parade i will never extend sympathy for him i know for a fact that that loser was a collaborator for jpn during ww2 HE HAS NO LOYALTY FOR THE FILIPINO PEOPLE YOU CAN’T FOOL ME
Quezon,47,1,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"After   and :   , TBA Studios and director Jerrold Tarog closes the BayaniVerse trilogy with '' — a film that trades the sound of gunfire for the noise of politics, but still burns with the same intensity"
Quezon,47,2,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s not a war of soldiers this time, but a war of ideals, egos, and ambitions — fought in meetings, elections, and through the public eye"
Quezon,47,3,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales gives a career-defining performance as Manuel L
Quezon,47,5,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"You can tell he studied Quezon’s mannerisms down to the smallest gesture — the posture, the pauses, even the rhythm of his voice"
Quezon,47,6,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"His portrayal balances elegance with cunning charm, showing us both the gentleman, the strategist, the patriot, and the politician"
Quezon,47,7,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"The film’s structure is bold and stylish — divided into four chapters, each framed like a “V” (versus) battle, pitting Quezon against different political and historical figures of his time, accompanied by a subtitle based on dialogues in each chapter"
Quezon,47,8,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"It feels very Snyder Cut in its presentation — grand, deliberate, and unapologetically significant"
Quezon,47,9,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"The fourth chapter, the longest one, brings everything to a dramatic and climactic close that feels inevitable and tragic"
Quezon,47,10,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"Mon Confiado returns as Emilio Aguinaldo, and once again, he commands attention"
Quezon,47,11,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,His portrayal of a president haunted by legacy and resentment is one of his best performances yet
Quezon,47,12,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"His dialogues, essentially saying that he did everything he could for the Filipinos, echo with pride and regret"
Quezon,47,13,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s still surreal to see Game of Thrones veteran Iain Glen as Governor-General Leonard Wood, but even in his few minutes onscreen, he leaves a strong impression with his performance"
Quezon,47,14,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"Romnick Sarmenta also deserves praise for his controlled and weighty take on Sergio Osmeña, grounding every scene he’s in"
Quezon,47,15,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"The film cleverly incorporates black-and-white silent film sequences, serving as historical vignettes and mirrors of Quezon’s inner world"
Quezon,47,16,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,They show us the contrast between the public image and private intentions
Quezon,47,17,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,Even more playful are Benjamin Alves and Aaron Villaflor playing not only as the younger versions of Quezon and Joven Hernando in flashbacks but also as actors in those silent films
Quezon,47,18,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"Karylle shines as Aurora Quezon, bringing class, grace, and quiet strength to her role as a partner who understands the weight of her husband’s ambition"
Quezon,47,19,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"Meanwhile, Joross Gamboa may be new to the BayaniVerse, stepping into the role of the recast Eduardo Rusca"
Quezon,47,20,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"But he still feels right at home in this trilogy, proving his versatility in dramatic territory"
Quezon,47,21,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"'' is, without a doubt, the most political film in the trilogy"
Quezon,47,22,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"While its predecessors dealt with wars and heroism through action and tragedy, this movie unfolds during the Commonwealth election era, where battles are fought through speeches, alliances, and betrayals"
Quezon,47,23,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"Tarog turns politics into theater, and every act has consequences"
Quezon,47,24,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"If I were to rank all three BayaniVerse films:Heneral LunaQuezonGoyo: Ang Batang HeneralAnd yeah, this movie may have lacked action compared to its predecessors, and some might find the pacing slow or the dialogue too heavy-structured, but that’s where its strength also lies"
Quezon,47,25,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"The movie challenges us to listen, read between the lines, and confront the truth that leadership often lives in the grey area between heroism and hypocrisy"
Quezon,47,26,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"What makes this linger isn’t a rousing battle cry, but a haunting reflection:       ,          —"
Quezon,47,27,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"Still, '' stands tall as a worthy conclusion to the BayaniVerse, both grand in scope, rich in detail, and haunting in its honesty about power and nationhood"
Quezon,47,28,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"And yes, stay for the end-credit scene — whether it truly closes the saga or hints at something beyond, it’s the vague ending that leaves you proud, curious, and reflective all at once"
Quezon,47,29,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"In the end, Tarog doesn’t just tell us who Manuel L"
Quezon,47,30,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon was — he shows us the kind of leader widely regarded as one of the most significant figures in Philippine history
Quezon,47,31,jolsf,,160.0,ltbx,"With that being said, I’m going to give this movie…8/10"

Quezon,56,1,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Hell week is over, so I can finally write my recent movie reviews"
Quezon,56,2,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Let's start with the movie I watched in the cinema this November: Quezon (2025)At first, I had no idea kung paano ang takbo ng kwento, but I've heard and we tackled it with one of our lesson sa ArtApp where we talked about the Art and Society, Art and Politics"
Quezon,56,3,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Since then, I was curious about how the movie portrayed Quezon, and how his administration affected the Philippines"
Quezon,56,4,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"I'm glad to have a chance to see it in the theater, it was a different experience"
Quezon,56,5,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"This will be long as I did my research a while ago after watching it kasi as someone who is not that literate with the politics, it can be confusing"
Quezon,56,6,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Pero, it gave me an opportunity to look at the history myself"
Quezon,56,7,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon Vs
Quezon,56,8,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"OsmeñaDuring his time, hindi lang Americans ang kalaban ni Quezon"
Quezon,56,9,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,May mga kapwa Pilipino siya na may ibang idea para sa bansa
Quezon,56,10,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Hindi na kalaban from outside, but someone beside him"
Quezon,56,11,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon and Osmeña were both brilliant, but their visions didn’t always match"
Quezon,56,12,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Their rivalry wasn’t about hatred
Quezon,56,13,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,It was about direction
Quezon,56,14,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Who can lead the nation better
Quezon,56,15,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Which path will bring Filipinos closer to independence
Quezon,56,16,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Historically, after passing the Jones Law, Quezon became Senate President, pero kasama niya noon si Sergio Osmeña bilang Speaker of the House"
Quezon,56,17,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,May ideology clash sa pagitan nila
Quezon,56,18,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Osmeña was more open to gradual transition, maybe compromises"
Quezon,56,19,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Pero si Quezon gusto ng mas klarong direksyon sa independence
Quezon,56,20,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Dumating yung time na naglatag ng Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act, batas na may planong bigyan ang Pilipinas ng independence pero may mga kondisyon tulad nung retention ng US military bases"
Quezon,56,21,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Si Osmeña sumuporta, pero si Quezon tumutol, gusto niya tunay na kalayaan"
Quezon,56,22,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Pinamunuan niya yung campaign para i-reject ang HHC at gumawa ng mas maayos na plano
Quezon,56,23,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"This eventually led to the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934, which set up a 10-year transition period toward independence"
Quezon,56,24,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Nagkaayos sila para sa 1935 election: Quezon bilang President, Osmeña Vice-President"
Quezon,56,25,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Nanalo sila at nagsimula ang Commonwealth
Quezon,56,26,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"It is a fact na nag-advance ang pilipinas during his term pero some elites benefited more than the common people, so the effects weren’t evenly felt"
Quezon,56,27,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Basically, Quezon’s leadership advanced the country on paper and at the top levels, pero hindi lahat nakaramdam ng pagbabago sa araw-araw nilang buhay"
Quezon,56,28,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon Vs
Quezon,56,29,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"WoodThere's this Wood’s mission sa Pilipinas, na tinawag na Wood–Forbes Mission, sent by the U"
Quezon,56,31,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,para i-assess kung ready na ba ang bansa for independence
Quezon,56,32,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Sila ni Forbes literally inikot ang halos lahat ng provinces, tiningnan yung governance, economy, education, at social conditions"
Quezon,56,33,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Ang conclusion nila
Quezon,56,34,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Marami pang Pilipino hindi pa ready mag-govern on their own
Quezon,56,35,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"At sa totoo lang, hindi sila totally mali"
Quezon,56,36,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Marami sa mga pilipino noon lalo na ang mga pilipinong walang access sa edukasyon na hindi talaga alam kung ano ang ibig sabihin ng kalayaan
Quezon,56,37,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"May scene doon sa movie inikot ni Wood yung mga baryo at tinanong ang mga tao tungkol sa freedom, may isang farmer na sumagot, “Masarap,” kasi akala niya ang kalayaan ay pagkain lang"
Quezon,56,38,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"It is sad but it's true na ang mga tao ay madalas na focus sa araw-araw nilang buhay, lalo na kung paano makakapag-hain ng pagkain sa kanilang hapag-kainan (wow, lalim)"
Quezon,56,39,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Kaya natural na naging skeptical si Wood sa kakayahan ng mga Pilipino na mag-govern
Quezon,56,40,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Kahit sa mga elite, may problema rin"
Quezon,56,41,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Maraming local leaders yung mas interesado sa sariling kapangyarihan at personal gain na kaysa sa long-term good ng bansa
Quezon,56,42,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Madali silang magpadala sa opportunism, kaya minsan hindi sila sumusuporta sa reforms"
Quezon,56,43,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Dahil don, kahit nakapagtayo si Quezon ng institutions at frameworks, hindi pantay yung epekto sa ordinaryong tao katulad ng mga magsasaka, mas nakinabang ang mga elite, habang karamihan ng masa stuck sa poverty, limitadong edukasyon, at lupa"
Quezon,56,44,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon Vs

Quezon,56,48,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,Makikita doon sa 1935 presidential campaign ni Aguinaldo
Quezon,56,49,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Kasama niya yung supposed VP niya, pero compared sa massive support ni Quezon, maliit lang yung entourage"
Quezon,56,50,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Low-budget, few supporters, at sa maliit na pagtitipon lang, Di katulad kay Quezon, nasa sasakyan, maraming supporters, parang festival"
Quezon,56,51,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Sa isang scene, pinapaalis siya sa lugar (hindi ko matandaan kung saan), tapos sinabi niya na hindi na siya babalik"
Quezon,56,52,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Eto parang dramatization nalang, pero historical fact na natalo talaga siya ng malaki kasi Quezon got around 68% ng vote, habang Aguinaldo less than 20%"
Quezon,56,53,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,It's a matter of nationalism vs
Quezon,56,54,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,new governance ni quezon
Quezon,56,55,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"""Wala kayong utang na loob"
Quezon,56,56,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"""Controversial si Aguinaldo dahil sa mga paratang na involved siya sa deaths ni Andrés Bonifacio at Antonio Luna"
Quezon,56,57,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"After Tejeros Convention noong 1897, na-execute si Bonifacio at yung kapatid niya"
Quezon,56,58,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Maraming sources ang nagsasabi na in-approve ni Aguinaldo yung order, sabi niya “for the sake of the country"
Quezon,56,59,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"” Later, si Luna naman na-lure sa meeting sa Cabanatuan at pinatay; may mga historians na tinutukoy yung telegram ni Aguinaldo bilang evidence na posibleng siya ang nag-orchestrate"
Quezon,56,60,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Hindi lahat malinaw, pero malinaw na messy ang Filipino politics noon, halo-halo ang power, loyalty, at personal ambition"
Quezon,56,61,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Aguinaldo could have humiliated Quezon by bringing up personal matters, pero hindi niya ginawa"
Quezon,56,62,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon won, became first president of the Commonwealth, and set up the all-Filipino cabinet"
Quezon,56,63,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"He tried reforms like the Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933, pero marami ang nagsasabi na hindi daw ito effective kasi controlled pa rin ng landlords ang local politics, kaya maraming peasants ang naiwan sa kahirapan"

Quezon,56,65,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"JovenFictional siya, I know"
Quezon,56,66,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Pero, joven served as the eyes ng audience"
Quezon,56,67,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Sa simula, nung nakita niya si Quezon sa boat, hopeful pa siya, baka this person is really the way to change"
Quezon,56,68,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Simple pa yung pananaw niya noon, hero si Quezon, clear ang moral compass, he's a good person"
Quezon,56,69,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Pero habang lumalalim yung kwento, habang mas nalalaman niya yung political struggles, nagbabago rin yung tingin niya"
Quezon,56,70,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Nakikita niya yung tension kay Osmeña, kay Aguinaldo, pati sa mga pilipino"
Quezon,56,71,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Kapag titignan mo, mas naiintindihan mo yung history, hindi na pure heroes and villains ang nakikita mo"
Quezon,56,72,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"People have their own agendas, limits, at minsan kailangan gumawa ng “dirty work” para maabot yung goals nila"
Quezon,56,73,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Nakikita rin natin kung paano yung utang na loob, loyalty, at personal connections gumagawa ng ripple effects sa buong political system, at paano siya nakakaapekto sa mga ordinaryong pilipino"
Quezon,56,74,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Overall, through technical, I love the cinematography, yung color theory na ginamit nila, yung soundtrack and everything"
Quezon,56,75,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"I love movies like this, and I'm looking forward for the next Bayaniverse ni Tarog, which I think is Magsaysay"
Quezon,56,76,syncyore,,160.0,ltbx,"Yay, the best president of the Philippines"
Quezon,57,1,zeronekoko,,140.0,ltbx,"Throughout the ""Bayaniverse"" trilogy we see through the eyes of the fictitious journalist Joven Hernando as he witnesses the rise and fall of the national hero, and of himself"
Quezon,57,2,zeronekoko,,140.0,ltbx,"We share his naivete in ""Heneral Luna"", his awakening in ""Goyo"", and finally his hypocrisy in ""Quezon"""
Quezon,57,3,zeronekoko,,140.0,ltbx,"The character of Joven stands in as the Filipino people, whose principles waver at the sight of precious opportunity and promise"
Quezon,57,4,zeronekoko,,140.0,ltbx,"Joven has never fully let go of his tendency to idolize the man behind the power, his attachment to such figures taught him less to be wary of following their footsteps and taught him more of their machinations and how he could benefit from it all, only to be ultimately discarded after falling victim to the schemes of the ""hero"" he betrayed his principles for"
Quezon,57,5,zeronekoko,,140.0,ltbx,"Like Joven, we are complicit in the ills of our country by our own inaction and tolerance"
Quezon,57,6,zeronekoko,,140.0,ltbx,It is much worse of a sin that we choose to close our eyes even if we have already seen the truth
Quezon,57,7,zeronekoko,,140.0,ltbx,"We have the resources, the history, and the privilege of correcting our mistakes but why do we remain stubborn"

Quezon,68,1,hanniluvr,,,ltbx,"i watched this a long time ago but i’m only reviewing it now because i have been trying to gather my very conflicting thoughts on it… alas, i still have not finished doing that but this review is long overdue"
Quezon,68,2,hanniluvr,,,ltbx,"i think it’s an enjoyable movie but there were some times where the film—i’m not sure whether intentionally ur unintentionally—romanticizes certain figures that shouldn’t be romanticized at all, and in turn the audience for this film did exactly that"
Quezon,68,3,hanniluvr,,,ltbx,"ironically, at the same time this film also tried to paint the figures in a bad light, and that’s exactly where the lines start to blur to the point you don’t know what the movie is trying to say anymore"
Quezon,68,4,hanniluvr,,,ltbx,"i know this comes off as “that one friend who’s too woke”, but this is the best i can articulate my icky feelings toward this movie right now"
Quezon,68,5,hanniluvr,,,ltbx,"in general, i do not think it had a good impact—it had a good concept, but ultimately i do not think it delivered a point at all"
Quezon,68,6,hanniluvr,,,ltbx,this review shares my sentiments quite well
Quezon,69,1,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,I get why the Quezon family might not love this
Quezon,69,2,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"But honestly, that’s exactly what Gerald Tarog has been building toward since Heneral Luna and Goyo"
Quezon,69,3,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,The trilogy isn’t just about flawed heroes; it’s about a nation that has never been fully ready
Quezon,69,4,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"Heroes rise because the people, the institutions, the country aren’t prepared to carry themselves"
Quezon,69,5,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,And Quezon leans into that idea
Quezon,69,6,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,The film asks: What does independence even mean when you’re young as a nation and surrounded by bigger geopolitical forces
Quezon,69,7,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"Here, politics is spectacle"
Quezon,69,8,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"Everyone is performing, maneuvering, managing appearances"
Quezon,69,9,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s less “be angry” like Luna, and less “blind obedience” like Goyo"
Quezon,69,10,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,It simply shows you that everyone—from local elites to foreign powers—is taking us for a ride
Quezon,69,11,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"And Quezon, in this telling, becomes a product of that pressure"
Quezon,69,12,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"Not a saint, not a villain—just someone doing what the moment required"
Quezon,69,13,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,What fascinated me was how consistent Aguinaldo is across all three films
Quezon,69,14,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"You didn’t like him before, but here you can finally sympathize"
Quezon,69,15,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"The cast is strong, and the historical texture is rich"
Quezon,69,16,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,My issues are mostly structural
Quezon,69,17,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"Since this is a biographical piece, the core tension is softer—alam mo na where it ends, alam mo na he becomes a hero, alam mo na we get independence"
Quezon,69,18,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,So the pacing won’t land for everyone
Quezon,69,19,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,Luna worked because it tapped into a collective anger at a very specific time
Quezon,69,20,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"Here, the emotional punch is more muted, more contemplative"
Quezon,69,21,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"I get why Tarog didn’t turn this into an activist film per se, but that choice also holds the film back from being as explosive as the first"
Quezon,69,22,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"Still, as a trilogy capstone, it’s thoughtful and well-acted"
Quezon,69,23,bobfreking,,160.0,ltbx,"I admire the ambition, even if this one didn’t hit me as hard as the earlier entries"
Quezon,70,1,onlylotus,,120.0,ltbx,It was really entertaining however I think it was too prejudiced against Quezon and started to drift away from actual facts about the history of the Philippines during the promise of independence
Quezon,71,1,yelzx,,140.0,ltbx,performative president
Quezon,72,1,czarinasanxiety,,140.0,ltbx,"a mirror of history — the philippines yet again longs for bona fide journalism that sees its independence through, but quenches its thirst for this “independence” with unprecedented bumbling about a new republic that was being rushed"
Quezon,72,2,czarinasanxiety,,140.0,ltbx,"the word “independence” was relentlessly thrown around, weaponized by quezon against the unknowing public who couldn’t have known better; therefore insisting on his name’s importance—building his name on white lies, deceit, and empty promises"
Quezon,72,3,czarinasanxiety,,140.0,ltbx,"quezon’s opponent: the phantom of an ego much bigger than himselfmy favorite part was that it was a movie within a movie  always love a little silent film moment hehe i tried watching the hunchback of notre dame and it was fye literally no words for how frustrating every male character was being  questionable script and direction at times HAHAHAHAH but it’s okay  the movie was gorgeous and the budget was deeeeefinitely put to good use not one shot felt empty  as for the script, i’m not a big fan of films that claim to be period pieces but are too lazy to materialize the linguistics of the time  BUT"
Quezon,72,4,czarinasanxiety,,140.0,ltbx,it was NICE

Quezon,73,7,pandesaul,,180.0,ltbx,"very fun to watch him be a piece of shit but also kind of conflicting since this of course isn't as fictional as saul's character but yeah; idk, basta, very enjoyable film"

Quezon,76,1,ysmaelbp,,160.0,ltbx,"While Heneral Luna showed the good and the bad of public service, Quezon showed the good and the bad of politics"
Quezon,76,2,ysmaelbp,,160.0,ltbx,"It prioritized storytelling than historical accuracy, and there are a few times that that bias didn't work, specifically with their portrayal of Aguinaldo"
Quezon,76,3,ysmaelbp,,160.0,ltbx,"It prioritized dialog over cinematography, and weirdly enough is as witty as Heneral Luna but without the stunning establishing shots"
Quezon,76,4,ysmaelbp,,160.0,ltbx,"While it is not a 100% historically accurate movie, I highly recommend this film to those who think Manuel Luis Quezon is just the ""Father of the Filipino Language"", as its overall portrayal of him is a flawed politician that had the independence as his goal, but wants to save the Philippines on his own selfish terms"

Quezon,84,6,suzynayeon,,100.0,ltbx,"anyway, with all his faults and narcissism, 'di hamak na mas lamang ang magandang legacy niya"
Quezon,84,7,suzynayeon,,100.0,ltbx,he's honestly one of the good ones (ph president)
Quezon,84,8,suzynayeon,,100.0,ltbx,he's still in my top 3
Quezon,84,9,suzynayeon,,100.0,ltbx,(wow top 3 na para bang bias ranking sa kpop)
Quezon,85,1,jaypeep,,160.0,ltbx,so good
Quezon,85,2,jaypeep,,160.0,ltbx,"a style i don’t think i’ve seen before in filipino movies, or even in recent films in general"
Quezon,85,3,jaypeep,,160.0,ltbx,it’s fun and interesting the whole way through
Quezon,85,4,jaypeep,,160.0,ltbx,my only issue is that it’s a bit hard to tell at first whether the scenes are set in the past or the present
Quezon,86,1,seenbyivee,,160.0,ltbx,watched it for the plot and the only takeaway i had was ang pogi pala ni jericho rosales
Quezon,87,1,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,"I consider myself a history nerd and i love movies (obv), so getting to watch this masterpiece alone was a two-birds-in-one-stone situation"
Quezon,87,2,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,"Disclaimer: this particular part of history isn't my specialty/fixation, this review is based on the movie direction"
Quezon,87,3,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,"As for historical accuracy, would probably need to read up on it again"
Quezon,87,4,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,"Firstly, my fav thing about this one was camera work"
Quezon,87,5,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,Props to Pong Ignacio for the brilliant shots (apparently he also worked for the director's other Bayaniverse films which is interestinggg)
Quezon,87,6,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,"Secondly, the cinematography (still Ignacio) mmmm chef's kiss"
Quezon,87,7,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,"Noticed this especially in wide shots and during the parallel campaign scenes between Aguinaldo and Quezon, where the color grading for Quezon's POV was bright and colorful while Aguinaldo's POV turned into this vintage dull tone that contrasted both of their character progressions/regressions"
Quezon,87,8,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,"As a fan of arthouse films, where the direction of the storyline isn't really straightforward, absolutely loved the experimental storytelling which switches back and forth between Joven, Rusca, and Nadia watching the ""films"" as a narration guide then back to the actual events that happen"
Quezon,87,9,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,Found that very compelling
Quezon,87,10,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,"A scene I found rly funny (probs one of my favorites) was when Quezon and Joven bantered about Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Philosophy, and Ethics plsss (bc I get it help)"
Quezon,87,11,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,"Another fav abt the film was the score, especially in particular the one when Aguinaldo stood and walked towards the stage to give his speech during the 1935 elections scene, should've had a longer exposure hhhhTo summarize, I love how this depiction on one of the most notable ""National Heroes"" of the country serves as a critique to the twisted side of the road to the nation's independence and political power plays at the time that led up to world war ii"
Quezon,87,12,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,"While there were a few things that irked me (won't spoil), loved Tarog's vision on this"
Quezon,87,13,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,"(Also, Iain Glen aka Jorah Mormont in GOT and Batman in DC's Titans was here"
Quezon,87,14,hirokasuzu,,200.0,ltbx,Ofc I had to watch)
Quezon,88,1,lifescreen,,160.0,ltbx,quezon-osmeña beef is sending me  and andali palang suyuin ni serging
Quezon,89,1,imnotaljeff,,120.0,ltbx,it really drags on the second half
Quezon,90,1,owamarq,,160.0,ltbx,I love how Jerrold Tarog’s vision really shines through in Quezon — even the fictional characters feel like clear expressions of his perspective
Quezon,90,2,owamarq,,160.0,ltbx,You can tell this is a personal project for him as an artist
Quezon,90,3,owamarq,,160.0,ltbx,"Not many directors can be this confident with both visuals and music, especially when they’re the ones actually composing the score too"
Quezon,90,4,owamarq,,160.0,ltbx,"And honestly, Tarog proves George Lucas right: “Sound is half of the picture"
Quezon,90,5,owamarq,,160.0,ltbx,"” Because here, the music doesn’t just support the film — it owns the moment"
Quezon,91,1,chamiboo,,180.0,ltbx,prolly my fav from the bayaniverse
Quezon,92,1,cornflakes111,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon puts on a performance to every single person he deems a threat to his goals
Quezon,92,2,cornflakes111,,180.0,ltbx,He performs so hard that he has doomed the Philippines the moment before it even began
Quezon,93,1,iampopcornboi,,160.0,ltbx,"Jerrold Tarog directs with operatic ambition, closing the Bayaniverse trilogy on a thunderous high note production design flexes hard—every frame is a museum piece, every set a masterclass in period opulence"
Quezon,93,2,iampopcornboi,,160.0,ltbx,"Pong Ignacio’s cinematography paints history with prestige—wide shots, warm tones, and war-room drama that feels Shakespearean Jericho Rosales commands the screen as Quezon—flawed, fiery, and magnetic, with a performance that lingers"
Quezon,93,3,iampopcornboi,,160.0,ltbx,"Supporting cast elevates every scene—no weak links, just ensemble excellence the film blurs reality and dramatization with reckless confidence—some scenes feel more myth than memory pacing wobbles in act two, indulging in grandeur over grit—some sequences feel like prestige filler the final act leans hard into legacy-building, sacrificing ambiguity for cinematic sainthoodfavorite scene: the debate was fire—but Quezon’s first wife showing up"
Quezon,93,4,iampopcornboi,,160.0,ltbx,"That was the plot twist that slappedleast-liked: the transitions between Benjamin Alves and Jericho Rosales as Quezon were jarring—like flipping channels mid-monologueverdict: watch Quezon (2025) for its grand visuals, powerhouse performances, and that debate scene twist that turns history into high drama"
Quezon,94,1,watchedbyclary,,140.0,ltbx,jericho rosales i was not familiar with your game
Quezon,94,2,watchedbyclary,,140.0,ltbx,i kept forgetting i was watching jericho rosales
Quezon,95,1,kassandeffect,,140.0,ltbx,"when i watch history movies about my country's history, the more i realize that i actually know nothing"
Quezon,95,2,kassandeffect,,140.0,ltbx,"only proves how shitty education is in here, even history is not taught properly because powerful people are so afraid of intelligent citizens"
Quezon,95,3,kassandeffect,,140.0,ltbx,"decades later, our country still tolerates corrupt politicians, those who are even worse than Quezon"
Quezon,95,4,kassandeffect,,140.0,ltbx,Philippines is just THAT funny
Quezon,96,1,vmercs,,180.0,ltbx,I didnt expect to enjoy this as much as i did
Quezon,96,2,vmercs,,180.0,ltbx,It had a nice blend of cheekiness and drama into it
Quezon,96,3,vmercs,,180.0,ltbx,Would likely watch again soon (ive been seeing a bunch of quezmeña and yaoi comments around for a while
Quezon,96,4,vmercs,,180.0,ltbx,theyre funnier now after ive watched this lmao)

Quezon,100,1,code_e,,160.0,ltbx,This was such a great movie
Quezon,100,2,code_e,,160.0,ltbx,I’d rewatch it again once it’s on streaming platforms
Quezon,100,3,code_e,,160.0,ltbx,It was really such an eyeopener that Quezon wasn’t really that good as a president even though it was for a good intent
Quezon,100,4,code_e,,160.0,ltbx,You could really only win in politics if you play dirty with the others
Quezon,100,5,code_e,,160.0,ltbx,This movie also made me realize that some facts about Quezon were just glossed over in schools
Quezon,100,6,code_e,,160.0,ltbx,"He was mostly patronized or seen as a good president, but this movie really made me become aware of some of the dirty tricks that he’s played"

Quezon,105,1,thikarii,,180.0,ltbx,cinematography CHEFS KISS
Quezon,105,2,thikarii,,180.0,ltbx,"i like how the movie articulates its way to be a theatrical show telling Quezon's autobiography into quite a reality similar to present, showcasing the political petty fights, betrayal after camaraderie, western validation, and the whole shitshow by the Filipino leaders that the nation bears the burdenna para bang hindi malayo sa whole circus ng gobyerno natin ngayon, sa ating mga presidente, senetaor na naglaglagan sa isa't isa kahit sila lagi magkasamaa"

Quezon,130,3,eddierainman,,140.0,ltbx,And enjoy that it's dense with ideas and trying new things
Quezon,130,4,eddierainman,,140.0,ltbx,It is by far the best movie of this Bayaniverse trilogy
Quezon,130,5,eddierainman,,140.0,ltbx,Just has a bit too many threads it's trying to tie together for it to really stick the landing
Quezon,130,6,eddierainman,,140.0,ltbx,And didn't believe Joven's character arc at all
Quezon,130,7,eddierainman,,140.0,ltbx,he goes from idealistic to disillusioned just because the plot requires him

Quezon,187,2,astrudiswatchin,,120.0,ltbx,I understand why people love it — it’s a biopic political thriller
Quezon,187,3,astrudiswatchin,,120.0,ltbx,But I also understand why his descendants were so against it — he literally had ZERO redeeming factor in the movie

Quezon,187,5,astrudiswatchin,,120.0,ltbx,I would say he plays a hand at why the government is the way it is today
Quezon,187,6,astrudiswatchin,,120.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales did a really great job — from the accent to the slight mannerisms (all of which I am not sure if accurate but it made MLQ more real) I would say tho: the music mixing absolutely SUCKS ASS
Quezon,187,8,astrudiswatchin,,120.0,ltbx,It was so loud at some portions and so hard to hear in some
Quezon,187,9,astrudiswatchin,,120.0,ltbx,"Before we went in, we overheard an older gentleman say that the sound was too loud, and I chalked it up to maybe he’s older that’s why"

Quezon,191,5,cheolieaxc,,180.0,ltbx,rosales nailed it — ang galing niya magpakita ng contrast between quezon’s charm in public and his fear and weakness in private
Quezon,191,6,cheolieaxc,,180.0,ltbx,what’s interesting is how the movie doesn’t glorify him
Quezon,191,7,cheolieaxc,,180.0,ltbx,"instead, it shows how trapo politics actually started — and how quezon himself helped create that system"
Quezon,191,8,cheolieaxc,,180.0,ltbx,"the film reminds us na kahit gaano katalino o karisma ang isang leader, tao pa rin sila — capable of manipulation and lies"
Quezon,191,9,cheolieaxc,,180.0,ltbx,"medyo talky lang minsan, but maybe that’s needed para mas maintindihan ng audience"

Quezon,207,1,vanburg_,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon is ambitious, centered on the dramatic rise and political maneuverings of Manuel L"
Quezon,207,2,vanburg_,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon, bringing into focus both his leadership and the moral complexities that come with power"
Quezon,207,3,vanburg_,,140.0,ltbx,"Directed by Jerrold Tarog and starring Jericho Rosales, the film shows serious craft—period details, strong performances, and a desire to tell a sweeping national story"
Quezon,207,4,vanburg_,,140.0,ltbx,"That said, while the intent is noble and the scale impressive, the film sometimes feels uneven—its pacing can feel heavy with exposition, and certain character arcs or motivations don’t always land with the emotional clarity you'd hope for"
Quezon,207,5,vanburg_,,140.0,ltbx,"It’s a solid historical drama, but it doesn’t always transcend its genre in all moments"
Quezon,208,1,eliesaurr,,100.0,ltbx,The humor of the entire film perfectly depicts Quezon's puppet government
Quezon,208,2,eliesaurr,,100.0,ltbx,The government of 1920s is just the same with the current one
Quezon,208,3,eliesaurr,,100.0,ltbx,Philippines is a circus and we never learn from it as we continue to masturbate for the elites
Quezon,209,1,godoffilm,,120.0,ltbx,"At its core, I found that the movie reflected my frustration in both the spectacle of political power plays, and the intellectual, moral decay of those who now hold the reins of government"
Quezon,209,2,godoffilm,,120.0,ltbx,"Contemporary politicians—our so-called trapos—-have devolved into near-cartoonish figures: one-dimensional villains who plunder public funds, inherit their influence, and contribute little to the nation beyond perpetuating their dynastic entitlement"
Quezon,209,3,godoffilm,,120.0,ltbx,"In comparison to Quezon, whose brilliance was matched by his ambition and corruption in equal measure, today’s leaders lack both vision and complexity"
Quezon,209,4,godoffilm,,120.0,ltbx,"For all his duplicity, Quezon established systems that tangibly benefitted the poor in some ways, and he did grant us some period of independence (though that’s still debated)"
Quezon,209,5,godoffilm,,120.0,ltbx,"One cannot form a fixed opinion of him, for his legacy is both admirable and reprehensible"
Quezon,209,6,godoffilm,,120.0,ltbx,"In this regard, Quezon (2025) mirrors its subject: difficult to pin down, simultaneously compelling and shallow"
Quezon,209,7,godoffilm,,120.0,ltbx,"The film dramatizes power and corruption effectively, and inevitably tugs at the viewer’s frustration given the state of current politics"
Quezon,209,8,godoffilm,,120.0,ltbx,"Yet it often flattens the historical depth of Quezon’s time, reducing the struggle for independence and the weight of colonial subjugation into a tale of political maneuvering"
Quezon,209,9,godoffilm,,120.0,ltbx,"The controversy surrounding Quezon’s grandson’s reaction at the film’s premiere only reinforces the persistence of the Great Man myth, the impulse to sanctify flawed figures rather than confront their contradictions"
Quezon,209,10,godoffilm,,120.0,ltbx,"While the Bayaniverse in general deconstructs this narrative, I think Quezon (2025) only partially succeeds"
Quezon,209,11,godoffilm,,120.0,ltbx,"What emerges instead is a reflection of both the man and the nation: brilliant in flashes, compromised in execution, and perpetually caught between reverence and disillusionment"

Quezon,210,2,jolsngshawblvd,,200.0,ltbx,"the writing, camerawork, and narrative framing was so well done"
Quezon,210,3,jolsngshawblvd,,200.0,ltbx,"the exploration of quezon's character and his relationship with the fictional parts of the story fit together really well, and it blurs the lines between truth and fiction which is why i would categorize this film as less of a historically accurate documentary film, but more of a satirical dark comedy drama"

Quezon,212,3,gabrioso,,180.0,ltbx,"It was well-executed, and its message was crystal clear- a bridge between the past and the present"
Quezon,212,4,gabrioso,,180.0,ltbx,"While watching, you can't help but recall the things happening in our country now"
Quezon,212,5,gabrioso,,180.0,ltbx,It's a film that needs to be seen by many with open minds
Quezon,212,6,gabrioso,,180.0,ltbx,It is both heartbreaking and thought-provoking
Quezon,212,7,gabrioso,,180.0,ltbx,"Showing how far people can go in the pursuit of power, and how far we can go to achieve independencia"

Quezon,218,2,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,This movie feels like both an ending and a beginning
Quezon,218,3,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,"For me, Quezon isn’t “bayani enough” to close this trilogy; he’s more like the start of what could be a pangulo-verse"
Quezon,218,4,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,Quezon is a master player in politics
Quezon,218,5,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,The appointment game scene is one of my favorites because it shows how Quezon skillfully maneuvers people and the government itself
Quezon,218,6,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,"His ambition, driven by greed and power, is disturbing, yet Jericho Rosales portrayed it so convincingly that I couldn’t look away"
Quezon,218,8,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,"Quezon is selfish and trapo, and that’s what makes him believable"
Quezon,218,9,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,"He mirrors the very kind of politics we see today, shifting how leadership and power are perceived in our system"
Quezon,218,10,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,I also liked how Joven became aware of what was really happening
Quezon,218,11,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,He refused to be swayed again and stood firm in what he believed in
Quezon,218,12,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,The two-hour film gave justice to how this trilogy ends
Quezon,218,13,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,My favorite part is when Quezon said that being a hero is all about perception
Quezon,218,14,klaued,,200.0,ltbx,That line sums up the whole point of the movie: that history and heroism depend on how we choose to see them and we create heroes in our likeness

Quezon,221,4,hythamkns,,140.0,ltbx,"Clever and gripping, Jericho Rosales gives a larger than life portrayal of MLQ"
Quezon,221,5,hythamkns,,140.0,ltbx,Don't love how the movie turns Wood into a tired old man who just wants to be done with the mess that is the Philippines
Quezon,221,6,hythamkns,,140.0,ltbx,"It almost feels white man's burden-y, even worse when the Bud Dajo Massacre that he led is relegated to a throwaway line at the beginning then never mentioned again"
Quezon,221,7,hythamkns,,140.0,ltbx,"As an analysis of Quezon the man and the long, long line of trapos that (figuratively) descend from him, it's above average"
Quezon,221,8,hythamkns,,140.0,ltbx,"Not the ending though, where it feels like the writers forgot to weave in the patronage politics and capitalism commentary and threw it all in while they still could"
Quezon,221,9,hythamkns,,140.0,ltbx,"To end, Quezmeña real"

Quezon,246,3,kaiser_indat,,200.0,ltbx,"Instead, it left me still and uncertain, as if it reached into what I believed and rearranged it"
Quezon,246,4,kaiser_indat,,200.0,ltbx,It has been a long time since a film made me feel this kind of quiet turmoil
Quezon,246,5,kaiser_indat,,200.0,ltbx,I have always seen Quezon as one of the strongest figures in our history
Quezon,246,6,kaiser_indat,,200.0,ltbx,"I saw him as a leader who carried both intellect and heart, a man who stood for what the Filipino could be"

Quezon,246,11,kaiser_indat,,200.0,ltbx,"It felt honest in its discomfort, as if the film was reminding me that greatness is never pure and that power often leaves scars no one else can see"
Quezon,246,12,kaiser_indat,,200.0,ltbx,"I kept trying to defend him in my mind, to separate the man from the portrayal, but I realized that was the experience the film wanted me to have"
Quezon,246,13,kaiser_indat,,200.0,ltbx,It wanted me to struggle with the idea of Quezon himself

Quezon,249,2,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,all throughout he’s just this cunning and ruthless asshole who happens to be the president and a senate president before that
Quezon,249,3,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,we’ve seen countless pieces of media na pinapakita mabubuti niyang ginawa at niroromanticize buhay niya so it was very refreshing to see jericho’s version of quezon na masama ugali all throughout yet he never came across as shallow and one note
Quezon,249,4,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,"no art is meant to be isolated in vacuum so by placing it with another like the quezon movie prior to this gives you a fuller picture of who quezon is, even when theyre not entirely accurate"
Quezon,249,5,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,- was taken aback by how playful and satirical the movie’s tone was considering that it’s supposed to conclude the bayaniverse trilogy
Quezon,249,7,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,fave ko yung silent movie scenes grabe kuhang kuha yung blocking acting score at makeup
Quezon,249,8,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,also works really well as a narrative device and cleverly points out how ridiculous quezon can be

Quezon,249,11,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,gets na this is a movie about larger than life historical figures but the sakdalistas were popular enough to win a seat in the congress so bakit wala sila sa movie
Quezon,249,12,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,the whole movie is structured around who quezon is going up against at different points in his political career so it would’ve been the perfect opportunity to explore the perspective of the masses and could have made the ending/message stronger but ok whatever
Quezon,249,13,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,including the sakdalistas in the story could’ve shown a different side of quezon—one that was insecure enough to actually sabotage figures who are way less powerful than him even when he was already the commonwealth president- why portray filipinos as ignorant/unlearned when it comes to independence
Quezon,249,14,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,that was the only time na may representation ang ordinaryong pilipino na nagsisilbi ring stand in for the audience tapos in that scene they chose to depict filipinos as mangmang na hindi alam kung ano pinaglalaban nila e kung tutuusin sila na nga yung nakarealize early on that independence should be achieved immediately hindi katulad ng filipino elite noon na kumapit pa rin sa colonial forces and chose delayed independence because they didnt wanna lose their privileges yet - not enough hate for the other key players
Quezon,249,15,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,not enough hate for aguinaldo (but its okay bc we have luna movie and goyo movie to compensate for the lack of aguinaldo hate) but what bothers me the most is that there’s not enough hate for wood
Quezon,249,16,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,"leonard wood is depicted as this diplomatic and level headed guy who just wants to do his job so he can go home even though historical accounts say otherwise because he’s anti filipino, and orchestrated the massacre in bud dajo, etc"
Quezon,249,17,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,"at the end of the day, mananakop siya na ang tingin sa mga pilipino ay mangmang na kailangan ng colonial intervention"
Quezon,249,18,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,ang mga amerikano din naman ang naginstitutionalize ng padrino system and the filipino elite just took advantage of it so why are they making it seem that quezon was the one who established such system
Quezon,249,19,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,"the issue isn’t about the movie omitting or adding events for creative purposes (it's a movie after all), the problem lies with the larger picture it ends up painting by taking those liberties and to me it just reeks american propaganda and i dont think the movie is aware of that"
Quezon,249,20,leviereviews,,120.0,ltbx,"i know this is about quezon, i know this is a satire, pero kailangan ba si quezon lang yung ivivillainize/satirize"

Quezon,285,3,aki_natopls,,120.0,ltbx,"Tho I can't think of better ways atm, but I believe there's something that be improved sa treatment or how the narrative was delivered"
Quezon,285,4,aki_natopls,,120.0,ltbx,"For a 2-hour film with heavy historical information, sana there's a way na mas may element of anticipation"
Quezon,285,5,aki_natopls,,120.0,ltbx,"But gets, it's really hard to work with these types of materials that must be grounded in research"
Quezon,285,6,aki_natopls,,120.0,ltbx,"Overall, kudos"
Quezon,285,7,aki_natopls,,120.0,ltbx,I think this is a perfect material to at least counter the basic education teachings - always glorifying the presidents and never practicing critical thinking

Quezon,292,1,ni3n,,40.0,ltbx,did not enjoy this movie at all because of jericho rosales' squeaky manuel quezon voice (totally exlusive of whether it was a good historical depiction or not)might need to rewatch this in like 4 years time
Quezon,293,1,hyunmatcha,,180.0,ltbx,this casting is absolutely perfect
Quezon,293,2,hyunmatcha,,180.0,ltbx,"idk about you all, but I am forever biased with historical films, especially those featuring well-known figures who remind us of the people and events that helped shape the ph into what it is today"
Quezon,293,3,hyunmatcha,,180.0,ltbx,"the timing of this film is spot-on too, focusing on how it subtly mirrors issues of poor governance + goddamn, jericho rosales portrayed queson so incredibly well that I completely forgot that it was him on the screen"
Quezon,293,4,hyunmatcha,,180.0,ltbx,he's the loml

Quezon,296,1,rcze,,180.0,ltbx,"lots to unpack here, but all I can say is that this was overall a great watch mostly for how the story was told"
Quezon,296,2,rcze,,180.0,ltbx,using a film-within-a-film approach was such an interesting way to show/tell historic events in the Philippines & kudos to the ones who made it possible
Quezon,296,3,rcze,,180.0,ltbx,it definitely kept me engaged throughout along with the plot itself ofc
Quezon,296,4,rcze,,180.0,ltbx,yes the bodabil-like scenes appearing from time to time are very much appreciated by me lol
Quezon,297,1,jillminusjack,,200.0,ltbx,The message is no leader is clean especially in the ph but that doesn’t mean we should stop calling them out and taking action
Quezon,297,2,jillminusjack,,200.0,ltbx,"May halong comedy, caught off guard sa seconds exposure ni cong"
Quezon,298,1,im_a_mess,,200.0,ltbx,casey x sergie sinaunang doomed toxic yaoiloved this so much as a peryodista freshie with three history classes
Quezon,299,1,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,"Ang panonood ng ""Quezon"" ay parehong pakiramdam ng pakikinig sa isang kakilalang naglalarawan sa isang taong nakadaumpalad mo na, ngunit hindi pa lubos na nakikilala"
Quezon,299,2,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,"Kaya matapos makinig sa mga kuwento, may responsibilidad na kilalanin pa nang husto ang taong iyon sa kung anumang layuning mahalaga para sa iyo"
Quezon,299,3,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,Ang panganib lang dito ay kung paano tatanggapin ng nakinig: maniniwala agad-agad o aalamin muna ang kabuuang konteksto
Quezon,299,4,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,"Sa Araling Panlipunan/Sibika, limitado ang pagpapakilala kay Quezon"
Quezon,299,5,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,"Kaya kung gagamitin itong pangunahing materyal ng DepEd at literal na bibigyang-interpretasyon, mayroong tendensiyang matuon sa ""sensationalism"" ang talakayan"
Quezon,299,6,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,"Ngunit gayundin, magandang ipinakita ang kabuuang karakterisasyon ni Quezon at kung paano siya naging biktima rin ng sistema ng politika sa panahon ng pananakop ng mga Amerikano"
Quezon,299,7,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,"Gayunpaman, sa personal kong opinyon, nakulangan ako sa pagpapakita kung paano tinawid ni Quezon ang grey areas--sa pelikula, tumatawid lamang si Quezon sa itim o sa puti"
Quezon,299,8,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,"Kung maipakikita sana ang bigat ng pagkaipit sa sistema at pagpili na lamang sa ""lesser evil"", mas naging balanse at nagkaroon ng dagdag na layers ang kaniyang tauhan"
Quezon,299,9,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,Nakakabahala rin ang idea na mula pa noon ay umiiral na ang parehong maruruming taktika sa politika
Quezon,299,10,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,Na parang ang pelikula ay direktang salamin ng kasalukuyang lagay ng politika sa bansa
Quezon,299,11,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,Super like: Pagganap ni Jericho at ang acting ensemble
Quezon,299,12,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,Karakter ni Nadia
Quezon,299,13,kontradiksiyon,,140.0,ltbx,"(Napaisip tuloy ako if may 2nd version itong pelikula, charot"
Quezon,300,1,tatot,,200.0,ltbx,SOOOO good
Quezon,300,2,tatot,,200.0,ltbx,"the gossip-speak and exaggerated press language is exactly the form of storytelling i love, and personally how i think philippine history should be told"
Quezon,300,3,tatot,,200.0,ltbx,this is exactly how i envision noli me tangere to be translated into film
Quezon,300,4,tatot,,200.0,ltbx,"i also liked that the direction of the film is theatrical, to show the nature of politics as a performance (""room where it happens"" type of)"
Quezon,300,5,tatot,,200.0,ltbx,also: they're obviously in love
Quezon,301,1,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"Honestly before watching the film I got a bit skeptical, not because of the relative's reaction rather, of how his death is going to be depicted - as most stories of ""Bayani"" ends with an abrupt bullet or a machete to the body (about 50 times)"
Quezon,301,2,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,I vividly remember reading that he once gave his SONA in a hospital bed in Washington DC because he was fighting TB
Quezon,301,3,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"While he often had that shiny 20-peso bill image to him, reading books like Nick Joaquin's A Question of Heroes (which this film takes inspiration) suggests a more open to interpretation viewpoint of the politician-statesman"
Quezon,301,4,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"You can write a persuasive essay about it, honestly, and your highschool AP teacher would probably applaud you by choosing either depictions and look at the complexities of the human character and the political environment he had to deal with"
Quezon,301,5,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"Going back to the ending though, you can very much understand the backlash because it really leaned into the creative side of the narrative"
Quezon,301,6,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"But I kinda like it because its a fun thought to have; if MLQ didnt get sick, what would he have done more as his legacy"
Quezon,301,7,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"Depicted as the savvy, charming, trickster of a politician playing ""the game of politics"" and always trying to get the upper hand on people, I'd like to think that he would've been similar to how Lee Kuan Yew did for Singapore"
Quezon,301,8,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"Similar in character in a lot of ways and tickling his way to almost authoritarian (competitive authoritarianism, that is)"
Quezon,301,9,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,At least with the way how the film depicted it
Quezon,301,10,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"""I am the Philippines"" is definitely a bold line to say, but probably not too far off"
Quezon,301,11,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"And the line about ""Quezon may not have invented the game, but he sure damn played it well"" describes the character perfectly"
Quezon,301,12,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"The film is actually the commentary of Jerold Tarog, the director"
Quezon,301,13,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,He questions Manolo's morality and character because that's how we all should look at historical figures
Quezon,301,14,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"I remember when Luna came out, everyone was preaching his machismo, especially at the height of Dutertismo"
Quezon,301,15,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"But Tarog probably saw the bad effects of the film and tell us: ""Hey, don't worship our heroes"
Quezon,301,16,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,""" Funny how the film mocks the audience for incorporating the silent film-slide show scenes at points, as if they're trying to tell you ""this is how most people probably would've made this film: prim, proper, textbook-like, 'here's all the key highlights of his life and the good he's done, and then he died"
Quezon,301,17,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,""" Rather, they chose to depict that complex, imperfect, flawed character that I would've been more interested in watching"
Quezon,301,18,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,He's never meant to be seen as a martyr
Quezon,301,19,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"He's a historical figure, a real person"
Quezon,301,20,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,Is it 100% accurate
Quezon,301,21,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"I don't know, ask your history teacher"
Quezon,301,22,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,Was it fun to watch
Quezon,301,23,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,Was the acting great
Quezon,301,24,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"More importantly, was the film good"
Quezon,301,25,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,All points to: Yes
Quezon,301,26,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,Yes it was
Quezon,301,27,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,Last note: MLQ III is right
Quezon,301,28,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,"The film is a horror story about corruption of power, the state of politics today, and the trajectory of Philippine politics from that point on"
Quezon,301,29,pennandpapers,,140.0,ltbx,Makes my arm hair stand up
Quezon,302,1,sof1asaw,,140.0,ltbx,he’s so bad but he does it so well

Quezon,306,3,virtually_thea,,180.0,ltbx,pero wala pa ring bayani sa kuwentong ‘to
Quezon,306,4,virtually_thea,,180.0,ltbx,"pero dito ko nakita ang kapangyarihan ng pelikula, lalo na ng storytelling: ang pagbukas ng Pandora’s box (from the apo’s words) at pagsisimula ng makabuluhan at may patutunguhang mga diskusyon—‘di na bale kung ito ang katotohanang gusto nating panigan o ang katotohanang hindi natin inaasahan"
Quezon,307,1,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,the streets said it was old man yaoi
Quezon,307,2,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,i was still not prepared for how much it WAS old man yaoi*
Quezon,307,4,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,incredible conclusion to the bayaniverse and perhaps the most emblematic of the entire ethos of the trilogy
Quezon,307,5,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,lowkey a movie about movies and the power of movies and i love that
Quezon,307,6,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,powerhouse performance from jericho rosales

Quezon,307,9,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,the manipulate mansplain manwhore of it all as he leverages friendships and charisma that he puts on with the same ease as one of his impeccably styled suits (bc the suits were incredible)
Quezon,307,10,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,"the scene where he plays his favorite game ""appointments"""
Quezon,307,11,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,during lq nila ni serging

Quezon,307,13,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,my favorite visual moment in the movie bc it literally looks like a game
Quezon,307,14,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,bc it is just a game to him

Quezon,307,19,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,"i really like the cutting interplay of the campaign films he commissioned vs the ""reality"" of the movie"
Quezon,307,20,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,is it perhaps heavyhanded and kinda spoonfeeding the audience
Quezon,307,22,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,but frankly the responses to the previous bayaniverse movies warrant that and they were never subtle in what they were trying to talk about anyway
Quezon,307,23,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,mon confiado ate and left no crumbs truly
Quezon,307,24,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,every performance was just really good
Quezon,307,25,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,delighted at the centrality of nadia's character actually
Quezon,307,26,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,very fun
Quezon,307,27,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,arron villaflor and cris villanueva as joven were wonderful
Quezon,307,28,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,"to see how far the naive journalist innocently interviewing heneral luna has come felt very full circle, and as the audience stand in, very poignant"
Quezon,307,29,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,to keep getting let down by our image of the Great (Good) Man who will Definitely solve all our problems this time and yet still fall prey to its allure only to once again get disillusioned and realize the truth too late
Quezon,307,30,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,dare i say there are few things more filipino than that
Quezon,307,31,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,kaya siguro gagalet yung apo ni quezon eh
Quezon,307,32,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,bc the parallels drawn to the current shitshow in the government aren't subtle and perhaps they're unflattering for someone historically revered as a hero but isnt that literally the point of the movies
Quezon,307,33,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,to bring some nuance and humanity to the flat heroic figures of history
Quezon,307,34,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,is art not meant to make us question
Quezon,307,35,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,to provoke even a crumb of critical thought
Quezon,307,36,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,something we're in dire need of these days
Quezon,307,37,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,quezon didn't invent the game but he did master it
Quezon,307,38,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,and perhaps yung pinakaambag nya sa current state of ph politics is that he realized that history is written by the winners
Quezon,307,39,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,and sometimes all that means is some good framing
Quezon,307,40,routofpretty,,180.0,ltbx,"ika nga nya: ""ang pagkabayani"

Quezon,308,2,dumpypapi,,160.0,ltbx,"and, i am not complaining"
Quezon,308,3,dumpypapi,,160.0,ltbx,the message of this movie is deeper than just depicting what truly happened during quezon's time
Quezon,308,4,dumpypapi,,160.0,ltbx,this film told us the implications of depicting history by actually contradicting the first film in its own universe (aguinaldo-luna)
Quezon,308,5,dumpypapi,,160.0,ltbx,and there's no better time to exhibit how easy it is to distort history than now–when people are trying to change what happened both 50 years ago (martial law) and less than 10 years ago (EJK)
Quezon,308,6,dumpypapi,,160.0,ltbx,"now for my unorganized thoughts:- holy trinity of 21st century filipino movie actors: joross gamboa, ketchup eusebio, & jojit lorenzo (let's ignore first that this guy is in batang quiapo, im talking abt films here)- jericho rosales wala putangina ang galing- i think romnick sarmienta's lines could be improved - these films show us how eurocentric beauty standards are nothing but bs- was that a valid crashout by the quezon descendant"
Quezon,308,7,dumpypapi,,160.0,ltbx,they probably have a point
Quezon,308,8,dumpypapi,,160.0,ltbx,"but, it goes back to the film's central message"

Quezon,324,1,finalskilledme,,160.0,ltbx,fascinating film
Quezon,324,2,finalskilledme,,160.0,ltbx,clear eyed on its mission on dissecting how we got here and how we're still stuck here but I don't really think it does enough to condemn the actual system (capitalism and colonialism) that allows for the rise of populists
Quezon,324,3,finalskilledme,,160.0,ltbx,"What I got most from this is I think Tarog is frustrated by the success of Luna and how it led us even just a tiny bit to electing the kind of person he warns us with in this film (TWICE IN A ROW, this god forsaken country man) given how much the framing device of this is about an alternate cut of what are essentially propaganda films"
Quezon,324,4,finalskilledme,,160.0,ltbx,I think these films are really about the disillusionment of a man may it be Joven or Tarog himself in the Filipino project while I think it's valid (and I do share the sentiment a lot of the time) I don't really know if it's the sentiment we need in this moment considering his ideals about reviving the idea of national mythmaking through Philippine cinema
Quezon,324,5,finalskilledme,,160.0,ltbx,"I hope people take something else from here other than, oh all politicians are the same and it is what it is, I hope they at least realize that the powers that be are fallible (Quezon eventually runs out of time) and that we see through their bullshit and that populists are really fucking bad for ""freedom"" and that we should get rid of them by hook or by crook although the film doesn't really go there because history didn't go there"
Quezon,324,6,finalskilledme,,160.0,ltbx,Overall it's fascinating stuff
Quezon,324,7,finalskilledme,,160.0,ltbx,"Really loved how propulsive his direction and editing are, the energy of this thing is just really great"
Quezon,324,8,finalskilledme,,160.0,ltbx,The performances are impeccable and I didn't know Rosales had something like this in him
Quezon,325,1,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,Possibly one of my most engaging watches this year
Quezon,325,2,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,"Instead of picking up from where Goyo and Heneral Luna left off, Quezon abandons the tragic hero's tale of its predecessors and instead explores, for lack of a better word, its titular character's descent into madness and depravity"
Quezon,325,3,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,It's less a biopic and more of a character study that relishes in the drama of its narrative without needing to wink and nudge at the viewer
Quezon,325,4,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,"There's a lot of standout performances here, but Iain Glen, Romnick Sarmiento, and Jericho Rosales really stand head and shoulders above the rest in a very talented cast"
Quezon,325,5,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,Glen and Sarmiento especially bring a lot to their characters' tables with microexpressions that elevate already stellar performances
Quezon,325,6,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,Sarmiento's facial expressions by themselves are strong enough to constitute dialogue
Quezon,325,7,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,"Rosales, meanwhile, really puts the larger-than-life aspects of the titular character at the forefront of his performance and just exudes the kind of charisma you would expect a man like Quezon to have"
Quezon,325,8,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,"As much as I would've liked to see what TJ Trinidad would've done with the role had he not been replaced, it's hard to see how anyone other than Rosales was the best choice"
Quezon,325,9,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,"On top of that, the movie pulls very little back in the way of punches"
Quezon,325,10,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,Very few characters are portrayed in a positive manner and it's the clashes between these strong personalities that make this picture so interesting to me
Quezon,325,11,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,"The film also uses these clashes as a Trojan horse for some scathing social commentary that, while on-the-nose, hardly ever crosses the line of being egregious or preachy"
Quezon,325,12,_findrafa,,160.0,ltbx,"The visual and stylistic homages to Fritz Lang's works, especially, were the cherry on top for me"
Quezon,326,1,claiirdelune,,160.0,ltbx,romnick sarmenta if u still lived near us i would have commissioned you to make yaoi art

Quezon,328,3,alimarii,,160.0,ltbx,really makes you reflect about the current politics as you watch also hanggang ngayon naaalala ko pa rin yung mga transition between nadia's film to the actual film grabe so geniusss
Quezon,329,1,scorpiobride,,200.0,ltbx,Old man yaoi excellence…
Quezon,330,1,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s been a big year for Philippine cinema, and what could make it even bigger than a film about politics and power"
Quezon,330,2,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon dives deep into Manuel L
Quezon,330,3,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon — his legacy, his triumphs, and all his mess and contradictions"
Quezon,330,4,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,"The film portrays him as charming and eloquent, a political game player, and manipulative at times — without ever romanticizing him"
Quezon,330,5,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,It’s insane how the political landscape back then mirrors so much of what we still see today
Quezon,330,6,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,The film serves as a fascinating tribute to one of the country’s most dominant and complex figures
Quezon,330,7,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,The cinematography and editing are stunning
Quezon,330,8,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,It's an ambitious step forward for Philippine cinema and a huge achievement in craft
Quezon,330,9,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,"The script, dialogue, and even the incorporation of silent film techniques beautifully capture the era"
Quezon,330,10,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,The acting is top-notch
Quezon,330,11,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales, Romnick Sarmenta, and Mon Confiado delivered powerful performances"
Quezon,330,12,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,"Overall, Quezon offers a sharp, compelling glimpse into the man behind the myth while holding a mirror to our present-day politics"
Quezon,330,13,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s timely, daring, and deeply resonant"
Quezon,330,14,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,People really need to see this
Quezon,330,15,lorenmilton,,180.0,ltbx,What a great film
Quezon,331,1,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"This film for me is such a refresher because unlike the previous films about MLQ, it challenges the pedestal that he has been put on, which I believe is essential when we discuss important figures in our history"
Quezon,331,2,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,I think a lot of us (myself included) often fall into the trap of patronizing our heroes to the point that we romanticize them through the legacies that they have built
Quezon,331,3,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"This was very much true for me, specifically with Heneral Luna (Naalala ko grabe yung galit ko kay Aguinaldo nung una kong napanood yung Heneral Luna na movie hahaha)"
Quezon,331,4,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"While some may see this film as overtly negative and borderline slanderous against MLQ, I see it as a way to challenge the longstanding beliefs and notions regarding him"
Quezon,331,5,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"It pushes people to rethink our history, to be more critical, and to ask questions about what really happened in the past"
Quezon,331,6,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"And of course, the biggest elephant of them all is the connection between the past and the present"
Quezon,331,7,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,This is not just a historical film; it is also a social commentary about the current political climate we have right now
Quezon,331,8,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,We can make the analogy of how the things from the past never really changed up to the present day
Quezon,331,9,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"It merely evolved, adapted, and thrived"
Quezon,331,10,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,It persisted because the people in power willed it so
Quezon,331,11,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"Going back to the film, we can also see how the concept utang na loob played a big part in ultimately shaping MLQ’s politicking"
Quezon,331,12,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"How it was first used on him and eventually, how he used this to take the reigns of our country"
Quezon,331,13,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"“You either die young as a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain"
Quezon,331,14,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"”In essence, MLQ wouldn’t have survived that long in the landscape of Philippine politics had he not conformed to the games being played on the floors of its administration"
Quezon,331,15,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"His good intentions, as genuine as it might have been when he first started, nevertheless was inevitably consumed by the environment he was in"
Quezon,331,16,juls_via,,160.0,ltbx,"Truly, it was a world of “eat or be eaten”"

Quezon,334,4,lysiumns,,140.0,ltbx,"nothing inaccurate about this movie, but quezon's selfish & power-hungry character was not granted empathy given his absurd context"
Quezon,334,5,lysiumns,,140.0,ltbx,"but to be fair, they warned us about the power of film"
Quezon,335,1,onionstory,,160.0,ltbx,"Captivating, surprisingly funny, and relevant to the Philippines’ current political climate"
Quezon,335,2,onionstory,,160.0,ltbx,Everything from the production design to the stellar performances all come together to make a movie that keeps one captivated from start to finish
Quezon,335,3,onionstory,,160.0,ltbx,"And speaking of performances, Jericho Rosales is the definite highlight as he perfectly captures the quirks and mannerisms of the real Quezon and is able to portray a wonderfully complex man who craves for power but nevertheless loves his country"
Quezon,335,4,onionstory,,160.0,ltbx,My only real criticisms of this movie are how difficult it can be to separate fact from fiction and its portrayal of Quezon which can sometimes skew a bit too much on the negative side
Quezon,336,1,joannegotladera,,180.0,ltbx,I get the hype with Jericho Rosales’ acting it was amazing
Quezon,336,2,joannegotladera,,180.0,ltbx,The cast was great and the pacing was perfect
Quezon,336,3,joannegotladera,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon as a character is incredibly annoying and lovable at the same time I end up rooting for him but also waiting for his downfall
Quezon,336,4,joannegotladera,,180.0,ltbx,The energy and the character felt like a good balance between the first 2 movies (Luna and Goyo)
Quezon,336,5,joannegotladera,,180.0,ltbx,Just wished there was a little more to the ending
Quezon,337,1,shmanelle,,,ltbx,Just watch my boyfriend's Tiktok commentary

Quezon,340,2,jofuxie,,160.0,ltbx,"""A bit confused with the overall structure of how Quezon's life was narrated with this film"
Quezon,340,3,jofuxie,,160.0,ltbx,"But kudos to the improvement of cinematography all throughout the ""Bayani-verse"", this has definitely had more oomph and a more modern visual style"
Quezon,340,4,jofuxie,,160.0,ltbx,"As for the story-telling, they were a bit of skips or creative juggling on the timelines, some might have been too fast for the viewers to understand or follow through"
Quezon,340,5,jofuxie,,160.0,ltbx,I do like how some of the issues or social commentary here relates to what we are now facing in the current day politics of the Philippines
Quezon,340,6,jofuxie,,160.0,ltbx,What I also like is that they added these cut parts of silent-film era of adding pieces to the puzzle of how Quezon raised to power during his time
Quezon,340,7,jofuxie,,160.0,ltbx,"The technique they used is spot on, on how old films were shown"
Quezon,341,1,replies88,,200.0,ltbx,"got baited by old man yaoi, now i’m pissed off BTW this has such good cinematography"

Quezon,345,1,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"2nd time watching this, just a day after the first time"
Quezon,345,2,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"First time was my college org Alay Ni Ignacio’s block screening, where Mon Confiado and Benjamin Alves showed up to speak briefly after the film"
Quezon,345,3,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,Second time was with my girlfriend who missed the block screening due to prior commitments but still wanted to see the film on its first weekend
Quezon,345,4,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,No man watches the same film twice for he is not the same man and it’s not the same film
Quezon,345,5,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,Actually it was pretty much the same film given that I had just seen it but the first watch doesn’t count if your girlfriend wants to watch the movie with you

Quezon,347,2,duppy,,160.0,ltbx,I loved the timing and editing especially when they were used to play up the comedy or the tension
Quezon,347,3,duppy,,160.0,ltbx,The non-linear storytelling was kinda confusing but that might be a skill issue; everything DID end up making more sense in the end
Quezon,347,4,duppy,,160.0,ltbx,I really admire the casting for these films
Quezon,347,5,duppy,,160.0,ltbx,Gets ko na kung bakit crush ng dati naming kasambahay si Jericho Rosales
Quezon,347,6,duppy,,160.0,ltbx,Mon Confiado as Emilio Aguinaldo is just SO good
Quezon,347,7,duppy,,160.0,ltbx,The previous films in this series showed Aguinaldo for the traitor that he was but then this movie almost had me sympathizing with him damn
Quezon,347,8,duppy,,160.0,ltbx,"Until this movie, I only ever knew Quezon as the mukha sa P20, yung ama ng wikang pambansa, namatay dahil sa TB"
Quezon,347,9,duppy,,160.0,ltbx,"But this movie, which his grandson got angry over, showed a new side of Quezon, or rather many sides as a trapo and balimbing"
Quezon,347,10,duppy,,160.0,ltbx,"I thought this might be the last in this series, so I'm holding out hope for Magsaysay"
Quezon,347,11,duppy,,160.0,ltbx,"Joven Hernando, you poor and brave jaded journalist"

Quezon,348,2,sethcohen1984,,160.0,ltbx,It's whimsical and Vaudevillian approach to the narrative makes the subject matter more easy to digest without losing it's weight
Quezon,349,1,dutchmill,,160.0,ltbx,"a project film that had so much thought put into it trying to condense as much message and allegory as much as possible, with the constraint of budget, the mellow heart of Filipinos and state of film industry, and the Philippines in general"
Quezon,349,2,dutchmill,,160.0,ltbx,"It's colorful when it needs to be, and gut-puches you at the right times"

Quezon,366,4,quark,,,ltbx,"The script wasn’t as funny as it turned out to be on the screen, and kudos to Jerrold for seeing our government for the farce it is"
Quezon,366,5,quark,,,ltbx,"Seeing Jericho play Quezon initially felt put on, but by the end you believe he’s the living, breathing embodiment of the 50 peso bill"

Quezon,366,11,quark,,,ltbx,"It’s a painful portrayal, and will make you feel bad about all his shenanigans from the prior two films"
Quezon,366,12,quark,,,ltbx,"End of the day I’m just grateful that during this time, what feels like such a low point for Philippine cinema, Jerrold continues to create his films about our flawed history, filled with stories of deluded strongmen, inexperienced boy generals and manipulative power players"
Quezon,366,13,quark,,,ltbx,"He holds a mirror to our society that most people in power, heroes’ grandchildren included, don’t want to see"
Quezon,366,14,quark,,,ltbx,"But when Leonard Wood talks about politicians using diplomatic trips as an excuse for family vacations and Filipinos not ready for independence with their infighting and greed, everything feels so eerily timely"

Quezon,389,1,aywrydri,,140.0,ltbx,"Unlike Heneral Luna and Goyo, Quezon did not show any form of physical violence; rather, it portrayed violence through the use of words"
Quezon,389,2,aywrydri,,140.0,ltbx,"Storytelling-wise, it was quite okay for me, but I think there are a lot of areas that could be improved"
Quezon,389,3,aywrydri,,140.0,ltbx,"As someone who doesn’t appreciate slow-paced movies, Quezon felt really boring to me at the beginning"
Quezon,389,4,aywrydri,,140.0,ltbx,"Nadia’s role as a storyteller throughout the film also felt somewhat messy—but then again, it allows the audience to form their own opinions and perspectives on the narratives and realities she presented during Quezon’s term"
Quezon,389,5,aywrydri,,140.0,ltbx,"In both Heneral Luna and Goyo, Joven served as a symbol of youth—the hopeful defender of our country’s future and independence"
Quezon,389,6,aywrydri,,140.0,ltbx,"In Quezon, however, he symbolized how people might abandon their morals because of the selective facts presented to them—facts that politicians carefully curate for their own benefit"
Quezon,389,7,aywrydri,,140.0,ltbx,"Joven still represented hope for the Philippines, because even though he strayed from the beliefs he once fought for, he eventually came to understand how manipulative and power-hungry politicians can be"
Quezon,389,8,aywrydri,,140.0,ltbx,"This idea was further emphasized by Miguel Laureano’s retirement, which symbolized the shift in political climate and the changing perception of the masses"
Quezon,389,9,aywrydri,,140.0,ltbx,The movie reflected the bitter reality of our current political state—it mirrored how Filipinos tend to be selective about what kinds of change and movement they are willing to support
Quezon,389,10,aywrydri,,140.0,ltbx,"As we moved on from Quezon’s term, we should have experienced growth and improvement, yet we did not"
Quezon,389,11,aywrydri,,140.0,ltbx,"The film illustrated how our political system remains trapped in a constant loop, where we continue to vote for and campaign for politicians who ultimately serve Western interests rather than our own"
Quezon,390,1,ejt03,,120.0,ltbx,The controversy over this film has been severely overblown
Quezon,390,2,ejt03,,120.0,ltbx,"Yes, it is satire"
Quezon,390,3,ejt03,,120.0,ltbx,"And just because it is, doesn’t mean it’s a joke that we can’t take seriously"
Quezon,390,4,ejt03,,120.0,ltbx,"I thought it was pretty good, it’s very well made with a really good performance by Jericho Rosales"
Quezon,390,5,ejt03,,120.0,ltbx,My main issue is the character of Joven and his daughter
Quezon,390,6,ejt03,,120.0,ltbx,The use of a fictional journalist is interesting but I feel like him being so involved in the story was too much
Quezon,390,7,ejt03,,120.0,ltbx,I would've preferred him being more like a fly on the wall than being directly a part of the story

Quezon,392,1,ikkatots,,160.0,ltbx,"word vomit af but in as much as it shouldn’t be, quezon treated the government like a business"
Quezon,392,2,ikkatots,,160.0,ltbx,"he was a salesman, and “independence” was his product"
Quezon,392,3,ikkatots,,160.0,ltbx,"he sold it well—everyone knew the word, but it didn’t matter if the people knew what it meant"
Quezon,392,4,ikkatots,,160.0,ltbx,i don’t even know if quezon could even fully grasp what independence should look like
Quezon,392,5,ikkatots,,160.0,ltbx,"but oh well ang independencia ay masarap daw kainin, ika nga nila :)) also love the internal conflict of sticking to your principles vs being self-righteous and hypocritical,, really makes you reflect"

Quezon,395,2,picheowin,,160.0,ltbx,"ipinakita mo kung gaano kadumi ang eleksyon at pulitika sa bansa, kung gaano lapastanganin ng kapangyarihan ang pilipinas mula pa noon"
Quezon,395,3,picheowin,,160.0,ltbx,"sa paggamit ng pwesto para manlamang ng kapwa, mula sa pagpapasara ng isang kilalang publikasyong alerta, sa pagpapasara ng bukid ni aguinaldo, sa pang-iikot sa batas para magmukhang malinis sa madla, at kung paanong ipamukhang mangmang ang mga pilipino"
Quezon,395,4,picheowin,,160.0,ltbx,"it's scary how politicians acts like this until this day of 2025, hindi tayo natututo, hindi tayo umuusbong bilang bayan, hindi tayo umaangat bilang isang mamamayan–dahil sa mga katulad ni quezon"
Quezon,395,5,picheowin,,160.0,ltbx,"it's truly a masterpiece, salamat sa pagsasabuhay ng kwento ni quezon at magmumulat pa lalo sa mata ko at sa paninindigan ko"
Quezon,395,6,picheowin,,160.0,ltbx,"salamat bayaniverse, isa kang tunay na napakagaling na likha"
Quezon,396,1,thornsidedgirl,,160.0,ltbx,"cinematography was on POINTTT i love the little symbolisms, especially during the scenes where they have to go up and down that one split staircase (the subtle smugness of quezon once he says that he'll be resigning from the position of senate president knowing damn well he won't and proceeding to take one step higher on the staircase than osmeña )i will say though, the dialogue itself was"
Quezon,396,2,thornsidedgirl,,160.0,ltbx,strangely unnatural
Quezon,396,3,thornsidedgirl,,160.0,ltbx,"the mouthful of historical references that they shove into some of the lines makes it very obvious that they only wanted to spoonfeed unknowing viewers with the needed context which sadly, cheapens the initial quality of the film"
Quezon,396,4,thornsidedgirl,,160.0,ltbx,"but overall, the portrayal of political figures and their messiness was beautifully done"
Quezon,396,5,thornsidedgirl,,160.0,ltbx,it wasn't too broody that it disinterests the audience but it's grounded enough that it proves itself to have something substantial to say about mindless politics; what does it really mean to be free
Quezon,396,6,thornsidedgirl,,160.0,ltbx,and are we ready to take up that responsibility
Quezon,397,1,ezraaaman,,160.0,ltbx,Not sure if there’s any validity to that scene but that made me proud to live in Malolos

Quezon,400,1,verafied03,,140.0,ltbx,"What a lovely homage to Fritz LangWhat I particularly liked about part-biopic (or pure fiction, as what descendants of Quezon would like to believe) is that the protagonist is portrayed with all his flaws and imperfections, thus humanizing our probably most-quoted President in relation to nationalism and defiance against colonialism"
Quezon,400,2,verafied03,,140.0,ltbx,"While I would have loved to see how Aurora’s assassination affected Quezon’s political and personal beliefs, I do understand that this may verge on speculation and consequently, more of a fiction than an attempt to recount history with most accuracy"

Quezon,435,2,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,"cut out the first wife subplot-i love the early parts, it felt so wes anderson surpringly, not in his asthetics but more int he spirit of having charicatures and very stage like presentation"
Quezon,435,3,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,"- i love how the poltical game is represented like chess, but the excution of using whatever editing software to zoom in, and 5x the footage was bad"
Quezon,435,4,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,good idea but the excution was not able to realise it-personally i would've liked the quirky exaggeration to be heighted further
Quezon,435,5,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,"quezon at times feels more like walt disney, a micky mouse figure that is not a person"
Quezon,435,6,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,this is a good thing it adds to the political satire
Quezon,435,7,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,"- the framing device of using old movie reels to lead into flashbacks was a bit sloppy, at times you'd forget this framing device it's inconsitent"
Quezon,435,8,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,even the 3 act structure feels like it's all put out too quickly
Quezon,435,9,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,the film feels like it's torn between two tones
Quezon,435,10,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,"but at times it balances it well, espcially with the parade scene at the end with quezon and emillo's parades being contrasted espcially with it's color grading"
Quezon,435,11,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,could've been better but it's good
Quezon,435,12,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,"for this film i ate bottled ice tea, and drank sour cream popcorn with less butter added than i originally asked for"
Quezon,435,13,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,"i brought with me a party size popcorn that we bought from the cementary during all souls day, i added my own clarified butter which was good"
Quezon,435,14,mrd103,,120.0,ltbx,i wish the bottled ice tea was cold

Quezon,437,1,reintrovert,,180.0,ltbx,I rarely see Jericho Rosales in films but I think he does a good job capturing Quezon and the way people talk back in the late 1920s-30s
Quezon,437,2,reintrovert,,180.0,ltbx,Of course I have to applaud the production and costume design
Quezon,437,3,reintrovert,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s excellent and if I remember my fashion history well, I think they did a good job at depicting the way Filipinos & especially Filipino women dressed back then"
Quezon,437,4,reintrovert,,180.0,ltbx,"I also LOVE the format they chose to tell the story to stay true to the times, thru the silent films and then the 1920s-30s visual aesthetics"
Quezon,437,5,reintrovert,,180.0,ltbx,That aspect was so fun I love it so much
Quezon,437,6,reintrovert,,180.0,ltbx,"Anyway, it’s interesting to see how they portrayed Quezon because I vaguely remember how he was portrayed as a good President back in my elementary Philippine History lessons, how we briefly touched upon his “achievements”"
Quezon,437,7,reintrovert,,180.0,ltbx,"But since they say that this depiction was backed by historians, public facts and documents then I think they really did a good job of humanizing him"
Quezon,437,8,reintrovert,,180.0,ltbx,"He wasn’t just a shallow historical figure from the recent past anymore, we get to see his flaws & his motivations"
Quezon,437,9,reintrovert,,180.0,ltbx,This is great
Quezon,437,10,reintrovert,,180.0,ltbx,Leaving the cinema just made me kinda depressed tbh because it just reminded me of my PI 100 class

Quezon,437,12,reintrovert,,180.0,ltbx,"lagi nalang nananalo yung mga taong nasa matataas na posisyon na inuuna ang kanilang sariling interes imbis na maglungkod para sa bansa at para sa mga Pilipino, pumpublikong serbisyo"

Quezon,439,2,outersnake,,160.0,ltbx,The actors playing Quezon and Aguinaldo did a great job in portraying their characters

Quezon,450,1,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,i remember quezon being one of the many names i had to memorize for some 4th grade exam alongside his contributions to the jones act and the tydings-mcduffie act
Quezon,450,2,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"it was only until i became invested in historical movies that i decided to watch the bayaniverse, and it was in this trilogy where i started to look back and revisit my perspective on our national heroes"
Quezon,450,3,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"when we look at history, the act of calling someone a hero or a villain is very reductive, as it ignores the nuances of their decisions and their distinct worldviews and beliefs"
Quezon,450,4,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,the philippines is not exempt from this at all
Quezon,450,5,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"in the context of the bayaniverse, these people (luna, goyo, quezon) are inept and egotistical at best, and downright criminal at worst, but put them in a movement, and you have the spirit of the filipino revolution, proud and waving the flag"
Quezon,450,6,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"and despite their flaws, that does not erase the efforts they've done for an independent republic"
Quezon,450,7,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"tarog, with quezon, aimed to showcase both his flaws and his accomplishments in a way that piques our interest and to go to our local library and read up on our history"
Quezon,450,8,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"we are directly anchored in through joven and his family, and through him, we get to interact with the true nature of quezon, one that, just as tarog intended, is not displayed in bullet text or powerpoint"
Quezon,450,9,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"he is a con man who thrives in confidence and does whatever is necessary, because to him, politics is a game of chess"
Quezon,450,10,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"he anticipates, he strategizes, and takes advantage of weakness"
Quezon,450,11,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"he is thrust into a system that benefits those in power, and considering his eagerness to satiate his thirst for power, he uses that system to gain complete control of his circle and of the country"
Quezon,450,12,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"its use of satire and the bravado of 1920s silent film aesthetic at certain points complements the big personality of quezon, immediately making it the most unique out of the trilogy, where the prior films were conventional war epics, rather showcasing the action of politics than the action of bloodshed, but it remains as violent and intense as the previous films, but what makes quezon stand out is that despite its lens (not borrowed from nepomuceno"
Quezon,450,13,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"), the situations facing the country remain significantly relevant"
Quezon,450,14,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,the constant trips costing filipino taxpayers millions
Quezon,450,15,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,the fact that we have more politicians than public servants

Quezon,450,17,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"i forgot who said it, but they mentioned that quezon became the blueprint for modern day trapos, and i can see it"
Quezon,450,18,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"he possesses many of the traits that make up most of our senate, he's a cheat, a liar, and an opportunist"
Quezon,450,19,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,and that's what makes our national heroes so much more interesting
Quezon,450,20,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"in one way or another, they are not faultless, nor are they necessarily bad people"
Quezon,450,21,passivedre,,160.0,ltbx,"despite all my shit talk on quezon, the one thing i'll give him credit for was his love for the country, his means justify the ends and he DELIVERS, at the cost of his morality and friendships"

Quezon,452,4,graim,,180.0,ltbx,"And although his flaws are in the history books, they’re rarely emphasized in schools"
Quezon,452,5,graim,,180.0,ltbx,This movie finally showed that side of him
Quezon,452,6,graim,,180.0,ltbx,"Although they still showed his contributions for the Filipino people, it was overshadowed by the scheming, womanizing, manipulative traits, and that lowkey god complex side of him, at least with how he was depicted in the movie"
Quezon,452,7,graim,,180.0,ltbx,"He’s still undeniably a great president who did a lot for the country, but it’s good that we don’t over-romanticize or idolize political figures"
Quezon,452,8,graim,,180.0,ltbx,I just wish they also covered his actions during his term and during the Japanese invasion
Quezon,452,9,graim,,180.0,ltbx,It would’ve made a stronger conclusion and could have highlighted more of his contributions

Quezon,453,2,cowboylikemoni,,200.0,ltbx,the pacing is just right; the acting and chemistry are incredible; and the showcase of wit and humor—with the right blend of severity and weight in presenting these important moments of our history
Quezon,453,3,cowboylikemoni,,200.0,ltbx,"i’ve thought of aguinaldo and hernando as “always the side-characters, never the main characters,” for being present in all bayaniverse but never had the chance to have their own movie"
Quezon,453,4,cowboylikemoni,,200.0,ltbx,"however, in this last installment of the trilogy, it was established that aguinaldo and hernando are both the central characters of bayaniverse"
Quezon,453,5,cowboylikemoni,,200.0,ltbx,it all revolves around them
Quezon,453,6,cowboylikemoni,,200.0,ltbx,"so i wonder, are their connections the standard or the criteria to be considered"

Quezon,453,8,cowboylikemoni,,200.0,ltbx,"as i watch the credits, it’s not an isolated event for a director to be taking more parts of the film, but to direct, edit, transcribe, and score musical elements beautifully"

Quezon,459,5,onatsky,,160.0,ltbx,"He was presented as a womanizer, traitor friend and a political manipulator that brought controversy thrown to the cast and crew by one of the grandson of Quezon during the Q&A"
Quezon,459,6,onatsky,,160.0,ltbx,Technically this is the most polished among the Bayaniverse which includes HENERAL LUNA & GOYO
Quezon,459,7,onatsky,,160.0,ltbx,A film like this comes as a manna from heaven since big budget period epic comes only in a blue moon for theatrical viewing

Quezon,469,4,imnotaljeff,,140.0,ltbx,"To be clear, In general, I think the movie succeeds in what it's trying to do, but ultimately I feel like it's scope was too ambitious and it ended up being a little bit underwhelming"

Quezon,486,1,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,I watched Quezon yesterday in the cinemas
Quezon,486,2,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,The movie leans heavily on the negative aspects of Manuel L
Quezon,486,3,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,Quezon’s character—some of which are based on conjecture and lack sufficient historical evidence to be accepted as truth
Quezon,486,4,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"For example, there is a scene portraying voters booing Emilio Aguinaldo during his presidential campaign, supposedly orchestrated by Quezon"
Quezon,486,5,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,There is no record of this ever happening
Quezon,486,6,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"The film presents an unbalanced portrayal of the Philippines’ first president, further complicated by a fictional subplot involving made-up characters: journalist Jevon Hernando and his filmmaker daughter, Nadia, who produce campaign videos for Quezon’s presidential run while secretly creating “more honest” versions of each one"
Quezon,486,7,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"I didn’t quite understand the purpose of this subplot, except perhaps to draw parallels with the current political climate"
Quezon,486,8,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,The campaign videos felt like an early version of a “troll farm
Quezon,486,9,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"” In that sense, the film invites viewers to reflect on the prevalence of “fake news” and how even legitimate journalists can become complicit in the myth-making that surrounds political figures"
Quezon,486,10,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"The film puts forward the idea that “democracy” in the Philippines has never been the real deal because of problematic leaders such as Manuel Quezon, and that the system has always been broken from the start"
Quezon,486,11,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"I think it’s a motivating sentiment; however, the message becomes contrived when retroactively applying it to Quezon’s story"
Quezon,486,12,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,It presents what on the surface appears to be a compelling question: What does it mean when a historical film uses a 21st-century lens to moralize the past
Quezon,486,13,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"However, I personally disagree with this treatment of history"
Quezon,486,14,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,I believe history should be explored as unfamiliar terrain—something distinct from our present time
Quezon,486,15,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Otherwise, how could we genuinely learn anything from it"
Quezon,486,16,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Imposing a modern framework of social media–driven politics onto the past flattens historical complexity, especially when many Filipinos don’t have access to in-depth historical education or materials outside of school"
Quezon,486,17,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"The story—not just of Manuel Quezon’s life, but of all Filipinos involved in the journey toward Philippine independence, from the formation of the Senate and Congress to the election of the first president—could have offered an inspiring message"
Quezon,486,18,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Instead, all of this is portrayed as nothing but a sham"
Quezon,486,19,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"The film minimizes the work that Filipino figures did to win our independence by focusing only on the unsavory details of Quezon’s life, such as his love-hate relationship with Osmeña and his ploy to get Governor-General Leonard Wood removed from office"
Quezon,486,20,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,One of the film’s early fictional chapters is titled Quezon vs
Quezon,486,21,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Hernando: A Noble Lie, in which Quezon and Hernando debate the concept of “noble lies” using a quote from Plato"
Quezon,486,22,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,Quezon “loses” the argument simply because Hernando can name-drop more philosophers
Quezon,486,23,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Many scenes like this follow, reducing Quezon to a caricature—an exaggeratedly naïve and shallow version of himself"
Quezon,486,24,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Because our history is often told through the lens of our colonizers, mainly Americans, Filipinos have long had a weak sense of the value of freedom and independence"
Quezon,486,25,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,We have been taught to believe that we are not ready to govern ourselves—and perhaps never will be
Quezon,486,26,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,The film includes Quezon’s famous line: “I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by the Americans
Quezon,486,27,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"” In a more balanced portrayal, this line could have carried real gravitas"
Quezon,486,28,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"But given the film’s cynical treatment of Quezon, it instead becomes further evidence of his supposed incompetence"
Quezon,486,29,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"This film could have offered audiences a meaningful, alternative way to engage with our history"
Quezon,486,30,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Instead, it mimicked the very dynamics of social media, reducing historical events into digestible, sensationalized drama"
Quezon,486,31,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Audiences should ask questions while watching the movie, such as: Is there any genuine historical basis for the scene in which Manuel Quezon asks Vicente Madrigal for a blank check to fund his presidential campaign"
Quezon,486,32,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,What was the purpose of showing a completely fabricated conversation between a drunk Leonard Wood and Manuel Quezon
Quezon,486,33,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,I also took issue with the portrayal of Emilio Aguinaldo as Quezon’s more “credible” rival
Quezon,486,34,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"The movie pits Quezon and Aguinaldo against each other, going so far as to fabricate or misrepresent events to exaggerate their rivalry—such as showing Quezon canceling Aguinaldo’s pension during his run against him and framing the loss of Aguinaldo’s farm as a personal attack"
Quezon,486,35,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,Neither of these are based on fact
Quezon,486,36,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,It is well-documented that Aguinaldo ordered the executions of Andres Bonifacio and Antonio Luna
Quezon,486,37,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,These are not Quezon’s political inventions—they are part of the historical record
Quezon,486,38,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Yet the movie invents an entirely fictional subplot involving Pedro Janolino, who reaches out to Joven Hernando to reveal that Aguinaldo ordered him to kill General Antonio Luna"
Quezon,486,39,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,He is later revealed to be Quezon’s sergeant-at-arms who planted the testimony to sabotage Aguinaldo
Quezon,486,40,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"In truth, there really was a Pedro Janolino, and he did kill General Luna"
Quezon,486,41,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"He died before Quezon ran for president, and it was Panteleon Garcia who later revealed that Aguinaldo ordered Luna’s murder"
Quezon,486,42,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, I didn’t find the film well-executed overall"
Quezon,486,43,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"The acting was uneven, with the exception of Jericho Rosales (Quezon) and Mon Confiado (Aguinaldo)"
Quezon,486,44,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"The fictional film-within-a-film subplot featured unlikable, underdeveloped characters, and the “silent movie” aesthetic came across as contrived rather than clever"
Quezon,486,45,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,The production design was also disappointing
Quezon,486,46,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,The U
Quezon,486,48,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"colonial period was a stylish era—this is evident from the films and photographs of the time—yet the costumes, especially for the women, lacked both elegance and authenticity"
Quezon,486,49,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"In the end, I couldn’t understand the film’s motive in diminishing Quezon’s legacy"
Quezon,486,50,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"It seemed told through a distinctly pro-American lens: the Filipino masses are depicted as naïve and gullible, unable to grasp what “independence” truly means, while figures like Sergio Osmeña and Manuel Roxas are reduced to mere sidekicks without agency or depth—an unfair portrayal of these important historical figures"
Quezon,486,51,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Ultimately, the film misses an important opportunity"
Quezon,486,52,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Instead of offering a richer understanding of our nation’s early struggles for independence, it relies on cynicism, convenient narratives, and present-day parallels that oversimplify history—a treatment that is both disrespectful to Quezon and his descendants and intellectually irresponsible"
Quezon,486,53,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,That half the movie’s plot rests on a fabricated premise should be a sign for audiences to approach it critically
Quezon,486,54,nic_t_dlr,,40.0,ltbx,"Quezon’s story deserves a more nuanced, intelligent retelling—one that trusts its audience to think deeply, not one that panders to the fleeting attention span of social media"
Quezon,487,1,twinsairaphael,,80.0,ltbx,I would've liked this more if the characters spoke like actual people and stopped explaining the plot and the point of the movie every single chance they can
Quezon,487,2,twinsairaphael,,80.0,ltbx,Jerchio Rosales was good though
Quezon,487,3,twinsairaphael,,80.0,ltbx,Almost too good because the rest of the cast are struggling to keep up
Quezon,488,1,davidlmqo,,160.0,ltbx,UYY SI CONG TVV
Quezon,489,1,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,I can see why people would criticize this film for not representing the historical figures for all the actions they've done no matter how good or bad
Quezon,489,2,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,"But pieces of art, which this film is (regardless of quality), are meant to tell a thematic story"
Quezon,489,3,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,"For what it is, a film and not a documentary, it uses historical figures as symbols to tell a story of political games and showmanship"
Quezon,489,4,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,They are not who they were in history but are instead used as a backdrop for the inner workings of politics still prevalent to this day
Quezon,489,5,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,"The addition of Joven Hernando as a fictional character, other than being a narrative device, is a clear intention of the story being fictional, not historical, even if his existence being too fantastical at times"
Quezon,489,6,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,"Yes, it can be dangerous to represent a historical event/s and handwave all inaccuracies as necessary for drama"
Quezon,489,7,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,"You can even call this film straight up propaganda since it aims to tell a certain message with regards to politics, but it still functions as a piece of art"
Quezon,489,8,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,There is a risk of audiences viewing this dramatization as historical fact
Quezon,489,9,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,"A risk that no amount of ""fictionalized"" disclaimers can make people believe it to be otherwise"
Quezon,489,10,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,Do I believe this film shouldn't have been made for the lack of historical context it portrays
Quezon,489,12,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,"Without this film, I don't think a lot of Filipinos would know who Leonard Wood is"
Quezon,489,13,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,It ignites interests about the historical figures and leads people to seek out the facts themselves
Quezon,489,14,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,"Not a lot of people, me included, were aware of all the shit Wood did as Governor-General prior to this film"
Quezon,489,15,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,I didn't rate this film 3
Quezon,489,16,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,"5/5 for its accuracy, but instead for its pacing and tendency to read between the lines for you"
Quezon,489,17,caeljann,,140.0,ltbx,"Otherwise, it has great cinematography and a huge improvement in production value compared to Jerrold Tarog's previous films"
Quezon,490,1,macjohnearl,,60.0,ltbx,"This is very much a Bayaniverse entry without a single gunshot fired and the blood staining the chests of military men, its framework based on the idea of the camera being the real militant weapon of the times, and the truth is in the edit, despite Tarog rendering the device no weight"
Quezon,490,2,macjohnearl,,60.0,ltbx,There is simply no richness to be dug from ur-text of Quezon—its notions on the gamification of governance blowing cobwebs off a tired and worn out thesis as its attempts to doll up the friction within his praxis end up flat (why the hell is Aguinaldo suddenly so scared of placards)
Quezon,490,3,macjohnearl,,60.0,ltbx,And so it becomes all the more revealing when Tarog stayed silent during the meltdown of a Quezon descendant at their Powerplant Q&A: a silence that reveals a spinelessness unbecoming of a filmmaker who has made the Definitive Trilogy on behalf of the Filipino People™
Quezon,490,4,macjohnearl,,60.0,ltbx,"A funny nugget of irony now when Quezon clocks Joven as a hypocrite: the witness who records, but never intervenes"
Quezon,491,1,movieelj,,60.0,ltbx,I did not care for the caricature of a caricature acting of Jericho and Romnick
Quezon,491,2,movieelj,,60.0,ltbx,I am not sold that that is good acting
Quezon,491,3,movieelj,,60.0,ltbx,I did not care for the kind of simplistic depiction of political backroom talks
Quezon,491,4,movieelj,,60.0,ltbx,"Although it’s a scathing recounting of Quezon as a flawed man, it felt like they did not go deeper as to the extent of corruption, its cover up and the real intentions"
Quezon,491,5,movieelj,,60.0,ltbx,I wonder now if my opinion on the acting would change if I were satisfied with how the story of Quezon was tackled
Quezon,492,1,magallanes,,140.0,ltbx,Jerrold Tarrog has the magic of making you question history while still allowing you to remain enjoying the film
Quezon,492,2,magallanes,,140.0,ltbx,It makes you want to seek more information about it
Quezon,492,3,magallanes,,140.0,ltbx,"It makes you see this people who we have always known since youth, in a new light"
Quezon,492,4,magallanes,,140.0,ltbx,"But having said that, I still think that Goyo, among the three is his best"

Quezon,497,5,trvlyjxliana,,160.0,ltbx,"after seeing heneral luna & goyo, i am generally impressed and can say that it is not a total let down"
Quezon,497,6,trvlyjxliana,,160.0,ltbx,i just feel uneasy about the fictional parts because a big chunk of it was integrated
Quezon,497,7,trvlyjxliana,,160.0,ltbx,"in the time of misinformation, honestly, it can be very misleading— especially to the younger generation who will use this film as a historical basis"
Quezon,497,8,trvlyjxliana,,160.0,ltbx,"without research, we cannot differentiate between fact and fiction, especially when this is about a real person— a real part of history"
Quezon,497,9,trvlyjxliana,,160.0,ltbx,"but film-wise, this is a great film and we have definitely evolved in the philippine film industry"
Quezon,497,10,trvlyjxliana,,160.0,ltbx,hope to see more of these

Quezon,499,1,sidneymrno,,120.0,ltbx,"I lowkey feel like it was rushed, underfunded, not so creative, fast-paced, and trying to tell a lot of things in a short amount of time"
Quezon,499,2,sidneymrno,,120.0,ltbx,"And as opposed to the popular belief, I did not like the two-film approach that it took to tell the story of Quezon"
Quezon,499,3,sidneymrno,,120.0,ltbx,"I kind of feel like it was a waste of time, I would have preferred to see more of the stories and moments"
Quezon,499,4,sidneymrno,,120.0,ltbx,Another thing was the language used
Quezon,499,5,sidneymrno,,120.0,ltbx,"I know that it wanted to connect with the younger audiences, but preserving the way people talk before would have made the portrayal more serious-looking and effective"

Quezon,503,1,lecheflan,,,ltbx,enjoyed it a bit despite its many misgivings
Quezon,503,2,lecheflan,,,ltbx,"however, the way the genuine resistance of the masses was portrayed left a terrible taste in my mouth"
Quezon,503,3,lecheflan,,,ltbx,it is reductive to say the old communist party’s participated in the elections so openly when they were banned and its leaders were only pardoned after quezon’s election
Quezon,503,4,lecheflan,,,ltbx,it is distasteful to portray the incident in malolos as a conspiratorial event
Quezon,503,5,lecheflan,,,ltbx,and aguinaldo really did play a big part in giving the philippines away to america; he is no righteous man
Quezon,503,6,lecheflan,,,ltbx,not to mention the evident struggle with cinematography given the obliteration of our country’s pre-war structures

Quezon,509,2,dailyonanay,,140.0,ltbx,"i don’t have enough words yet to give a proper review (because of all the historical/current world contexts to take into consideration), but in this portrayal of quezon, he really was showed as a villainous bayani… there was a lot of room for more depth sana like focusing on his whys but wala eh, it was just a repetition of oooo ok quezon wasn’t all that good"
Quezon,509,3,dailyonanay,,140.0,ltbx,"to be clear, i am not defending him ok but i think his bad guy representation was a biiiiiit too excessive which rly strengthens my theory na this movie was made to parallelize ("

Quezon,513,4,crlssison,,120.0,ltbx,"Important still that these “great men” of Philippine history are deconstructed and demystified in a trilogy of pretty decent (or maybe better yet, palateable) movies"
Quezon,513,5,crlssison,,120.0,ltbx,"This last one feels a bit too long, its titular Quezon a bit too villainous, but a watchable film nonetheless"

Quezon,551,1,briancly,,120.0,ltbx,"It’s a pretty straightforward historical drama, chronicling the rise of a political leader and charting the path for independence for The Philippines"
Quezon,551,2,briancly,,120.0,ltbx,"I’ll acknowledge that it doesn’t seem to be a shameless puff piece, and it acknowledges Quezon as a sort of leader without much personal integrity who focuses more on pragmatism, which perhaps may have been important for his goals, even if he was driven largely by ego"
Quezon,551,3,briancly,,120.0,ltbx,"There is some interesting artistic flair with the silent film interpretations, which honestly should have been the entire film"
Quezon,551,4,briancly,,120.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales is excellent at giving that Charlie Sheen vibe
Quezon,551,5,briancly,,120.0,ltbx,"It’s a solid film overall even if it does kind of drag with a bunch of political bullshit that’s admittedly all the same thing of constant backstabbing and alliances, which does sound cool, but it’s a pretty normal historical drama"
Quezon,552,1,marknorella,,140.0,ltbx,Just don’t compare Quezon to the first two films in the trilogy and you’ll find something to admire
Quezon,552,2,marknorella,,140.0,ltbx,"It stands on its own as a portrait of power and pride, though at times unsure of which face to show"
Quezon,552,3,marknorella,,140.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales walks a tightrope between conviction and caricature, brilliant one moment, baffling the next"
Quezon,552,4,marknorella,,140.0,ltbx,"The production looks rich and patriotic, but the story doesn’t quite know what it’s fighting for"
Quezon,552,5,marknorella,,140.0,ltbx,"It wants to build a hero, but forgets to give him a clear battle"
Quezon,552,6,marknorella,,140.0,ltbx,"Still, if you let it be its own story, you’ll enjoy the echoes of history and the weight of what it tries to say"

Quezon,554,3,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,The good old fashioned politician and the staunch patriot
Quezon,554,4,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,"""QUEZON"" isn't particularly the film that one may expect from writer-director Jerrold Tarog's ""Bayaniverse"""
Quezon,554,5,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,The titular hero isn't glorified but examined - with all his strengths and imperfections
Quezon,554,6,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,"History, as rich as it gets, immortalizes the gripping and controversial facets of the beloved statesman that unsurprisingly still echo up to this day"
Quezon,554,7,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,"Exceptionally played by Urian winner Jericho Rosales, we get to see the might, influence, charisma, narcissism, lies, and betrayals of Philippines' second president through his acting force and vulnerability"
Quezon,554,8,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,The penchant to roll the classic 4:3 movie aspect ratio in its short films and the interesting camera pans during the Congress election strategies a la chess moves are some of its strong suits
Quezon,554,9,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,"Art and production designs, although a good addition, can be improved to perfectly embody its era"
Quezon,554,10,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,"Bearing its creative license, it dramatizes the calculated games and internal conflicts through (at times confusing) non-linear storytelling with hefty dialogues and politicking narratives that can be cut down in exchange for more warranted depictions of political effects to the society under the eight-year regime, apart from showcasing people's ignorance of the very notion of independence"
Quezon,554,11,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,Now that would be more compelling and cathartic
Quezon,554,12,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,"Rosales truly leads the pack but it's indubitable that every featured artist (Romnick Sarmenta, Mon Confiado, Cris Villanueva, Benjamin Alves, Karylle, and even its import Iain Glen to name a few) pours their heart to the material"
Quezon,554,13,legendaryl06,,140.0,ltbx,"A call to action in these trying times, may this push us to demand for a better nation"

Quezon,564,3,nicowithalei,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s a film that shows how the idea of independence can be vague, and how it can easily be used as a weapon for power"

Quezon,579,1,kimpoybrian,,140.0,ltbx,I firmly believe that films interpreting our past are meant to be divisive
Quezon,579,2,kimpoybrian,,140.0,ltbx,"Our history might be flawed and imperfect, and revisiting it can unravel old wounds, but it defines us who we all are today"
Quezon,579,3,kimpoybrian,,140.0,ltbx,As long as the art is supported by reputable and truthful facts then there is surely no reason for anyone to be aggressively agitated by the work

Quezon,587,2,ratkilluh,,,ltbx,"Amazing direction, great performances (Jericho is on x-games mode), and I absolutely love the sets, the itsy bitsy deets, the theatrical scenes, the visual storytelling, the technicalities, the wardrobe could've been better; everybody is still wearing a costume"
Quezon,587,3,ratkilluh,,,ltbx,"Please give the everyday clothing some life into it, not look like its brand new, fresh off the shelves (very off-putting for a pretentious guy like me)"
Quezon,587,4,ratkilluh,,,ltbx,"There are great lines in the movie, but I think the dialogue was overly-expositional (I get it for the younger audience, yes, context is key yada yada), but it detaches me from the experience"
Quezon,587,5,ratkilluh,,,ltbx,Score is amazing too
Quezon,587,6,ratkilluh,,,ltbx,oh and watch it if you haven't

Quezon,588,1,s_ji,,200.0,ltbx,I truly admire how Jerrold Tarog’s filmmaking quality has remained consistent and even improved over time
Quezon,588,2,s_ji,,200.0,ltbx,The way he presented the issues in our country was commendable—he incorporated them naturally into the story without forcing the message
Quezon,588,3,s_ji,,200.0,ltbx,"I especially appreciate how the film avoided glorifying Quezon or any political figure; instead, it portrayed him as a complex leader who, like many politicians, sought both power and progress"
Quezon,588,4,s_ji,,200.0,ltbx,This realism makes the film even powerful
Quezon,588,5,s_ji,,200.0,ltbx,One striking moment was when…

Quezon,595,4,ayeana,,160.0,ltbx,it made me want to do a reflection paper even though it wasn't required for our subject
Quezon,595,5,ayeana,,160.0,ltbx,it really brought back my childhood interest in history
Quezon,596,1,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,an aguinaldo propaganda in the guise of a quezon biopic
Quezon,596,2,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,this film is really all about perception
Quezon,596,3,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,how quezon weaponized perception
Quezon,596,4,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,and most importantly on how this film presents aguinaldo in stark contrast to how he was presented in heneral luna
Quezon,596,5,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,i hated that aguinaldo presented in the past film but i can’t help but sympathize with him in this one
Quezon,596,6,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,"but this is what this film wants it to be and that “aguinaldo propaganda” concludes not only the movie, but the franchise altogether"
Quezon,596,7,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,i kept thinking that maybe there remains in aguinaldo a semblance of heroism especially in that one specific scene where he chose not to introduce quezon’s alleged first wife and just use her as a pawn
Quezon,596,8,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,or maybe it was the emphasis on how his candidacy for presidency was a mere heed of duty and not out of lust for power
Quezon,596,9,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,or maybe i felt bad because he was gradually yet loudly stripped of power
Quezon,596,10,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,or maybe just the culmination of every vengeful act of quezon against him
Quezon,596,11,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,or maybe it’s just easier to accept him as a lesser evil
Quezon,596,12,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,the idea of resonating and accepting someone merely because they are a lesser evil is just plain foolishness in theory
Quezon,596,13,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,even the idea of a “lesser evil” just seems to transcend all bounds of rationality
Quezon,596,14,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,did we bring that idea into conception as a cry for help
Quezon,596,15,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,a cry for hope
Quezon,596,16,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,it’s really easier to side with someone
Quezon,596,17,rheonna,,160.0,ltbx,"as a country who remains deep in suffering, misery loves company i guess"

Quezon,607,2,cent04,,180.0,ltbx,This is one of the lines that resonated with me after watching the film
Quezon,607,3,cent04,,180.0,ltbx,The mere fact that these traditional politicians boil everything that they do down to this idea of doing questionable means towards a 'good end' is not only narcissistic but also dangerous at best
Quezon,607,4,cent04,,180.0,ltbx,These people genuinely believe that a lie could be considered 'noble'
Quezon,607,5,cent04,,180.0,ltbx,"Meaning, what is ethically right for them is already skewed, and that conscience no longer plays a role in the crux of their actions"
Quezon,607,6,cent04,,180.0,ltbx,"Rosales' Quezon, even at the very end of the film, embodied this rotten mentality, thoroughly absorbed in the idea of being the 'Great Savior' that the Philippines needed for its independence--even at the expense of losing the true meaning of the word"
Quezon,607,7,cent04,,180.0,ltbx,"Truly a magnificent end to the 'bayaniverse' trilogy, showcasing a 'war' that is not fought in the front (compared to 'Heneral Luna' and 'Goyo')"
Quezon,607,8,cent04,,180.0,ltbx,"A war that is played behind cunning speeches and charming smiles, but is dangerous all the same"
Quezon,607,9,cent04,,180.0,ltbx,"Not gonna lie, I thoroughly enjoyed Quezon and Osmena's dynamics (iykyk)"

Quezon,614,2,rysesto,,160.0,ltbx,it mostly showed quezon and his two sides: the charming hero of the masses and the dirty tactics opportunist that keeps him in the business
Quezon,614,3,rysesto,,160.0,ltbx,"i liked the film felt like a play mirroring how quezon was like a showman and despite a lot of creative liberties, they don't miss with the emotional story beats"
Quezon,614,4,rysesto,,160.0,ltbx,"it is a shame we didnt get more screentime in his term in ww2 (the standardization of the filipino language kinda does deserve its own film) and the positive effect of his accomplishments on the filipino besides morale but with the scope of the movie being really large, im fine with what we have"

Quezon,625,1,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,I think the film has true promise
Quezon,625,2,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Quezon has always been quite a controversial figure of the early fight for true Philippine independence
Quezon,625,3,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,He did as much good and as much bad if you really think deeply about it BUT the film is just presented in such a dense way
Quezon,625,4,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,In posits there is true good in Politics
Quezon,625,5,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Even sections of actual criticism in the film is really hampered by Tarrog's insistence of the right 'governance'
Quezon,625,6,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,The lack of a real alternative or an actual in depth conversations that does not really fall into this guise of moral grandstanding is prevalent that it was so eyeroll inducing
Quezon,625,7,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,You can read philosophies and still be the worst person ever - a college with Liberal Arts make you learn that quickly
Quezon,625,8,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"If Quezon did not win, what does Aguinaldo can offer in the table that he himself had not done too"
Quezon,625,9,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"Rather film, just villainizes Quezon's insistence to lead"
Quezon,625,10,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,One good example of the film's insistence for moralistic bent but lack of actual 'analysis' is the film's villainization of Quezon's use of his connection
Quezon,625,11,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,That is what connections are for
Quezon,625,12,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"To create this dynamic give and take but it oh no, that is bad - because he can make so much campaign materials"
Quezon,625,13,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"It never really delivered on the fact on what would become the Nacionalista Party lead to one of the biggest ultra-majority in the Philippine's History, a familiar sight if anyone has lived to tell in the Duterte era Congress"
Quezon,625,14,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"In fact, the film kinda glosses the fact that this same majority lead the changes in the constitution that inadvertently resulted to the Marcos Dictatorship"
Quezon,625,15,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"In fact, I do think the reason there are many rich families interested in Government is because how they were able to really to enter political spaces during this time"
Quezon,625,16,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"Like for a film that prides itself as critical, it always uses these weak arguments to posit the rather double face attitude of Quezon"
Quezon,625,17,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"I was grasping straws, because it uses the worst criticisms (ad hominems) rather than just actually pulling real punches that is still present in the current Philippine political space"
Quezon,625,18,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"It just bats this idea that Quezon wants the presidency is bad (not really bad), because he wants it no matter what"
Quezon,625,19,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,His machination is bad since he is not truthful about his intention
Quezon,625,20,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,It literally is true facts
Quezon,625,21,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"Quezon is a problematic and prolific muckraker, that most of what we hate about Aguinaldo is actually rooted towards his campaign against him"
Quezon,625,22,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,That is attested but a lot of actual paper trails sadly has been destroyed by the war of 45
Quezon,625,23,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,The film posits that is bad
Quezon,625,24,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(not necessarily) but the problem here is that the film also plays out the same muckraking as noble against some of his 'enemies' since they it's not out there
Quezon,625,25,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Like come-on now film
Quezon,625,26,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,That is just plain stupidity at this point
Quezon,625,27,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,You cannot just make this two sides of the coin when it's practically the same side
Quezon,625,28,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,I also hate how the film hates Quezon since he is sly about his approach on things but equally loves the American because of their you ready sine clearly the average filipino does not know the word for Independence
Quezon,625,29,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT THE LEADERS to begin with
Quezon,625,30,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Another instance of the film going for the soft analysis over real question of readiness with the leadership
Quezon,625,31,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"And also, it really gives so much pass for the Americans and how they handled the Philippines, because they are well-meaning apparently"
Quezon,625,32,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"Suddenly, the atrocities is just a side comment here and there"
Quezon,625,33,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"Even Aguinaldo, who could have been more complex as a character himself is just plainly glorified"
Quezon,625,34,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,I just feel there is so much more here that could have been made to make this actually critical in a sense that in actually is talking about things that would still be prevalent in our life and all
Quezon,625,35,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"On a lighter mode, Good performances though"
Quezon,625,36,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Echo does well
Quezon,625,37,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,I personally think certain actors looked closer to the very Hispanized Quezon but has character for it
Quezon,625,38,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,He kinda performed really well and the cavalcade of supporting role was a welcome surprise
Quezon,625,39,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"I personally think the film did well visually and editing wise, which is a lot for a local film"
Quezon,625,40,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,The costuming though is really bad - a lot of badly fitted suits
Quezon,625,41,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,I will still recommend this BUT with a deep reading about Quezon's role in PHI history tbh
Quezon,625,42,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,It is important to look at this with a more critical eyes since this takes a lot of true issues about Quezon but in a way that feels misguided tbh
Quezon,625,43,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(1) Hmmm
Quezon,625,44,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Surface level talks about Government leadership
Quezon,625,45,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,I wish sana within true leaders dapat tbh
Quezon,625,46,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,DDS sense is tingling
Quezon,625,47,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(2) Uy cinema scenes
Quezon,625,48,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Pero again this belief that there is only true good and true bad
Quezon,625,49,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,And true good is not subtle
Quezon,625,50,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,And by knowing western idealogy
Quezon,625,51,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"(3) Konfirmed, half glass empty approach and very dds"
Quezon,625,52,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(4) The American racism is played done here
Quezon,625,53,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"(5) Also, Tarrog does hate Quezon here"
Quezon,625,54,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"Even a simple political function like Appointment is played against Quezon, because it is his literal job"
Quezon,625,55,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"He has a job to do, what do you mean he has to be true to some kind of moral logic"
Quezon,625,56,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"(6) Soft positive, great style from Tarrog"
Quezon,625,57,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"(7) Sa lahat ng oomff ko walang commentary about how American was never really into the Philippines, or the rather weird anti-independence belief in the film"
Quezon,625,58,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,but posits that murican cares about you and baddie quezon just want to be free
Quezon,625,59,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(8) Not the Aguinaldo advocacy in the film
Quezon,625,60,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,I still have an hour left off this film and this awful and redeemable in my eyes
Quezon,625,61,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(9) Ang tanga na nung film
Quezon,625,62,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Literal na may political parties and donor ang isang politiko
Quezon,625,63,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Your unpopularity with donors/failing party is more of you problem
Quezon,625,64,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(10) There is credence on Aguinaldo vs Quezon
Quezon,625,65,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,I do believe that Aguinaldo even tried to oust his presidency
Quezon,625,66,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(Incorrect it was much worst - collaboration with the Japanese)
Quezon,625,67,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(11) But this feels like too critical to Quezon at all
Quezon,625,68,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(12) This is practically me trying to piece my history
Quezon,625,69,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Quezon is not the nicest man in all accounts - the film got that right but he pushed the buttons to where our country lead into
Quezon,625,70,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Successful or Not
Quezon,625,71,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,The film is just too damn negative to the point That it rather be friendly to Americans and Aguinaldo and make them a densely woo is mee characters
Quezon,625,72,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(13) Aguinaldo being shocked that people hate after getting a bunch of KKK members death
Quezon,625,73,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,"Kkk is not the same klub from USA, btw"
Quezon,625,74,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,(14) This last section that heavily focuses on Quezon in his final days is so much better
Quezon,625,75,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,It is a true character study that does not need grandstanding good or bad morality
Quezon,625,76,akoaytao,,60.0,ltbx,Talaga namern

Quezon,702,4,norbssarigumba,,160.0,ltbx,I particularly enjoyed the unraveling of the Aguinaldo vs
Quezon,702,5,norbssarigumba,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon showdown in 1935, a satisfying karmic payback for the atrocities Aguinaldo did in the past"
Quezon,702,6,norbssarigumba,,160.0,ltbx,"Understandably, the movie was not as action packed as its predecessors given that its events occurred post-Philippine revolution"
Quezon,702,7,norbssarigumba,,160.0,ltbx,"But I found the movie’s exposition of the political drama at that time to have sufficiently made up for the lack of gunshots and wars as a backdropWhile the movie is set in the ‘20s-‘30s, “Quezon” poignantly mirrors the patronage and personality politics that continue to fester our country today"
Quezon,702,8,norbssarigumba,,160.0,ltbx,"It ultimately makes one realize that our nation’s forefathers are as equally to be blamed, if not more, for the sorry state of our government today"

Quezon,703,1,airaalvrs,,160.0,ltbx,"Made me realize that even now we are still being played by the same machineries and tricks, how those in power can bend politics around their fingers and still call it leadership"

Quezon,710,1,justwow346,,160.0,ltbx,"Gripping but messy, Quezon is an incredibly well made film that had me hooked, not only because of what happened in the film but because of the ambition and risk it was to take such a beloved historical Filipino figure and paint him in such a negative light"
Quezon,710,2,justwow346,,160.0,ltbx,"I have some issues with the first half being messy and the second half dragging a bit, but the positives far outweigh the negatives with this sharply written and exceptionally well made political drama"

Quezon,718,1,kleyr,,140.0,ltbx,Feel ko…magjowa sila hehe
Quezon,719,1,hotpotshroom,,,ltbx,This third bayaniverse installment is more creative and whimsical
Quezon,719,2,hotpotshroom,,,ltbx,"It's fitting to the message that the movie is trying to make about powerful men's greed that shaped the beginning of our republic (characterized by choreography, a performance, and ultimately a game where Filipinos lose)"
Quezon,719,3,hotpotshroom,,,ltbx,We feel more directly the decision to make the film allude to our current political landscape where media becomes a tool in dividing the people
Quezon,719,4,hotpotshroom,,,ltbx,"I don't think people should take this as autobiographies of our ""bayani"" because this film is not just about Quezon but equally the beginnings of a Philippine government that the people deal with today"
Quezon,719,5,hotpotshroom,,,ltbx,It's a reflection of our current conditions and the reasons why independence is still a thing our politicians utter but the people never fully grasp
Quezon,719,6,hotpotshroom,,,ltbx,I wished they added Filipino translations to the film within this film though

Quezon,725,2,gabs0bession,,160.0,ltbx,"I still really like the movie and the style, probably one of the best movies of the year"

Quezon,726,2,joannelame,,140.0,ltbx,5 star for getting me curious in the first place
Quezon,727,1,tofushop,,160.0,ltbx,"JACK EN POY HALE HALE HOY Okay but fr though, love how this film is as much about the common Filipino folk as it is about Quezon"
Quezon,727,2,tofushop,,160.0,ltbx,"I love how there is this emphasis on us contributing to the very same system that hurts us (symbolized by Joven seeking Quezon out and promoting him), but at the same time the film does not fault us for this because it also acknowledges that we do this to secure our future and the lives of our families"
Quezon,727,3,tofushop,,160.0,ltbx,"At the end of the day, like Joven, we can still very much acknowledge that the system is absolute ass and fight against it"
Quezon,727,4,tofushop,,160.0,ltbx,The unfortunate thing about Tarog's movies so far have been that they're too familiar
Quezon,727,5,tofushop,,160.0,ltbx,"So familiar in fact that you can compare an event in the movie to a political event that happened, let's say, just a few weeks ago"
Quezon,727,6,tofushop,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon said that he would rather a government run like hell by Filipinos, than a government run like heaven by Americans, because that means we -- the Filipinos -- have the freedom to improve it without outside forces pushing and pulling at us"
Quezon,727,7,tofushop,,160.0,ltbx,"The problem is, nothing has changed"
Quezon,727,8,tofushop,,160.0,ltbx,The Philippines is as much run like hell today as it was way back then
Quezon,727,9,tofushop,,160.0,ltbx,"I love you Nadia, 1930s Filipina movie director"

Quezon,729,1,habada__,,120.0,ltbx,It’s very ambitious
Quezon,729,2,habada__,,120.0,ltbx,"Though it made a valiant attempt, I think it got lost in trying to tell the 30+ year story of the most powerful Filipino 2nd only to Ferdie"
Quezon,729,3,habada__,,120.0,ltbx,"Malakas yung opening niya, pero as the screentime went on, naging paulit ulit nlng yung character beat ni Quezon"
Quezon,729,4,habada__,,120.0,ltbx,I think eto talaga yung kahinaan ng “Bayaniverse”
Quezon,729,5,habada__,,120.0,ltbx,"Though deep and well acted, ultimately 2D lng yung mga main characters"
Quezon,729,6,habada__,,120.0,ltbx,The ending was disappointing
Quezon,729,7,habada__,,120.0,ltbx,Rinush yung “tragedy” ni Quezon to a single scene
Quezon,729,8,habada__,,120.0,ltbx,"It felt less like a story and more just a chronology/ documentary, which is the danger nmn of all biopics"
Quezon,729,9,habada__,,120.0,ltbx,"Still, it was a fun watch"
Quezon,729,10,habada__,,120.0,ltbx,"The smallest attention to detail (like 48 stars lng yung US flag not 50) kept me hooked since it showed na it was made with passion, nde lng for the cheap jokes/ caricatures of history"
Quezon,729,11,habada__,,120.0,ltbx,"If they ever make a Marcos biopic, i hope they learn from the shortcomings of Quezon"

Quezon,733,1,jiemfranc,,160.0,ltbx,"I'm confident in the production's handling of historical accuracy, and one can only wish the production team well, hoping the highest sense of responsibility was employed to achieve that benchmark"
Quezon,733,2,jiemfranc,,160.0,ltbx,"Technically, this film is no joke—it's genuinely strong"
Quezon,733,3,jiemfranc,,160.0,ltbx,"Pulling off the production requirements for historical films is incredibly difficult, but what amazes me about director Jerrold Tarog is his profound sense of vision"
Quezon,733,4,jiemfranc,,160.0,ltbx,"It is creative, yet direct enough to clearly tell the narrative to a broad audience"
Quezon,733,5,jiemfranc,,160.0,ltbx,"Narrative-wise, the ""film within a film"" trope is a good idea, though it needs some polishing to make the 'buddy and soul' arc more impactful"
Quezon,733,6,jiemfranc,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite needing that refinement, it remains a highly creative approach to the story"
Quezon,733,7,jiemfranc,,160.0,ltbx,"While I struggle to engage during the very first few minutes, from my lens, this is a great film"
Quezon,733,8,jiemfranc,,160.0,ltbx,It is strong enough to celebrate the Bayaniverse's impact and secure its future

Quezon,738,1,knoxoverstreat,,180.0,ltbx,"I love how the Bayaniverse trilogy depicts its main characters not as heroes, but as human beings"
Quezon,738,2,knoxoverstreat,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon, despite having good intentions for the growth and development of the Phillipines, did not hold back from getting his hands dirty in playing the game of politics"
Quezon,738,3,knoxoverstreat,,180.0,ltbx,"Osmena, Wood, and Aguinaldo are promintent rivals who tested Quezon’s morals and capabilities, and this film did not fall short in showing his flaws as a leader being consumed for his thirst for power and what he is willing to do to achieve it"
Quezon,738,4,knoxoverstreat,,180.0,ltbx,The quote “Being a hero is all about perception” really summarizes Quezon’s rise to power

Quezon,746,1,luna_blanco,,180.0,ltbx,i don’t think i’ve seen a movie that’s had as much to say about the state of the country since fan girl- interesting experience all things considered i do love the approach here
Quezon,746,2,luna_blanco,,180.0,ltbx,"making this a dark satirical comedy of sorts immediately sets it apart from the other Bayaniverse movies, and in this case, by focusing on a figure as well known as Quezon allows it to play with what we know"
Quezon,746,3,luna_blanco,,180.0,ltbx,"like we’ve all been taught about the good Quezon’s done, but we never quite got to know the man behind all that"
Quezon,746,4,luna_blanco,,180.0,ltbx,this movie sheds light on that with a biting but ultimately honest look at him and how he may very well have been no different from whoever else is running around in the government these daysinteresting contrast to Quezon’s Game for sure

Quezon,749,1,roughangelo,,140.0,ltbx,I think Jericho Rosales did such a compelling Quezon - and his chemistry with Romnick Sarmienta was on fire
Quezon,749,2,roughangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"This movie, contrary to the extreme reactions of some of Quezon’s descendants, actually deepens the former president’s characterization beyond merely being the ‘Commonwealth president’ and the ‘Father of the national language"
Quezon,749,3,roughangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"’ The era Quezon lived in was unlike any other, and its politicians were complex, multifaceted characters navigating personal ambitions along with the demands of governing a fledgling nation"
Quezon,749,4,roughangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"Jerrold Tarog must be commended for his continued examination of the nation’s founding fathers - and this is a fitting, albeit unofficial, conclusion to his ‘Bayaniverse’ trilogy"

Quezon,750,5,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,What a waste of resources and potential
Quezon,750,6,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,These events happened already
Quezon,750,7,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,Why the need to add fictional elements for thematic purposes
Quezon,750,8,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,"Was adding fictional character/s necessary, if their goal was to educate our generation of who Quezon really was"
Quezon,750,9,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,"And why include flashbacks inside the movie, when we are already looking back into the past"
Quezon,750,10,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,It adds confusion as to where we are in the plot
Quezon,750,11,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,I did not like the ugly art deco designs in the flashback scenes and as part of the office design
Quezon,750,12,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,The over contoured faces
Quezon,750,13,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,Using “Hallelujah Chorus” as background music during the signing of the Tydings-McDuffie Act was tasteless
Quezon,750,14,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,Please try to be more imaginative next time
Quezon,750,15,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,American characters (like Wood) being portrayed as morally upright in contrast with Quezon’s portrayal of character should be talked about more
Quezon,750,16,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,It implies white supremacy and colonial mentality
Quezon,750,17,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,"Let’s not do that all over again :)There was a scene where they brought out Quezon’s first wife for five seconds, for what"
Quezon,750,18,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,Was the goal to empower women or to further impose traditional gender roles where women are pushed to the sidelines
Quezon,750,19,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,"She was dismissed, shrugged from the plot"
Quezon,750,20,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,Please do better next time
Quezon,750,21,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,"This movie had the potential to call out the dirty elections, spoils system, traditional politics, systematic corruption, and imperialism"
Quezon,750,22,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,The very same issues they faced (or should I say reinforced
Quezon,750,23,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,) before that we still face today
Quezon,750,24,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,While I do commend the morally stained portrayal of Quezon as it serves as a lesson to not idolize individuals (especially government officials)
Quezon,750,25,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,"However, the public may be misled to believe this fictional plot points that are conveniently dramatic"
Quezon,750,26,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,We should not tolerate or promote historical distortion in media
Quezon,750,27,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,It would be so much better to simply provide the public a historical film that adheres to historical documents and facts
Quezon,750,29,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,These are just my opinions
Quezon,750,30,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,This is a free and independent nation after all (see what I did there
Quezon,750,33,charliewatch13,,100.0,ltbx,I need someone to give me flowers and chocolates after each fight too
Quezon,752,1,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,gets ko na yung nagsabing oppenheimer tagalog to
Quezon,752,2,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"HAHAHAHAH as far as mainstream pinoy cinema goes, this is a pretty great takedown of the idea of the ""great man"" as told in the history textbooks that we grew up with"
Quezon,752,3,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"the act of framing manuel quezon's shenanigans in his rise to power as one of the seeds that bore our nation's problems in the present is a pretty brave and bold move for a big budget, mainstream studio film to take, especially in the context of our local cinema"
Quezon,752,4,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"what i think makes quezon work so well is how, unlike the previous two films, it still plots out a clear narrative without losing sight of its unifying thread despite chronicling more than decade's worth of history"
Quezon,752,5,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"the unfortunate caveat to all of this is, of course, the loss of focus on other significant political and social players during this time, such as the sakdalista movement, as well as the downplaying of the strength and significance of the presidential campaign of gregorio aglipay, who himself won two provinces, despite the insignificance that the film portrays him with"
Quezon,752,6,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"despite all that, for what it is, jerrold tarog's quezon is still one of the most exciting filipino releases in recent memory, and the inevitable role it will play in the further reassessment of the way we've learned our history and the eventual reckoning with it will be one that i will be watching out for"
Quezon,753,1,patroclues,,140.0,ltbx,"Out of all the films in this trilogy, I think Quezon captures the thesis Tarog's take on the filipino hero the best"
Quezon,753,2,patroclues,,140.0,ltbx,"Comparing it to Luna and especially Goyo, Quezon seems to be more overt with its critique on filipino politics and the filipino people as spectators of what goes on in our society"
Quezon,753,3,patroclues,,140.0,ltbx,"Though, seemingly with the other films in this trilogy, its message is served to its audience on a silver platter (some would say very preachy) but I guess it's a hard responsibility to take as a directior especially with how a lot of people took Luna's messaging"
Quezon,753,4,patroclues,,140.0,ltbx,So in a way that proves the message of the movie
Quezon,753,5,patroclues,,140.0,ltbx,How could the filipino understand freedom if they are deprived of learning about it
Quezon,753,6,patroclues,,140.0,ltbx,"also the performances were so good, Jericho Rosales' charisma and his ability to look so scary and eerie in the most tense situations *chefs kiss* in another note, teasing magsaysay in a post credit scene like the next solo movie in the marvel cinematic universe is so funny"
Quezon,754,1,benoitsnecktie,,200.0,ltbx,"CINEMA IS SO FUCKING BACCKKKthe production design was so good, quezon's suits was so crisp it makes me wanna cry and get one for myself, and the concept of a movie driving the plot inside the movie, and also"

Quezon,756,1,ayahdventure,,140.0,ltbx,"rewatched quezon with the fam and now i have a whole new thing to rant about HAKSJSSJkasi otw home, my dad was talking about how quezon was made out to be the villain when he technically didnt do anything illegal, he just called in some favors, compared to aguinaldo who was said to have killed luna and bonifaciobut bruhh thats not the point of the film"
Quezon,756,2,ayahdventure,,140.0,ltbx,"cuz who fucking cares if what quezon did was illegal, the point was that it was morally wrong and manipulative and untruthful in what he claimed himself to be to his voters and to the publicthe point is that the foundation of philippine politics is based on morally wrong and informal/unsound practices (patronage politics)i think its kinda stupid to be arguing about whos right and whos wrong, whos more evil than who"
Quezon,756,3,ayahdventure,,140.0,ltbx,"it doesnt fucking matter cuz that shit alr happened and those people are alr dead HAJSHSJSHSJwhat matters is how it reflects the framework of philippine politics todayif youre mad about the things the *actually dead* characters of the film did *in the actual past*, which were not even sure are true (historical accuracy) or illegal, then you should direct that anger to the exact same shit but worse thats factually happening right now, thats actually illegal, and by people who are still alive and will continue to commit these crime unless theyre prosecuted and revolted againsti hope people know na this isnt just historical beef na they can just argue about forda drama and the marites-ing of it all and na its still happening right now and that were actual characters in the exact same story but worsethese arent just scenes and characters from a drama that you can just debate about for entertainment, because we live and experience these exact same real life scenes and characters in the everyday modern philippines"
Quezon,756,4,ayahdventure,,140.0,ltbx,you shouldnt be rooting for aguinaldo or quezon or whoever character in that film; you should be rooting for yourself and the filipino people in the roles we play in philippine politics today and in our future as a nation
Quezon,757,1,maxinerae,,160.0,ltbx,Would love to add another star because I was there during that meltdown at the Rockwell talkback
Quezon,757,2,maxinerae,,160.0,ltbx,"In the current Bayaniverse, this is my favorite"
Quezon,757,3,maxinerae,,160.0,ltbx,"For one, it's an entirely different approach compared to the first two films: Heneral Luna and Goyo"
Quezon,757,4,maxinerae,,160.0,ltbx,"Secondly, the choice to make it look Hollywood as it was set in the American era of colonization in the PH tickled my brain"

Quezon,769,2,oninlouis,,140.0,ltbx,"The pacing might be gentler, but the storytelling and performances more than make up for it"
Quezon,769,3,oninlouis,,140.0,ltbx,"The cast delivered strong portrayals that captured both the humanity and complexity of the historical figures, and the musical score complemented the drama beautifully"
Quezon,769,4,oninlouis,,140.0,ltbx,The production values were impressive as well
Quezon,769,5,oninlouis,,140.0,ltbx,"They may not be Hollywood-level in terms of scale, but they are undeniably Filipino in spirit and craftsmanship"

Quezon,769,8,oninlouis,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon, one that’s often overshadowed by his more famous political achievements"
Quezon,769,9,oninlouis,,140.0,ltbx,"I also just learned that Quezon was a lawyer, and as a lawyer myself, it was fascinating to see how he was able to “play the game,” navigating from being a trial lawyer to eventually becoming the President of the Philippines"
Quezon,769,10,oninlouis,,140.0,ltbx,It added another layer of depth and respect for his intellect and political skill
Quezon,769,11,oninlouis,,140.0,ltbx,"Having just been to Bataan last week for a historical and heritage trip, I felt an even deeper connection to the story and the period it depicted"
Quezon,769,12,oninlouis,,140.0,ltbx,"I was also fortunate enough to have seen Quezon’s Game a few years ago, and watching Quezon felt like seeing a grander, more expansive retelling of that same chapter in our history"

Quezon,769,14,oninlouis,,140.0,ltbx,"Overall, Quezon might not rely on action or spectacle, but it delivers a story that deepens our understanding of one of the key figures in our nation’s history"

Quezon,785,2,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,"The story-telling was incredible, following the movies made by Nadia with some scenes being her movie, while others being ""real life"""
Quezon,785,3,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,"The way scenes were shot in ""real life"" in the style of a silent movie was genuinely so unique to me that it caught my eye"
Quezon,785,4,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,The merge of styles through out the entire movie all fit perfectly as well as contrasted each other well
Quezon,785,5,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,"Secondly, which is probably the most obvious, I enjoyed the perspective this movie gives towards not just Quezon but politics in general"
Quezon,785,6,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,"I have heard the criticism about the fantasies this movie merges into what is the ""truth"", but I argue that is the point"
Quezon,785,7,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,"The proper approach to movies like this is that after watching it, it should encourage you to research on your own"
Quezon,785,8,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,"Be interested, be curious, and compare it to the life we live in"
Quezon,785,9,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,It brings Filipinos awareness back to the Philippines and our history

Quezon,785,11,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,"Of course, I have to mention the incredible acting of Jericho Rosales, Romnick Sarmenta, Mon Confiado, Therese Malvar, and the rest of the amazing cast"
Quezon,785,12,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,They brought these characters to life
Quezon,785,13,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,"There was a lot of debate about whether or not Jericho Rosales was the right fit for Quezon, but he did astoundingly well"

Quezon,785,15,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,I am extremely attached to the style this movie had
Quezon,785,16,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,"Its use of colors, cinematography, and even sound were foundational to the narrative"
Quezon,785,17,cionastra,,200.0,ltbx,"The final scene, with quezon's quote of ""I am the Filipino People, I am the Philippines"

Quezon,812,5,nothisispatrck,,120.0,ltbx,Sadly I wasnt as engrossed with this as the general public seemed to be
Quezon,812,6,nothisispatrck,,120.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales' acting felt like it was teetering over the edge of becoming a bayaniverse parody instead of an actual historical drama
Quezon,812,7,nothisispatrck,,120.0,ltbx,Wasnt sold on the storytelling gimmick either
Quezon,812,8,nothisispatrck,,120.0,ltbx,The constant timeline jumps and incoherent pacing made this feel more like a crash course of Quezon's life than a fully realized narrative
Quezon,812,9,nothisispatrck,,120.0,ltbx,Soooo seated for the Magsaysay movie tho
Quezon,813,1,sine_han,,160.0,ltbx,"serging and manolito doomed yaoikidding aside, the film only got better as it went on, especially towards the middle as quezon planted seeds in various places chasing after power"
Quezon,813,2,sine_han,,160.0,ltbx,dialogue and script was great and kept me thoroughly engaged almost from beginning to end
Quezon,813,3,sine_han,,160.0,ltbx,it was just a bit rough at the start for me to get into + why is leonard wood british
Quezon,813,4,sine_han,,160.0,ltbx,"adding a heart to my rating as i have high praise for how the film was edited and scored by the director, coloured, and captured"

Quezon,818,1,pelickula,,160.0,ltbx,"Given it's runtime, it would have been nice to spend less time on the campaign trail and more focus behind the motives and machinations of the other characters - especially Osmeña given his portrayal of second-guessing his multiple alliances with Quezon"

Quezon,831,1,_just_jac0b,,160.0,ltbx,hold awn this aint about quezon
Quezon,832,1,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"The Questions of QuezonThroughout Jerold Tarog's trilogy, he raises important questions about heroism — and in Quezon (2025), he explores it not as an absolute truth but as a matter of perception"
Quezon,832,2,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"Sa dami ng na-trigger at nabuong kontrobersya, it begs the question: handa na nga ba tayo sa malayang diskusyon tungkol dito"
Quezon,832,4,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,” The very ideal that Quezon and his forerunners fought and died for is finally within reach — pero paano ito aabutin ng bagong magiging presidente
Quezon,832,5,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"The film thrives in the space between conflicting morals, fitting for a morally obsessed country riddled with corruption"
Quezon,832,6,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,Alin nga ba ang mas epektibo
Quezon,832,7,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,Idealismo or realidad
Quezon,832,8,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"The film is generous in portraying the old man's charm, eloquence, and impeccable sense of style"
Quezon,832,9,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"But in true Tarog fashion, he wasn't safe from being questioned either"
Quezon,832,10,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"Beneath the charisma lies his vanity, a leader fully aware of his strength and uses it to advance his ambitions -- whether for his country or for himself, who knows"
Quezon,832,11,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"Tarog's meta approach, blending fiction and history is a tricky but effective device"
Quezon,832,12,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"Nadia's films-within-the-film reveal two sides of the story, the same way Tarog does throughout his trilogy"
Quezon,832,13,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,The film doesn’t just retell the past; it exposes how the narratives we accept as truth are constructed
Quezon,832,14,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"Gaano nga ba kalaki ang papel ng media, pelikula, o ngayon, ng TikTok sa politika ng bansa"
Quezon,832,15,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"What remains unclear, however, is the role of the Americans in the narrative"
Quezon,832,16,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"I didn’t quite appreciate how Governor Wood sort of became a ""father figure"" to the away-bati childishness of Quezon and Osmeña"
Quezon,832,17,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,Wasn’t this separation engineered by the ’Kano themselves
Quezon,832,18,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"In today's battle against fake news, sensationalism and historical accuracy, Quezon's creative licenses may be a double-edged sword"
Quezon,832,19,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,But honestly
Quezon,832,20,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,To hell with it
Quezon,832,21,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,It's a triumph of Filipino filmmaking
Quezon,832,22,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"It provokes, divides, and gets us all talking"
Quezon,832,23,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"Quezon doesn’t claim to be the truth, but it forces us to question who gets to tell it"
Quezon,832,24,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"So really, what is there to lose"
Quezon,832,25,dabidabidan,,,ltbx,"---------On a lighter note, as a tubong Quezon myself, I have to say — Echo nailed Quezon’s American English accent of that time, but not quite his Tayabasing Tagalog"
Quezon,833,1,nicolenkey,,160.0,ltbx,nakakalungkot at ang hirap sikmurain kung paano lang ginagawang palaruan ng mga trapong pulitiko ang gobyerno
Quezon,833,2,nicolenkey,,160.0,ltbx,tayong mga mamamayan ay para lamang mga piyesa sa isang laro ng chess—nahahati sa dalawang panig at minamanipula
Quezon,833,3,nicolenkey,,160.0,ltbx,"sa huli, tayo ang talo at sila pa ring mga gahaman ang panalo dahil lalaruin lang ulit nila tayo"
Quezon,833,4,nicolenkey,,160.0,ltbx,"ika nga ni aguinaldo, maraming pulitiko sa bansa, kakaunti ang lingkod-bayan"
Quezon,834,1,yujiyoji,,180.0,ltbx,70 pesos vs 5 pesos
Quezon,835,1,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon provides an unbiased but contentious retelling of the titular character’s rise and fall in Philippine politics, his undeniable influence and charm, and his lasting impact in the country’s bid for independence"
Quezon,835,2,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite the title, the film was not a glorification, but a critique on the character that is Manuel L"
Quezon,835,3,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon, the second president of the Philippines"
Quezon,835,4,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,"Because while it was he who sought for Philippine independence, history tells us he might have done it in the not so cleanest of ways"
Quezon,835,5,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,"While charming and influential, he was also brutal, unrelenting, and felt like he was Thanos or Darth Vader at times"
Quezon,835,6,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,The storytelling was great
Quezon,835,7,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,Using film to backtrack the history of Quezon from his humble beginnings to his rise to presidency was really a good touch
Quezon,835,8,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,It also really helped in presenting the exposition and Philippine history without it seeming like it was forced
Quezon,835,9,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,It was like watching an educational film within a film
Quezon,835,10,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,"It was really paced well, too, as it divided chapters of Quezon’s life based on his political enemies at the time – it was like watching him go up the political ranks as he beat one adversary after another"
Quezon,835,11,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,Each scene felt intentional and it didn’t feel like 2 hours have passed
Quezon,835,12,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,"Like any other historical account, this film took some big creative liberties as well"
Quezon,835,13,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,"While it could be really good for dramatic effect and inducing a reaction, it could also spark controversy and be misconstrued as the truth"
Quezon,835,14,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,"With this, I thought some of the choices could’ve stuck to the truth and just exaggerated them a bit"
Quezon,835,15,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,"But all in all, Quezon is a great film for both the casual audience and history buffs"
Quezon,835,16,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,It’s a good critique on the character of Manuel Quezon and as well as on all the political figures surrounding him at the time
Quezon,835,17,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,"At the same time, it’s also a good way to learn about the history of the Philippines, its political landscape, and its journey to independence"
Quezon,835,18,jellobee,,160.0,ltbx,STAY FOR THE MID-CREDITS SCENE
Quezon,836,1,heymay9,,140.0,ltbx,sergio “marupok” osmeña

Quezon,839,1,nicasison,,120.0,ltbx,"Totoo nga na napakaraming pulitiko sa bansa, ngunit iilan lamang ang tunay na naglilingkod para sa bayan"
Quezon,839,2,nicasison,,120.0,ltbx,"Mula noon hanggang ngayon, tila naging laro na lang ang pulitika ng gobyerno"
Quezon,839,3,nicasison,,120.0,ltbx,"One dynasty over the other, one pig over the other, and the cycle goes on"
Quezon,839,4,nicasison,,120.0,ltbx,Nakalulungkot isipin na marami pa rin sa atin ang patuloy na nabibighani at nalilinlang ng mga ganitong sistema
Quezon,840,1,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"watched this for the second time for quezmeña, how can i make my review 10/5"
Quezon,841,1,tescypher,,140.0,ltbx,old man yaoi
Quezon,842,1,ariaquinn,,160.0,ltbx,what in the quezon x osmena bl just happened
Quezon,842,2,ariaquinn,,160.0,ltbx,quezon's story just shows how corruption is deeply ingrained in ph politics and how clever manipulation tactics are rooted in our political landscape
Quezon,843,1,aintdeah,,200.0,ltbx,finallyyy after 7 long years huhu had been looking forward to this day to watch this film and it started sa lq ni quezon at serging

Quezon,844,1,alesandra88,,200.0,ltbx,The best Ending to the Bayaniverse cant wait to see how this connects to the upcoming biopic of Magsaysay
Quezon,845,1,iyawanders,,120.0,ltbx,Great film and I enjoy the sassy and lightheartedness of the film
Quezon,845,2,iyawanders,,120.0,ltbx,But I wish they tried to be as historically accurate as possible
Quezon,845,3,iyawanders,,120.0,ltbx,"As someone who doesn’t know much about Quezon, I wanted to be educated… now I have to research what part is fiction and not"
Quezon,846,1,pulcinellas,,140.0,ltbx,quezmeña dom-sub dynamic is definitely a choice
Quezon,847,1,sunsxleil,,160.0,ltbx,"that was very entertaining, actually"
Quezon,847,2,sunsxleil,,160.0,ltbx,a refreshing change of setting from watching the news (i'm kidding
Quezon,847,3,sunsxleil,,160.0,ltbx,kind of)
Quezon,847,4,sunsxleil,,160.0,ltbx,masterful performances
Quezon,847,5,sunsxleil,,160.0,ltbx,i was hooked until the very end
Quezon,848,1,reallov3baby,,160.0,ltbx,"SOBRANG LATE Q NA NA-LOG pero watched this w/ jhaz & alice sa uptc hehehe so core memory n rin  sobrang benta nito sa’kin in terms of style PERO medyo misleading nga siya in terms of the historical context kasi nagustuhan ko man yung character ni joven, parang minsan mas napupunta na sa kanya yung focus nung istorya kaya baka isipin ng karamihan sa audience na hindi familiar sa time period na ‘to in philippine history na totoo siyang tao… still, sobrang sobrang sobrang enticing ng pagka-shoot nito AND BASTA BET Q LNG TLAGA UNG OVERALL STYLE NA GINAMIT NILA, d music, costumes, & colors were all so tea  sa madaling salita, na-enjoy q i2 & i just want 2 say na i  jc santos (kahit parang five minutes or less pa nga ata lang yung screen time niya throughout the entire runtime"
Quezon,849,1,camoteque,,140.0,ltbx,This was surprisingly entertaining to watch
Quezon,849,2,camoteque,,140.0,ltbx,Love the structure and presentation of every scene
Quezon,849,3,camoteque,,140.0,ltbx,"Not to mention Gregorio ""The Goat"" Aglipay made an unexpected cameo"
Quezon,849,4,camoteque,,140.0,ltbx,I had fun
Quezon,850,1,aoifer_mov,,200.0,ltbx,tbh i didnt know what to say during the movie
Quezon,850,2,aoifer_mov,,200.0,ltbx,i was unsure what to even feel while watching kasi i don’t really know how Quezon lead the Philippines during his term as the president
Quezon,850,3,aoifer_mov,,200.0,ltbx,its a really good movie and i dont want to spoil it too much
Quezon,850,4,aoifer_mov,,200.0,ltbx,pero fr its a must watch talaga i would be so so glad if i had the chance to watch it again
Quezon,851,1,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"i really wanted to love this film, i was looking forward to it"
Quezon,851,2,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"i did enjoy watching it, both as a film and for its historical subject"
Quezon,851,3,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"the performances were really good, i can see that the actors really enjoyed playing their roles"
Quezon,851,4,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,the story was a bit meta as well which i liked
Quezon,851,5,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,but the film had a lot going for it that really held it back
Quezon,851,6,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,the production felt rushed
Quezon,851,7,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,the actor for wood was wasted with so few scenes showing him
Quezon,851,8,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"the story also spanned too wide a period, leaving no room for additional context as to what was happening in the film"
Quezon,851,9,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"i knew the historical context behind those scenes, but i doubt the same can be said of the general public"
Quezon,851,10,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,then there's the narrative itself
Quezon,851,11,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,one issue that really bothers me with this trilogy is how they portray the americans as reasonable
Quezon,851,12,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,that scene where wood was talking to some locals and how they exclaimed that independence was good enough to eat was icky
Quezon,851,13,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,what exactly is that scene supposed to mean
Quezon,851,14,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,it feels patronizing
Quezon,851,15,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,and how they felt quezon even more so
Quezon,851,16,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"that he was manipulative, shrewd, was already known"
Quezon,851,17,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,the director said he wanted to humanize him
Quezon,851,18,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,but quezon had no redeeming qualities in the film
Quezon,851,19,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,he had no arc
Quezon,851,20,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"actually, if you look at all three movies, all the leading characters had no arcs"
Quezon,851,21,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"they lived and ended their films with nothing about them having changed, nor something interesting shown about them"
Quezon,851,22,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"luna was a hothead, goyo was a womanizer, and quezon was conniving"
Quezon,851,23,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,luna being this unwavering patriot didnt make sense to me
Quezon,851,24,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"he ratted out on the katipunan at first, and only joined the revolution when it was finally against the americans"
Quezon,851,25,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"goyo felt too small a figure that even in his own film, the focus wasnt on him, it was on aguinaldo and mabini (granted, that the trilogy was more of aguinaldo's arc, than the figures important to his story)"
Quezon,851,26,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"and quezon, for all his and his colleagues' shrewdness, won ph independence from a country so reluctant to recognize it"
Quezon,851,27,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,that it played into their ambition shouldnt faze us from recognizing the monumental task ahead of them
Quezon,851,28,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"these figures are not beyond reproach, nor are the films wrong from portraying them the way they were portrayed"
Quezon,851,29,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"there are just elements in these films, that quezon really amplify, that prevent them from reaching their potential"
Quezon,851,30,racoverano,,120.0,ltbx,"these movies have moved the discourse, both in history and in film far, but could not any further"
Quezon,852,1,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,Different from the last two films (more like a semi satirical biopic compared to a hero story)
Quezon,852,2,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,"But I LOVED the camera work, framing, cuts, and cinematography"
Quezon,852,3,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,"It was so good, some shots reminded me of Wes Anderson"
Quezon,852,4,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,"The storytelling and pacing were okay as well, and it's interesting how the protagonist this time isn't necessarily the ""good guy"""
Quezon,852,5,triplecrong,,160.0,ltbx,A lot of drama involved and it makes me want to do my own research about this history
Quezon,853,1,marckryancidro,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s a masterfully crafted yet morally complex film that dares to strip a national hero of sanctity and reveal him as flawed, strategic, and deeply human"
Quezon,853,2,marckryancidro,,160.0,ltbx,"Visually stunning and bold in its storytelling, it reimagines Quezon not as a savior, but as the architect of the very system that made such saviors necessary"
Quezon,853,3,marckryancidro,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales delivers a remarkable performance—his Quezon feels layered, seamlessly shifting from statesman to tactician with effortless charm"
Quezon,853,4,marckryancidro,,160.0,ltbx,"You can sense the performance behind the persona, the fragility behind the power"
Quezon,853,5,marckryancidro,,160.0,ltbx,"For me, Quezon isn’t really a takedown of a hero; it’s a mirror"
Quezon,853,6,marckryancidro,,160.0,ltbx,"It forces us to see how the leaders we admire, and even the systems we live in, are built by people as fragile and flawed as we are"
Quezon,853,7,marckryancidro,,160.0,ltbx,And maybe that’s what makes it sting—because it feels true
Quezon,854,1,gnomeitaly,,140.0,ltbx,best in the trilogy kasi may pinaiyak na apo
Quezon,855,1,perezmnicole,,160.0,ltbx,"diff style compared to the last two films, but v well played out"
Quezon,855,2,perezmnicole,,160.0,ltbx,story is also still v relevant in today's political landscape + Quezon Osmena
Quezon,856,1,pillsc,,200.0,ltbx,I've watched this in the cinema with my 3 relatives and 2 strangers at the back
Quezon,856,2,pillsc,,200.0,ltbx,I can't tell if they enjoyed it or they were just making out quietly
Quezon,857,1,galahadbond007,,140.0,ltbx,Tarog’s bayaniverse trilogy ends in a more implicating interpretation of a hero than his two previous films
Quezon,857,2,galahadbond007,,140.0,ltbx,There is no ambiguity in Quezon’s machiavellian journey to power
Quezon,857,3,galahadbond007,,140.0,ltbx,Rosales treads close to a mere impersonation while Confiado shines through his restraint
Quezon,857,4,galahadbond007,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon’s portrayal is flat compared to Luna’s and Goyo’s because unlike the latter, the former is not portrayed as a human with flaws but simply a wretched opportunist fueled by greed and ego"
Quezon,857,5,galahadbond007,,140.0,ltbx,Luna’s populist portrayal is balanced with his sincere desire to fight colonialism
Quezon,857,6,galahadbond007,,140.0,ltbx,Goyo’s naïveté is tempered by his youthful idealism
Quezon,857,7,galahadbond007,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon, on the other hand, shows no redeeming factor"
Quezon,857,8,galahadbond007,,140.0,ltbx,"All in all, the conclusion to the trilogy reiterates that meeting your heroes is less glamorous than it seems"
Quezon,858,1,reimen,,100.0,ltbx,idk man
Quezon,858,2,reimen,,100.0,ltbx,i'd say it's politically good but the rest is meh
Quezon,858,3,reimen,,100.0,ltbx,I guess it's a good day to be a journalist

Quezon,860,1,yapping_movies,,160.0,ltbx,"In this age, to be able to watched Quezon in the cinema is worth it"
Quezon,860,2,yapping_movies,,160.0,ltbx,"Each cinematography is gorgeous, the casts are just perfect, and the story line is just raw"
Quezon,860,3,yapping_movies,,160.0,ltbx,They even show how quackery is normal (and up until now) in our government

Quezon,861,4,triedandtrue__,,120.0,ltbx,"Can't speak about the historical accuracy, it's up to us to research abt that as it was said sa beginning ng film that there was a sprinkle of fiction in it"
Quezon,862,1,shiijee,,140.0,ltbx,"The best film in the trilogy, both creatively and technically"
Quezon,862,2,shiijee,,140.0,ltbx,It feels timely and deeply reflective of our current reality
Quezon,862,3,shiijee,,140.0,ltbx,"The performances are compelling, and the film plays like a love letter to cinema, reminds me some moments akin to Citizen Kane and The Godfather Part II"
Quezon,862,4,shiijee,,140.0,ltbx,"Yet, its wide creative liberties blur the line between truth and fiction, inviting viewers to question and research what they have just seen"
Quezon,862,5,shiijee,,140.0,ltbx,"If this truly marks the end of the Bayaniverse, it stands as a powerful and fitting conclusion"

Quezon,864,1,chaimiji,,160.0,ltbx,i love love historical movies
Quezon,865,1,cheech16,,160.0,ltbx,A very worthy end to the Bayaniverse Trilogy and I grow to appreciate our flawed heroes more now
Quezon,865,2,cheech16,,160.0,ltbx,The call backs to the previous 2 movies not only makes it interconnected but also historically accurate as the death of Antonio Luna and Goyo being mislead were points used against Aguinaldo during his campaign
Quezon,865,3,cheech16,,160.0,ltbx,"Also really liked the character of arc of Joven, from an observer to a journalist, as he is now more present in this story who plays an important role in the plot"
Quezon,865,4,cheech16,,160.0,ltbx,"Though the movie paints an ugly picture of Quezon, I still see the humanity of a man that truly fought for the Philippines independence which is something we cannot deny"
Quezon,865,5,cheech16,,160.0,ltbx,"We also have accept that corruption, greed and deception is not new in filipino politics for it tells us that it began a long time ago but we have a lot of history of mistakes and failures to look back on to learn"

Quezon,871,1,revirevirevi,,180.0,ltbx,"Very evident that this film had a budget, and it delivered well"
Quezon,871,2,revirevirevi,,180.0,ltbx,"It was noticeably different from the first two films of the trilogy, and this was a nice conclusion to the Bayaniverse"
Quezon,871,3,revirevirevi,,180.0,ltbx,"My takeaway from this film would be ""You cannot remove politics from people, and you can never remove people from politics"
Quezon,872,1,gwaynnnn,,140.0,ltbx,"Antagal kong hinintay to grabe hahahaA WORK OF FICTION BASED ON FACTS My former history professor told us this is the most important thing to remember about these films (hereal luna, goyo)"

Quezon,872,3,gwaynnnn,,140.0,ltbx,So i suggest to research more about the characters and events after watching the movies
Quezon,873,1,asphodelfleur,,160.0,ltbx,"no bloodshed, only bloodshed with words"
Quezon,873,2,asphodelfleur,,160.0,ltbx,"clever film, and though i did not have time to rewatch the last 2 films, everything else was pieced together"

Quezon,876,1,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,What a wonderfully nasty piece of work that portrays things in such a devilishly entertaining way
Quezon,876,2,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"It was fun watching the politics in this movie portrayed in such a darkly comedic, performative, and theatrical way (especially the first half)"
Quezon,876,3,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"The way everything seems so ultra rehearsed, the way they move, the way they’re blocked, etc"
Quezon,876,4,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,together with some lively camera work created for such a weirdly unserious yet engaging experience
Quezon,876,5,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"Though its chronological sequencing was a bit confusing at the start, and it’s pretty easy to get lost in what point of time we’re in"
Quezon,876,6,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s funny too because these people are determining the future and current state of the country, yet it’s just a game to them; a stupidly intricate, dangerous game for power on who yaps and complains the loudest, all while Americans meddle with everything (as they always have), so it was over when Quezon stated that he learned from them"
Quezon,876,7,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,The biggest compliment I’d give is how this movie lowkey had some balls
Quezon,876,8,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,I did NOT expect it to paint characters the way they did
Quezon,876,9,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"They imply a shocking amount of things, and just straight up show how disgusting and slimy people were, albeit really smart and strategic for the worse"
Quezon,876,10,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"The foundation of this country, and its current systems have always been stained by foreigners (particularly the Americans), and it continues to be"
Quezon,876,11,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"Deny it all you want, the worst country in the world has that much power because it convinced the world that it does"
Quezon,876,12,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"The same way the loudest people always have, or end up, with some level of power"
Quezon,876,13,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"That’s Philippine politics for y’all; a loud, nasty, slimy game where the occupiers are always somehow the winners despite what people want to believe"
Quezon,876,14,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"Where the nastiest ones always somehow win, and it’s because they know how to play this deranged, ugly game incredibly well"
Quezon,876,15,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"A game that sadly demands you surrender your morals for survival, and that survival turns into a disgusting lust for power"
Quezon,876,16,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,The worst guy you know won the game because the system favors them
Quezon,876,17,bigstinkpoop,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, Ramon Magsaysay will appear in Avengers Doomsday"

Quezon,893,1,maching,,200.0,ltbx,Recommended this to my senior parents and they said it was very very entertaining despite mostly just dialogue
Quezon,893,2,maching,,200.0,ltbx,I concur
Quezon,893,3,maching,,200.0,ltbx,"It's funny, infuriarating, enlightening and memorable"
Quezon,893,4,maching,,200.0,ltbx,It's also beautifully-shot
Quezon,893,5,maching,,200.0,ltbx,You can tell the filmmakers cared about the material
Quezon,894,1,nicocollantes,,160.0,ltbx,"Well, that was entertaining and insightful"
Quezon,894,2,nicocollantes,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales gave a career-best performance, along with the ensemble cast"
Quezon,894,3,nicocollantes,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, Mon Confiado and Cris Villanueva is great in this"
Quezon,894,4,nicocollantes,,160.0,ltbx,I just wished it delved deeply into Manuel's story
Quezon,894,5,nicocollantes,,160.0,ltbx,"But overall, it's a strong final entry in the Bayaniverse"
Quezon,894,6,nicocollantes,,160.0,ltbx,"Now, I do get now why the grandson got mad"
Quezon,894,7,nicocollantes,,160.0,ltbx,"But, motherfucker he just proved the movie's point instead of handling it properly like what Pinky Amador did"

Quezon,895,1,sweetspaghett,,140.0,ltbx,"i like the addition of the character of Joven and Nadia, especially the portions of silent films"
Quezon,895,2,sweetspaghett,,140.0,ltbx,The movie looked theatrical and the acting was really good
Quezon,895,3,sweetspaghett,,140.0,ltbx,"However, the pacing confuses me"
Quezon,895,4,sweetspaghett,,140.0,ltbx,"The timeline kind of jumps on from one point to another in a fast paced moments, so it's a little hard to understand the scenes"
Quezon,896,1,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,This film should have been submitted to film festivals
Quezon,896,2,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,A testament
Quezon,896,3,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,"This is great, the best in the Bayaniverse trilogy by Jerrold Tarog and let me tell you how this trilogy, you can start with anything basically and you don't need to watch everything"
Quezon,896,4,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,Watching this was like Scorsese meets Philippine History and I salute Jerrold Tarog and he did put his mix in the bag
Quezon,896,5,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,I am glad that this film wasn't propaganda as it was basically no filter and they showed us plain history
Quezon,896,6,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,"I really salute the cast as they showed their absolute best, especially the main and returning characters of the Bayaniverse trilogy; They all excelled and was at their peak performance in this film and considering this, Yes, this is my favorite and the best film in the bayaniverse trilogy"
Quezon,896,7,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,"I found myself very engaged with this film and I have to thank the writers and actors and just a special mention, Benjamin Alves who tried his best to keep up with Jericho Rosales' performance (He was really great by the way)"
Quezon,896,8,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,"Everyone was great in this film, Mon Confiado, and Romnick Sarmenta, just special shout outs but everyone was great"
Quezon,896,9,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,"Visually speaking too, it was great"
Quezon,896,10,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,"It is a shock that this is better than most films in our local film festivals and hopefully, this kickstarts us back to Philippine Cinema, together with Lav Diaz' Magellan as we Filipino's really specialize in Drama"
Quezon,896,11,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,Watch this
Quezon,896,12,tinopay,,200.0,ltbx,Ricky Avanceña says otherwise but just watch it
Quezon,897,1,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,It’s been a while since we’ve seen a political film that brings us back to our senses and challenges what it means to be patriotic
Quezon,897,2,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,"(Maybe Gomburza tho) Quezon is a fresh film that introspects on the evils in both society and ourselves, and how we even play our role in corruption"
Quezon,897,3,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,I loved that Quezon is humanized as someone who had to play the game against bigger evils
Quezon,897,4,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,"Props to the super creative use of storytelling devices and other details, like Joven (journalist), newspapers, and films (all seemingly inspired from Citizen Kane)"
Quezon,897,5,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,"Much like Kane too, Quezon’s character reveals itself and his ambitions piece by piece, shifting our perception of him until his death"
Quezon,897,6,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,The film does quite have a spoonfed narrative though
Quezon,897,7,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,The script tends to overexplain its themes and motivations
Quezon,897,8,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,"Great that it makes everything more digestible to the general public, but it also takes away some subtlety"
Quezon,897,9,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,"The cast is solid and GOATEDD, and special shoutout to DOP Pong Ignacio"
Quezon,897,10,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,Lighting and cameras were crazy
Quezon,897,11,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,The production design also makes everything feels so real
Quezon,897,12,mendozaluigi,,120.0,ltbx,Excited for the next Bayaniverse
Quezon,898,1,_eaniiverse,,160.0,ltbx,"campy, total 180 of typical 'Bayani' films and serves as like a formal apology to Aguinaldo"
Quezon,899,1,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,This film was indeed a pandora's box as how Mr
Quezon,899,2,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,Avancena worded it
Quezon,899,3,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"I came into the movie theater full of enthusiasm to watch it, but I came out full of questions, undecided if I was to believe the narrative, and unsatisfied"
Quezon,899,4,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"Upon going home, I had to research the next days about the veracity of this film"
Quezon,899,5,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,The film juxtaposed several elements of different timeframes such as colorized and non-colorized cinema to show the antagonist Quezon and the underdog Osmena narrative
Quezon,899,6,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,It showed how Quezon tried to politick the Filipinos and Osmena (the Americans included)just to gain the seat for President
Quezon,899,7,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,This also portrayed that patronage politics might have started in Quezon's time
Quezon,899,8,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"However, just like the other Bayaniverse series, it is for the viewer to discern which part of the film was true or not because the disclaimer was only put in the beginning of the film"
Quezon,899,9,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"Thus, the viewers nee to read and research further"
Quezon,899,10,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"After watching the film, I also had the thought that publishing a book might not do so much after the trending phase of this film because in the era of social media, a book would not reach the same level of viewers that the film would reach especially if this will be released on online streaming platforms"
Quezon,899,11,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"On my part, it would be better if I would be able to read the researched part even on a blog online"
Quezon,899,12,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"The cast played well on their roles as Osmena, Quezon, and Aguinaldo"
Quezon,899,13,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"Other made up characters like Nadia and Joven, complemented the storyline"
Quezon,899,14,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,There was even a point where Nadia herself made fun of Quezon's traits
Quezon,899,15,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,The main characters copied even the intonation of the politicians
Quezon,899,16,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"Overall, it was a good film, but for a full length film, it feels incomplete"
Quezon,899,17,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"For a film just to end with ""I am the Philippines"", it feels unnatural"
Quezon,899,18,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"Well and good, Quezon died in America so there was really no good ending"
Quezon,899,19,filmstrip80s,,80.0,ltbx,"But given that this was a mix of fiction and history, I hope they showed at least a memory of Quezon's memorial"

Quezon,901,9,virgopearleye,,200.0,ltbx,"true heroism consists not in holding such power but in selflessly using it for the welfare of the people (rightfully so), and it is upon us to remind these “heroes” that real greatness pertains to the Filipino people who continue to fight, hope, and demand a better nation"

Quezon,906,2,casuallypia,,160.0,ltbx,"But on a serious note, this movie is a different tone from Heneral Luna and Goyo"
Quezon,906,3,casuallypia,,160.0,ltbx,"The cinematography, soundtrack, and way of storytelling is a shift from the first two movies thus giving the viewers the feeling of entering and being in a new era of the Philippines"
Quezon,906,4,casuallypia,,160.0,ltbx,"It's purely the political aspect, the way campaigns are nowadays in the Philippines could be traced back to Quezon"
Quezon,906,5,casuallypia,,160.0,ltbx,"Additionally, this movie is a question of hermenuetics - which interpretation of history do you find true"
Quezon,906,6,casuallypia,,160.0,ltbx,"I could see why the movie is controversial, however, the interpretation is valid"
Quezon,906,7,casuallypia,,160.0,ltbx,It is just a matter of which one do you find truthful - Quezon as a hero of the Filipino people or a man hungry for power

Quezon,914,2,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,Here it is:“Hindi ka hari
Quezon,914,3,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,”“Sigurado ka
Quezon,914,4,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,”In this film we unravel the first President of the Philippines in a time where we never really knew what independence or being free meant
Quezon,914,5,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,It was just simply a glittery word we acquainted with being free from Americans and establishing our own rule
Quezon,914,6,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,As far as I am aware 1935 was an establishment of a commonwealth to transition to 1946 which was our genuine independence as a nation
Quezon,914,7,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"We see this film through a sort of journalistic storytelling lenses of Joven Hernando (a fictional character), as he threads through what he went through prior to this film and the aftermath of Goyo towards the time he was reporting Quezon’s senatorial endeavors, his run for presidency, and unspooling the threads of who and what Quezon is"
Quezon,914,8,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,What is Politics
Quezon,914,9,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,What is Patronage Politics
Quezon,914,10,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Politics has roots in Aristotle’s work, Politika, a Greek word which consequently means things concerning the polis (city)"
Quezon,914,11,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"It is the ability by which one can use power, or direct influences to an individual, group, community, or a nation that a person “doing politics” busy themselves with"
Quezon,914,12,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,This occurs at all levels of a society
Quezon,914,13,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,Now what is patronage politics
Quezon,914,14,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Associations, positions, promotions, and contracts are based on personal connections and friendships rather than pure merit"
Quezon,914,15,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,This is also what we call the padrino system or clientelism
Quezon,914,16,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,Why am I highlighting this
Quezon,914,17,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"You may think of our so called Bayanis as the glorified images they were portrayed as and made up to be by textbooks, anecdotes, and so on"
Quezon,914,18,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"But, they are just as horrid and grotesque as any 21st century politician can be"
Quezon,914,19,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"As Quezon believed it, it was a game, and the trick was to cheat it"
Quezon,914,20,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Noble LiesIn the movie we see Joven and Quezon have a short argument about truth, their difference, and why it matters when they’ve attained a victory for independence or freedom"
Quezon,914,21,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"They reference many classic texts and philosophical concepts from which Quezon mentioned “mentira noble”, Spanish for a noble lie"
Quezon,914,22,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,This is a concept derived from Plato’s ‘The Republic’ in which Plato discusses that societies are built on such lies
Quezon,914,23,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"If the masses believe in something (independence), then there is something to fight for"
Quezon,914,24,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"(Krause, 2019) Which in the film he utilizes as a way to earn power and along the way do some good for those who have placed his trust on him"
Quezon,914,25,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Joven’s dialogue and realizations in contrast to this throughout the film reflects the audience’s gradual disposition over what can we believe from Quezon or in contemporary times, those who claim to have the nation’s best interests"
Quezon,914,26,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,Are Filipinos that fucking stupid
Quezon,914,27,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,The humor in the film is great
Quezon,914,28,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,Satire doesn’t necessarily mean a quality of being funny but just the moments that are spread sporadically throughout the film makes you smile and chuckle while also grappling with how twisted the butt of the jokes are
Quezon,914,29,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"There is this moment when Leonard Wood who went on a trip around the Philippines to survey whether the Filipinos were truly capable of independence asked a few townspeople along with his translator if they knew what independence meant, to which one replied that: “They become full (their stomach) from the thought of it,” I couldn’t help but laugh and overhear a chuckle from 1 other watcher besides me"
Quezon,914,30,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,(Albeit what I quoted is not direct as I am struggling remembering the exact line
Quezon,914,31,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,)So the question is are Filipinos stupid
Quezon,914,33,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"We believe the propagandas, the persuasive anecdotes, what others say, and what we say because we hope for nothing but the best for all of us"
Quezon,914,34,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"It is not our fault that those we place our trust in chooses to betray us—the same way Quezon did to Joven, the same way Quezon did to Aguinaldo, and the same way Aguinaldo did to Luna and Bonifacio"
Quezon,914,35,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,I cannot stress how we’re stuck in this perpetual loop and how deep-rooted such issue is
Quezon,914,36,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Alas, human nature and greed is a mystical thing, it surpasses all reasoning and thought"
Quezon,914,37,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"But, in this day and age, if you cannot use history and the information at your disposal to think rationally—you are a stupid Filipino"
Quezon,914,39,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"The WomenWhat is Aurora Quezon, Maria Agoncillo, and Carmen and Nadia Hernando’s role in all of this"
Quezon,914,40,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Well, to show the intricacies and persistence of women who stand at the shadows of history"
Quezon,914,41,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Aurora Quezon, behind the scenes is a woman who could stand her ground at the same level as Manuel Quezon"
Quezon,914,42,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Maria Agoncillo, becomes Aguinaldo’s anchor as he goes through the loss and dirty tactics done by Quezon"
Quezon,914,43,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,Carmen and Nadia are smart women whose integrity and careers are supported by their husband in a time where women were otherwise discouraged
Quezon,914,44,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,An article by the Lifestyle Inquirer goes into interviews with the respective actresses and provides valuable insight for these characters and how important they are
Quezon,914,45,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,You can search for it

Quezon,914,51,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,Their dynamic is like two academic rivals who do nothing but outdo each other and try to tolerate each other and when hurt make up for it
Quezon,914,52,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"For instance, the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act and the blatant copying of assignment but slightly changing the wording with the consequent Tydings-McDuffie Act all because Quezon wanted the credit when Hare-Hawes-Cutting was his idea"
Quezon,914,53,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Finally…“Maybe it’s about proving what you can do, instead of proving what is right"
Quezon,914,54,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"” — Carmen HernandoShe’s right, at the end of the day why should these politicians never fulfill and serve their own interests"
Quezon,914,55,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"At this point it is an interplay of psychological warfare, scheming, power play, and gaining something out of their endeavors whether it be favors, money, or something to leverage themselves further"
Quezon,914,56,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"But how will we, as a country move on forward with confidence and trust towards those who govern us when betrayal is in the table"
Quezon,914,57,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,When the nation’s interests aren’t fulfilled
Quezon,914,58,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,When they are the sole reason we can’t get ourselves out of this damning rut
Quezon,914,59,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Perhaps this 21st century we ask, if there is a 22nd century will the Filipinos then, be able to live a better life"
Quezon,914,60,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Because I have seen enough to say that in my lifetime at least, it’s never going to get any better"
Quezon,914,61,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Suffice to say, I loved this film"
Quezon,914,62,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,I availed of the ₱ 250

Quezon,914,64,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"If we talk about the technical aspects like: the direction, music, composition, casting, and wardrobe, they were all perfect"
Quezon,914,65,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,You’ll never think throughout watching that they chickened out with giving Quezon (2025) huge production value
Quezon,914,66,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"In a time where corruption is rampant in Philippine politics, well in retrospect it has always been, this film could not be any more relevant and timely"

Quezon,921,1,knghnry,,160.0,ltbx,A fitting conclusion to Tarog's trilogy attempting to define the Filipino hero: Quezon combines the heat of Heneral Luna and the introspection of Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral
Quezon,921,2,knghnry,,160.0,ltbx,"The film holds firm to the trilogy's assertion that our national heroes are not without fault, and that, perhaps, we regained our independence partly because of those faults"
Quezon,921,3,knghnry,,160.0,ltbx,"Manuel Quezon—like Luna and Del Pilar—feels flesh and blood here, capable of both heroism and monstrosities"

Quezon,923,1,makeenetics,,160.0,ltbx,"Jerrold Tarog closes his Bayaniverse trilogy with Quezon, a sharp, ambitious political drama that trades the gunfire of Heneral Luna and Goyo for quieter battles fought through charm, rhetoric, and image"
Quezon,923,2,makeenetics,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales completely disappears into the role, giving a performance that’s both commanding and unsettling"
Quezon,923,3,makeenetics,,160.0,ltbx,He plays Quezon not as a spotless hero but as a man who understands how leadership relies on performance
Quezon,923,4,makeenetics,,160.0,ltbx,The film doesn’t glorify him; it examines him
Quezon,923,5,makeenetics,,160.0,ltbx,"It shows how charisma can inspire and manipulate at the same time, and how power often hides behind elegance"
Quezon,923,6,makeenetics,,160.0,ltbx,"The movie looks beautiful, with careful production design, steady pacing, and clean editing that keeps even long political exchanges engaging"
Quezon,923,7,makeenetics,,160.0,ltbx,"Tarog’s direction is thoughtful and confident, peeling back Quezon’s myth not to tear it down but to reveal the man underneath that’s ambitious, flawed, and burdened by what it takes to lead"

Quezon,937,4,jhndrrck,,160.0,ltbx,"The production design, pacing and cinematography all feel meticulously crafted, it’s clear the team sought to challenge the idea of grand national myth and instead expose the power-games behind it"
Quezon,937,5,jhndrrck,,160.0,ltbx,"In doing so, Quezon invites us to see how legacy is manufactured, and how leadership is as much performance as service"
Quezon,937,6,jhndrrck,,160.0,ltbx,"I found the portrayal compelling and the moral ambiguity rich, making the film more than just a biopic"

Quezon,941,4,reannaheliz,,200.0,ltbx,it makes you think and decipher Quezon’s game as a leader and as a follower—especially compared to the books taught in school
Quezon,941,5,reannaheliz,,200.0,ltbx,also so much to ponder about how the Philippines had been placed in the not-so-rightful hands from the very start leading us up to this day with the same power-greedy and so-called heroes of our nation

Quezon,947,2,thepaintedstar,,160.0,ltbx,"I have a lot of thoughts on this as well as it's parallels to the ""Hamilton"" Broadway Musical, but I shan't divulge further"
Quezon,947,3,thepaintedstar,,160.0,ltbx,The only thing I would change about this is the use of the silent film aesthetic
Quezon,947,4,thepaintedstar,,160.0,ltbx,"At first, I liked it because it brought something new to the table and did tie well to the artistic intent to the film but as it went on, I felt like it somehow lost the plot"

Quezon,950,1,premierwolf,,200.0,ltbx,"The movie immediately brought to mind the political intrigue of the Netflix series House of Cards, but infused with the signature Tarog humor and quips"

Quezon,952,5,misscallculated,,160.0,ltbx,"I like how they portrayed Quezon: a politician through and through: knows how to play a game, used PR, used ads, used propaganda"
Quezon,952,6,misscallculated,,160.0,ltbx,"Technically he has the charisma (mestizo), uniqueness (maybe because mestizo nga, not as Filipino, Filipino), nerve – because in the movie he portrays really going after what he wants, and talent — he rose above the ranks from lawyer to president"
Quezon,952,7,misscallculated,,160.0,ltbx,"I didn’t see him as a bad person, but as a politician, so technically a bad person"

Quezon,952,11,misscallculated,,160.0,ltbx,"But I like that at the end, the media is aware of its rile and at the same time, still aware of its principles once awakened to see whats happening"
Quezon,952,12,misscallculated,,160.0,ltbx,"I like a quote about idolizing person that you may be blinded — ugh, I hope to capture the whole thing when it’s online"
Quezon,952,13,misscallculated,,160.0,ltbx,I can awfully relate because it’s also applicable to love
Quezon,952,14,misscallculated,,160.0,ltbx,I like the movie overall and it’s worth watching for

Quezon,953,10,ilovemymoose,,160.0,ltbx,"I always love a good non-linear story so that was extra fun to watch too, though I didn’t fully get it at first because I didn’t get to see the first few scenes"

Quezon,953,22,ilovemymoose,,160.0,ltbx,They always find a way to make these movies seem a bit gay
Quezon,953,25,ilovemymoose,,160.0,ltbx,I think this movie is way better than Goyo because that one honestly bored me (I know the quiet aesthetic was intentional but I didn't like it okay)
Quezon,953,26,ilovemymoose,,160.0,ltbx,But Heneral Luna is still my favorite
Quezon,953,27,ilovemymoose,,160.0,ltbx,Luna’s story just hits harder

Quezon,1003,25,lordgallenghein,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite that, you will never escape from any person who knows a real-life figure because they don't provide you with any consideration before the film was made"
Quezon,1003,26,lordgallenghein,,160.0,ltbx,"To respond to that fiasco, I dare to say that this film is worth watching for everybody who's not interested in or complains about it"
Quezon,1003,27,lordgallenghein,,160.0,ltbx,"The disclaimer says it all, and yet they roared for a boycott"
Quezon,1003,28,lordgallenghein,,160.0,ltbx,"But as long as Quezon tells you exactly what the director and writers had envisioned, the film is the representation of our struggle to handle our country due to lies and deception"

Quezon,1009,2,doubledolly,,160.0,ltbx,the smartest thing they did with this was give it that snappy dramatic treatment because otherwise you would really feel the 2+ hour run time
Quezon,1009,3,doubledolly,,160.0,ltbx,score was great and complimented the period really well
Quezon,1009,4,doubledolly,,160.0,ltbx,my only criticism (at least on the creative side) — SMOKE like you MEAN it

Quezon,1017,1,lemondoudrop,,160.0,ltbx,arguably the most thought provoking entry in the bayani-verse
Quezon,1017,2,lemondoudrop,,160.0,ltbx,quezon’s examination of how an ideal such as independence can be leveraged by ambitious individuals with delusions of grandeur isn’t exactly subtle although it doesn’t need to be

Quezon,1024,7,peachmangcpie,,140.0,ltbx,my simple explanation to her is that two truths can coexist

Quezon,1028,1,jkcarandang,,140.0,ltbx,It feels as though I was watching today’s news—only the characters were living in the Commonwealth era of the Philippines
Quezon,1028,2,jkcarandang,,140.0,ltbx,Is it a good biopic of Manuel Quezon
Quezon,1028,3,jkcarandang,,140.0,ltbx,One could say that
Quezon,1028,4,jkcarandang,,140.0,ltbx,Is it a good material for history education
Quezon,1028,5,jkcarandang,,140.0,ltbx,"Hmm, that’s debatable"
Quezon,1028,6,jkcarandang,,140.0,ltbx,But I’d rather focus on what the film shows: that the events of the past continue to happen in our present time
Quezon,1028,7,jkcarandang,,140.0,ltbx,And that’s what worries me the most
Quezon,1028,8,jkcarandang,,140.0,ltbx,Should Jerrold Tarog and the TBA Studios make more of these films
Quezon,1029,1,ocean_,,160.0,ltbx,It made me wonder if the Philippines is completely independent from USA
Quezon,1030,1,miechiechang,,160.0,ltbx,Made me research more about Quezon the whole week
Quezon,1030,2,miechiechang,,160.0,ltbx,Movie showed how plotting Quezon was as a politician and I do agree the movie's limited time made them only cut to negative sides of him
Quezon,1030,3,miechiechang,,160.0,ltbx,"Though I still see him at that light even after research, it would've been nice to see parts of him that hailed him as a ""hero"""

Quezon,1032,2,jayrlovesmovies,,180.0,ltbx,""" It feels surreal that I was watching Quezon for the second time while, at the same moment, around 800 kilometers away from Cebu, one of Quezon’s grandsons was throwing a fit toward the cast and crew for what he felt was a disrespectful portrayal of his grandfather"
Quezon,1032,3,jayrlovesmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s expected that his descendants would have mixed-to-negative feelings about this film, so I get where they’re coming from"
Quezon,1032,4,jayrlovesmovies,,180.0,ltbx,I think what held me back from…
Quezon,1033,1,christiankobe_,,140.0,ltbx,“How can you be a guardian of truth if you can only see one side
Quezon,1033,2,christiankobe_,,140.0,ltbx,”what a way to end the Bayaniverse trilogy with a banger ender: being a hero is all about perception
Quezon,1033,3,christiankobe_,,140.0,ltbx,"three movies later, i hope it gets to be an exercise for everyone to critically think about how we view the heroes we look up to and see them in a new light—stripped of all their laurels, flawed and utterly humanized; not because we want to taint their names and contributions, but because it opens our eyes to blind fanaticism"
Quezon,1033,4,christiankobe_,,140.0,ltbx,"to paraphrase Maria Ressa, it is only by knowing and having these facts will we have truth; truth that will build trust; all of which in pursuit of building a shared reality and thus democracy that will champion the country’s independence"
Quezon,1033,5,christiankobe_,,140.0,ltbx,"but until this government is infested by politicians instead of public servants, and until this country forgets to study and learn from its past, one shouldn’t be surprised to see this country still run like hell"

Quezon,1035,3,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,I wanted to like this
Quezon,1035,4,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,"It had its moments, and I get the idea it wanted to convey"
Quezon,1035,5,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,Quezon is a depiction of how Americans influenced Philippine politics into what it is today—for better or worse (mostly worse)
Quezon,1035,6,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,It was not a good painting of Manuel Quezon by any means
Quezon,1035,7,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,I grew up not really minding Philippine presidents
Quezon,1035,8,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,"Quezon, for me, felt like a decent person, someone who was deeply connected with the US—President of the Commonwealth"
Quezon,1035,9,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,The film depicted him as a sneaky politician who would do everything to stay in power
Quezon,1035,10,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,He was charismatic and had a way with his words and aura
Quezon,1035,11,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, the whole time I felt like I missed much more nuance in him"
Quezon,1035,12,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,I felt his characterization was too one-sided; it seemed like he was used as a plot point to get a point across
Quezon,1035,13,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,The film was actually confusing to follow at first due to the differing timelines
Quezon,1035,14,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,The problem with political films is that they tend to be biased from a certain point of view
Quezon,1035,15,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,This felt like one of those films
Quezon,1035,16,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,I wished I had seen a complex character—one who is a lion when he needs to be but perhaps also a person who genuinely believed in something
Quezon,1035,17,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,This was my first entry in the 'bayaniverse' by Tarog
Quezon,1035,18,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,"Perhaps most of what was depicted was true, but I think it left out some of the important parts of what made Quezon a fascinating Filipino president"
Quezon,1035,19,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,I did like the heart of what it wanted to depict
Quezon,1035,20,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,We live in a political regime where corporations are the boss and the leaders do things to stay in power—not for the people
Quezon,1035,21,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,The acting was not that good
Quezon,1035,22,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,"They hired a 'for the money' American actor, and the leads did not feel authentically Filipino"
Quezon,1035,23,sashimimojo,,100.0,ltbx,Or maybe the writing was just mid
Quezon,1036,1,theultmtfangirl,,160.0,ltbx,There's a sense of liberation in seeing heroes being portrayed in an unflattering light
Quezon,1036,2,theultmtfangirl,,160.0,ltbx,"It does not make them dislikeable per se, it makes them human, pulling them back to their core essence"

Quezon,1049,3,zychology,,120.0,ltbx,this film made me realize that Quezon’s charisma was power disguised as hope for independence in a suit
Quezon,1049,4,zychology,,120.0,ltbx,"either way, he sold it—and most filipinos bought it"
Quezon,1049,5,zychology,,120.0,ltbx,"every scene feels like it’s daring you to fall for him the same way the nation and even his enemies did: through his words, mind games, and dirty tricks"

Quezon,1051,3,mikel1921,,160.0,ltbx,"And I can't 100% speak to the factual accuracy in this picture (which makes sense because, at the end of the day, this is still just a movie)"
Quezon,1051,4,mikel1921,,160.0,ltbx,But I am glad that it's sparked even more conversations between my family and I about figures and events in Philippine history that are basically repeating themselves in the present
Quezon,1051,5,mikel1921,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, it helps to have a huge movie star attached to an otherwise flawed but still pretty entertaining story at the heart of Jerrold Tarog's latest addition to the Bayani-verse"
Quezon,1051,6,mikel1921,,160.0,ltbx,"Definitely recommend that more people watch Quezon, double check the data, and talk about the stuff they know (or think they know) because it's certainly got a lot of interesting ideas that are worthy of extended thought or discussion"

Quezon,1081,5,brinesolxn,,160.0,ltbx,And not the vloggers who currently plague our country with noise and misinformation
Quezon,1081,6,brinesolxn,,160.0,ltbx,This movie reminds us that truth-telling and integrity are far more powerful than fame or clicks
Quezon,1081,7,brinesolxn,,160.0,ltbx,What also transpires on screen is the image of Quezon as just another politician who excuses his greed by claiming that the ends justify the means
Quezon,1081,8,brinesolxn,,160.0,ltbx,Kaya gets kung bakit galit na galit yung descendant niya during the talkback with the cast hahaha

Quezon,1085,2,trcdelps,,160.0,ltbx,"Unlike the first two films which focus on the fight for a Revolutionary Government, Quezon, sets up a new story toward nation building translated to themes of power and play in the political arena(of which parallels to the existing political patterns of Philippine Politics)"
Quezon,1085,3,trcdelps,,160.0,ltbx,The good points of the film would be the idea of a film within a film; how media was an excellent medium to portray the two sides of Quezon as the Hero and the Trapo(traditional politician)
Quezon,1085,4,trcdelps,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales did and excellent execution portraying someone who despite being narcissistic and intelligent gentleman you can't help but to love the guy
Quezon,1085,5,trcdelps,,160.0,ltbx,Another good point was the role Joven Hernando as the main protagonist guised as a side character which has been consistent on all three films
Quezon,1085,6,trcdelps,,160.0,ltbx,"The role of Joven, a fictional character meant to symbolize the viewers but my interpretation would also be the youth who are seeking for truth"
Quezon,1085,7,trcdelps,,160.0,ltbx,Joven meaning youth in Spanish is an excellent name for the character inviting the youth to critically think and discern for a more Independent Philippines
Quezon,1085,8,trcdelps,,160.0,ltbx,"This last installment,while it stirs controversy on the portrayal of President Manuel L"
Quezon,1085,9,trcdelps,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon, opens a fresh perspective how we can further improve our flawed system To quote the late President MLQ""I would rather have a government run like hell by Filipinos,than run like heaven by Americans, because no matter how bad a Filipino Government might be, we can always change it"""

Quezon,1094,3,sharcher,,160.0,ltbx,what concept do we make a stand point to have a bayani
Quezon,1094,4,sharcher,,160.0,ltbx,"well, yes totoo it's a perception"
Quezon,1094,5,sharcher,,160.0,ltbx,"kasi we see our heroes in 'perfect' and full of glossified praises, but in reality (which is hard to swallow) they are humans that has flaws"
Quezon,1094,6,sharcher,,160.0,ltbx,Now it makes sense why the other movie has Quezon's Game
Quezon,1094,7,sharcher,,160.0,ltbx,Basically and literally MLQ knows how to play his A-game

Quezon,1094,10,sharcher,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon's took that mindset kaya mabilis siya nakahanap ng propaganda

Quezon,1096,5,philosophosquil,,120.0,ltbx,Although wrapped in discourse and controversy I think the movie has done its job by pushing people to dig deeper and find out more about the historical figures we either praise or persecute

Quezon,1098,5,eddnfilms,,160.0,ltbx,"The film was divided into different sections, each about someone Quezon was associated with, making me able to understand all point of views"
Quezon,1099,1,verrrated,,160.0,ltbx,"More than the moral dilemma of campaigns, Quezon was a deconstruction of our loyalists culture towards political actors, diverting us from their humane and flawed tendencies"
Quezon,1099,2,verrrated,,160.0,ltbx,"And although it synthesizes fiction in narrating a political legacy, it continues to be a reflection of how the public has its influence on the politics we have today because of our blinded perception of the people we should only consider as public servants and not heroes"

Quezon,1101,6,borromc,,120.0,ltbx,"This movie excelled in portraying President Quezon in a very ""larger-than-life"" person (who historically was very much so)"
Quezon,1101,7,borromc,,120.0,ltbx,"Yet, at the same time, the movie seems to convey the impression that many artistic liberties were taken to make the movie more entertaining rather than to be a more historic portrayal of the real Quezon"
Quezon,1101,8,borromc,,120.0,ltbx,"Notwithstanding, the movie does not shy away from asking ground-breaking questions such as ""How far will one go to ensure the independence of a nation"

Quezon,1105,1,janyxregalo,,140.0,ltbx,There are different entry points on how to read Quezon
Quezon,1105,2,janyxregalo,,140.0,ltbx,"Perhaps the most urgent for me to look at, is its distribution and promotion — how its coining of ""Bayaniverse"" has transmuted to multiple efforts of sustaining its captured audience from Heneral Luna (2015) and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2018)"
Quezon,1105,3,janyxregalo,,140.0,ltbx,"In these ongoing attempts of serving its captured audience, Quezon has both failed and served them at best"
Quezon,1105,4,janyxregalo,,140.0,ltbx,"By constantly challenging and deconstructing our ideals of heroism, Quezon has to eventually hurt the Pinoy pride, which I personally found an achievement"
Quezon,1105,5,janyxregalo,,140.0,ltbx,"Sometimes, to offend the audience is to serve them best"
Quezon,1105,6,janyxregalo,,140.0,ltbx,"By structuring a film (or films) within the film, Quezon mirrors what many of us refuse to see and can't yet actively confront, that our eventual participation in the culture of patronage politics has built the Duterte - Marcosverse"
Quezon,1105,7,janyxregalo,,140.0,ltbx,"Meanwhile, I couldn't help but realize that Goyo is actually my favorite of the 3"
Quezon,1105,8,janyxregalo,,140.0,ltbx,It renders a cinematic language mostly spoken in a spiritual context: deep diving in introspection of our personal and collective complexities

Quezon,1107,4,ppom,,160.0,ltbx,overall it was a great watch
Quezon,1107,5,ppom,,160.0,ltbx,"such an eye-opening movie since aguinaldo is always depicted as the ""antagonist"" in philippine history"

Quezon,1110,4,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,i’ve always loved history since elementary school
Quezon,1110,5,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,it was one of my favorite subjects because it was easy for me to memorize important details
Quezon,1110,6,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,but that’s also the problem
Quezon,1110,7,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,"we were taught to memorize history, not to understand it"
Quezon,1110,8,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,"we remember the names, dates, and events, but we rarely think critically about what they actually mean"
Quezon,1110,9,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,that’s why this movie was so refreshing to watch
Quezon,1110,10,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,"it connected all those historical terms and lessons i used to memorize, making them finally make sense in context"
Quezon,1110,11,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,"it’s no longer just information i learned to pass an exam, but a deeper understanding of the story behind it all"
Quezon,1110,12,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,it’s sad to think that our government hasn’t changed even a bit from before until now
Quezon,1110,13,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,"the same dirty political tactics, corruption, maneuvering, and patronage politics still exist today"
Quezon,1110,14,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,it’s truly disappointing that the philippines hasn’t progressed at all under this kind of politics
Quezon,1110,15,jlmwoooo,,200.0,ltbx,"i just hope that in the near future, our country will no longer be filled with politicians, but with genuine public servants who truly care for the people"
Quezon,1111,1,nickvan99,,160.0,ltbx,"Jerrold Tarog’s Quezon is, quite frankly, a bold attempt to deconstruct a “national hero” long revered through the sanitized lens of our school textbooks"
Quezon,1111,2,nickvan99,,160.0,ltbx,"I appreciate its almost relentless flow of exposition, which, despite its weight, is presented with precision and clarity rather than coming off as tacky"
Quezon,1111,3,nickvan99,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales’s portrayal of Manuel Quezon is, for the most part, spot-on and convincingly delivered—he truly understood the assignment"
Quezon,1111,4,nickvan99,,160.0,ltbx,"Moreover, regardless of any controversy the film may have sparked upon release (such as outrage among Quezon’s direct descendants), Tarog’s vision remains clear: to reveal what politicians are truly made of, how their facades unravel when stripped bare, and how they continue to pass down the same traits to future generations"
Quezon,1112,1,rezonin,,180.0,ltbx,"No wonder Quezon's grandson's nepo baby ass was so angry (kinda funny, though)"
Quezon,1112,2,rezonin,,180.0,ltbx,"Needless to say, the film highlights how crucial for us Filipinos to critically examine our leaders, their use of power, and political ambitions, especially during these trying times in our politics"

Quezon,1123,1,fridaypilot,,160.0,ltbx,"Obviously this film says a lot about how politicians operate in the Philippines, something that I had very little insight of until recently"
Quezon,1123,2,fridaypilot,,160.0,ltbx,It neither condemns nor glorify Quezon
Quezon,1123,3,fridaypilot,,160.0,ltbx,You get to ask yourself if the risks and compromises were worth it
Quezon,1123,4,fridaypilot,,160.0,ltbx,As you see how the man slowly corrodes his ideals because he plays the game too well
Quezon,1123,5,fridaypilot,,160.0,ltbx,"I hope that when the time comes for me to vote in any upcoming election, I can see the game being played in front of my eyes"
Quezon,1123,6,fridaypilot,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, when the Ramon Magsaysay post-credit scene dropped I shed multiple tears"
Quezon,1124,1,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,I appreciate how this film challenges the notion of being a “Bayani” differently compared to Heneral Luna (2015) and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2018)
Quezon,1124,2,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,The film isn’t afraid to show that Manuel L
Quezon,1124,3,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,Quezon was a deeply flawed and problematic person despite all his achievements and contributions in helping the Philippines understand and reach independencia
Quezon,1124,4,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,"(Random funny side note: It tickles my brain every time they say “independencia,” and when they curse in Filipino with their thick accents"
Quezon,1124,5,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,)It’s necessary to have narratives like this every once in a while because people tend to put others on pedestals and perceive them as flawless and ideal individuals
Quezon,1124,6,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,"This is dangerous because idolatry leads to leniency, leniency leads to conformity, and conformity leads to collapse"
Quezon,1124,7,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,"Everything breaks down when we put the weight and responsibility of an entire country on one person alone, instead of recognizing that it also takes an entire nation’s worth of people to create change"
Quezon,1124,8,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,"This story is socially relevant not only because of our current political landscape here in the Philippines, but also as a reminder of the importance of looking back on our history to ensure we never repeat the mistakes of the past"
Quezon,1124,9,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,The film is also masterfully crafted on a technical level and is arguably the best in the Bayaniverse so far
Quezon,1124,10,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,"The direction, cinematography, editing, staging, musical score, and performances from the entire cast"
Quezon,1124,11,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,They all shine here
Quezon,1124,12,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,"Every single department that worked on this film fired on all cylinders, and it shows"
Quezon,1124,13,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,"There is also a level of playfulness present here (Mostly because of the score, staging, and performances) in the film that I really appreciate"
Quezon,1124,14,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,It’s like a new flavor being introduced for the Bayaniverse and I welcome it very much
Quezon,1124,15,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,It was exceptionally made and definitely one of my favorite films of 2025
Quezon,1124,16,groovygeek,,200.0,ltbx,I hope to see more films like this from TBA Studios

Quezon,1134,1,kleoamo,,180.0,ltbx,this movie fueled anger and helplessness within me
Quezon,1134,2,kleoamo,,180.0,ltbx,"almost every day, i think about the flood control projects and the corrupt government and then see how people are suffering because of political greed"
Quezon,1134,3,kleoamo,,180.0,ltbx,"yung how philhealth coverage is so low when u need it tapos makikita mo yung mga politiko nasa room filled with moneytapos i trace it all back to this, to quezon's political games"
Quezon,1134,4,kleoamo,,180.0,ltbx,"how there was no point in the film where his love for filipinos was showed, it's all ego and power"
Quezon,1134,5,kleoamo,,180.0,ltbx,"tapos i imagine, this is how senate people probably talk day to day and it frustrates me na parang nasa 'ganun talaga' mindset na tayo"

Quezon,1135,4,uresovane,,180.0,ltbx,"it was funny, vibrant, and it just sticks to you"
Quezon,1135,5,uresovane,,180.0,ltbx,"would definitely wanna watch the whole thing sa online streaming platforms also i liked yong stairs thing they do with osmena and quezon as well as when he declared his resignation; lagi siyang nauuna sa steps and mabagal & confident lagi na parang calculated (reflection cguro ng domination nia) but when he threw a tantrum after wood ignored his bullshit, siya pa unang bumaba & mabilis pa hahahahaps"
Quezon,1135,6,uresovane,,180.0,ltbx,: i was alr 2 hours in credible naman n xguro 2 hahahaha
Quezon,1136,1,minpong,,200.0,ltbx,"i loved how they touched on the history of yk our pres manuel quezon, i think the acting and overall message was very cleverly and creatively shown in the movie, i would recommend to ppl (esp our filipinos) to watch when they can"

Quezon,1139,1,julyyyyyy_,,140.0,ltbx,So eto dapat talaga yung may title na Quezon's Game haha
Quezon,1139,2,julyyyyyy_,,140.0,ltbx,"But in all honesty, I was wondering why this film focused on Quezon's ""flaws"" when I don't remember the same treatment were given to Luna and Goyo (pls correct me if i'm wrong)"
Quezon,1139,3,julyyyyyy_,,140.0,ltbx,I would've liked it better if it was a balance of his politics and his good deeds as the president
Quezon,1139,4,julyyyyyy_,,140.0,ltbx,Felt like the film glorified Aguinaldo over Quezon pa nga e kaninong film ba to
Quezon,1139,6,julyyyyyy_,,140.0,ltbx,"Still liked it more than Goyo, though"
Quezon,1140,1,maeawww,,160.0,ltbx,"Sa totoo lang, I enjoyed the movie because of its nonlinear flow"
Quezon,1140,2,maeawww,,160.0,ltbx,"I loved the sudden flashbacks and how some scenes could be compared to recent events, because it will always be relevant"
Quezon,1140,3,maeawww,,160.0,ltbx,It was captured in a way that makes you think about how cruel and unjust the system they built really is
Quezon,1140,4,maeawww,,160.0,ltbx,"The ones truly affected by all this politics were the Filipinos in the marginalized sectors—many of whom don’t even know what their future holds, and watching…"
Quezon,1141,1,dnsivann,,200.0,ltbx,how can one truly be independent from oppression if the very oppression is system built
Quezon,1142,1,isenoire,,120.0,ltbx,"Ambot sa imo, nabuang na si Quezon"
Quezon,1143,1,mrdj1721,,140.0,ltbx,"Despite Jericho Rosales' electric performance as Quezon, I feel as though the film's very messy story really dragged it down for me"
Quezon,1143,2,mrdj1721,,140.0,ltbx,"Aside from that, there is that thing again that this trilogy is plagued with: its portrayal of the American colonizers"
Quezon,1143,3,mrdj1721,,140.0,ltbx,"Goyo did it best by portraying the Americans as villains, while Luna shifted the villainy away from the American and into the Filipinos"
Quezon,1143,4,mrdj1721,,140.0,ltbx,"In this one, it wasn't even subtle in its way of putting a light on the Americans"
Quezon,1143,5,mrdj1721,,140.0,ltbx,This was especially evident with Leonard Wood
Quezon,1143,6,mrdj1721,,140.0,ltbx,"Despite this, I am excited to see the next movie in this franchise as it seems as though a new Hernando will be the surrogate and they will be using the framing device of cinema in the next ones"
Quezon,1143,7,mrdj1721,,140.0,ltbx,I hope it utilizes cinema a better way than this film did
Quezon,1144,1,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,nakakatuwa na sa Heneral Luna film si Aguinaldo ang pinapahiwatig na masama (o villain sa ingles) pero dito sa Quezon tila siya ang naging kawawa sa pinag gagawa ni Quezon sa kanya
Quezon,1144,2,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,"gets kaya nainis ung ka apo apohan niya sa isang ""screening"""
Quezon,1144,3,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,"ganun talaga possibleng sa estorya ng iba ay mabait ka, ngunit sa iba masama ka"
Quezon,1144,4,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,noong una pa lang gusto ng mga Filipino ang kapangyarihan hanggang ngayon
Quezon,1144,5,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,e sino bang may ayaw
Quezon,1144,6,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,akala kasi ng mga yan pag nasa pulitika ay pwede na gumawa ng masama o mag alipusta ng mga mababang tao
Quezon,1144,7,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,"wala na talaga o kakaonti na lang ang politiko na para sa masa, meron naman tayong pag asa"
Quezon,1144,8,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,ngunit nabubulag ang mga Filipino sa mga hindi totoong sabi sabi

Quezon,1144,14,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,"ang galing ni Jericho sa karakter na ito, pati si Karyelle"
Quezon,1144,15,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,"maraming babae ang martir para sa kanilang minamahal, hindi iniwan ni Aurora Quezon si Manuel hanggang dulo"
Quezon,1144,16,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,talagang katawa tawa ang politika noon hanggang ngayon
Quezon,1144,17,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,"ngayon magkatambal kayo, pagnanalo na ay tabla tabla na"
Quezon,1144,18,tehmote,,160.0,ltbx,sounds familiar bbm & sara
Quezon,1145,1,sysad,,120.0,ltbx,All those stars gone bc of the unnecessary aguinaldo glaze
Quezon,1145,2,sysad,,120.0,ltbx,"Maybe not glaze but more, are we supposed to pity this shithead"
Quezon,1145,3,sysad,,120.0,ltbx,Fun movie though
Quezon,1145,4,sysad,,120.0,ltbx,"Shame to end the trilogy (idk if its officially one but seems like it) ""redeeming"" aguinaldo tho"
Quezon,1145,5,sysad,,120.0,ltbx,Did the writers just forget about the shit did
Quezon,1145,6,sysad,,120.0,ltbx,Such a shame
Quezon,1146,1,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,two words: revolutionary cinema
Quezon,1146,2,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,"quezon, amidst multiple opinions stirred due to its ability to challenge main character norms of being picture-perfect or blatantly evil, has set the standard for philippine cinema to begin questioning the authenticity of our history and our roots"
Quezon,1146,3,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,"it obviously did a great job in personifying such a glorified figure like manuel quezon, who used to be seen as a national hero, but upon exiting the cinemas, its really got you asking what is real or not"
Quezon,1146,4,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,is he really worth the praise he’s been receiving from the filipino nation
Quezon,1146,5,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,"other than that, they successfully portrayed the flaws and beauty of philippine politics; how ugly it can get, and how it has always been up to the nation’s voices to determine whether or not they want to receive the treatment they deserve or not"
Quezon,1146,6,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,"it mirrors current reality without being too complex to understand, it embodies the philippines as a whole, kumbaga perfect fit talaga ang tagline ni quezon na “I am the Philippines"
Quezon,1146,7,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,"”jericho rosales was stellar, karylle was empathic, mon confiado was agitatingly pitiful, and jerrold tarog was superb"
Quezon,1146,8,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,"you can see the consistency of the arts in his craft, encapsulating every detail of quezon’s life into his bayaniverse vision that translates beautifully into the soul of philippine cinema"
Quezon,1146,9,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,"walang patumpik-tumpik in all movies of the bayaniverse, hence, the emergence of what i call revolutionary cinema"
Quezon,1146,10,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,more films like this please
Quezon,1146,11,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,and more movie goers to encourage fellow filipinos to come see them
Quezon,1146,12,yanfangtea,,200.0,ltbx,let’s utilize our homegrown talents to possibly bring upon the change our country needs

Quezon,1149,1,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"Of all the Bayaniverse movies, Quezon (2025) is arguably the most polarizing"
Quezon,1149,2,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"I'll try my best to condense my thoughts, organizing them based on meta analysis, historical truth, and social commentary"
Quezon,1149,3,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"In its most meta, Quezon (2025) stands to subvert audience expectations with its characterization of Manuel L"
Quezon,1149,5,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"In Tarog's previous films, he sought to shed a more sympathetic light on misunderstood figures of Philippine history"
Quezon,1149,6,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"Portraying Luna as a passionate and enlightened man, Goyo as misguided and young, and even Aguinaldo as complex and misunderstood"
Quezon,1149,7,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"However, how could he showcase the story of a man who's well-beloved by a nation"
Quezon,1149,8,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"It's in the best interest of many to concede that although polarizing, Quezon being characterized as the progenitor of patronage politics is on brand for Dir"
Quezon,1149,10,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"Luna and Goyo were already established by key aspects of their stories, either by being hot-headed or accomplished and young"
Quezon,1149,11,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"Jerrold Tarog's brand has been to take what the audience may know and provide a different perspective, thus explaining Quezon's diva tantrums and arrogance"
Quezon,1149,12,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"However, the question remains—Is it historically accurate"
Quezon,1149,13,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"From my understanding of the film, Tarog already sought to answer those questions within the film itself"
Quezon,1149,14,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"Accuracy and truth is greatly influenced by the filmmaker, her patron, and even preexistent ideas of who a person is"
Quezon,1149,15,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"History is not my career, thus I can't provide a professional opinion on its accuracy"
Quezon,1149,16,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"What I can say, however, is that if Tarog's own opus is be trusted—he, the director, is merely a man"
Quezon,1149,17,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"He is not infallible and thus, the truth as he knows it, may not entirely be what it is"
Quezon,1149,18,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"Historical accuracy cannot simply be based on its costuming and subtle details in props, but also the integrity of the story itself"
Quezon,1149,19,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"Lastly, the movie is obviously a very nail-on-the-head commentary on politicians whose personal ambitions are hid thinly behind a persona of nationalism"
Quezon,1149,20,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"It feels like a jab against growing populist sentiments, but antagonizes the greedy who sought to reap its benefits with little sincerity"
Quezon,1149,21,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"It explores how the formula for gaining power as an ambitious, dynastic politician has never really changed in the past century or so"
Quezon,1149,22,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"Unless the people themselves are willing to start questioning the integrity of the people they sought to empower with their votes, for every disgraced politician another corrupt politician will take his place"
Quezon,1149,23,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"Perhaps I'm reading too much into this, but Quezon (2025) feels like some sort of cinematic social experiment that Jerrold Tarog gave us"
Quezon,1149,24,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"He's seen the power of Heneral Luna and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, perhaps this is just him leaving a movie that's on-purposely polarizing so that the people can be forced to think about the credibility of everything they see"
Quezon,1149,25,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,"Even if not his intention, it's great to see this play out"
Quezon,1149,26,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,The movie was enjoyable and the stylistic difference definitely ties into how we're in a brand new era of Philippine history
Quezon,1149,27,cefirolikesstar,,140.0,ltbx,I'm hoping to see a similar thing be done with any of his future works

Quezon,1152,1,ishatearjerky,,140.0,ltbx,liked the satirical atake
Quezon,1153,1,mattchamolss,,160.0,ltbx,"the “recapitulation” of the “sonata” that is the bayaniverse trilogyveeery campy post-war film, absolutely tonally different from the first 2 (which are essentially war films)"
Quezon,1153,2,mattchamolss,,160.0,ltbx,"Its got a lot to say but it also asks a lot of questions for the audience to think about (tying together the entire trilogy)arguably a more demanding/challenging film than the last 2, yet it manages to still be entertaining with some good laughs, heart, and substance"
Quezon,1153,3,mattchamolss,,160.0,ltbx,an overall good watch (rewatches are recommended)side note: i wish it was more common practice in ph cinema to physically transform for roles and performance; jericho rosales acting like he has TB without looking as gaunt as quezon in his old TB age did is quite the suspension of disbelief (makeup can only do so much)—like guys pls val kilmer played doc holliday who was also dying of tb and he looked so convincing looking like SHIT (john green is right yet again)
Quezon,1154,1,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,"I'll be honest, I didn't know much about Manuel Quezon outside the fact that he's considered a national hero—and a bit about the questionable land acquisition practices in the establishment of his namesake city"
Quezon,1154,2,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,"And not being a huge fan of biopics, I was just hoping for a nuanced look at a national hero"
Quezon,1154,3,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,"But holy shit, this pulled no punches"
Quezon,1154,4,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon is portrayed to have learned the worst of the political game from the Americans
Quezon,1154,6,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,Incredibly so
Quezon,1154,9,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,"I had to pull up some recordings of him afterwards, Rosales absolutely nailed his cadence"
Quezon,1154,10,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,The acting here was incredible
Quezon,1154,11,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,The cinematography some of the best I've seen from a Filipino movie
Quezon,1154,12,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,"And best of all, it LOOKED like a movie"
Quezon,1154,13,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,This was cinematic
Quezon,1154,14,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,"And surprising for a political biopic, this was a blast"
Quezon,1154,15,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,It was hilarious
Quezon,1154,16,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,"It didn't take itself too seriously (or seriously at all, really)"
Quezon,1154,17,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,"Maybe those more familiar with the story will be annoyed by the heavy use of exposition, but I found it to be helpful"
Quezon,1154,18,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,I'm not here to shit on anyone else's national heroes—I've got plenty of American historical figures I can do that to
Quezon,1154,19,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,"But, this does do a great job of depicting how Quezon's style of politicking, and selling off his country's resources to the highest bidders, seems to have led to the rampant levels of corruption seen today, 100 years later"
Quezon,1154,20,vistica,,180.0,ltbx,Added to My Filipino Film Diary

Quezon,1170,1,binukot,,120.0,ltbx,entertaining & jericho rosales’ accent/language work was great but my main gripe is that it’s very tell instead of show
Quezon,1170,2,binukot,,120.0,ltbx,if i wanted a lecture i would just attend my undergrad phil history class
Quezon,1171,1,dnie_cc,,160.0,ltbx,Hahaha Burukrata-Kapitalismo Ibagsak
Quezon,1171,2,dnie_cc,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon at its forefront and one of the pioneers of bureaucrat-capitalists  all disillusioned by his savior complex for bringin independence in the Philippines, but the truth is, he just wants the power and all the credits for it"
Quezon,1171,3,dnie_cc,,160.0,ltbx,Nagtaka pa dami ngang lugar nakapangalan sa kanya XD
Quezon,1172,1,b8ttina,,180.0,ltbx,jericho rosales i wasn’t aware of ur acting game
Quezon,1173,1,pablolous,,160.0,ltbx,"A scathing and surprisingly humorous indictment of Quezon and his supposedly scummy character, so much so that it enters caricature territory, but I'm reminded of Tarrog's overarching project of interrogating what a bayani means"
Quezon,1173,2,pablolous,,160.0,ltbx,"This is supported further by the dimension that the film adds to Aguinaldo who was a clear villain in ""Heneral Luna"
Quezon,1173,3,pablolous,,160.0,ltbx,""" There's a dearth of (good) films about history and politics in mainstream contemporary Filipino film, so I was pleased to see some unconventional editing and cinematographic choices here that are more common in foreign biopics"
Quezon,1173,4,pablolous,,160.0,ltbx,"The incorporation of the silent film was a clever device all around – a way to deepen the fictional Joven's story while beefing up the commentary on media as a tool of propaganda, a cost-cutting yet effective touch on the artificiality of celebrity politics, a self-aware reflection on how history is written by the victors"
Quezon,1173,5,pablolous,,160.0,ltbx,Rosales' transformation is a thrill to watch and a testament to the ripening of his craft but I was also really captivated by Sarmienta's performance
Quezon,1173,6,pablolous,,160.0,ltbx,Sometimes the script sounds like it's lifted from a HEKASI textbook but it's forgivable for people like me who need the refresher course
Quezon,1174,1,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"With memorable performances from the cast, compelling storytelling, and masterful direction, Quezon (2025) deserves to stand and be praised on its own"
Quezon,1174,2,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,Still it’s best viewed as the final installment to the Bayaniverse trilogy
Quezon,1174,3,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"In this lens, we really see Jerrold Tarog’s thesis throughout the series: “Ang pagkabayani, it’s all about perception"
Quezon,1174,4,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,”Heneral Luna (2015) showed a hero with unrivaled passion and patriotism
Quezon,1174,5,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,John Arcilla’s Luna is a hero people wanted to rally behind and emulate
Quezon,1174,6,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"He was branded as a leader who could have saved the Philippines, if not for the infighting between the revolutionaries"
Quezon,1174,7,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"Yes, he was a flawed character, but you wanted to root for him"
Quezon,1174,8,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,Never mind that he never won a battle – his profound love of country made up for it
Quezon,1174,9,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,The timing of the film also couldn’t be more perfect — it was released during an intense rise in populism
Quezon,1174,10,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"The film arguably contributed to Rodrigo Duterte winning the 2016 presidential elections, but that’s another story"
Quezon,1174,11,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,Goyo: The Boy General (2018) was more subdued
Quezon,1174,12,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"There was no way to replicate Luna’s fiery personality and Arcilla’s performance as a cussing, temperamental general, so it was only natural to take another approach"
Quezon,1174,13,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"Paulo Avelino gave life to the young, inexperienced boy general"
Quezon,1174,14,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"In history classes, Goyo was often described as a martyr who died for his beloved country"
Quezon,1174,15,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,The film portrayed his conflict – was he really loyal to his country or only to Aguinaldo
Quezon,1174,16,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,Was his sacrifice heroism or blind servitude
Quezon,1174,17,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon depicted a trapo’s rise to power
Quezon,1174,18,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales’ Quezon showed ability to pull all the tricks in the book: propaganda, lying, self-serving alliances, politicking, patronage politics"
Quezon,1174,19,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"He wasn’t the first to do them (and we know from our daily experiences now that he’s not the last), but he no doubt mastered them"
Quezon,1174,20,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,Describing him as a chameleon was an understatement
Quezon,1174,21,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,Always performing and projecting what the other side wants him to be
Quezon,1174,22,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"More importantly, Quezon brought the trilogy’s thesis full circle"
Quezon,1174,23,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"The film, like the two before it, argues that heroism is not black and white"
Quezon,1174,24,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"“Ang pagkabayani, it’s all about perception"
Quezon,1174,25,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,”The film within a film device effectively blurred the lines between reality and fiction
Quezon,1174,26,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"The switching between different Quezons (the old version, the young version, the fictionalized young version), the nonlinear storytelling and changing perspectives, further served to confuse the audience about objective history and revisionist recollection"
Quezon,1174,27,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,But the film’s biggest and most-rewarding bet is making Joven Hernando (the audience surrogate) an active participant to the story
Quezon,1174,28,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"By showing that he can be swayed by narratives, blinded by his own biases, be bought, but ultimately speak truth to power, the challenge is flipped back to the viewer"
Quezon,1174,29,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,How should we view heroes
Quezon,1174,30,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"When we know that they “get their hands dirty” with politics; they forge convenient alliances; they stage publicity stunts; they do everything not for the greater good, but to push their own ambitions"
Quezon,1174,31,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,How should we question our leaders and speak truth to power when we can also benefit from them if only we played our cards right
Quezon,1174,32,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"Looking at the trilogy as a whole, it is clear that our heroes, despite their contributions to the nation, are flawed individuals"
Quezon,1174,33,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite their larger-than-life personas, they are just people too"
Quezon,1174,34,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,Like us
Quezon,1174,35,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,"The whole time we were focused on the titular characters, on supposed saviors we have preconceived perceptions on"
Quezon,1174,36,roizyrilb,,160.0,ltbx,But this conclusion just reminded us we ought to look at ourselves and our relationship with these heroes too
Quezon,1175,1,pongz42o,,160.0,ltbx,"Good score, cinemarography and acting"
Quezon,1175,2,pongz42o,,160.0,ltbx,I'll give 'Goyo' another chance lol

Quezon,1185,2,treehugger0000,,140.0,ltbx,"I just found the story telling a bit short, not as compelling as the first two movies in developing the characters"
Quezon,1185,3,treehugger0000,,140.0,ltbx,We were thrown into accepting the nature of each and every one without question
Quezon,1185,4,treehugger0000,,140.0,ltbx,"At times, the movie also felt more like a documentary with multiple statement of facts as if teaching history to a 2nd grader"
Quezon,1185,5,treehugger0000,,140.0,ltbx,"Otherwise, an entertaining film and a good watch"
Quezon,1186,1,canyoubeamine,,140.0,ltbx,i loved it cs it showed the authentic side of quezon but lwk some parts could have been expanded
Quezon,1186,2,canyoubeamine,,140.0,ltbx,"idk if it makes any sense but overall i loved how the story progressed (even if i was confused at first) ultimately showed that even if u have the ambition to do good, u can still make immoral decisions along the way"

Quezon,1190,5,joeiie,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon really shows how things right now are just the same with the way things were back then

Quezon,1191,3,filmmiracles,,200.0,ltbx,There's a lot of political heat in every part of the world now and this is just so timely on seeing a politician from every perspective
Quezon,1191,4,filmmiracles,,200.0,ltbx,I have to give kudos to the art of the scenes
Quezon,1191,5,filmmiracles,,200.0,ltbx,"The fact that framing of the scenes, the pace, and the colours truly reflect how Quezon was being two-faced"
Quezon,1191,6,filmmiracles,,200.0,ltbx,"Colourful, quirky, joyful, and comedic"

Quezon,1193,3,broji,,160.0,ltbx,The film wants us to keep questioning our leaders from the past and the leaders now

Quezon,1201,1,foxcandyfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"I didn't know what to expect when I first walked into the cinema, but I'm glad I went to see this film"
Quezon,1201,2,foxcandyfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"It took me a beat to remember who Joven Fernando was because it's been so long since I saw the two earlier films, but once I remembered it made me appreciate the decision to insert an audience avatar into this remix of Philippine history"
Quezon,1201,3,foxcandyfilm,,160.0,ltbx,It's not a perfect film and it leans too heavily on exposition several times (e
Quezon,1201,5,foxcandyfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"one character notably sketches Quezon's pre-presidential career in the space of a minute, as if he were reading from a Wikipedia entry), but as a whole I enjoyed the creative decisions made and the liberties taken"
Quezon,1201,6,foxcandyfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"The best thing about it, by far, is the performances by its cast"
Quezon,1201,7,foxcandyfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales, Cris Villanueva, Romnick Sarmenta, and Mon Confiado in particular were wonderful to watch"
Quezon,1201,8,foxcandyfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"(I also enjoyed Iain Glen as Leonard Wood, though at times the accent wasn't quite there"
Quezon,1201,9,foxcandyfilm,,160.0,ltbx,) I can already hear the arguments that are going to bubble up because of how politicians and the people are rendered in this film--but then aren't those arguments the point

Quezon,1203,5,ninooox,,,ltbx,it felt like a recapitulation of what we know of
Quezon,1203,6,ninooox,,,ltbx,maybe if we finally appreciate biopics and scrap the misconception that a biopic is negative historical revisionism then movies like this would properly utilize the creative liberties entailed in making one
Quezon,1203,7,ninooox,,,ltbx,if you find at least fifty percent of good in this film then good for you
Quezon,1203,8,ninooox,,,ltbx,but i didn't enjoy this and was uncomfy throughout the whole runtime

Quezon,1224,1,userxonse,,120.0,ltbx,"I like the framing of the story, how it’s about film"
Quezon,1224,2,userxonse,,120.0,ltbx,But the prod design lacks in some scenes which kind of take me away from being immersed in the time period
Quezon,1224,3,userxonse,,120.0,ltbx,"There were times where you can literally see modern houses in the bg, and why were they using modern lightsources on the speech"
Quezon,1224,4,userxonse,,120.0,ltbx,"Other than that, it’s probably the best out of majority of the Bayaniverse, or whatever that cornyass name is"
Quezon,1225,1,moviemaxine,,200.0,ltbx,damn we really never learn
Quezon,1226,1,janarby,,,ltbx,Wasn't sold on Jericho being Quezon until 1/4 into the film - took sometime to not see Jericho and only see Quezon
Quezon,1226,2,janarby,,,ltbx,"Beautiful with it rough edges, just like its subject"
Quezon,1226,3,janarby,,,ltbx,The true MVP of the movie was Romnick Sarmienta as Osmena though - he was a true love team/antagonist/folly/parallel of Quezon which allowed Quezon to be viewed in multiple lens
Quezon,1226,4,janarby,,,ltbx,"By throwing Quezon against Osmena, you are able to compare what Quezon was and what he was not"
Quezon,1227,1,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"As someone who really enjoyed Araling Panlipunan in elementary and junior high school, and a huge Bayaniverse fan—watching this film was an absolute treat for me"
Quezon,1227,2,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"(Not to mention the outstanding visuals, humor, and score in this film, absolute chef kiss"
Quezon,1227,3,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,")I love how it went beyond the usual, surface-level lessons we get in school"
Quezon,1227,4,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,I remember learning about the Tydings–McDuffie Act back in sixth grade and wishing we could explore it more deeply but was ultimately met with disappointment when we only touched on it briefly before moving on to another topic
Quezon,1227,5,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"That being said, hearing familiar names and events in this movie made me geek out so much"
Quezon,1227,6,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"More than that, I truly appreciated how it gave a deeper look into Quezon’s life and not just his role in our history"
Quezon,1227,7,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"I liked that the film showed his flaws and his “dark games,” making him feel more real and human"
Quezon,1227,8,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"Without giving away any more spoilers, this film is both thought-provoking and relevant today"
Quezon,1227,9,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"It leaves us with something important to reflect on: to question, to stay aware, and to take an active role in shaping our nation"
Quezon,1227,10,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,The future is in our hands—we must act before it changes us
Quezon,1227,11,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,Lahat ng bagay ay lilipas din; darating ang panahon na ang mga pangulo at mga nasa kapangyarihan ay bababa rin
Quezon,1227,12,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"Nawa’y magsilbing paalala ang pelikulang ito na matutong mag-isip, maging mapagmatyag, at tumindig para sa tama"
Quezon,1227,13,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,Huwag tayong maging uto-uto
Quezon,1227,14,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"Oo, the world isn’t simply black and white but I do hope that we try our best to choose what’s right"
Quezon,1227,15,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"Overall, this is a good end to the bayaniverse trilogy"
Quezon,1227,16,gvrlnvr,,200.0,ltbx,"Sobrang nakasubaybay talaga ako dito  Very excited for the panguloverse, but I’m gonna miss this"

Quezon,1230,1,apokolipschild,,160.0,ltbx,"Concluding the Bayaniverse trilogy, Quezon is a battle of wit and strategy, a game of outsmarting and outplaying in a race for political power that ultimately shaped the past, present, and future of the Philippines"
Quezon,1230,2,apokolipschild,,160.0,ltbx,"I love how it incorporates a filmmaker’s perspective through Nadia, as well as the return of Joven, now older, and the reemergence of journalism at the forefront"
Quezon,1230,3,apokolipschild,,160.0,ltbx,"This use of cinema itself as a device to propel the narrative forward makes it compelling, seamlessly blurring the lines between fact and fiction, much like how the main characters easily manipulate these concepts"
Quezon,1230,4,apokolipschild,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite clearly steering away from the literal warfare of the previous two installments, the film still manages to grip audiences through a high-stakes chess match between the titular character and his rivals"
Quezon,1231,1,cinemyles,,200.0,ltbx,bayan daw muna pero siya laging bida
Quezon,1232,1,fo__ur,,160.0,ltbx,this is really a genre shift from the 2 prior bayaniverse films but the film is still engaging enough even with the political genre
Quezon,1232,2,fo__ur,,160.0,ltbx,"and yep, this jus made me say that i understand the need for nitty grittys of politics, but my god i hate the politics"
Quezon,1233,1,anieareuok,,120.0,ltbx,SALTY AF
Quezon,1234,1,seantimothy,,160.0,ltbx,"This is a sarcastic, disturbing, yet timely deconstruction of a well-loved president"
Quezon,1234,2,seantimothy,,160.0,ltbx,The comedic score provides a striking contrast to the film’s portrayal of how the war for independence has shifted from the battlefield to closed-door deals and political maneuverings
Quezon,1234,3,seantimothy,,160.0,ltbx,"Beyond the stellar performances, cinematography, and production design, what stands out most is how the film compels its audience to reflect on the fact that the “trapo” politicians we see today have existed long before"
Quezon,1235,1,aki_hiro,,160.0,ltbx,The MCU style post credits scene for a Ramon Magsaysay movie is so crazy

Quezon,1239,1,shankt,,200.0,ltbx,dialogue heavy but dare i say the most entertaining of the 3 bayaniverse filmsalso can we all agree that mon confiado is such an underappreciated actor like
Quezon,1240,1,generichanna,,120.0,ltbx,too didactic at times but it’s an interesting opener for a discourse on cinema as a medium that is ultimately like water in a clear glass: everything you see through it will always be a little bent and twisty and the only way to see the real shape of the truth is to seek it outside of the movie
Quezon,1241,1,_complicaited,,160.0,ltbx,i am the philippines is crazy

Quezon,1246,2,hinatastan,,140.0,ltbx,it’s sad that these childish games and arguments still happen and are even called “politics” when some are literally just petty fights
Quezon,1246,3,hinatastan,,140.0,ltbx,"it could’ve been shorter, too; it started to feel a bit underwhelming before the ending"

Quezon,1250,1,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,Had a great time with this and it's a refreshing injection of optimism for the Philippine cinema scene
Quezon,1250,2,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,"Love that our theater was packed and our audience was constantly engaged with every bit of dialogue, every Rosales enunciation, and every plot turn - the theater experience definitely amplified it"
Quezon,1250,3,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,I cannot emphasize how lovely it is how this film ignited film discourse that I haven't felt about a local movie in a while since Heneral Luna
Quezon,1250,4,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,Jerrold Tarog's direction and screenplay with Rody Vera feel so ambitious in its approach to this type of film
Quezon,1250,5,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,"The confidence seeps through every scene and how we're carried through scene by scene through its Hollywood level production design, editing, costume design, and unique biographical structure"
Quezon,1250,6,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,Always been wowed at the idea of Joven Hernando and who he represents and this is all the more captivating as what transpires in this film
Quezon,1250,7,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,I felt like it may have some minor pacing issues that don't really tank the movie but it might've helped to have certain scenes/sequences a bit tighter
Quezon,1250,8,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales makes up for not looking like Casey through his fantastic line deliveries and not breaking a sweat while embodying this fascinating gray area of a man
Quezon,1250,9,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,"Confiado (loved his presence very extra this time), Eusebio, and Villanueva also give fantastic turns as mostly returning cast members while Kris Villanueve takes over Joven easily"
Quezon,1250,10,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,"I missed you in this one, Epy as Mabini"
Quezon,1250,11,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,"As the emphatic period to TBA Studios' highly impressive Bayaniverse trilogy, it felt appropriate enough to lean more into the Oppenheimer-esque epic tale as opposed to just giving us another Luna story"
Quezon,1250,12,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,"This is not an action-packed war flick but rather a captivating portrait of political power plays, American colonial dynamics, and the roots of so many of our problems today"
Quezon,1250,13,joviegeek,,160.0,ltbx,I'm sure there's more to take away from it and I'm going to continue browsing the internet to find out what else - that's what makes this movie-loving thing so much fun

Quezon,1253,2,ralphross,,100.0,ltbx,"Story, plot, and historical authenticity-wise, they flunked it"
Quezon,1253,3,ralphross,,100.0,ltbx,"I think a majority of viewers, myself included, would expect a creative educational interpretation of Quezon's life, as opposed to a travesty of him through making half of the movie a glorified gossip show; conjectures right and left"
Quezon,1253,4,ralphross,,100.0,ltbx,"This movie missed out so much, Quezon's childhood, career during the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine-American War, and his helping hand towards the fleeing Jews during the Holocaust"
Quezon,1253,5,ralphross,,100.0,ltbx,"The story feels so inadequate and incomplete, so much missing puzzles"

Quezon,1257,4,mlycm,,160.0,ltbx,"some may call him a bastard for playing dirty, and i think some would side with him"
Quezon,1257,5,mlycm,,160.0,ltbx,"“independence” may be just one word, but the history behind it is so…"

Quezon,1260,2,eigengrauu,,160.0,ltbx,"anw, nalungkot ako sa pelikulang 'to, hindi dahil dismayado ako sa execution (na napakahusay, btw), pero dahil sa katotohanan na ang setting nito ay noon pang okupasyon ng mga dayuhan pero hanggang ngayon, napapanahon pa rin"
Quezon,1260,3,eigengrauu,,160.0,ltbx,"isa pang punto ay may mga pulitikong nagsisimulang may tunay na layuning maglingkod sa masa pero katagalan, nagiging uhaw na lang sila sa kapangyarihan at naghahari-harian"
Quezon,1260,4,eigengrauu,,160.0,ltbx,"sabi ni machiavelli, one can descend power by wicked and nefarious means and through the wishes of his fellow citizens--to which ig quezon was granted with both"
Quezon,1260,5,eigengrauu,,160.0,ltbx,"and yes, the power was there, but the what happened to the love for the country"

Quezon,1261,5,sp4des_,,200.0,ltbx,"Can't believe that's the conclusion of the Bayaniverse trilogy, a mere transition from the violent Revolution to the ego-driven politics"
Quezon,1261,6,sp4des_,,200.0,ltbx,"From the epic and fierceness of Heneral Luna, from the heartbreak and beautiful sights of Goyo, now to the perception of heroism through Quezon"
Quezon,1261,7,sp4des_,,200.0,ltbx,"Echo really killed this role, alongside Sarmenta, Villanueva, Confiado, and Sir Iain Glen"
Quezon,1261,8,sp4des_,,200.0,ltbx,He really is one helluva egoist ngl
Quezon,1261,9,sp4des_,,200.0,ltbx,"Love the callbacks to the previous films, the flashback scenes of our previous leads, the callback to the ""Ang tao may damndamin ay hindi alipin"

Quezon,1261,13,sp4des_,,200.0,ltbx,"Throughout the Bayaniverse, this just shows that in history, there are no heroes and villains, just humans with flaws"
Quezon,1261,14,sp4des_,,200.0,ltbx,"From each film, we learn about each characters' traits and flaws that are something we can learn from them"
Quezon,1261,15,sp4des_,,200.0,ltbx,"Like our fav character throughout the trilogy, Joven Hernando, we are the observants, observing the two sides of a coin of each sides"
Quezon,1261,16,sp4des_,,200.0,ltbx,"Our voice may be silent as we watch, but the truth and the voice we yearn for is loud"
Quezon,1261,17,sp4des_,,200.0,ltbx,"What a nice conclusion to the trilogy, thank you TBA and Direk Jerrold Tarog for giving us great movies that we can go back and learn all about our country's history"

Quezon,1281,1,pichapiprojects,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales' charisma and manipulative character of Quezon, together with the brilliant cast and beautiful cinematography brought an interesting perspective about Philippine politics and how it is still relevant today as being nothing but a messy cesspool of corrupt, incompetent, and boastful politicians thinking about their wealth and businesses, rather than the independence that the Filipinos craved for during the Commonwealth era"

Quezon,1287,2,janjanjanjan,,140.0,ltbx,"No matter which angle you look at it, the film portrayed a negative and unflattering image of Quezon during his lifetime"
Quezon,1287,3,janjanjanjan,,140.0,ltbx,"From his beginnings as a lawyer, to his time as governor of Tayabas, Senate President, and eventually as President — the movie showed how deeply rooted traditional politics was, even back then"
Quezon,1287,4,janjanjanjan,,140.0,ltbx,"Maybe they were the ones who started it; the methods may have changed over time, but the goal remained the same — to gain and keep power"
Quezon,1287,5,janjanjanjan,,140.0,ltbx,It’s hard to accept that our own ancestors might have been the ones who taught us how to become monsters in the world of politics — corrupt and power-hungry
Quezon,1287,6,janjanjanjan,,140.0,ltbx,"But hopefully, this film serves as an eye-opener for all of us — a reminder not to repeat the same history"

Quezon,1302,3,annakinskywlkr,,160.0,ltbx,Kitang kita mo yung malaking budget na meron para dito and this should set the standard of a filipino biopic
Quezon,1302,4,annakinskywlkr,,160.0,ltbx,"Production design was so good, ganda din ng script, hindi pilit yung dialogue and it wasnt cringe to hear the actors speak unlike sa dialogue ng heneral luna LOL"
Quezon,1302,5,annakinskywlkr,,160.0,ltbx,Galing din ni jericho rosales pati yung mga white actors (minsan kase di rin magaling yung mga puting actors na pinipili nila dati)

Quezon,1311,1,tuesjays,,180.0,ltbx,"“I got one more in me,” exclaimed Jerrold Tarrog as he laid the finishing touches of his 3rd film in this ironically-titled Bayaniverse"
Quezon,1311,2,tuesjays,,180.0,ltbx,Wilfredo Garrido has this scathing accusation that Quezon in its entirety is a hackjob in itself
Quezon,1311,3,tuesjays,,180.0,ltbx,"It's very easy to glean the bias from which his status update after watching the film errs on, and I feel the need to start from this note because by no means does the film really sit on the fence"
Quezon,1311,4,tuesjays,,180.0,ltbx,"In fact, and if I may declaratively highlight in all its fictional and non-fictional aspects, Quezon sits as one of Jerrold Tarog's best pieces for being able to angle this part of history in a way never really seen"
Quezon,1311,5,tuesjays,,180.0,ltbx,"The recurring clamor for a film that talks of the Philippine Commonwealth has been something desired of, and Quezon being able to position itself in this manner is a welcome one"
Quezon,1311,6,tuesjays,,180.0,ltbx,"At the end of the day, one is left sitting at Quezon and possibly thinking about how the Philippine government is fundamentally a government of demons of all shapes and sizes"
Quezon,1311,7,tuesjays,,180.0,ltbx,"If you come out of this film arguing that the film itself makes Aguinaldo look like a saint (someone on Twitter says this), you may want to rewatch Heneral Luna as the center of all this is a series of heroes who are profoundly individual at their core, espousing social values and claiming to be champions of the greater good"
Quezon,1311,8,tuesjays,,180.0,ltbx,Addendun: Raymond Red during a talkback of his Bayani (1992) screening earlier recalls the uproar he faced from the academic community for being the first to depict Aguinaldo as a piece of shit

Quezon,1312,1,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,I had the chance to experience watching this film in the Cinemas
Quezon,1312,2,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales as Quezon didn't disappoint, as well as the other actors"
Quezon,1312,3,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"I love cinematic scene shown at first, the silent film theme one made by Nadia where he was portrayed as a good guy for his campaign, even though the contents of it are far from truth and how we're watching from Joven's perspective because the contents of the film revisiting Quezon before entering politics and during it is all in a film made by Nadia, a second version with more truth contrasting what she had made for his Ninong for Presidential Campaign"
Quezon,1312,4,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,My thoughts on this film is that they executed the film really well
Quezon,1312,5,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"It showed their flaws, not just their good side"
Quezon,1312,6,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"I like Joven Hernando's character, he's a fictional character but represent us really well"
Quezon,1312,7,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,All of his lines really aligns with what the audience thinks when watching the film
Quezon,1312,8,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,From supporting and believing Quezon to questioning him and eventually criticizing him
Quezon,1312,9,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"It also reminded me of how Schools always teach and portrayed them as great heroes, but never really show what's behind the door"
Quezon,1312,10,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"Osmeña's character is someone easily swayed with sweet words and Quezon took advantage of that, leading, swaying him with his words even though they've had their own disputes—rivalry turned allies"
Quezon,1312,11,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"Roxas's character is like a child, easy to be pawn"
Quezon,1312,12,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"Quezon's character was portrayed as someone good at playing a game at politics, he knows how to play his cards very well; using every tactic and opportunities just like how he used Patriotism and Independence as a Propaganda"
Quezon,1312,13,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"They also showed Quezon's side being a Womanizer and portrayed him as someone always concerned with good image in the public—although his bad side was shown, it still wouldn't erase the great things he did but it's refreshing to see that this film didn't glorify anyone"
Quezon,1312,14,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,It instead showed that even these people in the end of the day are Humans
Quezon,1312,15,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"They're not perfect or saints, they have their own flaws"
Quezon,1312,16,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,You can also see how our government back then still mirrors our present government
Quezon,1312,17,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"Corruption isn't new, it has always been there"
Quezon,1312,18,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"There's a lot of things that you can realize watching this film, I wouldn't really rely on it for accuracy, after all it's mixed with fiction, myths and certain rumours for humour, that's why it's still better to research thoroughly"
Quezon,1312,19,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"Overall this is a great film, Jerold Tarog and Tba Studios never disappoint"
Quezon,1312,20,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"We need more films like this, tackling our own History"
Quezon,1312,21,myavrse,,200.0,ltbx,"Truth is a great ideal, but you can't always use it to rule"

Quezon,1323,2,buyeeeng,,160.0,ltbx,But I was strucked on how he chased independence for the Philippines (kahit sobrang babaw ng independiyenteng gustong makamtan ng mga Pilipino) Nakakatawa at nakakabother ang pelikula

Quezon,1324,24,meiiyo_,,200.0,ltbx,"It does not try to cancel what Quezon has done or Quezon himself, rather show the other side of the coin (haha get it) of what it took for him to bring us to wherever he took us"
Quezon,1324,25,meiiyo_,,200.0,ltbx,"And I must say, how Jerrold Tarog presented it, does indeed answer what it means to be a ""Bayani"""

Quezon,1324,27,meiiyo_,,200.0,ltbx,I have to watch this again
Quezon,1324,30,meiiyo_,,200.0,ltbx,so this is the root of capitalism huh
Quezon,1325,1,raychen03,,160.0,ltbx,Body and soul
Quezon,1325,2,raychen03,,160.0,ltbx,"Jerold Tarog's ""Quezon"" narrates a period of our history that mirrors the current state of politics in the country"
Quezon,1325,3,raychen03,,160.0,ltbx,"Men in power takes advantage of the other men in the circle and, when its not convenient anymore, easily, casually dropping them dead"
Quezon,1325,4,raychen03,,160.0,ltbx,"History, almost 100 years ago, is repeating itself"
Quezon,1325,5,raychen03,,160.0,ltbx,"The dirty tricks, power-hunger, and betrayal that happened under the Commonwealth government employed by President Quezon are not new to me"
Quezon,1325,6,raychen03,,160.0,ltbx,"My history lessons, albeit shallow, have taught me that while we recognize the efforts of our forefathers, they were after all human and susceptible to corruption"
Quezon,1325,7,raychen03,,160.0,ltbx,It is politics afterall
Quezon,1325,8,raychen03,,160.0,ltbx,What surprised me tho is how this part of the country's history was presented through this film
Quezon,1325,9,raychen03,,160.0,ltbx,"The cinematography, sound production, and set designs, and of course the acting (especially Jericho Rosales) were beautifully blended considering the theme of politics and history"
Quezon,1325,10,raychen03,,160.0,ltbx,Should you watch it on a big screen
Quezon,1325,11,raychen03,,160.0,ltbx,YES-- its a no-brainer
Quezon,1326,1,telleove,,140.0,ltbx,"When Filipinos learn to accept that our politicians are not perfect, flawed, and should not be held in a higher regard than an ordinary person, then maybe we will see a true change in our society"
Quezon,1327,1,scorpy,,120.0,ltbx,didn't know he was this bitch
Quezon,1328,1,chickenmaggie,,140.0,ltbx,"there was this younger guy who used to try to get into my pants, asking me if type ko daw ba si jericho rosales, feeling nya ata kase kamukha nya yun and he was gauging my taste in filipino men ahahahha"
Quezon,1328,2,chickenmaggie,,140.0,ltbx,i laughed at his face back then but upon seeing echo in the big screen (who was amazing btw) omg may hawig nga sila
Quezon,1329,1,kimchimken,,140.0,ltbx,"It was fun and lowkey funny, but at times it felt like it was handholding the viewers how to interpret things, and scrubbed Aguinaldo a little too clean imo"
Quezon,1329,2,kimchimken,,140.0,ltbx,"But the acting of Jericho Rosales really was such a treat, from the body language to the voice"
Quezon,1330,1,maroooyaaa,,140.0,ltbx,quite possibly the most interesting film in the bayaniverse
Quezon,1331,1,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,"After watching Quezon, I wondered: what was the director’s goal in this movie"
Quezon,1331,2,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,"While discussions suggest that the intention was to reveal the flawed person behind someone most people consider a hero, I can’t help but ask—then what"
Quezon,1331,3,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,What did it aim to achieve after that
Quezon,1331,4,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,"For me, it merely opened up a controversy without offering any resolution"
Quezon,1331,5,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,It’s similar to hearing endless news about corruption in the country without actually seeing justice served
Quezon,1331,6,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,Has anyone even been jailed yet
Quezon,1331,7,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,"After tarnishing Quezon’s name and linking him to the culture of political patronage and under-the-table negotiations, what was the movie really calling for"
Quezon,1331,8,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,This is one of the things I find lacking in the film
Quezon,1331,9,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,I was also confused about Jericho’s acting choices and the director’s decisions regarding narration
Quezon,1331,10,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,"I understand that comedy can be an effective way to deliver a message in a relatable manner, but to me, the message—still unclear—was blurred by the slapstick"
Quezon,1331,11,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,Tarog's disclaimer at the beginning and his response to Quezon's grandchild also did not help in his attempt to convey his message
Quezon,1331,12,icanbeyouero,,80.0,ltbx,"And really, is that an attempt to give redemption to Aguinaldo"
Quezon,1333,1,mlsn11,,120.0,ltbx,This film was exhausting to watch

Quezon,1333,8,mlsn11,,120.0,ltbx,"It's scary though, because this film has been injected with bits of fiction already (like the existence of Joven), so it worries me that other Filipinos would take it as it is"
Quezon,1333,9,mlsn11,,120.0,ltbx,Let this be a reminder that pieces like this MUST start a conversation

Quezon,1338,2,lhyemarp,,120.0,ltbx,Duterte would be elected as President
Quezon,1339,1,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,Wrapping up a trilogy about the Philippines' revolutionary past with a relatively uneventful political biopic about some unremarkably corrupt politician really is a bold and interesting choice
Quezon,1339,2,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,"Moreover, Quezon really is a rejection of the two films that came before"
Quezon,1339,3,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,"By no fault of its own, Heneral Luna is one of the most misunderstood and bastardized cautionary tales about patriotism and masculinity I've seen in my lifetime"
Quezon,1339,4,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral is a bitter demolition of the mindless jingoism and fascism that Heneral Luna became synonymous with
Quezon,1339,5,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,"Finally, Quezon is a eulogy to the Philippines' revolutionary hopes and idealism; a resignation to a pathetic country's inescapable doom under so-called Great Men and self-proclaimed patriots"
Quezon,1339,6,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,"Problem is, Quezon is also the weakest of the trilogy from a structural level"
Quezon,1339,7,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,Its transition from a winking mockery of the cosmic joke that is Filipino government to the bleak demystification of Quezon's self-made myth isn't as smooth as it could've been
Quezon,1339,8,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,"The film's dragging length is impossible to deny by the midway point, though it's understandable given how long Quezon's story is"
Quezon,1339,9,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,"Worst of all, a literal half of Quezon's dialogue is a preachy lecture told at the audience"
Quezon,1339,10,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,"More than once, characters stop everything to become mouthpieces for the ideologies they represent and the timely commentary they embody"
Quezon,1339,11,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,"None of this is diegetic, and it's as awkward as it sounds"
Quezon,1339,12,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,I also don't really jive with how the film ends by blaming the Filipinos for things and bastards they can't control
Quezon,1339,13,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,"I too am disillusioned, but come on now with this ivory tower shit"
Quezon,1339,14,ad3ofc,,140.0,ltbx,"Then again, after seeing how Heneral Luna's point was deliberately ignored, used to prop up a murderous shithead, then basically losing a decade in the process, I'm not too surprised by Quezon treating Filipino viewers like a bunch of gullible idiots who need everything to be spoon-fed at least twice"

Quezon,1351,1,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"2025 RankedTBA Studios RankedBACKGROUNDThis franchise is one of the most unique franchises out there by connecting Philippine historical films with each other into a singular cinematic universe, which is distinct from those that are fictional in nature"
Quezon,1351,2,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"There are fictional elements in these films, but they are overall based on true events"
Quezon,1351,3,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"It may not be as popular as other franchises that have existed for decades, but it does not have to be, considering that the number of movies are three so far"
Quezon,1351,4,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"Regardless, it is still a franchise that I am going to look forward to for its next entry"
Quezon,1351,5,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"POSITIVESThe gap between Quezon from the previous film, Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, is seven years, which could be a bit too long to wait, but it was worth it because I did not expect for the third installment to turn out to be the best in the franchise so far"
Quezon,1351,6,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"The tone and style of filmmaking was different compared to its predecessors, which reflects how much Jerrold Tarog has grown as a filmmaker"
Quezon,1351,7,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"The choice to use the early stages of film as a way to reflect and criticize him as a leader not only adds more creativity and style to the film but also reflects the phase of technology at the time, and how it can be used as a powerful tool to spread influence"
Quezon,1351,8,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"The storytelling is not straightforward or linear, but it is organized into chapters based on who Manuel Quezon has to face or deal with in order to rise in power"
Quezon,1351,9,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"It is an approach that I did not expect, but it is a success for being able to tell a cohesive story"
Quezon,1351,10,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales's portrayal is one of the aspects that I was looking forward to seeing in the film, and he succeeded my expectations"
Quezon,1351,11,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"He has so much command, control, and confidence in his performance"
Quezon,1351,12,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"His enthusiasm and charisma match his goal to elevate his status by playing ""mind games"" with his opponents"
Quezon,1351,13,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,This puts the audience in an unsettling position because it becomes clear the kind of leader Manuel Quezon was
Quezon,1351,14,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,There are moments that would make me feel the intensity and pressure as I am piecing out the next moves of each player and the events that could happen
Quezon,1351,15,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,The production design was impressive that made me wonder about how they were built or where they were located
Quezon,1351,16,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,I also admire the various use of cinematography like panning and tracking to make the film livelier and to set the tone
Quezon,1351,17,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"MIXEDI was really impressed by the editing of this film, but there is a particular scene where the editing did not work for me because I felt that it did not fit into its tone"
Quezon,1351,18,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"This film has the most number of significant characters in the franchise and there are a lot of time jumps, which makes it a bit difficult to catch up with certain plotlines for me, but it is understandable because it reflects how complex and complicated the situations are"
Quezon,1351,19,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"NEGATIVESDue to how plenty the characters are, some of them were not given enough depth"
Quezon,1351,20,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,There are a few of lines of humor that did not work for me
Quezon,1351,21,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"CONCLUSIONIt is clear how the film wants Manuel Quezon to be portrayed, which they were able to accomplish"
Quezon,1351,22,maropa,,160.0,ltbx,"The tone and genre of this film may not be similar to the past films in the franchise like scenes involving gunshots, but its unique approach to the story makes it stand out from other Philippine historical films"
Quezon,1352,1,copainant,,160.0,ltbx,"Cinematography, pacing, acting, writing, and music were all soooo goood a shame tho bc you will really just get Quezon as a figure not as a person (i do understand why that is) BUT i left the theater knowing more about the people he affected than him personally"

Quezon,1377,2,cjazalea,,160.0,ltbx,"When you sit down and watch the film as it starts, highly likely you will suddenly be reminded of how Heneral Luna and Goyo went—the first two movies of Bayaniverse—and your expectation would somehow be related to those two"
Quezon,1377,3,cjazalea,,160.0,ltbx,"But Tarog did a different approach in Quezon, where satire is ultimately obvious, as much as it is also intended to be taken seriously"
Quezon,1377,4,cjazalea,,160.0,ltbx,"The fast-pace approach, the quick-changing of scenes, the conversations which aren't dragging, and riddles exchanged between the characters"
Quezon,1377,5,cjazalea,,160.0,ltbx,These same characters delivered well and Tarog made sure the comedic stance are appropriately placed where necessary
Quezon,1377,6,cjazalea,,160.0,ltbx,"It's just that for the majority of the time, I have this moment where the scenes are already at its peak, only to be steered in a different direction since, clearly, this film wants to tell more"

Quezon,1404,1,jornauxdereine,,160.0,ltbx,had the privilege to watch this last October 12 and let me just say that i enjoyed it very much
Quezon,1404,2,jornauxdereine,,160.0,ltbx,Manuel Quezon was the original politician of the Philippines
Quezon,1404,3,jornauxdereine,,160.0,ltbx,he knew how to control the people and how to get what he wants
Quezon,1404,4,jornauxdereine,,160.0,ltbx,"i do believe he ran as a government official to help the Filipino people and gain independence from the Americans, but once you get a taste of fame, money, and power, those intentions can be easily forgotten"
Quezon,1404,5,jornauxdereine,,160.0,ltbx,this movie came at the right time as it shows similarities on how our current government looks like
Quezon,1404,6,jornauxdereine,,160.0,ltbx,we are in the hands of fickle-minded politicians who only care about themselves
Quezon,1404,7,jornauxdereine,,160.0,ltbx,it's upsetting how even 90 years later we are still in the same mess
Quezon,1404,8,jornauxdereine,,160.0,ltbx,"i always envy how other countries have better transportation systems, better work opportunities, and just better everything just because they were served by people who want real change in their country"
Quezon,1404,9,jornauxdereine,,160.0,ltbx,"still, i would never stop dreaming for real change in our country, and i feel that this movie gives hope to its viewers"
Quezon,1404,10,jornauxdereine,,160.0,ltbx,"amazing performances from everyone in the cast, the message/story was clear, and can't wait to support more Filipino-made movies"
Quezon,1405,1,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,Source: www
Quezon,1405,4,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"htmlThe war is over, and now the battle is set in the world of politics"
Quezon,1405,5,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon takes us front and center into the seemingly heroic life of Manuel L
Quezon,1405,6,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon - a personality Filipinos look up to as a hero, a visionary, and one of the nation’s key founders"
Quezon,1405,7,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"But much like its predecessors in the Bayaniverse franchise, the film tackles head-on the sheer humanity and fallibility of Quezon, questioning whether the ends justify the means in the battlefield of power and the making of a young nation"
Quezon,1405,8,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,Manuel L
Quezon,1405,9,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon (Jericho Rosales) has just won the 1935 elections, becoming the first elected Filipino president and the second president of the Philippines"
Quezon,1405,10,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"But the journey to win that coveted and historically significant seat wasn’t an easy one, and you don’t get to the top without getting your hands dirty and making a few enemies along the way"
Quezon,1405,11,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"On its third outing, the Bayaniverse comes full circle by slowly shifting from the action-packed Heneral Luna to a somber drama in Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral and finally to a full blown political drama in Quezon"
Quezon,1405,12,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"The literal battles here are replaced by heated confrontations between Quezon and his contemporaries, showing how he fought and negotiated his way through power by any means necessary"
Quezon,1405,13,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"While we can’t say for sure if every revelation in the film is historically accurate, this is far from the textbook version of Quezon we grew up with"
Quezon,1405,14,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,This is a human Manuel Quezon up front and center
Quezon,1405,15,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"One who is charming, cunning, and deeply flawed"
Quezon,1405,16,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"The film hits hard, especially when viewed against the backdrop of today’s political landscape, reminding us that the people we idolize are often far more complicated than their public images suggests"
Quezon,1405,17,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"The film’s chapter-based narrative structure was something we appreciated, breaking down Quezon’s political battles into distinct segments"
Quezon,1405,18,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"However, the pacing felt uneven at times, with one chapter taking up a disproportionate part of the runtime"
Quezon,1405,19,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"In terms of performances, though, everyone delivered"
Quezon,1405,20,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"Mon Confiado stood out as a somber, grounded Emilio Aguinaldo, while Jericho Rosales embodied Quezon’s ambition and deceitful charm perfectly"
Quezon,1405,21,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"We found ourselves surprisingly invested in Quezon, and by the time the credits rolled, it hit us hard much like the other Bayaniverse films"
Quezon,1405,22,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"Like before, it left questioning whether the struggles we face today were shaped by the same heroes we’ve long revered"
Quezon,1405,23,reeladvicenet,,180.0,ltbx,"As a potential bookend to the franchise, Quezon closes the trilogy in the way we hoped it would which is powerful, reflective, and important for Filipinos"
Quezon,1406,1,_mrc,,180.0,ltbx,"sayang it would have been better (more realistic) if it was tj trinidad who portrayed as MLQ kasi sila talaga ang magka doppelganger (and both mestizo pa) nonetheless, jericho rosales pulled it off naman"
Quezon,1407,1,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"I think it's really best to now see all three films as one long project, all of it built around the deconstruction of the national hero"
Quezon,1407,2,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"It is through that lens that the character of Joven finally makes sense, the trilogy's audience surrogate who attaches himself to these larger-than-life figures, only to witness their downfall"
Quezon,1407,3,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,Joven believes in the Great Man: in the singular figures that will lead our nation out of the darkness
Quezon,1407,4,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"The film openly exposes that idea as foolhardy at best, because these Great Men are just people, too"
Quezon,1407,5,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,And they're all deeply flawed individuals that just get their dirty laundry swept under the bed precisely because they feel like they could be our saviors
Quezon,1407,6,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"This third film is practically a farce, with Rosales' Manuel L"
Quezon,1407,7,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon treating nationhood as a rigged game where only he can come out on top
Quezon,1407,8,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"He blatantly lies to his friends when it's convenient to do so, and accumulates power through every dirty trick in the politician's playbook"
Quezon,1407,9,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"He is the Ur-TRAPO, basically creating the systems that would make TRAPOs an inescapable reality in the Philippines"
Quezon,1407,10,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"Rosales is terrific here, his Quezon constantly performing for whoever's in front of him"
Quezon,1407,11,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"He projects being a loyal ally, or a mentor, or a friend, or indeed the great savior of the Philippines"
Quezon,1407,12,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"He plays that big, while in private moments Quezon is all vulnerability: a man who sees how delicate the house of cards he's built is, and worries about whether his health will allow him to see his dreams come to fruition"
Quezon,1407,13,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"I do think the film has a tendency to overexplain, to have characters speaking the subtext out loud"
Quezon,1407,14,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"But considering how some people took Heneral Luna, maybe this was always the tack to take"
Quezon,1407,15,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,"In any case, the film is unequivocal with how it wants us to see Quezon: he is what Chiz Escudero wants to be, and maybe what made Chiz Escudero possible"
Quezon,1407,16,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,Welcome to our Sad Republic
Quezon,1407,17,philbertdy,,160.0,ltbx,Here's the guy that made it happen
Quezon,1408,1,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,One McGuffin in the film is a Philippine peso coin that Quezon offers Joven the first time they meet
Quezon,1408,2,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon tells Joven, “pasisikatin ko ang pangalan mo,” “I will make your name famous"
Quezon,1408,3,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,” It is offered as a symbol of promise
Quezon,1408,4,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"Later in the film, we understand that Quezon is a businessman and how we sees his wits as he steers money into his electoral campaign"
Quezon,1408,5,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon knows how to invest in the hearts of the people he influences
Quezon,1408,6,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,He fully understands the weakness of Filipinos when it comes to “utang na loob” or debt of gratitude
Quezon,1408,7,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,We see this coin move between Quezon and Joven
Quezon,1408,8,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"Joven, who later finds out Quezon’s dirty tricks, returns the coin"
Quezon,1408,9,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"In the last act, the coin is returned, becoming a powerful metaphor for the cost Filipinos pay when voting for leaders who manipulate their perception"
Quezon,1408,10,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon is intriguing, comical at times, but otherwise compelling in that you’re hypnotized and drawn to the flipping of Quezon’s coin, who is on one side a hero, and on the other a flawed human being"
Quezon,1408,11,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"We see him as a player, incisive in his chess pieces in Philippine politics"
Quezon,1408,12,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,But also a sociopath when he deals with his cards in a game of poker with his enemies
Quezon,1408,13,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"The dialogue in the film never lets up, with pacing that keeps you glued to your seat"
Quezon,1408,14,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"The film makes you love-hate the man, and Jericho Rosales’ performance stands out, supported by an impressive powerhouse cast"
Quezon,1408,15,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"Overall, the film is witty and entertaining"
Quezon,1408,16,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"The political play may be on the nose, but should not alienate a regular Filipino moviegoer"
Quezon,1408,17,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,"And should be able to provide a proper dissection of the politicians we placed in their positions, and a wake-up call to vote better in the next elections"
Quezon,1408,18,reyraymundv,,160.0,ltbx,see video version on Tiktok or Instagram @reyraymundv
Quezon,1409,1,rifaaaaaaa,,140.0,ltbx,I get the hamilton of the ph
Quezon,1410,1,ica_cheng,,160.0,ltbx,"The Bayaniverse films have always been about showing how these heroes, whom we have put up on a pedestal, are in reality very flawed humans as well"
Quezon,1410,2,ica_cheng,,160.0,ltbx,"With ‘Quezon’ we not only see a very flawed human, but one that could have possibly set up the many political systems in play today"
Quezon,1410,3,ica_cheng,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales who plays the titular chameleon ‘Quezon’ brings his A game to the role
Quezon,1410,4,ica_cheng,,160.0,ltbx,"You can see his range with Quezon’s cunning smiles, and explosive anger"
Quezon,1410,5,ica_cheng,,160.0,ltbx,"The entire cast is a powerhouse one as well, bringing their own strengths to their characters"
Quezon,1410,6,ica_cheng,,160.0,ltbx,"Technically, I was impressed by how the film was shot, employing black and white film work to mimic films from the 1930s"
Quezon,1410,7,ica_cheng,,160.0,ltbx,"The production design was also on point with the props and costumes used, even the set pieces were impressive"
Quezon,1410,8,ica_cheng,,160.0,ltbx,"The story itself shows how Quezon, who might be seen as a hero, has some skeletons in his own closet, and even had some strings pulled to help his rise to power, the reveal is a treat, and even though this is already history, there was a scene where I had to hold my breath"
Quezon,1411,1,kapengmukha,,160.0,ltbx,I had the privilege of watching “Quezon” last Sunday
Quezon,1411,2,kapengmukha,,160.0,ltbx,"The film in some way, gave me closure about what our politics are today—though not the good kind of closure"
Quezon,1411,3,kapengmukha,,160.0,ltbx,"I remember during the last elections, one of my professors was kind enough to ask the whole class how we were holding up"
Quezon,1411,4,kapengmukha,,160.0,ltbx,"Of course, we felt cheated, beaten"
Quezon,1411,5,kapengmukha,,160.0,ltbx,"When I returned the question to him, he sighed and said, “Well, sanay na kami"
Quezon,1411,6,kapengmukha,,160.0,ltbx,"”Watching Quezon, that statement makes even more sense"
Quezon,1411,7,kapengmukha,,160.0,ltbx,The film is a mirror—almost like a satire—protesting to our faces what we’ve been enduring for years
Quezon,1411,8,kapengmukha,,160.0,ltbx,"We’re all familiar with the Filipino game of politics (brought to life first by our colonizers, if I may add), but seeing it up close through this film is heartbreaking"
Quezon,1411,9,kapengmukha,,160.0,ltbx,"We are being played by our politicians, and though we feel it deeply today, it’s something that has persisted for years"
Quezon,1411,10,kapengmukha,,160.0,ltbx,"In this case, even in our very early days of democracy"
Quezon,1411,11,kapengmukha,,160.0,ltbx,“Quezon” premieres today in over 260 cinemas nationwide

Quezon,1413,2,fredsaid,,180.0,ltbx,This film was certainly not romanticized nor haigographic
Quezon,1413,3,fredsaid,,180.0,ltbx,"Rosales played him as domineering, devious, dishonest -- promoting a political culture so toxic that still pervades our government even almost century hence"
Quezon,1413,4,fredsaid,,180.0,ltbx,"Rosales's Quezon was fiercely egotistical up to his ultimate declaration of ""I am the Philippines"

Quezon,1435,2,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,Mind you there's some bits here I would have loved to have seen pared down-- some speeches here often read as plain and didactic as thesis statements and some visuals come across as painfully obvious
Quezon,1435,3,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"There's a lot of reiteration of the theme of games being played here in the pull for power, even down to, in one scene, a clear chessboard referenced in both dialogue and image in a moment of Quezon's play for power and assembly of political pieces"
Quezon,1435,4,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"And to be honest, the whole idea of politics being a game is something that simply comes across as trite (I mean, there is already a biopic out there that exists called Quezon's Game)"
Quezon,1435,5,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"At the same time, you have to admire the ambition of just implementing those ideas so clearly on levels of craft and storytelling"
Quezon,1435,6,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,On the whole this is a sumptuously put together film that manages to make a whole lot of talking deeply delightful
Quezon,1435,7,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,This is especially remarkable considering that A

Quezon,1435,9,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon as a person is a character that, in actuality, should come across as deeply uncompelling due to how awful he actually is as a person-- which the film does not shy away from"
Quezon,1435,10,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"To tackle the former, some truly astounding filmmaking is on full display here, really playfully swinging that camera and injecting a constant sense of energy through the movement of visuals"
Quezon,1435,11,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"And for the latter, this is simply a sharp, wise, and surprisingly comedic script that really sells in its details"
Quezon,1435,12,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"Manuel Quezon ultimately is a mess of a human being, but the film really has a lot of fun examining how this man claimed power instead of resigning to singing praises on who this powerful person is"
Quezon,1435,13,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"It becomes truly engaging, even clever as a film that dissects a man who is gifted and unmatched at negotiation and talking but ultimately is still acknowledged as deeply problematic"
Quezon,1435,14,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"Other than that, the performances here really do a lot of heavy-lifting as well"
Quezon,1435,15,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"Rosales makes a full meal of the material, really exuding effortless and entertaining charm"
Quezon,1435,16,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,Confiado controls the screen whenever he appears

Quezon,1437,4,christian_davao,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon comes alive as a fierce politician who would stop at nothing to fulfill his ambition which is not to serve but to lead
Quezon,1437,5,christian_davao,,160.0,ltbx,He destroyed reputations and livelihoods of opponents and critics and possible nurtured the budding seeds of patronage politics which is still practiced contemporaneously
Quezon,1437,6,christian_davao,,160.0,ltbx,"He loved the limelight (at some point, even literally), thrived in public attention, and treated the people in his circle depending on how useful they would be for his advancement"
Quezon,1437,7,christian_davao,,160.0,ltbx,Public service is immaterial as long as benefits come pouring in
Quezon,1437,8,christian_davao,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales played Quezon with such aplomb and vigor that you couldn't help but be irritated at his antics

Quezon,1437,11,christian_davao,,160.0,ltbx,He owns the screen every time he is on which could be reminiscent of how the real Quezon chews the scenery whenever he could
Quezon,1437,12,christian_davao,,160.0,ltbx,The film is a good reminder of how devious politicians could be and how easily can we be blinded by adoration even if we should have known better

Quezon,1439,1,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,The finale (or is it
Quezon,1439,2,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,") to Jerrold Tarog’s ongoing thesis on what it means to be a national hero cleverly frames the retelling of the titular character’s life as a film within a film, one that’s purposefully laden with creative license and narrative freedom — blending truth and fiction to get its themes across (or, depending on your politics, to serve as propaganda or a fluff piece)"
Quezon,1439,3,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s fitting, then, that the final confrontation between the real-life character and the fictional surrogate who’s been our audience stand-in since the start of this interconnected project takes place inside a movie theater — the very medium through which myths are made"
Quezon,1439,4,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,"The film — and its film-within-the-film (yes, it gets that meta) — traces Quezon’s journey from his beginnings as part of the revolutionary army, to his days as a lawyer of the people, to his rise from local town governor to the first president of an autonomous Philippine government, free from direct foreign control"
Quezon,1439,5,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,"Each retelling presents not so much the man himself, but how he wanted to be remembered: as a patriot, a reformist, a visionary — or perhaps just a man intoxicated by the idea of power"
Quezon,1439,6,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,"We see a Quezon who thirsts not only for independence but also for control — and at times, for affairs and questionable advances — justifying the bending of truths and the moral grayness of politics as necessary evils to “effect real change"
Quezon,1439,7,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,"” He preaches independence to a populace not yet aware of what it truly means, wielding the idea as a political tool"
Quezon,1439,8,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,"Even when confronted by findings that autonomy may have come too soon — that corruption and cronyism were inevitable — he presses on, clinging to power in the name of progress"
Quezon,1439,9,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,"The production design is remarkable, a clear step up in scale and ambition — grand, intricate, and indicative of a much higher budget"
Quezon,1439,10,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,"Tarog’s decision to divide the film into cinematic “chapters” gives it an epic sweep, though it also makes the storytelling feel jumpy at times, leaving certain emotional and narrative threads unresolved"
Quezon,1439,11,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,"The script leans a bit too heavily on exposition, and the occasional bursts of humor sometimes undercut the otherwise serious tone"
Quezon,1439,12,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,"Still, Quezon (2025) succeeds where it matters most: in driving home its central theme — that our so-called national heroes, for all their grandeur and idealism, were also deeply flawed, morally ambiguous men shaped by ambition and compromise"
Quezon,1439,13,jansol,,160.0,ltbx,"It leaves us with a haunting question that lingers long after the credits roll:Are our political leaders — past and present — truly heroes, or simply the kind of villains we’ve learned to celebrate"
Quezon,1440,1,andreifab,,140.0,ltbx,"Script was too preachy, didactic, and Araling Panlipunan coded"

Quezon,1441,1,edzelr,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon closes the Bayaniverse trilogy with a dark third act leaving the viewers to ponder the lessons of history and how the game of politics is being played, realizing that the pursuit of power can corrupt and victimizes everyone"
Quezon,1441,2,edzelr,,160.0,ltbx,"The mini Quezon campaign movie was a stroke of genius, and becomes a distinct factor deviating from the first two films (Luna and Goyo)"
Quezon,1441,3,edzelr,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales, Mon Confiado, Iain Glen and the whole cast deliver remarkable performances"

Quezon,1448,3,solstjce,,180.0,ltbx,"NAGSILBI, PUMASLANG"
Quezon,1449,1,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"I'm still not convinced that we need a film about Quezon because he is so bland as a greedy populist political figure that any attempt to explore him will be preachy and on-the-nose, relentlessly hammering the problem with the current zeitgeist with little catharsis"
Quezon,1449,2,bcd2114,,,ltbx,It entailed a perilous narrow line between portraying him as a brilliant charismatic political mastermind or a typical power hungry politician who reflect most public servant in the government today that they framed this story with journalists and filmmakers who would provide the commentary for the audience
Quezon,1449,3,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It was looking at the eponymous protagonist from a distance, dissecting his essence and stripping him of all subjectivity, but it was also not presented objectively since they needed to ensure that the audience would not receive the wrong message, so more telegraphed commentary from the minor character"
Quezon,1449,4,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"They should have simply written an informative paper discussion instead of making a film about the subject, because they had a lot to say but no compelling story to tell"
Quezon,1449,5,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It was so disorganized narratively that halfway through the film, it was difficult to tell where it was meant to go, and at least three elderly audience members were sleeping and snoring loudly from my theater"
Quezon,1449,6,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"The visual language utilized in this movie is quite odd, most likely because they are unable to find a mean to convey the screenplay in a cinematic or visually appealing manner"
Quezon,1449,7,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It kept repeating the same shots and camera movements, which grew tedious at some point given the scale and time period it meant to communicate"
Quezon,1449,8,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"There are too many tilt and boom shots, and the blocking tends to follow a formalism with a lot of symmetrical orientation that looked so theatrical with the camera slowly moving in, even though they desperately needed dynamic filmmaking to hide the limited production design"
Quezon,1449,9,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It relied on theatricality to pull this off, and even the performances adapt that theatrical mechanics where it devolved into actors yelling their dialogue, which was noticeable with the pitch of the sound, prompting me to be conscious with the sound system to see whether the problem was with the theater or the sound mixing itself"
Quezon,1449,10,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"Not to nitpick the technical filmmaking further, but the way they filmed those propaganda short films looked too modern for the time period, and not because they were shot with a digital camera, which is totally understandable for budgetary purposes and accessibility of equipment, but they were edited and lit with a modern sensibility"
Quezon,1449,11,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"Nonetheless, the intent of those short films narratively was rather intriguing since I'm pretty sure they were fictional and only used as a narrative device for the commentary"
Quezon,1449,12,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It was trying to offer that film within a film structure, peeling away the propaganda, but it just became too on-the-nose and a convenient excuse for their chosen narrative structure"
Quezon,1449,13,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"They should have adopted a traditional narrative approach for this film since it would have been more compelling to show that point-of-view as Quezon rose and fell, with all of his hypocrisy and politicking, but doing so could have humanized the protagonist to the point that the audience would love him"
Quezon,1449,14,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It was a tricky film to make, and I appreciate that it did not humanize or glorify Quezon as an anti-hero at all, but it grew monotonous and painfully obvious when it could have been more mean-spirited and nuanced"
Quezon,1449,15,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"I am so familiar with Quezon's political career that I was able to follow all of the political strife in the film, which made me upset since it seemed like I was reading my notes from my history class rather than following a cohesive narrative"
Quezon,1449,16,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"However, I'm not sure what an audience unfamiliar with the subject matter can take away from this film, which moves from one battle after another with far too many expositions"
Quezon,1449,17,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It was bombastic and loaded with information, and without knowing the significance and relationship of each character, along with the political backdrop around the time, it will probably be alienating for others"
Quezon,1449,18,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It was still able to deliver some of the story in an innovative way, notably the Quezon versus Osmena fight, which is the most visually interesting, easy-to-follow and entertaining story throughout the film"
Quezon,1449,19,bcd2114,,,ltbx,It is actually impressive how it created a pace and tone that made sense for what it was trying to do narratively
Quezon,1449,20,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"Lastly, I want to discuss the Aguinaldo aspect, which was jarring since it nearly made him likable and probably the protagonist of this film, despite having a far worse reputation than most national heroes"
Quezon,1449,21,bcd2114,,,ltbx,It further claims that Quezon invented the beliefs that Aguinaldo killed Luna
Quezon,1449,22,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It was strange since the film rehabilitated him with a title credit that celebrated how he is the last one to die among Quezon, Osmena and Roxas"
Quezon,1449,23,bcd2114,,,ltbx,Are we expected to feel bad for him
Quezon,1449,24,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"I don't know about that, and the way it was dramatized at the end makes it seem like we were wrong to hate him all along"
Quezon,1449,25,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"Aside from being a nepo baby, I believe he tried to sold the Philippines revolution to the Spaniards in exchange for an exile in Hong Kong and allegedly 800,000 that is supposed to be handed in two parts, one of which were delivered but the other half was not, so he resumed the revolution"
Quezon,1449,26,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It almost feels like it was gaslighting the audience, but it was more likely illustrating that Quezon is beloved when he is actually worse"
Quezon,1449,27,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"**Endnote: How dare them not to mention Pascual Racuyal, the bulakenyo mechanic who run for presidency every election from 1935 until the snap election during 1986"

Quezon,1470,1,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"“I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by the Americans, because however a bad Filipino government might be, we can always change it"
Quezon,1470,2,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,” -Manuel L
Quezon,1470,3,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon, 1939Well we did it Quezon, we're now living in a country run like hell by Filipinos, like you said"
Quezon,1470,4,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Not sure how that last part of the quote will fare out, but let's hope it'll ring true at some point"
Quezon,1470,5,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon is yet again another substantive display of one of the Philippine's most important historical figures
Quezon,1470,6,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Following Heneral Luna and Goyo, this is Jerrold Tarog's third attempt of this kind of historical drama that puts these historical figures on the spotlight in a way that provides discourse on the political state of the Philippines during their time; a discourse of which that's unfortunately relevant to this day"
Quezon,1470,7,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"As opposed to both Antonio Luna and Gregorio Del Pilar, who were generals, this film focuses on Manuel L"
Quezon,1470,8,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon, a prominent Filipino political figure in the early 20th century (the 2nd Philippine President, specifically)"
Quezon,1470,9,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"While he's more known in the history books (or at least how I was taught in school) as someone who made changes in the Philippine government to make the nation more independent, the movie gives a transparent perspective of his rise to Presidency in both a positive light and negative light, the latter of which is shown in the misdeeds and manipulation he did behind the scenes in order to gain his power"
Quezon,1470,10,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"It's come to the point where the interactions feel so Mean Girls-coded, in a sense where Filipino political affairs feel so parallel to high-school drama, where people try to one-up themselves over others in the political game of seeing whoever takes the highest form of power"
Quezon,1470,11,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"It's funny to think about at first, but it's much more depressing if you really put your mind to it; Filipino politicians have never really gotten past this political game for power that it's still very much relevant to this day"
Quezon,1470,12,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Instead of addressing the actual issues in the country like the lack of education, proper infrastructure, and better living conditions for the lower class, you see Quezon do a lot of back-and-forth between his opponents and other people just to retain his position"
Quezon,1470,13,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"And when he does interact with the lower class, he instills this fake hope in the independence of the Filipino nation, which sounds so good that even those who don't know what the word ""independence"" actually means were sold by his charismatic and inspiring words"
Quezon,1470,14,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Though Quezon has done a lot of good for the country, the film shows just how flawed he is, and how we shouldn't just take the positive impact he had, but also take in his wrongdoings as a view on the saddening reality of politics"
Quezon,1470,15,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"There's a recurring motif of characters being tired of all the back-and-forth interactions that lead to nothing productive, which feels very reflective of how the director Jerrold Tarog feels about modern Filipino politics; he's tired of his more subtle approach in his two aforementioned films that he tackles the topic in this film in a more straightforward way"
Quezon,1470,16,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"As a result, the film can get preachy and waaaaay too obvious in its approach to this topic, which throws subtlety out of the way"
Quezon,1470,17,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"But I understand how this is done intentionally to really get the point across, especially to the young Filipino viewers who will be watching this and be urged by educators in doing so, especially through the student discounts (of which I got, because I'm still in college lol)"
Quezon,1470,18,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Normally, I'd be against this obvious approach in such an important topic, but seeing that it intends on educating the Filipino youth regarding the political state of the country, and seeing how poor the reading and art comprehension are of most Filipinos, I can forgive the film for this"
Quezon,1470,19,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"It has a lot of good things to say, albeit there were some inaccuracies here and there, though they were done for a more cohesive narrative and theme throughout"
Quezon,1470,20,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales gave a really good performance as the titular character, Iain Glenn was a standout to me, despite his considerably short appearance, and there weren't any bad actors in this at all"
Quezon,1470,21,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Tarog's direction was quite good, the pacing was always on point and never got boring, the cinematography was mostly great, and the production and set design were so insanely well done and there was a lot of attention to detail"
Quezon,1470,22,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Though the editing can sometimes be jarring and the music gets a bit overbearing at times, the film was still really good overall"
Quezon,1470,23,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Really hope that the students watching this film will take the good out of the film and be inspired to become the change that we need in the Philippines, especially since the future isn't looking so bright for our country"
Quezon,1470,24,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"I liked Lav Diaz's Magellan, but honestly I wish this were picked as the entry to the Oscars for Best Foreign Film instead"
Quezon,1470,25,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,This was a much more accessible film that will definitely speak to a lot of Filipinos and will definitely leave a lasting impact to Filipinos much more than Magellan did
Quezon,1470,26,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Not saying that the entry should be chosen based on accessibility, but rather, it should be chosen based on how important it is in representing the country's cinema as a whole, and this was a great representation for our country's cinema and our history"
Quezon,1470,27,itsjustarcher,,160.0,ltbx,"Sorry Lav Diaz, still love you tho king"

Quezon,1547,10,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,"Sir Mon Confiado is always on top of his game in everything he does, nabigyan ng character arc si Aguinaldo dito, I'm also happy that Joven was given a spotlight here and kudos to Sir Cris Villanueva and Arron Villaflor"
Quezon,1547,11,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,Bagay Kay Karylle ang role na Aurora Quezon
Quezon,1547,12,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,"The cinematography is good, the set design is perfect"
Quezon,1547,13,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,It feels like I was transported to the Commonwealth era
Quezon,1547,14,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,"The story focuses on the rise to power of Quezon but I wish they also featured his early life like his lovestory with Aurora, exciting story Sana yun since they were cousins (Yes"
Quezon,1547,15,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,") and also I wish nabigyan din ng highlight si Dona Aurora since she's a vital character in Quezon's life and to the history of the Philippines, Quezon was told in a non linear storytelling and sometimes I got confused if the scene is a backstory, or a scene to Nadia's movie or a scene in the present time, may blur yun department na yun and how I wish it was polished"
Quezon,1547,16,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,"After watching the movie as I leave the cinemas, mapapaisip ka, bakit sa Kabila ng lahat, mula noon hanggang ngayon, why are we still electing trapo leaders"
Quezon,1547,17,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,Para syang multo na hindi matakasan
Quezon,1547,18,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon is an important movie event best experience in cinemas, it mirrors the current state of our nation with the recent happenings nowadays (That Quezon vs Osmena for example) and I hope this movie ignites our awakening to choose and vote the right leaders"
Quezon,1547,19,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,We should act now
Quezon,1547,20,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,"Overall, Quezon is a good swan song to the Bayaniverse"
Quezon,1547,21,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,Don't leave the cinemas during the credit rolls or you'll miss SOMETHING
Quezon,1547,22,cjsays,,160.0,ltbx,Is it an end of an era or a start of a new revolution
Quezon,1548,1,navimendoza,,200.0,ltbx,Had a privilege to watch this movie prior to its release date and I might say that Bayaniverse never disappoints
Quezon,1548,2,navimendoza,,200.0,ltbx,DIREK JERROLD never disappoints
Quezon,1548,3,navimendoza,,200.0,ltbx,I am so happy sa outcome ng film–being a part of it also is a dream come true kahit maliit na help lang
Quezon,1548,4,navimendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"After watching this film, nakuha ang gigil ko at masasabi mo palang na, noon palang ang dumi na ng pulitika"
Quezon,1548,5,navimendoza,,200.0,ltbx,Very relevant sa panahon ngayon
Quezon,1548,6,navimendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"Wala na akong ibang masasabi pa, I am so proud of this film and I am happy to be a part of this"
Quezon,1548,7,navimendoza,,200.0,ltbx,WATCH QUEZON
Quezon,1548,8,navimendoza,,200.0,ltbx,Ito ay isang paalala para sa mga Pilipino
Quezon,1549,1,daemirius,,120.0,ltbx,"As an exploration of MLQ's life and rise to power, the film mostly does okay"
Quezon,1549,2,daemirius,,120.0,ltbx,"As the culmination of the Bayaniverse, it was ""meh"""
Quezon,1549,3,daemirius,,120.0,ltbx,"I feel like they've lost the spark with which they started this whole thing (probably because Tarog, EA Rocha, and the others involved never even really intended to make it a trilogy)"
Quezon,1549,4,daemirius,,120.0,ltbx,"Joven (who was initially a symbol for the youth and the audience's lenses into Heneral Luna) had lost his function in the previous films, and had become a character deeply intertwined with MLQ's politics"
Quezon,1549,5,daemirius,,120.0,ltbx,"The dialogue and pacing, too, was evidently not as spicy as Heneral Luna's (or even Goyo's)"
Quezon,1549,6,daemirius,,120.0,ltbx,"Overall, it's an okay movie"
Quezon,1550,1,raruuu,,160.0,ltbx,spoiler: nanalo si Quezon sa Election
Quezon,1551,1,jashkimd,,180.0,ltbx,"When Quezon declared, “I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by the Americans,” I used to think it was just a hyperbolic quip—an impassioned cry from a man starved for independence"
Quezon,1551,2,jashkimd,,180.0,ltbx,"But now, it feels like a prophecy"
Quezon,1551,3,jashkimd,,180.0,ltbx,A mirror held up to the nation we’ve become
Quezon,1551,4,jashkimd,,180.0,ltbx,Jerrold Tarog’s final installment in the Bayaniverse trilogy—Quezon—carried with it a weight of expectation
Quezon,1551,5,jashkimd,,180.0,ltbx,Just as Luna and Goyo startled a curious…
Quezon,1552,1,cinephileabi,,140.0,ltbx,"It blends humor, satire, truth, and explicitness"
Quezon,1552,2,cinephileabi,,140.0,ltbx,"The cinematography is superb, and I like how unique it is compared to other local films across genres—especially how distinct it feels from Jerrold Tarog’s Bayaniverse"
Quezon,1552,3,cinephileabi,,140.0,ltbx,"And like many other political films in the Philippines, it doesn’t necessarily offer something new, but it gave me a fresh perspective on the downside of hero worship—how we often forget that the heroes we idolize are still human, flawed, and capable of mistakes"
Quezon,1552,4,cinephileabi,,140.0,ltbx,"“Hindi nakalaya ang mga Pilipino, hindi nakalaya ang ating bayan"
Quezon,1552,5,cinephileabi,,140.0,ltbx,"At ang malupit na katotohanan: sa pagkakataong ito, wala nang bansang kailangang manakop upang ipagkait sa atin ang kalayaan—sapagkat tayong mga Pilipino mismo ang hindi marunong lumaya"
Quezon,1552,6,cinephileabi,,140.0,ltbx,"Sa sarili nating paninikil, ganid, ang kulturang utang na loob at katapatan sa maling damo, at sa paulit-ulit na pagpili sa sarili kaysa sa bayan"
Quezon,1552,7,cinephileabi,,140.0,ltbx,"Ilang henerasyon na nating binibihag ang ating mga sarili, ilang Quezon pa ba ang darating upang humingi ng independencia at gaya niya ay paulit-ulit na maligaw ng landas"
Quezon,1552,8,cinephileabi,,140.0,ltbx,"Sapagkat sa bawat panahon, may Quezon sa ating lahat—ang hunyangong handang isuko ang katotohanan, basta’t manatiling nasa trono ng ilusyon"
Quezon,1552,9,cinephileabi,,140.0,ltbx,” (Excerpt from my reflection essay on [Quezon])
Quezon,1553,1,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,"Tarog walks us through Quezon’s life like flipping through a well-worn autobiography, and honestly, it hits different when you realize how little has changed"
Quezon,1553,2,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,"The film’s a mirror held up to our current mess—politicians are still clowns, shape-shifting for applause and votes"
Quezon,1553,3,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,What makes it work is how Quezon isn’t sanitized
Quezon,1553,4,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,"He’s brilliant and messy, calculating yet genuinely burning for independence"
Quezon,1553,5,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,A complicated guy in complicated times
Quezon,1553,6,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,The kind of biopic that teaches you something about today while looking at yesterday
Quezon,1553,9,ohemjayps,,140.0,ltbx,Philippine politics is a f*cking joke… until now

Quezon,1557,4,flightclub,,180.0,ltbx,quezon through the lens of a filmmaker experienced with the administration and sided with the opposition -- paid propaganda juxtaposed with informed criticism

Quezon,1557,6,flightclub,,180.0,ltbx,intention and hope muddied by ambition and greed
Quezon,1557,7,flightclub,,180.0,ltbx,"we see #him through an outsider's pov -- not just any outsider, his niece; no matter how close we get, we'll never truly know who he is"

Quezon,1559,1,heyrow,,,ltbx,It’s always a peculiar experience watching a Jerrold Tarog film
Quezon,1559,2,heyrow,,,ltbx,There’s a quiet unease that comes with it
Quezon,1559,3,heyrow,,,ltbx,Maybe it’s because I’ve followed his work long enough to know he never really plays it safe; every film feels like a balancing act between vision and vulnerability
Quezon,1559,4,heyrow,,,ltbx,"I know he’s not flawless, and neither are his films, even the ones I hold close (Confessional, Senior Year, Bliss)"
Quezon,1559,5,heyrow,,,ltbx,But there’s something about the way he tells stories that always feels searching and alive
Quezon,1559,6,heyrow,,,ltbx,He’s never been after polish (and sometimes that’s the most frustrating part of his cinema) but he’s always been after answers
Quezon,1559,7,heyrow,,,ltbx,New answers to the kind of questions only a history geek would ask in the shower
Quezon,1559,8,heyrow,,,ltbx,"So whenever I enter a Direk Jerrold film, I brace, because I know it might reveal something I wasn’t ready to see about us, or about what we’ve become"
Quezon,1559,9,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Of all the BAYANIVerse films, QUEZON feels the most adventurous — not in scale, but in spirit"
Quezon,1559,10,heyrow,,,ltbx,It’s Direk Jerrold’s boldest experiment in this saga: a film that knows it’s a film
Quezon,1559,11,heyrow,,,ltbx,"He borrows from Mike de León’s Bayaning Third World, playing with the grammar of cinema itself: reenactments, reconstructions, meta-frames"
Quezon,1559,12,heyrow,,,ltbx,"The satire is there, but softer now, as if Direk Jerrold has accepted that to film history is to fictionalize it"
Quezon,1559,13,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Every frame of patriotism is, by nature, a kind of performance"
Quezon,1559,14,heyrow,,,ltbx,What’s interesting is how Quezon almost feels like a return to where Direk Jerrold began: to the heart of his first feature Confessional
Quezon,1559,15,heyrow,,,ltbx,That film was all about guilt and exposure
Quezon,1559,16,heyrow,,,ltbx,"It blurred the line between truth and performance, between what’s real and what’s edited for the camera"
Quezon,1559,17,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Quezon carries that same unease, only now the canvas is larger: not one man’s confession, but an entire nation’s"
Quezon,1559,18,heyrow,,,ltbx,It’s still about projection; about editing who we say we are
Quezon,1559,19,heyrow,,,ltbx,"In both films, Direk Jerrold wrestles with the same dilemma: that the story of the country, like the story of the self, is always partly fabricated"
Quezon,1559,20,heyrow,,,ltbx,The distance between public myth and private truth isn’t new to him; it’s the ground he’s been standing on all along
Quezon,1559,21,heyrow,,,ltbx,"The beginning, though, is difficult"
Quezon,1559,22,heyrow,,,ltbx,"It unfolds like an essay: brisk, detached, almost indifferent to its own characters"
Quezon,1559,23,heyrow,,,ltbx,"We’re given on-screen identifiers to remember names, but no real reason to care about them yet"
Quezon,1559,24,heyrow,,,ltbx,It’s matter-of-fact to the point of numbness
Quezon,1559,25,heyrow,,,ltbx,"And while I understand the intention — that deliberate coldness, that resistance to sentimentality — it keeps me at a distance"
Quezon,1559,26,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Maybe that’s the point: that our first encounter with history is always sterile, a list of names before they become people"
Quezon,1559,27,heyrow,,,ltbx,But it’s still a hard place to start for a film that ultimately depends on emotional investment
Quezon,1559,28,heyrow,,,ltbx,"If the audience doesn’t feel invited in, the ideas risk floating above the story, detached from the very humanity they’re trying to illuminate"
Quezon,1559,29,heyrow,,,ltbx,"It’s a fascinating gamble: to alienate first, and hope empathy arrives later"
Quezon,1559,30,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Eventually, it warms"
Quezon,1559,31,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Theory turns into theater: infidelity, betrayal, the exhausting pettiness of ambition"
Quezon,1559,32,heyrow,,,ltbx,"The shift happens quietly, and suddenly, these figures in textbooks begin to ache, to resent, to want"
Quezon,1559,33,heyrow,,,ltbx,The sarcasm becomes sorrow
Quezon,1559,34,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Direk Jerrold lets Quezon’s charisma clash with his contradictions, and the film begins to reveal what the trilogy has been circling all along: that our heroes were never saints, just men rehearsing greatness for a stage called history"
Quezon,1559,35,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Still, Quezon is uneven in texture"
Quezon,1559,36,heyrow,,,ltbx,It moves between stylization and realism so freely that the seams sometimes show
Quezon,1559,37,heyrow,,,ltbx,"One moment it looks painterly, the next like something out of a morning kiddie show"
Quezon,1559,38,heyrow,,,ltbx,Some transitions feel deliberate; others feel like accidents
Quezon,1559,39,heyrow,,,ltbx,"At times I even caught myself wondering — is this stylized, or a little off"
Quezon,1559,40,heyrow,,,ltbx,"But at some point, the film begins to carry those inconsistencies as part of its design"
Quezon,1559,41,heyrow,,,ltbx,"The tone itself becomes a kind of argument: that history, like cinema, is never seamless"
Quezon,1559,42,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Its rough edges start to feel less like errors and more like evidence: that the story of a nation is always told through competing frames, through sincerity and performance, myth and memory all bleeding into one another"
Quezon,1559,43,heyrow,,,ltbx,"It’s also the most intimate of the trilogy, and paradoxically, the smallest"
Quezon,1559,44,heyrow,,,ltbx,"The 1935 election feels less like a historical event and more like a town contest, the scale reduced to smoke-filled rooms, small plaza gatherings, and even smaller street marches"
Quezon,1559,45,heyrow,,,ltbx,"But maybe that’s where politics truly happens: not on the battlefield, but in the room where stories are shaped or in those short walks in between campaign speeches"
Quezon,1559,46,heyrow,,,ltbx,"The Philippines, Direk Jerrold seems to say, wasn’t born in fire but in fog — not through heroism, but through negotiation"
Quezon,1559,47,heyrow,,,ltbx,"He shrinks the myth to scale, and somehow that feels truer"
Quezon,1559,48,heyrow,,,ltbx,Jericho Rosales is remarkable
Quezon,1559,49,heyrow,,,ltbx,"His Quezon is a performer to his bones: charming, strategic, aware that every gesture is part of a show"
Quezon,1559,50,heyrow,,,ltbx,It’s a portrayal that understands leadership as theater
Quezon,1559,51,heyrow,,,ltbx,But it’s Karylle as Aurora Quezon and Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña who give the film its soul probably because I believe they are able to play characters that are also written better
Quezon,1559,52,heyrow,,,ltbx,They play the roles history often edits out — the ones who absorb power’s aftershocks
Quezon,1559,53,heyrow,,,ltbx,Their warmth gives the film the emotional gravity that its cleverness sometimes withholds
Quezon,1559,54,heyrow,,,ltbx,And the film is funny
Quezon,1559,55,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Not that it’s a surprise, since the trailers already gave that away"
Quezon,1559,56,heyrow,,,ltbx,But what’s interesting is how the humor works; it never feels forced
Quezon,1559,57,heyrow,,,ltbx,"In all the politics of it all, the humor really lands"
Quezon,1559,58,heyrow,,,ltbx,"You laugh, but it’s the kind of laughter that feels like recognition — the ache of realizing how cyclical our myths have become"
Quezon,1559,59,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Watching Quezon today, it’s hard not to see the reflection: new leaders, same spectacle, the same applause for the illusion of change"
Quezon,1559,60,heyrow,,,ltbx,"The crowd has changed, but the choreography hasn’t"
Quezon,1559,61,heyrow,,,ltbx,Politics has always been performance; we’ve just upgraded the stage lights
Quezon,1559,62,heyrow,,,ltbx,"[SPOILER ALERT]What makes Quezon linger though isn’t how it ends, but how it fades"
Quezon,1559,63,heyrow,,,ltbx,"In a quiet mid-credits scene, a radio hums with “Mambo Magsaysay"
Quezon,1559,64,heyrow,,,ltbx,"” It sounds harmless at first, even nostalgic, until it sinks in"
Quezon,1559,65,heyrow,,,ltbx,"The trilogy that began with men dying for freedom ends with a jingle: a hero reborn not through valor, but through publicity"
Quezon,1559,66,heyrow,,,ltbx,"The revolution has learned rhythm; the myth, melody"
Quezon,1559,67,heyrow,,,ltbx,What began in blood and fire now survives through broadcast
Quezon,1559,68,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Heroism no longer dies; it loops endlessly on air, selling itself back to a nation that keeps forgetting"
Quezon,1559,69,heyrow,,,ltbx,Maybe that’s Direk Jerrold’s quiet brilliance
Quezon,1559,70,heyrow,,,ltbx,Heneral Luna was about rage — the passion that builds nations
Quezon,1559,71,heyrow,,,ltbx,Goyo was about disillusionment — how conviction collapses once heroism becomes habit
Quezon,1559,72,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Quezon is about myth — how belief turns into image, and image into machinery"
Quezon,1559,73,heyrow,,,ltbx,It’s not just the end of a trilogy; it’s the moment when the revolution becomes a system
Quezon,1559,74,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Because Quezon, for all his brilliance, also built the architecture of the politics we still live in: the patronage, the alliances, the transactional warmth that makes power feel personal but never equal"
Quezon,1559,75,heyrow,,,ltbx,The birth of democracy was also the birth of dependency
Quezon,1559,76,heyrow,,,ltbx,"And if the hinted Magsaysay film ever comes, then it will tell the story of how that system learned to sing"
Quezon,1559,77,heyrow,,,ltbx,"Because Magsaysay was the first modern president sold like an idea — a leader branded through music, charisma, and American approval"
Quezon,1559,78,heyrow,,,ltbx,His legacy marks the shift from politics as negotiation to politics as emotion
Quezon,1559,79,heyrow,,,ltbx,"If Luna died for the nation, and Quezon built it, then Magsaysay would show how the nation learned to perform itself — how conviction turned into choreography, leadership into branding, and the state into a stage where power thrives not by being just, but by looking relatable"
Quezon,1559,80,heyrow,,,ltbx,The question now isn’t “Who is the hero
Quezon,1559,81,heyrow,,,ltbx,"” but “Who’s holding the camera — and for which story, for whose gain, and at what cost to the truth"
Quezon,1560,1,leechanghwang,,200.0,ltbx,Ang husay naman talaga ng team ng bayaniverse

Quezon,1561,1,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"The long-awaited final chapter in the Bayaniverse trilogy brilliantly shifts gears from the battlefield to the backroom, immersing us in the ruthless political game that defined the early Philippine Commonwealth"
Quezon,1561,2,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"If nothing else, it shows that 100 years ago marumi na ang pulitika sa Pilipinas"
Quezon,1561,3,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"The story is eerily reminiscent of the current political landscape na kung sinabi mo sakin na last month lang sinulat at ginawa to, pwedeng maniwala ako"
Quezon,1561,4,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"Director Jerrold Tarog, once again, doesn't offer a statue but a scalpel, dissecting the myth of Manuel L"
Quezon,1561,6,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"This film is a compelling, dialogue-driven epic that strips away the heroic luster to reveal the manipulative acumen, charm, and sheer ambition required to forge a nation"
Quezon,1561,7,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s a messy portrait that feels urgently relevant, proving that the high drama of power politics can be as engrossing as any war epic"
Quezon,1561,8,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"For me, the performances elevate the entire experience"
Quezon,1561,9,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales is genuinely great in the titular role; he captures the former President's fire and charisma while still managing to hint at the deep contradictions beneath the tailored suits
Quezon,1561,10,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"However, this is truly an ensemble piece, and Romnick Sarmenta (as Sergio Osmeña) and Mon Confiado (reprising Aguinaldo) also shine, providing compelling foils and complexity"
Quezon,1561,11,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,They make the political chess feel weighty and personal
Quezon,1561,12,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"Game of Thrones alum Iain Glen is a welcome and commanding presence, though I have to admit, his very distinct British accent occasionally pulls me out of the moment because he’s playing an American character - but maybe that’s just me being picky"
Quezon,1561,13,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,I genuinely admire and respect the approach that Jerrold Tarog and team chose for this movie
Quezon,1561,14,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,A simpler but probably more boring version of this would be a straight up biopic that mythologizes Quezon
Quezon,1561,15,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"That being said, I sincerely hope our audiences are truly ready for a treatment of a national subject such as this, one that so meticulously deconstructs the idea of a great man"
Quezon,1561,16,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,It requires a level of critical historical consumption that can sometimes be lacking
Quezon,1561,17,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"This film isn't just a history lesson; it's a call for discernment, and I hope Pinoys are able to understand and grapple with the deeper message it provides"
Quezon,1561,18,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"My worst fear, and what keeps me thinking about the film's potential impact, is for people to come out of this movie with a shallow understanding—with the notion that all politicians are fundamentally flawed, so it's okay to support the corrupt ones they are currently ""fans"" of"
Quezon,1561,19,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"I have this suspicion that when some people saw Heneral Luna, ang takeaway nila ay “Kita mo na"
Quezon,1561,20,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,Kaya okay lang yung matapang tsaka palamura e” rather than the bigger and more important lessons that the movie tried to impart about nationalism
Quezon,1561,21,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon shows complexity, not blanket moral equivalence"
Quezon,1561,22,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"It shows a flawed man achieving monumental goals, but critically examines the cost"
Quezon,1561,23,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,It is a brilliant and challenging piece of filmmaking with terrific performances from the cast
Quezon,1561,24,reyview,,160.0,ltbx,"It should be watched, discussed, and debated for years to come"

Quezon,1568,1,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,"I’ve always loved antihero narratives, and Quezon fits that mold perfectly"
Quezon,1568,2,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,The film illustrates how populism can bring one to power
Quezon,1568,3,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,"It skirted on a single word, ""independence"", and forces you to ask what it has ever truly meant"
Quezon,1568,4,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,"After all, the government we have now is the same one we’ve always had, merely dressed in different fashions for each generation"
Quezon,1568,5,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,But where the film stumbles is in telling historical facts
Quezon,1568,6,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,Too much of its narrative hinges on the fictional character Joven Hernando and his descent into Quezon’s pitfall of populism and cronyism
Quezon,1568,7,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,This might have worked if Quezon were intended as historical fiction
Quezon,1568,8,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,But it's not
Quezon,1568,9,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,It focused too much on Joven’s disillusionment and Quezon’s perspective that it glossed over factual events a historical film should have covered
Quezon,1568,10,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,"Overall, the film was both compelling and timely"
Quezon,1568,11,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,I only hope we finally learn not to mistake charisma with integrity
Quezon,1568,12,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,"Lies and manipulations, however noble the cause, are always self-serving"
Quezon,1568,13,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,"In a nation built on lies, speaking the truth is the greatest act of defiance"
Quezon,1568,14,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,When will we ever learn
Quezon,1568,15,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,Only history can tell
Quezon,1568,16,xaviercomplex,,140.0,ltbx,"But one thing is certain: every strongman, liar and fascist cult leader is destined for downfall"
Quezon,1569,1,circusventing,,120.0,ltbx,i'm always a sucker for stories revolving around political subterfuge
Quezon,1569,2,circusventing,,120.0,ltbx,quezon is a biting commentary on how the philippines is being traded behind the scenes
Quezon,1569,3,circusventing,,120.0,ltbx,"see how it parallels today; indeed, does this country know independence beyond the sweetness of the word"
Quezon,1569,4,circusventing,,120.0,ltbx,personally thought this was the weakest movie in the trilogy costume and setting-wise
Quezon,1569,5,circusventing,,120.0,ltbx,i feel like they significantly downsized the budget there
Quezon,1569,6,circusventing,,120.0,ltbx,"i know they didn't wear suits and barongs all the time, but the quality of the…"

Quezon,1576,2,lizzycapellan,,160.0,ltbx,"”The thing about the Bayaniverse is how it reminds us that our national heroes’ lives were deeply intertwined, contrary to what they teach us in history books as if they all lived in different eras"
Quezon,1576,3,lizzycapellan,,160.0,ltbx,There’s no doubt about Direk Jerrold Tarog’s skill in weaving parallel timelines; the echoes between past and present are undeniable
Quezon,1576,4,lizzycapellan,,160.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t just revisit history — it holds up a mirror, asking: in all our struggles today, do we even remember what we’re really fighting for"
Quezon,1577,1,skylewalker,,160.0,ltbx,quezon would have loved charli xcx’s “sympathy is a knife”
Quezon,1578,1,gmcajayon,,60.0,ltbx,"Always a bad sign when a historical biopic feels more like a high school history lesson, and that's already with liberties taken creatively"
Quezon,1578,2,gmcajayon,,60.0,ltbx,It's also quite funny how Quezon took more than 2 hours to show how Filipino (and American
Quezon,1578,3,gmcajayon,,60.0,ltbx,") elites have used senseless politicking and nationalist posturing in their selfish quest to acquire more political power, only to end up crediting landgrabbers and bureaucrat capitalists as its producers"
Quezon,1578,4,gmcajayon,,60.0,ltbx,"Even funnier was how Tarog and co used Joven's character arc as a preemptive defensive measure against valid critiques of this film's real-life political-economic implications (""I have a family to feed"")"
Quezon,1578,5,gmcajayon,,60.0,ltbx,End this Bayaniverse franchise now

Quezon,1579,7,ayicakes,,160.0,ltbx,"as the film explores and deconstructs the image of a ‘heroic’ figure, it effectively serves as a humbling realization that what we see on the big screen is unfortunately still our reality today, and that we’ve still got a long way to go in attaining true independence"

Quezon,1586,1,lpk325,,180.0,ltbx,"Writer/Director Jerrold Tarog completes his nationalistic trilogy that began with the bombast of John Arcilla in HENERAL LUNA, the subdued and conflicted Paolo Avelino in GOYO and finally, the bravura and high drama of QUEZON"

Quezon,1588,1,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"It's odd that a film so much about a man who campaigned on national independence, whose supposed saving grace is that he ultimately did bring it about, says so little about what that independence even meant"
Quezon,1588,2,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,This film adds nothing to the discourse of national independence
Quezon,1588,3,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"This is another glossy entry to Jerrold Tarog’s “Bayani-verse” series of films, which some have described as an attempt to deconstruct the Philippine national hero"
Quezon,1588,4,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,It's the most fictionalized of the three*
Quezon,1588,5,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,And it's another one that gets worse the more you think about it
Quezon,1588,6,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"Hopefully it’s the last, as they say, for I have no interest in seeing another one of these movies about Ramon Magsaysay"
Quezon,1588,7,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,My biggest issue with this film in particular is that it subsists so much on the surface of its subject matter that it fails to say anything interesting about the context in which its events occur
Quezon,1588,8,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,What does it actually say about the 50-year American occupation of the Philippines
Quezon,1588,9,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,What does it actually say about Manuel Quezon as a president
Quezon,1588,10,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,As a leader of the country
Quezon,1588,11,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,What does it say about how everyday Filipinos experienced his rule
Quezon,1588,12,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,Does it say anything at all
Quezon,1588,13,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"It's mostly about Manuel Quezon as a politician, or more so, how he performs politics"
Quezon,1588,14,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"It's about his two-facedness, his scrupulousness, his constant need to one-up his political opponents at any chance he gets"
Quezon,1588,15,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,The film successfully contextualizes the absurd spectacle of 21st century politics by telling us that its roots go back to the very inception of our political independence nearly a century ago
Quezon,1588,16,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,But this is also where the film's issues lie
Quezon,1588,17,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"The film appears to critique Quezon for how he participated in and fine-tuned the garish spectacle of modern political campaigning, of setting the stage for our present day election cycles"
Quezon,1588,18,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"But despite the film’s acknowledgment of the shallowness of these tactics, it still chooses to disproportionately focus on them"
Quezon,1588,19,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"It reduces the American occupation of the Philippines to a series of interpersonal squabbles, as opposed to focusing on the actual impact of Quezon’s rule over the Filipinos at the time"
Quezon,1588,20,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"Based on what we see in the film, the legacy of Manuel Quezon is in how he engaged with politics, as opposed to the impact of his actions on everyday people"
Quezon,1588,21,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,But what was the actual situation of Filipinos back then
Quezon,1588,22,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,One of the only times we hear the perspective of a farmer is to highlight their ignorance of the word “independence
Quezon,1588,23,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,” A few scenes later we hear Osmeña and Quezon agree with Leonard Wood that the Filipinos just aren't ready for independence yet
Quezon,1588,24,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,But why
Quezon,1588,25,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,The film doesn't explore it further
Quezon,1588,26,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"And in the latter half of the film, some of the more intriguing critiques of Quezon’s political impact on the country are undermined by the fact that they’re coming out of the mouth of Emilio Aguinaldo, the Bayani-verse’s primary villain"
Quezon,1588,27,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,There's just no inkling at all in the film of what life was like for the average Filipino under American occupation or the Quezon-led Commonwealth
Quezon,1588,28,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,It's 2025
Quezon,1588,29,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,We need to be looking past myopic personalizations of the past
Quezon,1588,30,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,We need to think about the actual situations of the Filipino people
Quezon,1588,31,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"We need to think about what independence actually means and what form of ""independence"" we actually got, both in 1935 and 1946"
Quezon,1588,32,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,We don't need more Great Man biopics
Quezon,1588,33,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,Does the film have anything to say about independence at all
Quezon,1588,34,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"We hear the word constantly bandied around like a slogan, as if saying it out loud is enough to signal what the country needs"
Quezon,1588,35,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,But the filmmakers don't bother to unpack it
Quezon,1588,36,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"Perhaps the real-life Quezon also didn't explain what was meant by this in the 1920s and 1930s, but that shouldn't excuse our filmmakers today"
Quezon,1588,37,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,Unless they genuinely believe that all independence entails is a democracy to vote for our leaders
Quezon,1588,38,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,Perhaps a good question to ask is the opposite
Quezon,1588,39,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,How did Quezon continue the structures of colonial dominance during his rule
Quezon,1588,40,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"What the film seems to try to say is that our first president embodied a lot of the best and worst qualities of many politicians today, but ultimately, it can perhaps be justified because it was for something greater — it was for our independence"
Quezon,1588,41,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,But it doesn't bother to explore what this proposed independence even means; it doesn't bother to distinguish political and economic independence; it doesn't even offer any useful corollaries to thinking about these issues today
Quezon,1588,42,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,So why was this film even made
Quezon,1588,43,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,*What makes it so much more fictionalized than the previous two films is the huge prominence of the narrative conceit of telling the film through the perspectives of Joven Hernando and his daughter
Quezon,1588,44,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,The closing down of Hernando’s Alerta publication and the idea of a young female director shooting short films to publicize Quezon’s campaign are totally fictional
Quezon,1588,45,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"There was some suppression of the press, for sure, during Quezon’s time, but Alerta doesn’t have any direct correlates"
Quezon,1588,46,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,Perhaps it’s more to symbolize the shut down of ABS-CBN during Rodrigo Duterte’s term
Quezon,1588,47,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,"And I could be wrong, but I don’t think Quezon had films made about himself to promote his campaign"
Quezon,1588,48,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,Ferdinand Marcos definitely did though
Quezon,1588,49,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,**Very briefly towards the end of the film we get a 30-second critique of Quezon's impact on patronage politics and the disbursement of spoils (pork barrel)
Quezon,1588,50,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,That's good
Quezon,1588,51,jasonrcf,,120.0,ltbx,But I don't think it makes up for the other 130 minutes or so of the film that takes more seriously as an issue scandals such as whether he had a first wife or not
Quezon,1589,1,dvbdny_,,,ltbx,And that closes the Bayaniverse

Quezon,1589,7,dvbdny_,,,ltbx,"Medjo hindi ko nagustohan na may spoon-feeding na nagaganap sa pagkekwento… At some point, gets ko naman kasi kahit nagbago ang body ni Joven (nagka-edad siya, as the epitome of a young nation), his soul still is young at kinakailangang tunggaliin ang paniniwala at iniisip niya with characters he can interact with sa pagdaloy ng kwento pero yun nga lang"

Quezon,1595,5,anmploydfilmdud,,180.0,ltbx,The film accurately represented the Filipino's inclination to the glamour and lavish lifestyle to escape the difficulty with Quezon as its charming figure greedy with dazzle and spotlight
Quezon,1595,6,anmploydfilmdud,,180.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales was casted perfectly to sway the audience with just a smile and his sweet voice saying, mi querido"
Quezon,1595,7,anmploydfilmdud,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon as the muse and political puppet master of the film was executed seamlessly, choreographed with the amazing editing transitions and the score of the film"

Quezon,1599,3,ydmk,,180.0,ltbx,"As the film’s writer, director, editor, composer, and producer, Tarog demonstrates complete creative freedom"
Quezon,1599,4,ydmk,,180.0,ltbx,His distinct artistic voice resonates throughout the film
Quezon,1599,5,ydmk,,180.0,ltbx,Tarog doesn’t shy away from drawing parallels between the political struggles of the past and the issues plaguing the Philippines today
Quezon,1599,6,ydmk,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s disheartening, as a Filipino, to realize how history continues to repeat itself, where those in power remain driven by greed and ambition"

Quezon,1599,14,ydmk,,180.0,ltbx,"I was especially excited to see Iain Glen, though I admit I was a bit disappointed by how limited his screen time was"
Quezon,1599,15,ydmk,,180.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales, on the other hand, delivers a refreshing performance, showing a side of him we haven’t seen before"
Quezon,1599,16,ydmk,,180.0,ltbx,"Still, I felt the film could have explored more, particularly Quezon’s pivotal role as the “Father of the National Language"
Quezon,1599,17,ydmk,,180.0,ltbx,” That historical thread seemed missing and could have added more depth to his character and legacy
Quezon,1599,18,ydmk,,180.0,ltbx,"Overall, I genuinely liked Quezon"
Quezon,1599,19,ydmk,,180.0,ltbx,"While Heneral Luna remains my favorite, this film stands strong in its own right"

Quezon,1600,2,tristanebale70,,160.0,ltbx,Its place in the Bayaniverse and the entire trilogy itself acts as a strong reminder of the country's implications of its actions and choices
Quezon,1600,3,tristanebale70,,160.0,ltbx,"Perspective is the game in the politics of this time - Quezon exploits it to his advantage; a businessman in essence, a fiery public speaker, a charismatic strategist, thus leading him to power"

Quezon,1600,15,tristanebale70,,160.0,ltbx,"This film leaves viewers in deep critical thinking, as what this trilogy has gone out to do, and they've done it triumphantly"
Quezon,1600,16,tristanebale70,,160.0,ltbx,"Between the humor, lightheartedness and cinematics, the questions confidently linger through, lasting long after the credits roll"
Quezon,1601,1,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,"If you haven't watched the first two movies of the Bayani series, I suggest you should"
Quezon,1601,2,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,"Although it did not affect the understanding for this movie, you'll have a better grasp of the other important character's background"
Quezon,1601,3,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales is an actor you should look out for
Quezon,1601,4,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,He put a lot of effort duplicating Manuel L
Quezon,1601,5,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon, especially the way he speaks"
Quezon,1601,6,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,I think being able to change the way you speak for a 2-hour movie is dedication— Jericho has a lot of that
Quezon,1601,7,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,My last memory of watching Jericho Rosales was in a romance movie and I almost forgot how good he is
Quezon,1601,8,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,"(Ito na magtatagalog na ako bdjsjsj) Nagulat ako kasi for someone na matagal nang hindi nakikita sa TV, sobrang pasabog ng pinakita niya na acting"
Quezon,1601,9,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,This one really deserves to be in line with the other two Bayani movies
Quezon,1601,10,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,Sobrang galing din ng ibang actors as they also gave justice to the development of Manuel's character
Quezon,1601,11,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,Romnick wow
Quezon,1601,12,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,"I already know he was an A-list actor, but seeing him with the others just made him stand out more (also maybe because he is an important character, but nonetheless)"
Quezon,1601,13,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,"Mon, Karylle, Therese, Aaron, Cris, Joross, Ketchup, and JC were also freaking great"
Quezon,1601,14,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,Ang lupit talaga ng line up ng artists kasi saan ka makakakita ng movies na kasama silang lahat
Quezon,1601,15,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,Sa Quezon lang
Quezon,1601,16,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,"If you want to properly understand why we have this kind of government today, go watch Quezon and reflect as to why that kind of mindset persisted until today"
Quezon,1601,17,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,"It did not meant to make the people see Manuel as a hero, rather, it wants to make us realize why a revolution happened in the first place"
Quezon,1601,18,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,It did not come from merely opposing a person— it is the generational urge to be in a better place that we can call ours
Quezon,1601,19,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,"If politics is indeed a game, what choice do we have, as pawns, if we don't fight back and make a stand"
Quezon,1601,20,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,"Manuel Quezon was a not a good leaded nor a good politician, but let me quote what he said as a Filipino: ""I am the Filipino people"
Quezon,1601,21,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,I am the Philippines
Quezon,1602,1,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,pero ang ganda ng chemistry nila serging at manolo
Quezon,1602,2,sageanna,,160.0,ltbx,"WAHAHAHAHAHA ALSO,,, CAN WE ALL AGREE NA SI JOVEN AND TUNAY NA BAYANI RITO HAHAHAHA"
Quezon,1603,1,kwatrowaltz,,160.0,ltbx,need me a 450k casey x serging friends to enemies to lovers fic
Quezon,1603,2,kwatrowaltz,,160.0,ltbx,"jokes aside, THE CINEMATOGRAPHY and directing was beautiful"
Quezon,1603,3,kwatrowaltz,,160.0,ltbx,"i greatly enjoyed the overhead shot in the senate—almost like a chessboard and the use of chess in the film, even down to the suit colors used by casey and serging when confronting leonard"
Quezon,1603,4,kwatrowaltz,,160.0,ltbx,ang ganda would love to rewatch it again ↕minus 1 star kasi wtf was that congtv cameo
Quezon,1604,1,halloblax,,180.0,ltbx,bayaniverse takeaway: tangina MEN

Quezon,1607,1,vagicecream,,140.0,ltbx,kabaklaan sa pamahalaan
Quezon,1608,1,allnmrtnn_ovlrr,,200.0,ltbx,the movie was really good — it had so many surprising plot twists from the past
Quezon,1608,2,allnmrtnn_ovlrr,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s fascinating to think that small actions could have changed history, like how if emilio had properly introduced quezon’s “mistress,” he might have won the election back then"
Quezon,1609,1,earnestattempts,,160.0,ltbx,this is joven’s film as much as it is quezon’s
Quezon,1609,2,earnestattempts,,160.0,ltbx,i appreciate how the film is a conversation between someone’s frenetic and charismatic rise to power and someone’s silent descent to hero-worship and loss of objectivity in the face of stability and comfort brought by the former
Quezon,1609,3,earnestattempts,,160.0,ltbx,"joven, i hope i don’t become a mirror of you"
Quezon,1609,4,earnestattempts,,160.0,ltbx,i really hope i don’t
Quezon,1609,5,earnestattempts,,160.0,ltbx,"for in the end, one question remains: sarili o bayan"
Quezon,1610,1,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,The movie Quezon shows how patronage politics started in the Philippines
Quezon,1610,2,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s a plea for people to always be critical because not everything is as it seems, especially when power and politics are involved"
Quezon,1610,3,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,"Dakila ang paglilingkod, but we can’t deny that even the brightest minds, no matter how noble their intent, have their own interests to protect, whether it’s power, greed, or pride"
Quezon,1610,4,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,"The film also leans into the idea of politics as performance, where charisma and public image often overshadow truth"
Quezon,1610,5,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,"It blurs the line between sincerity and spectacle, showing how easily stories can be staged, not just on screen, but in history itself"
Quezon,1610,6,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,"Beyond its message, this film feels like a love letter to the older forms of cinema now rendered obsolete by technology"
Quezon,1610,7,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,"In a world full of unfinished or half-hearted stories, it's admirable that Quezon made it to the screen despite all the odds"
Quezon,1610,8,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,"The more I think about the state of film today, the more I realize how fragile the whole industry is"
Quezon,1610,9,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,"The infrastructure is massive, and if one part of it falls, whether it’s funding, distribution, or technological support, the whole system would crumble"
Quezon,1610,10,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,Watching Quezon in theaters felt like joining a fight to keep cinema alive
Quezon,1610,11,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,"But it also made me realize that in a world where storytelling is changing rapidly, staying critical of what we consume is more important than ever"
Quezon,1610,12,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,"As technology brings new voices and narratives, we must stay aware of how stories are shaped"
Quezon,1610,13,raveloblack,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon shows how the politics behind a film can influence its message, reminding us to be conscious of the contradictions in storytelling, especially with complex topics like politics"
Quezon,1612,1,rk1ve,,160.0,ltbx,"nilaro lang tayo ni quezon, literal"
Quezon,1612,2,rk1ve,,160.0,ltbx,problematic king kaya ka nagkasakit eh LOL
Quezon,1612,3,rk1ve,,160.0,ltbx,"thanks to this film, it presented so many revelations abt the past na hindi ko alam before"
Quezon,1612,4,rk1ve,,160.0,ltbx,pero one thing na hindi bago is that hindi parin talaga matakasan ng mga Pilipino ang pagiging pawns sa laro ng mga hayup in exchange of power
Quezon,1612,5,rk1ve,,160.0,ltbx,"also, “aguinaldo outlived all three,” GRABE"
Quezon,1612,6,rk1ve,,160.0,ltbx,HAHAHAHAH LAF AKO
Quezon,1612,7,rk1ve,,160.0,ltbx,"anyway, thanks to this film (2), my queen nadia got to showcase her films at sobrang galing <3 commendable din ang camerawork and color grading ng film + its way of storytelling through a film in a film"
Quezon,1612,8,rk1ve,,160.0,ltbx,def up for a rewatch
Quezon,1613,1,n1ng,,200.0,ltbx,my god this was so fucking good
Quezon,1613,2,n1ng,,200.0,ltbx,i cant wait to watch this again
Quezon,1614,1,yeshhuhh,,180.0,ltbx,"kung ako si aguinaldo, rereveal ko si ana ricardo…"
Quezon,1615,1,atomicdeadspace,,160.0,ltbx,A compelling depiction of the timeless farce that is the Philippine political landscape
Quezon,1615,2,atomicdeadspace,,160.0,ltbx,Definitely the best among the Bayani trilogy
Quezon,1615,3,atomicdeadspace,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales is excellent in playing the chameleon
Quezon,1616,1,aallddss,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon is so annoying as a character, pero ang pogi pa rin kasi ni Jericho Rosales"
Quezon,1616,3,aallddss,,140.0,ltbx,"Visual Imagery on how politics is all but a game (represented by chess), beautiful"
Quezon,1616,4,aallddss,,140.0,ltbx,Maybe my brain is fried from the brain rot but I personally found it hard to look at this film critically
Quezon,1616,5,aallddss,,140.0,ltbx,I don't understand what it was trying to say :/ Maybe I missed a point
Quezon,1617,1,radioromance,,160.0,ltbx,i think wala tayong winner tonight
Quezon,1618,1,luisricardo_,,160.0,ltbx,on aguinaldo v quezon: wala tayong winner tonight
Quezon,1619,1,jims,,180.0,ltbx,An important film for Filipinos to see
Quezon,1619,2,jims,,180.0,ltbx,A lot of beautiful cinematic devices to easily consume the material that is history
Quezon,1619,3,jims,,180.0,ltbx,Jericho is sooo grounded and could win multiple awards with his performance
Quezon,1620,1,ariaskie,,200.0,ltbx,sana murahin din ako ni Echo
Quezon,1621,1,icypoppy,,140.0,ltbx,"""aguinaldo outlived all three"" that's my queen elizabeth also tw: congtv"
Quezon,1622,1,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,It's all fun a games for our politicians while the Filipino people continue to be the pawnsWhen I saw the trailer for the first time I was a bit confused
Quezon,1622,2,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,Why were they using a Filipino children's game song in the trailer
Quezon,1622,3,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,It all made sense after watching the film
Quezon,1622,4,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon did not have the action and angst of its co-Bayaniverse film Heneral Luna nor it did not have the suspense and romanticization of Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral but what it did have is a very intentional unraveling of a revered historical figure
Quezon,1622,5,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,This third Bayaniverse film is probably the best and my most favorite
Quezon,1622,6,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,From the very beginning of the film it captures you with its unique treatment of blending in a non-linear narrative with the meta-ness of using silent films as a medium to tell the story while it being contained in its own film
Quezon,1622,7,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"I admit at first there was some confusion in terms of the timeline and the determination of what is reality in the case of the film but as I patiently watched, it all meshed together really well"
Quezon,1622,8,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,The end product was so good
Quezon,1622,9,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"I was waiting on moments where I could point out ""show-don't-tell"" moments but the expositions and explanations of what happened were really visualized and conveyed in such creative manners"
Quezon,1622,10,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,Was it info overload
Quezon,1622,11,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"Well, if you didn't have any background/knowledge on Philippine History, it will be"
Quezon,1622,12,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"But still, it's not a reason for someone to not watch it cause it will make you understand"
Quezon,1622,13,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales, Karylle, Romnick Sarmenta, and Mon Confiado really stood out"
Quezon,1622,14,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,Manuel Quezon was personified through Jericho Rosales' effortless and magnetic performance
Quezon,1622,15,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,He embodied the late president so flawlessly
Quezon,1622,16,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,Karylle's Aurora Quezon was so specific and precise with her portrayal
Quezon,1622,17,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,Her eyes spoke a thousand words and she made us gravitate towards her in every scene she was in
Quezon,1622,18,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña was a crowd-favorite
Quezon,1622,19,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,The eventual first Visayan President was performed with charm and likeability
Quezon,1622,20,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,Even sometimes stealing the scene away from Quezon
Quezon,1622,21,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,But my favorite performance in the film was Mon Confiado's Emilio Aguinaldo
Quezon,1622,22,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,I don't know if I'm being biased because my great grandfather was one of his secretaries but the way Emilio Aguinaldo was written and performed in this film is so complete and really bookends his character arc since he was first seen on Heneral Luna
Quezon,1622,23,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,What I love most about this film is that it vilifies no one but at the same time it does not champion anyone as well
Quezon,1622,24,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"Yes, Quezon was a really influential and well-loved president"
Quezon,1622,25,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"Dare I say, the first true performative-male"
Quezon,1622,26,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"And in a country where celebrity and politics win the votes of the people, he really, admittedly, played a good game"
Quezon,1622,27,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,If he was in Game of Thrones he could've sat on the Iron Throne
Quezon,1622,28,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"It did not smear Quezon's name in any way, yet, it revealed to us who he really was and how he played the game"
Quezon,1622,29,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"I keep going back to ""game"" cause this was basically the main theme of the film"
Quezon,1622,30,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"A poker-playing politician who always aim to one-up his foes, and even friends"
Quezon,1622,31,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,He played the game right but at what cost
Quezon,1622,32,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"People being stuck between colonialism and independence, propaganda against the heroes who fought for our freedom, and a never-ending cycle of patronage politics that was mentioned in the film"
Quezon,1622,33,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,I'm so glad I watched this film and I learned about this
Quezon,1622,34,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,And what's funny is that the silliness that happened during their time is still the same silliness happening in our politics up to this date
Quezon,1622,35,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"Senators and congressmen further delaying our countries progress, pork barrels and nepobabies, the ""utang na loob"" culture in politics, all of these are still happening today"
Quezon,1622,36,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,Now it gets me questioning whether the fight they fought was really a success or are we just in a new hell created by being collateral damage from their wars
Quezon,1622,37,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,"I guess to end this on a positive note, at least now we have people waking up, we have strong journalist and filmmakers ready to be the voice of truth, and the Filipinos are now desperate for a change"
Quezon,1622,38,franzhalili,,180.0,ltbx,may this film be one of the flames that will truly ignite our fight for a better life and TRUE INDEPENDENCE here in our country
Quezon,1623,1,usuallyfilm,,180.0,ltbx,"initial thoughts: great movie, pogi ni jericho, didnt expect they will potray quezon like that and daming pamilyar na mukha sa gilid"
Quezon,1623,2,usuallyfilm,,180.0,ltbx,"hahaha sir rody vera, xiao chua, etc"
Quezon,1623,3,usuallyfilm,,180.0,ltbx,will edit after our friend group's discussion lmao
Quezon,1624,1,andymancy,,160.0,ltbx,Good movie that is carried by its excellent performances and undeniable timeliness
Quezon,1624,2,andymancy,,160.0,ltbx,It does a good job of paying reverence to the Quezon’s legitimate political savviness while also depicting the back and forth of the political game as something childish and worthy of contempt
Quezon,1624,3,andymancy,,160.0,ltbx,The movie is at its best when Jericho Rosales fires on all cylinders by being as abrasive and forceful as possible
Quezon,1624,4,andymancy,,160.0,ltbx,"Its these scenes, where Quezon seems deathly close to crashing out without actually doing it, where you can’t help but be mystified by his character, while simultaneously growing increasingly tired of him"
Quezon,1624,5,andymancy,,160.0,ltbx,"The biggest problem with the movie is the problem with all the Bayaniverse movies, and a lot of movies in general nowadays, which is that it cannot help but over-explain"
Quezon,1624,6,andymancy,,160.0,ltbx,"I get it, Manuel Quezon doesn’t exactly have the most well-known biography, but I feel like there’s a bit of projection that the audience won’t be able to understand the story without all the narrative cues, or the themes without the use of Joven as a narrator"
Quezon,1624,7,andymancy,,160.0,ltbx,"Perhaps im more optimistic about Filipino literacy than i should be, but at some point, Jerrold Tarrog just needs to trust the audience"
Quezon,1624,8,andymancy,,160.0,ltbx,"Joven is an incredibly lazy storytelling device that he has used as a crutch for three movies now, and made this movie twenty minutes longer than it should’ve been"
Quezon,1624,9,andymancy,,160.0,ltbx,"I don’t need him to tell me what the movie is trying to say, and we can’t train audiences to be more literate if he keeps telling them"
Quezon,1624,10,andymancy,,160.0,ltbx,"If Joven still somehow shows up in the next movie despite ostensibly being over a century old by then, please either end the cinematic universe as a whole or reveal that he was Juan Ponce Enrile the whole time"

Quezon,1628,1,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,Jerrold Tarog's Quezon isn't just a historical biopic; it's a masterclass in political drama and the long-awaited final word in the Bayaniverse trilogy
Quezon,1628,2,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,"This film brilliantly connects the trilogy, giving us the clearest and most satisfying explanation yet for the complex state of Philippine politics and leadership"
Quezon,1628,3,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,At the heart of this engrossing narrative is Jericho Rosales' magnetic performance as Manuel L
Quezon,1628,5,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,"Rosales embodies the former president as a charismatic, cunning, and fiercely intelligent political operator"
Quezon,1628,6,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,"He portrays the energy, oratorical flair, and sheer force of will that defined Quezon, making it clear why this complicated, flawed man was able to navigate the brutal political game and change the course of history"
Quezon,1628,7,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,It's a powerhouse portrayal that anchors the entire film
Quezon,1628,8,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,"The fear in a dialogue-heavy historical film is a dragging pace, but Quezon defies it"
Quezon,1628,9,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,"The film moves with precision and purpose, making its runtime feel taut and engaging"
Quezon,1628,10,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,You'll find your eyes peeled and attention held by the intense political maneuvering
Quezon,1628,11,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,"This is history not as a dusty textbook, but as a live, urgent confrontation with power, compromise, and charisma"
Quezon,1628,12,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,"It confirms that the greatest battles for the nation were not just fought on the battlefield, but in the corridors of power"

Quezon,1630,1,comsateur,,,ltbx,"Hindi ako kulangot, wag mo akong binibilog"
Quezon,1630,2,comsateur,,,ltbx,"This film is or at least tries to be everything: a biopic, period drama, political satire, hays code era slapstick, old man yaoi, telenovela etc"
Quezon,1630,3,comsateur,,,ltbx,"Despite the seemingly conflicting tones, Jerrold Tarog and the creative team was able to juggle with grace and precision the different facets of Manuel Quezon and a nation's coming of age"
Quezon,1630,4,comsateur,,,ltbx,Jericho Rosales is a revelation in his portrayal of the titular role
Quezon,1630,5,comsateur,,,ltbx,"He spoke Tagalog in a slightly high-pitched almost-comical voice, and would switch to English in the accent of a timog-katagalugan everyman combined with the transatlantic cadence of a prohibition era radio personality"
Quezon,1630,6,comsateur,,,ltbx,"Equal parts charming and ruthless, hysterical and terrifying, he treated the character of Quezon as a ringmaster, and the Philippine Legislature his three-ring circus"
Quezon,1630,7,comsateur,,,ltbx,"As with the two other entries in Bayaniverse, Quezon holds a cinema screen-sized mirror to its audience as it peels away the layers of the man who planted the seeds of trapo culture in the Philippines"
Quezon,1630,8,comsateur,,,ltbx,"This is as much a character study of Quezon as it is of Joven, the makabayan surrogate character present in all three films, as he realizes in a full circle moment that even he and his uncompromising ideals of the Philippines' independence are susceptible to propaganda"
Quezon,1630,9,comsateur,,,ltbx,Jerrold Tarog made a bold creative choice to cast deeper doubts on the conspiracies surrounding the murders of Andres Bonifacio and General Luna
Quezon,1630,10,comsateur,,,ltbx,"He asks us viewers to look beyond the historical narratives we accept as facts, and to make wiser decisions on who we should put on the pedestal next as a hero of the nation"
Quezon,1631,1,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,"""Hindi ako kulangot, 'wag mo akong binibilog"
Quezon,1631,2,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,"""Bilang isang tambay ng sinehan, naalala ko na nakalagay sa trailer ng Quezon na it is ""the last chapter in our quest to define bayani"""
Quezon,1631,3,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,"So pagkatapos panoorin nito, mapapaisip ka nalang talaga: ano nga ba ang bumubuo sa isang bayani"
Quezon,1631,4,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,Paano nga ba nagiging bayani ang isang tao
Quezon,1631,5,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,"Pinakagusto kong desisyon na ginawa nila ay yung pagpapakita ng bagong paraan sa pagdefine ng ""bayani"""
Quezon,1631,6,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,"Kung sa Heneral Luna at Goyo ay nakita natin ang mga digmaan at ang laban para sa kalayaan ng Pilipinas, dito naman sa Quezon, ang sandata na ginamit para sa pagpapatuloy ng laban para sa kalayaan ay pananalita"
Quezon,1631,7,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,Totoo na medyo mali nga lang yung paggamit nun ng iba sa movie na to huhuhfsdsa pero alam mo yun marina gets mo na yun matanda ka na
Quezon,1631,8,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,"Di rin nahiya yung movie na ipakita ang dalawang panig ni Manuel Quezon at kung ano ang mga ginawa niya para lang makamit ang paulit-ulit na tinutukoy na ""independensiya"" ng bansa, kasabay ng kapangyarihang lagi niyang ninanais at di niya kayang bitawan"
Quezon,1631,9,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,"May kakaunting labo kung saan pumapanig ang pelikula pagkatapos ng lahat, pero nagulat na rin ako na ganun kalayo ang inabot nila sa pagpapakita ng pati na rin ang mga kasamaan niya"
Quezon,1631,10,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,"Ang nakalulungkot nga lang ay sabi dalawang beses dito na ""out with the old, in with the new"" (di ko naintindihan yung talagang sinabi nila sa tagalog sorry), pero wala pa ring nagbabago eh"
Quezon,1631,11,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,ganito pa rin galawan ng mga pulitika
Quezon,1631,12,philipilihp,,160.0,ltbx,"Yung pagbabago na hinahanap natin, hinahanap din nila noon, kaya if anything, sana magamit ang pelikulang ito upang patuloy na gumising ang mga tao at mamulat ang mga mata nila sa katotohanan ng lahat ng gulong ito, at kung sino ang mga may tunay na pananagutan sa lahat ng ito"
Quezon,1632,1,r31ka,,160.0,ltbx,"If this trilogy wasn't already giving us mixed signals on how to feel about our country, it certainly is now"
Quezon,1633,1,littlewoodhouse,,180.0,ltbx,really really good film and a wonderful ending to this bayaniverse trilogy
Quezon,1633,2,littlewoodhouse,,180.0,ltbx,"it reminded me of Nick Joaquin's A Question of Heroes - like a deep dive into the people behind the heroes, asking the question: what does ""bayani"" really mean - are these heroes even real, or are they only heroes because of how the narratives of history have shaped them out to be"
Quezon,1633,3,littlewoodhouse,,180.0,ltbx,"the performances, cinematography, the blocking, costuming, set design, color grading, soundtrack, and sound design are all absolutely a treat to watch"
Quezon,1633,4,littlewoodhouse,,180.0,ltbx,"despite not being as action-packed as Heneral Luna and Goyo, it never feels dull because of how the screen is filled with life"
Quezon,1633,5,littlewoodhouse,,180.0,ltbx,"watching this just after Hamilton was very interesting too, what with colonialism and independence being common themes"
Quezon,1633,6,littlewoodhouse,,180.0,ltbx,"at the end of the day, they are both stories about flawed people who shaped the history of their respective nations, yet were also shaped by their skewed beliefs and the people and circumstances around them"
Quezon,1633,7,littlewoodhouse,,180.0,ltbx,overall a very very good and thought-provoking movie and I can't wait to rewatch it
Quezon,1634,1,henlomemo,,140.0,ltbx,ang ganda
Quezon,1634,2,henlomemo,,140.0,ltbx,acting ni pio nagdala HAHAHAjkrlly like the way they told the story yesyes
Quezon,1635,1,craigyx,,160.0,ltbx,An ambitious film that tries a nuanced form of storytelling for an audience consisting of mostly high school graduates
Quezon,1635,2,craigyx,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite this, the movie is very engaging"
Quezon,1635,3,craigyx,,160.0,ltbx,"It is firm in its stance on the character of the people in its story, but is intentionally ambiguous in its presentation of information on which there is no conclusive truth"
Quezon,1635,4,craigyx,,160.0,ltbx,"Just like its predecessors, it is able to open conversation about topics which are relevant to ongoing affairs in the country; though perhaps this is simply reflective of the fact that the Filipino people have not learned from their history"
Quezon,1635,5,craigyx,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales shows the growth in his range as an actor with this film
Quezon,1635,6,craigyx,,160.0,ltbx,"This is easily one of his best, if not his best, performances ever"
Quezon,1635,7,craigyx,,160.0,ltbx,"The other major characters in the film are able to hold their own ground here as well, though the minor characters show the clear difference in their level of skill"
Quezon,1635,8,craigyx,,160.0,ltbx,Great film
Quezon,1636,1,gabebalita,,180.0,ltbx,"so basically, quezon was cady heron doing everything in his power to get rid of regina george Holy shit, Tarrog did it again"
Quezon,1636,2,gabebalita,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon was close to perfection and such a delight to watch
Quezon,1636,3,gabebalita,,180.0,ltbx,The story and script was well-written
Quezon,1636,4,gabebalita,,180.0,ltbx,Jericho was so HOT and great as Quezon
Quezon,1636,5,gabebalita,,180.0,ltbx,"Everyone's performance was superb, walang tapon"
Quezon,1636,6,gabebalita,,180.0,ltbx,"As a media nerd, I'm such a huge fan of the use of early media as a tool for propaganda"
Quezon,1636,7,gabebalita,,180.0,ltbx,"I'd give this film 5 stars kaso naweirduhan ako sa framing nila ng US and Americans as ""saviors"" and ""nice guys"""
Quezon,1636,8,gabebalita,,180.0,ltbx,That was weird lol
Quezon,1637,1,inceee,,180.0,ltbx,"“Masyadong maraming pulitiko sa bansa, kakaunti lang ang lingkod-bayan” - Aguinaldo Coming from someone with a pretty controversial past, feels ironic"
Quezon,1637,2,inceee,,180.0,ltbx,"Imagine, a man stained by accusations of betrayals talking about public service"
Quezon,1637,3,inceee,,180.0,ltbx,History keeps repeating itself
Quezon,1637,4,inceee,,180.0,ltbx,Watching this feels like a reminder: even the people who talk about good service can be part of the same cycle
Quezon,1637,5,inceee,,180.0,ltbx,"Ang sakit lang isipin na ilang dekada na nakalilipas, wala pa pagbabago"
Quezon,1638,1,mundongkahel,,200.0,ltbx,That was 2 hours and 19 mins but it didn’t feel like it
Quezon,1638,2,mundongkahel,,200.0,ltbx,Para nga syang Oppenheimer but for the Filipinos because of all the politics but damn mr
Quezon,1638,3,mundongkahel,,200.0,ltbx,Tarog’s ability to not make you yawn while watching the movie is amazing
Quezon,1638,4,mundongkahel,,200.0,ltbx,THE APPOINTMENT SCENE IS SO CHEFS KISS BRAHHH I LOVE CREATIVE FILM DIRECTORS SO GOOD WHAT THE HELL
Quezon,1639,1,abbyg21,,160.0,ltbx,Kept my attention the entire time
Quezon,1639,2,abbyg21,,160.0,ltbx,Good pacing and great acting by Jericho Rosales
Quezon,1640,1,earthqueef,,200.0,ltbx,"""I AM THE PHILIPPINES"
Quezon,1640,2,earthqueef,,200.0,ltbx,""" Quezon says to himself as they drag his ass into a padded room"
Quezon,1641,1,melaniemarkez,,180.0,ltbx,thank god no politician was ever glorified in this film
Quezon,1642,1,jnnrgnzg,,180.0,ltbx,wala naman talagang nagbago; mahusay na ipinakita ng pelikula na kahit higit sandaang taon na ang nakalilipas ay iba’t-ibang bersyon lang ng pare-parehong korapsyon ang isinisilang
Quezon,1642,2,jnnrgnzg,,180.0,ltbx,3/3 no misses
Quezon,1642,3,jnnrgnzg,,180.0,ltbx,napakagaling Direk Jerrold Tarog
Quezon,1643,1,kelpards6,,180.0,ltbx,amats ng adhd ko ‘yung editing and script
Quezon,1643,2,kelpards6,,180.0,ltbx,"evident sa film how jerrold relayed his vision through directing, writing, editing, and even music"
Quezon,1643,3,kelpards6,,180.0,ltbx,that scene where quezon catches joven screening the films in bad faith is so good
Quezon,1643,4,kelpards6,,180.0,ltbx,it feels like he’s breaking the fourth wall without actually breaking it since joven’s character represents our perspective as the audience of history
Quezon,1643,5,kelpards6,,180.0,ltbx,i also love that the film doesn’t glorify quezon entirely and instead explores his psychology in depth
Quezon,1643,6,kelpards6,,180.0,ltbx,"btw, ang lakas naman ng immune system ng mga tao sa paligid niya, wala man lang nahawa ng tb sa pelikula"
Quezon,1644,1,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, I haven't watched any of the Bayaniverse until this one"
Quezon,1644,2,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,"Well, it's an impulsive one for me to watch it but it's good to have it as somehow my last film before flying to the US and also, my first time at the director's club in our local cinema"
Quezon,1644,3,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,"I do not remember any moment where I felt so much giddy, excitement and anticipation watching a historical film but with this one, this excited me so much, amplified by the plethora (PLETHORA"
Quezon,1644,4,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,") of great actors (Rosales, Sarmenta, Santos, Lorenzo, Confiado, Villanueva, Tatlonghari-Yuzon, Abad Santos, Bayani, etc"
Quezon,1644,5,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,) that just simply serve masterclass in acting and projecting
Quezon,1644,6,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales' portrayal of Quezon, from his demeanor up to his accent, it reminded me of how Vic Robinson portrayed Emilio Jacinto, that also shares an accent, it will really give you that good cherry on top for their characterizations"
Quezon,1644,7,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,I really loved how the film was very rhythmic
Quezon,1644,8,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,"That's the only word that comes to mind as the progression of the storylines per act is mainly governed by its accompanying track that somehow engages you to a certain feeling they want to invoke from you and that gives me so much fun because it really keeps me up and keeps me so engage, waiting for what's to come"
Quezon,1644,9,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,But the accompanying track also somehow fasttracks certain transitions that make the flow of the story a little disorienting at times
Quezon,1644,10,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,There are moments where I am confused on what timeline it is or what reality it is
Quezon,1644,11,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,If I am in before of after Quezon's presidency or if I am in the silent movie created by Nadia or the reality alone
Quezon,1644,12,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,"But beyond that, this is a good one and I can't wait to see both Heneral Luna and Goyo in the next few following days to see where this has started"
Quezon,1644,15,satuwina,,160.0,ltbx,How sad it is for the audience to realize that the reality of the Philippines in its early times is still the reality of the Philippines in the current times
Quezon,1645,1,shadowkat_,,160.0,ltbx,really enjoyed the dark comedy route it took in portraying his story
Quezon,1645,2,shadowkat_,,160.0,ltbx,"kaloka, pasimuno naman pala ng patronage politics also, that score was banginnn’very excited for their 4th historical figure"
Quezon,1645,3,shadowkat_,,160.0,ltbx,"sana ma-greenlight, i really want to see paano magiging approach nila sa story niya"
Quezon,1646,1,renadonna,,200.0,ltbx,Absolute Pinoy Cinema
Quezon,1646,2,renadonna,,200.0,ltbx,"The style, cinematography, the lines, it's beautiful and charismatic"
Quezon,1646,3,renadonna,,200.0,ltbx,"I felt like I travelled through time during the whole movie especially on the old film sequences, it made me feel like I was watching from an old cinema"
Quezon,1646,4,renadonna,,200.0,ltbx,"I can almost smell the setting, specifically the wood elements from the interior scenes and I can also feel the warmth of the exterior scenes during the day"
Quezon,1646,5,renadonna,,200.0,ltbx,This may be the first time I felt magic in the cinema
Quezon,1646,6,renadonna,,200.0,ltbx,"In addition, the way the story was build from start to finish, I don't know how to describe it but it's like Oppenheimer with a hint of Wes Anderson's quirkiness from The French Dispatch"
Quezon,1646,7,renadonna,,200.0,ltbx,This film is 2 hours long but I do not recall a dull moment
Quezon,1646,8,renadonna,,200.0,ltbx,"If I'm to pin point this film's flaw, it's obviously Cong's cameo lol"
Quezon,1646,9,renadonna,,200.0,ltbx,"I just love this film very much, can't wait to see what's next"
Quezon,1647,1,definitelylanz,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon really went out there and set the framework for the corruption in today's government As a film, it's good"
Quezon,1647,2,definitelylanz,,140.0,ltbx,"It was shot well, has good acting, the music was great"
Quezon,1647,3,definitelylanz,,140.0,ltbx,"But as a story, what our ancestors did was straight up atrocious"
Quezon,1648,1,ilomilo_,,160.0,ltbx,di ako nagulat na sobrang innate / grounded na ng corruption sa pinas
Quezon,1648,2,ilomilo_,,160.0,ltbx,it js reminded me/us na need natin ng revolution
Quezon,1648,3,ilomilo_,,160.0,ltbx,ng reset
Quezon,1648,4,ilomilo_,,160.0,ltbx,tangina ng mga pulitiko

Quezon,1650,1,jconmd,,160.0,ltbx,Perfect ending to the trilogy
Quezon,1650,2,jconmd,,160.0,ltbx,Hope there’s another trilogy perhaps
Quezon,1650,3,jconmd,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales’ diction
Quezon,1651,1,rnr_yns,,200.0,ltbx,Walang nagbago
Quezon,1651,2,rnr_yns,,200.0,ltbx,The Philippines of Quezon is the Philippines we have now
Quezon,1651,3,rnr_yns,,200.0,ltbx,Quezon's words were true
Quezon,1651,4,rnr_yns,,200.0,ltbx,He was sick
Quezon,1651,5,rnr_yns,,200.0,ltbx,He was on a wheelchair holding on to power and life
Quezon,1651,6,rnr_yns,,200.0,ltbx,He is the Filipino people
Quezon,1651,7,rnr_yns,,200.0,ltbx,He is the Philippines
Quezon,1652,1,tiffiecambe,,140.0,ltbx,Lesson learned: ang pogi ni Jericho Rosales at ang fangit ni Cong TV
Quezon,1653,1,inthisfall,,160.0,ltbx,I like this take on Quezon better than that of Quezon's game
Quezon,1653,2,inthisfall,,160.0,ltbx,This film showcased Quezon as a caudillo lite politician (which he is) but its only limited to that
Quezon,1653,3,inthisfall,,160.0,ltbx,"It only showed his performance not the consequences of his actions, The film glazed all of the events in history that without the necessary context you will probably be lost on them"
Quezon,1653,4,inthisfall,,160.0,ltbx,Some moments it feels like a sparknotes entry on Quezon's career rather than a far more deeper look into these events and how it affects him
Quezon,1653,5,inthisfall,,160.0,ltbx,"In hidisght tho, Jericho Rosales managed to do Quezon so well that his visuals never really distract me"
Quezon,1653,6,inthisfall,,160.0,ltbx,"If there is going to be a Ramon Magsasay film, hopefully it will be the same approach as this one because I do not want a film that is only showcased the ""heroism"" of Magsasay but rather the consequences of a Magsaysay"" (basically politicians tried to emulate his charisma and personality)"
Quezon,1653,7,inthisfall,,160.0,ltbx,Also a more deeper look in the chaoticness of the Third Republic
Quezon,1654,1,rnbalasolla,,160.0,ltbx,mi querido
Quezon,1655,1,gideonwobi,,120.0,ltbx,I guess Filipinos never learn as a nation
Quezon,1656,1,goldwinreviews,,100.0,ltbx,"Maybe at this point, we’re just tired of seeing undeserving leaders being put on the limelight"
Quezon,1656,2,goldwinreviews,,100.0,ltbx,"Or perhaps, this movie is not entertaining or engaging enough to widen its reach"
Quezon,1656,3,goldwinreviews,,100.0,ltbx,This type of history drama tends to attract a niche audience that’s already familiar with the lessons it ought to convey
Quezon,1656,4,goldwinreviews,,100.0,ltbx,Ilang panggulo pa ba ang mamumuno bago tayo matuto
Quezon,1656,5,goldwinreviews,,100.0,ltbx,Ilang pelikula pa ba ang dapat gawin bago tayo magising
Quezon,1657,5,localwallflowie,,140.0,ltbx,i think wala tayong winner tonight

Quezon,1660,1,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,Jones Law
Quezon,1660,5,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,First president
Quezon,1660,6,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,"The film playfully turns these terms we learned in school into a clear, engaging source of politically-charged cinematic plot"
Quezon,1660,7,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,"The sets are impressive and elevate the viewing (something we now often see in recent Pinoy history films), but focusing mostly on them would be a disservice to a competently written and made film"
Quezon,1660,8,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,"I was entertained, with twists that made familiar Sibika lessons feel new"
Quezon,1660,9,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,"Lowkey and right after watching Cinemartyrs from Cinemalaya, Quezon is another film that champions women in the early history of Philippine cinema"
Quezon,1660,10,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,"Similarly from Cinemartyrs, it also considers America's influence on the country, for better or worse"
Quezon,1660,11,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,"Independence still feels like a concept, and it has fostered a culture of gratitude that can imply a sense of inferiority, even up to now"
Quezon,1660,12,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,"Jerrold Tarog always has something to say about these things, showing how far people will go for power"
Quezon,1660,13,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,"Change the world or seek power or both, it's the same old story"
Quezon,1660,14,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,"Even before Philippine independence, that was the world"
Quezon,1660,15,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,"Nothing new there, but it is a welcome reminder"
Quezon,1660,16,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,Seems like Jerrold Tarog is not just done yet
Quezon,1660,17,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,And that should be exciting
Quezon,1660,18,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,"Although like our thoughts about Villeneuve making franchise films, it would be nice to see Tarog go back to modernly-set films"
Quezon,1660,19,jaynormouskid,,140.0,ltbx,Maybe it's just a phase and this isn't new for directors locally or internationally
Quezon,1661,1,savetris,,180.0,ltbx,may kaba
Quezon,1662,1,lumetloml,,160.0,ltbx,"rip manuel quezon, you would've loved manchild by sabrina carpenter"

Quezon,1663,2,zombiepalaka,,140.0,ltbx,"I know it from the opening that it's gonna be good and different from the first two, it's quite silly"
Quezon,1663,3,zombiepalaka,,140.0,ltbx,I love it whenever they show Jericho Rosales as Quezon is that he is either blissful or enraging with his electrifying curse words or just another bum old preacher
Quezon,1663,4,zombiepalaka,,140.0,ltbx,I'm just sad that some certain characters are uncertain to what was going to happen to them next
Quezon,1663,5,zombiepalaka,,140.0,ltbx,Some scenes I feel like I'm watching a raw clip of Blonde with Ana De Armas lol
Quezon,1663,6,zombiepalaka,,140.0,ltbx,"I love it, definitely a great birthday present from me, myself"
Quezon,1664,1,hooman_bell,,160.0,ltbx,TAYO SI JOVEN

Quezon,1665,3,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,"True, he did lots of things for this country"
Quezon,1665,4,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,"But, golly, he also began the usage of terms people don't even understand for his own gain in elections"
Quezon,1665,5,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,He hopebaited the whole country while institutionalizing padrino system even further
Quezon,1665,6,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,"We got our independence eventually, but at what cost"
Quezon,1665,7,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,Maybe his greatest tragedy was he never saw the establishment of the republic he once fought for
Quezon,1665,8,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,The actors were great
Quezon,1665,9,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,Jericho did well as Quezon
Quezon,1665,10,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,Would've loved more of Karylle
Quezon,1665,11,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,The sets were amazing
Quezon,1665,12,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,"Not an expert, but I love the pre-war American colonial designs"
Quezon,1665,13,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,The story could get confusing at times with the jumps but overall I could piece it together
Quezon,1665,14,somebellmount,,180.0,ltbx,I just hope we don't get the wrong message and pin our hopes for this country to one person after this again

Quezon,1670,1,iamdamnation,,140.0,ltbx,This started like a history lecture and ended like a political slap
Quezon,1670,2,iamdamnation,,140.0,ltbx,"Yes, the film took its time finding rhythm - the first act felt like homework - but once the narrative locked in, it came alive and the payoff was rich"
Quezon,1670,3,iamdamnation,,140.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales embodied Quezon with charm and danger, while Jerrold Tarog’s vision made history pulse with urgency"
Quezon,1670,4,iamdamnation,,140.0,ltbx,The way he balanced the film’s shifting tones was masterful
Quezon,1670,5,iamdamnation,,140.0,ltbx,"The film’s commentary on politics and power was cutting, the visuals lush, and its relevance terrifyingly familiar"
Quezon,1670,6,iamdamnation,,140.0,ltbx,"It’s not perfect, but it’s important"
Quezon,1671,1,rrryyyuuu,,200.0,ltbx,This was so good that I genuinely did not want this to end

Quezon,1672,2,mrsummerpurns,,160.0,ltbx,"The movie weaves through Quezon's life to build the image of man a molded by political learnings and who uses them to his advantage, paving the way for the politics we see today"

Quezon,1691,1,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon isn’t just another film
Quezon,1691,2,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s a bridge between the raw, emotional grit of indie cinema and the accessibility of mainstream storytelling"
Quezon,1691,3,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,"At its core, it’s a story about a protagonist who feels more like an anti-hero"
Quezon,1691,4,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon could easily fit the mold of a Marvel villain, his intentions are clear and rooted in conviction, but he’ll do whatever it takes to achieve them"
Quezon,1691,5,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s all about perception, really, and how morality can shift depending on where you stand"
Quezon,1691,6,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,Di siya masamang tao

Quezon,1691,8,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,Para sa kanya or para sa bayan niya
Quezon,1691,9,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,"On the technical side, the film shines"
Quezon,1691,10,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,"The use of parallelism, the sharp direction of Jerrold Tarog, and the deliberate framing from Pong’s cinematography all reflect a meticulous attention to detail"
Quezon,1691,11,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,"As an aspiring filmmaker and cinephile, you’ll find yourself appreciating every choice they made; nothing feels accidental"
Quezon,1691,12,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,The performances are equally impressive
Quezon,1691,13,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,"Every actor fully embodies their role, responding naturally to one another"
Quezon,1691,14,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,"There’s no unnecessary showboating, no scene-stealing, just grounded, organic acting that serves the story"

Quezon,1691,17,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,The film mirrors the pain and complexity of the times we live in
Quezon,1691,18,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,It feels like an origin story for where we are as a nation today
Quezon,1691,19,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,"As a frustrated creative from the Philippines, this is the kind of film that makes you proud"
Quezon,1691,20,manalojohn,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon is proof that we can create something deeply cinematic, intelligent, and emotionally resonant, something that can stand proudly on the international stage"
Quezon,1692,1,taeyomi,,200.0,ltbx,1) Being in the “Bayani”-verse is kinda funny when you watch
Quezon,1692,2,taeyomi,,200.0,ltbx,Is this what we really consider a national hero
Quezon,1692,3,taeyomi,,200.0,ltbx,"2) This is a historical film, so I’m expecting to revisit and just know about the things that have happened during the days I wasn’t even born, but why does the film feel so familiar as if I’ve seen this all before"
Quezon,1692,4,taeyomi,,200.0,ltbx,3) These are the things you don’t learn in school
Quezon,1692,5,taeyomi,,200.0,ltbx,And I blame all these with the decision-making of Filipinos rooted from how our “leaders” led by example

Quezon,1692,9,taeyomi,,200.0,ltbx,"I understand now that one review saying this film is meant to be watched in the cinemas, as it will surely give a different feel when just watched on streaming platforms"
Quezon,1692,10,taeyomi,,200.0,ltbx,The Philippines surely is just a whole ass drama that we’re currently living in
Quezon,1692,11,taeyomi,,200.0,ltbx,"The history repeats itself, indeed"
Quezon,1692,12,taeyomi,,200.0,ltbx,Because we never learn

Quezon,1698,2,bezoomny,,160.0,ltbx,Plus sometimes the dialogue is too on the nose that it sometimes undermines the themes just so the general audience would get it

Quezon,1704,7,cinemalandi,,80.0,ltbx,Don't I know that already

Quezon,1704,9,cinemalandi,,80.0,ltbx,"And even if I did not, if that was all that I needed to realize by film's end, that was not much"
Quezon,1704,10,cinemalandi,,80.0,ltbx,That information could have been good for a documentary to explore and analyze
Quezon,1704,11,cinemalandi,,80.0,ltbx,This drama bored me because it was not dramatic enough
Quezon,1704,12,cinemalandi,,80.0,ltbx,"A tragic figure, who doesn't change or is pulled further into sad or wrong choices, has to be set up as someone who seems heroic or as one who is given a chance to change his ways by the middle of the film"
Quezon,1704,13,cinemalandi,,80.0,ltbx,"For all its freneticism, it droned"
Quezon,1704,14,cinemalandi,,80.0,ltbx,"I think it wanted to be entertaining like a Scorsese or a Chazelle, but the writing caused a pacing problem"
Quezon,1704,15,cinemalandi,,80.0,ltbx,Also wondered if anyone who did not have an idea of who Quezon was would be invested in knowing why this is important to see for any human being
Quezon,1704,16,cinemalandi,,80.0,ltbx,I wish all this technique was used on a good screenplay

Quezon,1712,3,elijjsz,,180.0,ltbx,"the kind of framing that quezon used is still evident in present-day politics, making this a timely discussion"
Quezon,1712,4,elijjsz,,180.0,ltbx,"it’s a very thought-provoking movie—it made me question whether the good deeds of our leaders were truly for the people or just for themselves, like mentioned, baka pampabango lang ng kanilang mga pangalan"

Quezon,1713,1,erudad,,80.0,ltbx,Dude they made Jorah look like an NPC
Quezon,1713,2,erudad,,80.0,ltbx,As a film this was really poorly paced and a chore to watch
Quezon,1713,3,erudad,,80.0,ltbx,Most of it seems to come down to how this was scripted
Quezon,1713,4,erudad,,80.0,ltbx,"For a movie that seemed to have a lot it wanted to say about the problems with Filipino governance, it sure pulled its punches"
Quezon,1713,5,erudad,,80.0,ltbx,"I am an idiot who doesn't know or care much about my country's history, so walking in I was hoping I could learn something definite, or gain a better understanding of our first real President"
Quezon,1713,6,erudad,,80.0,ltbx,"Instead, I sat through two hours of people suggesting that Quezon wasn't what he seemed, until we saw his camp sell the Philippines literally towards the end of the fucking movie in a throwaway scene"
Quezon,1713,7,erudad,,80.0,ltbx,"Why the fuck is the Big Bad Thing they used to make Quezon look like a bad guy was having his first wife literally walk plaintively around the assembly hall So many issues, there was a good movie in here somewhere many drafts ago"
Quezon,1713,8,erudad,,80.0,ltbx,It just felt like they were scared to piss the wrong person off
Quezon,1713,9,erudad,,80.0,ltbx,Goes to show how even close to a hundred years later it's still the same families and people pulling the strings and making us all dance

Quezon,1716,1,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"""Bayan o sarili, pumili ka"
Quezon,1716,2,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"""The Bayaniverse may have ultimately been a series of movies that are (if not for the same cast members/ completely standalone, but the bigger picture it paints is asking us the same question John Arcilla's Heneral Antonio Luna once asked a decade ago: ""Bayan o sarili"
Quezon,1716,3,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"""""Heneral Luna"" is about a man who is dedicated to giving the country its rightfully earned freedom, no matter who he has to piss off to get it"
Quezon,1716,4,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"""Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral"" is about a man who ultimately takes the fight, despite his selfish and somewhat childish nature"
Quezon,1716,5,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"""Quezon"" is about a man who is nothing but a slimy and greedy politician who uses the country's independence as a bargaining chip so he can gain power and keep it for as long as he lives"
Quezon,1716,6,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"The movie tells us outright that Quezon is not a good man, nor is he the hero of this story"
Quezon,1716,7,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,He is a villain who uses every dirty trick in the book to remain one step ahead
Quezon,1716,8,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,It paints a picture of Quezon that is all too familiar to the everyday Filipino: a politician who plays dirty games to gain sympathy so they can climb higher into power
Quezon,1716,9,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"I love how Joven Hernando, who has always been the audience surrogate, has become a more active participant in the story"
Quezon,1716,10,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"He becomes one of Quezon's pawns, another piece he could use to further his agenda"
Quezon,1716,11,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"And once Joven reverts to his roots and once again becomes an observer, that's when the rug is pulled from under him"
Quezon,1716,12,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,Joven is human
Quezon,1716,13,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"He is just like the ""heroes"" we've followed throughout the trilogy, flawed"
Quezon,1716,14,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon brings the Bayaniverse into a solid finish, bringing back everything that came from Luna and Goyo all so it can ultimately tell the big punchline: Aguinaldo outlived every single one of the people we've followed in this trilogy"
Quezon,1716,15,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"The Bayaniverse doesn't treat each and every single one of its focus as a holier-than-thou hero, but rather, humans who are just as flawed as everyone else"
Quezon,1716,16,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"And in this landscape where every other biopic in the Philippines is treated like a glorified Wikipedia list, it's a breath of fresh air"
Quezon,1716,17,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"Now, nobody knows what happens after this movie, after Bayaniverse"
Quezon,1716,18,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"Who knows, maybe the Magsaysay tease could lead into a new trilogy that once again examines the Philippines and how we've become who we are today"
Quezon,1716,19,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"Whether that happens or not, I'm glad we got to see these three movies come to life, the long way round"
Quezon,1716,20,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,"And if this does lead to another trilogy of movies, you know where I'll be"
Quezon,1716,23,thonter,,160.0,ltbx,Docking one star because the movie's soundtrack is sang by the jootsex guy
Quezon,1718,1,fiinina,,160.0,ltbx,"One of those movies you are just so incredibly engrossed in that you don’t even realize how long it actually is To utilize a film within a film was amazing to watch because of its simple yet amusing execution, not to mention its accuracy and relevance during that time"
Quezon,1718,2,fiinina,,160.0,ltbx,To see lessons and personalities I once learned in class brought to life was all the more fun… na para bang napapanood ko na lahat unfold with my own two eyes
Quezon,1718,3,fiinina,,160.0,ltbx,"And lastly, to see the mischievous games and calculated steps & agenda that transpire within the government was insane, funny, compelling, nakakagalit, nakakainis, and overall nakakagulo ng isip kasi hindi mo alam sino papanigan mo……"
Quezon,1718,4,fiinina,,160.0,ltbx,Which is the point
Quezon,1718,5,fiinina,,160.0,ltbx,These political leaders are meant to be humanized

Quezon,1729,3,carlcervantes,,160.0,ltbx,The narrarive itself could’ve trimmed a lot of fat
Quezon,1729,4,carlcervantes,,160.0,ltbx,It felt like the makers wanted to provide all relevant facts while at the same time letting the people decide for themselves
Quezon,1729,5,carlcervantes,,160.0,ltbx,"I think that if this series hadn’t gotten too meta, too self-conscious about its actual effect on Philippine society, it could’ve really been more courageous and straightforward"
Quezon,1729,6,carlcervantes,,160.0,ltbx,Hearing Jericho Rosales speak was jarring at first—having known him as an affable romantic lead—but he dissolves into his playful characterization
Quezon,1729,7,carlcervantes,,160.0,ltbx,"Women were also there, but they didn’t really do much to move the story along, or at all participate in it—perhaps a choice in storytelling, and a subconscious tendency that may need to be reflected on"

Quezon,1737,7,yenisastar,,200.0,ltbx,This whole triology really highlights how IMPORTANT the media is and how important neutrality is when it comes to news reporting
Quezon,1737,8,yenisastar,,200.0,ltbx,Framing really does influence our views and opinions on matters
Quezon,1737,9,yenisastar,,200.0,ltbx,"And finally, this whole triology series is just so timely"
Quezon,1737,10,yenisastar,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s really depressing that despite Quezon happening a few decades after the death of Heneral Luna and Goyo, the Philippines was still suffering with the same issue"
Quezon,1737,11,yenisastar,,200.0,ltbx,Actually it has been decades (nearing 100 years) since the Commonwealth period and a century since Heneral Luna’s time and we are still facing the SAME issue now
Quezon,1737,12,yenisastar,,200.0,ltbx,The Filipinos’ real enemy is not foreign rule
Quezon,1737,13,yenisastar,,200.0,ltbx,Its their fellow Filipinos who have selfish agendas
Quezon,1737,14,yenisastar,,200.0,ltbx,So many government officials yet so little government officials that actually serves the public
Quezon,1737,15,yenisastar,,200.0,ltbx,"So… pili ka, Bayan o Sarili"
Quezon,1738,1,mrkchrstn,,180.0,ltbx,"- clever use of on-screen plot guides through silent black-and-white propaganda films- fast-paced, which reminded me of 90's scorsese with the blockings and cinematography"
Quezon,1738,2,mrkchrstn,,180.0,ltbx,"great change of tempo for suspense- funny most of the time, but gets serious for emphasis"
Quezon,1738,3,mrkchrstn,,180.0,ltbx,- Romnick Sarmienta should be given credit for his performance

Quezon,1740,1,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,What a beautifully shot film that screams “sarswela” from start to end
Quezon,1740,2,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,"As remarked by my partner, political dramas told by pinoys for pinoys are best presented in a comedic angle with the frequent spoonfeeding just to make sure the audience is caught up"
Quezon,1740,3,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,"This is personified by Joven’s character with the insistent need to have a third person pov to narrate the story (similar to Himala’s Orly), rather than just showing the events for what they are, otherwise the narrative can’t be controlled"
Quezon,1740,4,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,Further amplified in the scene of Wood asking if Filipinos actually understood what “independence” truly meant
Quezon,1740,5,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,"Maybe that’s the point of sandwiching humor (today: memes) in the gravity of our political state, it’s still relevant to the sarswela we have in the government today"
Quezon,1740,6,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,"The theme of storytelling through film does hit a very important mark in this trilogy— how heneral luna influenced the rise of a strongman president, and how it circled back in this third installation portraying the power of politcal alliances, uniteam"
Quezon,1740,8,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,"I do want to point out how so filipino movie-coded this is, with, of course, using women’s suffering as a plot device to move men’s story forward"
Quezon,1740,9,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,"How necessary was it to use a rape case other than as a threat and show the title character as cocky(we already know that), or how it’s scandalous that he’s bigamous (we already know that), or how aurora is complicit to all these"
Quezon,1740,10,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,"And, at the end, bears nothing to the story"
Quezon,1740,11,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,"Honestly, all those parts could’ve been cut from the film and it would have still held up"
Quezon,1740,12,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,"Lastly, I was first distracted looking at Jericho Rosales and not think of Echo the Hunk"
Quezon,1740,13,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,By the end of the film he was truly Quezon to me
Quezon,1740,14,user1511rosie,,140.0,ltbx,"Anyway, mambo, mambo, magsaysay"
Quezon,1741,1,masvidal,,180.0,ltbx,"this is a beautifully shot movie, jericho rosales oozes charisma and i thought he's like tommy shelby without the violence"
Quezon,1742,1,elijini,,160.0,ltbx,watched this w/o seeing goyo first so my views rn may or may not differ after i watched goyo
Quezon,1742,2,elijini,,160.0,ltbx,hearing about the american colonization during my history classes and then watching now in cinemas how it may have played back then really gave me a clearer perspective of the past (esp as a visual learner)
Quezon,1742,3,elijini,,160.0,ltbx,really love how these films humanizes our 'heroes' and encourages us to be critical too
Quezon,1742,4,elijini,,160.0,ltbx,maybe i just don't like have the movie framed aguinaldo as the good and better one knowing there were many controversies surrounding him too
Quezon,1742,5,elijini,,160.0,ltbx,"visual and sound-wise, the film was just really great"
Quezon,1742,6,elijini,,160.0,ltbx,"that stairs scene of sergio and quezon, and then that scene aguinaldo and quezon right after his speech were one of my faves"
Quezon,1742,7,elijini,,160.0,ltbx,"also, the mambo magsaysay jingle at the end was eerily haunting"

Quezon,1747,1,pidyot,,160.0,ltbx,"A beautifully crafted film about heroism, heroes, and the humanity behind them"
Quezon,1747,2,pidyot,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho’s portrayal of Quezon is a breath of fresh air: layered and compelling
Quezon,1747,3,pidyot,,160.0,ltbx,I especially loved how his Quezon seamlessly shifts depending on who he’s speaking too
Quezon,1747,4,pidyot,,160.0,ltbx,“A chameleon” as shared by Leonard Wood if im not mistaken
Quezon,1747,5,pidyot,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, I finally understood Joven’s character arc from Luna to Goyo to this"
Quezon,1747,7,pidyot,,160.0,ltbx,"If I had one critique, it would be that the film sometimes leans too heavily on dialogue to explain the history"
Quezon,1747,8,pidyot,,160.0,ltbx,"It borders on overkill, in some parts, methinks"
Quezon,1747,9,pidyot,,160.0,ltbx,But overall this is a film worth watching

Quezon,1762,5,jujusining,,180.0,ltbx,"” It’s for you to find out, so watch Quezon"
Quezon,1762,6,jujusining,,180.0,ltbx,This film also reminds us not to blindly patronize our politicians—real change starts with awareness and accountability

Quezon,1764,1,pancake09,,140.0,ltbx,“Independence” was mentioned so many times I almost wanted to roll my eyes
Quezon,1764,2,pancake09,,140.0,ltbx,"At first it was fine, but later it got too obvious"
Quezon,1764,3,pancake09,,140.0,ltbx,"Alright, we get it"
Quezon,1764,4,pancake09,,140.0,ltbx,Move along
Quezon,1764,5,pancake09,,140.0,ltbx,"There was also too much explanation, both from the two journalists with Quezon and from the cinema scenes"
Quezon,1764,6,pancake09,,140.0,ltbx,"It would’ve been fun if it were actually funny, but the quips just sounded like plain observations"
Quezon,1764,7,pancake09,,140.0,ltbx,"If this were a book, it would feel like reading in third person with multiple POVs"

Quezon,1764,9,pancake09,,140.0,ltbx,But it was still a good watch

Quezon,1766,1,theroyalspice,,140.0,ltbx,"enjoyed this even more than luna & goyo - in spite of the lack of the high-octane action & bravado of its predecessors, QUEZON is a truly worthy conclusion to the bayaniverse trilogy"
Quezon,1766,2,theroyalspice,,140.0,ltbx,"it's a clever, entertaining, nail-biter of a biopic that lifts the curtain on a man we all know of, but hardly examine"
Quezon,1766,3,theroyalspice,,140.0,ltbx,"thought-provoking because its politics hits too close to home now - it's about the origins of institutional corruption, political machinery, and patronage politics of present-day philippines (except the morally corrupt of these times have the collective charisma of manuel quezon's toenail, and they still manage to screw all of us over, imagine that)highly recommend esp for those who love in-your-face political intrigue and men-unfortunately-having-the-audacity as a genrealso: crush ng bayan JERICHO ROSALES WE LOVE YOU"

Quezon,1767,4,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,I was shocked at first at how absurd the title seemed
Quezon,1767,5,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon being the blueprint of dictators like Ferdinand Marcos Sr

Quezon,1767,13,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"Strangely though, historical films about the struggle for Philippine independence rarely focus on the life of the first President of the Commonwealth"
Quezon,1767,14,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"There are countless cinematic imaginations of figures like Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, and Emilio Aguinaldo"
Quezon,1767,15,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"But I can only remember one film about Quezon, the very bland Schindler’s List knock off Quezon’s Game"
Quezon,1767,16,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon is portrayed as a stoic hero, allowing Jewish people to seek refuge as Nazis and World War II circle in on the country"
Quezon,1767,17,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"After reading McCoy and watching Jerrold Tarog’s film, that film even looks worse"
Quezon,1767,18,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,Tarog’s Quezon is what exactly the country needs right now
Quezon,1767,19,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,A repudiation of the myth of a “Great Man” and his legacy
Quezon,1767,20,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,A stark reminder of the illusion of Philippine independence and the role of native elites in perpetuating the very system the foreign colonizers used for subjugation
Quezon,1767,21,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"The election race between Aguinaldo and Quezon, framed as a battle between the old and the new, even resembles the upcoming 2028 presidential race between the Marcos and the Duterte dynasties"
Quezon,1767,22,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,A choice between two evils
Quezon,1767,23,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"The screenplay is impressive in its weaving of multiple timelines in Quezon’s political career, examining the key relationships (Sergio Osmeña, Emilio Aguinaldo, Leonard Wood, the fictional Joven Hernando) that defined it"
Quezon,1767,24,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"It reminds me of The Social Network and Oppenheimer in its nonlinearity, an always welcome structure compared to the dominant cradle to grave biopic structure"
Quezon,1767,25,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"Black and white 1930-style sequences, featuring the best looking shots of an otherwise blandly photographed and colored film, frame the entire narrative"
Quezon,1767,26,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,And it is here where Tarrog’s screenplay surprises in its examination of the role of cinema in political propaganda and collective imagination
Quezon,1767,27,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"Joven, the Bayaniverse’s audience surrogate, finally becomes a compelling character, as he wrestles with supporting Quezon’s presidency"
Quezon,1767,28,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"The humorous tone is another welcome approach, playing up the ironies of Quezon’s political decisions from being a collectivist ideologue to supporting the working class to slightly changing an independents act to take credit away from Osmeña"
Quezon,1767,29,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,The tone is a good contrast to the rather dull self seriousness of the preceding Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral
Quezon,1767,30,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon is a comical figure: a petty, narcissistic, scheming con artist"
Quezon,1767,31,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,A far cry from the image of a noble patriot many have
Quezon,1767,32,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales radiates an almost DiCaprio-like energy and charisma; the loudness of Rosales’s Quezon, in his verbal sparring and speeches, masks the shallowness of his intentions for independence"
Quezon,1767,33,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,Tarrog’s screenplay does flounder with the theme of the hollowness of Philippine independence
Quezon,1767,34,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,“Do you know what independence means
Quezon,1767,35,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"”, asks Governor-General Wood to peasant Filipino farmers"
Quezon,1767,36,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,The scene seems to be played for laughs at the expense of Filipinos who are portrayed as having a simplistic understanding of the meaning of freedom
Quezon,1767,37,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"Rather than further visualize the plight of working class Filipinos, the film does relegate them to the margins"
Quezon,1767,38,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"The formation of Quezon City, the planned home for Manila’s laborers, is a pivotal moment in Quezon’s political career and the country’s history"
Quezon,1767,39,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"And yet, the film omits or does not tackle what would have been a perfect illustration of Quezon’s contradictions"
Quezon,1767,40,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"But, to the film’s credit, it is long enough already"
Quezon,1767,41,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,Perhaps it’s best discussed by another film
Quezon,1767,42,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon is a rare biopic in this country
Quezon,1767,43,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,We’ve had cinematic deconstructions of Filipino heroes like Rizal and Aguinaldo already
Quezon,1767,44,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,But never has there been a film that demystifies a supposed hero as nothing more than an egotistical opportunist — not unlike the greedy and insincere politicians at the center of the ongoing DPWH flood control investigation
Quezon,1767,45,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,"Even if the film has flaws in its bland cinematography and visualizing the struggle of working class Filipinos, it’s hard for me to not be riled up after watching Tarrog’s Quezon"
Quezon,1767,46,xpert_ninja,,180.0,ltbx,That’s great enough for me
Quezon,1768,1,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"The movie, “Quezon” by Jerrold Tarog completes the so-called BAYANIverse trilogy that also includes “Heneral Luna” and “Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral”"
Quezon,1768,2,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,The trilogy (post-credit suggests a fourth biopic) was designed to deconstruct the myth surrounding Philippine national heroes by portraying them as flawed and complex human beings rather than perfect heroes we place on pedestals
Quezon,1768,3,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"This is an enjoyable, brisk, and highly opinionated biopic on Quezon"
Quezon,1768,4,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,Making a film about history in an entertaining manner is always a challenge but Tarog and co-screenwriter Rody Vera passed with flying colors with a screenplay that intricately weaves historical facts with cinematic storytelling
Quezon,1768,5,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,They did this with the masterful insertion of fictional characters Joven Hernando and his daughter Nadia Hernando
Quezon,1768,6,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,They also avoided the pitfall biopics usually fall into—pointlessly following a chronological order and trying to present everything
Quezon,1768,7,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"Here, they used Quezon's political skirmishes with Leonard Wood, Sergio Osmeña and Emilio Aguinaldo to tell the story of the consummate politician"
Quezon,1768,8,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"Kudos to Jericho Rosales for his portrayal of Quezon: temperamental, mercurial, and unpredictable"
Quezon,1768,9,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,I had my doubts if he could pull it off when I saw the trailer but happy to have been proven wrong
Quezon,1768,10,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,He is at his best when attempting to charm his way out of a predicament and outwitting his adversaries
Quezon,1768,11,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,Quezon is undoubtedly a compelling and complex individual
Quezon,1768,12,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"“Elastic, electric”; “one of the world’s supplest and hardest-boiled practical politician”; these were some of the words used by John Gunther in an article for January 1939 issue of The Atlantic Monthly"
Quezon,1768,13,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"But such reading of the man who became President of the Philippine Commonwealth, Gunther noted, was “only a fraction of the complex, composite truth”"
Quezon,1768,14,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"The movie portrays Quezon as Machiavellian—scheming, manipulative, and self-interested"
Quezon,1768,15,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"He bossed legislators using the largesse at his disposal, and by threatening them with political ostracism"
Quezon,1768,16,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,He valued the loyalty and gratitude of those around him
Quezon,1768,17,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,He would reward those who helped and followed him with jobs and pensions
Quezon,1768,18,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"This is clearly portrayed in his relationship with Emilio Aguinaldo, whose farm and pension he took away when the latter dared to run against him in the country’s first ever elections"
Quezon,1768,19,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"But Quezon was also “a genuine revolutionary” as Gunther noted, “the history of the Philippine Islands in the twentieth century and the biography of Manuel Quezon are indissolubly one”"
Quezon,1768,20,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,He was also loved by the masses because of his support for the marginalized
Quezon,1768,21,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"He was the one who set minimum wages for government laborers, established an eight-hour working day, and slapped higher taxes on the rich"
Quezon,1768,22,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,I had to rewatch Heneral Luna and Goyo before watching Quezon
Quezon,1768,23,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"I think the trilogy succeeded in reimagining these three heroes revealing more intricate, conflicted human beings"
Quezon,1768,24,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,But I also hoped that the trilogy could have focused more on nation-building rather than personalities
Quezon,1768,25,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,I understand the need to focus on heroic personalities in these biopics but I hope viewers came out of cinemas not just thinking about heroes as history but also this: the road to nationhood and statehood is complicated
Quezon,1768,26,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,It is still unraveling today
Quezon,1768,27,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,It is still complicated
Quezon,1768,28,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,Saying that the Filipinos united against colonizers to fight for freedom and become one nation is naive
Quezon,1768,29,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"To be fair, Tarog hinted at this in Heneral Luna and Goyo by depicting the regional differences of the revolutionaries and how it contributed to Aguinaldo’s defeat"
Quezon,1768,30,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,But can we blame the Ilocanos or the Kapampangans
Quezon,1768,31,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,The revolutionaries from the different regions were fighting for a nation that wasn't there yet
Quezon,1768,32,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,This was Jose Rizal’s obsession during his time—the lack of a national consciousness
Quezon,1768,33,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"He spent, and offered, his life to lay the groundwork for a collective national identity, a shared sense of being a nation"
Quezon,1768,34,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,Quezon was more pragmatic in his approach
Quezon,1768,35,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"He said, “In statecraft the most important thing is the goal"
Quezon,1768,36,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"” In other words, the end justifies the means"
Quezon,1768,37,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"Quezon, of course, would never publicly admit that the goal of independence from the United States is intrinsically tied to ambition"
Quezon,1768,38,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"To his mind, what hurt would it do if the national goal and his interest align"
Quezon,1768,39,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"One of the most powerful moments in the film was when Joven was pontificating in front of Quezon, berating him for his greed and scheming ways"
Quezon,1768,40,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,Quezon then turned the tables around telling Joven that he was in fact an accomplice because he also benefitted from Quezon
Quezon,1768,41,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,The US role in all these should not be diminished
Quezon,1768,42,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,By organizing local elections they essentially empowered local warlords to acquire power setting the stage for their capture of central government
Quezon,1768,43,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,There were instances when the movie relied too much on commentaries rather than storytelling
Quezon,1768,44,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,"I really appreciate movies, especially those with political and social messages, that exercise restraint—when it does not tell us how to feel and what to think"
Quezon,1768,45,reytrillana,,120.0,ltbx,Rather than spoon-feeding us it is more important to give us the opportunity to decide for ourselves

Quezon,1770,2,pluieenmoi,,180.0,ltbx,"Inspired by the American colonial era and Hollywood influence, Quezon proved how entertainment, facade, and shallow promises built the system of the Philippine politics"
Quezon,1770,3,pluieenmoi,,180.0,ltbx,"How can a belief rooted on community and collectivism, utang na loob, be used as a tool to advance evil and selfish desires"
Quezon,1770,4,pluieenmoi,,180.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales's portrayal of the former president captures raw greed and charming manipulation despite moments of animated dialogue
Quezon,1770,5,pluieenmoi,,180.0,ltbx,The use of Arron Villafor and Cris Villanueva could have been better managed to accurately represent the mix of timelines

Quezon,1775,2,saseanne,,160.0,ltbx,He was a cynical politician who centralized power in himself
Quezon,1775,3,saseanne,,160.0,ltbx,A precursor to the Marcoses and Dutertes of the world
Quezon,1775,4,saseanne,,160.0,ltbx,"While it would be wrong to pin the blame only on him for the kind of politics that we have now, he definitely set a terrible precedent for our succeeding leaders"
Quezon,1775,5,saseanne,,160.0,ltbx,Also LOVE how the film showcased the unhealthy marriage of joirnalists and politicians
Quezon,1775,6,saseanne,,160.0,ltbx,"My only gripe with this movie is I find myself asking, so what"
Quezon,1775,7,saseanne,,160.0,ltbx,"I get the message about how our politicians are, but okay we know that, now what"
Quezon,1775,8,saseanne,,160.0,ltbx,"We had that in Heneral Luna, but not here in Quezon which is a bit disappointing for me"

Quezon,1777,2,xephsuarez,,160.0,ltbx,"Overall, the film playfully captures the persona of Manuel Luis Quezon — the Philippines’ OG “trapo"
Quezon,1777,3,xephsuarez,,160.0,ltbx,"”To add: I find it poetic how Quezon City poises itself as the center of the country’s film industry while, a little less than a century ago, the man the city was named after used the then emerging power of cinema to advance his political agenda"

Quezon,1780,2,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,It is the same game in a new mask—the same battle in a different battlefield
Quezon,1780,3,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,It has always caught my interest that the Bayani-verse shows the humanity in figures revered by their good actions in the past
Quezon,1780,4,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,It grounds the character to a playing field in which we can analyze their actions and flaws as if they are not above us at all
Quezon,1780,5,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,It gives the audience space to ponder the differences between the praises given on history books and the reality of the human experience
Quezon,1780,6,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,Film is always such an amazing platform for storytelling in ways that capture essence and displays an overarching sense of humor in our lives even in serious moments
Quezon,1780,7,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon concludes the first battle by showing us that in war or in the pursuit of independence, politics has always been the same"
Quezon,1780,8,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,It is rooted in tactics and is played out as a game
Quezon,1780,9,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,Battle of minds and leverage is the front of all this
Quezon,1780,10,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,A greater focus should be on the sequence in which they discuss the readiness of the country for independence
Quezon,1780,11,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,"From now and then, the comprehension of concepts allows the nation to grasp what it wants"
Quezon,1780,12,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,"If the word independence could not be understood before, now it has ballooned to so much more"
Quezon,1780,13,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,Terms that now hide from the public to understand
Quezon,1780,14,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,"Watching this film, the people behind me were in shock when the word communist was mentioned"
Quezon,1780,15,zkyrysh,,160.0,ltbx,I knew there and then that they do not know the concept of this ideology much like the Filipinos that did not understand independence

Quezon,1785,2,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"”Unlike the first two installments of the Bayaniverse, Quezon throws all subtlety out the window and says everything straight to your face"
Quezon,1785,3,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"I took an elective on the History of the Philippine Presidency last semester, and we spent almost half of it just talking about Quezon"
Quezon,1785,4,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,Watching the film felt exactly like that — a two-hour lecture where all the facts are dumped on you
Quezon,1785,5,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,Maybe that's not entirely a bad thing
Quezon,1785,6,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,Maybe it's better that there's no room for misinterpretation or assumptions of what the film wants to say
Quezon,1785,7,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"Maybe that's what we need as a nation: to be told, directly and unapologetically, what needs to be done for us to become better"
Quezon,1785,8,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,Quezon feels painfully familiar because everything in it mirrors our current news cycle — a political shitshow where those in power do everything to hold on to it
Quezon,1785,9,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"At first, it’s laughable"
Quezon,1785,10,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"But eventually, it stops being funny, and we’re just left angry"
Quezon,1785,11,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,We deserve better than someone like Quezon
Quezon,1785,12,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,We deserve better than leaders obsessed with themselves but blind to the people they’re supposed to serve
Quezon,1785,13,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,We deserve better than naming cities after them or printing their faces on our money
Quezon,1785,14,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,We need to stop turning flawed men into untouchable icons and start being honest about what their legacies should look like
Quezon,1785,15,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"Tarog’s meta-commentary in this third installment is interesting, but the constant switching between the younger and older versions of the characters can get confusing"
Quezon,1785,16,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,I get what he’s trying to do
Quezon,1785,17,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"He wants us to remind that history can be reconstructed or reinterpreted, but sometimes it pulls the story away from having emotional or narrative depth"
Quezon,1785,18,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"That said, the ensemble was great, but Karylle was especially exceptional"
Quezon,1785,19,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"The unsure, restrained, and quiet glances she gives when the camera lingers on her say so much about a woman’s place in our nation’s fight for independence: sidelined and often overlooked"
Quezon,1785,20,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"As her character tells his husband, “Naniniwala akong naniniwala kang tama ‘yang pinaglalaban mo"
Quezon,1785,21,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,”With Tarog’s Bayaniverse coming to a close (or is it
Quezon,1785,22,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"), it feels like the fight that should’ve started long ago is only just beginning"
Quezon,1785,23,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,"Saying “we should fight” can get tiring and repetitive, but then again, maybe that’s why films like this still matter"
Quezon,1785,24,vlaaaaaaadddddd,,140.0,ltbx,Because we still see leaders like Quezon today

Quezon,1789,1,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"Manuel Luis Quezon (Benjamin Alves as the younger version) inside the prison cell at the beginning of the film submits to a calling he himself invokes,an act of total surrender to the shining light of messianic delusion: he as a vanguard of freedom,a savior of the nation"
Quezon,1789,2,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"This scene lays down the very blueprint of the man, and the DNA of the third film of Jerrold Tarog's Bayaniverse shown at such a time as this"
Quezon,1789,3,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"Tarrog's deconstruction of Manuel Quezon easily reveals a pattern, the four chapters proving how the Commonwealth figure wields power"
Quezon,1789,4,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"The film depicts Joven Hernando (Aaron Villaflor/Cris Villanueva) as the conflicted source of truth and keeper of lies, he being witness to the former and he being made to hide the latter"
Quezon,1789,5,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon ought to strip Hernando of his journalistic freedom lest he (Hernando) destroy the masses' perception of the politician
Quezon,1789,6,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"Cassey, as the Americans call Quezon,orders silence as a tool that the film also uses to depict politics as a performance where Cassey plays the main part and masters it to perfection"
Quezon,1789,7,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,Cassey's political campaign by way of showing silent films visualizes the performative act
Quezon,1789,8,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"A man plays someone he is not,living the dream so long as he has the power, so long as he is able to craft perception and accord himself the grandeur"
Quezon,1789,9,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"His bouts against Sergio Osmeña (Romnick Sarmienta), Leonard Wood (Iain Glenn), and Emilio Aguinaldo (Mon Confiado) easily reflect what we see today: politics as a game, interests at the center, power as the ultimate goal"
Quezon,1789,10,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,The scene where Quezon walks back to his seat after his speech while Aguinaldo walks towards the podium projects a duel reflective of the political motion that haunts our nation: each going a different direction but aiming for the same peak of dominance
Quezon,1789,11,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"The score is aptly dramatic and haunting, giving the scene the verve that seals what we make of our politicians--if we haven't settled that yet"
Quezon,1789,12,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales brilliantly plays Manuel Quezon as the Senate President and the President of the Commonwealth by consistently creating the identity of the man who cannot be caught defeated
Quezon,1789,13,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"His performance naturally shows Quezon as a larger-than-life figure, the center around which everything revolves"
Quezon,1789,14,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"That the film depicts him in this magnitude makes everyone else small, especially the masses whom he declares he works for"
Quezon,1789,15,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,But not only are they rendered small; they are also voiceless and invisible
Quezon,1789,16,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"When a poor man defines independence as food, the film unmistakably captures power and its fuel"
Quezon,1789,17,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"It rightfully pictures the masses being the ultimate victims of the fraud that is politics, the victims of the insatiable dreams of the narcissists where they (masses) are subconsciously the empaths that support their (narcissists) fantasy"
Quezon,1789,18,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,And so we laugh because the film is a farce as much as it is a political drama whose emotional interjection comes at the far end of the spectacle
Quezon,1789,19,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,It comes as a silent wave of heartbreak and desperation
Quezon,1789,20,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,For ourselves
Quezon,1789,21,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,For our nation
Quezon,1789,22,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,How else should the film show Quezon at the end but the way the film does

Quezon,1789,24,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"At a point where he no longer has influence,what are the words that matter"
Quezon,1789,25,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"The film serves the closure we deserve from a man we've come to know from the very beginning,the consistency Quezon can never make himself to break because his nature will never allow it"
Quezon,1789,26,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,His last words affirm his fantasy
Quezon,1789,27,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"Saying ""I am the Philippines"" can never be more delusional"

Quezon,1791,4,billyregala,,200.0,ltbx,I think it is truly important to note how power can be intoxicating but we also have to be reminded as voters that we have power to put these people in positions
Quezon,1791,5,billyregala,,200.0,ltbx,We should be more critical of them and make them understand that who they are serving are us and not themselves
Quezon,1791,6,billyregala,,200.0,ltbx,The film also encapsulates how media can also be used to change narratives and we have seen that be weaponized in today's time as well
Quezon,1791,7,billyregala,,200.0,ltbx,We need stories like these to remind us of where power should lie and how these politically corrupt actions can lead to our demise as a nation
Quezon,1791,8,billyregala,,200.0,ltbx,There are good and bad sides to people but I think it is important to remember them both and not put anyone on a pedestal high enough for no one to reach them but instead make them understand where true power lies - in us

Quezon,1812,1,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,Film Review: Quezon (dir
Quezon,1812,2,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"Jerrold Tarog, 2025)When I was young, Manuel Quezon was a romanticized figure, hailed as the one who earned the Philippines its independence, and also the “Father of the National Language"
Quezon,1812,3,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"” Aside from that, I really know nothing about that guy"
Quezon,1812,4,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"Several years later, I came across a copy of Ambeth Ocampo’s “Quezon’s Sukiyaki,” a collection of essays about several historical figures in Filipino history"
Quezon,1812,5,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,It contained some interesting notes on Quezon’s boisterous nature
Quezon,1812,6,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"Further readings unraveled Quezon’s more devious side as a politician, which was the main theme of Jerrold Tarog’s newest film"
Quezon,1812,7,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,“Quezon” chronicled the rise of the titular character from a veteran of the Filipino-American War to the president of the Philippine Commonwealth
Quezon,1812,8,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,The movie deviated from the typical depictions of the former president
Quezon,1812,9,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"Here we saw Quezon at his most unscrupulous, a true political chameleon"
Quezon,1812,10,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,Whatever glazed images I had of the man evaporated after watching this movie
Quezon,1812,11,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"Suffice to say, Quezon was the original trapo"
Quezon,1812,12,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"While it can be said that he genuinely cared about independence, he surely had his hands dirty, and his priority was after all, his own interests"
Quezon,1812,13,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales was phenomenal in his role- adapting Quezon’s speech patterns and mannerisms
Quezon,1812,14,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"I was a bit skeptical when he was announced to be the lead, but Echo was a great actor after all and he surely proved it"
Quezon,1812,15,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"Mon Confiado’s performance in this movie as Aguinaldo was a stark contrast from the other Bayaniverse films: the Aguinaldo in “Quezon” was more mellow, seemingly remorseful, softened by age"
Quezon,1812,16,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,It was amazing of Mon to portray the same character in three different ways
Quezon,1812,17,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"The performance of the actors in this film was phenomenal, and I think everyone pulled their weight"
Quezon,1812,18,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,I must specifically praise Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña
Quezon,1812,19,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,His bickering with Quezon was one of the film's highlights
Quezon,1812,20,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,I think “Quezon” was the most creative in all Bayaniverse films
Quezon,1812,21,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,I particularly liked the silent film snippets
Quezon,1812,22,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,It showed us the importance of media arts in shaping political opinions
Quezon,1812,23,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"I also appreciated the use of the rondalla as the main musical force of the movie: it made the movie sound more like a Filipino political comedy, compared to its militaristic predecessors"
Quezon,1812,24,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,Compared to “Heneral Luna” and “Goyo” there were barely any action scenes in the movies
Quezon,1812,25,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"The battles were fought through verbal sparring, scheming, and persuasion"
Quezon,1812,26,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,It was a unique Bayaniverse movie
Quezon,1812,27,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"I don't have many criticisms against this movie, although a certain cameo mildly soured my viewing experience"
Quezon,1812,28,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, I wish we saw more of the Japanese occupation, to see a different side of Quezon"
Quezon,1812,29,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"I must say though, that the ending was hauntingly good"
Quezon,1812,30,carloupeng,,160.0,ltbx,"A great film, nonetheless"
Quezon,1814,1,chelsonduty,,160.0,ltbx,"I believe in the innocence of Tarog's intentions and artistry, and I stand by my opinion that he didn't foresee how his depiction of Luna will be used to amplify the evil spawn's charisma to the masses back in '16"
Quezon,1814,2,chelsonduty,,160.0,ltbx,Goyo tried to correct stuff but majority wasn't ready for its message then
Quezon,1814,3,chelsonduty,,160.0,ltbx,"Now, here comes the much awaited final film of the Bayani trilogy, at last"
Quezon,1814,4,chelsonduty,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon has a much refined commentary compared to the first two
Quezon,1814,5,chelsonduty,,160.0,ltbx,It's well-paced
Quezon,1814,6,chelsonduty,,160.0,ltbx,Couple of hours flew by quick
Quezon,1814,7,chelsonduty,,160.0,ltbx,"If Filipinos weren't brainwashed with fake news on a reel-to-reel basis for the past nine years, this film could've easily made an impact in our political landscape heavier than Luna ever did"
Quezon,1814,8,chelsonduty,,160.0,ltbx,Another quality film worth seeing in the big screen
Quezon,1814,9,chelsonduty,,160.0,ltbx,"It's just heartbreaking that several decades after Quezon's reign, the Philippines has yet to achieve true independence from traditional and patronage politics"
Quezon,1815,1,e1cid,,120.0,ltbx,all these men just pissed me off so bad
Quezon,1815,2,e1cid,,120.0,ltbx,except joven thank god he's fictional
Quezon,1816,1,allisoneperry,,160.0,ltbx,never knew that quezon and osmeña have an homoerotic friendship
Quezon,1817,1,femmencl,,160.0,ltbx,"Shows how much the Philippine government never really progressed since the commonwealth-- the americans set us up to fail and as filipinos who underwent slavery, it became a culture to toy with politics"
Quezon,1817,2,femmencl,,160.0,ltbx,Could have been a five star if the certain influencer who supported and endorsed corrupt trapos didn't make a cameo and if some dialogue was trimmed down (wow

Quezon,1821,2,rurinzu,,180.0,ltbx,"Growing up, I have had this infallible—almost immaculate image of former President Quezon in my mind"
Quezon,1821,3,rurinzu,,180.0,ltbx,He was always dubbed as the “Father of the Filipino Language” and it didn’t help that he was my Grandpa’s favorite president ever
Quezon,1821,4,rurinzu,,180.0,ltbx,All I heard about Manuel was good things
Quezon,1821,5,rurinzu,,180.0,ltbx,"This film shocked me, as the once perfect image I had of this “great” man (and I put quotation marks on that word because iykyk) was systematically debunked by the exposition of all his flaws"
Quezon,1821,6,rurinzu,,180.0,ltbx,Direct Tarog succeeded in humanizing this man
Quezon,1821,7,rurinzu,,180.0,ltbx,"Jericho really disappeared in this role, as I was convinced that he was a direct 1:1 copy of Mr"
Quezon,1821,8,rurinzu,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon himself
Quezon,1821,9,rurinzu,,180.0,ltbx,"The mannerisms, the intensity, the accent; he nailed it and really captured the swagger of this “great” man (again, iykyk)"
Quezon,1821,10,rurinzu,,180.0,ltbx,"Mon Confiado is Mon Confiado, Rominick was great and very adorable as Osmeña, Iain Glen was excellent also, despite only appearing briefly"
Quezon,1821,11,rurinzu,,180.0,ltbx,"I loved the music, the occasional slapstick comedy, and the silent film parts"
Quezon,1821,12,rurinzu,,180.0,ltbx,Could have been 5 stars but I found some scenes a little confusing and if it weren’t for that CongTV cameo lol

Quezon,1824,3,jerichodc16,,180.0,ltbx,"the cinematography, the quiet emotional weight, the historical depth — everything just hits"

Quezon,1826,1,izedkape,,160.0,ltbx,Simply an amazing film to end Tarog’s Bayani Trilogy
Quezon,1826,2,izedkape,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon harnessed the strengths of its predecessors Heneral Luna and Goyo, producing a film with strong storytelling, great actors, and awesome cinematography"
Quezon,1826,3,izedkape,,160.0,ltbx,"Although he did not physically look like the mestizo Casey, Jericho Rosales delivered an enigmatic performance well-deserving of acting awards"
Quezon,1826,4,izedkape,,160.0,ltbx,"But among its merits, perhaps my favorite thing about Quezon is its pointed delivery of political critique not only towards the current administration but to the long history of corrupted, patronizing, and self-serving Philippine politics"
Quezon,1826,5,izedkape,,160.0,ltbx,"I know for sure that it is not only me who feared that Quezon would end up sanitizing the former president’s image, as films about politicians and heroes tended to do so"
Quezon,1826,6,izedkape,,160.0,ltbx,"But alas, Quezon was not usual biopic that mythologized the man — instead, it demystified him, reintroducing the former President that plastered his and his wife’s name all over his home province and the biggest city in Metro Manila"
Quezon,1826,7,izedkape,,160.0,ltbx,"It was able to effectively deliver Manuel Luis Quezon as the cunning politician, borderline dictator that he is"
Quezon,1826,8,izedkape,,160.0,ltbx,"Alongside his intelligent spiels and populist rhetoric, the film revealed the unapologetic and manipulative character of the 2nd President of the Philippine Republic — the man who laid the formula of political maneuvering for the politicians and would-be presidents after him, proving Alfred McCoy’s view that Quezon’s Commonwealth paved the way for Philippine authoritarianism"
Quezon,1826,9,izedkape,,160.0,ltbx,I do hope that Tarog continues to develop new historical fiction films in the future
Quezon,1826,10,izedkape,,160.0,ltbx,"More than ever, we need more films that tackle and communicate our history in interesting ways that provoke the audience to revisit our past and reexamine our stances on our ‘great’ men"

Quezon,1829,7,edsaur_,,140.0,ltbx,You'll see him greedy and hungry for power and you know that he doesn't like when people do not make something good out of him
Quezon,1829,8,edsaur_,,140.0,ltbx,"Connecting this movie Quezon's Game (2018), without giving any spoilers, the influence of MLQ to the whites is superior over Aguinaldo's stance"
Quezon,1829,9,edsaur_,,140.0,ltbx,"Speaking of Aguinaldo, this is where I think he's reaping what he had sowed the bad decisions he had done"
Quezon,1829,10,edsaur_,,140.0,ltbx,Though you may fill pity for him because of what he had faced in the movie
Quezon,1829,11,edsaur_,,140.0,ltbx,"You'll witness also how JOVEN that was beside MLQ throughout the movie to confront him and protested what he truly feels and that stands out because Joven, he witnessed the history and voices what a youth could've said it also before"

Quezon,1846,1,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon closes out Jerrold Tarog's Bayaniverse as a farcical deconstruction of the idea that one ""Great Man"" can lead a nation to prosperity"
Quezon,1846,2,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,"With Joven as the audience surrogate of the trilogy, Tarog makes sure that this myth is shattered"
Quezon,1846,3,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,We see Joven slowly but surely become disillusioned as he realizes the dangers of putting a face to a political movement
Quezon,1846,4,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,Gone are the days where he puts these strong and charismatic men on a pedestal
Quezon,1846,5,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,This film feels the most pointed of the trilogy
Quezon,1846,6,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,Tarog's screenplay feels quite self-conscious as it sometimes overexplains itself
Quezon,1846,7,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,This film really wants to make a point amidst today's political turmoil
Quezon,1846,8,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,Politics is a game
Quezon,1846,9,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,It paints Quezon as a charismatic yet narcissistic manipulator who knew how to play it so well that he may just be the showman who invented political chess
Quezon,1846,10,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,"He's basically a glorified ""trapo"" who's tidied up by our history books with titles like ""Ama ng Wikang Pambansa"
Quezon,1846,11,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,""" His methods are the reason why Filipinos today are so swept up by populist and charismatic leaders"
Quezon,1846,12,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,"Whether we like it or not, his methods paved the way for the dominance of ""trapos"" in our Senate today"
Quezon,1846,13,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,"On the other hand, I feel like the lack of subtlety did remove the nuances and gray areas that I was looking for in a take like this"
Quezon,1846,14,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,It does become just a fight between good and evil in some parts
Quezon,1846,15,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,"For one, I did not understand the choice of glazing over Aguinaldo in this when even he lead a regime built upon manipulation"
Quezon,1846,16,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,Felt like Tarog retracted from his stance against Aguinaldo in Heneral Luna where he was heavily villainized (deservedly so) in that third act
Quezon,1846,17,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,I also wanted more nuance with its take on Quezon himself
Quezon,1846,18,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,He was quite the showman who shifted his principles and narratives when it's convenient for him
Quezon,1846,19,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,I guess I just wanted more moments of self awareness and reckoning from him
Quezon,1846,20,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,Him being an egotistical maniac just felt a bit too clean and clear cut

Quezon,1846,25,cjshua,,160.0,ltbx,I ultimately do think this is a national hero biopic that we deserve right now as a nation

Quezon,1866,1,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,“a house divided against itself must fall” its been a few hours since i’ve seen this film because i want to digest everything that i can from the film before writing a review
Quezon,1866,2,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,i haven’t seen the previous films in such a long time but i do think this is the best one from bayaniverse
Quezon,1866,3,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,this has been one of my most anticipated films this year and man it did not disappoint
Quezon,1866,4,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,since i saw the trailer i knew it was promising and seeing it today i can honestly say that it exceeded my expectations
Quezon,1866,5,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,i love that the movie didn't shy away from criticizing quezon and showing us exactly who he really is
Quezon,1866,6,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,unlike the books from school that made him look like a great man the way it did with that propaganda movie that nadia made for his presidential campaign
Quezon,1866,7,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,when it comes to history talaga you really do have to read more than what they teach you from school (and its books) because if you haven’t i think people would've been so shocked at how disgusting and evil quezon is
Quezon,1866,8,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"quezon is exactly the reason why we have the type of politicians we have now, it started with him and it’ll continue to infiltrate the government as years goes by if we don’t do anything about it"
Quezon,1866,9,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"a chameleon who changes its skin with every person he interacts with, even his own wife and friends to reap its benefits"
Quezon,1866,10,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"to quezon the country is just a game to be played with and as long as it makes him look good and he comes out at the top he will continue to play that game until his last breath, hence, “I am the Philippines”"
Quezon,1866,11,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"incredible incredible acting performance from every single actors in this cast especially jericho rosales who is undoubtedly the stand out, he really reminded everyone how great of an actor he is wow"
Quezon,1866,12,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"other than jericho of course, we also have mon confiado, romnick sarmenta, cris villanueva, and benjamin alves who stood out as well but lets not forget the women who supported this actors"
Quezon,1866,13,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"karylle, ana abad santos, and angeli agbayani who wasn’t able to do much or even say much but you can feel and see everything that theyre feeling in their face, and especially their eyes, the subtleties of it all made such a huge impact"
Quezon,1866,14,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"although i do wish that we were able to hear from them more, to know about their thoughts and feelings, to ser them more than as the wives of these men"
Quezon,1866,15,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,especially with aurora who stuck by him and so loyal to him till the very end despite him being an unloyal douchebag
Quezon,1866,16,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"the film is so creative as well, its like watching a movie within a movie"
Quezon,1866,17,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"the cinematography is so so so beautiful, theres this specific shot towards the end —kudos to the editing as well i got goosebumps with the back and forth between quezon and aguinaldo doing their campaign and its contrast— where they were calling aguinaldo a traitor, such a good fucking shot wow"
Quezon,1866,18,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,sound design and production design are undoubtedly incredible as well
Quezon,1866,19,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,i do think theres still so much to say about this film but i think this is all i got for today

Quezon,1880,2,ayuutaoz,,140.0,ltbx,The color grading was unexpected for a film that tackled the Philippine Commonwealth
Quezon,1880,3,ayuutaoz,,140.0,ltbx,"It felt off, almost too modern for the time period it was supposed to capture"
Quezon,1880,4,ayuutaoz,,140.0,ltbx,"The play on jazz tried to reflect how playful and full of tricks Quezon was, but it ended up feeling out of place rather than symbolic"
Quezon,1880,5,ayuutaoz,,140.0,ltbx,"Watching it with the expectation that it would have the same weight or sharpness as Goyo or General Luna, medyo wala siyang dating"
Quezon,1880,6,ayuutaoz,,140.0,ltbx,"It lacked the same power, emotion, and impact those films delivered"
Quezon,1880,7,ayuutaoz,,140.0,ltbx,"The storyline and its modern approach made a few interesting points, but overall, it felt just okay"
Quezon,1880,8,ayuutaoz,,140.0,ltbx,The movie leaned in on how the Philippine press was going against the idea of too much “idealism” and not enough on honesty
Quezon,1880,9,ayuutaoz,,140.0,ltbx,"The Philippines has always had issues with its government, and the film, while trying to shed light on a heroic act, missed the chance to question the systems and attitudes that kept those issues alive"
Quezon,1880,10,ayuutaoz,,140.0,ltbx,"Since the beginning, it’s always been about finding leaders who are good enough—but sometimes, films like this forget that good enough isn’t the same as good"

Quezon,1882,2,soylemonade,,160.0,ltbx,"i guess i just got used to the dramatic and mystery/thriller approach of the first two movies, which Quezon didn't really have"
Quezon,1882,3,soylemonade,,160.0,ltbx,the movie honestly had its moments and it amazes me how relevant it is today — reminding you that not much has changed regarding our government and the politicians running for office
Quezon,1882,4,soylemonade,,160.0,ltbx,"they're just playing the same games over and over, and yet, Filipinos will always fall for it"
Quezon,1882,5,soylemonade,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales did a great job as Quezon, but it was Romnick Sarmienta's performance as Osmeña that really stood out for me"

Quezon,1887,6,joseavelinomrts,,180.0,ltbx,"Of course, Jericho Rosales portrayed the former President Quezon remarkably"
Quezon,1887,7,joseavelinomrts,,180.0,ltbx,His accent and mannerism was so animated and persuasive
Quezon,1887,8,joseavelinomrts,,180.0,ltbx,But Mon Confiado’s iconic performance as Aguinaldo was my favorite

Quezon,1887,10,joseavelinomrts,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon serves as a stark reminder about the disheartening loop of our so-called “democracy” filled with figures vying for power using schemes and tricks
Quezon,1887,11,joseavelinomrts,,180.0,ltbx,"Sad to see that after 100 years, this has been our case — being a politician all boils down to the ability to sway the public’s opinion to one’s side with the incompetency to serve"

Quezon,1922,2,pinathbutter,,160.0,ltbx,"That being said, I'm a huge fan of the first two entries and the concept of this franchise as a whole"
Quezon,1922,3,pinathbutter,,160.0,ltbx,It's always interesting to me when films or any form of media provide a deconstruction and humanization of historical figures who are otherwise just names in our minds carved by our history lessons
Quezon,1922,4,pinathbutter,,160.0,ltbx,"With this kind of movies, our heroes become flawed men, far from the shallow descriptions in lectures and closer to the people in power currently governing our countries"

Quezon,1926,1,cinegela,,140.0,ltbx,"Characterized by its witty nature compared to its bloodier and action-filled predecessors, Quezon is successful in portraying the life of a complex historical figure with a seemingly one-track power hungry mind"
Quezon,1926,2,cinegela,,140.0,ltbx,"That being said, the script is entertaining as it portrays the gift of the gab that might actually happen in political infighting"
Quezon,1926,3,cinegela,,140.0,ltbx,Interesting to see how such a celebrated person in history books is actually the blueprint for patronage politics in the Philippines that has led the country to its current convoluted state today

Quezon,1934,4,miloouu,,200.0,ltbx,"the film's storytelling is non-linear, so makikita mo sa una na nanalo si Quezon as President (makikita mo na agad kung paano siya maglaro ng politika sa opening scene pa lang), then cut to Aguinaldo, stating na he's been cheated with (sa una akala mo sore loser lang si aguinaldo), then as the film progress, we sympathize with Aguinalado more than Quezon, with how the latter is manipulative and ruthless with his politics, na para bang si Quezon ang antagonist sa sarili niyang biopic"
Quezon,1934,5,miloouu,,200.0,ltbx,"i just want to applaud the filmmakers by showing the relevant social issues of our country within a historical context, at the cost of creative liberties (tangina di ko talaga inexpect si Janolino kahit nagpakita siya sa trailer)"

Quezon,1934,7,miloouu,,200.0,ltbx,"the ending just gives me chills, like makikita mo talaga na concerned si Osmeña sa kalagayan ni Quezon, but yung outburst ni Quezon made me re-think about the popular line ""I am the Philippines"" of Quezon"
Quezon,1934,8,miloouu,,200.0,ltbx,"Pinapalakas ng pelikulang toh ang pag-kwestyon ko sa motibo ng iba't-ibang politiko natin ngayon, and sa tingin ko yun din naman ang gusto ipahayag ng mga filmmakers nito"

Quezon,1935,1,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"This is by far the weakest installment in Tarog's Bayaniverse, and yet a strong start for an ""experimental screenplay"" by the director"
Quezon,1935,2,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"Tarog isn’t just known for his heroic-themed films but also for horror works like Shake, Rattle & Roll"
Quezon,1935,3,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"This time, however, it's different"
Quezon,1935,4,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,He used plenty of comedic acts—so much that I almost forgot the film was a drama—which made it feel very unconventional and rare for him to explore such an approach
Quezon,1935,5,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"Still, he was clever and creative for going unorthodox, especially since the film revolves around sheer politics"
Quezon,1935,6,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,It was dense with overwhelming dialogue
Quezon,1935,7,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"Perhaps he decided to use comedy to maintain the audience’s attentiveness, as casual moviegoers tend to have short attention spans and might easily doze off"
Quezon,1935,8,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"I think it was intentional, and he just saved his cinema from a bland, dull, and boring screenplay"
Quezon,1935,9,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"As for the main character, Jericho Rosales did excellently in this film"
Quezon,1935,10,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,He gave an astounding performance as Quezon—enough to provoke the audience’s emotions
Quezon,1935,11,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"The mannerisms, gestures, and expressions were on point"
Quezon,1935,12,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"However, I believe there might still be another actor who could’ve portrayed Quezon better, as there were scenes where the acting felt somewhat unnatural, as if he was ""acting an acting"

Quezon,1935,14,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"From Luna to Goyo to Quezon, the consistency is just commendable"
Quezon,1935,15,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"In addition, I really loved Tarog's uniqueness with his cinematic strategies on how he delivered the story of Quezon, plus the coin as an allegory, which is something I couldn’t explain in detail because it’s better if you watch it on the big screen"
Quezon,1935,16,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"I still have a lot in mind, but I wish I were that diligent to write it all down"
Quezon,1935,17,justyfyd,,140.0,ltbx,"Anyway, this film is rated as a standalone piece, not part of the trilogy when the first two are taken into account"

Quezon,1953,1,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,Alam naman natin na may katiwalian sa pamahalaan dahil sa pamumulitika at sa pangingibabaw ng sariling interes kaysa maglingkod para sa kapakanan ng bayan
Quezon,1953,2,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,Nandiyan ang pork barrel scam noon at ang anomalya sa flood control projects ngayon
Quezon,1953,3,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,Pero bakit nga ba paulit-ulit natin sila binoboto
Quezon,1953,4,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,"Sa panulat at direksiyon ni Jerrold Tarog, isa itong historical drama na tumatalakay sa buhay ng kinikilalang ikalawalang pangulo ng bansa na si Manuel Luis Quezon (Jericho Rosales) at kung paano niya nilaro ang politika"
Quezon,1953,5,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,"Ito ang pangatlo sa Bayaniverse ng nasabing direktor, una ang ""Heneral Luna"" (2015) at ikalawa ang ""Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral"" (2018)"
Quezon,1953,6,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,"Sa higit na dalawang oras na takbo ng pelikula na puro diyalogo, napanatili nito ang aking interes dahil sa kakaibang direksiyon nito"
Quezon,1953,7,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,"Bukod sa paglalagay kay Joven Hernando (Cris Villanueva at Aaron Villaflor), nakatulong dito ang satirikong tono nito sa halip na isalaysay lamang ito nang tuwiran na makikita sa naunang dalawang pelikula"
Quezon,1953,8,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,"Nakatatawa na nga ang mga eksena, malalaman at maiuugnay mo pa ang mga patutsada sa kasalukuyang lagay ng politika sa bansa o sa sinumang politiko"

Quezon,1953,11,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,"Ayon nga sa nalaman ko sa nadaluhang online seminar workshop para sa mga mag-aaral na mamamahayag at tagapayo ng pahayagang pampaaralan, walang obhetibo sa pamamahayag dahil may pinipiling anggulo ang tagapagbalita kaya mahalaga na maging mapanagutan at mapanuri sa isisiwalat tungo sa paghulma ng isipan at boses ng sambayanan"
Quezon,1953,12,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,"Kung patuloy na mas nagbibigay ng atensiyon ang mainstream na midya sa mga walang kawawaang paandar ng ilang opisyal, bago man o beterano, kaysa sa mga napapanahong isyu at adbokasiya, hindi na nakagugulat kapag nanalo ang mga ito kung sakaling tumakbo ito sa mas mataas na posisyon"
Quezon,1953,13,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,Kitang-kita ito sa pelikula sa tulong ni Joven Hernando at ng kaniyang anak na si Nadya

Quezon,1953,23,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,Nakapag-ambag din ang musika at tunog sa tono nito

Quezon,1953,25,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,Batid nga natin na may kanser sa ating lipunan ngunit bakit ba natin pinipili pa rin ang mga trapo
Quezon,1953,26,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,Dahil sila at sila pa rin naman ang tatakbo
Quezon,1953,27,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,Dahil kilala ang apelyido nila at may malawak na makinarya sa pangangampanya kaya naniniwala tayo na sila ang magpapaunlad sa atin
Quezon,1953,28,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,O dahil naging kuntento na lamang tayo sa paniniwala na kurakot naman silang lahat
Quezon,1953,29,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,"Hindi man namamalayan ng karamihan ngunit may paniniwala na may ambag ang ""Heneral Luna"" sa kaisipan na ayos lamang na may palamurang pinuno"
Quezon,1953,30,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,"Sa ""Quezon"", nangangamba ako na baka ang mapulot lamang ng karamihan ay iboto na lang ang kahit na sino dahil tiwali rin naman silang lahat"
Quezon,1953,31,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,Hetong Bayaniverse ang magsilbing paalala sa atin na huwag makuntento sa natatamasang kaginhawaan ngayon (kung mayroon man dahil sa mga pribilehiyo) sapagkat mas karapat-dapat pa na matamo natin ang tunay na mabuting pamumuno
Quezon,1953,32,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,Huwag tayong sumamba sa mga opisyal at pumanig sa kapuwa mamamayan
Quezon,1953,33,azuregq,,160.0,ltbx,Maging mapanuri at manawagan tayo sa mga pinuno dahil ito ang ating gampanin bilang kanilang nasasakupan na nakararanas ng mga pagpapasiya nila sa pamamalakad sa bansa

Quezon,1959,3,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,the unmasking of quezon in the intensity that they did was not how i thought this film would go (complementary)
Quezon,1959,4,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,luna asked “bayan o sarili” and quezon managed to answer “both”
Quezon,1959,5,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,this film was so heavy knowing we  are  still  frikin  here  almost a hundred years later (probably in an even worse shithole)

Quezon,1959,7,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,"(parang endemic na sila atp) and for us non-reptilians, are we complicit in the ecosystem we live in"
Quezon,1959,8,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,i read a review somewhere where they said this film is nothing but a mirror and tells us what we already know
Quezon,1959,9,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,but you know what
Quezon,1959,10,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,WE FILIPINOS ARE HARD HEADED
Quezon,1959,11,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,we forgive and forget like its breathing when we often shouldn’t
Quezon,1959,12,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,"so yes, we do need this mirror up every single day until we learn"
Quezon,1959,13,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,we can’t also expect this film to give us a solution to our recurrent (if not perpetual) problem
Quezon,1959,14,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,it being a mirror does not reduce its value in asking us what we want to do when we don’t like what we see in the looking glass
Quezon,1959,15,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,this installment of the trilogy finally made me un-demonize aguinaldo
Quezon,1959,16,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,he’s still shit but he isn’t the devil incarnate
Quezon,1959,17,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,"just as we examine the meaning of “bayani”, we also get to examine those who have fallen from grace"
Quezon,1959,18,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,mon confiado proves why he is el presidente in capturing the complexities of the man
Quezon,1959,19,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,echo truly did the role justice with the way he became a chameleon
Quezon,1959,20,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,i love the focus on this aspect of quezon especially when irl there have been 3 actors in the bayaniverse to play quezon (long live the quezon multiverse
Quezon,1959,22,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,he will act and (literally) look different depending on his audience and what he can gain from them
Quezon,1959,23,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,this is why i don’t think we actually see the real quezon in each of these scenes
Quezon,1959,24,simpatiko,,180.0,ltbx,they’re all an act

Quezon,1962,1,jmvpscl,,180.0,ltbx,"‘Quezon’ challenges its viewers to step back and critically re-examine their views on heroism, nationalism, and leadership from a moral compass by projecting a character that once stood at the cusp of burgeoning pressure for independence by opposing Filipino revolutionary and American imperialist fronts"
Quezon,1962,2,jmvpscl,,180.0,ltbx,"Although the film still embodies the overarching themes of its predecessors, Quezon’s most notable feature was finally cementing Joven into the “bayaniverse” (or more accurately, the “Aguinaldo Trilogy”) not just as a mere spectator or narrator, but as a key and active player in Tarrog’s world — a powerful symbol resembling the Filipinos’ evolving compromises and complicity amid the turbulent socio-political landscape of the time"
Quezon,1962,3,jmvpscl,,180.0,ltbx,"An essential spin on a familiar trope, Quezon is by far the most comprehensive de-construction of “what makes a hero” in Tarrog’s roster of historical epics"
Quezon,1962,4,jmvpscl,,180.0,ltbx,"A must watch for the incredible performances, especially from Echo and Mon"

Quezon,1966,2,alxxstphn,,160.0,ltbx,” and got away with it
Quezon,1967,1,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"If it's not yet apparent by now, Jerrold Tarog is on a mission to strip our heroes of their reverence and enigma, and in the third installment of the ""Bayaniverse,"" he focuses on a war of a different kind --- a war waged not with bullets and bayonets but words and propaganda"
Quezon,1967,2,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"As a political drama, ""Quezon"" is a nailbiter"
Quezon,1967,3,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"There is enough history lesson here to make one revisit old textbooks, and some of the issues surrounding the larger-than-life Manuel Luis Quezon are brought to light"
Quezon,1967,4,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,My only gripe with this is that the script does very little to nothing with the issues presented
Quezon,1967,5,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,The film is only concerned with exposing MLQ as a flawed man --- perhaps as a reflection of the current Filipino politician who will do whatever it takes to amass power
Quezon,1967,6,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,I also found the portrayal of Aurora Quezon (Karylle) a little jarring
Quezon,1967,7,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"While there was an intention to highlight the immense potential of women to shape society (as with Therese Malvar's fimmaker character), Aurora on the other hand is given almost nothing to do but be a sounding to board to her husband (Jericho Rosales)"
Quezon,1967,8,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"In one climactic scene, where Quezon's secrets are thretatened to be exposed, the camera cuts to Aurora for a reaction shot --- and then nothing"
Quezon,1967,9,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"The issue would no longer be discussed for the remainder of the film, and we never really see how Aurora views her husband in light of his duties as a husband, a father, a politician, and as a leader of a nation"
Quezon,1967,10,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"The film also commits several sins of omission, including the portrayal of Leonard Wood as a mere bureaucrat, completely neglecting his involvement in the Bud Dajo Massacre in 1906"
Quezon,1967,11,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"Nevertheless, the ensemble piece features several noteworthy performances, led, of course by Rosales as Quezon, Benjamin Alves as the younger Quezon, Mon Confiado, who will forever be associated with the Emilio Aguinaldo role, Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña, Cris Villanueva as an older Joven Hernando (a fictional character used to bridge the three films) and Iain Glen as Leonard Wood"
Quezon,1967,12,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"Of the films in this trilogy, Aguinaldo gets the most interesting story arc in ""Quezon,"" as do Joven"
Quezon,1967,13,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"The humor, too is at par with the best bits from ""Heneral Luna,"" which is fitting I guess because what is politics in the Philippines but a big farcical extravaganza"
Quezon,1967,14,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"Something to commend here as well is the film's use of the silent film era to portray Quezon's rise to power, leveraging the power of images to form (or better yet, manipulate) public opinion"
Quezon,1967,15,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"As ""Quezon"" takes place during the rise of cinematic consciousness around the world, it is nice to hear Murnau, Fritz Lang, Nepomuceno, and Harris and Tait mentioned in the same breath as the country's exodus towards independence from American rule"
Quezon,1967,16,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"One thing I missed here was Epy Quizon's calming voice of reason as Apolinario Mabini, but by this timeline, Mabini is already dead (he died in 1903)"
Quezon,1967,17,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,Perhaps a voiceiver from the dead
Quezon,1967,18,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,Perhaps not
Quezon,1967,19,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"In closing, is ""Quezon"" a perfect film"
Quezon,1967,20,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"Like the person it portrays, it is far from perfection"
Quezon,1967,21,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,But is it provocative
Quezon,1967,22,californiamacky,,120.0,ltbx,"Does it invite dialogue and introspection into our complicated history with truth, idolatry, and the persistence of patronage politics"

Quezon,1971,1,oliverrusta,,140.0,ltbx,Great theme but bad dialogue script with other character except MLQ
Quezon,1972,1,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"written and directed with precision by tarrog, quezon is an entertaining and smart depiction of history's manchilds and the ""heroic"" games they play for the ""independence"" of the nation"
Quezon,1972,2,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"its double-edged sword, however, is its effectivity in critiquing and being propaganda"
Quezon,1972,3,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"while it critiques film as the very medium for this ideological and calculated systemic myth-making (we are rooting for comrade nadia), it also falls under this trap by centering narratives on the humanity of history's people with less attention to the bigger powers in play that hold the strings to these figures"
Quezon,1972,4,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"by focusing on quezon’s child's play hiding over his performed wit and individual brilliance, the film risks personalizing what is, at its core, a systemic issue: that philippine politics has always been a performance crafted under the watchful eye of american imperialism"
Quezon,1972,5,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"politicians will choose their ideological stance based on available choices, independence is highlighted as the goal of the masses who is alienated by its very language, and in every six years, we will be given choices for leaders who will never trully represent us"
Quezon,1972,6,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"the film eventually reveals this control, but the critique is softened, overshadowed by the dramatized rivalry between the opportunist quezon and leonard wood, and other names in history"
Quezon,1972,7,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"the bigger villain, the structure that rewards political ego and molds philippine politics and elections to all be a game, remains unscathed"
Quezon,1972,8,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,it is named
Quezon,1972,9,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"but it seems like right now, like quezon, we end up turning toward the nearest villains — within reach, within us"

Quezon,1978,1,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,Been looking forward to this film forever
Quezon,1978,2,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,It’s one of those films in PH cinema that really stands out and feels well-invested
Quezon,1978,3,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,"The cinematography was excellent, the sound was even better, and I have to say, the nuances of Osmeña and Quezon were portrayed accurately"
Quezon,1978,4,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,"The script was well writtenI especially loved how they showed Quezon’s lobbying skills, how he hinted, persuaded, and almost fed the egos of the members of the House and the Senate"
Quezon,1978,5,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,It was both fascinating and nauseating to see how power was exchanged and traded so openly
Quezon,1978,6,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,"It leaves you wondering whether this film makes you feel more hopeless and jaded, or simply resigned to the fact that you’re seeing the same things happen again & that none of it really surprises you anymoreAfter watching Luna before, I was left with frustration"
Quezon,1978,7,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,"Then came Goyo, which didn’t really resonate with me"
Quezon,1978,8,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,"But this one, this one did"
Quezon,1978,9,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,I had been wondering how they would approach Quezon’s story
Quezon,1978,10,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,"There’s been so much written about him, but I love how the film showed his showmanship, his dirty politics, and how he practically set the precedent for how politics are still played"
Quezon,1978,11,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,"manipulative, strategic, and all at onceAnd while this is a biopic, I think cinema about history should be done this way"
Quezon,1978,12,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,"If Goyo felt subpar compared to Luna in terms of cinematic and entertainment value, Quezon was endearing and powerful It makes you think, if politics were already that dirty back then, how much worse is it now, when people don’t even hide their corruption and proudly brand themselves as “noble” while stealing the people’s money"
Quezon,1978,13,enelra21,,200.0,ltbx,For sure Quezon played his cards wellAnd Jericho and Romneck definitely deserve awards for their performances
Quezon,1979,1,gilayuyao,,160.0,ltbx,One thing is constantFilipino politicians are assholes
Quezon,1980,1,fiasco001,,140.0,ltbx,pretty great deconstruction of quezon as a politician
Quezon,1980,2,fiasco001,,140.0,ltbx,further solidifies my thought that there really is no hope for philippine politics after all
Quezon,1981,1,gelmerillo,,160.0,ltbx,2+ hours of politicians being insufferable scheming hypocrites and liars
Quezon,1981,2,gelmerillo,,160.0,ltbx,"Strong messaging and great acting overall, but it still had to rely on lengthy dialogue and monologues to get the important message across instead of only letting the characters' actions speak"
Quezon,1981,3,gelmerillo,,160.0,ltbx,"It's not hard to excuse, given how Heneral Luna was often used by DDS to draw positive parallels between Duterte and the general"
Quezon,1981,4,gelmerillo,,160.0,ltbx,"My tiny nitpick: the lines sometimes sound too modern, especially Nadia's"
Quezon,1982,1,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,"if history were a movie, Quezon would be the scene where the lights stay on too long where the glamour fades and all that’s left is the politics, the pride, and the people pretending not to notice the cracks"
Quezon,1982,2,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,"i went in expecting something noble, something textbook"
Quezon,1982,3,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,but what i got felt… human
Quezon,1982,4,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,painfully human
Quezon,1982,5,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,"quezon (jericho rosales, absolutely magnetic) isn’t painted as a saint here he’s ambitious, clever, exhausted, and aware that being “good” doesn’t always win you the game"
Quezon,1982,6,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,"it’s that messy, moral middle ground where idealism meets ego, and somehow that felt more honest than any patriotic speech ever could"
Quezon,1982,7,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,and then there’s aguinaldo
Quezon,1982,8,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,he’s not the villain not really
Quezon,1982,9,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,he’s just another man trying to keep his version of the world alive
Quezon,1982,10,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,"it’s poetic in this haunting way that the movie reminds us: he was supposed to die early, yet outlived everyone"
Quezon,1982,13,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,the whole lineup
Quezon,1982,14,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,and that irony
Quezon,1982,15,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,it stings
Quezon,1982,16,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,like history laughing quietly in the background
Quezon,1982,17,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,"but what hit me hardest was how quezon shows corruption not as an event, but as a tradition"
Quezon,1982,18,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,it’s not a scandal that shows up one day it’s baked into the foundation
Quezon,1982,19,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,"this movie doesn’t even need to say it outright; you just feel it in every handshake, every campaign promise, every smile that lasts one second too long"
Quezon,1982,20,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,"by the end, i wasn’t just watching a historical biopic it felt like a loop"
Quezon,1982,21,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,like we’ve been here before
Quezon,1982,22,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,"same speeches, different microphones"
Quezon,1982,23,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,"same dreams, slightly more polished lies"
Quezon,1982,24,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon isn’t perfect, but maybe that’s what makes it hit"
Quezon,1982,25,mischkalicouss,,180.0,ltbx,it’s hopeful and heavy at the same time like loving a country that keeps breaking your heart but you can’t walk away because it’s yours
Quezon,1983,1,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"If there’s an alamat of the pagiging Pinoy TraPo, maybe this is it"
Quezon,1983,2,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,the origin story of politics as performance
Quezon,1983,3,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"(just for show, performative politicians )"
Quezon,1983,4,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"""Masyadong maraming pulitiko sa bansa, kakaunti lamang ang mga lingkod-bayan"
Quezon,1983,5,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"""I hate history classes, but I love revisiting history through travel, museums, and movies"
Quezon,1983,6,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,Quezon (2025) is exactly the kind of film that makes history come alive
Quezon,1983,7,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,even for those who never liked it
Quezon,1983,8,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"It’s funny, sharp, and feels like a political satire about the past that mirrors the present"
Quezon,1983,9,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,The film follows former President Manuel L
Quezon,1983,10,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon’s political rise and how he played the game of politics brilliantly, but not always cleanly"
Quezon,1983,11,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"If there’s an alamat of the Pinoy trapo, maybe this is it -- the origin story of politics as performance (just for show)"
Quezon,1983,12,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales nailed the role of Manuel L
Quezon,1983,14,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"I’ve seen clips of the real Quezon before, and every time Rosales spoke, it felt like I was hearing the late president himself"
Quezon,1983,15,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"They don’t even look alike, but he captured Quezon’s spirit perfectly"
Quezon,1983,16,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Benjamin Alves, who played the younger Quezon in the silent film sequences, also impressed me"
Quezon,1983,17,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,Alves could easily carry the role in a full-length version too
Quezon,1983,18,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,Supporting actors also deserve credit
Quezon,1983,19,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,Romnick Sarmenta (as Osmeña) complements Rosales well
Quezon,1983,20,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Karylle, as Aurora Quezon, was charming but underutilized, perhaps reflecting how women were sidelined back then"
Quezon,1983,21,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"In contrast, Angeli Bayani, playing Aguinaldo’s wife, had limited screen time but left a strong impression"
Quezon,1983,22,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Mon Confiado’s take on Aguinaldo was refreshing, showing a more vulnerable side (though I still have to see the other movies in the Bayaniverse)"
Quezon,1983,23,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Arron Villaflor and Cris Agustin, as Joven Hernando, were remarkable too,you almost forget they’re fictional characters"
Quezon,1983,24,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Though a biopic, the movie plays like a satire"
Quezon,1983,25,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"It’s unserious but smartly so funny, biting, and painfully familiar"
Quezon,1983,26,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,The humor lands because the parallels with today’s politics are impossible to ignore
Quezon,1983,27,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Everything feels like ""pang front lang"" and the nation’s welfare often comes second to pride and image"
Quezon,1983,28,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"As I said, it might just be the origin story of the Pinoy trapos"
Quezon,1983,29,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Maybe Quezon didn’t invent dirty politics but as Joven Hernando puts it, he perfected the game"
Quezon,1983,30,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"By the end, you’ll find yourself asking: What does independence (independencia) really mean"
Quezon,1983,31,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Are we truly free, or have we simply learned to believe we are"
Quezon,1983,32,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Maybe it’s like Plato’s “noble lie”, a story told to keep people hopeful, obedient, and proud"
Quezon,1983,33,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Tayong mga Pilipino, ika nga ni Romnick Sarmenta bilang si Osmeña, “hindi naman tayo kulangot, pero bakit tayo binibilog"
Quezon,1983,34,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"”Maybe it’s because we love beautiful stories, stories that let us escape, even when they blur the line between truth and illusion"
Quezon,1983,35,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,Kailan kaya tayo tunay na lalaya mula sa mga politikong inuuna ang sarili bago ang sambayanan
Quezon,1983,36,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,at ’yun na nga
Quezon,1983,37,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,nabilog na kc tayo
Quezon,1983,38,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,"Marahil, just like being a hero, independencia is often just a matter of perception"
Quezon,1983,39,moviecatts,,140.0,ltbx,(i am just wondering how Quezon's descendants would react to this movie)
Quezon,1984,1,nerozeus_,,200.0,ltbx,Jericho villain era HAHAHA tells the origin story of everything that is wrong with PH politics
Quezon,1985,1,zaccarius317,,180.0,ltbx,manalo u cheeky bastard
Quezon,1986,1,paulopelikula,,160.0,ltbx,"there’s a playfulness in how scenes are shot and directed which feels so appropriate because to Quezon, it’s always been a game and he always wanted to win"
Quezon,1987,1,maika1998,,140.0,ltbx,ser jorah mormont niyo namatay sa stress

Quezon,1991,3,tcoe197,,160.0,ltbx,I am sure that how Filipinos view him will change after they see this film
Quezon,1991,4,tcoe197,,160.0,ltbx,"It exposes how most of the faults of our system and the way our government behaves, are indirectly tied to Quezon and his politicking"

Quezon,1993,7,suprapat,,160.0,ltbx,"Among the 3 Bayaniverse movies, the storytelling format of Quezon is what I enjoyed the most"
Quezon,1993,8,suprapat,,160.0,ltbx,"Since MLQ is more of a political figure rather than a wartime hero, there were more interior scenes rather than landscape wide shots (which I loved from its 2 predecessors -- Heneral Luna & Goyo)"
Quezon,1993,9,suprapat,,160.0,ltbx,"Still, it felt like they're in a battlefield where one must fight in order to survive"
Quezon,1993,10,suprapat,,160.0,ltbx,"Kudos to all the creatives behind this, for always using their art to disturb us, the comfortable masses"
Quezon,1993,11,suprapat,,160.0,ltbx,"Madaling makalimot tayong mga Pilipino, at napakadali nating maniwala sa pangako ng pag-asa"
Quezon,1993,12,suprapat,,160.0,ltbx,"As painful as it may be, pero baka nga hindi pa tayo handa sa independencia -- until now most people don't even know what that word means"
Quezon,1993,13,suprapat,,160.0,ltbx,"Or maybe, we were never really truly independent because we never had the chance"
Quezon,1993,14,suprapat,,160.0,ltbx,"I didn't know one could feel hopeful and hopeless at the same time, but right now this is our reality, and the longer we let ourselves be run by the likes of Quezon, the further we are from having true independencia"

Quezon,2023,4,wandamqximoff,,180.0,ltbx,it’s crazy how these films continue to be a reflection of the past yet mirror current events in ways that are scarily familiar
Quezon,2023,5,wandamqximoff,,180.0,ltbx,timing of this release couldn’t be more perfect
Quezon,2024,1,ejrosie,,160.0,ltbx,"This film looks like it is in the point of view in a journalist's eye, in the media"

Quezon,2027,6,eli_wntryngs,,180.0,ltbx,i barely recognized jericho rosales as manuel quezon
Quezon,2027,7,eli_wntryngs,,180.0,ltbx,"now i don't know if quezon's mannerisms is really like how the actor portrayed it in the movie, but i have no doubt that he gave time and effort to understand the role he's playing—evident in his superb acting skills which i did not expect"
Quezon,2027,8,eli_wntryngs,,180.0,ltbx,"plus that insane, note-worthy, cinematography moment as aguinaldo walks to the stage whilst quezon comes down and they cross paths and the subtle way quezon ALWAYS tries to read the room"

Quezon,2030,1,kristxana,,200.0,ltbx,guys before i give my review i just wanna brag that jericho rosales came to our screening and literally spoke in front of my seat and i was able to give him a handshake
Quezon,2030,2,kristxana,,200.0,ltbx,ok now to the actual review:Jerold Tarrog’s vision for the Bayaniverse is just commendable
Quezon,2030,3,kristxana,,200.0,ltbx,this was by far my favorite from the franchise– from the storytelling down to the cinematography
Quezon,2030,4,kristxana,,200.0,ltbx,"the creative decision of telling the contrasting story of Quezon through the silent films was chef’s kiss– it was unique, entertaining, and well crafted"
Quezon,2030,5,kristxana,,200.0,ltbx,this was a good contrast to the benevolent portrayal of Quezon in Quezon’s Game
Quezon,2030,6,kristxana,,200.0,ltbx,I only knew of Quezon’s political impact to the extent of Jones Law and Tydings-Mcduffie Act
Quezon,2030,7,kristxana,,200.0,ltbx,"I didn’t realize that he was this messy or more so, vilanous in his peculiar ways"
Quezon,2030,8,kristxana,,200.0,ltbx,it’s unsettling how he essentially became the pioneer to the kind of politics that still persists to this day
Quezon,2030,9,kristxana,,200.0,ltbx,he said “i prefer a government run like hell by Filipinos” and that’s all we heard from that statement

Quezon,2039,2,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,i greatly enjoyed this film

Quezon,2039,11,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,jericho rosales did a fantastic job
Quezon,2039,12,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,i think it's about time to give filipino actors a chance
Quezon,2039,14,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,i appreciate the stance of joven in this movie
Quezon,2039,15,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,"his character embodied what it meant to only see one side, to only want to see one side"
Quezon,2039,16,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,it highlighted the importance of understanding bias and what it truly means to be a citizen—to weigh both sides and to pick the lesser evil
Quezon,2039,18,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,oh emilio aguinaldo you morally grey silly goose
Quezon,2039,19,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,i think the switch of aguinaldo's characterization here greatly emphasizes that things are not black and white
Quezon,2039,20,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,"things are not simply good and bad, evil and pure"
Quezon,2039,21,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,"human as we are, our actions are multiple colors"
Quezon,2039,22,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,aguinaldo is an example of that
Quezon,2039,23,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,i want to praise mon confiado for being exemplary
Quezon,2039,24,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,"it takes incredible skill to have his character be hated on the first two movies, and be pitied in the next"

Quezon,2039,41,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,"i so so appreciate the film emphasizing the importance of art and how it can directly influence people's views and opinions about certain topics, nuances, and even people"
Quezon,2039,42,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,art is the driving force
Quezon,2039,43,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,art is just as important
Quezon,2039,44,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,"and in this modern world where we see art as less, let us be reminded that the beauty of art is the power of human race"
Quezon,2039,45,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,history is important
Quezon,2039,46,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,we must continue to learn our past so that we are able to unlearn and re-learn
Quezon,2039,47,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,history is not just the past but the guide to our future

Quezon,2039,51,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,"kaya, now's the time to write the narrative that the future will live"
Quezon,2039,52,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,"ika nga nila, history repeats itself, diba"
Quezon,2039,53,faelvr,,180.0,ltbx,"mamulat, makibahagi, makiboses"
Quezon,2040,1,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"A decade ago, Jerrold Tarog asked the Filipino audience what it really meant to be a hero"
Quezon,2040,2,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"With his Bayaniverse, he aimed to deconstruct the heroes that we've come to know during our history lessons as kids"
Quezon,2040,3,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"In Heneral Luna (2015), he showed us the fiery and passionate patriotism that is willing to do anything to protect our freedom"
Quezon,2040,4,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"It introduces the idea of mythmaking, as it positions the entire Philippine–American War into the hands of its protagonist, and by killing off the only person who could have led us to victory, the government simply proved that our biggest enemy was not the Americans but our own Filipino countrymen—ourselves"
Quezon,2040,5,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2018) breaks this down further, showing us that the hero we glorified all this time was nothing more than a blind fanatic who died a futile death out of his arrogance and lack of experience—all this time, all he had to offer was this confidence and loyalty to his president, and nothing more"
Quezon,2040,6,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,Then came 2025's Quezon
Quezon,2040,7,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"As he states in the film:""Ang pagkabayani—it's all about perception"" (Being a hero—it's all about perception)"
Quezon,2040,8,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,Becoming the hero means you get to decide whose story gets to be told and how it is told
Quezon,2040,9,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"In this third and final installment of Tarog's Bayaniverse, we follow the life of Manuel L"
Quezon,2040,10,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon (Jericho Rosales), who would go on and become the first Filipino elected to head a government of the entire Philippines after 34 years of being governed by American governor generals"
Quezon,2040,11,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"All throughout the film, we see him in different stages of his life through different chapters, depicting how he manipulates his way from the bottom to the top, including his conflicted relationships with Sergio Osmeña (Romnick Sarmenta), governor-general Leonard Wood (Iain Glen), and even his former president, Emilio F"
Quezon,2040,12,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,Aguinaldo (Mon Confiado)
Quezon,2040,13,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Penned by Tarog and Rody Vera, this concluding chapter of the Bayaniverse trilogy is a fun, engaging, yet biting and farcical take on its titular character's meteoric rise and eventual downfall"
Quezon,2040,14,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Intending to portray the historical figures in the film series often regarded as national heroes as ""flawed characters,"" the film, while showing the achievements they accomplished, also shows their cunning and manipulative tactics to get where they wanted to be"
Quezon,2040,15,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"The best comparison I could come up with for Quezon is Orson Welles' 1941 film, Citizen Kane, which also features the rise and fall of its main protagonist (Quezon even opens with a series of silent films, similar to how Citizen Kane introduces its main character through a series of newsreels)"
Quezon,2040,16,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"It's structured similarly too, told in a nonlinear narrative"
Quezon,2040,17,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Unlike Heneral Luna and Goyo, Quezon is divided into several chapters, with each of these beginning with Quezon headbutting with someone to achieve his goal, highlighting how he played many political games to secure his survival and to maintain his power"
Quezon,2040,18,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Another departure for the film is its setting—while the first two films are set during the Philippine-American War, this latest film explores the period of American political supervision that followed, eventually leading to the founding of the Philippine Commonwealth"
Quezon,2040,19,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,It doesn't have the big battle scenes of his first two predecessors and instead focuses on the war they fought within their offices and desks
Quezon,2040,20,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Unlike its predecessor, whose battles occur in sweeping landscapes and terrains complete with all the explosions and gunfights, Quezon is mostly confined in enclosed spaces and is more dialogue-driven"
Quezon,2040,21,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"It's also the most visually imaginative film in the trilogy, as it incorporates a series of silent films to create the myth behind Quezon's heroism"
Quezon,2040,22,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"The film creates different tones to emphasize the varying timeline and mood for several sequences: black-and-white color grading for the silent film sequences, a vintage palette look to depict the time of the young Quezon (played by Benjamin Alves), realistic and vibrant three-strip Technicolor for the old Quezon, and a dull and dreary tone for Aguinaldo"
Quezon,2040,23,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"This also highlights the difference between the way the public embraced Quezon and Aguinaldo's candidacy—one with color and life, while the other was marred by the death of Andres Bonifacio and Heneral Luna"
Quezon,2040,24,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"The film's production design managed to stay true to its milieu too, beautifully captured on camera by Pong Ignacio, who returns from the last two films"
Quezon,2040,25,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Most importantly, the film depicts the evolution of two of the trilogy's most important characters: Joven Hernando and Emilio Aguinaldo"
Quezon,2040,26,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"In the film, Joven is played by Arron Villaflor as the young version, while Cris Villanueva is the older one"
Quezon,2040,27,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Unlike in the first two films, where he is depicted as merely an observer for the two titular heroes, here in the third film, he becomes an active participant in the story"
Quezon,2040,28,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"However, he is no longer the reliable narrator that he once was, as we realize that he himself has turned a blind eye to Quezon's flaws as an individual and as a politician"
Quezon,2040,29,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"On the other hand, the film looks at Aguinaldo with a gentler and softer view, portraying him as this weakened veteran who tries to fight against the giant that Quezon eventually turns out to be in the film, falling victim to his propaganda"
Quezon,2040,30,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,And this is where the film's strength lies: with its powerful cast
Quezon,2040,31,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Mon Confiado delivers a more nuanced turn here as the veteran Emilio Aguinaldo, perfectly complemented by an equally restrained yet compelling performance from Angeli Bayani playing his wife, Maria Agoncillo-Aguinaldo"
Quezon,2040,32,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Arron Villaflor is brilliant as always portraying Joven Hernando, but Cris Villanueva adds another layer of depth to his character"
Quezon,2040,33,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Benjamin Alves also has an interesting part in the film, as he portrays the young Manuel Quezon but also as the actor portraying Quezon within the silent film world, existing on two separate planes and blurring the lines between fiction and reality and between the revised history and actual memory"
Quezon,2040,34,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Of course, Scottish actor Iain Glen deserves a special shoutout for his portrayal of Governor-General Leonard Wood"
Quezon,2040,35,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,Karylle also deserves some praise for her understated yet exquisite performance as Aurora Quezon
Quezon,2040,36,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,Romnick Sarmenta also impresses as Sergio Osmeña
Quezon,2040,37,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"But the one who really carries the film from start to finish is none other than Jericho Rosales, with his committed performance as the titular Quezon"
Quezon,2040,38,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Honestly, I was expecting Manuel L"
Quezon,2040,39,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon to have a somewhat full and deep voice, but when I saw the videos of his actual speeches, Rosales nailed his pitch and tone"
Quezon,2040,40,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,It's fun to see Rosales as Quezon manipulates his way through politics using one trick after another
Quezon,2040,41,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"He dazzles with his stirring and dedicated turn as the late president, warts and all"
Quezon,2040,42,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,Rosales perfectly captures the cunning nature of his character—a two-faced Janus head who uses deception and whispers sweet nothings to charm and manipulate everyone around him like chess pieces
Quezon,2040,43,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"With Quezon, Tarog delivers his ultimate thesis statement: that heroism isn't black or white"
Quezon,2040,44,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,We have to understand the grey areas in between
Quezon,2040,45,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,The heroes depicted in his trilogy did a lot of good things that led them to be celebrated as the heroes they are known as now
Quezon,2040,46,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"But like any other human being, they also did some pretty bad things—and Quezon, sadly, did a lot"
Quezon,2040,47,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"He inadvertently paved the way for patronage politics, or the spoils system, to take over our government—one that is still prevalent today"
Quezon,2040,48,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,His intentions started out as noble—he wants to give the Philippines the independence it has sought after for so many years
Quezon,2040,49,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"But along the way, he realizes that he has to play by the rules, bend some promises, and ultimately lie for what he believes is good for the country"
Quezon,2040,50,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Sadly, the things that he did led him to crave and hold on to his power for as long as he could"
Quezon,2040,51,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"Later, Quezon exclaims:""I am the Filipino people"
Quezon,2040,52,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,I am the Philippines
Quezon,2040,53,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,""" He spent the entire film creating this image of him as the only person who could bring independence to this country—by hook or by crook"
Quezon,2040,54,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,"But as we see his final image in the film, we all come to the very conclusion that Quezon is nothing but a megalomaniac"
Quezon,2040,55,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,He is not the savior he thinks he is
Quezon,2040,56,filmcirclerjct,,160.0,ltbx,He is but a man
Quezon,2041,1,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,I always had a keen interest in history
Quezon,2041,2,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"I think this started with my likes to learn about what happened before and knowing all these famous people that the cartoons and shows I watched as a kid that keep on referencing, such as Thomas Jerferson, Benjamin Franklin, etc"
Quezon,2041,3,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,This was further cemented by the social studies classes we had that focused on historical events of the world and the like
Quezon,2041,4,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,Philippine history was one and this led me to be more appreciative of what we went through as a nation
Quezon,2041,5,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"Naturally, this pushed me to more interested with movies that portrayed this events, even tho they weren't as accurate to what they wanted to represented *Ahem* El Presidente *Ahem* Fast forward to the release of Heneral Luna and Goyo, I was blown by how the films tried to show these people with a degree of understanding that wasn't as seen in previous historical movies portraying Heroes"
Quezon,2041,6,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"Luna and Goyo made me feel angry and surprised, respectively"
Quezon,2041,7,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"And now with Quezon, rarely do I get to see Philippine cinema being continued like this"
Quezon,2041,8,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"One that continues to show how the past can be a reflection of what we are today, especially when it comes to politics"
Quezon,2041,9,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"Its dirty, bloody and downright a game to some"
Quezon,2041,10,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,I was sceptical at first with the announcement of Jericho taking the role of Quezon
Quezon,2041,11,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"All those worries faded once he got lost into this performance as the convicing, and coniving, president"
Quezon,2041,12,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"Past and new characters were also introduced, adding so much to the story and how they all relate to one another"
Quezon,2041,13,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"They portrayed well the friendly banters, conversations, and even betrayals"
Quezon,2041,14,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"This connectedness and being one in a shared universe is amazing and works well with this film and the films before, even if each one feels different and stands on their own"
Quezon,2041,15,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,The Bayaniverse feels like a proper universe and one that I wish for more Filipino films
Quezon,2041,16,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,This is a culmination of trying to define and portray heroes in ways that don't treat them to be outright heroes
Quezon,2041,17,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"No, these are people who are both perpratrators and victims of their own aspirations, dreams, agendas, laurels and even mistakes"
Quezon,2041,18,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"This further pushes us to question those who led us before, and even those who lead us in the present"
Quezon,2041,19,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,I'm looking forward for more films like this
Quezon,2041,20,migsser,,180.0,ltbx,"And judging from the movie, I have a good feeling that there will be more"

Quezon,2044,1,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Hindi kasing emotionally charged ng Heneral Luna, o kasing tahimik at mapanuri ng Goyo, ngunit may sariling bigat at diin ang Quezon"
Quezon,2044,2,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Dito, ang digmaan ay wala na sa larangan ng putukan; nasa entablado na ng pulitika"
Quezon,2044,3,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"At gaya ng lahat ng magagandang palabas, bawat ngiti, bawat pakikipagkamay, at bawat pangako ay may kasamang pinag-ensayuhang pananalita"
Quezon,2044,4,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales delivers one of his best performances yet: charming, makinis, pero mapanganib"
Quezon,2044,5,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,Bilang Manuel L
Quezon,2044,6,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon, hindi siya ipininta bilang bayani kundi bilang isang politiko na marunong maglaro ng sistema"
Quezon,2044,7,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,Hindi niya winawasak ang istruktura ng katiwalian; siya mismo ang bumuo nito
Quezon,2044,8,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,Ang trapo sa katauhan ni Quezon ay isang masalimuot na larawan ng kapangyarihan
Quezon,2044,9,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Nakakatawa siya sa kanyang karisma ngunit nakakikilabot sa likod ng ngiti, kung saan namamayani ang tuso at mapanlinlang na pag-iisip"
Quezon,2044,10,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,Ang direksyon ni Jerrold Tarog ay mas pulido at teatrikal kumpara sa unang dalawang pelikula
Quezon,2044,11,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Halata ang diin sa blocking, sa staging ng mga eksena, at sa simbolismo"
Quezon,2044,12,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,Parang chess match na bawat galaw ay may kapalit
Quezon,2044,13,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Ang cinematography ay malinis, kulay-aristokratiko, at puno ng simetrya, na tila ipinapakita kung paanong ginawang perpektong entablado ang politika"
Quezon,2044,14,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Ang musical scoring naman ay naglalaro sa pagitan ng dalamhati at panunukso, na tila tugtugin ng isang entablado kung saan ang kapangyarihan ay ginagawang palabas"
Quezon,2044,15,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Hindi ito kasing-sakit ng Heneral Luna o kasing-lalim ng Goyo, ngunit mararamdaman mo ang maruming realidad ng politika"
Quezon,2044,16,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Naroon ang mga kasinungalingang nakabalot sa magarang retorika, at kung paanong ang kalayaan ay maaaring gamitin bilang produkto ng kampanya"
Quezon,2044,17,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Dito mo makikita kung saan nagsimula ang mga siklong hindi pa rin tapos hanggang ngayon: utang na loob, padrino system, at ang walang katapusang pagbilog sa ulo ng taumbayan"
Quezon,2044,18,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,Tarog closes the Bayaniverse not with a scream or a whisper but with a smirk
Quezon,2044,19,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,Isang paalala na ang ating bansa ay itinayo hindi lang sa dugo ng mga bayani kundi sa galing ng mga manlalarong marunong tumaya
Quezon,2044,20,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Sa dulo, hindi mo alam kung matatawa ka o maiiyak, dahil ang pelikulang ito ay parehong kasaysayan at salamin: mapanlinlang, maganda, at masakit tanggapin"
Quezon,2044,21,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,Hindi ito aral tungkol sa kabayanihan; ito ay babala tungkol sa kapangyarihan
Quezon,2044,22,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Sa pagtatapos ng Quezon, tila tayo ay nanonood ng salamin na bumabalik sa ating paningin"
Quezon,2044,23,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Dito natin nakikita na ang politika ay matagal nang pagtatanghal, at ang mga aktor ay nagpapalit lang ng kasuotan"
Quezon,2044,24,gerigravity,,160.0,ltbx,"Ang palabas ay nabago na ng panahon, ngunit ang manuskrito ay ganoon pa rin"
Quezon,2045,1,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,Small kwento: We saw Mon Confiado before watching the film kasi may surprise talkback session siguro before our showtime
Quezon,2045,2,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,"We asked for a photo, then ang sabi niya sa amin: “Please review the film"
Quezon,2045,3,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,"Bad or good, it’s okay"
Quezon,2045,4,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,”I actually didn’t want to watch Quezon yet kasi gusto ko may talkback
Quezon,2045,5,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,I really wish every screening of Quezon had one
Quezon,2045,6,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,"Somehow, it’s not enough that we just witnessed what happened on screen"
Quezon,2045,7,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,It’s also important to have a discourse about it
Quezon,2045,8,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,I understand that would be difficult and probably impossible to do for every showing
Quezon,2045,9,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,But it's a nice to have
Quezon,2045,10,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,"Jerrold and the cast spent months or even years researching these heroes, and it feels lacking if all that effort just ends in a two-hour movie"
Quezon,2045,11,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,I’m sure there were stories cut short or ideas that couldn’t be fully explored
Quezon,2045,12,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,It would’ve been so nice to hear more about it directly from them
Quezon,2045,13,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,So we ended up dissecting the film among ourselves after watching
Quezon,2045,14,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,The first thing we all said was how Quezon made it so easy to understand Manuel Luis Quezon
Quezon,2045,15,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,"The film is divided into chapters, and in each one, it’s clear who he’s up against and what they are fighting about"
Quezon,2045,16,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,"And in every chapter, he always comes out winning"
Quezon,2045,17,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon is unafraid to exhaust all his resources and even resort to dirty tricks to gain the upper hand
Quezon,2045,18,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,"He can come up with unorthodox ways to defeat his enemies, and sometimes, he even teams up with them to take down bigger and badder ones"
Quezon,2045,19,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon is just good at what he does
Quezon,2045,20,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,But he also thinks so highly of himself as the savior of the Philippines that it eventually becomes his downfall
Quezon,2045,21,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,It’s all very interesting
Quezon,2045,22,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,"Like Luna and Goyo, Quezon is deeply flawed"
Quezon,2045,23,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,"In our minds, he's a great president for bringing independence to the country"
Quezon,2045,24,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,But we all agreed that we never really saw Quezon this way before
Quezon,2045,25,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,It’s also amazing how the old problems in the film mirror the issues we still see in Philippine politics today
Quezon,2045,26,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,Maybe even worse
Quezon,2045,27,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,I’d say Quezon is a must-watch
Quezon,2045,28,miggyber,,180.0,ltbx,"We had a blast watching it, and it’s even better when you get to talk about it afterward with friends or family"
Quezon,2046,1,ikalabingisa,,200.0,ltbx,Love you echo napatawa mo aq ng many times
Quezon,2047,1,julesc08,,160.0,ltbx,the history book on the shelf really DOES repeat itself
Quezon,2048,1,clnrnth,,160.0,ltbx,we are slaves of our own feelings (non-verbatim)
Quezon,2048,2,clnrnth,,160.0,ltbx,loved the storytelling
Quezon,2048,3,clnrnth,,160.0,ltbx,it suits the clown that manuel quezon is
Quezon,2048,4,clnrnth,,160.0,ltbx,"also, stay for the post credit scene—presidente-verse"
Quezon,2048,5,clnrnth,,160.0,ltbx,I'm seated
Quezon,2049,1,itos,,160.0,ltbx,watched in a block screening of my tito who plays nieto
Quezon,2049,2,itos,,160.0,ltbx,"welcome to philippine politics — where everything is a game, and things can get messy"
Quezon,2049,3,itos,,160.0,ltbx,"this is such a rich character study on manuel quezon, backed by a generational performance from jericho rosales"
Quezon,2049,4,itos,,160.0,ltbx,quezon really laid out the foundations of how a filipino leader is made; through the manipulation of power and by being really loud
Quezon,2049,5,itos,,160.0,ltbx,"production-wise this is a huge step up from goyo even if there aren’t any war scenes — the PD and the cinematography really leveled up, like wow"
Quezon,2049,6,itos,,160.0,ltbx,"slight complaint but i think the choice to use arron villaflor in most of the flashbacks was poor, because it got kind of confusing when we’d have flashbacks with jericho rosales as the old quezon but have arron villaflor as a young joven — though it did click eventually, it could have been much smoother if they just used cris villanueva and used make-up on him to make him a bit younger"
Quezon,2049,7,itos,,160.0,ltbx,"but still, a really well-done film… magsaysay movie next"
Quezon,2049,8,itos,,160.0,ltbx,"watched in SM Aura cinema, director’s club"
Quezon,2050,1,sagestiles,,160.0,ltbx,"imo (as a history major) best of the trilogy, in terms of depicting the early political arena and padrino system"
Quezon,2050,2,sagestiles,,160.0,ltbx,"also, appreciated how it goes into the myth-making of quezon's persona"
Quezon,2050,3,sagestiles,,160.0,ltbx,one of jericho rosales' best performances
Quezon,2051,1,carthegarden,,120.0,ltbx,kauna unahang trapo sa pinas 4 stars ko sana kaso kasali si cong tv panira ampota
Quezon,2052,1,mrkjsp,,200.0,ltbx,Best Philippine movie of the year
Quezon,2053,1,miiixaaaa,,160.0,ltbx,not enrile watching his own memories in hd
Quezon,2054,1,1stkenpachi,,140.0,ltbx,wait we lowkey improved cinematography
Quezon,2055,1,mundane_moron,,160.0,ltbx,"The third and final film in the Bayaniverse film series, Quezon is an eye opener for every Filipino that only know Manuel L"
Quezon,2055,2,mundane_moron,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon in the history books
Quezon,2055,3,mundane_moron,,160.0,ltbx,The film showed Quezon's true color and the tricks and machineries he used to gain political power
Quezon,2055,4,mundane_moron,,160.0,ltbx,"If history can tell, mud slinging during the election campaign season has been a part of Philippine politics since time immemorial"
Quezon,2055,5,mundane_moron,,160.0,ltbx,It is ingrained in our culture and it will never be removed
Quezon,2055,6,mundane_moron,,160.0,ltbx,Tarog and Vera's screenplay is also impressive
Quezon,2055,7,mundane_moron,,160.0,ltbx,The Bayaniverse is now completed and I hope this does not ends here
Quezon,2055,8,mundane_moron,,160.0,ltbx,Tarog and TBA Studios should continue telling the Philippine history post-World War II
Quezon,2055,9,mundane_moron,,160.0,ltbx,The Bayaniverse is a true testament that Filipinos will spend their hard-earned money in movie theaters if a local film is executed well with great storytelling and screenplay
Quezon,2056,1,hongweikai,,160.0,ltbx,"Toxic bayani yaoi and they made it an entire nation's century-old problem: #QueOs;JC Santos, nasa kiffy ko ang independencia"
Quezon,2056,2,hongweikai,,160.0,ltbx,"Keep up tayo, #OsRox"
Quezon,2056,3,hongweikai,,160.0,ltbx,[SM City North EDSA]
Quezon,2057,1,eveana,,160.0,ltbx,this srsly had the best cinematography and editing ever
Quezon,2058,1,latissimusdomsi,,120.0,ltbx,Has a very clean TV sheen to it that I don't think matches this kind of period piece
Quezon,2058,2,latissimusdomsi,,120.0,ltbx,"It doesn't help that the acting's pretty uneven, which gives it more of a campy feel rather than a serious biopic"
Quezon,2058,3,latissimusdomsi,,120.0,ltbx,"Rosales hams up his Quezon portrayal so much that the ""climactic"" turn just falls flat"
Quezon,2058,4,latissimusdomsi,,120.0,ltbx,"It's not without its bright spots though, specifically the crafts and Mon Confiado's Aguinaldo (great continuity between the 3 Tarrog films), both of which save this movie from being an outright disappointment"
Quezon,2059,1,rieyadomi,,,ltbx,pepito my friend
Quezon,2060,1,1vynicole,,200.0,ltbx,“ano nanaman niluluto mo”  sergio x quezon
Quezon,2061,1,zoey_de_leon,,200.0,ltbx,I love this movie because this isn't perfect
Quezon,2061,2,zoey_de_leon,,200.0,ltbx,"How these “heroic” figures are portrayed as flawed as they are and just paints the whole message of this Bayaniverse trilogy to look them up not as idols, but because of their principles"
Quezon,2061,3,zoey_de_leon,,200.0,ltbx,You will not root for Quezon because of his apparent manipulation to gain power and you will also not root for Aguinaldo because he is incompetent
Quezon,2061,4,zoey_de_leon,,200.0,ltbx,You are conflicted as you should be
Quezon,2061,5,zoey_de_leon,,200.0,ltbx,There are no favorites
Quezon,2061,6,zoey_de_leon,,200.0,ltbx,"What we have left to root for is the normal citizen, Joven, that is genuis as the film's creative liberty that represents us as filipinos and honesty which is all we need and Cris Villanueva's role for me, just blends into another great film he's in about deconstructing the strucuture for a flawed hero that is José Rizal in Bayaning 3rd World"
Quezon,2061,7,zoey_de_leon,,200.0,ltbx,Which is also a film that involves telling the story within a fake film within this movie
Quezon,2061,8,zoey_de_leon,,200.0,ltbx,I will favor on this over the perfunctory Heneral Luna and this is up to par with another flawed character story in Goyo
Quezon,2062,1,klyppans,,200.0,ltbx,Such an amazing cinematic experience I can't even be sad about the plot
Quezon,2062,2,klyppans,,200.0,ltbx,"A very inspiring movie for the creatives, but very defeatist for Filipinos"
Quezon,2063,1,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,“The Philippine Assembly is yours—body and soul
Quezon,2063,2,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,”#QUEZON felt pretty much of a movie closer to our present day than did Heneral Luna and Goyo
Quezon,2063,3,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"I suppose it could be because of the timeline, but the events in this movie mirrored the present more harrowingly and realistically"
Quezon,2063,4,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,I must say that my favorite scene in the film has to be the scene when a hauntingly troubled Aguinaldo was climbing up the stage in what pretty much seemed to be a miting de avance some time before the 1935 elections
Quezon,2063,5,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"When it was Aguinaldo’s turn to speak, he rose from his seat and walked towards the stage as the charming Quezon climbed down parallel to him"
Quezon,2063,6,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,The background music intensified
Quezon,2063,7,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,The room did not know of the weight of the moment for Aguinaldo—only he and his Vice Presidential running mate Raymundo Melliza knew of what seemed to be their greatest leverage in the elections and against Quezon for all we know
Quezon,2063,8,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"The living evidence was there, present in that one corner—Quezon’s alleged first wife—a seemingly powerful instrument that could determine Quezon’s reputation"
Quezon,2063,9,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,Aguinaldo had a smoking gun
Quezon,2063,10,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"Even I sat in the audience wondering, “Would he drop the ball"
Quezon,2063,11,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"” Though Melliza was right in saying that they had no formal proof that the woman and Quezon were indeed married, the positive assertion could spark reasonable doubt on the perceived savior of the Philippines that is Quezon"
Quezon,2063,12,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"The visibly horrified, pale-faced Quezon was standing aghast—would Aguinaldo get his own hands dirty as well"
Quezon,2063,13,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"Perhaps, Aguinaldo’s option not to pursue the scheme significantly supported the image he had throughout the film: a noble, self-redeeming character in the nation’s struggle for independence who played the bigger man and refused to revenge out of spite"
Quezon,2063,14,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,Another interesting point that made me leave the theater with more questions than answers was the re-introduction of Capt
Quezon,2063,15,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"Janolino, the man who made the first blow on Hen"
Quezon,2063,16,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,Luna upon alleged orders from Aguinaldo some three decades ago
Quezon,2063,17,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"History tells us that Ka Miong purportedly sent four telegrams to the general, instructing the general to meet with him in Cabanatuan"
Quezon,2063,18,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"Janolino sent the first attack, striking the general in the face while the others followed suit"
Quezon,2063,19,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"In the film, Janolino was brought to Joven, the fictional figure, in order to clear his own conscience and finally become the man who lived to tell the tale"
Quezon,2063,20,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"Janolino told Joven that his conscience no longer could contain the guilt, and that Aguinaldo indeed ordered the Luna massacre while handing Joven one of the four telegrams"
Quezon,2063,21,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"History is not just about going back to the past, or connecting it to the present; it, too, is about questioning the narratives that we have long grown up believing, and more importantly, questioning what really was the truest truth about the motives of the people that shaped our history, yes, even forty, sixty, or ninety years apart"
Quezon,2063,22,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,There is no question that Janolino was a blessing that came to Quezon’s lap at the right place and in the right time
Quezon,2063,23,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,We know the man
Quezon,2063,24,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"Quezon was too old of a hand in politics, or rather, in the craftsmanship of political manipulation"
Quezon,2063,25,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"Quezon had Janolino as his final act of ragebait against Aguinaldo, leading to the latter’s eventual loss in the elections"
Quezon,2063,26,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"But the question that left me mentally running in circles was, was Janolino really sincere in coming forward"
Quezon,2063,27,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,Or was he yet another opportunist who took the chance to clear his name before anything happens to his life
Quezon,2063,28,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"Worst, was he yet another strategist who switched sides when it was most convenient to feast at the banquet of Quezon’s Senate as his Sergeant-at-Arms"
Quezon,2063,29,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,We never know
Quezon,2063,30,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"We could only do so much as cast a doubt on true intentions, no matter how impractical, to really arrive at the truth"
Quezon,2063,31,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"Was Janolino’s coming forward an altruistic move, or was it a plot to be thyself’s own saving grace"
Quezon,2063,32,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"If you know the reference, good for you"
Quezon,2063,33,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"Anyhow, despite the complicated cable spaghetti of neophyte Philippine politics, one can deduce but a single, unfortunate fact that not even Quezon, in a hypothetical redemption moment of his, could deny, and it is this: that corruption is as old as time, and that much of what we see today is utterly of little to no difference with what the country suffered before"
Quezon,2063,34,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s all a real déjà vu, only worse"
Quezon,2063,35,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,“The Philippine Assembly is yours—body and soul
Quezon,2063,36,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"” If, before, the yours Quezon “sold” the people to are the Americans, now, the ones who sold the Filipino people and the yours these people are sold to are our fellow Filipinos: politicians who connive among themselves to lay bare the people as mere commodities"
Quezon,2063,37,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,"I am not so sure for everybody else but to me, that sounds like holding up a mirror in the face of Philippine history, except this time, the canon events seem more horrid"
Quezon,2063,38,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,May the lessons of history cease to remain as lessons
Quezon,2063,39,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,May we make them cease to remain as lessons
Quezon,2063,40,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,Vote wisely
Quezon,2063,41,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,Think critically
Quezon,2063,42,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,Fight courageously
Quezon,2063,43,ehrnjhn,,200.0,ltbx,———PS: Props to Echo

Quezon,2067,13,bunnwatch,,180.0,ltbx,its a masterful campaign play bc people still react the same way today
Quezon,2067,14,bunnwatch,,180.0,ltbx,but watching mq play his political game around him and others makes you want him to play that trump card
Quezon,2067,15,bunnwatch,,180.0,ltbx,"pull the trigger, aguinaldo, you think"

Quezon,2067,23,bunnwatch,,180.0,ltbx,"another note: theres also something to be said here about nadia's film, and the black-and-white display of incomplete truth"

Quezon,2071,1,mango_mikay,,200.0,ltbx,"“ Independence is good enough to eat “Quezon stands out from the bayaniverse movies that came before it — whereas Heneral Luna and Goyo had themes of war, Quezon portrayed political dramas, intellectual battles, and the performance of Manuel Quezon as a political leader"
Quezon,2071,2,mango_mikay,,200.0,ltbx,"Quezon goes beyond its purpose of entertainment, it is a reminder of all the wrongdoings of our leaders due the mind games these leaders have instilled into our political system"
Quezon,2071,3,mango_mikay,,200.0,ltbx,"The film is very timely for our political milieu, it shows how politics is like a game of chess — you take as much as you can from your opponent until they have nothing left"

Quezon,2071,9,mango_mikay,,200.0,ltbx,"I loved the juxtaposition between Quezon and Aguinaldo’s scenes — the loud and blaring music and overbearing lighting for Quezon, and the almost quiet and dull lighting for Aguinaldo"
Quezon,2071,10,mango_mikay,,200.0,ltbx,Everything was so tight knit and well executed and truly added more to the story
Quezon,2071,11,mango_mikay,,200.0,ltbx,This film is truly thought-provoking and is definitely a cinematic experience as a Filipino

Quezon,2073,1,wllmdms,,140.0,ltbx,"i adore how the film transitions between fiction and reality, much like how history and fact are always muddied in the game of politics"
Quezon,2073,2,wllmdms,,140.0,ltbx,it almost breaks the fourth wall at times—the language of film nearly breaking at the seams by design
Quezon,2073,3,wllmdms,,140.0,ltbx,"i loved how they integrated joven, nadia, and miguel as both audience surrogates and parts of political machinery (excluding miguel bc my man knew what was up)the film tends to overexplain itself at times, especially in the first half when it has to get the audience up to speed on historical events"
Quezon,2073,4,wllmdms,,140.0,ltbx,things are spelled out for you in ways that should already be obvious by just
Quezon,2073,5,wllmdms,,140.0,ltbx,listening to the dialogue and watching the damn movie
Quezon,2073,6,wllmdms,,140.0,ltbx,tbh this really was the only aspect i was pretty annoyed at by the film
Quezon,2073,7,wllmdms,,140.0,ltbx,once it gets past this is when the film feels most electric—you could cut the tension with a knife in the cinema i was in during the candidates' election speeches
Quezon,2073,8,wllmdms,,140.0,ltbx,"jericho rosales absolutely kills it, especially when delivering quezon's mannerisms, way of speech, and subtle tics"
Quezon,2073,9,wllmdms,,140.0,ltbx,"mon confiado returns as aguinaldo, showing so many facets to him that you'd almost think to root for him"
Quezon,2073,10,wllmdms,,140.0,ltbx,"i wish karylle had more to do as aurora quezon—i could say the same for pretty much the entire female cast atp, who all felt a bit underutilized"
Quezon,2073,11,wllmdms,,140.0,ltbx,"as with the other bayaniverse films, these are always worth the price of admission (especially with the student and teacher's discount"

Quezon,2074,3,tteokbomi,,160.0,ltbx,"In school, we just learn that he was the first president of the Commonwealth and made Tagalog the national language"
Quezon,2074,4,tteokbomi,,160.0,ltbx,"But in the film, he was shown as a kind and brave person who truly cared for people"
Quezon,2074,5,tteokbomi,,160.0,ltbx,One scene that touched me was when he helped the Jewish refugees during World War II
Quezon,2074,6,tteokbomi,,160.0,ltbx,It showed how he wanted to save lives even if it was hard for him and his government
Quezon,2074,7,tteokbomi,,160.0,ltbx,"If I compare Quezon’s time to politics now, I feel like there’s a big difference"
Quezon,2074,8,tteokbomi,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon really cared about people, while some politicians today care more about fame and power"
Quezon,2074,9,tteokbomi,,160.0,ltbx,"The way Quezon stood up for what was right reminded me that leaders should have strong values like honesty, courage, and compassion"
Quezon,2074,10,tteokbomi,,160.0,ltbx,The movie made me realize that our country needs leaders like Quezon—people who think about others before themselves
Quezon,2074,11,tteokbomi,,160.0,ltbx,"If we all had those values, maybe our society would be a better place"

Quezon,2078,2,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,"Seeing that corruption and political favors is a tale as old as time is something I kind of expect, but seeing it happen as the film progress hurts because things haven't changed"
Quezon,2078,3,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,"That said, what I did not really expect is toxic old man yaoi featuring Quezon and Osmeña"

Quezon,2081,2,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,You can still feel Tarog’s hand writing the audience into a corner where the “message” lies
Quezon,2081,3,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,Who can blame him
Quezon,2081,4,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,Even Rizal talked to the people of Calamba directly in El Fili
Quezon,2081,5,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,Maybe it is a feature of the Filipino art form
Quezon,2081,6,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,A feature I don’t like
Quezon,2081,7,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,This made me appreciate the deft rendering of Luna in Heneral Luna

Quezon,2081,9,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,You feel all the people involved having fun while doing their jobs
Quezon,2081,10,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,You get used to the out of place existence of the Joven character by now so you just accept the somehow modern Taglish way his daughter talks because the previous entries have utilized him well
Quezon,2081,11,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,I didn’t notice the over 120-minute runtime unlike in Goyo
Quezon,2081,12,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,I will forever bang the drum for more Romnick Sarmenta roles
Quezon,2081,13,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,It was also refreshing to see JC Santos being treated the way Nolan treated Rami Malek in Oppenheimer (which is definitely an influence here)
Quezon,2081,14,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,I needed more of the talky genre here though
Quezon,2081,15,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,Arcilla still holds the belt in terms of the acting chops in this trilogy but I loved that you never see any semblance of Jericho Rosales in Quezon
Quezon,2081,16,odinofcodin,,160.0,ltbx,He completely embodies the role
Quezon,2082,1,heycomet,,160.0,ltbx,"doesn't shy away from crafting these strong messages knowing that filipinos are too gullible, believing literally anything—be it a social media post, an anonymous person's opinion online, and even movies like this"
Quezon,2082,2,heycomet,,160.0,ltbx,also a good callout to the media & journalists—the complicity and hypocrisy

Quezon,2089,2,julesphilip,,120.0,ltbx,I know that my attention span is still not fried because I managed to sit through this film which is filled with nothing but dialogues (mostly with Echo’s puñeta and putangina)
Quezon,2089,3,julesphilip,,120.0,ltbx,"In terms of historical value (or significance), this is probably the weakest film in Tarog’s Bayaniverse"

Quezon,2089,5,julesphilip,,120.0,ltbx,"After Heneral Luna and Goyo, I really was expecting Tarog to focus on Mabini next or other revolutionaries"
Quezon,2089,6,julesphilip,,120.0,ltbx,"Nonetheless, Quezon still offered an important context of how trapos came to be and why patronage politics persists until today"

Quezon,2092,1,alexiasq,,180.0,ltbx,"the congtv cameo was so random but ok  sspoilers a refreshing perspective on our history considering that most of the things i was taught (or forcibly memorized) as a child were just quezon’s, osmeña’s, and roxas’ achievements— completely disregarding their relationships and the means they took to rise up to power"
Quezon,2092,2,alexiasq,,180.0,ltbx,the mtrcb rating should be r-13 bc lets be fr a child isnt gonna understand that politics has always been a morally grey area and just assume that…

Quezon,2094,3,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"Yes, he was instrumental in taking the country through its first steps into independence from its colonial masters, but the film also unabashedly shows him as manipulative, petty, and spiteful"
Quezon,2094,4,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"Worst of all, particularly in the context of today's incendiary socio-political climate, the film explicitly blames him for laying the foundations for the patronage politics that has plagued the country for decades"
Quezon,2094,5,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,It's certainly not stress-free viewing for those among us who are already anxious over our current national situation
Quezon,2094,6,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"If his highly skilled work on the gem Sana Dati and the first two entries in the BAYANIverse films, Heneral Luna and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, did not manage to convince you that Tarrog is one of Pinoy cinema's most masterful directors, this film should"

Quezon,2094,8,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"Sequences are creatively and tightly shot, producing a beautiful rhythm that belies the films runtime of over two hours"
Quezon,2094,9,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"The [silent] film-within-a-film is a very nice touch, showcasing Tarrog's ability to balance pathos and humor, and also conveniently explaining why young Quezon is played by another actor (Benjamin Alves) in the first two films"
Quezon,2094,10,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales is pitch-perfect as Quezon
Quezon,2094,11,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"His Quezon is cocky and assured, but also vulnerable and volatile"
Quezon,2094,12,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"Cursory surveys of old video and audio clips of Quezon make it clear how well former matinee idol Rosales captures the Commonwealth President's vocal cadence, but the way he moves his body, a lot of which is presumably not visible in most existing videos, gives him ownership of the character"
Quezon,2094,13,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"Rosales has proven his acting mettle in previous turns in both film and television, but this is probably the role that he was born to play"
Quezon,2094,14,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"Among the supporting actors, the highlight is Mon Confiado as Emilio Aguinaldo, owning the role to the point that it's probably difficult to think of any other actor doing it as successfully"
Quezon,2094,15,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"Confiado is often an uneven and divisive actor especially when it comes to loud, overtly physical characters, but here he shows how skilled he is with more quiet, introspective roles"
Quezon,2094,16,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"The ever-reliable Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmena, Bodjie Pascua as Raymundo Melliza, and Angeli Bayani as Maria Agoncillo also give laudable turns"

Quezon,2094,20,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"The black-and-white scenes give lenser Pong Ignacio room to play with light, but it's rather unfortunate that the makeup on the actors during those sequences makes them look like the ghouls from Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls"
Quezon,2094,21,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"The true standout, however, is the score (by Tarrog himself), which propels the film's pace with alternating whimsy and somberness, and it never feels out of place or overly used (which is very common in local films)"

Quezon,2094,23,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"For both its quality and its socio-political message, it is must-see Pinoy cinema"
Quezon,2094,24,popscicle,,180.0,ltbx,"Sure, it takes liberties with historical accuracy (the filmmakers are quick to disabuse us of the notion that it's meant to be fully historically accurate), but it asks the right questions, just as Heneral Luna did (remember its iconic ""Bayan o sarili"

Quezon,2104,14,ownhrl,,160.0,ltbx,” and I was right
Quezon,2104,15,ownhrl,,160.0,ltbx,"His performance made Quezon feel real and relatable, showing not just the hero, but the man behind the title"
Quezon,2104,16,ownhrl,,160.0,ltbx,"His accent was consistent from start to finish, and the rest of the cast did great too, especially Romnick Sarmienta as Sergio"
Quezon,2104,17,ownhrl,,160.0,ltbx,"And for the first time, Joven Hernando’s role actually made sense to me, even though he doesn’t exist in real life"

Quezon,2104,26,ownhrl,,160.0,ltbx,"Overall, it was a great film, probably a fitting end to the Bayaniverse"
Quezon,2104,27,ownhrl,,160.0,ltbx,Totally worth every peso spent and definitely a must watch Filipino historical film

Quezon,2113,3,_jxcx,,140.0,ltbx,I liked the flow of the story and how three-dimensional the characters are
Quezon,2113,4,_jxcx,,140.0,ltbx,I also liked the comedic approach to a rather depressing subject matter
Quezon,2113,5,_jxcx,,140.0,ltbx,Sound was a bit unbalanced

Quezon,2117,6,dayniyel,,140.0,ltbx,"at some point, joven and his family’s narrative aid felt way too heavy handed in this one, in contrast to the earlier films"

Quezon,2118,3,sintanggubat,,160.0,ltbx,i mean since this is part of the Bayaniverse i expected it to be more grand and intense

Quezon,2123,5,anjelaera,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, when watching someone “perform” or “manipulate”, the audience may subconsciously hold back emotionally"
Quezon,2123,6,anjelaera,,160.0,ltbx,So maybe that’s why I felt less connected to Quezon compared to Heneral Luna and Goyo
Quezon,2123,7,anjelaera,,160.0,ltbx,The film also has a tendency to over-explain things that could’ve been a subtext
Quezon,2123,8,anjelaera,,160.0,ltbx,"It couldn’t have come at a better time, when people are holding leaders accountable and seeing through the spectacle"

Quezon,2129,2,cocofurbee,,200.0,ltbx,") act of his Bayani-verse, and while it may not be the conventional trilogy that we expect where it gets bigger and more spectacular with each installment, Quezon is more gut-wrenching, diabolical and closely resembles the truth we have today in politics"
Quezon,2129,3,cocofurbee,,200.0,ltbx,"It successfully and awkwardly shows us a mirror that continuously slaps us Filipinos in the face real hard with questions about fake independence and our failure as a nation, after Heneral Luna (2015) and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2017)"

Quezon,2153,4,kylorenz94,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales and Romnick Sarmenta are really the highlights as titular character and Osmeña respectively
Quezon,2153,5,kylorenz94,,160.0,ltbx,Thought *that* cameo is so unnecessary
Quezon,2154,1,jmsoriano03,,180.0,ltbx,"galing talaga pagkalatag ng story, Jerrold Tarog yan e"
Quezon,2154,2,jmsoriano03,,180.0,ltbx,husaaaay ni Echo
Quezon,2155,1,igiferrer,,180.0,ltbx,no one told me filo yaoi existed in 1920s
Quezon,2156,1,sphynxwatches,,140.0,ltbx,Jerrold Tarog is quite consistent
Quezon,2156,2,sphynxwatches,,140.0,ltbx,This film has both the faults and the strengths of its predecessors despite the change in tone and characters here
Quezon,2156,3,sphynxwatches,,140.0,ltbx,"This trilogy sensationalizes these historical figures and is over-acted by much of its cast (although let's face it, that's a common issue within Philippine cinema), but it is also intentional in creating a narrative about the Bayani that makes a lot of sense when you look at the trilogy as a whole"
Quezon,2156,4,sphynxwatches,,140.0,ltbx,"Like the first two movies, this movie has so many odd creative choices where the intention is in full display but doesn't really serve the overall narrative"
Quezon,2156,5,sphynxwatches,,140.0,ltbx,"Case in point for this film, while the writing is funny at times, it feels so hollow because it's so evidently trying to get a laugh from its audience but fails in its purpose because it detracts from the story rather than enriches it"
Quezon,2156,6,sphynxwatches,,140.0,ltbx,Many other such choices can be pointed out all across the trilogy
Quezon,2156,7,sphynxwatches,,140.0,ltbx,"Overall though, I have to give Tarog his flowers"
Quezon,2156,8,sphynxwatches,,140.0,ltbx,The trilogy has inspired renewed national interest in our history and revisits our national heroes in a way that invites us to re-evaluate where the education we received about them might have been wrong

Quezon,2158,3,micaardbei,,140.0,ltbx,"the question is, do we now know the true meaning of independence"
Quezon,2158,4,micaardbei,,140.0,ltbx,or are we still blinded by the false promises that these greedy tyrants give us
Quezon,2158,5,micaardbei,,140.0,ltbx,“salus populi suprema lex esto” the welfare of the people shall be the supreme law— but that is not the case here in the philippines
Quezon,2158,6,micaardbei,,140.0,ltbx,"government officials prioritize their lavish lifestyles by using our crazy high taxes and providing us subpar infrastractures, disgusting and infuriating"

Quezon,2161,1,gabryanz,,140.0,ltbx,what an insightful dissection of quezon and his unfortunate legacy to the ph nation
Quezon,2161,2,gabryanz,,140.0,ltbx,it opens up a discussion of how patronage politics exploits our filipino values and how quezon played such an integral role in embedding this toxic practice into our country
Quezon,2161,3,gabryanz,,140.0,ltbx,pinapakita rin ng quezon kung gaano kasura-sura ang sirko ng politika sa ating bansa
Quezon,2161,4,gabryanz,,140.0,ltbx,"ang sistema ng pamahalaan na itinatag ng mga amerikano ay elitista, na siya namang inabuso at kinasiyahan nina quezon"
Quezon,2161,5,gabryanz,,140.0,ltbx,"with critique on how media can shape public perception not necessarily aligned with the truth, the film drives these points forward through the characters of joven and his family"
Quezon,2161,6,gabryanz,,140.0,ltbx,"i agree though with the other reviews that the characterization could be better, and a lot of its points can be less on-the-nose"

Quezon,2168,3,benzingko,,140.0,ltbx,More thoughts to be thunk about this but for now I’d say I really like Tarrog’s BCU because of how the project was consistent across the trilogy but it was also elevated per film
Quezon,2168,4,benzingko,,140.0,ltbx,"It provoked deeper inspection of how we view our national heroes, and drew parallels between the past and the present"
Quezon,2168,5,benzingko,,140.0,ltbx,This one in particular is very interesting to me because of my recent encounters with Quezon (thanks ate) and my love-hate relationship with propaganda

Quezon,2170,4,ayesak21,,160.0,ltbx,This time we got to do a character study on Manuel Luis Quezon
Quezon,2170,5,ayesak21,,160.0,ltbx,A man who is a prominent figure of our history
Quezon,2170,6,ayesak21,,160.0,ltbx,A political chameleon as to how others describe him
Quezon,2170,7,ayesak21,,160.0,ltbx,"Heneral Luna was the “dagitab” that started it all, Goyo is fine film that dealt with the immediate aftermath of its predecessor and Quezon is this franchise’s final salvo"
Quezon,2170,8,ayesak21,,160.0,ltbx,The pacing of the film is good
Quezon,2170,9,ayesak21,,160.0,ltbx,I liked how each scenes was able to give tension and stakes
Quezon,2170,10,ayesak21,,160.0,ltbx,My only nitpick was how the first hour of the film had a slower pace and then as we approach the end it felt rushed but maybe this was made so that it echoes Quezon’s desperate cling to power he built
Quezon,2170,11,ayesak21,,160.0,ltbx,Each scene felt like a game of chess and it is what kept me entertained

Quezon,2170,19,ayesak21,,160.0,ltbx,Mon Confiado as an older version of Emilio Aguinaldo was also a delight to watch
Quezon,2170,20,ayesak21,,160.0,ltbx,"Ibang iba sa mga naunang Aguinaldo and I saw comments na they pity the old man but the way I saw it it, it was his karma that came to bite him"

Quezon,2216,1,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,"Coming from the unbridled fury of Heneral Luna and the reflective nature of Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, this installment takes us to the performance of nation-building, set not in battlefields but at podiums and facing cameras"
Quezon,2216,2,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon, as the third larger-than-life figure, enjoys high production value as well, even if the centerpieces are explosive conversations and political machinations rather than fight scenes"
Quezon,2216,3,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,"Rosales as Quezon is a spectacle, with his high-pitched Tagalog-accented voice that mimics the gravitas of a transatlantic declamatory statesman"
Quezon,2216,4,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,"It matches, too, with the crux of his character being that of a man who learned from the Americans’ game of politics, and brought it back home"
Quezon,2216,5,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,His performance and chemistry with the rest of the cast (namely his hilarious toxic yaoi push-and-pull with Sarmenta’s Osmeña and his dogged face-off with Confiado’s Aguinaldo) make a strong case for this film being the most entertaining of the three
Quezon,2216,6,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, it may also be the one with the least heart in it"
Quezon,2216,7,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,"The senseless politicking and pandering to the promise of independence at any cost includes a pessimistic, self-referential plot point for the journalist character and his filmmaker daughter"

Quezon,2216,9,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,"It succeeds at holding up a mirror to the audience members watching, who decry corruption and bad governance, but cannot suggest or invoke any alternative"
Quezon,2216,10,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,Quezon is a strong biopic and historical drama that satirizes politics through sensational slapstick moments starring some of the Philippines’ most known figures from the American period
Quezon,2216,11,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,"For a dialogue-heavy film, it’s thrilling to follow thanks to its playful structure, making it stand out from its two predecessors which were mainly linear and battle-focused"
Quezon,2216,12,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,What it didn’t really account for was the impact of Quezon’s actions
Quezon,2216,13,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,"It only focused on the political spectacle that worsens the state of the nation and makes the dream of independence unreachable, even laughable"
Quezon,2216,14,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,There’s a small scene where a farmer reveals that most people don’t understand what independence means
Quezon,2216,15,acebron,,140.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t explore beyond that — how the Filipino politicians and the American occupiers take advantage of this ignorance, what the average Filipino’s life is like, and why independence is such a pipe dream"

Quezon,2254,1,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"As the Bayaniverse concludes with the film Quezon, we are left to ponder: Who are truly considered heroes"
Quezon,2254,2,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"Does Heneral Luna—who, despite his temperamental and tactless nature, led his men to fight for the country at the cost of their own lives—fit the mold of a hero"
Quezon,2254,3,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"How about the composed and charismatic Heneral del Pilar, known for his loyalty to President Emilio Aguinaldo"
Quezon,2254,4,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"Or is it Manuel Luis Quezon, the first President of the Philippine Commonwealth, who relentlessly championed the nation’s independence"
Quezon,2254,5,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"Unlike the tension-driven Heneral Luna or the meditative Goyo, Quezon leans toward diplomacy and vision—the making of a statesman rather than a soldier"
Quezon,2254,6,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"Mon Confiado, reprising his role as El Presidente Aguinaldo, provides a strong emotional bridge across the trilogy"
Quezon,2254,7,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"His nuanced performance ties the films together with quiet power—a fitting irony, given how Aguinaldo outlived these three who once served under him"
Quezon,2254,8,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales, meanwhile, delivers a commanding portrayal of Quezon—a politician who knows how to play the game of politics, both as one of the chess pieces and as the one who moves them"
Quezon,2254,9,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,This may well be the most compelling performance of Rosales’ career
Quezon,2254,10,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"Rosales and Romnick Sarmenta, who plays Sergio Osmeña, show an undeniable chemistry that is utterly entertaining"
Quezon,2254,11,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"This dynamic between Quezon and Osmeña is refreshing to see, and is something that I just discovered from the film"
Quezon,2254,12,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"While the cast performed well and Tarog's vaudeville-inspired storytelling was interesting, there was no singular standout in the film"
Quezon,2254,13,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,The attempt to encapsulate Quezon's life after reading through 50 reference books made the narrative feel dense and uneven
Quezon,2254,14,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"The intent to inform and educate was there, but it came at the expense of smooth transitions and richer character development"
Quezon,2254,15,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"A minor subtitle error (""kada buwan"" translated as ""per year"") is forgivable, but the lack of emotional buildup for the audience was a missed opportunity"
Quezon,2254,16,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"Many historical moments were highlighted, yet the film fell short in conveying their emotional and moral implications"
Quezon,2254,17,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"Still, the complicated feelings I had after watching it are proof that the filmmakers succeeded in presenting a layered, complex figure in Quezon"
Quezon,2254,18,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"In the end, the Bayaniverse is more than a trilogy of historical films—it is a mirror reflecting who we were, who we are, and who we hope to become as Filipinos"
Quezon,2254,19,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"Through Luna's fury, Goyo's doubt, and Quezon's ambition, we are reminded that heroism is not born from perfection or victory, but from conviction and purpose"
Quezon,2254,20,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"Perhaps instead of searching for a hero to emulate or a leader to inspire today's generation, it may be far better to embrace a collective effort—despite our differences—to build the change we have long yearned for across generations"
Quezon,2254,21,rjbandres,,160.0,ltbx,"Tarog's decade-long storytelling, with all its flaws and brilliance, draws us back to the past that shaped us and rekindles our desire to strive for a nation better than the one we inherited"
Quezon,2255,1,zeemzowhat,,140.0,ltbx,"""mi querido"
Quezon,2256,1,gelodiem,,140.0,ltbx,lagi nalang tanggal angas ni osmeña kay quezon ah
Quezon,2257,1,gabofgreengable,,160.0,ltbx,The last entry in the Bayaniverse trilogy which aims to deconstruct historical figures
Quezon,2257,2,gabofgreengable,,160.0,ltbx,Kudos to the production design and the cast which was of high quality ever since Heneral Luna 10 years ago
Quezon,2257,3,gabofgreengable,,160.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales did very well in acting especially on his accent
Quezon,2257,4,gabofgreengable,,160.0,ltbx,The film showed Quezon as this political figure who was great in playing the politics game
Quezon,2257,5,gabofgreengable,,160.0,ltbx,I liked how Aguinaldo mentioned the difference between being a public servant and being a politician
Quezon,2257,6,gabofgreengable,,160.0,ltbx,It was interesting to see the dynamics of Casey and Serging (Quezon and Osmena) and I found their conversations amusing
Quezon,2257,7,gabofgreengable,,160.0,ltbx,"In my interpretation, the coin that Quezon gave to Joven is a form of utang na loob which is kind of rooted in our politics relating to the padrino system"
Quezon,2257,8,gabofgreengable,,160.0,ltbx,I wish that the patronage politics was explored a bit more though
Quezon,2257,9,gabofgreengable,,160.0,ltbx,"Personally, I would have liked this film even more if it had more runtime because a part of me felt they condensed all that they could into the movie runtime"
Quezon,2257,10,gabofgreengable,,160.0,ltbx,I hope TBA studios gets to have miniseries for more comprehensive storytelling
Quezon,2257,11,gabofgreengable,,160.0,ltbx,"All in all, congrats to the Quezon team and TBA studios for pulling off a wonderful Bayaniverse trilogy which I hope would just be the start of many more films to come"

Quezon,2264,1,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,"DAMNFirst of all, I would like to say I DID NOT EXPECT THIS MOVIE TO BE GREAT"
Quezon,2264,2,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,"I HATED THE TRAILER, I DIDNT LIKE THE FACT THAT IT WAS GONNA CENTER AROUND POLITICS AND NOT BRAVERY, HEROISM, AND JUSTICE FOR THE FILIPINOS"
Quezon,2264,3,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,"But oh my days I was so wrong, I love it sm (not Manuel Quezon obvi)"
Quezon,2264,4,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,This truly acknowledged the lack of information given to me about the presidents of the Philippines
Quezon,2264,5,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,"Politics truly is a silver lining, there is no good or bad, ""it's just politics"
Quezon,2264,6,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,""" This movie truly made the loudest statement of how corruption GREW in the Philippines but I have yet to research and make an informed opinion, but this— this was truly something"
Quezon,2264,7,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,"It isn't like the rest of the ""Bayani"" films I've watched— no war, no bloodshed, just politics"
Quezon,2264,8,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,Also shows how us voters HAVE to dig deeper on the track record of our candidates and CREATE informed decisions if whether or not their mistakes should be forgiven
Quezon,2264,9,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,It truly takes critical thinking to assess our presidential candidates if they truly wish the best for the people or they only wish the best for themselves
Quezon,2264,10,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,"I keep repeating about critical thinking, informed decisions, research, but I cannot stress this enough"
Quezon,2264,11,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,PEOPLE NEED TO LEARN TO READ MORE
Quezon,2264,12,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,"Anyways the movie was great, the overall aesthetic of the film was amazing"

Quezon,2264,14,rviia,,200.0,ltbx,Ps: I wrote this with a lot of thoughts in my head pls forgive me if it isn't organized enough or if my grammar is wrong
Quezon,2265,1,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,The last of the Bayaniverse trilogy unfolds almost in tension with the first
Quezon,2265,2,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"While Heneral Luna (2015) almost glorifies nationalism and patriotism as the purest routes to independence, Quezon exposes a more unsettling truth: that nation-building, too, can be an enterprise of deception, politicking, and personal ambition"
Quezon,2265,3,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,What struck me just as deeply was the film’s portrayal of the media
Quezon,2265,4,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"In the same way we inherited American politics and governance, we also inherited their media system"
Quezon,2265,5,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"In the film, the two are almost indistinguishable"
Quezon,2265,6,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"For Quezon, media is political machinery; politics, in turn, is media spectacle"
Quezon,2265,7,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"To its credit, Quezon is an unforgiving dissection of a cunning man long revered in Philippine history as the architect of constitutional democracy"
Quezon,2265,8,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"The film spares no illusions: it renders him not as a flawless hero, but as an American lackey who wielded independence as a political instrument for self-fulfillment"
Quezon,2265,9,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"In the buildup to his presidential campaign, he is almost canonized as a saint, a portrayal that feels eerily symmetrical to the myth-making that defines our politics of today"
Quezon,2265,10,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"I also think about Joven, how in Luna he was the youth whose fire needed to be fanned"
Quezon,2265,11,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"Now, in Quezon, he was the people, blamed for falling victim to — and almost being complicit for having benefitted from — the very system of patronage"
Quezon,2265,12,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"But the film offers more than this bobotante framing, as we observe Joven quite literally see through blind faith"
Quezon,2265,13,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"Although the film had the tendency to slip into a romanticized treatment of Aguinaldo, it compels reflection on our country’s institutional memory"
Quezon,2265,14,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"Why do we not know this Quezon: the ambitious, calculating politician beneath the marble statue"
Quezon,2265,15,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,Why have patronage and our reverence for the West endured as the constants that anchor our political imagination
Quezon,2265,16,pdfig,,160.0,ltbx,"And why, almost a century later, do we find ourselves in the same predicament, still circling the same myths of power and nationhood"
Quezon,2266,1,natsuyuki,,200.0,ltbx,"ON THE THIN LINE BETWEEN THE PLAYER AND THE GAME Politics—a word that replaced guns and ships in a war that’s been raging in our motherland, the Philippines, since the 19th century"
Quezon,2266,2,natsuyuki,,200.0,ltbx,"This film explores it with uncolored lenses—free of romanticism, yet filled with quiet truth"
Quezon,2266,3,natsuyuki,,200.0,ltbx,"Let’s dig into the visual cues Jerrold Tarog, the director, orchestrated with precision and purpose:  THE BLOCKINGTarog uses blocking as a mirror of Quezon’s state of mind"
Quezon,2266,4,natsuyuki,,200.0,ltbx,When he believes…
Quezon,2267,1,ichanko,,140.0,ltbx,didn't feel much pero i think it's good and i appreciate it especially with the bold decisions regarding the cinematography and especially the scoring which i think is really what i like about this movie
Quezon,2267,2,ichanko,,140.0,ltbx,it overall encapsulated (film) the ridiculousness of quezon's character and i love that for them
Quezon,2268,1,ikhyei,,160.0,ltbx,“being a hero is all about perspective”solid
Quezon,2268,2,ikhyei,,160.0,ltbx,"i didn’t expect that quezon has so many secrets that most of us didn’t know, it’s a good eye-opener especially to all the filipinos"
Quezon,2268,3,ikhyei,,160.0,ltbx,"isa lang ang nasa isip ko buong oras: wala paring nagbago, nagpapalinlang parin tayo sa mga trapo"
Quezon,2268,4,ikhyei,,160.0,ltbx,a good watch
Quezon,2268,5,ikhyei,,160.0,ltbx,it’s a perfect example of when a villain became a hero in people’s eyes
Quezon,2270,1,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,i like how the film showed how much impact journalism and cinema can have on people tho
Quezon,2270,2,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,"it’s honestly one of my favorite parts of the story, it really showed how powerful media can be when used right"
Quezon,2270,3,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,portrayal of women sa film were I guess accurate for its time
Quezon,2270,4,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,"tho i get that most of the wives ng mga historical figures natin talagang taga-alaga lang nila, but i kinda wish they gave them more depth pa rin"
Quezon,2270,5,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,very villain si quezon
Quezon,2270,6,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,jericho rosales was freaking amazing in this role
Quezon,2270,7,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,he nailed it
Quezon,2270,8,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,it’s giving leonardo dicaprio levels of intensity
Quezon,2270,9,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,congtv did not have to be part of that  so random
Quezon,2270,10,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,overall the movie was good
Quezon,2270,11,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,haven’t watched the other 2 movies of the bayaniverse but as a standalone this one’s okay naman
Quezon,2270,12,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,"not sure about its accuracy tbh since i don’t really know much about quezon, but it did make me curious to learn more about him"
Quezon,2270,13,theodredd,,140.0,ltbx,this makes you think about how history gets told… and who gets the spotlight
Quezon,2271,1,fwidom,,200.0,ltbx,Excellent music
Quezon,2271,2,fwidom,,200.0,ltbx,It's like Game of Thrones Philippine Commonwealth version
Quezon,2272,1,shaney2000,,180.0,ltbx,What fascinates me about history is that it's always driven by flawed people trying to fix what's broken — even when they’re part of the problematic system

Quezon,2278,1,famamfa,,140.0,ltbx,"Forgot there were a lot of annoying Jerrold-isms but once you get past it, it can be funny"
Quezon,2278,2,famamfa,,140.0,ltbx,"There are some distracting production inconsistencies and goofs (color, settings, shoes, and perhaps a visible boom operator) but overall I think it’s fine and enjoyable"
Quezon,2278,3,famamfa,,140.0,ltbx,The plus point five is the brownie point for the sheer willpower to keep producing films for The Culture™… one has to be serious about supporting other genres in Filipino cinema
Quezon,2278,4,famamfa,,140.0,ltbx,There is are two things I really liked
Quezon,2278,5,famamfa,,140.0,ltbx,"One is casting as a medium for message, where they use the same actor for two roles which I thought said more than the monologues about morality and politics"
Quezon,2278,6,famamfa,,140.0,ltbx,Two is the use of repetition to emphasize patterns in this very Filipino comedic way
Quezon,2278,7,famamfa,,140.0,ltbx,The faux beards and mustaches are atrocious though

Quezon,2281,5,endlessfolly,,200.0,ltbx,"HE'S EVEN IN A DOOMED TOXIC YAOI RELATIONSHIP WITH SERGIO OSMEÑA It's sad to see that the Philippines corrupt problems has always been there from the start and has never gotten better, the scene where Leonard Wood writes his report depresses me to see how little we as a country has changed"
Quezon,2281,6,endlessfolly,,200.0,ltbx,The film had such an amazing writing and acting and directing
Quezon,2281,7,endlessfolly,,200.0,ltbx,"LIKE THE WAY THE CAMERA MOVES AND TRACKS, THE LIGHTING, THE COLORS, THE FILM LOOKS SO GOOD"

Quezon,2284,1,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,“I am the Philippines”The clashing philosophy is the undercurrent that carries this movie
Quezon,2284,2,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,"It isn't explicitly delivered; it's not visible on the surface, but it is deeply embedded for those who look closely enough"
Quezon,2284,3,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,"We witness the vivid interpretation of the rise and fall of a truly great figure, supported by compelling storytelling"
Quezon,2284,4,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,"The cinematography is strong, the acting is excellent, and the production design is surely top-notch"
Quezon,2284,5,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,"However, I can recognize that the movie's portrayal was somewhat tempered"
Quezon,2284,6,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,"We move from a brutal Luna and the edginess of Goyo to a Quezon who feels more approachable, child friendly, fun, and bright"
Quezon,2284,7,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,"Perhaps this interpretation reflects an intentional focus on Quezon’s charisma, or maybe it’s simply how the filmmakers intended for us to view his specific burden"
Quezon,2284,8,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,I deeply admire the film's message—the political philosophy—and how acutely it mirrors our current government
Quezon,2284,9,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,It forces us to confront the question of how we arrived at this point
Quezon,2284,10,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,"The answer, the film suggests, is woven into our history; the seeds were planted long before we were born"
Quezon,2284,11,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,This system is so profoundly rooted that it cannot be simply plucked out
Quezon,2284,12,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,"This, right here, is absolute storytelling"
Quezon,2284,13,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,"The core concept isn't forcefully presented to the audience; instead, the film allows us to arrive at the message through our own contemplation"
Quezon,2284,14,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,"There is much more to discuss, but the direction and storytelling are what I loved most"
Quezon,2284,15,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,I can confidently say that those who see this as the least installment in the trilogy are missing the point
Quezon,2284,16,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,Each movie is a unique and great piece on its own
Quezon,2284,17,franzoysauce,,160.0,ltbx,"But Quezon—it delivers a sense of euphoria, emerging as a brilliant work of art that demands appreciation"

Quezon,2296,3,astraeallia,,140.0,ltbx,"Tarog and Vera’s criticism of the Philippine government and its people through this movie is something they’ve shouted at the viewers in the two previous films, but it’s more poignant this time"
Quezon,2296,4,astraeallia,,140.0,ltbx,"Through Rosales’ Quezon, they acknowledge at how tired they are with the same observation of indecent play that happens within politics—but of course they’re not gonna go down without putting up a good fight"

Quezon,2299,2,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"Just watched Quezon, and it awakened that history buff inside of me"
Quezon,2299,3,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"Like Heneral Luna and Goyo, this was well done"
Quezon,2299,4,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,It does complete the trilogy of what truly defines a political figure in the Philippine context
Quezon,2299,5,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"Its narrative and screenplay are peak, I adore the score, editing and art direction, and the production design was so good"
Quezon,2299,6,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"Very interesting to see the early days of pork barrel, patronage politics, media ""envelopes"", and dirty tricks"
Quezon,2299,7,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,Power play and mind game at its finest
Quezon,2299,8,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon, in its very core, is a film that presents itself as satirical, perhaps offering a timely commentary on the Philippines’ current political landscape and the ongoing struggle with personality politics"
Quezon,2299,9,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"Themes including power and ambition just resonate with contemporary issues in the Philippines, sparking important conversations about governance and nation-building"
Quezon,2299,10,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"I do commend Quezon’s portrayal here, as if he were a challenged hero who is worshipped"
Quezon,2299,11,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales’ portrayal of Quezon was commanding; he brought depth and nuance to the role, capturing the former president’s complexities and leadership style"
Quezon,2299,12,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"His performance conveyed the character’s passion, conviction, charisma, and flaws, making Quezon relatable and human"
Quezon,2299,13,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"In addition, Mon Confiado was quietly powerful as Aguinaldo"
Quezon,2299,14,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"While the film doesn't glorify Quezon, it reveals the cracks and how ambition can stain even the purest intentions until history decides whether you're an ideal or a sinner"
Quezon,2299,15,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,There is more to be discussed in the historical events depicted
Quezon,2299,16,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"Politics is a game of thrones, mula noon hanggang ngayon"
Quezon,2299,17,jhonaustria_,,160.0,ltbx,"Quirky, silly and indeed a good game"

Quezon,2304,1,redastro,,160.0,ltbx,Waited for this movie for maybe 8 years and I was not left disappointed
Quezon,2304,2,redastro,,160.0,ltbx,This is the historical drama I was waiting for and the depiction I never knew I wanted
Quezon,2304,3,redastro,,160.0,ltbx,This trilogy has proven and show that our heroes weren't perfect people
Quezon,2304,4,redastro,,160.0,ltbx,"They've done bad things, got their hands dirty, and burned bridges but they were also instrumental in building our nation"
Quezon,2304,5,redastro,,160.0,ltbx,"Sometimes, these heroes are also reflective of our nation and who we can be"
Quezon,2304,6,redastro,,160.0,ltbx,The Philippines has its share of problems but it's still a beautiful country and has the potential to be something great
Quezon,2304,7,redastro,,160.0,ltbx,"We might be just as imperfect as the heroes in Jerrold Tarog's trilogy were but just like them, we still have the capability to bring the country somewhere great"
Quezon,2304,8,redastro,,160.0,ltbx,"I hope that one day, we bring this country away from where it is right now and beat the corruption that plagues it"
Quezon,2304,9,redastro,,160.0,ltbx,"Besides that important lesson and theme I got from the movie, I think the movie is an amazing piece of Philippine cinema from its acting to the cinematography to the editing"
Quezon,2304,10,redastro,,160.0,ltbx,It's truly amazing
Quezon,2304,11,redastro,,160.0,ltbx,There were a few creative choices that I feel like could've been edited or shot better but I still think this movie is a masterpiece just like the other two in the trilogy

Quezon,2306,3,ianne_elle,,180.0,ltbx,But I love how these series humanizes our so-called “heroes”
Quezon,2306,4,ianne_elle,,180.0,ltbx,It encapsulate how the people on our money are merely just like us
Quezon,2306,5,ianne_elle,,180.0,ltbx,"They are not really heroes, just a human, a flawed human, who was only either put into a pedestal by their fellow countrymen or by themselves or both"

Quezon,2307,1,boop123,,140.0,ltbx,this is one of those films where i have to rewatch it for me to truly appreciate and cinematography and message dkjskks
Quezon,2308,1,rainyclear,,160.0,ltbx,Can’t unsee how Quezon (as portrayed by Jericho Rosales) acts and speaks like Chiz Escudero
Quezon,2308,2,rainyclear,,160.0,ltbx,"Quite fitting, since he helped create the blueprint for the politicians (NOT PUBLIC SERVANTS) we have today"
Quezon,2309,1,jeymsronn,,160.0,ltbx,"bruhh, the guy didn’t serve the system, he seduced it"
Quezon,2309,2,jeymsronn,,160.0,ltbx,"every move drips with manipulation, wit, and that intoxicating swagger only a fcking true political animal could pull off"

Quezon,2313,1,mariizpepito,,160.0,ltbx,ibang klase ka talaga tarog
Quezon,2314,1,gaaaand,,140.0,ltbx,"The time jumping could have been better done and the pacing was inconsistent, but mostly slow"
Quezon,2314,2,gaaaand,,140.0,ltbx,A bit too neat and simplified in the theming and storytelling with obvious goal to tie into the ending
Quezon,2314,3,gaaaand,,140.0,ltbx,Could have developed more naturally
Quezon,2314,4,gaaaand,,140.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales was great
Quezon,2315,1,lasperlorean,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon isn’t perfect, but it’s a meaningful addition to Filipino cinema’s take on its heroes"
Quezon,2315,2,lasperlorean,,140.0,ltbx,It’ll appeal most to viewers who like their history w/ nuance & aren’t looking for a straightforward hero-story
Quezon,2315,3,lasperlorean,,140.0,ltbx,"It doesn’t shy away from showing Quezon’s contradictions: idealism vs self-interest, leadership vs authoritarian streaks"
Quezon,2315,4,lasperlorean,,140.0,ltbx,The film invites reflection rather than worship
Quezon,2315,5,lasperlorean,,140.0,ltbx,Heneral Luna started the fire
Quezon,2315,6,lasperlorean,,140.0,ltbx,Goyo showed the cost
Quezon,2315,7,lasperlorean,,140.0,ltbx,Quezon’s the anti hero master stroke that perfectly wraps up the Bayaniverse trilogy
Quezon,2315,8,lasperlorean,,140.0,ltbx,"One small gripe: Iain Glen does his best as Leonard Wood, but the accent keeps playing hide & seek w/ the dialogue"
Quezon,2315,9,lasperlorean,,140.0,ltbx,"He’s commanding, sure, but his Scottish accent slips through just enough to break the illusion"
Quezon,2315,10,lasperlorean,,140.0,ltbx,"For a film committed to period accuracy, it’s funny how the one thing they didn’t localize was his vowels"
Quezon,2315,11,lasperlorean,,140.0,ltbx,"Maybe next time, just cast an American & spare Glen the vocal gymnastics"
Quezon,2317,1,joshuaadriann_,,120.0,ltbx,"ika nga ni joven, wala namang masama sa kompromiso, ngunit para kanino"
Quezon,2317,2,joshuaadriann_,,120.0,ltbx,"while the film strives to capture the weight and moral complexity of quezon’s leadership, it lacks the firm historical backbone needed to fully ground its narrative"
Quezon,2317,3,joshuaadriann_,,120.0,ltbx,i wished the film had delved deeper into the implications of the american occupation and quezon’s nuanced role within it
Quezon,2317,4,joshuaadriann_,,120.0,ltbx,jericho rosales really sounded like a politician who takes on charisma and commanding presence to gain people's trust
Quezon,2317,5,joshuaadriann_,,120.0,ltbx,"well, mon confiado is mon confiado"
Quezon,2317,6,joshuaadriann_,,120.0,ltbx,"tsaka, di na kailangan yung part ni cong"
Quezon,2317,7,joshuaadriann_,,120.0,ltbx,"nevertheless, films like this will always remain vital"
Quezon,2317,8,joshuaadriann_,,120.0,ltbx,they invite us to analyze and confront historical narratives being presented to us
Quezon,2317,9,joshuaadriann_,,120.0,ltbx,"in an era when political figures are often portrayed as heroes of their time, this film serves as a reminder of our responsibility to discern whether their legacies truly served the people’s best interests"
Quezon,2318,1,areatic,,200.0,ltbx,Incredible showcase of Quezon’s political mastery
Quezon,2318,2,areatic,,200.0,ltbx,"(At some point, I thought this was a love story between him and Osmeña…)"

Quezon,2322,1,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,I have nitpicks with this that I don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing:1
Quezon,2322,2,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,The execution of this was disorienting at first
Quezon,2322,3,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"Because all of a sudden it was theatrical, vaudeville, and full-on period"
Quezon,2322,4,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"But when the plot thickens, it suddenly makes sense — On how the politics at the time (let’s face it, until today), is just one big show and performance at stake of actual lives"
Quezon,2322,6,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,The timejumps was a bit confusing at first
Quezon,2322,7,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"When it jumped from film to life and back out again with no immediately understandable visual cues, it was snapping me out of the world"
Quezon,2322,8,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"But again, when the plot thickens, you kinda get the point"
Quezon,2322,9,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"This may be my personal issue, but it took me sometime to get to that point"
Quezon,2322,10,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"And my most major thing with this:I BOTH LOVE AND HATE, I AM BOTH AMAZED AND DISAPPOINTED, ALL AT THE SAME TIME - On how this reflects to until today"
Quezon,2322,11,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,This was basically the birth of a trapo
Quezon,2322,12,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"It says so in the film that this was the game of politics, showcased at large on how it was played, and how it evolved into the game of today"
Quezon,2322,13,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,What I hate most is that the main messaging of political idolatry is still a rampant and relevant message that still needs to be relayed to today
Quezon,2322,14,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"And mind you, this was more or less than 80 years ago"
Quezon,2322,15,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,How far we’ve gotten yet how slow our progress be
Quezon,2322,16,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"Also, I watched this one alone"
Quezon,2322,17,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"And I kinda regret that, which is a RARE reaction I get from watching a film (because I love watching films alone)"
Quezon,2322,18,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,But this is a discussion me and my friends had before that we may dive deeper into after this film: “Was the Philippines premature to be independent before
Quezon,2322,19,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,Should we have taken more time to be colonized
Quezon,2322,21,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"No ill-intent in that question, it is purely a curious question"
Quezon,2322,22,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"And one that was once again, sparked by this film"
Quezon,2322,23,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,"A thinktank, a conversation-igniter, which is how historical films should be"
Quezon,2322,24,kuyaed,,140.0,ltbx,Especially in a country like the Philippines

Quezon,2327,1,cjgohcruz,,200.0,ltbx,"10 years after Heneral Luna, the Bayaniverse trilogy is finally complete — and Jerrold Tarog delivers the best one yet"
Quezon,2327,2,cjgohcruz,,200.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales, while he looks nothing like Quezon, disappears into the character's cunning and charm"
Quezon,2327,3,cjgohcruz,,200.0,ltbx,"We need more films that, rather than glorify and lionize our heroes, instead provoke questions about why our country is the way it is"

Quezon,2338,1,pixelatedv,,200.0,ltbx,an illuminating way to end the trilogy
Quezon,2338,2,pixelatedv,,200.0,ltbx,"from luna and goyo challenging/questioning the very idea of a hero, the idea now hangs over the viewers with the cunning quezon like a full teacher-student-application cycle"
Quezon,2338,3,pixelatedv,,200.0,ltbx,they truly couldnt have problematized a character more positioned inconspicuously than quezon because he’s a walking contradiction of the nationalista party
Quezon,2338,4,pixelatedv,,200.0,ltbx,"the party name itself lends him the suspicion, honestly (and as it should be for everyone in a political party)"
Quezon,2338,5,pixelatedv,,200.0,ltbx,"but it’s really his pork barrel, patronage, and gross abuse of power all the more delayed ph independence"
Quezon,2338,6,pixelatedv,,200.0,ltbx,i loved studying quezon (admittedly more than rizal) back then and i love now that the film enjoys a layer of experimentation and harkens back to current events
Quezon,2338,7,pixelatedv,,200.0,ltbx,"again, quezon was the perfect final man for the trilogy because we see the semblances of his political manipulation and we still feel the context of colonial forces’ strong hold upon us, it’s just wildly more discreet"
Quezon,2338,8,pixelatedv,,200.0,ltbx,"the film was a transgression in both content and form, which is strikingly reflexive of how history (insofar as it’s PH history involved) ebbs and flows"
Quezon,2338,9,pixelatedv,,200.0,ltbx,it’s truly a must watch and i hope this becomes more accessible for Filipinos nationwide

Quezon,2341,3,selaera_star,,180.0,ltbx,"Ang pinaka obvious ay ang Chess, kung saan ang naglalaban ay ang panig ni Quezon para sa puti, at si Osmeña naman ang sa itim"
Quezon,2341,4,selaera_star,,180.0,ltbx,Isa sa mga paborito kong scene yung nasa isang malaking kwarto sila at tila naglalaro ng Chess para masukat kung sino ba ang mas ma-impluwensiya sa kanila

Quezon,2343,3,ariishay,,160.0,ltbx,"], which i appreciated a lot as someone who just freshly took kas 1 and had multiple encounters with the jones law"
Quezon,2343,4,ariishay,,160.0,ltbx,"of course not everything in the movie may be historically accurate, but the artistic touch makes it more digestible by an audience not as familiar with this point of history"
Quezon,2343,5,ariishay,,160.0,ltbx,"although there were lines or executions that seem questionable or out of place, the bigger picture was reallyy commendable"
Quezon,2343,6,ariishay,,160.0,ltbx,"what i like about the film is the morally grey depiction of quezon’s character—no excessive glazing and praising, but also not framing him as an enemy or villain"
Quezon,2343,7,ariishay,,160.0,ltbx,"it leaves you a looot of questions regarding his priorities, morals, and ethics"
Quezon,2343,8,ariishay,,160.0,ltbx,it was also interesting how they framed aguinaldo’s character—as someone who has always been an aguinaldo despiser lol
Quezon,2343,9,ariishay,,160.0,ltbx,"cinematically, the shots were beautiful and i love that"
Quezon,2343,10,ariishay,,160.0,ltbx,it was really well executed and visually pleasing

Quezon,2346,1,tenshi_wen,,200.0,ltbx,This is such a powerful film to be shown in our current time
Quezon,2346,2,tenshi_wen,,200.0,ltbx,The potryal of the way politics worked in the past is an almost complete reflection to the present
Quezon,2346,3,tenshi_wen,,200.0,ltbx,I love the fact that Quezon isn't shown as a protagonist that you wanted to cheer for all through out
Quezon,2346,4,tenshi_wen,,200.0,ltbx,"It captures the very idea of politics itself, its not black or white, it is a game in which in order to get what you want, you have to do some underhanded tactics"
Quezon,2346,5,tenshi_wen,,200.0,ltbx,Quezon himself knew how to play the game
Quezon,2346,6,tenshi_wen,,200.0,ltbx,"Lets talk about, Aguinaldo next, in this film he is tired and beaten down, he was out of his depth in challenging Quezon"
Quezon,2346,7,tenshi_wen,,200.0,ltbx,"Aguinaldo was characterized in which a part of you will feel sympathy for him, but makes you aware that everything that led to his downfall was through his actions"
Quezon,2346,8,tenshi_wen,,200.0,ltbx,"Overall, the other Characters are well acted and very on the point"
Quezon,2346,9,tenshi_wen,,200.0,ltbx,"As a long time history nerd, I would say this is a 10/10 film"

Quezon,2348,4,martitinay,,160.0,ltbx,i love nadia my film making queen
Quezon,2349,1,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"On the critique that Quezon (the film) is vague in its idea of independence:That's exactly part of MLQ's politics: the wielding of power is being the origin or source of a great idea, the new republic as a goal only Cassey can achieve"
Quezon,2349,2,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,That is how political campaigns are inspired
Quezon,2349,3,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,That's how devotion to political figures has taken its root
Quezon,2349,4,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,Whatever concept of freedom there is should appear like it's going to come directly from the politician
Quezon,2349,5,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"Independence being perceived as food conveys the idea that it's constantly asked, not fought for, by the masses that wait for 'ayuda' rather than the affirmation of their capacity to hold freedom in their hands"
Quezon,2349,6,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,And why is 'independence' or 'new republic' mentioned in the film like a byword
Quezon,2349,7,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,It's because Quezon wears it like a badge
Quezon,2349,8,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,But it serves a more important purpose: It floats as a concept that's never really understood
Quezon,2349,9,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,It remains to be a hollow idea associated with patriotism
Quezon,2349,10,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,So it continues to be talked about because it's never truly experienced
Quezon,2349,11,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,"Valid pa rin ang tanong na ""What is a new republic"
Quezon,2349,12,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,""" hanggang ngayon"
Quezon,2349,13,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,So it's odd to expect the film to define independence for us when what it does is actually more essential
Quezon,2349,14,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,We define it
Quezon,2349,15,denlebantino,,160.0,ltbx,I trust that we know how to
Quezon,2350,1,upcinema,,,ltbx,Sabi ni Cinemaster Nadz Amata:Simply an amazing film to end Tarog’s Bayani Trilogy
Quezon,2350,2,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Quezon harnessed the strengths of its predecessors Heneral Luna and Goyo, producing a film with strong storytelling, great actors, and awesome cinematography"
Quezon,2350,3,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Although he did not physically look like the mestizo Casey, Jericho Rosales delivered an enigmatic performance well-deserving of acting awards"
Quezon,2350,4,upcinema,,,ltbx,"But among its merits, perhaps my favorite thing about Quezon is its pointed delivery of political critique not only towards the current administration but to the long history of corrupted, patronizing, and self-serving Philippine politics"
Quezon,2350,5,upcinema,,,ltbx,"I know for sure that it is not only me who feared that Quezon would end up sanitizing the former president’s image, as films about politicians and heroes tended to do so"
Quezon,2350,6,upcinema,,,ltbx,"But alas, Quezon was not usual biopic that mythologized the man — instead, it demystified him, reintroducing the former President that plastered his and his wife’s name all over his home province and the biggest city in Metro Manila"
Quezon,2350,7,upcinema,,,ltbx,"It was able to effectively deliver Manuel Luis Quezon as the cunning politician, borderline dictator that he is"
Quezon,2350,8,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Alongside his intelligent spiels and populist rhetoric, the film revealed the unapologetic and manipulative character of the 2nd President of the Philippine Republic — the man who laid the formula of political maneuvering for the politicians and would-be presidents after him, proving Alfred McCoy’s view that Quezon’s Commonwealth paved the way for Philippine authoritarianism"
Quezon,2350,9,upcinema,,,ltbx,I do hope that Tarog continues to develop new historical fiction films in the future
Quezon,2350,10,upcinema,,,ltbx,"More than ever, we need more films that tackle and communicate our history in interesting ways that provoke the audience to revisit our past and reexamine our stances on our ‘great’ men"

Quezon,2354,1,aleilina,,160.0,ltbx,"news flash, quezon was the BLUEPRINT on how to be a TRAPO"
Quezon,2354,2,aleilina,,160.0,ltbx,"fueled by remorseless charisma, endless antics, and 'utang na loob' schemes that never seemed to run out"
Quezon,2354,3,aleilina,,160.0,ltbx,"traditional politics in the country has been forcely ingrained within our culture where filipinos greatly suffered from the power-hungry politicians, presenting it as a fight for independence"
Quezon,2354,4,aleilina,,160.0,ltbx,"what i didn't like about the film is how they didn't emphasize the role americans played, and somewhat leaned towards blaming our own demise to the filipinos itself"
Quezon,2354,5,aleilina,,160.0,ltbx,"but i believe, to put it quite plainly, we have never been truly free from the colonialism"
Quezon,2354,6,aleilina,,160.0,ltbx,"however, as my sister would say, ""take it with a grain of salt"", because even if it is grounded by history, it is still a work of fiction at malaking bahagi pa rin ang artistic values ng direktor at lahat ng naging parte sa pag buo nito"

Quezon,2357,3,iscbelles,,160.0,ltbx,"i love that they leaned so much into the theatrics given the time period quezon was in, the vaudeville and old hollywood influences were on full display + rody vera on the screenplay says so much"
Quezon,2357,4,iscbelles,,160.0,ltbx,i had my doubts about jericho at first but i’m glad he proved me wrong and i enjoyed his take on all the powerplays and social games that quezon did in his lifetime
Quezon,2357,5,iscbelles,,160.0,ltbx,kinda wanna do a rewatch of heneral luna and goyo now + watch this again to see how it all comes together and do a comparison on each film’s visual and narrative style

Quezon,2358,2,wenkwonkdinky,,160.0,ltbx,"some nitpicks about the artistic choices made, but the non-linear storytelling was definitely the best choice as it kept me on my toes with connecting all the dots towards Quezon's rise to presidency (and fall from grace)"

Quezon,2365,2,raffyduffy,,160.0,ltbx,"It has a jumpy storyline, jumping from different timelines in Quezon’s life"
Quezon,2365,3,raffyduffy,,160.0,ltbx,"Imo it’s not up to par with its prior bayaniverse movies (Heneral Luna goat), but the cinematography, theatrics, and plot delivery are surely Jerrold Tarog’s forte"

Quezon,2367,1,thanatosfiel,,200.0,ltbx,What a way to close out the Bayaniverse trilogy
Quezon,2367,2,thanatosfiel,,200.0,ltbx,"From the ultraviolent chaos of Heneral Luna, to the somber introspection of Goyo, Quezon rounds things off as a psychological thriller-slash-political comedy-slash-drama that’s as ambitious as it is sharp"
Quezon,2367,3,thanatosfiel,,200.0,ltbx,What I’ve always admired about Jerrold Tarog’s depiction of these historical figures is how human they are
Quezon,2367,4,thanatosfiel,,200.0,ltbx,"There are no pure heroes here—only flawed men navigating ambition, ego, and nationhood"
Quezon,2367,5,thanatosfiel,,200.0,ltbx,"Quezon, played brilliantly by Jericho Rosales, is a political gamemaster: part statesman, part showman, and wholly cunning"
Quezon,2367,6,thanatosfiel,,200.0,ltbx,"I love that the film doesn’t dwell on textbook achievements, but rather on the intricate dance of manipulation, charm, and power that defined his leadership"
Quezon,2367,7,thanatosfiel,,200.0,ltbx,"Like the best Filipino historical films of recent memory, Quezon reflects its own era back at us—the politics of then echoing the politics of now, for better or worse"
Quezon,2367,8,thanatosfiel,,200.0,ltbx,"And while it’s billed as the end of the Bayaniverse, I hope this isn’t an exclamation point, but a comma—especially after that tantalizing post-credits tease"
Quezon,2368,1,mityardbirds,,160.0,ltbx,"Here we begin with a shapeshifting exploiter on one hand and a docile, equally ambitious prowler on the other, juggled and brandished to trade barbs and heave vitriol at each other, both would later dismiss as mere politics to justify a much-needed partnership, then finding a common enemy in a chagrined former revolutionary leader and president"
Quezon,2368,2,mityardbirds,,160.0,ltbx,"The ping-pong exchange of politicking and smear campaigns is its most coruscating part—electrifying to me, actually—a protracted look at our current politics' saddening origin"
Quezon,2368,3,mityardbirds,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon—now that there is no need for battle pieces, as that is not Tarog's turf—is the most polished in the entire trilogy, only slightly tarnished by its caricature bits and overreliance on fictional characters"
Quezon,2368,4,mityardbirds,,160.0,ltbx,The decision to minimize young Joven's speaking lines saves the entire cast's immaculate efforts from futility

Quezon,2380,10,mikespectah,,160.0,ltbx,quezon opened my mind to such fact that he might've sold our country to gain longer period of power and control
Quezon,2380,11,mikespectah,,160.0,ltbx,"kumbaga kung si aguinaldo was bad, then quezon was worst; and thats how i saw it"

Quezon,2403,5,wormbrained,,120.0,ltbx,so good
Quezon,2403,6,wormbrained,,120.0,ltbx,i always think about how the las casas resort in bataan is probably thrilled whenever there's a new historical filipino film or show being shot
Quezon,2404,1,manicsprout,,160.0,ltbx,Jack En Poy
Quezon,2405,1,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,It was so fascinating to see the things I've learned in history books be dramatized in film
Quezon,2405,2,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"What a time to be alive to witness a trilogy of films that tells a story of heroes, but also deconstruct them, showcase them as three-dimensional characters, as people and not as good guys up on pedestals"
Quezon,2405,3,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"The change of tone from the seriousness and war setting of Heneral Luna and Goyo to the more modern setting of Quezon threw me off, but also had me engaged"
Quezon,2405,4,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,Especially with the way they make a meta-commentary of the power of film and media to portray these stories
Quezon,2405,5,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales is wonderful to see on screen as MLQ, and Romnick Sarmienta as Sergio Osmeña showed a fun dynamic--almost like a romantic couple--between Quezon and Osmeña"
Quezon,2405,6,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,The non-linear storytelling was also a change that I had to adjust after re-watching the first two in preparation for this
Quezon,2405,7,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"Thankfully, there are title cards and chapters that serve as good guide posts for the pacing of the story"
Quezon,2405,8,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"Speaking of story, as this film spanned a longer timeframe compared to the two, it's written to showcase more vignette-type and montage-style of events rather than the more straightforward storytelling in Luna and Goyo"
Quezon,2405,9,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"While it's not a bad thing, it can be difficult to keep track of while watching"
Quezon,2405,10,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, pacing is an issue as some parts dragged and other moments could've used more time to absorb its messaging"
Quezon,2405,11,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,The showcase of Quezon's con artistry and showcasing him as a chameleon is done very well
Quezon,2405,12,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,This movie was really a battle of wits instead of arms--and it truly showcased the Filipino political culture
Quezon,2405,13,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,The production and set design were done incredibly well
Quezon,2405,14,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,A lot of effort was put to make this a period piece
Quezon,2405,15,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"While some seams and cracks can be seen here-and-there, those can be mostly ignored and do not hinder my enjoyment of the film"
Quezon,2405,16,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"There isn't that much bloodshed and prosthetic wounds to be seen here, but more on CG buildings, vehicles, and recreation of period appropriate settings and props"
Quezon,2405,17,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"---SPOILER THOUGHTS---I think they could've had a Mabini scene somewhere as having Aguinaldo, Joven, Rusca, and Janolino weren't enough connective tissue for me to fully connect this movie with the previous two"
Quezon,2405,18,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,The Alerta storyline and Nadia filmmaking storyline could've been tighter as these were the parts that dragged the most
Quezon,2405,19,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"Though I do appreciate having this fictional plot point to give commentary on the importance of film, media, journalism, and media literacy--I do think this could be polished more and make less preachy"
Quezon,2405,20,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"In the previous films, I didn't feel like I was being banged with the head with all of its messaging because of how beautiful the writing is and how its themes weave together with its characters"
Quezon,2405,21,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"In here, that magic was kinda muddled a bit"
Quezon,2405,22,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,But there were still some scenes and lines that made such a good impact on me
Quezon,2405,23,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"His abrupt death and shouting into the abyss, left me dissatisfied to be honest"
Quezon,2405,24,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"Both Luna and Goyo's death were shown on-screen while here, it's just implied and presented to us through text"
Quezon,2405,25,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,I would've loved to see him actually die in his sleep or something or maybe have Osmeña receive the news and take his place and then have the epilogue of the movie there
Quezon,2405,26,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"Lastly, all three films had some sort of subplot of the protagonist having some sort of affair"
Quezon,2405,27,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,I think Aurora Quezon was underutilized here
Quezon,2405,28,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,Luna's affair with Isabel makes sense as the character was an amalgamation of various women in Luna's life
Quezon,2405,29,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,Goyo's love affairs with Felicidad and Dolores were the most poetic and beautifully done juxtaposed with the sacrifices of war
Quezon,2405,30,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,Quezon's love for Aurora and the affair with Ana Ricardo was so tense but not as strong as I would like it to be as both women were more plot device than actual characters
Quezon,2405,31,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,---END OF SPOILER THOUGHTS---Quezon is a great film and I am thankful to have watched it on the big screen
Quezon,2405,32,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"I think it is the weakest of the trilogy, but it still has its redeeming qualities"
Quezon,2405,33,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,"It can be frustrating in a negative sense with some of the complaints I have, but this film and the entire Bayani-verse trilogy of movies are frustrating in the positive sense--as ALL three were well-written to present themes, lessons, and events that are still relevant to this day"
Quezon,2405,34,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,These films show history but as so well-crafted to mirror the political issues we have at present
Quezon,2405,35,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,I don't want this to be the last film
Quezon,2405,36,cary_domiii,,160.0,ltbx,I do hope there are more stories to tell and themes to explore in our history
Quezon,2406,1,tenderjershey,,160.0,ltbx,ONE TRAPO AFTER ANOTHER si quezon ang blueprint ng mga trapo
Quezon,2406,2,tenderjershey,,160.0,ltbx,walang pinagkaiba sa nangyayari ngayon sa pilipinas na ang daming politician pero kakaunti lang ang public servant
Quezon,2406,3,tenderjershey,,160.0,ltbx,"ginagawang laro ng mga politician ang politika para sa kapangyarihan, pero sa huli pawang mga pilipino pa rin ang natatalo at tila ba’y sumpa ang isilang sa pilipinas"
Quezon,2406,4,tenderjershey,,160.0,ltbx,panahon na para ang taong bayan naman ang manalo
Quezon,2406,5,tenderjershey,,160.0,ltbx,"i love the artistic direction on this film, ang ganda nung concept na film within a film, peak storytelling sha for me, ibang-iba ‘yong storytelling niya compare sa mga naunang bayaniverse (heneral luna at goyo) para siyang oppenheimer ng pinas the way it unfolds everything HAHAHAHA and may touch ng wes anderson ‘yong scoring and camera movement (sana gets n’yo ako)"
Quezon,2406,6,tenderjershey,,160.0,ltbx,husay ni direk tarog
Quezon,2406,7,tenderjershey,,160.0,ltbx,makikita mo talaga na mahal ng director ang paggawa ng pelikula

Quezon,2406,9,tenderjershey,,160.0,ltbx,galing ni jericho rosales
Quezon,2406,10,tenderjershey,,160.0,ltbx,"jumpscare lang talaga si congtv, the concept of a unithieves supporter being in a historical film about corruption"
Quezon,2407,1,rvncrtz,,160.0,ltbx,I have mixed feelings about the narrative but the technicals are topnotch for me
Quezon,2407,2,rvncrtz,,160.0,ltbx,"In my two hours plus inside the theater, Quezon became the Quezon to my Osmeña"
Quezon,2408,1,zwenbwi,,80.0,ltbx,gusto ko sana maging sobrang interested sa panonood pero naiirita ako sa boses ni jericho tsaka nakakaantok manood ng last show HAKAGAJAGAKAHAMAHAalso ginagawa mo cong

Quezon,2410,1,poch101,,200.0,ltbx,I'm all here for dialogue-heavy movies with beautiful visuals becoming the next big thing in PH cinema
Quezon,2410,2,poch101,,200.0,ltbx,Lowkey wish there was enough time to see more of WWII-era Quezon facing his final days
Quezon,2410,3,poch101,,200.0,ltbx,"Enthralled throughout the entire thing, I especially enjoyed the tribute to early cinema"
Quezon,2411,1,tilaluha,,200.0,ltbx,quezon we love to hate you(more elaborate thoughts in my comments)
Quezon,2412,1,123gir_hermione,,180.0,ltbx,I really enjoyed this movie
Quezon,2412,2,123gir_hermione,,180.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales doesn't really look like Quezon, I was really hesitant at his casting first especially as the original Quezon TJ Trinidad (and even the younger Quezon Benjamin Alves as well as Apolinario Mabini actor from previous Bayaniverse films Epy Quizon) looks more similar to the real Quezon, but Jericho did really make up for his acting"
Quezon,2412,3,123gir_hermione,,180.0,ltbx,"I love how the political tactics and intrigue are made with comedic timing, keeping audiences interested in the screen"
Quezon,2412,4,123gir_hermione,,180.0,ltbx,I thought Mon Confiado was really perfect as Quezon and Iain Glen's special appearance as Governor General Leonard Wood was fantastic
Quezon,2412,5,123gir_hermione,,180.0,ltbx,"I thought Karylle's Aurora Quezon doesn't have much to do in the movie, but I was really impressed with her acting especially when she realized Quezon's first ""wife"" was in the same event as her and Quezon"
Quezon,2412,6,123gir_hermione,,180.0,ltbx,"The movie seems to be based strongly on facts, but I couldn't find from my research information about this so called first ""wife"" of Quezon before Aurora"
Quezon,2412,7,123gir_hermione,,180.0,ltbx,But I do think she was used very well in the plot of this movie
Quezon,2412,8,123gir_hermione,,180.0,ltbx,The fictional characters Joven Hernando and his daughter Nadia are well used in this movie as well
Quezon,2412,9,123gir_hermione,,180.0,ltbx,They are intended to represent the audiences (especially Filipino audiences as their Filipino history shown in this movie is still relevant today)
Quezon,2412,10,123gir_hermione,,180.0,ltbx,Overall a great third movie in Jerrold Tarrog's Bayaniverse movie films (along with 2015's Heneral Luna and 2018's Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral)

Quezon,2416,1,louiese,,160.0,ltbx,"“Maraming politiko sa bansa, ngunit kakaunti lamang ang tunay na lingkod-bayan"
Quezon,2416,2,louiese,,160.0,ltbx,"”This movie reveals the harsh reality behind politics in the Philippines—how cheating and greed have embedded into the country’s system, and how these practices have been normalized until now"
Quezon,2416,3,louiese,,160.0,ltbx,"It shows how our government fight for independence, only to end up imprisoning its own people under self-serving leadership"
Quezon,2416,4,louiese,,160.0,ltbx,This film should also serves as an eye-opener to every Filipino— to remind that today’s news about our government is merely a repetition of what has already happened in the past
Quezon,2416,5,louiese,,160.0,ltbx,"Ang tunay na kalayaan ay hindi natin makakamtan sa mga kamay ng dayuhan, kundi sa paglaya sa mga politikong patuloy na pinaiikot ang mga Pilipino sa bulok at madumi nilang sistema"

Quezon,2417,1,lykajgp,,160.0,ltbx,great cinematography
Quezon,2417,2,lykajgp,,160.0,ltbx,i love how the visual storytelling made the historical anecdotes even more dynamic and just as tense as they were reported
Quezon,2417,3,lykajgp,,160.0,ltbx,i also liked the performances of the leading cast
Quezon,2417,4,lykajgp,,160.0,ltbx,i also genuinely appreciated that there are no saints on pedestals under jerrold tarog’s spotlight
Quezon,2417,5,lykajgp,,160.0,ltbx,"(also, on a more personal note, i got to watch this film with my work friends in the director’s club, which was also my first time doing so )"

Quezon,2419,3,gabe_legaspi127,,120.0,ltbx,But overall a fun dramatization but lacking character study and critique of Quezon and the bayani mythos
Quezon,2420,1,kinginamoto,,200.0,ltbx,Eto Naaaaa

Quezon,2427,16,amarieyolla,,200.0,ltbx,Ang ganda
Quezon,2428,1,warabihime,,180.0,ltbx,"Comical and entertaining yet carried out its message and substance; politics has long before fueled by self-interest, unending lust for power, and varieties of propaganda"
Quezon,2428,2,warabihime,,180.0,ltbx,The film also portrayed the power of media (visual & written) and how it can easily influence the decisioning of a citizen
Quezon,2428,3,warabihime,,180.0,ltbx,Kudos to the actors how they greatly embodied their characters
Quezon,2428,4,warabihime,,180.0,ltbx,"Overall, this is a great watch"
Quezon,2429,1,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,"the writing, visual production, and sound design were so, so sharp; it was impossible to be bored, even for a film that centered around talking politicians"
Quezon,2429,2,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,ang galing
Quezon,2429,3,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,"maybe not my favorite out of the three in the bayaniverse, but i do believe it to be the most relevant as its closest to our present reality today"
Quezon,2429,4,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,it very effectively punctures our lack of regard for some of the earliest developments of our current republic
Quezon,2429,5,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,it then became a great illustration of how the governance and systems we face today doesn’t fall far from the tree (unfortunately)
Quezon,2429,6,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,"in that sense, the film is a lot less emotionally moving compared to its counterparts in the trilogy"
Quezon,2429,7,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,"instead, it was moreso unsettling: and maybe that’s the point"
Quezon,2429,8,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,"history is not merely the study of the past, but it is also how the present came to be and continues to evolve as we speak"
Quezon,2429,9,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,"moreover, heroes are but names we give to very much real people with a human capacity for malice and fault"
Quezon,2429,10,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,much credit to jerrold tarog for the bayaniverse trilogy
Quezon,2429,11,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,"had it not been for general luna, i’d not have gone on history deep dives in my free time (because unfortunately the last time we had proper philippine history as a class was in grade 6)"
Quezon,2429,12,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,we’re often apprehensive to approach history as the mere thought of the many big names and events intimidate us — especially when we think that history is just dead people and shit that went down years ago
Quezon,2429,13,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,"but what if we just don’t realize that history is actually, very much as well, the now"
Quezon,2429,14,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,quezon (2025) is a great ender to the trilogy because it cements such idea
Quezon,2429,15,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,it’s chilling to think about how time has passed and how much has stayed the same
Quezon,2429,16,cinnabert,,160.0,ltbx,"thinking about it all has made me unsettled (which, again, i think is the point)"
Quezon,2430,1,0518sunbeam,,200.0,ltbx,a detail that im fixated on about this movie is quezon’s use of the word “independence”
Quezon,2430,2,0518sunbeam,,200.0,ltbx,he uses the idea of it as a bluff and it’s almost like a tell in his strategy for the game that people somehow fall for time and time again
Quezon,2430,3,0518sunbeam,,200.0,ltbx,"it almost becomes a kind of semantic satiation, with the amount of times he promises it, it starts losing its meaning –said meaning already being completely misunderstood, or at least, understood without the weight and depths and nuances of it"
Quezon,2430,4,0518sunbeam,,200.0,ltbx,another side of his promise for independence of the philippines is how the film rounds the statement up by the end with quezon screaming “i am the philippines” –the implication of his life’s work only being dedicated to a kind of independence for Himself and not for the country…
Quezon,2430,5,0518sunbeam,,200.0,ltbx,manjesus christ the amount of times i wanted to pull my hair out at anytime i am reminded this shit is still happening Right Now watching this film feels like being shot 47498 timespota ang ganda nakakagalitfjfjfalso: quezon calling osmeña mi querido and osmeña replying with barely contained lust…
Quezon,2430,6,0518sunbeam,,200.0,ltbx,jerrold tarog WILL have historical yaoi in every movie in the bayaniverse
Quezon,2431,1,blobeche,,200.0,ltbx,"not sure about historical accuracy, but left the cinema in absolute awe"
Quezon,2431,2,blobeche,,200.0,ltbx,"i thought my attention span couldn't handle the 2 hrs, but they did some magic right there"
Quezon,2431,3,blobeche,,200.0,ltbx,"we need more movies like this, beautifully cinematic and piques audiences to learn more about our country's history"

Quezon,2434,4,amwirosa,,160.0,ltbx,actually insane
Quezon,2434,5,amwirosa,,160.0,ltbx,"his ambition was insane, he probably did want independence fr but the hunger for power definitely overrode that to an extent"
Quezon,2434,6,amwirosa,,160.0,ltbx,"like just really enjoyable overall, i wasnt bored and it was fun and informative"

Quezon,2439,2,aaronconci,,120.0,ltbx,ig the historical facts may not all be accurate pero the idea na may mga controversial ways din pala siya para lang manalo gave a sour taste sa image niya as a person and as a president

Quezon,2440,4,new_romantics12,,180.0,ltbx,The movie deals with history and politics but at the same time it’s not boring
Quezon,2440,5,new_romantics12,,180.0,ltbx,"It feels witty, and fun"
Quezon,2440,6,new_romantics12,,180.0,ltbx,I also really liked the musical scores so much

Quezon,2442,2,berryxaff,,100.0,ltbx,"there are numerous reasons in which individuals desire to enter politics, but not everyone is really a public servant"
Quezon,2442,3,berryxaff,,100.0,ltbx,you have to possess tremendous power to influence in order to become such a powerful individual
Quezon,2442,4,berryxaff,,100.0,ltbx,"my opinion is that many who become so influential are not exercising this power for good governance, rather for personal interests"
Quezon,2442,5,berryxaff,,100.0,ltbx,"this thinking can bring about patronage politics, corruption, and insensitivity to the needs of the people(which is actually happening rn)"
Quezon,2442,6,berryxaff,,100.0,ltbx,It's sad to see people put personal interest ahead of the common good
Quezon,2442,7,berryxaff,,100.0,ltbx,"this film sheds some light on this aspect by depicting the shrewd personality of Manuel Quezon, our first president commonwealth president(that’s why andaming palang proposed constitution, and yung transition about tydings-mcduffie act hindi tinuro sa’min kung what was the real story behind those numerous revisions and amendments)"
Quezon,2442,8,berryxaff,,100.0,ltbx,"It depicts how his calculated and shrewd politics influenced the country's history, but at the same time points out the ambiguity between heroism and manipulation"
Quezon,2442,9,berryxaff,,100.0,ltbx,the film instigates us to challenge our understanding of historical icons and what it actually means to be a hero

Quezon,2469,1,httphelena,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon, in terms of storytelling, is different from the approach of Heneral Luna and Goyo"
Quezon,2469,2,httphelena,,180.0,ltbx,"Not that the previous films were set during the war for independence and Quezon was more about words, but Tarog’s treatment here was somewhat different"
Quezon,2469,3,httphelena,,180.0,ltbx,What I appreciate about this new approach is its new perspective
Quezon,2469,4,httphelena,,180.0,ltbx,"In this film, we see Quezon through the lens of Nadia’s works, portrayed as both a hero and a shrewd politician — a duality reflected by the people around him like Joven, who seem like spectators to his life"
Quezon,2469,5,httphelena,,180.0,ltbx,"The storytelling feels more playful yet sharp, much like the mind games shown in the film, which perfectly capture his wit and sly character"
Quezon,2469,6,httphelena,,180.0,ltbx,I also liked the use of the title card inspired by the silent era in the sequence that introduces Quezon — a clever way to bridge the past and the present
Quezon,2469,7,httphelena,,180.0,ltbx,"The scenes of love-hate tension between him and Osmeña, his attempts to outsmart Leonard Wood, and his feud with Aguinaldo make us, as viewers, feel like spectators in this grand game of politics"
Quezon,2469,8,httphelena,,180.0,ltbx,"Despite the seriousness of the subject, the humor and comedic tone remain, giving the film a lighter touch — something I truly appreciate"
Quezon,2469,9,httphelena,,180.0,ltbx,"It also highlights the absurdity of politics, showing how politicians can sometimes be clowns themselves"
Quezon,2469,10,httphelena,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon is definitely a film worth watching in cinemas
Quezon,2469,11,httphelena,,180.0,ltbx,"I also appreciate its cinematography and sound design, which add so much to the overall narrative"
Quezon,2470,1,lemnathanerena,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon is less about defining a hero and more about what a hero isn't
Quezon,2470,2,lemnathanerena,,180.0,ltbx,"With no guns and battles this time, Tarog's final film in the trilogy relied on a well-written screenplay and a brilliant direction and editing"
Quezon,2470,3,lemnathanerena,,180.0,ltbx,This felt polished and grand
Quezon,2470,4,lemnathanerena,,180.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales plays Quezon masterfully with his unmatched charisma and mischievous persona

Quezon,2487,6,migseu,,160.0,ltbx,"There’s a bit of camp, even excess, but it works"
Quezon,2487,7,migseu,,160.0,ltbx,"Politics has always been a performance in the Philippines anyway, and this film leans right into that"
Quezon,2487,8,migseu,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s not afraid to show Quezon as both idealist and egotist, leader and manipulator"
Quezon,2487,9,migseu,,160.0,ltbx,"The movie calls out how he perfected the art of political spectacle, something we’re still drowning in today"
Quezon,2487,10,migseu,,160.0,ltbx,"At times, it gets too caught up in that same spectacle, focusing on power plays more than the people affected by them, but maybe that’s part of the point"
Quezon,2487,11,migseu,,160.0,ltbx,What stings most is how familiar it all feels

Quezon,2489,5,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,One thing’s very clear: this movie is made with passion and love
Quezon,2489,6,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"Every aspect, production design, costume, music, sound design, acting, and screenplay, everything feels precise and deliberate"

Quezon,2489,9,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,I also appreciate that the film didn’t contradict anything from the previous installments
Quezon,2489,10,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"There’s no unnecessary retcon, and even smaller roles were reprised by the same actors (except for Joross Gamboa as Eduardo Rusca, previously played by Archie Alemania)"
Quezon,2489,11,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"Hindi ko nga agad napansin na siya pala iyon until I checked online, still, I appreciate his inclusion"
Quezon,2489,12,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"What leaves me conflicted, however, is how the narrative perspective centers on Joven"
Quezon,2489,13,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"He’s a good character, pero minsan nawawala ang connection natin kay Quezon"
Quezon,2489,14,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"Unlike the first two films where we clearly see the world through the minds of Luna and Goyo, dito parang ikinukuwento lang sa atin ang nararamdaman ni Quezon"
Quezon,2489,15,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,That sometimes creates a bit of emotional distance
Quezon,2489,16,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"I get that the film wants to show that our heroes are just as flawed and human as we are, and I love that message, but I wish we could’ve seen more of Quezon’s inner struggle"
Quezon,2489,17,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,The non-linear structure works surprisingly well
Quezon,2489,18,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"Kahit medyo gimmicky, it adds flavor to the storytelling, especially since we already know where the story is headed"
Quezon,2489,19,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,Jericho Rosales delivers a powerful and charismatic performance as Quezon
Quezon,2489,20,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"Mon Confiado also brings his A-game, while Cris Villanueva, Arron Villaflor, and Rominick Sarmenta shine in their respective roles"
Quezon,2489,21,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"For Iain Glen, I honestly feel another actor could’ve played the part, but it’s still commendable that they brought in a respected Hollywood actor for the role"
Quezon,2489,22,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"Overall, Quezon is a strong and passionate film"
Quezon,2489,23,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"It may be overly ambitious at times, occasionally losing sight of its identity, but its heart is in the right place"
Quezon,2489,24,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"The message remains powerful: kahit ilang taon na ang lumipas, tila hindi pa rin nagbabago ang mga Pilipino"
Quezon,2489,25,franciscores,,140.0,ltbx,"And if ever this isn’t truly “the end,” I hope we still get to see more stories from the Bayaniverse, especially with that mid-credit scene tease"
Quezon,2490,1,invenire_,,200.0,ltbx,"It was a good film, though I'm still trying to understand why some consider it to be the weak link in the Bayaniverse trilogy"
Quezon,2490,2,invenire_,,200.0,ltbx,It's actually a wonderful movie
Quezon,2490,3,invenire_,,200.0,ltbx,"Confiado's delivery was excellent, it even brought me to tears because you could truly feel how he fought back against political corruption in the Philippines"
Quezon,2490,4,invenire_,,200.0,ltbx,"I'm not just talking about the character, but this actually reflects our society today and how we struggle and fight against corrupt politicians"

Quezon,2524,18,muybiennn,,140.0,ltbx,"Despite being dialogue-heavy, the lines are witty and written with a style similar to the Bayaniverse"
Quezon,2524,19,muybiennn,,140.0,ltbx,"I also like the aesthetic; it reminds me of Wes Anderson (very subtle) and the likes with its use of symmetry, colors, and scores"
Quezon,2524,20,muybiennn,,140.0,ltbx,"​Ultimately, we are shown the humane side of our celebrated heroes"
Quezon,2524,21,muybiennn,,140.0,ltbx,"While we appreciate what they've done for our country, we should not be blind to consider them human—not idols, not kings, not gods"

Quezon,2528,1,kdaniel007,,200.0,ltbx,"As someone who is a history geek, I find it a bit disappointing as they did not show or explain the historical context on why Quezon did what he did during that time, he was portrayed as conniving, ambitious, arrogant and power-hungry which was mostly true but also adding more context also adds more layer to the character, and also shows a different side to him"

Quezon,2539,5,mbloodt,,160.0,ltbx,"I think we've gone past the idea of portraying a benevolent leader in film, especially in today's political climate, though that Quezon's Game movie kinda did that, but this approach with its series of quarreling is a lot more interesting to me, which has been the motif of this series, anyway"

Quezon,2592,2,gabsaulog,,160.0,ltbx,"I also appreciate how it made me reexamine what we were taught in Social Studies growing up, as seeing the story told through a different lens allowed for a thoughtful reexamination of Philippine history, our devotion to heroism, and how our entire political system can be traced back here"
Quezon,2592,3,gabsaulog,,160.0,ltbx,"One could feel Jericho Rosales’ commitment to the role — especially as we get to see a more fleshed out depiction of our National hero, even as we witness his character take a darker turn by the film’s third act"
Quezon,2592,4,gabsaulog,,160.0,ltbx,"The score was also quite good, and I’m just as impressed by the astounding production and costume design"
Quezon,2592,5,gabsaulog,,160.0,ltbx,Thoroughly enjoyed this one of all the Bayaniverse films thus far :) Note: Also Jericho Rosales came in for a surprise appearance after our screening

Quezon,2602,1,silentcinephile,,180.0,ltbx,"Director Jerrod Tarog delivers another masterpiece in the Bayaniverse with a showcase in filmmaking excellence in acting, cinematography, editing, production and costume design"
Quezon,2602,2,silentcinephile,,180.0,ltbx,I was initially thrown off by Jericho Rosales and Romnick Sarmienta's accents (never bothered to check if that's how Quezon and Osmena sounded in real life) but they're 2 of today's best actors that I eventually appreciated how they fully embodied their respective roles
Quezon,2602,3,silentcinephile,,180.0,ltbx,"Ditto Mon Confiado as Aguinaldo, Karylle as Doña Aurora, JC Santos as Roxas, and even Cris Villanueva as fictional character journalist Joven Hernando"
Quezon,2602,4,silentcinephile,,180.0,ltbx,It was also nice to see Iain Glen (Jorah Mormont in Game of Thrones) play Governor-General Wood
Quezon,2602,5,silentcinephile,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon's bantering/arguments with both Osmena and Wood were quite amusing/entertaining
Quezon,2602,6,silentcinephile,,180.0,ltbx,Also commend the shift in tone which was like a breath of fresh air in telling a Pinoy historical drama (sort of reminded me of Mike de Leon's 'Bayaning 3rd World' which also starred Villanueva)
Quezon,2602,7,silentcinephile,,180.0,ltbx,"But if I were to nitpick, I'd note that if Luna and del Pilar were humanized in their respective biographical war dramas, Quezon was villainized here as the idealistic patriot fighting for Philippine independence turned scheming, power hungry politician"
Quezon,2602,8,silentcinephile,,180.0,ltbx,"Yes, this film showed that the country has been (prodominantly) run by politicians, not public servants"

Quezon,2603,3,yhunnie,,160.0,ltbx,The most notable thing about this trilogy is how many times I’ve admittedly said “Hindi ko alam na ganito pala sila…” which makes the storytelling even more compelling

Quezon,2609,1,vincengyu,,80.0,ltbx,"Love Jericho Rosales and Mon Confiado in this, and I particularly like what the film has to say about (the origins of) patronage politics and strongman politics in the Philippines and their intertwined history with colonialism, and when the film is actively trying to make us think what constitutes heroism (is a strongman un-photographed in his weaker moments the same strongman captured on magazine covers"

Quezon,2618,2,aberllyann,,160.0,ltbx,hell yeah relieved na hindi
Quezon,2618,3,aberllyann,,160.0,ltbx,Also it felt so theatrical and alive pa
Quezon,2618,4,aberllyann,,160.0,ltbx,When the credits started rolling it concluded with RAMON MAGSAYSAY Campaign song it got me chill talaga
Quezon,2619,1,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"YOU CAN’T LOSE WITH QUEZONAfter three watches, I can safely say one thing: I have so many thoughts about the Quezon movie, and yet so little words to convey it in"
Quezon,2619,2,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,I wrote so many passages down in my notebooks
Quezon,2619,3,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,All of them half-finished or just me arguing with myself trying to make sense of what I was feeling
Quezon,2619,4,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,I’ll try my best to write them here
Quezon,2619,5,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"The Bayaniverse, one of my favorite Filipino movie series, has finally come to a close with (arguably) one of their best movies yet"
Quezon,2619,6,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,Quezon veers away from the usual historical biopic formula and moves into the territory of being a social commentary
Quezon,2619,7,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"Instead of the “event A happened, so event B follows” format, Quezon asks us to sit with discomfort"
Quezon,2619,8,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"Rather than simply glorifying its subject, the movie presents a national hero who reflects the leaders we have now"
Quezon,2619,9,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"A visionary who fought for Filipino independence, yet, a calculating statesman who mastered the performance of politics"
Quezon,2619,10,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"Charming when needed, ruthless when required, and deeply aware of optics"
Quezon,2619,11,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"I see the movie as something that doesn’t necessarily paint Quezon in a necessarily evil nor corrupt light, but as a pragmatic who knew that idealism alone could not dismantle a colonial-imperialism system built on inequality"
Quezon,2619,12,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"That pragmatism, however, is exactly what built the foundations of our current political structure"
Quezon,2619,13,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,What does that say about our national heroes
Quezon,2619,14,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,What does that say about the kinds of people we choose to enshrine and remember
Quezon,2619,15,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"Most importantly, what does that say about us"
Quezon,2619,16,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,The Quezon we see in the movie is not simply Quezon–he’s also the collective psyche of the nation that produced him and the time that he lived in
Quezon,2619,17,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"He lived under an imperialist, racist U"
Quezon,2619,20,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"As the movie perfectly states, “Quezon may not have made the game, but he sure did play it"
Quezon,2619,21,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,”I think Quezon challenges the comfort that we have in hero worship
Quezon,2619,22,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,It dares us to look at power
Quezon,2619,23,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"Not as a moral test or a path to self-actualization, but as a mirror to who we are as a nation going through growing pains"
Quezon,2619,24,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,Is it worth acknowledging that building a road to greatness often comes with destroying whatever comes ahead
Quezon,2619,25,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"The real message of the Bayaniverse, in my opinion, is that the nation was not built by perfect saints"
Quezon,2619,26,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"It was also built by people who have the tendency to be selfish, flawed, ambitious, and painfully human"
Quezon,2619,27,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,The series tells us that our understanding of heroism must mature as we continue to mature as a nation
Quezon,2619,28,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"On a more personal note, I will never forget the feeling of watching it on the big screen"
Quezon,2619,29,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,What an amazing movie
Quezon,2619,30,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"The dialogue is witty, suspenseful, and human"
Quezon,2619,31,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,Another thing I love about it is the casting

Quezon,2619,38,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,I’ve been told that I have the tendency to go insane about the things I love
Quezon,2619,39,th0ughtcriminal,,200.0,ltbx,"I’m not a movie person, but I’d love to go to the theater to watch it again, but that’d require me to open my commissions (and so, I’m opening my commissions to watch it again)"
Quezon,2620,1,vandyne1,,180.0,ltbx,It is undeniable that Quezon was depicted as a power-hungry egoistical person in this film
Quezon,2620,2,vandyne1,,180.0,ltbx,"If you think about it, the film unfolds based on the journalist’s perspective"
Quezon,2620,3,vandyne1,,180.0,ltbx,"Both on different sides of the coin, but then again, it was the same coin"

Quezon,2620,7,vandyne1,,180.0,ltbx,"Now about the movie, the cinematography is noticeably visibly great"
Quezon,2620,8,vandyne1,,180.0,ltbx,Even the details tell a story and are so hard not to miss
Quezon,2620,9,vandyne1,,180.0,ltbx,"the color grade, the camera movement, the aesthetics, and the pacing, all on point"
Quezon,2620,10,vandyne1,,180.0,ltbx,Jerrold Tarog showed me a fresh new perspective that makes me want to go down the rabbit hole and watch all his films
Quezon,2620,11,vandyne1,,180.0,ltbx,hehe I think I just fell in love with history
Quezon,2620,12,vandyne1,,180.0,ltbx,"Quezon is definitely a film worth watching, I am even considering rewatching it now"
Quezon,2621,1,gabapizza,,160.0,ltbx,"toxic doomed yaoi aside, i really do love how they made this"
Quezon,2621,2,gabapizza,,160.0,ltbx,SS classes taught us on wrong lies… Glad to see and recognize that ever since may mga kurakot sa gubyerno natin
Quezon,2622,1,migsfilmreviews,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon feels like a well-crafted film that Jerrold Tarog put a lot of effort into, both in writing and directing"
Quezon,2622,2,migsfilmreviews,,160.0,ltbx,Rosales’s performance as the lead really stands out and carries the movie
Quezon,2622,3,migsfilmreviews,,160.0,ltbx,"Visually, it’s a treat with a unique old-school style and great production design that captures the early 1900s vibe perfectly"
Quezon,2622,4,migsfilmreviews,,160.0,ltbx,"The story also creates a good amount of intrigue, even if some parts aren’t perfectly executed"
Quezon,2622,5,migsfilmreviews,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite its flaws, it’s an interesting watch because of its strong visuals and engaging narrative"
Quezon,2622,6,migsfilmreviews,,160.0,ltbx,"Overall, Quezon is a solid film that shows real craftsmanship and is worth a watch"

Quezon,2630,2,jayehanash,,140.0,ltbx,the film offers a sharp critique of the deeply rooted filipino concept of utang na loob and exposes how it can distort the ideals of governance and public service
Quezon,2630,3,jayehanash,,140.0,ltbx,"what once began as a moral virtue, a sign of respect and loyalty, becomes a political instrument that undermines integrity, opening the door to corruption, favoritism, and blind allegiance"
Quezon,2630,4,jayehanash,,140.0,ltbx,"it challenges viewers to reflect on how certain filipino values, while culturally meaningful, can be misused to sustain systems of power that work against true progress"
Quezon,2630,5,jayehanash,,140.0,ltbx,"at the same time, the film also confronts a difficult truth: it’s not easy to question or turn away from this cycle, especially when one is personally benefiting from those in power"
Quezon,2630,6,jayehanash,,140.0,ltbx,"comfort and convenience can blur one’s moral vision, making it hard to see the injustice hidden behind acts of generosity"
Quezon,2630,7,jayehanash,,140.0,ltbx,"it takes courage and self-awareness to break free from that dependence, to open one’s eyes and choose integrity over personal gain"
Quezon,2631,1,heartscript,,180.0,ltbx,"It depicts how, even long before, politicians have always been performative when it comes to their propaganda just to appear pleasing to the people"
Quezon,2631,2,heartscript,,180.0,ltbx,"Human as we are, Filipinos as we are, we tend to be easily blinded by whatever “truth” is presented to us, especially when it aligns with our values and principles"
Quezon,2631,3,heartscript,,180.0,ltbx,"What struck me most (in the worst way possible) and I was genuinely flabbergasted was the case with his first wife and how he defended himself in court, saying something along the lines of, “Does this face really need to rape someone"
Quezon,2631,4,heartscript,,180.0,ltbx,” It shows how contradicting his principles already were
Quezon,2631,5,heartscript,,180.0,ltbx,You cannot fight for your country if you are struggling to be humane yourself
Quezon,2631,6,heartscript,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon took Filipinos as nothing but mere tools for him to gain power

Quezon,2631,13,heartscript,,180.0,ltbx,"Is it the lesser evil for the Philippines to barely progress under Filipino rule, rather than to thrive under an American one"
Quezon,2631,14,heartscript,,180.0,ltbx,"This isn’t to claim that the latter would be preferable, rather, it’s to assert that we deserve a government that upholds both, a competent leadership and a genuinely Filipino sense of governance"

Quezon,2642,2,nourmean,,180.0,ltbx,The movie itself is the statement
Quezon,2642,3,nourmean,,180.0,ltbx,"Heneral Luna and Goyo have already fixed our expectation/s on how this will turn out: a valorous exhibit on the lives of ""national heroes"" that shaped Philippines as we know it; setting a preliminary idea that it will follow the same pattern about building Quezon as a major contributor of our independence"
Quezon,2642,4,nourmean,,180.0,ltbx,"Yet, as it turns out, the movie stitches reflective points gauging on what these historical acts truly mean to us and the manner as to how these information precipitated through our minds"
Quezon,2642,5,nourmean,,180.0,ltbx,"A magnified look into Quezon as an individual, almost overshadowing the historical context within them opens up a rare opportunity for critiqe against our national heroes"
Quezon,2642,6,nourmean,,180.0,ltbx,"Oftentimes, we are trained to consume knowledge as quick as light, yet there is lesser existential emphasis that allow us to reject passivity in learning"
Quezon,2642,7,nourmean,,180.0,ltbx,"I am too drowsy to add more (i will edit this soon tho), but I really enjoyed thinking about a lot of things such as the state of Philippine politics, statehood, and the lingering wonder as to what truly constitus a hero and power as recursive influence on the trajectory of history and how its viewed"

Quezon,2665,1,tadpaul,,160.0,ltbx,"How painful it is to see this film validate one of my biggest fears about trying to make it in this country: that the only real way to succeed is by taking advantage of an unjust and cruel system, one that requires you to bring down others to bring yourself up"
Quezon,2665,2,tadpaul,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s more than just “crab mentality”; it’s systemic and rooted deep within, right into this country’s body and soul"
Quezon,2665,3,tadpaul,,160.0,ltbx,"So when the character of Quezon, an ambitious man who benefitted from (and allegedly originated) the country’s rotten practices, shouted “I am the Philippines”, I was inclined to believe him"
Quezon,2665,4,tadpaul,,160.0,ltbx,"On a side note, I’ve always wanted to see more Filipino movies about politicking — which is why the feature scripts I’ve written tackle it extensively — and so this was such a feast for me"
Quezon,2666,1,gmargaux,,180.0,ltbx,okay let's dissect how the movie is a depiction of how it was before and is now
Quezon,2666,2,gmargaux,,180.0,ltbx,"first of all, may naitulong naman talaga si Quezon pero it was not only for the country but also for himself to have powersecond, meron talagang mga politiko na gagawa-gawa ng masama tapos kapag binalikan na sila ng ginawa nila and mas malala yung na-experience nila parang sila pa kawawalastly, I just feel that this movie was really a call for accountability to those who has the power to make a difference but don't and that's what's happening right now"
Quezon,2666,3,gmargaux,,180.0,ltbx,(I really need to go back and read books about our history kasi search talaga ako ng search while watching this movie haha)

Quezon,2670,2,mirroaror,,180.0,ltbx,anyway yes
Quezon,2670,3,mirroaror,,180.0,ltbx,idk where to start
Quezon,2670,5,mirroaror,,180.0,ltbx,"I already came into this fully expecting to be hit with the bleakness of our history, especially when it came to politics"
Quezon,2670,6,mirroaror,,180.0,ltbx,and I was right
Quezon,2670,9,mirroaror,,180.0,ltbx,"im pretty sure that a big part of the film was satire, but it still took the critique towards quezon (and Philippine politics in general) quite seriously"
Quezon,2670,10,mirroaror,,180.0,ltbx,"it was also nice how they managed to comment on how corruption also exists even amongst the ""unbiased"" media or journalists"
Quezon,2670,11,mirroaror,,180.0,ltbx,but yes
Quezon,2671,1,anon_w,,200.0,ltbx,considering its the 3rd film in the franchise— it stands for itself and breaks the chronological style of goyo and heneral luna :))
Quezon,2672,1,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,what's amazing about this film is how it handles pacing
Quezon,2672,2,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,everything here is just political drama
Quezon,2672,3,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,"no war, no action, no theatrics"
Quezon,2672,4,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,but they made it so entertaining to watch
Quezon,2672,5,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,there was no single dull moment
Quezon,2672,6,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,"the direction was very clear and precise, the cinematography is very creative, the production design was stellar, and the performances are just chefs kiss especially jericho rosales as quezon"
Quezon,2672,7,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,i was hesitant about his casting when it was first announced but im glad to be proved wrong
Quezon,2672,8,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,he just oozes with this charm that slowly blura the line between him and his character
Quezon,2672,9,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,and the writing supporting it and the story as a whole is amazing
Quezon,2672,10,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,the language and those political banters are quite like music
Quezon,2672,11,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,kinda like sorkin's writing style
Quezon,2672,12,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,and the music is as fun as the film itself
Quezon,2672,13,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,whats even crazier is that those two things are behind one person
Quezon,2672,14,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,"and despite its greatness, this film is still far from a documentary or a biography"
Quezon,2672,15,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,its a character study of a fictional character based from a real person
Quezon,2672,16,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,"if you look at it as a history lesson, its not that"
Quezon,2672,17,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,it greatly shows us how flawed a person is and it now our job to do the research over the real thing
Quezon,2672,18,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,the bayaniverse is a great trilogy and i hope it doesnt stop
Quezon,2672,19,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,looking forward to magsaysay
Quezon,2672,20,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,"and also, just a funny thought, i cant help but give it similarities to hamilton"
Quezon,2672,21,ethandc,,180.0,ltbx,this whole film just gives off that loud energy of hamilton's 2nd act
Quezon,2673,1,kakerts,,160.0,ltbx,"healthy: wood x aguinaldotoxic: quezon x osmena :(anyways i enjoyed this film, just wish it was more apparent on what point it was in the timeline bc i was confused af at first bc there were minor differences lng in their appearances"

Quezon,2680,2,angelotantuico,,160.0,ltbx,Rosales gives an incredibly layered performance exploring the gray areas of history that weren’t in our textbooks
Quezon,2680,3,angelotantuico,,160.0,ltbx,"As someone who’s a sucker for talkie historical/political dramas, there’s a lot to love"
Quezon,2680,4,angelotantuico,,160.0,ltbx,"Production design and costuming were fantastic, the score was propulsive without being overbearing, and Tarog’s blocking of his actors scratched my brain"
Quezon,2680,5,angelotantuico,,160.0,ltbx,"For a movie that’s over two hours long, I barely felt the runtime"
Quezon,2680,6,angelotantuico,,160.0,ltbx,This is something I can see myself watching again and again
Quezon,2680,7,angelotantuico,,160.0,ltbx,"Also really cool bonus that Echo came for a surprise appearance at the end of the film, he even recognized me from a shoot we had a couple of months ago"

Quezon,2683,2,julia_carelle,,160.0,ltbx,"The art form of films was well integrated to show how Quezon masterfully used smoke and mirrors to hide his knife and cloak personality, a tactic well used today in the modern theatrics of politics"
Quezon,2684,1,jethe12th,,160.0,ltbx,walang nagbago sa bansa taena wahahaha
Quezon,2685,1,golden_screen,,160.0,ltbx,I’ve watched this film three times… chariz
Quezon,2685,2,golden_screen,,160.0,ltbx,"Bro’s angry for a film about his ‘lolo’ na di naman nya naabutan because Casey died in America, lol"
Quezon,2686,1,louisenavidad,,180.0,ltbx,"‘Quezon’ is a recognition and better understanding of the effects of the colonial past, of divide and rule tactics, of how Quezon is only a fraction of the whole patronage system, despite the suggestion that he might be its founding father haha and maybe the more impt question to think about now is what can we do given this history and present"
Quezon,2686,2,louisenavidad,,180.0,ltbx,"This after natin itanong (at masagot) kung bakit kaya nagalit ang apo If anything, it’s the family’s right to share their sentiment as much as it is the filmmakers’ right to tell the story based on what books and historians say"
Quezon,2686,3,louisenavidad,,180.0,ltbx,The reaction of the family member now feels like it only proves how Quezon keeps his legacy as a good stage director
Quezon,2687,1,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"The film’s most intriguing throughline lies in Manuel Quezon’s (Jericho Rosales) exchanges with Joven Hernando (Arron Villaflor as the young journalist, Cris Villanueva as the older one)"
Quezon,2687,2,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"Joven, who once idolized Quezon, becomes his conscience and later his accuser, returning a coin once given to him as a symbol of principle"
Quezon,2687,3,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,Their relationship encapsulates writer-director Jerrold Tarog’s grand question: can integrity survive intimacy with power
Quezon,2687,4,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"It’s through Joven’s eyes that we watch the statesman’s transformation into strongman, his lofty rhetoric curdling into patronage politics"
Quezon,2687,5,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"When Quezon shuts down Joven’s newspaper for publishing an exposé, the betrayal stings not only as political allegory but as personal tragedy—the loss of faith in leadership itself"
Quezon,2687,6,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"What I found most striking here (and which I strongly feel is the film’s strongest aspect) is how Tarog, through Joven’s eyes, frames Quezon as the unwitting architect of a system that still defines us"
Quezon,2687,7,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"Joven suggests that while Quezon didn’t invent patronage politics, he definitely perfected its choreography: every favor disguised as friendship, every handshake turned into hierarchy"
Quezon,2687,8,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,The film doesn’t condemn him outright for this; it simply watches how such pragmatism metastasizes into a national reflex that still nags at us today
Quezon,2687,9,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"In one exchange, Quezon insists that principle must bend to survival, a line that feels less like justification than prophecy"
Quezon,2687,10,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,Tarog lets that sentiment resonate across the film like a curse
Quezon,2687,11,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"We see it in the way Quezon rewards loyalty with access, in the quiet humiliation of those who refuse to play along, and in the hollow triumph of independence negotiated rather than fought for"
Quezon,2687,12,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"The movie’s politics are cyclical, almost fatalistic: power breeds corruption, corruption demands compromise, and compromise becomes governance"
Quezon,2687,13,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"Tarog doesn’t spell this out; he lets it unfold in the pauses between alliances and betrayals, in the small intimate silences that follow Quezon’s public victories"
Quezon,2687,14,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"Joven’s arc, meanwhile, becomes our moral compass—a journalist who believes truth can coexist with patronage, only to learn that one always consumes the other"
Quezon,2687,15,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,His disillusionment is as national as it is personal
Quezon,2687,16,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"By the time he returns the coin Quezon once gave him, the gesture feels both intimate and historical, like a nation finally returning the debt of false ideals"
Quezon,2687,17,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"Tarog’s “Bayaniverse” has always traced this erosion, but here it feels complete: Quezon may have built the country’s first Republic, but he also built the template for its recurring undoing"
Quezon,2687,18,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,What the film ultimately suggests is that corruption in the Philippines isn’t an aberration—it’s an inheritance
Quezon,2687,19,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"Quezon’s genius wasn’t that he corrupted the system, but that he understood how to make corruption look like leadership"
Quezon,2687,20,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"His brand of “opportunistic nationalism,” as historians have called it, didn’t die with him; it evolved, refined by each successor who learned the same survivalist grace"
Quezon,2687,21,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"Tarog’s gaze isn’t accusatory, though"
Quezon,2687,22,paulenicola,,120.0,ltbx,"It’s almost elegiac, as if recognizing that Quezon’s contradictions—his brilliance, his vanity, his compromises—are also ours"

Quezon,2690,2,shekinahreign_,,160.0,ltbx,"aside from all three being informative, i’d say quezon successfully integrated different types of media arts, something uniquely different from the other two, plus it had an A-list lineup of actors"

Quezon,2693,8,wowfuc,,140.0,ltbx,Just way too cringe to see from so many actors in so many different movies throughout different decades
Quezon,2693,9,wowfuc,,140.0,ltbx,"Is it so difficult to have/demand good acting — or better yet, to demand acting that’s just ‘not too bad’"
Quezon,2693,10,wowfuc,,140.0,ltbx,"We are an expressive, emotional, and humorous people, yet our actors portray their characters like semi robots in every movie"

Quezon,2695,2,iamsuperjosef,,180.0,ltbx,"Joven’s character (and his team/family) brought just the right amount of drama, and the film’s lens made me rethink how we see our “heroes,” or even a “political figure” or “public servant"
Quezon,2695,3,iamsuperjosef,,180.0,ltbx,"” There were so many quotable lines, but honestly, I can’t even recall one right now; it was just that good"

Quezon,2698,2,joaquinmerc,,160.0,ltbx,"That decision by Tarog feels even more apt with the mixed reaction to the ""rant"" of Quezon's grandson"
Quezon,2698,3,joaquinmerc,,160.0,ltbx,"I guess the silver lining of all this is the creation of a discourse not just about the film itself, but the way it's created and received too"

Quezon,2702,1,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"As the final chapter of Jerrold Tarog’s Bayaniverse trilogy, Quezon wraps things up in a way that’s both bold and refreshing"
Quezon,2702,2,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"I went into this with zero expectations since it didn’t get much buzz, but honestly, it’s a must-watch even if you haven’t seen Heneral Luna or Goyo"
Quezon,2702,3,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"It may not be as explosive or emotionally charged as Heneral Luna, nor as poetic as Goyo, but its quirky, satirical tone gives it a distinct identity that stands strong alongside the first two films"
Quezon,2702,4,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,Seeing Quezon’s story unfold beyond the pages of history books is fascinating
Quezon,2702,5,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"Tarog leans into dark humor and sharp political satire, exposing the manipulative, chaotic world of power struggles — Quezon versus fellow politicians and the Americans"
Quezon,2702,6,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,This isn’t your typical biopic; it’s a political farce where Jericho Rosales’ Quezon treats nationhood like a rigged game only he can win
Quezon,2702,7,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"He lies when needed, bends the truth to his advantage, and embodies both heroism and hypocrisy"
Quezon,2702,8,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,What makes this film stand out is its honesty
Quezon,2702,9,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,It doesn’t glorify Quezon
Quezon,2702,10,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"it exposes his flaws, ambition, and contradictions"
Quezon,2702,11,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"The inclusion of media’s role in shaping narratives adds another layer, reminding us that there are always two sides to every story"
Quezon,2702,12,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,The line “heroism is just a perception” sums it up perfectly
Quezon,2702,13,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"Jericho Rosales is phenomenal here that you forget you’re watching him, he is Quezon"
Quezon,2702,14,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"Mon Confiado as Aguinaldo, and the actors portraying Osmeña and Roxas, all deliver sharp, grounded performances that complement the film’s tone"
Quezon,2702,15,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"The ending hits hard with its satirical bite, when Quezon declares, “I am the Philippines"
Quezon,2702,16,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"” Tarog leaves it open to interpretation, but to me, it’s a powerful commentary on power, ego, and politics — on how even noble intentions can rot when corrupted by greed"
Quezon,2702,17,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,A hero proclaiming that he is the country becomes the same figure consumed by its flaws
Quezon,2702,18,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s ironic, timely, and uncomfortably reflective of the state of our nation today"
Quezon,2702,19,airowoo,,160.0,ltbx,"Quezon isn’t just a political film — it’s a mirror held up to our nation, to our leaders, and to ourselves"

Quezon,2705,1,lncrxv,,200.0,ltbx,"arguably the noisiest film in the bayaniverse trilogy — in terms of how battles were fought through psychological and political warfare in the screen, up to upfront confrontations of the actual descendants and the cast and creators of the film"
Quezon,2705,2,lncrxv,,200.0,ltbx,"it's fascinating for how a two-hour film spnning decades of history did not feel dragging, if at all"
Quezon,2705,3,lncrxv,,200.0,ltbx,"instead, quezon sparked conversations once again on how should we question the figures we once revered, revealing to us that these people we see in our banknotes and statues were still the same cast of characters we see in the headlines today"
Quezon,2705,4,lncrxv,,200.0,ltbx,"and that to me, is its long-lasting impact to the national conversation today"

Quezon,2720,2,soondaefriez,,140.0,ltbx,While Manuel Quezon remains as a polarizing figure in Philippine history what Quezon offers is trying to show both sides of the coin
Quezon,2720,3,soondaefriez,,140.0,ltbx,That Manuel Quezon has his fair share of contribution to the independence of the country while also not turning a blind eye to his ill deeds
Quezon,2720,4,soondaefriez,,140.0,ltbx,While the film is historically accurate and strong with its references to past events what drags it down is the fictional dramatization for story build-up purposes
Quezon,2720,5,soondaefriez,,140.0,ltbx,My personal fave in this movie hihi that I loved how they told the narrative of the movie within a movie itself (this may make or break the viewing experience depends on the audience preference however in my case it worked
Quezon,2720,7,soondaefriez,,140.0,ltbx,"What confused me, though, was how the film tried to paint Emilio Aguinaldo as a noble hero despite the long-standing accusations against him"
Quezon,2720,8,soondaefriez,,140.0,ltbx,"Still, as a self-proclaimed history nerd, this film was a feast for my brain and how it challenged, debunked, and reanalyzed so much of what I thought I knew"

Quezon,2727,2,kenexp,,140.0,ltbx,I think my only gripe about this movie is that Joven Hernando had too much to do with the events of the movie unlike in the previous films where he was mostly just a stand in for the audience
Quezon,2727,3,kenexp,,140.0,ltbx,I also think that the movie has painted Quezon too much of a bad guy instead of remaining neutral

Quezon,2733,2,izcy,,160.0,ltbx,Amazing representation of the story line and the history behind to one of the people that's considered as 'one of the best' presidents of the Philippines
Quezon,2733,3,izcy,,160.0,ltbx,A literal definition of machiavellianism despite his genuine beginning and his contribution to the Philippines
Quezon,2733,4,izcy,,160.0,ltbx,A huge eye opener to those who worship Quezon's administration and the bat-shit crazy circus behind the political veil in our government that's still evident today lol

Quezon,2736,1,decadentrebel,,180.0,ltbx,A bit better than Heneral Luna and ties together all the themes established from the first two movies
Quezon,2736,2,decadentrebel,,180.0,ltbx,"Siyempre andiyan pa rin yung mga ""audience surrogate"" scenes in which the characters engage in dialogue that's artificial instead of letting the audience figure it out for themselves"
Quezon,2736,3,decadentrebel,,180.0,ltbx,"Case in point: yung kumakain sina Joven, Rusca, Carmen at Nadia while mansplaining that being educated doesn't mean you cannot be fooled"
Quezon,2736,4,decadentrebel,,180.0,ltbx,"Also, I don't understand getting miffed by Quezon's portrayal in a negative light — deconstruction is the whole shtick of the ""Bayaniverse"""
Quezon,2736,5,decadentrebel,,180.0,ltbx,It's intended to serve as counterpoints to the textbooks that mythologize historical figures
Quezon,2736,6,decadentrebel,,180.0,ltbx,Hindi naman siya malicious
Quezon,2736,7,decadentrebel,,180.0,ltbx,They're humans after all and politics is intrinsically dirty and ugly
Quezon,2736,8,decadentrebel,,180.0,ltbx,Quezon even correctly points out that Joven is a hypocrite for trying to cast stones
Quezon,2736,9,decadentrebel,,180.0,ltbx,May false equivalence pa yung relative na under Trump daw tayo if Quezon didn't push for independence

Quezon,2737,1,dj_teves13,,160.0,ltbx,"Aside from pacing issues and a few tonally distracting melodramatic beats, I thought Quezon was a remarkable Philippine production that dared to confront the contradictions behind one of the country’s most celebrated leaders"
Quezon,2737,2,dj_teves13,,160.0,ltbx,"""Quezon"" is a historical epic and political tragedy about idealism corrupted by power and how the dream of nationhood becomes tangled in propaganda and ego"
Quezon,2737,3,dj_teves13,,160.0,ltbx,I think it is essential viewing for anyone interested in Philippine history

Quezon,2772,3,judd_ashley,,160.0,ltbx,the visuals are insane and the cast
Quezon,2773,1,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,I finally watched Quezon with my family after we got the time to see it in the cinema
Quezon,2773,2,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,It is the final and third film released after Goyo which was shown seven years ago
Quezon,2773,3,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,This film took several years into production which made me think if ever this will be finished since it would take a lot of money to make it and possibly got delayed because of the pandemic as well
Quezon,2773,4,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"When the cast and more details were announced, I am glad that it still pushed through despite some delays in production"
Quezon,2773,5,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"However, what raised some eyebrows is the announcement of Jericho Rosales as Manuel L"
Quezon,2773,6,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,Quezon since there was another actor that was supposed to portray an older version of him
Quezon,2773,7,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,I was surprised because Quezon is a mestizo while Rosales is a moreno actor
Quezon,2773,8,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"While I think this must be a miscast, I was intrigued whether he can pull this off since he is also a good actor too and has played lead roles in the past"
Quezon,2773,9,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"Watched the movie, I was impressed by Rosales's portrayal of Quezon as an ambitious yet charismatic senator who wants to liberate the Philippines from the Americans"
Quezon,2773,10,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,I had my doubts at first that Jerrold Tarog would make Quezon a good person yet what he did in this film he made him a morally grey character
Quezon,2773,11,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,It based Quezon on several historical documents and articles
Quezon,2773,12,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"While it didn't cover much about everything, it is clear that Quezon is what we call in a politics a "" trapo"" where he uses people to his advantage and perception in winning the elections and attaining power"
Quezon,2773,13,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,Watching the film made me realize that everything is still relevant to what is happening today
Quezon,2773,14,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,Same people but different faces
Quezon,2773,15,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,The movie depicts how politics is game for the politicians where the masses are still considered pawns and the rich and elite still dictate everything and control the society
Quezon,2773,16,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"In this film, I didn't root for either Quezon or Aguinaldo"
Quezon,2773,17,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,There is neither black and white nor good and bad
Quezon,2773,18,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"Overall, the film is great and entertaining to watch"
Quezon,2773,19,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,The veteran and rising cast is great
Quezon,2773,20,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,I also think that Quezon and Osmeña here have chemistry as rivals turned to running mates
Quezon,2773,21,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,It's also an eye-opener to everyone especially when some of the issues in this film are still relevant to our country
Quezon,2773,22,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,Joven and his family represent our struggle in facing the reality of our country
Quezon,2773,23,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,Corruption is a systemic problem in our country and the film makes us think whether we are truly free
Quezon,2773,24,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"Even if we are independent, imperialism still exists in our country especially with how first world countries interfere with our affairs and also control our economy in other ways"
Quezon,2773,25,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,The political system is still same but worse and I can still see Quezon in some politicians in the news
Quezon,2773,26,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"With Quezon showing in cinemas, I hope that more people will learn to discern and choose leaders carefully and see them in a lens where they don't vote them just because they're popular or owe them everything"
Quezon,2773,27,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon is not perfect in terms of production and pacing, but it's a fun watch and has served its purpose for the general public"
Quezon,2773,28,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,I'm optimistic that if more people will watch this type of films we might get more genres like them in the future
Quezon,2773,29,migueltheangelo,,140.0,ltbx,PS: Stay for the mid-credit scenes

Quezon,2775,3,shingen12,,80.0,ltbx,I do not understand why so much time is dedicated to the third act when all of its points have already been laid out in the first two chapters with better pacing

Quezon,2778,1,misoandcats,,160.0,ltbx,"the irony of quezon using media as his self-image propaganda, and that being the very weapon that was used to reveal his actual image…it just clicked to me that we’re basically the audience watching nadia hernando’s second version of the real manuel luis quezon that was never seen by the masses"

Quezon,2787,1,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,"jericho delivered a layered performance so i’ll deliver a layered reviewat first, I thought the choice to tell the story from That POV was just a gimmicky choice, like form over substance, but as the film continued it felt like a very relevant meta commentary (idk for sure if that’s the intention)"
Quezon,2787,2,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,"(For added context for the succeeding parts of this review, Quezon’s grandson crashed out during a press tour as he claims there are gross inaccuracies in the film"
Quezon,2787,3,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,)The way this film dealt about propaganda stuck with me
Quezon,2787,4,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,Choosing to tell the story in that POV further drives the point for me
Quezon,2787,5,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon’s grandson crashed out because of inaccuracies, but this film isn’t supposed to be seen as an historical account (as well as the previous films in this trilogy for that matter)"
Quezon,2787,6,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,Telling the story from the perspective of the film reels for me feels like the director’s way of telling us that these films shouldn’t be read as historical accounts because they are just not
Quezon,2787,7,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,In fact it could even be interpreted as propaganda by some
Quezon,2787,8,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,But that is what the film means to me at least
Quezon,2787,9,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,"When TJ Trinidad was recast, I was hesitant, mainly because TJ looked like a modern Manuel Quezon"

Quezon,2787,11,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,"The voice, the mannerisms, the small details, it’s so layered and I could watch it for hours on end"
Quezon,2787,12,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,Everyone else in the cast did a fantastic job as well
Quezon,2787,13,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,(Fuck the CongTV cameo tho)I was shocked by how much they grounded Manuel Quezon back to reality and deconstructed the person
Quezon,2787,14,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon is one of my favorite presidents, but this made me look at him at a less fanatic perspective"
Quezon,2787,15,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,"Quezon was one smart mf, but that was also his flaw"
Quezon,2787,16,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,He may be the our country’s best example of what a Machiavellian is
Quezon,2787,17,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,"He played the cards he was dealt with yes, but he did so knowing the game was rigged while still benefiting from it, and even contributing to the rot"
Quezon,2787,18,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,"The way imperialism and independence is dealt with here has me conflicted, I still have no cohesive thoughts about how they discussed it, maybe on a rewatch"
Quezon,2787,19,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,Politics is a game to those in power even if it shouldn’t be because our lives depend on it
Quezon,2787,20,badtasteyanyan,,140.0,ltbx,ALSO the tension built in the Bagac Bataan scene IS SO
