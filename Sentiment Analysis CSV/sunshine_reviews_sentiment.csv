Sunshine,12,6,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,It highlights how judgment often speaks louder than understanding
Sunshine,12,7,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"In many cases, the girl is seen as the only one responsible for what happened, while the systems meant to protect her fail"
Sunshine,12,8,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"In the Philippines, many people argue that illegalizing abortion teaches responsibility"
Sunshine,12,9,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,But isn't choosing abortion also a form of responsibility
Sunshine,12,10,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"Knowing that you are not ready-emotionally, financially, or mentally-to raise a child can already be an act of maturity"
Sunshine,12,11,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"We openly preach safe sex, yet we deny women access to safe abortion"
Sunshine,12,12,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,This contradiction puts women's lives at risk
Sunshine,12,13,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"For me, this issue is not about the rights of a fetus alone-it is also about the rights of a living woman"
Sunshine,12,14,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"In my own view, if my mother had gotten pregnant in her teenage years while still chasing her dreams, I would rather not be born than be the reason her future was taken away"
Sunshine,12,15,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"I would not remember it, I would not suffer from that decision-but at least she would have lived the life she wanted"
Sunshine,12,16,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"That, too, is a form of love and sacrifice"
Sunshine,12,17,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,Another harsh reality the film touches on is how society treats teenagers who experience early pregnancy
Sunshine,12,18,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"Many say, ""They enjoyed it,"" or ""They wanted it"
Sunshine,12,19,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,""" But a child or a teenager needs guidance from responsible adults, not condemnation"
Sunshine,12,20,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,Blaming them does not fix the problem
Sunshine,12,21,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"This is not about tolerating impulsive behavior-it is about educating both girls and boys, teaching accountability, protection, and respect"
Sunshine,12,22,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"Sunshine makes you realize that judgment is easy, but compassion is rare"
Sunshine,12,23,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"The film reminds us that behind every controversial situation is a scared, confused young girl who still deserves empathy and protection"
Sunshine,12,24,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"Overall, Sunshine is a brave and emotionally heavy film that forces us to confront one of the most uncomfortable issues in Filipino society"
Sunshine,12,25,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"It does not give easy answers, but it asks the right questions"
Sunshine,12,26,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"For me, the film strengthens the belief that abortion should be legalized-not to promote irresponsibility, but to protect women, save lives, and give them the freedom to choose their own future"
Sunshine,12,27,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,"True responsibility does not come from punishment and shame, but from understanding, education, and safe choices"
Sunshine,12,28,FrancineM-969,2025-12-02,60.0,imdb,Sunshine is not just a movie-it is a mirror of our society and a challenge to our beliefs
Sunshine,13,1,jouleZ,2025-11-26,40.0,imdb,"A Missed Opportunity to Stick the Landing: I had been waiting a long time to watch Sunshine, especially since I never got the chance to see it on the big screen"
Sunshine,13,2,jouleZ,2025-11-26,40.0,imdb,"So, when it finally arrived on Netflix, I was so excited, only for that excitement to fade the longer I watched"
Sunshine,13,3,jouleZ,2025-11-26,40.0,imdb,The premise is undeniably compelling: a young gymnast discovers she's pregnant just as her lifelong dream of reaching the Olympics is within reach
Sunshine,13,4,jouleZ,2025-11-26,40.0,imdb,"It's a setup filled with emotional stakes and potential for a powerful, character-driven story"
Sunshine,13,5,jouleZ,2025-11-26,40.0,imdb,"But instead of exploring her dedication to the sport, the film shifts almost entirely to her pregnancy and her attempts to deal with it"
Sunshine,13,6,jouleZ,2025-11-26,40.0,imdb,"I kept waiting for scenes that would show her fighting for her dream, intense training, the pressure of competition, the physical and emotional toll of gymnastics, but those moments never really come"
Sunshine,13,7,jouleZ,2025-11-26,40.0,imdb,"The narrative focuses more on side characters and subplots that feel unnecessary and, frankly, uninteresting"
Sunshine,13,8,jouleZ,2025-11-26,40.0,imdb,"I couldn't help comparing this film to other international athlete biopics that portray the grit, passion, and relentless work behind the journey"
Sunshine,13,9,jouleZ,2025-11-26,40.0,imdb,"Sunshine had all the ingredients to deliver that kind of inspiring story, but it simply doesn't stick the landing"
Sunshine,13,10,jouleZ,2025-11-26,40.0,imdb,"Overall, I'm disappointed"
Sunshine,13,11,jouleZ,2025-11-26,40.0,imdb,"With a stronger focus on the athletic journey and the challenges of balancing an unexpected pregnancy with Olympic ambitions, this could have been a much more compelling and memorable film"
Sunshine,14,1,miketkrwilliams,2025-12-07,80.0,imdb,"This film truly highlights how anti abortion is violence against women: While the subject is powerful and brave and the acting excellent, the execution and cinematography are weak, marring what could have been an excellent film"
Sunshine,14,2,miketkrwilliams,2025-12-07,80.0,imdb,What it does well is highlight how anti abortion is violence against women
Sunshine,14,3,miketkrwilliams,2025-12-07,80.0,imdb,It shows how the anti abortion crowd destroys the lives of young women through lack of sex education and lack of health care combined with horrid anti women propaganda
Sunshine,14,4,miketkrwilliams,2025-12-07,80.0,imdb,"The hospital scene where the evil ""Jesus"" Dr"
Sunshine,14,5,miketkrwilliams,2025-12-07,80.0,imdb,Berates the propagandist for attempting an abortion absolutely enraged me because it is so accurate as to how women are treated
Sunshine,14,6,miketkrwilliams,2025-12-07,80.0,imdb,I think the film would have been better if it has put more emphasis on Sunshine's sister who supported and helped her
Sunshine,14,7,miketkrwilliams,2025-12-07,80.0,imdb,I wanted more of that
Sunshine,14,8,miketkrwilliams,2025-12-07,80.0,imdb,"All that said, this is a powerful and timely film about an important subject"
Sunshine,14,9,miketkrwilliams,2025-12-07,80.0,imdb,"I applaud all those involved for having the courage to show the evil at the heart of Filipino culture, and for daring to stand up against the ""pro life"" machine"
Sunshine,15,1,jaimerebanal,,160.0,ltbx,"TIFF 2024 #41: Centrepiece (World Premiere)Gripping, distressing - among many things that can be said to describe the experience of a woman who could just as easily lose everything she ever knew with as much as a single unplanned pregnancy"
Sunshine,15,2,jaimerebanal,,160.0,ltbx,"But perhaps the added stress to watching Sunshine is only exacerbated by the environment in which our title character is inhabiting, where the conservative religious and social norms of the Philippines are infringing on her own rights as a human being too"
Sunshine,15,3,jaimerebanal,,160.0,ltbx,Really liked this one a whole lot
Sunshine,16,1,seth97,,120.0,ltbx,So was that girl a personified version of her fetus or was she literally just stalking her

Sunshine,17,5,carloslaron,,140.0,ltbx,I was deeply moved by her
Sunshine,17,6,carloslaron,,140.0,ltbx,The storytelling I wanna say is quite…unexpected
Sunshine,17,7,carloslaron,,140.0,ltbx,It added to the layers of the movie and I just know this will totally ruffle feathers when it finally gets shown in the Philippines
Sunshine,17,8,carloslaron,,140.0,ltbx,"Even on the Q&A Director Antoinette Jadaone mentioned she wanted to spark the conversation on this, to which I hope people don’t take for granted"

Sunshine,19,2,bryanarsenault,,160.0,ltbx,"I felt so hard for the lead character, with an solid performance from Maris Racal"
Sunshine,19,3,bryanarsenault,,160.0,ltbx,"She carried the movie, alone, brilliantly"
Sunshine,19,4,bryanarsenault,,160.0,ltbx,It really show how decisions made by men (that doesn't have a lot of screen time in this movie) can impact the lives of women and girls
Sunshine,19,5,bryanarsenault,,160.0,ltbx,This movie really opened up conversations after the screening (for my friends and I) and I hope it will do the same after it open in the Philippines
Sunshine,19,6,bryanarsenault,,160.0,ltbx,"I'm glad I saw that movie and I learned a lot, still processing things"
Sunshine,20,1,holdencaulfie1d,,180.0,ltbx,"TIFF film #4 – a simple, straightforward piece about women's sexual and reproductive health and rights in the Philippines, and a portrait into the country's politics, faith, societal pressures and expectations, and gender roles"
Sunshine,20,2,holdencaulfie1d,,180.0,ltbx,the film is carried both by its message and by Maris Racal's great performance (there is also very few supporting characters – honorable mention to Sunshine's ate)
Sunshine,20,3,holdencaulfie1d,,180.0,ltbx,i enjoyed the cinematography and the boldness in the telling of this story
Sunshine,20,4,holdencaulfie1d,,180.0,ltbx,"looking forward to the conversations + reception of this film, especially within the Filipinx diaspora"
Sunshine,21,1,rbasmayor,,140.0,ltbx,TIFF Film #14: Well received in Toronto but I expect this to be divisive in PH and will spark conversations
Sunshine,21,2,rbasmayor,,140.0,ltbx,Probably the film by which the audiences are too eager to attend the Q&A (as handfuls only left after the credits of the world premiere screening)
Sunshine,21,3,rbasmayor,,140.0,ltbx,A very important film which is very timely to be told and the Jojo Rabbit inspired reference gives lighter touch to the dark subject
Sunshine,21,4,rbasmayor,,140.0,ltbx,The Piolo Pascual cameo is noteworthy and unsettling (I Am aloof to any forms of pastors lol)
Sunshine,22,1,carrotpeople,,160.0,ltbx,i watched the world premiere for this film for tiff 2024
Sunshine,22,2,carrotpeople,,160.0,ltbx,maris racal’s performance in this film is ABSOLUTELY amazing
Sunshine,22,3,carrotpeople,,160.0,ltbx,she embodies the character so well and its a lot of pressure to carry being that her screen time is 90% of the film
Sunshine,22,4,carrotpeople,,160.0,ltbx,the pacing of the film was pretty good in the 2nd half
Sunshine,22,5,carrotpeople,,160.0,ltbx,I found the first part to be repetitive and didnt contribute to the characters development nor the storyline
Sunshine,22,6,carrotpeople,,160.0,ltbx,"overall, since the directors main intention is to spark a conversation, i will be looking forward to the reception of this movie once it is released to a wider audience"
Sunshine,22,7,carrotpeople,,160.0,ltbx,the subject matter is a very sensitive topic especially in the ph
Sunshine,22,8,carrotpeople,,160.0,ltbx,"different religious, political, and cultural perspectives regarding abortion are depicted in the movie and i have no doubt that it will receive strong criticism but perhaps thats only the start"

Sunshine,40,4,kevinlater,,160.0,ltbx,i really appreciate the neutrality and seeing both sides of the abortion argument leading up to the actual stance of the film - during the q&a jadaone talked about doing interviews and research with women with the different viewpoints and that's awesome to hear
Sunshine,40,5,kevinlater,,160.0,ltbx,"love how philippine society is portrayed here, in all of its hyper-religious and patriarchal ways, because even though it isn't pretty, it's reality"

Sunshine,46,1,rich_mundo,,180.0,ltbx,a very important film with such a precise and well thought out look into the real conditions of young filipina women in PH
Sunshine,46,2,rich_mundo,,180.0,ltbx,"honestly what i rlly loved about the movie, besides the themes and messages it portrays, is its efficient uses of every single scene in the movie"
Sunshine,46,3,rich_mundo,,180.0,ltbx,"there's no unnecessary scene in this movie that doesn't forward the character's arc, the pace of the movie and it's messages"
Sunshine,46,4,rich_mundo,,180.0,ltbx,everyone's performances are top notch and every beat hits very hard emotionally
Sunshine,46,5,rich_mundo,,180.0,ltbx,nd it rlly is such a realistic portrayal of what folks go through in the philippines when it comes to reproduction rights
Sunshine,46,6,rich_mundo,,180.0,ltbx,"i love how this movie covers every part of this issue without it feeling hamfisted and blatant, such as not only the stigmatization, but also the economic conditions of every day filipinos (u can argue the kids might be that, but honestly it was a good narrative tool in what otherwise be on insight we might not be able to obtain)"
Sunshine,46,7,rich_mundo,,180.0,ltbx,i sincerely hope this movie gets distributed widely nd ESPECIALLY in the philippines

Sunshine,50,10,mapleleaf,,160.0,ltbx,"At this world premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, director Antoinette Jadaone said she got the idea for an imaginary friend from the film Jojo Rabbit"

Sunshine,52,1,denisemp,,120.0,ltbx,This is a film of two parts
Sunshine,52,2,denisemp,,120.0,ltbx,"This film is part compelling drama, with a strong lead performance from the young actor and a powerful examination of the treatment of women in the Phillipines"
Sunshine,52,3,denisemp,,120.0,ltbx,"This film is also part surrealist, but in a way that I feel undermines the strengths of the film"
Sunshine,52,4,denisemp,,120.0,ltbx,There is a young girl who appears at various points throughout the film; her identity is left to interpretation
Sunshine,52,5,denisemp,,120.0,ltbx,However I feel that this apparition weakens every scene she's in
Sunshine,52,6,denisemp,,120.0,ltbx,You'll have this powerful understated drama and then this wise-cracking girl appears to swear at you
Sunshine,52,7,denisemp,,120.0,ltbx,It is clear that they couldn't even make her fit throughout the film because she disappears for at least half an hour in the middle
Sunshine,52,8,denisemp,,120.0,ltbx,"The filmmaker said this was the original core concept of the film and I understand that, but I feel that the film moved beyond the need for this character"

Sunshine,85,2,deekyubee,,160.0,ltbx,"Just like how Queer paved an honest way of portraying gay men, Sunshine isn't like an abortion movie I've seen before"
Sunshine,85,3,deekyubee,,160.0,ltbx,I'm always excited to watch a Filipino movie that breaks out into a critically praised festival run
Sunshine,85,4,deekyubee,,160.0,ltbx,"As a Filipino who grew up in a family that owned a lot of Filipino movies, I was never a fan to be quite real with you"
Sunshine,85,5,deekyubee,,160.0,ltbx,"Filipino movies ranged from Hallmark style romances, repetitive action movies and cheesy low budget horror (although Shake, Rattle and Roll did slap)"
Sunshine,85,6,deekyubee,,160.0,ltbx,But every once in a blue moon there comes an ambitious director who tells an honest Filipino story that is both intimate in its narrative and expansive in its political themes

Sunshine,87,1,t_dunin,,40.0,ltbx,"In the Philippines, Catholicism is the predominant religion comprising around 80% of the population"
Sunshine,87,2,t_dunin,,40.0,ltbx,"Because of the church’s influence, the country’s policy is restrictive and conservative, especially regarding family planning"
Sunshine,87,3,t_dunin,,40.0,ltbx,"Considering the social context, Jadaone’s attempt to address the topic of abortion is certainly admirable, but the simplistic and tear-jerking way it is done leaves much to be desired"

Sunshine,88,4,helena1397,,160.0,ltbx,The film shows more than clearly the difficulties and impossibilities that are placed in the way of young women (or far too often children) and that sometimes there is no way out when everyone really is against you
Sunshine,88,5,helena1397,,160.0,ltbx,"The film shows that you can be strong on your own, but that your environment is also so essential"

Sunshine,90,1,irenecruz,,180.0,ltbx,"Antes que nada he de decir que la la cinematografía de Pao Orendain en Sunshine es un deleite: sus planos capturan la ciudad de manera natural, con un lenguaje de cámara preciso que da vida a la historia con una sencillez bella y efectiva"
Sunshine,90,2,irenecruz,,180.0,ltbx,"A través de una mirada profundamente realista, Antoinette Jadaone narra la historia de una adolescente atrapada en una sociedad que niega la libertad de la mujer sobre su cuerpo"
Sunshine,90,3,irenecruz,,180.0,ltbx,"La película muestra de manera sutil pero poderosa el conflicto interno de la protagonista, atrapada entre sus deseos, su futuro y las estrictas normas y creencias impuestas por su entorno"
Sunshine,90,4,irenecruz,,180.0,ltbx,"El guion, que entrelaza la historia con la presencia de una misteriosa niña pequeña que persigue a Sunshine, ofrece una reflexión sobre cómo las cargas y creencias sociales se transmiten de generación en generación; subrayando la continuidad de esas presiones a lo largo del tiempo"
Sunshine,91,1,filmloewinrudel,,,ltbx,"""In SUNSHINE verwebt die philippinische Regisseurin Antoinette Jadaone ökonomische, soziale und politische Umstände, die Sunshine navigieren muss"

Sunshine,96,1,mickpilgrim,,160.0,ltbx,"What sets ‘Sunshine’ apart is how writer-director Antoinette Jadaone roots the film in the Philippines’ conservative culture, shaped by Catholicism and its influence on public policies"
Sunshine,96,2,mickpilgrim,,160.0,ltbx,"While some moments may feel a bit heavy-handed, Jadaone delivers an earnest take on the tension between religious values and societal realities, while occasionally poking fun at certain hypocrisies"
Sunshine,96,3,mickpilgrim,,160.0,ltbx,Another unique aspect of ‘Sunshine’ is how it weaves in magic realism
Sunshine,96,4,mickpilgrim,,160.0,ltbx,"This creative approach, which is like a mix of Taika Waititi’s ‘Jojo Rabbit’ and Celine Sciamma’s ‘Petite Maman’, might not be for everyone; nevertheless, it enriches the discourse and keeps the narrative from feeling simplistic"

Sunshine,127,2,awkyard,,180.0,ltbx,It explores what being a woman is like in a society that does not see you as a human being with your own thoughts and aspirations
Sunshine,127,3,awkyard,,180.0,ltbx,"Although my stint as a trampolinist did not lead me to the success that she has achieved, I felt personally acquainted to the title character and her experience and struggle really resonated with me"

Sunshine,130,1,miguellugtu,,160.0,ltbx,Sobering essential viewing
Sunshine,130,2,miguellugtu,,160.0,ltbx,Extremely stressful and also heartbreaking and honest
Sunshine,130,3,miguellugtu,,160.0,ltbx,Maris is the best actress of her generation (and maybe even the one before her
Sunshine,130,4,miguellugtu,,160.0,ltbx,The Kim Chiu one lol) I hope this gets seen by a lot of people and if the Philippines knows what it’s doing (it doesn’t) this should be our entry to next year’s Oscars

Sunshine,134,1,joyceyyjoyce,,180.0,ltbx,"Brave storytelling, i must say"
Sunshine,134,2,joyceyyjoyce,,180.0,ltbx,"While this film may be received differently, I think it should start a conversation challenging our stance on every social issue raised"
Sunshine,134,3,joyceyyjoyce,,180.0,ltbx,"And more importantly, yes, motherhood is not for everyone, and people should realize that by now"

Sunshine,140,1,bhargav1717,,,ltbx,AAAFF 2025
Sunshine,142,1,mirazal,,,ltbx,My dreams are her dreams
Sunshine,143,1,samfireman,,180.0,ltbx,a beautiful film with a story that’s unfortunately very relevant and needed
Sunshine,144,1,kobeeeee,,160.0,ltbx,"I was at an exclusive screening for this film, and there was a girl dressed in all-pink, and I thought to myself ""Why is she dressed like Glinda from Wicked"
Sunshine,144,3,kobeeeee,,160.0,ltbx,I later learned this was Xyriel Manabat
Sunshine,145,1,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Early in this coming-of-age sports drama from Antoinette Jadaone, we see Maris Racal as the titular character, twisting and turning her body gracefully like a professional who's been doing this routine all her life"
Sunshine,145,2,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Right there and then, I told myself silently that this is going to be the best and most unforgettable performance of her career"
Sunshine,145,3,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"In the film, she plays Sunshine, a dedicated young gymnast preparing for her team’s upcoming tryouts for the Olympics"
Sunshine,145,4,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"But days before their tryouts, she discovers that she is pregnant"
Sunshine,145,5,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,Now she must embark on a desperate and risky journey to fight for her dream
Sunshine,145,6,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Penned and directed by Antoinette Jadaone, this is definitely one of her strongest works and one that truly stands out amongst all the films in her sprawling filmography, thanks to its solid script paired with equally confident direction"
Sunshine,145,7,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Her works, which are reminiscent of the late Marilou Diaz-Abaya, albeit with a more modern flair, are always centered around fully fleshed-out female characters who, while at times flawed, go through a transformative journey (case in point: directing That Thing Called Tadhana, Beauty in a Bottle (2014), Never Not Love You (2018), Alone/Together (2019), and Fan Girl (2020))"
Sunshine,145,8,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,And this latest one is no different
Sunshine,145,9,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Here, we follow a young woman faced with the burden of her unplanned pregnancy in a country like the Philippines, where abortion is illegal under all circumstances and has no exceptions, even in cases of rape, incest, or when the woman's life is at risk"
Sunshine,145,10,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"It's honestly a pretty daunting task to write a story like this given its themes, let alone actually make one and release it in a highly conservative, mostly Catholic country like the Philippines"
Sunshine,145,11,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,Yet Jadaone successfully completed the film without sacrificing her vision
Sunshine,145,12,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,The film manages to bravely portray the burden brought by unwanted pregnancies to women while men get a free pass in this patriarchal society designed by and controlled by men
Sunshine,145,13,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,It also paints how religious people can't help but keep shoving their beliefs on others instead of minding their own business
Sunshine,145,14,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Most importantly, the film discusses the importance of a proper health care system in a third-world country like ours, which is run by capitalism and corrupt government officials"
Sunshine,145,15,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Instead of providing safe and accessible procedures like safe abortion for women, we have a country forcing them to find unsafe means on their own, endangering their lives in the process"
Sunshine,145,16,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Performance-wise, the film is packed with numerous talents, so not a single shot in the film is put to waste"
Sunshine,145,17,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Both Meryll Soriano as Sunshine's coach, Eden, and Xyriel Manabat as her best friend, Thea, are effective"
Sunshine,145,18,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Elijah Canlas nails the gaslighting asshole of a boyfriend, Miggy, while Jennica Garcia is simply brilliant as Sunshine's sister, Geleen"
Sunshine,145,19,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Other noteworthy turns include Rhed Bustamante, Juan Miguel Garcia, Angeli Bayani, and Piolo Pascual in a cameo role as Miggy's father"
Sunshine,145,20,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,A young Annika Co also shines with her role as the young girl constantly nagging Sunshine
Sunshine,145,21,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"But the film will definitely not work if not for the career-best portrayal from its lead, Maris Racal, who delivers a tour-de-force performance as Sunshine herself"
Sunshine,145,22,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"One can really feel and see the dedication she had for such a demanding role, physically and emotionally"
Sunshine,145,23,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Her performance really pulls you into the film and won't let go until the emotionally charged third act, making it one of the best local female performances I've seen this year so far"
Sunshine,145,24,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,The film also boasts some great visuals thanks to Pao Orendain's slick camerawork and incredible music courtesy of Rico Blanco—a first for the singer-songwriter
Sunshine,145,25,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Overall, this latest film from Antoinette Jadaone is one rollercoaster of emotions that is buoyed by a daring and electrifying performance from Maris Racal"
Sunshine,145,26,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"It's a poignant, gripping and thought-provoking journey of a woman coming to terms with her own inner conflicts"
Sunshine,145,27,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"It's already halfway through the year, but this is already the best Filipino film of 2025 in my opinion"
Sunshine,145,28,filmcirclerjct,,200.0,ltbx,"Trust me, you will not be prepared for how powerful this film is"
Sunshine,146,1,schwob,,200.0,ltbx,This is the best Filipino film I've seen so far
Sunshine,146,2,schwob,,200.0,ltbx,It follows a gymnast whose dreams are challenged by an unexpected pregnancy
Sunshine,146,3,schwob,,200.0,ltbx,"Because the Philippines are incredibly Catholic, abortion is illegal and hard to execute"
Sunshine,146,4,schwob,,200.0,ltbx,"Will she give in to the pressure of keeping the child, will she seek medically unadvised procedures, or will she get help from others who understand her situation"
Sunshine,146,5,schwob,,200.0,ltbx,The film explores the pressures that religion and misogyny place on young women - pressures that unfortunately appear to still be widespread in today's world
Sunshine,147,1,xpert_ninja,,140.0,ltbx,Watched as a representative of UP Cinema
Sunshine,147,2,xpert_ninja,,140.0,ltbx,It's a brave take on one of the most controversial issues in Philippine society ever
Sunshine,147,3,xpert_ninja,,140.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is soooo good
Sunshine,147,4,xpert_ninja,,140.0,ltbx,Direk Tonet is on Fan Girl mode: things get quite tense and harrowing
Sunshine,148,1,alexyoken,,160.0,ltbx,"Claustrophobic, not just in how the frame is composed in several scenes, but in how it shows the extent in which the malignant structure of self-righteous patriarchal conservatism has done palpable harm to women and children everywhere"
Sunshine,148,2,alexyoken,,160.0,ltbx,"The film uses its central plotline to weave a rich tapestry of people and places that paint a picture of how this corrupted structure affects the titular protagonist, as well as the people around her"
Sunshine,148,3,alexyoken,,160.0,ltbx,"The tone possesses a gradually ratcheting anger at the oppressive status quo, going for the throats of its targets with at times bleak satire, or crushing nightmarish realities"
Sunshine,148,4,alexyoken,,160.0,ltbx,"This indignation, however, is ultimately fueled out of immense compassion"
Sunshine,148,5,alexyoken,,160.0,ltbx,"The film never really downs itself in hopelessness as it actively claws for hope, and never loses sight of Sunshine's agency through it all"
Sunshine,148,6,alexyoken,,160.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal's humane, scrappy performance is the total anchor of this film, carrying the heaviness with determination impressively"
Sunshine,148,7,alexyoken,,160.0,ltbx,"Although the breadth of the screenplay's scope is the film's biggest strength, there is some messiness in terms of scene-by-scene progression, and the more metaphorical/allegorical stuff doesn't fully coalesce with the film's more tangible arcs"
Sunshine,148,8,alexyoken,,160.0,ltbx,"Still, its willingness to take an approach both upfront and delicate to its central topic proves to be a burning, driving core towards a cathartic final endpoint"
Sunshine,148,9,alexyoken,,160.0,ltbx,"Meaningful, impassionate stuff"
Sunshine,149,1,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"I am averse to making comparisons to Brocka, but here we are"
Sunshine,149,2,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"You see it in this film's Manila, a hysterically cruel city that somehow maintains its kindness in its edges"
Sunshine,149,3,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"Here we are, at the claws of light, a sliver of sunshine cutting through the darkness"
Sunshine,149,4,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine makes a lot of bad decisions, but that's all she has"
Sunshine,149,5,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"This is a nation of bad decisions, especially when it comes to the plight of young women"
Sunshine,149,6,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,And she has to weave through these apathetic streets to find the kindness that exists in spite of the cruelty
Sunshine,149,7,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"The film uses a device that I found tenuous at points, though I do think it works out in the end"
Sunshine,149,8,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,It's just that the film is so good at depicting the casual reality of these characters and the city that surrounds them that I found the break from it a little distracting
Sunshine,149,9,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"The film is transcendent when it just shows us what this city is: a place where a churchyard is where you go to find abortion drugs, a city where a motel is hesitant to give you a room if you're alone, a place where a person charged with caring for you might also take it as an opportunity to shame you for your choices"
Sunshine,149,10,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"At the heart of this is Maris Racal, who delivers what might be the performance of a lifetime"
Sunshine,149,11,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"A lot is asked of the young actress, who is made to mask the rage of generations of women and put on the facade of someone who is pretending that all this will pass without incident"
Sunshine,149,12,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"It is sadness and worry, but also the prevailing need to show the world that everything is okay"
Sunshine,149,13,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"She gets ample support from the rest of the cast, with Jennica Garcia in particular embodying the spirit of this film in its most crucial moments"
Sunshine,149,14,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"There were several moments watching Sunshine where I find myself saying, ""yes"
Sunshine,149,15,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,""" Yes, because I was agreeing with what the movie was saying"
Sunshine,149,16,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"Yes, because it was showing me a Manila that felt right"
Sunshine,149,17,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"Yes, because Racal was really nailing something"
Sunshine,149,18,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"Yes, because the music just swelled at just the right moment"
Sunshine,149,19,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,"There will be much talk about what the movie says, what it argues in the face of a society that often feels immovable"
Sunshine,149,20,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,But here we are
Sunshine,149,21,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,Here it is
Sunshine,149,22,philbertdy,,180.0,ltbx,All I can say is yes
Sunshine,150,1,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,"“Mahirap maging babae, mas lalo na babae sa Pilipinas"
Sunshine,150,2,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,"”No matter how matriarchal, modern, or progressive we claim to be, women here are still shackled by outdated norms, patriarchal laws, and the belief that their bodies and their choices are not truly their own"
Sunshine,150,3,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine confronts these hard truths with unflinching honesty
Sunshine,150,4,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,The quiet desperation of having limited options
Sunshine,150,5,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,The shame bred by religious and societal expectations
Sunshine,150,6,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,The resilience women are forced to summon simply to survive
Sunshine,150,7,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,Maris Racal delivers a tour-de-force performance
Sunshine,150,8,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,"I’ve loved her since Marupok AF, but here, she transcends"
Sunshine,150,9,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,"She carries the film with depth and vulnerability, her portrayal of Sunshine equal parts fragile and fierce"
Sunshine,150,10,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,"She’s matched beautifully by Jennica Garcia, whose turn as her older sister is quietly powerful"
Sunshine,150,11,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,"In her hands, sisterhood becomes a form of motherhood, a reminder that parenting can come from places we least expect"
Sunshine,150,12,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine hopes to be a catalyst for reproductive rights, choice, and change"
Sunshine,150,13,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,"And at its core, it’s a love letter to every Filipina who has ever had to fight for her rights and a light in the dark"
Sunshine,150,14,mel_loz_,,180.0,ltbx,Go see it
Sunshine,151,1,maisconyelo,,200.0,ltbx,really don't know how to write a review for this yet pero i still feel so lucky to have been part of an advance screening :) literally been waiting for this movie since 2023 (
Sunshine,151,3,maisconyelo,,200.0,ltbx,"sarap din sa feeling na i had expectations for this movie and it did not disappoint talagaseconding what direk dan said during the mediacon, this is direk tonet's best work"
Sunshine,151,4,maisconyelo,,200.0,ltbx,i remember telling her after watching na the ending is very tonet jadaone iykyk hahaha
Sunshine,151,5,maisconyelo,,200.0,ltbx,hirap niyang panoorin in a sense na it's super heartbreaking because it is what's happening in reality pero it is still important to watch to spark conversations and discussions regarding this sensitive topic
Sunshine,151,6,maisconyelo,,200.0,ltbx,i also appreciate how direk tonet handled this subject sa paggawa ng pelikula
Sunshine,151,7,maisconyelo,,200.0,ltbx,bilang small lang yung sinehan kahapon medyo nahihiya ako magreact pero grabe kasi panghihina at lungkot ko while watching huhuhu :(( even after matapos nung screening ang bigat ng atmosphere ang hirap itake it all in :( i wouldnt mind if direk tonet and maris worked together for a hundred more films hahdhsjd wishing the best for this movie
Sunshine,151,8,maisconyelo,,200.0,ltbx,"sulitin na ang discounted tickets yippiezanyway, my unserious review naman for sunshine ay Very Me ung tadtad ng stickers ung tubigan nya, tas ginagawang search bar ang twitter, tiktok, at reddit"
Sunshine,152,1,miggers,,200.0,ltbx,'Sunshine' isn't just a movie; it's an experience that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go
Sunshine,152,2,miggers,,200.0,ltbx,"Bold beyond any controversies it might stir, this film isn't content to simply entertain; it demands to be in a conversation, sparking discussions long after the credits roll"
Sunshine,152,3,miggers,,200.0,ltbx,"THAT UNFORGETTABLE MOTEL SCENE TOOK ME AT THE EDGE OF MY SEATThis is a movie Pinoy people need to see – a powerful, unsettling, and unforgettable piece of cinema that pushes boundaries and challenges perceptions"
Sunshine,152,4,miggers,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal at her absolute best
Sunshine,153,1,apodd,,140.0,ltbx,Will change things culturally in the Philippines
Sunshine,153,2,apodd,,140.0,ltbx,Excited for its wide release
Sunshine,154,1,shanchih,,80.0,ltbx,Maris Racal
Sunshine,155,1,emongpanty,,160.0,ltbx,Phenomenal drama that explores so many aspects of abortion and the various aspects of living in a deeply religious society where it is illegal
Sunshine,155,2,emongpanty,,160.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is truly astounding as the title character
Sunshine,156,1,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Cinemaster FJ Calvario says:In 2022, the government of Cuba had undertaken a bold move"
Sunshine,156,2,upcinema,,,ltbx,It ratified a revision of its Family Code which redefined the “family”
Sunshine,156,3,upcinema,,,ltbx,It was no longer defined by only biological ties but also by relationships based on love and mutual support
Sunshine,156,4,upcinema,,,ltbx,"This revised code is a radical piece of legislation, expanding the rights of women and children and recognizing same-sex marriages and adoption"
Sunshine,156,5,upcinema,,,ltbx,It is a watershed moment for a country once colonized by Catholic Spain whose religious policies defined what was and wasn't allowed in society
Sunshine,156,6,upcinema,,,ltbx,"In another corner of the world, the government of the Philippines continues to enforce the same religious norms set by Spain"
Sunshine,156,7,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Unlike Cuba, the Philippines has a long road ahead of itself in dismantling colonial legacy"
Sunshine,156,8,upcinema,,,ltbx,A road perhaps may be paved by radical films such as Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine
Sunshine,156,9,upcinema,,,ltbx,"A pioneer of the dialogue-driven hugot films of the 2010s, Jadaone is best known for her screenplays that blended comedy and romance"
Sunshine,156,10,upcinema,,,ltbx,"However, beginning with 2020’s haunting thriller Fan Girl which tackled male idolatry in the Duterte era, she seems to be on a sociopolitical streak in her directorial efforts"
Sunshine,156,11,upcinema,,,ltbx,Her latest drama Sunshine now examines a woman’s decision to abort her pregnancy in a country where it is illegal and heavily stigmatized by the influential Catholic Church
Sunshine,156,12,upcinema,,,ltbx,"At the heart of the film is the eponymous protagonist Sunshine (played by Maris Racal), a gymnast who dreams to compete for the Olympics"
Sunshine,156,13,upcinema,,,ltbx,We first see Sunshine practice her routine in a stunningly directed scene showcasing well-paced editing and choreography
Sunshine,156,14,upcinema,,,ltbx,The pulsating electronic score by Rico Blanco is the cherry on top
Sunshine,156,15,upcinema,,,ltbx,He embodies his inner Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who coincidentally scored another sports film released the same year as this one
Sunshine,156,16,upcinema,,,ltbx,Her character’s Olympic ambitions remind me of the great women athletes in our country who have been making waves for their international achievements
Sunshine,156,17,upcinema,,,ltbx,I see in her the Olympic gold-winning weightlifter Hidlyn Diaz and the Wimbledon-competing tennis player Alexa Eala
Sunshine,156,18,upcinema,,,ltbx,But this dream of Olympic glory and national pride may not be realized if Sunshine decides to continue her pregnancy
Sunshine,156,19,upcinema,,,ltbx,"We spend much of the film following her as she navigates through her personal relationships with her family and friends, her boyfriend, her gymnastics coach, and a mysterious girl who questions her decision to abort"
Sunshine,156,20,upcinema,,,ltbx,It’s quite a cast really
Sunshine,156,21,upcinema,,,ltbx,Maris Racal makes the film as Sunshine; she plays her with steadfast determination
Sunshine,156,22,upcinema,,,ltbx,Bubbling behind Racal's eyes is great fear and tragedy
Sunshine,156,23,upcinema,,,ltbx,Xyriel Manabat does a lot with silent glances as Sunshine’s best friend Thea who begins to distance herself from her pregnant friend
Sunshine,156,24,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Elijah Canlas epitomizes the upper class douchebag as Miggy the boyfriend, frequently speaking in straight English and hilariously offloading responsibility to his girlfriend"
Sunshine,156,25,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Annika Co as the mysterious nagging girl manages to be cute, annoying, and threatening in the same scene (although her character’s inclusion in the film is questionable and counter-intuitive, well intentioned as it is)"
Sunshine,156,26,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Jadaone’s dense screenplay is riveting in its timeliness, empathy and boldness"
Sunshine,156,27,upcinema,,,ltbx,The struggle of Sunshine in choosing between her career and an unwanted pregnancy recalls last year’s controversy around another athlete the Olympic gold winner Carlos Yulo who feuded with his mother over the latter’s misappropriation of his hard earned money
Sunshine,156,28,upcinema,,,ltbx,"The discourse around the Yulo issue saw the clashing of cultures, the divide between conservatives (who viewed the athlete as an ungrateful son) and progressives (who championed Carlos’s autonomy)"
Sunshine,156,29,upcinema,,,ltbx,I expect the same discourse around Sunshine’s decision in choosing herself to unfold in Facebook comments sections once the film gets widely released in the country
Sunshine,156,30,upcinema,,,ltbx,It takes a cold heart not to be moved by Sunshine’s struggle for bodily autonomy
Sunshine,156,31,upcinema,,,ltbx,Jadaone situates her protagonist in the working class environs of Manila
Sunshine,156,32,upcinema,,,ltbx,It is a landscape defined by neglect and economic difficulties
Sunshine,156,33,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Sunshine’s mother and father are nowhere to be seen, leaving only Sunshine and her siblings to fend for themselves"
Sunshine,156,34,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Sunshine meets a young girl who is also in need of money for her own abortion, having been raped by her own family member"
Sunshine,156,35,upcinema,,,ltbx,Miggy refuses to share the burden of Sunshine’s pregnancy and keeps his distance
Sunshine,156,36,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Beyond her words, Jadaone’s images (courtesy of cinematographer Pao Orendain) strikingly capture urban oppression"
Sunshine,156,37,upcinema,,,ltbx,"There is a great shot of Sunshine praying behind the grills of a church, visualizing the struggle between Catholic faith and personal freedom"
Sunshine,156,38,upcinema,,,ltbx,"There’s another great shot where a lone Sunshine is again framed behind a window of a motel beside a train line, highlighting how isolating her struggle can be"
Sunshine,156,39,upcinema,,,ltbx,Who would want to give birth to a child into a world of constant struggle amidst economic hardship and social stigma
Sunshine,156,40,upcinema,,,ltbx,The screenplay brilliantly reimagines what a family and society could be
Sunshine,156,41,upcinema,,,ltbx,"In the place of a mother and a father, Sunshine has two mother figures: her sister Geleen (played by Jennica Garcia) and her coach Eden (played by Meryll Soriano)"
Sunshine,156,42,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Where other films would fixate on the familial tension between a parent and a child, this film is refreshingly optimistic in envisioning a family that supports and respects each other in their decisions, even with a decision as controversial as abortion"
Sunshine,156,43,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Sunshine’s supportive, orphaned family challenges the dominant Filipino imagination of the family (a father, a mother, and children)"
Sunshine,156,44,upcinema,,,ltbx,There is a wryly funny dialogue exchange in a Catholic hospital scene between Geleen and a conservative doctor where the former defends Sunshine by pointing out the doctor’s religious hypocrisy
Sunshine,156,45,upcinema,,,ltbx,Jadaone’s screenplay beautifully emphasizes the solidarity between women
Sunshine,156,46,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Beyond interactions within her family, we see Sunshine helped by a kind doctor (played by Angeli Bayani) and, in turn, she helps a young pregnant girl (played by Rhed Bustamante)"
Sunshine,156,47,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Even in an unjust male-dominated world, the film shows hope in the kindness among women"
Sunshine,156,48,upcinema,,,ltbx,I have read reviews comparing this film to works of Lino Brocka and Marilou Diaz-Abaya
Sunshine,156,49,upcinema,,,ltbx,"Perhaps, they are not far off"
Sunshine,156,50,upcinema,,,ltbx,"What Jadaone achieves in this film is the start of an honest conversation about women’s bodily autonomy in our society, much like what Brocka and Abaya have done in their social dramas during the Second Golden Age of Philippine Cinema"
Sunshine,156,51,upcinema,,,ltbx,Time will tell how impactful Sunshine will be on legislation regarding abortion and other aspects of women’s rights
Sunshine,156,52,upcinema,,,ltbx,"The Philippines, society and state, has a long way ahead to embrace progressive ideas, unlike for our fellow ex-Spanish colony Cuba"
Sunshine,156,53,upcinema,,,ltbx,I suspect this film will trigger backlash among conservative audiences
Sunshine,156,54,upcinema,,,ltbx,"God, imagine the online discourse and private message chains from concerned parents"
Sunshine,156,55,upcinema,,,ltbx,But I do hope that close minded people would be moved by a film as empathetic as Sunshine
Sunshine,156,56,upcinema,,,ltbx,Watch Sunshine exclusively in SM Cinemas starting July 23
Sunshine,157,1,ceptune,,100.0,ltbx,"Very backlogged review but hey, to have a star such as Maris (who is great in this film) lead in a controversial topic in this day and age is a breath of fresh air"
Sunshine,157,2,ceptune,,100.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone steps out of her comfort zone yet again to bring out one of her bolder works
Sunshine,157,3,ceptune,,100.0,ltbx,"I am happy that something like this is out there, don't get me wrong, but there is something so off and odd about representing their struggles with hallucinatory unborn children"
Sunshine,157,4,ceptune,,100.0,ltbx,Feels almost counterproductive
Sunshine,157,5,ceptune,,100.0,ltbx,"In the talkback, direk says that she was inspired by Jojo Rabbit with this style of narrative and I wish she went deeper in explaining her reasoning"
Sunshine,157,6,ceptune,,100.0,ltbx,Edit: I strongly urge everyone to read my friend Mac’s review on this here
Sunshine,157,7,ceptune,,100.0,ltbx,Perfectly captures the qualms with the film
Sunshine,157,8,ceptune,,100.0,ltbx,Watched the premiere in SM Aura
Sunshine,157,9,ceptune,,100.0,ltbx,Thanks for the opportunity UP Cinema
Sunshine,158,1,titoianlee,,160.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is a powerful, intimate portrait of a young gymnast who discovers she’s pregnant just days before her Olympic tryouts"
Sunshine,158,2,titoianlee,,160.0,ltbx,"Rather than using the pregnancy as a dramatic twist, the film treats it as a deeply human moment—one that forces Sunshine to confront her identity, future, and agency as a young woman"
Sunshine,158,3,titoianlee,,160.0,ltbx,"Jadaone’s direction is sensitive and grounded, allowing the story to unfold with quiet urgency and emotional truth"
Sunshine,158,4,titoianlee,,160.0,ltbx,The film bravely highlights the invisible struggles women face when ambition and reality collide
Sunshine,158,5,titoianlee,,160.0,ltbx,"Through layered characters and subtle symbolism, Sunshine reveals how choices—especially for women—are rarely simple, often shaped by expectations and silent pressures"
Sunshine,158,6,titoianlee,,160.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal delivers a standout performance, capturing Sunshine’s vulnerability and strength with nuance"
Sunshine,158,7,titoianlee,,160.0,ltbx,"The final scene is restrained yet powerful, offering a deeply satisfying end"
Sunshine,158,8,titoianlee,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a brave, necessary film that speaks volumes about the difficult choices women must make in a world that rarely makes space for them"
Sunshine,159,1,zantimanalo,,200.0,ltbx,Di ko pa napapanuod pero si maris na yan kaya 5 stars agad i love u forever maris racal
Sunshine,160,1,dennynotdeeny,,160.0,ltbx,What do you mean Sunshine walked from Quiapo Church to Siena College
Sunshine,160,2,dennynotdeeny,,160.0,ltbx,I’d recognize that street corner anywhere
Sunshine,160,3,dennynotdeeny,,160.0,ltbx,"As in Fan Girl, the best thing about Jadaone’s filmmaking here is how she leverages unreality to create an immersive, tactile, and real subjective experience"
Sunshine,160,4,dennynotdeeny,,160.0,ltbx,"The film is not just set in Manila, but Sunshine’s Manila, at times hypocritically prim and tragically seedy, both just different modes of alienation borne from the conservative milieu that devalues and abandons the marginalized among us, here particularly young women"
Sunshine,160,5,dennynotdeeny,,160.0,ltbx,It’s a potent text not because it presents clear answers—although its allegiance to its protagonist is never uncertain—but because it paints the sort of full and rich portrait of a woman’s life that the society it portrays cannot seem to imagine for the women in it
Sunshine,160,6,dennynotdeeny,,160.0,ltbx,Very good
Sunshine,161,1,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a powerful, empathetic, and important film that bravely confronts a topic still considered taboo in the Philippines"
Sunshine,161,2,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,"As someone born and raised in the country, I found it both courageous and deeply resonant"
Sunshine,161,3,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s not just what the film is trying to say, but how it says it and, that stands out"
Sunshine,161,4,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,"They did it with care, nuance, and emotional clarity rarely seen in local cinema"
Sunshine,161,5,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,Premiering internationally was also a smart and strategic move
Sunshine,161,6,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,It speaks to how difficult it still is to have open conversations around abortion back home
Sunshine,161,7,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,"The truth is, stories that challenge long-held cultural or moral beliefs often need recognition from abroad before they’re embraced locally, a reflection of our lingering colonial mindset and deeply rooted conservatism"
Sunshine,161,8,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,I truly hope Sunshine finds its audience in the Philippines
Sunshine,161,9,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,"It deserves to, it needs to"
Sunshine,161,10,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,Until we confront the systems that silence stories like these
Sunshine,161,11,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,"Film this bold will remain the exception, not the norm"
Sunshine,161,12,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,"And for that alone, I commend Jadaone"
Sunshine,161,13,chocolocotol,,160.0,ltbx,"We need films like Sunshine—not just to provoke, but to create space for real change"
Sunshine,163,1,jackksfilms,,,ltbx,introduced by antoinette jadaone and maris racalTHAT scene was brutal
Sunshine,164,1,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,Gets na gets ko na
Sunshine,164,2,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,"During the film's duration, I felt like I was drowning"
Sunshine,164,3,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,I was drowning with Sunshine in the chaos of Manila's unsafe milieu
Sunshine,164,4,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,"As she traverse the limited and unfair choices, the feeling of helplessness associated with the ticking time bomb inside her is tactile"
Sunshine,164,5,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,"I felt restrained from the very beginning until the penultimate scene because every obstacle she goes through, she can't show weakness; she has to show up with a brave face because of the programmed noise in her head; which was generated by the years of social norms put upon every woman's shoulder"
Sunshine,164,6,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,"One of the most profound and sensitive moments I found deeply moving was when Sunshine said, ""Hindi po ako buntis, coach"", yet her eyes was swelling with tears"
Sunshine,164,7,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,"She can't believe that this is the only truth she is forced to deal with, that everything she has worked for will end in a whim, and that the choice wasn't even deliberately made by her; mirroring the many women in the Philippines who undergo teenage pregnancy, who also don't have a safe choice for their bodies, and for their dreams"
Sunshine,164,8,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,"As I sit and bask in her story in the cinema, my tears kept falling even in the most simplistic emotions"
Sunshine,164,9,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,Maybe that's what happens when you feel like you've already lost the battle even if you haven't started to face it it yet
Sunshine,164,10,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,Maybe that's how it feels to be in the losing end of the decisions made by the very society that should be protecting you
Sunshine,164,11,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,"Maybe this is how it is to step in the shoes of every woman in the Philippines, and at the very least, it's only a feeling I can imagine"
Sunshine,164,12,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,Honestly hought this film wouldn't make a willful statement
Sunshine,164,13,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,"But it takes a stand, and at the core of it is Maris Racal; supported by a riveting ensemble just as honest as her"
Sunshine,164,14,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,Direk Antoinette Jadaone weaved the story with compassion through the lens of real stories of real women
Sunshine,164,15,carlparaan,,200.0,ltbx,"She made a deliberate choice to conceive this film, and this time, it was made by her"
Sunshine,165,1,maiklingreviews,,160.0,ltbx,4 star kasi ang ingay ng katabi kong ang oa magnarrate ng kwento kahit lahat namin kami nanonood
Sunshine,166,1,nail_crewd,,200.0,ltbx,"It's been a decade since I saw a movie in theater, and Sunshine was well worth it"
Sunshine,166,2,nail_crewd,,200.0,ltbx,This is Jadaone's most important work to date
Sunshine,166,3,nail_crewd,,200.0,ltbx,I hope this film sparks conversations about real issues we've dismissed as not worth discussing—simply because we believed we already had the answers
Sunshine,166,4,nail_crewd,,200.0,ltbx,Update: One of my favorite movie of 2025
Sunshine,167,1,googlymackyeah,,200.0,ltbx,"mahigpit na yakap sa lahat ng sunshine— sm central olongapo, 12:00nn"

Sunshine,168,5,davidnigelco,,180.0,ltbx,"The movie understands how taboo abortion is in the Philippines, and I really liked how Manila, in its realest self, was portrayed"
Sunshine,168,6,davidnigelco,,180.0,ltbx,The sound mixing also elevates the film to greater heights
Sunshine,168,7,davidnigelco,,180.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is a revelation

Sunshine,174,5,kry_now,,180.0,ltbx,"There was a creative choice that pulled me out of its realism for a bit, but I will say that choice managed to land on its feet by the end"
Sunshine,175,1,direkuge,,180.0,ltbx,"i liked how it has an open-ended ending, whether sunshine pursued the competition with or without the baby inside her"
Sunshine,175,2,direkuge,,180.0,ltbx,highlighting that we are not entitled to her decision or to any woman’s choice about her own body

Sunshine,176,1,scarcyty,,160.0,ltbx,[partial spoiler]Sunshine effectively navigates a controversial choice that leaves the decision making to its audience
Sunshine,176,2,scarcyty,,160.0,ltbx,"The film navigates both choices, but makes a realistic approach nonetheless"
Sunshine,176,3,scarcyty,,160.0,ltbx,"At the beating heart of the film is Maris Racal, who exudes the fragility and innocence of someone who struggles to balance big responsibilities"
Sunshine,176,4,scarcyty,,160.0,ltbx,She is the guiding light of the film

Sunshine,197,3,lanbah,,180.0,ltbx,Such an empathetic film that's filled with so much heart despite how other people make it seem like an immoral decision
Sunshine,197,4,lanbah,,180.0,ltbx,"As Direk Tonet said in the Q and A screening I went to, as a writer, she sides with her characters whether people think the decisions that her character makes is right or wrong"
Sunshine,197,5,lanbah,,180.0,ltbx,"In other words, she doesn't give a fuck what other people thinks about abortion"
Sunshine,197,6,lanbah,,180.0,ltbx,"As for Maris, damn, what a performance"
Sunshine,197,7,lanbah,,180.0,ltbx,She's known to be more expressive and she admits as well that the hardest thing for her is leveling that down that she has to unlearn even the small nuances that she does
Sunshine,197,8,lanbah,,180.0,ltbx,Such a vulnerable performance
Sunshine,197,9,lanbah,,180.0,ltbx,Give her the recognition she deserves
Sunshine,197,10,lanbah,,180.0,ltbx,"We have been behind as a country when it comes to talking about reproductive health and women's rights but I hope given how widely this film is being seen right now that it sparks the necessary conversation not only in our society but also in our government that at the very least, decriminalize abortion"
Sunshine,197,11,lanbah,,180.0,ltbx,Side note: what a complete 180 when I saw this after watching Fantastic Four
Sunshine,198,1,thecritique143,,120.0,ltbx,It is corny when it's soap opera-ish
Sunshine,198,2,thecritique143,,120.0,ltbx,It is effective when it's simplistic
Sunshine,199,1,theod0re,,200.0,ltbx,"sunshine perfectly encapsulates every facet of what abortion looks like in the Philippines: how women resort to dangerous means because of its inaccessibility, the conservatives who set that system up, and the inutile men who exacerbate the plight of women"
Sunshine,199,2,theod0re,,200.0,ltbx,a lot of the scenes had me leaning over
Sunshine,199,3,theod0re,,200.0,ltbx,"the cast is incredible, and maris racal is at her peak"
Sunshine,199,4,theod0re,,200.0,ltbx,i was expecting the movie to fail at delivering a perfect ending but it didn’t
Sunshine,199,5,theod0re,,200.0,ltbx,definitely direk tonet’s magnum opus
Sunshine,200,1,micxfile,,200.0,ltbx,“sana naiintindihan mo na”“gets ko na”that last scene of maris and annika  ang hirap maging babae pero mas lalong mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas
Sunshine,200,2,micxfile,,200.0,ltbx,this film is a must watch
Sunshine,200,3,micxfile,,200.0,ltbx,itong film yung dapat gumagawa ng ingay sa madla eh lalo na in our country where women (especially the young ones) have limited choices
Sunshine,200,4,micxfile,,200.0,ltbx,definitely a must watch
Sunshine,200,5,micxfile,,200.0,ltbx,ang ganda and this is not me being biased just because I like direk tonet as a ka-eme
Sunshine,201,1,yllo_mri,,140.0,ltbx,"thank you, Papa God"
Sunshine,202,1,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Sa Pilipinas, ang mga tulad ni Sunshine ay pinipilit habulin ang liwanag kahit paulit-ulit silang nilulunod sa dilim"
Sunshine,202,2,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Alam naman nating lahat: illegal ang aborsyon sa bansang ito
Sunshine,202,3,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Pero kailanman, hindi ito makakapigil sa aborsyon"
Sunshine,202,4,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Ang nagagawa lang nito ay itulak ang mga babae sa delikado, hindi ligtas, at hindi kontroladong paraan"
Sunshine,202,5,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,At ipinakita sa atin ng pelikulang ito kung gaano ka-mapanganib iyon
Sunshine,202,6,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Mula sa pagbebenta ng pamparegla sa mga black market hanggang sa mga hilot na hindi naman ginagawa ng propesyonal—lahat ‘yan ay repleksyon ng desperasyong hindi nila ginusto, kundi bunga ng sistemang patuloy silang pinapabayaan"
Sunshine,202,7,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Pero hindi lang aborsyon ang laman ng pelikulang ito
Sunshine,202,8,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Binuksan nito ang mas malawak na usapin—bulok na healthcare system, paniniwalang relihiyoso na ginagamit panlaban sa kababaihan, incest, rape, teenage pregnancy, pressure bilang atleta, takot sa kahihiyan, at moralidad na tila laging nakasandal sa pananakit ng babae"
Sunshine,202,9,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Pinakita ng pelikula ang buong paligid ni Sunshine—pamilya, paaralan, simbahan, coach, kaibigan, doktor—at kung paano sila naging bahagi ng problema o ng solusyon"
Sunshine,202,10,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,At sobrang tamang-tama lang na sa Maynila ito kinunan
Sunshine,202,11,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Sa Morayta, Recto, at Quiapo—mga lugar na malapit sa University Belt, kung saan maraming estudyante ang nakakaranas ng hindi planadong pagbubuntis"
Sunshine,202,12,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Mga lugar rin ito na kilala sa underground na kalakaran—mula sa pekeng dokumento hanggang sa black market na pampalaglag
Sunshine,202,13,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Realidad ito ng maraming kabataan, at pinili ng pelikula na hindi ito pagtakpan"
Sunshine,202,14,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Wala itong pa-plot twist
Sunshine,202,15,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Walang engrandeng eksena
Sunshine,202,16,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Pero ramdam mo ang bigat
Sunshine,202,17,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"At naipaabot niya ang mensahe nang malinaw sa masa, sa bawat Pilipinong kailangang mamulat"
Sunshine,202,18,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Hindi para mangumbinsi, kundi para magpasimula ng pag-uusap"
Sunshine,202,19,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Pag-uusap na maaaring maging tulay tungo sa legalisasyon—o kahit dekriminalisasyon—ng aborsyon sa bansa natin
Sunshine,202,20,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Sobrang husay ni Maris Racal
Sunshine,202,21,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Para siyang talagang gymnast
Sunshine,202,22,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Lahat ng galaw may kahulugan
Sunshine,202,23,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Lahat ng tahimik na sandali, may sigaw"
Sunshine,202,24,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Kudos sa choreographers—dahil bawat routine, may sariling kwento"
Sunshine,202,25,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Si Sunshine ay isa lang
Sunshine,202,26,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Pero napakarami pang katulad niya
Sunshine,202,27,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Iba-iba man ang dahilan, iisa ang dapat malinaw: ang desisyon ay dapat laging nasa babae"
Sunshine,202,28,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Sa katawan nila
Sunshine,202,29,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Sa buhay nila
Sunshine,202,30,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Hindi kailangan ng pelikula ng sagot
Sunshine,202,31,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,Pero may lakas ito para magtanong
Sunshine,202,32,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"At sa isang bansang takot harapin ang tanong, sapat na iyon para tawaging rebolusyonaryo"
Sunshine,202,33,aarondavem,,180.0,ltbx,"Sana ang Sunshine na ito, maging sinag ng panibagong simula"
Sunshine,204,1,anxietin,,200.0,ltbx,"direk tonet at maris, what a powerful duo"
Sunshine,204,2,anxietin,,200.0,ltbx,"salamat sa pelikulang to, nawa’y maging tulay to para mas maging bukas ang isipan ng mas maraming tao, mas maraming pilipino, mas maraming mga naka-upo sa kani-kanilang pwesto"
Sunshine,204,3,anxietin,,200.0,ltbx,"sunshine, mahal na mahal kita"
Sunshine,204,4,anxietin,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang tapang mo
Sunshine,204,5,anxietin,,200.0,ltbx,sana balang araw ganitong klaseng pelikula rin ang magawa ko

Sunshine,211,3,craaae,,160.0,ltbx,"lol di kami friends, basing all of this on vibes) for the longest time, and this performance feels like an extension of herself—the most earnest and thoughtful love, care, strength, and compassion she holds off-cam is well-reflected in her role here"

Sunshine,259,3,theindiealistic,,120.0,ltbx,"The clever use of environment makes Maris Racal’s performance feel grounded and central, without overly commenting on political allegories like in Jadaone’s previous work"

Sunshine,269,1,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"There’s a lot to unpack in Sunshine, but let me begin by saying this: Maris Racal owns this character"
Sunshine,269,2,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,There’s no other actress who could have pulled off Sunshine the way she did
Sunshine,269,3,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,She embodied every bit of the character so completely that Maris disappears—you’re not watching Maris as Sunshine; you’re watching Sunshine herself
Sunshine,269,4,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"Her performance is quietly powerful and emotionally charged, grounded in rawness and empathy"

Sunshine,269,11,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,What Sunshine does best is handle a very sensitive subject in our country with sincerity and urgency: the ongoing struggle for bodily autonomy
Sunshine,269,12,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,It quietly and firmly illustrates the emotional toll of being a young woman in a society that refuses to let her decide for herself
Sunshine,269,13,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"And worse, how these conversations remain taboo"
Sunshine,269,14,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,Every silence in the film is so loud

Sunshine,269,17,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"The producers behind Sunshine had to fight to get this film seen—not for profit, but because these are stories that matter"
Sunshine,269,18,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,They pushed forward to open a much-needed conversation on bodily autonomy and reproductive rights
Sunshine,269,19,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"And it’s 2025—yet these issues are still being dismissed, invalidated, or worse, treated like they’re myths"
Sunshine,269,20,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"In truth, they are not up for debate"
Sunshine,269,21,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,They are basic rights that every woman deserves
Sunshine,269,22,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"I only hope that in the years to come, we won’t need another Sunshine just to get people to listen"
Sunshine,269,23,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"Panoorin ang Sunshine, hindi lang dahil gusto n'yo, kundi dahil kailangan"

Sunshine,275,6,cpjimenez,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is disturbing in such a way that a woman, in this modern age, is still left with limited options, or the lack thereof, and has no autonomy in doing informed decisions on her own body amidst retribution of a patriarchal society"

Sunshine,303,1,kodakanph,,160.0,ltbx,"gets ko, sunshine"
Sunshine,304,1,denicevvv,,160.0,ltbx,"since it’s a filipino film, i was honestly expecting it to go the usual filipino route with a reductive take: pregnancy, unsuccessful abortion, realization & regrets, then continuing the pregnancy despite it all because abortion is murder"
Sunshine,304,2,denicevvv,,160.0,ltbx,"but as the story went on, i was surprised it took a more progressive approach yet still left room for familiar cultural and religious themes without pushing a moral agenda"
Sunshine,304,3,denicevvv,,160.0,ltbx,i honestly had a nice watching experience and liked how it handled the topic
Sunshine,305,1,cjisatsu,,200.0,ltbx,"ang talino ng pagkakasulat, bawat framing halatang pinag-isipan"

Sunshine,307,1,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,This movie is arguably one of the best films of the year
Sunshine,307,2,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"It feels incredibly real because it reflects life in the Philippines, where women's rights are acknowledged but often support a male-dominated system and the patriarchy"
Sunshine,307,3,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"""Sunshine"" tells the story of many women living in the Philippines"
Sunshine,307,4,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"In this country, discussions about sex and sex education are frequently considered taboo"
Sunshine,307,5,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"Many people talk about sex negatively, treating it as something sinful rather than educational"
Sunshine,307,6,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"As a result, issues like teenage pregnancy are primarily viewed as public health problems"
Sunshine,307,7,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"Furthermore, while there is a law aimed at protecting women from violence, it forces victims of sexual abuse to carry any resulting pregnancy to term, even in tragic circumstances such as r4p3"
Sunshine,307,8,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"With abortion being illegal in the Philippines, many women find themselves in difficult situations"
Sunshine,307,9,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"Those facing unplanned and unwanted pregnancies may have to consider unsafe options, which can threaten their lives"
Sunshine,307,10,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"Women's rights must prioritize the well-being and choices of women, not men"
Sunshine,307,11,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,The self-righteousness and views of certain religious groups should not dictate whether abortion is legalized
Sunshine,307,12,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,Women must have the power to make choices about their bodies
Sunshine,307,13,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"""Sunshine"" is a story of hope, second chances, and pursuing dreams"
Sunshine,307,14,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,It hopes for a better society where women are not scrutinized for claiming rights over their bodies
Sunshine,307,15,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"This movie is a bold and significant step for film in the Philippines, as it represents the experiences of many women in the country"
Sunshine,307,16,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,We must continue the conversation and let this film be a part of the movement advocating for better women's rights
Sunshine,307,17,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,"Without a doubt, Maris Racal brought life to her character, Sunshine"
Sunshine,307,18,marcloey,,200.0,ltbx,Her outstanding performance solidifies her status as one of the best actresses of this generation
Sunshine,308,1,iittiesociety,,160.0,ltbx,"“gets ko na”the physical representation of sunshine making peace, letting go of her guilt, and getting complete reassurance in her decision, all in the form of the child she once detested, but in the end, loved, was honestly beautiful"
Sunshine,308,2,iittiesociety,,160.0,ltbx,"there is so much love and strength with the child in understanding sunshine’s dreams and circumstances, and how society was truly set against them; two females who were young girls at the end of the day"
Sunshine,308,3,iittiesociety,,160.0,ltbx,"in a way, it reminded me of the popular thought prompt, “if my mother didn’t have me, what kind of life would she have had"
Sunshine,308,4,iittiesociety,,160.0,ltbx,"” it’s a bittersweet thought at first, but there is such genuine love and understanding in seeing your mother past her caregiving responsibilities and wanting to witness her thrive as an independent woman with goals and ambitions, even if it meant losing your existence"
Sunshine,308,5,iittiesociety,,160.0,ltbx,"however, there is also so much love and strength with sunshine deciding what would be best for both her and for the child, even if it hurt"
Sunshine,308,6,iittiesociety,,160.0,ltbx,"sunshine loved the child enough to recognize that she didn’t deserve to be brought into such a cruel world, not when her own mother was still navigating through it, barely managing to survive the horrors she was dealt with"
Sunshine,308,7,iittiesociety,,160.0,ltbx,"she knew she wasn’t ready at all and she didn’t want her child to bear the brunt of it, given what she herself has went through"
Sunshine,308,8,iittiesociety,,160.0,ltbx,"there is love and strength in choosing yourself, recognizing your weaknesses, and acknowledging that both you and your child deserve the best version of yourself; one that has wholeheartedly lived her dreams and life despite societal expectations and harsh realities and one that is ready to help her child to do just the same"
Sunshine,308,9,iittiesociety,,160.0,ltbx,"despite all odds, naintindihan nila yung isa’t isa"
Sunshine,308,10,iittiesociety,,160.0,ltbx,"and out of love, for both themselves and for each other, they both let go"
Sunshine,309,1,bestrestyever,,180.0,ltbx,"every time sunshine makes a decision, i just find myself nodding, quietly saying, “gets ko"
Sunshine,309,2,bestrestyever,,180.0,ltbx,” because i do
Sunshine,309,3,bestrestyever,,180.0,ltbx,"i was shaped by the streets of metro manila, grew up near churches where pampalaglag or pamparegla are sold right outside"
Sunshine,309,4,bestrestyever,,180.0,ltbx,"i've had my own sunshines— close friends, a relative, a classmate — people i care about who’ve gone through the same thing"
Sunshine,309,5,bestrestyever,,180.0,ltbx,"and watching this film, i saw myself in geleen, thea, the kid, and ariana"
Sunshine,309,6,bestrestyever,,180.0,ltbx,you just want your sunshine…
Sunshine,310,1,jelz,,200.0,ltbx,FAVORITE ANTOINETEE JADAONE FILM SO FAR
Sunshine,311,1,bonlateagain,,180.0,ltbx,"Pagkalabas ko ng sinehan, narinig ko na may bumulong na sekyu sa kasamang clerk, “Ano kaya ang kapupulutang aral niyan sa mga kabataan"
Sunshine,311,2,bonlateagain,,180.0,ltbx,"” The moment I heard it, agad ko siyang tinignan ng masama for asking such a silly question…But then I realized—this is what Direk Antoinette Jadaone’s intention of making this film: to spark conversation and address the long-unspoken truths"
Sunshine,311,3,bonlateagain,,180.0,ltbx,"From the lack of support for public hospitals to teenage pregnancy, our country has always been advocates for procreation, pro-union but consistently fails to address the root causes of these issues"
Sunshine,311,4,bonlateagain,,180.0,ltbx,"Indeed, this film is not a fantasy movie that conservatives, like manong guard, might feel comfortable watching"
Sunshine,311,5,bonlateagain,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a bold statement that transcends the drowning noise into a dissent against the systemic issues we have as a nation
Sunshine,311,6,bonlateagain,,180.0,ltbx,"Hats off to the powerful cast of this film, especially to Maris Racal’s promising performance"

Sunshine,316,3,scmontefalcon,,180.0,ltbx,Director Tonet Jadaone takes us into a journey of a short story about this uncomfortable yet important subject with Maris Racal’s on-point performance as the titular character Sunshine
Sunshine,316,4,scmontefalcon,,180.0,ltbx,"From the direction, to the acting, to the perfect casting, the script, the cinematography, and even the sound design, this film near-perfectly incapsulates the struggle of someone who is given no choice but to succumb to secrecy in a world that wants to make choices for her"
Sunshine,316,5,scmontefalcon,,180.0,ltbx,"Such a heavy film, but it’s a film that is overdue"
Sunshine,316,6,scmontefalcon,,180.0,ltbx,The conversations about this film and its subject matter is overdue
Sunshine,316,7,scmontefalcon,,180.0,ltbx,"And with Sunshine, I hope we can finally get the conversation going"
Sunshine,316,8,scmontefalcon,,180.0,ltbx,"Overall, Sunshine delivers a subtle gut punch that leaves a lasting impression, especially of Racal’s performance"

Sunshine,318,3,juantoten,,200.0,ltbx,It creates a compelling backdrop that amplifies their struggles and growth
Sunshine,318,4,juantoten,,200.0,ltbx,"The narrative addresses complex issues with a precise, incisive touch, provocative enough to command attention yet measured enough to avoid alienation"
Sunshine,318,5,juantoten,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s an unpretentious film, hopeful, deliberate, and deeply resonant in its purpose"

Sunshine,324,2,keanuribssss,,200.0,ltbx,"not only does it move the needle on social issues that disproportionately affect girls and women—and villainize their sense of agency—like abortion, the film made sure to pierce it through patriarchy's ass in hopes of slowly tearing apart the very fabric of gender inequality in a highly conservative society"
Sunshine,325,1,whitel4dy,,160.0,ltbx,sobrang bigat sa damdamin

Sunshine,328,1,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine is an aspiring Olympian
Sunshine,328,2,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,She is two weeks away from performing in the qualifying round
Sunshine,328,3,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,"She has won numerous gold medals in local and Asian competitions, making her an ideal candidate for an Olympic gold"
Sunshine,328,4,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,But everything changes when she discovers an unwanted pregnancy
Sunshine,328,5,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,"In a male-dominated, conservative, church-leaning country, who can help Sunshine achieve her dreams"
Sunshine,328,6,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,Jadaone's latest picture is a gritty coming-of-age sports drama that tackles a sensitive yet realistic portrayal of the struggles women face when the government and society turn their backs on them
Sunshine,328,7,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,It is a claustrophobic journey that dims the shine of its lead character even before she sees the end of the tunnel
Sunshine,328,8,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,"The film offers a timely and relevant discussion on gender roles, sex education, the health care system, body autonomy, female rage, and empowerment"
Sunshine,328,9,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,"At its center is Maris Racal, who plays the titular character with grace, bareness, and nuance"
Sunshine,328,10,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,"She embodies the sunshine amidst a dirty, hypocritical, careless, and immovable society that becomes a character of its own"
Sunshine,328,11,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,This is supported by the film’s striking eye for cinematic framing of the ragged city of Manila
Sunshine,328,12,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,"I love how the film handles the core of its subject: should Sunshine get an abortion and continue chasing her dreams, or take the baby and live a life she is not prepared for"
Sunshine,328,13,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,I love how the women characters come together to help each other against the oppressive weight of our patriarchal society
Sunshine,328,14,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,"And when Sunshine finally makes a decision, I don’t think the film wants you to agree or disagree with her"
Sunshine,328,15,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,It wants you to ask why she had to be in this position in the first place
Sunshine,328,16,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,It wants us to notice the shoulder-to-shoulder crowding in public maternity wards
Sunshine,328,17,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,"It wants us to see the hypocrisy of a society where black markets for abortion operate in the shadows of churches, and why a woman still cannot make a decision about her own body without judgment from everyone around her"
Sunshine,328,18,sirmiroro,,180.0,ltbx,"Pero gets kita, Sunshine"

Sunshine,341,7,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,"As linear and straightforward as the film appears, beneath it lies a complex character study — fearlessly told, thematically sharp, and emotionally unsettling"
Sunshine,341,8,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone writes for women, and in a cinematic landscape like ours, we need more voices like hers"
Sunshine,341,9,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,"I was initially worried about where the story would go, but it was brave enough to take the harder path"
Sunshine,341,10,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,This is Maris Racal's best performance yet — nuanced and quietly powerful
Sunshine,341,11,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,But it was Jennica Garcia who stole every scene she was in
Sunshine,341,12,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,"She was the emotional anchor, the tearjerker"
Sunshine,341,13,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,"Some casting choices outside the leads, however, fell short"
Sunshine,341,14,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,Certain scenes and narrative decisions could have landed harder with stronger performances or more fitting direction
Sunshine,341,15,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,"That said, the editing needs work"
Sunshine,341,16,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,"The presence of a stunt double in certain scenes is obvious, breaking immersion"
Sunshine,341,17,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,"While the film’s visuals hauntingly capture a side of Manila we rarely see on screen, the sound design lacks polish"
Sunshine,341,18,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,These flaws are noticeable but not deal-breaking
Sunshine,341,19,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,"Still, this film succeeds in doing what few others do: it makes you ask what is ethical and what is not"
Sunshine,341,20,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,It invites reflection
Sunshine,341,21,newrev,,160.0,ltbx,"And when a film draws that line clearly for society to see, perhaps that’s when the sun truly begins to shine"

Sunshine,363,1,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"The film has a sense of urgency about it, presenting the drama with so much eagerness, firm convictions, and intense sentiments nearly to the point where it devolves into cheap propaganda for a cause with which I happen to agree ideologically"
Sunshine,363,2,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It was too on the nose and constantly going for shock value that it was draining to follow, brazenly provoking the audience to feel for a horrible social reality but instead of pointing it out with a nod and a commentary, it was trying so hard to make them feel bad about those situations"
Sunshine,363,3,bcd2114,,,ltbx,Not in a good way because it is one of those things that breeds frustration rather than empathy for the protagonist
Sunshine,363,4,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"At some point, Sunshine simply disappeared, becoming a vessel for the audience to put their shoes on since she is subjected to so much oppression, losing any semblance of agency as it is all about how messed up her social reality has become"
Sunshine,363,5,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It's the same problem I had with war films and other poverty porn, where it ignores developing the protagonist in favor of escalating the situations in front of her and throwing every miserable conflicts imaginable at her"
Sunshine,363,6,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"To be fair, the protagonist as a vessel had an aspiration, a threatened dream that was about to be broken, and the idea of her interacting with all these women, smoothly transitioning from the one who needed help to the one who provided help, clearly distinguished the film from those with a typical point-of-view character"
Sunshine,363,7,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"Those moments of empowerment and camaraderie with other women may have eased the tension and made it feel more hopeful than the premise implies, but it also falls into the trap of caricaturing other characters for the sake of cheap sensationalism"
Sunshine,363,8,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It also felt betraying that so many things transpired that the gymnastics was set aside for so long, and I would hope that it was more of an escape than a hardship because no joy was displayed during those routines except for the last act"
Sunshine,363,9,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"I would say that the sport was not seamlessly wedded to the character, since it could have been any sport or dream, and the film would still be effective"
Sunshine,363,10,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"The magical realism element is essentially what I detest about the film, because it could have lingered in the loneliness and allowed the audience to connect with the character through subtlety, but it had to be filled with hypothetical conversation that hits the audience on the head to explain the themes and demonstrate the unspoken dilemmas in the present predicament"
Sunshine,363,11,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It could be interpreted as a mean to communicate guilt, a process of forgiving oneself and empathizing with other women, or as humanizing the fetus inside the body, which I'm not sure how to feel about that ideologically"
Sunshine,363,12,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It's also tonally odd, which is a Philippine cinema branding at this point, but it's always convenient to use a child for humor, and it reduces the overall tone of what's happening to the main character"
Sunshine,363,13,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It was just too telegraphed at times, and I was hoping to let the sequences play out and use more silence because those are the scenes I enjoy when the protagonist is alone and burdened by her situation"
Sunshine,363,14,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"The upward momentum of a film that begins bleakly will always impede any form of storytelling because it must outdo itself, building emotions that are overwhelming every ten minutes to the point of monotony"
Sunshine,363,15,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"In fact, I can't recall the chronology of the film even though I saw it yesterday, but I do remember every segments and the emotions it was going for"
Sunshine,363,16,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It actually came to the point of absurdity in the third act, when one character emerged, followed by a terrible circumstances, followed by even more bleak information and an unsettling confrontation, which would undoubtedly disturb anyone"
Sunshine,363,17,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"And then there was a cameo in which the small theater collectively whisper and giggle a bit as a result of being taken off guard, which again felt awkward because it always has to make a joke after every other miserably effective scene"
Sunshine,363,18,bcd2114,,,ltbx,Not letting the moments breathe for a while
Sunshine,363,19,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It can even be tonally confusing at times, with scenes that is either attempting to be comical or unsettling as some of the dialogue was just satirical and they incorporate some triggering monologue ala Vincentiments, but they also made the film lighthearted, which I am not sure is a good thing"
Sunshine,363,20,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"I suppose I want my abortion movies to be more thought-provoking and full of sociological nuances rather than funny and emotional, because it can be too loose for its sensitive subject matter, but it was heartfelt and that was good"
Sunshine,363,21,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"I'm making it seem like I hate this film when than I don't because it was terrific and entertaining, but it's just that I'm not sure if those are the things I want to take away from this film"
Sunshine,363,22,bcd2114,,,ltbx,I have to say though that it had a very good filmmaking mechanics
Sunshine,363,23,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"I heard they tried to hide the camera in public scenes to make the setting appear more authentic, and I was expecting long takes because it was another Filipino film about a protagonist wandering around which they did not employ at all, but I kind of like what they did here, from the shot composition and coverages to the way they were edited together"
Sunshine,363,24,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"The only criticism I had regarding the filmmaking was the noticeable stunt double in the gymnastic routines, as well as how the emotions in the close-ups did not match those in the wide shots whenever they intercut them together"
Sunshine,363,25,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"I suspect no one grins when doing gymnastics since it is a serious performance by meticulous athletes rather than by an exuberant victorious person, as the film claims at the conclusion"
Sunshine,363,26,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"It's just a little quibble, but I commend the filmmaking overall and even the rough cuts were fantastic"
Sunshine,363,27,bcd2114,,,ltbx,"Definitely the best-directed Filipino film I've seen in quite some time, I can say that with confidence"
Sunshine,364,1,mywrldsbl,,200.0,ltbx,"Ung after niya ikuwento ung kuwento niya in the most perfect way and in a language na she knows best, she asks (dares, almost) ""Naiintindihan mo naman ako di ba"

Sunshine,372,2,ohjhaymeskhylle,,200.0,ltbx,"bringing life into this world should also not be disguised as a “blessing”, especially when the means to raise the child is little to none"
Sunshine,372,3,ohjhaymeskhylle,,200.0,ltbx,"maawa kayo sa mga batang walang makain, walang matinong tirahan, hindi makapag-aral, at hindi masulit ang pagiging bata"

Sunshine,374,4,neuboi,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a powerful, no-frills story set in the gritty, chaotic streets of Manila"
Sunshine,374,5,neuboi,,160.0,ltbx,It follows a young gymnast whose future gets shaken when she finds out she’s pregnant
Sunshine,374,6,neuboi,,160.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone tells this story the way she does best—letting silence, glances, and small gestures speak louder than words"
Sunshine,374,7,neuboi,,160.0,ltbx,No drama for drama’s sake

Sunshine,375,1,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,This film tackles numerous points that need to be discussed
Sunshine,375,2,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,"It provides a comprehensive overview of the different systemic issues that our country is not addressing, ranging from the double standards imposed on women to the societal barriers that make it difficult for women to meet these standards"
Sunshine,375,3,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,It is an irony between what society wants for women and how society sets up women to fail to meet these standards
Sunshine,375,4,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,"That's where the ""bullsht-ery"" comes in, as this film successfully sends it to its audience"
Sunshine,375,5,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,"I want to say a lot of things about this film, on how it provides a good argument, on how it provides a good piece of reality that is not glorified nor romanticized and on how it gave us something that will not just be left on the cinema, but to be talked about in the streets and on the media"
Sunshine,375,6,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,"I really understand the fear of the production of showing this in the Philippines, but I believe that strong and brave films like this are what we need, to not just start conversations but to challenge the views we have as individuals and as a collective"
Sunshine,375,7,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,"This is the kind of film that everyone needs to watch, as it will definitely afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted"

Sunshine,379,3,mityardbirds,,100.0,ltbx,"Matino ang mga pangalawang aktor, may tamang balanse ng kritikang panlipunan—ng mga gagong biktima ng sistema (at sadyang gago lang) at mga gustong maging mabuti sa gitna nito—at may gustong sabihin, ipaunawa"
Sunshine,379,4,mityardbirds,,100.0,ltbx,"Nakakapag-isip ka, nakakapili"
Sunshine,379,5,mityardbirds,,100.0,ltbx,"Ito si Jadaone kapag nasa labas ng dikta ng studio, kapag malaya—tulad noong bago pa siya gumawa (o kapag hindi gumagawa) ng mga nakakautang romcom na ginawa nang hubugan ng mga sumunod sa kaniya"

Sunshine,381,15,rufino_angelo,,200.0,ltbx,Nakokontrol na nga ba tayo ng relihiyon at kultura kung saan ang mga lalaki ang palaging namumuno
Sunshine,381,16,rufino_angelo,,200.0,ltbx,"Katulad ng conclave na puro lalaki ang bumoboto, nagtatalaga ng pinakamakapangyarihang lider ng simbahan"
Sunshine,381,17,rufino_angelo,,200.0,ltbx,"Samantala, ang babae'y itinutulak na maging ina: tungkulin daw niya ang isakripisyo ang kanyang pangarap, ang kanyang tinig"

Sunshine,386,1,pancitkenton,,180.0,ltbx,as an rg fan i was prepared to be disappointed by the gymnastics
Sunshine,386,2,pancitkenton,,180.0,ltbx,but it was surprisingly great
Sunshine,386,3,pancitkenton,,180.0,ltbx,"accurate 'yung skills to the CoP at the time, and maganda 'yung execution and flow of the routines imoi think for narrative/symbolic purposes 'yung pag-focus on training the ribbon, but i wish maris's character also trained with the other 3 apparatus kahit saglit kasi nagmukha siyang ribbon specialist, which isn't really a thingalso: what qualifiers"
Sunshine,386,4,pancitkenton,,180.0,ltbx,"also not really a thing, unless they mean the qualification round of a specific competition (the asian champs)"
Sunshine,386,5,pancitkenton,,180.0,ltbx,"anyway, i nitpicked the rg part because the story, the acting, and everything else was done really well :-) love the message surrounding reproductive rights and how the patriarchal system disadvantages, HARMS, women"

Sunshine,390,1,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone has always been one of the few Filipino filmmakers I deeply admire, not just for her craft, but for the way she tells women’s stories with empathy and nuance"
Sunshine,390,2,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,"Her work has always felt personal, films like Alone/Together, Fan Girl and now Sunshine, might just be my favorite Filipino film released this year so far"
Sunshine,390,3,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,I remember seeing the trailer last year and wondering if it would even get a proper release here
Sunshine,390,4,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,"It tackles such a taboo topic, one that many in this country still refuse to even speak about"
Sunshine,390,5,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,That’s why I admire Jadaone so much
Sunshine,390,6,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,She’s chosen to talk about what others won’t
Sunshine,390,7,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,"In a predominantly Catholic nation where abortion is criminalized, even in cases of rape or incest, Sunshine feels like an act of courage"
Sunshine,390,8,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,I’ve always been pro-choice
Sunshine,390,9,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,"I grew up surrounded by the whole “abortion is murder” narrative, from relatives, from my old Catholic school run by nuns"
Sunshine,390,10,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,"But even as a kid, it never sat right with me"
Sunshine,390,11,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,I never saw it as a sin
Sunshine,390,12,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,"And now that I’m studying to become a doctor, that belief matters even more to me, because women deserve healthcare that doesn’t judge or shame them"
Sunshine,390,13,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine affected me on a personal level because of that
Sunshine,390,14,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,It reminded me why I want to do this
Sunshine,390,15,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,It’s not a perfect film
Sunshine,390,16,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,Some might find the pacing fast or feel like it didn’t say enough
Sunshine,390,17,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,"But to me, the point isn’t perfection"
Sunshine,390,18,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,What matters is that it exists
Sunshine,390,19,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,It dares
Sunshine,390,20,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s a film that opens doors, uncomfortable ones, sure, but necessary"
Sunshine,390,21,_filmonella,,160.0,ltbx,I really hope it’s not the last of its kind
Sunshine,391,1,kianfilmsx,,200.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,392,1,cerses,,160.0,ltbx,"Maris plays Sunshine with so much empathy that it permeates outside the screen, her win is our win, her disappointment is our disappointment"
Sunshine,392,2,cerses,,160.0,ltbx,"Through the streets of Manila to the corners of her room, we get to hold hands with her and be a confidant"
Sunshine,392,3,cerses,,160.0,ltbx,"I like how it positions the audience as part of this journey, not as the usual bystander"
Sunshine,392,4,cerses,,160.0,ltbx,"One sequence that stood out is the one from the inn to the hospital - Maris lets herself be consumed by Sunshine, almost as if the creeping is part of the routine itself"
Sunshine,392,5,cerses,,160.0,ltbx,The messaging gets confusing in the middle but ultimately ends in a tender moment of acceptance and determination
Sunshine,392,6,cerses,,160.0,ltbx,I’m just happy films like this finally exist in our country
Sunshine,393,1,iamtomreuh,,200.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,394,1,christian_davao,,160.0,ltbx,shuta ang galing ni Maris
Sunshine,395,1,romebisaya,,180.0,ltbx,I knew Sunshine was a good film even before watching it because Antoinette Jadaone has consistently delivered satisfying work throughout her career
Sunshine,395,2,romebisaya,,180.0,ltbx,"I had the chance to watch it in a cinema in Cebu, surrounded by fellow film enthusiasts, including Maris Racal and Antoinette Jadaone in the audience"
Sunshine,395,3,romebisaya,,180.0,ltbx,I teared up multiple times
Sunshine,395,4,romebisaya,,180.0,ltbx,"This is a woman’s story, one that powerfully captures her control over her body and her choices"
Sunshine,395,5,romebisaya,,180.0,ltbx,"The film's use of magical realism elevated the narrative, turning what could have been dull internal monologues into vibrant, engaging character portrayals by the actors"
Sunshine,395,6,romebisaya,,180.0,ltbx,It’s no surprise the film has already received international recognition
Sunshine,395,7,romebisaya,,180.0,ltbx,"It absolutely deserves it, and even more"
Sunshine,396,1,jikan_desu,,160.0,ltbx,Hindi ako nahihiya
Sunshine,396,2,jikan_desu,,160.0,ltbx,"Ayokong maging nanay Needless to say dahil expected na, pero ang galing ni Maris at Jennica"
Sunshine,396,3,jikan_desu,,160.0,ltbx,That leaning-on-shoulder scene nila sa taxi ang fave kong ganung moment in Asian cinema
Sunshine,396,4,jikan_desu,,160.0,ltbx,"Natuwa ako na nandito si Angeli Bayani, bilang isang compassionate na doctor"
Sunshine,397,1,danekylle,,180.0,ltbx,gets ko na
Sunshine,397,2,danekylle,,180.0,ltbx,gosh what a powerful one-liner to end and encapsulate the entire progression of the film
Sunshine,397,3,danekylle,,180.0,ltbx,"sobrang powerful that the child gets it; she understands and respects the reasons behind Sunshine's choices, even at the expense of her own life"
Sunshine,397,4,danekylle,,180.0,ltbx,"sobrang powerful din ng scene before the last routine, with jennica and maris, na kahit anong desisyon ni Sunshine, mage-gets ng ate niya"
Sunshine,397,5,danekylle,,180.0,ltbx,"at ganoon din yung goal ng pelikula—na ma-gets nating lahat why people resort to abortion,…"
Sunshine,398,1,iclrxa,,200.0,ltbx,"for as many times as we sit and talk about unwanted pregnancies and abortion, there is a woman out there na katulad ni sunshine na dala-dala ang bigat ng desisyong siya lang ang pwedeng gumawa"
Sunshine,398,2,iclrxa,,200.0,ltbx,"conversations regarding this matter often talk about the cause and consequences, but never once did we talk about the process women have to endure— the grief, the confusion, the isolation"
Sunshine,398,3,iclrxa,,200.0,ltbx,it was never just in black and white
Sunshine,398,4,iclrxa,,200.0,ltbx,hindi lang siya basta nabuntis at mas lalong hindi lang siya basta nagdesisyon
Sunshine,398,5,iclrxa,,200.0,ltbx,this film showed everything in between
Sunshine,398,6,iclrxa,,200.0,ltbx,"it was an honest attempt to potray the realities women go through, a reminder that we are free to dream and we are free to live life the way we choose to"
Sunshine,399,1,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"In a Q&A with writer-director Antoinette Jadaone that I was lucky to attend, she was asked how she braced for the potential backlash of this film from Filipino audiences given our mostly conservative background"
Sunshine,399,2,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"Her answer resonated with me deeply: As a writer, Jadaone believes her primary duty is to stay loyal to her characters"
Sunshine,399,3,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"If her character's arc demands visiting unnerving and controversial depths, she is not afraid to take the plunge - regardless of how viewers might perceive it"
Sunshine,399,4,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"Her earlier work, Fan Girl (2020), already painted a similar picture, albeit a bit spottily"
Sunshine,399,5,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"Jadaone takes her boldest steps yet in her latest work, Sunshine (2024), by tackling abortion, a highly contentious subject in the country, with both sensitivity and grit"
Sunshine,399,6,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"This entry is unflinching in its commentary, taking us to the most harrowing places women can be in a nation where sexual abuse is prevalent, abortion is illegal, and healthcare fails the underprivileged"
Sunshine,399,7,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine, our protagonist, is a skilled gymnast, but even she can't leap over patriarchy, tumble past outdated laws, or cartwheel her way out of the conservative society and system"
Sunshine,399,8,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"In one scene, Sunshine waits along a street choked with tricycles, behind the railing of a pharmacy counter - she is jailed in and by this wretched city, made a criminal for wanting to make a choice that should be her right"
Sunshine,399,9,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,But this film's Manila is more than just Sunshine's prison
Sunshine,399,10,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"It's a breathing character, trailing her around from scene to scene"

Sunshine,399,16,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine makes her choices, but her choices are only as good as this bleak, brutal city allows"
Sunshine,399,17,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal delivers a phenomenal performance, portraying our protagonist with nuance and raw intensity"
Sunshine,399,18,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"She is backed by a stellar ensemble - Jennica Garcia, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, and Elijah Canlas - each breathing life into characters that are authentic and vital to the film's message"
Sunshine,399,19,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"The sequences are daring, the story beats sometimes violent, but always necessary"
Sunshine,399,20,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"The music elevates it all, with a standout Challengers-esque score underscoring the gymnastic scenes"
Sunshine,399,21,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"This film is not without its faults though, with excessive cursing (seriously, again in a Project 8 work"
Sunshine,399,22,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,"), somewhat awkward acting, and some unpolished plot points, but these are forgivable given how effective the complete work is"
Sunshine,399,23,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine may very well be Direk Tonet's finest work yet - and rightly so
Sunshine,399,24,pinathbutter,,180.0,ltbx,It stands as one of the most important Filipino films in the modern times
Sunshine,400,1,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,first time watching a screening at a cinema with the star herself (ANG GANDA MO SA PERSONAL MARIS WTF)
Sunshine,400,2,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,such a great film with brilliant creative choices all throughout
Sunshine,400,3,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,so emotional and so so real
Sunshine,400,4,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,only a female director could masterfully tell this story
Sunshine,400,5,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,"edit: after the second watch, i realized how empowering and important it was to portray this story using sports as a metaphor to her bodily autonomy"
Sunshine,400,6,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,"everybody loves her when she uses her body to look beautiful for the world, but when mishap occurs, she is shamed for it"
Sunshine,400,7,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,"yet, in the end, i noticed that the last thing she declares about her pregnancy is a statement that is so bold and firm: “Ayoko maging nanay"
Sunshine,400,8,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,” right in front of the men who tried to control her decisions
Sunshine,400,9,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,which maybe leaves the audience to think: “what happened after that
Sunshine,400,10,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,"” but the point is that her decision, her body, and her passion, are all unshakably hers until the end"
Sunshine,400,11,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,"and we see that because after that scene with miggy and his dad, she practices her routine again"
Sunshine,400,12,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,and then it was so perfect-had tears in my eyes the whole time
Sunshine,400,13,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,"in that gymnasium, Sunshine “drowns out the noise"
Sunshine,400,14,dewonroses,,200.0,ltbx,"” what remains is her unwavering bond with her body, both as a woman and as a gymnast"

Sunshine,402,2,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,what a gem of philippine cinema
Sunshine,402,3,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,you know a film is good when it makes you want to create again
Sunshine,402,4,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,"however, while undeniable in its prowess and relevance, its potency and impact dwindles in its struggle to pinpoint with conviction who its target audience is"
Sunshine,402,5,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,"it seems to want to pander to both liberal and conservative audiences, but this muddles its message"
Sunshine,402,6,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,who is this film really for
Sunshine,402,7,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,who is it in dialogue with
Sunshine,402,8,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,"i thought that the choice to portray the unborn fetus as a grown, conscious being was counterintuitive at first, but then i realized the film was only trying to meet its conservative audiences halfway in their beliefs"
Sunshine,402,9,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,"then i thought it was a stroke of genius: of course, the only way to convince someone to change their mind is by explaining it in the terms they understand, through their perspective of the world"
Sunshine,402,10,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,but then it also alienates this very audience by demonizing them in the film
Sunshine,402,11,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,"while it successfully empathizes with the horrors of being a woman in the philippines, there is a lack of nuance, a dichotomy of good vs"
Sunshine,402,12,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,"evil, that might be more harmful than helpful in the grander scheme of things"
Sunshine,402,13,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,"(there are also so many scenes where maris racal’s quiet yet powerful performance should have been enough, but the beauty of the moment is ruined by the “child” voicing out sunshine’s thoughts, spoon-feeding the audience"
Sunshine,402,14,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,)only particularly critical because i think sunshine is an exciting step in the right direction for ph cinema
Sunshine,402,15,iauqmaj,,,ltbx,i loved it and i think everyone should still watch it in spite of its flaws
Sunshine,403,1,angelnorin,,180.0,ltbx,"As someone who is always online, I often encounter issues that are difficult to discuss, to the point where I sometimes become desensitized and think, 'ahh shit, eh ganyan talaga that's life"
Sunshine,403,2,angelnorin,,180.0,ltbx,"' I knew that the main topic of this movie is abortion, and after watching the movie as a woman and a Filipino, I was reminded na hindi kasi abortion 'lang', there are so many layers to it, may it be sexual education, healthcare, and the patriarchal society we…"
Sunshine,404,1,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"The tone set by Sunshine over Jadaone's previous film, Fangirl, is way different"
Sunshine,404,2,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"The urgency of survival is apparent and how it clashes with the film's thematic journey, like Paul Soriano's Thelma"
Sunshine,404,3,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"Though Sunshine tends to get the feel of guerrilla direction, it is a combination of the director's experiences in mainstream and her indie roots"
Sunshine,404,4,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"Meaning, we get to see well-lighted scenes and less usage of shake cam"
Sunshine,404,5,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine unpacks a lot of society's ills and inequalities
Sunshine,404,6,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"Patriarchy, discrimination in the medical field, inhumane laws, and glaring social class issues that don't benefit those without that much"
Sunshine,404,7,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"In a country where religion reigns, or so they say, the film easily relays problems with well-made sequences and heartbreaking results"
Sunshine,404,8,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"Jadaone knows the voices of her characters, and it tells a distinct topic with passion and wit, giving the audiences a rollercoaster of emotions"
Sunshine,404,9,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,One thing that makes this film unique is the inclusion of a fantastic element
Sunshine,404,10,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"It somehow references, or a styling of, what they had in Death Note anime or Big Mouth to make it more accurate"
Sunshine,404,11,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,And such symbolism as Sunshine's conscience made it relatively easier to tell the film's narrative
Sunshine,404,12,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"It was smartly added, and it didn't make the audience unintelligent"
Sunshine,404,13,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,The technical are overwhelmingly great
Sunshine,404,14,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"The use of lighting in urban areas, especially those scenes shot at night, is worthy of a picturesque view of the marginalized reality"
Sunshine,404,15,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,We rarely see such strong shots in film
Sunshine,404,16,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,The options to use close-ups for intensity of emotions and certain decisions to make the scenes with Mariz Racal's gymnastic performance were made with careful efficiency
Sunshine,404,17,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,And the sound editing was just on point
Sunshine,404,18,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,It is technically the protagonist's in-ear audio being shared with the viewers
Sunshine,404,19,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,Jadaone's casting is really one for the books
Sunshine,404,20,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,An appreciation to Mariz Racal's graceful bookend performance
Sunshine,404,21,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"The representation is exactly what we need to see from young adults, especially in the situation of what is happening to her character"
Sunshine,404,22,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"The conflict-bearers really made the sequences memorable, and it made you think of the situations presented"
Sunshine,404,23,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,These aren't farfetched ideas shown in the film
Sunshine,404,24,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,Most of them are realistically sound and Piolo Pascual's short stint really is just something for us to gasp about
Sunshine,404,25,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,And we also get to see Jennica Garcia and Elijah Canlas' supporting roles to complete the ensemble
Sunshine,404,26,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,Les we forget Annika Co's strong personality
Sunshine,404,27,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,I guess we have another star made by the director
Sunshine,404,28,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,And regarding Meryll Soriano being part of the film
Sunshine,404,29,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,"It made me remember how she did a similar role back in 2010, as Lizette in the Mark Meily film, Donor"
Sunshine,404,30,targrod,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine displays what needs to be said in a society when abortion is considered a taboo topic

Sunshine,431,30,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,Every detail feels honest
Sunshine,431,31,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,"If I have only one criticism, it's that the magical realism elements could have been woven in more seamlessly"
Sunshine,431,32,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,But even that doesn’t take away from the film’s quiet power
Sunshine,431,33,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,Then there’s the acting
Sunshine,431,34,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,Maris Racal delivers the role of a lifetime

Sunshine,431,37,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,"Her presence is magnetic, and together, their chemistry feels lived-in and true"
Sunshine,431,38,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,"In every sense, Sunshine is a landmark film"
Sunshine,431,39,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,It should be our Oscar submission for next year
Sunshine,431,40,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,"And if there’s any justice, it should sweep every local award"
Sunshine,431,41,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,It’s not just a movie
Sunshine,431,42,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,It’s a mirror
Sunshine,431,43,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,One we’ve long needed in a country as patriarchal and hypocritical as ours
Sunshine,431,44,highlynocturnal,,180.0,ltbx,"The kind of mirror that’s often hard for Filipinos to look into, but impossible to ignore"

Sunshine,432,2,missartt,,180.0,ltbx,Mag-thank you kayo kay Papa God dahil sa pelikulang to
Sunshine,433,1,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,Some films entertain you
Sunshine,433,2,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine confronts you
Sunshine,433,3,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"When the credits rolled, no one moved"
Sunshine,433,4,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,No one spoke
Sunshine,433,5,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,It was that rare kind of silence
Sunshine,433,6,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"Not awkward, but sacred"
Sunshine,433,7,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,As if we had all just witnessed something painfully true and didn’t quite know what to do with ourselves
Sunshine,433,8,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,Because Sunshine isn’t just a movie
Sunshine,433,9,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,It’s a question
Sunshine,433,10,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,A confrontation
Sunshine,433,11,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"Directed with clarity and deep compassion by Direk Tonet Jadaone, Sunshine doesn’t soften its message or try to make it more palatable"
Sunshine,433,12,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,It’s brave
Sunshine,433,13,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,It’s loud in its honesty
Sunshine,433,14,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,It doesn’t ask for permission to be angry or tired or vulnerable
Sunshine,433,15,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"It simply is, and that’s why it hits the way it does"
Sunshine,433,16,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"And yet, somehow, even with all its emotional weight, Direk Tonet’s signature humor still finds its way through"
Sunshine,433,17,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,There are moments—unexpected but perfectly timed—when the entire cinema bursts into laughter
Sunshine,433,18,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s sharp, it’s honest, and it never feels out of place"
Sunshine,433,19,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,Maybe Direk Tonet makes us laugh because she knows we’ll cry eventually
Sunshine,433,20,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"Or maybe that’s just how we are as Filipinos, finding humor even in the heaviest moments, because sometimes, it’s the only way we know how to carry the pain"
Sunshine,433,21,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,What makes this film even more powerful is how it gives voice to things we often overlook
Sunshine,433,22,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"As someone who isn’t a woman, I know I can’t fully grasp the weight of that experience"
Sunshine,433,23,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,But this film opened a window for me
Sunshine,433,24,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"A clear, honest glimpse into a reality I will never live, but need to see"
Sunshine,433,25,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,Much of that power comes from the performances
Sunshine,433,26,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal, as Sunshine, delivers the most vulnerable and grounded work of her career"
Sunshine,433,27,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"Her pain is quiet, but it radiates"
Sunshine,433,28,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"You feel it in the way she holds her breath between words, in the weight behind her gaze"
Sunshine,433,29,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"Jennica Garcia, as her sister, is just as affecting"
Sunshine,433,30,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"Her stillness, her softness, the way she listens"
Sunshine,433,31,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"She becomes a reflection of what the film asks of us: to pause, to witness, to respond with care"
Sunshine,433,32,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,There’s a moment near the end that stuck with me
Sunshine,433,33,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine asks, “Gets mo na ba ako"
Sunshine,433,34,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"”And while it’s said to the person in the room, it felt like she was looking straight through the screen, asking us, the viewers"
Sunshine,433,35,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"And like that person beside her, I hope we all have the courage to say: Yes"
Sunshine,433,36,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,We see you
Sunshine,433,37,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,We understand
Sunshine,433,38,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"Please, Direk Tonet, keep making films like this (inutusan pa nga)"
Sunshine,433,39,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,"Keep telling stories that hold space for women to be everything—loud and quiet, strong and hurting, tired and brave"
Sunshine,433,40,ajduyac,,160.0,ltbx,Stories that make people feel seen

Sunshine,438,5,polarizzz,,200.0,ltbx,as it should
Sunshine,438,6,polarizzz,,200.0,ltbx,"because IT IS very important to talk about, especially since people tend to not gaf—or rather think that such a topic is forbidden, but nope, this film will leave you with no choice but to raise discussions with someonesobrang nakakadurog ng puso isipin na dahil walang suporta ng kahit ano at sino at dahil hindi legalized ang abortion sa Pilipinas, many pregnant women—especially those who didn’t even choose to get pregnant—would resort to alternative ways that’ll put their lives on the line"
Sunshine,438,7,polarizzz,,200.0,ltbx,(yung 13-yr-old girl) :( it’s really a very powerful film that delivers a very powerful message

Sunshine,450,22,wanderflash,,180.0,ltbx,"isa sa mga pagkukulang ng mga institusyong nagsisilbi dapat sa nakararami, hindi ng mga bata"

Sunshine,471,13,rapaeng95,,160.0,ltbx,Andami kong napanood na Filipino films lately
Sunshine,472,1,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,Sunshine (2024) would be a perfect double feature with Eliza Hittman's Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) as they both tackle similar topics but with a stark difference in privilege and access
Sunshine,472,2,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,"where the latter becomes a story of sisterhood and compassion, as two girls cross state lines to get access to healthcare, Sunshine offers no such respite to our eponymous protagonist"
Sunshine,472,3,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,"in here, what Sunshine wants is not even a matter of choice, it is something that she is forced to bear"
Sunshine,472,4,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,"all alone as her confidants succumb to the stigma of her dilemma, Sunshine takes to the streets of Manila in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy"
Sunshine,472,5,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,the plot moves along while the audience is served scenes of what i believe to be one of the better cinematic depictions of modern Manila
Sunshine,472,6,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,the first few minutes almost feel like an entirely different film (one i would have particularly liked more) until the plot takes a peculiar detour
Sunshine,472,7,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,in all of its realism and poignancy i found a particular element in its storytelling very out of place and oftentimes distracting
Sunshine,472,8,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,while the ending made me understand why those choices were made i just don't think a semblance of Magical Realism is the perfect vehicle for a message as heavy as this one
Sunshine,472,9,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,"while i think the point that: ""an entire generation of Filipino women being forced to reckon with their unborn children as if the choice of abortion is something that has to be explained, and in turn, be understood"
Sunshine,472,10,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,""" is a step in the right direction for this nation's pro-choice discourse, the delivery just felt like it was bordering into Diary of an Unborn Child territory"
Sunshine,472,11,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,"with that being said, i still thoroughly enjoyed Sunshine and i would still highly recommend it"
Sunshine,472,12,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,"despite some of my grievances with the film, the unblemished ray of sunshine known as Maris Racal delivers a stellar performance in the titular role"
Sunshine,472,13,farscribe,,120.0,ltbx,perhaps even a mariesteller one

Sunshine,476,4,kuromiyu,,160.0,ltbx,"it shows what women, especially the youth, endure when defying the harshly conservative norms of filipino culture — the pressure, the judgement, the weight of it all"
Sunshine,476,5,kuromiyu,,160.0,ltbx,ang husay ni maris for delivering the pain and struggle
Sunshine,476,6,kuromiyu,,160.0,ltbx,"kudos to miss antoinette jadaone for capturing the reality of our country with raw honesty, even calling out how our healthcare system fails women"
Sunshine,477,1,icedcofea,,160.0,ltbx,"It is not as moving as I thought it could be, but remains an important film for the conversations it can inspire"
Sunshine,477,2,icedcofea,,160.0,ltbx,"For a film that tackles such an important and sensitive theme, I just wished it had stronger sense of conviction"
Sunshine,477,3,icedcofea,,160.0,ltbx,3 1/2 star but the extra half star is for the performances (we love you Jennica and Maris) and some good shots that reminded me of Brocka— grounded and very telling of the realities of life in Manila

Sunshine,482,2,zarvindale,,120.0,ltbx,"It’s horrible for my cinephile ass out here…This is the Happening of Filipino cinema, except it’s less thrilling and more aligned with the traditional storytelling of Filipino drama"
Sunshine,482,3,zarvindale,,120.0,ltbx,"Perhaps my favorite element of this new project from Antoinette Jadaone is the contrast between morality and sin as personified by the hawker who sells abortion pills behind figures of saints beside Quiapo Church, which is arguably the most popular place of veneration among Catholic Filipinos throughout the country"
Sunshine,482,4,zarvindale,,120.0,ltbx,"Beyond that, I’m struggling to seek nuance and proper closure"
Sunshine,482,5,zarvindale,,120.0,ltbx,"What sets this work, aside from the palpable gentleness toward the female main character, apart from the many stories about abortion out there"
Sunshine,482,6,zarvindale,,120.0,ltbx,"It’s worth noting, however, that stories about women are told by women, just like what Jadaone manages to deliver here"
Sunshine,482,7,zarvindale,,120.0,ltbx,"I believe (cis) male filmmakers, no matter how genuine their intent is, cannot tell stories about women because women’s danas, the distinct Filipino word for experience, is not men’s danas"

Sunshine,489,13,pm1spicy,,200.0,ltbx,"Sometimes it feels like the film is about to lean into pro-life messaging, with ""what if"" hypotheticals and future-president guilt trips"
Sunshine,489,14,pm1spicy,,200.0,ltbx,"But instead of reinforcing those ideas, it pulls them apart"
Sunshine,489,15,pm1spicy,,200.0,ltbx,I didn't expect it to handle such a taboo subject with this much care
Sunshine,489,16,pm1spicy,,200.0,ltbx,"Subtlety is completely thrown out the window at times, with some characters written like Facebook comment sections come to life"
Sunshine,489,17,pm1spicy,,200.0,ltbx,"They are loud, caricature-like, and clearly meant to provoke"
Sunshine,489,18,pm1spicy,,200.0,ltbx,But the sad truth is that people like that exist
Sunshine,489,19,pm1spicy,,200.0,ltbx,"Without getting into spoilers, the film isn’t trying to decide what’s right or wrong"

Sunshine,504,7,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine leaves a mark
Sunshine,504,8,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,"A film that paints a very real, raw, uncomfortable, and deeply moving picture on what it is like to be a Filipino woman with a dream, a mistake, and an agency that is being challenged by those around her—even by herself"
Sunshine,504,9,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,"It does this through depicting scenes all pointing towards the state of reproductive healthcare in the Philippines, and all those who are affected by it"
Sunshine,504,10,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,Its characters are what makes the film so moving
Sunshine,504,11,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,"Of course, Maris Racal does a stunning job portraying Sunshine and the character’s emotional complexity"
Sunshine,504,12,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,"Every character, though, has a purpose and reflects Filipino realities accurately"
Sunshine,504,13,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,Perhaps the most special characters are what the film uses as a device to move the story along
Sunshine,504,14,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,"At first, I felt unsure of it, but by the end of the film, it was very effective"
Sunshine,504,15,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,"This is a type of story that I feel, and hope, most Filipinos get to see"
Sunshine,504,16,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,It is highly relevant as much as it is good
Sunshine,504,17,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,"The narrative, linear structure of the film lends to the experience of the casual spectator; it builds up and comes crashing down"
Sunshine,504,18,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,The scene of Sunshine being alone in the gymnasium
Sunshine,504,19,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,is one that will stick with me for a while
Sunshine,504,20,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,I love this film
Sunshine,504,21,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,Go see it
Sunshine,504,22,cinegela,,180.0,ltbx,It is so worth the ₱270
Sunshine,505,1,jrvlouis,,200.0,ltbx,"Smart, funny, emotional, and heartbreakingly raw and real in showing the state of women's access to, or lack thereof, reproductive healthcare options in the Philippines"
Sunshine,505,2,jrvlouis,,200.0,ltbx,"MARIS RACAL, THE ACTRESS THAT YOU ARE"
Sunshine,505,3,jrvlouis,,200.0,ltbx,"Also, much flowers to the incredibly talented supporting cast"
Sunshine,506,1,fati_gued,,180.0,ltbx,i fully support this campaign to push safe abortion rights
Sunshine,507,1,rayorrei,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine is the kind of film that lingers in your chest long after the credits roll
Sunshine,507,2,rayorrei,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s raw, urgent, and quietly devastating"
Sunshine,507,3,rayorrei,,160.0,ltbx,Maris Racal gives such a gripping performance—her portrayal of a young gymnast grappling with an impossible choice feels painfully real
Sunshine,507,4,rayorrei,,160.0,ltbx,"The way the film contrasts the clean, structured world of gymnastics with the chaos of Manila's underground makes everything hit harder"
Sunshine,507,5,rayorrei,,160.0,ltbx,"There’s so much weight in the silence, the stares, the quiet desperation"
Sunshine,507,6,rayorrei,,160.0,ltbx,"It doesn’t hold your hand or tie things up neatly, but that’s what makes it so powerful"
Sunshine,507,7,rayorrei,,160.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone tells Sunshine’s story with empathy and fire, shedding light on the terrifying realities young girls face in a country that offers them no choices"
Sunshine,507,8,rayorrei,,160.0,ltbx,Unflinching and necessary
Sunshine,508,1,wexn,,200.0,ltbx,PAKYU MIGGY
Sunshine,509,1,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,"Really a sucker for films where the protagonist chose themselves, a recurring theme in Antoinette Jadaone films and Sunshine might be her best one yet"
Sunshine,509,2,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,"Being a girl is hard, but being a girl in the Philippines is something else"
Sunshine,509,3,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,"At the end of the day, it’s our decisions in life that make us"
Sunshine,509,4,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,And Sunshine gets to decide
Sunshine,509,5,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,Not some doctor she just met
Sunshine,509,6,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,Not some random pharmacist
Sunshine,509,7,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,And definitely not Miggy
Sunshine,509,8,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,"Heck, what’s Miggy gonna do, call his Papa"
Sunshine,509,9,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,"Dear reader, please go see Sunshine"
Sunshine,509,10,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,It’s an important film
Sunshine,509,12,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,It was raining all week long and it’s finally nice to see a bit of sunshine as I write this
Sunshine,509,13,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,(Cinema: Megamall; Talkback with D
Sunshine,509,14,noisees,,180.0,ltbx,Tonet and Maris)
Sunshine,510,1,goodbailey11,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang dami ko nang inebas sa Twitter pagkatapos ng Megamall showing, BASTA ang gist is iyak ako nang iyak nang iyak"
Sunshine,510,2,goodbailey11,,200.0,ltbx,"Kinailangan kong makapag-release ng emotions kaya kahit never ko pa naman ginawa, pinush ko magpa-interview to release my thoughts HAHA"
Sunshine,510,3,goodbailey11,,200.0,ltbx,Yung kapatid ko na-2nd hand embarrassment na sakin eh pero na-overwhelm kasi talaga ako after the screening
Sunshine,510,4,goodbailey11,,200.0,ltbx,Bahala na kung sobra akong kabado at nag-stutter haha mahalaga nalabas ko yung mga nasa isip ko
Sunshine,510,5,goodbailey11,,200.0,ltbx,Mahal na mahal ko sina Direk Tonet at Maris
Sunshine,510,6,goodbailey11,,200.0,ltbx,Syempre buong Sunshine team for this gem
Sunshine,511,3,redddddd,,160.0,ltbx,25braved the storm (eme) to watch this
Sunshine,511,4,redddddd,,160.0,ltbx,loved the writing and execution of sunshine's character
Sunshine,511,5,redddddd,,160.0,ltbx,"the collective catholic guilt is so insane the whole theater is going through it WITH sunshine  the ""sorry po papa god, thank you po papa god"" sequence is both funny and depressing"
Sunshine,511,6,redddddd,,160.0,ltbx,great film to open up conversations on regressive policies in the PH
Sunshine,511,7,redddddd,,160.0,ltbx,women (& unfortunately young girls) need safe and legal access to medical procedures
Sunshine,512,1,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,"For a couple of years, I've lived and roamed in the kind of Manila Tonet has painted for us: busy and dirty streets of Recto and Carriedo overflowing with people trying to make ends meet, the filthy motels of Avenida filled with horny, exploitative men who need them, and the whispering neighborhood all around the tight grid-like system such as Tondo, Blumentritt, San Lazaro, Laon-Laan or Dapitan watching, staring, looking for something to make time pass"
Sunshine,512,2,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,"Under the watchful eyes of this condemnatory city stands a rather bright-eyed Sunshine, a young female student-gymnast trying to secure her spot in athletic competitions such as the Olympics and SEA Games"
Sunshine,512,3,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,"Her hard work and dedication have reflected in her routine, and her coach is confident in her skill in making it to the national team"
Sunshine,512,4,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,"But all of her dreams of soaring global recognition have been put to risk when one day, she discovers she is with child"
Sunshine,512,5,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,What's heartbreaking about this piece is that this film is about a young woman working day and night fighting for a country who doesn't fight for her
Sunshine,512,6,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,This is a country where a woman needs to make unnecessarily drastic measures just to live a life she works hard on achieving
Sunshine,512,7,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,"This is a country built on guilt and shame, yet a country proudly branded for its resilience"
Sunshine,512,8,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,This is a country that veiled its dirt and its scum with the cloak of catholic morals and self-righteousness
Sunshine,512,9,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,This is no place for a sun to shine on
Sunshine,512,10,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,"It's easy for me to believe in this film, because it is a true story"
Sunshine,512,11,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,"This is a biography, not of Sunshine and not of Tonet"
Sunshine,512,12,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,"This is a biography of Philippines in modern day, and for decades this has been told time and time again from the works of Lino Brocka, Ishmael Bernal, and Brillante Mendoza, to works of Kip Oebanda, Ramona Diaz, and now Antoinette Jadaone"
Sunshine,512,13,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,"For years filmmakers like them have hoped for a brighter future, hoped for people to open their eyes and unveil what is hidden in plain sight, and Tonet, in this incredible feat, making the movie ticket as cheap and as accessible as it can be, is reaching out to us saying ""This is my country"
Sunshine,512,14,aldrinosawr,,180.0,ltbx,Look and see
Sunshine,513,1,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"The moment Sunshine opened, I felt like I was already there in her world"
Sunshine,513,2,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"That’s one of the things I’ve always admired about Direk Tonet Jadaone: how she builds these quiet, lived-in spaces that don’t just exist for her characters, but completely pull you in"
Sunshine,513,3,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"You don’t just watch the story unfold, you feel it with Sunshine"
Sunshine,513,4,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"What stuck with me the most is the way the film builds this deeply uncomfortable paradox: a country that loudly declares abortion is murder, yet leaves no room for safe options, quietly allowing dangerous pills to be sold under the table"
Sunshine,513,5,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"The contradiction isn’t even subtle, it’s the whole point"
Sunshine,513,6,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"Being a Filipino is already hard, but being a woman in the Philippines"
Sunshine,513,7,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,It's brutal
Sunshine,513,8,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t sugarcoat anything, it throws you straight into the brokenness of it all, from healthcare to shame culture to just… surviving"
Sunshine,513,9,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"As the story unfolds, you’re taken on this intense ride with Sunshine, a girl trying to make sense of what she’s going through while the world around her offers no real answers"
Sunshine,513,10,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,It forces you to confront your own biases
Sunshine,513,11,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,You start to ask yourself: what would I do in her place
Sunshine,513,12,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"What’s the “right” choice, really, when you’re trapped in a society that only ever gives you wrong ones"
Sunshine,513,13,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,Menggay’s story hit like a gut punch
Sunshine,513,14,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s the kind of pain that’s so real, but we never talk about because we’re scared to"
Sunshine,513,15,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"Menggay isn't just another casualty, at the end of it all -- she's still a kid"
Sunshine,513,16,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,What I love most about the storytelling is that it doesn’t preach
Sunshine,513,17,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"It makes you think, it makes you question -- but in the end, it reminds you that it should all boil down to what Sunshine feels is right"
Sunshine,513,18,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,What she knows is best
Sunshine,513,19,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"It gives her that agency, that voice, something this world so often tries to take from girls like her"
Sunshine,513,20,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"I've always been a fan of Maris Racal, and I agree that this is her best project yet"
Sunshine,513,21,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,She didn’t need to go big; her silence already said everything
Sunshine,513,22,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"And I loved how the film used gymnastics as this quiet metaphor of control, performance, and discipline all while her personal life spirals into uncertainty"
Sunshine,513,23,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,It’s so smart
Sunshine,513,24,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,And I have to say: the cinematography
Sunshine,513,26,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"Of course, the gym scenes were beautifully shot, we all expected that - but it was the motel scenes that floored me"
Sunshine,513,27,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,There was something about how those moments were framed that just hit harder
Sunshine,513,28,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"Like everything was raw, exposed, still"
Sunshine,513,29,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"And what really stayed with me, long after the credits rolled, was this one feeling: at the end of it all, our dreams, they’re always for the younger versions of ourselves"
Sunshine,513,30,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"We fight, we keep going, because we hope they’d understand"
Sunshine,513,31,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"That if we ever had to explain why we chose what we chose, they’d look at us and say, “gets kita"
Sunshine,513,32,lizzycapellan,,200.0,ltbx,"”But the question that lingers is: are we, is this world ready for a story as brave as Sunshine"
Sunshine,514,1,_bubble,,180.0,ltbx,"i love how sunshine stood her ground and said she didn’t want to be a mother, even when her boyfriend’s dad offered help and support"
Sunshine,514,2,_bubble,,180.0,ltbx,it really showed how sure she was about what she wanted for her life
Sunshine,514,3,_bubble,,180.0,ltbx,"abortion should be legalized not because people are being careless, but because women should have the right to decide for themselves"
Sunshine,514,4,_bubble,,180.0,ltbx,and let’s not ignore the elephant in the room: the philippine healthcare system is so messed up
Sunshine,514,5,_bubble,,180.0,ltbx,women like sunshine don’t get the care they need
Sunshine,514,6,_bubble,,180.0,ltbx,and for what
Sunshine,514,7,_bubble,,180.0,ltbx,so the budget can go to another pointless msproject or billboardsized face of some politician
Sunshine,514,8,_bubble,,180.0,ltbx,"like, please… put the money into actual healthcare"
Sunshine,514,9,_bubble,,180.0,ltbx,"PRIORITIZE PEOPLE, NOT CLOUTsunshine’s is reality for so many"
Sunshine,514,10,_bubble,,180.0,ltbx,and it’s about time na we listened
Sunshine,515,1,davesori,,200.0,ltbx,I think the best way to describe this film is that it’s truly a slice of life
Sunshine,515,2,davesori,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine may be a fictional character, but it’s not impossible to see someone like her in real life"
Sunshine,515,3,davesori,,200.0,ltbx,Maybe with a different name but sharing the same story or situation
Sunshine,515,4,davesori,,200.0,ltbx,"The film beautifully portrays the strength of a woman as a sister, a friend, an athlete, and most importantly, as herself"
Sunshine,515,5,davesori,,200.0,ltbx,I was also really impressed with how balanced the characters were
Sunshine,515,6,davesori,,200.0,ltbx,Even the supporting roles had their moments to shine
Sunshine,515,7,davesori,,200.0,ltbx,"And Annika, what a star"
Sunshine,515,8,davesori,,200.0,ltbx,"I didn’t expect her character to unfold the way it did, but she delivered an outstanding performance, along with another child actor you absolutely need to see"
Sunshine,516,1,shadowkat_,,200.0,ltbx,must watch
Sunshine,516,2,shadowkat_,,200.0,ltbx,ang galing at gandang-ganda ako sa pagkakasulat
Sunshine,517,1,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN DYING IN SECRET AND LIVING IN SHAME
Sunshine,517,2,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,I cried because it’s painfully relateable and also bc I know women like her
Sunshine,517,3,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,I’ve been that friend who hears the secret
Sunshine,517,4,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,The details are so specific and real
Sunshine,517,5,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,From the moment she bought the pregnancy kit with shame in her eyes and afraid of judgement — to checking that test in a cramped public restroom where two cubicles exist but only one works
Sunshine,517,6,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,The fear of opening up to even one person and hiding it from her family
Sunshine,517,7,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,"Sneaking into a motel for something you shouldn’t be ashamed of,,, all because abortion is illegal"
Sunshine,517,8,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,This is a reality for SO MANY women in the Philippines
Sunshine,517,9,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,"Women are forced in silence, danger, and in killing our dreams"
Sunshine,517,10,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,Abortion should be legal
Sunshine,517,11,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,Thank you to the whole Sunshine team
Sunshine,517,12,mdvllflrs,,200.0,ltbx,Lalo kay Maris at Sunshine sa pagdala ng kwento at pagbitbit ng bigat na totoo sa buhay ng maraming kababaihan
Sunshine,518,1,gwapings,,200.0,ltbx,that was so heavy
Sunshine,519,1,_bumbleee,,200.0,ltbx,"gets na gets, sunshine"
Sunshine,520,1,iamdamnation,,120.0,ltbx,There’s no denying Sunshine matters - it speaks to harsh truths and tackles its themes with care and emotional honesty
Sunshine,520,2,iamdamnation,,120.0,ltbx,"The film had a timely subject, sincere writing, and phenomenal acting - Maris Racal was stellar, while Jennica Garcia delivered with quiet power"
Sunshine,520,3,iamdamnation,,120.0,ltbx,"But I struggled with certain elements, particularly its attempt at magical realism"
Sunshine,520,4,iamdamnation,,120.0,ltbx,"The presence of the imaginary child felt clunky, tonally jarring, and out of sync with the otherwise grounded narrative"
Sunshine,520,5,iamdamnation,,120.0,ltbx,"Frankly, the character felt unnecessary - the film had already evolved past the need for her"
Sunshine,520,6,iamdamnation,,120.0,ltbx,"The story had power, and I wish it had trusted its own strength without the added flourish"
Sunshine,520,7,iamdamnation,,120.0,ltbx,"Ultimately, I admired its purpose more than loving its execution"
Sunshine,521,1,chantipatico,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine sheds light on a topic many still avoid, the abortion and women's choices"
Sunshine,521,2,chantipatico,,200.0,ltbx,"It's not just a Philippine issue, but a global one"
Sunshine,521,3,chantipatico,,200.0,ltbx,"Sensitive as it is, this film proves it's a conversation worth having, especially with the youth"
Sunshine,521,4,chantipatico,,200.0,ltbx,"Sex education needs attention, lalo na mula sa mga nasa pwesto"
Sunshine,521,5,chantipatico,,200.0,ltbx,The government should support this by pushing for proper education and open dialogue
Sunshine,521,6,chantipatico,,200.0,ltbx,"Kudos to the whole Sunshine team for bringing a story like this to light, something we should be openly discussing in this day and age"
Sunshine,522,1,fwilmbuff,,200.0,ltbx,i'm at a loss for words

Sunshine,529,3,nikgutz,,200.0,ltbx,Ang problemang inilatag ay sistematikong hinahadlangan ang mga karapatan ng mga kababaihan
Sunshine,529,4,nikgutz,,200.0,ltbx,Tahimik man ang mga eksena pero maririnig mo ang panghuhusga at galit
Sunshine,529,5,nikgutz,,200.0,ltbx,Matapang ang mensahe

Sunshine,529,9,nikgutz,,200.0,ltbx,"Performance of a lifetime ang binigay ni Maris, napakahusay"
Sunshine,529,10,nikgutz,,200.0,ltbx,Malinaw na ang pagiging babae sa lipunang relihiyoso at patriyarkal ay iniipit lamang ang mga walang kakampi
Sunshine,529,11,nikgutz,,200.0,ltbx,kaya maging isa ka para sa mga nangangailangan
Sunshine,529,14,nikgutz,,200.0,ltbx,Dahil hindi ito natatapos sa sinehan

Sunshine,531,9,__piooooo,,200.0,ltbx,"Ngunit sa lakas ng sarili mong boses na bumubulong, sumisigaw, humihikbi at nagmamakaawa, mahirap humingi ng tulong kung maging ikaw hindi sigurado kung anong tulong ang kailangan mo"
Sunshine,531,10,__piooooo,,200.0,ltbx,"Napakaraming salita, emosyon na hindi ko maipaliwanag ang naiparamdam sa akin ng pelikulang 'to"

Sunshine,532,4,chaicnlls,,160.0,ltbx,"made me realize, yet again, how phil needs to fcking wake up and issues like teenage pregnancy, rape, and abortion exist in our society; that we should be more open about these and help those ppl have more options and support rather than just letting them think that abortion is the only choice in order for women to get our dreams"

Sunshine,533,2,syntax404,,200.0,ltbx,"It did not just amplify a young girl's struggle with how to handle a life-changing conflict, but it also showed how the external actors play a huge role on how things must go"
Sunshine,533,3,syntax404,,200.0,ltbx,"The film aimed to magnify how conservative the culture of the Philippines is, in which in this modern age, some of it could be considered obsolete"
Sunshine,533,4,syntax404,,200.0,ltbx,"Coming from someone with a short attention span, I found myself staring at the cinema screen for the whole time, even after the film ended"

Sunshine,539,3,edricci,,160.0,ltbx,"And in the quiet exchange of glances, there was pain, there was care, and there was a silence that said everything"

Sunshine,541,2,thefilmbruuh,,200.0,ltbx,This is a well crafted story that follows a gymnast enroute of becoming an Olympian
Sunshine,541,3,thefilmbruuh,,200.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone is really clever in tackling a stigma with boldness and sensitivity at the same time
Sunshine,541,4,thefilmbruuh,,200.0,ltbx,I really appreciate that the movie also depicts the reality and scenarios of living in Manila on a daily basis

Sunshine,549,3,zawtch,,200.0,ltbx,I walked into the cinema with so much expectation—and Sunshine delivered more than my expectations
Sunshine,549,4,zawtch,,200.0,ltbx,This is a landmark film
Sunshine,549,5,zawtch,,200.0,ltbx,"A humanizing, soul-stirring, and bold piece of cinema that dares to speak truth in a country that often prefers silence and compliance"
Sunshine,549,6,zawtch,,200.0,ltbx,"In a nation as conservative and deeply religious as the Philippines, Sunshine dives headfirst into the conversations we often whisper about, especially around the elderly and religious individuals—abortion, reproductive health, sexual abuse (WITHIN the family), and the religious hypocrisy that surrounds them"
Sunshine,549,7,zawtch,,200.0,ltbx,"One of the most powerful moments for me was when she prays to God in the middle of an abortion attempt: “Lord, tanggalin Mo lang ’to, babawi ako sa lahat-lahat"
Sunshine,549,8,zawtch,,200.0,ltbx,” That line alone—honest and devastating—is a statement that cuts deep into the Filipino moral paradox
Sunshine,549,10,zawtch,,200.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal carried this film on her own, brilliantly"
Sunshine,549,11,zawtch,,200.0,ltbx,"No awkward or cringey moments—just pure, intentional acting that hits you right in the gut"
Sunshine,549,12,zawtch,,200.0,ltbx,"This is easily her most brilliant and mature performance to date, and I am hungry for more"
Sunshine,549,13,zawtch,,200.0,ltbx,"Also, just to share my theory: I don’t think the kids she sees represent a “mother figure” version of herself"
Sunshine,549,14,zawtch,,200.0,ltbx,"To me, they were the babies’ little angels, quietly watching over their mothers, protecting them, forgiving them"

Sunshine,553,1,jiannemsoriano,,160.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is a powerful and unflinching examination of the ongoing issue of teenage pregnancy in the Philippines, anchored by a stunning breakout performance from Maris Racal"
Sunshine,553,2,jiannemsoriano,,160.0,ltbx,"The film transcends a simple narrative, offering a poignant and necessary critique of a society grappling with deeply entrenched religious and political views that often leave young women isolated and without agency"
Sunshine,553,3,jiannemsoriano,,160.0,ltbx,"Through its raw and unapologetic storytelling, Sunshine doesn’t just present a problem"
Sunshine,553,4,jiannemsoriano,,160.0,ltbx,"It takes a stand and demands that we, the viewers, confront it alongside its protagonist"
Sunshine,553,5,jiannemsoriano,,160.0,ltbx,Where the film truly excels is in its unflinching depiction of the societal and systemic failures that trap young women like Sunshine
Sunshine,553,6,jiannemsoriano,,160.0,ltbx,"The Philippines has the second-highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Southeast Asia, and a 2023 survey by Save the Children Philippines revealed that more than 500 adolescents become mothers each day, some as young as ten years old"
Sunshine,553,7,jiannemsoriano,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine masterfully illustrates the intense personal isolation behind these numbers by using the accessible medium of sports

Sunshine,570,2,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"My country has it all, a strong historical background and culture, beautiful agricultural sights"
Sunshine,570,3,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,The Philippines shines in so many ways
Sunshine,570,4,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"This country is easy to love, but it’s also easy to hate"
Sunshine,570,5,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"On the other side of the spectrum, the Philippines is plagued with corruption, deeply oppressive religious standards, and many more hateful traditions and mindsets that continue to affect the Filipino people"
Sunshine,570,6,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"The bare minimum is oftentimes glorified as the best that society could do for itself in the Philippines, but is to settle for less to settle for enough"
Sunshine,570,7,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,This is the question that Sunshine raises
Sunshine,570,8,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"In a country that struggles to stand for its women, Sunshine did what many movies could not, it fearlessly depicted what was real and happening in our country"
Sunshine,570,9,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"It showed the pure, unfiltered realities of a young, adolescent woman facing an unwanted pregnancy"
Sunshine,570,10,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,The film doesn’t hold back
Sunshine,570,11,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"From the infamous ‘motel scene’ to the different women we follow in the film, direk Antoinette Jadaone fearlessly portrays the dangers a woman has to go through just to gain autonomy over their body, hopes, and dreams"
Sunshine,570,12,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"Upon a second watch (this time with my mom and my cousin), I noticed something about the way Sunshine (Maris Racal) progresses in the film"
Sunshine,570,13,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,She starts off as quiet
Sunshine,570,14,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"When she finds out she is pregnant, she only tells her boyfriend and her best friend"
Sunshine,570,15,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"When she’s worried or angry, she conceals her emotions"
Sunshine,570,16,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,She is held back
Sunshine,570,17,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,She is chained
Sunshine,570,18,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"As the film progresses, she slowly finds her footing, first through the infamous ‘basag windshield’ scene, and then through the numerous situations she finds herself stuck in"
Sunshine,570,19,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,There is a scene near the end of the film
Sunshine,570,20,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is practicing her routine
Sunshine,570,21,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"She is emotional, and she’s made up her mind"
Sunshine,570,22,zaccheus,,200.0,ltbx,"As she ends her routine, the ribbon falls around her body, chaining her"

Sunshine,621,2,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,"So much of Philippine cinema, especially that which makes the rounds in local and international film festivals, is stuck churning out “groundbreaking” firsts"
Sunshine,621,3,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,"Because our cultural discourse is so behind, our filmmakers are tasked not only with telling stories, but also with inventing the stories to be told"
Sunshine,621,4,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,"They’re required to stake out new thematic ground, not in service of aesthetic evolution, but simply to keep up with the global conversation"
Sunshine,621,5,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,The cost of this is a cinema that often feels overburdened with didactic intent and undernourished in emotional and formal rigor
Sunshine,621,6,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,"In a particularly polarizing gesture, Jadaone introduces a hallucinated child character, a device that indirectly echoes Jojo Rabbit (2019)"
Sunshine,621,7,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,But this choice results in jarring tonal shifts that muddle the film’s emotional center
Sunshine,621,8,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,"What was perhaps intended as farce to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour"
Sunshine,621,9,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility
Sunshine,621,10,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,"In fact, by personifying an unborn child as a character which speaks and thinks, then Sunshine unintentionally reinforces the very moral framing that anti-abortion rhetoric thrives on"
Sunshine,621,11,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,It circles back into the age-old “when does life begin
Sunshine,621,12,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,"” debate—a question that continues to paralyze policymaking in the country, even when the conversation should be about autonomy, access, and proper healthcare"
Sunshine,621,13,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, literalizes it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics"
Sunshine,621,14,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,"What’s more revealing than the film itself is the discourse surrounding it: a ubiquity of gender-essentialist and bioessentialist defenses, as if any critique of any form is automatically a threat to representation"
Sunshine,621,15,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,That instinct: to guard a film’s cause rather than evaluate its craft just proves how far behind we are as a nation in talking about gender politics in filmmaking
Sunshine,621,16,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,"The refusal to embrace genuinely revolutionary tactics, whether in politics or art, has kept us coasting on the optics of progress ever since"
Sunshine,621,17,macjohnearl,,100.0,ltbx,Full review for the Kinoise Substack published here

Sunshine,624,4,shegottheruby,,200.0,ltbx,"this movie really serves it to you firsthand and need sya mapanuod ng maraming tao kasi these issues are being set aside and belittled, and ang sakit isipin nung realidad na almost walang tulong kang marereceive sa ganitong sitwasyon tapos ung judgement pa ng society sayo nakakapagdagdag dun sa bigat na dinadala mo na"
Sunshine,624,5,shegottheruby,,200.0,ltbx,"and it only gets worse the younger the person is, especially hindi naman nila choice and/or planned"

Sunshine,630,1,manqueen,,,ltbx,TANGINA ANG GANDAAA
Sunshine,631,1,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine is the product of the environment that failed her
Sunshine,631,2,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,It's an excellent movie that's blatantly shows how women are being boxed with limited rights and decisions in their lives with her being a young gymnast who is forced to weigh her personal dreams against societal expectations
Sunshine,631,3,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,What makes the film compelling is how honest and raw it is which made it difficult and easy to digest at the same time
Sunshine,631,4,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,"It's difficult to digest since the film doesn't sugarcoat nor romanticize, it confronts"
Sunshine,631,5,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,It slaps us with the reality that our system is really crooked when it comes to having the options such as abortion which draws you into Sunshine’s emotional turmoil
Sunshine,631,6,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,It's also easy to sort out as well as the film itself utilized a lot of symbolism and metaphor that's very comprehensible to the young audience since it was depicted in way of being simple and straightforward
Sunshine,631,7,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,This is the kind of film that should have been made long ago
Sunshine,631,8,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,"Its themes were not only relevant, but urgent not only within the country but the world"
Sunshine,631,9,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine deserves to be shown in schools, especially for young women who are still learning to navigate their autonomy and choices in a culture that often denies them both"
Sunshine,631,10,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,"All I can say is that Sunshine is not just a film, it's a conversation starter, a one we desperately need"
Sunshine,631,13,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,That LRT scene at the motel as well as that quiapo side profile scene
Sunshine,631,14,vincentio,,180.0,ltbx,Kudos Sir Pao

Sunshine,637,1,oshumoi,,200.0,ltbx,Might be Maris’ best acting role yet
Sunshine,638,1,cinesighs,,180.0,ltbx,feeling overwhelmed so let me write a short cluster of thoughts
Sunshine,638,2,cinesighs,,180.0,ltbx,it's about time for a film like this and I couldn't be happier to witness it
Sunshine,638,3,cinesighs,,180.0,ltbx,I don't think I have words in either english or tagalog that can express how much this moved me
Sunshine,638,4,cinesighs,,180.0,ltbx,but this movie is so important
Sunshine,638,5,cinesighs,,180.0,ltbx,and it can mean so much to women who navigate this kind of society
Sunshine,638,6,cinesighs,,180.0,ltbx,"whether you're going through or went through the same challenges sunshine did, it wasn't hard at all to relate to her and I can only hope that everyone who sees this film, specially now that it's released to the general filipino audience, will emphatize with her"
Sunshine,638,7,cinesighs,,180.0,ltbx,there were elements of the story that I wish had been woven in better but I couldn't hate them for it
Sunshine,638,8,cinesighs,,180.0,ltbx,I also have to praise the cinematography
Sunshine,638,9,cinesighs,,180.0,ltbx,people were saying how the it gives off lino brocka's maynila and insiang and wow were they right
Sunshine,638,10,cinesighs,,180.0,ltbx,more filipino cinematographers should fall for this propaganda
Sunshine,638,11,cinesighs,,180.0,ltbx,"basta grabe kayo maris at direk tonet (wow tropa), husay niyo po opo pinaiyak niyo ko"

Sunshine,641,1,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone's latest cinematic offering, Sunshine, is not merely a film; it's a mirror held up to society, reflecting uncomfortable truths that many would rather ignore"
Sunshine,641,2,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,"While the narrative might feel familiar to some, its power lies in its unflinching, raw depiction of a story deeply grounded in the realities of the Philippines"
Sunshine,641,3,a_sreview,,200.0,ltbx,"Jadaone takes a universally understood plight and fills it with a distinctly Filipino soul, making it resonate with profound authenticity"

Sunshine,644,4,langkwenta,,200.0,ltbx,"After watching, my mom simply said, “That was meaningful"

Sunshine,646,1,nekonyan,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine isn't afraid to show what it truly means to be a woman in the modern world
Sunshine,646,2,nekonyan,,200.0,ltbx,"In a society where your choices are often shamed, imposed, or forced into the very core of your identity, Sunshine remains steadfast in her decisions"
Sunshine,646,3,nekonyan,,200.0,ltbx,"We are too unforgiving towards women—too critical, too much of everything"
Sunshine,646,4,nekonyan,,200.0,ltbx,"And for a 19-year-old girl simply wanted to chase her dream, who are we to shame her for the choices she takes pride in"
Sunshine,646,5,nekonyan,,200.0,ltbx,"The film is heavy, filled with thrilling sequences and beautiful picturesque cinema that adds an insightful edge to its narrative"
Sunshine,646,6,nekonyan,,200.0,ltbx,"It doesn't shy away from the realities of living in Manila, where everything is muddy, dreary, and dried in irony"
Sunshine,646,7,nekonyan,,200.0,ltbx,It reminded me at different tangents of Black Swan and Manila in the Claws of Light—a woman haunted by the consequences of her actions while navigating Manila's streets with weary kindness and understanding
Sunshine,646,8,nekonyan,,200.0,ltbx,"All I can say is, ""Gets ko na"
Sunshine,646,9,nekonyan,,200.0,ltbx,""" Sobrang gets ko"
Sunshine,646,10,nekonyan,,200.0,ltbx,Each of our choices is valid and every human experience is nuanced

Sunshine,647,1,ryanpaolooo,,140.0,ltbx,Ang tunay na pelikula ay matapang
Sunshine,648,1,ziaracarmelli,,200.0,ltbx,"In a country where a uterus can feel like a prison, Sunshine breaks through the silence with a scream"
Sunshine,648,2,ziaracarmelli,,200.0,ltbx,This is not just a film—it’s a rebellion against a system that punishes Filipinas for daring to survive
Sunshine,648,3,ziaracarmelli,,200.0,ltbx,What a fearless and necessary filmz Sunshine dares to confront a brutal reality in a country where abortion remains illegal and where women’s rights are often reduced to whispers—silenced by false morality and systemic neglect
Sunshine,648,4,ziaracarmelli,,200.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone’s storytelling isn’t just intimate; it is a searing indictment of how the state and even the healthcare system fail Filipinas
Sunshine,648,5,ziaracarmelli,,200.0,ltbx,"This film reminds us that every choice a woman makes is shaped by power structures that shame her, control her body, and turn compassion into judgment"
Sunshine,648,6,ziaracarmelli,,200.0,ltbx,"Through Sunshine’s journey, we see how being a woman in the Philippines means living in a constant struggle for autonomy—ang hirap maging babae, pero mas triple ang hirap ng mga babae dito sa Pilipinas"
Sunshine,648,7,ziaracarmelli,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is not just a movie; it is a mirror held up to a society that polices women’s bodies while abandoning them in their most vulnerable moments
Sunshine,648,8,ziaracarmelli,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s a rallying cry for the Sunshines, Theas, Helenas, Geleens, and Edens of this country—voices we must hear, stories we must protect"
Sunshine,648,9,ziaracarmelli,,200.0,ltbx,"May this film be the turning point for our generation: progressive, pro-women, and unapologetically pro-choice"
Sunshine,648,10,ziaracarmelli,,200.0,ltbx,Thank you to the entire Sunshine team and SM Cinemas for making this powerful narrative accessible by lowering ticket prices

Sunshine,652,3,libanlaraalyssa,,180.0,ltbx,Ang ganda talaga
Sunshine,652,4,libanlaraalyssa,,180.0,ltbx,100% would recommend to my intl friends as one of those movies that really encapsulate the reality of life and the healthcare system in Manila
Sunshine,652,5,libanlaraalyssa,,180.0,ltbx,Hay Antoinette Jadaone magsulat ka nalang talaga forever
Sunshine,653,1,johnwatchthings,,200.0,ltbx,The anti-abortion people will always counter the pro-abortion with “Think about the child
Sunshine,653,2,johnwatchthings,,200.0,ltbx,” without even thinking that the hypothetical child they protect would obviously side with their mother
Sunshine,653,3,johnwatchthings,,200.0,ltbx,"That’s probably my favorite part of the film, when the apparition-ed child, slowly revealed to be the baby in Sunshine’s womb, yet to be born, but who already became her conscience and shadow, finally understood why Sunshine had to make the decision"
Sunshine,653,4,johnwatchthings,,200.0,ltbx,This is Antoinette Jadaone making a courageous case as to…
Sunshine,654,1,lawrdbien,,160.0,ltbx,Definitely Maris Racal’s breakout performance
Sunshine,655,1,claresse_,,200.0,ltbx,no notes it’s been an hour and i’m still speechless
Sunshine,656,1,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is astonishing as she gives a star-making performance in Antoinette Jadaone's finest film yet
Sunshine,656,2,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine takes us by the hand in a bustling Quiapo that's full of hypocrisy, contradiction, and a brutal system on women and their bodies"
Sunshine,656,3,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,It's a random odyssey of a woman trying to take back what is her's in an unforgiving conservative society
Sunshine,656,4,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,"In the film's opening moments, we see an ambitious athlete confused and paralyzed with the news of her untimely pregnancy"
Sunshine,656,5,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,She's scared and she's prolonging the agony of confronting the inevitable
Sunshine,656,6,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,"One thing that some people may ask is, why doesn't she immediately ask anyone for help"
Sunshine,656,7,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,Doesn't she have a family
Sunshine,656,8,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,Why is she trying to deal with such a serious problem on her own
Sunshine,656,9,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,Is this the society that we've grown into
Sunshine,656,10,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,Where a young woman is so afraid and paralyzed to get any help that she risks her life trying to deal with it on her own
Sunshine,656,11,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,The answer is a resounding YES
Sunshine,656,12,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,We are living in a country where dominant beliefs and religion are shoved down in women's throats even if it means giving up their dreams
Sunshine,656,13,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,Where young women are scorned and defined by their mistakes instead of being educated and getting a strong support system
Sunshine,656,14,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,"Most egregiously, we live in a society that stigmatizes and punishes women but tolerates the very system, and actions that led to their unwanted pregnancies"
Sunshine,656,15,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,That is the society that Jadaone perfectly paints in this harrowing film
Sunshine,656,16,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,Jadaone uses Quiapo as the backdrop to tell this story as she blends elements of neorealism and magic realism
Sunshine,656,17,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,This film has a great sense of place as Sunshine roams around a Quiapo that hides hypocrisy underneath its Catholic cathedral
Sunshine,656,18,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,Jadaone goes full Brocka mode through these scenes as she showcases different communities and people through a neorealist lens
Sunshine,656,19,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,That's why I found the film's surrealist tendencies to be a little bit jarring
Sunshine,656,20,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine encounters a kid that appears only through her consciousness and it really makes you wonder if this type of storytelling fits the themes that Jadaone is exploring
Sunshine,656,21,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,It just runs the risk of making it too melodramatic and undercutting its authenticity
Sunshine,656,22,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,But what keeps it from going off the rails is her unwavering compassion and understanding of Sunshine's plight
Sunshine,656,23,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,Direk Tonet did mention in the Q&A session after that she swore that she was gonna hold Sunshine's hands and be by her side through every turbulence she'll face while writing this movie
Sunshine,656,24,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,"In the film's third act, the neorealist and magic realist narratives just blend into a powerful, poignant, and profound moment while Sunshine practices her routine one last time"
Sunshine,656,25,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,I think this is a film that our country desperately needs right now
Sunshine,656,26,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,"It's bound to spark debates and fruitful discussions about abortion, reproductive health, and women's right"
Sunshine,656,27,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,"Some may disagree with what Sunshine ended up doing, but at least this is a film that ignites a discussion for these taboo topics"
Sunshine,656,28,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,I will never know how it feels to be a woman in an unfairly conservative country
Sunshine,656,29,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,"But this film rings with so much vitality, bravery, and honesty that I just cried by the end of it"
Sunshine,656,30,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,This is so damn close to being a masterpiece
Sunshine,656,31,cjshua,,180.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,657,1,eliasliwanag,,180.0,ltbx,"cried many times, not my lived experience but goes straight to my heart"

Sunshine,661,1,jowwwwb,,200.0,ltbx,YES TO ABORTION
Sunshine,662,1,lengsungit,,200.0,ltbx,sobbed through 3/4 of this film
Sunshine,663,1,zvillacanas,,,ltbx,"not rating this kasi sabi nga ni rachel green, ""no uterus, no opinion"""
Sunshine,664,1,caffhenated,,140.0,ltbx,sunshine title pero 'yung scenes puro gloomy
Sunshine,665,1,alonzojuwan,,,ltbx,"Maybe most ingenious about Sunshine is its willingness to accept the decision to abort likely also involves a negotiation with the unborn child, maybe even a plea for forgiveness—less from God, because getting that would be easy, and in fact Sunshine gets it out of the way early on, but more from who the child would have been"
Sunshine,665,2,alonzojuwan,,,ltbx,"For the film indeed that is the longer battle, and it affords Sunshine a long array of events that could make the explaining easier"
Sunshine,665,3,alonzojuwan,,,ltbx,"She sees her dilemma reflected in the city's decay, her choice—which she readily makes—put into perspective, rounded out, by another girl's inaccess to that choice"
Sunshine,665,4,alonzojuwan,,,ltbx,"Very carefully, and backed by research, Jadaone dissects what that choice may mean for women like Sunshine in a developing city like Manila, where dreams are scarce and their fulfillment even rarer"
Sunshine,665,5,alonzojuwan,,,ltbx,"Sunshine's choice is an act of self-determination, in a world where that's seen as vulgar, irreverent: that is clear"
Sunshine,665,6,alonzojuwan,,,ltbx,"But to what should reverence be owed, in any case"
Sunshine,665,7,alonzojuwan,,,ltbx,Sunshine argues it's simply a matter of priority
Sunshine,665,8,alonzojuwan,,,ltbx,"When Sunshine chooses her dream—which she's been carrying in her womb longer than she's known her unborn child's ghost—we empathize with her, as does the ghost"
Sunshine,665,9,alonzojuwan,,,ltbx,That shows the film’s executed its heavy work

Sunshine,682,1,aragakky,,,ltbx,a lot of things were going on in my mind after watching this
Sunshine,682,2,aragakky,,,ltbx,"mimicking what my friends say about this, it is indeed an important movie which hopefully, can open the doors for discussing the decriminalization of abortion and better, making the state strive toward a world that would not need it in the first place"
Sunshine,682,3,aragakky,,,ltbx,"quoting from one of my eye-opening reads this year, which greatly sums up my thoughts about abortion:“…focusing solely on the ‘right’ to have an abortion obscured the many other determining factors around childbirth, child-rearing and family"
Sunshine,682,4,aragakky,,,ltbx,It absolved the state of its responsibilities to create the support mechanisms for raising families
Sunshine,682,5,aragakky,,,ltbx,"If the decision to have a child is simply a woman’s choice, the responsibility for the well-being of children is shifted onto mothers instead of the society in which children are raised"
Sunshine,682,6,aragakky,,,ltbx,"”feminism, interrupted: disrupting power by lola olufemiinterestingly, what struck me the most was the portrayal of manila and the people living in it"
Sunshine,682,7,aragakky,,,ltbx,"kaya kahit alam kong marumi, masikip, at mausok ang maynila, it feels alive and weirdly enough, i get comfort from it as it highlights how much of it stems from our collectivist culture"
Sunshine,682,8,aragakky,,,ltbx,"random pero napansin ko rin na whenever kids swear in this movie, medyo pilit at nagiging borderline darryl-yap-style of filmmaking for me lmao  anyways dami kong ebas (na puro disconnected ideas) pero i feel like the movie needs a little more push and it would be harsh to confine it into a rating kasi importanteng movie siya so di ko na lang talaga lagyan hahahaha but overall it’s a nice watch"

Sunshine,685,1,ahbr,,,ltbx,"If there’s anything that is uniquely Filipino in terms of interior design, it’s the green walls"
Sunshine,685,2,ahbr,,,ltbx,"It generally evokes feelings of tranquility and harmony, but Jadaone’s latest film flips it around to signify chaos and dysfunction"
Sunshine,685,3,ahbr,,,ltbx,"The color is almost everywhere, it’s inescapable: the walls of the protagonist’s home, the sterile and hostile clinic spaces, even the motel where the film’s lead almost died, comparable to the grip Catholicism has on the Philippines"
Sunshine,685,4,ahbr,,,ltbx,"While they say there’s a separation between the church and the state, it’s barely upheld in practice, as they hinder human rights that could save thousands of lives"
Sunshine,685,5,ahbr,,,ltbx,"And yes, I am talking about abortion laws, or the lack thereof here in my country"
Sunshine,685,6,ahbr,,,ltbx,"Jadaone’s Sunshine addresses the huge elephant in the senate, as it depicts the life of its titular lead (Maris Racal), whose life is turned upside down due to a sudden news of her own pregnancy"
Sunshine,685,7,ahbr,,,ltbx,It’s easy to blame women like Sunshine for getting pregnant
Sunshine,685,8,ahbr,,,ltbx,"After all, she’s presented as a domineering figure in her sport, even bound to compete in the Olympics, and she technically practiced unsafe sex, but not every case of unwanted pregnancy is like that"
Sunshine,685,9,ahbr,,,ltbx,"There are multiple shots where Sunshine is physically separated by a fence-like barrier: be it the metal gates in the church, the ever-stretching horizontal jeepney rails, or the cold and black window frames, that subtly signal how Filipinas are imprisoned by their surroundings"
Sunshine,685,10,ahbr,,,ltbx,"Almost every gratingly infuriating, thought-provoking, and ludicrous dialogue circles back to one simple question: why is it that women are the ones penalized and restricted on matters that could jeopardize their own health and safety, especially in pregnancies caused by rape and incest"
Sunshine,685,11,ahbr,,,ltbx,"While watching, I was constantly reminded of a film with similar thematic points, that of Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, and how women need to be discreet, travel thousands of miles, and suffer in silence over matters that should be openly discussed and not considered taboo or immoral"
Sunshine,685,12,ahbr,,,ltbx,"If anything, I think this film is being highly censored in the Philippines, as the movie review board slapped an R-16 rating on a film that should be watched by teenagers"
Sunshine,685,13,ahbr,,,ltbx,How can we avoid teenage pregnancies when our government avoids talking about practicing safe sex to the right demographic
Sunshine,685,14,ahbr,,,ltbx,"Not everyone gets a happy conclusion like Sunshine did, so I hope that this film sparks a necessary conversation about women’s rights outside of the walls of movie theaters"
Sunshine,685,15,ahbr,,,ltbx,"Jadaone’s Sunshine is truly one of the Philippines’ best releases of the year so far, in both its themes and execution, and a must-watch for all types, especially men and the religious-alike"
Sunshine,685,16,ahbr,,,ltbx,"Written immediately after screening, Journal app, revised, and posted, July 25th"

Sunshine,695,2,genevacalijan,,200.0,ltbx,"it talks about women’s bodily autonomy and choice, and maka question ka how system so broke and dysfunctional because grabe ka oppressive and controling sa society, throughout the film it will ignite a meaningful and healthy discourse, especially sa mga feminist"
Sunshine,695,3,genevacalijan,,200.0,ltbx,"the film opens for interpretation, sunshine could possibly did not make it to the olympics due to the lack of access and proper reproductive healthcare diri sa pinas"
Sunshine,695,4,genevacalijan,,200.0,ltbx,"as the story unfolds, you can attest that taking unsafe abortion pills may have led to a tragic complication, putting her life at risk, for a fact that she did not received medical guidance or safety assessment during her most vulnerable moments—much like what happened to menggay"
Sunshine,695,5,genevacalijan,,200.0,ltbx,"and its a call for action actually, just in time, to encourage everyone to watch this especially to cultural conservatives and traditionalist, they need to watch and consume this type of media to try to understand and empathesize more kung gaano ka importante sa mga babae ang magkaroon ng choice"

Sunshine,712,17,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,The kind that comes from your best friend texting they love you right when you don’t know if you’re making the right choice
Sunshine,712,18,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,"Or the kind that comes from the gentle caress of a young girl bleeding out, telling you she does not want to die in the back of a police car"
Sunshine,712,19,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,"How you can sense that the fear in her voice is also the one that crept up on you days before, as the motel lady put you in tricycle telling the driver to hurry to the hospital"
Sunshine,712,20,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,I’ve always found the word “ate” to be a strong signifier of the tight the bonds between Filipina women

Sunshine,712,24,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,Nor does it exclusively show you the girlhood that was stolen from you by the capitalistic and patriarchal structures so deeply embedded in society
Sunshine,712,25,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,"Yes, it shows you that"
Sunshine,712,26,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,It does not hold back from showing you how tiresome it is to clean the poo of a newborn or how much more easy it is to find empathy in illegal markets than it is in public institutions
Sunshine,712,27,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,"Yet, what it also shows you is that whenever you feel like a lone speck of light in the dark, just call an ate"

Sunshine,712,31,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,The film itself does its job of telling an important story beautifully
Sunshine,712,32,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,"One of the key narrative devices may be a bit too on the nose for some viewers, but I find that it adds a sort of tangibility and gravity to the story that otherwise would have been missing some heart and soul without it"
Sunshine,712,33,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,Tonet’s directing is sharp and focused on such visceral and visual contradictions
Sunshine,712,34,kalachugi,,200.0,ltbx,Racal is bursting with passion and rage…vulnerable…and stellar

Sunshine,713,3,paulpitate,,,ltbx,"at first, i was reconciling it as the ""conscience"" speaking to her— the one that was built from all the forces surrounding her"
Sunshine,713,4,paulpitate,,,ltbx,"but when it went from one child to another, that's when we connect the dots"

Sunshine,717,11,bluerdanblu,,200.0,ltbx,Both movies made me cry
Sunshine,717,12,bluerdanblu,,200.0,ltbx,There's something so raw and real in how Direk Jadaone captures the essence of these places and the human emotions within them
Sunshine,717,13,bluerdanblu,,200.0,ltbx,It's more than just a story; it's an experience
Sunshine,717,14,bluerdanblu,,200.0,ltbx,"I watched Sunshine on the same day as Fantastic Four, and while I enjoyed both, there's no question for me: this movie, Sunshine, should be watched in cinemas, as a community"
Sunshine,717,15,bluerdanblu,,200.0,ltbx,"It's a communal experience, something that sparks conversations and shared emotions"
Sunshine,717,16,bluerdanblu,,200.0,ltbx,"'Yung Fantastic Four, pwede na 'yan sa Disney Plus kung tight ang budget"
Sunshine,717,17,bluerdanblu,,200.0,ltbx,But Sunshine
Sunshine,717,18,bluerdanblu,,200.0,ltbx,"It deserves the big screen, the collective gasps, and the shared tears"

Sunshine,719,1,absolutsheanema,,180.0,ltbx,from singing sunshine ng davao to aborting sunshine ng maynilaILY MARIS AND DIREK TONET
Sunshine,720,2,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,Nanay ba kita
Sunshine,720,3,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"Gut-wrenching and brave, Sunshine speaks truth with honesty and feminine rage in a heartbreaking story of womanhood, a character study that puts a young woman, an aspiring Olympian in the most harrowing ordeal — pursue her dreams or let go of it, continue her pregnancy or terminate it"
Sunshine,720,4,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"In a country where traditions and conservatism plague our sociopolitical landscape, and at a time where the world at large is being corrupted by right-wing fundamentalists, Sunshine stands with a strong pro-choice message; that women should have the rights to bodily autonomy despite the patriarchal structures that harp on religious preachings in which our women have to pay social costs or worse, their own lives and safety"
Sunshine,720,5,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"At the center of it is Sunshine, played by the brilliant Maris Racal whose tenacious yet delicate character work put so much layers to a heartfelt protagonist"
Sunshine,720,6,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"In the first 10 minutes alone, Racal delivered a string of unbridled emotions, from being flushed with regret, anger and desperation, she grew with intensity, defiance and vulnerability"
Sunshine,720,7,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,Her resolve is one of strength and a moving emotional core that’s unshakeable while being present in every turn in Sunshine’s dilemma in which we met the most colorful and textured cast of unusual characters
Sunshine,720,8,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"Even with Racal’s stellar lead performance, every supporting actor also put on a remarkable stamp that not only served their scenes but also the entire story"
Sunshine,720,9,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"From Jennica Garcia to Annika Co to Elijah Canlas to Meryl Soriano to Xyriel Manabat to Angeli Bayani to Rhed Bustamante to Piolo Pascual, it’s perfectly casted and Jadaone made sure that they deliver a well-calibrated turn for Sunshine’s story"
Sunshine,720,10,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"A chilling and entrancing dissection of womanhood, the film shifts gears as a sports movie to a melodrama injected with some satire, absurdity, and a mystical element, it’s full of inspired creative choices that are in full concerto"
Sunshine,720,11,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"With its spectacular cinematography and production design from drab and somber interiors with a hint of natural light or sometimes depressing fluorescent light, to neon-tinged urban areas where chaos lingers just around the corner while also capturing Sunshine’s extraordinary close-ups behind window railings that cage her or framed by her vibrant pink ribbon; its outstanding sound design that puts Sunshine’s inner turmoil at the center of a noisy Manila and blends a surrealist element to its heart; and a formidable original music that juxtaposes Sunshine’s personality from her life as an gymnast to her personal life"
Sunshine,720,12,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is an urgent film that needs to be seen and heard, there’s power in its universality and Tonet Jadaone’s feminist voice soars with an elevated storytelling"
Sunshine,720,13,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"Beaming with Filipino sensibilities and humour, its melodrama is used with beautiful intent while being grounded and playing with raw emotional reactions from the cast, and levity and grit in its screenplay"
Sunshine,720,14,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"And as cliche as it sounds, it’s a totally different Jadaone that made this movie"
Sunshine,720,15,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,There’s maturity that put her titular character at the center of a well-crafted film but there’s this restraint we haven’t seen before that refined the story’s message without ever being didactic
Sunshine,720,16,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"Undoubtedly, her best film yet, an opus that cements her place as an important voice in Philippine cinema but also a landmark film that tackles subject matters that only a handful of Filipino filmmakers have touched on"
Sunshine,720,17,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"An absolute achievement in today’s climate of Filipino cinema, there’s power in its tone and its themes — a protest that exposes controlling hypocritical men and medical professionals, and an interrogation of a systemic inequality full of government’s shortcomings in giving proper care and support for unwanted pregnancies, in a place where poverty and overpopulation have been a decade-long problem"
Sunshine,720,18,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"But also in Sunshine, we found hope and her light in confronting her reality while finding women who helped and listened to her, a kind of feminism that celebrates sisterhood even in the most horrifying circumstance in a woman’s life"
Sunshine,720,19,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"With high hopes, this should spark a conversation about women’s struggles and rights"
Sunshine,720,20,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"In light of the overturning of Roe v Wade in the US, akin to Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Sunshine’s story is real and rampant in the PH, and as disturbing as it sounds, unsafe abortion have been killing 1 in 3 Filipinas each day"
Sunshine,720,21,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,—————This reminded me of a podcast conversation I once listened to about a woman talking to her mother at a time she’s getting to know her more as an adult
Sunshine,720,22,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,She’s learning about her mom’s history and asked her if her mother ever wondered about living that life instead of having her
Sunshine,720,23,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,Of course the mother responded that she’s happy that she’s born and she’s her child
Sunshine,720,24,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,"To which she replied with, “if I didn’t happen, YOU would have been born"
Sunshine,720,25,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,”I think motherhood is beautiful but do you ever wonder what kind of woman your mother would have been if society gave them the rights to choose or their religion didn’t make them to aspire to fit into a mold of a woman
Sunshine,720,26,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,Maybe she could have been a president or she could have invented the cure to HIV/AIDS
Sunshine,720,27,hellopaolo,,180.0,ltbx,Who knows
Sunshine,721,1,mjvequi,,160.0,ltbx,that inn room scene
Sunshine,722,1,mikevandych,,,ltbx,"Too often, films about abortion fall into the trap of emotional manipulation, when they push a specific agenda, reducing a complex issue to a simplistic, black-and-white narrative"
Sunshine,722,2,mikevandych,,,ltbx,But Sunshine rises above that pattern
Sunshine,722,3,mikevandych,,,ltbx,"Instead, the film offers a nuanced portrayal of the struggles (and even rage) experienced by women who are denied access to reproductive healthcare - told with such compassion and delicacy that you cannot help but empathize with and root for Sunshine because the conservative society has failed her"
Sunshine,722,4,mikevandych,,,ltbx,I hope many people get to watch the film because it is both a deeply personal and universal story that casts a light on one of the most pressing crises in the country: teenage pregnancy
Sunshine,722,5,mikevandych,,,ltbx,And I also hope Sunshine ushers in a healthy and open conversation because women deserve the right to make decisions for themselves
Sunshine,722,6,mikevandych,,,ltbx,This is the kind of film I’ll be thinking for days kasi ang bigat pero napaka-cathartic panoorin
Sunshine,722,7,mikevandych,,,ltbx,"And it features a talented (and reliable) ensemble of actors - napakahuhusay ng lahat, lalo na ng mga kababaihan"
Sunshine,723,1,anondrogynous,,180.0,ltbx,"I knew this would be important, but I did not think writer/director Antoinette Jadaone would go this hard"
Sunshine,723,2,anondrogynous,,180.0,ltbx,"I truly, truly appreciate the commitment"
Sunshine,723,3,anondrogynous,,180.0,ltbx,This is a perspective that has long since needed to be shared
Sunshine,723,4,anondrogynous,,180.0,ltbx,These are the stories that need to be told
Sunshine,723,5,anondrogynous,,180.0,ltbx,"It sent out a message, not by preaching, but by showing different realities faced by many, and trusted the audience to come to their own conclusions"
Sunshine,723,6,anondrogynous,,180.0,ltbx,"If the reactions in the cinema were any indication, this has already started a conversation"
Sunshine,723,7,anondrogynous,,180.0,ltbx,I'm seeing posts on Reddit from people who have been through some of the same or similar situations
Sunshine,723,8,anondrogynous,,180.0,ltbx,I hope it keeps people talking until the things that need changing finally change for the better
Sunshine,723,9,anondrogynous,,180.0,ltbx,Beautiful work

Sunshine,724,1,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,Direk Tonet Jadaone holds a mirror up in the middle of Quiapo and asks the question: what is the proper protocol to take control of your life

Sunshine,724,3,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,Does the boyfriend have to take it too
Sunshine,724,4,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine, as a film and as a character, is bold and unwavering"
Sunshine,724,5,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,She doesn't preach or ask for pity
Sunshine,724,6,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,She doesn't beg for the forgiveness of her boyfriend or the religious
Sunshine,724,7,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,"The story is clear all through out -- Sunshine has made her decision, and while she seeks understanding, she seeks it only from those who matter, not from the audience and definitely not from the holier-than-thou"
Sunshine,724,8,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,"While Sunshine embarks on her journey to find answers, we never forget what she is -- a young girl in the Philippines, left to deal with the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy alone"
Sunshine,724,9,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,"It is so easy to put the blame on women or on impulsive, lustful teenagers, but the film reminds us that in a country where religious biases trump teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality rates, pointing fingers helps no one"
Sunshine,724,10,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,"The film reminds us that for women and other marginalized sectors, the first line of defense against systemic neglect is community"
Sunshine,724,11,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,"Brave and unfiltered, I can easily see Sunshine becoming a Filipino classic"
Sunshine,724,12,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,"What a beautifully written, directed, and acted film"
Sunshine,724,13,atomicdeadspace,,180.0,ltbx,"This is Direk Tonet's best so far, and definitely a career-defining performance for Maris Racal"

Sunshine,739,4,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,Gutom na kami
Sunshine,739,5,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s hunger borne out of poverty that limits, if not entirely removes, the access of ordinary Filipinos to watch important films such as Sunshine"
Sunshine,739,6,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,"Like any other works of art attempting to feature parts and parcels of Philippine society, etched on its tapestry is the signature Manila mayhem: masikip, mabaho, maingay and magulo"
Sunshine,739,7,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,But the structure of the film is far from chaotic despite the complicated and challenging subject Direk Antoinette Jadaone took upon herself to flesh out
Sunshine,739,8,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,The stakes were high and indeed pushed the protagonist to do what she thought needs to be done
Sunshine,739,9,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,Her point was clear and warranted no further elaboration
Sunshine,739,10,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal was stellar in her portrayal of an aspiring Olympian who got pregnant at the blossoming of her career as a young athlete
Sunshine,739,11,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,The same can be said about the equally astounding young actress Annika Co who was a perfect foil to Racal’s character
Sunshine,739,12,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,"The film, with its shorter than usual run time of barely an hour and a half minutes, didn’t hold back in driving its message, leaving nothing open for interpretation"
Sunshine,739,13,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,"Towards the end where Sunshine was performing her routine, I thought for a moment that her beaming towards the camera with her majestic ribbon would be the final shot of the film"
Sunshine,739,14,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,"But when the young Annika was shown watching Sunshine finish gracefully finishing her performance and embracing her when it ended, that was when I realized, gets ko na, that in this narrative, she would have a choice, one that's entirely her own"
Sunshine,739,15,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,Direk Tonet has managed to make such a compact film about choice
Sunshine,739,16,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,"While choice for women is such a privilege in a conservative country like ours, there’s something powerful in showing that Sunshine made a choice, one that goes against the conventional"
Sunshine,739,17,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,"While other films of the same topic would leave it to the audience to ponder whether or not the protagonist would choose the controversial choice, Sunshine showed us that yes, she did that"
Sunshine,739,18,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,"After the end credits have rolled, we were left staring at the black screen, perhaps, feeling fulfilled, weighed upon, or hungrier than ever for films of the same caliber"
Sunshine,739,19,tristanmdv,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is so monumental for Philippine cinema that it reaffirms one of my aspirations, that one day, Filipinos can have the choice about what films to watch in the cinema every weekend, not choose just either one—satisfying their physiological hunger or fulfilling the hunger of the soul"
Sunshine,740,1,pcyromeo,,200.0,ltbx,damn nahiya ako as a pastors kid
Sunshine,740,2,pcyromeo,,200.0,ltbx,I FELT ATTACKED (rightfully so) sobrang mahal ko si maris
Sunshine,740,3,pcyromeo,,200.0,ltbx,salamat sa ate ko nang libre
Sunshine,741,1,necyicedteaaa,,200.0,ltbx,direk tonet did it again
Sunshine,742,1,xksdl,,200.0,ltbx,i did not expect to be bawling in the cinema
Sunshine,743,1,ming__hua,,160.0,ltbx,Me after the movie:
Sunshine,744,1,meadeuw,,200.0,ltbx,perfectly articulated in the film ‘yung thoughts and feelings ng isang taong dala-dala ang pangarap hindi lang ng sarili pati na rin ng buong pamilya niya kapag nalaman nilang nagdadalang tao sila at a time na hindi sila handa
Sunshine,744,2,meadeuw,,200.0,ltbx,"tulad nga ng sinabi ko sa partner ko, kung ano nararamdaman ni sunshine, gano’n at gano’n mararamdaman mo kapag babae ka"
Sunshine,744,3,meadeuw,,200.0,ltbx,"ang babae ‘di tulad ng lalaki na basta-basta lang makakawala sa gano’ng responsibilidad—mabigat siya, at nakakapagpabago talaga ng buhay"
Sunshine,744,4,meadeuw,,200.0,ltbx,kakaiba ang sunshine
Sunshine,744,5,meadeuw,,200.0,ltbx,easily one of my most favorite films of all time
Sunshine,745,1,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,"mabigat, nakakagalit, pero higit sa lahat, punong puno pa rin ng pag-asa"
Sunshine,745,2,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,"simple lang intindihin si sunshine hindi na kailangan ng matinding backstory para magets mo kung gaano siya kapursigido para sa pangarap niya, kahit sino naman siguro sa atin"
Sunshine,745,3,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,nakakagalit dahil tao rin siyang binigo ng sistema
Sunshine,745,4,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,nakakainis na hanggang ngayon ay inaantay pa rin ng mga kababaihan ang araw na hahayaan tayong magpasya sa kung anong gusto nating gawin sa ating katawan
Sunshine,745,5,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,it’s our basic human right; bodily autonomy yet sobrang hirap ipaintindi sa mga hipokrito at konserbatibo
Sunshine,745,6,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang bigat sa pakiramdam na kakapit sa patalim ang mga babae para lamang magkaroon ng choice
Sunshine,745,7,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,choice na dapat malaya kaming pag-isipan at piliin
Sunshine,745,8,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,choice na hindi magiging kutya
Sunshine,745,9,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,choice na hindi namin ikakukulong
Sunshine,745,10,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,malayang pagpapasya
Sunshine,745,11,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,"sa kabila ng sakit at galit sa sistema at sa ingay sa paligid niya, nanaig ang determinasyon ni sunshine"
Sunshine,745,12,blairbedumb,,200.0,ltbx,pinatunayan niyang hindi kailanman nakakabawas sa pagkababae ng isang tao ang pagpili
Sunshine,746,1,patchworks,,200.0,ltbx,"metro manila chaos, the good and the bad, and what the working class makes out of it, sunshine is about filipino womanhood and their grasp on bodily autonomy"
Sunshine,746,2,patchworks,,200.0,ltbx,pinaka naenjoy ko yung soundscapes into moments of silences that make the main character's stakes so much more hitting
Sunshine,746,3,patchworks,,200.0,ltbx,god i love this film
Sunshine,747,1,centgab,,180.0,ltbx,"As someone who's, you could say, a bit conservative at times—oo gets ko"
Sunshine,748,1,yujivincent,,160.0,ltbx,Can I just commend how great the cast’s performances were
Sunshine,748,2,yujivincent,,160.0,ltbx,"Perhaps the best Filipino film of the year so far, and an important one at that"
Sunshine,749,1,lancetan06,,180.0,ltbx,“GETS KO NA
Sunshine,749,2,lancetan06,,180.0,ltbx,"”First things first, thank you Direk Antoinette Jadaone for being so brave"
Sunshine,749,3,lancetan06,,180.0,ltbx,Our country badly needs films that dare to confront the cries and injustices our society (esp women) continue to face
Sunshine,749,4,lancetan06,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a soft, aching plea for change"
Sunshine,749,5,lancetan06,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s a quiet but urgent cry for body autonomy, for choice, for justice"
Sunshine,749,6,lancetan06,,180.0,ltbx,"And it’s not just about one woman’s pain — it’s rooted in something deeper: a system that has long failed us, most esp women, in this country"
Sunshine,750,1,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine begins with control
Sunshine,750,2,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"With poise, with the perfect arabesque, and with the precision of a gymnast that is ready for the next move"
Sunshine,750,3,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"But as the film moves along, the tension in the stillness builds up and begins to show"
Sunshine,750,4,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Behind the clean flow and rhythm of theribbon, the rehearsed elegance of the body is still pushed to their limit"
Sunshine,750,5,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine feels like a cruel misdirection, but the contrast is exactly the point that womanhood needs"
Sunshine,750,6,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"In a country where abortion is still illegal without exceptions, Sunshine doesn’t just tell the story of a young woman’s crisis"
Sunshine,750,7,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"It captures a quiet violence of expectation, the pressure to remain graceful even when they are under a system that does not allow women to fail, to choose, or even to speak freely"
Sunshine,750,8,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"In the Philippines, the Revised Penal Code punishes abortion with imprisonment, while access to safe and legal procedures remains out of reach for most women, especially those who are young and unfortunate"
Sunshine,750,9,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Punishment because of abortion with imprisonment, and this legal stance is reinforced by deeply rooted religious conservatism"
Sunshine,750,10,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,It is not just illegal—it is unthinkable
Sunshine,750,11,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"The stigma runs deep, and the silence surrounding it is even deeper"
Sunshine,750,12,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"According to the Center for Reproductive Rights (2023), thousands of women are forced into this silence every year"
Sunshine,750,13,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,Estimated around 1
Sunshine,750,14,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,1 million Filipino women induce abortion annually
Sunshine,750,15,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"About 1,000 of Filipinas die each year from abortion-related complications, and over 100,000are hospitalized due to unsafe procedures"
Sunshine,750,16,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"These numbers are not just statistics, they are lives of the young, scared, and the unheard"
Sunshine,750,17,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine puts that reality front and center, but does so without shouting"
Sunshine,750,18,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"It doesn’t force emotion, it lets it build naturally"
Sunshine,750,19,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"This film follows Sunshine as she navigates through the aftermath of a missed period, a distracted boyfriend, and a society that offers no legal, safe, or accessible options"
Sunshine,750,20,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"She’s left to carry the weight of a decision she didn’t choose, in a system that treats her body like public property"
Sunshine,750,21,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine (played by Maris Racal) is a kind character with stillness that feels like a resistance
Sunshine,750,22,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Her performance is tight, contained, and filled with the kind of fear that is quiet and does not seek and beg for sympathy"
Sunshine,750,23,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,A character with a facade that represents many generations of women where they mask all of their feelings and hold on to the thought that “this too shall pass”
Sunshine,750,24,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"She is not trying to explain herself, she is simply trying to breathe and move in a world that keeps on closing in"
Sunshine,750,25,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,Racal does not rely on big breakdowns or dramatic lines
Sunshine,750,26,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,She holds her ground even when that ground is crumbling beneath her
Sunshine,750,27,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Every look, every breath, feels calibrated"
Sunshine,750,28,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,Like someone preparing for a landing they know they might not even survive
Sunshine,750,29,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,What makes the performance even more powerful is how familiar Sunshine feels
Sunshine,750,30,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,She is notwritten as an extraordinary character
Sunshine,750,31,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"She is a regular young woman, navigating school, relationships, and the uncertainty of early adulthood"
Sunshine,750,32,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"She could be any girl from any province, any city, any university"
Sunshine,750,33,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,That ordinariness is important
Sunshine,750,34,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,Because it reminds us that this story isnot rare
Sunshine,750,35,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,It is not fiction
Sunshine,750,36,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"It is the quiet, constant reality of so many young women in this country who are forced to navigate the consequences of a decision they didn’t even get to make"
Sunshine,750,37,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,Jadaone doesn’t push for spectacle
Sunshine,750,38,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,The film sits with silence and discomfort
Sunshine,750,39,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,No overdramatization and overexplanation
Sunshine,750,40,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Her braveness has a place in Philippine Cinema as this take and storytelling of hers about abortion in a world where systems and institutions are fallingshort, the quiet resistance of Sunshine speaks volume"
Sunshine,750,41,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Instead of turning the film into a message movie, Jadaone chooses to linger"
Sunshine,750,42,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,She doesn’t try to solve anything
Sunshine,750,43,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,She doesn’t pretend that resolution is possible
Sunshine,750,44,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,And that’s what makes Sunshine hit even harder
Sunshine,750,45,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t just show the problem, it lets us sit in it"
Sunshine,750,46,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,It allows discomfort to stretch across the screen without rushing to ease it
Sunshine,750,47,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,That discomfort mirrors what many women feel in real life
Sunshine,750,48,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,The shame
Sunshine,750,49,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,The fear
Sunshine,750,50,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,The confusion
Sunshine,750,51,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"The silence that comes not from peace, but from pressure"
Sunshine,750,52,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,It also explores the feelings through visuals
Sunshine,750,53,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Pao Orendain, the Cinematographer of the film captures the feel of the City of Manila"
Sunshine,750,54,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"How it is familiar inside the streets, but also how suffocating it is"
Sunshine,750,55,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"The noise pollution that is made by the vehicles, the streets filled with conversations, and the trains rattling as it passes by"
Sunshine,750,56,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"The way they captured it, Manila is just another place where it forces the characters to move carefully, just like any other people who lives, visits, and goes to Manila to reclaim life"
Sunshine,750,57,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"The streets hum with life, but not always with warmth"
Sunshine,750,58,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"The camera observes from a distance, never forcing perspective but always aware of the space Sunshine must navigate"
Sunshine,750,59,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,What makes Sunshine stand out is that it never asks permission to tell this story
Sunshine,750,60,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"It does not frame abortion as a debate, or as an issue that needs to be justified"
Sunshine,750,61,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,It centers the experience without apology
Sunshine,750,62,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"In doing so, it offers a kind of cinematic resistance that feels rare in Philippine cinema"
Sunshine,750,63,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Jadaone’s choice to tell this story without moralizing, without preaching, without forcing catharsis, gives it more weight than any dramatic scene ever could"
Sunshine,750,64,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"And in a country that still debates whether women should have that right, Sunshine lands, not perfectly, but with all the force of someone who has had enough"
Sunshine,750,65,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,Someone who knows she deserves more
Sunshine,750,66,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"And that is enough to shake the ground beneath her, even if no one else is watching"
Sunshine,750,67,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Like a gymnast mid-tumble, it shows how much strength it takes just to survive a fall"
Sunshine,750,68,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"And sometimes, survival is the bravest routine of all"
Sunshine,750,69,kyusigodz,,200.0,ltbx,"Gets na gets kita, Sunshine"
Sunshine,751,1,baltarle,,,ltbx,This review features some spoilers
Sunshine,751,2,baltarle,,,ltbx,"In local cinema, as with mainstream media, there’s a dearth of films tackling abortion"
Sunshine,751,3,baltarle,,,ltbx,"12 Weeks, Anna Isabelle Matutina’s Cinemalaya feature debut, was the latest attempt I could recall, or at least one that had something useful to say"
Sunshine,751,4,baltarle,,,ltbx,"At the same time, a comprehensive sexuality education integrated at all education levels (separate from the education department’s sex ed order), as proposed in the anti-teenage pregnancy bill, has been under fire from the country’s conservative population"
Sunshine,751,5,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Into this frantic context emerges Sunshine, the latest indie darling from writer-director Antoinette Jadaone"
Sunshine,751,6,baltarle,,,ltbx,"The sole Philippine entry in the Centrepiece section of the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, the film finally comes home"
Sunshine,751,7,baltarle,,,ltbx,"It’s making its local premiere exclusively at SM cinemas, after touring the international film fest circuit to critical renown, including the Crystal Bear for Best Film at this year’s Berlin International Film Festival"
Sunshine,751,8,baltarle,,,ltbx,"But make no mistake, as the picture refuses to be singled out as an “abortion film,” a descriptor so sweeping and limiting that it is seen only vis-à-vis morality"
Sunshine,751,9,baltarle,,,ltbx,Jadaone finds new ammo with which to make sense of the polarizing topic: gymnastics
Sunshine,751,10,baltarle,,,ltbx,"(The film’s TIFF world premiere, in fact, came at the heels of gymnast Carlos Yulo’s double Olympic gold in Paris"
Sunshine,751,11,baltarle,,,ltbx,")The sports drama unfolds through the title character, played by Maris Racal, a young gymnast whose preparation for national tryouts is upended after discovering she’s pregnant"
Sunshine,751,12,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Refusing to compromise her shot at Olympic glory, with her useless boyfriend (Elijah Canlas) almost instantly ditching her, Sunshine resorts to illegal abortifacients offered by Manila’s underbelly, where she runs into an enigmatic young girl (Annika Go) bent on tracking her every move and policing her every decision"
Sunshine,751,13,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Soon, she internalizes biblical shame"
Sunshine,751,14,baltarle,,,ltbx,Sunshine follows Jadaone’s feminist inclinations
Sunshine,751,15,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Her directorial debut Six Degrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay (2011), is a raw mockumentary that doubles as a compelling paean to the titular screen bit actress, whose name is nearly synonymous with Philippine horror but has largely remained underappreciated"
Sunshine,751,16,baltarle,,,ltbx,"In Never Not Love You (2018), Nadine Lustre’s Joanne is a breadwinner who trades a long-awaited job promotion in Manila for a fraught chance to begin anew and dream together with her privileged boyfriend in London, only to wrestle with the punishing economics of romance"
Sunshine,751,17,baltarle,,,ltbx,Fan Girl (2020) explores the dark side of being a superfan through a female character who’s a proxy for the film’s articulation about the psychology of idle worship in a nation forever beholden to it
Sunshine,751,18,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Shortcomings of these movies aside, Jadaone insists on narratives that do not treat and present the female gaze as though it’s self-explanatory"
Sunshine,751,19,baltarle,,,ltbx,"The director often edges toward gray areas and destabilizing standpoints, whether or not they wind up humorous, fascinating, schmaltzy, or troubling"
Sunshine,751,20,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Whereas Jadaone’s previous movies are attuned to the conventions of their respective genres, Sunshine offers something new to the director’s dramaturgical defaults"
Sunshine,751,21,baltarle,,,ltbx,The film is an intersection of neorealism and magical realism
Sunshine,751,22,baltarle,,,ltbx,"It trains the camera on Manila’s grime, decay, and nonstop noise, embracing its outcasts and harsh truths (the Lino Brocka comparisons are inevitable), just as it punctuates the gritty reality with a magical invocation via the imaginary friend that trails Sunshine"
Sunshine,751,23,baltarle,,,ltbx,“Media literacy” would tell you that the spectral presence is a representation of the internal-external friction the heroine deals with; fetus in the flesh and the body that refuses to carry it; the back-and-forth between morality and pragmatism
Sunshine,751,24,baltarle,,,ltbx,"(Jadaone, in an interview with Filmmaker Magazine, revealed she was inspired by the imaginary character in Taika Waititi’s 2019 satirical drama Jojo Rabbit"
Sunshine,751,25,baltarle,,,ltbx,") But beyond this, the make-believe figure is a surrogate for the conservative, pro-life fraction of the audience, with the director opting to engage in the subject matter’s complexity instead of comfortably locating the film in an echo chamber"
Sunshine,751,26,baltarle,,,ltbx,"While the narrative device could prove as an apparent play at sympathy, indulging in a “will she, won’t she” kind of thinking (surface-level reading could also suggest that women seeking abortion are deluded, ridiculous as that implication might sound), it also offers access to the broader violence disguised as “conscience” that puts women, regardless of gender identities, at a disadvantage"
Sunshine,751,27,baltarle,,,ltbx,"If anything, Sunshine is less about the act of abortion itself than about the systems that encourage women to settle for dehumanizing rights already decided for them by a patriarchal few, systems that prohibit them from dreaming, and tell them that to dream only means more labor, nothing more"
Sunshine,751,28,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Sunshine, like Petersen Vargas’ Some Nights I Feel Like Walking (which made its Philippine premiere in June), harnesses the metropolis as a character of its own, instead of reducing it to a mere symbolic backdrop"
Sunshine,751,29,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Whereas Some Nights steeps its urban tale in neon erotica, completely absent of daylight, Sunshine shifts between the city’s diurnal and nocturnal environments"
Sunshine,751,30,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Pao Orendain’s camerawork here chiefly reaps magic from close-ups and interior shots, often framed from the window and dotted by a shaft of light (hence the Brocka sentiments), locating the viewer into the heroine’s intimate yet anxious state"
Sunshine,751,31,baltarle,,,ltbx,"The self-induced abortion scene in the sketchy motel, a sight casually interrupted by frantic railway noise, is particularly visceral that you can almost feel the texture of the image"
Sunshine,751,32,baltarle,,,ltbx,"The camera also draws focus to the irony that permeates Manila’s streets, particularly around the vicinity of Quiapo Church, where makeshift stalls selling figurines, scapulars, and all sorts of religious paraphernalia also offer abortion drugs and quack treatments, just as banners declaring “abortion is murder” remain a typical sighting"
Sunshine,751,33,baltarle,,,ltbx,"In other scenes where Sunshine traverses the cityscape, the visuals are more straightforward"
Sunshine,751,34,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Accompanying the images is a soundscape that immersively mirrors the congestion, exhaustion, and urban din that form part of the DNA of the country’s capital"
Sunshine,751,35,baltarle,,,ltbx,Jadaone’s script nearly leans on the miserablist
Sunshine,751,36,baltarle,,,ltbx,"When Sunshine finds an opportunity to pull herself out of the vexing situation, poverty immediately gets in the way, leaving her with no choice but to ask her boyfriend for a meager P5,000 to secure the abortion drug and a cheap motel room to perform the deed herself"
Sunshine,751,37,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Yet even in Manila’s hospitals, the conditions are dire; patients are forced to share beds, and hallways are turned into makeshift wards, crowded by people in need of attention beyond the medical"
Sunshine,751,38,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Rape and casual prostitution also get in the way, as in the case of Menggay (Rhed Bustamante), the pregnant 13-year-old Sunshine comes across in Quiapo"
Sunshine,751,39,baltarle,,,ltbx,"In a highlight moment, Sunshine, livid upon meeting her friend’s abuser, suddenly picks up a beer bottle and whacks it over the man’s head, before sprinting to escape the scene"
Sunshine,751,40,baltarle,,,ltbx,"(Curiously, Jadaone plumbs the politics of self-determination by contrasting Sunshine’s ability to decide for herself with Menggay’s distance from that very sense of agency"
Sunshine,751,41,baltarle,,,ltbx,") Even the Quiapo vendors selling abortifacients, who some might think merely exploit the desperation of their customers, are also victims who simply don’t earn enough"
Sunshine,751,42,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Unflattering as these depictions are, it’s hard to deny that these aren’t routine realities in the social inferno that is the Philippines"
Sunshine,751,43,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Still, there is humor, whether in a scene that involves a knife interrupting a silly argument, or in another that sees a self-righteous doctor preaching the goodness of the divine"
Sunshine,751,44,baltarle,,,ltbx,"As Sunshine, Racal delivers a performance that would be a disservice to reduce to neat superlatives"
Sunshine,751,45,baltarle,,,ltbx,It’s a physical portrayal that required the actor to undergo training with national gymnastics coaches for nearly a year
Sunshine,751,46,baltarle,,,ltbx,It’s a role that might put her in the center of another controversy after barely surviving the previous one
Sunshine,751,47,baltarle,,,ltbx,"But just as Sunshine is asked to “drown out the noise” whenever she steps on the mat, Racal distills every layer and emotion into a character that’s simply life-like, almost free from the veil of performance-making"
Sunshine,751,48,baltarle,,,ltbx,Jadaone once told me that her ideal lead performance is one that “is part of something bigger than herself
Sunshine,751,49,baltarle,,,ltbx,” There has not been a more worthy portrayal in local cinema this year
Sunshine,751,50,baltarle,,,ltbx,"At the same time, the movie functions as a reintroduction to the boundless talent of Jennica Garcia, who plays Sunshine’s elder sister, a single mother trying to keep everything intact"
Sunshine,751,51,baltarle,,,ltbx,Her portrayal expertly captures what a supporting performance should be—one that has enough screentime to be an emotional anchor for the lead but also generates her own moment
Sunshine,751,52,baltarle,,,ltbx,There’s a kind of invisible labor informing the character that Garcia encapsulates with an onscreen presence that always feels grounded and never incidental
Sunshine,751,53,baltarle,,,ltbx,Sunshine is hardly a social exposé
Sunshine,751,54,baltarle,,,ltbx,"What ripples throughout this partly winding urban tale is a ready, fatal fact about the place of women in this eternally eroded nation that we’d rather dismiss as “controversial” or “divisive” because we refuse to listen"
Sunshine,751,55,baltarle,,,ltbx,"The film’s visuals might be artful, but they don’t always convey a pretty picture"
Sunshine,751,56,baltarle,,,ltbx,"It’s no coincidence that the movie’s narrative throughline is the community that Sunshine finds in the women around her: her elder sister, her best friend (Xyriel Manabat), despite her initial inhibitions, her coach (Meryll Soriano), the young Menggay, the compassionate doctor (Angeli Bayani), and even the imaginary friend"
Sunshine,751,57,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Though this sense of solidarity comes at varying degrees, it keeps Sunshine afloat and does not let her think of herself as a monster for terminating an unwanted pregnancy"
Sunshine,751,58,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Once Sunshine nears its final shot, I keep thinking of Fan Girl’s insular ending that succeeds its heroine’s already exhausting journey"
Sunshine,751,59,baltarle,,,ltbx,I’m glad to learn that our heroine this time does not succumb to sheer epiphany
Sunshine,751,60,baltarle,,,ltbx,"Here, hope actually feels like a tangible possibility instead of an unwarranted emotional wallop"
Sunshine,751,61,baltarle,,,ltbx,Sunshine is perhaps not Jadaone’s most definitive work; That Thing Called Tadhana (2014) or Never Not Love You might claim that distinction
Sunshine,751,62,baltarle,,,ltbx,But it is her sharpest creation yet
Sunshine,751,63,baltarle,,,ltbx,It took a whole lot of research and lived experiences to put this story on the screen
Sunshine,751,64,baltarle,,,ltbx,It took a bit of time for the film to make its way back to where it started
Sunshine,751,65,baltarle,,,ltbx,It’s a miracle that it even got the go signal to be screened publicly
Sunshine,751,66,baltarle,,,ltbx,I can already sense all the hot takes and thinkpieces it will generate
Sunshine,751,67,baltarle,,,ltbx,And I can only hope that it will be as meaningful as this
Sunshine,751,68,baltarle,,,ltbx,This review appears on PhilSTAR Life in a slightly different version
Sunshine,752,1,anxrei,,200.0,ltbx,maris i have never doubted you
Sunshine,752,2,anxrei,,200.0,ltbx,also need to see jennica garcia in a lead role
Sunshine,753,1,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,"Last year, I saw High School Scandal"
Sunshine,753,2,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,Both films share the same throughline that Philippine health care sucks when it comes to pregnancy and sex education
Sunshine,753,3,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,High School Scandal was made in the 80s
Sunshine,753,4,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,"The difference being is that Sunshine made me feel hopeful, while High School Scandal made me feel depressed"
Sunshine,753,5,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,Here's the thing
Sunshine,753,6,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a very heavy film, but what makes Sunshine such a heartlifting film to watch is that she had the proper support system whether she decides to keep the child or not"
Sunshine,753,7,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,She gets to choose if she wants to carry the baby or not
Sunshine,753,8,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,"She has a sister that cares about her well being, a best friend who will do everything for her, and strangely enough, a manifestation of what her child will be"
Sunshine,753,9,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,"The film shows that women should at the end of the day, have the final choice in matters related to childbirth"
Sunshine,753,10,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,"Oh and with heavy topic such as this, let women be the major voice in the storytelling"
Sunshine,753,11,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is a powerhouse actress
Sunshine,753,12,ukiyaseed,,180.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadoane is a great writer and director and deserves all the praise in handling such a tough topic
Sunshine,754,1,indigolotto,,180.0,ltbx,sana magets na rin ng buong pilipinas

Sunshine,757,3,hershi,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal they could never make me hate you
Sunshine,758,1,auerod,,140.0,ltbx,A powerful movie that tackles an issue which is considered taboo in the Philippines
Sunshine,758,2,auerod,,140.0,ltbx,Good storytelling and a moving performance by Maris Racal
Sunshine,759,1,lemonchomp,,200.0,ltbx,very tearjerker sya ma
Sunshine,759,2,lemonchomp,,200.0,ltbx,"ANYWAY ang galing ni maris huhu commendable acting also from rhed bustamante sobrang cry talaga ako sa scenes nya  i love how direk tonet emphasized na not all teenage pregnancies ay dahil sa raging hormones at lack of education nila, but that they also exist because they were raped, no less than by their relatives"
Sunshine,759,3,lemonchomp,,200.0,ltbx,kaya sobrang importante ang pelikulang to para isulong na madecriminalize ang abortion also
Sunshine,759,4,lemonchomp,,200.0,ltbx,"loveee ung scene nung kinakausap si sunshine ng doktor after unang attempt niya, hindi natin maikakaila talaga na no matter how educated a person is, minsan talaga hindi umuusad ung mga belief nila sa mga comtroversial na bagay"
Sunshine,759,5,lemonchomp,,200.0,ltbx,kaya shoutout kay jennica garcia nung binara nya si doc ang galing nya don maaa
Sunshine,760,1,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,“Gets ko na
Sunshine,760,2,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,"”In this film, we follow Sunshine, a rhythmic gymnast and an Olympic hopeful, as she travels through Manila’s dark, narrow, grimy, and crowded streets and alleys in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy in a country where abortion is illegal"
Sunshine,760,3,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,There are few parts of this film that really stood out to me because they made elevated the movie and made it more compelling
Sunshine,760,4,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,The first part that I really liked is how the city became a living representation of this country’s oppressive stance against anything pro-abortion
Sunshine,760,5,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,"The city allowed us to have something tangible, to be able to relate to Sunshine’s struggles even more"
Sunshine,760,6,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,"Second, the magical realism aspect is also a highlight for me"
Sunshine,760,7,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,"Once it finally clicked what Ariana and Annika Co’s characters represented, I was blown away"
Sunshine,760,8,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,One common argument of those against abortion is that you are going to kill someone who’s probably gonna be a very important person
Sunshine,760,9,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,"And yet, we get Annika Co’s character"
Sunshine,760,10,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,Through a very powerful performance we end up caring for this kid
Sunshine,760,11,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,"But once you start to realize who she us and who she represents, you start to realize that she’s not just an extension of Sunshine but a representative of all babies born to mothers forced to carry a child"
Sunshine,760,12,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,She and these babies are vessels forced to carry the unfulfilled dreams of their mothers
Sunshine,760,13,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,"She said something like, “Ang pangarap niya ay ang pangarap ko"
Sunshine,760,14,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,” And that line broke me
Sunshine,760,15,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,"The argument is always, “We are not fulfilling someone’s potential if we abort them"
Sunshine,760,16,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,” but there’s always a failure to acknowledge that forcing someone to bear a child is also not allowing them to fulfill their potential
Sunshine,760,17,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,The last part that stood out to me is Maris Racal’s great performance
Sunshine,760,18,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,She is the movie
Sunshine,760,19,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,"Without that performance, this film will fall apart and she delivers"
Sunshine,760,20,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,What this film did is humanize a debate that’s usually so contentious it ends up being too one dimensional
Sunshine,760,21,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,It made the debate more accessible to every one
Sunshine,760,22,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,The movie is unflinching and raw
Sunshine,760,23,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,"A harsh criticism of a society and culture who despite being always proud of their women, continues to fail them by continuing to enabling oppressive systems that mostly targets women"
Sunshine,760,24,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,A big middle finger to a society that still strongly reeks of misogyny
Sunshine,760,25,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,It also an exploration of the country’s broken healthcare system
Sunshine,760,26,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,This film is a celebration of female friendships and sisterhood
Sunshine,760,27,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,The people who helped Sunshine in her journey are women
Sunshine,760,28,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,It forces you to be uncomfortable
Sunshine,760,29,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,It forces you to think and have empathy
Sunshine,760,30,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,This film is highly relevant and should be a required watching for everyone
Sunshine,760,31,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,Probably one of the most important Filipino films ever made
Sunshine,760,32,mobirebyu,,160.0,ltbx,Hope it gets an even wider release

Sunshine,762,1,julius_asuncion,,180.0,ltbx,A narrative that explores personal choices and bodily autonomy against the backdrop of a deeply conservative Philippine culture
Sunshine,762,3,julius_asuncion,,180.0,ltbx,"I like how the film draws an ironic parallel between the fate of Rhed Bustamante’s character and Sunshine’s, especially regarding their situations, available support, resources, and freedom to choose"
Sunshine,762,4,julius_asuncion,,180.0,ltbx,"”: Cinema 1, SM Mall of Asia"
Sunshine,763,1,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,we meet sunshine through her battle of being an olympian
Sunshine,763,2,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"armored by her well-worn asian games shirt and her head held high, she shines the brightest among her peers who also look up to her and what more she can become"
Sunshine,763,3,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"her coach knows this too, along with her family and lifelong friend, who would all do everything to make sure she achieves them"
Sunshine,763,4,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"perhaps its in the nuance of a story that is deeply feminist and human, but antoinette's jadaone's sunshine is the strongest in its ability to capture the realities of adolescent pregnancy with both gentleness and fierce"
Sunshine,763,5,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"portraying (albeit sometimes preaching about, but deservingly so) the world of a filipina girl navigating the weight of expectations and the silence surrounding sexual and reproductive health, the story unfolds as a reflection of what we lack and suffer from"
Sunshine,763,6,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"this flaw persists in the lesson of consent that was never taught, contraception never offered, the judgment of clinical service providers, the terrifying possibility of dying alone, and the unbearable strength it takes to push forward anyway, not because you’re fearless, but because you must"
Sunshine,763,7,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,as a youth
Sunshine,763,8,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,as a woman
Sunshine,763,9,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,as a human with dreams and rights
Sunshine,763,10,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"the reality today is rough: the philippine government failed to pass its version of the adolescent pregnancy prevention bill in the recent senate, the current curriculum and implementation of the comprehensive sexuality education is in question, and more and more right-wing (ish) groups are mobilizing their funds to hinder the fight even more"
Sunshine,763,11,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"but hopefully, with these kind of films made accessible to the public, we will be reminded that abortion happens not just because teenagers are risky or that they have been abuse hence it's justified, but because they have the right to decide for themselves"
Sunshine,763,12,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"after all, sunshine's every step and every twirl, carries not just her own hope, but the collective dreams of those who raised her, and fought for her to have this"
Sunshine,763,13,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,"and in watching her take the mat, we are reminded of every girl who dreams of olympic gold, of becoming president, of curing AIDS, and how urgent it is that we believe in them first before some blob of blood"
Sunshine,763,14,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,that we talk to them about things that matter
Sunshine,763,15,ghostfacers,,,ltbx,that we care

Sunshine,769,1,forgineo,,200.0,ltbx,"A film full of images of ironies: The jeepney with God’s Gift sign, the abortifacients sold next to religious figures, sunshine being named one when her life seemed to be dark, and words of encouragement that made the burden heavier"
Sunshine,769,2,forgineo,,200.0,ltbx,"In a country that is driven by morals, Sunshine begs to question and reassess our morales"

Sunshine,770,2,rexson,,200.0,ltbx,"It speaks directly to the young women whose stories are erased, stigmatized, or left in the shadows"
Sunshine,770,3,rexson,,200.0,ltbx,"It exposes the hypocrisy of a system that forces women to choose between their futures and their autonomy, between silence and survival"
Sunshine,770,4,rexson,,200.0,ltbx,"This film does not simply ask whether abortion is right or wrong, it asks us why we’ve made it so dangerous to even ask the question"
Sunshine,770,5,rexson,,200.0,ltbx,Decriminalize abortion now
Sunshine,771,1,evanoids,,200.0,ltbx,Time and time again watching films and sharing my appreciation for the art form always felt one-dimensional
Sunshine,771,2,evanoids,,200.0,ltbx,But there was a gut feeling that Sunshine was gonna be different
Sunshine,771,3,evanoids,,200.0,ltbx,"Watching this with my religious mom, laughing through the hypocrisies of it all and finally tearing up toward its third act felt intriguing"
Sunshine,771,4,evanoids,,200.0,ltbx,"As we walked down to a nearby coffee shop, she shared her miscarriage story; she was just as scared as Sunshine, a story on what-ifs and what could’ve been, a thought they both pondered on"
Sunshine,771,5,evanoids,,200.0,ltbx,This time my mom didn’t
Sunshine,771,6,evanoids,,200.0,ltbx,She went for her thirdAnd gave birth to whomshe’s sharing the story to
Sunshine,771,7,evanoids,,200.0,ltbx,The comparisons with Brocka aren’t an exaggeration

Sunshine,776,2,cyrusp_26,,180.0,ltbx,it takes so much guts to produce a beautiful and realistic film touching on reproductive rights in a country that is predominantly catholic and conservative
Sunshine,776,3,cyrusp_26,,180.0,ltbx,"kailan pa ba magegets ng mga pilipino si sunshine, na paulit ulit na lang nahihirapan abutin ang pangarap dahil sa mga ingay ng mga tao"

Sunshine,791,5,dond30,,180.0,ltbx,"As one fellow moviegoer said, we’ve probably met a “Sunshine” at some point"
Sunshine,791,6,dond30,,180.0,ltbx,"Maybe a friend, a neighbor, a classmate, or even someone you just passed by"
Sunshine,791,7,dond30,,180.0,ltbx,And “Sunshine” reminds us that women are the light and fire that keep things going
Sunshine,791,10,dond30,,180.0,ltbx,Got to meet Direk Tonet for a quick debrief and Q&A right after the screening

Sunshine,793,2,rzcipriano,,200.0,ltbx,"long: what the film has perfectly executed are the harshest and best parts of Manila, strangers, families, and friends"
Sunshine,793,3,rzcipriano,,200.0,ltbx,"You could see that sometimes the ‘worst’ places are where you could see empathy and kindness—from motel/inn keepers, faith healers, and potions sellers, albeit pseudo-empathy"
Sunshine,793,4,rzcipriano,,200.0,ltbx,You could see that not all doctors have compassion
Sunshine,793,5,rzcipriano,,200.0,ltbx,And that you could not always rely…
Sunshine,794,1,googledorcs,,200.0,ltbx,"More than abortion, Sunshine is a film about a girl with a dream and passion - and her journey to get there"
Sunshine,794,2,googledorcs,,200.0,ltbx,This film is emphatetic

Sunshine,797,2,patriciasoriso,,200.0,ltbx,"lapat sa reyalidad ng pagiging babaeng pilipinong maralita yung pelikula at pinaka nagustuhan ko na hindi lang ito nagmitsa ng simula ng diskurso tungkol sa reproductive health ng kababaihan at usapin ng legalidad at moralidad ng aborsyon sa bansa, tumindig ito— sa katauhan ng bata, ni menggay, ni dra"
Sunshine,797,3,patriciasoriso,,200.0,ltbx,"helen, ni geleen, at ni sunshine"
Sunshine,797,4,patriciasoriso,,200.0,ltbx,"para sa'kin, doon mo lang makikita yung pananda na nagtagumpay yung layunin ng ganitong uri ng pelukula e"

Sunshine,797,6,patriciasoriso,,200.0,ltbx,"gustong gusto ko na sa huli, pinili ni sunshine yung pangarap niya at nang maabot niya yung buo at perpektong routine para sa qualifiers, tahimik at walang script yung eksena pero doon ko pinaka rinig na rinig yung puso ni niya"
Sunshine,797,7,patriciasoriso,,200.0,ltbx,"takot, ngunit buo ang loob, at napaka tapang ni sunshine hanggang sa huling segundo ng pelikula"
Sunshine,797,8,patriciasoriso,,200.0,ltbx,"para sa'kin, sobrang halaga na ipakita kung gaano kalaking bahagi ng buhay ng kababaihan yung nakasugal sa tuwing nalalagay sa panganib ng unwanted pregnancy"
Sunshine,797,9,patriciasoriso,,200.0,ltbx,"at yung suporta mula, unang una, sa pamilya, at higit, mula sa gobyerno— upang matamasa ng mga menggay at sunshine ng bansa yung kaligtasan at pagkakataon na mabuhay nang para sa sarili at pangarap—ay hindi dapat ipanawagan kundi ipagkaloob nang kusa at maging mandato"
Sunshine,797,10,patriciasoriso,,200.0,ltbx,kitang kita ko yung paglago ni maris racal bilang aktor dito
Sunshine,797,11,patriciasoriso,,200.0,ltbx,"iba rin ang kinang ni jennica garcia at annica co, sobrang deserve na makita pa sa mas maraming proyekto"
Sunshine,798,1,xdrncls,,160.0,ltbx,"A film dedicated for the Philippine women and their reproductive rights, a raw and realistic storytelling of what a pregnant teenager is going through"
Sunshine,798,2,xdrncls,,160.0,ltbx,"Some scenes were insignificant and I perceive it as pointless with what the film is trying to convey, but I think that these were necessary since it's not just Sunshine's world that was shown in the whole duration"
Sunshine,798,3,xdrncls,,160.0,ltbx,"Through this film, it dauntlessly opened up the existing act of incest in our country"
Sunshine,798,4,xdrncls,,160.0,ltbx,I was initially…

Sunshine,799,4,mmmmk,,100.0,ltbx,Ang counterproductive lang
Sunshine,800,1,time_,,160.0,ltbx,a very well-made film regarding the struggles of women’s reproductive health in the Philippines especially with the context of religion and culture
Sunshine,800,2,time_,,160.0,ltbx,Ioved the subtext of women supporting women even with however little they have (fave depiction of this was the 2nd hospital ward scene)
Sunshine,800,3,time_,,160.0,ltbx,having a physical representation of the characters’ conscience was also very interesting since it provided insights on the internal struggles sunshine was experiencing

Sunshine,801,3,daeblck,,200.0,ltbx,"ily, sunshine"
Sunshine,802,1,josiahvantonio,,200.0,ltbx,What I liked about the film is the liberty of the viewer to pick their own stand on the issue at hand with them laying out how the character arrived on the decision she chose for herself
Sunshine,802,2,josiahvantonio,,200.0,ltbx,Worth a second watch or even more
Sunshine,803,1,siayento,,200.0,ltbx,The best ph cinema has to offer

Sunshine,811,1,blughnco,,180.0,ltbx,"“drown out the noise”and yet, no matter how hard Sunshine tries to ignore these noises, what she endures is a different kind of restraint, pain, and mess—the kind she can’t forcibly silence, even if she tries"
Sunshine,811,2,blughnco,,180.0,ltbx,"hindi ako babae, pero gets ko si Sunshine"
Sunshine,811,3,blughnco,,180.0,ltbx,it’s been so long since a film has impacted and triggered something in me

Sunshine,811,6,blughnco,,180.0,ltbx,"without a doubt, Sunshine holds a special place in my heart"
Sunshine,811,7,blughnco,,180.0,ltbx,"maybe it’s because of how timely and relevant its message is, or because of Maris Racal’s powerful performance, or how it portrays the real noise and mess of Manila"
Sunshine,811,8,blughnco,,180.0,ltbx,i don’t know
Sunshine,811,9,blughnco,,180.0,ltbx,"but, what i do know is that i am deeply in love with this film, and i’ll never get tired of talking about it"

Sunshine,811,13,blughnco,,180.0,ltbx,Ang Husay Husay Husay
Sunshine,812,1,pelliekula,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a victim of her poor choice
Sunshine,812,2,pelliekula,,160.0,ltbx,She is a victim to the patriarchal system of the country
Sunshine,812,3,pelliekula,,160.0,ltbx,It perfectly encapsulates the intersectionality of being impoverished and a woman in the predominantly catholic setting
Sunshine,812,4,pelliekula,,160.0,ltbx,"It is a bold statement to the cruel realities women face, especially the ones at the bottom"
Sunshine,812,5,pelliekula,,160.0,ltbx,She is caged by the system
Sunshine,812,6,pelliekula,,160.0,ltbx,Jadaone has given justice in telling the plight women face
Sunshine,812,7,pelliekula,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine’s character is imperfect and flawed, but real which makes you root for her character"
Sunshine,812,8,pelliekula,,160.0,ltbx,This was emphasized by the camerawork which maintains a certain intimacy with the character that makes you see Sunshine’s vulnerability
Sunshine,812,9,pelliekula,,160.0,ltbx,"Racal portrayal of Sunshine makes you want to empathize with the character because amidst of all the imperfections, there is this young dreamer"
Sunshine,812,10,pelliekula,,160.0,ltbx,"Her poor decisions are the consequence of the society she exists in, wherein there is no other choice— leaving her to opt for desperate methods"

Sunshine,817,1,leoictyx,,200.0,ltbx,narinig ko lahat ng version ng tangina sa pelikulang ‘toTANGINA ANG GALING NI MARIS KAHIT HUMIHINGA LANG SIYA RAMDAM NA RAMDAM MO GETS
Sunshine,818,1,gielvin,,180.0,ltbx,damn right Maris
Sunshine,819,4,ohtalagaba,,160.0,ltbx,"It reminds me, yet again, of the society we live in"
Sunshine,819,5,ohtalagaba,,160.0,ltbx,"In this film, just like any other woman, Sunshine is a sunshine of her own—a woman with dreams, goals and stories to tell"
Sunshine,819,6,ohtalagaba,,160.0,ltbx,"A story that is too scary to talk, yet need to be heard and seen"
Sunshine,819,7,ohtalagaba,,160.0,ltbx,"I hope this film will not just become a story of its own, but a way for us to be strong enough to discuss these kinds of issues"
Sunshine,820,1,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine Is Every Woman Who Dreams Beyond Her CircumstancesSunshine was not created for the sake of making a statement, nor just triggering a conversation; it was meant to make people feel and understand why abortion happens and how our current system makes them dangerous for women"
Sunshine,820,2,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine did not need to be pitied or root for, she needed to be understood"
Sunshine,820,3,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,The film opens and immediately solidifies Sunshine’s ambition
Sunshine,820,4,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"It is anchored on Sunshine’s eagerness to excel, to achieve, to succeed, to be the best, to be an Olympian"
Sunshine,820,5,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,And this ambition is not going anywhere
Sunshine,820,6,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"With every tiptoe that Sunshine stands on—as she throws her pink ribbons and gives in to impulse—she stands tall again, catching the ribbons as if they were always meant to fall in the right places… until they don't"
Sunshine,820,7,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine’s perfect harmony gets disturbed by her sudden realization that she is pregnant
Sunshine,820,8,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone’s intentional direction on making some scenes too loud, too chaotic, and far too overwhelming added to the personification of Sunshine’s mind; scrambling, panicking, terrored"
Sunshine,820,9,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"It was not just Quiapo’s busy streets, it was also Sunshine’s trembling heart"
Sunshine,820,10,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"But in between the anxiety and fear, Sunshine gathers the courage to try making a choice—even amidst the confusion"
Sunshine,820,11,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine finds out in the harshest way possible that a choice is not an option
Sunshine,820,12,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"She is put in a situation where the only way out is to give in to ‘sinful’ acts, dangerous pills, and death-defying abortion attempts"
Sunshine,820,13,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"For a young teenager whose dreams seem too far from where she is, this is the only way"
Sunshine,820,14,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"While many expect this decision to become the climax of the movie, Sunshine’s story is far from over"
Sunshine,820,15,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"In my understanding, the film explored her conscience through Annika Co’s beautifully done character"
Sunshine,820,16,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"It reminded the audience that while women consent to abortion, they are still carrying its moral burden"
Sunshine,820,17,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"Annika’s character became an instrument to make women who seek abortion feel human, with human conscience and sensibilities"
Sunshine,820,18,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"But it was done with such care, careful enough not to make it counterproductive but rather stuck in the ideology of the system that she grew up in"
Sunshine,820,19,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"However, Annika’s character is only a personification of Sunshine’s chaotic mind, making Sunshine her own companion to her dawning journey"
Sunshine,820,20,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"This character becomes Sunshine’s comfort in the dangers of her abortion attempts, showing the deeply awful and tragic realities many women face; alone in rotting walls of the city, drowning out the noise, and daring to dream bigger than the spaces they are subjected in"
Sunshine,820,21,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,But what makes this movie even more special is that it did not let Sunshine go through it alone
Sunshine,820,22,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"While the movie was an avenue for telling the reality, it also became a source of hope for many women, especially for young ones who will watch it"
Sunshine,820,23,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"There will be other women supporting them in their decision, other women who will not judge them for their choices, and other women who will create a safe space for them—at least in ways that they can, in the rotting system we have"
Sunshine,820,24,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"Finally, Sunshine does not just urge the system to give women the rights to their own body; it explicitly explains what women go through in the struggles that we speak of"
Sunshine,820,25,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"It does not undermine the calls for a systemic change, but it brings you the stories behind why a choice is necessary"
Sunshine,820,26,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"It opens you to a narrative that does not just agree to progressive actions, but puts the heart in it"
Sunshine,820,27,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"And in between those narratives, the movie reminds us that women are more, that they deserve to take up more space"
Sunshine,820,28,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"Women are dreamers, they have ambition, they are complex, cohesive, and compassionate"
Sunshine,820,29,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"Women are more than their mistakes, their stories go beyond"
Sunshine,820,30,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,And that is the essence of a choice; to let them dream
Sunshine,820,31,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,To free them from the shackles of an already oppressing society
Sunshine,820,32,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"To not dim their light and let them shine, like Sunshine herself"
Sunshine,820,33,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,"To all the Sunshines out there, you are not alone"
Sunshine,820,34,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,Be steadfast on your ambition and dare to dream big
Sunshine,820,35,kagitlingan,,200.0,ltbx,And you take up space even bigger

Sunshine,824,1,thanatosfiel,,,ltbx,"Sunshine is a brave and powerful film—one that confronts a deeply taboo subject with grace, nuance, and emotional weight, especially within the context of the Philippines’ heavily religious culture"
Sunshine,824,2,thanatosfiel,,,ltbx,"Tonet Jadaone doesn’t pull punches, but she doesn’t sensationalize either"
Sunshine,824,3,thanatosfiel,,,ltbx,"It’s an honest, grounded portrayal of something often swept under the rug"
Sunshine,824,4,thanatosfiel,,,ltbx,"Maris Racal shines in a career-defining performance—raw, vulnerable, and fully committed"
Sunshine,824,5,thanatosfiel,,,ltbx,"This isn’t an easy watch, but it’s a necessary one"

Sunshine,830,1,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"In many known movies, abortion is commonly narrated as a quest with so much comedic acts, plus some forced shallow arguments to inject drama"
Sunshine,830,2,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,But for Sunshine — How the movie depicted purchasing a pregnancy test kit in the Philippines = an act to get humiliated
Sunshine,830,3,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine, a teenage Filipina athlete forged to be an Olympian who had an unwanted pregnancy, was the sacrificial being for a story to be told"
Sunshine,830,4,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine happened in the Philippines, where access to reproductive health services is way harder to have compared to other countries, like in the US and Europe"
Sunshine,830,5,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"The country has been enclosed with regressive conservatism, causing talks about sex to still be taboos"
Sunshine,830,6,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,Abortion is still illegal as well
Sunshine,830,7,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,The movie happened right smack in the heart of Manila City — Quiapo
Sunshine,830,8,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"It is an area known for a well-known Catholic Church and the surrounding kubols or booths of herbal medicines and potions for all uses — from seducing someone, cursing someone, to inducing abortion (or in Filipino, “pampawala ng kapit ng bata"
Sunshine,830,9,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"”) The story, its darkness, and some women’s resort to the said harmful options would not have happened if only proper education and healthcare are available, to be honest"
Sunshine,830,10,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine was very telling of the struggles of Filipinas
Sunshine,830,11,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,But I think it’s globally reflective as well because it told the following things:1
Sunshine,830,12,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,) Unfair treatment on female athletes: Remember Venus Williams’ pregnancy
Sunshine,830,13,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"She almost died after giving birth, and she was kicked out of the top ranks because she cannot play during recovery"
Sunshine,830,14,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,The WNBA players
Sunshine,830,15,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,They just wore shirts last All-Star weekend saying “Pay Us What You Owe Us
Sunshine,830,16,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"” And here, Sunshine, an aspiring Olympian, unintentionally risking her passion and potential bread and butter just because proper help is nowhere in sight"
Sunshine,830,18,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,") Violence against women and children: Catcalling, predatory stares, and rape were parts of this movie"
Sunshine,830,19,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,The movie did as much as it could to raise awareness that these actions are still apparent and are unfortunate enablers of all things that went downhill for the female characters
Sunshine,830,20,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine mirrored reality, especially for us, Filipinas"
Sunshine,830,21,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"I hate writing that sentence, but, it’s the truth"
Sunshine,830,22,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,————————Technical items I liked:• Rico Blanco’s Challengers-esque film score
Sunshine,830,23,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,The music was so immersive
Sunshine,830,24,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"• Rhetorical characters (which are pretty difficult to execute and usually come out as trying-hard, but they weren’t)• Piolo Pascual and his presence"
Sunshine,830,25,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,The audience just gasped as soon as he entered the frame
Sunshine,830,26,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,• Most of all — Maris Racal
Sunshine,830,27,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,Her future is so bright
Sunshine,830,28,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"Pain, so much pain, was expressed by her character"
Sunshine,830,29,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,And she did more than enough that the audience would want to stop whatever’s causing her agony
Sunshine,830,30,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"• Gusto Ko Sakin Ka Lang is a banger in a tugstugs jeep ↕If you’re in the Philippines, watch this in any SM Cinema"
Sunshine,830,31,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"If you’re outside the Philippines, watch out for more future film festivals"
Sunshine,830,32,toriteriyakidon,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine has been shown in the Toronto International Film Festival, Berlin International Film Festival, Palm Springs International Film Festival, and many more"
Sunshine,831,1,sushipicks,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine is more than a film about a teenage gymnast reaching for her olympic dreams
Sunshine,831,2,sushipicks,,180.0,ltbx,"it reflects the struggles, hopes, and quiet battles of countless young girls trying to find light in a world that often dims their shine"
Sunshine,831,3,sushipicks,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine isn’t just an athlete wearing an asian games shirt holding a pink crane—she is a woman, a sister, a student, a friend, and someone younger girls look up to"
Sunshine,831,4,sushipicks,,180.0,ltbx,"set in the noisy, smoggy, and congested streets of Manila, the film doesn’t shy away from the uncomfortable realities many Filipino girls face: teenage pregnancy, poverty, lack of access to healthcare and education, judgment from professionals, and the systemic neglect of women’s rights"
Sunshine,831,5,sushipicks,,180.0,ltbx,"it's not just Sunshine's story—it’s the story of so many young women who are silenced, dismissed, and left to figure things out on their own"
Sunshine,831,6,sushipicks,,180.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone once again directed a story that is not meant to be questioned, but understood"
Sunshine,831,7,sushipicks,,180.0,ltbx,it's in movies like this that we uncomfortably see how and why women resort to abortion-simply because they are forced by circumstances
Sunshine,831,8,sushipicks,,180.0,ltbx,"pregnant teens do not need to be told how reckless they were; they already know it, and they're already bearing the consequences of their actions"
Sunshine,831,9,sushipicks,,180.0,ltbx,"what they actually need is someone they can seek help from, someone who can give them the support they need"
Sunshine,831,10,sushipicks,,180.0,ltbx,lest we forget it's the government that continuously denies women their right to a safe society free from the shackles of abuse and neglect
Sunshine,831,11,sushipicks,,180.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal, you are one hell of an artist—and seeing you and Jennica Garcia in an Antoinette Jadaone film was something i didn't know i needed"
Sunshine,832,1,snoopyfilms,,180.0,ltbx,another breathtaking film from direk tonet
Sunshine,832,2,snoopyfilms,,180.0,ltbx,the love and care put into the creation of this film truly pours out of the screen with every sequence
Sunshine,832,3,snoopyfilms,,180.0,ltbx,i enjoyed the way it lulls you into a false sense of security with how it makes you think that you know where this is going–before it completely flips your world upside down by the end of the second act
Sunshine,832,4,snoopyfilms,,180.0,ltbx,"such clever and gripping storytelling and honestly, i expected nothing less from its director :')it's the subtle illustration of solidarity between women that really brought it home for me"
Sunshine,832,5,snoopyfilms,,180.0,ltbx,it's what made my heart ache the most too
Sunshine,832,6,snoopyfilms,,180.0,ltbx,"so glad i got to catch this in the cinema, it's definitely one for the books"

Sunshine,840,2,leomigraso,,140.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal kills it (debatable lol) as a gymnast chasing the Olympics, only to find out she’s knocked up"

Sunshine,843,2,taeyomi,,180.0,ltbx,"habang pinapanood ko, inaasahan ko na kung anong mga susunod na mangyayari pero mas nakakainis at nakakagalit kung iisipin na alam na natin yung mangyayari pero wala pa rin tayong nagagawa sa mga bagay na pinabayaan nalang maging “normal” kahit hindi dapat"

Sunshine,895,3,saiiiiu,,200.0,ltbx,"May mga gray areas din kung saan, natackle sa pelikulang ‘to"
Sunshine,895,4,saiiiiu,,200.0,ltbx,"‘Yung ang hirap na nga maging babae physiologically, tapos ang dami pang outside factors na mas lalong nagpapahirap sa mga kababaihan"

Sunshine,898,1,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"Jennica Garcia, best supporting actress"
Sunshine,898,3,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"Iyaq na naman si ako, naalala ko na naman iyong “Sunshiiine” nya"
Sunshine,898,5,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,Andame kong thoughts sa movie
Sunshine,898,6,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,I can’t
Sunshine,898,7,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"Direk Tonet, kung nababasa mo to, yis galeng tai nah"
Sunshine,898,9,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,ADDENDUM CHAR (i just can’t stop thinking about this movie after like a week) Sunshine is a story of hope entangled in reality’s shadow
Sunshine,898,10,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,I’ve seen this film before—many times
Sunshine,898,11,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"As a student, learning the theoretical aspects of medicine"
Sunshine,898,12,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"As an intern, having actual encounters through interviews with women like Sunshine"
Sunshine,898,13,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"And as a practicing physician, who trained to become an OB-GYN, completing many incomplete miscarriages—induced or not—removing what’s left of what we call products of conception"
Sunshine,898,14,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,Sometimes people call it products of misconception when they’re trying to be funny
Sunshine,898,15,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,This movie didn’t just slap us with the sensitive issue of abortion
Sunshine,898,16,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,It dissected so many layers of issues we need to talk about more often—and pondering them in reality is a mental and moral gymnastics at play
Sunshine,898,17,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"I would love to discuss all of them one by one, but this is a movie review after all, not an essay on the dangers of lacking a solid law to protect our young women from the societal pressures of patriarchy and religion—pressures that push them into life-threatening situations, only to be blamed for doing something they had no real choice about"
Sunshine,898,18,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"In short, fuck the system"
Sunshine,898,19,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,It’s always been a mental gymnastics for me to decide how to approach situations like this
Sunshine,898,20,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,And this movie is telling me exactly how
Sunshine,898,21,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"Jennica Garcia’s character deeply resonated with me—from the way she calls Sunshine’s name so tenderly, to the way she assures her that she’ll be there no matter what"
Sunshine,898,22,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,She reminds us that we all need at least one ate around us who looks after us despite everything
Sunshine,898,23,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"(She literally said, shouted even, BE KIND"
Sunshine,898,24,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,)Another character who lingered in my mind was the 14-year-old teenage mother
Sunshine,898,25,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"Shoutout to the team for dressing her in something colorful—a subtle clue to her identity, only revealed later"
Sunshine,898,26,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"She was one small character representing thousands of teenage mothers, who are becoming younger as the years go by"
Sunshine,898,27,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,She also represented the vulnerable group prone to sexual abuse—the group we have somehow failed to protect
Sunshine,898,28,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"I’d love to dissect each of the characters, but I’ll leave that to you"
Sunshine,898,29,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"Instead, I’ll talk about Sunshine (last na, promise)"
Sunshine,898,30,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal’s portrayal was a masterclass in character acting
Sunshine,898,31,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a fearless dreamer, full of dedication and passion to make that dream come true"
Sunshine,898,32,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,She perseveres despite her family’s circumstances
Sunshine,898,33,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"She’s also a believer, kind, and someone who truly cares"
Sunshine,898,34,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"You see it in the small things—like the way she makes the sign of the cross before her performance, or when she prays fervently in Quiapo Church to ask for guidance or forgiveness on the thing she’s about to do or not to do"
Sunshine,898,35,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,And that’s the beauty of this film—it tells you so many things without saying so much
Sunshine,898,36,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,It urges its viewers to talk about them because these are urgent matters
Sunshine,898,37,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"Maybe we’re still far from legalizing abortion, but this movie isn’t just about that"
Sunshine,898,38,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,It’s telling us we have so many other issues to tackle
Sunshine,898,39,kennypmd,,200.0,ltbx,"In short, we need to protect the Sunshines—or this world will become darker than it already is"
Sunshine,899,1,primhadid,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang oa na naiyak ako feeling ko may kipay din ako
Sunshine,900,1,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,I’m fairly easy to please when it comes to films
Sunshine,900,2,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"Give me a solid plot, a bit of laughter, a love story I can root for, and a strong ensemble, and I’m happy"
Sunshine,900,3,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine delivers all of these, but more importantly, it delivers a quiet, aching kind of truth"
Sunshine,900,4,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"The trailer already sets up the premise: an aspiring Olympic gymnast finds herself two months away from the qualifiers, and pregnant"
Sunshine,900,5,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"What unfolds is not a cautionary tale, but a necessary, grounded story about the private cost of dreams and the impossible decisions women are often forced to make"
Sunshine,900,6,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,This is not a conventional film
Sunshine,900,7,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"At several moments, I found myself crying with Sunshine—because I know there are many women like her"
Sunshine,900,8,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"Women who have been in the same position, or still are"
Sunshine,900,9,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"In a country where laws continue to deny women the right to make choices about their own bodies, Sunshine handles its subject matter with a kind of restraint and realism that does not demand pity, but insists on empathy"
Sunshine,900,10,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"Even if you haven’t experienced what she has, you feel it—because you are human, and perhaps more deeply, because you are a woman"
Sunshine,900,11,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"When the credits rolled, it took a while before anyone in the cinema, including myself to get up and leave"
Sunshine,900,12,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,There was a heaviness in the room
Sunshine,900,13,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"Everyone sat in silence, letting the weight of the film settle in"
Sunshine,900,14,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"Some have described the film as Brocka-esque, and I find that comparison apt"
Sunshine,900,15,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,This is Tonette Jadaone’s most powerful work to date
Sunshine,900,16,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"A film that is necessary, timely, and deserving of all our support"
Sunshine,900,17,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"I hope more people watch Sunshine and understand this side of womanhood, one that is constantly sidelined in the name of morality and ethics"
Sunshine,900,18,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,"There is truth, and power, in giving women the right to choose"
Sunshine,900,19,1800milf,,200.0,ltbx,In letting them take ownership of their own bodies
Sunshine,901,1,doublechin52,,200.0,ltbx,Ang ganda HUHU it's dark and disturbing pero medyo comforting din to know na may nakaka-gets sa anumang choices natin regarding motherhood
Sunshine,902,1,factoryreject,,160.0,ltbx,"I would use this review to praise the movie by tackling an excruciatingly controversial topic in our country and how relatively progressive it is compared to the usual guilt-inducing abortion storylines we get in movies and telenovelas, i really wouldbut instead I'm just gonna use it to express my main takeaway--- jennica garcia was really MOTHERINGive never seen anybody serve that hard as a disheveled mother"

Sunshine,907,1,roughangelo,,200.0,ltbx,"In 50 years, people will talk about Sunshine in the same breath as Lino Brocka’s, Ishmael Bernal’s, and Marilou Diaz-Abaya’s works"
Sunshine,907,2,roughangelo,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s a modern classic - rich in details and symbolism, but sparse and no-nonsense in its storytelling"
Sunshine,907,3,roughangelo,,200.0,ltbx,Perhaps Direk Tonet’s best work to date
Sunshine,907,4,roughangelo,,200.0,ltbx,"Those tight, gray shots of Maris wandering around gritty Quiapo streets must really what it’s like to feel so choked, so condemned by a society that’s unwilling to let a woman maker her own choices"
Sunshine,907,5,roughangelo,,200.0,ltbx,Props also to Jennica Garcia - proof that no role is ever too small for great actors

Sunshine,913,2,selyado,,160.0,ltbx,and I think that's what makes cinema essential
Sunshine,913,3,selyado,,160.0,ltbx,it gives the masses the chance to reflect the times and understand women's struggles to practice their rights in this country
Sunshine,913,4,selyado,,160.0,ltbx,There are so many layers in this one that were properly addressed

Sunshine,915,1,geela,,160.0,ltbx,captures how difficult it is for women to make choices for ourselves and the isolation that follows for sticking to those choices
Sunshine,915,2,geela,,160.0,ltbx,"it's so hard to be a woman in this world, but the film also shows that nobody knows our struggles better than our community"
Sunshine,915,3,geela,,160.0,ltbx,"(not a single reliable man in this film, much like in real life, men should have no opinions about our bodies nor on how we live our lives"

Sunshine,916,2,sinenthusiast,,160.0,ltbx,) pa rin talaga ang best work ni direk haha pero sunshine still shows the kind of filmmaker that she is
Sunshine,916,3,sinenthusiast,,160.0,ltbx,"she's loyal to the stories she wants to tell kahit ibang level ang struggle ng pagproduce ng pelikula sa pilipinas (financial, sociopolitical, etc)not quite sure about that literary device kasi may ambiguity na maaaring matwist to disagree with the film's message"

Sunshine,919,3,vinzeabrera,,200.0,ltbx,"na sa kahit anong sitwasyon na kaharapin ng mga babae partikular sa unwanted pregnancy, marapat lamang na magkaroon sila ng sarili nilang desisyon sa kanilang katawan"
Sunshine,919,4,vinzeabrera,,200.0,ltbx,hindi dapat paingayin ang ideya na nagsasabing kasalanan sa panginoon ang abortion—higit na mas makasalanan ang pagkitil sa pangarap at pamumuhay na gusto ng isang babae

Sunshine,924,10,danelladelacruz,,200.0,ltbx,"wala ring mintis ang casting, walang tapon, lahat tumatak kahit maikli lang ang screen time ng iba"
Sunshine,924,11,danelladelacruz,,200.0,ltbx,"dito rin napatunayan ni maris racal na ibang klaseng aktres siya—binuhay niya talaga si sunshine, hindi si sunshine ang nag-adjust sa kakayahan niya"
Sunshine,924,12,danelladelacruz,,200.0,ltbx,napakahusay at napakagandang pelikula

Sunshine,930,1,tinarchv,,160.0,ltbx,"lowkey miracle something like this could even screen here, an unabashed critique that faces its subject matter head-on in a way i never see in film"
Sunshine,930,2,tinarchv,,160.0,ltbx,"could have done without that plot device, but little to complain about in a movie that paints such a vivid picture of both a callous and desperate Manila"
Sunshine,930,3,tinarchv,,160.0,ltbx,really something else
Sunshine,931,1,aileenraya,,200.0,ltbx,"the scene where she is in the motel and we see the MRT passing by through the window, capturing her inner turmoil: this was good cinema  only a female director could have captured the theme of this film with nuance"

Sunshine,936,1,kahidlaw,,200.0,ltbx,"As a Filipino woman, this movie hits so close to home"
Sunshine,936,2,kahidlaw,,200.0,ltbx,So many moments in this movie that made me realize that I might have been too jaded to comprehend just how common unwanted and taboo pregnancies are
Sunshine,936,3,kahidlaw,,200.0,ltbx,"I feel a sense of pride over the protagonist’s choices, for being “kontra-agos” in a society and industry that perpetuates ownership over a woman’s body and future"
Sunshine,936,4,kahidlaw,,200.0,ltbx,"Maris shined, but Jennica Garcia’s performance as the firm yet nurturing older sister really stuck with me"
Sunshine,936,5,kahidlaw,,200.0,ltbx,"Lastly, this movie brought to light just how much we need progressive reproductive health policies in the country, and just how much we have to fight for it"
Sunshine,936,6,kahidlaw,,200.0,ltbx,"I would have wished for the movie to be straightforward about what happened after Maris’ decision, but there’s a certain charm about it being sort of open-ended"
Sunshine,937,1,kumonista,,200.0,ltbx,CURRENT TIME: 10:39PMCrying so hard after 6hrs interval nung napanood ko Sunshine
Sunshine,937,2,kumonista,,200.0,ltbx,Tang ina ng movie na hindi maalis mata ko sa screen nung habang pinapanood ko to

Sunshine,939,1,makeenetics,,200.0,ltbx,"There’s a quiet power in Sunshine, one that doesn’t shout its message but lets it settle in your bones"
Sunshine,939,2,makeenetics,,200.0,ltbx,"This film is many things: a coming-of-age story, a critique of a broken system, a glimpse into the intimate pain of being a girl in a country where your choices are limited before you’re even allowed to make them"
Sunshine,939,3,makeenetics,,200.0,ltbx,"It focuses on the deeply human moments of fear, frustration, and quiet strength as Sunshine navigates an impossible decision in a society that offers her no safe options"
Sunshine,939,4,makeenetics,,200.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal delivers her best performance yet, as there’s a stillness to it that makes it all the more heartbreaking"
Sunshine,939,5,makeenetics,,200.0,ltbx,"What I really loved is how it doesn’t feel like it’s trying to explain itself and it just presents the reality where religion, poverty, and patriarchy intersect in deeply personal ways"
Sunshine,939,6,makeenetics,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s a whole world closing in on a girl who’s just trying to breathe, fighting for her freedom to choose and a right to dream"
Sunshine,939,7,makeenetics,,200.0,ltbx,Seen at SM City Dasmariñas
Sunshine,940,1,ahnriaa,,,ltbx,…watching this felt like a punch in the gut
Sunshine,940,3,ahnriaa,,,ltbx,"every minute this movie moved forward, I would recall the past and consider myself lucky"
Sunshine,940,4,ahnriaa,,,ltbx,"although it was a different experience, I can’t deny I felt familiarity within sunshine’s cries"
Sunshine,940,5,ahnriaa,,,ltbx,It hurt so much
Sunshine,940,6,ahnriaa,,,ltbx,such an important movie to see
Sunshine,940,7,ahnriaa,,,ltbx,"the grasp of never, rarely, sometimes, always, the hardships when it comes to firm decisions, the importance of sex education, the fight of women… I’m here for sunshine"
Sunshine,940,8,ahnriaa,,,ltbx,I felt so seen and comforted

Sunshine,942,1,flaeiou,,160.0,ltbx,"everyone acted the fuck out in it, especially Maris Racal"
Sunshine,942,2,flaeiou,,160.0,ltbx,"covers A LOT of issues; inaccessibility, healthcare, accountability, and overall the need for support that women like Sunshine and her friend should've had"
Sunshine,942,3,flaeiou,,160.0,ltbx,i also love how the city was filmed
Sunshine,942,4,flaeiou,,160.0,ltbx,watched this in an almost-packed theatre (with only a few of the front row seats left unoccupied) and the reactions from what the doctors said and the age of Sunshine's friend was audible as hell
Sunshine,942,5,flaeiou,,160.0,ltbx,"unfortunately, situations like those might be common in the country"
Sunshine,942,6,flaeiou,,160.0,ltbx,and the government isn't doing shit for these women
Sunshine,942,7,flaeiou,,160.0,ltbx,"if dili man gani maka-provide ang government sa sakto nga support, give these women at least an option for safe and legal abortion"
Sunshine,943,1,toweng,,120.0,ltbx,ang maganda dito lahat ng babae sa buhay niya mahal siya at suportado siya
Sunshine,944,1,tresuhh,,200.0,ltbx,soooo powerful and eye-opener itong movie na ito
Sunshine,944,2,tresuhh,,200.0,ltbx,Talagang napakita nito ang realidad na hindi masyado natutuunan ng pansin sa ating bansa when it comes to sex education and/or practicing safe sex in a very religious environment
Sunshine,944,3,tresuhh,,200.0,ltbx,"Grabe ang effect lalo na sa mga babae, and how the women are always considered in the wrong and are always left alone"
Sunshine,944,4,tresuhh,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang galing mo, Maris"
Sunshine,945,1,ejmv,,,ltbx,effective birth control
Sunshine,946,1,villamonteshem,,200.0,ltbx,It’s a revelation to see how Jadaone’s point of view has evolved over the years through her filmography
Sunshine,946,2,villamonteshem,,200.0,ltbx,"From Six Degrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay to Alone/Together, from Fan Girl to Sunshine, she consistently shows us what it means to be a woman in our patriarchal society"
Sunshine,946,3,villamonteshem,,200.0,ltbx,"As a homosexual queer man, I don’t know what it feels like to be a woman sa lipunang ginagalawan natin—but this film gave me a glimpse of just how difficult it is"
Sunshine,946,4,villamonteshem,,200.0,ltbx,"Plus, I always love the ending"
Sunshine,946,5,villamonteshem,,200.0,ltbx,"If this isn’t cinema, I don’t know what is"
Sunshine,946,6,villamonteshem,,200.0,ltbx,"When Annika Co said, “‘Yung pangarap ko, kung anong pangarap n’ya,”I felt that"

Sunshine,955,2,heartstied,,180.0,ltbx,"abot sa puntong sinubukan kong bawasan ang volume (tinatakpan ang isang tenga sa sinehan) kada may dumadaang tren sa inn na tinuluyan ni Sunshine, halos maamoy ko ang mga kalsadang kanyang binabaybay, at nanindig ang mga bahalibo ko sa mga salitang: ""Gets ko na"
Sunshine,955,3,heartstied,,180.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,955,4,heartstied,,180.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,956,1,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine listens
Sunshine,956,2,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"It listens to the silence of shame, the dissonance of faith, and the quiet, aching resolve of a girl who simply wants to choose"
Sunshine,956,3,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s the kind of film that our deeply Catholic country isn’t ready for, but desperately needs"
Sunshine,956,4,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,That it’s showing in nationwide cinemas—not just tucked in the corners of a progressive film festival—feels like a small act of rebellion in itself
Sunshine,956,5,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"Like Eliza Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, a film I often return to when thinking about stories of quiet resistance, Sunshine unfolds with restraint and tenderness, never sensationalizing what is already unbearable"
Sunshine,956,6,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"But where Hittman’s film relies on cold urban detachment, Jadaone’s world breathes with a Filipino kind of chaos: loud horns, dim chapels, vendors selling herbal “solutions” beside icons of the Virgin Mary"
Sunshine,956,7,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,It’s all there
Sunshine,956,8,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"The hypocrisy, the hush-hush remedies, the weight of sin pressed upon young women’s shoulders before they even understand the language of their own bodies"
Sunshine,956,9,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is astonishing
Sunshine,956,10,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"She carries the film with a performance so grounded, so lived-in, that she often feels less like a character and more like someone we know"
Sunshine,956,11,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,A friend
Sunshine,956,12,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,A cousin
Sunshine,956,13,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"A girl on the jeep beside us, clutching a bag, hiding her fear behind a tight grip and a brave face"
Sunshine,956,14,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"Her Sunshine is not loud, but she is brave"
Sunshine,956,15,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"And perhaps bravery today looks exactly like this: choosing to take control of your life, even when the world tries to stop you"
Sunshine,956,16,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"Jadaone’s direction is both intimate and distant, borrowing from the gaze of Brocka but infused with a distinctly feminine grief"
Sunshine,956,17,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"We see Sunshine from behind glass, from across alleys, as if we too are complicit in watching but not speaking up"
Sunshine,956,18,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"Yet the film never loses its tenderness, even in its political anger"
Sunshine,956,19,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine is not an easy watch
Sunshine,956,20,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,But it is essential
Sunshine,956,21,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"In a country where reproductive rights are still cloaked in rosaries and stigma, this film asks us not just to look, but to sit, to stay, to listen"
Sunshine,956,22,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,It doesn’t beg for permission
Sunshine,956,23,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,It asserts presence
Sunshine,956,24,marckryancidro,,180.0,ltbx,"And sometimes, in a nation deafened by doctrine, that’s more than enough"
Sunshine,957,1,new_romantics12,,180.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,957,2,new_romantics12,,180.0,ltbx,It’s an eye opening movie to the reality that some Filipino women go through this

Sunshine,962,2,pauieeee,,200.0,ltbx,"Napaka ganda ng pelikulang ito ang dami mong marerealize habang pinapanood mo sya, kung gaano kabulok ang sistema ng bansa natin pag dating sa healthcare at kung gaano kahirap maging babae sa lipunang ito"

Sunshine,965,3,adrlcr,,200.0,ltbx,kailangan natin ng ganitong klase ng pelikula sa panahon ngayon
Sunshine,965,4,adrlcr,,200.0,ltbx,"something that would spark conversation and action in the near future, about a reality that bites us while we remain blinded by our conservatism"
Sunshine,966,1,winterfifteen,,200.0,ltbx,watched at the theaters
Sunshine,967,1,lintruly,,180.0,ltbx,"gets na gets kita, sunshine"
Sunshine,968,1,holdnogrudge,,180.0,ltbx,"i’ve already seen so many pro-choice films that greatly explore the difficulties of going through an abortion (never rarely something always, happening, etc) but i must say that it feels really different to watch a film like it made in your country"
Sunshine,968,2,holdnogrudge,,180.0,ltbx,"because in the pro-choice films i’ve watched before, they’re usually either set in the old times where abortion was still illegal in their countries or set in a modern setting whereas the female lead needs to travel in other places/states to undergo abortion legally… but in sunshine, it’s set in the modern times or the living conditions of filipino people right now yet there’s still no place to go where abortion is accepted… which speaks a lot about the real life situation for women in our country"
Sunshine,968,3,holdnogrudge,,180.0,ltbx,women anywhere have to go through a lot to apply *the choice* that they’ve decided on
Sunshine,968,4,holdnogrudge,,180.0,ltbx,"however, it is much much worse in the philippines as it’s a complete taboo and sometimes it feels like we’ll never see in our lifetime where abortion will finally be legal in the country…… so, it truly is a remarkable feat that we got a pro-choice filipino film now"
Sunshine,968,5,holdnogrudge,,180.0,ltbx,"not only that because it’s directed by one of the most well-known directors, released nationwide, and promoted in mainstream shows and platforms"
Sunshine,968,6,holdnogrudge,,180.0,ltbx,this film shedded some light to everyone and it was very much needed for every filipino woman out there
Sunshine,968,7,holdnogrudge,,180.0,ltbx,"thank you direk antoinette, maris racal, and all the amazing women here for sharing the story of sunshine"
Sunshine,969,1,xianoquendo,,160.0,ltbx,"Unflinching and soo affront—almost to a fault, but perhaps that's exactly what's needed for the Filipino audience"
Sunshine,969,2,xianoquendo,,160.0,ltbx,"Still torn with how the film physicalized the unborn, especially that the film positions itself as pro-choice"
Sunshine,969,3,xianoquendo,,160.0,ltbx,"But surely, Jadaone delivers with heart, soul and, crucially, angst"
Sunshine,969,4,xianoquendo,,160.0,ltbx,"Racal carries the film, the plight and everything else in between"
Sunshine,969,5,xianoquendo,,160.0,ltbx,Still a much-needed film
Sunshine,970,1,lawelleliet,,200.0,ltbx,What a poignant performance by Maris Racal
Sunshine,970,2,lawelleliet,,200.0,ltbx,Truly one of the best in her generation
Sunshine,971,1,photoartbymm,,180.0,ltbx,"""Sunshine"" is Direk Tonet's best film to date, especially with how raw and brave this is"
Sunshine,971,2,photoartbymm,,180.0,ltbx,She captured the society’s biggest aches perfectly
Sunshine,971,3,photoartbymm,,180.0,ltbx,Gets ko na kung bakit deserving itong manalo ng awards at ipakita internationally
Sunshine,971,4,photoartbymm,,180.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal brings sunshine with her strong and raw performance as the titular character, probably her most defining role yet"
Sunshine,971,5,photoartbymm,,180.0,ltbx,"Kitang-kita at damang-dama dito ang kanyang saya, galit, at hirap na kanyang pinagdadaanan"
Sunshine,972,1,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"This film is, at its core, a well-intentioned and emotionally resonant film"
Sunshine,972,2,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"It tackles difficult subject matter with sincerity, and for the most part, it does so with grace"
Sunshine,972,3,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"However, I found that the inclusion of fantastical or imaginary elements occasionally detracted from the weight of its core issues"
Sunshine,972,4,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"While I understand the metaphorical ambition behind these stylistic choices as well as their function in softening the emotional blows with humor or levity, I believe the film is at its most powerful when it forgoes embellishment and leans fully into the raw intensity of its subject matter"
Sunshine,972,5,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"In those moments, when it embraces the chaos, the pain, and the emotional urgency it really becomes something far more affecting and memorable, allowing the simplicity it strives for to emerge, though it’s often overshadowed"
Sunshine,972,6,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"At times, the dialogue veers into overtly inspirational or didactic terrain, feeling more like affirmations meant to uplift than naturalistic exchanges between characters"
Sunshine,972,7,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"It’s clear that the film doesn’t only aim to tell a story, it wants to educate, to empower, to stir social consciousness"
Sunshine,972,8,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"Yet in doing so, it sometimes edges closer to the tone of an educational TV movie than a fully realized work of cinema"
Sunshine,972,9,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"That’s not a critique of its moral imperative, it’s a film that should be shown in schools but rather an observation about its limitations as a piece of narrative storytelling"
Sunshine,972,10,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,The emotional and ideological weight it seeks to carry isn’t always supported by the nuance or complexity that cinematic storytelling demands
Sunshine,972,11,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,What grounds the film and gives it its most enduring power is its emotional core
Sunshine,972,12,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal delivers a performance of quiet strength and vulnerability, anchoring the film with remarkable consistency"
Sunshine,972,13,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,Especially compelling is the subplot involving Rhed Bustamante’s character
Sunshine,972,14,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"Without revealing too much, her arc resonated with me more deeply than the central storyline"
Sunshine,972,15,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"It was heartbreakingly authentic, subtle, restrained, and profoundly human"
Sunshine,972,16,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"In that thread, the film touches something honest and unflinching"
Sunshine,972,17,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"I also admired Antoinette Jadaone’s formal restraint in certain key scenes, particularly her choice to mute the sound"
Sunshine,972,18,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"In a film so concerned with voice and expression, those pockets of silence carried tremendous weight"
Sunshine,972,19,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"They allowed the viewer a moment of stillness, a space for reflection and imbued the film with a haunting quietude that deepened the emotional stakes"
Sunshine,972,20,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"That said, the film’s message doesn’t always land with clarity"
Sunshine,972,21,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"After a pivotal hospital scene, I overheard two audience members blame the protagonist for her choices, siding with the doctor who confronts her"
Sunshine,972,22,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"That reaction, while anecdotal, reveals a significant shortcoming: the narrative may not have sufficiently challenged ingrained prejudices or prompted the kind of empathy it aspired to cultivate"
Sunshine,972,23,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"It bravely addresses urgent topics- reproductive rights, bodily autonomy, the realities of being a young woman navigating unjust systems but the film doesn’t always sharpen these into a coherent or persuasive argument"
Sunshine,972,24,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"In trying to reach everyone, it occasionally loses the sharpness needed to truly confront"
Sunshine,972,25,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"Still, “Sunshine” is a valuable film, one with earnestness, compassion, and purpose"
Sunshine,972,26,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"Its flaws are born of ambition: the desire to inspire, to uplift, and to inform all at once"
Sunshine,972,27,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,But perhaps empowerment doesn’t always need to be accompanied by joy
Sunshine,972,28,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"Sometimes, it is in the unvarnished confrontation of pain without fantasy, without consolation that we discover our deepest strength"
Sunshine,972,29,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"I don’t mean to suggest the film ought to have ended in despair, but rather that its final act, which shifts into metaphor and closes with a success story, might have benefitted from something more grounded, more unresolved or ambiguous"
Sunshine,972,30,domfr_nc,,100.0,ltbx,"Real life rarely provides a clean arc, and in a film so rooted in truth, the ending felt almost too easy, too neat"

Sunshine,980,1,kerwinwepee,,180.0,ltbx,A random review ***it may contain spoilers*** I was in awe after seeing the first 10mins or more of this film
Sunshine,980,2,kerwinwepee,,180.0,ltbx,"How perfectly shot, how each Sunshine’s flow, movement and forms were perfectly calculated in graceful manner, it may translate to her goals as a national athlete"
Sunshine,980,3,kerwinwepee,,180.0,ltbx,"I like the raw and realistic on the situation where she had an idea if she might be pregnant, from the varsity clinic, how she react, getting a pregnancy kit to a local pharmacy, how she search online on how to get rid or literally “mawala sa sarili” in the moment she found out, i may say if i were in that age I probably be acting the same thing Sunshine did"
Sunshine,980,4,kerwinwepee,,180.0,ltbx,"It very direct, light and eye opening to different perspectives in abortion, from the pro life views, to views of men who is not ready fathered or accept responsibilities, to the views of her friends and colleagues/societal norms, in the perspectives of her coach and to her lifelong dream, to the views of some unwanted pregnant women who dealt from complicated situations, to view of her own family, for Sunshine and to her unborn child"
Sunshine,980,5,kerwinwepee,,180.0,ltbx,"We all have out own biases when it comes to this topic; abortion but at the end it still in the capacity of the woman, the beholder to take choice on what choices she want to take… I was too happy how her family especially her eldest sister Geleen support Sunshine in what decision she may lead to"
Sunshine,980,6,kerwinwepee,,180.0,ltbx,"Its a gemIn silver screen seeing that moment, that scene that is so comforting, q moment that most of us longing in a situation like this"
Sunshine,980,7,kerwinwepee,,180.0,ltbx,It’s not about taking responsibilities but owning and accepting mistakes and making peace to yourself
Sunshine,980,8,kerwinwepee,,180.0,ltbx,"We know what is good and what's right but in the end of the day we are the not the right one to decide for someone else fate and choices especially we are not in that situation, where they are coming from"

Sunshine,982,4,kit_tards,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi ito pelikulang magpapagaan ng loob mo; ito ang pelikulang magbubukas ng mata mo sa bigat ng mga pasaning hindi nila pinili, pero kailangan nilang dalhin"
Sunshine,982,5,kit_tards,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi natakot ang pelikula ipakita ang buong karanasan—kasama ang kahihiyan, sakit, panghuhusga, at mga desisyong hindi madaling tanggapin"
Sunshine,982,6,kit_tards,,200.0,ltbx,"pero higit sa lahat, ipinakita nito ang kapangyarihan ng babae na pumili para sa sarili, kahit hindi siya maintindihan ng iba"
Sunshine,982,7,kit_tards,,200.0,ltbx,sunshine ay hindi lang kwento ng isang tao—isa itong sulyap sa katotohanang matagal nang sinisigaw pero paulit-ulit na binabaliwala

Sunshine,991,2,arkeives,,180.0,ltbx,that was a conscious and bold choice for the film
Sunshine,991,3,arkeives,,180.0,ltbx,"kasi ang mindset ng mga tao, okay lang ang abortion kapag nabuntis ang babae dahil sa rape"
Sunshine,991,4,arkeives,,180.0,ltbx,"pero malinaw ang gustong ipa-realize satin ng pelikula, na si menggay ka man o si sunshine, na-rape ka man o hindi, may option at access ka dapat sa safe abortion"

Sunshine,991,6,arkeives,,180.0,ltbx,dapat i-decriminalize ang abortion sa pilipinas and discussions about it must be more about the social reality than morality
Sunshine,991,7,arkeives,,180.0,ltbx,"naalala ko ang statement noon ng gabriela women’s party:“Whether we see abortion as a moral decision or not, we cannot turn a blind eye to the reality that poor women resort to unsafe abortion as they do not have the resources to raise a child amid the economic crisis, aside from the alarming cases of pregnancies arising from rape"

Sunshine,994,31,itsacslife,,200.0,ltbx,ganda rin talaga ng mga bond nya sa actresses nya for them to spill this hard
Sunshine,994,32,itsacslife,,200.0,ltbx,"this film is not glorifying abortion; it glorifies the women’s choices, because their body, their choice"
Sunshine,994,33,itsacslife,,200.0,ltbx,"pinakita ang struggle, the weighing in, and most importantly, the strength on making a firm stand for yourself"
Sunshine,995,1,talamits,,200.0,ltbx,What I truly admired about this film is how Sunshine stayed committed to her decision from the very beginning
Sunshine,995,2,talamits,,200.0,ltbx,"There are moments where you think she might waver, that she might choose differently, but she doesn’t"
Sunshine,995,3,talamits,,200.0,ltbx,And I’m so glad direk Tonet stayed firm in writing it that way
Sunshine,995,4,talamits,,200.0,ltbx,"As a Filipino film that bravely tackles the topic of abortion (a subject still considered taboo in our country), I really appreciated the way Sunshine and Mary Grace’s stories were presented"

Sunshine,998,3,domrodriguez,,140.0,ltbx,Bit off at some parts especially at how the main kid characters were used but it somehow made sense at the end
Sunshine,998,4,domrodriguez,,140.0,ltbx,"Jennica Garcia plays well significant portions of the film, so raw and honest in her depiction"
Sunshine,998,5,domrodriguez,,140.0,ltbx,"When i think about it, this speaks volumes about women’s health and the longstanding problem on who makes a choice in their bodies, but ultimately it’s about striving for your dreams in a world that otherwise allows you to reach them, to find sunshine amid the storm"
Sunshine,998,6,domrodriguez,,140.0,ltbx,So real and so right in your face
Sunshine,999,1,paulomiguelgab,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a film that proves time and time again that art matters
Sunshine,999,2,paulomiguelgab,,200.0,ltbx,This is unrelated to the film but Ethan Hawke best explains it when he said that human art is a sustenance that lets us make sense of the things that we have no understanding of
Sunshine,999,3,paulomiguelgab,,200.0,ltbx,"And Sunshine exceeds in that very criteria because of how delicate the plot is yet it puts so much faith on its viewers by challenging them into understanding the struggles explored in the film, and it cleverly succeeds in such a way that does not make it intrusive"
Sunshine,999,4,paulomiguelgab,,200.0,ltbx,The viewer is allowed to draw their own opinions without the film ever forcing them to side with it
Sunshine,999,5,paulomiguelgab,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is Antoinette Jadaone's magnum opus, and the film further shines as Maris Racal delivers a performance of a lifetime"
Sunshine,999,6,paulomiguelgab,,200.0,ltbx,"I cannot stress enough how important this film is to the Philippines, and how it is a step forward to everything it stands for"

Sunshine,1005,2,anotherwxrld,,180.0,ltbx,"To be honest, Sunshine may follow the story of a gymnast, but it's really about the quiet, impossible contortions many women are forced to make just to keep going—physically, emotionally, morally"
Sunshine,1005,3,anotherwxrld,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s about the weight of carrying something you didn’t choose, in a world that offers you no real way out"
Sunshine,1005,4,anotherwxrld,,180.0,ltbx,It asks the kind of questions that linger long after the credits roll: How do you hold on to your dreams when your body no longer feels like your own
Sunshine,1005,5,anotherwxrld,,180.0,ltbx,"How do you choose anything at all when every choice comes with shame, fear, or punishment"
Sunshine,1005,6,anotherwxrld,,180.0,ltbx,"In a country where abortion is completely outlawed—even in cases of rape or danger to the mother—and where women are taught to suffer silently for the sake of appearances or faith, Sunshine hits differently"
Sunshine,1005,7,anotherwxrld,,180.0,ltbx,It doesn't shout
Sunshine,1005,8,anotherwxrld,,180.0,ltbx,It doesn't try to shock
Sunshine,1005,9,anotherwxrld,,180.0,ltbx,"It simply tells the truth as it is lived: with quiet pain, with small acts of defiance, and with the kind of strength that often goes unnoticed"

Sunshine,1006,2,happikuy,,180.0,ltbx,"upon watching, i just noticed such apparent layers: desperation, love, pain, and so frustratingly impossible choices"
Sunshine,1006,3,happikuy,,180.0,ltbx,and such never fit neatly into laws written without compassion
Sunshine,1006,4,happikuy,,180.0,ltbx,"im really just so glad that they made a film about care, about womens autonomy, and about the dignity of choosing what to do with ones body, especially in a country like ours, where so many are denied that choice, where morality is frustratingly weaponized and healthcare is gatekept"
Sunshine,1006,5,happikuy,,180.0,ltbx,im really hoping this sparks more than the praise
Sunshine,1006,6,happikuy,,180.0,ltbx,"rage, conversation, and ofc solidarity"

Sunshine,1011,3,emmanhoooman,,120.0,ltbx,"While for the movie, I’d say that it felt short in writing the sequence because I wish that it centers on sunshine because her suffering was already heavy and to insert that teenage pregnancy (another oppressed in the story) where she lowkey stand as a revenger gave relief but not to her story"

Sunshine,1027,1,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,To hell with these topics being taboo in the Philippines - Jadaone says LET’S TALK ABOUT IT and this film did that
Sunshine,1027,2,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,Definitely a film that will start conversations and something that will linger in thought even hours after watching it
Sunshine,1027,3,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,"This film - for starters, was really well-shot and well-edited"
Sunshine,1027,4,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,That was my first takeaway
Sunshine,1027,5,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,"Second, well-scored"
Sunshine,1027,6,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,And when that credits rolled and I saw that Rico Blanco did it
Sunshine,1027,7,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,The dots were connecting and with Maris Racal as the protagonist
Sunshine,1027,8,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,Wow that was definitely personal maybe that’s why it was done so good
Sunshine,1027,9,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,"As a man, who actually didn’t know anything about this topic - THIS WAS EYE-OPENING EDUCATIONAL FOR ME"
Sunshine,1027,10,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,"I didn’t know how self-abortion works, I didn’t know how much it cost, I didn’t know what it looks like, I didn’t know how treatment is done after, I didn’t even know that doctors refused service for this"
Sunshine,1027,11,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,Imagine my fuming anger when that scene happened
Sunshine,1027,12,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,"For me, this was information overload"
Sunshine,1027,13,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,I appreciate how this was not Maris Racal anymore
Sunshine,1027,14,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,This was Sunshine
Sunshine,1027,15,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine was a real person
Sunshine,1027,16,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,"It borderline made me forget that this was a film, it felt like reenactment of something, or maybe unintentionally, it was"
Sunshine,1027,17,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,"Also, scriptwriting and editing masterclass - How you make people laugh with subtle punchlines with great timing, but not cutting off the momentum and emotion you feel for the scene, and also not lightening off the topic at hand"
Sunshine,1027,18,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,The way that that were balanced
Sunshine,1027,19,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,"Hats off to Jadaone and the editor, Ben Tolentino (THE GOAT)Performances were topnotch as well"
Sunshine,1027,20,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,"I love that you feel the cast, from lead to support, not one-upping each other"
Sunshine,1027,21,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,You felt them read the script and read the room and operate on that energy
Sunshine,1027,22,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,They were supporting each others’ performances and maybe that’s why it became more effective as a script
Sunshine,1027,23,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,The execution was phenomenal
Sunshine,1027,24,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,"Personally, I would have loved some bit more fleshing out by the third act, because I feel like the un-accustomed or laymen movie audience may not get it immediately with the execution of it and it would’ve been better with the topic at hand to be spoonfed a bit more (but not too much)"
Sunshine,1027,25,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,But yeah this is more of a personal nitpick at this point
Sunshine,1027,26,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,Either way - BEAUTIFUL FILM
Sunshine,1027,27,kuyaed,,180.0,ltbx,Is this my favorite Jadaone

Sunshine,1040,1,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Yesterday, I stumbled upon a Twitter post pointing out parallelisms between Jadaone's Sunshine and Brocka's Insiang with how both films' main characters, in at least one scene, were framed behind bars, mirroring their metaphorical imprisonment within gendered norms of their respective social milieus"
Sunshine,1040,2,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Indeed, although almost 50 years have passed between the two films, it's an unfortunate reality that women's rights in the Philippines still have a long way to go, with conservative Catholic values hindering its advancement"
Sunshine,1040,3,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Both Jadaone and Brocka present us with their titular characters' fractured psyches, trying everything within their limited power to achieve some kind of self-emancipation"
Sunshine,1040,4,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Another Twitter post, however, posits that while Jadaone echoes Brocka in some ways, she ultimately diverges from him by virtue of her ""woman's instinct"" that also augments her narratives with an ""added layer"
Sunshine,1040,5,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,""" Obvious gender essentialism and identity politics aside, this is a sentiment that I'm keen on interrogating: what does it actually mean to have a female directorial sensibility, particularly in the vein of Antoinette Jadaone"
Sunshine,1040,6,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"An easy answer would be to look at the central conflict of Sunshine, that is, unwanted pregnancy, and that Jadaone opts for a female teenager as its main focalizer"
Sunshine,1040,7,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"I'm pointing this out because trans men and intersex people can also get pregnant hence a pregnancy plot point would not inherently be women-specific (although there would surely be many overlaps), so it's Jadaone's directorial decision to create a female protagonist that imbues the film with intricacies of the female experience---how proceeding with motherhood would be career suicide for an athlete aiming for the Olympics, how Sunshine is constantly berated by self-righteous people she encounters, how society itself was built against female self-determination, and despite all these, how Sunshine finds small pockets of refuge in other women---a friend, a mentor, an inn receptionist, a doctor, an abused prepubescent, a sister---who are empathetic enough to understand her pain and conviction, and to whom she's equally compelled to reciprocate kindness whenever the situation permits"
Sunshine,1040,8,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Further, Jadaone digs deeper and finds the Catholic religious institution, itself a remnant of feudalism, as an underlying hegemonic force against women empowerment, so culturally embedded in Philippine society that Sunshine finds it wherever she goes, be it in the drugstore, in the hospital, in the university, in the sport that she loves, even in the man who got her pregnant"
Sunshine,1040,9,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, here is also where Jadaone's supposed female sensibility loses steam: religious guilt is so ubiquitous that even she is not aware that it limits her perspective, that instead of finding multiple angles of inquiry she instead chooses to hammer in the same anti-religious (therefore anti-patriarchal) talking point over and over and over again, even to the point of physicalizing the unborn children, a weirdly pro-life creative decision in a film that self-categorizes as pro-choice"
Sunshine,1040,10,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Heck, the film just assumes that the audience already knows about the economic facets of being a Filipino athlete so it makes no effort in examining it, nor is it concerned with how Sunshine and her family earn their money (nobody seems to be working"
Sunshine,1040,12,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"No, those aren't important; just focus on the fact that Sunshine is a woman and that she's oppressed because of it"
Sunshine,1040,13,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"""Drown out the noise,"" her coach tells her, but is it really necessary to drown it out if the noise is as repetitively monotonous (albeit still imminently threatening) as Jadaone presented it"
Sunshine,1040,14,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"My argument is that uncritical admiration for ""female sensibility"" is as dangerous as the patriarchy it contends with, and that it's the same liberal narrow-sightedness that applauds Jadaone's bravery for tackling taboo gender topics and turns a blind eye to her cowardice in heeding the pro-Palestine boycott of the Berlinale film festival in the same breath; what's the point of female sensibility if it is devoid of anti-fascist solidarity"
Sunshine,1040,15,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"Perhaps Sunshine is actually a self-surrogate for the lengths Jadaone is willing to go through in pursuit of her career, and we're all just supposed to root for her because it's great that Philippine cinema is acknowledged and praised internationally, everything else be damned"
Sunshine,1040,16,gmcajayon,,120.0,ltbx,"And maybe I'm expecting too much from Jadaone, that I should just accept that her films are self-contained texts that will never reach the same kind of radicalism and depth as Brocka's (which is admittedly a high standard to reach), but deep inside I want to believe that she's capable of bolder, stronger filmic statements"

Sunshine,1056,1,sputniklover,,180.0,ltbx,"Set against the relentless rhythm of Manila, the film captures how the world keeps moving—often without mercy—especially for those society has pushed to the margins"
Sunshine,1056,2,sputniklover,,180.0,ltbx,"Yet, in the middle of all the noise and indifference, it reminds us that even the smallest act of empathy can mean everything to someone, not only for Sunshines out there but also to Mary Graces alike"

Sunshine,1058,1,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a charming film
Sunshine,1058,2,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,"Beautifully directed, well-acted, and elevated by a great score and gorgeous cinematography (ang ganda ng Maynila kahit gritty)"
Sunshine,1058,3,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,"The pacing is tight and purposeful (walang fillers, or at least I didn't feel it), and honestly, I loved every minute of it"
Sunshine,1058,4,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,It’s the best Filipino film I’ve seen this year
Sunshine,1058,5,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,What stood out most was how it tackled the lack of body autonomy that women face in this country
Sunshine,1058,6,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,"We reaaaalllyyy need a legal avenue for abortion, and I hope this film helps spark that conversation"

Sunshine,1058,8,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,I also liked that it showcased the real Manila without falling into poverty porn (great shots of Quiapo)
Sunshine,1058,9,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,"It celebrated female friendships and relationships without centering men, and it showed the complexities of family without resorting to toxic tropes(supportive ate yes"

Sunshine,1058,11,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,I loved the inclusion of sports too; we definitely need more athlete-centered films
Sunshine,1058,12,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,"Pero, at the heart of it all is a strong, well-developed main character — flawed, impulsive, but deeply likeable and easy to root for (even during her chaotic, violent outbursts"

Sunshine,1058,17,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,"Grabe, I really felt her frustration, and by the end, I felt her relief too"
Sunshine,1058,18,dobby_rae,,200.0,ltbx,"I don’t usually write movie reviews, but this film was so phenomenaaaaal I couldn’t help but put my thoughts into words"

Sunshine,1064,7,coolestiny,,200.0,ltbx,Malinaw ang direksyong binigay ni Direk Tonet para sa tinahak na journey ni Sunshine
Sunshine,1064,8,coolestiny,,200.0,ltbx,"Talagang sinubok lahat ng karakter, at binigyang hustisya naman ito ng lahat ng aktres at aktor— lalo na si Maris Racal"

Sunshine,1065,2,edrickins,,200.0,ltbx,First I wanna say that the cinematography is superb
Sunshine,1065,3,edrickins,,200.0,ltbx,The shots especially of Sunshine as she traverses the streets of Manila are fantastically immersive
Sunshine,1065,4,edrickins,,200.0,ltbx,Ang ganda ng musical score
Sunshine,1065,5,edrickins,,200.0,ltbx,Favorite scenes: Motel scene and yung 13 years old scenes x Ariana up to the hospital scene
Sunshine,1065,6,edrickins,,200.0,ltbx,Ramdam ko yung pagiging helpless ni Sunshine
Sunshine,1065,8,edrickins,,200.0,ltbx,Grabe nakakaalog ng pagkatao
Sunshine,1065,9,edrickins,,200.0,ltbx,The most powerful scene was when she was practicing in solitude - Gets ko na
Sunshine,1065,10,edrickins,,200.0,ltbx,Excellent storytelling - eto ang pantapat sa Hollywood films talaga
Sunshine,1065,11,edrickins,,200.0,ltbx,"Your body, your choice"
Sunshine,1066,1,md_57,,200.0,ltbx,So moved by this film not just by the story itself but also by how it was told---so much so that it snapped me out of a personal slump
Sunshine,1066,2,md_57,,200.0,ltbx,"It depicted the most raw parts of Manila life without making it feel like poverty porn, tackled sensitive issues without just adding it for shock value, and ultimately gave more depth to the main character's dilemma---plights that women (especially in the third world) struggle with daily"
Sunshine,1066,3,md_57,,200.0,ltbx,"Needless to say, the performances and soundtrack really brought the story to life in a way that will leave you thinking about the film for a while"
Sunshine,1066,4,md_57,,200.0,ltbx,"Beautiful, beautiful"
Sunshine,1067,1,wowowie,,180.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is brilliant

Sunshine,1068,5,bambizaballegue,,180.0,ltbx,i was literally crying na para bang may matres ako
Sunshine,1069,1,junmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"Usually, when a film claims to challenge a societal norm, it ends up being either too preachy or barely scratching the surface"
Sunshine,1069,2,junmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"But sometimes, a film like Sunshine comes along and delivers on its promise—clear, direct, and most importantly, brave"
Sunshine,1069,3,junmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"Not only is this Jadaone’s best film to date, but it’s also her most important"
Sunshine,1069,4,junmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s a feminist masterclass in storytelling, evident in how every significant character in the film that supports Sunshine is a woman"
Sunshine,1069,5,junmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"And to top it all off, the ending was written to give the character what she truly deserves—even if the harsh realities of our country don't always allow a woman to have that"
Sunshine,1069,6,junmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"Even the casting was perfect and clearly intentional—from Maris’s embodiment of Sunshine to Elijah’s portrayal of the privileged Miggy (perfect choice of name, by the way)"
Sunshine,1069,7,junmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,Setting the story against the raw backdrop of Manila adds just the right weight to the film’s intention
Sunshine,1069,8,junmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,Minsan lang dumating ang isang pelikulang pwedeng magbukas ng mata ng mas marami pang tao
Sunshine,1069,9,junmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,Sana dumating ang araw na hindi na mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas
Sunshine,1069,10,junmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,Sana maintindihan ng kung sino man ang nasa taas
Sunshine,1069,11,junmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"Sana masabi nilang, “Gets ko na"
Sunshine,1070,2,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,]Ang pinakapaborito kong detalye sa movie nato ay ang fact na “wala lang ang pera sa buhay ni Miggy”
Sunshine,1070,3,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,Binasag ni Sunshine ang windshield ng kotse nya
Sunshine,1070,4,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,"No problem, sa sunod na shot with the car, intentionally mag-ga-glide ang shot sa harap at makikitang napalitan na ang windshield at wala nang confrontation about it"
Sunshine,1070,5,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,It is just fixed
Sunshine,1070,6,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,Kailangan ni Sunshine ng pera para magpalaglag ng bata
Sunshine,1070,7,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,"Walang intro-intro, dumukot sa bulsa si Miggy, binigyan nya si Sunshine ng 5k"
Sunshine,1070,8,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,5000 pesos
Sunshine,1070,9,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,Nalaman ng tatay ni Miggy na nakabuntis sya

Sunshine,1070,18,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,I am a mark for this film
Sunshine,1070,19,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,I have no distance from it
Sunshine,1070,20,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,It is a match between Jun Robles Lana and Direk Tonet as my favorite active Filipino filmmaker right now tapos crush ko na si Maris PBB days nya pa lang
Sunshine,1070,21,odinofcodin,,180.0,ltbx,Of course I’m gonna love it
Sunshine,1071,1,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"Sunshine (Maris Racal) is a record-breaking national athlete, but the film fails to show the weight of that achievement"
Sunshine,1071,2,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"She wears a tank top marked “Asian Games 2018,” and her coach (Meryll Soriano) warns her against complacency: “Balewala lahat ng gold mo sa Asian Games"
Sunshine,1071,3,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"”Since the Asian Games are held every four years, and Sunshine is about 19 or 20, this suggests she won multiple golds in 2018 — a rare feat"
Sunshine,1071,4,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"She would be gymnastics royalty, a media darling, likely the most successful Filipina rhythmic gymnast in history"
Sunshine,1071,5,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,Yet the film doesn’t show her as a public figure
Sunshine,1071,6,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"No news clippings, no media buzz, no crowds—just a few kids asking for a selfie"
Sunshine,1071,7,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"It also focuses mostly on her ribbon routine, barely showing the hoop, ball, or clubs—all key to establishing her as Olympic-level"
Sunshine,1071,8,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"Sunshine’s decision to abort is quick, and her fears and ambitions are underexplored"
Sunshine,1071,9,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"The Olympics, in fact, feel more like her coach’s dream—the film tells us this but doesn’t show it"
Sunshine,1071,10,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"There’s no pressure from a country rooting for her, nor from sponsors who presumably funded her expensive training (which we’re left to assume, since rhythmic gymnastics is an elite sport)"
Sunshine,1071,11,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"No rival gymnast, no sense of competition, no major stakes, and no real glimpse into the demanding world of elite sport"
Sunshine,1071,12,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,All this undercuts the tension around her unwanted pregnancy
Sunshine,1071,13,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,Jadaone instead spends a chunk of screen time on soapy magical realism
Sunshine,1071,14,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"An imaginary, foul-mouthed child follows Sunshine around, mocking her decisions"
Sunshine,1071,15,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"But instead of adding insight, this character becomes repetitive and irritating"
Sunshine,1071,16,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"Rhed Bustamante plays another pregnant teen, awkwardly inserted into the plot in an effort to cover too many sides of the abortion debate"
Sunshine,1071,17,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,But Rhed’s more serious situation makes Sunshine’s dilemma feel shallow—like a story about a girl careless with sex and unwilling to face the consequences
Sunshine,1071,18,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"Some visuals in Sunshine hit hard: abortifacients sold beside religious icons outside Quiapo Church—a jab at how the Catholic Church, in practice, is more ritual than moral compass"
Sunshine,1071,19,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,There’s also a grim motel scene
Sunshine,1071,20,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,But these moments can’t save the film
Sunshine,1071,21,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"Set in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, where abortion is illegal, Sunshine tries to raise issues around teen pregnancy and reproductive rights, like overcrowded maternity wards"
Sunshine,1071,22,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"True enough, the Philippines has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Southeast Asia, especially among the poor"
Sunshine,1071,23,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"But if a film brings this up, it must give some context"
Sunshine,1071,24,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"The Reproductive Health Law, passed only in 2012, was meant to help—but the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) continues to fight tooth and nail against sex education and birth control"
Sunshine,1071,25,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,The film ignores all this
Sunshine,1071,26,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"Instead, it gives us a cartoonish, Bible-thumping doctor and a patriarchal pastor—villains standing in for real problems"
Sunshine,1071,27,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"We don’t expect to be spoon-fed, but when a film enters controversial ground and hints at bigger issues, it has a duty to avoid shallow symbols"
Sunshine,1071,28,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,"In the end, Sunshine parrots Western slogans like “My body, my choice” without anchoring its stance in the Philippine context"
Sunshine,1071,29,tepmayo,,80.0,ltbx,The message feels imported and emotionally flat

Sunshine,1076,1,allinvain,,180.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,1077,1,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Ang lungkot
Sunshine,1077,2,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,"The credits started rolling and I sat there, dazed and tear-stained"
Sunshine,1077,3,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,I wanted to sing my praises to the movie (and I do
Sunshine,1077,4,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,) pero mas nangibabaw sa akin ang sakit
Sunshine,1077,5,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Marami akong gustong punahin
Sunshine,1077,6,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Mga detalyeng mas lalong binigyan ng laman ang buhay ni Sunshine
Sunshine,1077,7,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Like how she was always framed between rails
Sunshine,1077,8,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,"Clearly an artistic choice, but to me, she was caged throughout the film"
Sunshine,1077,9,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,By judgment
Sunshine,1077,10,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,By society's cruelty
Sunshine,1077,11,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,By this country's refusal to grant women autonomy over their own bodies
Sunshine,1077,12,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,"Wherever she goes, the spaces are as narrow as her choices"
Sunshine,1077,13,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Masikip sa bahay kung saan nakikita mo kung paano natapos ang pangarap ng ate niya
Sunshine,1077,14,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Masikip sa paaralan kung saan mag-isa niyang nilalabanan ang mga mapangmatang titig at pandidiri
Sunshine,1077,15,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Masikip sa Quiapo kung saan siya laging tumatakbo at naghahanap ng paraan para makalaya
Sunshine,1077,16,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Masikip sa ospital—ospital kung saan nilalarawan ang kakulangan sa magandang serbisyo
Sunshine,1077,17,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Ospital kung saan nahuhusgahan ang maraming kababaihan
Sunshine,1077,18,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,The only time Sunshine's world seems to widen and glow is when she's inside the training center
Sunshine,1077,19,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Doon lang siya malaya
Sunshine,1077,20,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Doon lang may ngiti sa kanyang mga labi
Sunshine,1077,21,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,At sana doon din natin maintindihan kung anong pinaglalaban ng pelikula
Sunshine,1077,22,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Sana gets mo na
Sunshine,1077,23,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Masaya akong may pelikulang ganito
Sunshine,1077,24,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Pero nangingibabaw ang lungkot
Sunshine,1077,25,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,What if this is another film on the big screen that will be forgotten soon
Sunshine,1077,26,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,I remember watching Brocka's Manila sa Kuko nang Liwanag and saw how many of its harsh truths are still prevalent today
Sunshine,1077,27,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Walang pagbabago
Sunshine,1077,28,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Walang usad
Sunshine,1077,29,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Mahirap pa rin
Sunshine,1077,30,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,The real pain of the movie is when we watch it years later and the truth remains: women still have to bleed to fight for their rights
Sunshine,1077,31,laxveloso_,,200.0,ltbx,Sana hindi
Sunshine,1078,1,mondsyyyy,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is another powerful film from Antoinette Jadaone
Sunshine,1078,2,mondsyyyy,,200.0,ltbx,Beautifully written and brought to life by a powerful cast
Sunshine,1078,3,mondsyyyy,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s a riveting story that, hopefully, sparks important conversations about woman’s right to choose for herself"
Sunshine,1079,1,bustedlights,,160.0,ltbx,"""Gets ko na""Lots of ways to interpret a simple line"
Sunshine,1079,2,bustedlights,,160.0,ltbx,"Kung kakampi ka man ni Sunshine simula o hindi, you will leave the cinema with the same echoing thought"
Sunshine,1079,3,bustedlights,,160.0,ltbx,Gets mo na
Sunshine,1079,4,bustedlights,,160.0,ltbx,Maris Racal's performance seals it
Sunshine,1079,5,bustedlights,,160.0,ltbx,Gets na gets
Sunshine,1079,6,bustedlights,,160.0,ltbx,"Absolutely enjoyed the solidarity between women in this film, but appreciated that it doesn't let you forget that other women can be a complicit to women's oppression too"
Sunshine,1079,7,bustedlights,,160.0,ltbx,Outstanding performance from the whole cast
Sunshine,1079,8,bustedlights,,160.0,ltbx,Salamat sa husay at tapang Direk Tonet
Sunshine,1080,1,keshiaaangg,,120.0,ltbx,"No uterus, no opinion"
Sunshine,1080,2,keshiaaangg,,120.0,ltbx,Powerful movie that speaks up about women reproductive rights in a country that is so religious and conservative
Sunshine,1080,3,keshiaaangg,,120.0,ltbx,Women should have a choice and we need to destigmatize abortion
Sunshine,1081,2,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"still, hindi pa rin nagbago ang stand ko"
Sunshine,1081,3,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,mas lumalim pa nga kasi sa pangalawang beses mas nakita ko ang maliliit na detalye na namiss ko nung unang beses
Sunshine,1081,4,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,may mga dialogue na noon ko lang naintindihan ng ayos
Sunshine,1081,5,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"ang ganda, mas na-appreciate ko lalo ang pag-arte ng mga karakter"
Sunshine,1081,6,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"sobrang galing ni Maris, as in ma luluhod ako for you, iba ka"
Sunshine,1081,7,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"at sa pangalawang beses nakuha pa rin ako ni jennica garcia, sobrang galing"
Sunshine,1081,8,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"sa konti ng lines nya na yon ang daming nyang emotion na nadeliver, nakakamangha pa rin panuorin sobrang galing din na aktres"
Sunshine,1081,9,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"gustong-gusto ko talaga kung paano ipinasok ni direk ang storya ni mary grace, nakakatuwa marinig ang reaction ng mga katabi ko sa sinehan, may mga nagmumura pa ng pabulong"
Sunshine,1081,10,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi pa rin nabawasan ang galit ko kay bobot at ang frustrations ko nung nalaman ko na 13 y/o lang si menggay, at nung biglang nawala si ariana"
Sunshine,1081,11,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,sa pangalawang beses gustong-gusto ko pa rin yung mga shot na para bang nakakulong si sunshine at nakahiwalay sa lipunan na nagpapahiwatig ng pag-iisa nya
Sunshine,1081,12,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,ganda non direk
Sunshine,1081,13,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,mas naramdaman ko ang bigat sa bawat buntonh hininga ni Sunshine
Sunshine,1081,14,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"ang ganda ng mga scenes na tahimik lang, walang sinasabi pero sobrang lakas ng impact nya"
Sunshine,1081,15,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"natatakot pa rin ako para sa mga kapwa ko babae na maaring makaranas nito mag-isa, sobrang nakakabilib ang tapang at paninindigan ni Sunshine para sa sarili nya"
Sunshine,1081,16,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"ANG GANDA TALAGA NG PELIKULA NA TO, TANGINA"
Sunshine,1081,17,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,SIGURO ITO NA ANG PABORITO KONG PELIKULA NGAYON TAON
Sunshine,1081,18,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,SOBRANG LAKAS NG EPEKTO SA AKIN
Sunshine,1081,19,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,SANA GANON DIN SA LAHAT NG NAKAPANUOD
Sunshine,1081,20,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,ANG SARAP IPAGSIGAWAN NA DAPAT PANUORIN
Sunshine,1081,21,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"Naiintindihan kita, Sunshine"
Sunshine,1081,22,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,"Maris, napakahusay mo"
Sunshine,1081,23,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,fan na fan mo ako
Sunshine,1081,24,yvesrene,,200.0,ltbx,Salamat Direk Tonet at sa lahat ng bumuo ng Sunshine
Sunshine,1082,1,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Layunin ng Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) na magkaroon ng kamalayan ang kabataan sa mga isyu ng seksuwalidad lalo pa na nasa yugto sila na tinutuklas ito
Sunshine,1082,2,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa kabilang banda, kontrobersiyal ito sa ating bansang Katolisismo ang pinakalaganap na relihiyon"
Sunshine,1082,3,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Gayundin ang usapin ng aborsiyon
Sunshine,1082,4,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa panulat at direksiyon ni Antoinette Jadaone, isa itong pelikulang sports drama na umiikot kay Sunshine (Maris Racal) na kailangan magpasiya kung ipagpapatuloy o hindi ang pagbubuntis habang papalapit ang kaniyang paglahok sa pambansang paligsahan sa rhythmic gymnastics"
Sunshine,1082,5,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,"Walang tapon sa bawat kuha ng mga eksena, kahit na sa mga background audio nito, sapagkat sumisimbolo ito sa kalagayan ng Pilipina sa ating patriyarkal na lipunan"
Sunshine,1082,6,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,"Nagustuhan ko ang panulat at direksiyon nito dahil sang-ayon sa sinabi ng aking kaibigan, naiparanas nito ang pakiramdam na may isa kang kakilala na kahalintulad ni Sunshine"
Sunshine,1082,7,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,"Bukod dito, naiparamdam nito na kasama ka sa pelikula"
Sunshine,1082,8,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Iyong tipong sinubaybayan mo rin ang paglalakbay ni Sunshine sa saanmang sulok ng Maynila
Sunshine,1082,9,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,"Kaya, makakaugnay at mailalagay mo ang sarili sa kalagayan ng pangunahing tauhan o sa sinuman"
Sunshine,1082,10,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Malinis din ang pagkaka-edit ng pelikula sapagkat malinaw sa direktor kung ano ang nais niyang mangyari kay Sunshine
Sunshine,1082,11,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Piling-pili ang mga eksena kaya ang hirap pumili ng pinakamaganda o pinakanagustuhan
Sunshine,1082,12,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,"Hangang-hanga rin ako disenyong pamproduksyon nito dahil bukod sa ginalugad talaga ang madidilim na espasyo ng Maynila, iniisip ko kung paano sila nakapag-shooting sa ganoong karaming tao"
Sunshine,1082,13,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Grabeng blockings niyon
Sunshine,1082,14,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Karapat-dapat talaga na papurihan si Racal sa kaniyang pagganap dito
Sunshine,1082,15,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Tama lamang ang timpla ng iba't ibang emosyon ang ipinamalas niya rito
Sunshine,1082,16,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,"Ngunit ang pinakanakabibilib sa lahat, magaling din ang mga pantulong na tauhan kaya napalitaw nito ang husay ng pangunahing artista"
Sunshine,1082,17,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Ang tinginan nila ni Thea (Xyriel Manabat)
Sunshine,1082,18,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Ang coach na tila pangalawang nanay na si Eden (Meryll Soriano)
Sunshine,1082,19,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Ang misterysong batang babae (Annika Co)
Sunshine,1082,20,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Ang kakampi na si Geleen (Jennica Garcia)
Sunshine,1082,21,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Kahit na ang lokong si Miguel (Elijah Canlas)
Sunshine,1082,22,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,May ambag silang lahat upang mapagtibay ang karakterisasyon ni Sunshine at ang husay ni Racal
Sunshine,1082,23,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,Ang ganitong pelikula ang nagbibigay ng dahilan kung bakit mahalaga na mayroong CSE at kung bakit kailangan mapag-usapan at mapag-isipan muli ang legal at siyentipikong pagpapalaglag
Sunshine,1082,24,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,"Babae man o lalaki, kahit na ang LGBTQIA+, binibigyan tayo nito ng awtoridad sa ating katawan"
Sunshine,1082,25,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa kabuuan, nagustuhan ko ang ""Fangirl"" (2020) ni Direk Tonet na naglarawan ng estado ng babae sa rehimeng Duterte"
Sunshine,1082,26,azuregq,,200.0,ltbx,"Higit pa sa debate ng aborsiyon, napaibig ako sa ""Sunshine"" dahil sa pagpapakita nito ng tunay na ideya ng feminismo - ang pagkakaroon ng kalayaang pumili at ng kakampi"
Sunshine,1083,1,jeffnobleza,,200.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,1084,1,just_miggy,,160.0,ltbx,"For a country na very conservative and religious, sobrang tapang para gumawa nang pelikula na may ganitong tema"
Sunshine,1084,3,just_miggy,,160.0,ltbx,Direk Tonet u will always be a legend
Sunshine,1085,1,handpickedberry,,160.0,ltbx,"iyak lang ako nang iyak habang pinapanood sa sine kasi hindi dapat ganito pinagdadaanan ng mga babae para lang maabot pa rin nila yung mga pangarap nila, hindi dapat nalalagay sa peligro buhay nila dahil lang walang maayos na sistemang kakalinga sa kanila, hindi nila dapat pagdaanan lahat ng ito mag-isa"
Sunshine,1085,2,handpickedberry,,160.0,ltbx,"laging ""paano kung presidente ng pilipinas yan"
Sunshine,1085,3,handpickedberry,,160.0,ltbx,""", ""paano kung makahanap ng cure sa cancer yan"
Sunshine,1085,4,handpickedberry,,160.0,ltbx,""", pero ni minsan naisip ba nila na yung babaeng pinipilit nilang maging ina, ay isang anak din na mayroong sariling pangarap, sariling kinabukasan na gusto pa niyang maabot"
Sunshine,1085,5,handpickedberry,,160.0,ltbx,"kahit ipanganak pa niya yung bata, hinding hindi yan makakahanap ng gamot sa cancer kung lalaki siya sa hirap dahil hindi handa yung magulang"
Sunshine,1085,6,handpickedberry,,160.0,ltbx,"habang pinapanood ko ito, gusto kong batiin si sunshine—at ang iba pang mga babaeng tulad niya—ng ""happy mother's day"""
Sunshine,1085,7,handpickedberry,,160.0,ltbx,"lumalaban sila ng mga labang sila lang ang nakakaalam, nagluluksa sa mga desisyong kinailangan nilang gawin"
Sunshine,1085,8,handpickedberry,,160.0,ltbx,"pero para sa akin, isa pa rin silang ina dahil sa pagligtas nila sa mga anak nila mula sa mundong ito na hindi mag-aaruga sa kanila"
Sunshine,1085,9,handpickedberry,,160.0,ltbx,bitbit nila lagi ang mumunting kaluluwa sa bawat pangarap na makakamit nila
Sunshine,1085,10,handpickedberry,,160.0,ltbx,"at mula ngayon, sa bawat pagtibok ng puso nila, hindi sila mag-isa"
Sunshine,1086,1,jhonaustria_,,200.0,ltbx,"If I’m being honest, Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine floored me"
Sunshine,1086,2,jhonaustria_,,200.0,ltbx,There is something in this film that’s raw and authentic
Sunshine,1086,3,jhonaustria_,,200.0,ltbx,It’s devastatingly human
Sunshine,1086,4,jhonaustria_,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine addresses the women’s act of choosing (their dilemma) and the outcome of that act
Sunshine,1086,5,jhonaustria_,,200.0,ltbx,"Jadaone’s direction was fearless for depicting women’s struggles, reproductive rights and vulnerability, especially in the context of abortion (which is considered taboo here in the Philippines), while focusing on the titular character’s dream—was commendable"
Sunshine,1086,6,jhonaustria_,,200.0,ltbx,"Its narrative structure, themes, relevance and layers were handled…"
Sunshine,1087,1,ehluhmariano,,200.0,ltbx,"gets kita, sunshine"
Sunshine,1087,2,ehluhmariano,,200.0,ltbx,"also, fuck miggy and his immature ass"
Sunshine,1088,1,hazelmarie,,200.0,ltbx,i rarely rave about indie films that tackle societal issues because the ones i've watched either sound too preachy or abstract that it's difficult to grasp
Sunshine,1088,2,hazelmarie,,200.0,ltbx,but sunshine proved to be different and that's why i loved it so much
Sunshine,1088,3,hazelmarie,,200.0,ltbx,it never tells you whether abortion is right or wrong
Sunshine,1088,4,hazelmarie,,200.0,ltbx,"instead, it shows you a genuine depiction of the lived realities of girls like sunshine and mary grace and gets you thinking about the many other girls/women like them long after you leave the theater"
Sunshine,1088,5,hazelmarie,,200.0,ltbx,"ang hirap maging babae sa mundo, lalo na rito sa pilipinas pero pinaalala sa akin ni sunshine na kailangan kong tapangan at lumaban di lang para sa akin kundi para sa iba pang kababaihang kasama ko sa araw-araw na laban"
Sunshine,1089,1,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine presents a two-pronged takeoff on putting forth a controversial subject it aims to transfigure into a discourse
Sunshine,1089,2,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s gritty yet poignant, a dichotomy facilitated by careful restraint in its direction, intricate cinematography, and Maris Racal’s stellar performance"
Sunshine,1089,3,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,The film deflects clichés observed in Filipino melodramas that often rely on overly oppressive emotional tropes and techniques
Sunshine,1089,4,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,"Most notably, it veers away from positioning religion or the Church as a central source of female agency"
Sunshine,1089,5,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,"Instead, it presents it as an androcentric institution where permission for a woman’s reproductive health decisions must be sought, implying a strong assertion of control and dominance over women’s bodies"
Sunshine,1089,6,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,"Set against the backdrop of bustling, grunge-textured Manila, the camera takes a remarkable grasp on the parallelisms and minutiae of everyday life in the cruel city: a crowded train moving across the metro juxtaposed against a dreary room in Avenida; an abortifacient vendor sitting by a display of Mary Magdalene busts she sells in Quiapo; a tight-knit community devoid of love and empathy for a child"
Sunshine,1089,7,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,The film refuses to paint the gaps and seams of a faulty society in broad strokes
Sunshine,1089,8,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine is delicately crafted and measured
Sunshine,1089,9,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,"It deeply delves into the nuances and detailed complexities of living in a Christian society that has, ironically and deliberately, chosen to position women’s rights on the periphery"
Sunshine,1089,10,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,"It taps into female solidarity as a form of agency and collective resistance, offering both an idealistic and pragmatic antithesis to the marginalization they have long been experiencing"
Sunshine,1089,11,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,"Reminiscent of Antoinette Jadaone’s pre-studio works such as Plano (2004) and Saling Pusa (2006), Sunshine feels like a beautiful work of personal musings"
Sunshine,1089,12,julsbatuang,,180.0,ltbx,"It is honest, outrageous, yet tender—marking one of her greatest directorial masterpieces"
Sunshine,1090,1,knspckl,,180.0,ltbx,"a narrative film that tackles relevant issues in the philippines: reproductive health, abortion, poverty, misogyny, etc"
Sunshine,1091,1,juliathorne,,200.0,ltbx,Perfect casting
Sunshine,1091,2,juliathorne,,200.0,ltbx,Beautifully written
Sunshine,1092,1,quark,,,ltbx,I think it's safe to say by now that Antoinette Jadaone is one of the greats of Philippine Cinema
Sunshine,1092,2,quark,,,ltbx,"And not just of now, but of all time"
Sunshine,1092,3,quark,,,ltbx,"The still-young filmmaker, who cut her teeth on quirky indie comedies ( Six Degrees of Lilya Cuntapay, Beauty in a Bottle) soon became the new queen of Pinoy Romantic Comedies, resulting in an 8-films-in-5-years streak that included classics like That Thing Called Tadhana, Never Not Love You and Alone/Together"
Sunshine,1092,4,quark,,,ltbx,"Then in 2020, something changed"
Sunshine,1092,5,quark,,,ltbx,"At the height of the pandemic, Tonet released Fan Girl -- an unflinching, searing commentary on celebrity worship, toxic masculinity and patriarchal oppression in the Philippines"
Sunshine,1092,6,quark,,,ltbx,"It not only won all the major awards during that year's MMFF, but was also the highest-grossing film for that year"
Sunshine,1092,7,quark,,,ltbx,"This makes Tonet somewhat of a unicorn: a writer/director who can make socially relevant, intelligent cinema but at the same time kill it at the box office"
Sunshine,1092,8,quark,,,ltbx,This feat is especially astounding in a year when zero films have actually made money
Sunshine,1092,9,quark,,,ltbx,"And so that six-year streak turned into a five-year absence, and wisely so"
Sunshine,1092,10,quark,,,ltbx,"Tonet channeled her creative juices towards other roles and mediums: television, streaming, producing"
Sunshine,1092,11,quark,,,ltbx,"I'm a big believer in taking care of one's filmography, and she's doing just that"
Sunshine,1092,12,quark,,,ltbx,And as fans we have finally been rewarded
Sunshine,1092,13,quark,,,ltbx,"Hello, Sunshine"
Sunshine,1092,14,quark,,,ltbx,"Sunshine follows a slew of, and there's no non-blunt way to put it, abortion movies that have come to the fore in the 2020s"
Sunshine,1092,15,quark,,,ltbx,You have the US's Never Rarely Sometimes Always and France's L'Événement
Sunshine,1092,16,quark,,,ltbx,All films follow the internal struggle and loneliness that women face when going through the abortion process
Sunshine,1092,17,quark,,,ltbx,"Of the three, Sunshine is the most powerful for one simple reason: it's set in the Philippines"
Sunshine,1092,18,quark,,,ltbx,"And while it hits home because it is home, the oppression, hypocrisy and outright strangeness of the system makes this abortion story unique"
Sunshine,1092,19,quark,,,ltbx,"It's a country where you can find ads for abortives just buy typing in ""abortion"" in your instagram search terms, where a vendor of Catholic paraphernalia situated outside a church will also peddle Cytotec, where a doctor who saves your life will also give you a 5-minute telling-to once you're well enough to listen"
Sunshine,1092,20,quark,,,ltbx,It's a country where self-righteous sanctimonium has endangered millions of young women's lives
Sunshine,1092,21,quark,,,ltbx,"Sunshine is pro-choice, but it's also pro-life"
Sunshine,1092,22,quark,,,ltbx,It never tries to turn away from the consequences and the trauma women go through when making this decision
Sunshine,1092,23,quark,,,ltbx,"And it shows us what could have been, never cheapening the lives that were lost"
Sunshine,1092,24,quark,,,ltbx,"These layers, the emotional depth with which Tonet imbues Sunshine, are what sets it apart"
Sunshine,1092,25,quark,,,ltbx,"It's a very thought provoking film, but it aims straight for the heart"
Sunshine,1092,26,quark,,,ltbx,"I've spent all this time singing Tonet's praises, but of course Sunshine wouldn't be Sunshine without the brilliant Maris Racal"
Sunshine,1092,27,quark,,,ltbx,I meant it when I said that Maris is a generational talent: a true actress with genuine love for the craft who just also happens to be incredibly popular
Sunshine,1092,28,quark,,,ltbx,She breathes so much life and attitude into Sunshine that she really feels like a friend
Sunshine,1092,29,quark,,,ltbx,"Someone you're rooting for, someone whose pain you understand"
Sunshine,1092,30,quark,,,ltbx,"It's a very important film, but don't let its importance weigh you down"
Sunshine,1092,31,quark,,,ltbx,"End of the day, like all of Tonet's films, it's a story well told with characters you genuinely care about"
Sunshine,1092,32,quark,,,ltbx,Sunshine is now showing in all SM Malls
Sunshine,1092,33,quark,,,ltbx,Please do go out and catch it right away

Sunshine,1095,4,emeryuh,,200.0,ltbx,Progresibo ang atake and it has the power to spark meaningful conversation and eventually i-glorify ang karapatan ng mga kababaihan sa kanilang sariling desisyon sa napakaraming bagay kabilang na ang kanilang katawan

Sunshine,1109,1,k0lab3ar,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine explores the balance beam of morality, tipping between the push to reclaim bodily autonomy and the pull of Catholic guilt"
Sunshine,1109,2,k0lab3ar,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s interesting how the film’s key scenes are set in the dark, sketchy streets of Quiapo — a reflection of how young Filipinas navigate the lifelong, generational burden of taking control of our own bodies, while still trying to stay in line with the same dark and sketchy standards set by the very society that claims to protect us from it"
Sunshine,1110,1,charmpaigns,,200.0,ltbx,I really do love this film

Sunshine,1118,1,miraikow,,140.0,ltbx,one of the very few women centered filipino films that talks about a taboo topic in our country and it did a great job at showing the realities and effects of us not having the right to choose a safer option because of it being illegal
Sunshine,1118,2,miraikow,,140.0,ltbx,I really like how this film didnt shy away from showing the different people we encounter in our society and how they view what should be a basic right of women as criminal and how badly they shame them for choosing themselves and their dreams instead of an unborn fetus
Sunshine,1118,3,miraikow,,140.0,ltbx,"yung line na ""gets ko na"" is so powerful ksi it came after numerous prejudices and it shows that coming from a place of understanding is much more important than just blindly enforcing your beliets unto others especially when you dont know their entire situation"
Sunshine,1118,4,miraikow,,140.0,ltbx,one thing Ing na nagkulang ako is the dialogue and breaking point tiga ni sunshine

Sunshine,1126,2,jrvicente7,,180.0,ltbx,"It was Jadaone’s courage that popped in my head when the title card flashed, a very Filipina name that connotes brightness and warmth — two things the film was not intended for, two things the titular character was deprived of"
Sunshine,1126,3,jrvicente7,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a story of every Sunshine, a Filipino woman vulnerable to systemic injustice and oppression; a story no one could have been told better than a Filipino woman herself — and a fearless and intelligent one at that"
Sunshine,1126,4,jrvicente7,,180.0,ltbx,"From reproductive health and general health care system to conservatism, Jadaone’s care and spirit championed"

Sunshine,1146,1,aeiyah,,200.0,ltbx,This movie encourages the discussion about reproductive health and how it harms more than it protects those who are directly involved the longer this societal taboo regarding topics like abortion and sex education gets ignored

Sunshine,1148,1,ronniepunzalan,,160.0,ltbx,There is much to commend about the film and it could have been even more impactful had it fully leaned into its intention of confronting the realities surrounding abortion and calling out institutions to respond with compassion and accountability
Sunshine,1148,2,ronniepunzalan,,160.0,ltbx,"While it could have been stronger had it fully explored the idea of safe abortion and pushed institutions to respond, the film’s restraint is understandable given the legal and cultural context"
Sunshine,1148,3,ronniepunzalan,,160.0,ltbx,"It opens the door for more Filipino films that reflect the lived experiences of many, especially women whose struggles have long been sidelined"

Sunshine,1159,5,christiankobe_,,180.0,ltbx,"because unlike athletes, the field doesn’t merely rely on one’s prime to succeed"
Sunshine,1159,6,christiankobe_,,180.0,ltbx,"instead, it honors the individual’s maturity, discernment, and time spent in understanding life"
Sunshine,1159,7,christiankobe_,,180.0,ltbx,this is what i felt in Direk Tonet’s recent slew of films

Sunshine,1159,11,christiankobe_,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine’s charm lies in showing the grim reality of the city, the sheer obliviousness of the night, the secret alliance of the system and culture continually perpetuating harsh conditions for women and their bodies"
Sunshine,1159,12,christiankobe_,,180.0,ltbx,"it’s an incisive picture for us to empathize with the Sunshines of this world, with their dreams at the palm of their hands but their backs against the wall—deprived of freedom, options, and utmost support"
Sunshine,1159,13,christiankobe_,,180.0,ltbx,and don’t you find it endearing that the ensemble that helped Sunshine’s reckoning are all women

Sunshine,1170,7,wormbrained,,160.0,ltbx,and it doesn't make it some overdramatic thing at points too because
Sunshine,1170,8,wormbrained,,160.0,ltbx,"it's all real, once we pull back one surreal element the film has"

Sunshine,1170,12,wormbrained,,160.0,ltbx,"but with incidents like what's seen in the film still happening, is that really the case"
Sunshine,1170,13,wormbrained,,160.0,ltbx,a real shame that this will be in like three theaters by the time wednesday rolls around

Sunshine,1180,12,stardustbrother,,180.0,ltbx,"the film never fails to let us know na tagarito si maris—ito ang syudad, ito ang sistema na bumibigo sa kanya at sa mga babaeng tulad niya"
Sunshine,1180,13,stardustbrother,,180.0,ltbx,"love how the message is clear without being too on the nose about it, the ugly state of the maternity ward, the doctors that serve the system vs those that TRULY serve the people, the kids that that teeter on magical realism and shatter the illusion of a fetus' seeming otherworldly potential once let out and born"
Sunshine,1181,1,yxmii,,180.0,ltbx,A thought-provoking perspective for those who are pro-life

Sunshine,1182,4,clrnccrz,,200.0,ltbx,it tackled a taboo topic very well
Sunshine,1182,5,clrnccrz,,200.0,ltbx,they successfully showed different reactions to abortion—the supportive pro-choicers to the people who stigmatize it (even medical practitioners)
Sunshine,1182,6,clrnccrz,,200.0,ltbx,"in the context of the Filipino society and religion, throughout the film, religion has been prominent"
Sunshine,1182,7,clrnccrz,,200.0,ltbx,"from sunshine’s rituals when she performs, the quiapo setting, the hospital scene, and the scene with Miggy’s dad… it all had religious dialogue which makes it so realistic, so Filipino"
Sunshine,1182,8,clrnccrz,,200.0,ltbx,The film successfully captured the nuances of a teenage girl in a college setting

Sunshine,1186,1,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,Interesting na rhythmic gymnastics ang sports ni Sunshine (Maris Racal)
Sunshine,1186,2,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,Hindi ito kilala sa ating bansa pero kitang-kita sa sports na ito na kailangan ng marinading determinasyon at disiplina hindi lamang sa larangan ng sports dito sa Pilipinas pati na rin sa paghahanda sa paglaban sa Olympics
Sunshine,1186,3,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,Kaya naman ng mabuntis si Sunshine ay naharap siya sa isang desisyong babago sa kanyang buhay at sa mga tao sa paligid niya
Sunshine,1186,4,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,Ilan sa mga isyu na nilatag ng pelikula ay ang kakulangan ng sex education at accessibility ng legal abortion sa Pilipinas dahil na rin sa konserbatibong paniniwala
Sunshine,1186,5,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,Idagdag pa ang kulang na suporta ng gobyerno pagdating sa ating atleta tulad na lamang sa eksenang sila pa mismo ng pamilya niya ang naghanda ng kanyang isusuot sa Olympics
Sunshine,1186,6,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,Religious hypocrisy din ang kinokompronta ng pelikula tulad sa eksenang giniguilt trip ng isang sarado Katoliko na OB GYNE at muli ring pang-guilt trip sa kanya ng pastor na ama ni Miggy kay Sunshine
Sunshine,1186,7,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,Si Miggy ay pastor kid na nakabuntis sa dalaga
Sunshine,1186,8,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,"Hindi na rin naman bago ang pagtalakay ng abortion sa Pilipinas sa pelikulang Pilipino dahil nariyan ang ""High School Scandal"" (1982) sa direksyon ni Gil Portes at ""Hinugot sa Langit"" (1985) na pinagbidahan ni Maricel Soriano at dinirek ni Ishmael Bernal"
Sunshine,1186,9,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,"Ang kagandahan ng pelikula ay babaeng filmmaker ang lumikha at alam niya ang nadarama at pinagdadaanan mapa-pisikal, emosyonal at sikolohikal ng kapwa babae"
Sunshine,1186,10,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,Napakahusay ni Maris Racal sa pelikulang ito
Sunshine,1186,11,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,Ang laking tulong ng cinematog kasi 'yun ang nag-set ng tone at mood ng pelikula over-all
Sunshine,1186,12,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,"Somewhat reminded of ""Gusto kita with all my hypothalamus"" pagdating sa cinematog"
Sunshine,1186,13,jimelikula,,140.0,ltbx,"Regarding sa discussion of abortion, medyo closer sa controversial indie film na ""Call Jane"""

Sunshine,1190,5,liaaprado,,200.0,ltbx,there are relatives that talk like that and there are doctors that have to risk their license to do exactly what a doctor should do

Sunshine,1210,26,gelooooooilano,,160.0,ltbx,"In a predominantly Catholic country wherein proper sex education and proper healthcare system are nowhere to be found, and practices are dictated by religion and morality, relying on social media platforms as search engines would mean that she’s susceptible to wrong notions of her reality, which may lead her to resort to the sudden decisions that she make"

Sunshine,1210,28,gelooooooilano,,160.0,ltbx,"If the international audiences accepted this film with open arms, it’s about time that the Philippines does the same, and the film’s message would transgress to those without an open mind and for those who are unawakened with the harsh realities that most “Sunshine” faces"

Sunshine,1211,4,luicardinal,,,ltbx,That what they actually needed was people who would understand and hear them and not who would feel bad for them
Sunshine,1211,5,luicardinal,,,ltbx,"This did not intend to resolve anything, cos we have been seeing this in real life and in the news"
Sunshine,1211,6,luicardinal,,,ltbx,"But this was a good reminder that after all these headlines, after all the movies that tackled the same story, and after all the social media awareness, IS IT’S STILL A PERSISTING PROBLEM FOR MANY FILIPINO CHILDREN AND WOMEN"
Sunshine,1211,7,luicardinal,,,ltbx,"That we have still yet to save these women, that our authorities still don’t care, and these women are still in danger"
Sunshine,1211,8,luicardinal,,,ltbx,"MALALA ANG HEALTHCARE, MALALA RIN ANG JUDGMENT"

Sunshine,1238,2,crispinyen,,200.0,ltbx,"Layunin nito ay marahil ipakita ang pinakamasalimuot na kalagayan ng ating lipunan, subalit nauuwi lagi sa paggamit ng trauma at karahasan bilang device lamang"

Sunshine,1269,5,thonter,,200.0,ltbx,it really committed the whole time and it tackled such a sensitive topic with seriousness and grace
Sunshine,1269,6,thonter,,200.0,ltbx,"the movie showed us how difficult simply living as a woman in the philippines could be, so much so that the only characters seen helping sunshine are women for the most part"
Sunshine,1269,7,thonter,,200.0,ltbx,"maris racal is a generational talent, and sunshine is proof that she is and always will last in this industry if she is just given scripts where she can shine"

Sunshine,1272,1,roynarra,,,ltbx,Nauso na sa mga Pinoy viewers na hihintayin na lang nila sa Netflix yung mga pelikulang Pilipino
Sunshine,1272,2,roynarra,,,ltbx,Para raw makatipid
Sunshine,1272,3,roynarra,,,ltbx,"Pero karamihan sa kanila, willing gumastos kapag Western superhero movie ang papanoorin"
Sunshine,1272,4,roynarra,,,ltbx,Gets naman din kasi nga may escapism kapag sinasalba ni Superman o ng Fantastic Four ang New York City kumpara sa mga realist stories sa Pilipinas
Sunshine,1272,5,roynarra,,,ltbx,Bat nga naman kailangan ng malaking screen para lang makitang nag-aaway si Dingdong Dantes at Charo Santos
Sunshine,1272,6,roynarra,,,ltbx,"Pero please, panoorin niyo ang mga pelikulang Pilipino sa big screen, lalo na yung may magandang istorya na maaaring magbigay-linaw pa sa mga isyu"
Sunshine,1272,7,roynarra,,,ltbx,Tulad na lang ng Sunshine ni Antoinette Jadaone
Sunshine,1272,8,roynarra,,,ltbx,"Tungkol ito kay Sunshine (Maris Racal) na naghahanap ng paaran na magpa-abort dahil sa napakaraming rason: hindi planado ang kanyang pagbubuntis, ayaw siyang panagutan ng nakabuntis sa kanya, ayaw na siyang samahan ng kanyang kaibigan, pagtsi-tsismisan siya, at mauudlot ang kanyang pangarap na maging Olympian"
Sunshine,1272,9,roynarra,,,ltbx,"Sa dami ng kanyang rason, simple lang naman ang kanyang dahilan: ayaw pa niya maging nanay"
Sunshine,1272,10,roynarra,,,ltbx,Ito ang unang Pinoy film na napanood ko na talagang sinusulong ang karapatan ng babae para sa kanyang katawan
Sunshine,1272,11,roynarra,,,ltbx,"At sa dami ng pinagdaanan ni Sunshine, kahit na may reservations ka sa isyu ng abortion, gugustuhin mong matupad ang gusto ng ating bida"
Sunshine,1272,12,roynarra,,,ltbx,Ramdam na ramdam ko kay Maris ang mga dinadalang problema ni Sunshine hindi lamang bilang isang aspiring Olympian kundi ang isang pagiging babae sa Pilipinas kung saan malakas ang impluwensya ng Catholic values sa ating mga batas
Sunshine,1272,13,roynarra,,,ltbx,Intersectional din ang pagtalakay ni Jadaone sa isyu ng abortion sa Sunshine
Sunshine,1272,14,roynarra,,,ltbx,Hindi ito basta-bastang women's rights na nakita natin sa Western media tulad ng Barbie (2024) at Sex Education (2019-2023)
Sunshine,1272,15,roynarra,,,ltbx,Hindi itinanggi o dinemonize ng pelikula ang Catholic guilt pero hinimay ito sa pamamagitan ng pag-humanize nito sa anyo ng batang babae na sumusunod kay Sunshine (Annika Co)
Sunshine,1272,16,roynarra,,,ltbx,Ang ganda ng chemistry nina Maris at Annika at ramdam mong iisa lang talaga sila
Sunshine,1272,17,roynarra,,,ltbx,"So, bakit nga ba dapat panoorin ang Sunshine sa sinehan imbes na hintayin sa Netflix o ano mang streaming service"
Sunshine,1272,18,roynarra,,,ltbx,Napakalalim ng isyu ng aborsyon at women's rights na dapat bigyan ito ng full attention
Sunshine,1272,19,roynarra,,,ltbx,"Pag naman nanonood tayo sa streaming service, may tendency tayong mag-check ng phone"
Sunshine,1272,20,roynarra,,,ltbx,Pero hindi dapat tayo ma-distract habang pinapanood natin si Sunshine
Sunshine,1272,21,roynarra,,,ltbx,"Pag naman sobrang intimidating yung scene, pwede nating i-pause"
Sunshine,1272,22,roynarra,,,ltbx,"Pero sa mga ganitong storya, dapat hindi ito pina-pause"
Sunshine,1272,23,roynarra,,,ltbx,Ma-disturb dapat tayo sa ganitong kwento

Sunshine,1281,11,520yiyoung,,200.0,ltbx,"reproductive rights are human rights and decriminalizing abortion will save a lot of women, lalo na ang mga batang babaeng walang kamuwang-muwang"
Sunshine,1281,12,520yiyoung,,200.0,ltbx,hindi natatapos ang pakikibaka sa pelikula lamang kundi sa paghingi ng accountability sa gobyerno at pagbago sa kaisipan ng mga patriyarkal at konserbatibong tao

Sunshine,1305,1,kathleenceralde,,160.0,ltbx,teh di ako makahinga buong film
Sunshine,1306,1,sempervictrix,,180.0,ltbx,shared pinay experience na magbreakdown sa jeep
Sunshine,1307,1,ceejaysm,,180.0,ltbx,This film touched me in ways I could never have imagined
Sunshine,1307,2,ceejaysm,,180.0,ltbx,It truly reflected the struggles of women seeking to abort their unborn children
Sunshine,1307,3,ceejaysm,,180.0,ltbx,"In a country where Catholicism dominates, even in law, abortion is viewed as taboo and a sin against the Lord Almighty, rather than as a procedure that can preserve someone's mental health and offer a way to escape the endless economic hardships we face"
Sunshine,1307,4,ceejaysm,,180.0,ltbx,It’s heartbreaking how inaccessible abortion is here
Sunshine,1307,5,ceejaysm,,180.0,ltbx,So many people end up resorting to dangerous methods just to find the peace they desperately need
Sunshine,1307,6,ceejaysm,,180.0,ltbx,The plot twists kept me on the edge of my seat—I absolutely loved this film
Sunshine,1308,2,xtianjca,,200.0,ltbx,Just caught myself staring at awe in the cinema after the film
Sunshine,1309,1,mikailassance,,180.0,ltbx,wait lang hinga muna ko
Sunshine,1310,1,rararani,,200.0,ltbx,the first half of this movie is the most stressed i have EVER been in a cinema
Sunshine,1310,2,rararani,,200.0,ltbx,"the portrayal of how loud, crowded, and messy manila is, is perfect for enhancing sunshine's emotions"
Sunshine,1310,3,rararani,,200.0,ltbx,"because of that, everything feels so REAL"
Sunshine,1310,4,rararani,,200.0,ltbx,"when they revealed that the little kids were the kids that would've been born, i thought for a second, ""oh no they might keep the baby"
Sunshine,1310,5,rararani,,200.0,ltbx,""" and ofc, it's great to see that they didn't"
Sunshine,1310,6,rararani,,200.0,ltbx,but the way they did…
Sunshine,1311,1,leefilms,,180.0,ltbx,“gets ko na
Sunshine,1312,1,rnrxs,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is Antoinette Jadaone’s best work to date, with Maris Racal’s incredible acting chops as a cherry on top on an already well-written script, emotionally gripping plot, and beautiful cinematography"
Sunshine,1312,2,rnrxs,,200.0,ltbx,"The film does not shy away from talking about a lot of pertinent topics on womanhood, abuse, neglect, access to healthcare, and self-determination without overloading the audience with information"
Sunshine,1312,3,rnrxs,,200.0,ltbx,"I particularly liked how the film utilized a young child as Sunshine’s consciousness in the flesh, reflecting whether or not to…"
Sunshine,1313,1,jhaancl,,200.0,ltbx,Never doubt this movie when I first watched the trailer last yr
Sunshine,1313,2,jhaancl,,200.0,ltbx,Indie films are indeed the best films
Sunshine,1313,3,jhaancl,,200.0,ltbx,"About the movie and story itself, grabe sobrang totoo at sobrang galing ng pagkakagawa, well Antoinette Jadaone lang naman diba"
Sunshine,1313,4,jhaancl,,200.0,ltbx,But also Maris Racal
Sunshine,1313,5,jhaancl,,200.0,ltbx,gurllllll she's giving sa movie na 'to
Sunshine,1313,6,jhaancl,,200.0,ltbx,Sobrang deserve nito na mapanood ng maraming pilipino at magkaroon ng recognition
Sunshine,1314,1,ayanllaneta,,160.0,ltbx,Yayanigin ka ng pelikulang ito ni Jadaone
Sunshine,1314,2,ayanllaneta,,160.0,ltbx,Imposibleng hindi mo bisitahin at kuwestiyunin ang pananaw ng marami tungkol sa konsepto ng aborsyon matapos mong mapanood ang mga eksenang salamin ng itinatangging riyalidad sa bansa
Sunshine,1315,1,nathoyd,,180.0,ltbx,gets ko na
Sunshine,1315,2,nathoyd,,180.0,ltbx,tangina maris galing mo

Sunshine,1316,2,hulyoo,,180.0,ltbx,only 3 cinemas na lang by july 30)
Sunshine,1317,1,4thgilmoregirl_,,180.0,ltbx,"unsettling, uncomfortable, and necessary"
Sunshine,1317,2,4thgilmoregirl_,,180.0,ltbx,"I appreciate that Sunshine was a little hard to watch; it goes to show that a country heavily influenced by religion, handled with corruption and obsolete data and methods, women are often left with no safe choices"
Sunshine,1317,3,4thgilmoregirl_,,180.0,ltbx,"The storytelling included no gloss, no overdramatizing—just harsh realities of what women in the Philippines face"
Sunshine,1317,4,4thgilmoregirl_,,180.0,ltbx,"Acting of the whole ensemble was solid and effective, but at the center of it is, Maria Racal, delivered an impressive performance across the board"
Sunshine,1317,5,4thgilmoregirl_,,180.0,ltbx,"Also, FUCK MEN"
Sunshine,1317,6,4thgilmoregirl_,,180.0,ltbx,Men are really pigs
Sunshine,1318,1,arxye,,200.0,ltbx,MARIS RACAL
Sunshine,1318,2,arxye,,200.0,ltbx,ANTONETTE JADAONE
Sunshine,1318,3,arxye,,200.0,ltbx,that's it
Sunshine,1318,4,arxye,,200.0,ltbx,that's the review
Sunshine,1319,1,nickszn,,160.0,ltbx,maria racal ate pero i have to ask na if sunshine is literally a gold medalist why isnt she treated like royalty or with all the benefits like yulo
Sunshine,1319,2,nickszn,,160.0,ltbx,or ample media coverage
Sunshine,1319,3,nickszn,,160.0,ltbx,like thatd be a big deal i would be glazing tf out of her if she was my classmate
Sunshine,1320,1,no01gaf,,200.0,ltbx,MARIS RACAL YOU ARE TAKING THE OSCAR
Sunshine,1321,1,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone, gets ko na"
Sunshine,1321,2,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,"Took me a minute to pause, reflect, and absorb the film with all of it"
Sunshine,1321,3,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,The power of the film is the way it presents and tackles about womanhood and abortion
Sunshine,1321,4,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,"How Jadaone, shows, and you get it without needing the tell part"
Sunshine,1321,5,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,Every woman in the film is amazingly presented
Sunshine,1321,6,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,"From the coach, doctor, sister, and teenager"
Sunshine,1321,7,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,"I’m giving injustice and lackluster narrative of how powerful, impactful, and lustrous the film is"
Sunshine,1321,8,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,"Each frame is enthralling, given Maris’ powerful performance and how raw Manila is portrayed"
Sunshine,1321,9,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,You take it as it is
Sunshine,1321,10,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,"The mess, powering through the noise, and living it all every single day"
Sunshine,1321,11,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,"The film also presents a huge middle finger to the hypocrisy of abortion and religion and how the only time Sunshine (Maris) felt free from her prison, which I must say is visually and creatively presented in the film is through her passion as a gymnast"
Sunshine,1321,12,mrtearex,,200.0,ltbx,"Will try and revise this to write a cohesive review, but definitely glad I got the opportunity to watch this at the cinema"
Sunshine,1322,1,lxrngrc,,200.0,ltbx,relevant and real
Sunshine,1323,1,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,"either may kakilala kang parang si sunshine, or muntik nang maging si sunshine, or baka muntik ka nang maging si sunshine, or ikaw mismo si sunshine"
Sunshine,1323,2,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,"or, you know, nanood ka lang at may naramdaman"
Sunshine,1323,3,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,at okay lang rin yun
Sunshine,1323,4,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,yung gusto ko na ginawa ng pelikula ay na-explore niya yung delusyon ng unborn child ng isang babae
Sunshine,1323,5,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,para sa akin ay innate feminine thing ito-- nagpapakita sila minsan sa panaginip
Sunshine,1323,6,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,nagpakita yung akin sa isang panaginip
Sunshine,1323,7,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,natakot ako
Sunshine,1323,8,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,"to have that fear manifest itself as this metaphysical, illusionary child that follows you around when faced with an unwanted pregnancy is so poignant and sickening"
Sunshine,1323,9,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,pasan talaga ng babae ang mundo dahil ang sarili niyang pag-iisip ay kinakalaban ng katawan niya
Sunshine,1323,10,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,ng utak niya
Sunshine,1323,11,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,"and maybe that's why na-appreciate ko yung approach ng pelikula at ng writer-director na gamitin yung speaking-unborn-child motif na favorite ng mga pro-lyfers because to make someone see or understand something, you have to speak their language"
Sunshine,1323,12,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,may constant negotiation ang pelikula with its audience
Sunshine,1323,13,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,"take me seriously, pls, hear me out"
Sunshine,1323,14,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,wag mong tatanggalin ang mata mo sa screen
Sunshine,1323,15,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,umiyak ka
Sunshine,1323,16,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,sabing umiyak ka
Sunshine,1323,17,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,"and you know what, it closed the deal come the final show"
Sunshine,1323,18,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,"i just wish it didn't end with that ""gets ko na"" line"
Sunshine,1323,19,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,nitpicky lang ako pero feel ko talaga mas maganda kung sa isang tanong siya nag end tapos final bow niya
Sunshine,1323,20,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,"wala naman kasi talagang makakaintindi sa buong sitwasyon mo, sunshine"
Sunshine,1323,21,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,matapang ka
Sunshine,1323,22,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,nahihirapan ka
Sunshine,1323,23,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,nararamdaman namin yun
Sunshine,1323,24,ladiebiird,,,ltbx,but no one will ever understand how it feels until you are in that position
Sunshine,1324,1,maxxconverse,,160.0,ltbx,that motel scene is a horror movie in itself
Sunshine,1324,2,maxxconverse,,160.0,ltbx,"loved the movie, loved the message"
Sunshine,1324,3,maxxconverse,,160.0,ltbx,"though as someone who gets easily distracted by bad acting, they could’ve chosen kid actors who can actually act"
Sunshine,1325,1,_nikabee,,200.0,ltbx,gets mo ba ‘ko
Sunshine,1326,1,theundeadpetal,,180.0,ltbx,I literally watched Sunshine on a cloudy day
Sunshine,1326,2,theundeadpetal,,180.0,ltbx,Love it
Sunshine,1327,1,tyleranyways,,200.0,ltbx,"for once there's no film that quite match what Sunshine did to me, emotionally"
Sunshine,1327,2,tyleranyways,,200.0,ltbx,an absolute knockout in terms of its concept of bringing controversial topics about abortion and the struggle women face in search for accessible healthcare in the philippines on screen
Sunshine,1327,3,tyleranyways,,200.0,ltbx,"it's rare to find films that touch most of the pressing issues in our culture, society, politics, and even in reproductive health"
Sunshine,1327,4,tyleranyways,,200.0,ltbx,this was by far the most distressing and deeply harrowing depiction of teenage pregnancy i've watched since never rarely sometimes always
Sunshine,1327,5,tyleranyways,,200.0,ltbx,i'm on the edge of my seat the whole time
Sunshine,1327,6,tyleranyways,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang ganda na halos ako nakilabutan at napaiyak sa sudden escalation of events
Sunshine,1327,7,tyleranyways,,200.0,ltbx,must watch huhu
Sunshine,1327,8,tyleranyways,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang tunay na sining ay nagsasalamin sa totoong pangyayari sa buhay, at ang pelikulang ito, ang pelikulang Sunshine, ay nagsisilbing patunay na buhay na buhay ang sining nating mga Pilipino"
Sunshine,1328,1,dominique_,,180.0,ltbx,"A HORROR FILM FOR FILIPINAS AS WE WATCH THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR HELPLESSNESS AND LACK OF CHOICES REGARDING OUR BODIES, OUR LIVES"
Sunshine,1329,1,starkleus,,200.0,ltbx,"Women are frequently placed in situations where they feel they have no choices due to the regressive and harsh judgment of society regarding our rights, particularly our right to safe healthcare"
Sunshine,1329,2,starkleus,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine, as a whole, has stood firm in its mission, showing why such story is important, as women continue to endure the repercussions of societal choices that place us in jeopardy"
Sunshine,1329,3,starkleus,,200.0,ltbx,"This film is undoubtedly one of those that was treated with so much care, showing little to no romanticization of the anger and struggles the characters faced, and most importantly, it did not conform to conservative ideologies"
Sunshine,1329,4,starkleus,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is definitely an actress to keep an eye on; her artistry and commitment to her craft shine through in this film
Sunshine,1329,5,starkleus,,200.0,ltbx,"She certainly delivered one of the most valiant depictions of women in cinema, and it felt just right for her to bring the character of Sunshine to life"
Sunshine,1329,6,starkleus,,200.0,ltbx,"And of course, Antoinette Jadaone, who consistently brings depth and authenticity to her female characters, has done it again"
Sunshine,1329,7,starkleus,,200.0,ltbx,"As many have said, while anyone can create sociopolitical films, having women write and direct them adds a special touch that connects us to our shared struggles"
Sunshine,1329,8,starkleus,,200.0,ltbx,"Jadaone knows exactly how to write her female characters, and there’s nothing more beautiful than a woman who values the lives, journeys, successes, and struggles of her fellow women"
Sunshine,1329,9,starkleus,,200.0,ltbx,"Ultimately, as the film shows, it’s women who always end up caring for one another"
Sunshine,1329,10,starkleus,,200.0,ltbx,"May we live in a lifetime where abortion is decriminalized and seen as a fundamental aspect of healthcare for every woman, ensuring that no woman ever has to confront death or risk her life due to circumstances that leave her with no choice"
Sunshine,1330,1,andiedwyer,,200.0,ltbx,ABANTE BABAE
Sunshine,1331,1,jaypeep,,180.0,ltbx,it feels like watching social media debates on abortion come to life
Sunshine,1331,2,jaypeep,,180.0,ltbx,"it covers familiar arguments, from “what if the baby could be a future president” to real situations like abuse, unplanned pregnancies, and women not ready for motherhood"
Sunshine,1331,3,jaypeep,,180.0,ltbx,seeing it unfold makes the issue hit harder than words alone
Sunshine,1331,4,jaypeep,,180.0,ltbx,it also calls out how both religion and close minded people can push views that ignore lived experiences
Sunshine,1331,5,jaypeep,,180.0,ltbx,"i loved how the possible future children were portrayed, like the little girl who acts just like sunshine, or the “tomboy’s” child being gay"
Sunshine,1331,6,jaypeep,,180.0,ltbx,"the scenes felt real yet creative, and maris’s acting was excellent"
Sunshine,1332,1,notmariecurie,,180.0,ltbx,took me some time to process that a filipino movie about a stigmatized issue was watched by a full theater (that included gen x/boomers
Sunshine,1332,2,notmariecurie,,180.0,ltbx,) even when 2 big hollywood films were screening too
Sunshine,1332,3,notmariecurie,,180.0,ltbx,this almost never happens to our indie films
Sunshine,1332,4,notmariecurie,,180.0,ltbx,props to the team for carefully crafting this
Sunshine,1332,5,notmariecurie,,180.0,ltbx,"it won’t easily change people’s minds, sure, but it opens up conversations about long-hidden stories of struggle"
Sunshine,1332,6,notmariecurie,,180.0,ltbx,that’s better than nothing
Sunshine,1333,1,uji_film,,200.0,ltbx,"Wala akong sapat na karanasan para makipagdiskusyon ukol sa screenplay, sa directing, sa musical scoring, o sa writing ng pelikulang 'to"
Sunshine,1333,2,uji_film,,200.0,ltbx,"Pero dahil matapang na inilahad ni Direk Tonet ang kwento ng sangkababaihan, naiparamdam niya sa akin na sapat ang kaalaman ko para maintindihan ang gusto niyang iparating"
Sunshine,1333,3,uji_film,,200.0,ltbx,"Nasaksihan ko ang pelikulang isinulat hindi para mamilit, ngunit para magkwento"
Sunshine,1333,4,uji_film,,200.0,ltbx,"Para ito sa lahat ng naging ate, coach, menggay, doc helen, at iba pang kababaihan sa pelikula na nagpapatatag ng isang pagkatao sa mapanghusgang mundo"
Sunshine,1333,5,uji_film,,200.0,ltbx,Mga babaeng nagpapadali sa mga karanasan ng kapwa kababaihan
Sunshine,1333,6,uji_film,,200.0,ltbx,"Higit sa lahat, para ito sa iba pang mga Sunshine na piniling makawala sa pinaghalo-halong boses ng prinsipyo, moralidad, paniniwala, at kristiyanismo, para piliin ang pangarap niya"
Sunshine,1333,7,uji_film,,200.0,ltbx,"Kung iisipin, iisang Maynila ang nilalakaran, nasasaksihan, dinarasalan, at pinupuntahan natin"
Sunshine,1333,8,uji_film,,200.0,ltbx,Pero iba’t-ibang buhay at konsepto ang pinaniniwalaan ng bawat kaluluwang minsan nang nanatili dito
Sunshine,1333,9,uji_film,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa pagkilala ng mga babaeng piniling ialis ang kapit niya sa limitado at panandaliang kalayaan na ibinibigay ng sistemang ito, at sa panonood ng pelikula kahit hindi ikaw si Sunshine, sana maintindihan mo"
Sunshine,1334,1,eurth,,200.0,ltbx,"Tumatak sakin yung laging sinasabi ni coach kay sunshine, drown out the noise"
Sunshine,1334,2,eurth,,200.0,ltbx,"Kaya sa tuwing may scene na tumatahimik, walang music, walang background noise, walang dialogue, di ko mapigilan maging emotional"
Sunshine,1334,3,eurth,,200.0,ltbx,"Pati yung mga ibang cast, si jennica, xyriel, meryll, si doc elena"
Sunshine,1334,4,eurth,,200.0,ltbx,"Di makakaya ni sunshine pag wala sila, kapwa babae lang makakaintindi sa problema niya"
Sunshine,1334,5,eurth,,200.0,ltbx,And si Maris
Sunshine,1334,6,eurth,,200.0,ltbx,Gago tangina ang galing
Sunshine,1335,1,aagustd,,200.0,ltbx,this movie is just so sad
Sunshine,1335,2,aagustd,,200.0,ltbx,"ang lungkot kasi ang dali lang sabihin na mali ang ganito ganyan pero they never look at the one who will carry it, yung ""maiistuck"" habang buhay doon"
Sunshine,1335,3,aagustd,,200.0,ltbx,"sabi pa ng pinsan ko after movie, dapat panindigan nya yon kase ginusto naman nya yon tsaka inofferen naman sya nung *SPOILER ALERT* father nung guy na sila ng family nya magpoprovide para doon sa kid hanggang sa mag-18 tapos ipagpatuloy na lang ni sunshine yung gusto nyang gawin sa buhay pero girl"
Sunshine,1335,4,aagustd,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi naman after mailabas yung baby pwede nya na iwan yon, its a lifetime responsibility and we dont know na after ba ng lahat ng to she would get the same opportunities that she have now, na 2 months na lang makukuha nya na yung winork nya all her life"
Sunshine,1335,5,aagustd,,200.0,ltbx,"ang hirap lang kase iaccept at intindihin na ang daling magblame ng society sa mga babae, husgahan sila, pakialaman yung buhay nila, ang dali lang na ilagay sila sa isang kahon kung saan hanggang doon lang dapat sila kasi kapag hindi parang sobrang sama nila pero pag lalaki kahit ano na lang e no"
Sunshine,1335,7,aagustd,,200.0,ltbx,lalaki rin nagsabi nyang pinsan ko pati mga lalaki sa movie na to nakakasura magsama sama mga lalaking ang liliit ng utak
Sunshine,1336,1,sammypells,,200.0,ltbx,"sunshine, you're my bitch"

Sunshine,1338,1,vmoocn,,200.0,ltbx,oh Maris MOTHAFUCKIN Racal
Sunshine,1338,2,vmoocn,,200.0,ltbx,"this is not the first time direk tonet explored this kind of raw, intimate storytelling—and tbh, i wasn't fully convinced then, but sunshine got thru to me"
Sunshine,1338,3,vmoocn,,200.0,ltbx,the women of this film gave such gut-wrenching performances that it's impossible not to feel their pain (and strength)
Sunshine,1338,4,vmoocn,,200.0,ltbx,"what a painful reminder that women deserve so much, yet get so little"
Sunshine,1338,5,vmoocn,,200.0,ltbx,i hope more people see this film para ma-gets na rin nila
Sunshine,1339,1,dennisperez,,180.0,ltbx,Dreams carry a powerful force—one that can drive people beyond the bounds of their morals
Sunshine,1339,2,dennisperez,,180.0,ltbx,"In the film Sunshine, this force is embodied by a young gymnast, whose ambition, fueled by society’s expectations of fame, pushes her to the edge—physically, psychologically, and morally—as she struggles with the weight of success and an unplanned pregnancy"
Sunshine,1339,3,dennisperez,,180.0,ltbx,"Surrounding her are characters who reflect and intensify this tension: a doctor torn between personal ethics and the responsibility of helping an abortion patient; a street vendor selling both faith and death, caught in her own contradictions; a friend navigating the rift between her parents’ choices and her own agency; and a coach who, in relentlessly pushing her to break physical limits, unknowingly drives her toward moral collapse"
Sunshine,1339,4,dennisperez,,180.0,ltbx,The film offers a counterpoint through the voice of a child—a quiet yet powerful presence that serves as both an echo of the gymnast’s inner conscience and a projection of the expectations society imposes on her
Sunshine,1339,5,dennisperez,,180.0,ltbx,"This voice becomes a haunting reminder of who she is and who she is expected to be, grounding her in an innate moral compass even as she’s pulled deeper into chaos, anxiety, and confusion"
Sunshine,1339,6,dennisperez,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine presents a world where the pursuit of dreams comes at a cost, and where ambition blurs the lines between resilience and ruin"
Sunshine,1340,1,lifeofsai,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine said “a child
Sunshine,1340,2,lifeofsai,,160.0,ltbx,in this economy
Sunshine,1340,3,lifeofsai,,160.0,ltbx,” and stood her ground
Sunshine,1340,4,lifeofsai,,160.0,ltbx,love it
Sunshine,1341,1,lovedstreams,,,ltbx,juskopooo juskopooh
Sunshine,1342,1,zippyjus,,160.0,ltbx,"napakatapang ng pelikula na talakayin ang isa sa mga sensitibong isyu sa pilipinas, ang aborsiyon"
Sunshine,1342,2,zippyjus,,160.0,ltbx,napakabigat sa pakiramdam habang pinanonood ko ang pelikula hanggang sa paglabas ko sa sinehan
Sunshine,1342,3,zippyjus,,160.0,ltbx,hindi naman siguro kailangang maging babae o baliktarin ang sitwasyon nang maunawaan ang kanilang pinagdaraanan; kinakailangan lang ng kaunting pag-unawa at pagmamalasakit
Sunshine,1342,4,zippyjus,,160.0,ltbx,at walang sinuman ang may karapatang diktahan kung ano ang dapat mong gawin sa iyong katawan—sa iyong buhay
Sunshine,1342,5,zippyjus,,160.0,ltbx,"sana ay maisabatas na ang legalisasyon ng aborsiyon sa bansa at mas magkaroon ng pantay na karapatan sa reproduksiyon, lalo na sa mga kababaihan"
Sunshine,1343,1,virtualangle,,200.0,ltbx,give maris her oscar
Sunshine,1344,1,nannyfine,,200.0,ltbx,gets ko na ang hype over this film
Sunshine,1345,1,22ndcenturygirl,,180.0,ltbx,one brave statement on one of the most controversial topics in this country
Sunshine,1345,2,22ndcenturygirl,,180.0,ltbx,at ang saya ko kasi di nagbago yung paninindigan ng movie hanggang dulo
Sunshine,1345,3,22ndcenturygirl,,180.0,ltbx,"masaya ako para sayo, sunshine"
Sunshine,1345,4,22ndcenturygirl,,180.0,ltbx,salamat sa pagrepresenta sa mga kababaihan at lalong lalo na sa mga kabataang babae
Sunshine,1346,1,tobiiitot,,180.0,ltbx,"kakampi mo din ako, sunshine :)))"
Sunshine,1347,1,errylbonza,,200.0,ltbx,"Usually, yung mga movie reviews ko nasa FB/IG stories ko lang but this movie deserves space on my feed"
Sunshine,1347,5,errylbonza,,200.0,ltbx,Simply the best Pinoy film of 2025 so far
Sunshine,1347,6,errylbonza,,200.0,ltbx,"To think na Marvel's Fantastic Four ang kasabay na pelikula nito sa sinehan, nagulat ako na puno yung sinehan na pinanuoran namin sa SM City North EDSA"
Sunshine,1347,7,errylbonza,,200.0,ltbx,"Buti nalang, wala sya nung classic ""Pinoy 3rd act curse"" like Kathryn Bernardo's A Very Good Girl"
Sunshine,1347,8,errylbonza,,200.0,ltbx,"Actually, the last act pa nga ang strongest part of the film"

Sunshine,1358,4,ixriverlo,,200.0,ltbx,ang bigat bigat lang talaga niya
Sunshine,1358,5,ixriverlo,,200.0,ltbx,"agree ako sa isang review na nabasa ko dito—na sa sobrang realistic ng mundo na ipinakita ng pelikula, medyo naligaw ako ako dun sa element na apparition na bata (na at this point, parang wala nang may pake kung sino ba talaga siya)"
Sunshine,1358,6,ixriverlo,,200.0,ltbx,"pero inenterpret ko na lang siya bilang bata na magiging anak sana ni sunshine… nung nakita ko naman na dinudugo rin siya sa hita kasabay ni sunshine, naisip ko na baka batang sunshine pala siya"

Sunshine,1360,3,eanzezar,,200.0,ltbx,I like any movie that utilizes metaphors to emphasize the severity of a situation
Sunshine,1360,4,eanzezar,,200.0,ltbx,I think Annika's character was such an important part of the movie—despite others saying it downplayed the severity of the situation since it was a whimsical concept—since it brought contrast as well as a different but important point of view in such a controversial topic
Sunshine,1361,2,yogiieebear,,180.0,ltbx,"5/5I think this is one of those films that I will not just 100% get—not because it was badly written or executed—rather, it is such a lived experience (even phenomenological) that is scathing, intense, and too real"
Sunshine,1361,3,yogiieebear,,180.0,ltbx,But Jadaone & Maris Racal (and the whole ensemble
Sunshine,1361,4,yogiieebear,,180.0,ltbx,") made this film so empathetic, bold, and brave to actually tackle and make you realize what the social reality is"
Sunshine,1361,5,yogiieebear,,180.0,ltbx,"The collective Filipino religious trauma, poverty, crime, the lack of accessible healthcare—it's all encompassing with Sunshine's experience (and to all Filipinas as well)"

Sunshine,1371,4,tsujja,,200.0,ltbx,"it takes real courage to create a film that confronts the silences, the shame, and the societal fears around topics we often push aside especially in a country like ours where conservatism still tries to drown out stories like these"
Sunshine,1371,5,tsujja,,200.0,ltbx,"despite the progress we’ve made as a society, there are still so many walls around conversations that women desperately need to have"

Sunshine,1377,1,markarto,,200.0,ltbx,"How does a young woman endure a life filled with “faithfuls” who feel morally superior to judge and ridicule her choices in a society riddled with antiquated beliefs, further magnified by patriarchal politics where men can walk away without responsibilities and consequences"
Sunshine,1377,2,markarto,,200.0,ltbx,How do you thrive when institutions that are supposed to protect you are trying to pin you down
Sunshine,1377,3,markarto,,200.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal shines as the titular character Sunshine, hindi sumosobra o kinukulang, raw, honest, perfectly capturing a young woman in turmoil while trying to show a facade that everything is okay"
Sunshine,1377,4,markarto,,200.0,ltbx,"She is supported by an amazing cast: Annika Co, Elijah Canlas, Xyrel Manabat, Piolo Pascual, Rhed Bustamante, and the most affecting performance of Jennica Garcia"
Sunshine,1377,5,markarto,,200.0,ltbx,This film captures the gritty essence of Manila without being patronizing or didactic
Sunshine,1377,6,markarto,,200.0,ltbx,"Each frame is filled with ironies: abortion drugs sold beside a church, a repeated shot of split windows showing dreams, chaos, judgement, and slivers of kindness"
Sunshine,1377,7,markarto,,200.0,ltbx,"One shot in particular shows Sunshine rehearsing at home, on the split side are young people probably coming home from a fun night, kasi bata lang naman si Sunshine and she is willing to sacrifice everything for her dreams, at napakarami pang tulad niya, lahat sila hindi napapakinggan"

Sunshine,1378,2,ratatoumille,,160.0,ltbx,” id like to believe that the kid was a depiction of sunshine’s conscience and its such a powerful statement to put out there — that sunshine didnt have anyone to convince but herself
Sunshine,1378,3,ratatoumille,,160.0,ltbx,"that its okay as long as the choice was hers and not anyone else’s, especially in a society that often robs women the decision to make a choice in the first place"
Sunshine,1378,4,ratatoumille,,160.0,ltbx,"and despite the loud and often guilt-ridden noises that paralleled the packed and polluted streets of manila, it contested the catholic and cis-heteropatriarchal belief that the sole purpose of womanhood is motherhood and to choose to become someone else is to sin"
Sunshine,1378,5,ratatoumille,,160.0,ltbx,but sunshine wouldn’t have come through all odds if it weren’t also for the women in her life that chose to show up for her
Sunshine,1378,6,ratatoumille,,160.0,ltbx,"the only thing more powerful than the dangers that women are constantly subjected to, are the embrace of fellow women who just understand it"
Sunshine,1378,7,ratatoumille,,160.0,ltbx,"sunshine didn’t even have to utter a single word, her silence, both in her vulnerable and fearless moments, was heard"
Sunshine,1378,8,ratatoumille,,160.0,ltbx,"the quiet glances between her and thea, reassuring her that she is seen"
Sunshine,1378,9,ratatoumille,,160.0,ltbx,"her sister’s arms reaching out to her in bed, making her presence known and reminding sunshine that she’d never be alone, the gentle squeeze of menggay’s hands to let her know she’s safe"
Sunshine,1378,10,ratatoumille,,160.0,ltbx,"they all heard and seen each other, and having someone who’s willing to carry and share your burden with is enough for everything else to be bearable"

Sunshine,1382,3,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi ito nagpaligoy-ligoy sa layunin nitong maglahad ng katotohanan masakit man ito o hindi
Sunshine,1382,4,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,Unang tumatak sa akin ang pangalang Antonette Jadaone noong napanood ko ang That Thing Called Tadhana
Sunshine,1382,5,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,"Mula noon, sinusubaybayan ko na ang kanyang mga pelikula maging ito man ay romcom, crime, psychological, o political"
Sunshine,1382,6,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,"Siya at si Direk Dan Villegas ay palaging may tatak: may kirot, may kurot, at higit sa lahat, may lalim"
Sunshine,1382,7,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang Sunshine ay isang napapanahong pelikula na nagsisilbing mitsa para sa mahahalagang diskusyon: ang kalagayan ng mga atleta sa bansa, ang sistemang pangkalusugan at pang-edukasyon, pananampalataya, gender roles, at higit sa lahat, ang karapatan ng kababaihan sa sariling katawan"
Sunshine,1382,8,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,Madalas nating marinig: “Ang anak ay biyaya

Sunshine,1382,11,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang isang pagbubuntis ba sa murang edad ay dapat tawaging biyaya, lalo na kung ito ay dumating sa panahong hindi pa handa ang isang babae"
Sunshine,1382,12,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,"O isa itong uri ng sumpa, bunga ng sistemang mapanghusga"
Sunshine,1382,13,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi laging pisikal ang pang-aabuso sa kababaihan
Sunshine,1382,14,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,"Minsan, ito ay nasa anyo ng mga ideolohiyang pinipilit ipalunok sa kanila"
Sunshine,1382,15,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,"Kapag inagaw mo ang kakayahan nilang magdesisyon para sa sarili nilang katawan, para sa kinabukasan nila, para sa mga pangarap nila, iyon ay anyo ng pang-aabuso"
Sunshine,1382,16,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,Wala nang mas akmang gumanap bilang Sunshine kundi si Maris Racal
Sunshine,1382,17,cinesilip,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang kanyang pagganap ay puno ng puso’t tapang mula sa kanyang mga sulyap, bawat paghinga, hanggang sa mga katahimikan niya sa ilang eksena"

Sunshine,1391,3,arnchives,,160.0,ltbx,gandaaaa grabe
Sunshine,1392,1,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine (2025, Project 8 Projects)I acknowledge that there are a lot of things in life I take for granted as a cisgender man"
Sunshine,1392,2,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"In Antoinette Jadaone’s new film, Sunshine, she presents a flawed yet heartbreaking tale on the female cost of pregnancy"
Sunshine,1392,3,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"In the film, we follow nineteen-year-old Sunshine, who has dedicated most of her life, along with the support of her sister who was also a former gymnast, in rhythmic gymnastics and her pursuit to enter the Philippine team for the Olympics"
Sunshine,1392,4,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"However, several weeks before the National tryouts, Sunshine discovers that she got pregnant after a recent sexual encounter with her boyfriend"
Sunshine,1392,5,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"Stepping out of the theater, I realized how it’s so hard to be a woman, not just in the Philippines but in general"
Sunshine,1392,6,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"And pregnancy, one of the human experiences that only a cisgender woman can experience, and how much it impacts on their health, emotions, and even their dreams or aspirations - especially when it happens completely unplanned"
Sunshine,1392,7,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"All of these are further amplified in the situation here in the Philippines where sexual education is still not a priority, access to quality maternal care is expensive, and role of religion to beset unfair expectations towards women"
Sunshine,1392,8,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite having a strong message, there are things in Sunshine that I wish had been improved on"
Sunshine,1392,9,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"I must admit I felt a bit cheated out because the movie was initially hyped as a sports movie focusing on gymnastics - the same way Rookie did for volleyball, but in the end was more of a character drama that whose lead character is a gymnast"
Sunshine,1392,10,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"I wish that Jadaone delved deeper on Sunshine’s motivations on why gymnastics is important to her because at how the story was written, Sunshine could’ve played any sport and the story would remain the same"
Sunshine,1392,11,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"Before I get called out, I know the movie’s true intention is a commentary on the state of female reproductive health in the Philippines, but I felt like it was just a missed opportunity to highlight the state of female sports in the Philippines, particularly gymnastics because Filipino sports movies are so rare"
Sunshine,1392,12,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,I also felt like that the script could’ve been tightened up a bit as the elements of magical realism introduced in the story (without going too much in spoiler territory) didn’t land as much in terms of story logic
Sunshine,1392,13,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"As a follow-up to her lead starring role in 2023 movie Marupok AF, Maris Racal continues to be one of the promising actresses of her generation"
Sunshine,1392,14,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"And in Sunshine, she delivers one of her career best performances so far, especially at lengths her character goes through and in the dedication to train of the gymnastics segments of the story"
Sunshine,1392,15,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"Overall, Sunshine is not an easy watch because it doesn’t mince the hard truths of how it is living as a woman in the Philippines"
Sunshine,1392,16,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"And now with with the ongoing female reproductive health and sexual education discussion in the Philippines, Antoinette Jadaone offers a strong message on why it is imperative that protections for women’s health should be passed, and why the movie Sunshine deserves your time and your attention"
Sunshine,1392,17,carlcuevas,,160.0,ltbx,"However, irony that this movie can only be seen by a limited number of people because of its R16 rating as well as the unfair cinema practices in the Philippines, makes this even more frustrating"

Sunshine,1395,3,trstn39,,200.0,ltbx,"i think we need explorations of the fields in which we actually excel, even much more from the perspective of a woman"
Sunshine,1395,4,trstn39,,200.0,ltbx,"second, this film has a scent of lino brocka’s—the journey, the road, the streets, the jeep, the buildings, the motel, the church, the stalls and stores, the hospital, the government, the people—the social realism of it all"
Sunshine,1395,5,trstn39,,200.0,ltbx,"but different to his, sunshine has its own rhythm—a never-ending going back and forth, a push and pull, a dilemma that only athletes know, only pregnants know, only women know—a jadaone rhythm"

Sunshine,1395,12,trstn39,,200.0,ltbx,but this film just keeps on going and it’s not even apologizing for it
Sunshine,1395,13,trstn39,,200.0,ltbx,unapologetic but with care

Sunshine,1437,4,joven,,200.0,ltbx,"I am glad the film ended that way, a wonderful show of individual agency and power Congrats to the whole team"

Sunshine,1445,1,avindelacruz_,,160.0,ltbx,"Nakapanganak si Sunshine ng mga mugtong mata hindi dahil sa lungkot, pighati, o panghihinayang, ngunit dahil sa galit sa nakapanlulumong sistemang tumatalikod sa mga kababaihan"
Sunshine,1445,2,avindelacruz_,,160.0,ltbx,"Hindi ko ito kailanman maiintindihan, pero malinaw ang mga bagaheng hindi kayang bitawan, o bitbitin ni Sunshine"
Sunshine,1445,3,avindelacruz_,,160.0,ltbx,"Pinakapagpapasalamat kay Direk Tonet sa matapang na pagkukuwento, hindi natatakot at hindi kumakabig"
Sunshine,1445,4,avindelacruz_,,160.0,ltbx,Isang pelikulang isinulat mula sa puso at pakikiramay
Sunshine,1445,5,avindelacruz_,,160.0,ltbx,"Pati kay Maris, Annika, Jennica, Elijah, at Meryll, sa pagbibigay-buhay ng mga karakter na salamin ng marami"
Sunshine,1445,6,avindelacruz_,,160.0,ltbx,"At sa pelikulang ito na ngayong nailabas na, hindi na natin puwedeng talikuran pa"
Sunshine,1445,7,avindelacruz_,,160.0,ltbx,"Dahil nakapagsalita na ang Sunshine, nasa atin na ang pagtugon"
Sunshine,1445,8,avindelacruz_,,160.0,ltbx,Tayo naman ang magsasalita at magtatanong
Sunshine,1446,1,elaineclacio,,160.0,ltbx,putol titi to all rapists and irresponsible dicks
Sunshine,1447,1,kurtrsl,,160.0,ltbx,"An eye-opening look into the realities of the Philippines, this film delivers a powerful narrative with clarity and conviction"
Sunshine,1447,2,kurtrsl,,160.0,ltbx,"The storytelling is straightforward yet impactful, shedding light on the truths many Filipinos face every day"
Sunshine,1447,3,kurtrsl,,160.0,ltbx,"I now understand why the director chose Maris Racal — not because she is a seasoned actress, but because her raw, unfiltered talent brings a striking authenticity to the role"
Sunshine,1448,1,robismore,,160.0,ltbx,You know that a film is good when you see a lot of twitter gays in the cinema watching it with you
Sunshine,1449,1,theyw,,180.0,ltbx,"babae ka, hindi babae lang"
Sunshine,1449,5,theyw,,180.0,ltbx,maraming bagay ang pinaramdam sa akin ng sunshine
Sunshine,1449,6,theyw,,180.0,ltbx,"isa rito ang pinaalala niyang isa rin akong babae na may pangarap, na ako rin ay si sunshine"
Sunshine,1449,7,theyw,,180.0,ltbx,it made me go back to my purpose— kung sino ako at kung bakit ako nandito
Sunshine,1449,8,theyw,,180.0,ltbx,"hindi lang ito kwento ni sunshine, kwento ito ng bawat babae na alam kung ano ang gusto niya at ang karapatan niya bilang babae"
Sunshine,1450,1,znahler,,160.0,ltbx,The fact this got to even show in SM nationwide makes me amazed and is a testament to what this film symbolizes and argues for in our society
Sunshine,1450,2,znahler,,160.0,ltbx,"Even if I didn’t really care for a certain plot device used in the movie and in fact took my enjoyment at certain points from a very grounded and compelling story, the highs of this film is extraordinary and something I will always praise"
Sunshine,1450,3,znahler,,160.0,ltbx,"The way the camera and direction paints the complex feelings of Sunshine, the usage of Manila as both familiar yet alienating in its loudness and chaos, the rage and social commentary that is extremely brave in our current societyGiving tons of flowers for this film, I would even say that taking away the campier/comedic aspects of the film would have made this a masterpiece in my eyes"
Sunshine,1450,4,znahler,,160.0,ltbx,"Maybe in another rewatch, this would get a higher score"
Sunshine,1450,5,znahler,,160.0,ltbx,"If you liked the direction Direk Tonet took in Fangirl and wanted to see it taken to a different level, this film will be for you"

Sunshine,1452,1,kvein,,120.0,ltbx,"big fan of the filmmaking when it gets naturally gritty, captures very well the unwelcome conditions of living in a treacherous city as a woman automatically bound to persevere to survive; not so much of the magical realism/ abstract element that deems itself clever and subtle"
Sunshine,1452,2,kvein,,120.0,ltbx,also not sure if the baby characters help the cause when they are painted as quirky fun little angels
Sunshine,1453,1,allvster,,180.0,ltbx,"Throughout sunshine’s tumultuous journey it was always women who helped her out: the shady lady with the abortion pills, doctora helena, her coach, her sister, her best friend, even the ladies at the motel’s reception"
Sunshine,1453,2,allvster,,180.0,ltbx,The film was a love letter to the bonds of mutual understanding between women navigating through a world run by men
Sunshine,1453,3,allvster,,180.0,ltbx,"And also, queen ariana"
Sunshine,1454,1,ystefunny,,180.0,ltbx,wish that abortion of grown men is legal

Sunshine,1455,9,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,A motel in Avenida you could hear the banging of rail tracks
Sunshine,1455,10,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,Gusto ko rin yan mapuntuhan
Sunshine,1455,12,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,Favorite ko rito yung little transgressions
Sunshine,1455,13,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,"Madalas ang pekilula tungkol sa shame, kumporme sa shame"
Sunshine,1455,14,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,That is to say parang laging uphill battle
Sunshine,1455,15,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,Pero dito ni minsan hindi ako kinabahan para kay Sunshine
Sunshine,1455,16,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,"Panatag na panatag ako, nakakatuwang panoorin ang deliryo ng biyahe niya mula Quiapo-Avenida-Paco"
Sunshine,1455,17,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,"Wala akong awa, naluluha lang ako sa lungkot"
Sunshine,1455,18,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,"Bitin na bitin lang ako sa last sequence which looking back looked like an Aronofsky reference but contrivedHere is Maris Racal, who I’ve told my friends has a Mona Lisa face"
Sunshine,1455,19,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,"Minsan 'di ko mawari kung anong nararamdaman niya, but with her command on-screen you could tell what she wants"
Sunshine,1455,21,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,That is an actor you want to play Sunshine
Sunshine,1455,22,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,"Because Sunshine only has her mistakes to prop her up to dreams, which is a tricky proposition in the city, but nonetheless possible"
Sunshine,1455,23,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,And is often the case
Sunshine,1455,24,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,Kailangang gustong-gustong-gustuhin mo lang talaga
Sunshine,1455,25,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,Some kneel for a quarter-mile in Quiapo
Sunshine,1455,26,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,"Ang iba, pumapatay"
Sunshine,1455,27,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,"Nevermind if your conscience is (literally) following you, you just have to make it work"
Sunshine,1455,28,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,Ito ang ibig sabihin kung mabingit ka sa mga kuko ng liwanag
Sunshine,1455,29,noperome,,160.0,ltbx,To be a woman…

Sunshine,1460,10,directedbycj,,160.0,ltbx,Mahirap maging babae sa bansang hindi kumikilala sa mga karapatan ng mga kababaihan
Sunshine,1460,11,directedbycj,,160.0,ltbx,Maraming kagaya ni Doc Helena ang isinasakripisyo ang lahat para ipaglaban ang katulad nina Menggay at Sunshine na biktima ng abuso at ng sistema
Sunshine,1460,15,directedbycj,,160.0,ltbx,Nakakalungkot ang reyalidad
Sunshine,1460,16,directedbycj,,160.0,ltbx,Pero hindi pa tapos ang laban
Sunshine,1460,17,directedbycj,,160.0,ltbx,May this be an eye opener to many and may we be advocates of safer and more accessible reproductive health

Sunshine,1464,1,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,ang tagal ko bago isulat yung review ko sa SUNSHINE
Sunshine,1464,2,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"sa pangkalahatan, walang duda—maganda at matapang ang pelikula"
Sunshine,1464,3,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi lang maganda sa produksyon, kundi nakakanginig din ng laman"
Sunshine,1464,4,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"ang galing ng mga aktor, mula sa mga beteranong sina meryll soriano, xyriel manabat, elijah canlas, hanggang sa mga mas batang bituin na sina annika at julius"
Sunshine,1464,5,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"at higit sa lahat, si maris, na may malalim at matalim na hugot"
Sunshine,1464,6,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,simple pero malinaw ang paraan niya ng paghahatid ng mensahe: ang mga babae ang gulugod ng lipunan
Sunshine,1464,7,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"nag-iiwan ‘to ng tanong na bakit sa kabila ng bigat ng responsibilidad na iyon, mailap pa rin ang mundo sa kanila"
Sunshine,1464,8,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,representasyon ang pelikulang ito na kulang pa ang mga diskusyon patungkol sa mga karapatan ng mga babae sa pilipinas
Sunshine,1464,9,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"sa pelikulang ito, hindi ko kayang maging kritikal dahil alam kong hindi ko hawak ang karapatang humusga sa kwento ni sunshine"
Sunshine,1464,10,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"HINDI KO ITO KWENTO, at siguro iyon ang pinakamahalagang bagay na kailangang kong maunawaan"
Sunshine,1464,11,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"ako ay taganood lamang, at bilang manonood, ang tanging sigurado ako ay kung paano pinaigting ng pelikulang ito ang pagmamahal ko para sa kababaihan"
Sunshine,1464,12,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"habang pinapanood ko, parang unti-unting lumalalim ang pagkakaunawa ko na hindi pa rin patas ang batas sa mga kababaihan"
Sunshine,1464,13,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"mas nagkaroon ako ng lakas na sumandig sa tabi nila, sa pakikibaka para sa maayos, pantay, at respetadong pagtrato"
Sunshine,1464,14,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi ko kailanman lubos mauunawaan ang bawat sakit, takot, at pag-aalinlangan na kaakibat ng pagiging babae pero dahil sa pelikulang ito, mas malinaw na sa akin: sila ang sentro ng komunidad"
Sunshine,1464,15,phenikula,,200.0,ltbx,"at kung may dapat magbago, hindi sila iyon ngunit ang sistema, paniniwala, at pagtingin ng komunidad sa kanila"
Sunshine,1465,1,dancrit,,200.0,ltbx,The scene that stuck with me the most was the one with Sunshine (Maris) and Bata (Annica)
Sunshine,1465,2,dancrit,,200.0,ltbx,That “Gets mo naman ako di ba
Sunshine,1465,3,dancrit,,200.0,ltbx,"”, “Gets ko na"
Sunshine,1465,4,dancrit,,200.0,ltbx,"” exchange sent a whirlwind of emotions, it was the acceptance, assurance, the understanding"
Sunshine,1465,5,dancrit,,200.0,ltbx,"I loved everything about this film, especially how it tackled sociopolitical issues surrounding women’s rights and reproductive health"
Sunshine,1465,6,dancrit,,200.0,ltbx,"With Sunshine navigating these struggles against the gritty backdrop of Manila, it powerfully captures the harsh realities faced by many young women today"

Sunshine,1466,5,mewxtong,,180.0,ltbx,"I personally felt like the metaphor of the kids was a bit overdone, but incredible writing still"
Sunshine,1466,6,mewxtong,,180.0,ltbx,Music score from Rico Blanco was also great and I hope I get to hear more from him in films

Sunshine,1472,4,rgsno,,200.0,ltbx,"Watched it twice and it just got better — the first time i was focused with everything about Sunshine, her dreams, her feelings, her frustrations, her struggles; the second time I was more immersed with all the other characters in Sunshine’s life (including and especially the Kid) and how they perfectly represented the different faces of judgment or support or even her own thoughts and contemplations"
Sunshine,1472,5,rgsno,,200.0,ltbx,Nothing more to add kasi wala talaga ako nakitang mali sa film
Sunshine,1472,6,rgsno,,200.0,ltbx,"It is such a masterpiece and ang last message ko na lang siguro is:GETS NA GETS KA NAMIN, SUNSHINE"
Sunshine,1473,1,barolsxz,,200.0,ltbx,"Philippine cinema is very much alive, and a woman is our flag-bearer"
Sunshine,1473,2,barolsxz,,200.0,ltbx,"As a cisgender male who calls himself a feminist, I'll never fully understand what it's like to be a woman in this country"
Sunshine,1473,3,barolsxz,,200.0,ltbx,"This film, however, gave me the feeling of walking in their shoes"
Sunshine,1473,4,barolsxz,,200.0,ltbx,Every step was a courageous move toward something that could later become a matter of life and death
Sunshine,1473,5,barolsxz,,200.0,ltbx,"The story was written in a very deliberate manner, with the cinematography strengthening the narrative…"
Sunshine,1474,1,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,an underrated beauty of cinema is how it can invite one into a suspended state of reality
Sunshine,1474,2,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,"for a brief and borrowed hour or two, our story pauses to make space for someone else’s"
Sunshine,1474,3,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,"sunshine (2024) is one of those rare films that honors the lending of time not with surprise and spectacle, but with empathy as its goal and medium for exploration"
Sunshine,1474,4,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,"and the language of empathy in sunshine settles in slowly, almost bodily"
Sunshine,1474,5,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,"aptly named, the movie seeps through the senses like the quiet force of nature: it casts a harsh light on the grayed and shadowed alleys of manila, where sins and prayers blur into one cruel cacophony"
Sunshine,1474,6,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,"it burns with familiarity when we recognize sunshine, the girl, in our own world"
Sunshine,1474,7,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,"she sits beside us in overcrowded jeepneys, gets scolded like us in hospital beds, walks among us on streets of quiapo that shame and steal a strip of dignity"
Sunshine,1474,8,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,"with the same light, the film reaches for the sunshine within us - the ones who dream and persist, who dare hold our potential as promises"
Sunshine,1474,9,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,"there are sunshines among us held tightly by sisters, while some sunshines are held up only as stubborns who flicker through the dark"
Sunshine,1474,10,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,yet herein lands the most transcendent part of the film: it peddles no moral lesson or pedantic sermon
Sunshine,1474,11,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,"all that it offers is an invitation to bear witness to sunshine, as she moves to the rhythm of a music only she can hear and pushes against the gravity of choices forced upon her"
Sunshine,1474,12,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,the film doesn’t seek answers; it simply asks for understanding
Sunshine,1474,13,majoygrefaldo,,180.0,ltbx,"in its own sober way, it holds out hope that when the borrowed time is up, may we not only remember every sunshine who flies and rises, but also the ones who fall and return, until we see how every ground that meets her, holds her, or traps her, as she labors to birth her becoming, is also the same one we own"
Sunshine,1475,1,emanuellapuz_,,200.0,ltbx,"Your body, Your choice"

Sunshine,1479,1,newdlesss,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine' culminates in a poignant scene where the young protagonist watches the titular character pursue her dreams with unbridled joy, tempered by the weight of past mistakes"

Sunshine,1489,10,chestnuit,,160.0,ltbx,"we hear of teenage pregnancies in schools, priests or churches condemning pre-marital intercourse in their readings during mass, parents warning you about the dangers of engaging in sex, etc"

Sunshine,1490,3,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Gaya ng maraming babae at dalaga na dumaan sa unwanted pregnancy o pregnancy scare, ramdam ko ang takot ni Sunshine"
Sunshine,1490,4,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Yung pagkabalisa at pag-ukit ng konsensya kapag nakahiga sa kama
Sunshine,1490,5,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Yung konsensyang lalong lumalalim kapag may mahinang katok sa pinto
Sunshine,1490,6,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Ito na siguro ang pelikula na kung ang younger self ko ang makakapanood, hindi niya magugustuhan na nakakarelate ako kay Sunshine"

Sunshine,1490,13,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Ang karakter ni Sunshine ay nakaangkla sa batang pasulpot-sulpot
Sunshine,1490,14,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Para sa akin, inner child niya ‘yon"
Sunshine,1490,15,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Pero may kasama akong nanood na nagsabing baka konsensya niya raw 'yon
Sunshine,1490,16,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Pwede rin
Sunshine,1490,17,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Tingin ko inner child niya 'yon, dahil sa tricycle scene, duguan rin ang hita ng bata"
Sunshine,1490,18,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Na para bang sinasabi na kung iniinda ni Sunshine ang sakit at pilipit ng puson, dama rin yon ng inner child niya"
Sunshine,1490,21,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Maliban doon, gusto ko rin i-emphasize kung gaano ka poetic ng eksena"
Sunshine,1490,22,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Naka higa sa hita ng bata si Sunshine na nag-aagaw-buhay

Sunshine,1490,26,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang rason naman kung bakit daw konsensya ni Sunshine ang bata, ay dahil sa eksena sa ospital"
Sunshine,1490,27,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Galit na galit ang bata kay Sunshine at hinahanap niya si Ariana, isa ring batang pasulpot-sulpot"
Sunshine,1490,28,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Ineexplain ni Sunshine na okay na si Mary Grace pero ang importante para sa kanya ay si Ariana, na nawawala"
Sunshine,1490,29,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Nawala na ba si Ariana dahil nawala na rin ang dinadala ni Mary Grace
Sunshine,1490,30,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Pero sa kabila ng lahat, matapang si Sunshine"
Sunshine,1490,31,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Doon sa unang hospital scene, kita mong may hiyang nararamdaman si Sunshine"
Sunshine,1490,32,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Pero dahil sa trauma at pagkalito, sunod lang siya sa pinagsasabi ng overly righteous na doktora"
Sunshine,1490,33,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Hanggang sa napuno si Sunshine
Sunshine,1490,34,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Isa sa pinaka-paborito kong linya niya ay nang tanungin niya ang doktora: ""Para saan"
Sunshine,1490,35,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,""" Na para bang may panghuhusga rin si Sunshine sa kanya"
Sunshine,1490,36,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Ang daming layers ng pelikulang ‘to
Sunshine,1490,37,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi lang siya tungkol sa isang babae
Sunshine,1490,38,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Kwento ito ng pinagdadaanan ng isang babae sa isang bansa na binigo at binibigo ang mga kababaihan na magkaroon ng karapatan na magdesisyon para sa katawan nila
Sunshine,1490,39,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Nagbabago na ang panahon
Sunshine,1490,40,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi na dapat taboo ang usapin ng sex at sex education
Sunshine,1490,41,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Higit sa lahat, ang mga batang gaya ni Mary Grace ang pinaka bulnerable sa lahat"
Sunshine,1490,42,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Ramdam ko rin si Mary Grace
Sunshine,1490,43,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Ano ang laban ng isang 13-year-old sa isang Uncle Bobot

Sunshine,1490,45,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,At dapat lang na basagan ng bote sa ulo ang mga kagaya nila
Sunshine,1490,46,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,"Maraming kagaya ni Mary Grace, nananahimik lang, natatakot"
Sunshine,1490,47,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Kaya nga ang pelikula at kwentong ito ay magandang halimbawa ng quote na:“Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable
Sunshine,1490,48,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,” Mahusay
Sunshine,1490,50,thearchivestaff,,200.0,ltbx,Truly a landmark film
Sunshine,1491,1,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,We are introduced to Sunshine through her warming up with other student-athletes and performing her routine for the upcoming Olympic team tryouts
Sunshine,1491,2,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,"Viewers can tell that her prowess and national team member status is a mix of talent and hard work, that even when she messes up halfway through, it doesn't make her any less of a great gymnast"
Sunshine,1491,3,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,"When she first finds out that she is pregnant, the camera focuses on her hands tremble"
Sunshine,1491,4,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,"But she immediately acts on it – searching for suspicious dealers for pills, telling the boy that knocked her up, and going to church to pray that the Lord takes away the being forming in her womb – even when we see glimpses of her trying not to lose her composure in the humid streets of Manila"
Sunshine,1491,5,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,"The film shows and justifies Sunshine's reasons for wanting an abortion, even if the means available in the Philippines will harm her"
Sunshine,1491,6,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,"She has dreams that can't be put on hold, and she clearly is a young girl with mannerisms and tendencies deemed ""immature"" – factors that do not make her fit to be a mother"
Sunshine,1491,7,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,"But in a scene wherein she talks to a pastor (played by Piolo Pascual, who made everyone in my cinema gasp) that promises financial support throughout her pregnancy and motherhood, she rejects it"
Sunshine,1491,8,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,"""Ayoko maging nanay,"" she says, plain and simple"
Sunshine,1491,9,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,"That was my favorite part of the film, because it felt cathartic to hear it"
Sunshine,1491,10,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,"Although Sunshine had good reasons for the choices she makes, we must not need to have justified, valid, and layered reasons for wanting an abortion"
Sunshine,1491,11,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,"Some of us do not want to be mothers and undergo the medical complications that come with carrying a child, just because"
Sunshine,1491,12,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,I hope that it has more time to stay in cinemas
Sunshine,1491,13,aphrod,,160.0,ltbx,"I hope that more people see it, and by the time the credits roll, sana ma-gets niyo na kami"

Sunshine,1499,1,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"The body of the story may be about Sunshine, but its soul revolves around Menggay"
Sunshine,1499,2,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"From the moment the official trailer dropped, Sunshine instantly captured my interest"
Sunshine,1499,3,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"I’ve been waiting ever since for the chance to see it and after months of anticipation, I finally did"
Sunshine,1499,4,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"And now, I can say this without hesitation: I have nothing but praises for the film"
Sunshine,1499,5,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"More than just well-made, Sunshine is a brave and necessary work"
Sunshine,1499,6,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s a film that demands to be seen — not only because of Maris Racal’s powerful performance, but because of how urgent and relevant its message is in today’s world"
Sunshine,1499,7,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"Unlike other films that leave you in feel-good state when the credits roll, Sunshine leaves you with questions — difficult, uncomfortable questions that deserve to be brought into the open"
Sunshine,1499,8,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,What if women had better options
Sunshine,1499,9,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,What if men received the same public scrutiny when it comes to unwanted pregnancies
Sunshine,1499,10,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,What if we had a healthcare and justice system that actually protects girls like Menggay
Sunshine,1499,11,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"What if we dared to talk about abortion in a way that invites honest, compassionate, and informed discussion"
Sunshine,1499,12,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,This is where the film finds its power
Sunshine,1499,13,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"When Menggay’s story arc unfolds, that’s when Sunshine cements its message, it stops being just a film and starts becoming a mirror to reality"
Sunshine,1499,14,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,Because this is for the countless Menggays out there — young girls with no real choices
Sunshine,1499,15,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,Mga batang gaya niya
Sunshine,1499,16,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,Isang 13-anyos na tinanggalan ng karapatan ng mismong sariling pamilya
Sunshine,1499,17,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,And the painful truth is: there are far too many Menggays in our country
Sunshine,1499,19,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,Deprived of opportunities
Sunshine,1499,20,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,Denied the chance to choose a safer path forward
Sunshine,1499,21,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,Watching this film taught me to become more open-minded
Sunshine,1499,22,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"It urged me to weigh both the pros and cons of abortion more critically, and to consider how we can use art as a tool for education and awareness"
Sunshine,1499,23,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"In the end, Sunshine is not just a film — it’s a challenge"
Sunshine,1499,24,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"A challenge to our government to craft better, more inclusive campaigns"
Sunshine,1499,25,convincent,,180.0,ltbx,"Ones that don’t just resonate with the intellectuals but reach the grassroots, where change is most needed"
Sunshine,1500,1,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"After two decades in the industry, Antoinette Jadaone has cemented her capacity to bend, direct, and write with different genres — the deconstruction of ekstras with Lilia Cuntapay, the ironic and hilarious takedown of cosmetic surgery industry with Belo-approved meta-comedy “Beauty in a Bottle,” and the dialogue-driven romantic hugot dramas with ‘Tadhana"
Sunshine,1500,2,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"” Without a doubt, Jadaone stands as one of the most vital voices in Philippine filmmaking today, consistently challenging conventions and pushing Filipino Cinema forward"
Sunshine,1500,3,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"In all her films, one thing that’s notable she's put women's voices at the forefront"
Sunshine,1500,4,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"She has since taken a pandemic pause after Fan Girl, but this has also led to her researching and diving deep into her most recent film, Sunshine"
Sunshine,1500,5,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"The film follows a student gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal), who discovers she’s pregnant just as she’s about to compete for the SEA Games"
Sunshine,1500,6,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"The film takes a surreal turn when she encounters a kid/ alter ego appears in crisis moments, reflecting her inner turmoil as she faces societal judgment"
Sunshine,1500,7,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"Throughout the film, Sunshine’s emotional arc—marked by anguish, desperation, and vulnerability—lays bare the reality where women’s access to safe choices is morally questioned and legally denied"
Sunshine,1500,8,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"This taboo isolates her: abandoned by friends and her partner, judged by doctors, and pressured by her coach to give up her dreams"
Sunshine,1500,9,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"Social stigma is one, but the films also highlights how poverty and consequently, sexual miseducation put into question the dignity of women"
Sunshine,1500,10,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"To be able to choose freely, is too high of a cost for Sunshine who has to deal with its social, financial, and legal repercussions"
Sunshine,1500,11,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,The film understands how for women in the fringes there’s little to no choice
Sunshine,1500,12,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,The film is not without hope
Sunshine,1500,13,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"Her sister, who’s a single mother, grounds Sunshine"
Sunshine,1500,14,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,Her alter ego serves as emotional salve during her many crises
Sunshine,1500,15,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,And she also chances upon an underaged girl months into her pregnancy who reflects and echoes her experiences
Sunshine,1500,16,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"In each of them, Jadaone realizes Sunshine’s future: to be a single mother, carry her pregnancy to term, and have a daughter"
Sunshine,1500,17,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,The film effectively wrestles with the nuances of her situation: to choose her dreams or be with a child
Sunshine,1500,18,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"Ironically, Sunshine occasionally stumbles under the weight of its many themes: its surreal elements and side characters threaten to overshadow Sunshine’s emotional arc"
Sunshine,1500,19,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"It makes one wonder how better the film would have been had it just been, as the film title suggested, about Sunshine"
Sunshine,1500,20,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"Nevertheless, the film is a showcase of Jadaone’s confident vision"
Sunshine,1500,21,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,There’s this wonderful scene in the film of a maternity ward that just for brief moment became a community for pregnant women and mothers helping and supporting one another
Sunshine,1500,22,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"It epitomizes the warmth that carries Sunshine forward: from isolation to solidarity, and from uncertainty to self-understanding"
Sunshine,1500,23,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,"Parting with her past, she talks to her alter ego hoping she’d understand"
Sunshine,1500,24,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,They hug
Sunshine,1500,25,mfcarandang,,160.0,ltbx,To be understood that’s just what Sunshine needed

Sunshine,1504,3,fahyve,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s direct, like a slap in the face, exposing the reality of teenage pregnancy, women’s health and rights, and the importance of abortion, especially in the Philippines"
Sunshine,1504,4,fahyve,,200.0,ltbx,The right approach in a conservative country that refuses to acknowledge such societal problems and chooses to remain ignorant for the sake of religion
Sunshine,1505,1,gengen,,200.0,ltbx,Ang galing ng casting at sa lahat ng bumuo ng pelikulang ito
Sunshine,1505,2,gengen,,200.0,ltbx,Maraming salamat sa pelikulang tamang timpla ng tapang at awareness (Manabat 2025) dahil alam naman nating sobrang sensitibo ng usapin na ganito sa bansa pero naipakita at naipaliwanag nang maayos ng materyal na to na ang desisyon ay dapat naka- base sa mga babae at hindi galing sa ibang tao
Sunshine,1505,3,gengen,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi lang naipakita kundi naiparamdam din nito ang tunay na pinagdaraanan ng bawat babaeng biktima sa mga ganitong sitwasyon
Sunshine,1505,4,gengen,,200.0,ltbx,Ang reyalidad ng mga babae na piniling magpatuloy at maging matapang

Sunshine,1505,12,gengen,,200.0,ltbx,"Para sa akin, masasabi ko na ito ang magandang pelikula"
Sunshine,1505,13,gengen,,200.0,ltbx,"May paliwanag, may wakas at solusyon yung problemang tinalakay sa pelikula"

Sunshine,1507,2,danaladano,,180.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone gave a voice to experiences of young women facing teenage pregnancy

Sunshine,1508,2,iamsuperjosef,,200.0,ltbx,It’s powerful that a story like this is finally being told in a predominantly conservative and traditional country like the Philippines
Sunshine,1508,3,iamsuperjosef,,200.0,ltbx,It’s no surprise that it took a while for a film with this theme to make it into the mainstream
Sunshine,1508,4,iamsuperjosef,,200.0,ltbx,"Still, from beginning to end, I stood by Sunshine, even when she made mistakes"
Sunshine,1508,5,iamsuperjosef,,200.0,ltbx,"That’s what made me root for her, especially in the final scenes"

Sunshine,1509,1,lucasjaden,,180.0,ltbx,sa sobrang ganda yung nanay kong anti abortion ay nagustuhan yung message ng pelikula very well written

Sunshine,1509,3,lucasjaden,,180.0,ltbx,ang GALENGG anyways mothered without being a mother love you papa p
Sunshine,1510,1,prdgldd,,,ltbx,Alam kong napakahalaga ng pelikulang ito sa kababaihan pero ang hiling ko ay sana mas maraming kalalakihan ang makapanood nito
Sunshine,1510,2,prdgldd,,,ltbx,Ang misogyny at patriyarka ay mga problemang dulot naming mga lalaki
Sunshine,1510,3,prdgldd,,,ltbx,Matibay ang paniniwala kong kami ang dapat may pinakamalaking ambag sa pagbubuwag ng mga ito
Sunshine,1510,4,prdgldd,,,ltbx,Dapat kami ang nagpepenitensya
Sunshine,1510,5,prdgldd,,,ltbx,Pero hindi ganito ang realidad
Sunshine,1510,6,prdgldd,,,ltbx,"Mga babae tulad ni Sunshine, Menggay, at ang maraming babae sa pelikulang ito ang bumabaka at nagdurusa sa ilalim ng huwad na sistema"
Sunshine,1510,7,prdgldd,,,ltbx,Tila habambuhay silang nagpepenitensya para sa isang kasalanang hindi matubos-tubos kahit pa anong gawin nila—ang kasalanan ng pagiging babae
Sunshine,1510,8,prdgldd,,,ltbx,"Mahusay ang pagpapakita ng Sunshine sa iba't ibang impyernong dinaranas ng kababaihan: personal, panlipunan, pisikal, mental, pinansyal, sekswal, at, higit sa lahat, pulitikal"
Sunshine,1510,9,prdgldd,,,ltbx,"Ramdam ito sa bawat eksena kung saan galit, pag-aalala, at pagod ang namamayagpag sa mga linya, ekspresyon, imahe, at tunog"
Sunshine,1510,10,prdgldd,,,ltbx,"Pati nga mismo ang kalagayan nito bilang pelikula ay isang impyerno rin: ang masalimuot na danas nina Direk Tonet sa paghahanap ng distributor, ang katotohanang madalang abutin ng mga ganitong pelikula ang mainstream consciousness ng mga Pilipno, ang mabilis na pagliit ng bilang ng mga sinehan na nagpapalabas nito, at ang nagbabadyang diskurso na tiyak na magiging mapaghati"
Sunshine,1510,11,prdgldd,,,ltbx,"Samakatuwid, ang pelikula mismo ay dumaan at patuloy na dadaan sa impyernong ginawa ng patriyarka"
Sunshine,1510,12,prdgldd,,,ltbx,"Ipinapakita ng Sunshine na mula noon hanggang ngayon, kababaihan ang umaako sa responsibilidad na hamunin at buwagin ang patriyarka"
Sunshine,1510,13,prdgldd,,,ltbx,"Kaya sana mapanood ito ng mas marami pang lalaki, lalo na kung hindi pa sila mulat sa realidad ng kababaihan, mga batang ina, at mga biktima ng sekswal na karahasan"
Sunshine,1510,14,prdgldd,,,ltbx,Tayong mga lalaki ang nag-imbento at nakikinabang sa patriyarka
Sunshine,1510,15,prdgldd,,,ltbx,"Tayo ang may kasalanan, tayo ang dapat magpenitensya"

Sunshine,1511,10,betterthanniela,,200.0,ltbx,Men will always miss the damn point
Sunshine,1511,11,betterthanniela,,200.0,ltbx,"Para sa’yo, simple ang point ng pelikula: as long as the system is patriarchal, it will continue to fail women"
Sunshine,1511,12,betterthanniela,,200.0,ltbx,Takot tayo sa mga bagay na hindi natin naiintindihan
Sunshine,1511,13,betterthanniela,,200.0,ltbx,"Pero hindi porke't hindi mo naiintindihan, ibig sabihin hindi na totoo"

Sunshine,1515,1,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,i knew i had to watch this before this film disappears off the face of the earth like gitling did
Sunshine,1515,2,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,no regrets because this might be antoinette jadaone’s magnum opus yet
Sunshine,1515,3,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,sunshine (2025) had no metaphors and subtle parallelisms: it screams that a woman’s autonomy is her own
Sunshine,1515,4,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"a very straight-forward, well-thought of, and a passionate piece about how a woman was made to struggle the moment she was born by the system and how it’s designed to take away her ownnes"
Sunshine,1515,5,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,this is true for everywhere else in the world; but much more significant in the context of a third world country such as the philippines
Sunshine,1515,6,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"abortion is a controversial topic in the country, to say the least"
Sunshine,1515,7,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,it is seen as a violation to the sanctity of life—a sin to remove a clump of cell in a human body
Sunshine,1515,8,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"swayed by the biblical texts and the catholic church, abortion is illegal in the country"
Sunshine,1515,9,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"but for women like sunshine and mary grace, the law does little to stop the reality: it only pushes them to do the act in shadows, where the only option is unsafe and risky"
Sunshine,1515,10,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,the religious references throughout the film were palpable: from the jeepney that sunshine rode to quiapo bearing the sign that says “gift of God” to sunshine’s physical manifestation of her conscience in the form of her would-be child—which shows an inner conflict between her faith and survival
Sunshine,1515,11,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,these references do not seem disrespectful but rather an emphasis on how deeply stitched sunshine’s struggle to catholicism is
Sunshine,1515,12,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,it’s a critique on how the bible is weaponized to police a woman’s choices and her bodily autonomy
Sunshine,1515,13,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"i want to make a point on the healthcare system too which the film really did a good job criticizing: with all its faults, the healthcare system is biased against women"
Sunshine,1515,14,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"the lack of access to safe procedures, institutional neglect, and moral policing (made by professionals, mind you) leave women like sunshine and mary grace with nowhere to turn"
Sunshine,1515,15,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,the lack of quality healthcare in the country is so normalized that it leaves everyone no dignified options to address even their basic needs
Sunshine,1515,16,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"a perfect film that paints intersectionality so well: women from different sectors, despite having the same oppressor, face different realities"
Sunshine,1515,17,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,it did not sensationalize abortion but it gave the audience another angle to look at it from; in a perspective that’s raw and honest
Sunshine,1515,18,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"i was crying at the end (#that scene) because in spite all this, she prevailed"
Sunshine,1515,19,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"a woman, in a system that set her up to fail, survived and lived to achieve her dreams"
Sunshine,1515,20,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"overall, sunshine (2025) was hopeful, important, and full of courage"
Sunshine,1515,21,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"an important film that must be seen by everyone (and more importantly, by women)"
Sunshine,1515,22,salingpusa,,200.0,ltbx,"maris racal, you are a generational talent, you deserve all the flowers AND jennica garcia, this piece’s hidden gem, you have mothered on a scale no one has ever had before"

Sunshine,1525,2,paulsambas,,180.0,ltbx,"It was a brave story of strength, love, and kindness"
Sunshine,1525,3,paulsambas,,180.0,ltbx,"Yet it was also sharp, honest in its portrayal of the harsh realities young Filipina women often endure: the limits imposed on their bodies, their choices, their futures"
Sunshine,1525,4,paulsambas,,180.0,ltbx,"And still, it was warm"
Sunshine,1525,5,paulsambas,,180.0,ltbx,It never allowed you to drown in despair
Sunshine,1525,6,paulsambas,,180.0,ltbx,"Instead, it held you with care, gently reminding you that even in the most shadowed and uncertain places, light still finds its way in"
Sunshine,1525,7,paulsambas,,180.0,ltbx,"Just like its title, Sunshine felt like light breaking through, like a quiet kind of hope that chooses to stay"

Sunshine,1526,5,thesuperkayo,,160.0,ltbx,Bigotry and victim-blaming play a huge part in our society
Sunshine,1526,6,thesuperkayo,,160.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone doesn’t tiptoe or walk around with her message: she is loud, angry, and knows where she stands"
Sunshine,1526,7,thesuperkayo,,160.0,ltbx,"Her direction is both observational and sympathetic, allowing the audience to feel for Sunshine and feel helpless in situations out of our control"
Sunshine,1526,8,thesuperkayo,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite all of these, it’s an incredibly hopeful movie about choice"

Sunshine,1530,1,ellias209,,180.0,ltbx,Gusto ko sakin ka lang by Robledo Timido playing in the background while Sunshine is having her moment sa jeep is a peak cinema experience
Sunshine,1531,1,_g4briel,,200.0,ltbx,I would say that the film truly brings you to the experience on how hard it is to be a woman in the Philippines
Sunshine,1531,2,_g4briel,,200.0,ltbx,"From how the scenes were shot, to how the environment felt raw, how the catcalls, noise, and the crowd sounded so real"
Sunshine,1531,3,_g4briel,,200.0,ltbx,"I think the film perfectly captures the Filipino experience in tackling the issue of abortion, and handled it in a way that gives an insight to both sides while still ultimately leading to a decision in the end"
Sunshine,1531,4,_g4briel,,200.0,ltbx,I would argue that this is Jadaone and Racal's magnum opus to date
Sunshine,1532,1,angel_exe,,180.0,ltbx,Biggest fear ko when I see films that are “too woke” (like ones about reproductive autonomy) is that they only end up sparking discourse in echo chambers — na tayo-tayo nanaman ang magjajakulan over our left-leaning beliefs
Sunshine,1532,2,angel_exe,,180.0,ltbx,It’s a good thing Sunshine (2024) strays from that kind of narrative
Sunshine,1532,3,angel_exe,,180.0,ltbx,"It just tells a story and somehow, that hits even harder"

Sunshine,1539,2,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Kapag dala mo pa rin ito hanggang sa pagtulog mo, ibig sabihin ay maganda ang pagkakagawa"
Sunshine,1539,3,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"At kung pagising mo'y ito pa rin ang laman ng isip mo, isa itong tunay na obra maestra"

Sunshine,1539,10,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Naiipakita niya ang mga struggle at kahinaan naming mga babae, pero kasabay nito, naipapakita rin niya kung paanong buong tapang naming niyayakap ang aming pagkababae"
Sunshine,1539,11,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"At sa pelikulang ito, mas lalo niyang pinatunayan kung gaano siya kagaling bilang direktor"
Sunshine,1539,12,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Alam ko nang magiging maganda ito, mula pa lang sa premise at trailer, kuhang-kuha na niya ako"

Sunshine,1539,14,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Panahon na, sa tingin ko, para kilalanin si Direk Tonet bilang isa sa mga haligi ng pelikulang Pilipino"
Sunshine,1539,15,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang pelikulang ito ang magbubukas ng daan para mas mapansin siya hindi lang bilang direktor ng rom-com, kundi bilang isang seryoso at malalim na haligi ng sining at dakilang manunulat"
Sunshine,1539,16,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Bawat shot, pinag-isipan"
Sunshine,1539,17,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi lang basta kinuha para lang sa aesthetic

Sunshine,1539,36,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi lang nito binunyag ang mapait na realidad ng mga kababaihan, pero ipinakita rin nito kung paanong ang mga babae ay kayang maging unapologetically passionate sa mga gusto namin sa buhay, sa mga pangarap namin"
Sunshine,1539,37,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,Dagdag na rin ang pasilip kung gaano kahirap na itinatawid ng mga atletang Pilipino ang buhay sa loob at labas ng pagsasanay

Sunshine,1539,45,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa aspetong pisikal pa lang, talo na kami"
Sunshine,1539,46,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Kaya kung maaari, bigyan man lang sana ng puwang ang aming mga karapatan na matagal na namin hinihiling na pagbigyan"
Sunshine,1539,47,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang dali-daling talikuran ng lalaki ang responsibilidad, pero sa babae"
Sunshine,1539,48,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Kami ang nagdadala ng lahat ng iniwan na pinsala mapa-mental, pinansyal, emosyonal, sosyal, at lalong lalo na sa pisikal"
Sunshine,1539,49,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang pelikulang ito ay isang mahigpit na yakap para sa kababaihan, at isang mata na bumubulaga sa mga nananatiling bulag sa mga hinaing at karapatang matagal na naming ipinaglalaban"
Sunshine,1539,50,darthbea,,200.0,ltbx,Ito ang klase ng mga pelikulang minsan lang dumating sa ating buhay at siguradong mananatiling relevant sa mga susunod pang taon
Sunshine,1540,1,lemuel99,,140.0,ltbx,Loved it
Sunshine,1540,2,lemuel99,,140.0,ltbx,The opening set how heavy the premise will be but for me personally I would've liked it better if they made different choices on how they portrayed the other kid and both of the kids language and I felt like the opening was quite contradicting with the humor

Sunshine,1556,2,bin_ondo,,200.0,ltbx,"honestly, she is a strong and a resilient girl"
Sunshine,1556,3,bin_ondo,,200.0,ltbx,"maris played the character really well, that you could feel her problems' weight and her emotions stacking all together, plus the pressure of being a national player for the olympics"
Sunshine,1556,4,bin_ondo,,200.0,ltbx,"the scene in the film that tied a really tight knot in my stomach is the chase scene with sunshine and the 13 year old girl near lrt recto, that is where the problem would shift not only for sunshine but in a general manner, that this happens, everyday, and everywhere, as long as there are men with lustful power and bad intentions"

Sunshine,1558,4,lalicefilms_,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi ito pag-romanticize ng abortion
Sunshine,1558,5,lalicefilms_,,200.0,ltbx,"Ito ay pagtindig sa matagal nang pinapatay na diskurso tungkol sa maling ideolohiya, diskriminasyon, at ang paulit-ulit na pagkundena sa kakayahan ng babae na magdesisyon para sa sarili"
Sunshine,1558,6,lalicefilms_,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang bigat ng mga eksena, pero ang galing — kasi ang gaan nitong naipaintindi"

Sunshine,1561,3,bmanalastas,,180.0,ltbx,She gave it all for this
Sunshine,1561,4,bmanalastas,,180.0,ltbx,The movie is full of different emotions

Sunshine,1567,2,sumirerien,,140.0,ltbx,But I feel like the reviews it’s getting are more for what it stands for than how it was actually executed
Sunshine,1567,3,sumirerien,,140.0,ltbx,The story and the lead felt a bit weak
Sunshine,1567,4,sumirerien,,140.0,ltbx,I wanted more
Sunshine,1567,5,sumirerien,,140.0,ltbx,"Still, it’s worth watching for the conversation it starts"
Sunshine,1568,1,sobrangpelikula,,200.0,ltbx,"A film about abortion that is so beautiful that it makes me proud to recommend this film to anyone regardless of their stance in abortion, most especially in a very catholic-dominated society"
Sunshine,1568,2,sobrangpelikula,,200.0,ltbx,It spoke so loudly to me of how a woman's life could change from bearing a child in your womb
Sunshine,1568,3,sobrangpelikula,,200.0,ltbx,"it could shatter your dreams, make your life critical, or give you a life you have always wanted- to become a mother"
Sunshine,1568,4,sobrangpelikula,,200.0,ltbx,"Annika, the bata, as a narrative device to signify conscience of Sunshine was Jadaone's wonderful choice to gently discuss a sensitive topic such as abortion without deafening the fetus inside of a pregnant woman"
Sunshine,1568,5,sobrangpelikula,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine was a cinematic storytelling of coming to a decision, with never-ending to contradictions with your conscience and peeking through jalousies of other people's similar but different narratives, to come to a choice for yourself, as a woman"
Sunshine,1570,1,eyowen,,,ltbx,"a film about special people who live a rather normal life, amidst the chaotic yet beautiful, neon-lit street life of manila, filled with a heartwarming sense of humanity"
Sunshine,1570,2,eyowen,,,ltbx,"having only seen 'six degrees of separation from lilia cuntapay', i think i can say that direk tonet gets it, she treats her characters in a way that makes us care and relate with them in one way or another; i may not be pregnant like sunshine, but i very much live in the same society as her"
Sunshine,1570,3,eyowen,,,ltbx,"the director doesn't glorify or romanticize the world in which sunshine, and we, live in—it is depicted in an achingly honest way, and therefore brutal"
Sunshine,1570,4,eyowen,,,ltbx,and maris racal is able to assimilate (
Sunshine,1570,5,eyowen,,,ltbx,") in this world built around her character, she was phenomenal in portraying this character in such a manner that is raw and tender; most notable in scenes depending on non-verbal dialogue"
Sunshine,1570,6,eyowen,,,ltbx,"although, said scenes are probably my favorite among the entire film, most of them fall short on an emotional level—just as the emotions are about to hit a gut punch, the scene is cut off"
Sunshine,1570,7,eyowen,,,ltbx,"by all means, this is not a perfect film"
Sunshine,1570,8,eyowen,,,ltbx,"still, it doesn't take away from the very real and grounded moving story that is sunshine"

Sunshine,1571,13,_laborem,,200.0,ltbx,"she's not sure if what she's doing is right, but she does it anyway, because no one's there to guide her"

Sunshine,1582,8,legendaryl06,,180.0,ltbx,We see her struggles pitted against conservativism and arguable morality in a country where religion and patriarchy rule and shackle
Sunshine,1582,9,legendaryl06,,180.0,ltbx,"Through magic realism where we are introduced to two young players who abruptly show up mid-scenes, the film gets a rich layer on how our lead navigates her perilous journey"
Sunshine,1582,10,legendaryl06,,180.0,ltbx,They channel the moral compass though at times their appearances and comedic flair tend to be uneven and out of timing
Sunshine,1582,11,legendaryl06,,180.0,ltbx,"Racal, with her sharp strength and vulnerability, is utterly commendable but so is her supporting cast - Jennica Garcia and Meryl Soriano as her strong-willed yet nurturing older sister and coach respectively, Annika Co as her unborn child manifestation (an unpredictable plot twist that eventually made sense), and even the cameos from Madeleine Nicolas, Angeli Bayani, Angie Castrence, Elijah Canlas, and Piolo Pascual fulfill their impressive character actor repertoire"
Sunshine,1582,12,legendaryl06,,180.0,ltbx,Some arcs and scenes could have been fleshed out because it's got a premise worth exploring but the Philippine censorship may have played its upper hand to prevent the film's full bloom
Sunshine,1582,13,legendaryl06,,180.0,ltbx,"In the same vein of ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days"", ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"", and ""Happening"", it may not be everyone's cup of tea due to its hefty topic and open-endedness but it's a delight to see an important Filipino film that fearlessly opens the conversation to empower women more on making their own reproductive choices, even with the deafening noise and outdated discourse"
Sunshine,1582,18,legendaryl06,,180.0,ltbx,"5/5, folks"
Sunshine,1582,19,legendaryl06,,180.0,ltbx,"Winner of The Crystal Bear Award in the Generation 14plus category at the 75th Berlinale - Berlin International Film Festival, ""SUNSHINE"" is now exclusively playing in SM Cinemas, rated R-16 without cuts"

Sunshine,1588,2,gabryanz,,160.0,ltbx,"throughout the narrative, sunshine traverses between significant juxtapositions: of what is deemed ""sacred"" and ""sinful,"" of noise and silence, and of the boundaries of life and death"
Sunshine,1588,3,gabryanz,,160.0,ltbx,"the film's grounding into the grittiness of its locale gives depth not just to the narrative, but to the characters"

Sunshine,1591,5,shanslayyy,,200.0,ltbx,"Remember crying in a few scenes just because of how real it felt and then that sudden realization hits me, and I remember — nangyayari talaga siya sa totoong buhay yet it's inadequately addressed"
Sunshine,1591,6,shanslayyy,,200.0,ltbx,"Alienated, discriminated, and hidden behind idols and symbols stained with shame like the Sunshines and Menggays who are forced to comply with the rules set by a patriarchal, hypocritical, conservative society"

Sunshine,1619,41,sanenotsane,,200.0,ltbx,"She stayed outside and prayed, and that choice said so much"
Sunshine,1619,42,sanenotsane,,200.0,ltbx,It was symbolic
Sunshine,1619,43,sanenotsane,,200.0,ltbx,It showed how distant she probably felt from her faith or how unworthy she thought she was in that moment
Sunshine,1619,44,sanenotsane,,200.0,ltbx,That kind of framing really hit me
Sunshine,1619,45,sanenotsane,,200.0,ltbx,I also appreciated the sound design
Sunshine,1619,46,sanenotsane,,200.0,ltbx,"Instead of dramatic bg music, they focused ambient sounds"

Sunshine,1627,2,jklstq,,180.0,ltbx,"Matapang dahil bilang predominantly catholic country na sobrang na ka-angkla ang paniniwala, mga desisyon, at disposisyon sa buhay sa kung ano ang tama at mali sa bibliya, isang malaking hakbang ang ipakitang tumaliwas sa nakaugalian at kinalakihang ideya ng kung ano ang “tama”"
Sunshine,1627,3,jklstq,,180.0,ltbx,"Matapang dahil sa mundo at sa bansang sobrang patriyarkal na nag c-cater lamang sa kalalakihan, walang pag-uubling pinakita na wala dapat may ibang may karapatan sa katawan at kapakanan ng isang babae kung hindi sila lamang"

Sunshine,1627,19,jklstq,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine is now my favorite maris racal performance which was previously held by peachy of Pamilya Ko
Sunshine,1627,20,jklstq,,180.0,ltbx,I know it’s the bare minimum and literally the point of acting but you can really tell she’s a good actress kasi walang bahid ng kung sino si maris racal sa totoong buhay sa mga karakter na ginagampanan niya
Sunshine,1627,21,jklstq,,180.0,ltbx,Sobrang believable niya as an actress

Sunshine,1647,1,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"THISSS IS CINEMAAAA U GUYS (YAS, edited w/ a short commentary)what i love about sunshine is it never tries to sell the idea that motherhood is innate, pure, or noble"
Sunshine,1647,2,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"instead, it asks the real question paano kung ayaw talaga"
Sunshine,1647,3,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,and it’s so bold to center that lalo na sa context ng pilipinas where everything about being a woman is reduced to sacrifice
Sunshine,1647,4,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"we’re raised to believe na ang katawan natin ay para sa pamilya, para sa pananampalataya, para sa kinabukasan ng iba"
Sunshine,1647,5,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,never para sa sarili
Sunshine,1647,6,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"kaya sobrang rare and sobrang radical makakita ng pelikula na nagsasabing ""hindi mo kailangang gustuhin"
Sunshine,1647,7,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,hindi mo kailangang magpaka-martir
Sunshine,1647,8,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,”sunshine understands na abortion is not some abstract “debate” about morality
Sunshine,1647,9,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,it’s lived
Sunshine,1647,10,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,it’s embodied
Sunshine,1647,11,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,it’s desperate
Sunshine,1647,12,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,and it doesn’t look away from that
Sunshine,1647,13,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,it shows us what women are actually left with when they’re denied safe and legal options
Sunshine,1647,14,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"instructions sa papel, gamot na walang label, pangambang baka mamatay ka sa proseso"
Sunshine,1647,15,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"it doesn’t sensationalize it, but it doesn’t sanitize it either"
Sunshine,1647,16,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,and that’s where the power lies
Sunshine,1647,17,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,the film knows the violence doesn’t start when a woman decides to abort
Sunshine,1647,18,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,it starts when the state tells her she can’t
Sunshine,1647,19,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"when even in the face of trauma, poverty, or kahit simpleng “hindi ko kaya"" o ""ayoko,"" the answer is always “wala tayong magagawa"
Sunshine,1647,20,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,""" sunshine sits with that anger"
Sunshine,1647,21,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,nire-recognize niya na ang lack of choice ay isa lang sa napakaraming anyo o mukha ng systemic violence
Sunshine,1647,22,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,patunay ito of how the law protects an imagined morality while punishing the actual living woman
Sunshine,1647,23,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"and yes, this film is very aware that class makes all the difference"
Sunshine,1647,24,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,hindi lahat may access to private clinics or doctors willing to take the risk
Sunshine,1647,25,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"karamihan, kung hindi lahat, gaya sa pelikula ay sa quiapo ang bagsak"
Sunshine,1647,26,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,o kaya naman hilot
Sunshine,1647,27,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"'yung iba wala talagang means & are forced to be victims of the way laws, culture, and religion collude to trap women into roles they never asked for"
Sunshine,1647,28,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,and that matters
Sunshine,1647,29,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,because the way we talk about abortion in this country is always so detached from those realities
Sunshine,1647,30,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,laging hypothetical
Sunshine,1647,31,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,laging abstract
Sunshine,1647,32,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,laging nakadikit sa spiritual na paniniwala
Sunshine,1647,33,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"but sunshine shows that for many women, hindi lang siya tungkol sa pagkakaroon ng choice o sa moralidad kundi buhay at kaligtasan din nila mismo"
Sunshine,1647,34,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,literal na tinatanggalan sila ng basic human rights
Sunshine,1647,35,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,ang sarap himayin ng pelikulaaa especially 'yung subplot tungkol doon sa 13-yr old girl tapos isampal 'yun sa mukha ng mga taong hindi magawang ilabas ang sarili nila sa personal nilang mga baluktot na paninindigan
Sunshine,1647,36,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,ig the best part for me is how sunshine never tries to justify
Sunshine,1647,37,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"likeee it doesn’t go “look, she had no choice,” or “she’s a victim, kaya understandable"
Sunshine,1647,38,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,” no
Sunshine,1647,39,aegyu,,180.0,ltbx,"it says na kahit may support ka, kahit privilege ka, kahit hindi ka biktima, may karapatan kang pumili"

Sunshine,1666,4,melonmiruku,,200.0,ltbx,"Men continue to crush the dreams of women, whether through abandoning them (ehem Miggy), ruining them (ehem Bobot), and deciding for their future (ehem Pastor Jaime)"

Sunshine,1672,4,gabmellet,,180.0,ltbx,para magkaroon sila ng choice para makapag-desisyon kung ano ang gagawin; hindi yung mapipilitan lang silang gawin yung isang bagay dahil yon lang ung pwedeng gawin—madalas pa'y ito'y delikado para sakanila

Sunshine,1685,2,jkcarandang,,180.0,ltbx,"For it to be played in Philippine cinemas is already a win for the film, on top of the other awards it has received abroad"
Sunshine,1685,3,jkcarandang,,180.0,ltbx,"In terms of the technical aspects, I liked how the film showed the beauty of Manila despite its flaws, how graceful rhythmic gymnastics look like despite being a tough sport, and how the venues mostly used in the film had enough space needed despite being cramped"
Sunshine,1685,4,jkcarandang,,180.0,ltbx,"Story-wise, I like how it tackled the problems of the Philippines in terms of reproductive health, but also showed the pro of being a mother -- or at least having a mother figure by your side"
Sunshine,1685,5,jkcarandang,,180.0,ltbx,"However, while I understand why Sunshine made that decision, I think it somehow lacked that oomph on why she was eventually convinced to do IT"

Sunshine,1707,2,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is not great just because it tackles abortion, it welcomely invites us to be with its titular character"
Sunshine,1707,3,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"Every scene we are with her, and no scene is wasted"
Sunshine,1707,4,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"We know she got big dreams, and it's all she's ever known"

Sunshine,1707,8,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"What sets Sunshine apart is it is set in the Philippines, a predominantly Catholic country"
Sunshine,1707,9,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"From the moment Sunshines wants to know about her status, judgment has already been cast upon her"
Sunshine,1707,10,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,People around her treat her as if she's some sort of contagious disease
Sunshine,1707,11,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"Institutions, who are supposed to provide help, condemns her and gives a long-ass speech as if they're god"
Sunshine,1707,12,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"Yet, she finds a glimpse of hope in the most unlikely of places"
Sunshine,1707,13,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,Direk Tonet has proven to be one of the most versatile and essential modern directors in the Philippines
Sunshine,1707,14,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"From her indie roots to her modern take of romcoms, she consistently has made semi-blockbuster memorable Filipino films"
Sunshine,1707,15,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"In her shift to sociopolitical drama, which already started in Fan Girl (2020), her voice as a female writer-director is clearer than ever"
Sunshine,1707,16,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"Hearing the germ of idea for this film got me intrigued, inspired from Jojo Rabbit (2019)"
Sunshine,1707,17,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"At first, I was skeptical of this borrowed plot device, but it completely won me over and elevated the film in the end"
Sunshine,1707,18,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,Manila is captured as pure as it is
Sunshine,1707,19,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"The score is played at the right moments, and so did pure silence"
Sunshine,1707,20,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"And of course, Maris Racal, the heart of this film"
Sunshine,1707,21,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,A year of training and research for the character paid off
Sunshine,1707,22,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,She is Sunshine through and through
Sunshine,1707,23,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,Her in that motel scene is raw and chilling to say the least
Sunshine,1707,24,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,All the supporting actors and bit roles are just as great and gives life to Sunshine's world
Sunshine,1707,25,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"Jennica Garcia may have a few lines, but her performance especially in that scene with Maris is one to be remembered for, especially for teenage mothers"
Sunshine,1707,26,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"A surprising yet worthy appearance comes from Rhed Bustamante, whose minor role made a huge impact on me—I cried"
Sunshine,1707,27,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine is such a lightning in a bottle kind of Filipino film
Sunshine,1707,28,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,Who would have thought that a great indie pinoy film about abortion is getting this high amount of traction and success
Sunshine,1707,29,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,One's hope is for this to create discussion among us and to move the needle systemically for girls like Sunshine
Sunshine,1707,30,mattcvan,,180.0,ltbx,"(And as a cinephile, I hope more films like this get produced and be seen by Filipinos, because Philippine Cinema has always been alive"

Sunshine,1715,4,ianne_elle,,180.0,ltbx,Making abortion illegal doesn’t make it go away — it only puts women’s lives at greater risk
Sunshine,1715,5,ianne_elle,,180.0,ltbx,"Also, of course, hands down to Maris Racal"
Sunshine,1715,6,ianne_elle,,180.0,ltbx,She portrayed her character really well

Sunshine,1718,6,a11yssa,,200.0,ltbx,this hits so deeply with me as someone who comes from a family that expects that every woman in it have to have their own children someday and as someone who is in the field of healthcare & hoping to practice medicine as an OB-GYN in the PH

Sunshine,1720,3,duannes,,200.0,ltbx,such an important film
Sunshine,1721,2,mangingibig,,200.0,ltbx,This is how I would describe the film
Sunshine,1721,3,mangingibig,,200.0,ltbx,"The way it speaks to and for society, portrays women's experiences, and challenges the pre-existing notions— the societal pressures, religious guilt, patriarchal norms—all were executed perfectly"
Sunshine,1721,4,mangingibig,,200.0,ltbx,One thing that I can't seem to stop thinking about is the personification of Sunshine's troubles
Sunshine,1721,5,mangingibig,,200.0,ltbx,"Some said it could be her conscience, maybe her guilt, maybe it's also the pressures society had brought upon women experiencing the same struggle, but I personally saw it as the personification of the child inside her"
Sunshine,1721,6,mangingibig,,200.0,ltbx,"Kasi as a pregnant woman, one of the top things that she's probably considering the most would be the child (since it has been embeded into us that the child has a life as soon as it's formed)"
Sunshine,1721,7,mangingibig,,200.0,ltbx,Ang galing lang kasi talaga ng portrayal na 'to and it keeps my mind gears churning

Sunshine,1721,11,mangingibig,,200.0,ltbx,I would really only trust movies about women to women
Sunshine,1721,12,mangingibig,,200.0,ltbx,"Props to DIrek Tonet for this, really"

Sunshine,1734,2,ronnivore,,160.0,ltbx,"Her depiction of realist Manila within a predominantly Catholic albeit judgmental Philippines is strikingly affecting, and the first half of this in particular is a worthy showcase of great filmmaking"
Sunshine,1734,3,ronnivore,,160.0,ltbx,"The plot device did take me out of the film from time to time, and I do not think it was necessary nor was it effective"
Sunshine,1734,4,ronnivore,,160.0,ltbx,"Yet, what more can you ask for when you have such a riveting turn from Maris Racal, who puts forward a performance for the ages"

Sunshine,1738,7,auryooow,,180.0,ltbx,damang-dama yung pag-iyak sa jeep at pagmamakaawa sa quiapo church hahahahasana ma-gets din ng mga mamamayang pilipino kung bakit natin kailangan to

Sunshine,1738,11,auryooow,,180.0,ltbx,: sobrang ganda nung shot na nasa hotel room si sunshine tapos nakaupo lang siya habang may dumadaan na tren sa likod

Sunshine,1739,6,mirakeol,,200.0,ltbx,"i wish i could articulate my thoughts about the movie but i’m at an absolute loss for words :( DIREK TONET, THE WOMAN THAT YOU ARE"
Sunshine,1739,7,mirakeol,,200.0,ltbx,all i can say is that this film will…
Sunshine,1740,1,ham6in,,100.0,ltbx,Kaboses ni direk tonette yung coach ni maris or ako lang ba
Sunshine,1741,1,horch4ta,,200.0,ltbx,"mahal kita, sunshine"

Sunshine,1743,1,richelja,,180.0,ltbx,"not the best, but the most realistic"
Sunshine,1744,1,rayorrei,,180.0,ltbx,Second watch and that scene in the clinic still knocked the air out of me
Sunshine,1744,2,rayorrei,,180.0,ltbx,"I knew it was coming, but it hit just as hard"
Sunshine,1744,3,rayorrei,,180.0,ltbx,Rhed doesn’t even need lines to destroy you
Sunshine,1744,4,rayorrei,,180.0,ltbx,Maris is holding everything in like she’s seconds away from breaking
Sunshine,1744,5,rayorrei,,180.0,ltbx,This movie doesn’t try to be sad—it just is

Sunshine,1747,1,sunchasing,,180.0,ltbx,sunshine gets me SO BAD
Sunshine,1747,2,sunchasing,,180.0,ltbx,"apart from being a woman– but also as a dancer, a sister, and ultimately a dreamerthe roles she acted out were fairly distributed, mainly siguro of the mental dilemmas that came with making her decisions"
Sunshine,1747,3,sunchasing,,180.0,ltbx,"like the peptalks before dancing a routine, the eye contact with her sister ensuring her support, the firmness of getting rid of the baby"
Sunshine,1747,4,sunchasing,,180.0,ltbx,LEGIT CRAZYY seeing the rawness of it all
Sunshine,1747,5,sunchasing,,180.0,ltbx,"to think that these experiences aren't even new– just ones that are drowned out cuz it's easier to advise people to follow societal norms, when life is realllyyyy really much more complexhands down on how this film amplifies the woman experience without shouting all over your face"
Sunshine,1747,6,sunchasing,,180.0,ltbx,i'm all for dealing with the consequences of our actions– but there's really so so many ways to be responsible for it
Sunshine,1748,2,nizeljemm_,,160.0,ltbx,I watched last Saturday pero andun pa rin kaluluwa ko sa sinehan
Sunshine,1748,3,nizeljemm_,,160.0,ltbx,Andami ko gusto kong sabihin pero hanggang ngayon speechless pa rin ako
Sunshine,1748,4,nizeljemm_,,160.0,ltbx,"Pero ito sure ako, dadalhin kita na para bang pagtindig natin para sa pag-asa nung 2022 election"
Sunshine,1748,5,nizeljemm_,,160.0,ltbx,Mahirap maging babae pero parang mas mahirap manatiling tahimik
Sunshine,1749,1,shaiilatte,,140.0,ltbx,"choosing motherhood is noble, but so is pursuing your dream"
Sunshine,1750,1,hanelya__,,160.0,ltbx,"the world is unforgiving to womenlike the corners of manila that bore witness to sunshine and her quiet struggle, like the santo niños in quiapo that hide fatality, a risk to escape a life that was never theirs to carry"
Sunshine,1750,2,hanelya__,,160.0,ltbx,like the church that stands in the midst of relentless shame
Sunshine,1750,3,hanelya__,,160.0,ltbx,"the world is unforgiving to women, where desire is almost always consequence for who were born to bear its fruit yet never a sliver of guilt from those who took part in it"
Sunshine,1750,4,hanelya__,,160.0,ltbx,the world is unforgiving to women yet it expects so much
Sunshine,1750,5,hanelya__,,160.0,ltbx,so much burden to carry
Sunshine,1750,6,hanelya__,,160.0,ltbx,so much life to spend carrying
Sunshine,1750,7,hanelya__,,160.0,ltbx,"with only sisters, other women, to carry it with, to lighten the load"
Sunshine,1750,8,hanelya__,,160.0,ltbx,rarely has a film induced so much crying from me
Sunshine,1750,9,hanelya__,,160.0,ltbx,"it’s not perfect, but it hit a part of me that mourns for our women, for the lives that have forever been altered by the lack of knowledge and autonomy and conversation"
Sunshine,1750,10,hanelya__,,160.0,ltbx,"and still, everywhere there are quiet ways that we hold each other through it all"
Sunshine,1751,1,hojichan,,160.0,ltbx,they can never make me hate you maris racal

Sunshine,1753,11,mdrpme,,200.0,ltbx,parang kailangan mo siya i-digest ng mga ilang araw
Sunshine,1753,12,mdrpme,,200.0,ltbx,kailangan ng mahabang briefing
Sunshine,1753,13,mdrpme,,200.0,ltbx,PERO SOBRANG GALING
Sunshine,1753,14,mdrpme,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang tapang ng pagkakagawa at sana yung mensahe ng pelikulang ito ay makaabot sa mga taong hindi pa bukas sa ganitong topic
Sunshine,1753,15,mdrpme,,200.0,ltbx,hindi pa naman huli ang lahat
Sunshine,1753,16,mdrpme,,200.0,ltbx,"sunshine, gets ka namin"

Sunshine,1754,9,excovidal,,160.0,ltbx,my only note was that i wish the film was given its own song that will leave a mark idk its lacking music me thinks
Sunshine,1755,1,jgandhe,,200.0,ltbx,Log ko lang pero maris racal best actress of the year
Sunshine,1755,2,jgandhe,,200.0,ltbx,"-So ito na nga,Bitch i thought rurok na ni direk tonette yung fan girl"
Sunshine,1755,3,jgandhe,,200.0,ltbx,Who would’ve thought that she would write and direct a film again that focuses on societal issue and systemic oppression
Sunshine,1755,4,jgandhe,,200.0,ltbx,"Also, Maris"
Sunshine,1755,6,jgandhe,,200.0,ltbx,She’s so good that I want to hug Sunshine from the screen
Sunshine,1755,7,jgandhe,,200.0,ltbx,I just hope na mapanood ‘to ng mas maraming tao
Sunshine,1755,8,jgandhe,,200.0,ltbx,Pero yung totoong rurok dito
Sunshine,1755,9,jgandhe,,200.0,ltbx,‘Yung pagiging hipokrito’t pagiging self-righteous ng bansang ‘to
Sunshine,1755,10,jgandhe,,200.0,ltbx,The government would call for anything progression but would never do anything for progression
Sunshine,1756,1,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,Ang husay ni Maris
Sunshine,1756,2,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,that's a movie star right there
Sunshine,1756,3,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,"Dama ko yung bigat, takot, at sakit na dinadala niya"
Sunshine,1756,4,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,Mula simula hanggang huli niruroot ko ang tagumpay ni Sunshine at pagpili niya sa kanyang pangarap
Sunshine,1756,5,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,Buti na lang nakahanap siya nang ligtas na makatutulong sakanya at mayroon siyang magandang support system
Sunshine,1756,6,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,Yung iyak ko sa scene nila ng ate niya
Sunshine,1756,7,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,Ang lakas din maka catholic guilt nung doktora jusko po
Sunshine,1756,8,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,pero sobrang makatotohanan sa disposisyon ng maraming pilipino sa usaping abortion
Sunshine,1756,9,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,at TANGINA NI MIGGY WALA KANG KWENTA
Sunshine,1756,10,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,"nung nag ""i love you"" siya gusto ko nang pumasok sa eksena at hambalusin siya ng upuan"
Sunshine,1756,11,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,Ang sakit sa puso na may mga babae lalo na mga kabataan ang dumadaan sa delikadong paraan para magpalaglag
Sunshine,1756,12,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,Nawa'y magsilbing eye opener ang Sunshine para ma-decriminalize ang abortion sa Pilipinas
Sunshine,1756,13,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,It's high time na makapanood naman ng ibang pananaw ukol sa abortion hindi yung nakagawiang inaantagonize ito sa mga palabas
Sunshine,1756,14,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,"Sobrang tumatak sakin yung final scene ni Sunshine at bata habang pinapractice niya yung routine niya tapos nagyakapan sila at sinabi ni bata, ""gets ko na"""
Sunshine,1756,15,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,Ang ganda nung pagkakabuo sa eksena kuhang kuha hagulgol ko
Sunshine,1756,16,malena444,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine movie of the year
Sunshine,1757,1,reginasfilms,,200.0,ltbx,not to be overdramatic but i would die for the women in my life
Sunshine,1757,2,reginasfilms,,200.0,ltbx,i love them so much
Sunshine,1757,3,reginasfilms,,200.0,ltbx,it brings me to tears to think that these are our realities—sometimes much worse
Sunshine,1757,4,reginasfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"but, we will always have each other and that has to mean a whole lot"
Sunshine,1757,5,reginasfilms,,200.0,ltbx,i would be empty without them
Sunshine,1758,1,mp8334,,80.0,ltbx,"this, to me, was a case of loving the purpose more than the execution"
Sunshine,1758,2,mp8334,,80.0,ltbx,i really had a lot of expectations having been waiting to see this since about a year ago
Sunshine,1758,3,mp8334,,80.0,ltbx,"nevertheless, a must watch"
Sunshine,1758,4,mp8334,,80.0,ltbx,magthank you tayo kay papa god at mayroon tayo ng pelikulang ito
Sunshine,1758,5,mp8334,,80.0,ltbx,sidenote: i want to eat this poster
Sunshine,1759,1,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,Watching Sunshine wasn’t just watching a movie
Sunshine,1759,2,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"Parang I was sitting beside a woman, listening to her story ng tahimik lang, pero sobrang bigat"
Sunshine,1759,3,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s not easy to watch, but that’s exactly why it felt so real"
Sunshine,1759,4,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,What hit me the most was how the film didn’t try to be loud or preachy
Sunshine,1759,5,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,The film doesn’t try to romanticize or a free promotion for abortion
Sunshine,1759,6,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,It just let the silence do the work
Sunshine,1759,7,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"Minsan iyak lang, minsan wala talagang salita"
Sunshine,1759,8,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,That makes it more powerful
Sunshine,1759,9,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,Hindi ito simpleng kwento
Sunshine,1759,10,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s about pain, dreams, and mga choices na hindi talaga madaling pagpilian"
Sunshine,1759,11,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"Pero I have to say, may parts na medyo kulang for me"
Sunshine,1759,12,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"Sana mas dark yung cinematography, like Khalel 15 — gritty and raw"
Sunshine,1759,13,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"Lastly, hindi ito movie para sa lahat"
Sunshine,1759,14,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"But still, Sunshine gives us something real"
Sunshine,1759,15,macnfilm,,160.0,ltbx,"And if you’re willing to sit with it and really listen, then you’ll see a side of womanhood na madalas tinatago"
Sunshine,1760,1,rowdy444,,200.0,ltbx,"A woman who refuses to ruled by their own body, choices and dreams is something powerful and bravery"
Sunshine,1761,1,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,Drown out the noise
Sunshine,1761,2,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,You are Sunshine
Sunshine,1761,4,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,"Yung pangarap ko kung anong pangarap niya, get a load of this, sasali kami sa olympics"
Sunshine,1761,5,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,"Direk Tonet's Sunshine is HEAVY, BRAVE, and DARING"
Sunshine,1761,6,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,"I’ve been waiting for this since production started—and grabe, it did not disappoint"
Sunshine,1761,7,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s the kind of film that hurts, that lingers, and that starts conversations"
Sunshine,1761,8,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,Maris was PHENOMENAL
Sunshine,1761,9,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,Her performance shook me
Sunshine,1761,10,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,U can trash her personal life pero u CAN'T touch her acting skills
Sunshine,1761,11,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,Philippine cinema is clearly shifting
Sunshine,1761,12,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,And I’m so happy that Direk Tonet is one of the voices leading that change
Sunshine,1761,13,methboy15,,200.0,ltbx,GETS KO NAA
Sunshine,1762,1,akichavz,,180.0,ltbx,"kailan man ay hindi ko mararamasan ang mga pasanin ng isang babae, patuloy na lalaban para sa healthcare na para sa bata, babae, bading at para sa lahat"
Sunshine,1763,1,moonrising,,160.0,ltbx,Need to take time to write a review that will do this film justice
Sunshine,1764,1,iamnicocuison,,200.0,ltbx,Nanganak din pala si Sassa
Sunshine,1765,1,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,:)) wala akong matres pero sobra akong naka relate sa pelikulang ito
Sunshine,1765,3,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,nakita ko ang sarili ko kay annika (yung bata)
Sunshine,1765,4,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,:))malinaw ang ipinaglalaban ng pelikula
Sunshine,1765,5,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,maganda ang script
Sunshine,1765,6,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,hindi ko alam kung medyo napa OA sa pagkadilim yung pelikula or sadyang pangit lang ang quality ng sinehan dito sa atin
Sunshine,1765,7,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,maganda sana siguro kung maayos yung projection
Sunshine,1765,8,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,"ngunit ang storya ng pelikula ang pinaka mahalagang aspeto neto at sa pagkakataon ito, dahil sa nakamamanghang storya na ipinakita sa pelikulang ito, kaya kong isantabi ang mga teknikal na mga bagay na ito"
Sunshine,1765,9,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,sa mga artista
Sunshine,1765,10,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,"i am personally a fan of maris, annika, and jennica before this film"
Sunshine,1765,11,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,maris delivered
Sunshine,1765,12,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,"may something sa kaniya na i cannot still put a finger at but anw, i hope she get to act more on the big screen"
Sunshine,1765,13,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,i think the role of that young girl was made for annika
Sunshine,1765,14,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,i also want to see jennica in a lead role on the big screen
Sunshine,1765,15,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,"all in all, silang tatlo was the best choice for their roles"
Sunshine,1765,16,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,i cannot see other actresses that can replace them
Sunshine,1765,17,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,kay direk jadaone
Sunshine,1765,18,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,idk pero kitang kita mo yung artistry sa mga pelikula niya
Sunshine,1765,19,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,ewan ko pero ramdam na ramdam ko yung respeto niya sa film industry sa mga pelikula niya
Sunshine,1765,20,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,"na para bang bawats scrne, bawat anggulo, may dahilan"
Sunshine,1765,21,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,i hope to watch more films by her
Sunshine,1765,22,aldrinlei,,200.0,ltbx,:))yun lang hehe
Sunshine,1766,1,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Mula pa lang sa trailer, alam ko na—hindi ko puwedeng palampasin ang pelikulang ito"
Sunshine,1766,2,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Direk Tonet ‘yan, eh"
Sunshine,1766,3,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"May tiwala ako sa kakayahan niyang gawing matula ang trahedya, at gawing tahimik pero mabigat ang mga sigaw ng kababaihan sa lipunang laging inuuna ang hiya kaysa sa hustisya"
Sunshine,1766,4,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Isa sa mga personal na dahilan kung bakit ako nanood ay dahil gusto kong unawain—hindi man buo, pero kahit konti—kung ano ang dinadala ng isang babaeng katulad ni Sunshine"
Sunshine,1766,5,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Bilang isang assigned male at birth, pero hindi ganap na komportable sa label na iyon, alam kong may distansya sa pagitan namin ni Sunshine"
Sunshine,1766,6,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Pero iyon mismo ang dahilan kung bakit ako nanahimik sa sinehan
Sunshine,1766,7,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Tumigil akong mag-analisa, at hayaan ang pelikula na magsalita para sa sarili nito"
Sunshine,1766,8,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi ko kailangang maging babae para makiramay
Sunshine,1766,9,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Pero gusto kong makiramdam
Sunshine,1766,10,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"At dito, sa pelikulang ito, nagtagumpay akong maramdaman si Sunshine—ang kanyang pagkalito, galit, at takot—na para bang sarili kong laman-loob ang kinikiskis ng eksena"
Sunshine,1766,11,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"At sa prosesong iyon, nadama ko si Sunshine—ang pagkalito niya na hindi simpleng pagkaligaw, kundi paglalakad sa isang landas na sinabihan siyang bawal"
Sunshine,1766,12,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang galit niyang hindi mapagsigawan, at ang takot niyang hindi inamin, pero nandoon sa bawat kumpas ng katawan niya"
Sunshine,1766,13,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal didn’t just play Sunshine—she inhabited her
Sunshine,1766,14,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"She carried her, as if every scene weighed heavily on her spine, even when she stood upright"
Sunshine,1766,15,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,May mga eksena na walang dialogue pero mas mabigat pa sa sigawan
Sunshine,1766,16,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,At doon ko nakita ang mastery ni Maris bilang aktres: ang kakayahang magsalita gamit ang pananahimik
Sunshine,1766,17,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Nakakatawang may nagsabi raw sa likod ng kamera na “haggard” siya habang nagsu-shoot
Sunshine,1766,18,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"I laughed—not because it’s funny, but because it’s too real"
Sunshine,1766,19,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Ganito talaga ang hitsura ng kabataang babae na araw-araw tinatanggihan ang mundo, pero hindi puwedeng mapagod"
Sunshine,1766,20,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"May mga Sunshine sa Quiapo, sa mga post sa Reddit, sa mga comments na deleted, sa mga babae sa jeep na tahimik lang pero may bitbit na kwento"
Sunshine,1766,21,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,And it takes a film like Sunshine to remind us: they are not voiceless
Sunshine,1766,22,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,We just haven’t been listening
Sunshine,1766,23,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Unang tingin kay Annika, iisipin mong comic relief siya"
Sunshine,1766,24,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Isang batang gumugulo sa eksena, parang pang-balanse sa bigat ng naratibo"
Sunshine,1766,25,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Pero habang tumatagal, na-realize kong siya pala ang pinakamatining sa lahat"
Sunshine,1766,26,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi siya ordinaryong karakter—siya ang konsensya ni Sunshine
Sunshine,1766,27,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi ang moralistic kind, but the invasive kind"
Sunshine,1766,28,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Yung konsensyang hindi laging tama o mali, kundi nagtatanong: “Nasaan ka na"
Sunshine,1766,29,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,” “Handa ka ba
Sunshine,1766,30,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,” “Ito ba ang gusto mong piliin
Sunshine,1766,31,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"” At dahil hindi laging consistent ang paglitaw niya—minsan parang guni-guni, minsan parang totoo—mas naging epektibo siya"
Sunshine,1766,32,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Kasi hindi ba ganoon din ang konsensya
Sunshine,1766,33,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,It creeps in when you're alone
Sunshine,1766,34,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,It arrives uninvited
Sunshine,1766,35,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"In a country where abortion is taboo, Annika becomes more than a person—she’s a presence"
Sunshine,1766,36,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,A question
Sunshine,1766,37,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"A symbol of possibility and loss, but not in a way that condemns"
Sunshine,1766,38,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"She’s not there to judge Sunshine, but to make us feel what it means to carry a choice you can’t share with anyone"
Sunshine,1766,39,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa isang bansang ang moralidad ay naka-template mula sa pulpito, ang pagkakaroon ng karakter tulad ni Annika is radical"
Sunshine,1766,40,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi siya plot device
Sunshine,1766,41,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Isa siyang reimaginasyon ng konsensya—hindi para ipahiya ang babae, kundi ipaalala kung gaano kabigat ang dalahin sa lipunang pilit silang pinatatahimik"
Sunshine,1766,42,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Ang Sunshine ay hindi pelikulang pro-choice dahil gusto nitong makipagtalo
Sunshine,1766,43,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi rin ito pelikula tungkol sa abortion dahil gusto nitong mag-skandalo
Sunshine,1766,44,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Ito ay pelikula tungkol sa karapatan
Sunshine,1766,45,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa kakayahang pumili, kahit pa masakit ang pagpiling iyon"
Sunshine,1766,46,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine doesn’t celebrate abortion—it honors the courage to face it
Sunshine,1766,47,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa lipunang ang kababaihan ay kailangang laging malinis, laging mabait, laging matino, heto ang isang pelikulang nagsasabing: ang katawan mo ay hindi kasalanan"
Sunshine,1766,48,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Ang pagpili mo ay hindi dapat katumbas ng pagkapako
Sunshine,1766,49,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Maraming salamat, Direk Tonet"
Sunshine,1766,50,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Salamat sa hindi pag-ikot sa ligtas na naratibo
Sunshine,1766,51,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Salamat sa pagbibigay ng boses sa katahimikan
Sunshine,1766,52,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Salamat sa paghubog ng pelikulang hindi lang para sa kababaihan, kundi para sa lahat ng gustong matutong makinig"
Sunshine,1766,53,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"Bilang isang lalaki na walang MATRES, pero may malasakit sa mga may isa, ramdam ko ang urgency ng kwento"
Sunshine,1766,54,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is not a perfect film—but it is a vital one
Sunshine,1766,55,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,"And in a country that rarely gives women room to speak, a film like this doesn’t just feel brave"
Sunshine,1766,56,teriyak_,,200.0,ltbx,It feels necessary
Sunshine,1767,1,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,""" Drown out the noise"
Sunshine,1767,2,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"""This line in the Sunshine struck me after watching the film"
Sunshine,1767,3,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,Noise is considered as a plot device in the film literally and figuratively
Sunshine,1767,4,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,I like how the background music or the noise from the background is used to set the tone and mood of the film especially in scenes where Sunshine is walking or riding a jeep home
Sunshine,1767,5,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,Noise in the film can also represent the doubts that fill her while practicing and self-righteous religious people who judge her actions throughout the film
Sunshine,1767,6,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,The film is about a gymnast who plans to join the tryouts for the Olympics
Sunshine,1767,7,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"However, she receives a result that is unexpectedly pregnant which can hinder her chances in getting in"
Sunshine,1767,8,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is great in her role as Sunshine and I think that she embodies the role of a gymnast especially since she tried gymnastics to prepare for her role
Sunshine,1767,9,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,There were scenes that were remarkable for me such as when she tries to hit a the mirror of a car after her boyfriend (played by Elijah Canlas) doesn't take responsibility for her pregnancy
Sunshine,1767,10,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,I also loved the supporting characters as well
Sunshine,1767,11,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite their small roles, they made a mark for me"
Sunshine,1767,12,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"For instance, Jennica Garcia was impressive in her scenes with Maris Racal as her older sister"
Sunshine,1767,13,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,You can feel that she defends and protects her sister and stay by her side especially during her revelation that she is pregnant
Sunshine,1767,14,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,Xyriel Manabat is no surprise for me since I admire her acting skills since she was a child actress
Sunshine,1767,15,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,She is great as Sunshine's best friend
Sunshine,1767,16,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"Annika Co, an upcoming child actress, is a scene stealer where she acts as a conscience to Sunshine"
Sunshine,1767,17,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,She is charming and witty in her role and I think the twist made sense to me in one scene
Sunshine,1767,18,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"In addition to it being a sports drama, this film also tackled the themes of women's choice and abortion"
Sunshine,1767,19,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,These topics are considered sensitive and taboo in a dominant Catholic and conservative society
Sunshine,1767,20,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"As a man, this film moved me and realize how hard it is to be a woman in a society wherethey are judged for having an autonomy in their body"
Sunshine,1767,21,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"In a third world country, healthcare is considered a privilege especially for the poor"
Sunshine,1767,22,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"Because of abortion being considered illegal and immoral, women are forced to resort to unsafe practices which can endanger them"
Sunshine,1767,23,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,It is shown in the film and I think it's interesting that it depicted two doctors: one which discriminates women because of her religious bias and one which tried to understand and helped another character in the film who turned to abortion
Sunshine,1767,24,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"It's a sad reality, but I'm glad that this film will open conversations about themes like these"
Sunshine,1767,25,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"Overall, I find Sunshine an impressive film"
Sunshine,1767,26,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,I think this is Antonette Jadaone's best film so far
Sunshine,1767,27,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,It's my second film that I've seen in cinemas and I'm grateful to witness it in the big screen because it is worth the watch there with its immersive experience
Sunshine,1767,28,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,I was definitely looking forward to it since it's rare to watch a sports film which centers around gymnastics and it has been shown in film festivals abroad
Sunshine,1767,29,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,I was worried that it won't be shown here because of how controversial it would be because of the stand of the Catholic Church and other religious sectors regarding abortion
Sunshine,1767,30,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,I guess more people are more open-minded towards the topics unlike before
Sunshine,1767,31,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"Aside from the acting, what I found compelling in the film is the cinematography and scoring which adds tension and mood to the it"
Sunshine,1767,32,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite its limited release and pitted against two superhero films during its premiere, I really hope more people will get a chance to watch this movie"
Sunshine,1767,33,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,"Even if it shows the harsh realities of life and in sports, I agree with other film critics that it also shows hope"
Sunshine,1767,34,migueltheangelo,,160.0,ltbx,There is Sunshine after the rain
Sunshine,1768,1,wheeindurant,,,ltbx,napaka tapang
Sunshine,1769,1,funnierthan24,,200.0,ltbx,“akala ko ako lang yung ganito
Sunshine,1769,2,funnierthan24,,200.0,ltbx,” sunshine represents a universal experience among nearly all the women i know
Sunshine,1769,3,funnierthan24,,200.0,ltbx,"it’s crazy how similar the choices she has made are to both young and adult women, making it surprising and very unsettling to see on the big screen"
Sunshine,1769,4,funnierthan24,,200.0,ltbx,grabeng representation yan
Sunshine,1770,1,da_vincix,,200.0,ltbx,Suporta ang kailangan ng kababaihan
Sunshine,1770,2,da_vincix,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa palakasan, sa pagbubuntis, sa aborsyon, sa desisyon sa sarili nilang katawan"
Sunshine,1770,3,da_vincix,,200.0,ltbx,"Nakita sa pelikula ang kawalan ng suporta ng gobyerno sa sports, maternal care at access sa safe abortion"
Sunshine,1770,4,da_vincix,,200.0,ltbx,Nakakaantig itong masaksihan mula sa pananaw ng isang atletang di inaasahang nabuntis
Sunshine,1770,5,da_vincix,,200.0,ltbx,"""Gets ko na""sana ma-gets din ng ibaALSO THEY CAN NEVER MAKE ME HATE YOU MARIS RACAL"

Sunshine,1772,1,giopuyat,,200.0,ltbx,"No doubt my favorite Jadaone film, Sunshine is not only an important work of art in a cultural context, but an objectively beautiful, clean and concise narrative work"
Sunshine,1772,2,giopuyat,,200.0,ltbx,"What I mean is not a single frame is wasted, or given up for style points - every decision of performance, framing and pace is made to serve the story, to make us empathize with Sunshine, to feel what she feels"
Sunshine,1772,3,giopuyat,,200.0,ltbx,"Woman vs the institution - the clarity of this theme is just so powerful, yet we’re brought into Sunshine’s world through masterful camerawork that just feels honest"
Sunshine,1772,4,giopuyat,,200.0,ltbx,"There’s a shot I love, where Sunshine is framed inside a window (in her room then in a motel), and the chaos of the city goes on about her, uncaring and apathetic to her situation"
Sunshine,1772,5,giopuyat,,200.0,ltbx,"That’s the whole movie - the slow-burning horror that she is being shunned by society, cramped into tiny spaces trying to survive"
Sunshine,1772,6,giopuyat,,200.0,ltbx,"It made me cringe to hear the chants of “Pilipinas” by the crowd in her performance at the end (the sad reality of Filipino athletes, unsupported in training yet celebrated in victory)Maris Racal’s best performance"
Sunshine,1772,7,giopuyat,,200.0,ltbx,The care and dedication she brought to the role should be applauded
Sunshine,1772,8,giopuyat,,200.0,ltbx,"Everyone else in the movie is so dialed in too, a subtle superpower of Direk Tonet’s ear for relatable acting and dialogue"
Sunshine,1772,9,giopuyat,,200.0,ltbx,"Also love the Pastor P appearance, who brings such an important discussion into the public consciousness"
Sunshine,1772,10,giopuyat,,200.0,ltbx,The ultimate boss level: God & practicality vs the woman’s decision
Sunshine,1772,11,giopuyat,,200.0,ltbx,Instant classic
Sunshine,1773,1,comingofagemess,,200.0,ltbx,“Sunshine” gripped my soul and left me hollow with unease
Sunshine,1773,2,comingofagemess,,200.0,ltbx,"the first ten minutes we follow Sunshine as she drifts aimlessly through the restless streets of Manila, and that’s how the entire film feels"
Sunshine,1773,3,comingofagemess,,200.0,ltbx,"yes, it’s sending a message, but watching her spiral felt almost voyeuristic, as if we were witnessing something intimate and illegal"
Sunshine,1773,4,comingofagemess,,200.0,ltbx,"no propaganda, just raw, heartbreaking truth"
Sunshine,1773,5,comingofagemess,,200.0,ltbx,"and as much as i hate comparing directors, the rawness of each frame felt deeply “Brocka” but captured through the tenderness and gaze of a woman"
Sunshine,1773,6,comingofagemess,,200.0,ltbx,"at the film’s core is Maris Racal, exceptional in her quiet nuance, supported beautifully by Jennica Garcia"
Sunshine,1773,7,comingofagemess,,200.0,ltbx,this film will linger with me for days
Sunshine,1773,8,comingofagemess,,200.0,ltbx,"it’s about the cruelty of the world, the ache of aspirations, the fragile hope for a better life, and, ultimately, a woman’s choice"
Sunshine,1773,9,comingofagemess,,200.0,ltbx,"And at the center of it all, I love when a woman chooses herself"
Sunshine,1774,1,wishbone_,,200.0,ltbx,OMEYAK LANG AKO
Sunshine,1775,1,menudios,,180.0,ltbx,"sobrang halaga sa akin ng sunshine dahil hindi lang karapatan ng kababaihan ang buhat nitong adbokasiya, kung hindi pati na rin ang karapatan ng kabataan na madalas isinasantabi lang sa usapin ng reproductive health"
Sunshine,1775,2,menudios,,180.0,ltbx,"kung ang tema ay tungkol sa pagiging pro-choice lang, magwowork pa rin naman yung kwento kung young adult o di kaya’y isang full grown woman si sunshine"
Sunshine,1775,3,menudios,,180.0,ltbx,pero siya ay isang teenager—bata sa mata ng batas at babae sa mata ng lipunan
Sunshine,1775,4,menudios,,180.0,ltbx,"eventually, titignan na rin siya bilang isang babae na lang dulot ng kanyang pagkabuntis, na para bang nawawala agad ang pagkabata porket may dinadalang bata"
Sunshine,1775,5,menudios,,180.0,ltbx,"doble ang pasan ng teenage pregnancy, dahil bilang bata o babae man, wala silang say sa sarili nilang katawan"
Sunshine,1775,6,menudios,,180.0,ltbx,"kulang pa ang impormasyon at rekurso kapag kailangan na nila, making them even more vulnerable sa panganib"
Sunshine,1775,7,menudios,,180.0,ltbx,"tulad ni sunshine, marami ang natutukso sa mga ilegal at nakamamatay na paraan para lang ipaglaban ang karapatan nila sa sariling katawan, dahil wala silang natatanggap na anumang uri ng suporta"
Sunshine,1775,8,menudios,,180.0,ltbx,mas pinahahalagahan ng lipunan ang buhay na namumuo pa lang sa sinapupunan kesa ang buhay na nariyan na
Sunshine,1775,9,menudios,,180.0,ltbx,"kaya bukod sa panawagan para sa legal na proteksyon sa autonomy ng kababaihan at dekalidad na healthcare system, lumilitaw rin sa pelikula ang agarang pangangailangan natin para sa comprehensive sex education na siyang magpoprovide ng necessary and appropriate resources sa mga bata tungkol sa sex, contraception, consent, at iba pang mga kaugnay na bagay na gagabay sa kanila para tahakin ito nang ligtas at malay"
Sunshine,1775,10,menudios,,180.0,ltbx,sana ipalabas pa ito sa mas malawak na audience huhu kelangan to ipakilala at idiin sa consciousness ng mga pilipino ngayon din

Sunshine,1777,2,claireashley_,,200.0,ltbx,"my parents were teenagers when they had me, and my mom told me na she tried buying pamparegla from quiapo before, but her parents stopped her saying it was a horrendous sin kay Lord"
Sunshine,1777,3,claireashley_,,200.0,ltbx,"if she had chosen to live her life without me existing, i would thank her for it"
Sunshine,1777,4,claireashley_,,200.0,ltbx,gets na gets ko siya
Sunshine,1777,5,claireashley_,,200.0,ltbx,"i hope this film will successfully convey its message to the viewers, and serve as an eye-opener for those who believe that a woman doesn't have a choice"
Sunshine,1777,6,claireashley_,,200.0,ltbx,"rhed bustamante's character as a 13-year old who was sa'd by her tito reflects the reality of a lot of women — girls even, cause she's not even an adult yet"
Sunshine,1777,7,claireashley_,,200.0,ltbx,"abortion being illegal in the philippines doesn't stop people from doing it, hence it leads them to doing it in a horrifying and deadly way"
Sunshine,1777,8,claireashley_,,200.0,ltbx,pamparegla pills and hilot are ways people resort to because of abortion being inaccessible here in our country

Sunshine,1777,15,claireashley_,,200.0,ltbx,"overall, this film is such a great commentary on how women aren't always meant to be mothers, and that one failure won't ever stop you from reaching your dreams"
Sunshine,1777,16,claireashley_,,200.0,ltbx,"to all sunshine's out there, kapit lang :))"

Sunshine,1779,1,catacutanregi,,200.0,ltbx,"“Sunshine” is more than a film, it is a visceral, unflinching portrait of womanhood in the Philippines"
Sunshine,1779,2,catacutanregi,,200.0,ltbx,"It gives voice not only to the silenced narratives about teenage pregnancy and abortion, but also to the layered realities of how Filipinas live, dream, suffer, and survive amid the relentless chaos of urban life"
Sunshine,1779,3,catacutanregi,,200.0,ltbx,It dares to confront uncomfortable truths
Sunshine,1779,4,catacutanregi,,200.0,ltbx,The cinematography is superb

Sunshine,1779,8,catacutanregi,,200.0,ltbx,This is a big contribution to the success of Philippine cinema
Sunshine,1780,1,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,many reasons why i absolutely loved this movie: 1) watched it w someone who is very dear to me (hi angel if you’re seeing this)2) the actors3) the story it tells 4) what this film means for the future of abortion and RH in the PHok now lets go point by point starting at no
Sunshine,1780,3,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"hoping the people reading this dont think im intellectualizing my review or whatever bc i just have a lot of thoughts and i couldnt sleep so im writing this now…2) actorsits lined up with amazing, talented actors so it’s absolutely a no-brainer that they would all deliver their lines stunningly"
Sunshine,1780,4,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"however, each character brought out such vivid emotions that i believe only their respective actor/actress could bring out"
Sunshine,1780,5,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,props to the casting director and direk jadaone for this
Sunshine,1780,6,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,i first give my flowers to elijah canlas and piolo pascual
Sunshine,1780,7,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"honestly believe that no other pair of actors could portray this father-son, catholic tandem better"
Sunshine,1780,8,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"elijah weirdly embodies the annoying, conyo, gago actor really well, while piolo is no stranger to playing a overt Catholic"
Sunshine,1780,9,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"i also am all praise for xyriel, meryll, and jennica"
Sunshine,1780,10,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"the women in the film who, in a world that is cruel, chose to be kind, especially to Sunshine"
Sunshine,1780,11,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"i praise jennica especially because with every line recited, you can feel her character’s exhaustion of having to give up their dreams and forcing themselves to accept their reality in an unforgiving society, as if she had a choice"
Sunshine,1780,12,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"of course, annika co is also a standout star here"
Sunshine,1780,13,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"though a rookie in the industry, i loved seeing her on the big screen"
Sunshine,1780,14,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"lastly, maris"
Sunshine,1780,15,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,no one can play Sunshine but Maris Racal
Sunshine,1780,16,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,i fear i have to make a separate review on her solely
Sunshine,1780,17,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"i hope she bags many, many awards because she deserves it"
Sunshine,1780,18,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"3) the story it tellsthe story of Sunshine is one that I, as a woman, have encountered many times"
Sunshine,1780,19,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"while post-debrief, i recounted the amount of times i was told a former schoolmate of mine became a teenage mother, and i thought about all of the dreams they had to give up simply because they had no choice"
Sunshine,1780,20,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"even in this film, Sunshine’s reality painted her to have little to no choice at all"
Sunshine,1780,21,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"while it’s not a new narrative, it’s a narrative that’s stuck in the past—in traditional, old, conservative Philippine society, which is why movies like Sunshine feel so refreshing"
Sunshine,1780,22,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,it strives to go beyond what society is now
Sunshine,1780,23,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"4) what this film means for the future of abortion and RH in the PHthe fact that a film like this was produced and is being shown during a time where, globally, conservatism is on the rise and the Philippines is nowhere close to even considering the decriminalization of abortion, is already something revolutionary in itself"
Sunshine,1780,24,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,"hopefully, this movie opens more doors to more discussions on abortion and bodily autonomy"
Sunshine,1780,25,tobreakfree,,200.0,ltbx,i really have lots of respect for direk tonette and Maris for being at the forefront of what could be the beginning of the creation of a bigger platform for many women across the country to speak about autonomy and choice

Sunshine,1784,3,purplomens,,180.0,ltbx,i like that

Sunshine,1785,2,ellashtka,,200.0,ltbx,let me process my thoughts
Sunshine,1786,1,ginxlocke,,180.0,ltbx,"manila in its barest, philippine societal system in its most oppressive on women, patriarchy in its sharpest teeth clenched tightly on women leaving them bloody (literally and figuratively), long held religious beliefs in its firmest grip leaving many more regressive, and most of all love and support system in its purest and most tender"
Sunshine,1786,2,ginxlocke,,180.0,ltbx,"i keep wondering by the end about the women who weren’t given the privilege to choose, those like mary grace, those who never had the support they needed when faced with the same dilemma, those who’ve braved the use of unconventional means of abortion and may have almost died or indeed died"

Sunshine,1786,4,ginxlocke,,180.0,ltbx,"and this is a reality lived by many women in the philippines, that despite the film leaving on a positive note, i just cant help but think: this world isn’t built for women to thrive, instead it’s a world where they have to fight tooth and nail just to survive, and in the film, to just get the basic need of a choice over their body"

Sunshine,1789,1,cosmilkcritter,,160.0,ltbx,beautifully acted and well written
Sunshine,1789,2,cosmilkcritter,,160.0,ltbx,"there’s a sharp, dark humor threaded in its dialogues on sex, childbirth, & dreams, an unflinching tone that never really leaves u, and a quiet reality of sunshine that mirrors so much of what we rarely say out loud"
Sunshine,1789,3,cosmilkcritter,,160.0,ltbx,"a combination that truly amplifies the much needed conversation that this film advocates—one that gently but firmly questions our sense of life, morality, and the cost of it all"
Sunshine,1789,4,cosmilkcritter,,160.0,ltbx,"also, i’m a big fan of the jadaone-racal duo like shet ang galing potaena sana gets niyo"
Sunshine,1790,1,jolsk,,180.0,ltbx,"a powerful statement regarding womens body autonomy, “show, dont tell” tasteful undertones of the controlling patriarch as shown by Pastor Jaime (Piolo Pascual) assumed on Sunshines unborn child, the girl following Sunshine around condemning her every decision is the perfect representation of catholic guilt, and how limiting/dangerous abortion laws in the philippines are for the impoverished that result in life-threatening “end of the road” solutions"
Sunshine,1790,2,jolsk,,180.0,ltbx,not a stretch to say that this is one of the best filipino movies i…

Sunshine,1794,1,ciandreia,,200.0,ltbx,“drown out the noise
Sunshine,1794,2,ciandreia,,200.0,ltbx,"”sunshine tramples on both internal and external noises—judgment, fear, catholic guilt, and desperate prayers; the chaos that quietly unfolds in the dark streets of manila, and the ironies existing at the heart of folk-catholicism as underground, unsafe abortion exists steps away from a sacred ground"
Sunshine,1794,3,ciandreia,,200.0,ltbx,it’s impossible for sunshine—for women—to drown out the noise
Sunshine,1794,4,ciandreia,,200.0,ltbx,"My favorite detail in this movie is the portrayal of different women, each with her own turmoil, resources, and stage in life, struggling in a deeply patriarchal and faith-bound society, while still finding the strength to stand for each other"
Sunshine,1794,5,ciandreia,,200.0,ltbx,wala nang ibang makakaunawa at dadamay sa paghihirap ng pagiging babae kundi kapwa mga babae
Sunshine,1794,6,ciandreia,,200.0,ltbx,"this film is dark, heavy, and uncomfortable to watch (as it should) but necessary"
Sunshine,1794,7,ciandreia,,200.0,ltbx,it shatters your core and makes you question how far can religious ideas go in a hostile and punishing society

Sunshine,1797,17,briandexter,,180.0,ltbx,This film got me because I hope my mom had a choice at that time
Sunshine,1797,18,briandexter,,180.0,ltbx,"I loved her so much, but I hope in her next life, she chooses her dreams"
Sunshine,1798,1,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"SUNSHINE advances itself as a film about bodily autonomy in a nation that denies its very terminology, yet it does so through the insulated idiom of psychological realism rather than the concretised mapping of the material conditions that make autonomy, abortion, and girlhood existentially precarious"
Sunshine,1798,2,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"We are immersed in affect, but the structure underpinning these sensations is left either ambient or altogether unrendered"
Sunshine,1798,3,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"Yes, the pharmacy exists as a moral space and the hospital as carceral, but where is the livelihood"
Sunshine,1798,4,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,Who funds the training
Sunshine,1798,5,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"What does it mean, materially, to be a 19-year-old athlete—and an international one, at that—with no visible labouring parent and no bread line to back it up"
Sunshine,1798,6,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"Abortion is outlawed in the Philippines because it preserves state-church power and results in the reproductive labour of the poor as exploitable and their agency criminal, but to bracket class from the narrative—in a context where economic vulnerability is the foremost determinant of reproductive injustice—is consequential"
Sunshine,1798,7,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"Instead, the endless deferral into mood, while expressive, is in itself a seductive alibi for political disengagement"
Sunshine,1798,8,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"I understand that this is a film of interiority—that the point is to reflect Sunshine’s constrained perceptual field—but her interiority is a response to economic realities that the film chooses to elude, and when the audience is asked to interpolate systemic weight from ambience without any clear depiction of how deprivation functions, what we get is an abstraction that parades as empathy, and from that abstraction, other evasions proliferate: the neoliberal myth of the meritocratic athlete, whose suffering must be understood as psychological strain rather than as infrastructural abandonment; the convenient fiction that ambition alone propels a body through state-sponsored regimes without subsidy or the material realities the film forgoes"
Sunshine,1798,9,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"To abstract oppression into psychic distress then, while refusing its logistical origins, is to risk reproducing the same symbolic economy the Church relies upon: one in which the body is meaningful only as a metaphor and a vessel onto which morality is projected"
Sunshine,1798,10,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,This aesthetic disposition of interiority is of course obviously a structure inherited from the exportable idiom of European festival realism where the trauma of the Filipina is depicted legibly for the global North
Sunshine,1798,11,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"From this perspective, it would make sense that the institutions that manufacture her precarity are rendered as emotional rather than historical, inviting the audience to feel with her but never to account—but by doing so, what emerges is not so much a Filipino film but a Filipino offering: an artefact of pain rendered in tones familiar to jurors abroad, a choice that aligns seamlessly with both (1) Jadaone’s career pivot into the international circuit, having premiered the film at Berlinale and TIFF, and (2) the film’s own final sequence: Sunshine performing her routine at the SEA games before a panel of foreign adjudicators, body taut and calibrated for approval by those who will never understand the weight of what she forfeited to arrive there"
Sunshine,1798,12,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"By naming these two parallels do we metabolise the rage of a system into something palatable and interpretable, and since both Jadaone and Sunshine must contort to be seen, in being seen, they are asked to become less what they mean"
Sunshine,1798,13,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"Perhaps the question is not whether SUNSHINE fails as a film or recedes as an offering, but whether it was ever permitted the autonomy to be anything else—whether within the landscape of Philippine cinema, where funding is precarious, distribution systems anaemic, and state culture support present only for the films that do not threaten it, a film like SUNSHINE must already enter the frame pre-legibilised and pre-digested, its rage ironed out for export"
Sunshine,1798,14,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"This is, after all, by the admission of its own producer Bianca Balbuena, a film that delayed its domestic release in order ‘to premiere in top festivals [around] the world to create noise and curiosity’, with the implication that only through international approval could the film attain enough value to justify its own existence at home"
Sunshine,1798,15,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"Thus, to resist the very circuit that enables its existence is impossible, but recognising this sharpens our understanding of the conditions under which those evasions occur"
Sunshine,1798,16,robbgc,,60.0,ltbx,"What we must ask, then, is what kind of complicity we are willing to forgive in a nation that punishes truth so severely that even its cinema must contort just to be heard"
Sunshine,1799,1,00a___00,,180.0,ltbx,i’ll be thinking about that jeepney scene where everything goes silent except sunshine breathing…maris racal you really ate this one up sobranggg ramdam lang talaga yung emosyon

Sunshine,1816,4,erudad,,160.0,ltbx,"In the place of a script full of zingers and disappointing adults, we're taken through an odyssey of this hell hole we live in"
Sunshine,1816,5,erudad,,160.0,ltbx,"But just like sunshine, beauty occasionally slips through the cracks"
Sunshine,1816,6,erudad,,160.0,ltbx,"This is filipino cinema at its finest: authentic, sincere, and full of heart"
Sunshine,1816,7,erudad,,160.0,ltbx,Also kinda crazy but a filipino teacher from my high school cameod here lmao
Sunshine,1817,1,eightwonines,,180.0,ltbx,such an eye-opening film about the harsh realities of women trapped in a society that decides for us
Sunshine,1817,2,eightwonines,,180.0,ltbx,"karapatan nating magsalita, mamili at maging malaya"
Sunshine,1818,1,jhnsmy,,140.0,ltbx,"If the unborn child gets it, your grown ass should as well"
Sunshine,1819,1,pafsymejia44,,180.0,ltbx,Its nothing short of a masterpiece
Sunshine,1819,2,pafsymejia44,,180.0,ltbx,Riveting and striking from start to finish
Sunshine,1819,3,pafsymejia44,,180.0,ltbx,"Even until the credits rolled, I was still stunned and out of words of how hauntingly beautiful this film is"
Sunshine,1820,1,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,DI AKO NANGHINAYANG SA BINAYAD KO
Sunshine,1820,2,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,"Sobrang napukaw ng atensyon ko kung gaano ka realistic ang bawat eksena, ang ingay at lagkitan sa maynila, ang mga deboto ng quiapo church, ang mga ale na nagtitinda ng pamparegla at pampalaglag sa harap ng simbahan, ang kahirapan, ang unwanted pregnancy, ang krisis sa healthcare system, ang aborsyon at ang konsensya ni sunshine na hinahabol sya bawat minuto ng kanyang araw"
Sunshine,1820,3,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,it really captured every struggles ng pagiging babae sa bansang to
Sunshine,1820,4,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,"Sobrang raw, sobrang totoo at sobrang tapang ni direk tonet sa paggawa ng gantong pelikula na sana marami pa ang makapanood"
Sunshine,1820,5,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,"Also, the performance of THE Maris Racal"
Sunshine,1820,6,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,"Dalang dala nya ang emosyon ng manonood, the rage, pain, and bravery of Sunshine"
Sunshine,1820,7,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,"Isa sa talagang nagpa agos ng luha ko ay ang eksena na sumasayaw sya, nakangiti pero ramdam mo ang bawat emosyon"
Sunshine,1820,8,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,"Grabe ang scene na yun, walang dialogue pero tagos sa puso"
Sunshine,1820,9,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,It was really indeed the best performance of her
Sunshine,1820,10,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,"And that ending, i love how direk tonet didnt show what happens to the unborn child, and pinakita na lang na nakaabot sya sa competition, it just shows na ang pagkakaroon ng choice ay magsasalba sa mga pangarap na minsan ng kinain ng sistema ng bansang ito"
Sunshine,1820,11,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,"Gets na gets kita, Sunshine bago ko pa ito panoorin at sana magets ka na rin nila"
Sunshine,1820,12,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,"Ginawa ang pelikula na to hindi lang para sa mga babae, ginawa ito para ipakita sa mga taong hindi nakakaintindi ang reyalidad ni Sunshine"
Sunshine,1820,13,smrhkmcs,,200.0,ltbx,Mahal kita direk tonet sobra
Sunshine,1821,1,sharliiin,,200.0,ltbx,This film gives you the opportunity to judge Sunshine & her decision-making as she deals with the consequences of an act she did not commit alone yet had to face entirely by herself
Sunshine,1821,2,sharliiin,,200.0,ltbx,Dahil sa sistema at mga paniniwalang hindi pabor sa mga kababaihan
Sunshine,1821,3,sharliiin,,200.0,ltbx,"After watching, you might say “gets ko na” as you start to understand how they feel & where they’re coming from"
Sunshine,1821,4,sharliiin,,200.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, that’s only the tip of the iceberg"
Sunshine,1821,5,sharliiin,,200.0,ltbx,You must also imagine the lives of all other Sunshines out there whose stories remain unheard and unseen
Sunshine,1821,6,sharliiin,,200.0,ltbx,"In the real world setting, you no longer have access to every woman’s story"
Sunshine,1821,7,sharliiin,,200.0,ltbx,"But through Sunshine, you gain something just as important: empathy and understanding"
Sunshine,1821,8,sharliiin,,200.0,ltbx,And maybe— just maybe— hindi naman matatapakan ang pagkatao mo if you simply allow women the freedom to decide for their own lives
Sunshine,1821,9,sharliiin,,200.0,ltbx,Kudos to Maris Racal for beautifully executing the role of Sunshine and to Direk Jadaone for passionately pushing this brave and controversial work of art
Sunshine,1822,1,tobioliva,,200.0,ltbx,"It takes a village, but that village needs to be better, especially for women"
Sunshine,1822,2,tobioliva,,200.0,ltbx,Whether that’s here in the Philippines or in the rest of the world
Sunshine,1822,3,tobioliva,,200.0,ltbx,I hope people from all facets of our society can watch this movie and leave with a more compassionate attitude towards women with unwanted pregnancies
Sunshine,1822,4,tobioliva,,200.0,ltbx,"I can only hope the message of this can resonate and make us consider more material support for them, beyond the compassion we ought to show them"
Sunshine,1822,5,tobioliva,,200.0,ltbx,"Oh, and legalize abortion now"
Sunshine,1823,1,wint3rcafe,,200.0,ltbx,Maris racal you are a star

Sunshine,1828,1,sweettalker000,,200.0,ltbx,"It speaks about womanhood, choices, and silence"
Sunshine,1828,2,sweettalker000,,200.0,ltbx,"It shows the grief, the doubt, and the quiet power of a woman choosing herself in a world that rarely lets her"
Sunshine,1828,3,sweettalker000,,200.0,ltbx,"At sa isang bansang tulad ng Pilipinas kung saan kriminal pa rin ang abortion, pelikulang kagaya nito ay hindi lang mahalaga-KAILANGAN"
Sunshine,1828,4,sweettalker000,,200.0,ltbx,This is why stories like Sunshine matter
Sunshine,1828,5,sweettalker000,,200.0,ltbx,They don't just tell— they challenge
Sunshine,1828,6,sweettalker000,,200.0,ltbx,"They peel back the shame, the fear, the silence"
Sunshine,1828,7,sweettalker000,,200.0,ltbx,"Kaya habang nanonood ako, ang tanong ko na hindi ko na matiis:Hanggang kailan magiging krimen ang pagpili para sa sariling katawan"
Sunshine,1828,8,sweettalker000,,200.0,ltbx,Hanggang kailan natin ipagkakait ang dignidad ng babae sa gitna ng pagdurusa

Sunshine,1830,1,wzykid,,180.0,ltbx,One of the strongest films I’ve seen in a while when it comes to making a statement
Sunshine,1830,2,wzykid,,180.0,ltbx,"I went through something that felt like a pregnancy scare not long ago, and those days after finding out were chaotic—existential-crising to the core"
Sunshine,1830,3,wzykid,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine captured that experience so accurately and beautifully
Sunshine,1830,4,wzykid,,180.0,ltbx,"The desperation, the attempts at proper reasoning"
Sunshine,1830,5,wzykid,,180.0,ltbx,it was all there
Sunshine,1830,6,wzykid,,180.0,ltbx,It all made sense

Sunshine,1842,1,kascai,,160.0,ltbx,why are women called selfish for wanting to be able to make their own choices
Sunshine,1842,2,kascai,,160.0,ltbx,sunshine is a film about abortion that is so uniquely filipino
Sunshine,1842,3,kascai,,160.0,ltbx,a beautiful and realistic depiction of being a woman in a very religious country
Sunshine,1842,4,kascai,,160.0,ltbx,one thing i really loved is how sunshine’s faith was not diminished
Sunshine,1842,5,kascai,,160.0,ltbx,"her religion might have taught her that abortion is bad, but if her god is truly an all-loving and forgiving god, wouldn’t he understand why sunshine is making…"
Sunshine,1843,1,ssapb,,200.0,ltbx,gets ko na
Sunshine,1844,1,bumyurger,,160.0,ltbx,Movie so good I bought a pack of condoms on the way out
Sunshine,1845,3,sai16,,200.0,ltbx,gets ko na
Sunshine,1845,4,sai16,,200.0,ltbx,"gets na kita, sunshine"
Sunshine,1846,1,ishamae,,,ltbx,"mahal kita, sunshine"
Sunshine,1846,2,ishamae,,,ltbx,"at mahal na mahal ko kayo, direk tonet, maris racal, at lahat ng mga babaeng naging parte ng kwentong ito"
Sunshine,1846,3,ishamae,,,ltbx,"[4:46AM] iba yung alam mo lang, sa naiintindihan mo talaga"
Sunshine,1846,4,ishamae,,,ltbx,"staying informed is one thing, but feeling it"
Sunshine,1846,5,ishamae,,,ltbx,letting it crack something open in you
Sunshine,1846,6,ishamae,,,ltbx,ibang usapan ‘yon
Sunshine,1846,7,ishamae,,,ltbx,alam kong masama ang aborsyon sa mata ng simbahan
Sunshine,1846,8,ishamae,,,ltbx,"lumaki akong alam 'yon; itinuro, inulit, pinaniwalaan"
Sunshine,1846,9,ishamae,,,ltbx,"alam ko rin kung paano siya tinitignan ng lipunan, ng batas, ng sistemang matagal nang hindi pumapanig sa kababaihan"
Sunshine,1846,10,ishamae,,,ltbx,"isang sistemang feudal, patriyarkal, mapanghusga"
Sunshine,1846,11,ishamae,,,ltbx,"pinalaki tayo rito, pinalo, pinatahimik"
Sunshine,1846,12,ishamae,,,ltbx,pero alam ko rin ito: may karapatan ang babae
Sunshine,1846,13,ishamae,,,ltbx,sa sarili niyang katawan
Sunshine,1846,14,ishamae,,,ltbx,sa sarili niyang desisyon
Sunshine,1846,15,ishamae,,,ltbx,"at sa healthcare na hindi dapat ipinagmamakaawa, kundi kusang ibinibigay"
Sunshine,1846,16,ishamae,,,ltbx,"alam ko rin na hindi dapat tinitingnan ang aborsyon sa lente ng kasalanan o krimen, na para bang awtomatikong mali ang pagpili, at masama ang pumipili"
Sunshine,1846,17,ishamae,,,ltbx,"pero ang hindi ko alam, ang hindi ko kailanman mararanasan sa ganap na paraan, ay kung ano ang pakiramdam"
Sunshine,1846,18,ishamae,,,ltbx,ang bumangon araw-araw dala ang bigat ng isang desisyong walang tama sa paningin ng lahat
Sunshine,1846,19,ishamae,,,ltbx,"ang labanan hindi lang ang sarili mong konsensya, kundi ang mundong hindi kailanman kinilala ang pinagdadaanan mo, ang takot mo, ang dahilan mo"
Sunshine,1846,20,ishamae,,,ltbx,yun ang hindi ko alam
Sunshine,1846,21,ishamae,,,ltbx,at yun ang pinaramdam sa akin ng Sunshine
Sunshine,1846,22,ishamae,,,ltbx,and i think that's where Sunshine really succeeds
Sunshine,1846,23,ishamae,,,ltbx,it doesn’t glorify
Sunshine,1846,24,ishamae,,,ltbx,it doesn’t argue
Sunshine,1846,25,ishamae,,,ltbx,it simply shows
Sunshine,1846,26,ishamae,,,ltbx,it gives us a glimpse
Sunshine,1846,27,ishamae,,,ltbx,"into a life of a young woman, into her choice, into her pain, and the kind of quiet strength we rarely talk about"
Sunshine,1846,28,ishamae,,,ltbx,gusto lang talaga ng pelikula magkuwento tungkol sa isang babae
Sunshine,1846,29,ishamae,,,ltbx,ang dami kong gustong himayin
Sunshine,1846,30,ishamae,,,ltbx,"but if there’s one thing that stayed with me, it’s this: Sunshine gives voice to stories we rarely hear"
Sunshine,1846,31,ishamae,,,ltbx,and maybe we avoid them kasi nga masakit
Sunshine,1846,33,ishamae,,,ltbx,kasi hindi tanggap ng kultura at sistemang kinalakihan natin
Sunshine,1846,35,ishamae,,,ltbx,but that’s exactly why they need to be told
Sunshine,1846,36,ishamae,,,ltbx,what makes the film powerful is how intentional it is
Sunshine,1846,37,ishamae,,,ltbx,"every frame, every silence, every turn it didn’t take"
Sunshine,1846,38,ishamae,,,ltbx,lahat may dahilan
Sunshine,1846,39,ishamae,,,ltbx,it could’ve been more clever
Sunshine,1846,40,ishamae,,,ltbx,it could’ve been more dramatic
Sunshine,1846,41,ishamae,,,ltbx,pero hindi siya nagpakitang gilas
Sunshine,1846,42,ishamae,,,ltbx,"instead, ginamit niya ‘yung simplicity para tumama"
Sunshine,1846,43,ishamae,,,ltbx,para magpa-reflect
Sunshine,1846,44,ishamae,,,ltbx,para magpa-isip
Sunshine,1846,45,ishamae,,,ltbx,what i appreciated most was that it didn’t force me to take a side
Sunshine,1846,46,ishamae,,,ltbx,"it didn’t try to tell me which choice was right, no matter what sunshine ended up deciding"
Sunshine,1846,47,ishamae,,,ltbx,it just asked me to listen
Sunshine,1846,48,ishamae,,,ltbx,to sit with sunshine
Sunshine,1846,49,ishamae,,,ltbx,to be there with her
Sunshine,1846,50,ishamae,,,ltbx,"even when things were loud & messy, even when she herself didn’t know what to do"
Sunshine,1846,51,ishamae,,,ltbx,"and sometimes, that’s all people need"
Sunshine,1846,52,ishamae,,,ltbx,not answers
Sunshine,1846,53,ishamae,,,ltbx,just space
Sunshine,1846,54,ishamae,,,ltbx,and empathy
Sunshine,1846,55,ishamae,,,ltbx,maraming empathy
Sunshine,1846,56,ishamae,,,ltbx,Sunshine moved me to empathize in ways i didn’t expect i could
Sunshine,1846,57,ishamae,,,ltbx,gusto ko rin pala i-highlight kung paano naging karakter ang maynila rito
Sunshine,1846,58,ishamae,,,ltbx,magulo ang maynila
Sunshine,1846,61,ishamae,,,ltbx,"minsan bitag, pero minsan daan palabas"
Sunshine,1846,62,ishamae,,,ltbx,"minsan parang impyerno, pero minsan parang tanging lugar na may pag-asa"
Sunshine,1846,63,ishamae,,,ltbx,"sunshine moved through its chaos looking for clarity, and somehow the city mirrored her confusion"
Sunshine,1846,64,ishamae,,,ltbx,klaustro ang mga eskinita pero may mga puwang
Sunshine,1846,65,ishamae,,,ltbx,noisy yet full of silences
Sunshine,1846,66,ishamae,,,ltbx,"manila is hysterically cruel, yes"
Sunshine,1846,67,ishamae,,,ltbx,"brutal sa babae, sa mahirap, sa pagod"
Sunshine,1846,68,ishamae,,,ltbx,"pero sa likod ng lahat ng ‘yon, may mga sulok na mabait"
Sunshine,1846,70,ishamae,,,ltbx,marunong makinig
Sunshine,1846,71,ishamae,,,ltbx,"may tenderness na hindi nagpapakita, pero nandiyan; in the people who care quietly, in the moments of stillness in between the noise"
Sunshine,1846,72,ishamae,,,ltbx,"and god, maris"
Sunshine,1846,73,ishamae,,,ltbx,maris fucking racal
Sunshine,1846,74,ishamae,,,ltbx,this is hers
Sunshine,1846,75,ishamae,,,ltbx,this is every woman’s story
Sunshine,1846,76,ishamae,,,ltbx,she is a woman in every way that matters
Sunshine,1846,77,ishamae,,,ltbx,alam kong magaling na siya dati pa
Sunshine,1846,78,ishamae,,,ltbx,nakita ko na rin naman ang ibang trabaho niya
Sunshine,1846,79,ishamae,,,ltbx,"but this time, iba"
Sunshine,1846,80,ishamae,,,ltbx,"masarap sa pakiramdam na makita ang isang magaling na babae na hindi nakakabit sa loveteam, walang lalaking bitbit sa screen para lang matawag na lead"
Sunshine,1846,81,ishamae,,,ltbx,"walang kilig, walang branding"
Sunshine,1846,82,ishamae,,,ltbx,sakanya lang talaga ito
Sunshine,1846,83,ishamae,,,ltbx,and that felt right
Sunshine,1846,84,ishamae,,,ltbx,that felt important
Sunshine,1846,85,ishamae,,,ltbx,"the way she portrayed sunshine’s pain and stillness and quiet strength, it just hit"
Sunshine,1846,86,ishamae,,,ltbx,hindi siya umaarte
Sunshine,1846,87,ishamae,,,ltbx,she wasn’t trying to convince anyone
Sunshine,1846,88,ishamae,,,ltbx,she just was
Sunshine,1846,89,ishamae,,,ltbx,"may mga eksena na wala siyang sinasabi, pero ramdam mo lahat"
Sunshine,1846,90,ishamae,,,ltbx,"nakakaiyak siya, pero hindi dahil may music o linyang mabigat"
Sunshine,1846,91,ishamae,,,ltbx,nakakaiyak kasi totoo
Sunshine,1846,92,ishamae,,,ltbx,kasi hindi mo alam kung saan ka huhugot ng ginhawa sa pinagdadaanan niya
Sunshine,1846,93,ishamae,,,ltbx,"totoong haggard nga siya buong palabas hahaha, and it just made so much sense"
Sunshine,1846,94,ishamae,,,ltbx,ganun talaga ang itsura ng babae na napagod na
Sunshine,1846,95,ishamae,,,ltbx,sa sarili
Sunshine,1846,96,ishamae,,,ltbx,sa mundo
Sunshine,1846,97,ishamae,,,ltbx,sa kakaisip ng tama
Sunshine,1846,98,ishamae,,,ltbx,sa sistema na walang binibigay na sagot
Sunshine,1846,99,ishamae,,,ltbx,and yet she kept going
Sunshine,1846,100,ishamae,,,ltbx,and yet she was still trying
Sunshine,1846,101,ishamae,,,ltbx,"that look—the mess, the confusion, the exhaustion, that’s what a woman in the middle of a fight looks like"
Sunshine,1846,102,ishamae,,,ltbx,not dramatic
Sunshine,1846,103,ishamae,,,ltbx,just human
Sunshine,1846,104,ishamae,,,ltbx,"maris, sa’yo talaga ito"
Sunshine,1846,105,ishamae,,,ltbx,no one else could’ve done it this way
Sunshine,1846,106,ishamae,,,ltbx,no one can take this away from you
Sunshine,1846,107,ishamae,,,ltbx,and i hope alam mo kung gaano kahalaga ang binigay mo sa pelikulang ‘to
Sunshine,1846,108,ishamae,,,ltbx,"and the women around sunshine, sila rin ang puso ng kwento"
Sunshine,1846,109,ishamae,,,ltbx,"sa mata pa lang ng bawat isa, kita mo agad"
Sunshine,1846,110,ishamae,,,ltbx,hindi sila filler
Sunshine,1846,111,ishamae,,,ltbx,hindi sila background
Sunshine,1846,112,ishamae,,,ltbx,"si jennica garcia, si annika co, si xyriel manabat, atbp"
Sunshine,1846,113,ishamae,,,ltbx,"pati yung mga sandaling lumitaw lang, ang doktor, ang bantay sa motel, yung pharmacist sa botika, yung babae sa quiapo, maski yung mga babae sa maternity ward"
Sunshine,1846,114,ishamae,,,ltbx,lahat sila may dala
Sunshine,1846,115,ishamae,,,ltbx,lahat sila may pinanggagalingan
Sunshine,1846,116,ishamae,,,ltbx,and they all stood with sunshine in one way or another
Sunshine,1846,117,ishamae,,,ltbx,"iba-iba sila, pero iisa ng tinig"
Sunshine,1846,118,ishamae,,,ltbx,kababaihan ang nagdala ng pelikula
Sunshine,1846,119,ishamae,,,ltbx,kababaihan ang gumising sa kwento
Sunshine,1846,120,ishamae,,,ltbx,"Sunshine isn’t easy to watch, especially if you're a woman in this country— but maybe it’s not meant to be"
Sunshine,1846,121,ishamae,,,ltbx,kasi tunay na kwento siya
Sunshine,1846,122,ishamae,,,ltbx,and real stories don’t always comfort
Sunshine,1846,123,ishamae,,,ltbx,they challenge
Sunshine,1846,124,ishamae,,,ltbx,they disturb
Sunshine,1846,125,ishamae,,,ltbx,they demand something from you
Sunshine,1846,126,ishamae,,,ltbx,and that’s what this film did
Sunshine,1846,127,ishamae,,,ltbx,it made me feel
Sunshine,1846,128,ishamae,,,ltbx,it made me think
Sunshine,1846,129,ishamae,,,ltbx,sobrang ganda napasulat tlg ako ng review
Sunshine,1846,130,ishamae,,,ltbx,i had to sit with it for an hour or two
Sunshine,1846,131,ishamae,,,ltbx,ang husay mo direk tonet
Sunshine,1847,1,philipilihp,,180.0,ltbx,"May nag-uusap kanina sa likod ko habang nanonood ako pero hinayaan ko nalang kasi nasanay na ako, tapos sakto yung scene na sumunod is yung sinabihan si Sunshine na “drown out the noise”"
Sunshine,1847,2,philipilihp,,180.0,ltbx,"Okay lang sana eh kasi may libreng commentary ako, pero nung nalaman na ni Sunshine na buntis na siya, yung lalaki sa likod ko sinabi na “tatanga-tanga” siya"
Sunshine,1847,3,philipilihp,,180.0,ltbx,Medyo nawalan ako ng focus sa panonood dahil sa narinig ko kaya lumipat nalang ako ng pwesto maya-maya
Sunshine,1847,4,philipilihp,,180.0,ltbx,"Sobrang ganda ng paghandle ng movie na ‘to sa topic niya, lalo na sa bansang ‘to na sobrang sensitibo ng mga ganitong usapan kahit na hindi na naman sa ibang bansa, kaya malakas yung respeto ko sa lahat ng involved sa paggawa nito, lalo na si direk Jadaone, kasi kailangan natin ng mga pelikula katulad nito para makasimula ng pag-uusap at pagbabago sa bansang ‘to"
Sunshine,1847,5,philipilihp,,180.0,ltbx,"Ang daming taong tumutol at humamon sa konsensya ni Sunshine sa iba’t ibang paraan, pagkontra sa kanya gamit ang relihiyon, ang batas, ang pera, ang kalalakihan, at iba pa"
Sunshine,1847,6,philipilihp,,180.0,ltbx,"Kada sulok ng Pilipinas may matatamaan, kasama na yung nakaupo sa likod ko, at dapat lang"
Sunshine,1848,1,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Ang pelikulang ito ay tunay na isang sikat ng araw
Sunshine,1848,3,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Tumatagos ang sinag
Sunshine,1848,4,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Totoo siya sa pakiramdam
Sunshine,1848,5,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Dahil totoo nga siya
Sunshine,1848,6,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Totoo si Sunshine
Sunshine,1848,7,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Matatanaw mo lang siya kapag binigyan mo ng oras ang sarili mong huminto at pansinin ang paligid
Sunshine,1848,8,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Saka mo mapagtatanto: kasama natin siya sa bawat hakbang ng kasalukuyan
Sunshine,1848,9,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Kahit sa gabi
Sunshine,1848,10,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Kahit pa sa gitna ng unos
Sunshine,1848,11,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Isa siyang payak na reyalidad—nararamdaman sa dulo ng mga daliri
Sunshine,1848,12,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Parang singaw sa paligid; halos masamyo mo sa hangin
Sunshine,1848,13,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Ganyan siya kasinsid
Sunshine,1848,14,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Ganyan siya humihingi ng pansin
Sunshine,1848,15,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Patuloy siyang lumulusot kahit sa pinakamasisikip at pinakatahimik na puwang ng kaingayan
Sunshine,1848,16,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Siya ang bumabati sa bawat umaga
Sunshine,1848,17,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,"At kahit sa gabi’t hapon, may iniwang peklat—mga bakas na, sa paglaon, bumubuo ng mas malaking larawan"
Sunshine,1848,18,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,"Larawang pumupukaw sa atin tungkol sa mga madalas itinatanggi, pinatatahimik, isinasantabi"
Sunshine,1848,19,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,"Mga bagay na totoo, at tunay namang nangyayari—ngunit ikinukubli"
Sunshine,1848,20,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Tila bawal
Sunshine,1848,21,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Tila tabu
Sunshine,1848,22,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,"Ngunit sila pala ang tunay na bumubuo sa bilog, ngunit nananatiling hindi kinikilala sa tatsulok ng lipunan"
Sunshine,1848,23,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,At ang tanging hangarin ni Sunshine: na maging isa ka sa “atin
Sunshine,1848,25,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Gets ko si Sunshine
Sunshine,1848,26,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,Gets namin siya
Sunshine,1848,27,janeeel,,200.0,ltbx,"Sana, gets din siya ng iba"
Sunshine,1849,1,sznamorolls,,180.0,ltbx,"this movie is one of the many stories of women that are failed to be heard, and one of the many reasons why i will always be for women's rights and choices"
Sunshine,1850,1,jelowatches,,180.0,ltbx,"As a pro-choice person in the healthcare field, this is a harsh and brave storytelling of the reality in the PH"
Sunshine,1850,2,jelowatches,,180.0,ltbx,Maris is a star and the whole cast carried
Sunshine,1851,1,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,"“My body, my choice"
Sunshine,1851,2,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,” But is it really when your options of what you can do with it is stuck in a country overtaken by religion and politics stuck in the medieval times
Sunshine,1851,3,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine falls under one of my most favorite genres: social commentary by simply showing girls just trying to live
Sunshine,1851,4,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,You can see throughout the film that she’s just a girl
Sunshine,1851,5,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,"Asking Miggy for money, asking for help when she needs, acts on her impulse, has dreams and goals, using twitter and Reddit for research (#real), etc"
Sunshine,1851,6,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,"She knows she can’t take care of a whole ass child right now, all she can (and she should) do is to chase her dreams and make a career out of it"
Sunshine,1851,7,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,Though you can also see that Sunshine doesn’t really hate the kid
Sunshine,1851,8,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,"She takes care of her the way she can– giving her money to get home, looking for her when she’s lost, protects her from adult themes (drinking, abortion, etc)"
Sunshine,1851,9,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,"So her decision at the end, it’s not because she hates the kid, it’s because she loves herself"
Sunshine,1851,10,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,"With the limited choices she had, she made the most out of her youth And what’s so wrong with that"
Sunshine,1851,11,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,With being just a girl

Sunshine,1857,2,intothebasquiat,,200.0,ltbx,"the story handled it very delicately without imposing on its audiences, without forcing them to change their opinions"
Sunshine,1857,3,intothebasquiat,,200.0,ltbx,"it became an eye-opener instead, starting conversations and making everyone reflect on their own as well"
Sunshine,1857,4,intothebasquiat,,200.0,ltbx,the film rendered everyone speechless
Sunshine,1857,5,intothebasquiat,,200.0,ltbx,we all clapped after sunshine ended
Sunshine,1857,6,intothebasquiat,,200.0,ltbx,a must-watch film indeed

Sunshine,1858,1,crappychronicle,,200.0,ltbx,"set in the small but chaotic world of what lies below carriedo station, just a girl trying to reach her dreams and do whatever it takes, a pregnancy won't stop her, even if it is illegal in the philippines"
Sunshine,1858,2,crappychronicle,,200.0,ltbx,"a lot of people seemed to leave her behind while she was trying to figure out what to do: the guy who knocked her up just gave money and bailed, the motel staff helped her unto the tricycle but didn't accompany…"

Sunshine,1860,2,janyuan,,160.0,ltbx,a woman that chooses herself has a lot of implications that makes them look selfish
Sunshine,1860,3,janyuan,,160.0,ltbx,"this film is consistently tight, not making moments linger a second longer than it should be"
Sunshine,1860,4,janyuan,,160.0,ltbx,it places urgency to sunshine's situation and i just love how sunshine has full autonomy and gets right to it the moment that she knew
Sunshine,1860,5,janyuan,,160.0,ltbx,"admittedly, a certain plot device employed here might've become a burden in the long run, there's a moment where it felt like the film doesn't know what to do with it, but in the end it still landed pretty well"
Sunshine,1860,6,janyuan,,160.0,ltbx,jadaone throws a lot of anger in this film
Sunshine,1860,7,janyuan,,160.0,ltbx,"an exasperation to the tito bubots of this world, to the judgmental people who's supposed to make you feel safe, to the system that prohibits women to have safer options, but never to sunshine"
Sunshine,1860,8,janyuan,,160.0,ltbx,"what might this film's great achievement is that you feel it too, the film carefully takes you on a walk to make you understand and feel its anger, to understand sunshine, just how much important her dreams are and how she doesn't aspire to be a mother in this time of her life"
Sunshine,1860,9,janyuan,,160.0,ltbx,"women carries the weight of the world the moment they were born, but people like sunshine makes it feel that choosing themselves is an act to be truly selfless and for once be free"

Sunshine,1862,3,noriy,,200.0,ltbx,"sunshine makes me so so so so so happyOVERALL, sunshine as a movie doesn't shout blatantly to your face but speaks volumes about how love, support, and compassion of women can help other women carry what the world too often asks them to bear alone kasi sino pa ba ang tutulong sa isang babae kundi ang kapwa niya babae"

Sunshine,1865,4,spyu,,200.0,ltbx,"nakakainis at nakakaiyak that it is the reality of a lot of women in the ph but as always jadaone inspires us to see women differently, not just victims of their circumstances but empowered"
Sunshine,1866,1,innerfaerie,,200.0,ltbx,"Para akong naglalakad sa bubog habang pinapanood ‘to, damang-dama ang esensya ng isang sining: nambubulahaw ng mga komportable"
Sunshine,1866,2,innerfaerie,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa madaling salita, sobrang epektibo ng pag-arte, sobrang authentic ng bawat eksena"
Sunshine,1866,3,innerfaerie,,200.0,ltbx,Lumabas ako ng sinehan nang ikinakahiya ang pagiging lalaki
Sunshine,1866,4,innerfaerie,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi ko masisisi ang mga nagsasabing may kulang sa mensahe, pero para sa akin ay isang malaking hakbang na ang paglikha ng ganitong uri ng pelikula para mapag-usapan at maipaglaban pa lalo ang reproduktibong karapatan ng mga kababaihan"
Sunshine,1866,5,innerfaerie,,200.0,ltbx,"Idagdag mo pa ang kahusayan nina Maris Racal at Jennica Garcia, doon pa lámang ay deserve nang maipagmalaki ang pelikulang ito"
Sunshine,1867,1,pdfig,,200.0,ltbx,"Direk Tonet knows exactly when to let silence speak, when to drown out the noise, and when to let emotions simmer"
Sunshine,1867,2,pdfig,,200.0,ltbx,"In Sunshine, she invites us into Sunshine’s mental and bodily struggles, but leaves just enough space for the character’s autonomy and our own"
Sunshine,1867,3,pdfig,,200.0,ltbx,"While some films impose what should or shouldn’t be, Sunshine deliberately resists the impulse to moralize— and does so with intention"
Sunshine,1867,4,pdfig,,200.0,ltbx,"Instead, it evokes"
Sunshine,1867,5,pdfig,,200.0,ltbx,It urges us to feel and think through its subtlety
Sunshine,1867,6,pdfig,,200.0,ltbx,Jadaone’s placement of Sunshine’s body within the harshness of Manila is a political act
Sunshine,1867,7,pdfig,,200.0,ltbx,"To know Sunshine, then, is to know the spaces that both suffocate and shelter her"
Sunshine,1867,8,pdfig,,200.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t offer easy answers (or any at all), but that’s precisely what makes it resonate and linger"

Sunshine,1891,2,itseki,,200.0,ltbx,"With abortion being illegal here in the Philippines, many women resort to dangerous methods that put their lives at risk"
Sunshine,1891,3,itseki,,200.0,ltbx,"The movie also highlights how men often evade accountability for such situations, leaving women to bear the heavy burden alone"
Sunshine,1891,4,itseki,,200.0,ltbx,"It sheds light on the prevalent issue of unwanted pregnancies, a reality that is sadly common here"

Sunshine,1892,1,kkairo,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi lamang ito pag-uusapan dahil sa kontrobersyal nitong paksa—humihikayat din siyang mapag-usapan
Sunshine,1892,2,kkairo,,200.0,ltbx,"Nasa isang lipunan tayo na sobrang layo pa sa usaping abortion, at ang isang pelikulang katulad ng Sunshine (2025) ay paniguradong magbibigay liwanag—hindi lang sa usaping abortion—kundi sa usapin din kung paano gamitin ng lipunan ang relihiyon at pulitika para diktahan kung ano ang dapat at hindi dapat gawin ng kababaihan sa sari-sarili nilang mga katawan"
Sunshine,1892,3,kkairo,,200.0,ltbx,"Baka maging susunod na presidente ng pilipinas o baka makahanap ng gamot sa aids, oo"

Sunshine,1892,8,kkairo,,200.0,ltbx,"Kesyo gino-glorify ang abortion, kesyo sumusuporta sa mga desisyon ni Sunshine"
Sunshine,1892,9,kkairo,,200.0,ltbx,"Ano man ang reaksyon at opinyon nila patungkol sa pelikulang ito, malaking hakbang pa rin yung mailagay siya sa lamesa para mapag-usapan"
Sunshine,1892,10,kkairo,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi na dapat natin ito pinag-uusapan ng patago, na para bang malaking kasalanan"
Sunshine,1892,11,kkairo,,200.0,ltbx,Buhay at kinabukasan ng babae ang nakasalalay
Sunshine,1892,12,kkairo,,200.0,ltbx,Kaunting spoiler: sobrang halaga sa akin nung eksena na dumaan muna si Sunshine sa simbahan para humingi ng tawad sa mga desisyong gagawin niya pa lamang
Sunshine,1892,13,kkairo,,200.0,ltbx,Pinapahalagahan ng pelikula ang usaping abortion pero hindi nito binubura ang aspetong moral ng ganoong gawain
Sunshine,1892,14,kkairo,,200.0,ltbx,"Saka, mahalagang detalye rin sa akin yung naroon lamang siya sa labas ng simbahan at hindi siya pumasok—dahil sa tingin niya ay hindi siya karapat-dapat, dahil iba ang catholic guilt ng bagay na gagawin niya"

Sunshine,1913,12,leonaabrera,,160.0,ltbx,"I’m still not a hundred percent sure how I feel about their presence, but I appreciate that it made Sunshine’s plight something to really think about"

Sunshine,1947,5,lifelessbaboy,,200.0,ltbx,my expectations were not disappointed as the movie delivers such a strong message towards the harsh audience which is the Filipino society
Sunshine,1947,6,lifelessbaboy,,200.0,ltbx,everything about the Philippines' secular practices to its contradictions that are laid by the patriarchal nature of the country—it was cruelly portrayed in the movie transparently
Sunshine,1947,7,lifelessbaboy,,200.0,ltbx,that's what i loved about everything that had transpired in the hour and hour-half time i sat in my seat
Sunshine,1947,8,lifelessbaboy,,200.0,ltbx,"everything was in color too—something our country is quite known for; though maris racal had played the role of Sunshine, her character had pretty much went through the storms of what seemed to be an unplanned pregnancy that would become her hindrance in achieving her dreams"

Sunshine,1947,18,lifelessbaboy,,200.0,ltbx,"as said by Doc Helena, our God is a forgiving god; the statement echoes towards the ending as sunshine weighed out her choices"
Sunshine,1947,19,lifelessbaboy,,200.0,ltbx,"it was not a matter of letting something go, it was a matter of reaching for something that was always there"
Sunshine,1947,20,lifelessbaboy,,200.0,ltbx,"ika nga, talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not; and for sunshine, she grabbed the chance"

Sunshine,1948,1,ysasine,,200.0,ltbx,"fuck the patriarchy fuck the government and (i would) fuck piolo pascualbut jokes aside, the movie really showed the harsh realities women have to face in this god forsaken country,, with our deeply embedded religious roots to how society is geared towards men, leaving women to fend for themselves"

Sunshine,1951,1,p3co,,180.0,ltbx,"mamaya ka sakin may gagawin lang ako saglet Most likely born from Carlos Yulo's gold win in the olympics and the emergence of recent abortion films such as Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Jadaone presents how teenage pregnancies ruins lives and dreams and how the lack of freedom for women in a religion oppressed third world country is a problem as alarming as any other"
Sunshine,1951,2,p3co,,180.0,ltbx,Although clearly being influenced by recent films tackling similar subject matter 'Sunshine' separates itself from the pack simply because it's set in a country where abortion is illegal
Sunshine,1951,3,p3co,,180.0,ltbx,With no abortion clinics and only shady abortion pills how is a teenage woman chasing her dreams let alone a 13 yr old girl raped by her own uncle supposed to reclaim the life that was supposed to be ahead of them
Sunshine,1951,4,p3co,,180.0,ltbx,"Portraying Manila as a neverending,never resting street filled with people desperate to find whatever they are looking for"
Sunshine,1951,5,p3co,,180.0,ltbx,How it is a city filled with the kindest people stuck in the most cruel of circumstances
Sunshine,1951,6,p3co,,180.0,ltbx,Contradictory to its title the film never shows us a sun that is shining but rather a moon desperate to try and shine on its own despite the world telling her she can never do so alone

Sunshine,1957,1,peterpocka,,180.0,ltbx,likes:- made use of scenes very efficiently which meant i didn’t notice that the movie was pretty short because it was packed with necessary ones - made me think of its relevance towards gymnastics in the middle only to bring me back to it once i did- gave the audience enough time for the characters to grow on them without it feeling forced - stuck to it its message with conviction and without diversion unlike other films trying to include as much social commentary as they could - muntik na ako pumalakpak sa gymnastics ni maris- magaling ramdam na ramdam at amoy na amoy ko yung baho at dugyot ng maynila dislikes:- sobrang dilim medyo masakit sa mataremarks:- it was amusing to see the similarity in cinematography of the quiapo scenes of maris and the ones taken of yas in our film for ethics with the same theme

Sunshine,1992,1,mico_orda,,100.0,ltbx,"It's decent to say the least, it's a Jadaone movie for Jadaone fans"
Sunshine,1992,2,mico_orda,,100.0,ltbx,"But that's the thing, it's myopic that it themes and logic of the narrative presented is as only limited as the filmmaker's worldview to say the least, or rather it is limited to how Jadaone sees the subject matter in regards to abortion and having an agency which is told in such a simplistic way, lacking that empathy and how objective it is"
Sunshine,1992,3,mico_orda,,100.0,ltbx,"However, I commend the script to call out against the prejudiced perception but that's how it is, it did not hold accountable to it, and while Sunshine had conviction to make her decision in the end, and matters in her own hands, it didn't feel unearned to be honest"
Sunshine,1992,4,mico_orda,,100.0,ltbx,"Like who is Sunshine to the audience, as a main character"
Sunshine,1992,5,mico_orda,,100.0,ltbx,"Why do the audience should root for her, I think the screenplay failed to make its audience care and thank god Maris Racal made it somehow work because she did put effort to act in those dramatic scenes and it shows she's into that role, kudos for putting an extra work on gymnastic scenes"
Sunshine,1992,6,mico_orda,,100.0,ltbx,"But in some light hearted scenes, it felt like she didn't convey those emotions that at times it felt monotone"
Sunshine,1992,7,mico_orda,,100.0,ltbx,She could've shown a more human and relatable side of Sunshine
Sunshine,1992,8,mico_orda,,100.0,ltbx,"It didn't helped that the runtime could've expanded or improve some things that were lacking, but overall the film did ok"
Sunshine,1992,9,mico_orda,,100.0,ltbx,"Lastly, I have a message to those who are invoking Brocka's name or likening it to the film or the filmmaker: ""keep his name out of your mouth"
Sunshine,1993,1,jjyeguie,,180.0,ltbx,gets ko na

Sunshine,1996,2,vkjrchs1127,,180.0,ltbx,Pinapakita ng pelikulang ito na walang sinuman ang dapat magdikta sa kanilang mga desisyong lalo na't kung pangarap ang pag-uusapan
Sunshine,1996,3,vkjrchs1127,,180.0,ltbx,"Hindi ako babae, pero naiparamdam sa akin ang takot, hirap, lungkot"

Sunshine,1997,1,czyra,,200.0,ltbx,Oh what do you do when one day you suddenly have to choose between two futures
Sunshine,1997,2,czyra,,200.0,ltbx,"One is sacrificing now for a future you dreamt and believed in, which meant the other is sacrificing that future for a responsibility you couldn't ignore"
Sunshine,1997,3,czyra,,200.0,ltbx,It was a quiet death of one life so another could begin
Sunshine,1997,4,czyra,,200.0,ltbx,"And whatever she chooses, she sure will wonder what could have grown with what she left behind"
Sunshine,1998,1,23rkhs,,200.0,ltbx,"Sorry, pero hindi niyo gets maging isang babae sa Pilipinas"
Sunshine,1999,1,raizines,,100.0,ltbx,"that one dark, ominous, motel window shot scaling sunshine’s room and the passing train gave me wkw flashbacks"
Sunshine,2000,1,chnocruz,,180.0,ltbx,Two things: 1) Tonet Jadaone dialogue’s and pacing is absolutely masterful

Sunshine,2005,1,verrrated,,180.0,ltbx,"Ito ang pelikulang mumulat sa’yo sa mga karapatang pantaong dapat pahalagahan, ang pelikulang mag-uudyok na abutin ang mga pangarap, at ang pelikulang magpaparanas ng sakit sa lipunan"
Sunshine,2005,2,verrrated,,180.0,ltbx,"Madaling makibaka, mahirap makiramdam pero pinatunayan ng pelikulang ito na kaya natin umintindi"
Sunshine,2005,3,verrrated,,180.0,ltbx,"At sa bawat pag-intindi, may magbubukas na kamalayan"
Sunshine,2005,4,verrrated,,180.0,ltbx,"This movie may not be all sunshines and rainbows, but the light it brings, shines hope into our almost despairing society"

Sunshine,2007,1,brycekhione,,200.0,ltbx,I love this film
Sunshine,2007,2,brycekhione,,200.0,ltbx,It delivers a powerful message about why the legalization of abortion is important
Sunshine,2007,3,brycekhione,,200.0,ltbx,People get pregnant due to many reasons; not just because they wanted to have sex
Sunshine,2007,4,brycekhione,,200.0,ltbx,"If abortion is illegal, then abandoning women after impregnating them or raping them should carry serious legal consequences as well"
Sunshine,2007,5,brycekhione,,200.0,ltbx,(oo may serious consequences ang rape pero hindi naman kasi ito binibigyan pansin masyado kaya nga takot mag sumbong ang mga victims meaning HINDI SIYA ENOUGH to scare the rapists)This is a must-watch
Sunshine,2007,6,brycekhione,,200.0,ltbx,An eye-opener for people who prioritize their beliefs over understanding the bigger picture of why women choose illegal abortion despite the risks
Sunshine,2007,7,brycekhione,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi illegal abortion ang sagot
Sunshine,2007,8,brycekhione,,200.0,ltbx,Tamang sex education at ang karapatan ng babae sa sarili nilang katawan ang dapat unahin
Sunshine,2008,1,makitan,,160.0,ltbx,could’ve gone a much traditional/conservative way through the final act but im so happy it didn’tIbang-iba ka direeekk tonet
Sunshine,2009,1,k444ye,,180.0,ltbx,This really is a socio-realism film
Sunshine,2009,2,k444ye,,180.0,ltbx,I honestly get what the other’s say when they said na parang nakukulangan sila sa story but to me it is complete and a great starter conversation for why sex education is really needed for teenagers
Sunshine,2009,3,k444ye,,180.0,ltbx,"Cause let’s be honest most of the teenagers don’t really know what to do, they just mostly learn from what they watch like pornography that will lead up to a lot of teenage pregnancy"
Sunshine,2009,4,k444ye,,180.0,ltbx,And i also like the symbolism doon sa jeep na sinakyan ni sunshine may nakalagay na “Gift of God” while sunshine is thinking of aborting the baby inside her
Sunshine,2009,5,k444ye,,180.0,ltbx,wala lang its the small details the really make the shotSobrang effective talaga ng pag arte ni Maris Racal like give ko talaga kay ate and also to Jennica Garcia as ate ni Sunshine sobrang

Sunshine,2011,1,yshrivera,,200.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,2013,1,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,“pasalamat ka kay Papa God
Sunshine,2013,2,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,” pasalamat ka para sa sining ng pagpepelikula
Sunshine,2013,3,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,madali lang naman mahalin ang pelikulang ito
Sunshine,2013,4,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"tulad ng pagmamahal sa mga bagay na pinaniniwalaan at pinaninindigan mo: madali, simple, at walang pag-aalinlangan"
Sunshine,2013,5,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,there is no doubt that i would love this film effortlessly because the direk tonet jadaone formula never fails in empowering women in their strongest moments; and even more so in their struggles in the fucked up reality of living in a third world country where they are robbed of their freedom to choose
Sunshine,2013,6,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"i loved all the little details in sunshine’s home; the subtle reference to problematic people supporting fascists and corrupt politicians; and the way the city of manila is captured in all of its colors, filth, and beauty—showing us familiar roads and alleyways, reminding us of the vibrancy and dullness of the thousands of lives that passed us by"
Sunshine,2013,7,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,but what struck me the most is the irony of abortion pills being illegally sold where you can buy a statue of Sto
Sunshine,2013,8,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"Niño, an image of the Child Jesus who was born from an unplanned pregnancy (albeit God-willed and wholeheartedly accepted by Mary if you’re Catholic)"
Sunshine,2013,9,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"because much like this visual, i do believe that devotion to God and the right to choose for yourself are not mutually exclusive"
Sunshine,2013,10,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"if you’re using your belief to shun others instead of understanding them, then you’re not living up to your faith"
Sunshine,2013,11,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"i’ve said it before in past movie reviews—to me, unsafe abortions are the most horrific thing you can show your audience and i’ve seen two other films before, one more vivid than the other"
Sunshine,2013,12,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,but this one in sunshine is the most painful and depressing
Sunshine,2013,13,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,hihilingin mo talaga na sana walang babae sa mundo ang makaranas nito
Sunshine,2013,14,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,how can something regarded as the source of life drain the life out of a woman
Sunshine,2013,15,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,ang pinakamahirap lunukin na katotohanan ay mayroon at mayroong mga babaeng makakaranas nito kung hindi magkakaroon ng maayos na sex education sa ating mga paaralan at hanggat walang access ang lahat sa reproductive health at safe abortions sa bansa
Sunshine,2013,16,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"saludo ako sa tapang mo, direk tonet, to show something no other director of today is not afraid to do so"
Sunshine,2013,17,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,naniniwala akong ang kababaihan ang pinagmulan ng mundo
Sunshine,2013,18,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"quite literally, babae ang nagdala at nagluwal sa ating lahat"
Sunshine,2013,19,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"kaya maraming salamat sa pelikulang ito dahil nabigyan ng spotlight hindi lang ang mga babaeng tulad ni sunshine at ni mary grace, pero pati na rin ang mga babaeng tulad ng ate ni sunshine, kaibigan niyang si thea, ang kanyang coach eden, si doctor helena, at pati na rin ang babaeng bantay sa avenida inn na walang pag-aatubiling tumulong sa kanya"
Sunshine,2013,20,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"this is womanhood, ika nga"
Sunshine,2013,21,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"marahil para sa’yo, ang mga babaeng ito ay iyong ina, ate, kapatid, pinsan, kaibigan o kasintahan"
Sunshine,2013,22,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"pero isa lang ang sigurado, may mga babae sa buhay nating nagsisilbing kakampi natin sa araw-araw at dapat lang silang bigyang-pugay at pasalamatan"
Sunshine,2013,23,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,(please stop reading at this point if you don’t want spoilers for the ending
Sunshine,2013,24,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,")at first, i thought annika’s character is sunshine’s manifestation of her younger self or her inner child that serves as her conscience in every decision she makes"
Sunshine,2013,25,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"but when we’re introduced to ariana, it’s finally clear to me that they were sunshine’s manifestation of the unborn babies from her and mary grace’s unwanted pregnancies"
Sunshine,2013,26,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,this is why that “gets ko na” scene is so powerful
Sunshine,2013,27,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"because after relentlessly asking for forgiveness from God for reasons she couldn’t fully understand, she finally forgives herself for choosing herself and her dreams"
Sunshine,2013,28,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,minsan ay may ni-repost si direk sa twitter and it is all about the paths our mothers did not take when they chose to love us instead
Sunshine,2013,29,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"when i read that, i just cried"
Sunshine,2013,30,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"obviously, i am thankful my mama chose me but honestly, i would’ve understood if she didn’t"
Sunshine,2013,31,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"i am glad i chose to watch this spontaneously on a work night (thank you, biancake, sa biglaang aya"

Sunshine,2013,35,seaofnostalgia,,180.0,ltbx,"hiling ko lang na sa bawat tahanang nalalagpasan ng aking sinasakyan, may mga babaeng naaabot ang pangarap nang hindi nahihirapan"

Sunshine,2015,2,pistachio_0,,160.0,ltbx,"kung ayaw niyo naman palang panagutan yung babae, mag condom kayo o di kaya putulin niyo na lang itet niyo"
Sunshine,2015,3,pistachio_0,,160.0,ltbx,"pero on a serious note, this film is truly a masterpiece, capturing the horrors of unsafe abortion in the philippines"
Sunshine,2015,4,pistachio_0,,160.0,ltbx,maris’ role reflects the struggles of women’s access to genuine healthcare
Sunshine,2015,5,pistachio_0,,160.0,ltbx,kaya sana ipasa na ang abortion bill

Sunshine,2018,2,jhndjs,,200.0,ltbx,i've been waiting for this film to be launched since last year and it did not disappoint
Sunshine,2018,3,jhndjs,,200.0,ltbx,pinakita ng pelikulang ito kung gaano kahirap ang pinagdadaanan ng mga kababaihan sa mata ng mapanghusgang lipunan
Sunshine,2018,4,jhndjs,,200.0,ltbx,tears were shed nung scene na ni sunshine at ate geleen

Sunshine,2020,1,annahmuhrray,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is more than a story of a promising teenager, it is an illustration of how women traverse a situation of compromise in which each option is seen as greed and demise"
Sunshine,2020,2,annahmuhrray,,200.0,ltbx,"Nonetheless, it was always Sunshine’s choice to choose Sunshine"
Sunshine,2021,1,rockyhoerror,,160.0,ltbx,i cried silently in my seat a few times
Sunshine,2021,2,rockyhoerror,,160.0,ltbx,i mean how can you not when you remember you’re a filipino woman living in this hell hole
Sunshine,2021,3,rockyhoerror,,160.0,ltbx,"always failed by men, by society, by the government and even by your own religion"
Sunshine,2021,4,rockyhoerror,,160.0,ltbx,i had been anticipating this film’s release for so long as i’m hoping it will somehow finally get people talking about something as controversial as abortion
Sunshine,2021,5,rockyhoerror,,160.0,ltbx,"so stigmatized and taboo, i literally even took a while to decide whether or not i should write that word down"
Sunshine,2021,6,rockyhoerror,,160.0,ltbx,i’m relieved that this film went where i hoped it would go
Sunshine,2021,7,rockyhoerror,,160.0,ltbx,i might write a longer review soon but for now i’m just going to say antoinette jadaone was so brave for this
Sunshine,2022,1,drrnjhn_,,180.0,ltbx,ramdam ko ang mga binibitbit na emosyon ni sunshine sa bawat unat ng kaniyang katawan at sa pag kumpas ng kaniyang laso mula sa umpisa hanggang sa dulo ng pelikula
Sunshine,2022,2,drrnjhn_,,180.0,ltbx,madaming sinira o binasag ang pelikula na ito sa kung anong sistema na mayroon ngayon sa bansa

Sunshine,2024,5,elle_angel,,200.0,ltbx,all aspects of this film are soooo good
Sunshine,2024,6,elle_angel,,200.0,ltbx,what a film
Sunshine,2024,7,elle_angel,,200.0,ltbx,i don't have enough words to properly review this because it did left me speechless
Sunshine,2024,8,elle_angel,,200.0,ltbx,this is so painfully real to many women—young and not
Sunshine,2024,9,elle_angel,,200.0,ltbx,i got out of that cinema still in dazed because it's that beautifully raw and brave
Sunshine,2024,10,elle_angel,,200.0,ltbx,"i can't help but to think of my mom and her internal struggle with herself getting pregnant as a young woman when at that time, she was also dreaming the life she wanted just as much Sunshine did in this film"
Sunshine,2024,11,elle_angel,,200.0,ltbx,we all dreamed and are still dreaming
Sunshine,2024,12,elle_angel,,200.0,ltbx,"this film gives me so much hope in everything good, despite the unfortunate events"
Sunshine,2024,13,elle_angel,,200.0,ltbx,what a film indeed
Sunshine,2025,1,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,I can already imagine the discourse once marelease to sa VOD
Sunshine,2025,2,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"First of all, I think it is so bold of Jadaone to come up with a concept that is so simplistic yet so real and full of grit despite the subject’s thematic weight"
Sunshine,2025,3,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,Abortion remains to be a debatable matter in the Philippines and opinions are always highly polarized among liberals and conservatives
Sunshine,2025,4,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"Despite the country’s right-wing political ideologies, there are still calls from progressive groups urging the government to legislate better constitutions on health and reproductive rights for the benefit of those who need it most"
Sunshine,2025,5,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine happens to be one of these people
Sunshine,2025,6,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a dedicated gymnast and an aspiring Olympian
Sunshine,2025,7,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"With only a few weeks left to polish and brush up on her routine, she suddenly found herself in a bind that put her faith, morals, and self-worth to the test"
Sunshine,2025,8,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t let us stay in a hopeful frame of mind; rather, it propels us to empathize with the character and question whatever is wrong and fucked up with the system"
Sunshine,2025,9,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"When Sunshine found out she was pregnant, her first instinct was to get rid of it"
Sunshine,2025,10,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,Pray it away
Sunshine,2025,11,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,End it even if it means drowning in a cycle of self-destructive behaviors
Sunshine,2025,12,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,It was clear from the very start she didn’t want to push through and she held onto that
Sunshine,2025,13,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,I guess that’s as far as I can go for now so as to not give away too much of the plot
Sunshine,2025,14,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"I watched this alone sa sinehan kanina and as soon as the credits rolled, i overheard someone sa likod ko saying na ‘bitin’ daw, and i totally get the sentiment that maybe for some people medyo half-baked or kulang ang storya"
Sunshine,2025,15,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"But sometimes, films don’t have to be loud in order to hit the right spots"
Sunshine,2025,16,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"With its very straightforward premise and message, I think Sunshine deserves the amount of hype it’s getting"
Sunshine,2025,17,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,The sports industry is already overwhelmingly taxing and having to face added burdens brought about by unwanted pregnancy can be way more damaging than one can fathom
Sunshine,2025,18,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is not a film that will convince you to change your moral and political convictions; rather, it clings to the little hope of making the audience understand that the dilemma Sunshine had to face isn’t something that exists only in the reel world, but something that is very much present in the real world—in a society where bodily autonomy often comes at a social cost"
Sunshine,2025,19,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"Above all else, one thing’s clear is we really need better and safer reproductive laws in the Philippines so women wouldn’t have to go through under-the-table practices that put their lives on the brink of death"
Sunshine,2025,20,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"However, with the current political climate, i guess it’s realistic to assume we’re still a little far off"
Sunshine,2025,21,kitchienadoll,,200.0,ltbx,"But with films like Sunshine, I’d like to think there’s still an ounce of hope for our country to perhaps embrace ideals that give primacy to women’s autonomy and rights, at the very least"
Sunshine,2026,1,ayesak21,,200.0,ltbx,“Gets ko na
Sunshine,2026,2,ayesak21,,200.0,ltbx,”I think Sunshine is Direk Tonet’s best work yet
Sunshine,2026,3,ayesak21,,200.0,ltbx,"It is simplistic, raw, and bothering but it is wrapped in a cute pink ribbons that seeks to hide the harsh truths women in our society face"
Sunshine,2026,4,ayesak21,,200.0,ltbx,The bits of humor at times give audiences a space to laugh and forget how heavy the message of the film is and then it just hits you with its narrative and the core message behind it
Sunshine,2026,5,ayesak21,,200.0,ltbx,"My favorite scene was the conversation between Ariana and Bata, it was both pro life and pro choice which may be a hard thing to pull off but the team did it effortlessly"
Sunshine,2026,6,ayesak21,,200.0,ltbx,I loved how raw and unfiltered it is and how it became a eureka moment for the other audiences
Sunshine,2026,7,ayesak21,,200.0,ltbx,I am in no way fit to write a long ass review about the them of the film because stories like these are rooted in everyday struggles of women in such violent and patriarchal society
Sunshine,2026,8,ayesak21,,200.0,ltbx,"I loved the film but I would love more hearing how women react and talk about this film, sila ang tanging nararapat na magexpound lalo nito at naka supporta lang ako"
Sunshine,2027,1,jimiblake,,200.0,ltbx,This movie surprised on how well-made it is from start to finish
Sunshine,2027,2,jimiblake,,200.0,ltbx,I rarely watch local movies (I know I should be more active) but this very much convinced me it’s a 5/5 movie
Sunshine,2027,3,jimiblake,,200.0,ltbx,Everyone from this movie pulled their weight jnto making this masterpiece
Sunshine,2027,4,jimiblake,,200.0,ltbx,From story to acting to cinematography to the grueling face of Manila
Sunshine,2027,5,jimiblake,,200.0,ltbx,This is a movie that’s worthy of millions
Sunshine,2028,1,tristhany,,200.0,ltbx,subverts all kinds of toxicity of Filipinos
Sunshine,2028,2,tristhany,,200.0,ltbx,i love how direk antoinette promotes safe sex and shows the consequences of irresponsible sex but at the same time challenges the norm of ideologies and beliefs of the Philippines’ stance on pro-choice and pro-life
Sunshine,2028,3,tristhany,,200.0,ltbx,"i think i believe when people say that, this is the best antoinette jadaone film"
Sunshine,2028,4,tristhany,,200.0,ltbx,sorry fangirl
Sunshine,2029,1,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Habang nasa kalagitnaan ng pelikula, nasabi ko na lamang sa sarili ko, “Para saan ba talaga ‘tong pelikula na ‘to"
Sunshine,2029,2,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Ano bang point nito
Sunshine,2029,3,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"” Yun pala, ako lang ang hindi agad naka-gets"
Sunshine,2029,4,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Ang fucked up lang kasi isipin kung yung bata ay literal na physical manifestation ng nasa tiyan ni Sunshine, parang anim na taong gulang na anyo ng dapat sana’y magiging anak"
Sunshine,2029,5,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Mas fucked up pa kasi kinokonsensya niya si Sunshine (tinawag siyang murderer)
Sunshine,2029,6,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Pero later on na-realize ko: hindi siya totoong bata, kundi visual representation lang ng internal conflict ni Sunshine"
Sunshine,2029,7,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Siya yung konsensya
Sunshine,2029,8,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Siya yung maliit na boses sa loob
Sunshine,2029,9,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Siya rin si Sunshine
Sunshine,2029,10,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Kaya hindi talaga tungkol sa journey ni Sunshine sa pag-abot ng mga pangarap niya ang pelikula
Sunshine,2029,11,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Mas tungkol ito sa batang karakter—na hindi rin pala talaga bata—at sa mas malawak na karanasang pangkababaihan
Sunshine,2029,12,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Kasi sa totoo lang, ang kwento ng abortion ay hindi tungkol sa bata"
Sunshine,2029,13,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Ito ay tungkol kay Sunshine
Sunshine,2029,14,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Sa mga babae
Sunshine,2029,15,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Sa mga may katawan
Sunshine,2029,16,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Sa mga may kakayahang magdesisyon para sa sarili nila
Sunshine,2029,17,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Maganda naman ang ending
Sunshine,2029,18,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Medyo parang Modess commercial nga lang (charot)
Sunshine,2029,19,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Pero kung tatanungin ako, feeling ko may kulang"
Sunshine,2029,20,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Bilang manonood, hindi ko gaanong naramdaman ang bigat ng emosyon"
Sunshine,2029,21,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Kulang sa lalim
Sunshine,2029,22,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Kulang sa hugot
Sunshine,2029,23,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Pero nabawi naman sa pagganap ng mga aktor—walang tapon, mahusay ang lahat"
Sunshine,2029,24,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Isang halimbawa ng kakulangan sa emotional connection para sa akin ay yung eksenang umiiyak si Sunshine sa loob ng inn habang isinasagawa ang abortion
Sunshine,2029,25,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Malapit na akong bumigay nun, ramdam na ramdam ko na, pero biglang nag-cut to a shot from outside the window of her emoting and yung maingay na traffic"
Sunshine,2029,26,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Aesthetic, oo"
Sunshine,2029,27,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Maganda, pero di ko gusto"
Sunshine,2029,28,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Parang sinampal ako pabalik sa reyalidad na, “Hoy, hindi ka kasama sa kwento"
Sunshine,2029,29,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,” Saksi ka lang
Sunshine,2029,30,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"I don’t know about you guys, but I don’t like that"
Sunshine,2029,31,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Favorite scene ko siguro ay yung early scene sa pelikula, yung umiiyak si Sunshine sa jeep"
Sunshine,2029,32,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Maingay sa simula, tapos unti-unting tumahimik habang nakatutok lang ang lente sa kanya"
Sunshine,2029,33,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Ang galing nun
Sunshine,2029,34,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Ang ganda
Sunshine,2029,35,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"In addition, siksik sa intensyon ang mga detalye—katulad ng painting sa unahan ng jeep na may nakasulat na “Gift from God"
Sunshine,2029,36,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"” Hala siya, eh di ikaw na ang tumanggap"
Sunshine,2029,37,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"(charot)Anyways, ang dami kong nasabi"
Sunshine,2029,38,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Pero ngayon na lang naman ‘to
Sunshine,2029,39,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Ang galing ni Maris
Sunshine,2029,40,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,At isang malaking middle finger sa mga mahilig makialam sa buhay ng iba—lalo na’t hindi naman hinihingi ang opinyon nila
Sunshine,2029,41,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,Wala rin namang ambag
Sunshine,2029,42,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,"Oo, may ambagan"
Sunshine,2029,44,kimmmmiko,,140.0,ltbx,5 star kasi super ganda ng official poster

Sunshine,2034,3,hijeanne_,,,ltbx,it’s so
Sunshine,2034,4,hijeanne_,,,ltbx,upfront—so bold
Sunshine,2034,5,hijeanne_,,,ltbx,and yet there’s this sting of compassion and comfort by how it gave familiarity sa mga bagay na nararanasan—pati na rin ang mga matatag na opinyon—ng mga tao sa totoong buhay
Sunshine,2034,6,hijeanne_,,,ltbx,"and oh my God, i literally prayed with sunshine as i was watching"
Sunshine,2034,7,hijeanne_,,,ltbx,life can truly be beautiful if you see it

Sunshine,2036,4,jh0n,,200.0,ltbx,"It doesn't scream any agenda on you, instead it quietly holds your hand and asks you to listen"
Sunshine,2036,5,jh0n,,200.0,ltbx,This film made me realize just how unfair this world can be to women
Sunshine,2036,6,jh0n,,200.0,ltbx,"It is hard enough to be a woman, even more so to be a woman in the Philippines"

Sunshine,2039,6,nikola_kulasa,,160.0,ltbx,"Each realities matter yet beliefs they hurt-from a Conservative Christian Obgyne female doctor who cannot fathom how a young woman would not want to give birth, to a female Quiapo vendor selling abortifacients in front of a Church, to a dear sister who raised her both siblings who will love her no matter what (Jennica's performance here is so superb, I almost cry), to a 13 year old girl who been raped because by a family member, and finally Maris Racal's Sunshine who undergo making a decision, a choice--that is so hard and required ethics, but understandably absorbed into her role, how every woman in the Philippines simply existing is so exhausting"
Sunshine,2039,7,nikola_kulasa,,160.0,ltbx,"But also how the patriarchy compels women as their biggest supporter draping the country's public health that hurt and judge women for their choice, to the point of penalizing them as criminals"

Sunshine,2043,2,kdreyes,,200.0,ltbx,It is an eye-opener that sparks significant discussion in terms of how Filipinos perceive situations in a traditional and conservative way
Sunshine,2043,3,kdreyes,,200.0,ltbx,"I definitely loved how it tackled this controversy while focusing on Sunshine’s dream, which represents many teenage girls that suffered from unwanted pregnancies"
Sunshine,2043,4,kdreyes,,200.0,ltbx,"In this hour-and-a-half film, it did highlight the majority belief yet also countered it in different narratives"
Sunshine,2043,5,kdreyes,,200.0,ltbx,"Despite being so interested in pre-watching the film, I still didn’t expect how the film has featured many symbols and situations that Filipinos have to realize"
Sunshine,2043,6,kdreyes,,200.0,ltbx,"I get so emotional about how the storyline has approached this issue, and I hope to see more of this in our country"
Sunshine,2043,7,kdreyes,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is the right actress for the role

Sunshine,2045,4,threassha,,200.0,ltbx,"lahat ng matagal nang tinitiis at pinapasan ng kababaihan, inilatag sa liwanag para mapag-usapan, maintindihan, at matanggap"

Sunshine,2050,2,rannzy,,,ltbx,"the film rly captures the loneliness and desperation of googling options for sexual health, not knowing who to turn to, calculating probabilities for pregnancy, mitigating risk of judgment and humiliation"

Sunshine,2062,2,fck_ayn_rand,,200.0,ltbx,"An unmelodramatic (if you found it melodramatic, I personally feel that may say more about you than the film"
Sunshine,2062,3,fck_ayn_rand,,200.0,ltbx,) and unflinching portrayal of the Hell that the Philippines is for girls and women
Sunshine,2062,4,fck_ayn_rand,,200.0,ltbx,"Somehow, even in all its white-hot rage, Sunshine approaches its controversial topic most of all with kindness, empathy, and understanding"
Sunshine,2062,5,fck_ayn_rand,,200.0,ltbx,I am overcome by an urge to watch every other previous Antoinette Jadaone film ASAP
Sunshine,2062,6,fck_ayn_rand,,200.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal, with this single performance, cements herself as our most talented actor from her generation"

Sunshine,2065,2,zmerald,,160.0,ltbx,"sabi nila, hindi mo pwede husgahan ang isang tao hangga’t hindi mo nararanasan maglakad ng milya sa sapatos niya, at naniniwala ako do’n kasi habang sinasamahan ko si sunshine sa paglalakbay niya, nakita ko ang masalimuot na reyalidad ng maraming kababaihan na walang karapatan pumili"
Sunshine,2065,3,zmerald,,160.0,ltbx,"bawat isa, iba’t iba ang pinapasan, magkakaiba ang pinanggalingan, pare-parehas nakataya ang buhay"

Sunshine,2069,5,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,"i felt sorry, but i genuinely understand"
Sunshine,2069,6,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,i also just want to commend ms jennica garcia’s performance
Sunshine,2069,7,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,"as an Ate myself, i feel like despite the <intense> reactions that people around me think i’ll be like if in any case i end up being in that same position, i think i would react like sunshine’s Ate"
Sunshine,2069,8,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,"it’s already a cruel reality, people like sunshine just needs a pair of understanding ears, a heart, and a warm embrace"
Sunshine,2069,9,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,i feel like i really broke down when jennica repeatedly said ‘i love you
Sunshine,2069,10,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,’ with the most sincere and most genuine tone
Sunshine,2069,11,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,i really really loved how sunshine’s performance for the competition ended with a face shot or whatever you call it
Sunshine,2069,12,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,i like how it ended without seeing how the competition she worked and sacrificed so much went
Sunshine,2069,13,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,"for me, her actual performance was the one with annika watching it"
Sunshine,2069,14,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,"that “gets ko na” carried so much SO MUCH emotions in it that you really just have to agree na oo, gets mo rin"
Sunshine,2069,15,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,it has been a magical experience to be able to watch this film on the big screen
Sunshine,2069,16,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,i can’t believe i only paid 230 pesos to feel THAT much
Sunshine,2069,17,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,"thank you, sunshine"
Sunshine,2069,18,soyongdori,,200.0,ltbx,i offer you so much love and respect
Sunshine,2070,1,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,so much has been said about the bravery to tackle an important but still quite taboo issue in the country but it just cannot be overstated
Sunshine,2070,2,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,i left the cinema today with a lot of heavy thoughts and feelings that i cant perfectly explain but i think a lot of that is rooted in sadness and anger
Sunshine,2070,3,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,sadness over the realization that as a woman i see myself in more ways than one in sunshine
Sunshine,2070,4,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,i may not have gone through a similarly tumultuous experience but there are bits and pieces of her character that i see myself in
Sunshine,2070,5,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,at times it felt jarring to recognize those
Sunshine,2070,6,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,"as a healthcare worker myself, i can say that a lot of the scenes in this movie arent far from reality"
Sunshine,2070,7,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,they’re sometimes even worse
Sunshine,2070,8,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,and it’s just
Sunshine,2070,10,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,this film heightened the anger i have… directed at

Sunshine,2070,13,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,the government
Sunshine,2070,15,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,my emotions about this are still all over the place really
Sunshine,2070,16,nmjk,,180.0,ltbx,what i do know is that this film will stick with me for years
Sunshine,2071,1,sisikatkaiha,,180.0,ltbx,"i love how this film showed na nasa babae lagi ang bigat when it comes to unplanned pregnancies—walang proper support; lahat ay tutol sa desisyon na gustuhin magka abortion ang babae, walang proper sex education para maiwasan ito at higit sa lahat, walang proper healthcare for it"
Sunshine,2072,1,dendenl0rd,,200.0,ltbx,Nakalimutan ko yatang empath ako at nagulat pa ‘ko sa OA ng hagulgol ko POTAAAAAAAASunshine is a game changer

Sunshine,2078,1,dreocalonzo,,120.0,ltbx,"This movie is brave in tackling a very delicate issue, but at times, it tries too hard to deliver its message"
Sunshine,2078,2,dreocalonzo,,120.0,ltbx,"It needed more grit and heart, and less aesthetics and preachiness"
Sunshine,2078,3,dreocalonzo,,120.0,ltbx,"The bit with the pregnant teenage girl felt like a random device, which is unfortunate given the weight it carried on the film's plot"
Sunshine,2078,4,dreocalonzo,,120.0,ltbx,"Still, I like how it tried to take on subjects like incest, poor maternal health, Catholic guilt"
Sunshine,2078,5,dreocalonzo,,120.0,ltbx,"It works well when it shows its heart -- the tender moments between sisters, the heartbreaking text message to a friend before a risky decision"
Sunshine,2078,6,dreocalonzo,,120.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal is good, and the supporting cast also deserves a lot of praise (the Quiapo vendor was great)"

Sunshine,2084,10,shamydunne,,200.0,ltbx,"Kasi tao lang si sunshine, napapaligiran ng mapanghusga, ng mga taong tinuturing na krimen ang abortion"
Sunshine,2084,11,shamydunne,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang gandang representation na bukod sa physical pain na pagdadaanan ng babae sakin unsafe abortion choices, meron pa syang internal battle sa guilt at konsensya nya"
Sunshine,2084,12,shamydunne,,200.0,ltbx,"Nung nawala si Annika, takot na takot si sunshine, nakakapagtaka kasi e ayaw nya naman talaga si Annika in the first place"

Sunshine,2089,1,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,i have so many thoughts and feelings for this film
Sunshine,2089,2,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,"but it’s just a great film, hands down"
Sunshine,2089,3,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,"throughout, we see sunshine behind and through bars and whenever we see her beyond it, her choices feel cathartic (like dasurv masiraan ng kotse"
Sunshine,2089,4,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,dasurv mabasagan ng beer sa ulo
Sunshine,2089,5,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,) i found the hospital scenes to be the hard-hitting ones since there are so much to unpack
Sunshine,2089,6,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,"like either way, you’re trapped—trapped alongside the many other women who are forced to share hospital beds in public health centers/clinics/hospitals or either, you end up fighting for your life when the abortifacients don’t work"
Sunshine,2089,7,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,"given the structures around us, the choices we are given do not serve us nor empower us, which then make these other options more enticing"
Sunshine,2089,8,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,"despite this dreary reality, i found myself being emotional during the final sequence"
Sunshine,2089,9,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,sunshine finds herself free in gymnastics and that’s what she gets to do and she gets to drown out the noise
Sunshine,2089,10,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,"and that’s all what we’re advocating for, for women to have the choice"
Sunshine,2089,11,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,GOD i love this film sm
Sunshine,2089,12,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,i do think it’s a good first step in addressing abortion in contemporary PH cinema
Sunshine,2089,13,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,we are doing this film a disservice if we expect it to fully encompass the extent of nuances of this experience
Sunshine,2089,14,annanihcole,,180.0,ltbx,"what we can hope for, perhaps, is the exploration of more nuanced stories like sunshine’s to be seen and heard"
Sunshine,2090,1,shanayaurrrr,,200.0,ltbx,the movie was very raw and what saddens me the most is this is someone’s experience and it’s not impossible because in society lalo na sa ph na very religious centered instilled w/ such shame and discrimination among other ppl — women & abortion should not sit on the same table that’s why it’s very stigmatized kaya ive always been a pro-choice and never did and never will shame women who went through that — i embrace them with so compassion and empathy

Sunshine,2097,6,euridice,,160.0,ltbx,whose dreams and potential are more important
Sunshine,2097,7,euridice,,160.0,ltbx,"sunshine the movie doesn’t answer these questions outright, leaving you to chew on them instead and come to your own conclusions"
Sunshine,2097,8,euridice,,160.0,ltbx,"at the start, i found the narrative device of the child as a manifestation of sunshine’s guilt a little too on-the-nose, but the pay-off in the ending made it worth it"
Sunshine,2097,9,euridice,,160.0,ltbx,"as the ending says: gets ko nabut the best parts of sunshine are when it dwells on the almost fantastical ridiculousness of manila—not just the place, but also the people"
Sunshine,2097,10,euridice,,160.0,ltbx,details like the abortifacient vendor using the money sunshine gave her to “bless” her holy figurines or the santo niños looming over their whole transaction or dangerous illegal abortions followed by scenes of overflowing maternity wards
Sunshine,2097,11,euridice,,160.0,ltbx,the movie passes no judgement on these scenes but merely offers them up for observation: here is manila in all it’s messy glory
Sunshine,2097,12,euridice,,160.0,ltbx,it’s the perfect backdrop for sunshine’s series of bad choices
Sunshine,2097,13,euridice,,160.0,ltbx,(and also reminiscent of lino brocka’s film style which i absolutely ate up)
Sunshine,2098,1,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,ABSOLUTE CINEMAwhat i love abt this movie is its soooo honest
Sunshine,2098,2,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,"it tackles abortion, a topic thats still seen as taboo in a conservative country"
Sunshine,2098,3,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,this movie DOESNT glorify abortion
Sunshine,2098,4,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,what it does is offer a different perspective into the lives of women who go through this experience
Sunshine,2098,5,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,i love how determined and full sunshine is
Sunshine,2098,6,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,"full of dreams, full of courage"
Sunshine,2098,7,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,"she is the kind of woman who chooses her own path and fights for it, kahit gaano kahirap"
Sunshine,2098,8,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,"her story is not just about abortion, its about freedom, choice, and dignity"
Sunshine,2098,9,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,women should have the right to decide for their own bodies
Sunshine,2098,10,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,"after all, kami ang makakaranas ng lahat, physically, emotionally, mentally"
Sunshine,2098,11,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,mo one else should dictate what we can or cannot do with our own life
Sunshine,2098,12,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,i love how the film doesnt try to force an opinion on the viewers
Sunshine,2098,13,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,"instead, it invites you to listen and understand"
Sunshine,2098,14,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,"it shows us why some women make this choice, not because they want to, but because sometimes, they have to"
Sunshine,2098,16,kkluize,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang ganda
Sunshine,2099,1,polklore,,200.0,ltbx,10/10 tangina napakaganda

Sunshine,2100,1,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Siguro nasabi na ang halos lahat ng magagandang aspeto ng pelikulang Sunshine, pero may isang bagay talaga ang tumatak sa akin: ang ilaw"
Sunshine,2100,2,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi ko alam kung sinadya man ito, pero napansin ko kung paanong ginagamit ang ilaw upang i-spot si Sunshine"
Sunshine,2100,3,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa bawat eksenang naggi-gymnastics siya, ramdam mo ang goals at motivation ng karakter niya"
Sunshine,2100,4,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Tunay nga na siya si Sunshine, siya ang liwanag"
Sunshine,2100,5,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang bawat eksena sa loob ng training court ay nagmistulang higaan ng dilaw na liwanag, puno ng pangarap, dedikasyon, at pag-asa"
Sunshine,2100,6,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Pero sa tuwing lalabas siya ng gym, sa tuwing aalis siya sa mundo ng gymnastics, unti-unting dumidilim ang paligid"
Sunshine,2100,7,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang bahay nila, na nasa gitna ng nakakasulasok na usok ng Maynila"
Sunshine,2100,8,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,Ang pampublikong ospital na kalunos-lunos ang itsura
Sunshine,2100,9,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang mga kalsada ay madilim, makulimlim, nakakalunod ang ilaw"
Sunshine,2100,10,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Habang bumabalot ang dilim, makikita sa mukha ni Sunshine, lalo na sa kanyang mga mata, ang pagnanais niyang kumawala"
Sunshine,2100,11,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Parang sinasabi ng mga mata niya, ayaw ko ng ganito"
Sunshine,2100,12,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,Ayaw niya ng dilim
Sunshine,2100,13,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,Ayaw niyang masakal ng mundong nasa labas ng kanyang pangarap
Sunshine,2100,14,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,Siguro ang pelikulang ito ay hindi lang tungkol sa abortion
Sunshine,2100,15,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,Isa rin itong kwento ng mga batang babaeng may pangarap
Sunshine,2100,16,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,Kung paanong nililimitahan ng lipunan ang kakayahan nilang abutin ang mga pangarap nila
Sunshine,2100,17,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,Kung paanong pinangungunahan at dinidiktahan ang mga desisyon nila kung ano ang “tama” o “mali” habang sabay na pinipigilan silang lumipad nang malaya
Sunshine,2100,18,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang dami ko nang nasabi, pero grabe, wala talaga akong masabi sa galing mo, Maris"
Sunshine,2100,19,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang husay mo, sobra"
Sunshine,2100,20,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"At ikaw naman, Direk Tonet, ang tindi mo"
Sunshine,2100,21,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"Dati, pinapakinggan ko lang yung opinyion mo tungkol sa abortion sa AWKP, tapos ngayon, pelikula na siya"
Sunshine,2100,22,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,Kwento na siya
Sunshine,2100,23,steveaves18,,200.0,ltbx,"At hindi lang basta kwento, kwentong siguradong magpapasimula ng usapan, diskurso, at ingay"

Sunshine,2102,14,jpwon,,200.0,ltbx,"It shows us something real, something painful, and something that many woman go through but too afraid to talk about"
Sunshine,2102,15,jpwon,,200.0,ltbx,"there’s sunshine everywhere, not only gymnast or to other sports"

Sunshine,2103,2,hypers,,160.0,ltbx,"Very strong performances all-around; I was surprised that aside from one performance (sorry Piolo Pascual, him appearing out of nowhere just kind of took me out of the movie; maybe on a rewatch it won't bother me as much), every one else did a fantastic job"
Sunshine,2103,3,hypers,,160.0,ltbx,"Aside from Maris Racal, Jennica Garcia who plays her sister was a stand-out for me"
Sunshine,2103,4,hypers,,160.0,ltbx,The tightrope balance of comedy and drama…
Sunshine,2104,1,favedollofgod,,200.0,ltbx,UTTERLY MOVING

Sunshine,2106,2,shayneshaylo,,180.0,ltbx,So many moments I’ve wanted to cry cuz it felt so real
Sunshine,2106,3,shayneshaylo,,180.0,ltbx,It’s like seeing how fucked up religion can influence actual laws
Sunshine,2106,4,shayneshaylo,,180.0,ltbx,Doctors that are too religious to not have actual empathy
Sunshine,2106,5,shayneshaylo,,180.0,ltbx,The genuine hypocrisy from our society
Sunshine,2106,6,shayneshaylo,,180.0,ltbx,It’s all too real
Sunshine,2106,7,shayneshaylo,,180.0,ltbx,I hope this film changes the narrative of our country

Sunshine,2107,1,abiclf,,160.0,ltbx,Sarap yakapin ni Sunshine nung nasa Avenida Inn sya
Sunshine,2107,2,abiclf,,160.0,ltbx,"Interesting din that they got ""Sunshine"" from the name of the doctor that helped them develop the story"
Sunshine,2107,3,abiclf,,160.0,ltbx,Husay ni direk tonet
Sunshine,2108,1,sajuliebee,,200.0,ltbx,"had this been a light hearted movie, my review wouldve probably just left it at ""its aria-NUH, slay slay slay slay"" but i dont really think that this movie deserves that"
Sunshine,2108,2,sajuliebee,,200.0,ltbx,i saw the trailer sometime last year
Sunshine,2108,3,sajuliebee,,200.0,ltbx,"from that, i knew that there was something special about it after just hearing ""drown out the noise, you're sunshine, olympian"" and knowing the under-covered struggle, mental battles that Sunshine goes through in this film"
Sunshine,2108,4,sajuliebee,,200.0,ltbx,"it felt heavy, but familiar"
Sunshine,2109,1,reviewsbygia,,180.0,ltbx,Antapang ng movie na ito
Sunshine,2109,2,reviewsbygia,,180.0,ltbx,Likha ng kababaihan para sa kapwa kababaihan
Sunshine,2110,1,ronnieacruz,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa dami ng opinyon ng mga tao lalo na kapag tungkol sa katawan ng babae, iba ang ginawa ng Sunshine"
Sunshine,2110,2,ronnieacruz,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi ito dumaan sa maingay na diskusyon o pakikipagtalo
Sunshine,2110,3,ronnieacruz,,200.0,ltbx,"Tahimik lang siya, dala dala ang katotohanang hindi kayang ipaliwanag ng statistics, relihiyon o moralidad"
Sunshine,2110,4,ronnieacruz,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi siya ginawa para kumbinsihin ka o pasayahin ka
Sunshine,2110,5,ronnieacruz,,200.0,ltbx,"Ginawa siya para ipakita kung ano talaga ang nangyayari, at maramdaman mo kung gaano ito kabigat"
Sunshine,2110,6,ronnieacruz,,200.0,ltbx,"Kwento sya ng libo-libong babae na tahimik lang, pero araw-araw may dalang mabigat na desisyon"
Sunshine,2110,7,ronnieacruz,,200.0,ltbx,"Yung tipong kahit gusto mong may makausap, mas nauuna pa rin yung kaba kasi madalas, ang sumasalubong hindi pag-unawa kundi panghuhusga"
Sunshine,2110,8,ronnieacruz,,200.0,ltbx,Ang Sunshine ay paalala na hindi lahat ng sakit ay may eksenang iyakan
Sunshine,2110,9,ronnieacruz,,200.0,ltbx,"minsan, nasa katahimikan ng paglalakad pauwi, sa paghawak sa tiyan, sa pag-iwas ng tingin, sa pagbitbit ng bigat na hindi mo pwedeng ibahagi kahit kanino"
Sunshine,2110,10,ronnieacruz,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi ito pelikulang dapat lang mapanood, pelikula ito na dapat pakinggan"
Sunshine,2110,11,ronnieacruz,,200.0,ltbx,"Dahil sa mundo kung saan ang babae’y madalas pinagdidiskitahan, ang Sunshine ay isang matapang na bulong: ‘Pakinggan mo naman kami"
Sunshine,2111,1,wabybipes,,160.0,ltbx,"probably the epitome of the contemporary 2020s philippine cinema; gorgeously shot (an understatement in itself), amazing performances (also, an understatement to maris racal and jennica garcia's acting chops), grounded yet careful writing that walks in eggshells around controversial topics"
Sunshine,2111,2,wabybipes,,160.0,ltbx,"however it's not afraid to step on some and make crack noises megamall; ayan, izih, gian, santi"
Sunshine,2112,1,thisisjohnnnn,,180.0,ltbx,one of the films I would watch over and over again and still hurt
Sunshine,2112,2,thisisjohnnnn,,180.0,ltbx,few minutes in the film and all i can say is this is a very different maris i am watching
Sunshine,2112,3,thisisjohnnnn,,180.0,ltbx,and direk tonet

Sunshine,2113,1,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"I LOVE THIS SO MUCH  two things: (1) you already know my gripe with movies nowadays being too self-aware, esp when making commentary on social issues (e"
Sunshine,2113,3,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,through infodump dialogues and/or in-your-face monologues)
Sunshine,2113,4,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"given the themes of this movie, i was initially scared that this'll end up having the same issue— but THANK GOD that wasn't the case here"
Sunshine,2113,5,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,this one actually took the effort to situate us in Sunshine's shoes
Sunshine,2113,6,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"it knew how to convey Sunshine's story by fleshing out the world that she lives in, by showing how she relates to others, by showing us the things she does not do and does not say"
Sunshine,2113,7,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,this movie knows how to practice restraint
Sunshine,2113,8,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"that's how it managed to really make Sunshine shine :D(2) i love that this movie makes a very decisive stance on abortion, without having uhhhh such a cold attitude towards children"
Sunshine,2113,9,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"like, never once did Sunshine change her mind about having an abortion, and this movie also made several strong cases about how motherhood disadvantages/endangers women— but it also makes it clear that the problem is not"
Sunshine,2113,10,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,the babies/children
Sunshine,2113,11,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"in fact the children are also victims here, as shown in Ariana's case"
Sunshine,2113,12,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"instead of being shown as ~the problem~ pa nga, this movie instead shows us that children may symbolize hope and companionship and possibilities"
Sunshine,2113,13,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"the unwanted pregnancy made life difficult for both Menggay and Ariana— but wasn't it Ariana, still, who stood up for Menggay"
Sunshine,2113,14,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"what Sunshine went through throughout the entire film was difficult and isolating— but she wasn't exactly alone, was she"
Sunshine,2113,15,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"hindi man niya gusto 'yung bata, there was a part of her that sought comfort from the possibility of the child's companionship"
Sunshine,2113,16,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"i think it's just human nature, yenno, to seek connections from others when going through a difficult time"
Sunshine,2113,17,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"and when you live in a society where you can't disclose all these troubles to anyone, not even to those closest to you— whose companionship can you seek, if not your own flesh that's taking shape into another life"
Sunshine,2113,18,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,sino pa ba ang mas makakaintindi sa 'yo kundi ang sarili mong laman at dugo
Sunshine,2113,19,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"yeah in practice that may not be true LOL kaya nga ipinaabort pa rin ni Sunshine eh xD kahit anong ""romantic"" ng notion na susuportahan ka ng anak mo anuman ang pangarap mo, that's practically impossible when its very existence is what could hinder you from reaching them lol"
Sunshine,2113,20,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"pero ayun nga, it's the difficulty of the situation and our human vulnerabilities that add nuance to these discussions"
Sunshine,2113,21,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,—some pro-choice people (and i know they mean well naman) like to claim that abortion is ok because it's just getting rid of some soulless clumps of tissue anyway
Sunshine,2113,22,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,and i guess that's scientifically true
Sunshine,2113,23,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,but if fetuses are rly just soulless clumps of tissue then why are we so afraid of pregnancy at all
Sunshine,2113,24,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,why do we want to do abortions as early as possible
Sunshine,2113,25,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,"I MEAN LIKE, it's silly to keep dismissing the possibility of actual growing life when discussing these things"
Sunshine,2113,26,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,and the fact that Sunshine Did Not Do That makes this movie good and relevant and real and special and a must-must-must-must watch
Sunshine,2113,27,grcceries,,160.0,ltbx,i love this movie <33 i hope more people get to see it
Sunshine,2114,1,handprints,,200.0,ltbx,"in a world where girls are called disgrasyada for carrying the consequences of what boys get to laugh of, where religion teaches you guilt before it teaches you choice, Sunshine makes you sit in that reality"
Sunshine,2114,2,handprints,,200.0,ltbx,this film should hurt and make you uncomfortable because it’s real
Sunshine,2114,3,handprints,,200.0,ltbx,this is what is happening to us women and children
Sunshine,2114,4,handprints,,200.0,ltbx,imagine ah the first thing she did when she found out na buntis siya is bumisita sa simbahan para mag sorry
Sunshine,2114,5,handprints,,200.0,ltbx,we are raised in a country to fear God more than to trust our own body
Sunshine,2114,6,handprints,,200.0,ltbx,it just feels like we are destined to bleed
Sunshine,2114,7,handprints,,200.0,ltbx,this film didn’t try to redeem anyone
Sunshine,2114,8,handprints,,200.0,ltbx,it didn’t even ask for forgiveness
Sunshine,2114,9,handprints,,200.0,ltbx,it just told the truth and maybe that’s the bravest thing it could doSunshine you are so loved by me
Sunshine,2114,10,handprints,,200.0,ltbx,best film i’ve watched so far that is just so raw & vulnerable
Sunshine,2114,11,handprints,,200.0,ltbx,"i teared up watching this, especially the part na tinabihan siya ng ate nya :,)"

Sunshine,2115,6,abellojf,,180.0,ltbx,Ive really been waiting for so long to rate a new filipino film high and rave about it

Sunshine,2115,13,abellojf,,180.0,ltbx,"Ito, may grit sya, may saktong texture, may angas"
Sunshine,2115,14,abellojf,,180.0,ltbx,Sabihin na nating pretentious pero it’s really a big part of making “cinema” happen hahahaMARIS RACAL mahal kita and it never waivered

Sunshine,2117,5,clhned,,200.0,ltbx,"sobrang galing ni Maris, di ko siya nakita as Maris Racal in this film ramdam ko na siya talaga si Sunshine"
Sunshine,2117,6,clhned,,200.0,ltbx,it was a performance of a lifetime and her best film to date
Sunshine,2117,7,clhned,,200.0,ltbx,"this film depicts kung gaano nagpagiiwanan and close-minded yung mga pinoy with topics about abortion lalo na at taliwas ito sa religion natin, it also shows how unfair our healthcare and justice system is"
Sunshine,2117,8,clhned,,200.0,ltbx,"the fact na halos walang kakampi karamihan nang mga nakaka-experience nang unwanted pregnancy, sobrang nakaka-lungkot na kahit mga hospital hindi ka matutulungan dahil hindi legal ang abortion sa bansa"
Sunshine,2117,9,clhned,,200.0,ltbx,i hope that more filipinos watch this and be open on why abortion has to be legal in the philippines
Sunshine,2117,10,clhned,,200.0,ltbx,"sobrang ganda talaga, wala na akong masabi"
Sunshine,2118,1,kazintahan,,200.0,ltbx,"mula palang sa pagbili ng pregnancy test, hanggang sa paglalahad ni sunshine na ayaw niyang maging ina, kapansin-pansin ang paulit-ulit na pagsumbat sa kanyang pagiging bata"

Sunshine,2157,6,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,And so are all the other sunshines in the world
Sunshine,2157,7,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,"I have debated about the topic of teenage pregnancy a few times now and all i wish for is a better system in our country, and more support for the girls who have no choice, wether from strangers, family, loved ones, non-governmental organizations, or governmental ones,, even just that is rare haha"
Sunshine,2157,8,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,"Abortion is not murder, it’s saving your life; and aswell as your child’s life from being put into an environment that isn’t meant for them"
Sunshine,2157,9,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,Adoption after labor isn't always the right choice
Sunshine,2157,10,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,Imagine if u actually gave birth to it and put it up for adoption that ends the baby up in a worse household noh
Sunshine,2157,11,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,"If a girl isn’t ready to give birth, and has an independent choice, there shouldn’t be people to stop her at that point"
Sunshine,2157,12,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,One thing i dislike hearing is people bringing religious “morality” into the topic
Sunshine,2157,13,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s honestly super disrespectful, don't want to elaborate it anymore"
Sunshine,2157,14,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,"Everything else aside, well no,, i just wanted to finally say how beautiful and educational this film was, the message was loud, raw, and clear, and is such an eye-opener to people who are unfamiliar with the topic; to see the authenticity of what teenage victims in the philippines go through, we see two perspectives, (Arianna) a little girl in a toxic household r’ed by her uncle, (Sunshine) and a young adult going through pregnancy, not being able to bare seeing another girl torturing her body— both suffering through the judgements of their fellow filipinos"
Sunshine,2157,15,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,This shows that we can never truly understand what somebody is going through unless we experience it in our own hands
Sunshine,2157,16,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,But i wont forget about Annika Co in this movie ofc
Sunshine,2157,17,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,"Her part of being here shows na nde masama turuan ang mga kabataan tungkol sa mga gantong sensitibo na topic, and that Sunshine was never alone in her journey, Annika’s character was there to guide Sunshine on her journey, even though they had hardships with their relationship together, in the conclusion, the kid understood how Sunshine felt, and supported her throughout the end and that is more than enough"
Sunshine,2157,18,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,"Basta i love u sunshine  this was not just a review of the movie, but also my personal rant feeling the reality beyond this fictional movie"
Sunshine,2157,19,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,Absolute cinemahay kingina tlg ni miggy and bubot
Sunshine,2157,20,sbr2death,,180.0,ltbx,I do not glorify teenage pregnancy/abortion but we should not disregard our rights as women to be able to make our own decisions for our future
Sunshine,2158,1,vergelyoooow,,180.0,ltbx,PERIOD (pun intended)
Sunshine,2159,1,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,no one tells you how alone it feels
Sunshine,2159,2,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,to carry something you didnt ask for
Sunshine,2159,3,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,"to suffer in silence because your pain is inconvenient, because your choices are not yours"
Sunshine,2159,4,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,sunshine didnt just show that
Sunshine,2159,5,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,it made me remember it
Sunshine,2159,6,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,it made me feel it again
Sunshine,2159,7,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,i watched it twice
Sunshine,2159,8,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,"and both times, it hurt in the same places"
Sunshine,2159,9,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,but it also touched something soft in me
Sunshine,2159,10,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,a reminder im not the only one whos ever felt this way
Sunshine,2159,11,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,her name was sunshine
Sunshine,2159,12,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,but nothing about her story was light
Sunshine,2159,13,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,"and maybe thats the point—women are expected to shine, even when everything inside is collapsing"
Sunshine,2159,14,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,she made bad choices
Sunshine,2159,16,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,"but what choices do we really have, when the world makes decisions for our bodies before we even know how they work"
Sunshine,2159,17,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,"what choice does a girl have when the world punishes her for not being ready, and punishes her again for trying to survive it"
Sunshine,2159,18,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,when the system has failed us already when they have decided that bearing a baby is a demand and not a choice
Sunshine,2159,19,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,and i felt seen
Sunshine,2159,20,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,in all the things i was too scared to say out loud
Sunshine,2159,21,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,the hiding
Sunshine,2159,22,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,the pain you cant tell your mother about
Sunshine,2159,23,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,the googling
Sunshine,2159,24,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,"the not knowing where to get pills, or how to afford them"
Sunshine,2159,25,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,"the fear of your own body, and the shame of not understanding it"
Sunshine,2159,27,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,ang hirap maging babae
Sunshine,2159,28,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,lalo na sa bansang pilit kang pinatatahimik
Sunshine,2159,29,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,and still—there was warmth
Sunshine,2159,30,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,there was sunshine
Sunshine,2159,31,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,"because somehow, this film made me feel less alone"
Sunshine,2159,32,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,because stories like this remind us that we are not alone
Sunshine,2159,33,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,that our pain is not isolated
Sunshine,2159,34,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,"that someone out there is watching too, and feeling seen"
Sunshine,2159,35,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,that is what sunshine gave me
Sunshine,2159,36,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,a relieving and painful kind of light
Sunshine,2159,37,drpippir,,200.0,ltbx,"that not everything has to be healed, sometimes it just has to be shared"
Sunshine,2160,2,franniesyt,,,ltbx,"Had a few elements that were pretty clunky but the razor-edge, frayed rawness sold the everyday dream of a coming-of-age Filipina coming of age in a country where the very same notion is downright dangerous"
Sunshine,2160,3,franniesyt,,,ltbx,Maris Racal might just be the finest young actress amongst her contemporaries
Sunshine,2161,1,eiatags,,200.0,ltbx,Kakampi mo ako
Sunshine,2161,2,eiatags,,200.0,ltbx,I think what felt most important to me about this film is that the sensitivities considered in writing this story ensured that reality was still being shown
Sunshine,2161,3,eiatags,,200.0,ltbx,"It showed respect for the people direk was able to interview, and it showed disdain for the culture we perpetuate in the guise of religion and culture"
Sunshine,2161,4,eiatags,,200.0,ltbx,It calls for the audience to see the effects of the choices they ask of others
Sunshine,2161,5,eiatags,,200.0,ltbx,"It calls for empathy for the victims and what they have to go through and give up — their dreams, their childhood, their life"
Sunshine,2161,6,eiatags,,200.0,ltbx,"And it calls for disgust for the old ways of thinking, and possibly our skewed views on morality"
Sunshine,2161,7,eiatags,,200.0,ltbx,"And in these hard times, how proper support from the people around you can allow you to make decisions for yourself and not because of what others will think"
Sunshine,2161,8,eiatags,,200.0,ltbx,Something that most people do not readily have in our society
Sunshine,2161,9,eiatags,,200.0,ltbx,Every moment of this film has emphasized a deep-rooted societal problem that was asking to be seen
Sunshine,2161,10,eiatags,,200.0,ltbx,And kudos to direk Tonet for doing so beautifully
Sunshine,2162,1,pelikuluh,,180.0,ltbx,peak philippine cinema

Sunshine,2163,1,halostica,,200.0,ltbx,sana mabuksan pa lalo ang usapin about abortion sa pilipinas at sana mas lalo pa tayong maging matapang na ipaglaban ang karapatan natin
Sunshine,2163,2,halostica,,200.0,ltbx,"i cannot stress enough how banning abortion doesn't stop women from getting it, it only put their lives at risk"
Sunshine,2163,3,halostica,,200.0,ltbx,mahal kita sunshine
Sunshine,2164,1,mkdctr,,200.0,ltbx,"MAHAL NA MAHAL KITA SUNSHINE, MARY GRACE AT SA LAHAT NG MGA BABAE NA PATULOY NA BINIBIGO NG SISTEMASa daming babae na napapahamak dahil sa unsafe abortion, masasabi pa ba nating gumagana ang mga kasalukuyang batas at religious teachings to actually protect life"
Sunshine,2164,2,mkdctr,,200.0,ltbx,Sana mapanood ‘to ng mga taong hindi pa naiintindihan nang lubusan ang buong konsepto o yung mga pinipiling hindi buksan ang kanilang mga mata
Sunshine,2164,3,mkdctr,,200.0,ltbx,Sana pagkalabas na sinehan ay masasabayan din nila si bata na bumulong ng “Gets ko na
Sunshine,2165,1,avgchill,,160.0,ltbx,Cried four times lol
Sunshine,2165,2,avgchill,,160.0,ltbx,"While I don’t think this movie is going to convert any pinoy pro-lifers, I also don’t think that’s the movie’s purpose anyway"
Sunshine,2165,3,avgchill,,160.0,ltbx,"This movie is so pinoy, or at least in the Manila sense"
Sunshine,2165,4,avgchill,,160.0,ltbx,"The city noise, the sweltering heat, all radiating in the background of Sunshine’s journey to get an abortion"
Sunshine,2165,5,avgchill,,160.0,ltbx,I wouldn’t say the movie’s perfect—I have some issues with the use of Sunshine’s motivations as a student athlete being a little flat—but the movie resonates in the parts where it matters
Sunshine,2166,1,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,"Although Sunshine (2024) advanced the conversation about abortion and body autonomy, one treatment of the film sets the conversation back"
Sunshine,2166,2,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,"Don't get me wrong tho', it effectively presented difficult conversations within an already difficult subject"
Sunshine,2166,3,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,"It doesn't just talk about abortion in the moral sense, but also its nuances—such as abuse and inaccessibility of healthcare, including both financial and policymaking aspects that rob women of the right to appropriate medical procedures"
Sunshine,2166,4,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,"It also gave face to the concept of guilt through the personification of the unborn, embodied by the characters of the unnamed child and Ariana"
Sunshine,2166,5,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,But that very personification is where exactly the issue starts
Sunshine,2166,6,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,"The argument for the pro-choice position is the fact that life does not start at conception, but upon delivery"
Sunshine,2166,7,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,To personify unborn fetuses strengthens the narrative that abortion is murder
Sunshine,2166,8,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,"""Murderer,"" as the unnamed child called Sunshine the moment abortion crossed her mind upon knowing that she's pregnant"
Sunshine,2166,9,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,But how much does this set the conversation back
Sunshine,2166,10,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,"Not a lot, really"
Sunshine,2166,11,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,The film did not fail in doing its job
Sunshine,2166,12,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,"By tackling abortion itself, it already succeeded in sparking conversations such as this one"
Sunshine,2166,13,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,And that's already a huge step in advancing women's right to accessible healthcare
Sunshine,2166,14,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,"Let's just hope that we'll get to see more ""woke indie films"" like Sunshine (2024)"
Sunshine,2166,15,justinaerys,,160.0,ltbx,"Art, after all, is not solely for its own sake"

Sunshine,2169,3,odihiro,,200.0,ltbx,"the pain i had to endure alone every night, playing the waiting game, taking in all the harsh words everyone would say"
Sunshine,2169,4,odihiro,,200.0,ltbx,this film just brings back the pain i suffered through but it also encapsulated how the people around me supported and stayed with me through it
Sunshine,2169,5,odihiro,,200.0,ltbx,may this film be a comfort to the other sunshines out there
Sunshine,2169,6,odihiro,,200.0,ltbx,"this is the reality that needs to be depicted, it might receive criticisms but this film captures the whole of the essence of being a woman"

Sunshine,2171,2,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,This line had me in tears
Sunshine,2171,3,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,One of the most heartwarming scenes for me in the film
Sunshine,2171,4,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,"It was like an understanding between Sunshiner and herself, and Sunshine and her unborn child na okay lang"
Sunshine,2171,5,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,Okay lang minsan sundin yung pangarap mo
Sunshine,2171,6,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, the scene between Jennica Garcia and Maris Racal near the end"
Sunshine,2171,7,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,Jennica saying na
Sunshine,2171,8,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,Andito lang si Ate
Sunshine,2171,9,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,This shows how a safe space and support should always start at home
Sunshine,2171,10,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,":(The film clearly depicts how it is so hard for women, especially in a country where everything does not support the women's rights, to be acknowledged"
Sunshine,2171,11,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,How women needed to work extra hard
Sunshine,2171,12,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,Be perfect
Sunshine,2171,13,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,Bawal magkamali
Sunshine,2171,14,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,Bawal mahina
Sunshine,2171,15,paaattx,,160.0,ltbx,At laging nag-aadjust sa society na mga lalaki ang pinapaburan

Sunshine,2172,3,shuabedumb,,200.0,ltbx,"I really loved the scenes that made you feel the weight of each decision she had to do, it makes you breathe and immerses you inside the world"
Sunshine,2172,4,shuabedumb,,200.0,ltbx,Minsan napapatanong rin ako kung ano gagawin ko sa ganyan situation kahit wala akong ano
Sunshine,2172,5,shuabedumb,,200.0,ltbx,It's definitely brave and a step up for filipino cinema knowing that these kind of topics are still taboo in this country
Sunshine,2172,6,shuabedumb,,200.0,ltbx,Pamilyar ako sa mga pinuntahan nya kung kaya't…

Sunshine,2176,2,mgnvlfrs,,200.0,ltbx,"Very emotional and honest watch, an eye opener to subjects that aren’t given much light"
Sunshine,2176,3,mgnvlfrs,,200.0,ltbx,I hate how there is the depiction that ‘dreams have to end when motherhood starts’ ABSOLUTELY NO
Sunshine,2176,4,mgnvlfrs,,200.0,ltbx,What tore me apart is that this is real and could/ probably be happening today
Sunshine,2176,5,mgnvlfrs,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine’s spiral when it came to dealing with the world was…
Sunshine,2177,1,clarementines,,200.0,ltbx,"5 stars k saken edit: after days, i still think about this film"
Sunshine,2177,2,clarementines,,200.0,ltbx,i will probably think about this film for life

Sunshine,2177,8,clarementines,,200.0,ltbx,and we will yearn for
Sunshine,2177,9,clarementines,,200.0,ltbx,thank you for making this film
Sunshine,2178,1,iyanvalenzuela,,180.0,ltbx,"Madaming bawal sa mundo, pero mas madaming bawal sa Pilipinas basta’t babae ka"
Sunshine,2179,1,cherisberries,,180.0,ltbx,"The story didn't go the direction I thought it would, and I’m glad it didn’t"
Sunshine,2179,2,cherisberries,,180.0,ltbx,"An intersectional approach to abortion is exactly the film this country needs, depicting internal and external conflict is a realistic but still emotionally charged way"
Sunshine,2179,3,cherisberries,,180.0,ltbx,My only gripe with this film is that I’m not a fan of how this film looks and sounds — a sentiment I share across the current Filipino cinematic landscape
Sunshine,2179,4,cherisberries,,180.0,ltbx,"This film is a landmark, which is exactly why I hoped it would give more in terms of cinematography and music"
Sunshine,2179,5,cherisberries,,180.0,ltbx,"But nitpicking aside, this film is perfect as it is"
Sunshine,2180,1,greenlightgoer,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi ako si sunshine at wala rin akong matres

Sunshine,2180,5,greenlightgoer,,200.0,ltbx,"All things said, this film is undoubtedly one of the important Filipino films of the decade"
Sunshine,2180,6,greenlightgoer,,200.0,ltbx,It encapsulates the growing debate on whether a woman should have the right to HER OWN body
Sunshine,2180,7,greenlightgoer,,200.0,ltbx,More Filipino films should be bolder like this
Sunshine,2180,8,greenlightgoer,,200.0,ltbx,"At para sa mga sunshine, laban lang"

Sunshine,2181,1,sisyd,,200.0,ltbx,That is the kind of mix of realism and surrealism that I want to achieve
Sunshine,2181,2,sisyd,,200.0,ltbx,"Nakaka-inspire sakin ito bilang manlilikha because it's not pretentious and it shouldn't be pero napaka lakas ng mensahe, isa yan sa mga gusto kong mamaster bilang manunulat"
Sunshine,2181,3,sisyd,,200.0,ltbx,"Pacing, composition and all gave me hope with my obscure ideas na kakayanin ko din maging direktor"
Sunshine,2181,4,sisyd,,200.0,ltbx,Ang husay ni Maris Racal dito heck I think lahat ng aktor dito gave it their all lalong lalo na yung mga child actors
Sunshine,2181,5,sisyd,,200.0,ltbx,"And even if this film with the themes that it tackles, I think this is the first time in a LONG while na napatawa ako ng malakas sa movie theater"
Sunshine,2181,7,sisyd,,200.0,ltbx,"What can I say, its just that good"
Sunshine,2182,1,justley,,,ltbx,hell yeah
Sunshine,2183,1,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine doesn’t waste time
Sunshine,2183,2,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"Within ten minutes, we already know what the titular character wants: she doesn’t want this pregnancy"
Sunshine,2183,3,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,What follows isn’t a mystery or a coming-of-age arc- it’s a fight
Sunshine,2183,4,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,We meet Sunshine as she trains for the Olympic gymnastics qualifiers
Sunshine,2183,5,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"She’s 19- focused, disciplined, and carrying a dream she’s had and has trained for since she was 10"
Sunshine,2183,6,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,Then she discovers she’s pregnant
Sunshine,2183,7,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"From that moment on, the film never strays from what Sunshine wants: will she be able to get an abortion"
Sunshine,2183,8,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"Sound design is a big part in every movie and in Sunshine, the sound feels like another character"
Sunshine,2183,9,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"Before her routines, her coach tells her to “drown out the noise"
Sunshine,2183,10,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,” But what if you can’t

Sunshine,2183,15,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"Sound, in this film, becomes symbolic of the constant interference she endures"
Sunshine,2183,16,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"The noise of judgment, of religion, of expectations- it’s relentless"
Sunshine,2183,17,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,That judgment bleeds into nearly every interaction she has
Sunshine,2183,18,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,The pharmacist gives unsolicited opinions when she buys a pregnancy test
Sunshine,2183,19,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,Her best friend’s mother condemned her
Sunshine,2183,20,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"In a country where over 90% of the population identifies as Christian and Catholicism dominates public life, the supposed separation of church and state is functionally meaningless"
Sunshine,2183,21,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,Religion makes the rules
Sunshine,2183,22,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"And when Sunshine is rushed to the hospital after complications from taking an abortion pill purchased from a street vendor, the doctor shames her in front of other patients, calling her actions “a sin in the eyes of the Lord"
Sunshine,2183,23,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,”Sunshine carries everything alone
Sunshine,2183,24,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"Her future, once so certain, is now uncertain"
Sunshine,2183,25,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"If she continues the pregnancy, the nine years she spent training will be for nothing"

Sunshine,2183,31,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,Their first encounter happens at the same place where Sunshine tries to buy an abortion pill
Sunshine,2183,32,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"The second time they meet, Mary Grace tells her she thought her bloated belly was just worms- a line so innocent it crushes you"
Sunshine,2183,33,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"In that moment, we are reminded: she’s a child"
Sunshine,2183,34,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"A victim of incestuous rape and we later learn she’s just 13, after she was taken to the hospital for complications when she attempted to get rid of her pregnancy"
Sunshine,2183,35,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"In a country where sex is taboo and sex education is frowned upon by religious leaders, what hope do girls like Mary Grace-or Sunshine-really have"
Sunshine,2183,36,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is outstanding
Sunshine,2183,37,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"Her physicality, her posture, her tension even in the quite moments makes her character feel very real"
Sunshine,2183,38,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,She carries the film with a maturity and vulnerability and it’s undeniably Racal’s best work to date
Sunshine,2183,39,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"At just 90 minutes, Sunshine is lean and direct"
Sunshine,2183,40,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,It doesn’t meander
Sunshine,2183,41,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,Just a young girl fighting again and again for her dreams
Sunshine,2183,42,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a masterful depiction of what it means to grow up in a country where women and girls lack the right to choose
Sunshine,2183,43,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,Where “I don’t want to be a mother” isn’t considered a valid reason
Sunshine,2183,44,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,The film drives this home in its final minutes: the guy responsible for Sunshine’s pregnancy shows up at her house with his pastor father
Sunshine,2183,45,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,They assure her they’ll support the baby “every step of the way” until the child turns 18
Sunshine,2183,46,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine listens, then finally says what she’s been saying all along: she doesn’t want to be a mother"
Sunshine,2183,47,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,We already know this
Sunshine,2183,48,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,We’ve known it since the first ten minutes
Sunshine,2183,49,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"But her ex and his father don't, or rather, can't understand it"
Sunshine,2183,50,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,“That’s not the point
Sunshine,2183,51,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"” she yells, and she’s right"
Sunshine,2183,52,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"The moment others found out she was pregnant, it stopped being about her, but about the baby"
Sunshine,2183,53,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"They had no regard for her dreams, for her aspirations, and how pregnancy will affect her well-being"
Sunshine,2183,54,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"It was never about if she'll be supported, it was about whether she's still ""allowed"" to have what she wants"
Sunshine,2183,55,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"And in a country that denies girls and women a choice, the cost is often their dreams, their futures, and sometimes, their lives"
Sunshine,2183,56,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is just one story, but it’s shared by thousands"
Sunshine,2183,57,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,"And unless the law changes, there will always be more Sunshines"
Sunshine,2183,58,xxai,,200.0,ltbx,Jadaone’s film dares to say that-loudly-even when the world tells her to drown out the noise
Sunshine,2184,1,ssunmoonsagi,,200.0,ltbx,can’t count kung gano karami ang pigil iyak ko sa movie na to tangina sobrang laking sampal sa pinas talaga na bakit pa rin ilegal ang abortion when yung character ni rhed bustamante is nabuntis as early as 13
Sunshine,2184,2,ssunmoonsagi,,200.0,ltbx,"all of the decisions that sunshine did was valid talaga like you’re willing to take risk para lang sa pangarap mo, pangarap ng pamilya moi really really really love the sisters love tangina grabe yung character ni jennica garcia to the point na i was literally immersing myself into her GETS BA like u can’t compare a sister and a mother’s love talaga"
Sunshine,2184,3,ssunmoonsagi,,200.0,ltbx,"di lang talaga siya like super focused sa abortion yung topic but also it tackles about how fucked up yung pinas sa ganitong sitwasyon like for example, yung sa hospital na scene, GETS naman na u can’t risk ur license pero if u really care and value ur patients well being, atleast u could’ve done something"
Sunshine,2184,4,ssunmoonsagi,,200.0,ltbx,"also, kung paano nammeasure yung safety ng tao talaga is naguumpisa sa bahay like how dafuc u can’t be a proper mother to sustain your child’s needs tapos i-llet go mo lang siya sa ibang tao to get predated"
Sunshine,2184,5,ssunmoonsagi,,200.0,ltbx,it was so nice to experience sa cinema ng ganto like so fucking much

Sunshine,2185,1,h8ware,,140.0,ltbx,you really won't catch a break in manila
Sunshine,2186,1,tuesjays,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine does not go the way of those brutish Brillante Mendoza social commentary flicks where the end goal is to suffer, and suffer, and suffer"
Sunshine,2186,2,tuesjays,,160.0,ltbx,instead it opts to project its demons as an internal problem
Sunshine,2186,3,tuesjays,,160.0,ltbx,"That, which works quite splendidly if not for the fact that this is a film supported by a very tepid and uncharacteristic score from Maris Racal's own ex-partner"
Sunshine,2186,4,tuesjays,,160.0,ltbx,"That being said, the best things about Sunshine actually emanate from its night sequences"
Sunshine,2186,5,tuesjays,,160.0,ltbx,"It captures wholly the distress, illegality, and dismay of everything to do with abortion, the black market, and whatever Sunshine's problems are adjacent to in reality"
Sunshine,2186,6,tuesjays,,160.0,ltbx,Those night scenes seemed straight out of Abbas Kiarostami’s Like Someone in Love
Sunshine,2186,7,tuesjays,,160.0,ltbx,"It's actually so apparent by the film's end that everything that does come out of this leads to the most reasonable one: a film that doesn't explicitly preach what to do, save for what its problem is tied to in context"
Sunshine,2186,8,tuesjays,,160.0,ltbx,"But yeah, that score really does this thing a disservice"
Sunshine,2186,9,tuesjays,,160.0,ltbx,Tom Cruise was right
Sunshine,2186,10,tuesjays,,160.0,ltbx,"Anyway, WHAT IS MY HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL DOING IN THIS MOVIE"

Sunshine,2191,4,budjiebar,,160.0,ltbx,Ang usapin na ito ay hindi “bastos” at “nakakahiya”
Sunshine,2191,5,budjiebar,,160.0,ltbx,Ito ay usapin ng karapatan at pagtatanggol sa karapatan ng mga babae
Sunshine,2191,6,budjiebar,,160.0,ltbx,Ang pagiging kaisa sa abortion ay hindi ibigsabihing hinahatak natin ang mga kabataan sa mga gawaing imoral
Sunshine,2191,7,budjiebar,,160.0,ltbx,"It is about having choices especially sa mga kababaihanh biktima ng karahasan, kahirapan, at pagsasamtala sa kamusmusan"

Sunshine,2191,14,budjiebar,,160.0,ltbx,"At kung hindi ko sila tutulungan na magkaroon ng boses, paano nila maririnig ang isa’t isa"
Sunshine,2191,15,budjiebar,,160.0,ltbx,"Sana ay magkaroon tayo ng kamulatan tungkol rito, hindi batay sa takot o pananakot, kundi batay sa science, kontexto, at malasakit"

Sunshine,2218,6,daryamazing,,180.0,ltbx,Mahigpit na yakap para sa mga kababaihan na kagaya ni Sunshine
Sunshine,2219,1,rawnzzn,,180.0,ltbx,I’ve been anticipating this film ever since Direk Tonet and Maris posted the poster on Instagram
Sunshine,2219,2,rawnzzn,,180.0,ltbx,"I just knew this tandem would deliver something special, and they absolutely did, it truly is something"
Sunshine,2219,3,rawnzzn,,180.0,ltbx,"Maris did a great performance, and this film truly deserves everyone’s attention"
Sunshine,2219,4,rawnzzn,,180.0,ltbx,Well-deserved ang Crystal Bear
Sunshine,2219,5,rawnzzn,,180.0,ltbx,"But to be honest, I was a bit hesitant lang sa character ni Annika at first, don’t get me wrong, she’s good, but hindi ko alam during the film if necessary ba sya"
Sunshine,2219,6,rawnzzn,,180.0,ltbx,"and I feel like naging unrealistic yung palabas bigla but eventually natanggap ko din naman and yes, “gets na gets"
Sunshine,2219,7,rawnzzn,,180.0,ltbx,"”I’ve been a supporter of Maris ever since her PBB days and I know that many, including myself, won’t forget her issue, but I hope this film and her talent alone will open more doors for her in the film industry"
Sunshine,2219,8,rawnzzn,,180.0,ltbx,"Sana hindi na siya i-box sa mga loveteam roles, because this performance proves she can “SHINE” on her own"
Sunshine,2219,9,rawnzzn,,180.0,ltbx,"""Ang singing sunshine ng davao to Sunshine talaga"

Sunshine,2223,2,biaaaancake,,200.0,ltbx,"baka kasi yung iba, i-take this as a movie contradicting the preachings of the church when in fact, gusto lang sabihin ng movie na women deserve to have a CHOICE"
Sunshine,2223,3,biaaaancake,,200.0,ltbx,"and when they choose to let go of the baby, they SHOULD have a safe way of doing so"
Sunshine,2223,4,biaaaancake,,200.0,ltbx,"juskopoh, gising na awa nalang sa pilipinas kung di nyo pa rin to getsi hope i get to live in a timeline wherein marerealize din ng mga close-minded na tao na being pregnant is not a ""blessing"" all the time"
Sunshine,2223,5,biaaaancake,,200.0,ltbx,"at hindi lahat ng nabubuntis ay sasabihan ng ""pabaya"" or ""pabigay"""

Sunshine,2226,13,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,it was ALL amazing
Sunshine,2226,14,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,the movie was able to capture that women have it rough
Sunshine,2226,15,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,this country places high expectations on women as they also bear the burden of others choices
Sunshine,2226,16,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,women have the right to say and do with their body
Sunshine,2226,17,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,"their body, their choice"
Sunshine,2226,18,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,"honestly, my heart aches for stories like sunshine because this isnt just fiction"
Sunshine,2226,19,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,this ACTUALLY happens in real life
Sunshine,2226,20,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,this movie is a wake call to prioritize womens rights and needs
Sunshine,2226,21,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,no woman or child deserves to go through this
Sunshine,2226,22,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,i know abortion is illegal here but the system failed them :(( all the stigma and shame that surrounds these topics shouldnt be kept away because others should be aware and educated as well
Sunshine,2226,23,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,"hindi siya madali dali lang or ""you know what to do, take care of it"
Sunshine,2226,24,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,""" there is a whole process and its so mind boggling and scary to even think about it"
Sunshine,2226,25,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,"there were so many scenes that made me tear up - maybe out of stress, sadness, or happiness"
Sunshine,2226,26,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,"but yes, any of those emotions allowed me to see sunshines perspective and how the movie played it out"
Sunshine,2226,27,jewnz,,180.0,ltbx,i was so genuinely happy for her at the end :( may every girl deserve to reach their dreams

Sunshine,2227,3,toshifilm,,180.0,ltbx,"jokes aside, there really should be a conversation about women's health that doesn't have anyone complaining that it would be ""sacrilegious"""
Sunshine,2228,1,ninzaturtlez,,,ltbx,malayo layo pa pero patuloy na mangangarap at titindig para sa karapatan ng mga kababaihan

Sunshine,2230,1,rezonin,,200.0,ltbx,"""Gets ko na"
Sunshine,2231,1,itsktlynn,,200.0,ltbx,raw and accurate depiction of teenage pregnancy ;((( the sad reality of this situation in the philippines
Sunshine,2231,2,itsktlynn,,200.0,ltbx,i will stand by how it should be more accessible
Sunshine,2231,3,itsktlynn,,200.0,ltbx,"pls, we need to desperately learn to become more compassionate and kind to those who face this"
Sunshine,2232,1,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,"direk tonet, i am (and will forever be) in awe of you"
Sunshine,2232,2,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,"i have always been hooked on to this film even before its philippine premiere, due to its striking plot and of course the leading star attached to it, maris racal"
Sunshine,2232,3,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,"watching this film on the big screen, i felt so uneasy knowing that this is pretty much a reality for filipino women and women overall"
Sunshine,2232,4,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,"sunshine is more than just a story of a girl tortured by the thoughts of bearing a child at such a young age; it is a grounded story surrounded by problems caused by societal pressure towards women and questionable christian morals and beliefs, which also opens up the current state of the country in terms of healthcare and its views on abortion"
Sunshine,2232,5,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,"art has always been meant to provoke, and direk tonet did it so gracefully—like how sunshine performed her routines, but still so raw with scenes depicting medically unsafe abortions during the second half"
Sunshine,2232,6,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,the cinematography was very pleasing for the eyes
Sunshine,2232,7,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,"most of the shots used were very effective in laying out the emotional impact of this film, most especially its exterior and tight shots with sunshine being the subject"
Sunshine,2232,8,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,another directorial choice that caught my attention was its symbolism
Sunshine,2232,9,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,"notably, the use of bata and ariana as figments of sunshine's imaginations"
Sunshine,2232,10,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,"despite those major choices, i personally liked the subtle and unnoticeable details more because i truly believe that it was those that helped keep the film coherent with its vision"
Sunshine,2232,11,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,details like added sound bites from the television and radio or the production design of sunshine's house
Sunshine,2232,12,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,"overall, i love it"
Sunshine,2232,13,evrybdyluvspie,,180.0,ltbx,yun lang HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Sunshine,2233,1,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,"watching this movie took me back and reminded me that pagbabae ka, magisa ka lang"
Sunshine,2233,2,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,they were able to encapsulate that with sunshine navigating everything on her own
Sunshine,2233,3,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,having to hide because there is no other choice
Sunshine,2233,4,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,"the moment she tells anyone, she wont get help, it means surrendering her dreams even if she doesnt want to"
Sunshine,2233,5,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,"to have a movie discuss the sensitive topics of this country such as abortion, child pregnancy, premarital pregnancy, and the negative side of religion is so brave"
Sunshine,2233,6,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,to be able to show it in a story so compelling and very filipino is so important imo
Sunshine,2233,7,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,"sobrang ganda ng cinematography, using manila’s lights and noise while also highlighting the darkness within its shadows"
Sunshine,2233,8,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,everyone’s performance in this film adds so much to the already great backdrop and dialogues
Sunshine,2233,9,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,"there was so many scenes that went so hard, too"
Sunshine,2233,10,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,"when sunshine was on the jeep, when she was alone in that motel, when she performed, even when she was just walking"
Sunshine,2233,11,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,every scene felt so important because maris embodied and delivered sunshine so well
Sunshine,2233,12,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,"ramdam ko yung galit, yung desperasyon, yung sikip sa dibdib ng walang magawa"
Sunshine,2233,13,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,"especially when she woke up in the hospital, the doctora started making her ask god for forgiveness"
Sunshine,2233,14,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,my blood boiled and i may have cried angry tears ngl
Sunshine,2233,15,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,"we are so used to religious guilt tripping in this country, its not even helping anyone"
Sunshine,2233,16,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,"anyway, Sunshine deserves her flowers"
Sunshine,2233,17,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,Gets na gets ko siya
Sunshine,2233,18,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,she’s the reflection of the filipina of our time
Sunshine,2233,19,kajurice,,200.0,ltbx,"Full of hopes and dreams, yet pulled down by the country that does not care about the health and safety of its people"
Sunshine,2234,1,lalaleili,,200.0,ltbx,favorite part is maris cursing
Sunshine,2235,1,sspantaleon,,140.0,ltbx,very clear messaging with no scene being wasted
Sunshine,2236,1,worldyouroyster,,200.0,ltbx,"SUNSHINE, MAGIGING OLYMPIAN KA BY GOD’S GRACE"
Sunshine,2236,2,worldyouroyster,,200.0,ltbx,THANK YOU PAPA GOD
Sunshine,2237,1,triiixxiiie,,200.0,ltbx,“Gets ko na
Sunshine,2239,1,erimae,,,ltbx,lesson learned: putangina
Sunshine,2240,1,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"“kahit anong mangyari, kakampi kita"
Sunshine,2240,2,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"”first of all, this movie is so refreshing"
Sunshine,2240,3,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"it shows the struggles of our main character, sunshine, and goes into depth how unwanted pregnancy can lead to mental and physical problems, the desperation of having limited options and resources, the shame encoded into our heads at birth by religious and societal expectations, and most importantly, it shows the resilience women are forced to do just to simply survive"
Sunshine,2240,4,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"second of all—i love, love, LOVE how this story is not your typical filipino pro-life propaganda warning"
Sunshine,2240,5,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"it’s honestly so upsetting how conservative and unprogressive our county is with abortion, but hopefully with this movie, older generations can sympathize with not just sunshine, but also mary grace’s situation"
Sunshine,2240,6,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"i’m actually so glad sunshine doesn’t force its main character to attach herself to the stigma of “abortion is murder” mindset; but rather, being able to be firm and push through with her decision—knowing that she’s not ready to be a mother—and doing what’s right for her (and the baby), without the influence of her boyfriend’s opinion, as well as the boyfriend’s father who offered to take care of financial expenses, which is quite rare"
Sunshine,2240,7,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,another beautiful moment in this movie that i personally love is the sisterhood between sunshine and geleen
Sunshine,2240,8,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,geleen’s understanding nature is powerful in itself—that having one person who will love you and guide you despite everything you’re facing can make your way in life a little easier
Sunshine,2240,9,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"knowing that you have someone to lean on in times like this is so fortunate, cause not many filipinas can have that kind of support system"
Sunshine,2240,10,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,and dr
Sunshine,2240,11,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,helena’s help
Sunshine,2240,12,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"as someone pursuing medicine, i understand the male doctor’s perspective on how he doesn’t want to loose his license, but with just dr"
Sunshine,2240,13,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"helena stepping in discreetly, she is incredibly brave"
Sunshine,2240,14,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"she’s risking her entire life on the line for someone she doesn’t even know, and for me, that’s such a great example of camaraderie between women"
Sunshine,2240,15,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,although the first doctor that “helped” sunshine was unnecessarily rude
Sunshine,2240,16,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,i’m glad geleen stepped in and defended her sister
Sunshine,2240,17,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"as a doctor, don’t you have to leave religious talk outside work"
Sunshine,2240,18,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,what an asshole
Sunshine,2240,19,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"overall, i’m so glad that philippine cinema is slowly stepping out of its comfort zone to talk about sensitive topics like these despite half (or even the majority) of the country being against abortion"
Sunshine,2240,20,lovetina,,180.0,ltbx,"i hope this movie spreads like wildfire—a wake-up call to break free from patriarchal laws, and the belief that women’s bodies and choices are truly their own"
Sunshine,2241,1,mikarae,,200.0,ltbx,simple premise told in a very raw and creative way
Sunshine,2242,2,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,This is the movie I will recommend to international friends if they want to know the Philippines
Sunshine,2242,3,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,"The characters, the culture, the psyche, how far and behind we are in women's rights and sex education is rolled into this beautiful, heart wrenching movie"
Sunshine,2242,4,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,We may venerate a baby (Sto
Sunshine,2242,5,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,"Nino) and the virgin (Mary), but the way women and children are treated is ironically (if not disgustingly) far apart from our devotion to the Catholic faith"
Sunshine,2242,6,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,And we are reminded of it from the set and location
Sunshine,2242,7,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,Even the jeepney's signage
Sunshine,2242,8,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,The writing is clever in its use of language
Sunshine,2242,9,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,"Its use of [insert -ism] was gently introduced and when you realized what it is, it hits hard"
Sunshine,2242,10,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,I can't describe it any other way how confidently gentle this was tackled
Sunshine,2242,11,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,It reminded me of 70's-80's era of Filipino films
Sunshine,2242,12,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,This is the highest praise in the canon of Philippine cinema
Sunshine,2242,13,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,I can't praise this enough
Sunshine,2242,14,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,"Watch it, if you have the time and money, in theaters"
Sunshine,2242,15,ravenph,,200.0,ltbx,It is very much worth it
Sunshine,2243,1,aallddss,,200.0,ltbx,ANG GANDA
Sunshine,2244,1,thegirltureedit,,180.0,ltbx,Matapang na pelikula
Sunshine,2245,1,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,been a few days since i watched the film as of writing this but i still can’t find the proper words to describe the experience of watching sunshine in the cinemas with all the people around me
Sunshine,2245,2,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,"first of all, it really is a different feeling to enjoy a movie in the cinema and see how other viewers will react to scenes as the film progresses"
Sunshine,2245,3,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,may dagdag factor talaga sya na napapaganda lalo yung film and mas nakaka-engross talaga sha for me grabe
Sunshine,2245,4,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,hands down lang talaga sa performance ni maris
Sunshine,2245,5,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,"her character wasn’t merely a persona shaped by the script or the vision of the writer, SHE IS SUNSHINE"
Sunshine,2245,7,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,"sobrang natural yung expressions, parang nandun talaga ako sa tabi nya for the entire journey to sea games (and in my head, pati sa olympics na pinapangarap nya ) and it’s mindblowing how i never really felt na movie yung pinapanood ko— everything felt so real because what’s portrayed is the reality"
Sunshine,2245,8,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,"sa totoong buhay, kahit na ang laki na ng pagbabagong naganap tungo sa pagkakaroon ng lugar ng babae sa lipunan, ang realidad ay marami pa rin ang ipinagkakait sa kanila"
Sunshine,2245,9,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,marami pa ring hakbang ang maaaring gawin at mga pagbabago na dapat isulong dahil hindi sapat na ang mga filipinong babae ay naikakahon sa imahe na hinubog ng daang-taong impluwensiya ng katolisismo sa naging kultura natin
Sunshine,2245,10,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,ANG MGA KABABAIHANG PINOY AY MATAPANG
Sunshine,2245,13,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,"AT HIGIT SA LAHAT, SILA AY PUNO NG PANGARAP"
Sunshine,2245,14,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,"nakakalungkot na hanggang sa kasalukuyan, ang mga desisyon na dapat sila ang gumagawa ay patuloy pa rin na hinahadlangan hindi lamang ng batas kundi pati ng kapwa-tao mismo"
Sunshine,2245,15,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,the symbolisms in the movie are subtle yet soooo impactful
Sunshine,2245,16,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,"the color choices sa outfit ni maris at annika, the choices of angles sa mga eksena na parang nanliliit sya o kaya ay triumphant, maging sa mga shot na sinusuntok ni sunshine yung tiyan nya— these details make the movie worth rewatching just to dig deeper into the creative choices sa movie"
Sunshine,2245,17,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,"hands down to direk tonet and everyone who shaped the film to become what it is today<33until now, hindi pa rin ako sigurado kung sapat ba yung mga naisulat ko para maipahayag kung ano ang tunay na naramdaman ko upon watching this movie"
Sunshine,2245,18,johndrebdg,,180.0,ltbx,"pero ang mahalaga, GETS KO NA"

Sunshine,2247,1,bmands,,180.0,ltbx,"There are films that entertain, and then there are films that hold up a mirror—brutal, honest, and impossible to look away from"
Sunshine,2247,2,bmands,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine did that to me
Sunshine,2247,3,bmands,,180.0,ltbx,It stripped me raw and left me in quiet reflection long after the screen went black
Sunshine,2247,4,bmands,,180.0,ltbx,"I saw in Sunshine’s story not just a character, but the collective ache of countless women who’ve had to choose between self-preservation and duty"
Sunshine,2247,5,bmands,,180.0,ltbx,The central challenge of Sunshine—a young gymnast discovering her pregnancy at the cusp of her Olympic dream—hit me in a visceral way
Sunshine,2247,6,bmands,,180.0,ltbx,"Not because I’ve ever been pregnant, or aspired to the Olympics, but because I know what it’s like to carry something heavy in silence, to want something for yourself while the world insists you exist for others"
Sunshine,2247,7,bmands,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine’s fear, defiance, and quiet longing mirrored the emotional territory I navigate daily: trying to live on my terms in a world that insists I don’t get to choose"
Sunshine,2247,8,bmands,,180.0,ltbx,My full review here: inthewakeofthings
Sunshine,2248,1,unidicked,,200.0,ltbx,nasaan si ari-yuh-nuh
Sunshine,2249,1,koyl,,120.0,ltbx,"What I like about Sunshine is this film fully embraced Antoinette Jadaone's artistry as a filmmaker, similar to her magnum opus ""Fan Girl"""
Sunshine,2249,2,koyl,,120.0,ltbx,The luscious colors and shades at the backdrop of a failing city
Sunshine,2249,3,koyl,,120.0,ltbx,The grounded surrealism
Sunshine,2249,4,koyl,,120.0,ltbx,And Jadaone's honesty in what she wanted to convey in the film
Sunshine,2249,5,koyl,,120.0,ltbx,"Much like her previous romance films Alone/Together and Never Not Love You, this film grappled with social and economic uncertainty but this time it highlighted Maris Racal's character's struggle to love her passion in gymnastics"
Sunshine,2249,6,koyl,,120.0,ltbx,"It's no surprise Racal acted the hell out of her role, but my flowers are for Jennica Garcia who encapsulated the ghost of Sunshine's what-could-have-been"
Sunshine,2249,7,koyl,,120.0,ltbx,"Sunshine further proves Jadaone is in her prime, and there's so much more she can make in the next years"

Sunshine,2251,5,arxshe,,200.0,ltbx,pinakamasakit na panoorin na part is yung sa 13-year old na bata na nagtry rin magpalaglag until the hospital scene

Sunshine,2254,1,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,marami akong nakikitang western reviews calling this so-so
Sunshine,2254,2,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,"if titingnan mo nga from their pov, oo nga"
Sunshine,2254,3,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,"ano bang bago dito, it's literally about a high school student getting an abortion to focus on her olympian gymnast dreams"
Sunshine,2254,4,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,but this is where context matters
Sunshine,2254,5,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,films like sunshine are so important as a conversation-starter in countries like the philippines where abortion and reproductive health is deemed not as important by a male-dominated government and a religious culture
Sunshine,2254,6,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,ang dami pa ring pro-life kaya sobrang hirap para sa mga kababaihan tulad ni sunshine at mary grace magkaroon ng access sa safe ways for abortion
Sunshine,2254,7,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,sobrang nakakadala makita sila na irisk ang buhay nila para magpatuloy pa mabuhay
Sunshine,2254,8,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,mahirap magbuntis pero di hamak na mas mahirap magpa-abort
Sunshine,2254,9,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,"at lalo itong pinapahirap ng isang patriyarkal na lipunan, katulad ng doktor na unang nilapitan ni sunshine para tulungan si mary grace"
Sunshine,2254,10,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,tumatak siya sakin kasi siya ang salamin ng mga kalalakihan sa ating legislation chambers na walang pakialam sa karapatan ng mga kababaihan at galit na galit sa mga plataporma na nagsusulong ng kanilang welfare
Sunshine,2254,11,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,isa pa yang si miggy at ang tatay niya
Sunshine,2254,12,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,mga barumbado
Sunshine,2254,13,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,"kaya oo, importante ang paggawa at pagpapalabas ng mga pelikula tulad ng sunshine"
Sunshine,2254,14,interheaven,,160.0,ltbx,nagulat nga ako pinondohan to ng fdcp

Sunshine,2255,1,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,Late diary entry
Sunshine,2255,2,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,It really is true that employment screws the cinephile in us
Sunshine,2255,3,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,"This is Jadaone's Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) mixed with the magical realism of Jojo Rabbit (2020), and Brocka's depiction of Maynila as a harsh, predatory city that traps and exploits the marginalized"
Sunshine,2255,4,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,"There's a night scene that was basically taken from a Brocka handbook, framing, camera movements, dialogue"
Sunshine,2255,5,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,"I love Jadaone's growth as a filmmaker and this project shows how she matured in multiple filmic aspects, but more so on the commendable screenplay"
Sunshine,2255,6,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,The conversations felt realistic– something a Gen-Z would say in the present context
Sunshine,2255,7,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,There's a clever and subtle critiquing done by adding the English-speaking scenes as well
Sunshine,2255,8,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,"As if they poke fun at the other contradictions in our postcolonial, patriarchal society now"
Sunshine,2255,9,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,"Multiple ironies and contradictions lie in this film—the titular character's name doesn't coincide with her lived experiences, the vendor selling the religious images of Nazareno and Sto Niño also sells the abortion pills, how the people who claim to care for us are so quick to judge if situations do not align with their perspective or morality"
Sunshine,2255,10,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine to me was a thought-provoking way of presenting a very evident issue in our Philippine society, and Jadaone made it brutally honest without lacking the compassion and clarity to bring about this story"
Sunshine,2255,11,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,I love how hopeful the ending was tbh
Sunshine,2255,12,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,I know that this country has been so steeped in religious conservatism that even acknowledging how hopeful that ending was would raise flak—but this movie has done a great deal to create awareness and productive discussions on unwanted pregnancies
Sunshine,2255,13,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine was a confrontation of our modern maladies, something that very clearly threatens the health and future of women"
Sunshine,2255,14,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,"That's another contradiction in itself, having a government by the people, for the people and yet it chooses to ignore the evident crises of its people"
Sunshine,2255,15,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,I digress
Sunshine,2255,16,vtcnscientist,,160.0,ltbx,"Gets kita, Shine"

Sunshine,2259,1,burritofever,,120.0,ltbx,"the setting is a supporting actor — it perfectly encapsulates the good, the bad and the ugly of quiapo and its people"
Sunshine,2260,1,junebulaon,,180.0,ltbx,Maris Racal it seems I’ve grown quite fond of you tho there are no urges or desires you come to me as a long lost friend whom I once picked apples with in papa’s orchard
Sunshine,2261,1,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,"throughout the film, the people surrounding sunshine kept telling her what to do with her pregnancy"
Sunshine,2261,2,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,abort it
Sunshine,2261,3,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,keep it
Sunshine,2261,4,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,do this and do that
Sunshine,2261,5,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,"we can have all these conversations about pro-life and pro-choice, of whether we agree with her actions or not and that’s fine and all"
Sunshine,2261,6,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,but that is not the point this film makes
Sunshine,2261,7,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,"regardless of what your thoughts on abortion are, this film forces you to meet sunshine where she’s at"
Sunshine,2261,8,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,"to feel her pain, her struggle, her desperation, her hopes and dreams"
Sunshine,2261,9,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,"this film tells you to look at her, understand her first"
Sunshine,2261,10,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,no one in this film except her sister and that kind doctor was able to do that
Sunshine,2261,11,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,the people surrounding her were coursing plans of action for the future without actually asking her how she’s doing
Sunshine,2261,12,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,it was painful to watch her go through challenge after challenge and yet no one really saw her
Sunshine,2261,13,maxicam,,200.0,ltbx,Kaya gets kita sunshine

Sunshine,2262,2,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,"I wish that I could see this film like the first time cause it hits different but still, it does not lose its essence and message"
Sunshine,2262,3,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,Loved hearing the collective gasps of people and their laughs during certain scenes
Sunshine,2262,4,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,"This is why I love going to the cinemas, sharing a collective experience"
Sunshine,2262,5,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,And definitely a deafening silence once the title card was shown
Sunshine,2262,6,satuwina,,200.0,ltbx,"That silence speaks volumes and that's when you know the film did what it supposed to do, to its audience"
Sunshine,2263,1,veronicaxally,,200.0,ltbx,"marami akong gustong sabihin pero 'di ko alam paano at saan uumpisahan, basta gets ko"
Sunshine,2264,1,alleak1m,,200.0,ltbx,ILY DIREK TONET
Sunshine,2265,1,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,My favorite part of the film is how Sunshine simply does not have any maternal figure in her life
Sunshine,2265,2,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,Her mother is literally nowhere
Sunshine,2265,3,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"Numerous characters try to act in this woman's place, but all fail in being the figure Sunshine needs"
Sunshine,2265,4,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,I believe this is why the coach remains a flat character for the entire duration of the plot
Sunshine,2265,5,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"Even if she refers to Sunshine as ""anak,"" we never get to see her be a mother to her"
Sunshine,2265,6,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"The coach is at the center of the conflict, the one person who must never know that she's pregnant"
Sunshine,2265,7,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"Thus, Sunshine refuses to open up to her coach, refusing to be cared for knowing the consequences"
Sunshine,2265,8,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"When her coach hears rumors of her pregnancy, there is no comfort in her words when she confronts Sunshine"
Sunshine,2265,9,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"Instead, all the secretly pregnant teenager receives is a reminder of what is at stake, that she won't get to be on the team"
Sunshine,2265,10,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,This pushes Sunshine to go back for a stronger round 2 of the pamparegla
Sunshine,2265,11,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,Not even Thea's mom can give comfort to the friend of her daughter
Sunshine,2265,12,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"She literally does the opposite, ordering Thea to stay away from Sunshine"
Sunshine,2265,13,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"Even when Sunshine asks the motelkeeper for help, and they reluctantly do so"
Sunshine,2265,14,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,The elder women place her on a tricycle and leave her to bleed out as the tricycle rushes to the hospital
Sunshine,2265,15,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,Then there's the doctor
Sunshine,2265,16,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine's sister perfectly criticizes her demeanor towards Sunshine
Sunshine,2265,17,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,Her sister asks the doctor if she's a relative of theirs or possibly their mother because she's acting like one
Sunshine,2265,18,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"Though this might seem like a counter, when you take into account how the doctor cares more about Sunshine apologizing to the Lord and thanking Him rather than Sunshine's well-being, the case falters"
Sunshine,2265,19,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"Also, her character felt more like a voice of how religion greatly affects the medical field and in turn, women's bodies"
Sunshine,2265,20,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"The same goes even for the case of Mary Grace, who has been impregnated by her own uncle"
Sunshine,2265,21,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"While her mother is alive, their relationship is complicated to say the least"
Sunshine,2265,22,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"Her mother enables the abusive relationship between the uncle and child for money, so that someone else can ""take care"" of Mary Grace, essentially removing herself from the role of being a mom"
Sunshine,2265,23,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,I think all this is why her sister is highlighted as a light in her life
Sunshine,2265,24,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"She is the closest thing to being a mother in Sunshine's life, caring about her health, whether she goes to school or not, and so on"
Sunshine,2265,25,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"However, they are sisters at heart"
Sunshine,2265,26,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,They can only hold each other's hands through life
Sunshine,2265,27,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,"Her sister does not order her what to do with the baby, instead defends her from the doctor, pays for the bill, and gets her home"
Sunshine,2265,28,everybobi,,200.0,ltbx,They are sisters through and through

Sunshine,2281,2,maybeiamceline,,200.0,ltbx,this film is real and made me reflect on how still the world treats women
Sunshine,2281,3,maybeiamceline,,200.0,ltbx,this film truly shows how it is so hard to be a woman in this country wherein you cannot decide about your own body and life because people will always have something to say about you
Sunshine,2281,4,maybeiamceline,,200.0,ltbx,"i hope it's an eye opener to everyone of us that if women wants an abortion, we shouldn't judge them right away, instead, we should take a pause and learn to understand that each and everyone of them has their own reason on why it ended that way"
Sunshine,2281,5,maybeiamceline,,200.0,ltbx,"to all the Sunshine out there, if there's a chance that you can choose yourself, please do so"
Sunshine,2282,1,paglarawan,,,ltbx,there is something so enigmatic about the second night sequence of sunshine
Sunshine,2282,2,paglarawan,,,ltbx,"not only is this the deciding night for her, but it’s also the night where everything comes together: a night to finally reclaim her agency, an answer to her worry, and the contradictions in between spaces—the institutions that reinstate the cisheteropatriarchal system and the city that allows everything against all odds"

Sunshine,2288,2,carlcarreon,,200.0,ltbx,"And unfortunately, Sunshine, in essence, represents the face of this cruel fate — the very victim of society's refusal to address issues that are relevant yet alarming"
Sunshine,2288,3,carlcarreon,,200.0,ltbx,"And through the film's course, we see Quiapo as this undeniable haven of hypocrisy, a place of contradicting morals, the very product of poverty and its people trying to survive and make ends meet"
Sunshine,2288,4,carlcarreon,,200.0,ltbx,"Jadaone somehow manages to tap into the very surface of these stories rather creatively, without missing a beat and has a stark vision of what the film should be about"
Sunshine,2288,5,carlcarreon,,200.0,ltbx,At times I feel like the film is a literal outcry for help
Sunshine,2288,6,carlcarreon,,200.0,ltbx,Every character here is a representation of that and is the result of what's wrong with the system in general
Sunshine,2288,7,carlcarreon,,200.0,ltbx,This paired with Racal's impressive performance strengthens the film's core message
Sunshine,2288,8,carlcarreon,,200.0,ltbx,"Simply put, Jadaone's work is not a prententious flick that uses sensitive subject matter for mere views but rather an impactful affair that successfully champions itself as a vessel for awareness"
Sunshine,2288,9,carlcarreon,,200.0,ltbx,"Overall, the film is resonating with me, a powerful testament that the film transcends genders and in itself is a beautiful feat because it lets you see and viscerally feel Sunshine, and witness her journey to self-forgiveness and inner peace"

Sunshine,2294,1,athsxx,,200.0,ltbx,Salamat sa lahat ng Sunshine na hindi sumuko sa kanilang mga pangarap at hindi nagpalamon sa dinidikta ng lipunan
Sunshine,2294,2,athsxx,,200.0,ltbx,Isang mahigpit na yakap at pagtanggap
Sunshine,2294,3,athsxx,,200.0,ltbx,Gets namin kayo
Sunshine,2295,1,jrnwll,,120.0,ltbx,"While the cast delivered brave and committed performances, I personally found the overall story didn't hit me as hard as I hoped"
Sunshine,2295,2,jrnwll,,120.0,ltbx,"It’s not due to a lack of relevance, on the contrary, the film captured the complexities and ironies of abortion culture in the Philippines with striking accuracy"
Sunshine,2295,3,jrnwll,,120.0,ltbx,"I just wished the storytelling felt a bit tighter and more cohesive, so the impact matched the subject's weight given that it's a taboo subject in the PH context"
Sunshine,2296,1,deynnosaur,,200.0,ltbx,it's about time
Sunshine,2296,2,deynnosaur,,200.0,ltbx,to have this kind of movie in our cinemas
Sunshine,2296,3,deynnosaur,,200.0,ltbx,malayo pa ang tagumpay patungo sa panalo ng kababaihan pero sana unti-unting umuusad na

Sunshine,2298,1,lo_ori,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi ko talaga alam pano ko ilalatag lahat ng gusto kong sabihin tungkol sa pelikulang ‘to pero grabe SOBRANG GANDA kung pano ipinakita ang gulo at ingay ng maynila ay ganon din nila naipakita kung gaano kahirap maging isang babae – totoo, masakit, walang filter, hindi ka pwedeng magsabi na “pwedeng time out muna"
Sunshine,2298,2,lo_ori,,200.0,ltbx,” ito yung hard pill to swallow na hindi lubos maintindihan ng madla
Sunshine,2298,3,lo_ori,,200.0,ltbx,bakit ba kapag ganitong mga sitwasyon laging babae ang nalalagay sa alanganin
Sunshine,2298,4,lo_ori,,200.0,ltbx,"mahal kita, sunshine"
Sunshine,2298,5,lo_ori,,200.0,ltbx,"gusto kitang yakapin kasi gets na gets kita :’( at the end of the day, gusto lang naman ng bawat babae mapakinggan, masuportahan, at mabigyan ng choice na piliin ang sarili nila"
Sunshine,2298,6,lo_ori,,200.0,ltbx,kaya sobrang importante matalakay ang isyu ng aborsyon lalong lalo na sa catholic country kagaya ng pinas
Sunshine,2298,7,lo_ori,,200.0,ltbx,‘wag nyo nang ipagkait saming kababaihan ang pagpili sa kung anong alam at gusto namin
Sunshine,2298,8,lo_ori,,200.0,ltbx,salamat direk tonet sa paggawa sa pelikulang ‘to at sa lagi’t laging paglathala sa kwento ng kababaihan sa sining mo

Sunshine,2299,1,purpleyess,,200.0,ltbx,"'di ko namalayan na nag-ala sunshine na rin ako sa scene nya sa jeep nung pauwi na kami, after manood"
Sunshine,2299,2,purpleyess,,200.0,ltbx,"'di ko pa rin macontain yung emotion pagkatapos,, parang doon palang din nagsink in"
Sunshine,2299,3,purpleyess,,200.0,ltbx,"gusto kong yakapin nang mahigpit ang lahat ng sunshine and mary grace sa mundo :""))special to heart kasi sa muli kong panonood sa sinehan, sunshine ang pinanood ko"
Sunshine,2299,4,purpleyess,,200.0,ltbx,**will edit this review kapag fully nakapag-pagpag na ako
Sunshine,2300,2,lezty4,,200.0,ltbx,Ang palabas na may nilalamang iba't ibang karanasan patungkol sa usapin na pinalitaw sa kwento— aborsyon
Sunshine,2300,3,lezty4,,200.0,ltbx,"Marahil hindi ito laging napag-uusapan, dahil bakit"
Sunshine,2300,4,lezty4,,200.0,ltbx,"Kasi nakakulong sa isipang mali ang magpalaglag, mali dahil pumapatay ng inosenteng sanggol sa sinapupunan"
Sunshine,2300,5,lezty4,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi naiisip ang sitwasyon ng ina, at ng magiging anak kung sakali mang ipanganak"
Sunshine,2300,6,lezty4,,200.0,ltbx,"Sinasawalang kakayahan na magdesisyon ang bawat babae para sakanilang katawan, kung ano ang gusto nila, kung ano ang satinging tama"
Sunshine,2300,7,lezty4,,200.0,ltbx,Ipinakita rito na hindi madali ang desisyon
Sunshine,2300,8,lezty4,,200.0,ltbx,Ipinakita rin dito ang mga matitibay na rason para hindi ituloy ang panganganak— pangarap
Sunshine,2300,9,lezty4,,200.0,ltbx,"Sana lahat ay ma-gets ang desisyon ni Sunshine, katulad ng pag-intindi ng bata sakanya"
Sunshine,2300,10,lezty4,,200.0,ltbx,"""Gets ko na"
Sunshine,2301,1,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"The entire time I was watching, I felt like I couldn't breathe"
Sunshine,2301,2,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"It's claustrophobic and suffocating, just like how Sunshine herself feels"
Sunshine,2301,3,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"You feel her world slowly closing in on her, invisible walls tightening around her in every frame"
Sunshine,2301,4,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"The camera doesn't let you breathe, and neither does the sound"
Sunshine,2301,5,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"Manila's noise is constant, overwhelming, and disorienting, especially for a gymnast who needs focus and silence to thrive"
Sunshine,2301,6,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is literally and figuratively trapped in tight spaces, cramped jeepneys, crowded streets, the overbearing sound of trains passing by, judgmental stares, and high expectations"
Sunshine,2301,7,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"Visually and sonically, it captures how isolating and terrifying it is to carry a burden like hers in a society that is less than kind toward women"
Sunshine,2301,8,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"(Btw, just to put it out there, the cinematography and colors in this film are GORGEOUS"
Sunshine,2301,9,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,") In almost every film that tackles women's issues in the Philippines, you'll find this line repeated in many reviews here in Letterboxd: ""Ang hirap maging babae"
Sunshine,2301,10,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,At lalong mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas
Sunshine,2301,11,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,""" It's because it's true"
Sunshine,2301,12,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"Every day, women here continue to fight for autonomy, for safety, for the right to choose themselves"
Sunshine,2301,13,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"We live in a deeply patriarchal and religious society that expects women to always put others first—especially family, be it their parents, siblings, or children—and shames them whenever something bad happens to them as if they brought it upon themselves"
Sunshine,2301,14,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"Society never asks the men who take advantage of women simply existing to change, rather it expects women to quietly endure"
Sunshine,2301,15,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,Bakit kailangang babae ang palaging mag-adjust
Sunshine,2301,16,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"I appreciated how the film showed moments of solidarity between women, but it's sad how that's not always the case in real life"
Sunshine,2301,17,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"Exceptional performances from the entire cast, especially Maris Racal, who is tremendous in the titular role"
Sunshine,2301,18,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"From the start, she's completely convincing as an elite athlete and future Olympian: disciplined, focused, and has no room for error, as both her dreams and the dreams of others rest heavily on her shoulders"
Sunshine,2301,19,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"But it's in moments where Sunshine wrestles with fear, guilt, and inner conflict that Maris truly shines"
Sunshine,2301,20,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,She captures and presents the character's vulnerability so well
Sunshine,2301,21,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"Also, as someone who always adored Jennica Garcia since her GMA days, I absolutely loved watching her quiet and subtle acting as Sunshine's sister"
Sunshine,2301,22,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"I said in my first review of Fan Girl that I hoped Direk Tonet would make an even braver film, and she did"
Sunshine,2301,23,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine focuses and dives deep into the themes it introduces and stands firm in its critique—something that I felt was somehow lacking in Fan Girl
Sunshine,2301,24,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"While some moments didn't always work for me and the magical realism elements sometimes took me out, I understand the choice"
Sunshine,2301,25,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"Part of me wishes it stayed more grounded and direct, but the “Gets ko na” scene near the end hit so hard that I stopped minding altogether"
Sunshine,2301,26,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,"It's a great, important film and I hope it helps open up more discourse on women's reproductive rights in the country"
Sunshine,2301,27,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,Go see it in cinemas when you can
Sunshine,2301,28,jahdfaune,,160.0,ltbx,SM City North EDSA Cinema 6

Sunshine,2302,2,artsycola,,200.0,ltbx,"Mabigat ang pelikula, sensitibo, ngunit matapang at maingat nitong ipinakita ang iba’t-ibang reyalidad sa Pilipinas; it talked about important topics that are often regarded as taboo: teenage pregancy, broken healthcare system, domestic sexual harrassment, religious conservatism, and body autonomy"
Sunshine,2302,3,artsycola,,200.0,ltbx,"More than anything, pinaalala sakin nito na hindi pwedeng diktahan ng sinuman, mas lalo na ng kalalakihan, ang katawan ng babae"

Sunshine,2305,1,shaniqua_99,,200.0,ltbx,The cinematography is on top
Sunshine,2305,2,shaniqua_99,,200.0,ltbx,And also the camera angles
Sunshine,2305,3,shaniqua_99,,200.0,ltbx,"The motel scene gives me goosebumps, the struggles and danger that a woman could experience is too much to bear"
Sunshine,2305,4,shaniqua_99,,200.0,ltbx,To think that we are now in a very modern world this topic is still a taboo in our country
Sunshine,2305,5,shaniqua_99,,200.0,ltbx,This film showed me the realistic perspective of abortion through the lens of a young woman fighting for her dreams
Sunshine,2305,6,shaniqua_99,,200.0,ltbx,No woman should be forced to give birth and have child especially when they are not capable to sustain emotionally/financially and abused by someone
Sunshine,2305,7,shaniqua_99,,200.0,ltbx,"I am too stunned to speak after I finished it, I am just so happy that we can actually create this kind of film raw, and brave"
Sunshine,2306,1,j_seabirds,,160.0,ltbx,"what i love most about this movie is how it tackles different issues in this country, from teenage pregnancy and beyond, in a way that gradually builds and is tied together beautifully"
Sunshine,2306,2,j_seabirds,,160.0,ltbx,"this movie doesn’t aim to solve the problems, but it does broaden people’s perspectives on the real issues and real experiences of women in the philippines (even other filipinas themselves who aren’t aware of the details that go into teenage pregnancy"

Sunshine,2313,1,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,"After making waves at the Toronto Film Festival last year and winning a Crystal Bear at the Berlin Film Festival early this year, #SunshineMovie finally comes home to the Philippines"
Sunshine,2313,2,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,"Starring Maris Racal in a powerful lead performance, the film follows Sunshine Francisco, a decorated gymnast whose Olympic dreams are threatened when she unexpectedly becomes pregnant"
Sunshine,2313,3,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,She must choose between her ambitions and the responsibilities suddenly placed on her — all while navigating a society that dictates what women should and shouldn’t do with their bodies
Sunshine,2313,4,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,"Directed by Antoinette Jadaone, the film doesn’t shy away from the hard questions — ones that should be answered by the Church, the government, the educational system, and most crucially, parents"
Sunshine,2313,5,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,Why is premarital sex and reproductive health still taboo in 2025
Sunshine,2313,6,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,Why does society police women’s choices about their bodies
Sunshine,2313,7,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,Why can’t we provide options for victims of abuse
Sunshine,2313,8,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,These questions linger long after the credits roll
Sunshine,2313,9,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal gives a career-defining performance — fragile yet defiant — as a young woman trying to stay strong while breaking under immense pressure
Sunshine,2313,10,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,"Aside from her acting, her gymnastics scenes are highly commendable, a testament to her dedication to the role"
Sunshine,2313,11,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,"Jennica Garcia gives a quietly affecting turn as her older sister, shining in key emotional scenes"
Sunshine,2313,12,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,"Child actor Annika Co, making her debut, is a revelation — a true scene-stealer with star potential"
Sunshine,2313,13,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,Former child star Rhed Bustamante will touch your heart & churn your stomach
Sunshine,2313,14,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,Piolo Pascual also appears in a poignant special role
Sunshine,2313,15,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,"Manila, chaotic and contradictory, plays more than just a backdrop — it becomes an extension of Sunshine’s journey"
Sunshine,2313,16,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,"From historic churches to narrow alleyways, she searches for clarity, strength, and hope, beautifully captured & lighted by ace cinematographer Pao Orendain"
Sunshine,2313,17,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is bold, relevant, and deeply moving"
Sunshine,2313,18,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s a call to conversation, to empathy, and to change"
Sunshine,2313,19,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,Super highly recommended
Sunshine,2313,20,tosshhhiiii,,200.0,ltbx,Now showing exclusively at SM Cinemas nationwide — don’t miss it
Sunshine,2314,1,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,"This movie is so satisfying to watch because it empathizes with its main character, sunshine, a young gymnast training for the olympics who happened to have an unwanted pregnancy"
Sunshine,2314,2,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,"Young women like her are figures often shunned in popular philippine media and well, society so it’s refreshing to see someone like her in a sympathetic light"
Sunshine,2314,3,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,Abortion is such a taboo topic in this country so i very much appreciate the relentless uncovering of the different failures of the government and society with regards to women’s reproductive health and rights
Sunshine,2314,4,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,Props to Maris for fearlessly embodying the role
Sunshine,2314,5,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,Abortion is healthcare
Sunshine,2314,6,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,It should be a choice accessible to anyone that wants it
Sunshine,2314,7,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,It doesn’t have to be earned which is why I do find the imaginary kid representing sunshine’s conscience or the possible “kid” she might bear in the future unnecessary and redundant in the face of all the other oppressive opinions surrounding her
Sunshine,2314,8,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,"If the goal was to voice her inner worries, it wasn’t needed, it was already felt and would’ve been better shown some other way"
Sunshine,2314,9,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,"If the goal was to voice the external conservative audience’s thoughts, then it wasn’t needed as well because they’re already thinking it, the film should’ve been secure with putting its faith on Sunshine alone"
Sunshine,2314,10,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,She’s a woman and she has dreams and having a baby is not part of that
Sunshine,2314,11,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,She has value still for just the fact of being a person
Sunshine,2314,12,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,I guess it just rubbed me the wrong way
Sunshine,2314,13,roguism,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s a very beautiful film nonetheless, shining best in its moments of truth and courage"
Sunshine,2315,1,yk4ia,,200.0,ltbx,we need more films likes ds
Sunshine,2316,1,ohmamarge,,200.0,ltbx,I couldn’t stop crying at the end of the movie
Sunshine,2316,2,ohmamarge,,200.0,ltbx,It made me feel so many things
Sunshine,2316,3,ohmamarge,,200.0,ltbx,"I laughed, I cried, but most of all, I got angry"
Sunshine,2316,4,ohmamarge,,200.0,ltbx,The system here in the Philippines is broken
Sunshine,2316,5,ohmamarge,,200.0,ltbx,"Abortion is heavily stigmatized, and this movie only shows a glimpse of what so many women go through in this country"
Sunshine,2316,6,ohmamarge,,200.0,ltbx,Abortion is not murder
Sunshine,2316,7,ohmamarge,,200.0,ltbx,Women should have the right to make decisions for their own bodies if they have the capacity to do…

Sunshine,2317,2,toyomanzii,,200.0,ltbx,"Napakahalaga na ipaalam sa lahat na hindi lang pagiging ina ang gampanin ng isang babae, kung hindi maging kahit ano base sa kagustuhan niya"
Sunshine,2317,3,toyomanzii,,200.0,ltbx,"Isa pa, ang pelikulang ito at sapat na para maunawaan mo na dapat natin protektahan ang mga bata sa kanilang sarili, at mga bagay na nakapaligid sa kanila"

Sunshine,2319,1,arangxx,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi ako ang target audience ng pelikulang ito dahil isa na akong pro-choice at feminist before I entered the cinema
Sunshine,2319,2,arangxx,,200.0,ltbx,Ang tunay na target audience nito ay ang mga conservative nating parents or mga kakilala
Sunshine,2319,3,arangxx,,200.0,ltbx,What I like about the movie is it doesn't convince its audience to be pro-abortion but it wants them to sympathize with Sunshine and all the Sunshines and Mary Grace in this world
Sunshine,2320,1,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"this is such an important piece of art—for women, from women, as women—especially in the context of the reality of being a filipina living in the philippines"
Sunshine,2320,2,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,the whole runtime genuinely felt like i was watching a piece of philippine cinema history unfold
Sunshine,2320,3,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"i’ve never been so emotionally compelled, invested, and moved over a piece of (ph) film (for quite some time now)"

Sunshine,2320,5,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"the weight and power it bears in emphasizing the ills of society, directing empathy, progressing toward solutions"
Sunshine,2320,6,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"from the opening sequence of the routine, the editing and cinematography of this movie shines"
Sunshine,2320,7,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"quickly pacing up to the story’s compelling conflict, maris’ gripping performance hooks you into a spiraling anxiety"
Sunshine,2320,8,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"that immediate catholic guilt was just perfect in its timing and execution, you can’t help but greatly appreciate how well thought-out this specifically was"
Sunshine,2320,9,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"as she walks through the streets of metro manila aimlessly and frantically all throughout in different parts of the story, it mirrors a striking resemblance of a guarded uneasiness that we women all fear that something bad might happen to us in the streets; it’s a fight for our lives everyday"
Sunshine,2320,10,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"it’s also so bold of a creative decision to figuratively humanize the unborn that at first, suspiciously could have gone wrong in one mishandling of the story but eventually paid off in working favorably by ticking the (filipinos’) tendency for sentimentality—especially with an even darker subplot"
Sunshine,2320,11,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,the casual inhumane reality the common filipino endures
Sunshine,2320,12,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"only by memory, my only issue with the whole cinematic experience is that piolo pascual as a character actor is too damn iconic and too damn handsome that there was literally a collective gasp in the theater when he came out on that one scene"
Sunshine,2320,13,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,di mapugngan ang kilig sa mga tao and were taken aback and away from the story with his perfect sir marco lewk
Sunshine,2320,14,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"yes, my only complaint in the whole film is that gwapo ra kay ka SIR piolo pascual"
Sunshine,2320,15,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"this is balanced by how good of a casting choice miggy is—unrecognizable character actor (complimentary), looks like your typical spoiled teen with a face people can easily hate (complimentary), with his acting adequately matching up to his scene partners"
Sunshine,2320,16,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,pretty sure it was by choice that all the men are the direct a(holes)ntagonists of this story
Sunshine,2320,17,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,fuck the patriarchy
Sunshine,2320,18,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,fuck the system
Sunshine,2320,19,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"in contrast, the relationship with the women around her significantly holds her"

Sunshine,2320,21,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,it’s the gentlest part
Sunshine,2320,22,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,knowing you’re never alone in the struggle
Sunshine,2320,23,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,who knew a simple routine could bring so much emotion to a crowd
Sunshine,2320,24,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,a fitting ending that serves justice to the character and story
Sunshine,2320,25,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,stellar performances
Sunshine,2320,26,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"cinematography, editing, and scoring is divine"
Sunshine,2320,27,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,thank god this is one of those filipino films paced intentionally
Sunshine,2320,28,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,the writing coupled with its humorous takes in such a bleak setting was done so tastefully and appropriately that it never felt out of place
Sunshine,2320,29,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,optimistic for the progressive turnout of the story’s message to the general public
Sunshine,2320,30,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"art shapes culture, culture shapes people, and people shape the world"
Sunshine,2320,31,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,please papa god let this work in our country’s favor
Sunshine,2320,32,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,i’ve only just seen this once and would love to see this a couple of times more in appreciation of the mastery of craftsmanship everyone involved in this production
Sunshine,2320,33,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,"as i always believe that movies can save lives, and can change lives"
Sunshine,2320,34,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,it’s one of those pieces that makes you hopeful of what great cinema (and future) lies ahead for our country
Sunshine,2320,37,gwengutierrez,,200.0,ltbx,lahi ra sad gyud ang igo sa clear reflection of a society you currently live in
Sunshine,2321,1,justsainte,,200.0,ltbx,I LOVE U MARIS RACAL THEY WILL NEVER MAKE ME HATE U#nilokonirico #whoevenisricoblanco
Sunshine,2322,1,summerstreak,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang iniluha ko naman talaga kasi sobrang bigat sa puso knowing how raw and authentic this has been, especially with the fact that a lot of women, even girls, actually experience this, na this just goes way beyond the screen but is a sad reality of some"
Sunshine,2322,2,summerstreak,,200.0,ltbx,"Being a woman will always be both a blessing and a curse, most likely when it comes to fertility, because often it will always be tied down to a woman's worth"
Sunshine,2322,3,summerstreak,,200.0,ltbx,"Being a mom takes a lot of courage, for it requires a lot of sacrifices, dedicating your whole life to a child you've conceived for 9 months"
Sunshine,2322,4,summerstreak,,200.0,ltbx,It makes you appreciate motherhood and admire the women who dream to be a mother who is capable of giving unconditional love and a good life in a sense na they are willing to do everything for their child
Sunshine,2322,5,summerstreak,,200.0,ltbx,"But the truth is not everyone wants to be a mother, and society must learn to respect this kasi it is genuinely for the betterment of everyone, most likely for the child itself"
Sunshine,2322,6,summerstreak,,200.0,ltbx,"Kasi being a mom is such a huge responsibility that most aren't even ready for, and a lot of other factors, such as teenage and unwanted pregnancy and being a victim of sexual abuse, contribute to the decision of termination of the child"
Sunshine,2322,7,summerstreak,,200.0,ltbx,"People often tend to overlook it and deem it as something so negative, but what they fail to see is how this decision will always come from the place of love and care for themselves as well as the baby kasi genuinely I think it is more cruel to continue things you don't even want in the first place 'cause both the child and the parent would only suffer physically, emotionally, and psychologically"
Sunshine,2322,8,summerstreak,,200.0,ltbx,"Also, I hate how women are expected to sacrifice their own dreams, aspirations, and life itself like it's so unfair how men could easily get away with anything, while the the women will be the ones to suffer, be condemned, and be villainized for things that they both did naman"
Sunshine,2322,9,summerstreak,,200.0,ltbx,"Kaya sex education shouldn't really be a taboo topic, especially safe sex kasi it would really be a huge help in preventing unwanted pregnancies"
Sunshine,2322,10,summerstreak,,200.0,ltbx,"Aside from it, grabe ang ganda ng cinematography ng film and sobrang galing ng mga gumanap kasi isinabuhay talaga nila 'yung characters nila to the point na 'you wouldn't even think na this is acting kasi it feels so real"
Sunshine,2322,11,summerstreak,,200.0,ltbx,"Ewan ko but I really loved the fact na they kept the background noises kasi it makes you feel like you are really there with them at that moment, tapos 'yung overall vibes na sobrang Filipino coded"
Sunshine,2323,1,kgrplanas,,160.0,ltbx,"As a Jadaone fan who has watched every one of her films since Tadhana, I can definitely say that this is her best work to date"
Sunshine,2323,2,kgrplanas,,160.0,ltbx,"And of course, this is Maris Racal’s magnum opus in terms of acting"
Sunshine,2323,3,kgrplanas,,160.0,ltbx,It’s her time to shine
Sunshine,2324,1,regsnts,,160.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone <3 the director that you are
Sunshine,2324,2,regsnts,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine and her other film Fan Girl proves that she has an eye for slightly underrated yet incredibly powerful actors and it proves that she is able shed light onto themes that are dark, taboo and real"
Sunshine,2324,3,regsnts,,160.0,ltbx,I love seeing Maris Racal in roles like this and this was perfect
Sunshine,2324,4,regsnts,,160.0,ltbx,"She’s talented, funny and v pretty The fantastical way the characters were introduced made me cringe a little bit, but it reminded me of college theatre days"
Sunshine,2324,5,regsnts,,160.0,ltbx,It’s uniquely Filipino in a way that I can’t describe
Sunshine,2324,6,regsnts,,160.0,ltbx,There were a few rough edges here and there
Sunshine,2324,7,regsnts,,160.0,ltbx,"At one point, I got worried whether or not this film was just overhyped, but the ending powered through to be a film with a lot of heart, yet gripping"
Sunshine,2324,9,regsnts,,160.0,ltbx,Great work
Sunshine,2325,1,brundaughter,,180.0,ltbx,Direktang naipahayag ni Direk Tonet sa pelikula ang problema at pangangailangan ng mga kababaihan gaya ni Sunshine

Sunshine,2326,2,khaleesisig,,160.0,ltbx,"Ang ganda ng pelikula at ng acting ni Maris dito, sana magkaroon pa ng ibang pelikula na nagttrigger sa topics na kadalasan ay considered as taboo sa bansa dahil taliwas ito sa nakalakihan na paniniwala ng ibang henerasyon"
Sunshine,2326,3,khaleesisig,,160.0,ltbx,Hindi madali ang usapan na to pero KAILANGAN gawin dahil dumadami ang kabataan na nalalagay sa gantong sitwasyon
Sunshine,2326,4,khaleesisig,,160.0,ltbx,"Wala man ako sa posisyon na sinapit ni Sunshine at Mary Grace, pero alam ko na sila dapat ay may CHOICE sa kapalaran nila dahil buhay at kinabukasan din nila ang nakataya"
Sunshine,2327,1,karlos_andres_,,200.0,ltbx,This film left me in awe after watching
Sunshine,2327,2,karlos_andres_,,200.0,ltbx,"A brave and bold take from Direk Antoinette Jadaone, Maris Racal graced us with her best performance yet"
Sunshine,2327,3,karlos_andres_,,200.0,ltbx,"This film does not just tackle the taboo, it allows you to think otherwise— that there’s a world out there where options and autonomy matter, that speaking up and standing for what you want is ideal"
Sunshine,2327,4,karlos_andres_,,200.0,ltbx,"This is a film that shows the world the great craftsmanship of Filipino filmmakers, and hopefully more people gets to see this wonderful work of art"

Sunshine,2336,4,reld,,200.0,ltbx,"Should she listen to the voices urging her to preserve a life she does not want, even at the cost of her dreams"
Sunshine,2336,5,reld,,200.0,ltbx,"Or should she listen to herself — to her ambitions, her desires, and her right to choose her own future"

Sunshine,2336,7,reld,,200.0,ltbx,Why must women be forced to choose
Sunshine,2336,8,reld,,200.0,ltbx,PS: Solid ang mga child actors and the lingering scenes that would force you to feel the emotion of the character added so much to the experience
Sunshine,2337,1,cjwtch,,200.0,ltbx,a film about choice amidst the noise a women tries to drown
Sunshine,2337,2,cjwtch,,200.0,ltbx,"alternatively, may the noise from this film somehow drowned out the majority belief about abortion, especially in a Christian-dominated country like the Philippines"

Sunshine,2342,2,florencerosini,,,ltbx,But I think that’s why it matters
Sunshine,2342,3,florencerosini,,,ltbx,What resonates with me most as a woman is how Sunshine powerfully captures a young Filipina’s agency
Sunshine,2342,4,florencerosini,,,ltbx,"Despite growing up in a harsh world, she refuses to let her circumstances define her or dictate her future, thanks to the strength and support of the women around her"
Sunshine,2342,5,florencerosini,,,ltbx,"It speaks volumes about the kind of society we’ve built, the choices we’re forced to make, and how survival, especially for women like me, is not just a quiet resistance, but a brave act of believing in and shaping the future in our own terms"

Sunshine,2348,1,unnasandiego,,100.0,ltbx,giving a voice and half the narrative to unborn children rather than keeping the main focus to the women this is happening to barred me from connecting with this film like i wanted to
Sunshine,2348,2,unnasandiego,,100.0,ltbx,even the “gets ko na” part felt like settling because from the very start her being unprepared or not wanting to be a mother shouldve been enough
Sunshine,2348,3,unnasandiego,,100.0,ltbx,i will concede though the justification for the subject treatment is that we live in a very conservative country and this may hopefully sway people to be more considerate but i was hoping for more
Sunshine,2348,4,unnasandiego,,100.0,ltbx,i hope for more films to come emboldened by sunshine’s example

Sunshine,2390,1,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,sunshine is a film by Tonet Jadaone
Sunshine,2390,2,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,"context is very important because if you have seen jadaone’s films (That Thing Called Tadhana, Fangirl, Alone Together among others) then you will know this is HER film"
Sunshine,2390,3,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,you feel it in every frame
Sunshine,2390,4,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,the writing
Sunshine,2390,5,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,the direction & performances
Sunshine,2390,6,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,there’s no voyeurism here
Sunshine,2390,7,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,no moralizing
Sunshine,2390,8,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,just truth
Sunshine,2390,9,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,"honest, specific, sometimes messy truth about what it’s like to be a woman in this country"
Sunshine,2390,10,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,"not in the headlines, not in theory, but in the streets, in health centers, in quiet conversations with friends who are too afraid to say what they really need"
Sunshine,2390,11,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,maris racal delivers the performance of her life
Sunshine,2390,12,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,she holds back when she needs to
Sunshine,2390,13,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,she breaks in silence
Sunshine,2390,14,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,"she carries every scene with restraint, sensitivity & precision"
Sunshine,2390,15,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,she becomes sunshine
Sunshine,2390,16,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,and it’s the kind of performance that demands to be remembered
Sunshine,2390,17,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,the ensemble is just as grounded
Sunshine,2390,18,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,"jennica garcia, thea, the kid: each one brings something real to the table"
Sunshine,2390,19,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,nothing is forced
Sunshine,2390,20,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,they don’t play characters
Sunshine,2390,21,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,they play people you’ve probably met
Sunshine,2390,22,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,maybe they remind you of someone you know
Sunshine,2390,23,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,maybe they remind you of you
Sunshine,2390,24,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,what makes sunshine work is not the acting or the direction but the refusal to look away
Sunshine,2390,25,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,the film doesnt hide behind a metaphor
Sunshine,2390,26,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,it gives us a manila that feels exactly like the one we move through
Sunshine,2390,27,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,where pamparegla is sold outside churches
Sunshine,2390,28,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,where motels won’t let you in if you’re alone

Sunshine,2390,30,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,"” from my POV, the film takes a narrative risk"
Sunshine,2390,31,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,there’s a device that briefly pulls you out of the realism it builds so well
Sunshine,2390,32,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,but it sticks the landing
Sunshine,2390,33,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,because what matters is that you never stop feeling for these women
Sunshine,2390,34,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,and that you leave the theater asking why stories like theirs still feel unsafe to tell
Sunshine,2390,35,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,"i’ve had my own sunshines, close friends, a relative, a classmate"
Sunshine,2390,36,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,"women who needed care, not judgment"

Sunshine,2390,39,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,”this film deserves a seat in our national conversations
Sunshine,2390,40,glanche,,160.0,ltbx,"not just in cinema panels, but in health committees, in policy rooms, in the offices of people who still think there is a valid excuse to deny access to care"

Sunshine,2402,2,watsooonv,,160.0,ltbx,"But as the film progresses and she becomes more firm with her choices and decisions, the bars go away"

Sunshine,2434,1,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,this one hit omg here r my thoughts - jadaone just gave us a visual storytelling masterclass brah
Sunshine,2434,2,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,The amount of meaning etched into every single frame was so tastefully done and was especially satisfying to watch as a young filipina- they could never make me hate you maris racal omg what a star  sobrang halimaw umarte taena
Sunshine,2434,3,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,- i felt like that gif of leonardo dicaprio pointing at the screen whenever i recognized a filming loc LMAOAOOA like omg thats morayta
Sunshine,2434,4,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,- i really loved the subliminal messages scattered throughout the film
Sunshine,2434,5,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,"all the little moments when you see mothers who clearly did not want to be mothers, the moments when you see children who were born into families unplanned, the moments when the male characters refused to provide assistance when needed"
Sunshine,2434,6,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,they made up such little parts of the plot but they added so much volume to the message- i also really liked the choice of making the aborted children their own characters in the story
Sunshine,2434,7,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,"it may be a double-edged sword kind of thing but i think addressing the ""buhay pa rin yan"
Sunshine,2434,8,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,""" argument by giving the kids their own autonomy and still concluding that despite fear, they truly just want the best for their mothers was just spot onnn- lowk felt too short LOL like feel ko there was potential for more"
Sunshine,2434,9,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,pero the film is enjoyable as it is- somebody else said this already but this was one of those social commentary films that critique today's society simply by showing a woman living a regular week in her life
Sunshine,2434,10,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,Like this is the reality of thousands of filipino women
Sunshine,2434,11,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,The reason this hit so hard for me and for my sister and all the young filipino women in the cinema with us was because sunshine could easily be usi'm really glad this received critical acclaim because its narratives like these that filipinos need to hear
Sunshine,2434,12,555kcs,,160.0,ltbx,"surviving in the conservative catholic philippines as a woman is nawt for the weak  and its about time that progressive, proudly pro-choice films like sunshine make it big"

Sunshine,2437,7,marlbor0lights,,200.0,ltbx,"but, like sunshine, if something doesn't feel right for me, i won't force it"
Sunshine,2437,8,marlbor0lights,,200.0,ltbx,responsibility is a choice
Sunshine,2437,9,marlbor0lights,,200.0,ltbx,it has always been a choice
Sunshine,2437,10,marlbor0lights,,200.0,ltbx,"and if i or someone choose not to take on certain burdens, i trust that He is compassionate enough to understand"
Sunshine,2437,11,marlbor0lights,,200.0,ltbx,"i will always stand with the pro-choice movement, cause no one should be denied the right to make deeply personal decisions about their own body and future"
Sunshine,2437,12,marlbor0lights,,200.0,ltbx,"after watching the movie, yes, MAS na-gets ko na"
Sunshine,2437,13,marlbor0lights,,200.0,ltbx,at mas iintindihin ko pa
Sunshine,2437,14,marlbor0lights,,200.0,ltbx,:) five stars

Sunshine,2439,4,woylan,,180.0,ltbx,link nyo ko dyan HAHAHAHA
Sunshine,2440,1,chickenfelai,,200.0,ltbx,parang mas trip ko yung tatay ni miggy

Sunshine,2441,2,atsumie,,200.0,ltbx,grabe talaga
Sunshine,2441,3,atsumie,,200.0,ltbx,(need to rewatch again dahil na-late kami ni aaron sa first 30 mins xd)
Sunshine,2442,1,nickvan99,,200.0,ltbx,Ayaw kong maging nanay
Sunshine,2443,1,ynez,,140.0,ltbx,we need to actually stop hurtful beliefs and religious ideals from getting in the way of human rights and choice
Sunshine,2443,2,ynez,,140.0,ltbx,hopefully we get better healthcare and better sex ed in our lifetime
Sunshine,2443,3,ynez,,140.0,ltbx,"need to bring to light ""taboo"" conversation topics"
Sunshine,2443,4,ynez,,140.0,ltbx,need policy reforms that aid and protect
Sunshine,2444,1,itsalyswrldd,,200.0,ltbx,Watched this with my sister on the big screen bago siya ipalabas na lang sa limitadong sinehan
Sunshine,2444,2,itsalyswrldd,,200.0,ltbx,Wow… Maris’ Sunshine is innocent and naive and has poor choices
Sunshine,2444,3,itsalyswrldd,,200.0,ltbx,Pero may bukas siyang isip at determinasyon
Sunshine,2444,4,itsalyswrldd,,200.0,ltbx,"Mahal niya ang pangarap niya, at hindi pa bukas ang lipunan na kinagagalawan niya para bigyan siya ng iba pang options"
Sunshine,2444,5,itsalyswrldd,,200.0,ltbx,Very discourse starter
Sunshine,2445,1,coleendevilla,,,ltbx,finally a local abortion film
Sunshine,2445,2,coleendevilla,,,ltbx,pls also see happening and never rarely sometimes always
Sunshine,2446,1,jigne,,200.0,ltbx,Most relevant Filipino film of the 21st century
Sunshine,2448,1,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"alam niyo yung feeling na pagkatapos manood ng pelikula tungkol sa struggles ng modern women, o ng kababaihan in general, parang may nagaalab na galit sa loob mo"
Sunshine,2448,2,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,ganon na ganon ako
Sunshine,2448,3,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"tipong hindi lang galit na umiiyak sa tahimik, kundi galit na kumakabog, galit na gusto mong isigaw, gusto mong may baguhin"
Sunshine,2448,4,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,galit ako sa sistema
Sunshine,2448,5,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"galit ako sa kung paano itrato ang mga babae — na parang katawan lang, na parang obligasyon nilang tiisin, magparaya, manahimik"
Sunshine,2448,6,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,galit ako sa mga bulok na paniniwala na tinuro sa atin at patuloy pa ring pinaniniwalaan
Sunshine,2448,7,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,galit ako sa tradisyon na sinasanto kahit matagal nang nakakasakit
Sunshine,2448,8,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"galit ako sa mga mata na mapanghusga, sa mga bibig na laging may masasabi pag babae ang gumagalaw"
Sunshine,2448,9,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,galit ako sa mundo nyeta
Sunshine,2448,10,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"pero itong galit na 'to, hindi to galit na mauupos lang"
Sunshine,2448,11,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,hindi to galit na lilipas pagkauwi
Sunshine,2448,12,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"ito yung klase ng galit na may pinaghuhugutan — may direksyon, may laman, may pagmamahal"
Sunshine,2448,13,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,galit na gustong ipaglaban ang kapwa
Sunshine,2448,14,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,galit na may layuning itama ang mali
Sunshine,2448,15,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,ganito yung pinaramdam sakin ni direk tonet ngayon
Sunshine,2448,16,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,ramdam mo na hindi lang siya nagdidirect eh
Sunshine,2448,17,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,nagsisisigaw siya sa pamamagitan ng pelikula
Sunshine,2448,18,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"pero sa halip na sumakit ang tenga mo, sa puso siya tumatama"
Sunshine,2448,19,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"at si maris, grabe"
Sunshine,2448,20,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"ibang klase, walang duda"
Sunshine,2448,21,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"sobrang galing niya mag-embody ng role, ang effortless pero ang lalim"
Sunshine,2448,22,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"habang pinapanood ko siya, hindi ko na siya nakita bilang artista eh"
Sunshine,2448,23,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,she felt like someone i knew
Sunshine,2448,24,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,a friend
Sunshine,2448,25,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,a neighbor
Sunshine,2448,26,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,a stranger na napadaan pero dala ang bigat ng buong mundo sa katawan niya
Sunshine,2448,27,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"dama mo sa kanya yung lapot, yung pagod, yung hagard, pero higit sa lahat — yung dignidad"
Sunshine,2448,28,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,yung tahimik pero matapang na dignidad
Sunshine,2448,29,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"at ang mas masakit, 21st century na, pero kailan ba talaga matatapos ang pag-ccrucify sa mga babae"
Sunshine,2448,30,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"bakit pag babae ang may choice — sa katawan niya, sa sex, sa pagiging ina — bigla tayong nagiging moral police"
Sunshine,2448,31,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"gets ko, some people will say, ""eh pinili niya makipag-sex"
Sunshine,2448,32,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,""" oo, pero bakit sa panahong ito, ang pagbili ng condom, ang pag-access sa contraception, ang simpleng pagtanong tungkol sa pts, ay parang kasalanan"
Sunshine,2448,33,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"bakit parang kahit anong piliin ng babae, mali pa rin"
Sunshine,2448,34,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"at sa kaso ni red, bakit parang hindi pa rin siya pinapayagang mamili kung anong gagawin niya sa sarili niyang katawan"
Sunshine,2448,35,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"bakit parang laging may kapalit, laging may parusa, laging may kapwa babae pa nga na una sa paghusga"
Sunshine,2448,36,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"ang ironic, diba"
Sunshine,2448,37,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"ang daming takot sa sex education, sa reproductive rights, pero hindi takot manghusga"
Sunshine,2448,38,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"the more we condemn, the more we isolate women"
Sunshine,2448,39,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"at kapag nagiisa na sila, dun nagsisimula ang desperation — dun sila mapipilitang hanapin ang mga opsyon na mas delikado, mas tahimik, mas mapanganib"
Sunshine,2448,40,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,sana makita ng mga tao na hindi lahat ng babae na nabubuntis ay handang maging ina
Sunshine,2448,41,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,hindi lahat ng katawan ay handang magdala
Sunshine,2448,42,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,hindi lahat ng buhay ay handang isuko ang sariling pangarap para lang maging ina
Sunshine,2448,43,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,at hindi ito dahil masama silang tao — kundi dahil may sarili silang timeline
Sunshine,2448,44,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"sana yung mga taong galit na galit sa konsepto ng ""choice"" ay matutong makinig"
Sunshine,2448,45,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,choice is not evil
Sunshine,2448,46,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,choice is freedom
Sunshine,2448,47,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,and freedom is humanity
Sunshine,2448,48,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,sana maging wake-up call itong pelikula na ang kababaihan ay hindi lang tagapagdala ng buhay — may mga buhay din silang gustong buuin para sa sarili nila
Sunshine,2448,49,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"at kung alam nila sa puso nila na hindi pa sila handa, hindi natin sila dapat pilitin"
Sunshine,2448,50,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,hindi natin sila dapat husgahan
Sunshine,2448,51,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,hindi natin sila dapat ipako sa krus
Sunshine,2448,52,cjparklvr,,180.0,ltbx,"punyeta talaga ang sistema, pero hindi ibig sabihin wala na tayong magagawa"
Sunshine,2449,1,jeffrycarillo,,200.0,ltbx,GETS KO NA
Sunshine,2449,2,jeffrycarillo,,200.0,ltbx,AAAA putangina ang galing mo Maris fucking Racal bumubula bibig ko

Sunshine,2450,2,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,"gustong-gusto ko yung bigat ng pelikula — iyak, inis, at pangamba"
Sunshine,2450,3,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,ayan mga sobrang naramdaman ko sa pelikula
Sunshine,2450,4,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,isa si sunshine sa libo-libong kababaihan na mataas ang pangarap pero kulang sa prebilehiyo
Sunshine,2450,5,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,"dagdag mo pa yung sobrang sulasok na maynila: mabaho, malagkit, madumi, magulo, at maingay"
Sunshine,2450,6,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang tapang na pinagusapan yung abortion sa pelikula
Sunshine,2450,7,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,"ngayon bilang isang lalaki, mas gets ko na ang hirap na pwedeng pagdaanan ng isang babae kung madaming ipinag kakait sa kanya"
Sunshine,2450,8,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,"kahit punong-puno ka ng pangarap, balewala lahat ng yan kung ang kalaban mo mismo ay ang lipunan at ang bansa kung saan ka nakatira"
Sunshine,2450,9,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,may isang eksena na napapakapit na ako sa upuan ko
Sunshine,2450,10,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,"sobrang dilim, sobrang ingay ng paligid pero punong-puno din ng katamihikan"
Sunshine,2450,11,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,ang ganda ganda ng cinematography
Sunshine,2450,12,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,madilim at dadalhin ka talaga sa settings ng maynila
Sunshine,2450,13,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,ang galing galing ng mga character at simbolismo ng isang character — si “bata” (anikka)
Sunshine,2450,14,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,"sa dulo ng pelikula, i took her as a symbolism of her “conscience”"
Sunshine,2450,15,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,"ayaw niyang gawin yun, kaya nagdasal siya at humingi na ng tawad pero sinusundan siya ng konsensya niya — at si annika yun"
Sunshine,2450,16,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang ganda
Sunshine,2450,17,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,"maris, you’re a fcking good as actress"
Sunshine,2450,18,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,walang pintas sa acting mo dito
Sunshine,2450,19,joloxdj,,200.0,ltbx,"mahal na mahal ko si sunshine, at lahat ng sunshine sa mundo"
Sunshine,2451,1,girlsdontshutup,,200.0,ltbx,"pro choice, always"
Sunshine,2451,2,girlsdontshutup,,200.0,ltbx,let women do whatever the hell they want with their bodies
Sunshine,2451,3,girlsdontshutup,,200.0,ltbx,no woman should be shamed or silenced by a system made to cater to men
Sunshine,2452,1,napspainted,,140.0,ltbx,papa p i was rooting for you
Sunshine,2453,1,sealthiele,,160.0,ltbx,"i trust that direk tonet will always, always introduce her female characters with so much care and understanding"
Sunshine,2454,1,mashedpaotatoes,,200.0,ltbx,"This speaks a lot of voices, and Sunshine and Mary Grace is one of them"
Sunshine,2454,2,mashedpaotatoes,,200.0,ltbx,This film tackles a lot of points for discussion about the issue faced by women
Sunshine,2455,1,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,"parang ang tagal na noong huli akong nanood sa sinehan na maraming tao, puno pa"
Sunshine,2455,2,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,"went to watch this with my friends expecting na kaunti lang kami since nasa outside metro manila kami, pero hindi… puno siya"
Sunshine,2455,3,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,nakita pa namin yung iba naming friends pero ‘di sila nakaabot at sa next showing time na sila makakanood
Sunshine,2455,4,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,medyo tmi siya but i just shared how jampacked the cinemas are for this film… and sobrang worth it niya
Sunshine,2455,5,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,best film i have watched this year (minsan lang manood)
Sunshine,2455,6,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,"no but seriously, what this film has ay mahirap pantayan"
Sunshine,2455,7,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,i love it na kahit na it has an obvious subject na tina-tackle eh hindi niya sinasampal sayo kung anong side yung dapat mong piliin
Sunshine,2455,8,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,it even showed both sides of the issue
Sunshine,2455,9,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,"and the irony… OH MY GOD THE IRONY… mapa visual symbolisms o lines, ang daming irony"
Sunshine,2455,10,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,"at sobrang nakakaappreciate yung magsisingit sila ng patama kahit one line lang, ang galing pa rin"
Sunshine,2455,11,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,"from main characters, supporting, to cameos, importante silang lahat"
Sunshine,2455,12,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,ang ganda ng pasok ng mga subplots at kung paano siya na-connect sa main plot
Sunshine,2455,13,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,tapos yung mga nangyayaring sa huli mo lang mage-gets… NAKAKA-MINDBLOWN FOR REAL
Sunshine,2455,14,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,lalo na yung sa dulo… yung gotcha moment doon napaluha pa ‘ko
Sunshine,2455,16,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,so angas
Sunshine,2455,20,zerooclockam,,200.0,ltbx,"siguro kung may masasabi akong negative sa film na ‘to, siguro yung kapag nagtetext or chat si sunshine tapos di accurate yung tinatype niya doon sa lumalabas sa phone niya, hehe…"
Sunshine,2456,1,aronvncnt,,180.0,ltbx,"Mama, mama"
Sunshine,2456,2,aronvncnt,,180.0,ltbx,Eto na ako ngayon kasi hindi mo 'ko pinapakain
Sunshine,2456,3,aronvncnt,,180.0,ltbx,"Sana mapaginipan mo ako, i love you"
Sunshine,2456,4,aronvncnt,,180.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,2457,2,biancapeach,,180.0,ltbx,This film is just too real
Sunshine,2457,3,biancapeach,,180.0,ltbx,Napakagaling ng pelikula sa pagiging rason para mapag usapan ang mga usaping taboo kagaya ng aborsyon
Sunshine,2457,4,biancapeach,,180.0,ltbx,"Hindi man ako relihiyoso pero dama ko ang Catholic guilt na bumubulong, naglilinger sa kalooblooban ko"
Sunshine,2457,5,biancapeach,,180.0,ltbx,"Pero bali-baliktarin man ang pelikula at realidad, ang katotohanan ni Sunshine ay katotohanan din ng maraming kababaihan sa bansa"
Sunshine,2457,6,biancapeach,,180.0,ltbx,"Nawa’y mas mapag-usapan pa ang usapin ng reproductive health, at magkaroon ng ligtas at makataong paraan upang hindi masira ang kinabukasan ng kababaihan na nangangailangan ng tulong kasi hindi pa sila handa"
Sunshine,2458,1,unscathedsom,,200.0,ltbx,what a fucking experience it was
Sunshine,2458,2,unscathedsom,,200.0,ltbx,"I was praying, begging na ma abort yung fetus istg, anyway this film so good and promising, everything is on point and relatable"
Sunshine,2458,3,unscathedsom,,200.0,ltbx,Ang galing din ng scriptwriting hindi siya cringe and ang ganda ng chemistry ni jennica and maris
Sunshine,2458,4,unscathedsom,,200.0,ltbx,"The movie shows the repercussions of illegal abortion and how it endangers women's life just because we do not have safe access to it, our country truly lacks knowledge on health reproduction and safe sex"
Sunshine,2458,5,unscathedsom,,200.0,ltbx,I love how it didn’t shy away on exposing a doctor’s aversion with involvement because it threatens their license
Sunshine,2458,6,unscathedsom,,200.0,ltbx,Huhu pero ang daming na capture nitong movie about unwanted pregnancy and Sunshine’s dream just added depth to it
Sunshine,2459,1,ponzipilato,,200.0,ltbx,"ang sunshine ay kwento ng libo-libong babae na nakikipagsapalaran sa patago at delikadong kalakaran ng quiapo, at ng iba pang lugar sa pilipinas"
Sunshine,2459,2,ponzipilato,,200.0,ltbx,"habang patuloy na tatangkilikin ng mga pilipino ang makitid na ideyang ang moralidad ay nahahati lang sa dalawa —mabuti o masama, itim o puti- dadami ng dadami ang mga babaeng ilalagay sa alanganin ang sarili maibalik lang ang kalayaan nilang piliin angsariling buhay"
Sunshine,2459,3,ponzipilato,,200.0,ltbx,"and no, hindi lang ito tungkol sa mental health"
Sunshine,2459,4,ponzipilato,,200.0,ltbx,"tungkol ito sa kawalan ng choices, sa pagiging biktima ng patriarkal na sistema, sa kawalan ng suporta sa mga atleta, sa paulit-ulit na pang-abuso sa kababaihan at pagtingin na sapat na maging nanay ka na lang"
Sunshine,2459,5,ponzipilato,,200.0,ltbx,hindi dapat tinatapos sa mental health lang ang talakayan sa pelikula na to dahil may higit pa sa usapin na yon ang hain ni antoinette jadaone rito
Sunshine,2459,6,ponzipilato,,200.0,ltbx,"at bago niyo sabihing isip muna bago buka, paano naman ang mga biktima ng rape"
Sunshine,2459,7,ponzipilato,,200.0,ltbx,ang mga may problema sa pag-iisip na napagsamantalahan
Sunshine,2459,8,ponzipilato,,200.0,ltbx,"ang mga batang ni hindi alam ang salitang ""puke"" o ""titi""natutuwa rin ako na bumabalik na ang mga temang ganito sa pelikulang pilipino"
Sunshine,2459,9,ponzipilato,,200.0,ltbx,"mula sa pagpapakita ng epekto ng blind fanaticism (fangirl,2019) hanggang sa kwento ng mga pdl (green bones, 2024) kitang kita na umay na umay na tayo sa kultura ng love teams at comedies na di naman nakakatawa"
Sunshine,2459,10,ponzipilato,,200.0,ltbx,"kung may oras at kakayahan kayo, sana panoorin niyo ang pelikula na to"
Sunshine,2459,11,ponzipilato,,200.0,ltbx,at sana may maiwang bago paglabas niyo sa mga sinehan
Sunshine,2460,1,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,"Hindi tahimik ang Maynila, punong-puno ito ng mga ingay at usok"
Sunshine,2460,2,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,"Dinig ang dumaraang tren, bulungan ng mga tao sa daan, kakaibang tugtugan sa tricycle, nakakasulasok na paligid, at marami pang iba"
Sunshine,2460,3,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,"Mula Avenida hanggang Quiapo, ramdam ko ang nag-aalab na pangarap ni Sunshine"
Sunshine,2460,6,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Hindi siya nagpatinag sa ingay ng paligid
Sunshine,2460,7,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,"Mula umpisa hanggang dulo, buo ang kaniyang loob para sa kaniyang sarili at pangarap"
Sunshine,2460,8,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Walang halong pag-aalinlangan
Sunshine,2460,9,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,"Mahusay ang pagkakahabi ng pelikula, mula cinematography hanggang linya ng mga karakter"
Sunshine,2460,10,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Mahusay ang pagkakaarte
Sunshine,2460,11,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Madaling maunawaan
Sunshine,2460,12,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Hindi ko naramdaman na halos isang oras na ang nakalipas
Sunshine,2460,13,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Hindi nakababagot
Sunshine,2460,14,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Punong-puno ng pangarap at serye ng kawalan ng akses sa sektor ng pangkalusugan
Sunshine,2460,15,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Dinala tayo ni Sunshine sa kaniyang buhay at pangarap
Sunshine,2460,16,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Isa sa tumatak sa akin na eksena ay ang huling tagpo
Sunshine,2460,17,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,"Ginawa niya ang kaniyang stunts, nag-gymnastics siya, sumayaw nang walang pag-aalinlangan at pangamba"
Sunshine,2460,18,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Sumabay sa indayog ng musika habang dinadama ang bawat hampas ng kaniyang ribbon
Sunshine,2460,19,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,"Doon pa lang, alam mo na"
Sunshine,2460,20,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,"Tahimik ang eksena matapos ang pagsayaw, ang higpit ng yakap ay ramdam mo"
Sunshine,2460,21,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Para bang ikaw ang niyayapos at pinapakalma nito
Sunshine,2460,22,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Salamat sa mahigpit na yakap
Sunshine,2460,23,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,"Sa malalim na aspekto, nakalulungkot isipin na hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa rin tanggap ang abortion sa ating bansa"
Sunshine,2460,24,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Nakalulungkot isipin na nawawalan ng karapatan ang mga kababaihan na mamili— na piliin ang sarili at pangarap
Sunshine,2460,25,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Mapagmulat at mapagpalaya ang pelikula
Sunshine,2460,26,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Pinamulat sa atin ng bawat eksena ang isang isyung nangyayari sa ating bansa sa kasalukuyan
Sunshine,2460,27,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,At pinalaya tayo ng pelikula mula sa tanikala ng tradisyunal na paniniwala at pananaw ng karamihan
Sunshine,2460,28,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,"Hindi maglalaon, unti-unti na rin matatanggap ng mga tao ang katotohan na bahagi ng ating karapatan ito bilang kababaihan"
Sunshine,2460,29,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,"Sa huli, isa lang ang sigurado, nanaig ang kaniyang pangarap"
Sunshine,2460,30,amnotcat,,180.0,ltbx,Pinili niya ang kaniyang sarili ng walang halong pag-aalinlangan

Sunshine,2461,2,kalychuchi,,180.0,ltbx,i’ve been wanting to watch this film ever since the trailer came out and it did NOT disappoint
Sunshine,2461,3,kalychuchi,,180.0,ltbx,we need more movies as brave as this one
Sunshine,2461,4,kalychuchi,,180.0,ltbx,"films that can spark meaningful conversations about topics that are usually taboo, especially in a predominantly catholic country like the ph"
Sunshine,2461,5,kalychuchi,,180.0,ltbx,"at di lang ‘to tungkol sa mental health, ha"
Sunshine,2461,7,kalychuchi,,180.0,ltbx,NAPAKAGANDA GUYS
Sunshine,2461,9,kalychuchi,,180.0,ltbx,watch Sunshine while you still can
Sunshine,2462,1,dvnaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"Mahal na mahal kita, Sunshine"
Sunshine,2463,1,ygoismo_,,200.0,ltbx,"“the filipino women and the curse of catholic guilt” despite popular western belief where early stages of pregnancy are just lump of cells and does not count as a human being, this is where pro-choice comes in and protest women’s autonomy through the lens of science"
Sunshine,2463,2,ygoismo_,,200.0,ltbx,in our nation this is not a strong argument as this doesn’t penetrate the teachings of the catholic/christian church where flesh is flesh and the act of aborting a lump of cells is murder
Sunshine,2463,3,ygoismo_,,200.0,ltbx,"now this is where sunshine and the jojo rabbitesque kid brave depiction contradicts with the filipino pro-life argument “future president” and the what ifs of the future child, despite some view this representation as counter productive it actually stands for how much catholic guilt and patriarchal values is imbued from the moment we are born, that’s why no matter how we view ourselves as progressive, modern, and forward, the filipino women still struggle with their autonomy over their body and choices where they face at the mercy of unwanted consequences"
Sunshine,2463,4,ygoismo_,,200.0,ltbx,"that’s why i admire how brave “sunshine” depict the lump of cells as a hallucinatory unborn child where it grounds how filipino culture views it and turns it as a film creative force to show how women no matter the circumstance should have complete autonomy over their body, not in an overly liberal way where everything is muddled in the gray area but as an acceptance that we live in a society where women are still tied to patriarchal reproductive roles and system wherein we disguise feminist liberalism as matriarchal"
Sunshine,2463,5,ygoismo_,,200.0,ltbx,"with abortion still illegal in our country, teenage and unplanned pregnancy a national problem, and contraceptives a taboo subject"
Sunshine,2463,6,ygoismo_,,200.0,ltbx,"this is a film that offers understanding, empathy, and compassion to sunshines out there that are resorting to unsafe, life threatening, and “illegal” ways that society calls bad choices but what is “bad” when it is the only choice they have"
Sunshine,2463,7,ygoismo_,,200.0,ltbx,"lastly i cannot complete this write up without mentioning the lino brocka, i love how it shows manila as a character with its noise, chaos, and decay through the familiar seams of avenida and quiapo with its religious interplay of choice (accessibility to unsafe preganancy pills) and solace of a religious power it holds"
Sunshine,2463,8,ygoismo_,,200.0,ltbx,"maris racal stellar performance will forever hold her in the filipino cinema history as sunshine, as how nora aunor is bona, and hilda koronel is insiang"
Sunshine,2463,9,ygoismo_,,200.0,ltbx,i really really hope more people watch this and be a strong catalyst of change for reproductive rights as it is core a healthcare and human rights
Sunshine,2464,1,ziapascual,,200.0,ltbx,Ang dami kong iyak direk tonet ang galing mo

Sunshine,2465,2,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,"We’re halfway through 2025 and far from its denouement but I must say that SUNSHINE, if not the best, is one of the best and one of the most important films of the year"
Sunshine,2465,3,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,"I’m so sorry, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION FROM LILIA CUNTAPAY, but I believe I now have my new favorite Antoinette Jadaone’s work"
Sunshine,2465,4,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,"They said during the promotion that this is the last day this will be shown here sa provinces and then starting tomorrow, sadly, it will only be shown to 3 cinemas na lang so I felt the substantial need to watch it tonight"
Sunshine,2465,5,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,"Mind you, sobrang bigat pa rin ng pakiramdam ko, tapos na lahat, at ngayon na tina-type ko lahat ng to"
Sunshine,2465,6,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine heavily tackled significantly sensitive issues here in the country - rape, teenage pregnancy, poor healthcare, and machismo"

Sunshine,2465,9,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Ang lala

Sunshine,2465,11,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Give me a span of time to write an essay about this and I will take that challenge without a doubt
Sunshine,2465,12,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,That’s how it affected me big time
Sunshine,2465,13,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,It hits home
Sunshine,2465,14,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Now let’s talk about the performances
Sunshine,2465,15,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,"First sequence pa lang, it’s apparent that Maris Racal studied the role"
Sunshine,2465,16,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Inakap niya at binigyan niya ng kaluluwa yung karakter
Sunshine,2465,17,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Hindi siya bumitaw hanggang final sequence
Sunshine,2465,18,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,She had a lot of silent moments in the film and those were the most powerful
Sunshine,2465,19,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Nakakabingi yung katahimikan na halos hinahabol ko na rin yung hininga ko minsan
Sunshine,2465,20,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,"Jennica Garcia’s character, on the other hand, though it’s just a supporting role, is one of the main highlights throughout"
Sunshine,2465,21,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,"Yung kahit minimal lang yung dialogues niya, tignan mo lang siya sa mga mata niya, maiintindihan mo sya"
Sunshine,2465,22,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,I love her here
Sunshine,2465,23,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,She’s too authentic
Sunshine,2465,24,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,May eksena silang dalawa ni Maris dito and that was when I lost it

Sunshine,2465,30,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,"Maselan, matapang, at may puso"
Sunshine,2465,31,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Salamat sa buhay mo
Sunshine,2465,32,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Nag-uumapaw sa social realism ang pelikula mo
Sunshine,2465,33,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Lino Brocka would’ve been so proud
Sunshine,2465,34,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine knows Manila and all its aches and decays
Sunshine,2465,35,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,May problema ka
Sunshine,2465,36,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,"Okay, pero hindi titigil ang mundo"
Sunshine,2465,37,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Hindi titigil ang buhay ng mga naka-paligid sa‘yo
Sunshine,2465,38,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Dagdag mo pa na nasa Maynila ka kung saan life is always on survival mode
Sunshine,2465,39,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,The film captured those perfectly
Sunshine,2465,40,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,"Lastly, Sunshine doesn't preach or impose"
Sunshine,2465,41,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,She makes her decisions but doesn't force you to change your opinion either
Sunshine,2465,42,aerollism_,,160.0,ltbx,Your role as an audience member is to listen

Sunshine,2469,1,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"a beautiful and important film :"")i spent most of it crying and whispering curses at the screen"
Sunshine,2469,2,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,matagal ko nang alam kung gaano kahirap maging babae sa pilipinas—but watching it unfold onscreen hits differently
Sunshine,2469,3,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"ang hirap kasi lahat ng sakit, galit, at poot makikita mo"
Sunshine,2469,4,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"you’re forced to face the things we’ve been taught to bury, forget, or avoid"
Sunshine,2469,5,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"by the last ten minutes, i was inconsolable"
Sunshine,2469,6,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,ang hirap harapin ng katotohanan na whatever happened in the film—our reality is even worse
Sunshine,2469,7,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"sunshine may be fictional, but her story is the story of all filipinas"
Sunshine,2469,8,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,it speaks the raw and painful truth about how limited our choices are
Sunshine,2469,9,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,lahat tayo si sunshine
Sunshine,2469,10,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"lahat tayo, kailangan pang ipaglaban ang karapatan natin sa sarili nating katawan"
Sunshine,2469,11,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"lahat tayo, pinalaki ng hiya at takot, forced upon us by society’s expectations"
Sunshine,2469,12,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,we’re all just trying to survive the cruelty of our country’s outdated norms and catholic guilt
Sunshine,2469,13,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"as the credits rolled and the lights came on, i looked around at the people seated there with us"
Sunshine,2469,14,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"there were women my age, some younger, some older"
Sunshine,2469,15,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,there were men
Sunshine,2469,16,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"there were lolos, lolas, nanays, tatays"
Sunshine,2469,17,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,so many different lives and experiences
Sunshine,2469,18,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,and all i could think was: “sana lahat ng nandito gets na rin si sunshine
Sunshine,2469,19,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"”and if they don’t yet, i hope they find it in their hearts to have empathy—for her, and for all the sunshines out there"
Sunshine,2469,20,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,i hope this film reaches more people
Sunshine,2469,21,inthezoom,,200.0,ltbx,"but more than that, i hope it urges those in power to finally take a closer look at the very real struggles filipinas face and make the long overdue changes we’ve been fighting for"
Sunshine,2470,1,arkaives,,180.0,ltbx,pinatunayan lang ng pelikulang ‘to na marami talagang gamit ang salitang “putangina”
Sunshine,2470,2,arkaives,,180.0,ltbx,"putangina, ang galing"
Sunshine,2470,3,arkaives,,180.0,ltbx,"putangina, nakakagalit"
Sunshine,2470,4,arkaives,,180.0,ltbx,"putangina, gets na gets ko"
Sunshine,2470,5,arkaives,,180.0,ltbx,"putangina, sana magets na rin ng iba"
Sunshine,2470,6,arkaives,,180.0,ltbx,criminalizing abortion doesn’t stop it from happening; it just fosters more unsafe methods and practices
Sunshine,2470,7,arkaives,,180.0,ltbx,"ang panawagan ng taumbayan, legalize abortion now"
Sunshine,2471,1,rkntndll,,200.0,ltbx,I agree that Sunshine is a great film that every Filipino should watch
Sunshine,2471,2,rkntndll,,200.0,ltbx,It tackles a big and debatable topic that many people would either agree or disagree on
Sunshine,2471,3,rkntndll,,200.0,ltbx,This film helps people understand what abortion is and why we need sex education
Sunshine,2471,4,rkntndll,,200.0,ltbx,"Hands down, Direk Tonet"
Sunshine,2471,5,rkntndll,,200.0,ltbx,"Sobrang galing ng pagkakagawa ng pelikula, hindi siya mahirap intindihin"

Sunshine,2473,1,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,"i just saw my irl Miggy share his review on this movie and fuck you, tangina mo"
Sunshine,2473,2,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,"anyway-growing up mostly surrounded by women, this movie was riveting and relevant"
Sunshine,2473,3,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,"pinanood ko to mag-isa sa mall guys nagulat ako may katabi ko pero wala akong pake, iyak ako nang iyak"
Sunshine,2473,4,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,"naalala ko, i had a friend before who went through (not entirely the same) wanting to get rid of what’s inside her"
Sunshine,2473,5,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,she told me everything at the time and the only help i could offer her was to just listen to her and be there for her
Sunshine,2473,6,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,"she told me how painful it was and even though I wasn’t there physically, the movie depicted how painful it was and i felt it"
Sunshine,2473,7,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,"i also remembered the time how shitty my irl Miggy was although we were never really together and it was only a scare, still, i felt the female rage through Sunshine- nakiki “tangina mo gago” rin ako sakanya kasi tangina talaga sa pakiramdam"
Sunshine,2473,8,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,"at yung eksena nilang mag-ate, naisip ko kung paano din pinagdaanan ng nanay ko yung balita nung malaman niyang buntis siya sa akin"
Sunshine,2473,9,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,"inisip ko na maswerte siyang may kapatid siyang babae, may kakampi siya"
Sunshine,2473,10,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,tinuloy din ng nanay ko ang pag-aabogasya habang dinadala ako at maswerte talaga siya
Sunshine,2473,11,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,pero paano yung mga Sunshine na walang kakampi at hindi pa alam kung anong mga pangarap nila
Sunshine,2473,12,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,yun lang naman gusto kong sabihin hahaha hindi man ito ang unang pelikulang nagrepresenta ng mga ganitong isyu o talakayan sa pelikulang pilipino pero sana mapanood ng karamihan para gets din nila sana
Sunshine,2473,13,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,"palaisipan din sakin kung ano ang nararamdaman o naiisip ng iba na wala sa minority pagkatapos mapanood to kasi bilang isang babae, grabe yung dating sakin ng pelikulang ito"
Sunshine,2473,14,nikaeia,,200.0,ltbx,salamat sa sumulat at sa lahat ng bumuo ng pelikulang ito
Sunshine,2474,1,unscathedsom,,200.0,ltbx,"one more thing, ang kinaganda ng movie na to, it screams walang say ang mga kalalakihan sa sitwasyon nating kababaihan, at it should"
Sunshine,2475,1,yvesntual,,200.0,ltbx,literally left the cinema bawling my eyes out
Sunshine,2475,2,yvesntual,,200.0,ltbx,the world is so unfair to women :(
Sunshine,2476,1,jdlmn,,200.0,ltbx,“Gets mo na
Sunshine,2476,2,jdlmn,,200.0,ltbx,”This line wasn’t meant just for the kid
Sunshine,2477,1,unscathedsom,,200.0,ltbx,"i really thought open ending, like girl, im like okay sige tanggap ko since conservative talaga itong bansang to, basta i have my own conclusion but lo and behold, Direk tonet had better plans"
Sunshine,2477,2,unscathedsom,,200.0,ltbx,"anyway grabe naman hataw si Ariana sa aktingan, Direk said “take five” she and Jennica heard “take lives” galing talaga ni Maris tangina, deserve ang flowers"
Sunshine,2478,1,augustjames_,,200.0,ltbx,wala akong masabi ang ganda tangina

Sunshine,2480,4,raizam,,200.0,ltbx,"Oh, to be an empath and a Filipino woman with so many aspirations"
Sunshine,2480,5,raizam,,200.0,ltbx,This country is a brutal place for us
Sunshine,2480,6,raizam,,200.0,ltbx,That’s the sad truth
Sunshine,2480,7,raizam,,200.0,ltbx,"But heck, the women in this film"
Sunshine,2480,11,raizam,,200.0,ltbx,Just thinking about them makes me teary-eyed
Sunshine,2480,12,raizam,,200.0,ltbx,It’s a given that Maris would shine here

Sunshine,2480,17,raizam,,200.0,ltbx,They can never make me hate you
Sunshine,2481,1,reuel_aldueza,,140.0,ltbx,dami kong gustong sabihin buti na lang kasama kong manood si paul at nakapag-process after
Sunshine,2481,2,reuel_aldueza,,140.0,ltbx,madami rin kasing na-touch na topics yung film under RH
Sunshine,2481,3,reuel_aldueza,,140.0,ltbx,"may mga bahagi yung pelikula na sobrang heartfelt, may mga bahagi na pwede naman na di na rin isama at magsama na lang ng mas substantial"
Sunshine,2481,4,reuel_aldueza,,140.0,ltbx,"pero maganda siya, magandang entryway para sa mga taong open makinig sa usaping RH/abortion, gagaling din umarte ng mga artista"
Sunshine,2482,1,cinefayle,,160.0,ltbx,papa god…
Sunshine,2482,2,cinefayle,,160.0,ltbx,ma-papagod ka talaga sa mga lalake
Sunshine,2483,1,mi9o,,200.0,ltbx,gets ko na
Sunshine,2484,1,mi9o,,200.0,ltbx,this is peak progressive philippine cinema for me
Sunshine,2484,2,mi9o,,200.0,ltbx,its so needed
Sunshine,2484,3,mi9o,,200.0,ltbx,its so necessary
Sunshine,2484,4,mi9o,,200.0,ltbx,"in this current state in the philippines, this film needs to be here"
Sunshine,2484,5,mi9o,,200.0,ltbx,its always been here
Sunshine,2484,6,mi9o,,200.0,ltbx,but to be on a big screen all over philippines; yes
Sunshine,2484,7,mi9o,,200.0,ltbx,it should be here
Sunshine,2484,8,mi9o,,200.0,ltbx,filipinos needs to know this is happening in our country
Sunshine,2484,9,mi9o,,200.0,ltbx,i have so much to say about this film to the point it needs to be a discussion among people who actually gets this film

Sunshine,2484,11,mi9o,,200.0,ltbx,thank you for all the people behind this film from technical to creative

Sunshine,2485,1,mariakrishna,,200.0,ltbx,***TW: SA***Long review ahead
Sunshine,2485,2,mariakrishna,,200.0,ltbx,Honestly having a difficult time writing down my reflections
Sunshine,2485,3,mariakrishna,,200.0,ltbx,First–it was so important to me that Sunshine got pregnant because of consensual premarital sex instead of rape
Sunshine,2485,4,mariakrishna,,200.0,ltbx,For years I have heard people say that the only valid reason for even considering abortion is if the pregnancy is a product of assault
Sunshine,2485,5,mariakrishna,,200.0,ltbx,This conservative mentality is harmful because it insinuates that women have a choice over our bodies only if it has been violated first
Sunshine,2486,1,zdocampo,,160.0,ltbx,Necessary film
Sunshine,2486,2,zdocampo,,160.0,ltbx,"An hour and a half of me feeling a phantom ache for the childhood fear I didn’t know I still had (as in literal, the hotel scene had my stomach churning)"
Sunshine,2486,3,zdocampo,,160.0,ltbx,Refreshing conceit at first but found it muddling at times towards the end
Sunshine,2486,4,zdocampo,,160.0,ltbx,"Jumpscare sir ron, jumpscare that Sunshine’s house is two streets away from mine"
Sunshine,2486,5,zdocampo,,160.0,ltbx,This is the Manila I know
Sunshine,2487,1,ydmk,,160.0,ltbx,The technicals was so clean as we want to call it “pulido”Love the sound design and the edit
Sunshine,2487,2,ydmk,,160.0,ltbx,"Maris was so different in this film, she’s really a sunshine"
Sunshine,2487,3,ydmk,,160.0,ltbx,The cinematography was so spot on
Sunshine,2487,4,ydmk,,160.0,ltbx,Antonette’s writing was so solid that I really feel like watching a 20 years old struggle with this
Sunshine,2487,5,ydmk,,160.0,ltbx,And I’m a little bit bitin and was looking for something that I don’t know because it didn't felt like an hour and forty+ minutes film
Sunshine,2487,6,ydmk,,160.0,ltbx,It was really a fast pace
Sunshine,2488,1,rctan3,,180.0,ltbx,five stars— what bravery to present the reality of the struggles and to have done it very thoughtfully
Sunshine,2488,2,rctan3,,180.0,ltbx,"hirap maging babae sa lipunan na to, crazy"
Sunshine,2488,4,rctan3,,180.0,ltbx,"5 cause i wish that little girl were likeable HAHAHA (Side note that does not affect how i view the film: personally thought it was interesting that there wasnt a definitive moment highlighting the moral dilemma about it, but i understand it was really about how the people around sunshine treated her…"
Sunshine,2489,1,spaniishlatte,,180.0,ltbx,“gets ko na
Sunshine,2489,2,spaniishlatte,,180.0,ltbx,” — tears
Sunshine,2489,3,spaniishlatte,,180.0,ltbx,almost immediately
Sunshine,2489,4,spaniishlatte,,180.0,ltbx,"a lot of issues were tackled so gracefully and with sensitivity in this film, whilst not necessarily favoring any particular side"
Sunshine,2489,5,spaniishlatte,,180.0,ltbx,"the scene where sunshine asks for forgiveness at quiapo church, the same church where she was desperate to find abortion methods, shows how two conflicting views on abortion can be felt at once"
Sunshine,2489,6,spaniishlatte,,180.0,ltbx,"also liked how it depicted the pressure of being an athlete, of maintaining your weight, and of the unrelenting need to train despite your life pretty much falling apart"
Sunshine,2489,7,spaniishlatte,,180.0,ltbx,"if there’s anything i want to praise, it’s the way the film portrayed the role of women supporting one another, from the protagonist, her sister, her coach, the doctor, down to the innkeeper that rushed her to the hospital"
Sunshine,2489,8,spaniishlatte,,180.0,ltbx,"the worst takes in this film were from men (no surprise there) who didn’t even bother asking sunshine how she felt (because in our incredibly conservative & patriarchal society, women are nothing more than their childbearing abilities lmao)"
Sunshine,2489,9,spaniishlatte,,180.0,ltbx,"ultimately, the only valid opinions on a woman’s body & whether or not she should undergo abortion should be hers & hers alone"

Sunshine,2494,3,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,”i grew up in a somehow conservative and very religious household
Sunshine,2494,4,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,i was taught by my elders that abortion is murder
Sunshine,2494,6,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,full stop — that no reason could ever justify the taking of a “human life
Sunshine,2494,7,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,”i never questioned this belief
Sunshine,2494,8,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,until i grew up and learned about the social conditions that surround my imperfect — almost dysfunctional — family
Sunshine,2494,9,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,dumating na sa punto na palagi ko nang tinatanong kung bakit nga ba pinili pa akong ipanganak ng nanay ko
Sunshine,2494,10,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,tinawag ko ang sarili ko na isang kasalanan
Sunshine,2494,11,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,"isang aksidente, hindi sinasadya"
Sunshine,2494,12,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,"eventually, i started to question my own views"
Sunshine,2494,13,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,my mother didn’t have a choice
Sunshine,2494,14,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,but what if she did
Sunshine,2494,15,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,what if her religion did not instill fear onto her — did not make her choose between her dream of living in the US and…me
Sunshine,2494,16,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,what if she was given the right to make autonomous decisions for her own body and for herself
Sunshine,2494,17,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,"the importance of the sanctity of life has long been asserted in, what seems to be, an unending discussion on the controversial topic of abortion"
Sunshine,2494,18,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,these endless queries led me to enlightening myself to a greater picture of things
Sunshine,2494,19,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,THAT criminalizing abortion is a NEGLECT to women’s rights
Sunshine,2494,20,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,"up until this day, women’s health and bodies have been continuously politicized by society"
Sunshine,2494,21,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,"bago natin ituring na isang krimen ang abortion, we first need to view this on a sociopolitical lens"
Sunshine,2494,22,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,bakit nga ba maraming mga babae ang nagpapalaglag
Sunshine,2494,23,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,what i loved about this film is how it portrayed Sunshine’s story in the most raw and harshest way possible
Sunshine,2494,24,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,"direk jadaone, a WOMAN director (yes kailangan iempahsize to), saw Sunshine as a human being — a young woman who FEELS, who DREAMS big for herself"
Sunshine,2494,25,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,not as a criminal but as a real woman with real human flesh with the right to her own life
Sunshine,2494,26,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,even Manila didn’t feel like a foreign place as a Batangueña
Sunshine,2494,27,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,"the entire film was real, we were all living in the same society as Sunshine’s"
Sunshine,2494,28,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,hindi ito pawang fiction lang
Sunshine,2494,29,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,totoo si Sunshine
Sunshine,2494,30,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,she is every young woman who had to choose between herself and a life she does not want for herself
Sunshine,2494,31,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,she is also every young mom who had to choose between the same things
Sunshine,2494,32,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,she is every young woman who is held back by what today’s society deems as morally upright based on outdated religious doctrines
Sunshine,2494,33,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,"she is every young woman who was denied proper healthcare, every young woman who was denied their choices and rights"
Sunshine,2494,34,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,she is every young woman who was neglected by a corrupt system that politicizes on women’s health and bodies
Sunshine,2494,35,lavdrfts,,200.0,ltbx,"thank you, direk jadaone for introducing us to Sunshine"

Sunshine,2501,3,kaakuhan,,160.0,ltbx,"the place itself becomes a character, those shots of sunshine wandering through the urban chaos tell us so much"
Sunshine,2501,4,kaakuhan,,160.0,ltbx,"especially that scene in the cheap hotel near morayta, when the train passes by and it’s like the city is holding her pain, witnessing everything, maybe even screaming alongside her"
Sunshine,2501,5,kaakuhan,,160.0,ltbx,"the way they use sound here is incredible, and almost throughout the film too, like the noise (and sunshine trying to ‘drown’ them out) becomes part of her headspace, you know"
Sunshine,2501,6,kaakuhan,,160.0,ltbx,the city breathes with her loneliness
Sunshine,2501,7,kaakuhan,,160.0,ltbx,"the city is even ‘her’though i find the jojo rabbit inspiration kinda out of place with what the movie already has going for it, maybe it’s just jadaone’s style of directing, trying to move away from brocka’s straight realism into something more surreal, but it doesn’t really work for me since this story needs that grounded feel"
Sunshine,2501,8,kaakuhan,,160.0,ltbx,"still, i appreciate that they didn’t just simplify everything"
Sunshine,2501,9,kaakuhan,,160.0,ltbx,i personally think films should capture the messy (nuance

Sunshine,2501,12,kaakuhan,,160.0,ltbx,what an improvement from her previous film where the character just called the police lol
Sunshine,2501,13,kaakuhan,,160.0,ltbx,"this is how you try to attempt a feminist lens in a movie, especially this one, the character arc trying to ‘break’ from the ‘setup’ of the reality they are set in"
Sunshine,2501,14,kaakuhan,,160.0,ltbx,"like them trying to pull a fourth wall break, but internally, if that makes sense"

Sunshine,2519,2,vincibles,,180.0,ltbx,"Yes, ""gets ko na"", but there's something in the way she calls out ""Sunshiiiine"" with so much love that it makes me tear up each time I hear it in my head"

Sunshine,2537,28,ej_mallari,,200.0,ltbx,"And her body of work definitely shows how great they are due to the notes, lessons and heart she puts to her stories"
Sunshine,2537,29,ej_mallari,,200.0,ltbx,Favorite scene in the whole series of course was the last routine of Sunshine where she hugged the little girl
Sunshine,2537,30,ej_mallari,,200.0,ltbx,Just found myself crying
Sunshine,2537,31,ej_mallari,,200.0,ltbx,"I literally wanted to jump to the screen and hug both of them just to say, ""it's okay"""

Sunshine,2539,4,srikandi,,160.0,ltbx,At iyon ang nakakalungkot

Sunshine,2553,1,pinaligaya,,200.0,ltbx,"gustong gusto kita yakapin, sunshine"
Sunshine,2554,1,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,drown out the noise
Sunshine,2554,2,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,sisimulan ko ’tong review sa paraan kung paano nailantad ang pelikula sa mga manonood— sa ingay
Sunshine,2554,3,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"sa unang parte, maliban sa naging pagsasanay ni sunshine, ay dadalhin ka nito sa marumi at maingay na sulok ng quiapo kung saan nakabudbod ang mga relihiyosong karatula tulad ng “gift of god,” at “in god we trust"
Sunshine,2554,4,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,” hindi ka nito lulubayan subalit halos nakaukit na ito sa bawat ugat natin— para bang isa itong palantandaang isa kang pilipino
Sunshine,2554,5,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"sobrang bigat nung isang scene na umiiyak si sunshine sa labas ng simbahan, nagmamakaawa na tanggalin lang ang sanggol sa loob niya at babawi rin siya sa Diyos"
Sunshine,2554,6,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,dahil iyon naman talaga ang itinuro sa atin tungkol sa relihiyon sa simula palang; ang pagiging kondisiyonal nito
Sunshine,2554,7,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,dito rin na-introduce ang batang karakter na hindi natin nalaman kung ano ang pangalan at kung bakit ba siya sunod nang sunod kay sunshine na parang nakatali sila sa isa’t-isa
Sunshine,2554,8,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,hindi ko alam if napansin din ng iba na hindi totoo/hindi naman nag-e-exist yung bata at isa siyang talinghaga ng magiging anak ni sunshine
Sunshine,2554,9,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"ineencapsulate niya yung pagkakasala, kahihiyan, at trauma sa relihiyon ni sunshine"
Sunshine,2554,10,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"sinusundan siya nito sa bawat balak niya, sinisigawan siya gilid, at pinagdududa ang sarili"
Sunshine,2554,11,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"higit pa diyan, suportado rin naman siya nito"
Sunshine,2554,12,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"ika nga niya, kung ano ang pangarap ni sunshine ay pangarap niya rin"
Sunshine,2554,13,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,kung ano ang nakabubuti kay sunshine ay makabubuti rin para sa kaniya
Sunshine,2554,14,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"sa usapin ng abortion, lingat sa mga tao na bigyan ng kaluluwa ang nagdadala ng bata"
Sunshine,2554,15,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,na para bang isa lamang itong karwahe at hindi taong may puso at pangarap
Sunshine,2554,16,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,na sa sandaling nagkaroon na ng buhay sa tiyan mo ay doon na rin nagsimula ang pagkamatay mo
Sunshine,2554,17,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,dagdag ko lang sa parte ng mga bata bilang representasyon/metaporya ng mga anak na hindi pa naisisilang ay si ariana
Sunshine,2554,18,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"natuwa ako kasi example nga siya ng mga sinasabi ng tao o di kaya nung doktor kay sunshine na, “paano kung maging presidente siya ng pilipinas"
Sunshine,2554,19,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,mag-imbento ng gamot sa aids
Sunshine,2554,20,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,” dahil binahagi niya rin na pangarap niyang mag-artista o di kaya maging unang beking presidente ng pilipinas
Sunshine,2554,21,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"at hindi naman din natin isinasantaboy yung mga posibilidad na ‘yon, pero sa sitwasyon na tulad ng nagdadala sa kanya na si menggay na isang biktima ng incestual at corrective rape bilang isang tomboy, maiintindihan natin kung bakit kinailangan maglaho ni ariana"
Sunshine,2554,22,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,pinabulaanan din ng pelikula ang mga kuro-kuro na aabusuhin ng mga kababaihan ang legalisasyon ng abortion— na baka maging isang gawi na nilang magpalaglag
Sunshine,2554,23,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,naipakita na ang abortion ay hindi madaling piliin
Sunshine,2554,24,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,na kahit sigurado ang isang tao na ayaw niya maging ina ay isa pa rin itong mabigat na pagpasya
Sunshine,2554,25,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"madugo sa puso, madugo sa katawan"
Sunshine,2554,26,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"hangga’t mananatiling walang pagpasya ang mga kababaihan sa kanilang katawan, mananatili rin ang iligal na pagsasagawa nito"
Sunshine,2554,27,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,walang lugar ang mga kababaihan sa ganitong sistema at bansa
Sunshine,2554,28,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"napatunayan ito sa pelikula— mula sa ospital, sa lansangan, pati sa karapatan mamili"
Sunshine,2554,29,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"kahit hindi pa nalalaman ang kasarian ng nasa sinapupunan ni sunshine ay hinalaang lalaki na agad ito, isa na namang tanda na hindi kailanman iniisip ang posibilidad ng isang babae"
Sunshine,2554,30,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"sana sa mga nakapanood nito dahil lang gusto nila si maris, o di kaya’y na-curious sila sa kwento"
Sunshine,2554,31,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,sa mga hindi sigurado sa kinatatayuan nila sa usaping abortion
Sunshine,2554,32,lunarii,,200.0,ltbx,"sana, tulad nung bata, ay masasabi niyo na ringgets ko na"

Sunshine,2561,3,robyngabs,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang galing ni Jennica, ni Elijah, yung mga extras, ang galing ni Maris"
Sunshine,2561,4,robyngabs,,200.0,ltbx,"She really embodied this helpless, desperate young woman"
Sunshine,2561,5,robyngabs,,200.0,ltbx,God I hope direk Antoinette keeps casting her in her films grabe what a duo
Sunshine,2562,4,zev4stian,,160.0,ltbx,"the noise around sunshine gets overwhelming, but she keeps walking toward her dreams, knowing that her steps matter more than the chaos trying to drown her out"
Sunshine,2562,5,zev4stian,,160.0,ltbx,this film shows one of the most important and painful truths that women still go through — being shamed for having control over their own bodies
Sunshine,2562,6,zev4stian,,160.0,ltbx,"it captures what it feels like to be a woman in a country where your choices are questioned, your body is politicized, and your autonomy is treated like a threat, when it shouldn’t be"
Sunshine,2562,7,zev4stian,,160.0,ltbx,there’s nothing wrong with wanting to choose for yourself
Sunshine,2563,1,409films,,180.0,ltbx,"you’re sunshine, olympian"
Sunshine,2563,2,409films,,180.0,ltbx,sunshine’s journey within the whole film was just me rooting for her
Sunshine,2563,3,409films,,180.0,ltbx,well maybe because i am the same age with her right now and that makes me feel how shaken up she is when she found out she’s pregnant (literally experienced the same heavy feeling and cry uncontrollably during that jeepney scene) i know exactly how deeply sunshine feels (pero hindi po ako buntis)
Sunshine,2563,4,409films,,180.0,ltbx,"it was just really such a heavy film and gets na gets ko ang buhay ni sunshine bilang taga-maynila, kung gaano hindi ka-fair ang mundo esp with unprivileged ones and it really captures how it is being a woman in a place like this"
Sunshine,2563,5,409films,,180.0,ltbx,awa nalang talaga
Sunshine,2563,6,409films,,180.0,ltbx,one detail i love about this film on how it exactly captivates manila
Sunshine,2563,7,409films,,180.0,ltbx,the white noise from the crowd and the sound of vehicles and trains that passes by
Sunshine,2563,8,409films,,180.0,ltbx,"it somehow mirrors how sunshine feels, the city is with her"
Sunshine,2563,9,409films,,180.0,ltbx,"that’s why she’s a different person once she collides with ballet, she really drowns out the noise once she picks her ribbon and live by the meaning of her name, sunshine"
Sunshine,2563,10,409films,,180.0,ltbx,"the rehearsal scene at the end really got me bawled my eyes out as getting rid of it was the right thing to do, sunshine will forever be haunted of the child she could have had"
Sunshine,2563,11,409films,,180.0,ltbx,"she’ll certainly thinks about it from time to time and u can’t blame her as we grow up to a catholic country that gives importance to a word ‘family’how i wish the ending could be longer but with technicality, i get it"
Sunshine,2563,12,409films,,180.0,ltbx,"i’m still grateful that we have a film like this, it’s brave, transparent and very realistic with the world we live by everyday"

Sunshine,2566,1,daintysunset,,180.0,ltbx,Beautiful film exploring women's choices (or lack thereof)
Sunshine,2566,2,daintysunset,,180.0,ltbx,It gave the audience a deep dive into the war that goes inside a woman's head as she makes decisions that could have great impact on her future all the while taking into consideration the different opinions of people around her
Sunshine,2566,4,daintysunset,,180.0,ltbx,"5 short of a perfect score because there were symbolism that I personally would want to change but overall, this is a great film"

Sunshine,2569,2,beidadoobee,,200.0,ltbx,"everything about this film from the actors, the plot, and the color grading sobrang on point"
Sunshine,2569,3,beidadoobee,,200.0,ltbx,ang galing rin ng pagkakatagpi tagpi ng kwento kasi napakita na yung mga societal issues ng bansa ay magkakaugat lang rin at nakakalungkot na hindi pa rin nasosolusyunan up to this date
Sunshine,2569,4,beidadoobee,,200.0,ltbx,"lastly, i loved how they made sunshine's character as someone na alam sa sarili niya kung ano yung gusto niya from the start, kaya GETS KO NA"

Sunshine,2576,1,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,Seen @SM North EDSA Cinema 6 w/Post-Show Q&A and Pagpag Session w/Direk Antoinette Jadaone FANTASTIC SUNSHINE 2/2“Gets ko na
Sunshine,2576,2,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,” I still recall that time back in high school when we were taught the morality of abortion in Religion class
Sunshine,2576,3,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"I was a scholar at a conservative Catholic all-boys school, and although I wasn’t religious (nor did I ever practice Catholicism on paper), its discussions almost shaped my beliefs on the subject matter"
Sunshine,2576,4,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,What I did not know was that those beliefs were tied with several factors besides religion such as patriarchy and conservatism
Sunshine,2576,5,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"That was before the pandemic, and since then, my viewpoints have stirred away from every close-minded and male-led influence those so-called teachings had"
Sunshine,2576,6,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"Yet, I still find it unfair that I don’t have to go through those experiences that women go through in this patriarchal society, including that of Sunshine"
Sunshine,2576,7,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"Critics were not kidding about the Lino Brocka comparisons to Sunshine, yet this has that unique female perspective that elevates its authenticity"
Sunshine,2576,8,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"The film is straight-forward, and in doing so, it is raw, visceral, and brutally honest"
Sunshine,2576,9,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"It takes its viewers through an experience rather than dictate or spoonfeed, and it rarely shies away from its reality"
Sunshine,2576,10,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"From the milieu alone — from the shitty healthcare system, to the sheer lack of contraceptives (if you could find them, they’re very expensive), ignorant, privileged boyfriend, and to the conservative religious doctors and rapist relatives — we are already shown that this is not a world suitable for Sunshine and for women like her who are struck with unwanted pregnancies"
Sunshine,2576,11,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,Because that’s the truth of our nation
Sunshine,2576,12,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,Because this is not a country that favors the oppressed
Sunshine,2576,13,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"As the famous saying goes, “Mahirap maging babae, pero mas mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas,” (“It’s impossible to be a woman, but it’s more impossible to be a woman living in the Philippines,”) and that couldn’t be reflected better in this film"
Sunshine,2576,14,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine seeks to reclaim autonomy over her own body, which every woman deserves so but is seldom granted that right"
Sunshine,2576,15,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"Despite the latter being true, we still see Sunshine do everything she could to get that abortion, even if it means having to spend an unreasonable amount of money just to do so"
Sunshine,2576,16,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"Some may say that her story is inspiring, but it’s tragic how inspiration is confused with disturbance"
Sunshine,2576,17,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"This is a story that’s supposed to shed light on the fact of the matter because this is one of many issues in the country that have to be addressed, especially within our own government"
Sunshine,2576,18,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"Even its production design and cinematography that go hand-in-hand highlight how constrictive this place is for those who are forced to go through such uncomfortable, unasked experiences"
Sunshine,2576,19,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,Much of the film’s raw emotions would not have been as impactful without Maris Racal
Sunshine,2576,20,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,Her acting and performance here are simply generational and incomparable
Sunshine,2576,21,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"She may be known for her more comedic roles (and pure wit and vibes in interviews), but her role of Sunshine brings out her more vulnerable side that is just as raw as the attitude of the film itself"
Sunshine,2576,22,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"Among the more underrated performances is Jennica Garcia, who levels up with Maris Racal’s natural performance but brings a distinct, yet supportive dynamic"
Sunshine,2576,23,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"Child actor Annika is also great and is secretly the one who makes some of the more emotional scenes, especially those towards the end, work so well"
Sunshine,2576,24,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"In addition, Meryll Soriano stands out, as do Elijah Canlas, Rhed Bustamante, Xyriel Manabat, Piolo Pascual, and Angeli Bayani – even if the latter two only show up in one scene each"
Sunshine,2576,25,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"Some ongoing debate had sparked since its release here with regards to the weaving of the children subplot into the story, and while it did have its risks, for better or worse, it still cannot be disregarded how brave Antoinette Jadaone and Maris Racal are for telling this kind of story"
Sunshine,2576,26,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"Perhaps it could have been subtler, but in a country like ours, it was necessary to have been told through a more straightforward direction without being too preachy"
Sunshine,2576,27,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"There have been a handful of films out there that tackle abortion and unwanted pregnancies, but what makes Sunshine stand out is the mere fact that it is set in the Philippines"
Sunshine,2576,28,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"We are one of the last few countries to have abortion illegal as we are rooted in traditions influenced by the patriarchy and religion that treat it as an immoral, evil doing and as a taboo simply because, to them, the youth are “being irresponsible"
Sunshine,2576,29,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"” Sunshine never puts the blame on its titular character for its consequential catalyst, and through its depiction of such a life in this country, instead, asks us to question our reality: Did the youth fail us for exploring a natural part of ourselves, or did the adults fail them by placing and enabling all these barriers as mere punishment substituted by the words of “a lesson” or “a teaching”"
Sunshine,2576,30,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"That’s what makes Sunshine scary: The simple fact that it’s set in the Philippines; that women with unwanted pregnancies have to navigate through these stupid barriers, but it also ends with hope for a better future where women are allowed to make choices for their own body"
Sunshine,2576,31,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"In fact, we must also be reminded of this saying: “No uterus, no opinion"
Sunshine,2576,32,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,” Such a timely film that is raw and honest with its sensitive topic that must be talked about because so many women have had experiences like that of Sunshine
Sunshine,2576,35,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,Seeing this at one of the many screenings with Q&A and audience sharing truly added to its communal experience
Sunshine,2576,36,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,"Direk Tonet always mentions how the film is no longer hers but ours now that we have seen it, and you could clearly see and feel it as the credits rolled, with some women opening up about once being a Sunshine or their parents giving birth to them at such an early age"
Sunshine,2576,37,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,It reminds you that those experiences are real and are still happening to other women underground up to now
Sunshine,2576,38,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,It’s also amazing to see an eye-opening drama such as this fill up the theaters more than it did for Fantastic Four (which made for such a whiplash of a double-feature for me because it tackles the opposite theme to Sunshine)
Sunshine,2576,42,joshclaude,,180.0,ltbx,It goes without saying that those who say that Philippine Cinema is nothing compared to Hollywood films should shut up and watch this in cinemas

Sunshine,2588,7,fakedons,,200.0,ltbx,"at the first scenes it gave me a feeling of uneasiness, and worry for Sunshine — maybe that's because of the constant dark grading along with the green or teal background"

Sunshine,2601,2,sammumerp,,180.0,ltbx,Because they always go for the most shallow differences and often time the most hypocritical
Sunshine,2601,3,sammumerp,,180.0,ltbx,"Every city in the Philippines, and for the most part the world, has traffic, hot weather, trashy streets, muggers, and poor air quality, not just Metro Manila"
Sunshine,2601,4,sammumerp,,180.0,ltbx,"This frustrates me because there IS a tangible difference between Manila and other cities, it's just that a city's identity is more spiritual in essence"
Sunshine,2601,5,sammumerp,,180.0,ltbx,"The churches in Cebu City won't have vendors selling abortion pills, nor will doctors in Davao City berate you moments after caring for you after you nearly died from an attempted abortion, but in Manila they do"
Sunshine,2601,6,sammumerp,,180.0,ltbx,"It's a city of people getting by, it's why you go to Manila, and a deep understanding among everyone that that's what they're all trying to do, just get by"

Sunshine,2608,2,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,"sunshine is suffocating, and maybe that's a directorial choice"
Sunshine,2608,3,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,it hits in the most uncomfortable and painful parts of me at times
Sunshine,2608,4,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,it resonates with every woman who has to determine a better choice out of two shitty choices: one that might shackle her freedom or one that may free her but haunt her at the same time
Sunshine,2608,5,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,"it makes you feel rage at systemic failures which birth a backward society that villifies women for their lapses of judgment--damned if they do, damned if they don't"
Sunshine,2608,6,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,sunshine is linear in its plot
Sunshine,2608,7,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,"it never really takes you out of sunshine's head, so you see how raw everything is, how immature she is, how she's desperate and breaking apart but trying to keep it together, and how she's just a kid who fucked up"
Sunshine,2608,8,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,"the film works because of this approach, albeit some plot devices are too on the nose--making them iffy and questionable, and may have muddled the film's stance"
Sunshine,2608,9,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,"there are obvious plot holes, little details that could have enriched the world-building were overlooked"
Sunshine,2608,10,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,"some subplots lack depth, but the performances made me look past on these things, in a sense that it was pleasant enough to watch for me"
Sunshine,2608,11,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,"not for everyone, but everyone should be part of the discussion"
Sunshine,2608,12,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,"jadaone's films are usually hits-or-misses for me, but sunshine is one of her better ones"
Sunshine,2608,13,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,"the message may be clear and hopeful, but real life presents a much darker truth: for most women, there are no olympics and dreams to hold on to"
Sunshine,2608,14,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,"in reality, we still have a long way to go in paving for a more humane society for filipino women"
Sunshine,2608,15,agsbewatchin,,80.0,ltbx,"here's to working towards a future where women are not shamed for reclaiming their agency, and where their indiscretions are not berated and ridiculed, but treated with proper education and compassion"

Sunshine,2615,4,aria_catalogue,,160.0,ltbx,this raises critical questions: how does sunshine’s obligation to herself impact the broader community
Sunshine,2615,5,aria_catalogue,,160.0,ltbx,and what roles do the people around her play in shaping or reinforcing these expectations
Sunshine,2615,6,aria_catalogue,,160.0,ltbx,"i honestly wished there was more screen time, yet in the moments it was given, it still managed to leave a profound message about women's reproductive rights—one that lingers and quietly settles in your mind"

Sunshine,2637,1,nagelafaith,,200.0,ltbx,"Isang matapang at makapangyarihang pelikula, hindi lang dahil sa husay ng pagkakagawa, kundi dahil sa tapang nitong tahasang harapin ang usaping ayaw pag-usapan: aborsyon"

Sunshine,2649,8,dreyoddle,,180.0,ltbx,Kaya gustong gusto ko yung confrontation scene na iginiit ni Sunshine kayna Miggy na ayaw niyang maging nanay
Sunshine,2649,9,dreyoddle,,180.0,ltbx,WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR THEMSELVES
Sunshine,2649,10,dreyoddle,,180.0,ltbx,Living in a really conservative religious country is hell for women nga naman

Sunshine,2652,1,tangedrine,,200.0,ltbx,just learned na adlib ‘yon ni elijah which made it even funnier
Sunshine,2653,1,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,hindi ko inakalang may darating na pelikulang hahawak sa isyu ng aborsyon nang ganito kaaga — at ganito katapat
Sunshine,2653,2,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,"walang paligoy, walang takot"
Sunshine,2653,3,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,hindi lang ito basta kwento
Sunshine,2653,4,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,isa itong matapang na salamin ng realidad na matagal nang pinipiling hindi pag-usapan
Sunshine,2653,5,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,"mula sa bawat linya hanggang sa katahimikan, ramdam ang puso at paninindigan"
Sunshine,2653,6,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,"ang husay mo, direk tonet"

Sunshine,2653,8,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,"at si maris racal, siya ang tamang sunshine"
Sunshine,2653,9,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,"kinarga niya ang bigat ng papel at binuhay ito nang may tapang, lalim, at dignidad"
Sunshine,2653,10,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,isang pelikulang hindi lang dapat mapanood dahil maganda ito kundi dahil mahalaga ang mensaheng dala nito
Sunshine,2653,11,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,"sa ibang buhay, ayoko sanang maging babae"
Sunshine,2653,12,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,"pero ngayon, gusto ko nang baguhin 'yon"
Sunshine,2653,13,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,"at sa susunod na habang-buhay, nawa’y maging babae akong may ganap na karapatan sa sarili kong katawan"
Sunshine,2653,14,greislee,,200.0,ltbx,"dahil sa bansang ito, ang hirap mangarap kapag paulit-ulit kang inaalisan ng kapangyarihan sa sarili mong pagkatao"
Sunshine,2654,1,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,overheard a girl in the restroom saying “at least mabait si [yung character] piolo” and maybe thats what makes this film effective and horrifying
Sunshine,2654,2,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,"patriarchalism masks itself in kindness, in family values, religious salvation, in medicine, in the thought of care"
Sunshine,2654,3,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,we are so deeply entangled in its edifice we cannot decipher care from control
Sunshine,2654,4,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,"against the backdrop of the sticky, restless, and noisy streets of manila, Sunshine becomes a suffocating experience"
Sunshine,2654,5,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,a formidable display of how patriarchy is insidious
Sunshine,2654,6,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,"even the reactions of the women around sunshine are outcomes of its thinking, sometimes its intentional, sometimes unaware"
Sunshine,2654,7,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,the judgement and unsolicited advice are concealed as concern and even sunshine herself isn’t free from it
Sunshine,2654,8,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,"it is literally manifested as an imaginary child that echoes her guilt, pressure, and the moral burden thats placed upon her"
Sunshine,2654,9,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,"There are moments where its subtexts are parallel to Ernaux’s memoir Happening, which is visceral in its honesty about seeking abortion in 60s France, a time where it was illegal there"
Sunshine,2654,10,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,But Sunshine is dangerously current
Sunshine,2654,11,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,Abortion remains illegal in the country because religion and patriarchy is deeply etched that it is indistinguishable from moral law (yet pamparegla pills in quiapo sit on the same shelves as statues of the infant jesus and still our agency must somehow exist in conflict with holiness
Sunshine,2654,12,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,") in the final act, Sunshine’s choice is physically expressed through a routine"
Sunshine,2654,13,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,"her movements make it seem her body is being wrapped in ribbons, constricted and suffocating, but as she continues, the bindings are loosened and ultimately released"
Sunshine,2654,14,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,the film’s profundity lies in its portrayal of abortion not as something easy nor devoid of consequences
Sunshine,2654,15,acadia222,,180.0,ltbx,it is contradicting: physically and emotionally excruciating but undeniably life saving
Sunshine,2655,1,markiiiiiii,,160.0,ltbx,"I cried three times while watching Sunshine, and I cried the hardest during this particular scene"
Sunshine,2655,2,markiiiiiii,,160.0,ltbx,It’s when Pastor Jaime and Miggy visit Sunshine’s house to discuss her future
Sunshine,2655,3,markiiiiiii,,160.0,ltbx,"Instead of asking how Sunshine is feeling in that moment, Pastor Jaime immediately begins outlining plans like offering maternal and healthcare coverage for her and the baby, and even proposing an educational fund up to college for the child"
Sunshine,2655,4,markiiiiiii,,160.0,ltbx,This scene highlights another tragedy that women face in a patriarchal society
Sunshine,2656,1,tighnari,,160.0,ltbx,i will have to edit this review later but
Sunshine,2656,2,tighnari,,160.0,ltbx,"this film is just realistic, with a tinge of imagination (iykyk)"

Sunshine,2660,1,markewry,,140.0,ltbx,SUCH A GOOD FILM
Sunshine,2660,2,markewry,,140.0,ltbx,This film challenges our mainstream media in creating top-notch quality films
Sunshine,2660,3,markewry,,140.0,ltbx,To see Maris Racal in her deepest range yet is such a feat
Sunshine,2660,4,markewry,,140.0,ltbx,The story has such high value and it speaks volumes for women and society itself
Sunshine,2660,5,markewry,,140.0,ltbx,"I just feel like the story has more to tell, and the ending fell short"
Sunshine,2660,6,markewry,,140.0,ltbx,I wanted to see more of the story with the doctor and how everything happened before the ending came to place
Sunshine,2660,7,markewry,,140.0,ltbx,"Overall, more films like this please"
Sunshine,2660,8,markewry,,140.0,ltbx,This film fights along big films and represents Philippine cinema at its best
Sunshine,2661,1,lunariaes,,160.0,ltbx,how hard it is to be a woman in a world that does not believe we can go beyond that
Sunshine,2662,3,0613s,,200.0,ltbx,SUPER RELEVANT
Sunshine,2662,4,0613s,,200.0,ltbx,"ang daming think pieces abt this movie (praises, if you will) but if you watch it mapapasabi ka nalang talaga “geeets” the cinematography bro"
Sunshine,2662,5,0613s,,200.0,ltbx,"ramdam mo yung stress, yung lagkit ng maynila, how complicated her situation isss (parang lahat ng scenes ni maris umiiyak o paiyak siya—-ang galing galing)  ALSO, can I just say how much I appreciate the script"
Sunshine,2662,6,0613s,,200.0,ltbx,"walang metaphors na malalim, puro lang mura, but somehow you create allegories along the way"
Sunshine,2663,1,baileyandi,,200.0,ltbx,A week after watching Sunshine I'm still thinking about this movie
Sunshine,2664,1,swaggyeuku,,180.0,ltbx,did not dissapoint
Sunshine,2664,2,swaggyeuku,,180.0,ltbx,"i love maris and director antoinette other than how the movie portrays abortion, i am so struck by how it tackles ""drowning out the noise"
Sunshine,2664,3,swaggyeuku,,180.0,ltbx,""" in such a noisy city where everything feels like it is pressured how can you ever just drown it out"
Sunshine,2664,4,swaggyeuku,,180.0,ltbx,super left me speechless
Sunshine,2665,1,groutedpork,,200.0,ltbx,Isa sa pinakamagandang pelikula na napanood ko
Sunshine,2666,1,mi1ky_s,,200.0,ltbx,gets na gets ko siya
Sunshine,2667,1,tsukkipo,,160.0,ltbx,really brings really prominent issues to the forefront this is such an important movie to be made in the current climate
Sunshine,2668,1,aussieshark,,200.0,ltbx,"this film is similar sa ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020)"" both films show how society, laws, and silence put all the pressure sa girl, and none on the system that failed her"
Sunshine,2668,2,aussieshark,,200.0,ltbx,so this film is not just about being strong or making better choices
Sunshine,2668,3,aussieshark,,200.0,ltbx,it's abt how society fails women
Sunshine,2668,4,aussieshark,,200.0,ltbx,"it forces them to carry shame, to stay silent, and to face consequences alone"
Sunshine,2668,5,aussieshark,,200.0,ltbx,"while the systems and laws that claim to ""protect"" them do the opposite"
Sunshine,2668,6,aussieshark,,200.0,ltbx,"i appreciate this film sm, it's the kind of film that doesn't ask for applause, it asks for reflection"
Sunshine,2669,1,4ed20,,200.0,ltbx,HANDS DOWN
Sunshine,2669,2,4ed20,,200.0,ltbx,"tangina the best, pagkatapos ng movie napatulala nalang ako kasi utak ko na 'kay sunshine pa rin, i can't remember the last time na nagpalakpakan mga tao after the film wow sunshine is THAT movie'di ako pala-iyak sa pelikula pero isa 'to sa mga nagpaiyak sakin, sinipon nalang sa sinehanANG GALING MO TONET"
Sunshine,2669,3,4ed20,,200.0,ltbx,AT MARIS
Sunshine,2669,4,4ed20,,200.0,ltbx,At sa lahat ng bumuo ng pelikulang 'to
Sunshine,2669,5,4ed20,,200.0,ltbx,"""Gets ko na"
Sunshine,2669,6,4ed20,,200.0,ltbx,"""at sana paglabas ng mga tao sa sinehan, pagkatapos manood, gets na rin nilaA MASTERPIECE"
Sunshine,2670,1,saminfilms,,180.0,ltbx,sana marami pang makapanood na ‘to
Sunshine,2670,2,saminfilms,,180.0,ltbx,napaka ganda ng bigayyy salamattt direk Antoinette
Sunshine,2671,1,outrightdisguzt,,180.0,ltbx,In a world that romanticizes our strength but never softens our suffering
Sunshine,2671,2,outrightdisguzt,,180.0,ltbx,"Nakakatakot, nakakapagod, at napakapayak maging babae— to be a woman is to carry what the world never cared to hold"
Sunshine,2672,1,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,"she fought tooth and nail for her dream, yung buong journey nya parang pagpasok sa butas ng karayom — gets na gets ko"
Sunshine,2672,2,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,there's two specific scenes in this that i find so horrifying
Sunshine,2672,3,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,is there really no hope for women
Sunshine,2672,4,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,etong tanong lang to nasa isip ko in every fucken thing she had to endure
Sunshine,2672,5,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,sunshine's own manifestation of her inner child as her conscience was an interesting part of the movie
Sunshine,2672,6,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,sobrang devastating nung scene sa simula ng movie na nilalayuan nya yung batang version nya; i think the person i would fear to face now is also the child that i once was
Sunshine,2672,7,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,"i had a thought before that everyone on earth was once a child, and not many people can afford to continue being one"
Sunshine,2672,8,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,the scenes with the children in this movie breaks my heart
Sunshine,2672,9,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,yung 'fetus' pinangakuan ng magandang kinabukasan pero yung mga ganap na bata na sa movie ay mga biktima
Sunshine,2672,10,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,"while waiting for our rides home, my friend and i kept thinking how a lot of people are going to misconstrue the point of this movie"
Sunshine,2672,11,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,im nervous na baka gawin tong movie na to as a cautionary tale about abortion imbis na maging enlightenment on how the system fails us in every fucken way of our being
Sunshine,2672,12,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,"but i love to think that, like her name, the sun will shine"
Sunshine,2672,13,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,the light will pass through the darkness
Sunshine,2672,14,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,the final scene with her inner child was so important to me
Sunshine,2672,15,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,gets ko na
Sunshine,2672,16,beabears_,,180.0,ltbx,sana magets nyo rin
Sunshine,2673,1,owasnuts,,200.0,ltbx,ARIANA MENTIONED
Sunshine,2674,1,7lioh,,160.0,ltbx,tackles a very important subject with so much compassion towards the protagonist
Sunshine,2674,2,7lioh,,160.0,ltbx,maris racal done and did that shit
Sunshine,2675,1,denisesurio,,200.0,ltbx,gets na gets ko na :’)
Sunshine,2676,1,rozelrazal,,160.0,ltbx,"hindi niya gusto maging nanay, gets"
Sunshine,2676,2,rozelrazal,,160.0,ltbx,"mataas na respeto para sa’yo, sunshine"
Sunshine,2676,3,rozelrazal,,160.0,ltbx,"maris racal is sunshine, pero grabe ang impact ng isang jennica garcia"
Sunshine,2676,4,rozelrazal,,160.0,ltbx,"lastly direk tonet, salamat muli sa pagbida sa kwento ng kababaihan"
Sunshine,2677,1,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine is an important film—one that Filipinos shouldn’t miss
Sunshine,2677,2,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s not the strongest film, but it’s certainly worth discussing"
Sunshine,2677,3,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,"In fact, it currently tops my list of Filipino movies this year"
Sunshine,2677,4,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,And that’s precisely why I feel a sense of disappointment
Sunshine,2677,5,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,"At the very least, I wish it had resonated more deeply"
Sunshine,2677,6,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,"It had the potential to delve further into its realism, but instead, it chose to spoon-feed every emotional beat, leaving little room for quiet reflection"
Sunshine,2677,7,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,"While I understand why Jadaone took this direction, I can’t say it worked for me"
Sunshine,2677,8,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,"Personally, I wasn’t fully sold on the use of children as a narrative device"
Sunshine,2677,9,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,The way the film delivers its message too overtly makes the subplot involving the 13-year-old feel disconnected and distracting
Sunshine,2677,10,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,"The child character might have been more effective as a symbolic presence, her inner voice, her conscience"
Sunshine,2677,11,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,"Had it stayed that way, rather than taking the more problematic route of literally giving life to unborn children, as in Ariana’s case, the film might have delivered a far more powerful impact"
Sunshine,2677,12,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,"Still, there was a moment near the end, a line that marked a turning point of understanding and acceptance, where freedom was finally felt from guilt"
Sunshine,2677,13,kacecabali,,160.0,ltbx,That scene alone earned the film a 9 out of 10 from me
Sunshine,2678,1,moochichi,,140.0,ltbx,"Tangina mo miggy, bat d ka nag pull out"
Sunshine,2679,1,eriwatch_,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine is definitely a must-watch
Sunshine,2679,2,eriwatch_,,160.0,ltbx,"More than just the brilliant performances, especially by Maris, who portrayed her role with such raw honesty, the film strikes deep because of the story it tells"
Sunshine,2679,3,eriwatch_,,160.0,ltbx,"It dares to talk about what many still shy away from: the state of our healthcare system, the stigma around reproductive rights, and how these deeply affect the lives of women every day"
Sunshine,2679,4,eriwatch_,,160.0,ltbx,"It powerfully shows how abortion is healthcare, and how denying safe, legal options doesn’t stop…"
Sunshine,2680,1,mkgummy,,160.0,ltbx,maris racal really showed up and showed out for this
Sunshine,2680,2,mkgummy,,160.0,ltbx,"amazing that this is even showing here, on this 3rd week as of writing ("
Sunshine,2680,3,mkgummy,,160.0,ltbx,") and i wish more people would watch this in theaters, especially young women and men"
Sunshine,2680,4,mkgummy,,160.0,ltbx,"it sparks uncomfortable discussions and really highlights as much as we want to have a black and white and sometimes gray world, it's really not how it works because we deserve the basic right to our Self"
Sunshine,2680,5,mkgummy,,160.0,ltbx,"the background of manila in all this, the religious imagery, the complex family dynamics seen in the everyday"
Sunshine,2680,6,mkgummy,,160.0,ltbx,"it might not seem much to most, but its a loud and important start to having conversations that can shape change for this damned country"
Sunshine,2681,1,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"The OB admitting section was, and still is, one of the busiest parts of the hospital I worked in as an intern"
Sunshine,2681,2,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"It had been renovated prior to my first duty there, and it would be renovated once again after I'd left"
Sunshine,2681,3,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,Both of those renovations were done in part to address a persistent issue: that the place never runs out of patients
Sunshine,2681,4,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Every day, and especially on Mondays and Fridays, the admitting section would take in a significant number of expectant mothers with all sorts of conditions"
Sunshine,2681,5,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,Some would be giving birth for the first time
Sunshine,2681,6,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Some were veterans who were familiar to the staff working there, giving birth like clockwork every year"
Sunshine,2681,7,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Some had serious conditions alongside their pregnancies that made giving birth extremely complicated, to the point where their current state posed a significant risk for death while giving birth"
Sunshine,2681,8,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Nevertheless, they would slowly fill up the adjacent labor and delivery room, often two to three mothers to a stretcher"
Sunshine,2681,9,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"On very busy days the stretchers would run out, and the labor room would be filled with mothers settling down wherever they could, mostly on the cold, tiled floor"
Sunshine,2681,10,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"I remembered those days in the admitting section when I saw Antoinette Jadaone's latest film, Sunshine, about a young gymnast (Maris Racal) who gets pregnant right before a very important event that might lead to the SEA games and eventually the Olympics"
Sunshine,2681,11,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine doesn't have any qualms about making the decision as she immediately gets to work trying to find an abortifacient to terminate the unwanted pregnancy
Sunshine,2681,12,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,This process is not made easy
Sunshine,2681,13,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Miggy (Elijah Canlas), the man who impregnated Sunshine, wants nothing to do with her after learning of her pregnancy"
Sunshine,2681,14,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"He doesn't even tell her to have an abortion directly, only saying that 'she knows what to do"
Sunshine,2681,15,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"' Getting medical help is equally difficult, and intersects gender with class: medical treatment is expensive (despite the fact that state sponsored healthcare should be financially accessible) and as abortion is still illegal in the Philippines, people resort to black markets to seek the care they need"
Sunshine,2681,16,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Once in a while, the OB admitting section will receive a patient who has lost her child"
Sunshine,2681,17,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Miscarriages are common, and often they are spontaneous"
Sunshine,2681,18,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Once, a mother of a stillborn child asked me if the cries in the next room were her child's, when I knew the infant was lying in a box, ready to be given to back to their parents"
Sunshine,2681,19,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Then there are the other kinds of patients, ones who made a choice like Sunshine"
Sunshine,2681,20,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,They all had their reasons; this was a conscious and informed decision
Sunshine,2681,21,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,After a while you know it when they come in
Sunshine,2681,22,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Sometimes the doctor would come in and tell them that what they did was illegal, some would even threaten to call the police"
Sunshine,2681,23,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,Nothing ever came of it; they were empty threats - often to 'scare' them into not making that decision again
Sunshine,2681,24,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,It always made me uncomfortable
Sunshine,2681,25,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"To be born a woman is to be born into violence, into a world where the odds are stacked against you"
Sunshine,2681,26,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine is not the first film to depict this violence - films like Rae Red's Babae at Baril (2019) and Jadaone's own Fan Girl (2020) are two examples
Sunshine,2681,27,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"They show what a deeply patriarchal society creates: people like Miggy and a certain other character near the end, people who I interpreted as not exactly archetypal or allegorical towards the structures that created them, but as the inevitable products of it"
Sunshine,2681,28,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"But unlike those two films that I mentioned earlier, Sunshine feels far more indignant, full of anger that Fan Girl lacked, and drawing towards a different conclusion compared to Babae at Baril"
Sunshine,2681,29,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Quiapo has been a backdrop for many a Filipino film, and here it is a sanctuary of sorts"
Sunshine,2681,30,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,It is here where Sunshine goes to find the solution to her problems
Sunshine,2681,31,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Ironically draped in religious imagery, it both embodies the faith it represents (as a source of refuge for those who are in need) and as something that stands against its tenets"
Sunshine,2681,32,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a film about choices: the choice to live one's own dream, the choice to live freely as the best person you can be"
Sunshine,2681,33,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine's sister Geleen (Jennica Garcia) coaches Sunshine as she practices in their shared home
Sunshine,2681,34,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Certain background elements (thanks to the film's excellent production design) hint that Geleen, too, was once an aspiring gymnast, whose dreams ended with a baby"
Sunshine,2681,35,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"If she had the choice, would she have lived a different life"
Sunshine,2681,36,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"It shows as well in Geleen's character, and Garcia gives a standout performance as her"
Sunshine,2681,37,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Finally, that idea of ""refuge"" may not refer to Quiapo, but something else entirely"
Sunshine,2681,38,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Throughout the film there are many people, both seen and unseen, who help Sunshine in her quest"
Sunshine,2681,39,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"""Ipagdadasal ko kayo,"" a hilot tells Sunshine after they bring a child to the hospital who made the same choice"
Sunshine,2681,40,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"""Mag-ingat ka,"" another one tells Sunshine as she sets off"
Sunshine,2681,41,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,A sympathetic medical professional gives a knowing look
Sunshine,2681,42,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Every doctor has a story like it: in one of my last rotations at the labor room, a patient walked in nervously in the robe the hospital supplied her"
Sunshine,2681,43,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"It was a very busy day, and pregnant women overflowed on the stretchers and sat on the floor"
Sunshine,2681,44,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"She had no business being here: she looked no older than 14, and she should be going to school and playing with friends, not in the last stages of giving birth"
Sunshine,2681,45,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Suffice it to say, this pregnancy was not her choice"
Sunshine,2681,46,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"If she had the choice like Sunshine did, would she be here"
Sunshine,2681,47,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"On the other hand, the point of the film for me is not whether one makes one choice over the other, but that people like Sunshine and that kid has the ability to choose in the first place"
Sunshine,2681,48,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"Because the labor and delivery room should be semi-sterile, companions (in this case, the kid's very worried mother) are not allowed in"
Sunshine,2681,49,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,But the rest of the mothers in that labor room heard us taking the medical history and heard her story
Sunshine,2681,50,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"The other expectant mothers gave the kid their blankets, talked to and comforted her, up until she gave birth"
Sunshine,2681,51,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,Everyone was that kid's mother that day
Sunshine,2681,52,jrtawasil,,160.0,ltbx,"In a world where you are denied agency, where one is subjected to violence from birth, the least women can do is find refuge in each other"
Sunshine,2682,1,ielho,,180.0,ltbx,FUCK FUCK FUCK THE SYSTEM
Sunshine,2683,1,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,my first film for the month AND IT’S THIS GOOD
Sunshine,2683,2,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,"no notes, honestly"
Sunshine,2683,3,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,it sent THE message as clear as day
Sunshine,2683,4,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,it got its point across without any
Sunshine,2683,5,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,overbearing moralizing

Sunshine,2683,7,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,maris racal and the whole cast were so good
Sunshine,2683,8,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,"it was an honor to watch them portray these characters, esp maris"
Sunshine,2683,9,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,"every time i see her play a character, she is the character"
Sunshine,2683,10,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,SHE IS ALWAYS GOING THROUGH IT
Sunshine,2683,11,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,she goes beyond her past roles all the time
Sunshine,2683,12,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,may this film truly help and get the message through when it comes to the real-world necessities our women need
Sunshine,2683,13,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,"when it comes to reproductive health, nothing is just for convenience"
Sunshine,2683,14,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,"and it’s not only about the ending—it’s ALSO about how important it is to equip the youth with the actual, necessary knowledge about the topic"
Sunshine,2683,15,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,it’s not something that should be hushed
Sunshine,2683,16,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,"let our women know what they can do for themselves, and what they should never allow men—or anyone else—to decide for them"
Sunshine,2683,17,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,"at higit sa lahat, itigil ang ipokrisya"
Sunshine,2683,18,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,"bilang katoliko at pilipino, how do we manage to continue in shaming other people"
Sunshine,2683,19,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,"there SHOULD always be room for conversations pero laging pinapangunahan ng pamamahiya, ng pagtawag ng mga pangalan when kindness should always be the one upfront"
Sunshine,2683,20,swowberi,,200.0,ltbx,"dahil sa wrong order of priority, hindi nakikita ng tao yung tunay na pinagdadaanan ng ibang bumoboses at humihingi ng tulong"
Sunshine,2684,1,nolipols,,160.0,ltbx,"bring all misogynist, conservatives, and the self-centered politicians to actually watch this film"
Sunshine,2684,2,nolipols,,160.0,ltbx,We really need safe and legal abortion here in the Philippines
Sunshine,2684,3,nolipols,,160.0,ltbx,Women's body autonomy should never depend under patriarchy
Sunshine,2684,6,nolipols,,160.0,ltbx,"Annika, the child that you are"
Sunshine,2685,1,acethetical,,160.0,ltbx,"Maris and the rest of the cast were perfectly chosen for the film, with each character making a meaningful contribution to the plot"
Sunshine,2685,2,acethetical,,160.0,ltbx,Maliban sa acting and galing galing din ni maris sa mismong mga gymnast performances niya
Sunshine,2685,3,acethetical,,160.0,ltbx,"To be honest, I initially found Sunshine disturbing and lacking in many parts"
Sunshine,2685,4,acethetical,,160.0,ltbx,"It felt like the film held back, especially in its screenplay and pacing"
Sunshine,2685,5,acethetical,,160.0,ltbx,"But as I reflected more on it, I realized that might have been the point—although many of the scenes were commendably filmed, the film wasn’t trying to entertain; it was trying to confront"
Sunshine,2685,6,acethetical,,160.0,ltbx,"Maliban sa mismong tema ng storya, sobrang daming iba pang paghihirap na danas ng lipunan natin na mismo ako ay hindi aware ang naipakita sa pelikula"
Sunshine,2685,7,acethetical,,160.0,ltbx,The rawness and silence I initially perceived as weaknesses were actually reflections of Sunshine herself—caught between the pressures of gymnastics and the weight of her misfortunes
Sunshine,2685,8,acethetical,,160.0,ltbx,"In that light, I came to see that her quietness was powerful and already served as the message"
Sunshine,2685,9,acethetical,,160.0,ltbx,"The film was created not just to tell Sunshine’s story, but to help us recognize the many ""Sunshines"" around us—especially in the Philippines, where abortion remains heavily stigmatized due to political control and religious conservatism"
Sunshine,2685,10,acethetical,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine challenges us to understand their pain and see their urgent need for help
Sunshine,2685,11,acethetical,,160.0,ltbx,"I truly hope that someday, those in power will recognize that safe and legal abortion is not just a debate—it’s a right every Filipina deserves to have"
Sunshine,2686,1,marculysis,,180.0,ltbx,Sana gets n’yo rin
Sunshine,2687,1,jujuonthatbeatt,,200.0,ltbx,being a woman is so hard
Sunshine,2688,1,sircs94,,,ltbx,Sunshine fue una experiencia bastante sorprendente dentro del contexto del cine mainstream filipino moderno
Sunshine,2688,2,sircs94,,,ltbx,"Saliéndose del margen seguro y cómodo que tiene acostumbradas a las masas a la complacencia social retratada en un romanticismo casi cínico de la pobreza y la glorificación del poder y la influencia, además de la necesidad por rectitud religiosa"
Sunshine,2688,3,sircs94,,,ltbx,"La cinta, desarrollándose sin teatralidad ni grandes despliegues telenoveleros de drama, entiende perfectamente que la sobriedad y sequedad de la realidad filipina de la clase baja no necesita endulzantes para trabajar de manera efectiva y cortante en pantalla"
Sunshine,2688,4,sircs94,,,ltbx,"La cinematografía es excelente, el ritmo es perfecto y las tomas se toman todo el tiempo necesario para declarar visualmente sus ideas, además de que la dirección si bien denota algunos rastros y pequeños momentos de la desconexión farandulera moderna del voyerismo cínico que nos fuerza a sentir lastima por la pobreza, no cae totalmente en ello, demostrando mucha fuerza y entendimiento la gran parte del tiempo"
Sunshine,2689,1,thondelmundo,,160.0,ltbx,"sunshine explored important and sensitive topics that are not only necessary for filipino audience to see but also essential to open dialogues and conversations, to shed light on and ultimately to spark change especially on things that are often labeled as taboo in a conservative and retrogressive country like the philippines"
Sunshine,2689,2,thondelmundo,,160.0,ltbx,"the film does not impose, it only depicts the struggles of the character"
Sunshine,2689,3,thondelmundo,,160.0,ltbx,"it shows her grit, resilience and her power to decide for herself"
Sunshine,2689,4,thondelmundo,,160.0,ltbx,sunshine is a beautiful portrayal of a woman’s ability to choose and her autonomy to determine her fate

Sunshine,2690,6,leisbian,,200.0,ltbx,"It reminded me of the strength, dignity, and resilience that come with being a woman in this patriarchal world— we persevere and adapt, because we have to, but, at the same time, we love and fight because we can"

Sunshine,2699,3,jayehanash,,160.0,ltbx,"the film hits hard on a truth that shouldn't even be up for debate, sa traditional at conservative country na tulad ng atin, it has always been easier for men"

Sunshine,2703,7,philohive,,160.0,ltbx,"there exists an assumption about the matriarchal philippines, a country that holds its female sensibilities to the highest regard in the same way it adores Mary"
Sunshine,2703,8,philohive,,160.0,ltbx,"yet as we are exposed to our society’s deepest cancers, the mask of matriarchy only rings true for as long as it submits to the role of patriarchy and as a result, we are a nation of contradictions because of this reality"
Sunshine,2703,9,philohive,,160.0,ltbx,only in the philippines you can see a catholic girl pocketing abortion pills in a church
Sunshine,2703,10,philohive,,160.0,ltbx,"sunshine is no Mary, and manila is no matriarchy"

Sunshine,2703,15,philohive,,160.0,ltbx,"in spite of this, even with her lack of maturity and the ever-so demanding backdrop of a patriarchal manila, there remains glimmers of hope, her own thriving matriarchy within the small space she can truly call her own"

Sunshine,2709,3,daventurous,,200.0,ltbx,we see individuals who are shaped into believing that personal decisions should be rooted from what is lawful and religiously accepted
Sunshine,2709,4,daventurous,,200.0,ltbx,we never really considered what's best for me beyond laws and beliefs
Sunshine,2709,5,daventurous,,200.0,ltbx,"sunshine is an awakening not just to the affected, but also to those who have power to protect these women and change the narrative towards abortion"

Sunshine,2712,2,tryxsh,,180.0,ltbx,"A tough watch, but a necessary one"
Sunshine,2713,1,generichanna,,140.0,ltbx,recently read the translation of farrokhzad’s review/justification for golestan’s the brick and the mirror where she said the film is a movement in a stagnant environment which should be in motion
Sunshine,2713,2,generichanna,,140.0,ltbx,i think that also applies to sunshine
Sunshine,2713,3,generichanna,,140.0,ltbx,philippine cinema (and even jadaone herself) has a tendency of producing movies that expand the capital
Sunshine,2713,4,generichanna,,140.0,ltbx,"after all, you only get to have a second movie if your first one is profitable enough"
Sunshine,2713,5,generichanna,,140.0,ltbx,"from a moral perspective, sunshine is a dare to move something in philippine cinema"
Sunshine,2713,6,generichanna,,140.0,ltbx,"it’s not the first stroke, of course, and not the boldest either, but this film occupying the same space that other safe bet family dramas and love team romcom is a shift we rarely see these days"
Sunshine,2713,7,generichanna,,140.0,ltbx,it’s a small ripple but it keeps the momentum (or at least rattle the conscience) in an environment that refuses to progress with time
Sunshine,2713,8,generichanna,,140.0,ltbx,"i wish it was bolder, but it is angry, at least"

Sunshine,2714,3,haruhiko_r,,160.0,ltbx,I just love how Sunshine is unapologetic about its message
Sunshine,2714,4,haruhiko_r,,160.0,ltbx,"Despite it being from a country that is critically conservative, it did not care"
Sunshine,2714,5,haruhiko_r,,160.0,ltbx,"Rather, it tried to deliver its essence in a way that makes people understand it"
Sunshine,2714,6,haruhiko_r,,160.0,ltbx,"I am not going to take that plot-wise, it might have lacked"
Sunshine,2714,7,haruhiko_r,,160.0,ltbx,But it did manage to start and end strong

Sunshine,2720,3,tomaytoeo,,200.0,ltbx,"tuwing nadadaan ako ng quiapo tuwing papauwi galing ng pup, andami kong nadadaanang nagbebenta ng herbal na pamparegla, sa panonood ng sunshine ko na narealize na itong mga tao pala na 'to na nasa bangketa ay iyong nakakasaksi sa pinaka-totoo at pinaka-vulnerable na estado ng iilang babae sa atin — kumbaga, ang dami nilang kwento, ang dami nilang danas, at higit sa lahat, sila iyong nakakaintindi sa nararamdaman ng mga babaeng lumalapit sa kanila, sila iyong walang pangmamata"
Sunshine,2720,4,tomaytoeo,,200.0,ltbx,"sana katulad ng mga nagbebenta ng mga pamparegla sa quiapo, maintindihan din ng ibang tao na ang abortion ay hindi isang kasalanan, hindi isang taboo topic, at hindi isang desisyon na nakasalalay sa iba ang sagot"
Sunshine,2720,5,tomaytoeo,,200.0,ltbx,"siguro kung binubuksan lang yung mga diskusyon na katulad nito sa mainstream media, mas lalawak pa yung kaalaman ng mga tao sa abortion at women's rights, pero dahil nga kristiyano at patriyarkal na bansa ang pilipinas, wala tayong napapala"
Sunshine,2720,6,tomaytoeo,,200.0,ltbx,nanatiling mangmang ang karamihan ng mga pilipino rito dahil hindi binibigyan ng pagkakataon na mapag-aralan at malaman ito
Sunshine,2720,7,tomaytoeo,,200.0,ltbx,"singit ko lang din yung role na ginampanan ni annika rito, SOBRANG GALING"
Sunshine,2720,8,tomaytoeo,,200.0,ltbx,like how could you expect that performance from a novice child actress who's not even fluent in filipino tapos gaganap sa isang pelikula na sobrang pinoy
Sunshine,2720,9,tomaytoeo,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang galing lang ni annika at nag-iisang batang aktres na nakapag-paiyak sa akin dahil lang sa isang linya niya
Sunshine,2720,10,tomaytoeo,,200.0,ltbx,THE 'GETS KO NA' SCENEEE FUCCCCKKK ANG LUHA KOOOHH :(( and its even more beautiful kasi that also reflects to annika in real life because she fully understood the role she played in the film :( na para bang mas open-minded pa siya sa karamihan ng mga matatanda sa atin
Sunshine,2720,11,tomaytoeo,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang dami kong luhang binuhos sa sunshine at sobrang dami ko ring natutunan

Sunshine,2724,9,jnllynley,,200.0,ltbx,Why did she give it all up
Sunshine,2724,10,jnllynley,,200.0,ltbx,We don't know
Sunshine,2724,11,jnllynley,,200.0,ltbx,"But maybe it’s because she’s the eldest daughter — the one expected to take care of her siblings, the one who is supposed to work harder, sacrifice more, and carry the heaviest weight"
Sunshine,2724,12,jnllynley,,200.0,ltbx,"Mahirap maging babae, lalo na kung ikaw ang panganay na anak ng pamilya"
Sunshine,2724,13,jnllynley,,200.0,ltbx,"Maybe that’s also the very reason why she’s so supportive of Sunshine’s decision — to have an abortion, to chase her dreams, and to not follow in her footsteps"
Sunshine,2724,14,jnllynley,,200.0,ltbx,"Ate Geleen knows exactly what it’s like to give up everything, and she doesn’t want her younger sister to carry the same burden she did"

Sunshine,2732,1,richard_ong,,180.0,ltbx,Natawa ako sa simula
Sunshine,2732,2,richard_ong,,180.0,ltbx,"Like I love how Sunshine visited QUIAPO Church first, then went to Miggy's school ALL THE WAY in DEL MONTE AVE, QUEZON CITY (Sha Tin in the background and I recognize Miggy's school), smashed his car in his school's parking spot, then ran TO RECTO AVE, MANILA to avoid being caught  Never skipped leg day si Sunshine"
Sunshine,2732,3,richard_ong,,180.0,ltbx,"On a serious note, I love how it is way much more than a pro-choice/pro-abortion movie"
Sunshine,2732,4,richard_ong,,180.0,ltbx,It champions compassion and understanding first through the many hardships that pregnancy poses in a country where abortion is very much illegal
Sunshine,2732,5,richard_ong,,180.0,ltbx,"It's uncomfortable at times, heartbreaking at others, but in spite of the pain and desperation, it's also empathetic at times too, like with Thea and Sunshine's siblings"
Sunshine,2732,6,richard_ong,,180.0,ltbx,Love her sister especially
Sunshine,2732,7,richard_ong,,180.0,ltbx,The only reason why I gave it a 4
Sunshine,2732,8,richard_ong,,180.0,ltbx,5 stars is because there are some
Sunshine,2732,9,richard_ong,,180.0,ltbx,"SOME moments where nabitin ako, like I wish the runtime could be a little longer so we could flesh out some aspects of the film, like Doc Helena, Migs and his dad, and the ending, to name some"
Sunshine,2732,10,richard_ong,,180.0,ltbx,"Overall, I'm SOO GLAD I saw this film"

Sunshine,2737,2,rieluvsri,,180.0,ltbx,"As consistent as the celestial body her name was derived from, she was stern on her decision up until the end of the film"
Sunshine,2737,3,rieluvsri,,180.0,ltbx,"The rawness of the film venturing into the the ""sketchy"" streets of Quiapo, digs into shady transactions covered under the mountains of skyways clouded with ignorance over what minorities have to deal with"
Sunshine,2737,4,rieluvsri,,180.0,ltbx,How does our devotion and concept of purity outweigh the dangers underlying in pregnancy or becoming a mother when one isn't ready to give everything up for a child they bore out of guilt
Sunshine,2737,5,rieluvsri,,180.0,ltbx,Or is this just something they choose to turn a blind eye to when the higher-ups knowingly have put women's lives in the gravest situations yet again
Sunshine,2737,6,rieluvsri,,180.0,ltbx,"Releasing this film in the midst of a conservative country was a bold critique of the proper healthcare we're deprived of, but it was also a cry from all women who deserve better"
Sunshine,2738,1,thatlupin,,180.0,ltbx,This movie is a great critique on the status of abortion in the Philippines

Sunshine,2741,3,kintsugay,,200.0,ltbx,having them cramped up in one space is heartbreaking
Sunshine,2741,4,kintsugay,,200.0,ltbx,"PLUS healthcare workers pushing higher being agendas and being closed minded, sobrang na rage bait ako ma"

Sunshine,2746,2,vajikarp,,200.0,ltbx,Maris was phenomenal and this film will probably stay with me for a long time
Sunshine,2746,3,vajikarp,,200.0,ltbx,Gago umiiyak pa rin ako
Sunshine,2747,1,shulaa,,200.0,ltbx,DEFINITELY WORTH TALKING ABOUT
Sunshine,2747,2,shulaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Galing ng mga cast, walang tapon"
Sunshine,2748,1,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,let me just say na MARIS RACAL IS SUCH AN AMAZING ACTRESS
Sunshine,2748,2,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"totoong haggard nga siya (lol), pero ‘yung haggardness niya, that actually added to everything"
Sunshine,2748,3,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"you can see the pain, the exhaustion, and the heaviness in every scene—it all felt so real"
Sunshine,2748,4,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"grabe, nakakamangha talaga siyang panoorin"
Sunshine,2748,5,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"sobrang husay niya, and because of that, sunshine didn’t feel like a film at all—it felt like someone letting you into her world"
Sunshine,2748,6,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"it felt like sunshine was sitting beside me, telling her story, and all i could do was listen and feel everything"
Sunshine,2748,7,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"from the very beginning, klaro na kay sunshine kung ano ang gusto niya"
Sunshine,2748,8,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi ang maging nanay, kundi ang makasali sa Philippines' national gymnastics team"
Sunshine,2748,9,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,but the world she lives in kept pushing her into a corner
Sunshine,2748,10,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"this film tackled more than just abortion—it exposed how cruel the system is to women, lalo na sa pilipinas"
Sunshine,2748,11,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"it showed the weight of religious beliefs forced onto our bodies, the cycle of abuse, and the daily injustices women face just for existing"
Sunshine,2748,12,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,napakahirap maging babae sa pilipinas tangina
Sunshine,2748,13,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"lahat ng lalaki sa pelikula—si miggy, 'yung tito ni menggay, si tatay ni miggy, pati ‘yung doktor—lahat sila, galit na galit ako"
Sunshine,2748,14,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,bakit babae lagi ang kailangang mag-sakripisyo
Sunshine,2748,15,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"bakit babae ang kailangang mag-adjust, magpatawad, magtiis"
Sunshine,2748,16,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,putangina talaga
Sunshine,2748,17,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"and yet, these characters weren’t exaggerated"
Sunshine,2748,18,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,they were too real
Sunshine,2748,19,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,which makes it even more terrifying—kasi alam nating totoo ‘to
Sunshine,2748,20,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,it happens
Sunshine,2748,21,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,it’s still happening
Sunshine,2748,22,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,what haunted me most were menggay’s scenes
Sunshine,2748,23,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,dun talaga ako tuluyang naiyak
Sunshine,2748,24,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,ang sakit sakit
Sunshine,2748,25,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"gusto ko siyang yakapin, gusto ko siyang ipagtanggol"
Sunshine,2748,26,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,bata pa lang siya pero pasan na niya 'yung bigat ng mundong hindi naman niya kasalanan
Sunshine,2748,27,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"sana sa lahat ng menggay, may sunshine sa buhay nila"
Sunshine,2748,28,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,and then there was anikka
Sunshine,2748,29,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"nung una, akala ko multo siya o guni-guni lang"
Sunshine,2748,30,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"pero habang tumatagal, i realized—she was sunshine’s imaginary child"
Sunshine,2748,31,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,or maybe her younger self
Sunshine,2748,32,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,or both
Sunshine,2748,33,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"she represents so much: a lost dream, a piece of sunshine"
Sunshine,2748,34,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"kaya ‘yung eksena sa dulo, when anikka said “gets ko na,” it wasn’t just her talking—it was also sunshine finally accepting her own decision"
Sunshine,2748,35,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,grabe ‘yung iyak ko dun
Sunshine,2748,36,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,that should be enough
Sunshine,2748,37,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,a woman’s choice should be enough
Sunshine,2748,38,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"the film also showed that women, at our best, are each other’s safe space"
Sunshine,2748,39,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"si coach, si doktora, yung kaibigan, most especially ‘yung ate niya—lahat sila, may dalang simpatya"
Sunshine,2748,40,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,yung presence nila nagsasabing “nandito ako
Sunshine,2748,41,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,” yung scene na tumabi yung ate niya sa higaan sobrang nakakalungkot panoorin
Sunshine,2748,42,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,it reminded me that the first place we should feel supported is at home
Sunshine,2748,43,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,buti na lang at nandiyan ang ate ni sunshine dahil minsan sapat na ‘yung maramdaman mong hindi ka nag-iisasunshine isn’t just a movie
Sunshine,2748,44,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,it’s a wake-up call
Sunshine,2748,45,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,it asks us to reflect—bakit tayo mabilis humusga
Sunshine,2748,46,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,bakit kulang ang pag-unawa
Sunshine,2748,47,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"and most of all, bakit kailangang maging matatag ang babae para lang mabuhay nang payapa"
Sunshine,2748,48,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"sunshine is a beautiful, heartbreaking, and necessary film"
Sunshine,2748,49,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,hindi lang siya basta panoorin
Sunshine,2748,50,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,kailangan mo siyang damdamin
Sunshine,2748,51,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi ka niya pipilitin, pero hahayaan ka niyang mag-reflect, in your own time and your own way"
Sunshine,2748,52,esnufilm,,200.0,ltbx,huge congratulations to everyone who worked on this film

Sunshine,2768,4,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,parang may mabigat na bumalot sa ‘kin nung lumabas ako sa sinehan
Sunshine,2768,5,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang bigat niya sa pakiramdam all throughout
Sunshine,2768,6,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,akala ko hindi ako iiyak

Sunshine,2768,9,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,tuloy-tuloy hanggang matapos ‘yung pelikula
Sunshine,2768,10,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang maiiyak ka talaga to hear those words from your own family
Sunshine,2768,11,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,sunshine needed that support and her ate gave it to her in the most comforting and tender way
Sunshine,2768,12,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,feeling ko hindi coherent ‘to
Sunshine,2768,13,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,word vomit lang talaga pero kailangan kong ilabas na

Sunshine,2768,22,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang effective ni maris as sunshine
Sunshine,2768,23,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,ramdam mo ‘yung desperation niya
Sunshine,2768,24,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,na hindi niya gustong maging nanay
Sunshine,2768,25,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,na gusto niya lang makamit ‘yung pangarap niya
Sunshine,2768,26,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,ang sakit panoorin na alam mong hindi siya masama pero wala siyang choice kung hindi piliin ‘yung pangarap niya
Sunshine,2768,27,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,isa sa mga paborito kong elements ng film ay kung paano ito sobrang women-centered
Sunshine,2768,28,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,puro babae ‘yung nakapaligid at nakaintindi sa kanya
Sunshine,2768,29,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,i love it when women help each other
Sunshine,2768,30,spideypunk,,200.0,ltbx,pero ang sakit din isipin na mga babae lang ang nakaiintindi sa mga pasakit na bitbit ng mga babae

Sunshine,2778,4,blaterwolf,,200.0,ltbx,just quickly reminding me na hindi talaga kailangan ng 2 hours para magkwento sa isang pelikula
Sunshine,2778,5,blaterwolf,,200.0,ltbx,it was gritting and dark which resembles the hopelessness that i felt watching any brocka films
Sunshine,2778,6,blaterwolf,,200.0,ltbx,it has the touch and storytelling of a filipino film maker

Sunshine,2783,3,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,"When I watched it, all I wanted to do was hold Sunshine—hold every Sunshine out there who I know is carrying the weight of this harsh, terrifying society"
Sunshine,2783,4,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,"I still can’t get over the fact that this was shown in Philippine cinemas because, finally, it got the visibility it truly deserves"
Sunshine,2783,5,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,This is the kind of film the world should see
Sunshine,2783,6,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,"When I finished watching it, I already knew the state and how our society would portray abortion and how it was always deemed evil and inhumane but after seeing this film, I felt a sense of relief that finally, a film about women, about abortion, about its effects, not just mentally but physically, and how sometimes, we really just have to understand, for who are we to judge someone who really is just fighting to live through and view women in a way that they should be, respected"
Sunshine,2783,7,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,Even the supporting characters—especially Jennica Garcia—were brilliant
Sunshine,2783,8,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,I felt her love for her sister so deeply
Sunshine,2783,9,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,"Even when Sunshine thought the world had turned its back on her, her sister’s presence was a constant reminder that someone was still there, always beside her, fully aware of the struggles she faced—struggles made heavier because she’s a woman"
Sunshine,2783,10,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,Also a huge role that was portrayed by Rhed Bustamante
Sunshine,2783,11,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,"Just, wow"

Sunshine,2783,13,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,It isn't just fiction it's currently happening today and that's why it should be a story that needed to be shed light on
Sunshine,2783,14,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,"It was tragic, painful to look at but it was real, all of it, and that's what makes it a story worth telling"
Sunshine,2783,15,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,And Maris Racal—what a phenomenal actress
Sunshine,2783,16,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,Her cries pierce right through you
Sunshine,2783,17,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,"Her frustration, her courage, her strength as a woman—all of it shines through"

Sunshine,2783,21,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,"I hope this film becomes a beacon for people like Sunshine, the way she brings life to every twirl of her ribbon and every movement of her body to the rhythm"
Sunshine,2783,22,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,There are so many like her still hidden in the shadows of fear and guilt
Sunshine,2783,23,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,"And yes, we all know that in the Philippines, some mindsets are hard to change—but does it have to stop there"
Sunshine,2783,24,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,Will we allow people like Sunshine to remain caged by a judgmental society
Sunshine,2783,25,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,"Maybe for now, it’s hard"
Sunshine,2783,26,daiskeiz,,200.0,ltbx,"But because of this film, women like Sunshine can finally catch a glimpse of hope"

Sunshine,2787,4,totsofmika,,200.0,ltbx,sa SUNSHINE ko napagtanto na sapat na ang “gets ko na” sa nakararaming tanong sa mundo
Sunshine,2787,5,totsofmika,,200.0,ltbx,"wala na sanang kasamang opinyon o salita, nawa’y turuan natin ang sarili na bigyan sila ng kahit simpleng pagtango sa kung ano man ang maging desisyon nila"
Sunshine,2787,6,totsofmika,,200.0,ltbx,"dahil bago sila dumating sa puntong iyon, alam na nila kung ano ang dapat gawin, wala na ang kung ano mang sumbat"
Sunshine,2787,7,totsofmika,,200.0,ltbx,"dahil si SUNSHINE ay hindi lamang basta babae, o ang magulo at maingay na daan sa avenida, kabilang na ang quiapo na minsan ay naging hingian ng sagot—dahil sya ay ang sarili niyang desisyon, hindi natin o kung sino pa man"
Sunshine,2787,8,totsofmika,,200.0,ltbx,"sa huli ko lang din nareliaze na si annika ay ang anak niyang in-abort, with her saying “gets ko na"

Sunshine,2789,2,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,"5 stars for the movie overall, but here's extra 0"
Sunshine,2789,3,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,5 star for the super random cameo that was also somehow super on the nose
Sunshine,2789,4,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,It's such a good bit that amuses me to no end
Sunshine,2789,5,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,I'd rate the movie higher if not for a plot device that felt completely unnecessary and at times distracting
Sunshine,2789,6,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,"Take it away, and it won't even change anything about the movie"
Sunshine,2789,7,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,"Every time they employed this plot device, it was just so unnecessary and distracting"
Sunshine,2789,8,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,"The movie also squeezed in too many ""unwanted pregnancy"" tropes that it risked being too bloated story-wise"
Sunshine,2789,9,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,"Think of an ""unwanted pregancy"" trope, it's there"
Sunshine,2789,10,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,"They stop short of it being too bloated at the expense of the story (and you have to give it to Antoinette Jadaone for this balancing act), though I still spent a good chunk of the movie wondering how many more tropes were coming"
Sunshine,2789,11,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,"Still the movie is brave, and is made so much better for its bravery"
Sunshine,2789,12,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,It does not shy away from the realities faced by so many women in this country when it comes to maternal health
Sunshine,2789,13,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,It tackled head-on the heavily religious overtones that tends to dominate the conversations around this topic
Sunshine,2789,14,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,It shows the ironic juxtaposition of abortion pills being sold next to religious artifacts
Sunshine,2789,15,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,"But most importantly, it does not get preachy"
Sunshine,2789,16,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,"It does not feel like it is patronizing the audience about what should be in each scene that squeezes your heart, it just shows it"
Sunshine,2789,17,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,But also Jennica Garcia steals the show in every scene is in
Sunshine,2789,18,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,Maris Racal deserves the accolades she's getting for carrying the movie so steadily as its lead and with everything asked of her for the character
Sunshine,2789,19,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,But Jennica Garcia just commands every scene even she doesn't say a word
Sunshine,2789,20,siramaris,,160.0,ltbx,And every scene these two have together was really gold-medal worthy

Sunshine,2793,14,rimuruv,,200.0,ltbx,bawat eksena ng pelikula ay may laman at kontrobisyon sa karakter at flow ng istorya
Sunshine,2793,15,rimuruv,,200.0,ltbx,"sa dinami-dami ng pelikulang pilipino na napanood ko, iisipin ko na napagusapan na lahat ng paksa na maaaring ipakita sa midya"
Sunshine,2793,16,rimuruv,,200.0,ltbx,"pero, totoong taboo pa rin ang usaping aborsyon dito sa atin dahil tayo ay “religious country”"
Sunshine,2793,17,rimuruv,,200.0,ltbx,"sana ay maging daan ang pelikulang ito upang mas maging bukas tayong mga pilipino sa pinagdadaanan ng mga kababaihan, at bigyan sila ng karapatan na magdesisyon para sa kanilang sarili at kapakanan"
Sunshine,2793,18,rimuruv,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang daming kababaihan ang nakaranas ng naranasan ng karakter ni rhed
Sunshine,2793,19,rimuruv,,200.0,ltbx,kailangan pa ba na mag-agaw buhay para magkaroon ng panibagong pag-asa sa buhay
Sunshine,2793,20,rimuruv,,200.0,ltbx,sobra rin ako naging emosyonal sa last scene ni maris at annika
Sunshine,2793,21,rimuruv,,200.0,ltbx,"para sa akin, eto (at ang scene ni maris at jennica) ang nagpakita ng mensahe ng pelikula: pag-unawa"
Sunshine,2793,22,rimuruv,,200.0,ltbx,"gets ko na is such a short, simple, yet heavy statement for someone who feels hopeless, directionless, and who is going through something that will dictate her whole future"
Sunshine,2793,23,rimuruv,,200.0,ltbx,"kudos sayo, mom tonet at sa buong produksyon ng pelikula"

Sunshine,2796,5,asterdust,,160.0,ltbx,the sound in this film played a huge huge role so im just rly glad i could hear them properly
Sunshine,2796,6,asterdust,,160.0,ltbx,"but, the fantasy element"
Sunshine,2796,7,asterdust,,160.0,ltbx,i kinda get it but it's sort of corny
Sunshine,2796,8,asterdust,,160.0,ltbx,anyway it's a brave and beautiful film
Sunshine,2796,9,asterdust,,160.0,ltbx,it's firm with its stance and i think everyone should see it
Sunshine,2797,1,gudetamagno,,180.0,ltbx,the quiet desperation of being inches away from your dream makes this even more heartbreaking because this kind of story is far from fiction

Sunshine,2800,2,mikkogv,,160.0,ltbx,"a lot has changed since we have moved from one marcos to another, but the power sunshine holds is to choose the one thing that has endured -- belief"
Sunshine,2800,3,mikkogv,,160.0,ltbx,"driven by ambition, comforted but oppressed by religion, and deceived by folk medicine, sunshine's situation is a product of the convictions of those around her"
Sunshine,2800,4,mikkogv,,160.0,ltbx,fact and fiction are difficult to distinguish from her perspective
Sunshine,2800,5,mikkogv,,160.0,ltbx,"whether the effectivity of unregulated medication or the potential of an unborn child, a pregnant woman has to deal with the gradient of reality that is muddled by a conservative environment"
Sunshine,2800,6,mikkogv,,160.0,ltbx,"importantly, sunshine is not a product of circumstance, but an active agent in negotiating her place amid all of it"
Sunshine,2800,7,mikkogv,,160.0,ltbx,"i have my gripes with the main plot device of her possible unborn children, but i also feel open to interpretations that explain them"
Sunshine,2800,8,mikkogv,,160.0,ltbx,this is going to be an important filipino film and its artistry is probably secondary to how it might change views

Sunshine,2801,3,overlypisces,,180.0,ltbx,this movie is probably one of the most important filipino films ever made
Sunshine,2801,4,overlypisces,,180.0,ltbx,"the sad truth is, it does not exaggerate any details, this is simply the reality of our patriarchal society"
Sunshine,2801,5,overlypisces,,180.0,ltbx,but the film’s strength lies not only in its message but also in how it perfectly captures its setting
Sunshine,2801,6,overlypisces,,180.0,ltbx,"the movie itself is something that the majority of filipino filmmakers should study, a lino brocka-esque portrayal of the grit of manila: the familiar filipino home interiors, the choice of clothes, the 300 pesos motels, the guilt-tripping sermon from conservative boomers, the religious imagery"
Sunshine,2801,7,overlypisces,,180.0,ltbx,"every detail, even the smalles rings true and is authentically filipino"
Sunshine,2801,8,overlypisces,,180.0,ltbx,this is something that elevates it far above many other modern filipino films
Sunshine,2801,9,overlypisces,,180.0,ltbx,"also,  ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE"

Sunshine,2802,2,jellybeanxz,,200.0,ltbx,"”This film clearly shows that it’s usually women who suffer the most and face judgment when it comes to issues like this, especially in countries where it is considered taboo"
Sunshine,2802,3,jellybeanxz,,200.0,ltbx,It also shows the serious and deadly consequences of unsafe abortions in places where legal and safe options are not available na sana gets niyo rin
Sunshine,2803,2,carinalu,,200.0,ltbx,Teka lang
Sunshine,2804,1,27r,,180.0,ltbx,"sincerely, wala akong pakialam sa opinyon ng isang celebrity pero if you somehow walk out of the cinema thinking this film is about ""mental health"", how unfortunate (very reductionist of me to put her point that way pero still, how unfortunate); managed to talk about a topic so difficult to navigate in a predominantly roman catholic country that continually insists that misunderstood scriptures, dated laws, and sexist norms should dictate the choice of a woman over her OWN body; ganda ng visuals and line delivery for the most part"
Sunshine,2805,1,vqlerieez,,180.0,ltbx,It’s hard being a woman—and this film knows it
Sunshine,2806,1,aurora_firefly,,180.0,ltbx,Mahirap tanggapin na ito ang pasanin ng bawat babae sa Pilipinas
Sunshine,2806,2,aurora_firefly,,180.0,ltbx,"Punong-puno ng kontradiksyon ang pundasyon ng pagka-Pilipino natin—mula relihiyon, mga tradisyon at paniniwala, at moralidad"
Sunshine,2806,3,aurora_firefly,,180.0,ltbx,"Mapapaisip ka na lang talaga kung ilang Sunshine at Menggay ang nagmumulto sa madidilim, maiingay, at mauusok na mga eskinita sa Maynila"

Sunshine,2809,1,khianvill,,200.0,ltbx,sana naman ma-gets na—or at least mag-start na ng usapan sa topic na to—ng taumbayan kung bakit sobrang mahalaga ang abortion
Sunshine,2809,2,khianvill,,200.0,ltbx,it’s not a black and white issue kung saan mali na agad siya kasi labag siya sa batas ng diyos
Sunshine,2809,3,khianvill,,200.0,ltbx,i really loved how the movie was directed; kuhang-kuha talaga yung emosyon ng mga characters pati na rin yung sobrang pagkagulo ng manila
Sunshine,2809,4,khianvill,,200.0,ltbx,i loved how maris portrayed sunshine
Sunshine,2809,5,khianvill,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang raw and authentic ng pag-act niya lalo na yung kaba niyang tatanggalin na siya sa roster na nagdulot ng pagkadesperada niyang makaalis sa sitwasyong iyon para makamit yung mga pangarap niya
Sunshine,2809,6,khianvill,,200.0,ltbx,"to all the sunshines out there, i see you"

Sunshine,2813,1,hoelymari,,120.0,ltbx,this just supported and strengthened my stance as a pro-choice
Sunshine,2813,2,hoelymari,,120.0,ltbx,i believe a woman must have the freedom to choose what to do with their own body as we're not the one experiencing what they're going through bearing that unborn child of them
Sunshine,2813,3,hoelymari,,120.0,ltbx,"kudos to maris for portraying her role so well, and to sunshine for being so brave to choose herself and pursue her dreams first despite knowing she might be judged by other people for what she did"

Sunshine,2825,3,arvinjoseph,,160.0,ltbx,Hoping for women to finally have the safe abortion choices they deserve
Sunshine,2826,1,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,The best Filipino film of the year so far
Sunshine,2826,2,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,Perhaps also the best locally made sports drama in recent memory
Sunshine,2826,3,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,No glitz and glamor and just plainly focused on the realities and internal struggles of athletes
Sunshine,2826,4,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,The vision and the photography of the film is on point
Sunshine,2826,5,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,"Pinoy na pinoy ang atake, lalo na 'yung mga shots sa Quiapo at Avenida"
Sunshine,2826,6,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,"Hindi rin 'to natakot talakayin ang issues ng teenage pregnancy, abortion, toxic religiosity, incest, matinding kahirapan at kabulukan ng sistema ng health care sa bansa"
Sunshine,2826,7,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,The best part of the film
Sunshine,2826,8,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,Maris Racal
Sunshine,2826,10,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,"Give her a role, enough time, and she can do anything"
Sunshine,2826,11,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,"That performance towards the end shows how she worked hard to emulate a rhythmic gymnast, to perform the craft assigned to her"
Sunshine,2826,12,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,"Obviously, the most dedicated, if not the best, actress of this generation"
Sunshine,2826,13,rhvvstn,,180.0,ltbx,"'Di masyadong sikat, walang masyadong top billing pero wala kang masasabi pagdating sa galing at puso sa bawat role na binibigay sa kanya"
Sunshine,2827,1,odengtea,,200.0,ltbx,the most relevant filipino film this 2025
Sunshine,2827,2,odengtea,,200.0,ltbx,"everything about this film felt raw, honest, and real"
Sunshine,2827,3,odengtea,,200.0,ltbx,"from the acting to the cinematography, every scene felt intentional"
Sunshine,2827,4,odengtea,,200.0,ltbx,"the desperation, fear, and guilt in that one jeepney scene really sums up the struggle, shame, and mistreatment that many young women have to face due to the carelessness of men"
Sunshine,2827,5,odengtea,,200.0,ltbx,this film is also proof on how growing up in a country with predominantly very catholic christian views affects the way that we feel about certain choices that we make; kahit na kinakailangan talaga nating gawin
Sunshine,2827,6,odengtea,,200.0,ltbx,"kaya bago bumili si Sunshine ng kailangan niyang bilhin sa quiapo, humingi muna siya ng patawad kay Lord"
Sunshine,2827,7,odengtea,,200.0,ltbx,"overall, a film that caters to many young women—like Sunshine, who just wants to reach the dream she has been working on her whole life in spite of systemic barriers and cultural expectations imposed by a country that values religious beliefs over a woman’s right to autonomy"
Sunshine,2827,8,odengtea,,200.0,ltbx,"gets ko na, Sunshine"
Sunshine,2828,1,naoira,,200.0,ltbx,"from her wardrobe colors down to each and every vital experience that sunshine went through, this film bled womanhood"
Sunshine,2828,2,naoira,,200.0,ltbx,hindi lang tungkol sa sensitibong tema na tinatalakay; tungkol mismo sa choice
Sunshine,2828,3,naoira,,200.0,ltbx,"choice na magpatuloy, choice na sumuporta, choice na magalit"
Sunshine,2828,4,naoira,,200.0,ltbx,ng mga karakter at maging ng manonood

Sunshine,2830,2,httpaula,,200.0,ltbx,"Like men get to enjoy the pleasures of life without a single care kasi una, wala silang iniintindihing consequences"
Sunshine,2830,3,httpaula,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi naman sila mabubuntis, hindi naman nila kailangan pagdaanan ang grueling 9 months ng pagdadalang tao at dahil don, hindi rin nila kailangang isuko or isantabi ang mga opportunities in life"
Sunshine,2830,4,httpaula,,200.0,ltbx,They can go and live their normal lives as usual
Sunshine,2830,5,httpaula,,200.0,ltbx,"Tapos pangalawa, kapag babae ang nabuntis, lahat ng sisi, kahihiyan, at pressure sa kanya agad"
Sunshine,2830,6,httpaula,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi nila mararamdaman yung guilt, yung takot, yung burden kasi hindi naman sila shinashame ng lipunan gaya ng pagshame sa kababaihan"
Sunshine,2830,7,httpaula,,200.0,ltbx,"ewan puro galit at sakit naramdaman ko sa film na to bukod sa walang proper healthcare for women at napakalalang religious influences sa pilipinas, parang awang awa ako saming mga kababaihan na para bang hindi talaga magegets ng mga lalaki yung danas at hirap magiging babae sa lipunang to"

Sunshine,2832,1,aryeolk,,200.0,ltbx,post upcat breakdown pala to
Sunshine,2833,1,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,i didn’t know na the simple “gets ko na” line will have me almost crying sa sinehan
Sunshine,2833,2,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,oa na kung oa pero GETS NA GETS KO
Sunshine,2833,3,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,"it lands because the whole film builds up to it, this idea that women are constantly being misunderstood, questioned, doubted"
Sunshine,2833,4,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,"and then one woman looks at another, sees her pain, and simply says, “gets ko na"
Sunshine,2833,5,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,” that’s the most powerful kind of solidarity
Sunshine,2833,6,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,not saving someone
Sunshine,2833,7,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,not preaching to them
Sunshine,2833,8,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,just understanding them
Sunshine,2833,9,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,the female relationships were the heart of it
Sunshine,2833,10,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,hindi romantic love ang source of salvation dito
Sunshine,2833,11,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,"women helping women, women understanding women, yun ang lifeline ni sunshine"
Sunshine,2833,12,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,"and that, to me, is what makes the movie not just brave, but also beautiful"
Sunshine,2833,13,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,one of the boldest things sunshine did was not moralize
Sunshine,2833,14,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,"a lesser film might’ve gone down the typical route— punishing the character for her sins, forcing her into regret, or ending with her back in the cycle of poverty because she “deserved” it"
Sunshine,2833,15,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,sunshine rejects that
Sunshine,2833,16,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,"it gives her space to want more, unapologetically"
Sunshine,2833,17,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,"that is, in itself, revolutionary kasi sanay tayong makita ang kababaihan na laging martyr, laging nagpapaubaya, laging umiiyak sa ending habang umaandar ang jeep, but here"
Sunshine,2833,18,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,we get a girl who simply chooses her self
Sunshine,2833,19,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,"and that should never have to be a radical act but in our context, it is"
Sunshine,2833,20,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,"because we glorify mothers, “ilaw ng tahanan,” “walang katulad ang pagmamahal ng ina”, pero the moment a woman says that she's not ready for the role, she’s shamed"
Sunshine,2833,21,marikotseee,,180.0,ltbx,our culture wants motherhood without giving women the right to choose it
Sunshine,2834,1,andenganda,,200.0,ltbx,Omg super ganda

Sunshine,2835,1,akeimia,,200.0,ltbx,"“oo, gets ko na"
Sunshine,2836,1,rottenthomathoe,,180.0,ltbx,"and when a system of laws, religion, and society plays repression towards women at its core, they are left optionless but to reach the edges—even the roughest ones"
Sunshine,2836,2,rottenthomathoe,,180.0,ltbx,"this is starkly and assertively depicted in sunshine as it alludes to the fact that although customs and policies are purposed to save, they may also be they very waters that drown us"
Sunshine,2836,3,rottenthomathoe,,180.0,ltbx,and that sequence with the pastor
Sunshine,2836,4,rottenthomathoe,,180.0,ltbx,very nuanced
Sunshine,2836,5,rottenthomathoe,,180.0,ltbx,so good
Sunshine,2836,6,rottenthomathoe,,180.0,ltbx,"goes to show how the patriarchy and the church always find ways, direct or indirect, to monopolize women's choices and liberty"
Sunshine,2836,7,rottenthomathoe,,180.0,ltbx,"in one way or another, we are sunshine"
Sunshine,2837,1,reiram,,200.0,ltbx,omg this is the kind of film i want every filipino girl and woman to watch even just once in their lifetime
Sunshine,2837,2,reiram,,200.0,ltbx,was it heavy-handed
Sunshine,2837,4,reiram,,200.0,ltbx,but the kind that needs to be for our pseudo-conservative society

Sunshine,2840,2,anyaluvr,,200.0,ltbx,"it was so simple pero sobrang gandang line to conclude it, especially after nung scene niya with her ate"
Sunshine,2840,3,anyaluvr,,200.0,ltbx,"kasi throughout the movie, it felt like she only had herself to deal with her unwanted pregnancy"
Sunshine,2840,4,anyaluvr,,200.0,ltbx,na parang walang makakagets sa kanya if she chooses to abort it

Sunshine,2845,1,lordshinozaki,,160.0,ltbx,"first, maris racal—- amazing acting"
Sunshine,2845,2,lordshinozaki,,160.0,ltbx,"i love how the movie is not explicitly pro choice or pro life, but more of a mirror to show the ugly reality of abortion in the countryi just wish that the metaphor in the film landed better— felt like the emotional arc was a bit underdeveloped and lacked some sort of catharsis (huh)"
Sunshine,2846,1,hakobbbxxxx,,160.0,ltbx,"Simple ang kwento ni sunshine pero masalimuot ang pinanggagalingan, it takes courage and compassion to share such a tormenting issue about womanhood"
Sunshine,2846,2,hakobbbxxxx,,160.0,ltbx,Ito ang tunay na pemenistang pelikula
Sunshine,2847,1,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,ok ito na ang review ko na hindi naman ganun ka-relevant (
Sunshine,2847,2,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,") CHARpero kailangan ko lang ‘to ilabas before anything else: maris racal is THE doja cat of the philippines, controversial-wise"
Sunshine,2847,4,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,"GIRL… kasi kahit anong gawin ni maris na “cancellable”, hindi talaga siya ma-cancel because she’s just THAT good"

Sunshine,2847,8,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,this is it
Sunshine,2847,9,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,"mula sa pinanood ko, hindi lang basta-bastang pelikula ang sunshine"
Sunshine,2847,10,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,"given na ‘yung magandang konsepto, storyline, casting, at setting ng pelikula pero gusto ko lang mas i-highlight ‘yung fact na kahit ba sobrang taboo ng “abortion” topic sa pilipinas, direk tonet did what NEEDS to be done and i mean, talk about IT"
Sunshine,2847,11,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,"sa malawak na masang pilipino, kailangan nilang maintindihan na hindi pwedeng tanggapin na lamang ng bawat babaeng maagang nabuntis na dadalhin nila ito hanggang sa mabuhay ang sanggol"
Sunshine,2847,13,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,kasi may mas malawak pang diskusyon labas sa pagbubuntis at ito ang kapalpakan ng sistemang kinagisnan ng karamihan
Sunshine,2847,14,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,"kung maglalaan ng oras ang administrasyon sa pag-aaral hinggil sa kahalagahan ng abortion sa pilipinas, mas gagaan ang buhay ng bawat pilipinang maagang nabuntis"
Sunshine,2847,15,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,"gaya ni sunshine, hindi na nila kailangan pang dumaan sa peligrosong proseso upang ipalaglag ang pagdadalang-tao nila dahil aksisable, at ligal na ito"
Sunshine,2847,16,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,"pero sa lagay ng bansa natin ngayon, mukhang wala pa tayo sa kalingkingan ng pagsasabatas nito dahil tila mangmang ang mga mambabatas na iniluklok sa pwesto"
Sunshine,2847,17,elijahdareeen,,200.0,ltbx,"malayo pa ang tatahakin ng bawat pilipino sa lipunang patuloy na binubura ang mga progresibo pero ang mga pelikula gaya ng sunshine, ay isa lamang sa maraming paraan upang manghamig, magmulat, at pakilusin ang masang patuloy na inaapi laban sa mapanamantalang sistema na kinalakihan natin"

Sunshine,2849,3,imsupervinn,,200.0,ltbx,But something about this movie pulled me in
Sunshine,2849,4,imsupervinn,,200.0,ltbx,And I’m glad I watched it
Sunshine,2849,5,imsupervinn,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine shook me
Sunshine,2849,6,imsupervinn,,200.0,ltbx,It’s not just a film—it’s a mirror of what’s really happening around us
Sunshine,2849,7,imsupervinn,,200.0,ltbx,"It hit hard, especially thinking about those who’ve gone through abuse—women, children, even the ones who never had the courage to speak up"
Sunshine,2849,8,imsupervinn,,200.0,ltbx,"Sure, there were a few funny scenes—maybe to ease the weight of the story—but the truth behind it stays"
Sunshine,2849,9,imsupervinn,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s heavy, it’s real, and it’s heartbreaking"
Sunshine,2849,10,imsupervinn,,200.0,ltbx,We can’t just look away anymore
Sunshine,2849,11,imsupervinn,,200.0,ltbx,"These kids and young women who’ve lived through this kind of nightmare… they need to be seen, heard, and protected"
Sunshine,2849,12,imsupervinn,,200.0,ltbx,Because maybe—we are their last hope
Sunshine,2849,13,imsupervinn,,200.0,ltbx,And that means something
Sunshine,2850,1,aendru_,,200.0,ltbx,galing tangina
Sunshine,2851,1,_tsbmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,This film truly moved me—it powerfully portrays the harsh reality of the Philippines’ current stance on abortion
Sunshine,2851,2,_tsbmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,The line “gets ko na” struck me deeply; it’s both empowering and eye-opening
Sunshine,2851,3,_tsbmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"Every woman in the country should see this, as it sheds light on the difficult experiences many go through"
Sunshine,2851,4,_tsbmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"The story is raw, relevant and it is worth talking about"
Sunshine,2851,5,_tsbmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,It’s a bold feminist film that reminds us we all sunshine in our own unique ways and we continue to wait for sunshine
Sunshine,2851,6,_tsbmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,Every woman has the right to make decisions about her body and her future
Sunshine,2851,7,_tsbmendoza,,200.0,ltbx,"Thank you so much, Direk Tonet, for creating this important piece"
Sunshine,2852,1,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,Ang husay
Sunshine,2852,2,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,That was my first thought after the credits rolled
Sunshine,2852,3,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,"Every cast member acted so well, but Maris really carried it"
Sunshine,2852,4,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,Nothing felt performed
Sunshine,2852,5,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,"She was just there, fully present in every scene"
Sunshine,2852,6,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,Manila looked exactly how we know it
Sunshine,2852,7,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,"Crowded, humid, alive, and heavy"
Sunshine,2852,8,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,"Sceeenplay wise, it was honest and not trying hard"
Sunshine,2852,9,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,A lot of those lines I’ve heard in real conversations
Sunshine,2852,10,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,It just shows you what it’s like to be a woman in this country with no access to reproductive rights and safe and legal abortion
Sunshine,2852,11,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,I hope Sunshine helps start more open and honest conversations
Sunshine,2852,12,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,Reproductive health is still treated like something dirty in the PH
Sunshine,2852,13,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,"Women suffer quietly, and most people pretend not to see"
Sunshine,2852,14,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,"The story is simple, but the path it takes is so clear"
Sunshine,2852,15,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,"From beginning to end, it doesn’t stray"
Sunshine,2852,16,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,"I was honestly scared it would compromise somewhere along the way, but it didn’t"
Sunshine,2852,17,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,It stayed brave
Sunshine,2852,18,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone, you are so brave"
Sunshine,2852,20,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,It takes guts to make something like this here
Sunshine,2852,21,wydellalie,,180.0,ltbx,"Thank you for telling this story, and for telling it without fear"
Sunshine,2853,1,markdalas,,160.0,ltbx,So much better on second viewing
Sunshine,2854,1,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine sa Kuko ng MaynilaKasama ng mga pelikulang may “maynila” sa titulo na kamakailan ko lang napanood, bukod sa pagpupunit ng bandila ng konserbatibong paniniwala na nagmula sa kristiyanismo, pinapakita din ng Sunshine ang siyudad ng Maynila sa gabi—kung saan imbes na pag-asa, sumpa ang pangunahing kaluluwa na hinihinga’t tinitiis ng mga mamamayan"
Sunshine,2854,2,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa labas ng simbahan makikita ang mga illegal na medesinang pampalaglag na nagsisilbi bilang pagasa para sa maraming kababaihan marahil ang institusyon sa harapan ng mga tindahang ito, ang simbahan, ang may kapangyarihan kahit na sabihing progresibo na ang mga paniniwala ng tao"
Sunshine,2854,3,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa isang eksena, si Sunshine ay nagbuwis buhay sa isang masikip na motel sa Avenida, dala dala ang boteng pampalaglag, nagdudugo, nanghihingalo palabas habang patuloy ang pagtakbo ng LRT, at nagising nalang sa ospital, puno ng mga babaeng tinitiis ang hindi makataong pampublikong pasilidad"
Sunshine,2854,4,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,Halos 500 teenager ang nagiging ina araw araw
Sunshine,2854,5,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Kung legal lamang ang pagpapalaglag, ang mga numerong ito’y mababawasan"
Sunshine,2854,6,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Isa sa may pinaka mabigat na istorya ay ang karakter ni Rhed Bustamante na si Menggay, isang 13 taong gulang na binuntis ng kaniyang tito"
Sunshine,2854,7,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Kaniyang sinusundan si Sunshine at ibang mga babae, upang humingi ng pampalaglag"
Sunshine,2854,8,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,Nililibot niya ang Maynila na may tiyang di nararapat para sa isang dalaga
Sunshine,2854,9,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Tulad ni Sunshine, si Menggay ay pinadala rin sa ospital"
Sunshine,2854,10,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,Ngunit di natin siyang nakitang gumising
Sunshine,2854,11,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang pelikula ni Jadaone ay paniguradong titignan ng mga iskolar bilang “classic” makalipas ang ilang taon, tulad ng Manila by Night at Maynila Sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag"
Sunshine,2854,12,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,Isa sa mga susi ng pagtatagumpay ng storyang ito ay naiintindihan nito ang mga karakter na kinekwento bilang mga tao at hindi lamang teksto
Sunshine,2854,13,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,Madaling tapusin ang mga pelikulang may realismo sa trahedya ngunit hindi pinili ni Jadaone ang direksyong iyon
Sunshine,2854,14,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang titulong “Sunshine” ay sumisimbolo rin sa diwa ng Pilipino—madalas masiyahin at nakakahanap pa rin ng ilaw sa madidilim na eskenita, matatatag (o resilient)"
Sunshine,2854,15,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Dahil tayo’y kilala sa ganitong paraan, madali tayong abusuhin ng ating gobyerno"
Sunshine,2854,16,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Labag raw sa batas ng diyos ang pagpapalaglag ng bata ngunit sa ganitong pagiisip, sa pagproprotekta ng mga hindi pa naisisilang, pinapatay ang ating mga kababaihan"
Sunshine,2854,17,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Ngunit isa sa mga ipinakita sa pelikulang ito ay ang mga babae na nakikiramay kay Sunshine, kahit man ito’y makulit na bata, o kapatid na nagsilbing nanay, o kahit mga babae sa post maternal ward na nakakaintindi ng sakit na nadarama ng karakter ni Maris Racal at ang mga Sunshine sa Pilipinas"
Sunshine,2854,18,lesquatrecoups,,200.0,ltbx,"Mahaba pa ang magiging lakbay patungo sa bansang kayang tumanggap na isang karapatan ng babae ang awtonomiya ng kaniyang katawan, ngunit sa pelikulang ito, at sa pagdami ng mga manonood, nagkakaroon ng espayo upang magbukas ang mga usaping tinuturing “taboo”"
Sunshine,2855,1,ex0ej,,180.0,ltbx,"tight hugs, for all of the sunshines out there"
Sunshine,2856,1,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,This is the kind of film I want to see
Sunshine,2856,2,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"I had huge expectations for this movie before I came to the theater to watch it, and it did not at all disappoint"
Sunshine,2856,3,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"It didn’t, in any way, fall short of anything I hoped for"
Sunshine,2856,4,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"From the direction to the casting, sobrang ganda… and I wish I were exaggerating"
Sunshine,2856,5,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"Una, Antoinette Jadaone, what a director you are"
Sunshine,2856,6,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"Throughout the movie, the words “Ang galing” kept escaping my mouth"
Sunshine,2856,7,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"The camera angles were beautiful, the timing of the sound production was marvelous, the screenplay was solid—everything was on point"
Sunshine,2856,8,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine satisfied my standards for aesthetics when it comes to film
Sunshine,2856,9,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"Pangalawa, Maris"
Sunshine,2856,10,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,Hands down—sobrang talentadong babae talaga
Sunshine,2856,11,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"Setting her issue aside, she’s a versatile actress"
Sunshine,2856,12,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,She embodied Sunshine so well that I felt myself completely absorbed in the story
Sunshine,2856,13,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"Dagdag pa riyan si Jennica Garcia, another golden star"
Sunshine,2856,14,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"I knew her through Saving Grace, and doon pa lang, sobrang namangha na ako sa kakayahan niya"
Sunshine,2856,15,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,I need to see her in more films
Sunshine,2856,16,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,Halos lahat naman kung tutuusin—they have done a tremendous job with their performances
Sunshine,2856,17,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,Everything felt so real
Sunshine,2856,18,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"Pangatlo, the script"
Sunshine,2856,20,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,Ang natural
Sunshine,2856,21,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"It wasn’t like her other directed movie, Uninvited, na puro mura"
Sunshine,2856,22,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"This time, it was profanity with purpose"
Sunshine,2856,23,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,(haha) The lines were written and delivered so well that it made me stop and think how observing plays such a vital role in every profession
Sunshine,2856,24,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,Lalo na rito
Sunshine,2856,25,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"Kaya tagos sa puso, kasi totoo"
Sunshine,2856,26,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,Nangyayari ‘to
Sunshine,2856,27,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"At panghuli, the hidden message"
Sunshine,2856,28,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"In every movie, I like to believe that there’s at least a little advocacy screaming through every minute"
Sunshine,2856,29,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"In this case, it’s the consideration of legalizing abortion in the Philippines"
Sunshine,2856,30,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"Maraming mga hindi kayang bumuhay ng anak, mga hindi kayang sustentahan ang isang tao, at mga taong sinamantala lamang"
Sunshine,2856,31,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"Even with these reasons, is it still not right to consider abortion"
Sunshine,2856,32,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"One might counter, “Pwede mo namang ipaalaga sa kamag-anak o sa mga magulang"
Sunshine,2856,33,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,” But the truth is: life is much more complex than that
Sunshine,2856,34,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"It is so much more complicated because there are cases like this in real life, where the only family they have is their siblings"
Sunshine,2856,35,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,Some only have themselves
Sunshine,2856,36,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"…Hays, basta abstinence talaga dapat guys"
Sunshine,2856,37,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,I love everything about this movie
Sunshine,2856,38,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,I love how it depicts the reality some pregnant teenagers go through—even those who have dreams
Sunshine,2856,39,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,"I believe I have more to say, but I’d like to reflect on that myself"
Sunshine,2856,40,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,Just keep a bit of Sunshine all to me
Sunshine,2856,41,reabanana,,200.0,ltbx,That's how deeply it hit me
Sunshine,2857,1,siomairights,,180.0,ltbx,this is insiang’s (1976) gen z daughteredit: CANT LEAVE WO TALKING ABOUT JENNICA GARCIA sorry sobrang crush ko sya since idk grabe sISTEREDand si rhed bustamante huhuhuhu ang husay husay mo sa role
Sunshine,2858,1,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,late na review kasi putangina ang tagal nitong nasa isip ko pagkatapos naming panoorin
Sunshine,2858,2,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,ngayon lang ulit ako nakakita ng ganito ka-grounded at ka-totoong portrayal ng totoong maynila sa contemporary philippine cinema
Sunshine,2858,3,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"madalas kasi sa mapapanood mo ngayon ay kung hindi pinapaganda, nagiging palamuti lang o para bang wala lang talagang papel yung maynilang ginagalawan ng mga karakter ng pelikula"
Sunshine,2858,4,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"pero dito sa maynila ni tonet jadaone, kita, at rinig mo lahat"
Sunshine,2858,5,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"siguro isa pang dahilan kung bakit malakas tama sa'kin nito kasi ito yung mga naririnig ko araw-araw: yung napakaingay na tunog ng lrt, yung mga jeep na sasabog na sa lakas ng tugtog (kahit music taste ko naman yung mga kanta xD), at yung samu't-saring mga usapan ng mga taong kagaya mo na naglalakad sa maynila"
Sunshine,2858,6,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,sobrang ingat din ng pagkaka-handle sa isyu ng abortion at women's healthcare in general
Sunshine,2858,7,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"walang pananaw na nilagay sa ""bad light,"" pero may reyalidad na ipinakita at ipinaintindi, ang reyalidad ng mga babaeng katulad ni sunshine"
Sunshine,2858,8,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"ang ganda rin na hindi lang reaktib si sunshine sa mga nangyayari sa kanya, meron siyang sariling pangarap, meron siyang sariling desisyon, at meron siyang gagawin sa mga problema niya kahit na para bang lahat ng nakapalibot sa kanya ay pursigidong kontrolin ang buhay niya o diktahan ito nang naaayon sa kagustuhan nila"
Sunshine,2858,9,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"maganda yung pelikula, oo, pero para sa'kin, mas may bigat ang kahalagahan nito: sobrang laki ng magiging (at nagiging) papel nito upang magpatuloy ang diskurso sa isyu ng women's rights, abortion, at women's bodily autonomy sa lahat ng lebel ng lipunan"
Sunshine,2858,10,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"hindi man ito ang puno't-dulo ng usapin, masasabi kong isa ito sa mga may kakayahang magtulak ng lipunan natin sa tamang landas"
Sunshine,2858,11,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,"salamat, direk tonet at salamat, sunshine"
Sunshine,2858,12,mauricelleson,,,ltbx,sana magets na nilang lahat
Sunshine,2859,1,lsvnct,,200.0,ltbx,"award winning movie of maris racal, after watching the film and the interviews—ang daming realizations"
Sunshine,2859,2,lsvnct,,200.0,ltbx,"dito mo masasabing eto ang realidad ng pilipinas, gaano kapoor ang healthcare system, may iilang scenes na walang linya ngunit ingay lang ng paligid ang maririnig mo"
Sunshine,2859,3,lsvnct,,200.0,ltbx,"lahat ng emosyon nalalabas talaga bawat luha, sigaw, mura ramdam mo kay sunshine"
Sunshine,2859,4,lsvnct,,200.0,ltbx,"its not just about of gymnast with a dream, its a dream of a young girl talaga"
Sunshine,2859,5,lsvnct,,200.0,ltbx,its not just about her dream or career
Sunshine,2859,6,lsvnct,,200.0,ltbx,"its about public health, teenage pregnancy, catholic guilt, lack of sex education at choices ng mga kababaihan"
Sunshine,2859,7,lsvnct,,200.0,ltbx,"sobrang relevant, ang tapang, its raw"
Sunshine,2859,8,lsvnct,,200.0,ltbx,"susuportahan ang pelikulang pilipino, mabuhay ang mga pilipino"
Sunshine,2860,1,cassiaren,,,ltbx,i was so happy to have both of the girls alive and child free at the end of the movie
Sunshine,2861,1,sxintg,,200.0,ltbx,"yis galing tainafound myself tearing up a little bit, even though i was only watching i felt how helpless she is, scrolling and finding answers, it is a sensitive topic but needs to be talked about and they did a great job of telling the story -love how the setting and the cinematography also helped in building up the story, damang-dama mo how chaotic manila is, its been a while since i watched a movie on-site and i could say it was really worth it :)"

Sunshine,2862,15,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Tahimik pero mabangis
Sunshine,2862,16,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi ito yung tipo ng pelikula na sasabihin sa’yo kung ano ang tama o mali
Sunshine,2862,17,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Ipapakita lang niya tapos bahala ka sa internal crisis mo after
Sunshine,2862,18,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,May bits na parang sinaksak ka sa puso pero may ngiti ka pa rin sa labi

Sunshine,2862,33,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Yung tipong mapapaisip ka: “Shit
Sunshine,2862,34,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Ako ba ‘yung pinatatamaan
Sunshine,2862,35,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,"” Oo, bes"
Sunshine,2862,36,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Tayong lahat
Sunshine,2862,37,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Kasi lahat tayo may ambag sa double standards na tinotolerate natin araw-araw
Sunshine,2862,38,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi ito ‘yung tipong pelikulang minadali
Sunshine,2862,39,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is crafted, not just created"
Sunshine,2862,40,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi lang siya ginawa para may mapanood
Sunshine,2862,41,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a film that meant something and moved with purpose
Sunshine,2862,42,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi siya sumisigaw ng “tignan mo ako
Sunshine,2862,43,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,” Pero hindi mo rin siya kayang i-ignore
Sunshine,2862,44,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,It sits with you

Sunshine,2862,61,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,Ginawa siyang posibilidad
Sunshine,2862,62,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,"At sana mas dumami pa ang ganitong kwento, yung mga kwentong hindi sinusukat sa sakripisyo kundi sa kalayaan"
Sunshine,2862,63,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,"Yung mga babaeng hindi inaasahang sumunod, kundi tinuturuang magtanong ng: “Ano ba talaga ang gusto ko"

Sunshine,2862,65,dxtrjames,,200.0,ltbx,"”Because at the end of the day, whether it’s about your career, your body, or your future, ikaw dapat ang may final say"

Sunshine,2864,1,leifejohn,,180.0,ltbx,An eye-opener
Sunshine,2864,2,leifejohn,,180.0,ltbx,This is Maris’ best
Sunshine,2865,1,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,to live in a society where your most personal decisions are controlled by external forces and outdated structures… it’s exhausting
Sunshine,2865,2,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"after watching the film today, i found myself deep in thought as i left the cinema"
Sunshine,2865,3,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,it was so real and raw
Sunshine,2865,4,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"like, genuinely, an eye-opener"
Sunshine,2865,5,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"the film just beautifully, but also painfully, shows how interconnected everything is"
Sunshine,2865,6,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"your sex education, or lack thereof, impacts your healthcare system access, your personal moral compass, and of course, your dreams and your passion"
Sunshine,2865,7,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"it really hit home how incredibly hard it is to be a woman especially here in the philippines, with all our deeply ingrained religious beliefs, particularly around topics like abortion"
Sunshine,2865,8,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"it’s just so disheartening to hear all the harsh opinions and these strong pushes for anti-abortion laws, especially when they come from people who aren't personally dealing with those difficult, life-altering situations"
Sunshine,2865,9,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"it’s so easy for some to just state an anti-abortion stance, but the reality for a woman wrestling with such a complex decision is so much more nuanced and personal"
Sunshine,2865,10,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,you hear it all the time: choosing to terminate a pregnancy is selfish
Sunshine,2865,11,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"but then i genuinely wonder, isn't it also selfish to bring a child into the world if you're not fully ready, or if you're uncertain about the future that motherhood brings"
Sunshine,2865,12,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"in a country that can be so conservative, we really, really need a broader, more compassionate discussion"
Sunshine,2865,13,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"we need to figure out how to support women and their choices, whatever they may be"
Sunshine,2865,14,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,not all women want to be mothers
Sunshine,2865,15,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,not all women want to be impregnated
Sunshine,2865,16,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"even i, personally, don't want to be a mother"
Sunshine,2865,17,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,and that's okay
Sunshine,2865,18,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"it’s time we should be open to talking about these topics, really opening up our minds, and stop letting our religious beliefs completely go into our way of empathy and understanding"
Sunshine,2865,19,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,this movie just amplified that for me
Sunshine,2865,20,maestaels,,180.0,ltbx,"ang galing galing mo, maris"
Sunshine,2866,1,marahuyo,,200.0,ltbx,"an anecdote that nobody asked for: i vividly remember my sixth grade homeroom class, sinabihan kami ng adviser namin na mali magpalaglag, kasi “hindi mo matatama ang isang pagkakamali sa paggawa ng isa pang pagkakamali”"
Sunshine,2866,2,marahuyo,,200.0,ltbx,it’s been engrained in our heads and taught to us that abortion is wrong
Sunshine,2866,3,marahuyo,,200.0,ltbx,"i didn’t even have the time back then to question it kasi ‘yun yung sinasabi ng lahat ng adults around me, and eto na yung tinuturo sa atin even at a young age"
Sunshine,2866,4,marahuyo,,200.0,ltbx,"having a film like Sunshine is so important, it sparks a conversation that we couldn’t have before because it was such a taboo topic"
Sunshine,2866,5,marahuyo,,200.0,ltbx,separate na character ang maynila sa pelikulang ‘to
Sunshine,2866,6,marahuyo,,200.0,ltbx,"ramdam ko kasama ko rin si sunshine na naglalakad pa-quiapo also te sobrang affected talaga ako sa scenes with maris and jennica like GRABE LANG… the scene sa taxi when sunshine was leaning on her big sister, wala pa silang sinasabi tumutulo na luha ko"
Sunshine,2866,7,marahuyo,,200.0,ltbx,"pati nung tinabihan ni jennica si maris sa kama, the sisterly bond was something i didn’t see coming kuhang kuha talaga ako watched this in cinemas with my tita, who’s like a mother to me"
Sunshine,2866,8,marahuyo,,200.0,ltbx,it meant a lot that i got to experience it with her :)
Sunshine,2867,1,gaeguli,,200.0,ltbx,"at dahil diyan, eto ang score mo"
Sunshine,2868,1,vonaerys,,200.0,ltbx,"wait walang tumatayo sa sinehan lahat umiiyak alas onse na ng hating gabi edit: ok so nakauwi na ko and here’s my mantra throughout the film: MARIS YOURE A STAR, YOURE A STAR MARIS YOURE A STAR"
Sunshine,2868,2,vonaerys,,200.0,ltbx,hindi ko inexpect na ganon kalala yung effect sa akin nung pelikula
Sunshine,2868,3,vonaerys,,200.0,ltbx,grabeng emosyon
Sunshine,2868,4,vonaerys,,200.0,ltbx,"kuhang kuha mo ko direk, kuhang kuha mo ‘ko"
Sunshine,2868,5,vonaerys,,200.0,ltbx,kuhang kuha ni direk yung repleksyon mula sa lipunang kung saan ang kababaihan ay walang pasya sa kanilang buhay
Sunshine,2868,6,vonaerys,,200.0,ltbx,"kuhang kuha ni elijah canlas (at ni papa p putangina lahat kami nagulat ANG GUWAPO TALAGA, tsaka yung lecheng doctor) ang pika ko, hipocrisy ng mga kristyano"
Sunshine,2868,7,vonaerys,,200.0,ltbx,at syempre si maris
Sunshine,2868,8,vonaerys,,200.0,ltbx,masyadong ginalingan ni maris
Sunshine,2868,9,vonaerys,,200.0,ltbx,MARIS YOURE A STAR YOURE A STAR

Sunshine,2870,1,dprvern,,200.0,ltbx,such an immersive experience that i too was stressed the whole time while watching  and when i tell you the collective gasp in the cinema when papa p came on  i think that was the only time i got to catch my breath but that also did not last long  such an important story to tell that was handled with so much care
Sunshine,2870,2,dprvern,,200.0,ltbx,im so glad this film exists
Sunshine,2871,1,paureviews,,200.0,ltbx,I was speechless after the film
Sunshine,2871,2,paureviews,,200.0,ltbx,"I was actually nervous as I watched this together with my mom and aunt knowing their religious stance, but was amazed that I got a positive outlook on the movie from them"
Sunshine,2871,3,paureviews,,200.0,ltbx,"First off, Maris Racal's portrayal of Sunshine is so good"
Sunshine,2871,4,paureviews,,200.0,ltbx,"Everything was perfect — the set, the cast, and the story itself"
Sunshine,2871,5,paureviews,,200.0,ltbx,The film did not just tackle teenage pregnancy; it also bravely portrayed the two sides of the story of women…
Sunshine,2872,1,iram,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang pinakanagustuhan ko sa Sunshine ay yung tapat na kwinento ang karanasan ng mga kababaihan, lalo na ng mga batang babae, sa bulok na healthcare dito sa Pilipinas na hindi tayo binibigyan ng kalayaan para makapili"
Sunshine,2872,2,iram,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi ito paligoy-ligoy, at ang galing ni Maris sa kanyang ginampanan na papel bilang bida - na mas lalo ko pang naappreciate dahil sa pagparticipate nya sa pagkausap ng mga babaeng nakaranas nito sa realidad"
Sunshine,2872,3,iram,,200.0,ltbx,Sana marami pang makanood nito
Sunshine,2872,4,iram,,200.0,ltbx,"Sana, balang araw, may kalayaan na ang mga Sunshine sa Pilipinas para makapili at maalagaan ng sistemang may pakialam"
Sunshine,2873,1,cathcathcath,,180.0,ltbx,a real horror film for every filipina who starts to have their period
Sunshine,2874,1,sadiesss,,200.0,ltbx,"This movie hunts me in every way, I hope I was there for my sister when she was sunshine, THE GUILT"
Sunshine,2875,1,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,"although i already knew what the premise of the movie was, sobrang emotional pa rin nung dating nung intro sakin"
Sunshine,2875,2,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,"it opened with Sunshine performing her gymnastics routine almost flawlessly tapos maya-maya, it was immediately revealed that she was pregnant"
Sunshine,2875,3,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,knowing all this beforehand didn't lessen the impact of the intro scene for me - my heart broke for her all the same
Sunshine,2875,4,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,living in an extremely conservative country with an extremely poor healthcare system is a nightmare especially for people like Sunshine
Sunshine,2875,5,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,where the only choices are to carry on with the pregnancy or risk going through an unsafe abortion - she will get judged either way
Sunshine,2875,6,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,another thing that i liked was the kid's character
Sunshine,2875,7,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,she can be interpreted in many ways - some say she is Sunshine's what if but i interpreted her as Sunshine's conscience
Sunshine,2875,8,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,"in the early parts of the movie, she was discouraging Sunshine from going through with her plan but eventually came at peace with Sunshine's decisions by the end of the movie"
Sunshine,2875,9,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,"for me, she was also a manifestation of Catholic guilt - something that most of us carry since we grew up in a religious country"
Sunshine,2875,10,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,the things she says to Sunshine is exactly the kind of thoughts you would think of when deciding on something that is against the principles you grew up with
Sunshine,2875,11,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,"surely, this movie will become something that starts a discussion on the sensitive topics it tackled - para sa mga taong nagdadawang-isip pa sa pagiging pro-choice, sa mga taong sinsubukang intindihin yung mga pro-choice, at para sa mga taong katulad ni Sunshine"
Sunshine,2875,12,sushic,,160.0,ltbx,i just hope that people with more conservative views can watch this para naman maintindihan nila yung point ng mga nasa kabilang side ng diskursong ito
Sunshine,2876,1,niklaussiaa,,200.0,ltbx,they should hang this in the louvre

Sunshine,2878,4,dinyokogets,,200.0,ltbx,"sunshine is emotionally poignant, it's silly moments are all-too familiar yet so are its scenes of desperation and sadness (and looking to tiktok for [redacted] lol)"
Sunshine,2878,5,dinyokogets,,200.0,ltbx,"sobbed all the way through that ending man, what a movie"
Sunshine,2879,1,mixd_chrctr,,180.0,ltbx,"In a nutshell, this film reflects how us, as a nation, often fail to protect our own people, because of deeply rooted religious beliefs that act like invisible strings pulling us away from real progress"
Sunshine,2879,2,mixd_chrctr,,180.0,ltbx,"It exposes the irony of our society, which openly profess religiosity, yet we secretly tolerate and practice things that contradict those beliefs"
Sunshine,2879,3,mixd_chrctr,,180.0,ltbx,"Using Quiapo, Manila as the backdrop of the movie is really perfect, because the place embodies the chaos, contradictions, and disorganization that mirror…"

Sunshine,2883,2,andromedanny,,140.0,ltbx,"i'm really glad that we're taking this seriously in philippine media, lalo na't tinatakot tayo ng mga religious groups"
Sunshine,2883,3,andromedanny,,140.0,ltbx,"also, incredible acting from maris and jenica"
Sunshine,2883,4,andromedanny,,140.0,ltbx,nanghinayang lang ako sa paggamit ng dalawang imaginary na bata to spoonfeed the audience
Sunshine,2883,5,andromedanny,,140.0,ltbx,mas nabigyan ng emphasis yung buhay nung dalawa kaysa kay maris at sa kaibigan niya

Sunshine,2888,5,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,"”These words pierce through the screen because they echo the confusion and helplessness felt by so many young women who were never taught what to do, only what not to become"
Sunshine,2888,6,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,"The film refuses to sensationalize and instead, it exposes how a girl’s so-called mistake (often rooted not in her choices but in a partner’s negligence or acts of abuse) can lead to an avalanche of lost dreams, happiness, and possibility"
Sunshine,2888,7,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine becomes every girl who was failed by sex education, every young woman silenced by stigma, and every teenager blamed instead of held"
Sunshine,2888,8,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,Running beneath the narrative is a critique of the Philippine healthcare system
Sunshine,2888,9,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine does not receive proper maternal support

Sunshine,2888,17,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,What I find striking is how the film threads the idea of stigma into the structure itself
Sunshine,2888,18,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,It’s the system
Sunshine,2888,19,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,"How fear, silence, and judgment strip away any chance for recovery, much less dignity"
Sunshine,2888,20,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,And this is where Sunshine dares to challenge its viewers
Sunshine,2888,21,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,The existence of this movie forces a confrontation
Sunshine,2888,22,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine doesn’t preach, but it demands to be seen"
Sunshine,2888,23,yvonnelouise,,180.0,ltbx,It tells the story of a girl who chose herself

Sunshine,2892,1,mikyllah,,200.0,ltbx,"this film is so real—nakita ko sa bawat lugar na pinupuntahan ni Sunshine kung gaano kahirap maghanap ng pag-asa sa bawat masisikip at maiingay na busina ng mga sasakyan, sa bawat bigat ng hakbang, luha, at layo ng nilalakad niya sa kahabaan ng maynila, at sa unang pag-apak niya ng quiapo; ang una niyang ginawa ay humingi ng tawad kahit wala naman siyang kasalanan"

Sunshine,2893,2,jokenkenar,,200.0,ltbx,She deserves a Gawad Urian for Best Actress category
Sunshine,2894,1,jaimais_vu,,180.0,ltbx,“Naiintindihan mo na ba ako
Sunshine,2894,2,jaimais_vu,,180.0,ltbx,”That's how she basically ended that chapter
Sunshine,2894,3,jaimais_vu,,180.0,ltbx,"She’s aware sa ginawa niya, hindi niya kailangan pagsabihan pa siya na yung mga ginawa niya was wrong, illegal, or malaking kasalanan etc"
Sunshine,2894,4,jaimais_vu,,180.0,ltbx,And she doesn’t even deny that in the film
Sunshine,2894,5,jaimais_vu,,180.0,ltbx,"There were enough reasons laid out throughout the film validates her choice, and you see the life that she leads"
Sunshine,2894,6,jaimais_vu,,180.0,ltbx,The hallucination of her own child is her own manifestation of the guilt that haunts her — which tells you she still has hesitations and ramdam niya yung kahihiyan ng mga desisyon niya
Sunshine,2894,7,jaimais_vu,,180.0,ltbx,You can mourn all you want about the potential of these unborn fetuses that “could’ve” changed our world

Sunshine,2895,3,luwis_ish,,160.0,ltbx,"She brings a natural charm that immediately connects with the audience, and I was genuinely impressed by the depth and nuance of her performance"
Sunshine,2895,4,luwis_ish,,160.0,ltbx,"What makes Sunshine even compelling is its brave exploration of abortion, a topic that’s still heavily stigmatized in the Philippines"
Sunshine,2895,5,luwis_ish,,160.0,ltbx,The film doesn’t…
Sunshine,2896,1,skiddoo,,140.0,ltbx,The script tackles a lot of issues that share deep commentary about our social reality
Sunshine,2896,2,skiddoo,,140.0,ltbx,It's a social realism film with metaphysical personification of guilt and morality as I would call it
Sunshine,2896,3,skiddoo,,140.0,ltbx,"No matter what your political stance is, you can't deny how the script threaded with care and empathy towards women and women's health"
Sunshine,2896,4,skiddoo,,140.0,ltbx,"I'm glad they went for an ambiguous ending because if not, it would've been too preachy and they would alienate or estrange a large group of people, but instead its rhetoric opened up an important topic to debate on"
Sunshine,2896,5,skiddoo,,140.0,ltbx,I actually agree that it's one of the most important Filipino films of modern times and it's Jadaone's strongest work yet
Sunshine,2897,1,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"Para sa isang lipunan kung saan nalilimitihan pa rin ang karapatan ng kababaihan, dadako at dadako ang mga ito sa 'illegal' na paraan para mabawasan ang pasan"
Sunshine,2897,2,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,How couldnt they
Sunshine,2897,3,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"Sa loob ng pelikulang 'Sunshine,' binubuksan nito ang mahirap at hindi napaguusapang diskurso ukol sa karapatan ng kababaihan ayon sa kanilang katawan, aborsyon, guilt, morals, pati na rin ang Sexual abuse/harassment partikular sa mga kabataan o menor de edad"
Sunshine,2897,4,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"At sa kabilang banda naman, napoportray dito yung bond na nabubuo ng mga kababaihan sa loob ng pyudal na lipunan"
Sunshine,2897,5,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"Ilang beses akong naiyak habang nanonood, especially nung scene na ni Maris na nagtake siya ng pampalaglag"
Sunshine,2897,6,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"Ang bigat panoorin nito actually, kasi what do you mean na para mabawi ko yung buhay na mayroon ako before, kailangan kong pumunta ng Quiapo para bumili ng pampalaglag at pagdaanan yung sakit para lang duguin ako ulit"
Sunshine,2897,7,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,Sunod pa ay yung dinala si Rhed sa hospital dahil binuntis siya ng tito niya
Sunshine,2897,8,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,13 lang siya
Sunshine,2897,9,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,Ang mga ganitong klaseng halimbawa ay pinapakita kung gaano ka-devastating yung fact na walang tulong ang narereceive ng mga kababaihan with this kind of situation
Sunshine,2897,10,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"Meron naman siguro, pero mahirap at hindi lahat ay may kakayahang makakuha nitong ""tulong"" na ito dahil halos lahat ay kailangan ng pera"
Sunshine,2897,11,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"Nakaka-mind fuck yung situation ni Rhed (kahit short amount of time lang sha ron s film) kasi sa lipunan natin ngayon, ang daming batang babae ang nabubuntis, at bawat taon, pababa nang pababa ang edad ng mga ito"
Sunshine,2897,12,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"Ngunit, sino ba ang bumubuntis sakanila"
Sunshine,2897,13,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"Ang abortion ay hindi isang paraan upang mag-promote ng sarap sa sex sa mga kabataan;And with films like this, maganda yung na-aacknowledge na may ganitong klaseng pangyayari sa lipunan"
Sunshine,2897,14,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"Pero kagaya ng iba pang pelikula that tackles issues like this ay tulad ng 'Uninvited,' bakit hanggang acknowledge lang"
Sunshine,2897,15,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"Sa role ni Maris bilang Sunshine, pinapakita nito ang journey niya sa loob ng mundong nangguguiltrip and self-devoted Christians, matatanda, etc etc (at napepersonify itong guilt na to through the character of Bata (played by annika)), nakita niya na may mga batang nabubuntis, nakita niya na may judgement agad yung mga tao sa tulad niya, nakita niya na hindi madaling nakakatanggap at nakakahingi ng tulong yung mga nasa sitwasyon niya—pero even after all these, walang self-reflection or closure yung film or yung character ni Sunshine mismo (since first-hand niyang nawitness and naexperience lahat) sa lahat ng issue na naipakita"
Sunshine,2897,16,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,"Parang ""bahala ka na kung ano gusto mo isipin, basta eto yung pinapakita namin"
Sunshine,2897,17,user_archives,,140.0,ltbx,""" Solid 6-7/10"
Sunshine,2898,1,ulamaswang,,80.0,ltbx,It's a rather decent take on the current status of the Philippine status quo on women's health and the healthcare system in general
Sunshine,2898,2,ulamaswang,,80.0,ltbx,Rather a hit and miss for me with the kids being a figure of speech so to speak and that the little kid's dream is also Sunshine's dream being the same but should have been clear that both won't be able to meet as per the dialogues
Sunshine,2898,3,ulamaswang,,80.0,ltbx,"Story-wise, everything somehow fell into place in such a way that all the things that could have been possible in terms of occurrences akin to a deus ex machina of sorts, giving the sense that everything was too good to be true - still, point stands; it's a great film to talk about and amazingly delivers points that we should discuss more of a society, especially when it concerns the lives of women, children, and the difficulties of being a woman in a third world country"
Sunshine,2898,4,ulamaswang,,80.0,ltbx,"<<Objectively, story continuity could have been better which could have convinced me of giving it a higher score"

Sunshine,2900,1,knghnry,,160.0,ltbx,Definitely one of the most important Filipino films of this generation
Sunshine,2901,1,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a bold and compelling story about when passion collides with unforeseen circumstances
Sunshine,2901,2,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,"Delivering a powerful performance, Maris Racal gives light to Sunshine, a bright and hopeful teen gymnast whose Olympic dreams come crashing down after an unplanned pregnancy"
Sunshine,2901,3,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,"While the film is beautiful aesthetically, it’s also dark and grim as it not only deals with a controversial subject matter, but is also an accurate reflection of Philippine culture and society"
Sunshine,2901,4,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,I love stories that involve moral dillemas — stories that make the character choose between two conflicting moral values
Sunshine,2901,5,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,"This is the case for Sunshine, whose choice is either to abort her baby to reach her Olympic dream, a goal she’s dreamt of in years; or keep the baby as this is deemed the morally right thing to do"
Sunshine,2901,6,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,"Set in the Philippine context, one of the most religious countries in the world, that is one of the hardest dilemmas to have, and I thought the film gave justice to what Maris’ character had to go through"
Sunshine,2901,7,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,Maris deserves her props for this as well
Sunshine,2901,8,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,"She was an acting powerhouse, delivering and making the audience feel everything she was going through right out of the screen"
Sunshine,2901,9,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,"It seemed like she trained legitimately for all the stunts, too"
Sunshine,2901,10,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,All these efforts made the film much more impactful and grounded
Sunshine,2901,11,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,"Visually, this is what I imagined the City of Manila is like on film"
Sunshine,2901,12,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,"The city, while beautiful to look at, lying beneath it feels like a sense of grime and moral corruption, which blended well with the film’s theme"
Sunshine,2901,13,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,"But aside from a couple of narrative choices made, I really liked this film"
Sunshine,2901,14,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine, while beautiful, is also a haunting reminder of the everyday struggle of the common Filipino"
Sunshine,2901,15,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,A Filipino who has goals and dreams but is blindsided by forces beyond their control but chooses to push through
Sunshine,2901,16,jellobee,,180.0,ltbx,It’s an empowering film that I think will leave its mark for years to come
Sunshine,2902,1,nosfw,,180.0,ltbx,"Every choice in cinematography, production, writing, etc"
Sunshine,2902,2,nosfw,,180.0,ltbx,feels all so delicately planned together to build itself into a single cohesive message on the state of reproductive health in the Philippines
Sunshine,2902,3,nosfw,,180.0,ltbx,"Even just the choice of Sunshine being a gymnast- a sport that is known to affect women's menstrual cycles, which explains why Sunshine didn't consider pregnancy in the first place- proves the care and attention direk Tonet placed on every aspect of the film"
Sunshine,2902,4,nosfw,,180.0,ltbx,"The ending however, did leave me to wish more in terms of understanding the aftermath of Sunshine's abortion"
Sunshine,2902,5,nosfw,,180.0,ltbx,Filipino society's marites culture and religious evangelism no less is bound to have an effect on Sunshine's life and that was something I wished to see her persevere through post-abortion
Sunshine,2902,6,nosfw,,180.0,ltbx,"but I do also respect the need to end Sunshine's story on a more hopeful note, as that message of sheer hope and optimism is probably more important than portraying an already familiar reality"
Sunshine,2903,1,telegraphclub,,180.0,ltbx,maris racal didn’t mother (literally)anyway i really like how sunshine knows what she wants to do with the child because of her dreams

Sunshine,2907,1,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"For Every Woman (Para sa bawat Babae) It’s hard to fully grasp what women go through in our society, what more if you’re living in a country like the Philippines, where there aren’t enough laws to protect women’s rights"
Sunshine,2907,2,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"This movie is a wake-up call, an eye-opener, a voice for the voiceless women"
Sunshine,2907,3,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"It sheds light on major issues we often sweep under the rug like, sexual assault, teenage pregnancy, public healthcare, poverty, child abuse, and most especially, abortion"

Sunshine,2907,10,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,Maris Racal completely embodied Sunshine
Sunshine,2907,11,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"It wasn’t Maris I saw on screen, it was Sunshine"
Sunshine,2907,12,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"I know she’s getting a lot of praise for her impeccable, flawless acting here, and she absolutely deserves it"
Sunshine,2907,13,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,But let me also talk about Annika Co and Jennica Garcia
Sunshine,2907,14,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,Annika was incredible in this film
Sunshine,2907,15,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"From funny to irritating to heartbreaking, she nailed every single scene"

Sunshine,2907,17,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,And Jennica Garcia
Sunshine,2907,18,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"Her eyes, that “mata-mata acting”"
Sunshine,2907,19,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"In one confrontation scene where she barely had lines, her eyes told the whole story, you could feel out of the screen that she’d do anything for Sunshine"
Sunshine,2907,20,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,She’s the older sister we all deserve
Sunshine,2907,21,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"And the rest of the cast, Elijah Canlas, Xyriel Manabat, Meryll Soriano, Ar-Yuh-Nuh (JM), Rhed Bustamante and the others"

Sunshine,2907,26,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,It almost feels like a documentary film type
Sunshine,2907,27,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"From the gritty shots of Manila’s streets to the realness of the lines, these are the same things we hear in actual situations like this"
Sunshine,2907,28,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,The script cuts deep
Sunshine,2907,29,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"The weight of each line… it’s crushing, full of heavy emotions"
Sunshine,2907,30,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"Major kudos to Direk Antoinette Jadaone for creating films that reflect the harsh realities of life in the Philippines, especially the realities that women face, the never-ending battle against a society that dictates what a woman should do with her body, the shame, the guilt, and the silence they’re forced to carry"
Sunshine,2907,31,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"I hope more films like this are made, films like Pamilya Ordinaryo, Birdshot, and now, this"
Sunshine,2907,32,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,This film deserves AWARDS
Sunshine,2907,33,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"I’m also amazed by the cinematography, the color grading, the symbolism of the two children, the sound (especially the NATSOT from Manila, ang lala beh, it really adds so much depth to every scene)"
Sunshine,2907,34,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"This movie will make you laugh, cry, and feel pain"
Sunshine,2907,35,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"But above all, it stirs the mind and hits the heart, also it carries a message that matters"
Sunshine,2907,36,andyyvill,,180.0,ltbx,"Message that needs to be heard, seen, and acted upon"

Sunshine,2920,1,lexcaliblur,,200.0,ltbx,being pro-choice is not an act of selfishness like what pro lifers make it out to be—it is a plea to be heard by the system and acknowledge the realities of the stigma building more restrictions for women’s freedom

Sunshine,2925,10,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,"and jennica garcia, wow"
Sunshine,2925,11,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,"her portrayal of the older sister felt so grounded and real, like someone you actually know"
Sunshine,2925,12,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,there’s comfort in the way she carries herself
Sunshine,2925,13,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,"gusto mo na lang yakapin ka niya at sabihan ka ng, “kaya mo ‘yan"
Sunshine,2925,14,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,”there’s something about the way the film is made that feels like a quiet throwback
Sunshine,2925,15,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,may brocka feels pero hindi pilit
Sunshine,2925,16,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,very grounded in truth
Sunshine,2925,17,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,the quiapo scene especially hit hard
Sunshine,2925,18,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,ganun talaga ang sitwasyon dun
Sunshine,2925,19,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,"like direk tonet said, quiapo is one big irony"
Sunshine,2925,20,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,"magsisimba ka with so much faith, then paglabas mo, you’re faced with desperation and survival"
Sunshine,2925,21,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,it's painful how real that is
Sunshine,2925,22,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,"the film doesn't try to be loud, and i think that’s what makes it more powerful"
Sunshine,2925,23,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,"it reflects the harshness of our society, especially for women who are constantly judged for the choices they make"
Sunshine,2925,24,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,"sunshine isn’t just timely, it’s necessary"
Sunshine,2925,25,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,"in a country that prides itself in morality but refuses to give women full control over their own bodies, this film hits different"
Sunshine,2925,26,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,"it makes you ask, sino ba talaga ang may karapatang pumili"
Sunshine,2925,27,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,sunshine is not just a character
Sunshine,2925,28,aintdrei,,180.0,ltbx,she’s a reality too many are still afraid to look at

Sunshine,2926,9,jamiret,,200.0,ltbx,hindi si sunshine ang problema
Sunshine,2926,10,jamiret,,200.0,ltbx,"ang problema ay ang kawalan ng karapatan nya sa pagpili, kawalan nya ng ahensya sa sariling katawan"
Sunshine,2926,11,jamiret,,200.0,ltbx,"dahil sa gobyernong hindi kayang tugunan ang karapatan ng mga kababaihan, sa relihiyong dumidikta sa pasya ng mga tagasunod, at sa lipunang mapanghusga"
Sunshine,2926,12,jamiret,,200.0,ltbx,mahal ko ang kababaihan ng pelikula
Sunshine,2926,13,jamiret,,200.0,ltbx,"si sunshine, si mary grace, si geleen, si coach eden, si thea, si dra"

Sunshine,2926,15,jamiret,,200.0,ltbx,"malayo-layo pa para sabihing nakuha ng mga lalaki (miggy at bobot) ang parusang karapat-dapat sa kanila, pero pipiliin kong isipin na kumatok din iyon sa pintuan nila"
Sunshine,2926,16,jamiret,,200.0,ltbx,mahal ko ang bata at si ariana

Sunshine,2929,1,filmmecker,,180.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,2930,1,ehfhtl,,180.0,ltbx,this film had me holding back tears on the jeepney ride home
Sunshine,2930,2,ehfhtl,,180.0,ltbx,direk tonet’s vision and storytelling are so brave and well-crafted – and maris brought it all to life
Sunshine,2930,3,ehfhtl,,180.0,ltbx,"(let’s be real, we can’t deny that this girl is one of the best artists of her generation)"
Sunshine,2930,4,ehfhtl,,180.0,ltbx,every actor in this film did so well too
Sunshine,2930,5,ehfhtl,,180.0,ltbx,"whenever jennica’s character cried, i shed a tear as well"
Sunshine,2930,6,ehfhtl,,180.0,ltbx,“drown out the noise” – a line from the film where it simultaneously shows the loud and chaotic streets of manila
Sunshine,2930,7,ehfhtl,,180.0,ltbx,it was so raw and real
Sunshine,2930,8,ehfhtl,,180.0,ltbx,"a perfect snapshot of womanhood in a society that demands resilience from women, yet often judges and shames them for their choices – if they’re even given the choice, to begin with"
Sunshine,2930,9,ehfhtl,,180.0,ltbx,this is a film that every woman (especially those living in the philippines) needs to watch
Sunshine,2930,10,ehfhtl,,180.0,ltbx,mahigpit na yakap para kay sunshine at sa lahat ng kababaihan
Sunshine,2931,1,mightygray,,200.0,ltbx,This was handled with so much care that I was crying cause I was so inspired by it
Sunshine,2931,2,mightygray,,200.0,ltbx,You can tell the director and the whole crew wanted to show the movie in a way that the story would be upfront but respecting the message it was trying to give
Sunshine,2931,3,mightygray,,200.0,ltbx,"The story hits in a way that it really shows you how these events happen in real life that you can look around, and there's people living through it"
Sunshine,2931,4,mightygray,,200.0,ltbx,The question now is when will we be addressing it cause it's been happening for so long
Sunshine,2931,5,mightygray,,200.0,ltbx,How many more lives will suffer from this
Sunshine,2931,6,mightygray,,200.0,ltbx,GIVE WOMEN THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR BODIES
Sunshine,2932,1,dyanphibian,,140.0,ltbx,that one scene with the doctor wearing the cross who kept on making her say thank you triggered a core memory
Sunshine,2933,1,childish_,,180.0,ltbx,gets q
Sunshine,2934,1,ysbl,,,ltbx,whatever the op of the review that i liked said
Sunshine,2934,2,ysbl,,,ltbx,this film had no dull moments
Sunshine,2934,3,ysbl,,,ltbx,very well presented for such a sensitive subject
Sunshine,2934,4,ysbl,,,ltbx,you could feel the heavy atmosphere throughout the whole thing to the point that it almost had me gripping my phone just to hold on to something
Sunshine,2934,5,ysbl,,,ltbx,it's heartbreaking that this is just a glimpse of the reality for many women in this very religious and conservative country
Sunshine,2934,6,ysbl,,,ltbx,"also, i've always seen the resemblance of na hee-do (kim taeri in 2521) and maris"
Sunshine,2934,7,ysbl,,,ltbx,"so seeing maris play an athlete, i got reminded of that again"
Sunshine,2934,9,ysbl,,,ltbx,"with erwin and charledit: and by op, si yani pala yun lmao labyu yani salamat sa review mo"

Sunshine,2936,1,ijuss,,200.0,ltbx,What’s great about this movie is that it’s stance is clear but it’s never aggressive in pushing it
Sunshine,2936,2,ijuss,,200.0,ltbx,It just shows you the situation for what it truly is—sad and cruel
Sunshine,2936,3,ijuss,,200.0,ltbx,"And that at the heart of it all was just empathy, that maybe if we just cared a little bit more then maybe we’d understand"
Sunshine,2937,1,cinericka,,180.0,ltbx,lumabas ako ng sinehan at umuwi sa bahay kagabi na walang iniisip kung hindi itong pelikula lang na 'to

Sunshine,2937,3,cinericka,,180.0,ltbx,literal na naalog ang buong pagkatao ko
Sunshine,2937,4,cinericka,,180.0,ltbx,pero pinaka-tinamaan ako dun sa kalagayan ni mary grace (rhed bustamante)
Sunshine,2937,5,cinericka,,180.0,ltbx,"isang 13 year-old na babae na ginahasa ng sarili niyang tiyuhin at binabansagang walang kwentang ""tomboy"" ng kaniyang nanay"
Sunshine,2937,6,cinericka,,180.0,ltbx,nasasaktan ako para sa bata dahil alam kong maraming kaso ng child sexual abuse at corrective rape sa ating bansa
Sunshine,2937,7,cinericka,,180.0,ltbx,"sa kabila ng maraming pagbabago, nakakagalit na patuloy pa ring umiiral ang patriyarkal na sistema at diskriminasyon sa kababaihan"
Sunshine,2937,8,cinericka,,180.0,ltbx,"totoong mahirap maging babae, ngunit magaang malaman na may mga uri ng sining, gaya ng palabas na ito, na nagbibigay ng boses para sa atin at nagpapakita ng tapang na tumindig para sa isa't-isa"
Sunshine,2937,9,cinericka,,180.0,ltbx,edit: i just realized that not a single man in this film was helpful because the tricycle driver who drove sunshine to the hospital is a lesbian

Sunshine,2943,8,beyswswsw,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa halip, isa itong tahimik pero galit na sigaw sa bansang patuloy na tinuturing ang kababaihan bilang incubator, atleta, o anak—pero hindi bilang ganap na tao"

Sunshine,2965,3,shilami,,200.0,ltbx,Being a woman in a culture shaped by Catholic values often means silencing your own needs to conform and that reality was portrayed so powerfully

Sunshine,2967,6,zndrm,,200.0,ltbx,"rooted for her as she continues to pursue her dreams, regardless of the noise"
Sunshine,2967,7,zndrm,,200.0,ltbx,"maybe, it's okay to try for that dream one more time"
Sunshine,2967,8,zndrm,,200.0,ltbx,such a good movie
Sunshine,2968,1,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,"""Drown out the noise"
Sunshine,2968,2,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,"""I watched this film just hours before I turned twenty (teenage graduate)"
Sunshine,2968,3,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,"After a year of waiting for it to be released here in the Philippines, I can say—it was absolutely worth it"
Sunshine,2968,4,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,What makes it so powerful is its courage to open the conversation about abortion and reproductive health in a deeply religious country like ours
Sunshine,2968,5,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,It doesn't hold back
Sunshine,2968,6,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,"As a society, we need to be more open to the realities women face, and ask ourselves what we can do collectively, especially what the government can and should do"
Sunshine,2968,7,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,"""Mahirap maging babae, lalo na dito sa Pinas"""
Sunshine,2968,8,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,The film is raw and relevant
Sunshine,2968,9,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is real
Sunshine,2968,10,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,"Her character struck a chord, and I saw glimpses of my past classmates and friends in the struggles of Maris Racal and Rhed Bustamante’s roles"
Sunshine,2968,11,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,"The film tackles poor awareness and lack of access to health facilities, while also confronting religious beliefs and cultural norms head-on"
Sunshine,2968,12,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,"It really centers on abortion—not to promote it, but to open the conversation, especially for conservative audiences"
Sunshine,2968,13,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,"It is still a taboo and personally, I hold a progressive stand on abortion, and seeing it presented this way felt affirming"
Sunshine,2968,14,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,"I also loved the use of symbolism—from the “Gift of God” jeepney that Sunshine rides on her way to Quiapo, to her choosing not to enter the church even while seeking God’s guidance"
Sunshine,2968,15,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,Those subtle moments say so much
Sunshine,2968,16,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,I admire how it ends with the strong message that women own their bodies and have the right to choose and decide—whether or not it goes against religious or cultural expectations
Sunshine,2968,17,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,"This film is more than a story, it’s a tool"
Sunshine,2968,18,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,A voice
Sunshine,2968,19,ahearticy,,200.0,ltbx,A reflection of many who share the same experiences as Sunshine

Sunshine,2974,4,megisaurus,,200.0,ltbx,It’s not that I hate children; it’s just that what I see in them are the responsibilities and the lifetime commitment
Sunshine,2974,5,megisaurus,,200.0,ltbx,I see them more as a burden than a blessing
Sunshine,2974,6,megisaurus,,200.0,ltbx,"I can’t be a parent with that kind of perspective—at least, not now or in the near future"
Sunshine,2974,7,megisaurus,,200.0,ltbx,My greatest fear has always been unexpected pregnancy and this film materialized the why behind that fear

Sunshine,2978,5,chicachicachics,,180.0,ltbx,"OKAY PROCESSED, and my dad says it best: they [the direction and the story] make a lot of good choices"
Sunshine,2978,6,chicachicachics,,180.0,ltbx,"as a woman i can’t help but agree with him: direk jadaone takes up all the right angles and approaches in making a film about abortion and safe sex, and when i say right i don’t just mean morally, i also mean rhetorically or symbolically"
Sunshine,2978,7,chicachicachics,,180.0,ltbx,"it’s more pro-life than pro-lifers, in that through the little girl’s presence and role in the movie, it emphasizes that life is more than just birth: it is care, and that care lies in the emotional or mental capacity to do so"
Sunshine,2978,8,chicachicachics,,180.0,ltbx,"i take off a half-star because i feel there could be only a bit more scenes bringing home that point, but in any case the film is deeply moving — and deeply caring for the filipino woman"

Sunshine,2997,1,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is an absolute cinematic gut-punch
Sunshine,2997,2,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine, the titular character played by Maris Racal, is on her way to Olympic glory, her dreams already in the bag"
Sunshine,2997,3,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,It takes a missed period and a couple of pink lines to veer her off-course
Sunshine,2997,4,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,"And just like that, she crashes headlong into a society that’s dead set on denying women their bodily autonomy"
Sunshine,2997,5,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,Racal’s performance is where the film’s soul resides
Sunshine,2997,6,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,She embodies Sunshine with a physicality and emotional depth that’s fully felt from start to finish
Sunshine,2997,7,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,"Her sobs are painful to watch, but she’s given some respite she can hold onto: the comradeship among women"
Sunshine,2997,8,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,"Jennica Garcia’s Geleen, Sunshine’s older sister, is a particular standout"
Sunshine,2997,9,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,"Fittingly, Jadaone is not soft around the edges, and the film is unflinching in its message"
Sunshine,2997,10,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,Yet Sunshine never feels preachy or didactic
Sunshine,2997,11,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,"Because, to be fair, there’s really no neat, easy, and one-size-fits-all resolution for women like Sunshine"
Sunshine,2997,12,rainiersulla,,200.0,ltbx,"But ultimately, it does pull back the curtain and invites you into a conversation, rather than passing judgment"

Sunshine,2998,5,maxenne,,200.0,ltbx,"not knowing na yung problema ni Sunshine will long outlive her dream, and will likely stay with her for the rest of her life"
Sunshine,2998,6,maxenne,,200.0,ltbx,hindi humingi si Sunshine ng opinyon sa mga tao sa paligid niya
Sunshine,2998,7,maxenne,,200.0,ltbx,"bago pa niya sabihin sa iba, alam na niya yung desisyon niya"
Sunshine,2998,8,maxenne,,200.0,ltbx,"she didn’t need anyone to ‘talk her out of it’, she only asked for their understanding"
Sunshine,2998,9,maxenne,,200.0,ltbx,yun lang naman talaga hinihiling ng mga babaeng katulad ni Sunshine
Sunshine,2998,10,maxenne,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi naman nila sinasabing gawin mo, gusto lang nilang maintindihan mo kung bakit nila ‘to ginagawa"
Sunshine,2998,11,maxenne,,200.0,ltbx,"kasi wala naman silang choice, at hindi sila binibigyan ng choice ng bansang ‘to, at ng mga outdated beliefs nito"
Sunshine,2998,12,maxenne,,200.0,ltbx,"nakakalungkot isipin kung ilang babae na ang dumaan sa paghihirap at sakit na pinagdaanan din ni Sunshine dahil lang kinicriminalize ng batas at simbahan ang abortion, kaya ito nagiging unsafe"
Sunshine,2998,13,maxenne,,200.0,ltbx,"at mas lalong nakakalungkot isipin kung ilang babae na rin yung nakaranas ng paghihirap na pinagdadaanan ng mga nanay, kahit hindi naman nila ‘to ginusto"
Sunshine,2998,14,maxenne,,200.0,ltbx,ewan wala na ‘ko masabi basta naiyak ako sa kwento ni Sunshine at sobrang nag eempathize ako sakanya kasi nakikita ko sakanya yung kaibigan ko
Sunshine,2998,15,maxenne,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine represents all the women who dream big and are unapologetically true to themselves

Sunshine,2999,3,yvesiendo,,160.0,ltbx,probably my favorite scenes aesthetically because it sets the mood of an isolating society for women but a mix with the light of hope
Sunshine,2999,4,yvesiendo,,160.0,ltbx,the addition of the “future” children was pretty clever and adds a witty touch of when people say what if your aborted child becomes this
Sunshine,2999,5,yvesiendo,,160.0,ltbx,it’s truly a women-centric film that we barely had a few seconds without the titular sunshine
Sunshine,2999,6,yvesiendo,,160.0,ltbx,i love the grit mixed with wittiness— which i think are the quintessential qualities of filipino films
Sunshine,2999,7,yvesiendo,,160.0,ltbx,maybe im greedy but i wish we could’ve gotten more of how sunshine overcame the pregnancy and not just a “girl who is going to be okay” scene
Sunshine,2999,8,yvesiendo,,160.0,ltbx,"if they were gonna represent the struggles of women, possibly be the face of a movement, and be “gritty,” they should’ve went all the way"
Sunshine,2999,9,yvesiendo,,160.0,ltbx,it just felt incomplete and leaves an unsatisfying feeling that we are still stuck (which is true but i wanted more

Sunshine,3001,4,erofebsunrise,,160.0,ltbx,"My mother, who is a senior, didnt catch that part"

Sunshine,3003,4,kikinilaw,,200.0,ltbx,"walang paligoy-ligoy, walang unnecessary plots or twists—literal na sinasamahan lang natin ang isang babae na magkusang kumapit sa patalim, sa kamatayan para lang matupad ang kanyang pinapangarap"
Sunshine,3003,5,kikinilaw,,200.0,ltbx,"mahirap siyang i-digest in a sense that kahit alam naman na natin kung ano mga mangyayari, hinding-hindi tayo magiging si sunshine"
Sunshine,3003,6,kikinilaw,,200.0,ltbx,"seeing her go through hell (that is this god-forsaken country), you could never really know gaano kabigat ang dinadala niya"

Sunshine,3025,2,invyctus06,,120.0,ltbx,"I don’t think it’s worth the hype that it’s getting, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s not a good movie"
Sunshine,3025,3,invyctus06,,120.0,ltbx,It doesn’t have a resolution nor does the message really sticks it landing
Sunshine,3025,4,invyctus06,,120.0,ltbx,"It is however, simply a story told that is based on the bits and pieces of reality that we can only conceive"
Sunshine,3025,5,invyctus06,,120.0,ltbx,"It’s a conversation starter, but its certainly does not explore much of the topic that its centered on"
Sunshine,3025,6,invyctus06,,120.0,ltbx,"So much so that the film doesn’t really let you grow to care about the Protagonist’s support system, thus their presence, their wisdom and their comfort, falls flat in terms of having and relevance to you"
Sunshine,3025,7,invyctus06,,120.0,ltbx,"There are moments wherein I enjoyed the humor, but you can only do so much with curse words in dialogues that it starts to sound like Daryl Yap’s films, the only difference here is that it handled a topic that’s taboo and has managed to deliver its point across, however at the expense of being safe enough to be told, but less poignant and thought provoking to be considered as something to be discussed in depth"

Sunshine,3027,6,fallenexp,,160.0,ltbx,SUNSHINE is straightforward to its message
Sunshine,3027,7,fallenexp,,160.0,ltbx,It's about dealing with abortion in a country where not only is illegal but also discriminated hardly

Sunshine,3027,16,fallenexp,,160.0,ltbx,"For that, it's already a big win for independent Filipino cinema as theaters flock and raise the demand"

Sunshine,3033,2,aj1t,,,ltbx,Batid ng pelikula na ang karapatan sa aborsyon ang tanging daan ng bidang si Sunshine Francisco tungo sa kanyang pangarap na makalundag sa Olympics
Sunshine,3033,3,aj1t,,,ltbx,"Ngunit sa paglalarawan sa paghihirap ni Sunshine bilang isang abstraksiyong siya lamang ang humaharap, naisantabi ang pagkakataong maging paanyaya ang pelikula upang bulatlatin ang panlipunang estruktura sa likod ng kanyang pagdurusa"

Sunshine,3060,12,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,our children deserves better
Sunshine,3060,13,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"lastly, when sunshine finally perfected her routine, she looks so free, so happy, so contented, you just know she already made her decision"
Sunshine,3060,14,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"it was such a beautiful scene, its just her and her routine and the kid — her kid — watching her and finally understanding her"
Sunshine,3060,15,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang nakakaiyak
Sunshine,3060,16,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,“gets ko na” such a simple statement but made me cry so hard wow

Sunshine,3060,18,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"great performances all around din talaga especially to maris racal grabe napakagaling, literal na wala talaga ako ibang masabi kundi sobrang sobrang galing wow"
Sunshine,3060,19,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"jennica garcia na hindi rin talaga maipagkakaila ang galing, ang onti lang ng scenes niya pero lahat may impact"
Sunshine,3060,20,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,and siyempre who would forget rhed bustamante na napakagaling din
Sunshine,3060,21,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"sound design and cinematography are on point din talaga, i especially love those parts when sunshine drowns out the noise"
Sunshine,3060,22,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"writing this made me realize that the whole film, the ones who made the most impact are women"
Sunshine,3060,23,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,"oh women, i hope one day the world will be kinder to us"
Sunshine,3060,24,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,i think i have said enought but i really hope that this film would be a way for people to be more open minded when it comes to the discussion of abortion and sana itong pelikulang ito ay maging daan rin para mas lalong maraming pang tao ang sumama sa laban na gawing legal ang safe abortion practices sa bansa
Sunshine,3060,25,posenfilms,,200.0,ltbx,and to direk tonet thank you for sharing us your craft and for meticulously creating this film

Sunshine,3061,5,kiruu_,,200.0,ltbx,": This fricking movie made me realize that being informed is one thing, but seeing and feeling the experience is another"
Sunshine,3062,1,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,Fear and self-interest
Sunshine,3062,2,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,The two powerful drives of men according to Napoleon
Sunshine,3062,3,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,"But Sunshine is a woman— a gymnast, one of the few sports considered most feminine—one of those burning out athletes who lives by flexibility, by bending yourself in all possible corners to become this perfect beautiful being"
Sunshine,3062,4,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,"So yes, maybe she was driven by fear and love for gymnastics, but why not"
Sunshine,3062,5,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,"Her panic walks bending through eskinitas, the close ups on Maris’ expressive eyes unyielding despite the fear, and the overwhelming passionate Filipino noise shiver through the gritty scene of Manila and it feeds us, the audience, a rhythmic choreography of the most tender experience of a woman"
Sunshine,3062,6,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,"Manila succumbs her, a fragile thin young girl on the verge of losing it all"
Sunshine,3062,7,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,And I fucking loved and consumed it
Sunshine,3062,8,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,"I love it too much I felt the giddiness through the tips of my fingers when the first scene at Quiapo entered, Sunshine in panic crying inside the jeep, and the first thing I thought was, “putangina si Julio ng Maynila sa Kuko ng Liwanag"
Sunshine,3062,9,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,"”Yes maybe Sunshine enjoyed doing it with Miggy, and maybe seen the near death process of getting rid of it through Mary Grace, felt the catholic guilt, and that maybe her drive to success is to disregard what could be (motherhood) but still, ultimately still, tender is the flesh of a woman who wants to be in life"
Sunshine,3062,10,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,"Like Julio (my shayla), tender is the flesh that holds all possibilities in life"
Sunshine,3062,11,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,"The difference is, the tragedy of Brocka’s Julio is the absence of grounded support systems"
Sunshine,3062,12,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine became her own because of the people and the women in her life who understood and grieved with her
Sunshine,3062,13,burntbread_,,200.0,ltbx,"Ito ang kasagutan sa katanungang paano naging kapantay Lino Brocka, Ishmael, Mario O’Hara si Dir"

Sunshine,3068,1,ladybirdaughter,,200.0,ltbx,"hangga't criminalized ang abortion sa pilipinas, patuloy na mapipilitan ang mga babaeng piliin ang delikadong paraan ng pagsasagawa nito"
Sunshine,3068,2,ladybirdaughter,,200.0,ltbx,"kahit pa labag ito sa batas, mangyayari't mangyayari pa rin"
Sunshine,3068,3,ladybirdaughter,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi ba ironic na sa quiapo—kung saan mayroong simbahang dinadasalan ng maraming tao, kung saan nakatayo ang isa sa mga institusyong unang nagtatatag ng pag-unawa natin sa aborsyon at iba pang ""sensitibong"" usapin—doon din makahahanap ng mga pampalaglag"
Sunshine,3068,4,ladybirdaughter,,200.0,ltbx,mapalad si sunshine at mary grace dahil mayroong doc helena
Sunshine,3068,5,ladybirdaughter,,200.0,ltbx,"ngunit para sa maraming mga babae sa pilipinas, hindi palaging ganoon ang kanilang sinasapit"
Sunshine,3068,6,ladybirdaughter,,200.0,ltbx,mahusay ang pagkakasulat sa relasyon ng mga babae sa pelikula—sila ang naging sentro nito para sa akin
Sunshine,3068,7,ladybirdaughter,,200.0,ltbx,"mula sa coach na naniwala sa kakayanan ni sunshine sa loob ng siyam na taon, sa ate niyang nangakong lagi niya itong kakampi, kay thea na sinamahan siya sa dulo sa kabila ng fallout nila noong una, si annika na pangarap ang pangarap niya, si mary grace na tinulungan at hindi iniwan ni sunshine hanggang masigurado niyang ligtas ito, si doc helena na nagligtas ng buhay ni mary grace nang walang kapalit at mismong nagsagawa ng aborsyon para kay sunshine, hanggang sa receptionist na agad-agad inalala ang kapakanan niya at siya pang nagbayad ng pamasahe"
Sunshine,3068,8,ladybirdaughter,,200.0,ltbx,"sa bansa nating karaniwang malupit ang pagturing sa mga kababaihan, maaasahan mong sa huli, babae pa rin ang palaging magiging sandigan ng kapwa niya babae"

Sunshine,3070,2,thystleburst,,200.0,ltbx,i really love how the film showed the different facets of being a woman living in the philippines
Sunshine,3070,3,thystleburst,,200.0,ltbx,how we’re all shackled by a patriarchal and conservative society
Sunshine,3070,4,thystleburst,,200.0,ltbx,"and despite the many symbolism, the message of the film is very straightforward"
Sunshine,3070,5,thystleburst,,200.0,ltbx,it’s already laid out for everyone to understand
Sunshine,3070,6,thystleburst,,200.0,ltbx,you just have to open your mind and heart

Sunshine,3076,7,tinaaapon,,200.0,ltbx,"isang batang babaeng takot na takot at walang magawa kundi tumungo sa online spaces (twitter, reddit, google, tiktok, etc"
Sunshine,3076,8,tinaaapon,,200.0,ltbx,) para humanap ng paraan para makawala sa sitwasyong hindi niya inakalang mangyayari sakanya; saklap pa na isang lalaking walang kwenta ang naglagay sakanya sa posisyon na iyon
Sunshine,3076,9,tinaaapon,,200.0,ltbx,"actually, isang buong bansa (with its strictly religious ideals, nonsensical government, and fucked up healthcare system) ang naglagay sakanya sa posisyon na iyon"
Sunshine,3076,10,tinaaapon,,200.0,ltbx,from the beginning until the end of the movie sobrang emphasized nito
Sunshine,3076,11,tinaaapon,,200.0,ltbx,"from the small comments (yung pharmacist) to the loud barking of unsolicited remarks (yung doktora na sinabihan pa si sunshine na magpasalamat kay Lord na hindi nalaglag yung bata, grabe rage bait 10000)"
Sunshine,3076,12,tinaaapon,,200.0,ltbx,pero makikita mo parin na grabe talaga ang chokehold ng religion sa ating mga pinoy
Sunshine,3076,13,tinaaapon,,200.0,ltbx,the way sunshine’s first instinct was to go to church and pray that it all goes away

Sunshine,3076,27,tinaaapon,,200.0,ltbx,the “bata” (which i assume is younger sunshine) was my favorite

Sunshine,3079,2,bulldstar,,200.0,ltbx,Nirerepresenta ng pelikula na ito ang malaking sikreto ng isang babaeng nakaranas ng ganitong sitwasyon
Sunshine,3079,3,bulldstar,,200.0,ltbx,"Pinag-usapan sa pelikula na ito ang katahimikan, takot, kasabikan, pagdadalawang-isip, pag-iisa, ang konsensya, ang buhay, ang kamatayan--- isinambit sa pelikula ang hindi maibanggit-banggit ng mga kababaihang nakaranas ng aborsyon, at ngayon sila ay narinig, nagkaroon ng boses at patuloy lang sa pagpapatuloy"
Sunshine,3079,4,bulldstar,,200.0,ltbx,Some people don't understand the role of Annika and Aryana(
Sunshine,3079,6,bulldstar,,200.0,ltbx,Some think it's just a cell (you will forget about it)

Sunshine,3087,1,ahmilkies,,160.0,ltbx,"baby I've seen this kind of situation in real life, and I must say, kuhang kuha"
Sunshine,3087,2,ahmilkies,,160.0,ltbx,"I'm telling you'll that THIS IS HAPPENING IN REALITY, and even worse, and this the reason why abortion should be legal, and hindi porket legal eh lahat pwede na, may mga proseso yan, like a selection only WHO should get abortion legally"
Sunshine,3087,3,ahmilkies,,160.0,ltbx,", A counseling before abortion yk something like that, there's always a solution to this kind of problem at kaya lang naman nagiging problema ang isang bagay kasi hindi sha nasosolusyunan ng tama"
Sunshine,3087,4,ahmilkies,,160.0,ltbx,"im a Christian and yes, it is very wrong to get abortion by the law of God but Im also an advocate of 'her body, her choice' and caring for what a woman body's go through and the more na hinihigpitan ang mga ganitong bagay mas lalong nagiging delikado hindi lang yung proseso pati na rin ang buhay ng babae kaya accessible help, health care and education for abortion is a MUST"
Sunshine,3087,5,ahmilkies,,160.0,ltbx,Wag nating hayaan na pumunta pa sila sa quiapo para sa mga delikadong herbal medicine na yan
Sunshine,3088,1,zehdi,,200.0,ltbx,hangang hanga talaga ako kay maris :o
Sunshine,3089,1,st7rk,,140.0,ltbx,"i am so happy and proud that stories like this are being told, i hope more women see that they are allowed to make choices for themselves i loved the scenes of sunshine on the mats performing/practicing her routine, it’s the only setting in the whole movie where i never feared for her life and where i thought she looked like she belonged"
Sunshine,3089,2,st7rk,,140.0,ltbx,"beautiful storytelling thereon a more technical note:maris racal’s acting is phenomenal, i just feel that the supporting cast wasn't on par with her for most scenes (the sister and the coach were good tho)some of the dialogue was corny at times, but overall the product is good and the message was clear and delivered anyway"
Sunshine,3090,1,yeeelly,,160.0,ltbx,sad to think that this is someone's reality
Sunshine,3092,1,webstahr,,180.0,ltbx,"Powerful, beautiful"
Sunshine,3093,1,filipinyana,,180.0,ltbx,uncomfortably real representation of how ph society views abortion
Sunshine,3093,2,filipinyana,,180.0,ltbx,"the interconnection of everything: the state of public institutions (sports centers , hospitals, schools,) access to medical care, religion and values and kaya niyo na yan ilista we watched the same filmand how all of these are much more cruel to young women like sunshine, like myself"
Sunshine,3093,3,filipinyana,,180.0,ltbx,it was such a hard watch because every scene features a place so familiar
Sunshine,3093,4,filipinyana,,180.0,ltbx,"i grew up here in manila and it's always been the same—mabaho, maingay, malagkit"
Sunshine,3093,5,filipinyana,,180.0,ltbx,i couldn't help but cynically laugh each time i see something messed up bc idk just until when this would go on
Sunshine,3093,7,filipinyana,,180.0,ltbx,5 kasi maling side ng quiapo binabaan nia kung galing shang harrison emz
Sunshine,3094,3,ohmygeorge,,200.0,ltbx,WE LOVE YOU DIR
Sunshine,3095,1,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,i absolutely love how nuanced this is
Sunshine,3095,2,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,how it took into consideration filipino contexts in discussing such a sensitive topic
Sunshine,3095,3,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"i love the cinematography, absolutely stunning"
Sunshine,3095,4,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,captured the vibe of living in the busy and harmful streets of manila
Sunshine,3095,5,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,discussed this with my gf but i find the heavy incorporation of religion in this quite integral to the story
Sunshine,3095,6,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"while westerners may be able to discuss about abortion more openly, filipinos whose lives revolve around religion, are not at all the same"
Sunshine,3095,7,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"we were taught at an early age that religion is the absolute law, and we must follow every rule made in the name of religion"
Sunshine,3095,8,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"and so, the guilt sunshine carries throughout the film is heavier than ever, because not only was she dealing with the judgment of others, she was also dealing with the judgment of God, “The Father"
Sunshine,3095,9,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"” And, surprisingly enough, I find the presence of the child important"
Sunshine,3095,10,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"At first, she bothered me a bit, how she accused shine of being a murderer, stopped shine from her attempts at abortion"
Sunshine,3095,11,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"She’s the superego, the guilt that follows shine everywhere"
Sunshine,3095,12,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"But also, she’s a part of sunshine, hence her line “Pangarap ko ang pangarap niya"
Sunshine,3095,13,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"” (non verbatim) and so, she too, wishes to see sunshine succeed"
Sunshine,3095,14,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,Her running to sunshine after her final performance and saying “gets ko na” was her way of easing shine’s guilt
Sunshine,3095,15,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"After all, as people love to give life to everyone’s unborn child, then I guess this once, I too, shall make use of that"
Sunshine,3095,16,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"Viewing sunshine’s life through the eyes of her “unborn child” must have been painful, yet every child I know has questioned (at least once) how good of a life their mother would’ve had, had they never been born"
Sunshine,3095,17,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"And just like every living child, the kid too, understood how much gymnastics meant to shine"
Sunshine,3095,18,rashomiao,,160.0,ltbx,"And she was willing to trade the loss of her life for sunshine’s happiness, because she will always be a part of sunshine"
Sunshine,3096,1,awriirey,,160.0,ltbx,what am i doing here

Sunshine,3099,1,javi_dg,,200.0,ltbx,"listen to me, women are the only ones who will understand fellow women"
Sunshine,3099,2,javi_dg,,200.0,ltbx,"men are trash and will always be trash, conceited and people who think of women as stuff they can just discard after using"
Sunshine,3099,3,javi_dg,,200.0,ltbx,this film sheds light on why abortion is something that is shouldn’t be labeled as “sinful” or “illegal”
Sunshine,3099,4,javi_dg,,200.0,ltbx,"it’s for women who has dreams they still want to achieve, for women who has more important obligations and is not ready to be a mother, for women who are abused by self-centered men"
Sunshine,3100,1,blu3dahlias,,160.0,ltbx,"Movie felt slightly rushed, I love how they portrayed religious trauma and the forced actions and stereotypes"
Sunshine,3100,2,blu3dahlias,,160.0,ltbx,It really spreads awareness about a woman having to choose a life changing decision
Sunshine,3101,1,ryusnk,,200.0,ltbx,this was so black swan

Sunshine,3109,20,audioflicks,,160.0,ltbx,"It felt intense, raw, and beautifully crafted"
Sunshine,3109,21,audioflicks,,160.0,ltbx,And the presence of the kid as her guilty conscience completed the emotional arc in such a striking way
Sunshine,3109,22,audioflicks,,160.0,ltbx,It felt like a final haunting reminder of everything she carried
Sunshine,3110,1,nesdead,,160.0,ltbx,What I love the most of this film is the face-on paradoxes that unfortunately reflects the reality
Sunshine,3110,2,nesdead,,160.0,ltbx,"You see a doctor, who is supposed to save lives regardless, ignore a teenager because she took pills"
Sunshine,3110,3,nesdead,,160.0,ltbx,You see the main character fully knowing the consequences of her actions but most people around her thinks she should do this or that
Sunshine,3110,4,nesdead,,160.0,ltbx,"And you see pro-life always insisting that the aborted children could be someone great, but never giving a glance to those…"
Sunshine,3111,1,ashiesushi,,180.0,ltbx,the amount of pain a woman is forced to endure simply for wanting to live her own life is insane
Sunshine,3111,2,ashiesushi,,180.0,ltbx,"it's difficult enough to choose between your dreams and your own body, and society makes that choice even harder"
Sunshine,3111,3,ashiesushi,,180.0,ltbx,women are constantly penalized for seeking freedom and wanting to build their own future; nothing we do is truly allowed to be for ourselves
Sunshine,3111,4,ashiesushi,,180.0,ltbx,"such an incredible performance from maris racal, i genuinely think she conveys the very soul of the film just with her eyes"
Sunshine,3111,5,ashiesushi,,180.0,ltbx,"so so good, definitely something everyone needs to watch and absorbside note: my sister and her girlfriend watched this in theaters and met maris racal LMAO"

Sunshine,3115,2,mtxapot,,160.0,ltbx,"There are some dragging scenes lang, particularly the running scenes, which took up too much time instead of giving more depth to the plot"
Sunshine,3115,3,mtxapot,,160.0,ltbx,"But overall, its still a good one"
Sunshine,3116,1,louiese,,160.0,ltbx,this is a film that shows several harsh realities that many young women face every day
Sunshine,3116,2,louiese,,160.0,ltbx,"it tackles sensitive yet crucial issues such as unplanned pregnancy, illegal abortion, sexual assault committed by a family member, the heavy influence of religion on decision-making, and how one snap can completely shatter a young person’s future"
Sunshine,3116,3,louiese,,160.0,ltbx,these themes are not exaggerated; they are painful and real

Sunshine,3116,12,louiese,,160.0,ltbx,"it reveals how instead of creating long-term solutions, government tend to simply acknowledge the issue or, worse, disregard it"
Sunshine,3116,13,louiese,,160.0,ltbx,the systems remain weak and unresponsive
Sunshine,3116,14,louiese,,160.0,ltbx,"beyond all of these social issues, the film also shows how dreams can easily collapse under the weight of societal pressure"

Sunshine,3129,9,augustisaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunod naman yung batang si Anika, noong una hindi ko gets bakit bigla siyang susulpot at mawawala"
Sunshine,3129,10,augustisaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"Para sa akin para siyang inner child ni Sunshine kung susuriin yung pelikula sa bandang dulo nang tinuloy ni Sunshine na gamitin yung nabiling gamot sa Ale sa quiapo, basta fast-forward sa tricycle, makikita na yung legs ni Anika ay may dugo rin which is sign na ganon ang epekto ng nabili niyang gamot o pag abort, hindi ko ma explain pero gets na yan, at kung paano huminga si Sunshine ganoon din siya noong isinusugod na siya sa hospital"
Sunshine,3129,11,augustisaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"Tapos parang noong una hindi pa gets ni Anika yung mga desisyon ni Sunshine sa kagustuhang magpa abort pero yung sa huli nakita niya kung paano mahal at gusto ni Sunshine yung pangrap niya kaya I love the part na sinabi niya na ""gets ko na"" ika niya nga"
Sunshine,3129,12,augustisaugust,,200.0,ltbx,Tapos if you think yung pagintindi ay hindi nanggaling sa iba kundi sa sarili niya diba
Sunshine,3129,13,augustisaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"So, ito na nga dahil binanggit ko na ang quiapo, gusto ko rin yung scene na matapos niyang malaman na buntis siya dumiretso agad siya sa simbahan para mag dasal"
Sunshine,3129,15,augustisaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"kasi may guilt siya part niya sana gets niyo ako, staka super religious o predominant catholic itong bansa natin, sana gets hahahaha"
Sunshine,3129,16,augustisaugust,,200.0,ltbx,"tapos diba yung binilhan ni Sunshine ng pangpa abort parang katabi o malapit sa simbahan parang na pinipilit ng relihiyon at batas ang mga babae sa isang krisis, ngunit ang parehong lugar din ang kanilang takbuhan para maghanap ng bawal na solusyon"

Sunshine,3214,2,navinhendrix,,,ltbx,It’s heart wrecking to realise that still there’s a country with total ban on “Abortion” irrespective of the way got the girl pregnant (even rape) or the condition of the pregnant woman
Sunshine,3214,3,navinhendrix,,,ltbx,It’s cruelty

Sunshine,3214,6,navinhendrix,,,ltbx,How much inequality have we imposed on them in different ways and names
Sunshine,3214,7,navinhendrix,,,ltbx,Where she just keeps hitting her stomach with bare hand hoping it’d kill the baby or the approach of bringing in surrealism (or mythology) to show the unborn kids’ connection and interactions with their yet to give birth Mom had made it much more harder for us to come over it

Sunshine,3216,3,_jxcx,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine only gained clarity when she felt supported by her older sister - that at the end of the day, she gets to have control and the final say to whatever her decision is"
Sunshine,3216,4,_jxcx,,180.0,ltbx,"Giving agency to the people whose decisions will only affect them anyway sounds so simple since you can apply it to almost anything, but once abortion is mentioned, suddenly some people want to control the decisions of other people"

Sunshine,3216,6,_jxcx,,180.0,ltbx,"People forget that their religion is based on faith, not objective truth"

Sunshine,3222,10,loui_d,,160.0,ltbx,The side characters are so carefully placed to further progress the story
Sunshine,3222,11,loui_d,,160.0,ltbx,This movie should be seen by more people just cause it highlights a sensitive topic people don’t really want to address

Sunshine,3230,3,angelohfck,,160.0,ltbx,"I will never know what it’s like to be a woman with child but this film made me feel all the conflicted, complicated, and crushing emotions of what it’s like to make that oh so difficult decision"
Sunshine,3230,4,angelohfck,,160.0,ltbx,Yes it’s incredibly sad yet she has to make the choice that’s best for her even though it literally breaks every inch of her soul
Sunshine,3230,5,angelohfck,,160.0,ltbx,It accurately portrays Filipino society’s perception around abortion and how religion and gender roles play an integral part in the whole ordeal when it absolutely should not
Sunshine,3230,6,angelohfck,,160.0,ltbx,"It should be between the woman and her doctor alone, the outsiders opinion only makes this life altering decision so much harder than it already is"
Sunshine,3230,7,angelohfck,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s so wonderfully nuanced and so so beautiful, thank you for keeping Filipino cinema alive Sunshine"
Sunshine,3230,8,angelohfck,,160.0,ltbx,I also loved that her kid had a rainbow shirt on which comes after a sunshine

Sunshine,3237,3,lycoris_lilies,,200.0,ltbx,And those people have to make decisions that sometimes are not acceptable to norms or beliefs
Sunshine,3237,4,lycoris_lilies,,200.0,ltbx,But Maris Racal delivers a story of a girl na hindi humihingi ng sympathy kundi karapatan

Sunshine,3237,9,lycoris_lilies,,200.0,ltbx,We don’t have to personally want what Sunshine wants
Sunshine,3237,10,lycoris_lilies,,200.0,ltbx,Pero we must understand why she has to fight for it
Sunshine,3237,11,lycoris_lilies,,200.0,ltbx,Kung bakit may mga oportunidad na dapat bukas para sa lahat kahit na hindi natin ito kailangan
Sunshine,3237,12,lycoris_lilies,,200.0,ltbx,"Kung hindi mo gets kung bakit may kailangang pumili, maybe you are privileged enough na hindi mo pa kailangan mamili"
Sunshine,3237,13,lycoris_lilies,,200.0,ltbx,And that’s exactly why we must always choose compassion

Sunshine,3252,3,katejumawan,,160.0,ltbx,This literally depicts women around the philippines—-no matter what economic class they may be— when it comes to teenage pregnancy
Sunshine,3252,4,katejumawan,,160.0,ltbx,"Whether or not we care to admit it, no teenage pregnancy is planned and the toll that has on a developing woman will never ever ne experienced by ANY man"
Sunshine,3252,5,katejumawan,,160.0,ltbx,"So miggy, pakyu"
Sunshine,3252,6,katejumawan,,160.0,ltbx,"Pero grabe, you can feel the internal battle Sunshine was going through and I think that every single woman who has a dream, a goal in life perhaps, if situated the same, would go through the same lengths"
Sunshine,3252,7,katejumawan,,160.0,ltbx,"Maybe not through all of that extent, but this is such an eye opening movie to those who still feel like abortion in the philippines is taboo"
Sunshine,3252,8,katejumawan,,160.0,ltbx,You would literally rather have all these women dying instead of getting and giving them the right medical treatment
Sunshine,3252,9,katejumawan,,160.0,ltbx,"These are children, btw"

Sunshine,3266,2,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,also i only got to watch it now kasi kakarelease lang sa netflix first i just wanted to applaud the use of background noises
Sunshine,3266,3,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,"i think im so used to movies relying on ‘noise cancellation’ that the background sounds were so instantly noticeable for me, and i understood it as something integral to the plot na ‘sunshine’s story is just one sound among many’, and thinking about how noisy these public spaces are (quiapo, avenida) parang ang liit tignan ng buhay ni sunshine tuloy"
Sunshine,3266,4,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,"and it’s so real that society tends to overlook the lives of these women where they’re commonly diminished into statistics or cautionary talesi can even argue that in some instances, like sunshine praying outside the quiapo church or secretly talking to the pamparegla seller, is a ‘background noise’ in itself"
Sunshine,3266,5,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,naingayan ako sa mga scenes na yun to the point where the dialogue was just blending with the background noise
Sunshine,3266,6,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,"it really says a lot about how these stories are just among us, and it’s so devastating to think that something as serious as this matter (something hindering of one’s ambitions and with the capacity of changing the direction of one’s life) blends so well with noise we consider every-day and mundanesecond, this movie really touched my pathos  given my positionality as a woman"
Sunshine,3266,7,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,"the scrolling on reddit, silently looking for online communities or help"
Sunshine,3266,8,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,ugh i understood the frustration of being a woman in a catholic country so well
Sunshine,3266,9,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,"i obviously have never been pregnant, but when im at the BIOLOGICAL age for it, ang scary to think na we don’t have that option at all, na our bodily autonomies are immediately disregarded by others just because of personal beliefs"
Sunshine,3266,10,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,ang daming instances when i was watching na iniisip ko nalang ‘what if that were me
Sunshine,3266,11,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,’ SYEMPRE WAG NAMAN SANA PERO that’s the point diba
Sunshine,3266,12,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,for the movie to put us in the shoes of sunshine and make us FEEL that we don’t want to be in her shoes
Sunshine,3266,13,champagnebelley,,180.0,ltbx,"that way we’ll think of challenging the system that we currently have but i really love how despite the circumstances, sunshine was still adamant about being true to her autonomy and GANUN talaga dapat"

Sunshine,3269,4,kyudotcom,,80.0,ltbx,an absurd amount of suspension of belief is required for this movie which doesn’t make sense to me in a movie where most of the situations are so grounded in reality anyway
Sunshine,3269,5,kyudotcom,,80.0,ltbx,It tries to do too much for its own good
Sunshine,3269,6,kyudotcom,,80.0,ltbx,"The sequence of events make no sense, relationships with people have no emotional weight aside from Sunshine and her sister, ang gulo"

Sunshine,3270,1,sssickly,,160.0,ltbx,"some bits I especially liked: - sunshine praying just outside the church, feeling unworthy to enter for what she's about to do- her sister helping her stretch her shoulders, trying to motivate her by saying ""SEA games"" ""olympics"" and so on, accidentally doing what is opposite her intention and instead adding a burden to sunshine's shoulders"
Sunshine,3270,2,sssickly,,160.0,ltbx,- the focus on rape-incest cases
Sunshine,3270,3,sssickly,,160.0,ltbx,it happens so much in our country but its been kept under wraps for way too long
Sunshine,3270,4,sssickly,,160.0,ltbx,"im glad a film that has gained this much traction helped put it, and the many ways that it's the mothers and maternal figures that facilitate such violations of their own children has been put to light"
Sunshine,3270,5,sssickly,,160.0,ltbx,"i felt conflicted watching what is supposed to be these imaginary consciousnesses of unborn children running about and acting as, what i initially thought to be, a device for invoking guilt in these young and unwilling kids and anger in its audience"
Sunshine,3270,6,sssickly,,160.0,ltbx,"but perhaps they were an avenue for the world to understand that while they have a future too, so does sunshine"

Sunshine,3364,3,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,I didn’t expect how emotional this film would make me feel — to the point that it got me all teary-eyed
Sunshine,3364,4,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,"""Sunshine"" is one of those films that stirs something inside: It makes you see, it makes you feel, it makes you realize, and it makes you understand"
Sunshine,3364,5,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,"Itong ""Sunshine"" ay hindi lang basta-bastang pelikula gaya ng iba, dahil sa malalim at mabigat nitong mensahe"
Sunshine,3364,6,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine, the girl with big dreams who got pregnant too early"
Sunshine,3364,7,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,"Mary Grace, a child neglected by her own Mother, and was raped and impregnated by her Uncle — these characters aren’t purely fictional; they reflect real-life problems that many have faced"
Sunshine,3364,8,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,Iilan lamang ang sitwasyon nina Sunshine at Mary Grace sa maraming dahilan kung bakit sang-ayon ako sa Abortion o Pro-choice
Sunshine,3364,9,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,Abortion isn’t murder; it’s healthcare — this is a strong and profound message in the film
Sunshine,3364,10,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,"""Sunshine"" is a film that goes beyond entertainment; it also functions as an eye-opener"
Sunshine,3364,11,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,I hope na mas marami pa ang manood ng movie na ‘to
Sunshine,3364,12,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,Para ma-realize nila kung gaano kahalaga na i-legalize ang aborsyon sa bansa
Sunshine,3364,13,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,"Kasi, sa totoo lang, napakaraming problema na puwedeng ma-solve kapag na-legalize na ang aborsyon (e"

Sunshine,3364,17,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,"Ang solid talaga nito, pati ‘yung mga bwisit na chismosa at religious people na nagpapaka-saint kuhang-kuha"
Sunshine,3364,18,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,"But joke aside, nakakainis talaga ‘yung mga nagmamagaling na ‘yan, ta’s gagamitin pa ang Bible para i-justify ang pagiging ignorante nila"
Sunshine,3364,19,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,"Like please, can’t they learn to set aside their religious beliefs and think about what truly matters"
Sunshine,3364,20,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,"They disagree, solely because the bible says it’s a sin"
Sunshine,3364,21,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,But what about those who have (and will) suffer
Sunshine,3364,22,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,"All they care about is that the baby gets delivered, but what comes after that"
Sunshine,3364,23,rexieh,,180.0,ltbx,They don’t care

Sunshine,3365,1,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,mahal na mahal kita Sunshine
Sunshine,3365,2,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,bigla kong na-gets yung sinabi ng mama ko na tumatak talaga sa’kin
Sunshine,3365,3,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,"she once told me, during a fight, na sana hindi niya na lang ako binuhay"
Sunshine,3365,4,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,"i know it’s an inappropriate thing to say to your child, pero now i kinda understand where it came from"
Sunshine,3365,5,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,hindi ko siya kayang i-hate
Sunshine,3365,6,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,"alam ko na she was once a “Sunshine” too na punong-puno ng pangarap, at nawala ang lahat ng ’yon nung nabuntis siya sa’kin"
Sunshine,3365,7,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,"maybe we can use the quote “rejection is redirection,” pero masakit isipin na she could’ve done better"
Sunshine,3365,8,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,i can’t blame her for having the what-ifs of her past
Sunshine,3365,9,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi niya kasalanan na she grew up in a conservative, religious country"
Sunshine,3365,10,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,systemic talaga ang lahat
Sunshine,3365,11,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,alam ko na mahal na mahala ako ng nanay ko pero hindi ko rin siya masisi kung may regret pa rin siya about the dreams she never got to chase
Sunshine,3365,12,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,"this movie helped me understand her side a bit more, and somehow, it helped me forgive her for saying that thing"
Sunshine,3365,13,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,sana maging legal na ang abortion sa Pilipinas
Sunshine,3365,14,c2greentea,,200.0,ltbx,at sana mas maraming kababaihan ang maging katulad ni Sunshine na patuloy na pipiliin ang sarili at pangarap
Sunshine,3366,1,kalistangina,,180.0,ltbx,"aside from being a tad bit short for my liking, i have no notes"
Sunshine,3366,2,kalistangina,,180.0,ltbx,this movie perfectly encapsulated the reality most women experience
Sunshine,3366,3,kalistangina,,180.0,ltbx,women are deprived of choices when it comes to this because of the possibility of being persecuted
Sunshine,3366,4,kalistangina,,180.0,ltbx,and I'm glad Sunshine made a decision solely for herself and her dreams
Sunshine,3366,5,kalistangina,,180.0,ltbx,women should never be scared nor be subjected to subjugation by beliefs such as religion for a decision made for herself
Sunshine,3366,6,kalistangina,,180.0,ltbx,i will always support women who knows what they want and what they don't
Sunshine,3366,7,kalistangina,,180.0,ltbx,"until it's your life, you have no right to decide"

Sunshine,3367,1,janeng,,200.0,ltbx,malayo pa
Sunshine,3368,1,acretined,,,ltbx,Gets kita
Sunshine,3368,2,acretined,,,ltbx,Wala pang kalahating oras nang ipakita ang eksena kung saan humingi ng tawad si Sunshine sa harap ng simbahan—Tagos
Sunshine,3368,3,acretined,,,ltbx,Ramdam agad ang emosyon at ang mensahe
Sunshine,3368,4,acretined,,,ltbx,Sabay na nakakalungkot at nakakagalit kung iyong iisipin na sa bawat tagpi ng eksena ay ipinapamukha ng pelikulang ito ang tunay na representasyon at kalagayan ng mga kababaihin patungkol sa aborsyon at 'reproductive health' sa Pilpinas: mahirap at nakakasuka
Sunshine,3368,5,acretined,,,ltbx,Importante ang bawat sulok ng pelikulang ito lalung lalo na ang pananalamin sa estado at kasuluksulukan ng Quiapo
Sunshine,3368,6,acretined,,,ltbx,"Sa bawat busina at usok ng mga jeep, sa bawat ingay ng mga tao, sa bawat lakad ng mga kababaihan na may sabay na bitbit na pangarap at problema, hinding hindi maikukumpara kung gaano kasalimuot ang kanilang mga nararanasan"
Sunshine,3368,7,acretined,,,ltbx,"Kaya kung napanood mo ito at hindi ka pa sumasang-ayon, naway isipin mo ang mahabaging desisyon na bitbit ni Sunshine (hindi man ito aayon sa kultura at relihiyon ng ating bansa), sapagkat ito ay mahalagang proposal na dapat isaalang-alang ng nakararami"
Sunshine,3369,1,luviee,,160.0,ltbx,"First of all, hands down kay Maris"
Sunshine,3369,2,luviee,,160.0,ltbx,"Knowing na inaral niya talaga yung gymnastics, grabe yung dedication"
Sunshine,3369,3,luviee,,160.0,ltbx,"Kudos din to Direk Antoinette—this film shows how women are so easily labeled, judged, and stereotyped by society"
Sunshine,3369,4,luviee,,160.0,ltbx,Malaking isyu pa rin talaga ang aborsyon sa Pilipinas
Sunshine,3369,5,luviee,,160.0,ltbx,"This film shows kung paano napipilitan ang mga babae bumili ng illegal abortion pills kahit alam nilang delikado, dahil banned pa rin ang abortion sa’tin"
Sunshine,3369,6,luviee,,160.0,ltbx,"Hindi lang naman ‘to tungkol kay Sunshine na may pangarap, para…"

Sunshine,3373,3,wizz_aenorii,,200.0,ltbx,"I like how this movie showed how we, women, help each other lalo na yung mga nakakatanda na sobrang lawak ng pag-iisip at talagang iniintindi yung sitwasyon ng kaharap nila, syempre hindi maiiwasan ang judgement lalo na sa bansang paurong ang usad"
Sunshine,3373,4,wizz_aenorii,,200.0,ltbx,Maybe for me may ups and downs lang yung role ni anikka co and ariana kasi I feel like they’re the representation of unbord child of Rhed Bustamante and Sunshine
Sunshine,3373,5,wizz_aenorii,,200.0,ltbx,I like their overall role pero kasi sumagi lang sa isip ko na what if may nakakanood ngayon na nasa same position ni sunshine and magmukhang giniguilt trip sila nung movie (sana gets nyo)

Sunshine,3382,13,cersei_mae,,200.0,ltbx,"Super nakaka amaze yung ginawa ni sunshine, it is not easy to do such thing lalo na at health nya rin ang nakasalalay dito dahil walang safe na paraan kaya kailangan nyang sumugal"
Sunshine,3382,14,cersei_mae,,200.0,ltbx,"And i love her strong character, i know na deep inside she felt guilty but she know nmn na hindi sya ready and nasa peak na sya ng achieving her dreams e"

Sunshine,3385,2,nonrev,,200.0,ltbx,The men who always attempt to get away with their responsibility after learning the byproduct of their act
Sunshine,3385,3,nonrev,,200.0,ltbx,"More significantly, the relevance of the depiction of the child on how the story and the plot progresses gives an emphasis on the acceptance of the sentiment of not wanting to conceive a child"
Sunshine,3385,4,nonrev,,200.0,ltbx,"How Maris' character dedicated most of her life doing something she loves: gymnastics, which can be taken away from considering her pregnancy--- she literally did everything and sacrificed everything to reach her dreams"
Sunshine,3385,5,nonrev,,200.0,ltbx,The movie has conveyed the weight of abortion and how motherhood is a choice which is not tailored for all women

Sunshine,3392,7,blackrosie,,180.0,ltbx,Hindi ko alam kung bakit ang hirap nitong intindihin para sa iba
Sunshine,3392,8,blackrosie,,180.0,ltbx,"This movie doesn’t just show the reality of unplanned pregnancy, it exposes why good quality and ACCESSIBLE healthcare is crucial and why fucking abortion needs to be legalized"
Sunshine,3392,9,blackrosie,,180.0,ltbx,"It makes you realize how a corrupt, underfunded healthcare system, shaped by decades of neglect, ends up deciding the choices and safety of women"
Sunshine,3392,10,blackrosie,,180.0,ltbx,"A country with no real healthcare access, outdated religious stigma, and a government that would rather shame women than help them traps women into choices they never truly want, and pushes them to resort to illegal and unsafe ways just to be able na mapalaglag na lang yung bata para makapagpatuloy sa kanilang buhay"
Sunshine,3392,11,blackrosie,,180.0,ltbx,"Pinakita din nito na HINDI madali para sa isang babae na magpalaglag ng bata, lalo na kung ikaw ay isa lang ring bata"

Sunshine,3434,10,elliecit,,180.0,ltbx,"teenage mothers live their lives in discomfort everyday, so showing their realities and humanizing them is more than enough to make people realize that their own personhood should always come first before an embryo"

Sunshine,3465,2,icawatch,,140.0,ltbx,"Anyways, the movie did great in relying why sometimes some reasons do weigh more in terms of accepting an unwanted child birth, but well I do not actively support it but I respect it"
Sunshine,3465,3,icawatch,,140.0,ltbx,"I am not to judge to what they do, because sometimes when you think about it, like for instance that 13 girl who was raped by her mother's boyfriend(What an absolute ahole btw and also the mother"

Sunshine,3467,4,dumpsterangel,,160.0,ltbx,"I don't think that my incredibly sheltered memory of the place would hold as much cultural weight than that of a local, and yet fourteen years later Manila is still"

Sunshine,3544,2,waweywatches,,160.0,ltbx,WTHthere are scenes that subtly depicts women's maternal challenges alongside the ”abortion dilemma” such as the jeep with the banner written ‘God’s Gift’ and Sunshine and her boy relative (not sure if it’s her niece or cousin) passing the baby responsibilities to each other
Sunshine,3544,3,waweywatches,,160.0,ltbx,"and ultimately, women, carrying the burden of bearing a childhonestly, I don’t think that this movie promotes abortion itself"
Sunshine,3544,4,waweywatches,,160.0,ltbx,"it just layers out the challenges of unexpected pregnancy in women—physically, emotionally, socially, and career-wise"
Sunshine,3544,5,waweywatches,,160.0,ltbx,"so to those boomers who says otherwise, F Uthis is so refreshing to see in the PH's film discography, i mean, IM SO GLAD THAT ITS NOT A MOVIE ABOUT AFFAIRS OR MISTRESSES"

Sunshine,3560,1,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,“kasalanan sa mata ng diyos”is abortion a sin
Sunshine,3560,2,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,people will answer this differently because morality in the philippines is rarely personal
Sunshine,3560,3,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"it is inherited by religion, tradition, and the weight of everyone watching"
Sunshine,3560,4,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"for many, the word “abortion” automatically activates the label of sin, as if life were a simple moral equation and suffering didn’t count as part of the formula"
Sunshine,3560,5,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"for others, it is a decision carved out of fear, pressure, and survival, made in the middle of circumstances that no outsider fully understands"
Sunshine,3560,6,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"kung ginahasa ka, kasalanan pa rin ba ang pagpapalaglag sa bata"
Sunshine,3560,7,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"if your answer is yes, then your moral compass is calibrated more by dogma than empathy, and your worldview is as rigid as the doctrine you inherited without questioning"
Sunshine,3560,8,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,conservatism in the philippines is not subtle
Sunshine,3560,9,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"it is soaked into daily life, in families, in pulpits, reinforced by laws that pretend neutrality but are shaped by centuries of religious influence"
Sunshine,3560,10,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"sa bansa natin, halos lahat ng desisyon ng babae ay may kasamang mata ng lipunan na handang humusga, tama"
Sunshine,3560,11,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"abortion becomes more than a medical choice; it becomes a cultural crime, a symbol that people weaponize even when they know nothing about the life behind the decision"
Sunshine,3560,12,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"the environment itself—manila’s density, poverty, inequality, survivalism—creates conditions where choices are never purely “moral"
Sunshine,3560,13,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,” what do you expect from a city where half the population is just trying to get through the day
Sunshine,3560,14,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"when you strip away the labels, the question of sin becomes less religious and more philosophical"
Sunshine,3560,15,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"sin implies intent, malice, or moral wrongdoing"
Sunshine,3560,16,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"abortion, for many, is none of these"
Sunshine,3560,17,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"if you’d ask me i’d say that, it is not an act of cruelty"
Sunshine,3560,18,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"it is a response to reality, a calculated survival decision shaped by pressure that most people never experience"
Sunshine,3560,19,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"kung hindi mo kailanman naramdaman ang desperasyon ng isang taong walang mapuntahan, anong karapatan mong magsabing mali ang pinili niya"
Sunshine,3560,20,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"reducing abortion to “sin” ignores everything: economic instability, trauma, lack of support systems, inaccessible healthcare, fear of judgment, and the sheer brutality of living in a country that demands endurance but offers nothing in return"
Sunshine,3560,21,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,the real discussion is not about moral purity but about environment
Sunshine,3560,22,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,what context shaped the choice
Sunshine,3560,23,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,what access to resources existed
Sunshine,3560,24,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"what physical, emotional, and social risks will the woman face"
Sunshine,3560,25,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,people prefer judgment over understanding because judgment feels easier
Sunshine,3560,26,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"introspection requires effort, and compassion requires complexity—two things society often avoids"
Sunshine,3560,27,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"if morality is measured by harm done, abortion may not be a sin at all"
Sunshine,3560,28,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,it may be a reflection of a society that fails its people so deeply that they must make decisions the world refuses to understand
Sunshine,3560,29,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"sa totoo lang, mas madali para sa lipunan na manisi kaysa kumilala ng sistematikong pagkukulang"
Sunshine,3560,30,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,we condemn individuals because it distracts us from confronting the bigger failure—the environment that gave them no safe path
Sunshine,3560,31,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,the real sin might not be in the act of abortion but in the society that makes someone carry the weight alone
Sunshine,3560,32,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"a society that romanticizes suffering, worships conformity, and punishes anyone who chooses survival over tradition"
Sunshine,3560,33,zbloodhail,,180.0,ltbx,"a society that has the audacity to moralize while refusing to provide support, empathy, or alternatives"
Sunshine,3561,1,somepeaceofmind,,180.0,ltbx,fuck men

Sunshine,3676,1,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a feat for Philippine cinema
Sunshine,3676,2,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,It tackles a topic most are scared to produce and it was written WELL
Sunshine,3676,3,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"Yes, without the poverty porn or political porn most films of ours subtexts"
Sunshine,3676,4,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,There are characters that are REAL
Sunshine,3676,5,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,Not written to tell unjustly-unrelated issues but to support the story itself
Sunshine,3676,6,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"And so, characters that are in poverty aren’t written to convey another message, rather to stand with what the film is about in the first place"
Sunshine,3676,7,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,This film is easily the one of the best written films of all time in our history
Sunshine,3676,8,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"Not only does it tell a beautiful picture of a character undergoing such a life-turning “accident” but how it tells it psychologically, and powerfully"
Sunshine,3676,9,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"It never let go of what it portrays nor does it settle for a scene that would bring in viewers, it’s written SO realistically that you’d forget it’s a movie"
Sunshine,3676,10,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"A quick one to point out is Sunshine texting her bestfriend, at the time she needs support the most, even if she’s disappointed for losing contact with her, she still texts out of fear, and that’s something i’m sure plenty of people have done"
Sunshine,3676,11,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"Those text messages are so real, raw and incredibly well-written too"
Sunshine,3676,12,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,The whole story is an absolute masterclass of writing a film straightforwardly without losing the essence of what it is
Sunshine,3676,13,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s a display of perfect world-building, from the story of her boyfriend, the realistic response from him to the story of the tindera, who without building a relationship, completely makes sense of the film"
Sunshine,3676,14,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"Even built a subtext of a no nonsense coach that adds to fear, support, motive and regret of the main character"
Sunshine,3676,15,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,I can tell you all about the beautiful writing but this would be too long
Sunshine,3676,16,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,Let’s get to the cinematography
Sunshine,3676,17,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"Well, it’s good"
Sunshine,3676,18,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"Definitely better than most films, it’s quite obvious that certain camera works and shots aren’t just to finish the scene but is chosen to look good while portraying a scene nicely"
Sunshine,3676,19,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"There’s a lot of cues that whispers visually, like how she prays with bars infront of her, evoking the feeling of our character not FEELING or BEING welcome inside the church"
Sunshine,3676,20,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,Shot-selections like those sre essential and quite reliable to make a scene impactful so i’m incredibly proud they excerted better effort to make this film the best it could possibly be
Sunshine,3676,21,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"Wouldn’t say it’s a strong suit, but this fil is definitely visually well-made"
Sunshine,3676,22,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"I’ve always seen Maris Racal as a great actress before this, now she’s PHENOMENAL one and is one of the best in the industry right now"
Sunshine,3676,23,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"The talent to portray talent and skill alone, is something most actors/actresses not only have the chance to audition for BUT absolutely nails from the first to the last second of the film"
Sunshine,3676,24,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"There’s a Piolo Pascual jumpscare here, Elijah Canlas KILLS it AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN"
Sunshine,3676,25,melthing,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is great, it’s amazingly told through emotions and a bit of a psychologically present engagement to allow interpretations of viewers be as wide as it can"
Sunshine,3678,1,finnchy,,120.0,ltbx,"im very happy abt this movie's existence, though honestly the emotional beats feel lacking"
Sunshine,3678,2,finnchy,,120.0,ltbx,"i feel like the movie's story could have been written better, bcs in my perspective it felt a bit boring and predictable"
Sunshine,3678,3,finnchy,,120.0,ltbx,"being just predictable would have been fine, some movies can be rly good even tho you know what happens, but i j couldn't rly get with it because i was bored"
Sunshine,3678,4,finnchy,,120.0,ltbx,"and some scenes felt very, well, how do i describe it"

Sunshine,3741,3,jzztinn,,200.0,ltbx,Nakakalungkot lang isipin na mas nabigyan pa ng pansin ang isyu niya noong nakaraang taon kaysa sa pelikulang ito
Sunshine,3741,4,jzztinn,,200.0,ltbx,Pero nandito ako ngayon to separate the work from the artist
Sunshine,3741,5,jzztinn,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa totoo lang, everything in this movie reflects everything about this country—poor facilities in public hospitals, exploitation of children, rape, konserbatibong pag-iisip ng karamihan, teenage pregnancy, at kung paano tumakbo sa responsibilidad ang ilang kalalakihan"

Sunshine,3784,3,pagnilayan,,160.0,ltbx,"it's well acted and really cohesive with an ending people would find controversial (like who would explain their dream to an illusory fetus so they understand why they're being aborted) but yes, there's so much frustration here, in the system, and i'm glad we didn't get a cookie cutter ending where she decides to become a human incubator just because the pastor's family said so"

Sunshine,3787,7,ellacakes,,200.0,ltbx,"Legalizing abortion doesn’t mean encouraging all pregnant women to get one—it means giving women safe options if they don’t want to keep that little chunk of blood cells in their body, instead of forcing them into unsafe methods that could be fatal"

Sunshine,3793,3,aewrxli,,160.0,ltbx,abortion shouldn't be a debate; it is a choice that a woman should be able to make

Sunshine,3797,1,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is one of those rare Filipino films that refuses to look away
Sunshine,3797,2,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,"Instead of sugarcoating or romanticizing the world its characters inhabit, it confronts the audience with the uncomfortable truths we collectively sidestep—the toxic mindsets we inherit, the social issues we normalize, and the moral rigidity we mistake for virtue"
Sunshine,3797,3,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,What makes the film remarkable is its honesty
Sunshine,3797,4,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,"It acknowledges how deeply ingrained complacency is in our culture, how we often witness injustice, misogyny, or dysfunction and simply shrug, labeling it as “ganun talaga"
Sunshine,3797,5,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,” Sunshine exposes that mentality for what it is: a quiet violence that enables suffering
Sunshine,3797,6,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,"The film does not preach; it simply presents the weight of these realities with clarity and emotional intelligence, letting the audience feel the consequences of silence and inaction"
Sunshine,3797,7,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,Its commentary on anti-abortion attitudes is especially bold for Philippine cinema
Sunshine,3797,8,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,"Rather than reducing the debate to dogma or melodrama, the film shows how anti-abortion rhetoric becomes a peril for women; not just physically, but emotionally, socially, and economically"
Sunshine,3797,9,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,"It reveals how denying reproductive autonomy restricts their futures, limits their ambitions, and punishes them for choices men are rarely held accountable for"
Sunshine,3797,10,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine portrays this with nuance: the internal conflict, the fear of judgment, the systemic lack of support, and the complete absence of safe options"
Sunshine,3797,11,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,"The film understands that this isn’t just a “moral issue”—it’s a structural one, tied to poverty, misogyny, and societal expectations about what women owe to the world"
Sunshine,3797,12,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,"Ultimately, Sunshine is more than a movie; it’s a critique of the culture that raised us"
Sunshine,3797,13,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,"It forces us to ask why we maintain harmful traditions, why morality is weaponized against women, and why we accept inequality as a norm"
Sunshine,3797,14,aijikken,,200.0,ltbx,"Its power lies in its refusal to let the audience remain comfortable, and in reminding us that the first step toward progress is learning to confront what we’ve been taught to ignore"

Sunshine,3799,10,sxdyey,,200.0,ltbx,"But above all, very important yung conversation na binubuksan ng Sunshine"
Sunshine,3799,11,sxdyey,,200.0,ltbx,"Abortion is a difficult, nuanced topic—one that should be openly discussed not just within families, but within our society and government"
Sunshine,3799,12,sxdyey,,200.0,ltbx,"And I firmly believe na choosing yourself first, your success, your safety, your future matters just as much"
Sunshine,3799,13,sxdyey,,200.0,ltbx,"AND, women should be able to decide for themselves: their body, their rules"
Sunshine,3799,14,sxdyey,,200.0,ltbx,"This isn't a simple issue, and the film treats it with the depth and humanity it deserves"
Sunshine,3799,15,sxdyey,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is indeed a courageous and a necessary film that everyone should watch

Sunshine,3822,2,lyrhsq_,,160.0,ltbx,"Lalo na si Miggy, yung uncle, at doctor na ayaw asikasuhin yung 13 yrs old"
Sunshine,3823,1,davoarid,,140.0,ltbx,"More didactic than her previous films, but this is still a great “social issues” drama (albeit one with some magical realist touches), with a moving central performance"
Sunshine,3823,2,davoarid,,140.0,ltbx,"In terms of “abortion movies,” it really does a great job of making its case"
Sunshine,3823,3,davoarid,,140.0,ltbx,"For a teenage gymnast, carrying a baby to term really does completely remove that path as a possibility for her life—that dream just gets immediately destroyed, in a way that (obviously) won’t happen for the baby’s father, and it’s why it’s so essential to this film’s success that Jadaone so skillfully captures the tactile and practical *reality* of Sunshine’s body in the gymnastic scenes: that body, with its graceful and athletic movements, that she has spent her entire life molding for this sole purpose of Olympic gold, and it will go away, permanently, if she doesn’t have an abortion"
Sunshine,3823,4,davoarid,,140.0,ltbx,I also think Jadaone does a good job of avoiding deck-stacking
Sunshine,3823,5,davoarid,,140.0,ltbx,"Yes, the pro-life nurse who castigates Sunshine is portrayed as a witch, but the saleswoman who gives her the abortifacients is also shown to be a greedy haggler herself"
Sunshine,3823,6,davoarid,,140.0,ltbx,"And while the two male figures pressuring her to have the baby (her boyfriend and her boyfriend’s father) both make specious and insincere cases, it is again to Jadaone’s credit that she cast two dynamic male performers for these roles (Elijah Canlas and Pio Pascual—whom I didn’t recognize in a straight-up “Dad” role, after decades playing the heart-throb"
Sunshine,3823,7,davoarid,,140.0,ltbx,)…this is one of those reviews where in the process of writing it I’ve realized I liked the movie a lot more than I thought I did while the credits were rolling
Sunshine,3823,8,davoarid,,140.0,ltbx,"Jadaone, she’ll do that to you"
Sunshine,3824,1,lexiiiyz,,200.0,ltbx,"tangina ni miggy at nung tito, kalalaking tao humihinga"

Sunshine,3824,5,lexiiiyz,,200.0,ltbx,not to mention that it’s also very anti-poor lol
Sunshine,3824,6,lexiiiyz,,200.0,ltbx,"it’s heartbreaking that women are not given the choice or freedom to choose and that something that is meant to protect their health becomes a source of shame and risk simply because the system refuses to provide proper options, and society forces them into thinking na “pregnancies are blessings” when that is not the case for everyone"
Sunshine,3824,7,lexiiiyz,,200.0,ltbx,and to anyone that have the mindset na “what if ‘yan ang next president ng pilipinas” dude fuck you and your guilt tripping ass

Sunshine,3838,1,raven_hoodie,,160.0,ltbx,"One of the biggest factors holding back the Philippines from being as progressive as our neighboring countries like China and Japan is our deep entanglement with religion—Christianity, in particular"
Sunshine,3838,2,raven_hoodie,,160.0,ltbx,"As much as faith shapes our culture, it also becomes a hindrance to national progress when religious beliefs are imposed on matters that should prioritize the welfare and rights of all citizens"
Sunshine,3838,3,raven_hoodie,,160.0,ltbx,"Imagine how much better our society could be if we allowed personal freedoms and evidence-based policies to guide our decisions, instead of insisting on religious doctrine as the standard for everyone"
Sunshine,3838,4,raven_hoodie,,160.0,ltbx,The movie portrayed this reality so powerfully
Sunshine,3838,5,raven_hoodie,,160.0,ltbx,"It addressed so many issues in one narrative—how women are often the ones who suffer the most under a misogynistic system, how men can easily walk away from responsibilities while women cannot, and how horrifying it is that young girls, even minors, can be raped and then forced to bear a child"
Sunshine,3838,6,raven_hoodie,,160.0,ltbx,These are the consequences of a society that refuses to give women full autonomy over their own bodies
Sunshine,3838,7,raven_hoodie,,160.0,ltbx,I truly hope more people come to realize the importance of allowing women to make decisions for themselves by legalizing abortion
Sunshine,3838,8,raven_hoodie,,160.0,ltbx,Every woman deserves the right to choose what happens to her own body

Sunshine,3857,1,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"I may be on the unpopular side of this: I want to love this so badly but for some reason, I can't help to mull-on & pinpoint some details lacked for me and thought it needed more revising story-wise"
Sunshine,3857,2,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,I am not hating on this
Sunshine,3857,3,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"In fact, I actually like several parts of the movie"
Sunshine,3857,4,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,I think it's fair to say (and undeniably so) that this is an important and a refreshing story on what's the take of abortion & body autonomy here in the Philippines and I do appreciate this movie for that
Sunshine,3857,5,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"(I added the half star plus because it still is an important movie)I want to love this movie (but only like it) because I thought it obviously have such a great potential to be ""a great movie"" on most aspects"
Sunshine,3857,6,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"What holds me back is the writing, story-wise"
Sunshine,3857,7,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,It started really strong and direct to the point which I really liked
Sunshine,3857,8,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"By the next part, we'd see a little girl who follows Sunshine"
Sunshine,3857,9,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"At first it seems to me that it could be her inner child or her unborn future child so it confused me a bit (most especially on the part where Sunshine was rushed to the hospital, we'd see a blood on her crotch area as well)"
Sunshine,3857,10,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,This device they used provided a bit of comic relief in the movie which I thought is cute and actually can be an effective way to delve deeper sentimentally because its so personal
Sunshine,3857,11,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"However, I came to learn (through online reading) that she is indeed her unborn future child (bc of Ariana disappearing)"
Sunshine,3857,12,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"To be honest, I couldn't finalize my thoughts on this whether I like it or not because with that in mind, the mix message does confuse some a bit on whether or not it's a ""pro-life"" but I guess that could also be the point that it is complicated"
Sunshine,3857,13,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"Afterall, Sunshine did kept coming back to the church scenes and this can represent a lot of women who faces/d the same situation"
Sunshine,3857,14,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,I just thought the movie might have to clarify in telling that message
Sunshine,3857,15,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"I also much prefer her being Sunshine's inner child (which could be a ""tangible"" reminder on what the whole movie is all about, Sunshine taking control of her own life and the dream of being a national athlete ever since she's a child)"
Sunshine,3857,16,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"But the line ""Gets ko na"" have such a great impact on people because of its ""casualness"" but its the words that has a really heavy weight on it that I thought is effective to pull people's heartstrings in"
Sunshine,3857,17,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"Another aspect of the movie that kinda lacked for me which is, I think a big part of it: I want to see how much Sunshine wants it by seeing her own training to be a gymnast"
Sunshine,3857,18,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,What does she do every day as a training athlete
Sunshine,3857,19,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,How does she balance everything in her life-- being a sister/aunt/student/friend/a woman in general while also being a training athlete
Sunshine,3857,20,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,What do you to do train as a gymnast
Sunshine,3857,21,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"How heavy does it weigh on her that she's truly doing every thing she can to be in olympics and be a great gymnast, what does it look like"
Sunshine,3857,22,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,I wished she saw that a bit (even just in a montage) before or during the moment she found out she got pregnant
Sunshine,3857,23,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"I want to see her really work hard and see how much blood, sweat, and tears and really feel and see that ""goddamn it i want this so bad"" and not just tell it"
Sunshine,3857,24,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,I guess what I want to say is that I want more training scenes too because I am also interested in watching gymnasts do their thing haha
Sunshine,3857,25,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,I also thought that by the 3/4 part of the movie where we do meet Ariana is kinda took a different turn for the movie
Sunshine,3857,26,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"I am not sure if it is necessary that we meet another kid (Ariana, not Mary Grace) and that maybe without that, they could still end up getting the same storyline/result (though don't get me wrong, I did like Ariana, i think she's fab)"
Sunshine,3857,27,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"It also didn't do much impact on Sunshine's decision but rather it does prove how fucked up it is that this happen in reality and how shitty it is again that we don't have much (legal and safe, known) access to women's sexual and reproductive health services, let alone being a woman/person who's forced into something they aren't ready to be/never wanted be in the first place"
Sunshine,3857,28,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"More so, the visuals and cinematography, can't deny that it is beautiful, that's a given"
Sunshine,3857,29,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"Acting is amazing, no notes no doubt"
Sunshine,3857,30,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"A little predictable on emphasizing on the Manila landscape and scenery although it is still beautiful to look at (especially considering to people haven't been to Manila/Philippines, at least they'd get the gist of it even though its not all picturesque all the time)"
Sunshine,3857,31,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,I especially appreciate the movie getting in deep and showing the grim & messy ways of taking different methods of abortion
Sunshine,3857,32,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,I thought its very important to see how harrowing and fucking hard/harsh/unfair/dangerous it is that women have to/had no choice to do experiences like these
Sunshine,3857,33,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,I only wished that they showed the method of when Sunshine made an appointment for that Doctor Helena because maybe it could also show that abortion could also have safe and harmless way that would make people feel less wary and scared of it and maybe even talk about it
Sunshine,3857,34,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"With all that, in conclusion I think I do like this movie"
Sunshine,3857,35,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,"It is an important movie to exists especially at our modern times, it's long overdue that we finally talk about this here in our country"
Sunshine,3857,36,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,I hope we keep talking about it because it is necessary for us we want to keep fighting for women's rights
Sunshine,3857,37,jazsisante7,,140.0,ltbx,I don't love it but I do like it and I appreciate it for what it did
Sunshine,3858,1,king_bob777,,120.0,ltbx,Loved how the filmmaker showcased different situations that emphasize the importance of the *legalization of abortion and also showing the weaponization of religion against it that just guilt trip women into submitting themselves to motherhood
Sunshine,3858,2,king_bob777,,120.0,ltbx,So brave and hopefully opened the mind of some Filipinos

Sunshine,3871,1,jcnro,,180.0,ltbx,This is why we need to legalize abortion in the Philippines
Sunshine,3872,1,sunrisebefore,,120.0,ltbx,i love the symbolism but the ending couldve been more dramatic
Sunshine,3873,1,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,this is what the filipino people need to see more often
Sunshine,3873,2,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,"it might be obscure for some, but it is timely and important"
Sunshine,3873,3,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,"teenage mothers are often judged for carrying a child; whether they keep it or not, judgement will still eye on them"
Sunshine,3873,4,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,the guilt of their conscience will still haunt and hunt them
Sunshine,3873,5,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,"but we never get to see their point of view, we only see them for the mistakes they have done"
Sunshine,3873,6,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,where is that energy when it comes to boys who choose to abandon the outcome of their bad decisions
Sunshine,3873,8,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,i love how this film doesn’t just show us the story of a teenage girl who got pregnant while chasing her dreams—it is a story of all the girls and women who are forced to carry a baggage they never asked for
Sunshine,3873,9,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,we saw their hardships and struggles
Sunshine,3873,10,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,it also shows us how flawed our system is and how hypocritical some religious people are
Sunshine,3873,11,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,this should be a wake up call
Sunshine,3873,12,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,the little girl (annika) doesn’t just represent sunshine’s unborn child—she also represents us
Sunshine,3873,13,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,we only see abortion and choosing oneself as something wrong and sinful because we are too blinded by what was merely taught to us
Sunshine,3873,14,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,we never get to see or feel what others feel
Sunshine,3873,15,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,"and once we do, we will understand them"
Sunshine,3873,16,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,that is when we will realize

Sunshine,3873,18,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,i also love that they chose manila as the setting of this film
Sunshine,3873,19,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,it might not be important but i think it is
Sunshine,3873,20,slimedeni,,200.0,ltbx,"manila is messy, scary, and it will kill you"

Sunshine,3874,4,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,htmlAntoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine has been one of our most anticipated local releases of the year and it does not disappoint
Sunshine,3874,5,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,"Emotionally charged and socially resonant, the film tackles teen pregnancy and the realities of limited reproductive rights in the Philippines with honesty and empathy"
Sunshine,3874,6,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,"While it may not offer clear-cut moral answers, Sunshine succeeds in revealing the real and painful stakes of becoming a young mother tackling equally both sides of the moral coin"
Sunshine,3874,7,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,National gymnast Sunshine (Maris Racal) has always dreamed of competing in the Olympics
Sunshine,3874,8,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,"With qualifiers fast approaching, she pushes her body to its limits until she suddenly faints during training"
Sunshine,3874,9,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,What she assumes is exhaustion from her intense regimen and strict diet turns out to be something far more life-altering: she is pregnant
Sunshine,3874,10,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,"At only 19 and with her lifelong dream on the line, Sunshine faces a bitter decision: keep the child and lose her final chance at the Olympics, or pursue an illegal abortion and grapple with the moral and emotional fallout"
Sunshine,3874,11,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,"As expected, Sunshine doesn’t shy away from tough conversations"
Sunshine,3874,12,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,"Its central dilemma is painfully relatable, regardless of where you stand on the right to choose in a predominantly Catholic country"
Sunshine,3874,13,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal is a revelation, delivering a nuanced and deeply human performance as a young athlete forced to confront consequences that will shape the rest of her life"
Sunshine,3874,14,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,"And while we won’t spoil where the story ultimately lands, the film takes a definitive stance without betraying the complexity of its subject matter"
Sunshine,3874,15,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,It was a balancing act handled with notable care
Sunshine,3874,16,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,What elevates Sunshine further is how vividly it captures the societal pressures and chaotic realities of Philippine society when it comes to the right to choose
Sunshine,3874,17,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,"The judgment, the ironies, the lack of support systems, everything feels painfully authentic and grounded"
Sunshine,3874,18,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,Where the film stumbles slightly is in its more fantastical elements
Sunshine,3874,19,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,"Though the intent behind these sequences is clear, they often feel out of place and not fully integrated into the narrative, appearing more convenient than cohesive"
Sunshine,3874,20,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,"Still, Sunshine is a compelling and important watch and not only for Maris Racal’s standout performance but for its bold and compassionate exploration of an issue that remains deeply relevant in modern Philippine society"
Sunshine,3874,21,reeladvicenet,,160.0,ltbx,It’s a film that provokes and ultimately shines
Sunshine,3875,1,syirxh,,200.0,ltbx,naiintindihan na ba ko
Sunshine,3875,2,syirxh,,200.0,ltbx,"loved the movie it tackled and open up so many topics, and it was very common problem in our country but we don't really talk about"
Sunshine,3876,1,bobbiebinges,,200.0,ltbx,and you know what
Sunshine,3876,2,bobbiebinges,,200.0,ltbx,"fuck them kids and fuck you tooooDe joke lang hehe, releasing this film in this political climate is insane, Antoinette Jadaone deserves her flowers for this film"
Sunshine,3876,3,bobbiebinges,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal also did a phenomenal job in portraying the titular character and so did the other actors
Sunshine,3876,4,bobbiebinges,,200.0,ltbx,"The story, though it can be a little ""in your face"" at times really drives the message home"
Sunshine,3876,5,bobbiebinges,,200.0,ltbx,I hope one day other people can get it too

Sunshine,3880,3,badjaja,,200.0,ltbx,"Kapag naman gusto mong kumawala sa idinidikta sayo ng relihiyon at ng konserbatibo nating lipunan, parang hindi tama na hindi ka kainin ng konsensya mo; dapat pa yatang lumuhod ka sa harapan nila kahit para sa ikabubuti mo naman ang magiging desisyon mo—parang mali pa sa mata nila na unahin mo ang sarili mo"
Sunshine,3880,4,badjaja,,200.0,ltbx,Kailanman ay hindi magiging pro-women ang kahit anumang sistema dito sa Pilipinas kung patuloy na babahiran ng relihiyon ang mga batas na ipinapatupad
Sunshine,3880,5,badjaja,,200.0,ltbx,"Dahil dito, imbes na bumuo tayo ng isang lipunan kung saan walang babae ang kinakailangang dumaan sa butas ng karayom para magkaroon ng access sa isang serbisyo na DAPAT ay parte ng healthcare system natin, we continue to condition women into shaming themselves"
Sunshine,3880,6,badjaja,,200.0,ltbx,"Walang Sunshine, o kahit sinumang babae, ang dapat na isakripisyo ang kanyang mga pangarap"

Sunshine,3887,1,lookitsaworm,,200.0,ltbx,felt this film deeply in my soul bc: count 1: im a woman in a predominantly conservative country count 2: ive had a pregnancy scare count 3: same financial situation as sunshine count 4: film set in the areas i frequent
Sunshine,3888,1,vicsvaporub,,160.0,ltbx,this feels very similar to brocka in that it portrays manila as a city full of hardship and loneliness that can leave you so disillusioned and alienated; and where hope and humanity exist on the fringes of it
Sunshine,3888,2,vicsvaporub,,160.0,ltbx,"it's a working-class story with working-class sentiments that fully takes on its own identity because jadaone is able to portray such familar elements in a way that feel completely isolating; the interiors of jeepneys, tricycles, shabby motels, clinics — everything feels so alien"
Sunshine,3888,3,vicsvaporub,,160.0,ltbx,"which, i guess, offers many people unfamiliar with what these woman go through a much-needed perspective on the importance of dignity and bodily autonomy and how violent, horrible men try to take that away from many women"
Sunshine,3888,4,vicsvaporub,,160.0,ltbx,"i think it's also worth noting that religion and patriarchy play such a prominent role here in oppression; jadaone laser-focused on placing religious beliefs and preconceived notions about abortion in the spotlight, all the more affected by teenage pregnancy and how religion has kind of shaped the way many filipinos treat abortion as something so taboo and inhuman that they completely forget how it affects the mother"
Sunshine,3888,5,vicsvaporub,,160.0,ltbx,"and it's brought to life by a really incredible maris racal; shaped by all the adversity — the kind of performance that requires you to bare your soul to the audience, to beg them to see the humanity behind the people suffering from religious oppression, and why access to abortion services — even in a heavily catholic country — is of utmost importance"

Sunshine,3928,1,sircylovesyou,,200.0,ltbx,Women in the Philippines continue to grapple with deeply rooted issues such as teenage pregnancy which is made even more complex by the country’s predominantly Catholic identity
Sunshine,3928,2,sircylovesyou,,200.0,ltbx,"The moral codes and expectations instilled in us from childhood often determine whether society views abortion as a sinful act or a necessary choice, and this cultural tension becomes the silent force shaping many young women’s lives"
Sunshine,3928,3,sircylovesyou,,200.0,ltbx,"In the film, Maris Racal embodies this struggle with striking emotional clarity"
Sunshine,3928,4,sircylovesyou,,200.0,ltbx,She carries the weight of a decision that no young woman should have to make alone: the impossible choice between holding on to her dream of becoming an Olympian or confronting the life-altering reality of an unexpected pregnancy
Sunshine,3928,5,sircylovesyou,,200.0,ltbx,"Her performance is powerful not because it dramatizes the dilemma, but because it mirrors the experiences of countless Filipinas whose voices are often dismissed or shamed into silence"
Sunshine,3928,6,sircylovesyou,,200.0,ltbx,"What elevates the film is how it frames her situation not as a moral failure, but as a human story: one shaped by fear, hope, societal pressure, and the search for agency"
Sunshine,3928,7,sircylovesyou,,200.0,ltbx,"Through Racal’s nuanced portrayal, the narrative exposes the cultural contradictions we live with: a society that celebrates the achievements of young women yet imposes rigid expectations on their bodies and choices"
Sunshine,3928,8,sircylovesyou,,200.0,ltbx,"The film invites the audience to move beyond judgment and recognize the quiet courage required to stand at the crossroads of identity, aspiration, and responsibility"
Sunshine,3928,9,sircylovesyou,,200.0,ltbx,"In grounding a personal crisis within the broader context of Philippine social norms, the film becomes more than a character study; it becomes a commentary on how we, as a society, often fail to extend empathy to young women navigating impossible circumstances"
Sunshine,3928,10,sircylovesyou,,200.0,ltbx,"And in that sense, Maris does not just act the role; she embodies a truth many are too uncomfortable to confront"
Sunshine,3929,2,marlboroblast,,200.0,ltbx,"it's hard being a woman, especially if you're a woman in the philippines"

Sunshine,4022,4,avocado_23,,200.0,ltbx,"Nakakalungkot lang kasi nung mga panahon na ‘yon ang tanging alam ko lang ay kasalanan ang gusto niya mangyare, pero habang tumatanda ako dun ko mas maiintindihan"
Sunshine,4023,1,hsaay,,200.0,ltbx,this movie reminds me of black swan
Sunshine,4023,2,hsaay,,200.0,ltbx,i love it
Sunshine,4024,1,kaiaiur,,200.0,ltbx,"isang mahigpit na yakap, sunshine"
Sunshine,4024,2,kaiaiur,,200.0,ltbx,"ipinakita ng pelikulang ito kung bakit ang pagbabawal sa aborsyon ay hindi kailanman nagpapababa ng bilang ng mga nagpapagawa nito :) sa halip, itinutulak lang nito ang mga tao sa mapanganib na paraan"
Sunshine,4024,3,kaiaiur,,200.0,ltbx,at doon nagsisimula ang tunay na trahedya
Sunshine,4024,4,kaiaiur,,200.0,ltbx,abortion is healthcare
Sunshine,4024,5,kaiaiur,,200.0,ltbx,it is a right
Sunshine,4024,6,kaiaiur,,200.0,ltbx,"and the choice to bear a child is central to a woman’s life, her dignity, and her very future"
Sunshine,4024,7,kaiaiur,,200.0,ltbx,"it is a choice that belongs to her, and only her"
Sunshine,4025,1,018jpg,,200.0,ltbx,Where do I even begin
Sunshine,4025,2,018jpg,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine feels painfully relevant in a country with high rates of teenage pregnancy, yet where discussions about sex education, abortion, and women’s reproductive rights remain heavily stigmatized"
Sunshine,4025,3,018jpg,,200.0,ltbx,Being a predominantly Catholic country keeps us from moving forward
Sunshine,4025,4,018jpg,,200.0,ltbx,"Silence, shame, and Catholic guilt block real conversations about sex and autonomy"
Sunshine,4025,5,018jpg,,200.0,ltbx,And women end up paying the price
Sunshine,4025,6,018jpg,,200.0,ltbx,One of the scenes that struck me and honestly infuriated me was when the doctor told Sunshine to ask…
Sunshine,4026,1,byches,,160.0,ltbx,5 stars if they didn't give the unborn children a voice
Sunshine,4027,1,riyuh,,180.0,ltbx,"this reminds us that a woman’s body is not a public debate, and no one gets to dictate her future except her"
Sunshine,4028,1,tehmote,,180.0,ltbx,watched again with my besties (fee & allona)
Sunshine,4029,1,direkkikay,,180.0,ltbx,ang lala ng iyak ko putangina kayong mga lalaki kayo

Sunshine,4031,1,aikaspace,,200.0,ltbx,"gets kita, Sunshine"
Sunshine,4032,1,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,"Finally had a chance to watch this, i was meant to watch this when it was showing at the cinemas but so busy until recently saw news that it was gonna come out on Netflix so i was elated"
Sunshine,4032,3,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,"I like it so much, i love the cast in this film, and i love seeing this kind of quality in Filipino movies which is super rare these days"
Sunshine,4032,4,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,"The story is about a young woman who has a dream that she pursued her whole life and suddenly she becomes pregnant which risks this dream, and now she has to weigh everything carefully because either which choice she pick will be life-changing"
Sunshine,4032,5,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,The whole movie revolves around that and we get to be introduced to the characters and the environment around her that is essential and will influence the choice she will make
Sunshine,4032,6,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,"Here we get to see a real picture even though the story is fictional, as filipinos you could almost grasp the realness out of this film and say, this is the REALITY but we don't have to embrace it, WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT"
Sunshine,4032,7,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,"As a man, I always believed that i am no position to speak about what women should and shouldn't do about their bodies, but will absolutely support the concept of abortion"
Sunshine,4032,8,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,"When we speak about abortion in a country that is like the Philippines, that is so centered on religion, abortion becomes a taboo, illegal and unethical"
Sunshine,4032,9,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,"We also see these professionals, government leaders that support this kind of ideology that abortion is bad blah blah blah"
Sunshine,4032,10,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,"This film is a great commentary and an eye opener to what young women and women in general what they go through, and that abortion should become an option for all women in our society"
Sunshine,4032,11,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,"I will just make it clear that i think this film is not pro abortion or anti life, without directly stating it, the film focuses on making better decisions, the importance of protection, sex is more common than we think which is ironic in the Philippines that is so religious but that’s ok, this country just needs proper education and thats it"
Sunshine,4032,13,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,"If you are going to argue with me about me being ok about abortion or use of protection, I’m going to tell you this, how dare you bring a life in this world, in this country that cant do anything about poverty, cant do anything about corrupt politicians, cant vote right, doesn't have an accessible healthcare and on top of that, if you’re a man, stfu, and if you’re a woman, who is not ready, physically, mentally and financially, Ari and that young girl doesn’t deserve to live like that, on the streets or getting abused"
Sunshine,4032,14,jazzphen,,200.0,ltbx,"But if you are, financially stable, mentally stable and physically stable with a nice and healthy environment to grow a living thing then go fucking crazy"

Sunshine,4048,1,pbndct,,200.0,ltbx,sobrang ganda ng symbolism with annika (yung batang babae) which they left for the audience to interpret who (or what) she really is
Sunshine,4048,2,pbndct,,200.0,ltbx,i personally believe it's those standards set by the society na kinalakihan natin which became part of sunshine's conscience
Sunshine,4048,3,pbndct,,200.0,ltbx,"it's those beliefs thrown into us during childhood that subconsciously shape the way we think and make decisions, and yung pagpigil ni annika kay sunshine and then eventually saying ""gets ko na"" is sunshine finally breaking free from the societal standards"
Sunshine,4048,4,pbndct,,200.0,ltbx,from the stereotypes

Sunshine,4053,1,vynzntzrte,,200.0,ltbx,women should not be ashamed of and scared for the choices they want and have to make for their own good
Sunshine,4053,2,vynzntzrte,,200.0,ltbx,the way this movie makes you feel uncomfortable in some scenes is very effective (i
Sunshine,4053,4,vynzntzrte,,200.0,ltbx,that scene with the doctor after sunshine’s first attempt)
Sunshine,4053,5,vynzntzrte,,200.0,ltbx,"it greatly shows the sad reality we are currently living in, and i am deeply impressed how this movie moved me emotionally"
Sunshine,4053,6,vynzntzrte,,200.0,ltbx,"i could say a lot about this film, especially how it was well produced and written, but i am still speechless and in awe of how great it is"

Sunshine,4055,3,talesbymei,,200.0,ltbx,"also, i love how this isn't your typical pinoy show where its either a love story or palaging kawawa or inosente keneme yung babae"
Sunshine,4055,4,talesbymei,,200.0,ltbx,"really, really out of words, but i love it"
Sunshine,4056,1,sugiartha,,120.0,ltbx,"Meskipun bagus, cmn muak banget anj cerita kek gini, di sekeliling rumah yg masih 1 gang aja udh 3 orang begini"
Sunshine,4057,1,filoconnoisseur,,160.0,ltbx,"In spite of her past controversies, Maris Racal's performance in this film is the very reason why she remains in the spotlight"
Sunshine,4057,2,filoconnoisseur,,160.0,ltbx,Her acting as Sunshine is spectacular
Sunshine,4057,3,filoconnoisseur,,160.0,ltbx,"The story requires someone who is capable of letting the viewers feel the heaviness of her pain, the agony, and the hope of standing up for yourself and for what you want, and she made us feel all of that"
Sunshine,4057,4,filoconnoisseur,,160.0,ltbx,"And though I may not completely agree with everything that's pointed out here, I really admire Jadaone's attempt and bravery at addressing such a taboo topic, not just in the Philippines but the rest of the world"
Sunshine,4057,5,filoconnoisseur,,160.0,ltbx,Being prayerful and always going to church do not give us the right to see ourselves as being more morally upright than others
Sunshine,4057,6,filoconnoisseur,,160.0,ltbx,"When you put all of that aside, Sunshine is just a teenager who regretfully made a mistake and who made a decision for herself, stood up for what she wanted, and spared the child from the resentment of a mom from being robbed of her own dreams, and of leading her to what could possibly be a miserable life"
Sunshine,4057,7,filoconnoisseur,,160.0,ltbx,"She knows she could be ridiculed for that decision, but she lived according to her own terms anyway"
Sunshine,4057,8,filoconnoisseur,,160.0,ltbx,"And we know that in the end, she is happy, and that's all that matters"
Sunshine,4058,1,amigagwapa,,160.0,ltbx,You’d know toxic pinoy kasama mo if they were rooting against Sunshine the whole time

Sunshine,4069,10,walingwaling,,200.0,ltbx,"pero sa kabila ng tulong, nariyan ang mga babaeng nakakulong pa rin sa lumang paniniwala: si doktorang victim-blamer at relihiyosa, yung nanay na nagpapadala sa lalaki niyang kapatid kapalit ng kaligtasan ng kanyang babaeng anak"
Sunshine,4069,11,walingwaling,,200.0,ltbx,"sa lipunang matagal nang pinagsasamantalahan ang kababaihan, nakakalungkot isipin na nasanay na tayo sa ganitong galaw"

Sunshine,4074,1,patroclues,,140.0,ltbx,i get a lot of the criticisms with the film and i do think it could have examined more without trying to be palatable to religious filipinos but i do hope the message is clear to anyone still in doubt of the rights women deserve in this country
Sunshine,4075,1,nicnoks,,180.0,ltbx,i kept thinking about this after watching it the first time

Sunshine,4077,2,flreu,,200.0,ltbx,The film Sunshine (2024) resonated with me because it honestly depicts how unforgiving reality can be
Sunshine,4077,3,flreu,,200.0,ltbx,"It shows how quickly people judge young women, often before they even have a chance to breathe or ask for help"
Sunshine,4077,4,flreu,,200.0,ltbx,"The film also makes painfully clear how the lack of reproductive rights pushes women toward risky, sometimes dangerous choices"
Sunshine,4077,5,flreu,,200.0,ltbx,"You can almost feel Sunshine being boxed in on all sides, not because she did anything wrong, but because society refuses to give her real options"
Sunshine,4077,6,flreu,,200.0,ltbx,"Women in the Philippines face judgment, limited choices, and immense pressure around pregnancy"
Sunshine,4077,7,flreu,,200.0,ltbx,And the film makes a point I strongly agree with: no government or religious institution should dictate what a woman does with her body
Sunshine,4077,8,flreu,,200.0,ltbx,"Those decisions belong to the person living that reality, not to people watching from a distance"
Sunshine,4077,9,flreu,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine made the right choice
Sunshine,4077,10,flreu,,200.0,ltbx,"Sobrang taboo sa Pilipinas ang usapang abortion, pero at least the child didn’t grow up feeling guilty or resenting their mother for what might have happened if they hadn’t been born"
Sunshine,4077,11,flreu,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s better for a child to know they were truly wanted, rather than feeling like the product of someone else’s dilemma"
Sunshine,4077,12,flreu,,200.0,ltbx,Constantly being told they’re a blessing can’t replace the sense of being genuinely chosen

Sunshine,4082,2,zinx_rinx,,120.0,ltbx,the movie is an eye-opener for all the pro-life who thinks abortion is ”just” a bad thing
Sunshine,4082,3,zinx_rinx,,120.0,ltbx,"they don’t think about the children who will grow up and live in this fuckass world, they’re the ones who are more invested in this matter when they clearly don’t care about the kids in the forecare system"
Sunshine,4082,4,zinx_rinx,,120.0,ltbx,"if the abortion will be legalized, it’s not mandatory you know"
Sunshine,4082,5,zinx_rinx,,120.0,ltbx,it’s a choice and shallow people who’s pro-life can’t etch that in their goddamn mind

Sunshine,4105,3,tsiknjoy,,160.0,ltbx,I also love how this movie portrayed women who chose to have an abortion dahil pinakita rito na hindi madaling desisyon ang magpalaglag; kitang-kita ang struggles ng isang babae na hindi pa ready na maging isang ina

Sunshine,4134,5,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,baka hindi na ako makasama sa olympics na ito- bakit
Sunshine,4134,6,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,' maybe there was this question of confusion na kahit siya hindi niya masagot
Sunshine,4134,7,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"na kahit saan siya dalhin ni kuya manong at ibaba dala dala parin niya talaga ito (yung bata)I loved how this film not only focuses on abortion rights, but also shows many of the real problems in the Philippines"
Sunshine,4134,8,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"Napakita talaga kung gaano ka–fucked up ang sistema ng mga hospital dito—kulang sa pasilidad, nagsisiksikan, at ang daming pwedeng mamatay dahil sa ganitong sistema"
Sunshine,4134,9,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"Sobrang nakakagalit isipin na sa hospital ka pa dapat may chance mabuhay, pero doon ka pa pwedeng bawian"
Sunshine,4134,10,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,It also shows the messed-up beliefs of people who think it’s “easy” to raise a child
Sunshine,4134,11,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,Yung mga nagsasabing “takot mo sa una lang ‘yan” at “biyaya ‘yan ng Panginoon
Sunshine,4134,12,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,” I’m not against their beliefs—they’re entitled to them—but I find it toxic
Sunshine,4134,13,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,Paano mo kayang sabihin sa isang tao na “biyaya” ito kung galing sa karumaldumal at walang kamalay-malay na kasalanan ng ibang tao
Sunshine,4134,14,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,Paano mo sasabihing tanggapin niya na lang ito
Sunshine,4134,15,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,I think not everything can be called a blessing
Sunshine,4134,16,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,And I don’t think it’s fair to say “binigay ito ng Diyos” kahit mali ang pinanggalingan
Sunshine,4134,17,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"When I watched it for the second time, ang dami ko talagang na-notice"
Sunshine,4134,18,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,Naging malaking tanong sa’kin kung *paano* at *saan* narealize ni Sunshine ang lahat
Sunshine,4134,19,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"At first, akala ko si Annika (yung batang babae) was her inner child someone who guides her, the version of herself who dreamed of becoming an Olympian but never got the chance"

Sunshine,4134,23,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,Naging question ko rin talaga kung paano kilala ni Sunshine si Ariana if kakakita niya lang dito
Sunshine,4134,25,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,And what Ariana said made sense
Sunshine,4134,26,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,May part sa movie na sinabi niya na ayaw niyang bumalik sa bahay dahil wala namang may pakialam sa kanya
Sunshine,4134,27,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"sabi ni Sunshine doon “Hindi, naguguluhan lang siya"
Sunshine,4134,28,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,” i think she was referring to marygrace
Sunshine,4134,29,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,The conversation between Ariana and Annika (the little girl) really altered my brain
Sunshine,4134,30,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,The way they pictured the life they could’ve had in a world they will never get to be part of sobrang bigat
Sunshine,4134,31,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"And that line, “Pangarap ko kung anong pangarap ni Sunshine,” grabe"

Sunshine,4134,33,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,tinanggap at inintindi niya ito ng buong buo mabuhay talaga ang pelikulang ito
Sunshine,4134,36,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"(ang sobrang daming yap)the last part, yung “gets ko na"
Sunshine,4134,37,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,” Those words explained everything

Sunshine,4134,41,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"But no—actually, she did"
Sunshine,4134,42,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"Because she gave Sunshine the world she always wanted, even if she couldn’t have it herself"
Sunshine,4134,43,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"""Pangarap ko kung anong pangarap niya""That “gets ko na” part really hit me"
Sunshine,4134,44,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,Sobrang bigat
Sunshine,4134,45,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"And right after that line,there was a cut showing Sunshine in this moment of relief and it says so much kahit na walang description kahit walang explanation"
Sunshine,4134,46,mswholovesfilm,,200.0,ltbx,"i love this film na gustong kong yakapin si sunshine at hawakan ang kamay niya at sabihing ""hindi mo ito kasalanan"""

Sunshine,4135,5,saboru,,180.0,ltbx,"i was curious because the premise kinda sold me off, but i don’t have any expectations on this film since i thought i could guess where the story ends"
Sunshine,4135,6,saboru,,180.0,ltbx,turns out i couldn’t
Sunshine,4135,7,saboru,,180.0,ltbx,"i can’t really say much because i don’t want to spoil anything and i just want people to experience the same awe as i did, so i’m just going to say this:sunshine isn’t about teenage pregnancy; it’s much beyond that"

Sunshine,4140,4,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"this movie depicted the struggles of being a woman—not just sexually, but in all aspects"
Sunshine,4140,5,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"women are expected to be perfect—capable of carrying the weight, not expected to make any mistakes despite everything hateful is being thrown at us"
Sunshine,4140,6,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,we are expected to meet and be the standard even if it is out of our capabilities
Sunshine,4140,8,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,babae tayo
Sunshine,4140,9,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"at kung ‘di man natin maabot ‘yon, isa tayong kahihiyan"
Sunshine,4140,10,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"dahil nga, mga babae tayo"
Sunshine,4140,11,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"kalaban natin ang relihiyon, gobyerno, at bansa na mapang-husga"
Sunshine,4140,12,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"ika nga ni coach, drown out the noise"
Sunshine,4140,13,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,but that is not the case
Sunshine,4140,14,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"even if you force yourself to be apathetic, you’ll still hear the the voices of the people"
Sunshine,4140,15,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"mga kabataan nga naman ngayon, hindi na makapag-pigilbawal ‘yan sa batas ng Diyoshindi ko ma-a-admit kaibigan mo dahil illegal ‘yonkung buntis ka, i’ll have to kick you out of my rosteranother thing i loved about this movie is that it was shot in manila and covereed many social issues—making it even more relatable to us filipino"
Sunshine,4140,16,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"especially when it comes to poverty, dito talaga natin masasabi na mahirap maging mahirap"
Sunshine,4140,17,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"the film showed the reality of life for those without privilege—struggling to find a tricycle, not having enough money for basic needs, and doing everything we can just to earn a little"
Sunshine,4140,18,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,even parents are driven to the point of selling their own children
Sunshine,4140,19,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"some men, on the other hand, can run away from everything"
Sunshine,4140,21,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,kasalanan pa rin natin ‘yang mga babae
Sunshine,4140,22,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"kesyo hindi tayo nananamit nang maayos, kesyo tayo raw ang may mali kahit sila naman ang tumakbo sa responsibilidad"
Sunshine,4140,23,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"here, i saw how cowardly some men can be—afraid to take responsibility for their wrongdoings, and always ready to cling to anyone who will shield them from consequences"
Sunshine,4140,24,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"lastly, i love how the kids represented their inner child—sunshine’s bata symbolizing her dream of becoming an olympian, while menggay’s bata represented the lgbtq community and her longing to get revenge on those who wronged her"
Sunshine,4140,25,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"each represented their dreams, no matter how impossible they seemed in their circumstances"
Sunshine,4140,26,rdileys,,200.0,ltbx,"each represented their dreams, clinging to whatever little piece of themselves the world hasn’t taken away"
Sunshine,4141,1,godziorro,,200.0,ltbx,i'm expecting na hindi ko sya mag-gets because i'm a guy pero feel na feel ko sa movie yung experience ng babaeng maagang nabuntis
Sunshine,4141,2,godziorro,,200.0,ltbx,"eto yung script na walang tapon kasi lahat ng binubuga nilang salita, may meaning talaga +++ the cinematography is SICK"
Sunshine,4141,3,godziorro,,200.0,ltbx,"overall 10/10, should be an eyeopener sa hayop na bansang to na malegal ang abortion"
Sunshine,4142,1,angiebellss,,160.0,ltbx,Mahirap maging babae
Sunshine,4143,1,hushofdawn,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine speaks a truth people keep avoiding: hindi kasalanan piliin ang sarili at mag desisyon para sa sarili mong katawan
Sunshine,4143,2,hushofdawn,,160.0,ltbx,"choosing abortion, or choosing not to become a mom, doesn’t make someone less human, less moral, or less worthykung tutuusin, abortion should be legal now, but the government and some people are so devoted to their religious beliefs, even though they have no idea what women go through"
Sunshine,4143,3,hushofdawn,,160.0,ltbx,"they keep saying it’s a sin, as if they themselves aren’t sinning every single day"
Sunshine,4143,4,hushofdawn,,160.0,ltbx,enough with imposing those beliefs on other people’s liveshampasin ko kayo nang bote riyan eh
Sunshine,4144,1,pauddng,,200.0,ltbx,pregnancy scares are scary… but being pregnant

Sunshine,4150,2,twolifetimes,,200.0,ltbx,you know a film is good when it has no performative and cringe dialogues to get the point across and sunshine delivers this
Sunshine,4150,3,twolifetimes,,200.0,ltbx,maiintindihan at mararamdaman ng target audience ng pelikulang ‘to ‘yung gusto iparating
Sunshine,4150,4,twolifetimes,,200.0,ltbx,sana nga ay mas maging bukas pa ang isip ng marami sa atin dahil malayo pa ang daang tatahakin natin pero nakaka-proud pa rin na malayo na rin ang nararating natin
Sunshine,4151,1,claude_beatrice,,200.0,ltbx,this film should be shown in schools with sex-ed teachers countering the misinformation around abortion
Sunshine,4151,2,claude_beatrice,,200.0,ltbx,"oh, a filipino like me can only dream"

Sunshine,4153,14,lhouzx,,200.0,ltbx,ano na
Sunshine,4153,15,lhouzx,,200.0,ltbx,"nowadays, some would shame and call you out after having a successful abortion saying that you will immediately gonna regret choosing the temporary pleasure, but mind them, mas pipiliin mo naman talaga ang saglit na kasiyahan mo knowing na ginawa mo ang dapat kaysa ipagpatuloy ang walang kasiguraduhan na panghabambuhay na pagdurusa ng bata"
Sunshine,4153,16,lhouzx,,200.0,ltbx,ayusin natin ang mga desisyon natin
Sunshine,4153,17,lhouzx,,200.0,ltbx,"we have already been through this, mas alam natin ang mundo kaysa dyan sa fetus na yan, mas alam din natin ang sitwasyon at buhay natin kaysa sa mga ibang tao dyan"
Sunshine,4153,18,lhouzx,,200.0,ltbx,sana ma-normalize na ang abortion

Sunshine,4157,1,skyrieo,,180.0,ltbx,she aborted and served ‼
Sunshine,4158,1,sushwaaa,,160.0,ltbx,"Whenever Sunshine waves around her colorful ribbon while flowing and gliding through the mat, it's not just a flawless routine at stake"
Sunshine,4158,2,sushwaaa,,160.0,ltbx,It's the little bit of life growing inside her
Sunshine,4158,3,sushwaaa,,160.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal anxiously walks through the streets and markets of Quiapo, looking for a way out in the form of illegal drugs hidden beside statues of Mama Mary"
Sunshine,4158,4,sushwaaa,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine knows what she wants —to be on the Olympic stage, but the world around her from the kid who knocked her up, to the saleslady who's ""helping"" her, to her sister who also got pregnant, may have different opinions"
Sunshine,4158,5,sushwaaa,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine stops by the church, pleading for clarity but also possibly for forgiveness and absolution"
Sunshine,4158,6,sushwaaa,,160.0,ltbx,"But a ghost in the form a kid that calls her a ""murderer"" haunts her the most, popping in and out like a conscience"
Sunshine,4158,7,sushwaaa,,160.0,ltbx,"She was nervously waiting to see what Sunshine would finally decide, and so was I"
Sunshine,4158,8,sushwaaa,,160.0,ltbx,Pelikulang Pinoy
Sunshine,4159,1,blanchettluvv,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine saying “hindi pa ako ready maging nanay” really hit me
Sunshine,4159,2,blanchettluvv,,180.0,ltbx,No woman should ever be forced into something she isn’t ready for
Sunshine,4159,3,blanchettluvv,,180.0,ltbx,And yes I agree with abortion
Sunshine,4159,4,blanchettluvv,,180.0,ltbx,Every woman has the right to choose what happens to her own body and her own life
Sunshine,4159,5,blanchettluvv,,180.0,ltbx,"No man, or anyone else, gets to decide that for us"
Sunshine,4159,6,blanchettluvv,,180.0,ltbx,And to the men who can’t even take responsibility for being a father
Sunshine,4159,7,blanchettluvv,,180.0,ltbx,Yeah… fck you
Sunshine,4160,1,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"""gets ko na""that line literally sent me into the abyss"
Sunshine,4160,2,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"going into the film, i was so confused about the little girl following sunshine"
Sunshine,4160,3,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"i thought she was sunshine’s inner child, like a guide through the mess, reminding her who she was and what she actually wanted"
Sunshine,4160,4,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"but when they introduced ariana, the kid that “bata” playmate during that night, everything started clicking"
Sunshine,4160,5,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,then the incident happened
Sunshine,4160,6,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"mary grace (rhed bustamante) tried to get an abortion, and her baby died"
Sunshine,4160,7,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"when we saw ariana recognize mary grace, and then later, at the hospital, the nurse announced the baby didn’t make it… ariana just disappeared"
Sunshine,4160,8,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"that’s when it hit me: ariana and bata was supposed to represent the baby, their baby"
Sunshine,4160,9,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,it felt ironic at first because you’re torn between “should i feel bad
Sunshine,4160,10,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,” and “should i feel sad about the literal premise of the film
Sunshine,4160,11,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"” but then bata said to sunshine, “gets ko na,” and the whole film just punched my soul"
Sunshine,4160,12,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"maris racal is easily one of the best actresses of this generation, and sunshine proves that"
Sunshine,4160,13,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"the film is raw, very indie pinoy cinema vibes, and it works"
Sunshine,4160,14,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"it also doesn’t shy away from the heavy stuff, like how brutal the philippines can be when judging teenage pregnancy and abortion"
Sunshine,4160,15,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"the shame, the gossip, the pressure to “keep it,” the lack of safe spaces… the film shows how hard it is for girls to make choices about their own bodies when everyone feels entitled to comment"
Sunshine,4160,16,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"i just kinda wish they explored sunshine being a public athlete more, like the public eye, the rumors, the judgment she’d face online and her community as the time goes by"
Sunshine,4160,17,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"the ending showing her making it to the sea games was nice, but i feel like addressing the backlash and the pressure could’ve made the story even stronger"
Sunshine,4160,18,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,overall: great film
Sunshine,4160,19,bizkunm,,120.0,ltbx,"beautiful, painful, and honest"

Sunshine,4166,3,clnrnth,,160.0,ltbx,"one would wonder, what would the child actually feel"

Sunshine,4166,5,clnrnth,,160.0,ltbx,also love the bits where it quietly proclaims: women help women and we've got each other's backs
Sunshine,4166,6,clnrnth,,160.0,ltbx,it highlights the reality that men are the true antagonists in every woman's story of suffering
Sunshine,4166,7,clnrnth,,160.0,ltbx,"maris racal's magnum opus, for now"

Sunshine,4176,2,itsnotdre,,140.0,ltbx,that was… a choice
Sunshine,4176,3,itsnotdre,,140.0,ltbx,"it’s a creative plot device, but the implication that she was aborting an actual human felt counterproductive"
Sunshine,4176,4,itsnotdre,,140.0,ltbx,"it was giving “did the child consent to the abortion ” when let’s bffr, there isn’t actually a child to begin with"
Sunshine,4176,5,itsnotdre,,140.0,ltbx,"we don’t need to feed into women’s already existing social guilt, it’s reason enough that she doesn’t want to be a mother and the film should’ve stuck w that"

Sunshine,4189,2,yunqoui,,200.0,ltbx,Truly a big eye-opener to many Filipinos
Sunshine,4189,3,yunqoui,,200.0,ltbx,Women carry a biological physical pain we are given the moment we are born
Sunshine,4189,4,yunqoui,,200.0,ltbx,"Period, childbirth, postpartum, etc"
Sunshine,4189,5,yunqoui,,200.0,ltbx,But we also carry the pain this world and men cause

Sunshine,4189,10,yunqoui,,200.0,ltbx,I think I will never be able to understand the logic of a world that demands strength from women and then punishes us for being strong
Sunshine,4189,11,yunqoui,,200.0,ltbx,"Like Sunshine and Menggay, a lot of women out there don't have choices"
Sunshine,4189,12,yunqoui,,200.0,ltbx,A lot of women are already deprived of basic rights before they even learn to speak

Sunshine,4193,2,lapizphos,,180.0,ltbx,"its so important to highlight how the philippine government, society, and healthcare system affect women’s lives, affect how women think, how they should live, and how they should dream"
Sunshine,4193,3,lapizphos,,180.0,ltbx,not only does it show the effects of a lack of legal abortion but also shows the effects of a lack of support for women healthcare in general
Sunshine,4193,4,lapizphos,,180.0,ltbx,i still shudder thinking about how there’s hospitals out there that share two people in one hospital bed due to lack of space
Sunshine,4193,5,lapizphos,,180.0,ltbx,"on top of that, the people themselves while knowing how shitty the philippine healthcare system is, would still ridicule and isolate women affected by it"
Sunshine,4193,6,lapizphos,,180.0,ltbx,"overall i love this film, i love women, and i love women who dreams <3"

Sunshine,4197,2,4bgl,,,ltbx,"una sa lahat, tangina ng mga lalake"
Sunshine,4197,3,4bgl,,,ltbx,"pangalawa, ang fucked up talaga ng opinion ng mga pinoy kapag tungkol sa abortion to the point na nakacenter nalang siya kay God, when in fact, kung sino pa yung pala simba sila pa ang mas lason kung mag-isip"
Sunshine,4197,4,4bgl,,,ltbx,may karapatan ang babae kung ano ang gustong gawin nila sa katawan nila
Sunshine,4197,5,4bgl,,,ltbx,"kahit pa sabihin na, oo, nagseggs sila kaya automatic na alam nila kung ano ang mabubuo, pero hindi yun sapat para sabihin mong masama ang abortion"
Sunshine,4197,6,4bgl,,,ltbx,"gaya ng scene na sinabi ni miggy na huwag na gumamit ng condom kasi sa labas niya ipuputok, pero anong nangyare"
Sunshine,4197,7,4bgl,,,ltbx,"gaya ng nasa pelikula, yung nabuntis ng tito niya"
Sunshine,4197,8,4bgl,,,ltbx,"kung masama sa mata ng Diyos ang paglaglag, paano pa kaya ang kasalanan nung tito niya"
Sunshine,4197,9,4bgl,,,ltbx,"nagdebate kami noon about sa abortion, ang sabi ko gagawin ko kasi sarili ko ang iniisip ko, na hindi ko kaya at hindi ako ready"
Sunshine,4197,10,4bgl,,,ltbx,pero anong sabi saakin
Sunshine,4197,11,4bgl,,,ltbx,selfish daw ako kasi hindi ko inisip ang bata kahit pa galing grape cases yan
Sunshine,4197,12,4bgl,,,ltbx,"nagaaral ako ng nursing, at base sa mga pinagaralan ko, habang nasa loob pa yan ng sinapupunan, hindi yan bata"
Sunshine,4197,13,4bgl,,,ltbx,fetus yan
Sunshine,4197,14,4bgl,,,ltbx,"hindi naman puso ang unang nabubuo, kundi ang utak"
Sunshine,4197,15,4bgl,,,ltbx,hindi ko maintindihan kung bakit ang hirap maging babae sa bansang to
Sunshine,4197,16,4bgl,,,ltbx,"wala kayong pake sa mga corrupt na politicians kasi may binibigay na pera sainyo, e kung sa tutuusin galing din naman sa tax natin yon"
Sunshine,4197,17,4bgl,,,ltbx,"pero sa abortion na wala naman kayo noong may nangyayare sakanila, kung makapag salita para bang kayo ang mag-bubuntis, mag-hihirap, at mag-papaanak"

Sunshine,4199,4,_jennq,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine made a choice, a brave one"
Sunshine,4199,5,_jennq,,160.0,ltbx,honestly people should know more about a woman's body and how not to dictate what she wants to do with it
Sunshine,4199,6,_jennq,,160.0,ltbx,how come the unborn has more voice than the woman carrying them
Sunshine,4199,7,_jennq,,160.0,ltbx,give ko na rin 'to sa sister nya who was ALWAYS there for her and who stood by her until the end

Sunshine,4203,1,sinrue,,160.0,ltbx,"the film moves slowly, almost cautiously, letting you sit with people who are trying to hold their lives together even when everything around them keeps slipping sideways"
Sunshine,4203,2,sinrue,,160.0,ltbx,nothing is exaggerated; it all feels painfully ordinary in the way real lives are
Sunshine,4203,3,sinrue,,160.0,ltbx,"the characters are not shouting for answers, they are just trying to make sense of the days piling up"
Sunshine,4203,4,sinrue,,160.0,ltbx,there is this constant push and pull between wanting to break free and accepting that the world has edges you cannot always escape
Sunshine,4203,5,sinrue,,160.0,ltbx,"no big revelation, no sudden salvation"
Sunshine,4203,6,sinrue,,160.0,ltbx,just a slow unraveling-that honesty hits harder than any dramatic twist could
Sunshine,4203,7,sinrue,,160.0,ltbx,thank you
Sunshine,4204,1,njcdxx,,180.0,ltbx,I teared up
Sunshine,4204,2,njcdxx,,180.0,ltbx,Women can do and not just dream
Sunshine,4204,3,njcdxx,,180.0,ltbx,"Why is it ever that when a woman bears life, they are to sacrifice their own dreams and on the other side, men continues to live on vicariously"
Sunshine,4204,4,njcdxx,,180.0,ltbx,And so Sunshine flipped the narrative
Sunshine,4204,5,njcdxx,,180.0,ltbx,"Live a long good life, Sunshine :)"

Sunshine,4206,1,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,It was true when they said that this was a brave film
Sunshine,4206,2,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,"To be one of the first films in pinoy cinema to explore a pro-choice and an unwanted pregnancy narrative is indeed brave, especially when you know the Philippines’ socio-political and religious climate around topics regarding sex, female desires, pregnancy, bodily autonomy, and parenthood"
Sunshine,4206,3,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,There were unfortunately some parts of the film that felt like they didn’t work
Sunshine,4206,4,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,I’m not sure but Sunshine’s decision to abort felt too quick
Sunshine,4206,5,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,And her dream to be an Olympian felt underexplored and more of her coach’s
Sunshine,4206,6,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,We’re told rather than shown that it was hers
Sunshine,4206,7,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,The inclusion of Annika Co whose character can be interpreted as Sunshine’s subconscious/ego or unborn child or whatnot sometimes felt irritating to watch (sorry not sorry)
Sunshine,4206,8,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,But I guess to reach more towards a predominantly Filipino audience and to highlight Sunshine still being a (teen) child who’s forced to confront the consequences of her choices by a child: worked
Sunshine,4206,9,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,I don’t know
Sunshine,4206,10,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,"Not to mention that it felt a little silly to include two other characters, where one was another pregnant teen girl, that lowkey felt like their stories were being shoved down to the audience’s throats"
Sunshine,4206,11,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,"And in the end, felt shallow"
Sunshine,4206,12,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,I just think that I hoped they showed more of the technicalities of her being an athlete
Sunshine,4206,13,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,Rhythmic gymnastics is considered an elite sport
Sunshine,4206,14,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,And when you consider it in the Philippine context – the film didn’t really show what was at stake of being an athlete in this sport
Sunshine,4206,15,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,"The film’s strong aspects are definitely on the score, cinematography (particularly to highlight the corners of Manila as this chaotic, packed, and cruel city), and of course: Maris’ performance as Sunshine"
Sunshine,4206,16,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,There were scenes that hit hard and heavy
Sunshine,4206,17,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,The irony of abortion drugs sold and found in the street outside a church
Sunshine,4206,18,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,The motel scene to show Sunshine’s quiet desperation
Sunshine,4206,19,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,Her final rehearsal for her routine before her “gets ko na” scene with Annika (where I cried unfort bcz luteal phase duh)
Sunshine,4206,20,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,"The film does show you a glimpse of the unforgiving reality of what many Filipino women go through everyday: teenage pregnancy, overcrowded and underfunded public hospitals, and the lack of comprehensive sexuality education about sexuality and sexual and reproductive health"
Sunshine,4206,21,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,"It lacked, sure"
Sunshine,4206,22,letshencook,,160.0,ltbx,"But I guess, for pinoy cinema to start tackling difficult topics such as this: it’s a start"
Sunshine,4207,1,lyeski,,200.0,ltbx,genuinely cried so much this isn't funny
Sunshine,4208,1,ladyfcrtune,,180.0,ltbx,This story is so bold in its themes and it got all of it across with no bullshit
Sunshine,4208,2,ladyfcrtune,,180.0,ltbx,"It got everything across so straightforwardly, and I applaud it for that"
Sunshine,4208,3,ladyfcrtune,,180.0,ltbx,"Criminalizing abortion only makes things worse, women should be able to make decisions about their own body—not men, not the law, not religion"
Sunshine,4208,4,ladyfcrtune,,180.0,ltbx,"Thank you to everyone who made this movie happen, truly"
Sunshine,4208,5,ladyfcrtune,,180.0,ltbx,And a big fuck you sa mga lalake nga bastos kag iresponsable

Sunshine,4331,3,solanaa,,200.0,ltbx,"The part where Sunshine asks the little girl, ""Naiintindihan mo na ba ako"
Sunshine,4331,4,solanaa,,200.0,ltbx,""" And the child replies, ""Gets ko na,"" feels like a simple, but so profound of an exchange of words"
Sunshine,4331,5,solanaa,,200.0,ltbx,It feels like a hand that's gently soothing a wound she's been carrying all this time
Sunshine,4331,6,solanaa,,200.0,ltbx,"A wound that asked to be seen with the nuances that came with it, not the fantasies the society chooses to blind themselves with"
Sunshine,4331,7,solanaa,,200.0,ltbx,Another thing that stood out to me abt this film is how it challenges the viewers to confront the expectations forced onto women simply for existing
Sunshine,4331,8,solanaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Not with judgement, but with a silence that understands what it means to be human"
Sunshine,4331,9,solanaa,,200.0,ltbx,I just love that this film respects women's choices
Sunshine,4331,10,solanaa,,200.0,ltbx,It doesn't force a message or a narrative that motherhood is the only path to walk through once it enters in a woman's life
Sunshine,4331,11,solanaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Instead, it says that your life, dreams, and timing are all yours regardless of what everyone thinks nor says abt it"
Sunshine,4331,12,solanaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Because to be a mother means to be ready mentally, physically, and financially"
Sunshine,4331,13,solanaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Love alone isn't enough to carry a life, just a majority of its suffering"

Sunshine,4346,2,souvlakis,,200.0,ltbx,"there’s something special and heartbreaking in seeing manila and its inhabitants this way, eternally cruel and chaotic… sunshine encompasses the plight of every filipina, the quiet ache and exhaustion of navigating a world perpetually against her entire being: a country built on catholicism, patriarchal values and misogyny"
Sunshine,4346,3,souvlakis,,200.0,ltbx,"but sunshine also captures the perseverance that every filipina were forced to cultivate, not because we are naturally stronger but because we are given no other choice in life"

Sunshine,4389,3,gio_miguelo,,180.0,ltbx,I for one can never fully give my stance since I am religious but also because I am not a woman
Sunshine,4389,4,gio_miguelo,,180.0,ltbx,I've always believed that the woman is the one that should decide on what to do with an unwanted pregnancy
Sunshine,4389,5,gio_miguelo,,180.0,ltbx,"So, to see pros and cons of wanting to abort a child as well as choosing to go through abortion was quite engaging and I understand things more now"
Sunshine,4389,6,gio_miguelo,,180.0,ltbx,"To see the horrors of using illegal ways of abortion was eye-opening, in all honesty"

Sunshine,4396,27,iceddunkin,,120.0,ltbx,The fact that I watched this with my parents and that they were genuinely interested and concerned about the film is a good point
Sunshine,4396,28,iceddunkin,,120.0,ltbx,"Sa dulo naman, baka expectations ko rin ang rason kaya ko ito naisip"
Sunshine,4396,29,iceddunkin,,120.0,ltbx,"From here on, sana hindi laging hanggang unang bato lang"
Sunshine,4396,30,iceddunkin,,120.0,ltbx,Here’s to hoping na makahakbang at makausad na tayo
Sunshine,4397,1,moniquea,,140.0,ltbx,i feel like i could have empathized with her more if the film showed how her imaginary child gradually understands sunshine from her own perspective like how
Sunshine,4397,2,moniquea,,140.0,ltbx,How would she even know
Sunshine,4397,3,moniquea,,140.0,ltbx,"lol aside from that, we could’ve explored more of why this sport is so important to her instead of adding a subplot (that 13 yr old girl case) that makes her situation feel less serious"
Sunshine,4397,4,moniquea,,140.0,ltbx,"her feelings and reasons are all valid but that subplot makes her look careless and kinda dumb lol so it’s hard to root for her tbh also, her imaginary child looks cute, healthy, and fun to talk with"
Sunshine,4397,5,moniquea,,140.0,ltbx,why would she think of aborting her if that’s what her imaginary child is going to look like growing up
Sunshine,4397,6,moniquea,,140.0,ltbx,"the imaginary child should reflect the life she can’t give or the pressure she feels or at least something burdensome that is so much worse, not some fantasy lolz"
Sunshine,4397,7,moniquea,,140.0,ltbx,"gets na niya, hinayaan niya, tinaggap nalang niya ang fate niya kahit imaginary siya"
Sunshine,4398,1,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,"I’ll be honest, underwhelming siya for me"
Sunshine,4398,2,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Siguro tumaas lang expectations ko dahil sa dami ng reviews na nakita ko sa social media (na hindi ko binasa para iwas spoiler) at syempre dahil sa haba ng theatrical run niya
Sunshine,4398,3,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,What I genuinely liked were the performances
Sunshine,4398,4,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,"They hired competent actors, and it shows"
Sunshine,4398,5,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,"And since marami na rin akong napanood na Jadaone films, andun pa rin ’yun trademark angst niya—and I love that for her"
Sunshine,4398,6,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Ang hindi ko kinaya ay ’yun imaginary children
Sunshine,4398,7,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Siguro kasi sobrang dami ko nang nakitang ganitong atake sa short films at full-length lalo na kapag tungkol sa abortion kaya hindi na bago sa paningin ko
Sunshine,4398,8,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,"I get kung bakit siya ginamit as a plot device to feel “innovative,” especially with a message that wants to tell the masses na okay lang piliin ang sarili at magpa-abort"
Sunshine,4398,9,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Importanteng mensahe ’yun
Sunshine,4398,10,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Kaso… hindi ako nadala emotionally
Sunshine,4398,11,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,May mga babae akong kakilala na nagpa-abort at grabe ’yun pinagdaanan nila
Sunshine,4398,12,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,"Compared sa mga kwentong narinig ko, ang nipis lang ng emotional experience ni Sunshine sa film"
Sunshine,4398,13,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Kaya siguro nainis ako sa imaginary children na atake
Sunshine,4398,14,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,The feeling itself of learning you're pregnant tapos mag-decide to get an abortion already carries so many complex emotions
Sunshine,4398,15,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Hindi mo na kailangan idikit pa ’yun mga bata to prove a point
Sunshine,4398,16,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Hindi ko rin nagustuhan na parang ang babaw ng pagkakahandle sa kwento nung batang na-rape ng tito niya
Sunshine,4398,17,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Pakiramdam ko ibang pelikula dapat ’yun—isang pelikula na mas malalim at mas handang i-tackle ’yun bigat ng topic
Sunshine,4398,18,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,"Feeling ko kung lalaki ka, baka mas ""oks"" itong film para sayo"
Sunshine,4398,19,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Pero bilang babae… parang kulang pa
Sunshine,4398,21,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Miss ko ’yun docu days ni Jadaone
Sunshine,4398,22,sunjazzfilms,,100.0,ltbx,Can we bring her back
Sunshine,4399,1,goodatama,,180.0,ltbx,I’m very grateful at this film’s attempt to keep the narrative always in favor of pro-choice
Sunshine,4399,2,goodatama,,180.0,ltbx,"For a recent narrative on a young woman’s choice about her pregnancy, this film plays a lot of modern elements well"
Sunshine,4399,3,goodatama,,180.0,ltbx,"Social media is used several times throughout the start of the film, but none of it is cliché or abhorrent"
Sunshine,4399,4,goodatama,,180.0,ltbx,"Each social media is used in a very relatable way, which kind of shocked me but it was a feature of the film I really appreciated"
Sunshine,4399,5,goodatama,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine’s panic is so realistic and grounding too, the performance is amazing"
Sunshine,4399,6,goodatama,,180.0,ltbx,"In terms of tonal shifting, the film does a really great job at keeping it’s theme and message intense and suffocating, much like Sunshine’s need to make a decision"
Sunshine,4399,7,goodatama,,180.0,ltbx,It should ALWAYS be the woman’s choice
Sunshine,4400,1,mnvnt,,200.0,ltbx,LOVED this grabe gets na gets kita sunshine im so glad that you chose yourself
Sunshine,4401,1,mangostine,,160.0,ltbx,i have been waiting to watch this film ever since the behind the scenes photos of Xyriel Manabat came out and it was worth it
Sunshine,4401,2,mangostine,,160.0,ltbx,"it did not feel exaggerated, hits its points especially the tiniest details such as the looming hunch of security in the depths of Manila (a place full of otherworldly side quests, brimming of characters,, from experience)"
Sunshine,4401,3,mangostine,,160.0,ltbx,"Annika Co's acting was great, seeing her go from showtime to an actual movie is such a heartwarming sight"
Sunshine,4401,4,mangostine,,160.0,ltbx,"i love home but man there is so many things that are outdated, the mention of using ""hilot"" to mend a situation of a pregnant 13 year old girl, women’s health care OR even the fuck ass health care system itself, which is greatly shown, overpopulation, etc, you name it"
Sunshine,4401,5,mangostine,,160.0,ltbx,"it's too corrupt, and i feel like ending the film with sunshine on her own way was the best (and only) way to do it"
Sunshine,4402,1,calikyky,,200.0,ltbx,kung sana lang talaga binibigyang pansin ang health care system dito sa Pilipinas eh no
Sunshine,4402,2,calikyky,,200.0,ltbx,"grabe ka maris racal, kuhang-kuha mo na naman ako"
Sunshine,4402,3,calikyky,,200.0,ltbx,also can i just say that annika co slayed so hard on this one
Sunshine,4402,9,calikyky,,200.0,ltbx,this one deserves an award
Sunshine,4402,10,calikyky,,200.0,ltbx,walang tapon

Sunshine,4404,1,kaeluhhh,,200.0,ltbx,kailan nga ba magiging ligtas ang mga kababaihan mula sa mga boses na patuloy na nagdidikta ng kanilang buhay
Sunshine,4404,2,kaeluhhh,,200.0,ltbx,"kailan darating ang araw na hindi na kailangan ng mga kababaihang isugal ang kanilang buhay, tulad nina sunshine at menggay"
Sunshine,4404,3,kaeluhhh,,200.0,ltbx,kailan magiging ligtas ang pilipinas para sa mga kababaihan
Sunshine,4405,1,mus3ira,,200.0,ltbx,ive been waiting for this to come out on netflix and it is honestly such a GREAT commentary on anti-abortion laws in the philippines and in religious/third world countries as a whole
Sunshine,4405,2,mus3ira,,200.0,ltbx,it truly is a privilege to have the right to our own bodies
Sunshine,4405,3,mus3ira,,200.0,ltbx,the writing of this movie was quite interesting and i believe the children held so much significance to the development and the decision making of the main lead
Sunshine,4405,4,mus3ira,,200.0,ltbx,"i believe they are the make-believe consciousness of the “thing” (lets stop calling them babies PLEASE) inside the main lead and the 13yo girl, and i LOVED being so confused and then realising this later on"
Sunshine,4405,5,mus3ira,,200.0,ltbx,“drown out the noise” something we need to tell ourselves more often than not
Sunshine,4405,6,mus3ira,,200.0,ltbx,we shouldn’t listen to outside opinions of what to do with ourselves and our own bodies
Sunshine,4405,7,mus3ira,,200.0,ltbx,it is the happiest way to live and love life
Sunshine,4405,8,mus3ira,,200.0,ltbx,i hold this movie very close to my heart and living in a country where abortion is legal is a HUGE privilege and i look forward to the days where religious doctrine dont run the government and put its citizens in a chokehold
Sunshine,4405,9,mus3ira,,200.0,ltbx,"religious or not, DON’T tell ANYONE what to do with their bodies, we are all in different circumstances and have wants/dreams/aspirations we’d like to pursue for our own happiness and that’s not selfish"
Sunshine,4406,1,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,my best friend sent a message in the group chat saying “guys please don’t ever get pregnant” fresh after watching this
Sunshine,4406,2,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,i laughed in my mind thinking how is that even gonna happen
Sunshine,4406,3,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,but here i am sobbing like a child and wishing that nobody ever gets pregnant against their will
Sunshine,4406,4,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,"what a demented, horrifying, and pathetic world we live in"
Sunshine,4406,5,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,this film plunged my heart deep into my guts from the very beginning
Sunshine,4406,6,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,it’s already hard being a girl and then you have systems in place that form a fist around your throat
Sunshine,4406,7,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,this was so well made that none of it looked fake
Sunshine,4406,8,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,i mean it’s so funny to see the juxtaposition of the church and the “pamparegla” vendors that are still there today
Sunshine,4406,9,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,maybe it’s more sad really but that is the reality
Sunshine,4406,10,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,i don’t know i guess it is so hard to explain the horrors of being a woman
Sunshine,4406,11,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,men get to conveniently be selfish as part of their nature but putting yourself first as a girl needs an apology from god
Sunshine,4406,12,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,"men regard laws only when they can deny women any autonomy, but break them with ease for their own disgusting desires and freely laugh about it with their friends"
Sunshine,4406,13,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,i am so glad this film ended the way it did but i am also very sad and angry that girls who meet the same fate have to suffer maybe even worse than this
Sunshine,4406,14,parbhlematic,,200.0,ltbx,and that’s when i know god is not a woman
Sunshine,4407,1,titingtumulak,,200.0,ltbx,"Society claims to protect the “unborn child,” yet the conversation often leaves out the women whose bodies, health, and futures are directly involved"
Sunshine,4407,2,titingtumulak,,200.0,ltbx,"It feels unsettling to watch how easily society dismisses the experiences of women, as if their lives become secondary the moment they become pregnant"
Sunshine,4407,3,titingtumulak,,200.0,ltbx,I can’t ignore how deeply this connects to the patriarchal norms I’ve grown up seeing
Sunshine,4407,4,titingtumulak,,200.0,ltbx,"From subtle expectations to outright judgment, there is a long history of controlling women’s bodies and decisions"
Sunshine,4407,5,titingtumulak,,200.0,ltbx,"The shame placed on those who consider or seek abortion is not just personal; it is cultural and religious, embedded in systems that teach us to shame and question women’s choices instead of supporting them"
Sunshine,4407,6,titingtumulak,,200.0,ltbx,This made us more aware of how easily society turns compassion into condemnation when it comes to reproductive health
Sunshine,4407,7,titingtumulak,,200.0,ltbx,"P'wede ba pag walang matres, 'wag na bumoses"
Sunshine,4408,1,riellume,,200.0,ltbx,grabe ang lala nastress ako pero shit ganda nung movie
Sunshine,4408,2,riellume,,200.0,ltbx,gets na gets ko
Sunshine,4409,1,cinephileckurt,,100.0,ltbx,"I really like most of Jadaone's works, some of em were even my all time faves, I just love it when she focuses on the realistic and simple stuff"
Sunshine,4409,2,cinephileckurt,,100.0,ltbx,The fantastical elements really took me out a bit and some scenes where it's like spoonfeeding the information to the viewers imo
Sunshine,4409,3,cinephileckurt,,100.0,ltbx,I'm still rooting for Jadaone and some other directors to make more realistic and relatable mainstream drama films
Sunshine,4410,1,aeronoia,,200.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,4410,2,aeronoia,,200.0,ltbx,"at gaya ng ate mo at ng bata, kakampi mo rin ako, Sunshine"
Sunshine,4410,3,aeronoia,,200.0,ltbx,WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL FILM
Sunshine,4411,1,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"hindi ko alam kung anong mas mabigat habang pinapanood ko Sunshine — yung katahimikan ng mga babaeng walang mapagsabihan, o yung ingay ng mundong ang bilis humusga pero ang bagal tumulong"
Sunshine,4411,2,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"Jadaone films always stab softly, pero ito"
Sunshine,4411,3,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"Parang dahan-dahang hinihiwa yung dibdib, layer by layer, para ipakita yung takot, pangarap, at kahihiyang matagal nang nakatago sa ilalim ng “ok lang ako"
Sunshine,4411,4,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"”this is the kind of film na hindi mo papanoorin para gumaan ang loob mo, papanoorin mo siya para maalala kung gaano kabigat mabuhay bilang babae sa bansang ayaw umamin na may mali sa sistemang sinasamba nito"
Sunshine,4411,5,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine doesn’t preach
Sunshine,4411,6,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"it just stands there, raw and trembling, asking the kind of questions we’re trained to avoid:Paano ka pipili kung lahat ng choice mo ay kasalanan sa mata ng iba"
Sunshine,4411,7,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,Paano ka lalaban kung mismong katawan mo ang pinaparusahan
Sunshine,4411,8,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is devastating in ways na hindi loud pero lumalalim
Sunshine,4411,9,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,hindi siya yung tipikal na dramatic heroine — she’s simply a girl suspended between a dream and a reality that keeps shrinking her choices
Sunshine,4411,10,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,her silence says more than any monologue could
Sunshine,4411,11,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"every frame feels like a confession: hesitant, trembling, pero totoo"
Sunshine,4411,12,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"and what struck me most wasn’t the gymnastics, or even the central issue of abortion"
Sunshine,4411,13,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,it was the ache between who we want to become and what our circumstances force us to be
Sunshine,4411,14,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"nakakapagod maging babae sa Pilipinas — laging may moral lesson, laging monitored, laging may takot na isang maling galaw lang, tapos na ang lahat"
Sunshine,4411,15,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,parang ang liit liit ng mundo mo kahit ang laki laki ng pangarap mo
Sunshine,4411,16,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine doesn’t romanticize any of this
Sunshine,4411,17,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"walang sermon, walang cinematic gloss"
Sunshine,4411,18,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"just a raw, unfiltered look at how dreams bruise under a society na mas mabilis manghusga kaysa umintindi"
Sunshine,4411,19,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"the film’s imperfections — the loose ends, the uneven metaphors, the sometimes rushed stakes — oddly work in its favor"
Sunshine,4411,20,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,because real life isn’t clean
Sunshine,4411,21,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,hindi linear ang trauma
Sunshine,4411,22,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,hindi laging malinaw ang choice
Sunshine,4411,23,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"and maybe that’s the point: that we’re all navigating a world built not on empathy, but on fear and control"
Sunshine,4411,24,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"in the end, Sunshine feels less like a movie and more like a mirror — one that forces you to sit with the darkness until you finally admit na masakit talaga ang liwanag"
Sunshine,4411,25,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"it’s an eye-opener not because it shocks, but because it whispers truths we’ve mastered the art of ignoring"
Sunshine,4411,26,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"a film worth watching, not because it entertains, but because it confronts"
Sunshine,4411,27,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,"because it nudges you to look beyond the screen and into the world we built… and ask, Bakit ganito"
Sunshine,4411,28,makimakkk,,160.0,ltbx,And more importantly — hanggang kailan
Sunshine,4412,1,jnkblonded,,160.0,ltbx,k lang galing niya

Sunshine,4414,2,myouizi,,160.0,ltbx,loved how the film really showed the reality on what women go through when we decide we wanted to put ourselves first
Sunshine,4415,1,kdway,,200.0,ltbx,tangina ng hagugol ko sa end ng film because gets na gets ko si sunshine
Sunshine,4415,2,kdway,,200.0,ltbx,this film is phenomenal and it is much needed
Sunshine,4415,3,kdway,,200.0,ltbx,"kaya sana #DecriminalizeAbortion #LegalizeAbortion to help women make safe choices, to guide them, and to make sure that their wellbeing isn’t put at risk"
Sunshine,4415,4,kdway,,200.0,ltbx,"sa society na meron ang Pilipinas, iisa lamang ang tanging hiling ko—maging malaya ang mga babae sa kanilang mga desisyon patungkol sa kanilang karapatan"

Sunshine,4416,1,maxinerae,,180.0,ltbx,Ang hirap maging babae
Sunshine,4416,2,maxinerae,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine touched on some of the most sensitive and difficult struggle of being a woman
Sunshine,4416,3,maxinerae,,180.0,ltbx,especially in the Philippines
Sunshine,4416,4,maxinerae,,180.0,ltbx,"One of which is the inaccessibility to women-friendly environments, may it be in your household, in public, at the hospital, at school"
Sunshine,4416,5,maxinerae,,180.0,ltbx,"And when I say women-friendly, it's the support for the emotional and mental consequences, and physical choices for oneself"
Sunshine,4416,6,maxinerae,,180.0,ltbx,"We suffer consequences that are beyond our own control but when we decide how to deal with it, our surroundings tend to vilify us for our choices"
Sunshine,4416,7,maxinerae,,180.0,ltbx,But Sunshine shows us that we are in charge of our own choices however we like it
Sunshine,4416,8,maxinerae,,180.0,ltbx,"We know our bodies, our dreams, our capacities the best"
Sunshine,4416,9,maxinerae,,180.0,ltbx,Salamat Sunshine at nagwagi pa rin tayo sa pagtatapos ng pelikula

Sunshine,4433,4,bluffboyfriend,,140.0,ltbx,not saying this is that but im kinda sick of people doing character studies when they just clearly don't know how to write/do plot

Sunshine,4436,1,lyreiswatching,,140.0,ltbx,"abortion is a topic i usually avoid because it’s morally, socially, and emotionally heavy"

Sunshine,4516,5,eulairs,,200.0,ltbx,i hate the fact that this reflects the reality of most girls in the philippines women not being able to access abortion is a crime against women’s health and well-being i can’t stomach that hospitals don’t accept girls who resort to unofficial or “illegal” abortion pills — bcs what else can these girls do when they’re put in an unwarranted position like menggay who was impregnated by her uncle
Sunshine,4516,6,eulairs,,200.0,ltbx,after being violated she’s expected to be tied to a responsibility caused by someone else’s crime against her
Sunshine,4516,7,eulairs,,200.0,ltbx,do you really want that for her when she was raped
Sunshine,4516,8,eulairs,,200.0,ltbx,TRUE FREEDOM IS HAVING THE RIGHT TO CHOOSEwhat a hell it is to be a woman with no freedom to choose for ourselves++ and accessing contraceptives without being shamed should be the norm esp as we head into 2026

Sunshine,4520,2,luvdistrict_,,200.0,ltbx,"sana maintidihan ng pro-lifers na criminalizing abortion doesn't stop women from doing it, instead it makes it unsafe and puts women's life at risk"
Sunshine,4520,3,luvdistrict_,,200.0,ltbx,nadurog talaga yung puso ko nung rhed was denied medical care kahit halos she's on her death bed dahil lang nagpa-abort siya
Sunshine,4521,1,rvlvchi,,160.0,ltbx,great acting and uh great contraception guys
Sunshine,4522,1,jellygaze,,180.0,ltbx,"this film is a deeply realistic exploration of what it means to be a woman in the philippines—a country where patriarchy, tradition, religion, and economic pressure converge in ways that make womanhood both exhausting and precarious"
Sunshine,4522,2,jellygaze,,180.0,ltbx,"Importantly, the film is not a pro-life statement, nor does it romanticize suffering or prescribe motherhood as a moral imperative"
Sunshine,4522,3,jellygaze,,180.0,ltbx,"instead, it shows that the choices women face are complex, constrained, and often invisible to those who hold power"
Sunshine,4522,4,jellygaze,,180.0,ltbx,it also addresses the ways women navigate survival under these pressures
Sunshine,4522,5,jellygaze,,180.0,ltbx,it shows that women are often responsible for both care work and emotional labor without recognition or support
Sunshine,4522,6,jellygaze,,180.0,ltbx,"the everyday reality of harassment, unsafe streets, economic vulnerability, and social judgment creates conditions in which reproductive choice becomes a deeply personal but politically fraught decision"
Sunshine,4522,7,jellygaze,,180.0,ltbx,"the film does not moralize these choices; it presents them with nuance, empathy, and a refusal to simplify the stakes into a pro-life narrative"
Sunshine,4522,8,jellygaze,,180.0,ltbx,"at higit sa lahat, thank you, sunshine, sa pagpukpok ng bote sa tito"

Sunshine,4533,1,cherubinspirit,,200.0,ltbx,"This goes by the saying that there really are choices to be made, actions to be done, and decisions to decide"
Sunshine,4533,2,cherubinspirit,,200.0,ltbx,This is a reminder that life is not picture perfect and it could go from bad to worse
Sunshine,4533,3,cherubinspirit,,200.0,ltbx,"I took the time to really understand the movie’s roots and motive, and as a teenage girl, it really reflects my fear"
Sunshine,4533,4,cherubinspirit,,200.0,ltbx,Trying so hard to be something you become nothing
Sunshine,4533,5,cherubinspirit,,200.0,ltbx,"Especially with how there are religious motifs, it really lives deep within you, the guilt, the unremovable mark of every lesson that you have to incline within you"
Sunshine,4533,6,cherubinspirit,,200.0,ltbx,"Whether the impact is small or big, you just can not wash off what they say should be your purpose in life"

Sunshine,4534,1,maxdapanda,,180.0,ltbx,"ako din, gets ko na"
Sunshine,4534,2,maxdapanda,,180.0,ltbx,this film has quickly outranked some of the other recently released filipino films that i’ve seen
Sunshine,4534,3,maxdapanda,,180.0,ltbx,maris racal was perfect for the main role and rhed bustamante’s performance was chilling
Sunshine,4534,4,maxdapanda,,180.0,ltbx,one thing that i could point out though is that annika co’s delivery the conyo accent slipped from time to time and didn’t fully match her character
Sunshine,4534,5,maxdapanda,,180.0,ltbx,"but overall, i believe that everyone’s performance in this film exceeded expectations, the storyline was great, and the cinematography was well-executed"
Sunshine,4535,1,auroxenon,,140.0,ltbx,"Once again, cried because of societal issues"

Sunshine,4536,5,saintlydior,,200.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal’s breakthrough performance, very deserving ng Urian"
Sunshine,4536,6,saintlydior,,200.0,ltbx,Give her the awards
Sunshine,4537,1,escasie,,200.0,ltbx,it's hurts to know people have to risk their lives because abortion is not legal in this country
Sunshine,4537,2,escasie,,200.0,ltbx,people especially women deserve freedom to choose what should they do to their lives
Sunshine,4537,3,escasie,,200.0,ltbx,MAKE ABORTION LEGAL
Sunshine,4538,1,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"This is a blistering, gut-punching film that doesn’t just ask difficult questions about bodily autonomy and Olympic dreams; it screams them into the humid, chaotic reality of Manila"
Sunshine,4538,2,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"It’s a brave, essential piece of cinema that confronts the devastating consequences of living in a country where a woman’s control over her own body is perpetually under threat"
Sunshine,4538,3,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and utterly visceral—it’s relentless, trapping us inside Sunshine’s suffocating anxiety"
Sunshine,4538,4,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"Jadaone uses the oppressive visual texture of Quiapo’s crowded, sweltering streets—a perfect, gritty backdrop—to symbolize the labyrinthine journey of a young woman navigating impossible choices in a system designed to fail her"
Sunshine,4538,5,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,A massive and well-deserved standing ovation goes to the central performances
Sunshine,4538,6,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal is devastating as the titular gymnast, embodying the crushing physical and emotional burden with every strained muscle and every desperate, silent plea"
Sunshine,4538,7,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"Her performance is a masterclass in controlled despair, capturing the agony of a lifetime of sacrifice being threatened in an instant"
Sunshine,4538,8,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"She is perfectly complemented by Annika Co’s mesmerizing, eerie, and unrelenting presence as the Kid—an unsettling narrative device that functions as both Sunshine’s internal critic and her desperate conscience"
Sunshine,4538,9,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,But let’s be real: the film’s rawest emotional hook comes from the shocking failure and apathy of the men around her
Sunshine,4538,10,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"Their irresponsibility and sheer lack of accountability form a central, infuriating symbol of the patriarchal society that traps Sunshine"
Sunshine,4538,11,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,Ang hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas
Sunshine,4538,12,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"Every day feels like a battle against a society na paulit-ulit kang nilalagay sa kahon, insisting that your worth begins and ends with motherhood"
Sunshine,4538,13,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"Fuck the stigma na finoforce ang mga kababaihan into roles they never agreed to—parang automatic default na lang na dapat tahimik, dapat magtiis, dapat magpakamartir"
Sunshine,4538,14,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"Walang puwang para sa sariling pangarap, sariling katawan, sariling desisyon"
Sunshine,4538,15,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,Kaya sana mas umingay at mas mapag-usapan ang Reproductive Rights—hindi lang as a “women’s issue” but as a basic human right
Sunshine,4538,16,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"This is about giving women the freedom to choose, the safety to seek care without judgment, and the dignity to exist without being shamed or controlled"
Sunshine,4538,17,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"Hanggang hindi natin tinatalakay nang seryoso ang mga ito, paulit-ulit lang tayo sa cycle ng stigma, trauma, at kawalan ng choices"
Sunshine,4538,18,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,Being a woman here shouldn't feel like a punishment
Sunshine,4538,19,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,It shouldn't demand silence in exchange for survival
Sunshine,4538,20,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"And yet, dito sa Pilipinas, ganun pa rin ang realidad—and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter"
Sunshine,4538,21,forgetlilacw,,160.0,ltbx,"Putangina, Miggy/Miguel na naman"
Sunshine,4539,1,buzzbeahive,,200.0,ltbx,"gets ko na, naiintindihan kita sunshine"
Sunshine,4540,1,matchamaki,,180.0,ltbx,not me crying in the last scene when the kid said “gets ko na”  that line alone broke me
Sunshine,4540,2,matchamaki,,180.0,ltbx,"it shows the reality of so many women being abused, raped, silenced and then forced into motherhood they never asked for"
Sunshine,4540,3,matchamaki,,180.0,ltbx,this country still treats pregnancy like a moral test instead of a health issue and how abortion is demonized instead of seen as a life-saving option
Sunshine,4540,4,matchamaki,,180.0,ltbx,they judge wome but never the system that failed them
Sunshine,4540,5,matchamaki,,180.0,ltbx,"we blame girls for getting pregnant, but not the men who hurt them"
Sunshine,4540,6,matchamaki,,180.0,ltbx,and forcing someone especially a minor to give birth when she’s not ready
Sunshine,4540,7,matchamaki,,180.0,ltbx,reproductive rights ARE human rights and that choosing not to carry a pregnancy is valid
Sunshine,4541,1,gowonatorr,,100.0,ltbx,could’ve been more brave tbh…sayang ang pag-open ng diskurso ng abortion and do nothing abt it

Sunshine,4572,1,mwingming,,160.0,ltbx,this film is so unapologetically manila—supposedly lugar ng mga pangarap pero you get hit with the stench of poverty and the grimy and dirty weight of reality beneath the pollution
Sunshine,4572,2,mwingming,,160.0,ltbx,the juxtaposition of quiapo where it houses one of the many saints that this religious ass hell country devote themselves to enough to march barefoot—houses one of the church’s most condemned act of sin ( more than homosexuality anyway ): abortion
Sunshine,4572,3,mwingming,,160.0,ltbx,its so oddly beautiful

Sunshine,4575,2,verlsatile,,180.0,ltbx,"‎bilang isang babae na katulad ni sunshine, napakarami ko ring kailangang isuko—mga bagay na hindi ko naman ginustong bitawan, pero kailangan para lang manatiling matatag sa mundong hindi marunong magbigay ng espasyo para sa atin"
Sunshine,4575,3,verlsatile,,180.0,ltbx,"sa bawat luha niya, dama ko yung takot para sa sarili niyang kinabukasan na maaring hindi mabigyan ng pagkakataon"
Sunshine,4575,4,verlsatile,,180.0,ltbx,"bilang ibinuhay niya nang matagal, ramdam ko ang bigat ng pagdadala ng sariling laban nang walang kasangga, habang ang mga mata sa paligid ay puno ng panghuhusga galing sa mga matang marurumi ngunit sila pa ang unang nagmamalinis"
Sunshine,4575,5,verlsatile,,180.0,ltbx,mga taong mabilis magsabi ng tama at mali kahit hindi nila kailanman dinala ang ganitong klaseng sakit
Sunshine,4575,6,verlsatile,,180.0,ltbx,"‎bilang babae, alam ko"
Sunshine,4575,7,verlsatile,,180.0,ltbx,dama ko
Sunshine,4575,8,verlsatile,,180.0,ltbx,"sunshine, mahal kita dahil alam mo kung paano piliin ang sarili mo"

Sunshine,4577,1,rirismusee,,200.0,ltbx,such a well-written movie
Sunshine,4578,1,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,DIREK TONET
Sunshine,4578,2,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,YOU DID IT AGAIN
Sunshine,4578,3,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"first of all, this should be more relevant than it is"
Sunshine,4578,4,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"being pro choice and growing up somehow religious, I know what other people think of abortion"
Sunshine,4578,5,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,especially yung mga sagradong katoliko
Sunshine,4578,6,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,and that scene where sunshine went to church and immediately begged for forgiveness showcased EXACTLY THAT
Sunshine,4578,7,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,(religious guilt
Sunshine,4578,8,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,") it perfectly captures how the film isn’t just telling a story, but also reflecting a very real internal conflict na ang daming pinoy women who quietly deals with—yung clash between what you personally believe is right for your body and what your religion tells you is a sin"
Sunshine,4578,9,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,ang bigat pakinggan at panoorin
Sunshine,4578,10,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"""buntis lang ako, 'di to nakakahawa""kahit sa kapwa babae natin di mapipigilan yung judgement eh"
Sunshine,4578,11,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,kasi ganun yung pagpapalaki satin which is honestly fucked up
Sunshine,4578,12,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"and that line hits SO hard because it’s a commentary on how society treats pregnancy like a moral failure instead of a situation that needs support, empathy, and actual options"
Sunshine,4578,13,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"the film shows how even other women, who should’ve been supporting you, end up policing each other because yun yung environment na kinalakihan natin"
Sunshine,4578,14,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,tangina diba
Sunshine,4578,15,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,also the irony of buying abortion pills at a church and you can't get a room at a motel ALONE
Sunshine,4578,16,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"the system makes it impossible for women to make decisions about their own bodies, pero at the same time they judge you for every workaround you try to do"
Sunshine,4578,17,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"also for young girls who get raped and still, THEY have to deal with the consequences"
Sunshine,4578,18,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"it exposes how the philippines forces women into shame, secrecy, and inconvenience—and then they act shocked when women feel unsafe or unsupported"
Sunshine,4578,19,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"it’s painfully real, and so, so on point"
Sunshine,4578,20,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"overall, i love this movie because it's honest in a way that most local films are too scared to be"
Sunshine,4578,21,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,"some women don't have a choice, and it's important that WE DO HAVE A CHOICE"
Sunshine,4578,22,nysaluvsmovies,,180.0,ltbx,LET WOMEN HAVE THEIR DREAMS
Sunshine,4579,1,sbr2death,,200.0,ltbx,"I love you forever shine, well deserved top1 on netflix"

Sunshine,4580,2,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,it’s brave
Sunshine,4580,3,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,it’s heavy
Sunshine,4580,4,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,it’s painful
Sunshine,4580,5,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,it’s hard to be a woman
Sunshine,4580,6,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,even harder to be a woman in the philippines
Sunshine,4580,7,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,one of our professors once told us that our laws are deeply embedded into our culture
Sunshine,4580,8,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,that’s why there’s no abortion in the philippines… because of our strong religious beliefs
Sunshine,4580,9,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,"if you choose abortion as your option, you’re immediately seen as a murderer, a sinner, by our legal system and, of course, by god’s law"
Sunshine,4580,10,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,"the same religious beliefs hiding under the skirt of a patriarchal culture, doing nothing but scaring women away from their own choices"
Sunshine,4580,11,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,"sana, ngayon, gets n’yo na"
Sunshine,4580,12,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,gets na ng marami
Sunshine,4580,13,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,"that this kind of decision has never, ever been easy"
Sunshine,4580,14,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,"and i hope that now, we finally push for comprehensive sex education, free check-ups and contraceptives as reproductive health rights, and the legalization of abortion in the philippines, so no woman ever has to resort to unsafe methods while carrying the guilt and the danger all on her own"
Sunshine,4580,15,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,there are so many deep-rooted problems tied to abortion that we need to confront and tear down
Sunshine,4580,16,xeoul,,200.0,ltbx,only then can we truly set women free
Sunshine,4581,1,nue5ca,,200.0,ltbx,"first of all, gusto ko rin ng isang ate geleen hands down to maris' restrained but deeply affecting performance"
Sunshine,4581,2,nue5ca,,200.0,ltbx,ramdam mo 'yong bawat pag-aalinlangan at takot—every moment where the world presses a little too hard on a young girl who only wanted to chase her dream
Sunshine,4581,3,nue5ca,,200.0,ltbx,"what makes the film even more powerful is its raw, unflinching portrayal of philippine society"
Sunshine,4581,4,nue5ca,,200.0,ltbx,"the story exposes how reproductive rights in the country are entangled with religion, shame, and systemic neglect"
Sunshine,4581,5,nue5ca,,200.0,ltbx,"it shows how a woman's body becomes a public issue the moment it no longer fits moral expectations, and how access to safe, affordable healthcare quickly turns into a privilege instead of a right"
Sunshine,4581,6,nue5ca,,200.0,ltbx,"ultimately, sunshine champions a woman's right to her body, her choices, and her future—even in a society that constantly takes those away"
Sunshine,4582,1,dubuchips,,160.0,ltbx,"""ayoko maging nanay"
Sunshine,4582,2,dubuchips,,160.0,ltbx,hindi ko ipapanganak 'to dahil hindi ako ready maging nanay
Sunshine,4582,3,dubuchips,,160.0,ltbx,"""better not to be a parent than be a bad parent"
Sunshine,4582,4,dubuchips,,160.0,ltbx,this alone should be reason enough
Sunshine,4582,5,dubuchips,,160.0,ltbx,"no amount of moral and religious qualms, judgment from others, and what-if's about the future should offset a woman’s right to decide what happens to her own body and her own life"
Sunshine,4582,6,dubuchips,,160.0,ltbx,"gets kita, sunshine"
Sunshine,4583,1,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,Nakalimutan ko maglagay ng mga bagay na gusto ko sa Sunshine
Sunshine,4583,2,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,"Habang pinapanood ko ang Sunshine, naisip ko na ganon talaga kainit, kalagkit, kausok ang Manila (3 months pa lang ako dito)"
Sunshine,4583,3,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,Ganon ako kasweaty gaya ni Sunshine everytime naglalakad sya sa mga kalsada ng Manila
Sunshine,4583,4,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,"Napakahirap mabuhay sa lugar na to, at tiyak mas mahirap bumuhay ng tao rito"

Sunshine,4583,6,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,"May lima akong ate, at gets ko kung gaano kahirap maging babae"
Sunshine,4583,7,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,At nakita ko sa kanila kung gano kahalaga magkaroon ng autonomy; at sana yon ang reality ng lahat ng kababaihan didto satin
Sunshine,4583,8,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,"Ang ganda ng mga pelikula gaya ng Sunshine, kasi napag-uusapan natin ang mga bagay na dapat noon pa man ay napag-uusapan na"
Sunshine,4583,9,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,Ang aborsyon ay karapatan ng kababaihan
Sunshine,4583,10,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,Ang pagccriminalize dito ay nakakaendanger lang sa buhay ng mga babae
Sunshine,4583,11,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,Thanks direk
Sunshine,4583,12,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,"Napaisip din ako kanina pagkatapos kong mapanood ang Sunshine, na sana in the future ay malegalize na talaga ang aborsyon, and if ito ay malelegalize man ay sana magkaroon din ako ng opportunities to train"
Sunshine,4583,13,cicecreamcone,,160.0,ltbx,Yon lang
Sunshine,4584,1,eurity,,200.0,ltbx,"As someone who is not against abortion, this is a must-watch"

Sunshine,4584,5,eurity,,200.0,ltbx,It’s about women’s choice
Sunshine,4584,6,eurity,,200.0,ltbx,Can we normalize abortion
Sunshine,4584,7,eurity,,200.0,ltbx,"There are people who become pregnant because of rape, or those who simply do not want or are not ready to have a baby"
Sunshine,4584,8,eurity,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s not the woman’s fault if she chooses to get an abortion—her body, her choice"
Sunshine,4584,9,eurity,,200.0,ltbx,And to the men: can you all just be responsible
Sunshine,4584,10,eurity,,200.0,ltbx,"Some of you have the audacity to leave after getting what you want, acting like you have no responsibilities"
Sunshine,4584,11,eurity,,200.0,ltbx,Hindi masama ang abortion
Sunshine,4584,12,eurity,,200.0,ltbx,"Kapag ang babae ay hindi pa handa sa kanyang dinadala, may karapatan siyang pumili"
Sunshine,4584,13,eurity,,200.0,ltbx,"Dahil hindi lamang ang babae ang maghihirap, kundi pati ang batang kanyang isisilang"
Sunshine,4585,1,anqeliic,,180.0,ltbx,"the most defining moments of sunshine's character lie in the mundane loudness that surrounds her, and the silence she forces to cope with it"
Sunshine,4585,2,anqeliic,,180.0,ltbx,"paghikbi sa jeep, paghahanap haligi sa avenida inn, at pagsasarili sa gymnasium na naging ikalawang tahanan na"
Sunshine,4585,3,anqeliic,,180.0,ltbx,"the deafening silence of being bold, unabashed—being a woman who only wants to reach for the stars"
Sunshine,4585,4,anqeliic,,180.0,ltbx,this doesn't go on to show that the choices sunshine made were born out of being heartless; but rather the opposite
Sunshine,4585,5,anqeliic,,180.0,ltbx,gets ko na
Sunshine,4585,6,anqeliic,,180.0,ltbx,please do watch this film :) and #legalizeabortion #makeabortionaccessible
Sunshine,4588,1,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,What stayed with me long after the credits rolled is how Sunshine understands the quiet corners of being young
Sunshine,4588,2,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,"The ones filled with fear you don’t even have language for yet, and the hope you still hold anyway"
Sunshine,4588,3,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t chase shock value; instead, it trusts stillness, letting the soft ache of its characters speak for themselves"
Sunshine,4588,4,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,"And then there’s that storyline about the 13-year-old girl, pregnant because of her own uncle"
Sunshine,4588,5,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,OH GOD
Sunshine,4588,6,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,That shattered me
Sunshine,4588,7,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s horrifying, devastating, and the film doesn’t sanitize the truth of it"
Sunshine,4588,8,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,"It shows how violence like that hides inside families, how children are left carrying consequences for sins that were never theirs"
Sunshine,4588,9,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,I felt so much grief and anger for that kid; it’s the kind of scene that makes you sit there and go quiet because it hurts in a very real way
Sunshine,4588,10,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,"The film’s exploration of choice, shame, and the pressure to “grow up correctly” hits even harder because of moments like that"
Sunshine,4588,11,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,It never lectures
Sunshine,4588,12,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,It simply shows how heavy it is to carry circumstances shaped by adults who should’ve protected you
Sunshine,4588,13,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal delivers an immaculate kind of devastation in this role
Sunshine,4588,14,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,"There’s a sharpness to every look she gives, a trembling truth in every word, that feels painfully real"
Sunshine,4588,15,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,"She breaks open the character’s longing, lets the fear spill out raw, and turns her strength into something that rises slowly from the wreckage"
Sunshine,4588,16,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,It’s a performance that destroys you and stays spotless in its honesty
Sunshine,4588,17,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is the kind of film that lingers
Sunshine,4588,18,feldelrey,,200.0,ltbx,"Soft, bruising, furious when it needs to be, and quietly bright in all the places that matter"
Sunshine,4589,1,ayiesandra,,160.0,ltbx,FUCK the judicial system here in the philippines
Sunshine,4589,2,ayiesandra,,160.0,ltbx,So happy for sunshine and the “gets ko na” part was soo good
Sunshine,4590,1,st4rgirlren,,180.0,ltbx,the struggles and pain are def relatable as someone who’s like sunshine
Sunshine,4590,2,st4rgirlren,,180.0,ltbx,"this film showed nothing but reality and how people, society are so fucked up"
Sunshine,4590,3,st4rgirlren,,180.0,ltbx,a movie about abortion wherein it’s illegal in our country is superb
Sunshine,4590,4,st4rgirlren,,180.0,ltbx,the line “gets mo na ba
Sunshine,4590,5,st4rgirlren,,180.0,ltbx,” asked by sunshine to the child after being able to perform whole heartedly and the child agreed is ICONIC
Sunshine,4591,1,idlethei,,160.0,ltbx,Watched this during premiere sa theater…

Sunshine,4591,3,idlethei,,160.0,ltbx,Galing mo direk tonet
Sunshine,4592,1,sujokis,,200.0,ltbx,"i still don't understand why conservatives are more concerned with what an unborn child could be rather than the underlying issues/complications a woman can possibly go through because of carrying a child she does not want (be it physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially)"
Sunshine,4592,2,sujokis,,200.0,ltbx,"i'm so proud of you, sunshine"
Sunshine,4593,1,belleisa_8,,160.0,ltbx,"this is so well made; the future kid concept, the multiple perspectives of women w the same problem, the commentary on religion, and the lowkey open ending"
Sunshine,4593,2,belleisa_8,,160.0,ltbx,i think everyone should watch this
Sunshine,4593,3,belleisa_8,,160.0,ltbx,maris racal u deserve all the flowers

Sunshine,4594,3,akrur,,140.0,ltbx,and I understand na it didn't directly criticize religion but how religion is ignorantly used
Sunshine,4594,4,akrur,,140.0,ltbx,That is why niwala rin ako merun dapat mga legal amendments or legal considerations done when it comes to dealing w abortion cases
Sunshine,4595,1,mariaalizah,,180.0,ltbx,Sobrang ramdam na ramdom ko to on a very deep level

Sunshine,4602,1,fayeningning,,160.0,ltbx,The closest thing we can get to demons are real life human beings
Sunshine,4602,2,fayeningning,,160.0,ltbx,"Those who choose to be ignorant towards reality and blindly follow rules that is beneficial for them, and not for others"
Sunshine,4602,3,fayeningning,,160.0,ltbx,"Imagine how many empowering women lose so many opportunities because somebody told them it was wrong, that their bodies aren't their choice to make and that they are at fault"
Sunshine,4602,4,fayeningning,,160.0,ltbx,"So many women, in many ages, in many places"
Sunshine,4602,5,fayeningning,,160.0,ltbx,"Miggy pissed me off the first second I saw him based on how he reacted, and the male doctor"

Sunshine,4613,2,iramenwell,,120.0,ltbx,"but i do have to point out that, in a way, it’s somewhat hurtful to the advocacy"
Sunshine,4613,3,iramenwell,,120.0,ltbx,what i’m talking about is her “unborn child” used as her “conscience”i like that it kind of misleads the viewers into thinking that sunshine might keep her pregnancy
Sunshine,4613,4,iramenwell,,120.0,ltbx,"however, turning her “unborn child” into an actual character only gives the viewers an impression that abortion means murder (when we all know for A FACT that it’s not)"

Sunshine,4617,1,caleo_drogo,,200.0,ltbx,A challenging plot to bring to the screen and a harsh and sad reality for many women
Sunshine,4617,2,caleo_drogo,,200.0,ltbx,The strong hold religion has over the Philippines is especially frustrating
Sunshine,4617,3,caleo_drogo,,200.0,ltbx,The hospital scene where you would expect empathy from the doctor pissed me off
Sunshine,4617,4,caleo_drogo,,200.0,ltbx,The pastor and Miggy especially bothered me — Miggy because he’s a little shit and the pastor because his reaction reminded me of my father
Sunshine,4617,5,caleo_drogo,,200.0,ltbx,"Other people can get away with abortion because they have the money so they can just go freely with their lives, but for younger women like Sunshine and Ariana, it’s life or death"

Sunshine,4618,3,flaminhotlem0n,,160.0,ltbx,"Whether we acknowledge it or not, there are women who do not wish to become pregnant or are not ready to become mothers"
Sunshine,4618,4,flaminhotlem0n,,160.0,ltbx,Criminalizing abortion does not stop it from happening; it merely drives women toward unsafe procedures that place their lives at greater risk
Sunshine,4618,5,flaminhotlem0n,,160.0,ltbx,"If one personally identifies as pro-life, then one has the choice not to pursue abortion"
Sunshine,4618,6,flaminhotlem0n,,160.0,ltbx,"However, holding that belief does not grant anyone the authority to dictate or restrict what women can do with their own bodies, especially when they do not contribute to the wellbeing of the child these women may be forced to bear"
Sunshine,4618,7,flaminhotlem0n,,160.0,ltbx,"The health, autonomy, and safety of women must remain our priority"
Sunshine,4618,8,flaminhotlem0n,,160.0,ltbx,It is time to end the stigma surrounding reproductive choices and to uphold the separation of religion and state in policymaking

Sunshine,4621,2,frameofmaimind,,200.0,ltbx,"napakahusay sa detalaye, direk"
Sunshine,4622,1,cazo_ot,,200.0,ltbx,definitely an eye opener
Sunshine,4622,2,cazo_ot,,200.0,ltbx,women shouldn't be forced to give up their careers because of an unwanted kid
Sunshine,4622,3,cazo_ot,,200.0,ltbx,a kid should be loved and longed for
Sunshine,4622,4,cazo_ot,,200.0,ltbx,let's not deprive women the freedom and choice they should have in the first place
Sunshine,4623,1,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,Ang pelikulang Sunshine ay hindi lang simpleng kwento ng isang babae—isa itong salamin sa maraming isyung matagal nang umiikot sa Pilipinas pero pilit pa ring isinasantabi
Sunshine,4623,2,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,Nagawa ng pelikula ito na ilahad ang mga sakit ng sistemang kinabibilangan natin: mula sa pakikibaka ng kababaihan sa kanilang sariling katawan hanggang sa nakakalungkot na estado ng ating healthcare system
Sunshine,4623,3,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,Isa sa pinakamalinaw na ipinupukol ng pelikula ay ang isyu ng aborsyon
Sunshine,4623,4,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,Ipinapakita ng pelikula kung gaano kahirap ang desisyong hinaharap ng mga kababaihan—lalo na sa bansang halos bawal pag-usapan ang reproductive rights
Sunshine,4623,5,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,"Nakakahalit dahil hanggang ngayon, marami pa ring kababaihan ang hindi ganap na malaya sa sarili nilang katawan dahil sa malalim na kapit ng konserbatismong relihiyoso"
Sunshine,4623,6,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa halip na suportahan, hinuhusgahan sila"
Sunshine,4623,7,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa halip na pakinggan, pinapatahimik"
Sunshine,4623,8,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,"At gaya ng ipinapakita sa pelikula, napipilitang harapin ng mga babae ang mga sitwasyong hindi nila pinili, wala man lang ligtas o legal na option para makaligtas"
Sunshine,4623,9,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,"Kasunod nito, mariing binabangga ng pelikula ang realidad ng ating healthcare system"
Sunshine,4623,10,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi na bago ang nakikitang eksena sa ospital: siksikan, kulang sa gamit, at kapos sa espasyo"
Sunshine,4623,11,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,"Dalawa, minsan tatlong ina sa iisang kama—hindi dahil gusto nila, kundi dahil wala talagang mapaglagyan"
Sunshine,4623,12,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,"Ito ang reyalidad na hinaharap ng ordinaryong Pilipino araw-araw, habang ang mga pulitikong may kapangyarihan ay kayang lumipad paabroad para magpagamot sa mas kumpletong pasilidad"
Sunshine,4623,13,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa kabuuan, nagsilbing boses ang Sunshine para sa mga isyung matagal nang dinidinig ngunit hindi pinakikinggan"
Sunshine,4623,14,intjyhnn,,200.0,ltbx,Maris Racal did her best one on this

Sunshine,4628,1,father_saenz,,200.0,ltbx,PUTANGINAMO TITO BOBOT
Sunshine,4629,1,mlcauren,,180.0,ltbx,"The transparency how the society really is was really good, and applause for that because no one can be that strong to put how our society works"
Sunshine,4629,2,mlcauren,,180.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal's acting showed the desperation and the dedication for her dreams, it was sad how much she handled all throughout"
Sunshine,4629,3,mlcauren,,180.0,ltbx,She is really a great actress and no one can change that
Sunshine,4629,4,mlcauren,,180.0,ltbx,"Lastly, the way everything was a real life situation and relatable for people who live nowadays, it was great and FUCK MEN"
Sunshine,4630,1,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,This movie was fun to watch in terms of its setting
Sunshine,4630,2,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,I have been to the gym Sunshine was training in and also the Rizal Sports Complex because I have trained there before in 2015
Sunshine,4630,3,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,"Argh, teenage pregnancy in the Philippines stems from the lack of sex education and advocacy for contraceptives and abortion"
Sunshine,4630,4,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,The fact that we are a mostly Catholic-dominated country or population that strongly adheres to tradition makes it harder for pregnant teenagers to find support
Sunshine,4630,5,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,"They are made to feel ashamed and helpless because even the law says that abortion is illegal, meaning that they do not have a choice but to deliver the child"
Sunshine,4630,6,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine's passion was found in gymnastics, something that she couldn't let go of"
Sunshine,4630,7,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,"She knew that if she were to become a mother (which she isn't ready for, as she explicitly states during her conversation with Miguel and his father), she would have to surrender everything she has worked hard for"
Sunshine,4630,8,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,"Her sister's situatio, who was a former gymnast as well, basically shows that Sunshine's life would eventually become just like hers if she were to proceed with the pregnancy"
Sunshine,4630,9,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,"The doctor was so annoying because that's exactly how the older generation sounds like when stating their opinions about religion, abortion, and chilbirth"
Sunshine,4630,10,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,"I also liked the fact that they tackled topics like sex, autonomy, rape, and incest"
Sunshine,4630,11,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,These are very real in the Philippines and the situation with Ariana and his sister (
Sunshine,4630,12,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,) greatly displayed how messed up it is
Sunshine,4630,13,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,These children have no choice or power over their elders and what makes it sad is that those who should be protecting them are the ones putting them in danger and ruining their lives
Sunshine,4630,14,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,I read somewhere that the little girl that followed Sunshine was her unborn child
Sunshine,4630,15,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,"I also thought of this throughout the movie and it even made more sense when the little girl said ""Gets ko na"" after Sunshine practiced her piece with a passionate smile and aura that could be felt by the audience"
Sunshine,4630,16,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,I love that Sunshine chose herself and her dreams over being a mother
Sunshine,4630,17,danii_2,,180.0,ltbx,A child born into this world who would eventually live in substandard conditions just because people say they should be born won't truly experience a life that should be lived
Sunshine,4631,1,kyjinji,,160.0,ltbx,fuck men and fuck religion
Sunshine,4632,1,tubbs,,120.0,ltbx,"The screenplay has a strong female focus, with limited screen time for the males, and is all the better for it"

Sunshine,4637,6,lorded24,,160.0,ltbx,"-if you’re looking for a safe abortion pls tingin kayo sa r/abortion sa reddit :))) wag sa twitter, wag sa quiapo (for now ayon pa lang ang way) :)))"

Sunshine,4646,2,octwo,,200.0,ltbx,A very realistic movie
Sunshine,4646,3,octwo,,200.0,ltbx,ang ganda ng portrayal ng stigma at discrimination na nararanasan ng mga kababaihang dumadaan sa ganitong situation sa bansa natin
Sunshine,4646,4,octwo,,200.0,ltbx,"At, sana buksan na ng mga Pilipino ang kanilang isipan at intindihin na ang abortion is healthcare at hindi dapat ituring na uri nang pagpaslang"
Sunshine,4646,5,octwo,,200.0,ltbx,"Also, I appreciate how this movie shows na accessing safe abortion care from clinics is far better than relying on herbal remedies or sa mga faithhealers"
Sunshine,4646,6,octwo,,200.0,ltbx,"And of course, this also shows the effects of our flawed healthcare system, it's inaccessible and expensive, pushing women to resort to those kinds of practices"
Sunshine,4646,7,octwo,,200.0,ltbx,"But, It's important to remember that we have the rights to make a choice about our own bodies, but we should make those choices wisely and safely"
Sunshine,4647,1,thoughtstala,,160.0,ltbx,moral lesson: lalaki ang sisira sa lahat

Sunshine,4652,1,lemonyita_ii,,200.0,ltbx,watching this with my conservative catholic family felt progressive…
Sunshine,4653,1,gabrieiie,,200.0,ltbx,Give 'yung casting grabe ba
Sunshine,4654,2,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"A harrowing, claustrophobic, yet essential sprint across Manila streets"
Sunshine,4654,3,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"The craft here really shines, at just 90 or so minutes the film feels tightly-paced and confidently crafted through Jadaone's masterful direction, yet it still swings wide over several discussions and thoughts over its major theme in an arguably short amount of time"
Sunshine,4654,4,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,Mind you there's an element here that I'm not the biggest fan of-- I think the film could have actually eliminated it altogether as it feels inelegant especially against the overt realism of the rest of the film
Sunshine,4654,5,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,But otherwise it's easy to overlook this compared to how wise the rest of the film is
Sunshine,4654,6,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"It culminates in a truly lovely finale that uses simplicity to great, moving effect, especially when juxtaposed to how much noise and haste the rest of the film's heavy atmosphere is"
Sunshine,4654,7,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"Gets ko na why ""Gets ko na"" became an easily recognisable, even arguably iconic line from this film"
Sunshine,4654,8,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"Besides the stellar direction, the rest of the departments here really shine"
Sunshine,4654,9,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"The camera and production design really stand out here, painting a crowded and cramped world"
Sunshine,4654,10,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,The performances are simply captivating
Sunshine,4654,11,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal truly carries this hefty narrative, but Annika Co really exudes such natural confidence that steals the scene whenever she appears"
Sunshine,4654,12,dicotalvarado,,180.0,ltbx,"Ultimately, this really feels like important cinema from simply one of the best Filipino filmmakers out there"
Sunshine,4655,1,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,Sobrang tapang ng pelikulang 'to
Sunshine,4655,2,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,Sobrang tapang ni direk tonet
Sunshine,4655,3,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,Sobrang tapang ni Sunshine
Sunshine,4655,4,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,"Sobrang tapang ng mga kababaihang nagpapatuloy, lumalaban sa mga hamon ng lipunan"
Sunshine,4655,5,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,"Dinala ako ng pelikulang 'to sa kung anong klaseng lipunan ang kailangang harapin ng mga kababaihan araw-araw — lahat ng husga, dikta, at pangungurakot"
Sunshine,4655,6,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,"Wala sa kahit anong batas or salita ng diyos ang makatutulong sa mga taong kagaya ni Sunshine, kung 'di ang maayos na health care system, maayos at tapat na gobyerno, at isang mapagpalayang lipunan — malaya sa kahit anong dikta at husga ng mga taong hindi kailanma'y namroblema sa kanilang kaligtasan kapag maglalakad mag-isa sa madilim na kalsada, sa kanilang kasuotan at pananamit, sa kung anong pananaw ng iba sa kanilang katawan, sa kakayahan makapag-luwal ng anak, sa mga tingin at pagnanasa ng mga mabababang-uri, at sa mga marami pang bagay"
Sunshine,4655,7,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,Napakaraming aspeto ng pelikulang Sunshine ang paulit-ulit sinasampal sa atin para lang magising sa realidad ang bulok na lipunang 'to
Sunshine,4655,8,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,"Isa na rito ang pagbibigay sa mga kababaihan ang kalayaang mamili, kalayaang magdesisyon, at kalayaang mangarap, kasama ang proteksyon para sa mga batang katulad ni Mary Grace"
Sunshine,4655,9,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,"Ilang kababaihan at bata pa ba ang kinakailangang maranasan ang hirap nina Sunshine at Mary Grace bago mamulat at umusad ang lipunang sakop pa rin ng makalumang pananaw — mga pananaw na hindi nila alam ay unti-unting ginigilitan at pinapatay ang karapatan, kalayaan, at kakayahan ng mga kababaihan"
Sunshine,4655,10,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang mga taong tulad nina Bobot, nanay ni Mary Grace, at Miggy ang tunay na lumalabag sa sa utos ng diyos, ang tunay na gumagawa ng krimen, at ang tunay sa nagpapabulok pa sa inuuod na sistema para sa mga kababaihan at bata, hindi ang mga taong tulad ni Sunshine na pinanghahawakan ang karapatan nilang mangarap at magkaroon ng desisyon para sa kanilang sariling katawan"
Sunshine,4655,11,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,Tangina gaano ba kahirap isipin yon
Sunshine,4655,12,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,Napakaganda ng cinematography
Sunshine,4655,13,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,"Lahat ng baho, usok, lagkit, at sikip ng Maynila; lahat ng mga matang mapanghusga, mga taong makasarili, mga komentong nananakal, at bigat na dala-dala araw-araw ng mga babae at bata, lahat ito ipinakita"
Sunshine,4655,14,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,"Ibang klaseng sining ang ipinakita nina direk tonet, maris, jennica, annika, at sa lahat ng cast ng pelikula"
Sunshine,4655,15,filmswithje,,200.0,ltbx,Mahigpit na yakap para sa lahat ng Sunshine na patuloy bumabangon at lumalaban

Sunshine,4656,2,aviloria,,200.0,ltbx,fuck men
Sunshine,4657,1,naxiee,,200.0,ltbx,perfect representation of how trash men can be
Sunshine,4658,1,asheng,,160.0,ltbx,This film really reminded me that sometimes even the most seemingly trivial decisions—like whether to use a condom or not by relying on the excuse of pulling out—can have huge effects on one’s life
Sunshine,4658,2,asheng,,160.0,ltbx,"It also shows how having no access to proper medical care for abortion (since it is illegal) is so unfair, especially for children who were taken advantage of, which leads them to use unsafe methods that put their lives at risk"
Sunshine,4658,3,asheng,,160.0,ltbx,I really applaud Sunshine’s determination to chase her dreams and stay strong in the face of her friends ignoring her and her boyfriend not wanting to take responsibility for their child
Sunshine,4658,4,asheng,,160.0,ltbx,"Aside from her, I also applaud her family for staying by her side regardless of what her decision may be"
Sunshine,4658,5,asheng,,160.0,ltbx,"I applaud this film for showing the hardships of being a woman—specifically, a woman in the Philippines—surrounded by noise, distractions, and judgment"
Sunshine,4659,1,mishia,,160.0,ltbx,not the pastor kid
Sunshine,4660,1,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"""Naiintindihan mo na"

Sunshine,4660,3,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"""Whenever somebody asks me why I support abortion, I will ask them to watch this film—especially now that it is widely accessible through Netflix"
Sunshine,4660,4,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"The ability to choose for a woman's own welfare and decide for the future of a child is a fundamental right, it should never be a debate"
Sunshine,4660,5,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,Bodily autonomy is a human right
Sunshine,4660,6,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,We can use religious morals as a basis to weigh the decision but NEVER force it on somebody and leverage that same bullshit to guilt-trip them
Sunshine,4660,7,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,Safe-sex should be promoted not shushed by religious parties; accessible care for abortion should be a must We shouldn't demonize doctors and women who want that for themselves
Sunshine,4660,8,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Like the line, ""Flush out the noise"", these unneeded external noises should never be heard in the first place, all throughout the film it catches up to Sunshine"
Sunshine,4660,9,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Hangang, hanga, ako sa'yo Sunshine"
Sunshine,4660,10,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"Dreams should never be impeded because of a mistake, she's still a teen who's transitioning to adulthood"
Sunshine,4660,11,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,She should be allowed to live her life not being worried about a child she never wanted in the first place
Sunshine,4660,12,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"And to all the women out there, who's met with arguably stronger hostility, I hope that laws, people, the Philippines becomes more friendly to you"
Sunshine,4660,13,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,It should be like that
Sunshine,4660,14,matteodo_,,180.0,ltbx,"I never doubted Maris Racal's ability to act, and all I can say is they found jackpot by casting her as Sunshine and casting Annika as the little girl that appears all throughout the film"

Sunshine,4664,2,rrikieu,,200.0,ltbx,"it highlights what truly feels like na maging babae sa pinas, lalo na pag di ka mayaman, at yung pangarap mo at talento mo yung aahon sayo, gets ko na was a very good deliverance of closure to sunshine's internal dilemma, sure Ariana was a character here but I see it as her manifestation of guilt or mayhaps holding her back but then again sunshine loved the sport, she loved it"
Sunshine,4664,3,rrikieu,,200.0,ltbx,"sunshine also said she's not ready to be a mother and if tinuloy niya yon alam niya din sa sarili niya na yung pangarap niya di na niya makamit, sure this may seem as a selfish choice to others pero tangina ang sakit, tangina gets ko na"

Sunshine,4675,1,kuukunyu,,200.0,ltbx,"A disturbingly realistic film that tackles on the disadvantages of living in a country that criminalizes abortion—discouraging women’s bodily autonomy and integrity, huge risks on women’s reproductive health, and so on"
Sunshine,4675,2,kuukunyu,,200.0,ltbx,"It is a dark cinematic film that does not only impress one with its amazing visuals and role portrayal from the cast lineup, but also leaves you pondering on the bold message it screams throughout"
Sunshine,4676,1,fishphileo,,160.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal is ready for leading roles, and Sunshine gives her everything to work with"
Sunshine,4676,2,fishphileo,,160.0,ltbx,"It helps that a stellar ensemble of women round out the supporting roles too, with Annika Co haunting her like an undeniable reality"
Sunshine,4676,3,fishphileo,,160.0,ltbx,"Its plot, certainly a conversation-starter, doesn't all the way succeed with all its creative choices, but it's welcome forward motion for showing that women's choices command respect even if it doesn't fit the ones you decide for yourself"
Sunshine,4676,4,fishphileo,,160.0,ltbx,"Another thing everyone should agree on is that Antoinette Jadaone has her finger on the pulse of what Filipinos, and the cinephile-going population of the country, need to discuss"

Sunshine,4678,4,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,”a striking detail that struck me the most is the contrast between the very first time we watch sunshine step onto the mat and the last time she ever does
Sunshine,4678,5,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"at first, you hear this deep and intense noise of her drowning the music, her choach’s instructions, and even the sound of her own breathing"
Sunshine,4678,6,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,and the noise only goes louder and harsher each time we see her practice her routine while she quietly endures the devastating ordeal of attempting to terminate her pregnancy
Sunshine,4678,7,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"what started off as a sound to describe her pressure and desperation to reach her olympic dreams, now becomes the sound of her fear, her secrecy, and her grief"
Sunshine,4678,8,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"this says so much about what it means to be a woman in the philippines: how suffering must be hidden, how autonomy becomes something to apologize for, and how you’re expected to quietly tend to your own wounds you never asked to carry"
Sunshine,4678,9,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"and sunshine carries her decision with guilt, so much that she looks at the unnamed young girl like she’s staring at every version of her future that never got the chance to choose"
Sunshine,4678,10,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,but she dreams
Sunshine,4678,11,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,she dreams so much
Sunshine,4678,12,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,and she dreams for more
Sunshine,4678,13,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"and she stands firm, because what’s so wrong about wanting a life that belongs to her"
Sunshine,4678,14,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,what’s so wrong about refusing to be swallowed by sacrifice
Sunshine,4678,15,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,what’s so wrong about refusing to become another woman she didn’t want to be
Sunshine,4678,16,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,“gets ko na
Sunshine,4678,17,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"”so as we see the last time she practices on the mat, we finally hear the sound of the music, not the deep sound of pressure of fear, but a rhythm that finally belongs to her"
Sunshine,4678,18,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"the gymnasium is dark, she’s alone and she’s pale, but this is the brightest she has ever looked in the past hour i’ve watched the film"
Sunshine,4678,19,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"she moves with a softness that feels earnest, like this is the first time her body isn’t performing to impress or survive, only to exist"
Sunshine,4678,20,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"she dances gracefully, probably the most she ever has, and it’s a moment that shows us that she has unapologetically reclaimed something no one ever thought she deserved: the right to choose herself"
Sunshine,4678,21,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"and for the first time, she is no longer a girl she’s afraid to be—she is a woman who has already decided"
Sunshine,4678,22,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"i hope more people watch sunshine (2024) not to criticize women with early and unintended pregnancies, but to meet them with grace and empathy for their fears, their confusion, and their fight to claim what should have always been theirs in the first place—their autonomy, dignity, and right to have access to healthcare without being made to beg for it"
Sunshine,4678,23,mobh100,,180.0,ltbx,"patuloy nating pahalagahan ang kalusugan, karapatan, at mga kwento ng kababaihan minus half star kasi parang kaya pa natin i-improve yung dialogues, direk"

Sunshine,4679,1,gelatooo,,180.0,ltbx,Philippine cinema is not dead and Sunshine is a living proof of it
Sunshine,4679,2,gelatooo,,180.0,ltbx,this film has so much emotional depth and thought-provoking scenes that captures perfectly what it feels like to be a woman living in a patriarchal society- in a country where hypocrisy runs rampant and making decisions for yourself is often frowned upon
Sunshine,4679,3,gelatooo,,180.0,ltbx,"why is it that women are the ones always blamed, shackled and punished for choices they make- choices driven by the need to prioritize their health and safety in situations they did not fully create"
Sunshine,4679,4,gelatooo,,180.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone's best film yet so far, and i'd say it because of its boldness, for addressing an elephant, a taboo topic that most of us are not ready to talk about, but eventually we must"
Sunshine,4679,5,gelatooo,,180.0,ltbx,"it's already hard enough that we don't have proper access to healthcare, even worse to be scrutinized by society simply for choosing yourself"

Sunshine,4681,1,mhoeriarty,,120.0,ltbx,Agree with prof cuartero who said that people who write would not appreciate sunshine
Sunshine,4681,2,mhoeriarty,,120.0,ltbx,"Employing the child character as a form of her unborn child is tasteless, it once more reinforces the very discussion surrounding women’s autonomy over their pregnancy—a life is not born the moment that it’s conceived"
Sunshine,4681,3,mhoeriarty,,120.0,ltbx,"We should not treat it as such, and must move forward without having to empathize with centuries old rhetorics about women’s body that really falls back into bioessentialist dogma"
Sunshine,4681,4,mhoeriarty,,120.0,ltbx,This seems like a film that is afraid to insult the very audience it is intended for

Sunshine,4690,8,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"A majority of the contestants were women, and two of the mothers interviewed, Elsa and Rosalie, had 15 and 8 children respectively"
Sunshine,4690,9,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"Elsa, the 63-year-old woman with 12 living children and 3 deceased children recited the ages of her 12 children from the oldest, 46, to the youngest, 24"
Sunshine,4690,10,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"The gap between the older ones is 1-2 years apart, while the younger ones are about 2-3 years apart"
Sunshine,4690,11,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"Elsa confesses how difficult life is for her and her children, spouting how without God she would not be as strong as she is today, living off 300 pesos everyday"
Sunshine,4690,12,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"When Vice Ganda asked Elsa why she has so many children, Elsa plainly said, “Ehhh di ako marunong mag family planning eh,” inciting some laughter in the audience"
Sunshine,4690,13,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"Elsa even revealed that the father was absent and had a different family, leaving the Filipina mother and her 12 living children to figure out how to live"
Sunshine,4690,14,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"The second woman, Rosalie, with 8 children echoed the same sentiments as Elsa"
Sunshine,4690,15,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"She sells sampaguita every day with no days off at the age of 60 something; her children married and had their children early; the highest level of schooling one of her children attained was high school, but never graduated; her children sell sampaguita with no days off; and she has 19 grandchildren to look after in a home with no roof above their heads"
Sunshine,4690,16,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"What Sunshine, Elsa, and Rosalie have in common is how the patriarchy confines them to suffocating religious ideals, a corrupt and conservative government, and poor healthcare"
Sunshine,4690,17,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,What Sunshine does not have in common with the two women is the ignorance in family planning
Sunshine,4690,18,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine is no one's mother
Sunshine,4690,19,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"It should never be a reason to have 7 or more children at an early age, with no means of support financially and emotionally, because it is ""God's gift,"" or because they simply want to experience having children"

Sunshine,4690,22,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"Children do not decide when they want to be born, so there should be conscious efforts to assess if the environment people live in can secure their children's/childrens' future(s), especially in a country like the Philippines"

Sunshine,4690,24,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"There is also the inability for Filipinos in poverty to seek other options, or have the real agency to pursue aspirations"
Sunshine,4690,25,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"While there is such thing as being irresponsible, Filipino women are a laughingstock in conversations surrounding teen pregnancy and reproductive rights—when realistically—they should have the choice to protect themselves, but are instead ruthlessly flayed off by the very system that commands kindness"

Sunshine,4690,28,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"Annika appears whenever Sunshine does something that will affect the fetus, and often berates Sunshine for being ""bad"
Sunshine,4690,29,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,""" At first, I was hesitant towards the idea of Annika representing Sunshine's potential child, because it can mistakenly support the pro-life argument of murder (which Annika actually yells at Sunshine), until Annika says, ""ang pangarap ko ay pangarap niya"

Sunshine,4690,31,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"In a sense, Sunshine and Annika are the same person"
Sunshine,4690,32,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine should be able to pursue her dreams successfully the same way Annika, along with other living and future children, should feel secure enough to be ambitious"
Sunshine,4690,33,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"The message further builds itself with Ariana, Annika's friend and the 13-year-old girl's potential child"
Sunshine,4690,34,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"Ariana wants to be the first gay president, but how can they do that in an environment with a r*pist, a neglectful grandmother, and a KID whose choice was stolen"
Sunshine,4690,35,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"If mothers like Elsa and Rosalie can somehow ""get away"" with no family planning, how can Sunshine and the 13-year-old girl survive in a Catholic Philippines"
Sunshine,4690,36,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"The Reproductive Health Law was passed in December 2012, and efforts to educate the masses and distribute contraceptives have improved, yet there is still a high percentage of unintended pregnancies, AIDS rates, and JUSKO PO—ISSUES WITH BUDGETING (source 1),(source 2)"
Sunshine,4690,37,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"The Philippines will never progress as a nation if objectivity is blocked by the grip the church and the state have on one another, which ultimately and consistently harms Filipinas who give their best yesterday, today, and tomorrow"
Sunshine,4690,38,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"I am certain that Sunshine is not the first film to be unapologetically bold and loud for the Filipina, but it is certainly the first to make rounds among the casual movie-goers and the general Filipino"
Sunshine,4690,39,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"It is not a perfect film and such flawed instances are where:- the narrative of Sunshine being an Olympic-level athlete clashes with the lack of popularity shown outside of practice- the cinematography is poetic without a doubt, but the scenes of Sunshine messaging her Coach, Miggy, and Thea isn't synchronized with Sunshine typing on the phone/isn't even her actually texting"
Sunshine,4690,40,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"If you're going to place emphasis on the quietest scenes, I believe that something as minor as texting should be clean (this was the same quip I had with the controller scene in Anora like c'mon now"
Sunshine,4690,41,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,)- the cinematography can be too poetic
Sunshine,4690,42,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"for example, the shot of Sunshine looking out of her hotel window with the Metro Manila noise juxtaposing her quiet turmoil contributes to Sunshine purposely not drowning out the noise (or the failure to"

Sunshine,4690,44,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,"the juxtaposition felt like it was purely for aesthetics- the Jojo Rabbit esque character of Annika and Ariana was VERY risky (re: pro-life arguments)- maybe it's just me but the film gives you some breathers with comedic aspects in things like ""no bad words"" and Annika proceeding to say ""putangina"" which I found myself like ""damn girl"
Sunshine,4690,45,nelletella,,160.0,ltbx,""" though it makes me wonder if those who do not share the same ideals as me laughed at it the same way the audience laughed at Elsa in Laro Laro Pick"

Sunshine,4713,4,marjimjim,,200.0,ltbx,This film deserves more recognition
Sunshine,4714,1,abheet2003,,200.0,ltbx,one of those films that will turn women into even bigger misandrists than they already are (no man should be offended by this if he’s a real one) and make men realise how privileged we actually are that we don’t need to give up on our dreams and ambitions just because of the expectations of raising a child we didn’t ask for
Sunshine,4714,2,abheet2003,,200.0,ltbx,i will forever be pro-choice and each and every man should be one because we should never have any say in what women do with their bodies when we have all the privilege to ignore their hardships and turn a blind eye to them so the least we could do is respect it when a woman doesn’t want to go through 9 months of turmoil
Sunshine,4714,3,abheet2003,,200.0,ltbx,praying that the women of the phillipines get to see a day their country legalises abortion as soon as possible

Sunshine,4716,2,8443,,180.0,ltbx,"It lays bare the harsh realities of poverty, peer pressure, religious influence, and Sunshine’s desperation"
Sunshine,4716,3,8443,,180.0,ltbx,A dream or motherhood
Sunshine,4716,4,8443,,180.0,ltbx,It captures what abortion looks like in a deeply conservative society
Sunshine,4716,5,8443,,180.0,ltbx,The people she meets aren’t fictional inventions but reflections of thousands of real girls facing the same choices
Sunshine,4716,6,8443,,180.0,ltbx,"Choice here isn’t just personal, it’s cultural and political"

Sunshine,4719,1,highpixel,,180.0,ltbx,"It showed something that is still considered taboo, not being scared of showing the realities of the desperation, humiliation, struggles, and one's dream slipping off"
Sunshine,4719,2,highpixel,,180.0,ltbx,"It did not just show one perspective but multiple, which will really make you think about the implications that come along these kinds of situations"

Sunshine,4719,4,highpixel,,180.0,ltbx,I do think more people need to see it

Sunshine,4720,6,wilreign,,180.0,ltbx,She's such a strong female character and I love the subtlety in which they showed it in the movie
Sunshine,4720,7,wilreign,,180.0,ltbx,nanay siya pero never niya pinafeel sa kapatid niya na dapat i-keep ni Sunshine yung bata dahil lang siya kineep niya yung kanya
Sunshine,4720,8,wilreign,,180.0,ltbx,"pinakita rin na kadalasan talaga kapwa babae ang tutulong sayo, sad reality kahit na dapat may katuwang ka in the form of a partner (the one who knocked you up in the first place), it's always women helping other women- even in situations where they themselves don't have much (the maternity ward scene, just a whole community of mothers caring for each other) and even when they have issues of their own (Sunshine helping out the younger girl that was also pregnant all while dealing with her own pregnancy) the 13 year old girl who was revealed to have been GAY and a victim of her uncle's story was very impactful"
Sunshine,4720,9,wilreign,,180.0,ltbx,nakakalungkot na yun ang realidad ng karamihan sa mga batang babae sa bansa
Sunshine,4720,10,wilreign,,180.0,ltbx,"abuse is so normalized and looked over, especially in marginalized areas"
Sunshine,4720,11,wilreign,,180.0,ltbx,that's why we need more Dra Helenas in the world

Sunshine,4726,1,xcomma,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine told a well-rounded story on abortion in the Philippines, and how the lack of safe options for women disproportionately affects those in vulnerable positions even"
Sunshine,4726,2,xcomma,,200.0,ltbx,"The ""ayoko maging nanay"" line toward the end, when Sunshine met her ex's father, was so powerful to me"
Sunshine,4726,3,xcomma,,200.0,ltbx,"Because she's making a choice that men do so easily, and it shows how much women need to have that option, too, specifically SAFE ones"
Sunshine,4726,4,xcomma,,200.0,ltbx,"""What if the baby can cure cancer"
Sunshine,4726,5,xcomma,,200.0,ltbx,Blah blah…

Sunshine,4727,2,cyluvspicy,,200.0,ltbx,"i love all the subtle scenes — like sa jeep na may “gift of god” sa harap, the super makadiyos billboards, every convo with annika and her gay friend (ariana), and yung scenes na kahit nasa crowd siya, you still notice her"
Sunshine,4727,3,cyluvspicy,,200.0,ltbx,"alam mo yun, kahit sobrang simple at halos walang make-up, she still shines"
Sunshine,4727,4,cyluvspicy,,200.0,ltbx,And the cinematography is a solid 10 out of 10

Sunshine,4727,10,cyluvspicy,,200.0,ltbx,"as a woman, it just made me realize again how much we deal with"
Sunshine,4727,11,cyluvspicy,,200.0,ltbx,"it’s not just a good movie it’s the type na kahit okay ka naman, pero pag may sad song, bigla kang nagrereflect"
Sunshine,4727,12,cyluvspicy,,200.0,ltbx,that’s exactly the energy it gave me
Sunshine,4727,13,cyluvspicy,,200.0,ltbx,"kudos to the director, and of course maris, who always gives justice to every character"

Sunshine,4739,2,orangebaby,,180.0,ltbx,It takes courage to empower abortion and women’s rights in a country that has been conservative and patriarchal for the longest time
Sunshine,4739,3,orangebaby,,180.0,ltbx,I really really loved how the film doesn’t shy away from unraveling the realities of a Filipino woman
Sunshine,4739,4,orangebaby,,180.0,ltbx,"The crowded and unorganized public hospitals, the irony of churches and black markets, and the innate nature of self-righteous men trying to dictate a woman’s life"

Sunshine,4740,8,junasine,,200.0,ltbx,"sa bansang walang maayos at ligtas na healthcare para sa mga kababaihan, saan pa siya lalapit"
Sunshine,4740,9,junasine,,200.0,ltbx,"kahit nung dinala siya sa ospital dahil sa epekto nung pampalaglag, hinusgahan pa siya"

Sunshine,4740,11,junasine,,200.0,ltbx,i love the “what should have been her daughter” na character na sinusundan si sunshine sa bawat sulok ng maynila
Sunshine,4740,12,junasine,,200.0,ltbx,alam natin sa umpisa palang na ayaw ni sunshine maging nanay at gagawa siya ng paraan para magpalaglag
Sunshine,4740,13,junasine,,200.0,ltbx,pero hindi parin mawawala yung parang “guilt” na meron ang isang babae lalo na’t lumaki tayo sa katolikong bansa
Sunshine,4740,14,junasine,,200.0,ltbx,kita rin ito dun sa pagpunta ni sunshine sa simbahan tuwing dumadaan siya sa quiapo
Sunshine,4740,15,junasine,,200.0,ltbx,"mahirap siguro hindi isipin ang mga “what ifs” pero kung hindi handa ang isang babae maging nanay, hindi siya handa"

Sunshine,4740,18,junasine,,200.0,ltbx,kasi totoo naman
Sunshine,4740,19,junasine,,200.0,ltbx,ano ang gagawin ng isang babae (at sa lagay ni mary grace na 13 palang) kapag ni-r*pe siya ng tito niya
Sunshine,4740,20,junasine,,200.0,ltbx,hindi kailanman magiging handa maging ina ang labintatlong gulang na bata lalo na’t bunga ito ng abuse sa bahay

Sunshine,4784,4,pelikuliara,,200.0,ltbx,mary grace's story adds so much to how deeply the film tackles the conversation around abortion as well as making it known to the audience that abortion is not a black and white subject

Sunshine,4819,2,seungseungz,,200.0,ltbx,"ang hirap hirap na nga maging babae, dagdag parusa pa pag isa kang babae sa pilipinas"
Sunshine,4819,3,seungseungz,,200.0,ltbx,"pano na ang mga babaeng tulad ni mary grace, mga BATA sa laylayan ng lipunan at walang suporta"

Sunshine,4820,1,ayrin_,,,ltbx,sana ma-gets ng mga ano
Sunshine,4821,1,brieventura,,140.0,ltbx,religion is a coping mechanism
Sunshine,4821,2,brieventura,,140.0,ltbx,and this film is a proof that we only reach for prayer when life gets too heavy
Sunshine,4821,3,brieventura,,140.0,ltbx,"but, that's not really the point"
Sunshine,4821,4,brieventura,,140.0,ltbx,the film leaves its truth between the lines

Sunshine,4823,2,john_dnvrs,,160.0,ltbx,painful and beautiful at the same time
Sunshine,4823,3,john_dnvrs,,160.0,ltbx,maris racal is literally engraving her name as one of the promising actress of this generation (i think wala nang ibang fitting for this role beside her)
Sunshine,4825,1,rvnische,,200.0,ltbx,kailan kaya magegets ng pilipinas
Sunshine,4826,1,summersnowqueen,,180.0,ltbx,"so poignant, and definitely should be rewatched kasi ang daming mga little details that further cement this world, this reality that sunshine lives in that thinks women are the problem, yet they are also the ones doomed to fix and “save” it"
Sunshine,4826,2,summersnowqueen,,180.0,ltbx,"unfortunately, it’s the philippines (derogatory)"
Sunshine,4826,3,summersnowqueen,,180.0,ltbx,"this film accomplishes its goal really well: not to advocate for abortion, but to allow women to make that choice if they so wish to"

Sunshine,4827,1,emmanuel_d925,,,ltbx,sorry po papa god
Sunshine,4828,1,mmelchian,,180.0,ltbx,what hit me the most was how the film shows society’s pressure without ever yelling at you
Sunshine,4828,2,mmelchian,,180.0,ltbx,"the judgement, the shame, the rules you’re supposed to follow — it’s all there, always in the background, shaping every choice she makes"
Sunshine,4828,3,mmelchian,,180.0,ltbx,"but then there are these tiny moments of kindness, little glimmers of hope, and it’s those moments that make the sadness bearableyou really feel her pain, her confusion, her stubborn spark to survive and keep dreaming, even when everything seems against her"
Sunshine,4828,4,mmelchian,,180.0,ltbx,and the story doesn’t give you easy answers — it just lets you sit with the reality of what it’s like to be a girl in a world that doesn’t make it easypero na-realize ko na the girl who follows sunshine and calls her “murderer” is not a real person
Sunshine,4828,5,mmelchian,,180.0,ltbx,she represents the harsh judgment sunshine feels from others and the guilt she carries inside herself
Sunshine,4828,6,mmelchian,,180.0,ltbx,"the girl is basically the voice of society telling sunshine she did something wrong, even when the situation is more complicated"
Sunshine,4828,7,mmelchian,,180.0,ltbx,she’s also sunshine’s own fear and self-blame turned into a person
Sunshine,4828,8,mmelchian,,180.0,ltbx,"in short, the girl is the symbol of the guilt and pressure that keep haunting sunshineyung nasa jeep scene fav ko kasi pinakita na how overwhelmed sunshine is without her having to say a word"
Sunshine,4828,9,mmelchian,,180.0,ltbx,"while she’s sitting in the jeep, everything around her feels loud, messy, and fast—parang tuloy-tuloy yung mundo habang siya, nakastuck"
Sunshine,4828,10,mmelchian,,180.0,ltbx,"when she starts crying quietly, it shows how much she’s been holding in for so long"

Sunshine,4838,8,happihayme,,200.0,ltbx,"sa bawat sulok may mga umaalingawngaw na tigang, ang pagtangkklik sayo kasi ika nga “horny” sila, pag-ostracize at pag-iskandalo, yung preachy tangents nila para lang itemper ang karamdaman mo, the misogny, the commodification, the devastating __ of it all"
Sunshine,4838,9,happihayme,,200.0,ltbx,"yung paglagay ng bag sa harap kasi baka manakawan, yung pagtago ng pampalaglag sa mga imahen ni mama mary, at yung desperasyon (mula sa labas ng simbahan kasi ikaw ay naging “makasalanan) sa musmos at awa ng diyos"
Sunshine,4838,10,happihayme,,200.0,ltbx,"sa kinaingay at sulasok ng siyudad, nariyan ang mga pusong may kinakapitang mga pangarap; at kung kailan andyan na ang pinakaninanais mo, wala ka nga palang karapatan sa iyong katawan"

Sunshine,4838,14,happihayme,,200.0,ltbx,there are days na makikipagdebate ako sa parents ko at matatapos sa mga dabog at pagkulong sa mga kwarto
Sunshine,4838,15,happihayme,,200.0,ltbx,"bilang pro-choice, bilang babae, at bilang isang tao, wala talagang ikakukumpara yung mental process of choosing between your dream and something that wasn’t even in your control (kasi nga sabi hindi ipuputok sa loob)—this movie has it all: the catholic guilt, yung mga minuto ng katahimikang naaaning dahil sa kakaisip, yung lito at pagkamatigas sa iyong desisyon"
Sunshine,4838,16,happihayme,,200.0,ltbx,"i’d like to imagine sunshine lived the ribbon kasi nakokontrol niya ito: na sa bawat pitik ng kamay sumusunod ang ribbon na kahit anong gawin ay maganda tignan at delikadesa mahulog, kahit anong buhol, kaya pa ring mahulas, kahit anong gulo sa galaw, maganda pa ring ang kinalalabasan"

Sunshine,4838,19,happihayme,,200.0,ltbx,"now, clad in her shimmering pink and purple bedazzled spandex, she walks out with the brightest smile in her force and, like the ribbon she’s been acquainted with since childhood, is finally able to take control of her own life"

Sunshine,4839,2,peachofferings,,200.0,ltbx,What stays with you long after Sunshine ends is how the film treats every moment as something pulled straight from real Filipino girlhood
Sunshine,4839,3,peachofferings,,200.0,ltbx,"You see it in the small, mundane ways Sunshine tries to keep herself together like the way she tightens her jaw during training to hide the panic creeping up her spine, how she forces a neutral expression when adults around her throw judgment disguised as concern and the humiliation of realizing everyone expects her to handle a crisis she never chose"
Sunshine,4839,4,peachofferings,,200.0,ltbx,Girls grow up by being punished for becoming women
Sunshine,4839,5,peachofferings,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is still a teenager, but the moment her pregnancy becomes known, people start talking to her like she owes them maturity, penance, and accountability she was never taught to carry"

Sunshine,4862,1,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,"[ system log : 001 ]user : haziah | age : 23status : active // processingI liked Sunshine because it speaks volumes about the lack of real sex education among teenagers—how so many are left to navigate consequences without ever being given proper knowledge, guidance, or protection"
Sunshine,4862,2,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,"It shows how quickly people are forced into rigid sides—pro-choice or pro-life—without being allowed the space to exist as confused, scared, and human first"
Sunshine,4862,3,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,"I didn’t like it only because Maris Racal’s acting was phenomenal—raw, restrained, and painfully real—but because the film chose to center understanding instead of judgment"
Sunshine,4862,4,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,It didn’t sensationalize the situation; it made you sit with it
Sunshine,4862,5,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,"I liked it because it treated the experience as what it truly is: a life-altering moment that cannot be simplified into slogans, morals, or online arguments"
Sunshine,4862,6,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,It showed how heavy one decision can feel when the world is already crashing down on you
Sunshine,4862,7,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,I liked it because it refuses to make the audience comfortable
Sunshine,4862,8,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,"It doesn’t beg for sympathy, it doesn’t chase approval, and it doesn’t try to make itself digestible for everyone"
Sunshine,4862,9,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,"And most of all, I liked it because it never tells you what the “right” answer is"
Sunshine,4862,10,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,It simply lays everything bare and lets you face it on your own
Sunshine,4862,11,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,"It allows you to choose what to feel, what to believe, and what to carry after the credits roll"
Sunshine,4862,12,haziah,,200.0,ltbx,"Some people say it lacked something—especially in its length—that it should’ve been longer, that it ended too soon"

Sunshine,4959,2,iameelle,,160.0,ltbx,especially jeannica's character (sunshine's sister) what stood out to me abt “Sunshine” is how it handles abortion without turning it into shock value or moral debate
Sunshine,4959,3,iameelle,,160.0,ltbx,"the film treats it the way real life does, quietly, privately, and w a kind of heaviness that doesn’t need big explanations"
Sunshine,4959,4,iameelle,,160.0,ltbx,"it shows how a situation like this doesn’t happen in a vacuum; it’s shaped by family, religion, money, expectations, fear, and the silence surrounding women’s choices, seeing how, in the film, women were denied healthcare even in life or death situations bc of the values and systems upheld in this country"

Sunshine,4959,14,iameelle,,160.0,ltbx,the movie doesn’t try to justify anything or convince u what is right
Sunshine,4959,15,iameelle,,160.0,ltbx,"instead, it shows the reality of how young people end up dealing w choices they were never prepared for"
Sunshine,4959,16,iameelle,,160.0,ltbx,"it’s not dramatic, not preachy, just painfully honest"
Sunshine,4959,17,iameelle,,160.0,ltbx,"the long pauses, the still shots, the way conversations trail off… it all reflects how hard it is to say something out loud when yk u’ll be judged before u’re understood"

Sunshine,5086,1,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"SAGOT SA PELIKULANG “SUNSHINE”: HINDI GUGUSTUHIN NG BATA ANG MAMATAY SA ABORSYON KONTRA SA PINAKITA SA PELIKULA----------------------------Paalala: Ito ay dati naming Facebook post na muli naming inilabas dahil nasa Netflix na ang pelikulang ""Sunshine"
Sunshine,5086,2,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,""" Para sa nagnanais na malaman kung sino ang ""unlikely guide"" sa caption, basahin ang post dito"
Sunshine,5086,3,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"----------------------------Matapos maibalita ang pelikulang “Sunshine” ni Maris Racal, inaasahan ko na ang pagsuporta nito sa aborsyon o ang pagkitil sa anak na nasa sinapupunan ng kanyang ina"
Sunshine,5086,4,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Ngunit, ang hindi ko inasahan ay ang huling parte ng pelikula"
Sunshine,5086,5,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Hindi ko pinanood ang pelikulang ito ngunit nagbase ako sa buod nito upang malaman kung ano ang naganap [1]
Sunshine,5086,6,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Si Sunshine (Maris Racal) ay naghahanda na sumali sa “gymnastics team” para sa Olympics ngunit nalaman niya na buntis pala siya
Sunshine,5086,7,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Dahil dito, pumunta siya sa Quiapo upang bumili ng pampalaglag"
Sunshine,5086,8,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Matapos ng eksenang ito ay makikita na sinusundan siya ng isang batang babae
Sunshine,5086,9,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Iyon pala, ang babaeng ito, na nasa larawan sa post na ito, ay isang “imaginary friend” ni Sunshine"
Sunshine,5086,10,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Hindi ko na babanggitin ang gitna ng buod ng kwento ngunit sa huling parte ng pelikula, makikita na si Sunshine ay naghahanda para sa Olympics"
Sunshine,5086,11,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Nagpakita muli ang “imaginary friend” na batang babae kay Sunshine
Sunshine,5086,12,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Tinanong ni Sunshine kung nauunawaan ba ng batang babae ang desisyon niya
Sunshine,5086,13,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Matapos nito, pinakita ng batang babae na tinatanggap niya at niyakap niya na may luha sa mata si Sunshine"
Sunshine,5086,14,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Ang “plot twist” dito ay ang “imaginary friend” na ito ay ang anak ni Sunshine na namatay dahil sa aborsyon
Sunshine,5086,15,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Sa imahinasyon ni Sunshine, tinanggap ng kanyang anak ang desisyon ni Sunshine na patayin siya sa sinapupunan"
Sunshine,5086,16,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Tila ba tinuturo ng pelikulang ito, hindi lang na dapat gawing ligal ang pagpili ng tao na patayin ang anak sa sinapupunan ng ina, kundi gugustuhin ng isang bata na mamatay na lamang sa aborsyon kaysa ang mabuhay dahil sa benepisyo na matatanggap ng nanay kung pinatay na lang ang kanyang anak"
Sunshine,5086,17,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Nakakalungkot dahil sobrang sama ng moralidad na ipinapalaganap ng pelikulang ito
Sunshine,5086,18,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Dahil dito, nais ko lang ipakita kung ano ang sinabi ng mga taong nakaligtas sa tangkang aborsyon"
Sunshine,5086,19,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Hindi sa lahat ng pagkakataon ay namamatay ang mga anak na pinapalaglag
Sunshine,5086,20,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Dahil dito, mahalaga na makita ang kanilang perspektibo sa usapin ng aborsyon matapos silang makaligtas dito"
Sunshine,5086,21,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Sabi ni Linda Swayn na nakaligtas sa aborsyon ngunit nagkaroon ng problema sa kanyang bungo dahil sa bawal na gamot na ginamit sa pampalaglag,""The greatest gift I have received is life"
Sunshine,5086,22,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,God has given me the greatest gift of life [2]
Sunshine,5086,23,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"""Ito naman ang mababasa sa buhay ni Charlie Rousseau, isang tagapagsalita sa radyo sa Canada, na nakaligtas ng aborsyon na nagdulot upang mabuhay siyang putol ang braso at dalawang binti,“She wants to continue with her dream to work and live remotely, and see the world [3]"
Sunshine,5086,24,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"""Makikita naman natin na lagi nanaginip ng masama si Kimberly na maaaring parte ng kanyang masamang alaala sa tangkang pagpatay sa kanya,“For as long as I can remember, I would have a recurring nightmare"
Sunshine,5086,25,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"I could feel it coming, as if someone was coming to kill me"
Sunshine,5086,26,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Somehow I knew it was going to kill me
Sunshine,5086,27,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,It was terrifying
Sunshine,5086,28,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"When I was 15 years old, I woke from the nightmare screaming and crying [4]"
Sunshine,5086,29,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"""Ngayon, huwag muna natin isipin ang aborsyon kundi ang bagong silang na sanggol"
Sunshine,5086,30,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Tama ba na patayin sila para hindi maapektuhan ang pangarap ng kanyang nanay
Sunshine,5086,31,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Sa tingin ba natin, sasabihin ng sanggol na tama ang desisyon ng kanyang ina na patayin siya"
Sunshine,5086,32,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Malamang ay hindi
Sunshine,5086,33,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,"Ito rin ang ating rason sa pagtanggol sa buhay ng lahat, lalo na ng mga bata na walang kakayahan ipagtanggol ang kanilang sarili"
Sunshine,5086,34,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Galing mismo sa boses ng mga nakaligtas ng aborsyon na alam nila kung gaano ito kasama at gaano kaganda ang buhay
Sunshine,5086,35,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Walang bata ang gugustuhin na sila ay patayin
Sunshine,5086,36,harrystylesock,,,ltbx,Itigil na sana nila ang kasinungalingang ipinapalaganap sa pelikulang ito
Sunshine,5087,1,rysreviews1,,200.0,ltbx,"Bring back more filipino movies like this, gets ko sunshineSunshine really hits the mark in portraying toxic filipino culture (since we’re a largely catholic country, abortion is looked as “sinful” and “immoral”) and Filipino women struggles"

Sunshine,5133,4,julyuhh,,200.0,ltbx,"what stayed with me wasn’t the plot itself, but the feeling of watching a girl stand at the edge of her dreams while life keeps pulling her in directions she never asked for"
Sunshine,5133,5,julyuhh,,200.0,ltbx,"there is a particular kind of loneliness here that Filipinas know too well: the pressure to be strong, the fear of being judged, the lack of safe spaces to fall apart"
Sunshine,5133,6,julyuhh,,200.0,ltbx,"The film captures that ache, the way society can be quick to moralize but slow to understand"
Sunshine,5133,7,julyuhh,,200.0,ltbx,"For me, it felt like looking at a reflection of a system we’ve all quietly learned to navigate: the whispers, the shame, the institutions that pretend to help but rarely do"
Sunshine,5133,8,julyuhh,,200.0,ltbx,"Yet in those heavy moments, you still see a girl trying to choose herself, even when the world insists she shouldn’t"
Sunshine,5133,9,julyuhh,,200.0,ltbx,"it’s messy, raw, and painfully familiar… and that’s why it felt less like watching a film and more like remembering something you wish you could forget"
Sunshine,5134,1,kanghaneullover,,200.0,ltbx,"Tangina mo maris, ang galing mo"
Sunshine,5135,1,bugbearbandit,,,ltbx,gets ko naman
Sunshine,5135,2,bugbearbandit,,,ltbx,ang jarring pala panoorin kapag kabisado mo yung bawat ruta ng siyudad no
Sunshine,5135,3,bugbearbandit,,,ltbx,anyway bwhahahahthis is still a nice film and an important one too lalo na sa lagay ng panahon ngayon
Sunshine,5135,4,bugbearbandit,,,ltbx,"nevertheless, the film could've used another 30 minutes just to flesh out some ideas, characters, and be more morally puncturing"
Sunshine,5135,5,bugbearbandit,,,ltbx,"pero ayun, ika nga ng karamihan, it is still a bold move as it raises discussion"
Sunshine,5135,6,bugbearbandit,,,ltbx,"and i hope, with this na narelease na sa masa, hindi matapos ang diskurso na yon"
Sunshine,5135,7,bugbearbandit,,,ltbx,at hindi na rin sana umikot ang diskurso na kesyo ito sana ang pambato sa isang prestigious film fest
Sunshine,5135,8,bugbearbandit,,,ltbx,nandito naman na sa pelikula yung essence at hindi na sana hanapin pa sa ibang bansa
Sunshine,5135,9,bugbearbandit,,,ltbx,mas kailangan si Sunshine ng masa

Sunshine,5137,1,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,just had to rewatch once more
Sunshine,5137,2,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,"ito, seryoso na at skl ko lang din this anecdote of mine"
Sunshine,5137,3,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,i remember being a transferee in sixth grade when i was suddenly forced into an intra-school debate tournament
Sunshine,5137,4,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,one of the motions i had was about the legalization of abortion and i was placed in the opposing team
Sunshine,5137,5,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,"i vividly remember kung paano ako naging mulat sa topic na ‘to and i thought to myself, “oo nga, ‘no"
Sunshine,5137,6,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,bakit nga ba bawal
Sunshine,5137,7,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,"” i honestly had a hard time countering the government side’s points, so i just ended up focusing on my own arguments (without saying any rebuttals) instead — buti leader of the opp"
Sunshine,5137,8,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,"lang ako no’n, lol"
Sunshine,5137,9,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,"our debate teacher, or the madam chair, was very strict about not using the church as a basis when making an argument"
Sunshine,5137,10,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,"but all i could think of then was the bible, i couldn’t think of any other countering argument na pwede kong maibato"
Sunshine,5137,11,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,"and so, if a small-scale school debate tournament prohibits using the church as an argument, why can’t we demand the same from our government"
Sunshine,5137,12,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,bakit patuloy na iginigiit ang impluwensya ng simbahan sa batas if we supposedly live in a secular state
Sunshine,5137,13,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,sunshine and all filipino (women) do not deserve this bullshit
Sunshine,5137,14,straubries,,200.0,ltbx,free and accessible (reproductive) healthcare for filipinos

Sunshine,5168,1,asdfghghjjkl,,200.0,ltbx,putangina … putangina lang talaga …
Sunshine,5169,1,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine offers a quiet yet affecting exploration of teenage pregnancy and abortion—two issues deeply intertwined with the social and economic realities of our country
Sunshine,5169,2,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,"What makes the film striking is its simplicity: it doesn’t rely on heavy dramatics, but instead allows its heartfelt moments and grounded storytelling to speak for themselves"
Sunshine,5169,3,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,I particularly appreciated how the film subtly incorporated supernatural elements
Sunshine,5169,4,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,"Rather than distracting from the story, these touches added depth and symbolism, making the film feel both intimate and introspective"
Sunshine,5169,5,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,It’s a creative choice that gives Sunshine a unique emotional texture
Sunshine,5169,6,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,"As someone who grew up Catholic, I’ve never taken a firm stance on abortion; I’ve mostly remained indifferent or unsure"
Sunshine,5169,7,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,But this film pushed me to reflect on the bigger picture
Sunshine,5169,8,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,"It gently raises a painful yet necessary question: Why bring a child into a country that struggles to provide a dignified, nurturing environment for its people"
Sunshine,5169,9,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,"Without forcing a specific viewpoint, Sunshine invites viewers to confront the harsh realities that many young Filipinos face—stories that are often ignored or oversimplified"
Sunshine,5169,10,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,"Overall, Sunshine succeeds not just as a piece of cinema, but as a conversation starter"
Sunshine,5169,11,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,"It lingers with you, urging you to think about compassion, choice, and the societal conditions that shape both"
Sunshine,5169,12,theironcolonel,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s a simple film, but one with a resonance that’s hard to forget"

Sunshine,5182,6,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,“Hindi pa ako ready maging nanay” is already a valid reason for abortion
Sunshine,5182,7,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s her choice, not a moral issue for everyone to judge"
Sunshine,5182,8,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,"Nakakalungkot noong ipinakita sa movie na ito kung gaano kalala ang situation sa public hospitals—kulang sa resources, walang safe at stigma-free options, mayroon pa ngang nanganganak na lang sa sahig dahil sa kakulangan sa mga tao at kagamitan"
Sunshine,5182,9,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,"Kaya hindi nakapagtataka na for many women, the “safest” choice ends up being underground options, kahit sobrang risky"
Sunshine,5182,10,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,"Mas ironic pa, kasi nasa paligid lang ng simbahan ang mga nagbebenta ng pamparegla, hilot, at kung anu-ano, tapos ang narrative ng church: “kung natukso ka, talo ka"
Sunshine,5182,11,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,” Kaya understandable that the “tukso” becomes sometimes the only lifeline for someone desperate
Sunshine,5182,12,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,Women bear the brunt of the hypocrisy
Sunshine,5182,13,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,That’s literally the only way a woman could access it
Sunshine,5182,14,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi ko alam kung bakit kapag babae ka, ang daming bawal sa’yo"
Sunshine,5182,15,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,Pero hindi ka naman bibigyan ng reliable options
Sunshine,5182,16,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,"Napaka eye-opening nito sa atin, lalo na’t ipinakita sa atin na wala tayong karapatan husgahan ang batang ina kasi hindi natin alam ang pinagdadaanan nila"
Sunshine,5182,17,soieii,,200.0,ltbx,"Rape victim man o hindi, a woman should always have the right to decide for herself—her body is never up for debate"
Sunshine,5183,1,lunxsr,,180.0,ltbx,"I love this movie, it's not only about sunshine being pregnant at a young age but the sad reality here in the Philippines why some women would go through illegal abortions and yet there's judgment and shame"
Sunshine,5183,2,lunxsr,,180.0,ltbx,"I hope we women really have choices for our own body and health, not the law"

Sunshine,5189,3,ancezie,,160.0,ltbx,ang paniniwala nila
Sunshine,5189,4,ancezie,,160.0,ltbx,ngunit bakit hindi natin tignan sa ibang perspective
Sunshine,5189,5,ancezie,,160.0,ltbx,hindi ba’t mas magandang makita na aware ang isang tao na hindi nya kayang bumuhay ng anak at hindi sya karapat-dapat maging isang magulang lalo kung hindi naman sya stable at alam nyang maghihirap sakanya ang bata
Sunshine,5189,6,ancezie,,160.0,ltbx,bakit pinipigilan at sinasabing illegal ang abortion kung sa pamamagitan nito ay naiiwasan na bumuhay ng isang musmos para lang magdusa sa araw-araw kahit hindi nya naman ginustong mabuhay kasama ang nanay nyang hindi kayang ibigay sakanya ang lahat
Sunshine,5189,7,ancezie,,160.0,ltbx,it is a human right to access a medical care where abortion is legal
Sunshine,5189,8,ancezie,,160.0,ltbx,not everyone have the capability to bring a life in this world

Sunshine,5194,4,julyuhna,,160.0,ltbx,"abortion in the Philippines is not only illegal, but also so deeply stigmatized that many are forced to carry this burden alone, sometimes risking their own lives through unsafe procedures"
Sunshine,5194,5,julyuhna,,160.0,ltbx,the film portrays this reality with such quiet honesty that it sticks with you
Sunshine,5194,6,julyuhna,,160.0,ltbx,"the symbolism throughout was also so striking, like the “Gift of God” sign in the jeepney Sunshine rode, or her so-called imaginary friend who could represent her unborn child or her inner child"
Sunshine,5194,7,julyuhna,,160.0,ltbx,"it was honestly so satisfying watching her stand up for herself against miggy and his father, who’s a pastor"

Sunshine,5194,13,julyuhna,,160.0,ltbx,"her imaginary friend disappearing can be interpreted that she did push through with the abortion (which parallels the 13 y/o kid and ariana), or as her finally finding peace with whatever choice she made"
Sunshine,5194,14,julyuhna,,160.0,ltbx,"hopefully, this film gives conservatives some perspective on the immense weight placed on women in these situations, and they’ll finally be able to say, “Gets ko na"

Sunshine,5238,5,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"you don't need tearful monologues, or dramatic breakdowns (not that there's anything wrong with them) to understand the full weight of sunshine's situation"
Sunshine,5238,6,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,the film uses restraint as its sharpest tool
Sunshine,5238,7,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"the dim, muted visuals; the overwhelming noise of her environment; the way the camera locks her in the centre of the frame"
Sunshine,5238,8,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"always boxed in, always between lines"
Sunshine,5238,9,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"all emphasise how trapped she is by the social and religious stigma, and by a society that refuses to recognise abortion as a woman's right"
Sunshine,5238,10,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,the blurred backgrounds aren't just aesthetic; they reinforce her disconnection from the world around her
Sunshine,5238,11,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"she doesn't have the luxury to care about anything beyond her immediate reality: herself, her dreams, and the looming consequences of every decision she faces"
Sunshine,5238,12,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"and that is the tragedy, sunshine is a young woman with ambition, yet she navigates a world that is unforgiving"
Sunshine,5238,13,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"she is asked to seek god's forgiveness for attempting to abort the baby, yet if god is understanding, wouldn't he understand that she is not ready, and that she acted out of necessity"
Sunshine,5238,14,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"with abortion vilified and access almost impossible, the film illustrates how society corners, isolates, and silences young mothers"
Sunshine,5238,15,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"not with loud condemnation, but with quiet, crushing inevitability"
Sunshine,5238,16,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"it is a devastating portrait of how systemic and cultural forces conspire to limit women's autonomy, and a reminder of the human cost of denying choice"
Sunshine,5238,17,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"one of the most striking elements of the film, for me, is its gendered power dynamic"
Sunshine,5238,18,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"every character, without exception, imposes his own beliefs onto sunshine"
Sunshine,5238,19,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"urging her to keep the baby, citing legality, morality, or personal conviction"
Sunshine,5238,20,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"their ""advice"" is never about her well-being, it's about controlling her choices"
Sunshine,5238,21,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"the absence of a single moment where a man asks what she wants is not accidental, it reflects a broader social structure where women's autonomy is secondary to male authority"
Sunshine,5238,22,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"the women in the film, however, present a more nuanced spectrum"
Sunshine,5238,23,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"some internalise patriarchal norms and unintentionally reinforce them, but many others recognise sunshine's struggle immediately"
Sunshine,5238,24,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"they empathise not because they have the answers, but because they understand the emotional, economic, and social burden that falls disproportionately on women"
Sunshine,5238,25,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,their solidarity is quiet but powerful
Sunshine,5238,26,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"a direct contrast to the coercive, dismissive tone of the male characters"
Sunshine,5238,27,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"the film ultimately critiques how systems built and upheld by men deny women agency, especially around reproductive choices"
Sunshine,5238,28,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"in a society where institutional and cultural norms consistently silence women, the film shows that women often became each other's only source of validation, understanding, and empowerment"
Sunshine,5238,29,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,no scene is waster
Sunshine,5238,30,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,nothing is filler
Sunshine,5238,31,baobeisaur,,200.0,ltbx,"every character is intentionally placed, each one shaping or limiting sunshine's decisions in ways that feel painfully real"
Sunshine,5239,1,seosher,,200.0,ltbx,this is definitely one of the best films i’ve seen this year
Sunshine,5239,2,seosher,,200.0,ltbx,"It truly left a lasting impression on me, i’m still processing what i just watched"
Sunshine,5239,3,seosher,,200.0,ltbx,Maris did an incredible job
Sunshine,5240,1,loucomer,,160.0,ltbx,Applause for the movie not letting the main character birth a child just to suit the palate of conservative filipinos
Sunshine,5241,2,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,This is the type of films the Philippines should make more
Sunshine,5241,3,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,"Finally a movie with substance, relevance, and courage to tell a story despite cultural taboo"
Sunshine,5241,4,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,This is required and essential
Sunshine,5241,5,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,I thought an hour and a half wouldn’t be enough to dig deeper into the journey of Sunshine but it was actually just enough to see all of it
Sunshine,5241,6,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,"Although, there were unnecessary choices made in the film that I disliked and that I wish were done differently and I wish saw more of Sunshine’s character in the lowest of lows or maybe I’m just greedy"
Sunshine,5241,7,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,"However,Maris Racal is a revelation"
Sunshine,5241,8,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,"And for the Philippines to have such a film like this one that speaks to so many women, even men, in the country"
Sunshine,5241,9,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,I hope this is a step forward for the country to move progressively and this be a force for politicians to pass that bill
Sunshine,5241,10,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,"Because after all, films are made to speak out, protest, and to implement change"
Sunshine,5241,11,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,"Lastly, Sunshine is such a huge step towards good filmmaking in the Philippines"
Sunshine,5241,12,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,We need more films that speak of truth and of society
Sunshine,5241,13,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,Stories that need to be heard and not rely too much on fake romance
Sunshine,5241,14,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,"Though Sunshine isn’t perfect as a film itself, the courage and the amount of truth revealed in an hour and a half are enough to have the voices of so many women be heard"
Sunshine,5241,15,alberttseno,,140.0,ltbx,TO THE PHILIPPINES: YES TO ABORTION

Sunshine,5247,5,angelauv,,200.0,ltbx,"It takes courage and responsibility to be a mother, and that choice should never be taken lightly"
Sunshine,5247,6,angelauv,,200.0,ltbx,"So when people say it’s a sin, I ask myself: how can it be wrong if it’s your own body, your own life, that bears it"

Sunshine,5281,8,nitrilepowder,,200.0,ltbx,"Sobrang raw and realistic from the familiar “jeje” song playing sa jeep pagsakay ni Sunshine, to the 13 yr old na nakaranas ng pang aabuso mula sa kanyang tito (talamak ang kaso ng incest sa pinas, thank u direk for highlighting that)"

Sunshine,5281,12,nitrilepowder,,200.0,ltbx,It had the guts to shine a spotlight on a longstanding issue sa bansa na lagi na lang inooverlook
Sunshine,5281,13,nitrilepowder,,200.0,ltbx,It dare call out and address what Filipinos considered as taboo
Sunshine,5281,14,nitrilepowder,,200.0,ltbx,"And as someone who had a debate with her mom over dinner about abortion, this film is so special to me"

Sunshine,5298,5,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"tuwing kailan mo masasabing malaya ka sa sarili mong bansa; kung nakakulong ka pa rin sa gate ng simbahan, sa ingay ng dyip at tren sa kalsada, sa konsensya mo, sa sarili mo"
Sunshine,5298,6,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"paano mo aasahang gumalaw ang isang babaeng hindi lang isa o dalawang tao ang ""masasagasaan"" sa pagtindig sa kaniyang nga karapatan bilang babae—kundi isang buong relehiyon at batas ang haharapin mo na dapat sana ay nangunguna sa pagbibigay sekuridad at protekta sayo"
Sunshine,5298,7,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"malinaw sa pelikulang ito ang mga problemang nagpahirap kay sunshine, pero higit na mas malinaw ang mga dahilan kung bakit mas lalo itong nahirapan"
Sunshine,5298,8,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,hindi sana kinakailangang mag-alala ni sunshine sa mga posibilidad na maaaring may maging sagabal sa natatangi nitong pangarap
Sunshine,5298,9,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"dito ipinakita na kahit nakatira si sunshine sa lugar kung saan madilim, madumi, maingay, at dikit-dikit ang mga marurupok na bahay ay mayroon pa rin itong isang ate—isang babae, na lagi't lagi niyang ipapaalala na may kakampi pa rin siya sa hinagpis ng buhay"
Sunshine,5298,10,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"dito ipinakita kung paanong sa kabila ng mga taong maaari mong lapitan sa gitna ng problema ay mapipilitan ka na lamang maglakad nang mabilis at balisa sa quiapo sa takot na may makakita sayo, o di kaya'y mag check in sa isang motel sa pag-asang sa madilim na kwarto ring iyon matatapos lahat ng problema mo"
Sunshine,5298,11,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"para sa akin, sapat na ang mga eksena sa simbahan at mga rebulto sa harap ng mga pampareglang itinitinda patago upang malinaw na maihatid ang mensaheng nais maparating ng pelikula; na isang malaking sagabal ang mga aspetong isa tayong bansa na karamihan ay mga katoliko, at lahat ng pilipino'y mga hipokritong deboto, at mas may pakielam pa ang mga ito sa mga desisyon ng mga babae para sa kaniyang sarili, kaysa sa kani-kanilang mga buhay"
Sunshine,5298,12,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,ang pahayag na hindi handa si sunshine maging isang ina ang siyang dapat na tumapos sa lahat ng mga opinyong wala namang maitutulong sa kaniya
Sunshine,5298,13,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,ganoon lang sana kasimple ang lahat
Sunshine,5298,14,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"pero higit sa mga eksenang nakaangkla sa ating pagiging katoliko ay ang mga doktor, mga propesyonal na edukado, sa pelikula kung saan mas narinig ko pa silang nanghusga kay sunshine kaysa sa sarili nitong konsensya"
Sunshine,5298,15,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"paano ka nga naman hihiling na sana'y gawin nang legal ang aborsyon sa bansa, kung yung mismong mga pribilehiyo at edukado na mismo ang nagbibigay rason sayo upang mas lalong matakot at panghinaan ng loob"
Sunshine,5298,16,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"sa mundo na kagaya ng kay sunshine, sino nga ba ang maaari nitong kapitan"
Sunshine,5298,17,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,hindi ba't mapipilitan ka na lamang tahakin ang landas ng mga naging desisyon ni sunshine
Sunshine,5298,18,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,nakakagalit isipin na sa pagtagal ng panahon ay mas lalo lamang dumadami ang mga kaso ng mga babaeng gumagawa ng sariling diskarte para mailaglag ang kanilang mga dinadala; na higit pa sa nagbibigay kapahamakan sa kanila
Sunshine,5298,19,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,napakagaling ng eksena niya sa motel; naghihikahos sa pag-asa na mamamatay din yung reyalidad na nagdadalang-tao siya
Sunshine,5298,20,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,mistula ko ring personal na nararamdaman yung pisikal na sakit na nagpapadugo sa kaniya
Sunshine,5298,21,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,pero tumulo talaga ang mga luha ko nang napagtanto ko yung papel ng karakter dito ni rhed bustamante
Sunshine,5298,22,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi matatawaran yung dating ng kuwento niya, dahil nirerepresenta niya ang bawat batang babae na dumanas ng karahasan sa sarili nitong tahanan, mula sa sarili nitong kadugo"
Sunshine,5298,23,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"sa bawat katagang pagsambit ni coach na ""drown out the noise"
Sunshine,5298,24,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,""" ay ang reyalidad na hindi lahat ay katulad ni sunshine—sa bawat pitik ng mga kamay at lambot ng kaniyang katawan ay may kakayahan itong lunurin ang isip sa katahimikan"
Sunshine,5298,25,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi lahat ng dumanas sa teenage pregnancy ay may kakayahang isarado ang isip sa bawat panghuhusga at pagsabi ng mga tao na, mali iyan, kasalanan iyan, malay pa natin at balang araw ang laman na gusto mong ipalaglag ay ang magiging presidente ng pilipinas"
Sunshine,5298,26,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,"higit sa katotohanang dapat ay nasa lalake ang lahat ng sisi, malaking parte rin ang simbahan, gobyerno, at ang mga taong nakapaligid sayo, kung bakit hindi mo magawan ng desisyon ang sarili mong katawan at kinabukasan"
Sunshine,5298,27,muscatgrapes,,200.0,ltbx,pangarap ko rin ang lahat ng pangarap ng mga sunshine

Sunshine,5300,5,reyahnahlyn,,180.0,ltbx,"The topic shown, specifically, is more than cultural, it is systemic"
Sunshine,5300,6,reyahnahlyn,,180.0,ltbx,It is not just a medical issue or a mere moral dilemma in our belief systems considering that it significantly affects all Filipino women
Sunshine,5300,7,reyahnahlyn,,180.0,ltbx,"The more we shy away from these issues, the more we increase mortality rates, creating dysfunctional families and dysfunctional communities as a whole, it also contributes to the poverty problem that has prevailed since forever"
Sunshine,5300,8,reyahnahlyn,,180.0,ltbx,"Safe abortion is a necessity, especially in this godforsaken country"

Sunshine,5310,3,nfeyu,,200.0,ltbx,"although the flow of the story was linear, the issues of being “pro-choice” were laid down simply but painfully so"
Sunshine,5310,4,nfeyu,,200.0,ltbx,"glad that she is surrounded by people, although only a few, who supported and understood her choice — as it is not the case to everyone"
Sunshine,5310,5,nfeyu,,200.0,ltbx,"nevertheless, i hope this movie would get more recognition and perhaps would serve as a medium to finally open conversations about abortion and why is it necessary rather than immoral"

Sunshine,5320,5,lyvady,,200.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t sugarcoat the pain physical, emotional, and mental—that comes with being trapped in a system that refuses to acknowledge their autonomy"

Sunshine,5339,24,amp_mf,,200.0,ltbx,It also shows how abysmal the healthcare system is in the Philippines

Sunshine,5340,1,sweetspaghett,,140.0,ltbx,i think that it's very realistic and the abortion issue in the Philippines is portrayed really well

Sunshine,5344,2,vmannn,,200.0,ltbx,We should really leave the decision to women when it comes to their body
Sunshine,5344,3,vmannn,,200.0,ltbx,Sobrang hirap pala talagang maging babae
Sunshine,5344,4,vmannn,,200.0,ltbx,Lalo na sa Pilipinas kung saan little to none ang choice
Sunshine,5345,1,b0caz,,200.0,ltbx,"Bilang isang babae sa pilipinas, isang kasabihan lagi ang nakatatak saakin — mahirap maging babae, at mas lalong mahirap maging babae sa pilipinas"
Sunshine,5345,2,b0caz,,200.0,ltbx,"growing up in this economy, this so called 'religious country'"
Sunshine,5345,3,b0caz,,200.0,ltbx,"fuck that shit, fuck men, fuck this economy where women having a choice is considered illegal"

Sunshine,5345,6,b0caz,,200.0,ltbx,Putang-puta talaga ako na karamihan pa ng hindi sumasangayon sa abortion (kagaya ng tatay ni miggy) ay mga lalaki na akala mo'y may mga matres

Sunshine,5350,1,gelo27,,140.0,ltbx,"Abortion should be legal, menggay"
Sunshine,5350,2,gelo27,,140.0,ltbx,Pinaka magandang example diyan is si menggay (red characters) na maraming bata ang natatake advantage
Sunshine,5350,3,gelo27,,140.0,ltbx,"I’m religious, pero being tone-deaf to the situation is something else"
Sunshine,5351,1,thrsncl,,200.0,ltbx,"kahit hindi nila naiintindihan, gets ko"
Sunshine,5352,1,astrocampo,,160.0,ltbx,One thing I like about Sunshine is its brazen risk to center the story on a 19-year old who's made consequentially irresponsible choices
Sunshine,5352,2,astrocampo,,160.0,ltbx,"It's a gambit that can easily be -- and, judging by discussions surrounding this movie, has already been -- misconstrued as a lesson on the importance of hammering down our society's puritanical views on sex and reproductive health to set teenage girls straight"
Sunshine,5352,3,astrocampo,,160.0,ltbx,"That, somehow, Sunshine is a lesson in, as the elders say, ""opening your legs for just about anybody""; that she did not listen to the adage is an absolute failing on her part, and its consequences fall rightfully on her shoulders"
Sunshine,5352,4,astrocampo,,160.0,ltbx,"But here's the tricky bit: Sunshine could very well have been about a mother who could no longer give birth to another, and it would have still been met with the same logic-defying resistance that still places the blame squarely on the woman"
Sunshine,5352,5,astrocampo,,160.0,ltbx,"Minor gripes include a finicky plot device that, at times, feels jarring and slightly questionable in terms of messaging"
Sunshine,5352,6,astrocampo,,160.0,ltbx,But it all feels egregious to say because the urgency of its existence really dwarfs over whatever minor flaws it may have
Sunshine,5352,7,astrocampo,,160.0,ltbx,"It also helps that Sunshine carried is so deftly by Maris Racal's and Jennica Garcia's career-defining performances, and a score by Rico Blanco that knows how to restrain and reintroduce itself in all the right moments"
Sunshine,5352,8,astrocampo,,160.0,ltbx,"Sunshine cracks open a conversation on an obstinately immovable subject, and unflinchingly exposes the grim reality on how our women and girls move about our society, bearing the problems that we could easily find solutions to but which our religious guilt and intolerance constantly shame us into denying"

Sunshine,5354,1,jannkaeremon,,200.0,ltbx,Direk Tonet did it again
Sunshine,5354,2,jannkaeremon,,200.0,ltbx,Sobrang painful and disturbing ng movie na ito (at least for me) but it only shows how exactly why a woman should never shrink herself to what society wants women to endure
Sunshine,5354,3,jannkaeremon,,200.0,ltbx,"Hindi palaging babae ang magpaparaya at mag aadjust; her body, her choice"
Sunshine,5355,1,rk1ve,,200.0,ltbx,“Naiintindihan mo ba ‘ko

Sunshine,5355,6,rk1ve,,200.0,ltbx,thank you papa God for women; for their lives and their bodies that carry the world
Sunshine,5355,7,rk1ve,,200.0,ltbx,"despite women being the strongest people put into this place we live in, they do not need to put up with everything—it’s okay to say “no"
Sunshine,5355,8,rk1ve,,200.0,ltbx,” such a good film :)
Sunshine,5356,1,beetejuicr,,160.0,ltbx,This is an additional reason of why i hate men
Sunshine,5357,1,lkcmx,,160.0,ltbx,"gets na gets na yung hype for Sunshine, naiyak akothis film really opened up a lot of heavy conversations regarding controversial topics that, up to this day, are still very hard to be tackled in our country where most minds are still enveloped by conservative ideologies that have been long influenced by religious policies"
Sunshine,5357,2,lkcmx,,160.0,ltbx,the message is straightforward and clear
Sunshine,5357,3,lkcmx,,160.0,ltbx,"it showed us the reality of women alike that had to endure the consequences of the patriarchal oppression and the dominance of Catholicism in the country, which is something that the rightists would undoubtedly refuse to accept because they'd still believe their presumed ""norms"" are what they think what's ""best"" for everyone and in the country — which is so out of touch from reality and it's very frustrating"
Sunshine,5357,4,lkcmx,,160.0,ltbx,"however, i just had a bit of a problem with the film's inclusion of imaginary children; which i think somehow holds it back from letting the main message have its full weight"
Sunshine,5357,5,lkcmx,,160.0,ltbx,"i get that they were used as some kind of a metaphor or a device for the plot, but something with it troubles me for reasons i can't quite best explain yet"
Sunshine,5357,6,lkcmx,,160.0,ltbx,"but all in all, i really commend the bold attempts they did for this film"
Sunshine,5357,7,lkcmx,,160.0,ltbx,still a solid gem for Philippine contemporary cinema that's deserving to be watched by so many
Sunshine,5358,1,cosmcgryl,,200.0,ltbx,TANGINA I-LEGALIZE ABORTION SA PILIPINASpati sana tigilan na yang pagkapit sa religion lalo na kung sapalaran ng bata in the future ang mananagot
Sunshine,5359,1,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,This is such a wake-up call about how dangerous abortion can be when it’s not done safely
Sunshine,5359,2,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,"That’s why we really need to legalize abortion, so women can have the option and so it can be done medically and safely"
Sunshine,5359,3,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,"It’s funny how all the men in the movie reflect real life, where they don’t have a fucking ounce of understanding about women’s reproductive health"
Sunshine,5359,4,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,"This also reflects how men often dictate the legalization of abortion when they shouldn’t, because they don’t even have a fucking UTERUS"
Sunshine,5359,5,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,"Also, fuck that old doctor"
Sunshine,5359,6,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,Holier-than-thou people are the most hypocritical pieces of shit
Sunshine,5359,7,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,"Instead of empathizing with Sunshine, she had the audacity to take the religious route"
Sunshine,5359,8,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,The storyline of the thirteen-year-old also shows that people should not have a child if they cannot fucking provide and protect
Sunshine,5359,9,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,It reflects our current society especially the poor children whose parents are pieces of shit
Sunshine,5359,10,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,And that’s exactly why abortion should be legalized so women can have the option if they are not ready
Sunshine,5359,11,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,Just look at her life; she was born to a mother who doesn’t care and a rapist uncle who should be imprison
Sunshine,5359,12,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,Why the fuck is the Philippines so backward
Sunshine,5359,13,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,Fuck all the corrupt politicians
Sunshine,5359,14,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,"Also, what the fuck was that male doctor doing denying care to a child whose life was at stake because of the abortion"
Sunshine,5359,15,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t think that happens in real life"
Sunshine,5359,16,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,"Doctors should save a patient regardless of whether it was due to an abortion, especially when the patient is critical"
Sunshine,5359,17,labbly,,180.0,ltbx,"As a healthcare worker, I have never witnessed a doctor deny care to a critical patient"

Sunshine,5364,1,ssamutsari,,180.0,ltbx,"sadly, the country is still far from being progressive, especially with topics like abortion, since the stances of some are rooted in religion"
Sunshine,5364,2,ssamutsari,,180.0,ltbx,one thing i didn't understand is the character progression of the kid
Sunshine,5364,3,ssamutsari,,180.0,ltbx,"at the beginning of the film, she is clearly against abortion"
Sunshine,5364,4,ssamutsari,,180.0,ltbx,"however, we saw that her opinions changed (because she saw that sunshine doesn't want to become a mom) when ariana was introduced, where she mentioned that she and sunshine both share the same dream,…"
Sunshine,5365,1,tonidionisio,,160.0,ltbx,My favorite scene was when sunshine hit fucking bobot’s head with a beer bottle like YES DO IT AGAINI kid u not I kept screaming “more
Sunshine,5365,2,tonidionisio,,160.0,ltbx,"” when that scene played outOn a real note tho, loved the fact that this film showed the reality of unwanted pregnancies, especially in the philippines"
Sunshine,5365,3,tonidionisio,,160.0,ltbx,Deducted one star bc it could’ve been longer
Sunshine,5365,4,tonidionisio,,160.0,ltbx,"Don’t get me wrong, as someone with a short attention span, 1 hr and 30 mins is such a perfect duration, but I feel like with this kind of storyline, the issue tackled is so important that it deserves to be longer than that"
Sunshine,5366,1,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,the premise alone is enough for me to give it a full rating
Sunshine,5366,2,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"to come up with a movie about one of the most taboo topics in this predominantly catholic country—given how conservative almost everyone is about it, how it’s actively vilified and condemned, how those who seek it are treated as no better than murderers, and how women are left to fend for themselves and look for alternative ways, whether through an underground clinic, safe or unsafe, or a seller’s comforting words when you don’t even know if the medicine will work—is a huge feat"
Sunshine,5366,3,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"it has been long overdue, but this is already a big step for everyone"
Sunshine,5366,4,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"abortion is, and will always be, healthcare"
Sunshine,5366,5,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"film-wise though, i absolutely LOVE the color grading"
Sunshine,5366,6,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,i usually hate SOME filipino movies (omg i’m sorryyyy) because the coloring pisses me off (like ik we can do better)
Sunshine,5366,7,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"idk how to pinpoint what gives me the ick but,,, yeah"
Sunshine,5366,8,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,sunshine’s though was nice

Sunshine,5366,10,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"always shady, dirty, BUT well, that’s our country and i loved the actual showcase of it"
Sunshine,5366,11,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,there were some symbolism and stills of how ironic some scenes can be too
Sunshine,5366,12,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,nice touch :) from the pills next to the statues to the jeepney signs
Sunshine,5366,13,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"the plot is predictable for me (re: what those kids are), but not in a bad way"
Sunshine,5366,14,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"it just shows that it’s working, and i feel seen"
Sunshine,5366,15,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,a lot of women will feel seen
Sunshine,5366,16,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"not saying we went through the exact same thing, but generally, the gist of thinking your life is over, or will be if it does happen, because we don’t have a choice in the first place, and are expected to just live with it, is familiar"
Sunshine,5366,17,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"the amount of mental gymnastics people will spew about “the future of the children,” how they could be “the next inventor of a cure,” while never considering the mother, who has her own ambitions, who has to give birth, raise the child, and provide the system and support for their hypothesis to even happen… it’s all broken-record arguments"
Sunshine,5366,18,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"these are the usual lines they’ll say, and some of their reactions (doctors, friends, “partners”) really DO HAPPEN irl and it’s proof that the film is heavily based from real experiences, and well researched enough about the actual process people will go through (and went through) for this"
Sunshine,5366,19,lustcry,,200.0,ltbx,"here’s to shed light, to inform, and hopefully, to make people more open, thoughtful, and willing to give women the autonomy they deserve"

Sunshine,5368,3,hannakolin,,120.0,ltbx,"I saw the vision of what the story was to show, but it felt flat"
Sunshine,5368,4,hannakolin,,120.0,ltbx,The movie opened so many issues to tackle but it really failed to explain them
Sunshine,5368,5,hannakolin,,120.0,ltbx,The story itself lacked sex education too
Sunshine,5368,6,hannakolin,,120.0,ltbx,"What do you mean you want to tell the viewers you are pro-abortion, but here's the (imaginary) kid talking to Sunshine as if she's her conscience just to mess with her decision to abort"
Sunshine,5368,7,hannakolin,,120.0,ltbx,"It shows how conservative our country is, yes, but the eagerness to change the mindset of the viewers is nowhere to be found"
Sunshine,5368,8,hannakolin,,120.0,ltbx,"Also, the kids cursing throughout the entire movie is unnecessary lmao"
Sunshine,5368,9,hannakolin,,120.0,ltbx,"Overhyped, I guess"

Sunshine,5390,2,serialweirdo,,160.0,ltbx,"napakaraming katanungan at emosyon — lungkot, galit, poot, takot, at saya — ngunit batid ko na ito’y ilan lamang sa milyun-milyon na emosyon na pinagdaraanan siguro ng mga katulad nina sunshine at mary grace"
Sunshine,5390,3,serialweirdo,,160.0,ltbx,"nawa’y mamulat ang mga tao sa katotohanan ng isyung abortion, at matanto na hindi lamang ito usapang moral o pang-relihiyon, kundi usaping pang-kalusugan at karapatang pantao"
Sunshine,5390,4,serialweirdo,,160.0,ltbx,hindi dapat diktahan ng lipunan kung ano ang dapat gawin ng isang babae sa sarili niyang katawan
Sunshine,5390,5,serialweirdo,,160.0,ltbx,"kaya mahigpit na yakap para sa ating mga sunshine at mary grace, mga kababaihang punong puno ng sugat at pangarap  nawa’y magkaroon na ng sistemang tunay na magproprotekta sa inyo at magtataguyod ng inyong mga karapatan"

Sunshine,5394,2,roomonth,,200.0,ltbx,This movie showcase the real world scenarios that is not given a big of a deal
Sunshine,5394,3,roomonth,,200.0,ltbx,the bravery of sunshine to face the issue even if people says that what she's doing is wrong
Sunshine,5394,4,roomonth,,200.0,ltbx,And the cruelty of the environment that effects the mental state of the kids
Sunshine,5394,5,roomonth,,200.0,ltbx,that they are taken advantage in ways that they don't even have an idea what's happening
Sunshine,5394,6,roomonth,,200.0,ltbx,I can say that this is one of the movies that showcase socio-political issue well
Sunshine,5394,7,roomonth,,200.0,ltbx,"And the fact that this is produced in the phillipines , where teenage pregnancy is really a huge issue, is so excellent"

Sunshine,5401,5,kh4liq,,200.0,ltbx,"Writing this story and bringing it to life is already brave enough, but releasing it as a masterpiece like this"
Sunshine,5401,6,kh4liq,,200.0,ltbx,Even braver
Sunshine,5401,7,kh4liq,,200.0,ltbx,"This showcases the reality of many women who go through hardships, showing how desperation exists in the middle of chaos, in the middle of everything falling apart"

Sunshine,5403,1,kneenik,,160.0,ltbx,really liked how the movie captures the anxiety of being pregnant while completely not wanting to become a mother
Sunshine,5403,2,kneenik,,160.0,ltbx,sunshine felt like such a real person and id like to think this is bc of how real her circumstances + anxieties are
Sunshine,5403,3,kneenik,,160.0,ltbx,maris brought so much depth to the character bc of her line deliveries & facial expressions that were able to flesh out who sunshine was without there being a detailed back story for the character
Sunshine,5403,4,kneenik,,160.0,ltbx,"overall, the movie provides a very good commentary on how unwanted pregnancy is vilified, the lengths that women will go to for autonomy over our bodies"
Sunshine,5404,1,lululemonzz,,200.0,ltbx,putangina gets ko na

Sunshine,5407,2,vrtue,,160.0,ltbx,"ang bigat sa pakiramdam na hanggang ngayon, hindi pa rin malaya ang mga kababaihan na piliin ang gusto nilang gawin para sa sarili nilang katawan"
Sunshine,5407,3,vrtue,,160.0,ltbx,"natapos na yung palabas, pero nasa utak ko pa rin kung paano hindi binitawan ni sunshine yung pangarap niya"
Sunshine,5407,4,vrtue,,160.0,ltbx,"nakakalungkot na nangyayari ito sa totoong buhay, na walang choice ang iba kundi kumapit sa patalim dahil hindi pa accessible ang mga dapat at hindi pa rin nawawala ang pagiging konserbatibo ng mga tao"
Sunshine,5407,5,vrtue,,160.0,ltbx,“yung pangarap ko kung ano ang pangarap niya” was so good
Sunshine,5407,6,vrtue,,160.0,ltbx,"kita mo rin sa huli na mas buo na yung loob niya, na patuloy pa rin siyang nangarap hanggang sa dulo"

Sunshine,5413,2,maanm,,200.0,ltbx,"yung opm rap sa jeep, yung kabusyhan ng quiapo, yung juxtaposition na sa tabi ng simbahan mo pa makikita mga nagbebenta ng abortion pills, yung vibe ng recto (tangina heavy on this)accordingly, kuhang kuha din nito yung Pilipino — kung paano tayo nasshape ng religious ideals, kung paano pineperceive ng karamihan yung mga babaeng gustong magpa-abort, even kung ano yung tingin natin sa teenage pregnancykaya ang tapang ng movie na to for delving into sunshine's inner struggles - bilang isang teenage Filipina na working class, na nagkaroon ng unexpected pregnancy, na nakatira sa isang bansa na hindi accessible ang reproductive healthcare at sobrang religious lang ng mga tao (intersectionality af) oo, first choice niya talagang ipa-abort ang bata, pero makikita na hindi to naging madali for her - eto ang crux ng movie"
Sunshine,5413,3,maanm,,200.0,ltbx,pinakita nito na hindi madali ang daan sa abortion - sa kalooban ng babae at sa mga methods na available sa kanya (esp sa bansa natin)
Sunshine,5413,4,maanm,,200.0,ltbx,pinakita ng Sunshine kung gaano ka-ingrained sa kababaihan na makaramdam ng guilt kapag cinoconsider nilang magpa-abort
Sunshine,5413,5,maanm,,200.0,ltbx,"HINDI SIYA MADALI, lalo na if may iba pang circumstances na kailangan tignan"
Sunshine,5413,6,maanm,,200.0,ltbx,sana magets ng mga close-minded people yung point pag pinanood nila
Sunshine,5413,7,maanm,,200.0,ltbx,"kung iisipin, buhay ng isang babae in real life ang buhay ni sunshine sa pelikula"
Sunshine,5413,8,maanm,,200.0,ltbx,"pero kahit nakikita natin si sunshine sa ordinaryong Pilipina, napakahirap pa rin ng conversation surrounding abortion"
Sunshine,5413,9,maanm,,200.0,ltbx,kaya ang tapang talaga ng movie for inviting discussion on this topic
Sunshine,5413,10,maanm,,200.0,ltbx,hindi ko nagets at first pero i appreciate how the kid represented her unborn child
Sunshine,5413,11,maanm,,200.0,ltbx,"ang ganda nung ""yung pangarap ko, kung ano ang pangarap niya"" nakakaiyak"

Sunshine,5417,8,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,Pangarap ko ang pangarap niya
Sunshine,5417,9,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,5417,10,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,How ironic that what is deemed a sin is being sold right outside the walls of a church
Sunshine,5417,11,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,This film is showing whats it like to be a woman in a fucking religious hypocrite country
Sunshine,5417,12,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,Ang daling sabihin na kasalanan sa diyos ang magpalaglag
Sunshine,5417,13,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,Ang daling sabihin na ipagpatuloy ng isang babae ang pagbubuntis
Sunshine,5417,14,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,Pero napakahirap gampanan ang tungkulin bilang isang ina kung hindo mo ginusto maging nanay
Sunshine,5417,15,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,Should we turn a blind eye to those who where raped
Sunshine,5417,16,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,But do we just wait for someone to violate a womans body just so she could have a choice
Sunshine,5417,17,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,To those woman who doesn't have the resources to birth a child in this fucked up world
Sunshine,5417,18,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,In this economy
Sunshine,5417,19,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,Those without a partner or family to support them
Sunshine,5417,20,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,Should doctors turn a blind eye to this problem
Sunshine,5417,21,b3_aaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Making abortions illegal does not stop abortions, it just forces a lot of woman to get unsafe ones"
Sunshine,5418,1,ikang,,200.0,ltbx,"tangina ng gobyerno, ng health care natin sa pinas, mga religious fuckers, AT NG MGA LALAKI"
Sunshine,5418,2,ikang,,200.0,ltbx,PUTANGINA THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD
Sunshine,5420,1,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"if there is light, kahit konting-konti lang, we chase it—because sometimes that’s the only thing left for women to hold"
Sunshine,5420,2,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,sunshine (2025) is the kind of film na hindi ka pinapa-wow sa effects or spectacle
Sunshine,5420,3,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"instead, it sits beside you quietly, like a friend na alam lahat ng pagod mo kahit hindi mo sinabi"
Sunshine,5420,4,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"it’s woman-centered in the most unsettling, honest way—walang sugarcoating, walang mythologizing, just the raw truth of being a girl in a country that asks you to endure more than it ever protects"
Sunshine,5420,5,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,the film strips away the usual softness associated with its title
Sunshine,5420,6,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,sunshine isn’t light; she’s a girl trying to survive a world that keeps dimming her
Sunshine,5420,7,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"and when the story touches the issue of abortion not being legalized in the Philippines, it doesn’t sensationalize it—pinapakita lang niya ‘yung totoo: na in this country, women are expected to carry consequences alone"
Sunshine,5420,8,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"that reproductive rights become moral battles instead of health and safety; na the system treats our pain like an inconvenience, our choices like crimes"
Sunshine,5420,9,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"‘yung internal struggle ni Sunshine—‘yung fear, guilt, confusion, desperation—hindi dahil “mahina siya,” but because society makes women feel cornered by circumstances we never chose"
Sunshine,5420,10,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,and the film doesn’t villainize her for thinking about her future; it villainizes the world that forces her to justify wanting one
Sunshine,5420,11,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,and then there’s Miggy
Sunshine,5420,12,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,Miggy is… familiar
Sunshine,5420,13,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"not evil, not abusive, just painfully typical"
Sunshine,5420,14,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"he represents the kind of boyfriend most girls in the philippines know too well—the one who “cares,” but only until it requires accountability"
Sunshine,5420,15,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,the boy who says “I’m here for you” pero umiilag sa big conversations
Sunshine,5420,16,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,the boy who loves you but doesn’t understand the weight you carry because he’s never had to carry anything like it
Sunshine,5420,17,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"Miggy is the embodiment of how boys in this country are raised: may freedom without consequence, may opinion without knowledge, may presence without responsibility"
Sunshine,5420,18,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"his reactions, his avoidance, even his attempts to comfort—they feel real because they’re exactly what so many girls have lived through"
Sunshine,5420,19,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,boys who think support is just saying “kaya natin ’to” while leaving the actual pain to us
Sunshine,5420,20,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,sunshine 2025 becomes a commentary on how women are taught to be accountable for everything—including mistakes that weren’t only theirs—while men are taught to be forgiven for everything
Sunshine,5420,21,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,the movie doesn’t hate Miggy; it exposes him
Sunshine,5420,22,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"it shows the casualness of male privilege, the way it slips into daily life unnoticed but heavy—always heavy—on our side"
Sunshine,5420,23,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"and that’s what makes the film hit: it’s not loud, not preachy, not dramatic"
Sunshine,5420,24,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,it just shows the truth—and the truth is already loud enough
Sunshine,5420,25,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"sunshine isn’t a story about brightness; it’s a story about women trying to navigate a world that refuses to make space for their choices, their fears, their bodies, their futures"
Sunshine,5420,26,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"it’s a film that says:the pain wasn’t yours alone, but somehow, you were the only one expected to carry it"
Sunshine,5420,27,chocopaolover,,160.0,ltbx,"and long after the credits, you’re left with that hurt—the kind that reminds you why we keep fighting for a world where women don’t have to beg for the right to their own lives"
Sunshine,5421,1,akenom47,,160.0,ltbx,"pls papa God, let the PH decriminalize abortion"
Sunshine,5422,1,22ndcenturygirl,,180.0,ltbx,rewatched sunshine sa netflix w my mother and wala syang comment abt sa abortion woww

Sunshine,5423,3,gilsmores,,200.0,ltbx,i just want to hug all the women who have been suffering for a very long time
Sunshine,5423,4,gilsmores,,200.0,ltbx,"this film actually made me think of that college chit-chat from my class last semester that i remember when we were talking about bioethics and the law here in the philippines, my professor told us ""alam kong marami sainyo dito ang pro-choice pero as part ng medical healthworkers, we need to be pro-life kasi we need to be rational and to save lives, kasi that's what we'rs here for: what we're aiming to do as part of our jobs"
Sunshine,5423,5,gilsmores,,200.0,ltbx,""" and at that time i was so devastated and upset at the same time, like i don't know what to feel at that moment"
Sunshine,5423,6,gilsmores,,200.0,ltbx,"syempre as pro-choice i believe in the ""your body your choice"" but hearing that makes me feel like ""hanggang dito ba naman sa healthcare, may pakielam pa rin kayo sa gusto namin gawin"

Sunshine,5424,2,dumblingz,,200.0,ltbx,Nakakatangina how being raised in a patriarchal society makes women feel guilty for not wanting a child—kahit sarili naman talaga nila pinipili nila
Sunshine,5424,3,dumblingz,,200.0,ltbx,"Parang napakalaking kasalanan na ayaw mong maging nanay, worse when andyan na and you want to get rid of it"
Sunshine,5424,4,dumblingz,,200.0,ltbx,Tapos mga sagrado katoliko pa na pinipilit 'yung aral ng dyos na di naman nila sinusunod lang din

Sunshine,5424,8,dumblingz,,200.0,ltbx,Sana makareach sya ng wider audience pa at mamulat sila sa reyalidad na kinahaharap ng mga babae at kabataang babae
Sunshine,5424,9,dumblingz,,200.0,ltbx,"Just to reiterate, women OR girls, shouldn't feel guilty for wanting to get abortion"
Sunshine,5424,10,dumblingz,,200.0,ltbx,"It doesn't matter if you got pregnant from abuse or if you willingly participated, kung ayaw mo edi ayaw mo"
Sunshine,5424,11,dumblingz,,200.0,ltbx,Tapos dapat ang usapan
Sunshine,5424,12,dumblingz,,200.0,ltbx,Wala nang tanong tanong kung naabuso ka ba or kung ginusto mo ba
Sunshine,5424,13,dumblingz,,200.0,ltbx,Ayaw mo ng bata
Sunshine,5424,14,dumblingz,,200.0,ltbx,Wala na dapat karapatan magbigay ng opinion ang di naman kasali sa usapan
Sunshine,5424,15,dumblingz,,200.0,ltbx,"Your body, your choice, it should be that simple"
Sunshine,5425,1,edricks,,180.0,ltbx,Oooh I'm so happy the filmmakers didn't chicken out and choose the conservative Filipino way to end this
Sunshine,5425,2,edricks,,180.0,ltbx,"Yes, abort that annoying child"
Sunshine,5426,1,makgeorri,,180.0,ltbx,i have so many things i want to say omg
Sunshine,5426,2,makgeorri,,180.0,ltbx,"i knew the plot was going to revolve around teenage pregnancy and abortion, but i didn't expect it to be this insane like wtfi watched this movie with the mindset that i hate the concept and idea of having kids, but this strengthened it more especially with the never ending issue of sex education, abortion, and access to healthcare"
Sunshine,5426,3,makgeorri,,180.0,ltbx,hated the acting of sunshine's baby daddy (not even going bother to search for his name) man fuck him and his pastor ass dad minsan napaka hypocritical talaga ng mga taong religious and even those doctors who shamed them for having an abortion like putangina
Sunshine,5428,1,xxxyian,,160.0,ltbx,"I love this film, got me teary eyed a lot  sunshine i love you"

Sunshine,5430,2,genzmom,,160.0,ltbx,this film has been nostalgic for me because I've dealth with some same shit when I was a teenager
Sunshine,5430,3,genzmom,,160.0,ltbx,"Not specifically the abortion just helped a friend and I remembered how difficult it was and scary, The hospital scene"
Sunshine,5430,4,genzmom,,160.0,ltbx,"That's exactly what nurses and doctors will tell you, ""That's murder"

Sunshine,5433,1,nates27,,200.0,ltbx,"Led by an exceptional turn from Maris Racal in the titular role, Sunshine boldly examines women’s rights and body autonomy with an unflinchingly hard-hitting, raw, and powerful social critique—that leaves a lingering impact"
Sunshine,5435,1,pukim,,200.0,ltbx,ang galing talaga ni maris

Sunshine,5511,2,akoetry,,200.0,ltbx,"It is terrifying and undeniably demeaning that many, if not all, do not have access to these basic rights and thus continue to endanger the lives of many women out there"
Sunshine,5511,3,akoetry,,200.0,ltbx,It is more infuriating to know that this also includes children as young as 13
Sunshine,5511,4,akoetry,,200.0,ltbx,"Though this inclusion in the film may seem minor, it actually emphasizes that not being able to be given a choice to our own body steals our futures away"
Sunshine,5511,5,akoetry,,200.0,ltbx,"I also liked the nuances and subtle details that made this film feel more humane and relatable, including the motto etched on the Jeepney Sunshine rode when she found out she was pregnant, which was “GIFT OF GOD"

Sunshine,5539,1,geesaurus,,200.0,ltbx,Nadama ko sa pelikula na mag-isa si Sunshine sa kanyang tinatahak ngunit nadama ko din na may iilang sumoporta sa kanya at ito ay mga kapwa kababaihan
Sunshine,5539,2,geesaurus,,200.0,ltbx,Ito ang mga babae sa istorya na tumatak para sa akin: Sa eksena kung saan tinanggihan ng isang lalaking doctor i-attend ang batang nag pahilot sa takot na mawalan siya ng lisensiya at isang babaeng doctor ang nag lakas loob na tulungan ang bata
Sunshine,5539,3,geesaurus,,200.0,ltbx,Ito ay realidad na ang batas sa bansang ito ay nakaka apekto sa pag lilingkod kapwa
Sunshine,5539,4,geesaurus,,200.0,ltbx,Ang ate ni Sunshine na inintindi at sinuportohan hindi lamang ang desisyon kundi ang pangarap ni Sunshine
Sunshine,5539,5,geesaurus,,200.0,ltbx,"Malaking aspeto ang pagkakaroon ng kapamilya na hindi ka i-guiguilt trip o susumbatan ka sa nagawa mo, bagkus nag tiwala siya na alam ni Sunshine kung ano ang makakabuti para sa sarili niya"
Sunshine,5539,6,geesaurus,,200.0,ltbx,Ang imaginary child na nag boses na gets niya ang alab sa puso na makamit ang pangarap ni Sunshine
Sunshine,5539,7,geesaurus,,200.0,ltbx,Sa tanong na who will protect women
Sunshine,5539,8,geesaurus,,200.0,ltbx,Ang sagot ay tayo
Sunshine,5539,9,geesaurus,,200.0,ltbx,Tayong kapwa kababaihan ang palaging tumutulong sa isa't isa dahil alam natin ang bigat ng mundong pasan pasan natin
Sunshine,5539,10,geesaurus,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa bansang hindi prayoridad ang kalusugan ng kababaihan, napakita ng pelikulang ito ang realidad ng isang babae kakapit sa kung anong meron sa paligid niya na paraan para mag palaglag dahil pinag kakait sa atin ang accessible healthcare"
Sunshine,5539,11,geesaurus,,200.0,ltbx,Ang pelikulang ito ay para sa lahat ng kababaihan na tahimik lumalaban sa ingay ng paligid na palaging may kuda sa kung anong daan ang dapat nating tahakin
Sunshine,5540,1,eyaariri,,200.0,ltbx,I LOVE LOVE THIS FILM SO MUCH especially the fact this fucking country’s laws nor pov is solely based on religion (the way that abortion is still unlegalized since it’s considered murder at bawal sa batas ng diyos)
Sunshine,5540,2,eyaariri,,200.0,ltbx,I like how realistic sunshine waa throughout the film and fuck miggs for almost ruining sunshine’s life smh
Sunshine,5541,1,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,alam mo ung line sa pelikula na “drown out the noise”
Sunshine,5541,2,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,grabe teh
Sunshine,5541,3,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,"hindi lang siya tungkol sa literal na ingay,, it’s the kind of noise na araw-araw nating dinadala bilang babae — yung ingay ng expectations, ng moralism, ng judgment, ng kung sino-sinong feeling entitled magsabi kung ano dapat gawin sa katawan natin"
Sunshine,5541,4,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,"at ang lakas, ang gulo, ang bigat niyang lunurin"
Sunshine,5541,5,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,"pero habang pinapanood ko ang Sunshine, doon ko talaga naramdaman na,, ang hirap na ngang mabuhay bilang babae… tapos nasa Pilipinas ka pa"
Sunshine,5541,6,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,hindii basta hirap na surface level — but that kind of struggle na nakakadrain sa pagkatao mo
Sunshine,5541,7,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,"ung bawat galaw mo, may mata"
Sunshine,5541,8,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,"bawat desisyon mo, may opinyon"
Sunshine,5541,9,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,"bawat pangarap mo, may kapalit na moral judgment"
Sunshine,5541,10,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,"ung tipong ikaw ang may katawan, pero hindi ikaw ang may pinaka-malakas na boses tungkol dito"
Sunshine,5541,11,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,"&&& watching sunshine, parang may kirot na very familiar,, hueyyy"
Sunshine,5541,12,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,yung struggle ni Sunshine
Sunshine,5541,13,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,hindi siya layo sa totoong nararanasan ng maraming babae
Sunshine,5541,14,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,yng pagpili sa sarili kahit lahat ng tao around you sinasabi kung ano dapat mong gawin
Sunshine,5541,15,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,ung bigat ng moralistic expectations
Sunshine,5541,16,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,YUNG TAKOT
Sunshine,5541,17,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,YUNG GUILT
Sunshine,5541,18,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,YUNG SHAME
Sunshine,5541,19,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,na hindi naman dapat sa’yo ibinibigay pero ikaw ang nagdadala
Sunshine,5541,20,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,"kaya naman isa malaking PUTANGINA TALAGA NG MGA LALAKI (no explanation needed)pero ang powerful dito,, pinapakita ng pelikula na kahit gaano kaingay, kahit gaano kagulo — may karapatan kang piliin ang sarili mo"
Sunshine,5541,21,souchikuzeki,,200.0,ltbx,"at gaya ng bata “yung pangarap ko, kung ano ang pangarap niya"" at “gets ko na"
Sunshine,5542,1,juologychewy,,200.0,ltbx,Loved it
Sunshine,5542,2,juologychewy,,200.0,ltbx,No words but great
Sunshine,5542,3,juologychewy,,200.0,ltbx,"Would’ve loved to see it before sa sine, wasnt able to, but a great watch to see how we really need abortion here in the Philippines"
Sunshine,5542,4,juologychewy,,200.0,ltbx,A sad reality of being forced into religion and how most of us don’t want to be moms
Sunshine,5543,1,makatiworms,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine’s better than me I would’ve strangled all of the men she came across in this movie
Sunshine,5544,1,frankierms,,200.0,ltbx,this was a very well made film
Sunshine,5544,2,frankierms,,200.0,ltbx,found myself tearing up because of the whole situation with the other girl
Sunshine,5544,3,frankierms,,200.0,ltbx,GRABE the lengths filipino women would go to just to go through an abortion
Sunshine,5544,4,frankierms,,200.0,ltbx,fuck i hate men
Sunshine,5544,5,frankierms,,200.0,ltbx,i hate the patriarchy super big fan of how the two kids were spectres of the unborn children
Sunshine,5544,6,frankierms,,200.0,ltbx,and also how sunshine was really unable to go through it because of how much her inner self / unborn child keep disagreeing…
Sunshine,5545,1,sofah,,200.0,ltbx,gets na gets kita  felt so hard
Sunshine,5546,1,charms3000,,200.0,ltbx,"GETS NA GETS KITA, SUNSHINE"
Sunshine,5547,1,audrey__,,180.0,ltbx,maris racal is perfect for this role
Sunshine,5548,1,yanyan_beatriz,,200.0,ltbx,a win for ph films
Sunshine,5549,1,kkongnyangz,,180.0,ltbx,"saka na 'yung lengthy review pero tangina direk,,, nailabas ko lahat ng hindi ko nailabas na luha these past 2 weeks AMATSSS"
Sunshine,5550,1,loveamuse,,200.0,ltbx,gets ko na gets ko na gets ko nathose simple (never was) words were already enough to proceed and to thrive without having to feel the struggles within
Sunshine,5550,2,loveamuse,,200.0,ltbx,i love this film so mUCHHH AAAAAA
Sunshine,5551,1,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,Grabe napaiyak naman ako nito
Sunshine,5551,2,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,"Although I have personal reservations about Maris Racal due to past issues, her performance in this film was undeniably amazing"
Sunshine,5551,3,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a definite eye-opener regarding religion, stigma, and the taboo surrounding abortion matters here in the Philippines"
Sunshine,5551,4,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,I genuinely feel for all the women represented by the characters of Sunshine and Rhed
Sunshine,5551,5,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,"They may have different names, but they share a rough, unfair path: being stigmatized and pressured to conform to religious and misogynistic beliefs about motherhood"
Sunshine,5551,6,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,"They are forced into the role of nurturing a child, often without considering their own agency"
Sunshine,5551,7,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,I particularly noticed the scene when Miggy and his father confronted Sunshine about her situation
Sunshine,5551,8,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,They never once asked her what she wanted
Sunshine,5551,9,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,"Their ""plans"" were simply laid out for her to accept without a word, effectively depriving her of choice"
Sunshine,5551,10,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,This lack of genuine care is what hurts
Sunshine,5551,11,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,"Furthermore, the film shows how these women are forced to go through dangerous and unhygienic lengths just to pursue their personal dreams, highlighting how their rights as human beings are limited solely because of their CHOICE"
Sunshine,5551,12,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,"I appreciate this film immensely, and it should be talked about more"
Sunshine,5551,13,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,"The tragic reality of Rhed’s character, a 13-year-old victim raped and impregnated by her own uncle, is a situation faced by many"
Sunshine,5551,14,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,"Yet, victims like her are still discriminated against for wanting an abortion"
Sunshine,5551,15,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,"The movie effectively represents this toxicity, such as the scene where the OB-GYN cruelly orders a literally pale and blue Sunshine to ""repent"" while she is struggling in a hospital bed"
Sunshine,5551,16,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,This film is beautifully made
Sunshine,5551,17,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,"I sincerely hope that someday, people will truly receive the message: Every woman should have a choice"
Sunshine,5551,18,camiiberry,,180.0,ltbx,Depriving them of that fundamental choice does NOT make one a saint
Sunshine,5552,1,tteokjaebi,,200.0,ltbx,"2nd time around, and yes, iba talaga ang tama ng movie pag paulit ulit mo siyang pinapanood"
Sunshine,5553,1,kleyaa,,180.0,ltbx,"Watched this before sa sinehan and with the netflix release, had the chance to watch it again alone and at home (can repeat scenes too)"
Sunshine,5553,2,kleyaa,,180.0,ltbx,It's as good as I remember
Sunshine,5553,3,kleyaa,,180.0,ltbx,"It challenges the foundation of this county's backwards and outdated beliefs — the very fact that we are willing, as a nation, to limit what an individual, specifically, a woman's decisions with what she wants do to her own body even if it means them harm just to hold up centuries-old ideals, because what, we want to feel righteous and good people"
Sunshine,5553,4,kleyaa,,180.0,ltbx,This kind of shit is barbaric and has no place in the current state of the world
Sunshine,5553,5,kleyaa,,180.0,ltbx,The ending was very powerful
Sunshine,5553,6,kleyaa,,180.0,ltbx,"The gymnasium scene where sunshine could be herself: free from the shackles of the patriarchy, is something that brought tears to my eyes"
Sunshine,5553,7,kleyaa,,180.0,ltbx,"However, I feel like final final scene was unnecessary, it could have ended with the ""gets ko na"" scene"
Sunshine,5553,8,kleyaa,,180.0,ltbx,"Jesus, Pilipinas"
Sunshine,5553,9,kleyaa,,180.0,ltbx,Do fucking better
Sunshine,5553,10,kleyaa,,180.0,ltbx,Protect your citizens
Sunshine,5553,11,kleyaa,,180.0,ltbx,Protect women
Sunshine,5554,1,keitape,,200.0,ltbx,ariana what are you doing here
Sunshine,5555,1,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,Gets ko si Sunshine
Sunshine,5555,2,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,This film really captures me the most
Sunshine,5555,3,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,"As a woman who grew up in a most conservative country and a religious family, I feel the comfort of the movie"
Sunshine,5555,4,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,I know that tackling this kind of topic would raise brows to the people especially the one who’s spirituality believes that a women shouldn’t undergo abortion even if she really didn’t want to bear the child
Sunshine,5555,5,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,"Actually, it’s even funnier that this country preach that abortion should ban but the truth is there is a lack of education about sex, abortion, and contraceptives"
Sunshine,5555,6,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,"Additionally, it’s so hypocrisy and misogynistic that people really blame woman for getting pregnant but NOT THE MAN"
Sunshine,5555,7,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,"In fact, they are the ones who put babies inside the woman’s womb"
Sunshine,5555,8,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,I really learned so many lessons in the movie which open my mind to the struggles of a woman
Sunshine,5555,9,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,It’s disappointing that people keep preaching what’s right or wrong but THEY NEVER HELP AND UNDERSTAND THESE WOMEN
Sunshine,5555,10,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,The movie open my mind that abortion SHOULD BE LEGALIZE
Sunshine,5555,11,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,"Abortion ISN’T a sin, murder, nor crime"
Sunshine,5555,12,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,IT’S A HEALTH CARE
Sunshine,5555,13,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,It’s NOT selfish
Sunshine,5555,14,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,It’s okay
Sunshine,5555,15,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,But it is just sad that the Philippines is not yet ready to understand and tackle this kind of topic
Sunshine,5555,16,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,I get Sunshine
Sunshine,5555,17,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,"The guilt-tripping, shame, and misogyny are tackled in a best possible way to give the viewers assurance and comfort"
Sunshine,5555,18,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,"Also, it gives reminder that Filipinos should really open their minds and change their mindset"
Sunshine,5555,19,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,"Women didn’t deserve the shame, the hate, and mostly the expectations that have been throwing to them just because THEY ARE WOMEN"
Sunshine,5555,20,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,For fucking sake
Sunshine,5555,21,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,WOMEN NEED SUPPORT NOT A FUCKING JUDGEMENT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO’S CLAIMING TO BE A SPIRITUALLY ACTIVE BUT CANNOT OPEN THEIR MINDS AND THINK RIGHT
Sunshine,5555,22,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,I hope and wish that the government legalize abortion
Sunshine,5555,23,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,It is not a shameful thing to do
Sunshine,5555,24,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,It is not killing
Sunshine,5555,25,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,It is a self-care — A HEALTH CARE
Sunshine,5555,26,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,People should know and understand that
Sunshine,5555,27,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,"Overall, I really love the movie and it will have a special place in my heart"
Sunshine,5555,28,jelieloop,,200.0,ltbx,"I hope, Filipino directors would produce many movies like this to promote woman and to educate people that abortion is a health care"

Sunshine,5563,5,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,"Kuhang kuha yung reyalidad sa bawat buhay ng mga Pilipino, sa mga babaeng pinagkaitan ng sariling desisyon sa kanilang sariling mga katawan"
Sunshine,5563,6,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,"As a person who agrees about legalising abortion in this country/pro choice, the religious people who tried to convince Shine and even made her feel guilty about aborting her baby triggered me so much"
Sunshine,5563,7,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,"Dahil lamang sa relihiyosong paniniwala, o konsensya"
Sunshine,5563,8,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,"I get it, it is a sin and it is evil thing to do"
Sunshine,5563,9,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,But what's more evil is that producing an unwanted child out of guilt into this world
Sunshine,5563,10,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine wasn't ready to be a mother, she still has dreams to follow, and she has the right to make a decision for her own life, own good, and own satisfaction"
Sunshine,5563,11,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,Miggy didn't even felt responsible for that child
Sunshine,5563,12,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,He only got scared of his pastor father who is also a manipulative religious man
Sunshine,5563,14,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,"Men will be a horndog and disappear, yet it's their sperm that made that baby"
Sunshine,5563,15,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,"Yes, raw sex is pleasuring"
Sunshine,5563,16,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,But the thought or risk of producing a child habang hindi ka pa handa maging magulang ay dapat lamang na mas nangingibabaw sa kagustuhan mong masatisfy sexually
Sunshine,5563,17,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,I hope people are aware of the consequences of their action before doing something because it's a big responsibility
Sunshine,5563,18,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,I love this movie so much

Sunshine,5563,25,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,"Abortion should be legal, especially if it'll be processed by the law too"
Sunshine,5563,26,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,Irresponsible people should not be punished by forcing them to keep the child
Sunshine,5563,27,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,Because only the child will suffer throughout their lives
Sunshine,5563,28,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,"There are for sure a lot of an unwanted pregnancies situation, not only by not using condom but could be also by a failed contraceptives, or lack of knowledge about the reproductive system"
Sunshine,5563,29,kkeitaro_,,200.0,ltbx,"Restricting abortion doesn't really promote responsibility—it just punished people for circumstances that are often beyond their control, and women will always be left with no choice but to abort an unwanted child in a harmful way"

Sunshine,5585,3,lingerinmeadows,,200.0,ltbx,"and, the film gave us this statement as it is"
Sunshine,5585,4,lingerinmeadows,,200.0,ltbx,"moreover, it exactly depicts how our society reacts when a woman participtes in sexual intercourse: bawal, nakakahiya, nakakawala ng dignidad"
Sunshine,5585,5,lingerinmeadows,,200.0,ltbx,"that our society reinforces this same tired belief: kapag babae ang nagkamali, pangalan at pangarap niya ang nakataya"
Sunshine,5585,6,lingerinmeadows,,200.0,ltbx,"nakakairita kasi napakatotoo, “mag-iingat ka,” “isipin mo lagi ‘yung future mo—‘yung pamilya mo,” “tandaan mo na ‘yang virginity mo ang pinakamagandang maireregalo mo sa asawa mo,” mga katagang palagi mo maririnig kapag babae ka pero ni isang beses hindi ibubulong sa isang lalaki"

Sunshine,5585,9,lingerinmeadows,,200.0,ltbx,"it makes the audience uncomfortable, distressed, and painfully aware of how familiar everything is"
Sunshine,5585,10,lingerinmeadows,,200.0,ltbx,"ang ganda lang kasi it’s not about regret, rather it’s reclamation"
Sunshine,5585,11,lingerinmeadows,,200.0,ltbx,"it gives you this dichotomy between burden and freedom, as well as give you the raw and aching truth na nakakagalit, nakakaiyak, nakakaputangina kasi bakit hanggang ngayon ganito pa rin"
Sunshine,5585,12,lingerinmeadows,,200.0,ltbx,"ay, putangina rin ng mga lalaki, putangina ng mga hindi naniniwala na virginity is a social construct that’s used as a tool for the patriarchy to label a woman’s dignity, putangina ng mga hindi hinahayaang magkaroon ng bodily autonomy ang mga babae"

Sunshine,5704,2,svnqiu,,200.0,ltbx,"the emphasis of the need for safe abortions here in the philippines, the fact na “tomboy” daw ung si 13 yr old tapos bakla ung unborn child niya FUCK  andaming details na super ganda"
Sunshine,5704,3,svnqiu,,200.0,ltbx,ung crowded asf maternity ward
Sunshine,5704,4,svnqiu,,200.0,ltbx,yung scene na gets na nung bata si sunshine
Sunshine,5705,1,mistyalex,,140.0,ltbx,"ganda ng message, perfect si maris"
Sunshine,5705,2,mistyalex,,140.0,ltbx,"na-cringe lang ako sa script, they could’ve made it more realistic and more natural"
Sunshine,5705,3,mistyalex,,140.0,ltbx,tapos sa direction din pwede pang gawing mas natural at realistic yung ibang characters
Sunshine,5705,4,mistyalex,,140.0,ltbx,"but i love how the little kid served as like her guardian angel pero it wasn’t necessary at all, just kinda wish ginawa nalang nila na realistic talaga lahat, and made the film more centered kay sunshine and her journey"
Sunshine,5705,5,mistyalex,,140.0,ltbx,maganda pero may kulang talaga
Sunshine,5706,1,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,this is someone’s life right now
Sunshine,5706,2,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,put yourself in their place
Sunshine,5706,3,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,you can understand sunshine even if you’re not pregnant
Sunshine,5706,4,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,even if you’re not a gymnast
Sunshine,5706,5,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,even if you’re not joining the olympics
Sunshine,5706,6,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,"she’s a woman filled with rage, ambition, and dreams"
Sunshine,5706,7,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,"in a place that reeks from layers of sweat, the stench of alcohol, noise, spit, and smoke—under the blazing sun and along filthy streets, sunshine keeps shining"
Sunshine,5706,8,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,she can carry herself even when only a few stand behind her
Sunshine,5706,9,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,it’s hard to be a woman
Sunshine,5706,10,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,it’s hard to live on your own
Sunshine,5706,11,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,it’s hard to bear problems you never wanted in the first place
Sunshine,5706,12,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,it’s hard to live comfortably when you don’t have the privilege to attain that right away
Sunshine,5706,13,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,"but if no one reaches for her hand, she’ll take her own"
Sunshine,5706,14,aenuie,,140.0,ltbx,because her story isn’t about waiting for someone else to save her—it’s about uncovering the strength that has always been inside her
Sunshine,5707,1,hotgotto,,20.0,ltbx,"jadaone never fails to deliver a movie that starts strong but falls flat and chokes on the message it’s attempting to tell, whatever that may be"
Sunshine,5707,2,hotgotto,,20.0,ltbx,"every story she writes is abysmal and surface level and almost always advocates for shallow feminism, hanggang doon nalang ba tayo"
Sunshine,5707,3,hotgotto,,20.0,ltbx,spouting for women’s rights without actually understanding the nuance of what you’re actually advocating for
Sunshine,5707,4,hotgotto,,20.0,ltbx,"maliban sa poverty porn na kinatutuwaan ipakita palagi ni jadaone, from fan girl to sunshine, she also likes showcasing sexual assault as a plot device, only this time it wasn’t shown to us explicitly—wow, how she’s advanced in her writing noh"
Sunshine,5707,5,hotgotto,,20.0,ltbx,"(sarcasm meant)while i appreciate the gritty and emotional moments of the film especially when the focus is entirely on the movie’s protagonist who it’s named after (maris carried this entire film along with the supporting cast’s acting) it’s overshadowed by it’s dogshit abysmal surface level performative writing, its inclusion of imaginary children that is either a representation of the characters and their inner child or their unborn children which confuses and irritates me as they’re shown way too much, the on the nose messaging of conservatism in the philippines, the lack of detail on how important sunshine’s dream actually is because it focuses on another separate character that rids sunshine a chunk of her story and conflict, and the abstract, hollow message they’re trying to advocate for"
Sunshine,5707,6,hotgotto,,20.0,ltbx,"genuinely, can we take the pen away from this grown ass woman"
Sunshine,5707,7,hotgotto,,20.0,ltbx,"not only does she exploit the masa to serve her story but women as well, nakakabastos sa totoo lang, not very feminist and not very for the masa also—add to the fact that jadaone probably thinks that her audience is stupid and can’t read in between the lines for how she chooses to write the story"
Sunshine,5707,8,hotgotto,,20.0,ltbx,"more actions, less words sana, more time spent in the writer’s room, less color-grading and filming quiapo’s slums for your poverty porn sana"
Sunshine,5707,9,hotgotto,,20.0,ltbx,"i could say more but i’d have to give half a star at least for the cast’s amazing performances, they carried this film, and they deserve the recognition especially maris racal"
Sunshine,5707,10,hotgotto,,20.0,ltbx,also nagulat ako andito pala si piolo pascual haha
Sunshine,5708,1,unaisip,,160.0,ltbx,"""Yung pangarap ko, kung ano ang pangarap niya""it's such a brave move for anyone to take this on considering how against our country is in making abortion safe and legal"
Sunshine,5708,2,unaisip,,160.0,ltbx,sunshine is a beautiful film that depicts the reality of being a woman in this country
Sunshine,5708,3,unaisip,,160.0,ltbx,the philippines is not ready for this and it shows
Sunshine,5709,1,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,Hands down
Sunshine,5709,2,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,One of the best filipino films I have ever seen
Sunshine,5709,3,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,This deserves more than what I’ll write
Sunshine,5709,4,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,More than the stars I’ve given
Sunshine,5709,5,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,More than a mere category of ‘favorites’
Sunshine,5709,6,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,This is worth talking about
Sunshine,5709,7,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,The film I should see when tackling feminism
Sunshine,5709,8,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,The film that shows how the Philippines lack support for its beautiful and brave women
Sunshine,5709,9,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Una sa lahat, fuck quiapo air"
Sunshine,5709,10,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Quiapo—ang baho, ang sikip, ang init"
Sunshine,5709,11,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Pero Quiapo… a place where you’ll find even the tiniest bit of hope, a place where even an ounce of solution can be found, a place where help exists, even if only through a few people"
Sunshine,5709,12,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,i also loved how fuckass men were portrayed in this movie
Sunshine,5709,13,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"walang kwentang jowa, walang kwentang kapatid, walang kwentang tatay, walang kwentang tito, walang kwentang doktor"
Sunshine,5709,14,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,Tangina ang may kwentang lalaki lang ata rito is yung tricycle driver eh
Sunshine,5709,15,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,Tangina ng mga lalaking ganyan
Sunshine,5709,16,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,Patriarchy at its finest
Sunshine,5709,17,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Also, fuck women who let themselves be abused by this power"
Sunshine,5709,18,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Yes, I’m talking about YOU nanay ni Mary Grace"
Sunshine,5709,19,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"as it progressed, onti-onti kong nararamdaman yung emotional sincerity ng film"
Sunshine,5709,20,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,yung dilemmas of decisions ni sunshine and yung heartbreaking truth about Mary Grace’s pregnancy
Sunshine,5709,21,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,13 years old pa lang siya
Sunshine,5709,22,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Yes, 13 years old pa lang siya"
Sunshine,5709,23,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,The movie refuses to romanticize their situation
Sunshine,5709,24,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"instead, it leans into the uncomfortable truths of being a young woman in a society that praises discipline, resilience, and sacrifice yet offers little support when life derails"
Sunshine,5709,25,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Director Jadaone shapes the film with a raw, documentary-like honesty: tight shots of silent breakdowns, stripped-down scenes with no dramatic score, and a narrative that mirrors the suffocating pressure placed on young Filipinas navigating taboo choices"
Sunshine,5709,26,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Lastly, ang nagustuhan ko talaga sa film na to is the fact na the film didn’t fail to show and acknowledge the other women surrounding sunshine"
Sunshine,5709,27,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"women who, though not always in the spotlight, embody the many forms of pressure, expectation, and silent resilience that shape the world she moves in"
Sunshine,5709,28,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"they all carry their own versions of sacrifice: women praised for being disciplined, nurturing, and endlessly strong, yet rarely offered the same support they tirelessly give"
Sunshine,5709,29,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,like seriously
Sunshine,5709,30,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,the maternity ward scene broke my heart so much  seeing allthe women sharing the same beds also shows how fucked up our healthcare system really is
Sunshine,5709,31,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,Tayo-tayo lang rin nagtutulungan
Sunshine,5709,32,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,Tayo lang ang sumusuporta sa isa’t isa
Sunshine,5709,33,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,Tayo lang mga babae
Sunshine,5709,34,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,Kudos to that tindera
Sunshine,5709,35,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,Ironic lang na sa harap pa talaga ng mga rebulto ni santo niño nagtinda ng pampalaglag  these kinds of religious beliefs shouldn’t really hinder us from doing what’s right and best for ourselves
Sunshine,5709,36,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"and in showing these women’s quiet struggles, the film expands its emotional weight, reminding us that the story isn’t just about one girl’s burden but about an entire generation of women expected to endure everything while being thanked for it in silence"
Sunshine,5709,37,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"kulang pa tayo sa pansin, sa pagmamahal, at sa suporta"
Sunshine,5709,38,2yaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"i hope that someday, all of us can finally feel how to live as a woman and be loved as a woman"
Sunshine,5710,1,varxiard,,200.0,ltbx,"gets ko na, sunshine"

Sunshine,5711,3,chewymey,,200.0,ltbx,"Kung napanood mo na to' at hindi mo pa rin gets, magsorry ka na lang kay Papa God"
Sunshine,5712,1,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,Rewatched it and still felt underwhelmed
Sunshine,5712,2,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,The trailer was so promising and I expected a lot
Sunshine,5712,3,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,I’m all for it from what they’re trying to convey but the storytelling wasn’t it
Sunshine,5712,4,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,Execution is realistic tho
Sunshine,5712,5,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,"I believe most of us relates in jeepney scene when you’re in the verge of breaking down and you don’t know what to do but to breathe slowly and comfort yourself, hoping no one would notice"
Sunshine,5712,6,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,"Love the irony, the symbolism, and the heats"
Sunshine,5712,7,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,"But then again, they be trying to highlight everything all at once but failed to deliver why we’re here in the first place"
Sunshine,5712,8,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,"It was moving, as a woman"
Sunshine,5712,9,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,BUT AS A WOMAN I was hoping for a more impactful message since it opened a lot of discourse
Sunshine,5712,10,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,Women are far more complex and I was looking for chaos in what a woman feels in a society where everyone are so entitled to decide on how a woman should act and carry themselves
Sunshine,5712,11,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,"The movie could’ve gone deeper, one that touches diff range of emotions"
Sunshine,5712,12,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,"It just doesn’t feel genuine, yk"
Sunshine,5712,13,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,"Overall, Im giving it 4 stars"
Sunshine,5712,14,y2krzl,,160.0,ltbx,Such a brave movie for a conservative country
Sunshine,5713,1,lizzierates,,200.0,ltbx,oo masama ang pumatay pero mas masama yung tanggalan ka ng karapatan paano mabuhay dahil lang hindi gusto ng ibang tao

Sunshine,5724,1,10hnna,,200.0,ltbx,"""gets ko na"" this movie definitely made me sob and as i am writing this i am still uncontrollably sobbing from the realistic lifestyles in the philippines and the tragic reality that one can face at such a young age is spoken up so much, you never really know what goes inside a persons life"
Sunshine,5724,2,10hnna,,200.0,ltbx,"speaking of the philippines, they should really talk more about the importance of puberty especially sex education because hormonal levels rise and clueless teenagers don't know what to do about it"
Sunshine,5724,3,10hnna,,200.0,ltbx,"If they talk about it to an adult, they will likely get shamed for feeling that way when it happens"
Sunshine,5724,4,10hnna,,200.0,ltbx,"If they're going to keep abortion illegal, at least educate people properly to prevent it from happening, especially the guys, they should have consequences too"
Sunshine,5724,5,10hnna,,200.0,ltbx,"Women are more likely to be shamed than men because she's carrying the child, but the child is also part of the dad's dna"
Sunshine,5724,6,10hnna,,200.0,ltbx,"Especially those who are sick minded groomers, they definitely should be stricter and on the lookout for"

Sunshine,5731,1,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,"Kudos to Direk Tonet, Maris Racal, and the whole team responsible for creating this film, thank you for being brave and casting a light on our nation’s issues often overlooked in fear of the cultural taboo it carries"
Sunshine,5731,2,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,"I would have rated it 5 stars, but the choice to represent Sunshine’s internal conflict with herself through a hallucinated child character doesn’t sit right with me"
Sunshine,5731,3,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,Jadaone’s direction results in jarring tonal shifts that muddle the film’s emotional center
Sunshine,5731,4,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,"What was perhaps intended as a bold attempt at cinematic expression to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour"
Sunshine,5731,5,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility
Sunshine,5731,6,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,"In fact, by personifying an unborn child as a character which speaks and thinks, then Sunshine unintentionally reinforces the very moral framing that anti-abortion rhetoric thrives on"
Sunshine,5731,7,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,It circles back into the age-old “when does life begin
Sunshine,5731,8,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,"” debate—a question that continues to paralyze policymaking in the country, even when the conversation should be about autonomy, access, and proper healthcare"
Sunshine,5731,9,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, frames it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics"
Sunshine,5731,10,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,"Though, I will still give my flowers to this movie"
Sunshine,5731,11,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,It helped brought upon a conversation in our country long overdue and for that I am grateful
Sunshine,5731,12,samdotmov,,160.0,ltbx,I hope it inspires other filmmakers to be bold in the face of a country that chooses to be blind to issues that continue to grow with no solutions in sight

Sunshine,5737,3,kayeberries,,200.0,ltbx,Some of my key takeaways:1
Sunshine,5737,4,kayeberries,,200.0,ltbx,Take away access and people will turn to dangerous methods
Sunshine,5737,6,kayeberries,,200.0,ltbx,"If you're young or not ready or do not have the capacity to give a child a good life, you shouldn't have to be forced to have a child 3"

Sunshine,5742,4,nyrourm,,160.0,ltbx,"ang abortion, kahit ang mga kaso ng pagiging batang ina ay magkahalong topic na hanggang ngayon ay palagi pa ring pinag-aawayan ng bansa natin na lumaking relihiyoso"
Sunshine,5742,5,nyrourm,,160.0,ltbx,naniniwala ako bilang isang kabataan na ang palabas na kagaya ng ‘Sunshine’ ay magmi-mistulang hard pill to swallow para sa ibang makakapanood nito—lalong lalo na sa matatanda
Sunshine,5742,6,nyrourm,,160.0,ltbx,"sobrang raw ng pelikulang to—kitang-kita sa cinematography, sa ingay, sa pag-arte, sa kulay, sa shots, at sa mga karakter kung paano ba talaga ang takbo ng Maynila sa isang araw"
Sunshine,5742,7,nyrourm,,160.0,ltbx,"Lalo na kay Sunshine at Menggay, na nagpapakita kung paano mamuhay ang isang babae sa Pilipinas"

Sunshine,5749,10,tobilog,,200.0,ltbx,"i stand by my notion that pregnancy must never be romanticized, for it is a big responsibility to carry and such a heavy toll on a woman’s life"
Sunshine,5749,11,tobilog,,200.0,ltbx,"such a beautiful movie, from its core to its composition"
Sunshine,5749,12,tobilog,,200.0,ltbx,the framing of each shot is so good and so honest in showcasing manila as it is—chaotic and alive

Sunshine,5762,2,hellojaaack,,200.0,ltbx,what i love about the film is how powerful it is; it resonates deeply with viewers and delivers a clear message consistently from start to finish
Sunshine,5762,3,hellojaaack,,200.0,ltbx,"maraming sunshine sa lipunan—na biglaan, takot, at walang lakas ng loob na harapin ang pagiging ina—pero hindi ito usapin na masama ng tao si sunshine kaagad nang dahil lamang sa hindi pa siya handa"
Sunshine,5762,4,hellojaaack,,200.0,ltbx,"a moment of temptation is not enough reason to demand she accept her situation, as forcing a woman into parenthood before she is ready is a far greater mistake"
Sunshine,5762,5,hellojaaack,,200.0,ltbx,"i hope this film opens more eyes and highlights the need to strengthen reproductive rights in our country, recognizing that abortion is a right for all women"

Sunshine,5762,8,hellojaaack,,200.0,ltbx,"it is heartbreaking that in the philippines, a case of violence against women is reported every 57 minutes"

Sunshine,5799,4,erseasteria,,160.0,ltbx,"kaya kung ako ang tatanungin, the fact na they were brave enough to dive into that taboo topic palang, it alr made the movie good"
Sunshine,5799,5,erseasteria,,160.0,ltbx,"sobrang realistic, sobrang authentic, at sobrang maka-tao"
Sunshine,5799,6,erseasteria,,160.0,ltbx,nakakalungkot isipin na kailangan pang pagdaanan ng mga kababaihan yung dangers ng isang bagay na dapat assisted na and legal with healthcare
Sunshine,5799,7,erseasteria,,160.0,ltbx,hindi ko maintindihan bakit ang desisyon ay nakasalalay sa mga taong wala namang karapatang bumoses

Sunshine,5800,1,jennyyin1,,180.0,ltbx,even the extra characters did well to the point na sobrang natural ng pagkakadeliver ng lines and they way they act
Sunshine,5800,2,jennyyin1,,180.0,ltbx,"upon reading reviews, ang lungkot isipin na kahirapan na talaga ang naging simbolismo ng pilipinas"
Sunshine,5800,3,jennyyin1,,180.0,ltbx,"when they said “very pinoy”; ofc it’ll start off with “maynila” then hindi na naaalis sa huli ang hirap, kalat, ingay, gulo, korapsyon, hypocrisy, etc"
Sunshine,5800,4,jennyyin1,,180.0,ltbx,this film is really well produced
Sunshine,5800,5,jennyyin1,,180.0,ltbx,"it’s something na worth panoorin, esp sa mga hindi naiintindihan ang aborsyon"
Sunshine,5800,6,jennyyin1,,180.0,ltbx,"and realistic din yung fact na hindi gaano natackle yung lalaki haha, sa babae talaga lagi salo yung blame and judgement"
Sunshine,5800,7,jennyyin1,,180.0,ltbx,putangina diba
Sunshine,5800,8,jennyyin1,,180.0,ltbx,sobrang importante ng role ni Annika here
Sunshine,5800,9,jennyyin1,,180.0,ltbx,"in the end when she threw the line and assured Sunshine “gets ko na”, i see it as innocence, influence, open mindedness, and realist—growth"
Sunshine,5800,10,jennyyin1,,180.0,ltbx,"she’s young—innocent, and her judgement might be due to influence of others, then there’s open mindedness kung san hindi siya nagstay sa same mindset nung naka encounter na siya ng same situation kay Sunshine, but different reasons behind—Ariana’s friend"
Sunshine,5800,11,jennyyin1,,180.0,ltbx,And then there’s being realist at the end na it’s just okay dahil…hindi natin alam ang pinagdadaanan ng bawat isa
Sunshine,5801,1,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,lahat ng tao ay may sariling ingay na tinatahak
Sunshine,5801,2,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"sa pelikula, hindi lang ito ingay ng traffic o tambutso"
Sunshine,5801,3,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"ito yung ingay ng moralidad, ng tsismis, ng relihiyong mabilis magturo pero mabagal magmahal"
Sunshine,5801,4,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"ito yung ingay ng mga taong hindi naman mabubuhay sa katawan mo pero sila ang pinakamalakas magdikta kung ano ang dapat mong maramdaman, gawin, at piliin"
Sunshine,5801,5,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"at sa lahat ng ito, isang nineteen-year-old girl ang pasan ang mundo—a girl who should’ve been allowed to dream freely, pero sinasakal na ng lipunang takot sa kababaihang may sariling isip"
Sunshine,5801,6,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,isang bagay na ramdam mo agad sa pelikula: magkakampi ang mga babae
Sunshine,5801,7,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"halos lahat ng karakter ay babae, at karamihan sa kanila may dalang munting piraso ng simpatya"
Sunshine,5801,8,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,isang kolektibong danas
Sunshine,5801,9,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"isang unspoken sisterhood built on the multiple burdens that women carry: being caregivers, dreamers, breadwinners, shock absorbers of society’s cruelty"
Sunshine,5801,10,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"pero hindi rin romantisado ang pelikula—may mga babaeng kakampi, at may mga babaeng hindi"
Sunshine,5801,11,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"katulad ng doktor na ultraconservative, na nagpapaalala sa atin ng painful truth: hindi lahat ng babae ay mapagpalaya, at hindi lahat ng babae ay kakampi sa kapwa babae"
Sunshine,5801,12,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"minsan, ang mismong sistemang umaapi ay umiiral din sa mga babaeng natutong ipasa-pasa ang sakit"
Sunshine,5801,13,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,pinaka-mahalaga sa lahat: hindi totoong pagiging makasarili ang pagdedesisyon ng babae para sa sarili niyang katawan
Sunshine,5801,14,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"kung may isang “gets ko na” moment ang sunshine, ito ‘yon"
Sunshine,5801,15,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"kung sarili lang niya ang iniisip niya, wala sana tayong ganitong pelikula"
Sunshine,5801,16,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,wala sana tayong ganitong lalim
Sunshine,5801,17,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"pero ang totoo, bawat desisyon niya ay puno ng takot, pagmamahal, at pag-asa—lahat ng bagay na kinalimutan ng lipunan kapag babae ang may kailangan pumili"
Sunshine,5801,18,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"dito rin pumapasok ang simbolismo ng batang babae—ang unborn child, ang personified conscience"
Sunshine,5801,19,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"ariana is 13 y/o's own past self, her own fear, her own what-if"
Sunshine,5801,20,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"lahat ng interaction nila ay nangyayari “sa loob,” sa pinakatahimik na sulok ng isip ng babaeng hinahati ng daigdig"
Sunshine,5801,21,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"at nung ending, it’s for herself"
Sunshine,5801,22,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,the hug is acceptance
Sunshine,5801,23,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,ang yakap na iyon ay tahimik na paglaya
Sunshine,5801,24,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"pero kahit sa mundong pilit nagpapatahimik sa kababaihan, may irony na hindi kayang itago ang pelikula: sa isang konserbatibong lipunan, ang nagbebenta ng religious figures ay siya ring nagbebenta ng abortion pill"
Sunshine,5801,25,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,ang ob ay bigot
Sunshine,5801,26,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,ang bahay ay hindi laging ligtas
Sunshine,5801,27,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,ang simbahan ay humuhusga
Sunshine,5801,28,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,at ang babae
Sunshine,5801,29,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,wala man lang tunay na espasyo para huminga
Sunshine,5801,30,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"bakit ang mga lalaki, may opsyon"

Sunshine,5801,32,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,dito nagiging mas malakas si sunshine
Sunshine,5801,33,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,hindi siya martyr
Sunshine,5801,34,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,hindi siya sainted victim
Sunshine,5801,35,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,she doesn’t just endure—she decides
Sunshine,5801,36,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,she chooses herself kahit alam niyang bawat galaw niya may kasamang kurot ng panibagong judgment
Sunshine,5801,37,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"she’s not fearless, but she moves anyway"
Sunshine,5801,38,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"at minsan, iyon na ang pinaka-matapang na pwedeng gawin ng babae sa bansang sobrang hilig kontrolin ang katawan at kinabukasan niya"

Sunshine,5801,42,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"ang sabi ni direk jadaone, ang pagbubuntis ay magbabago sa katawan ni sunshine, sa career niya, sa buong trajectory niya bilang atleta"
Sunshine,5801,43,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"at totoo—para kay sunshine, ang pregnancy ay literal career suicide"
Sunshine,5801,44,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,at dito umaalingawngaw ang tanong na gusto talagang ipukpok ng pelikula: bakit ba laging kababaihan ang kinakailangang magsakripisyo ng pangarap
Sunshine,5801,45,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,bakit ang freedom ng babae ay laging conditional
Sunshine,5801,46,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,kaya oo—decriminalize abortion
Sunshine,5801,47,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"kasi ang autonomy ay hindi dapat ipinaglalaban, dapat innate"
Sunshine,5801,48,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,ang katawan ng babae ay hindi battleground para sa moralidad ng iba
Sunshine,5801,49,nikrang_done,,200.0,ltbx,"in the end, sunshine reminds you that sometimes the bravest thing a girl can do is to choose herself, quietly, consistently, even when the world says she shouldn’t"

Sunshine,5809,3,twdrms,,200.0,ltbx,"I was right, she hated it"
Sunshine,5809,4,twdrms,,200.0,ltbx,HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHThe fact that a religious person hates this movie says a lot that they just regards the importance of abortion in a woman life
Sunshine,5809,5,twdrms,,200.0,ltbx,"Really, this movie is so heavy for me—not in a negative way you know"
Sunshine,5809,6,twdrms,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang heavy niya kasi you’re looking and peeking through the life and struggles ng mga babaeng naiiwan kapag nabuntis, and that’s too painful kasi there’s no two sides of the coin na"
Sunshine,5809,7,twdrms,,200.0,ltbx,"A woman always left thorn between keeping her dreams or to be a mother, samantalang ‘yung nakabuntis, tangina, sasabihin hindi pa siya handa at sustento na lang ambag"

Sunshine,5809,10,twdrms,,200.0,ltbx,It’s her life
Sunshine,5809,11,twdrms,,200.0,ltbx,I hope it becomes an eye opener for every Filipino
Sunshine,5809,12,twdrms,,200.0,ltbx,They should consider these factors and not only basing on their beliefs just because they are not affected with it
Sunshine,5809,13,twdrms,,200.0,ltbx,Ang daling sabihin na “bata ‘yan” pero paano naman ang buhay ng isang babae

Sunshine,5811,3,reiukss,,180.0,ltbx,"From secretive clinic visits to hushed conversations with unsympathetic adults— with Sunshine’s journey, you can feel the judgement of a society that constantly polices women’s bodies and their choices"
Sunshine,5811,4,reiukss,,180.0,ltbx,"Patriarchy is relentless : they leave it up to the women to pick up the pieces that the men shattered— ""Bahala ka na diyan, just get rid of it"""
Sunshine,5811,5,reiukss,,180.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal’s performance was exquisite, ramdam mo yung pagod, sakit, and overwhelming suffocation that Sunshine faces as she navigates through making a choice that is supposed to be hers and hers alone"
Sunshine,5811,6,reiukss,,180.0,ltbx,"Every flip, every landing, every stretch was a step towards her dreams— the stage, the recognition, the life she has ever envisioned for so long"
Sunshine,5811,7,reiukss,,180.0,ltbx,Sunshine’s journey is not just about survival; it’s about the courage to continue dreaming in a world determined to limit her
Sunshine,5811,8,reiukss,,180.0,ltbx,"Gymnastics wasn’t more than a sport, it was her identity, her sanctuary, the place that gave her hope to keep believing"
Sunshine,5811,9,reiukss,,180.0,ltbx,"At the end, pinili niya pangarap niya, despite the fear, the sadness, and the guilt, her decision was a refusal to let anyone dictate her future, to let her stop that dream"
Sunshine,5812,1,larararawshi,,200.0,ltbx,"suntok sa puso ang pelikulang ito, hindi lang dahil sa pangarap niya pati na rin sa representasyon ng isang bata na naging tulong din isang malaking problemang kinaharapan niya—isa sa naging sandalan niya sa kung ano man mga bagay na hindi makatutulong sa problema niya"

Sunshine,5829,3,maeawww,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa totoo lang, isa sa scene na napatanong na lang talaga ako kung ano bang silbi talaga ng mga lalaki ay yung nasa hospital si Sunshine kasi dinala niya si Menggay doon, tapos ipinakita yung mga kama na kaunti lang ang espasyo sa isa’t isa, yung mga manganganak pa lang at nakapanganak ng mga babae na nag-uusap at nag-abutan ng gamit ng bata"

Sunshine,5845,1,nagnonood,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s a film about women — their suffering, their heartbreak, their impossible choices — in a society that pretends to protect them yet refuses to listen to them"
Sunshine,5845,2,nagnonood,,200.0,ltbx,"Especially when it comes to abortion, the film exposes how cruel a world can be when faith is used not for compassion, but for judgment"
Sunshine,5845,3,nagnonood,,200.0,ltbx,Ang lalim ng emosyon sa bawat eksena
Sunshine,5845,4,nagnonood,,200.0,ltbx,"Just the truth, plain and heavy"

Sunshine,5845,6,nagnonood,,200.0,ltbx,Maris delivers a performance that feels painfully honest
Sunshine,5845,7,nagnonood,,200.0,ltbx,"Ang galing ni Maris, and I’ve never doubted her talent, pero dito she carries a story so much bigger than her character — a story shared by countless women who are tired of being silenced"

Sunshine,5848,1,ashietone,,200.0,ltbx,nakakaiyak talaga e
Sunshine,5849,1,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,the moment i realized they brought the kids to life…
Sunshine,5849,2,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,"amazing conceptalthough they show the potential of what their kids could have been or who they could have become, and it hurts to take it away, the current lives of the mothers also have to be considered"
Sunshine,5849,3,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,they also have dreams to fulfill
Sunshine,5849,4,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,taking away their future also means taking away the future of their children
Sunshine,5849,5,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,"both are really big factors to take in, but what truly matters is knowing what needs to be done today for a better tomorrow"
Sunshine,5849,6,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,"so if you’re asking me, the real selfishness here is doing what is deemed right by society just because they don’t realize how selfish bringing a life to a world that isn’t ready for you is"
Sunshine,5849,7,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,it’s simple
Sunshine,5849,8,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,"they’re not ready, and that should be a good enough reason"
Sunshine,5849,9,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,and the way this was written and directed by a filipino woman is really brave storytelling
Sunshine,5849,10,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,i loved it
Sunshine,5849,11,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,i hope more close minded people watch this
Sunshine,5849,12,ratedj,,160.0,ltbx,this should be shown in catholic schools

Sunshine,5851,1,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"First of all, I know that this movie premiered at the 49th Toronto International Film Festival in 2024 and arrived in Philippine cinemas 4 months ago"
Sunshine,5851,2,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,And now that it finally dropped on Netflix… I hope I’m not too late to say it finally: This movie is powerful Antoinette Jadaone delivers one of her most fearless films yet with ‘’ — a coming-of-age sports drama that hits with quiet power and emotional honesty
Sunshine,5851,3,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal plays the titular character, a young gymnast on the road to the Olympics"
Sunshine,5851,4,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"Her world revolves around discipline, repetition, and the dream of making it to the competition she’s trained her whole life for"
Sunshine,5851,5,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"But when she discovers she’s pregnant, her perfectly controlled world cracks open"
Sunshine,5851,6,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,What I loved about the film is how it never sensationalizes her situation
Sunshine,5851,7,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine’s fear is treated with quiet realism
Sunshine,5851,8,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"The movie acknowledges how complicated teenage pregnancy is, especially in a society where abortion, reproductive rights, and bodily autonomy remain heavily stigmatized and often misunderstood"
Sunshine,5851,9,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,These themes are controversial
Sunshine,5851,10,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"And yes, the movie will divide people"
Sunshine,5851,11,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,But ‘’ refuses to look away from the truth:
Sunshine,5851,13,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,Maris is phenomenal here
Sunshine,5851,14,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,She carries the entire emotional weight of the story with a performance that feels painfully real
Sunshine,5851,15,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"She rarely breaks down on screen, but you think her internal collapse in the smallest expressions — the breath she holds, the way she avoids eye contact, the way she pushes her dream forward while everything else is falling apart"
Sunshine,5851,16,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"The supporting cast — particularly Jennica Garcia, Meryll Soriano, Rhed Bustamante, and Xyriel Manabat — also elevate the film, each representing a different kind of pressure or support Sunshine faces"
Sunshine,5851,17,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"And yeah, some male characters in the movie definitely got what they deserved"
Sunshine,5851,18,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"Jadaone’s direction is quiet, patient, and uncomfortably close — exactly how it should be"
Sunshine,5851,19,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,The movie lets us follow Sunshine’s anxiety and feel the suffocating pressure she’s under
Sunshine,5851,20,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,One of the film’s boldest artistic choices is the recurring appearance of a mysterious girl who seems to follow Sunshine
Sunshine,5851,21,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"At first it’s confusing, then a bit eerie, then surprisingly emotional"
Sunshine,5851,22,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"I won’t spoil anything, but when the film finally reveals who she represents…"
Sunshine,5851,23,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s symbolic, heartbreaking, and adds a deeper emotional layer to Sunshine’s arc"
Sunshine,5851,24,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"Beyond the gymnastics, beyond the controversy, Sunshine is really about choice — and how young women often aren’t given the space to empower themselves to make their own choices"
Sunshine,5851,25,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"The movie conveys important messages: your body is your own; silence can mask the deepest struggles; the pressure to be perfect is harmful; pursuing dreams matters, but so is ensuring one's survival; kindness fosters safety, while judgment breeds fear; and young women need safe spaces"
Sunshine,5851,26,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,The movie doesn’t push a specific viewpoint — it drives for humanity
Sunshine,5851,27,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"Overall, ‘’ is brave, heartbreaking, and painfully relevant"
Sunshine,5851,28,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,It does not shout — it whispers truths that hit even harder
Sunshine,5851,29,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"Indeed, it’s a film that mirrors reality for many young women today, and one that our society needs to see, even if the conversations it starts are uncomfortable"
Sunshine,5851,30,jolsf,,200.0,ltbx,"With that being said, I’m going to give this movie…9/10"

Sunshine,5858,3,contratina,,180.0,ltbx,"It kinda felt like it should've ended at the scene before that, when she was having that conversation with the Girl about her understanding her decision"
Sunshine,5858,4,contratina,,180.0,ltbx,"I didn't super love how it felt like her getting an abortion had to be justified because she ended up as an amazing gymnast, that she needed to prove that it was worth it"
Sunshine,5858,5,contratina,,180.0,ltbx,"Not wanting to be a mother is enough justification, imo, and that alone makes the abortion worth it"
Sunshine,5858,6,contratina,,180.0,ltbx,"Anyway, what a beautiful and impactful film  love all the Sunshines in tne world"
Sunshine,5859,1,alfredyy,,160.0,ltbx,"This is an eye-opener to the Filipinos that, women are entitled to abort their child whether it’s on purpose or not; we should not be blind by our belief—in Christianity"
Sunshine,5859,2,alfredyy,,160.0,ltbx,"Because this is not about the child alone, but also the mere fact of being a mother unprepared"
Sunshine,5859,3,alfredyy,,160.0,ltbx,That’s why abortion should be legalized

Sunshine,5863,3,shenelleandrea,,100.0,ltbx,"I’m all for pro-choice, but I just wish the execution had been a little stronger"
Sunshine,5863,4,shenelleandrea,,100.0,ltbx,"nevertheless, i’m glad they chose to speak up abt this"

Sunshine,5870,2,namsyaat,,200.0,ltbx,"we just need to decide, and stand by it, what we really want for us to not have regrets"
Sunshine,5870,3,namsyaat,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine tells a story how a single decision can turn your life 180 degrees
Sunshine,5870,4,namsyaat,,200.0,ltbx,"it also portrays that people, especially women, have the right to decide what they want to do with their OWN bodies"
Sunshine,5870,5,namsyaat,,200.0,ltbx,"You may hate the fact that people do decide abortions, but you dont get a say about it"

Sunshine,5874,2,counvinj,,160.0,ltbx,Ang dami laging sinasabi ng mga tao --- from how you should dress to how you should deal with your own body
Sunshine,5874,3,counvinj,,160.0,ltbx,"So in a very judgmental country like the Philippines, parang wala ka na talagang choice but to drown out the noise"
Sunshine,5874,4,counvinj,,160.0,ltbx,"This film is raw, relevant and necessary"
Sunshine,5874,5,counvinj,,160.0,ltbx,I'm also glad na this movie became mainstream kasi it makes us think and talk
Sunshine,5874,6,counvinj,,160.0,ltbx,I never realized I hadn’t fully understood my stance on abortion until I watched this film
Sunshine,5874,7,counvinj,,160.0,ltbx,"Other comments: - Feel ko lang ang daming hindi naconsider/napakita sa film like how athletes should also be public figures (atleast on my POV, if athlete ka, medyo known ka talaga sa public --- especially if marami ka panalo)"
Sunshine,5874,8,counvinj,,160.0,ltbx,So iniisip ko lang how Sunshine could roam freely nang walang nakakakita sa kanya

Sunshine,5881,2,17swkz,,200.0,ltbx,"mahigpit na yakap para sa mga katulad ni sunshine, na patuloy pinagkakaitan ng gobyerno at ng simbahan ng laya na makapagdesisyon para sa sarili niya, kahit gaano pa natin sabihin na progresibo na tayo, hindi pa rin mawawala ang mga katulad ni pastor jamie, bobot, miggy, nanay ni menggay at ng doctor na gumamot kay sunshine noong una siyang dinala sa ospital, may balik din yan sa inyo"

Sunshine,5885,3,antonio_100,,,ltbx,"maaring dahil yung dating sakin ay hindi sya pumapanig sa isang side lamang, kumbaga hindi firm yung stance ng palabas"
Sunshine,5885,4,antonio_100,,,ltbx,pero baka ayun din yung kabuuang mensahe na tinitimbang at pinagiisipan nang mabuti ang ganitong mga bagay at tinatalakay ang pagiging komplikado ng pagbubuntis at pagpapalaglag
Sunshine,5885,5,antonio_100,,,ltbx,"anyway ang ganda pala ni maris racal heheisa pa, napaka ignorante pero nag search ako at may nabasa akong blog about dun sa mga tindahan sa quiapo"

Sunshine,5886,1,mvnci,,180.0,ltbx,"Where Filipino films trend to historic dramas and at times big explosive bursts of emotion, Sunshine reflects the good and the ugly of Filipino society in the modern times"
Sunshine,5886,2,mvnci,,180.0,ltbx,"It is within the same type as the classics like Maynila sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag, but where it could've easily just copied that same old formula of poverty, crime, and the ugliness that lies beneath the city, the film chooses to explore controversial topics at its heart and anchors it toward really good character dynamics, not to mention where other films center around a male character from the rural side or from the slums, we instead focus on a lady who is faced with a great moral dilemma (in the Filipino perspective, you'll get it) when her dreams are on the verge of being stripped away from her"
Sunshine,5886,3,mvnci,,180.0,ltbx,"While watching, I sometimes forget that it is a Filipino film (not to sound derogatory or self-hating btw) because it strays away from tired old cliches other Filipino films do, and while the blueprints of those tropes are present, they are presented in a light that feels more subdued than its usual contemporaries"
Sunshine,5886,4,mvnci,,180.0,ltbx,"Also, I do love how the film does respect the audience in choosing not to explain certain things, letting us fill in the gaps"
Sunshine,5886,5,mvnci,,180.0,ltbx,"It's a great watch, in my opinion"
Sunshine,5886,6,mvnci,,180.0,ltbx,"And I feel that this film should be at the helm of some sort of renaissance for Philippine cinema, where we aren't afraid to speak out and be bold while also making great art out of it"

Sunshine,5930,6,jujuwuuu,,200.0,ltbx,"God this made me cry a ton of times, may it be from anger, sadness, and in the end thankfully, from happiness & proudness"
Sunshine,5930,7,jujuwuuu,,200.0,ltbx,"Ilang beses ko inulit yung ending because of the dialogue i quoted, but during that moment, bumuhos lang talaga yung luha ko, i cried with and for Sunshine"
Sunshine,5930,8,jujuwuuu,,200.0,ltbx,"Sunshine, my sweet girl, you are so brave i fucking love you and im so proud of you"
Sunshine,5930,9,jujuwuuu,,200.0,ltbx,"The film itself is so fucking brave in showcasing these fucked up prevalent “taboo” issues in this godforsaken country, all overshadowed by fucked up hypocrites, fucked up men, fucked up families, fucked up conservatism, fucked up systems, fucked up government, and the fucked up overt control and chokehold of “religion”"
Sunshine,5930,10,jujuwuuu,,200.0,ltbx,"Tbh that’s not all, THE LIST GOES ON"
Sunshine,5930,11,jujuwuuu,,200.0,ltbx,All these beliefs and what do you get
Sunshine,5930,12,jujuwuuu,,200.0,ltbx,A closed off skull that’s for sure
Sunshine,5930,13,jujuwuuu,,200.0,ltbx,"I know damn well that a lot of conservatives might refuse to watch this, stop midway, or carry prejudice over empathy while watching the film"
Sunshine,5930,14,jujuwuuu,,200.0,ltbx,"But I still have a sliver of hope that maybe, ma gets din nila"
Sunshine,5930,15,jujuwuuu,,200.0,ltbx,"Big appreciation for Maris and Jennica, they did the film justice and they are just so natural on screen"
Sunshine,5930,16,jujuwuuu,,200.0,ltbx,They kids did an amazing job too
Sunshine,5931,1,veryradgirll,,200.0,ltbx,galing tangina
Sunshine,5933,1,unliverse,,180.0,ltbx,the way this film literally said the best thing you could do for your future child is not make them exist
Sunshine,5933,2,unliverse,,180.0,ltbx,"not in this lifetime, at least"
Sunshine,5933,3,unliverse,,180.0,ltbx,"and especially not under a sky-high capitalist, patriarchal pro max hellscape"

Sunshine,5938,1,jamansoju,,160.0,ltbx,tangina ng mga lalaki
Sunshine,5939,1,monamona_31,,180.0,ltbx,It’s a great movie
Sunshine,5939,2,monamona_31,,180.0,ltbx,It dives well into the reality of some women and the heavy choices they have to make
Sunshine,5939,3,monamona_31,,180.0,ltbx,"A little spoiler: I really like how they were able to let us see the experiences of women, including young girls, who are abused and forced to take on a weighty responsibility just because choosing themselves is wrong in some people’s eyes, even if they didn’t want what’s happening to them in the first place"
Sunshine,5939,4,monamona_31,,180.0,ltbx,"Some experience it as the consequences of their actions, but this movie also gives up a glimpse of those who are oppressed and have nowhere to go"
Sunshine,5939,5,monamona_31,,180.0,ltbx,We also see the current situations of places like hospitals
Sunshine,5939,6,monamona_31,,180.0,ltbx,It’s a good way to raise awareness about the issue being tackled in this movie
Sunshine,5939,7,monamona_31,,180.0,ltbx,Very eye-opening and inspiring

Sunshine,5950,3,istephaneaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"Gets ko naGets ko na, okay lang kung at the end of the day mas piliin mo ang sarili mo, ang desisyon mo, o ang pangarap mo dahil karapatan mo 'yan"
Sunshine,5950,4,istephaneaaa,,200.0,ltbx,"I just bawled my eyes, protect women at all cost"
Sunshine,5950,5,istephaneaaa,,200.0,ltbx,I am proud to say that sunshine has become one of my top 10 women in films
Sunshine,5951,1,ejcigs,,200.0,ltbx,no government or religion should tell a woman what to do with her body—it’s hers
Sunshine,5951,2,ejcigs,,200.0,ltbx,not ours
Sunshine,5951,3,ejcigs,,200.0,ltbx,not yours
Sunshine,5951,4,ejcigs,,200.0,ltbx,not anyone’s
Sunshine,5952,1,sinshims,,200.0,ltbx,Gets na gets
Sunshine,5952,2,sinshims,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa huli, ako lamang ang may kapangyahiran magdesisyon para sa aking sarili"
Sunshine,5952,3,sinshims,,200.0,ltbx,"Salamat, Sunshine"
Sunshine,5953,1,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,definitely direk antoinette’s best work so far
Sunshine,5953,2,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,"simula pa lang, damang-dama ko na si sunshine"
Sunshine,5953,3,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,"lahat ng naramdaman niya—yung takot, galit, inis, lungkot…tumatama sakin"
Sunshine,5953,4,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,"kahit na gets ko agad yung role ni annika, i didn’t expect that surge of emotions sa dulo"
Sunshine,5953,5,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,"as much as i am pro-choice, hindi talaga mawawala yung catholic guilt"
Sunshine,5953,6,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,"and aside from that, ewan ko if ako lang, pero ramdam ko rin na in some way may fondness si sunshine sa bata"
Sunshine,5953,7,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,"maybe it’s something mothers feel, even yung muntikan na, or baka kasi babae tayo"
Sunshine,5953,8,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,"tbh, parang hinuhulaan ko na yung mga susunod na mangyayari (ganun ako sa lahat ng movies ;-;), pero nagulat pa rin ako dito"
Sunshine,5953,9,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,"damang-dama ko yung pagkababae ko rito, parang universal feeling for women ganun"
Sunshine,5953,10,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,"kita ko sarili ko hindi lang kay sunshine, pero pati sa ate niya, bff niya, si menggay, yung doktora, yung ate sa pharmacy, yung coach niya"
Sunshine,5953,11,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,hayyy naluluha pa rin ako kapag iniisip ko to HAHAHA
Sunshine,5953,12,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,pansin na pansin ko rin na talagang englishera si annika HAHAHA
Sunshine,5953,13,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,"iniisip ko parang hindi swak, but i remembered na englishero yung tatay niya (character ni elijah)"
Sunshine,5953,14,reeyel,,200.0,ltbx,idk if on purpose ba na englishero si elijah to match annika or the other way around HAHAHA
Sunshine,5954,1,eluvschaee,,180.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
Sunshine,5955,1,arva_lol,,200.0,ltbx,the small detail sa jeep na “Gift of God” kahit problemado na si sunshine lewl
Sunshine,5956,1,japschae,,,ltbx,this film stayed with me
Sunshine,5956,2,japschae,,,ltbx,"raw, quiet, tapang na hindi sumisigaw pero tumatagos"
Sunshine,5956,3,japschae,,,ltbx,unang-una: Maris Racal
Sunshine,5956,4,japschae,,,ltbx,hindi lang nag-portray — she became Sunshine
Sunshine,5956,5,japschae,,,ltbx,"yung pagod, yung takot, yung pagka-desperate pero umaasa pa rin… ramdam mo hanggang buto"
Sunshine,5956,6,japschae,,,ltbx,"this is the face of so many young women na araw-araw lumalaban in a country that tells them what to be, what to do, and what to carry"
Sunshine,5956,7,japschae,,,ltbx,"ang ganda ng pagkakahuli sa Manila — yung sikip, yung init, yung ingay, pati yung bigat na hindi mo maipaliwanag"
Sunshine,5956,8,japschae,,,ltbx,hindi siya romanticized; totoo lang
Sunshine,5956,9,japschae,,,ltbx,yung Quiapo scenes
Sunshine,5956,10,japschae,,,ltbx,sobrang accurate na parang naamoy mo na yung alinsangan at dasal at pag-asa ng mga taong dumadaan dito para humanap ng solusyon sa problema na hindi sila binibigyan ng choice
Sunshine,5956,11,japschae,,,ltbx,and that’s the heart of the film: choice
Sunshine,5956,12,japschae,,,ltbx,or the lack of it
Sunshine,5956,13,japschae,,,ltbx,"bilang kababaihan, ang hirap pag-usapan ng reproductive rights dito sa Pilipinas kasi every conversation is haunted by guilt, religion, and judgment"
Sunshine,5956,14,japschae,,,ltbx,"pero Sunshine manages to hold that tension — yung guilt, yung fear, yung what-if — without punishing the woman at the center of it"
Sunshine,5956,15,japschae,,,ltbx,this isn’t just a film — it’s a mirror
Sunshine,5956,16,japschae,,,ltbx,"it asks questions na hindi madali, and refuses to hold your hand para bigyan ka ng sagot"
Sunshine,5956,17,japschae,,,ltbx,it lets you sit with discomfort
Sunshine,5956,18,japschae,,,ltbx,"it lets you ask yourself: kung hindi ikaw ang nasa sitwasyon, bakit ikaw ang magdedesisyon"
Sunshine,5957,1,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,What will you do if your dream is at stake because of one mistake
Sunshine,5957,2,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine delivers a powerful message about reproductive rights and the need for access to safe and legal abortion
Sunshine,5957,3,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,"The film shows the current state of healthcare in the Philippines and how this basic necessity has become inaccessible, especially to those living below the poverty line"
Sunshine,5957,4,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,I like how the film does not romanticize the societal issue of unwanted pregnancy
Sunshine,5957,5,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,"Instead, it highlights how stigma deeply affects women’s decision-making about their own bodies"
Sunshine,5957,6,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,It shows how the main character struggles with an internal conflict and debates with her own conscience
Sunshine,5957,7,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,"While the film clearly presents why abortion should be legalized and recognized as part of healthcare in the Philippines, it also portrays how religion and health often clash"
Sunshine,5957,8,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,It is true that our country is still in the process of accepting that abortion is a right that should be available to all women
Sunshine,5957,9,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,"Some might argue that safe sex is the only way to avoid these situations, but we cannot ignore the fact that many women experience sexual abuse, rape, or non-consensual ejaculation during intercourse"
Sunshine,5957,10,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,Sunshine is not just a film that explains why safe abortion should be legalized; it calls our attention to consider the issue without guilt-tripping women through religion or societal pressure
Sunshine,5957,11,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,Women should have the freedom to decide what to do with their own bodies
Sunshine,5957,12,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,Marriage or co-parenting should not be treated as a band-aid solution to a lifelong responsibility
Sunshine,5957,13,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,"These solutions do not apply to everyone, especially to those who do not have the means to support a child"
Sunshine,5957,14,jmosatalla14,,160.0,ltbx,"I know we all have different perspectives on this issue, but thinking long-term about the future of our children depends on how ready we truly are to take on this responsibility"
Sunshine,5958,1,neia,,160.0,ltbx,"Hindi talaga ako binibigo ni direk Jadaone kapag usapang isyu, pakikipagsapalaran, at boses ng kababaihan"
Sunshine,5958,2,neia,,160.0,ltbx,Kuhang-kuha rin ang realidad ng Maynila (bigla kong naalala ang Maynila sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag [1975])
Sunshine,5958,3,neia,,160.0,ltbx,Mabuhay ka direk Jadaone
Sunshine,5959,1,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,Love how the film depicts the harsh reality of what women have to go through just to be able to decide for themselves and their BODIES
Sunshine,5959,2,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,This movie really goes to show how making abortion illegal makes it so much harder and dangerous for women
Sunshine,5959,3,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,It does not sanctify the value of life since in the first place the life of the woman is endangered
Sunshine,5959,4,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"Moreover, I love how Manila gets depicted in this light, it shows the good and bad that comes with the city"
Sunshine,5959,5,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"It is bad for obvious reasons, the normalized chaos that is happening around it, how every night Sunshine is there, a mayhem ensues"
Sunshine,5959,6,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"However, I appreciate how Manila became a sanctuary place for her, where we can see how despite the chaos that happens every night, there are bits of humanity that saves her"
Sunshine,5959,7,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"The girl dun sa hotel, yung tricycle driver, and the 13-year-old girl that she met"
Sunshine,5959,8,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"Furthermore, I would like to commend the addition of having childrens act as her conscience or the ""what if child of hers"""
Sunshine,5959,9,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"It's a great addition because we can see how in the beginning of the film the girl was literally shouting ""murderer"" over and over again because in her perspective, her mother is harming her"
Sunshine,5959,10,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"But in the end when she said ""gets ko na"", it became a cathartic scene as it finally hits us that it isn't about being irresponsible and selfish ---- rather it is something more than that"
Sunshine,5959,11,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,The whole line of the girl saying to her friend Ariana that her dream is the same as Sunshine's is a great addition because I think it rings true with reality
Sunshine,5959,12,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"As every now and then, when a child hears about the dreams of their parents and how they had to stop it to take care of their children, especially when it comes to Mothers, the child often feels bad and just wished that thier Mom was able to live out their dream first"
Sunshine,5959,13,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"Lastly, I love the relationship of sunshine and her older sister, the fact that never once pinagalitan o diniktahan ng ate nya sa kung paano nya haharapin yung sitwasyon niya goes to show how much she trusts and love Sunshine"
Sunshine,5959,14,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"I also love the contrast that all throughout the film there were different sides of the story whether labelling her as a ""murderer"" o miggy telling her to do what you got to do that once you reached the end scene when her sister just told her ""kahit ano maging desisyon mo kampi lang ako sayo"" made it soo impactful"
Sunshine,5959,15,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"Kase in the end yun lang naman ang kailangan niyang marinig, we have seen her face through that circumstance alone with nothing but her conscience, that the moment na sinabi sa kanya yun, it became a relief to her as well as allowed her to finally tell someone or at least cried it out to them na natatakot din siya kase nga bata din siyaa and hindi pa siya ready maging nanay"
Sunshine,5959,16,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"All in all, the film was a 10 out of 10, and I appreciate how the film wasn't all in the face about what you should believe in and what you shouldn't"
Sunshine,5959,17,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,"It just presents Sunshine's story and her decision which should be acknowledged because hindi dapat humantong sa isang sitwasyon na mas uunahin pa ng isang doktor ang kaniyang lisensya kesa sa buhay ng isang tao dahil lang ""nagpalaglag"" siya"
Sunshine,5959,18,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,If you really value life in its essence then we should also acknowledge the life of the person carrying the baby so bakit niyo papabayaan lang na mamatay yung batang 13-year-old
Sunshine,5959,19,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,so in conclusion:TANGINAA NG MGA LALAKETANGINA MO MIGGYTANGINA NUNG DOKTORATANGINA NUNG LALAKING DOKTORTANGINA NUNG TITO TANGNIA NUNG WALANG KWENTANG NANAY (
Sunshine,5959,20,cas_siana,,200.0,ltbx,) - di nya deserve matawag na nanay
Sunshine,5960,1,v00mi3,,,ltbx,Protect my women
Sunshine,5961,1,cherrypiee_,,180.0,ltbx,"The film confronts subjects that society often treats as shameful or off-limits, maybe uncomfortable or looked down on, and yet still managed to portray it all so well"
Sunshine,5961,2,cherrypiee_,,180.0,ltbx,I’m really glad topics like these are being brought up more in film
Sunshine,5962,1,tapsiyosi,,160.0,ltbx,“gets ko na”
Sunshine,5963,1,_jean,,140.0,ltbx,"sunshine (maris) im on your side it's sad how sunshine and girls like sunshine get exploited on top of so many other things they have to deal with in a religious, conservative and judgmental, capitalist society"
Sunshine,5963,3,_jean,,140.0,ltbx,the sick religiosity that permeates every level of filipino society is SICKENING
Sunshine,5963,4,_jean,,140.0,ltbx,i want girls to be protected and safe and supported and happy
Sunshine,5964,1,sensonya,,200.0,ltbx,The best the fuck
Sunshine,5964,2,sensonya,,200.0,ltbx,FINALLY FILM THAT SCREAMS WOMAN
Sunshine,5965,1,sobtitles,,200.0,ltbx,this film had me staring off into space afterward
Sunshine,5966,1,anjeni,,160.0,ltbx,to be a woman is to perform talaga
Sunshine,5966,2,anjeni,,160.0,ltbx,"kahit ilang dekada na ang nakakalipas, patuloy pa rin natin nilalabanan ang taboo of abortion sa pilipinas"
Sunshine,5966,3,anjeni,,160.0,ltbx,"i’d say aside from the way they tackled the topics of unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion practices with so much empathy and care, this film is very realistic bc every man in it is a villain"
Sunshine,5967,1,larraylarray,,200.0,ltbx,I FUCKING HATE ALL THE MEN THAT SPOKE IN THIS FILM
Sunshine,5968,1,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is easily one of the best films i have seen in a while
Sunshine,5968,2,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,The film depicts the reality that many women experiences
Sunshine,5968,3,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,"In a country like ours, where religion holds so much influence, making this film is such a courageous decision"
Sunshine,5968,4,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,Filipinos tend to be religious but their actions contradict the values they claim uphold
Sunshine,5968,5,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,It’s about time we normalize conversations abortion and sex education
Sunshine,5968,6,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,How many more women will go through what sunshine went through
Sunshine,5968,7,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,Women should not be forced into motherhood because not all of us are made to be a mother
Sunshine,5968,8,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,Every women deserves the rights to decide and to be seen
Sunshine,5968,9,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,Sunshine is such a beautiful film
Sunshine,5968,10,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,It’s very raw which makes it easy to connect with the audience especially with women
Sunshine,5968,11,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,"To all the sunshines out there: you are heard, and you are seen"
Sunshine,5968,12,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,Your voice matter
Sunshine,5968,13,earaclaire,,200.0,ltbx,"Pangarap ko rin ang mga pangarap mo, Sunshine:)"
Sunshine,5969,1,tilaluha,,200.0,ltbx,"""yung pangarap ko, kung anong pangarap niya"
Sunshine,5969,2,tilaluha,,200.0,ltbx,""" and really, that's the entire point, isn't it"
Sunshine,5970,1,gaile,,140.0,ltbx,while watching naalala ko sinasabi ni sir lau na parang dinadaanan lang ni maris ang maynila instead of interacting with it and ykw i see it  kumbaga tinarato lang ng pelikula ang manila na ‘prop’ imbes na isang karakter
Sunshine,5970,2,gaile,,140.0,ltbx,and i’m aware that i’m looking for something that wasn’t in the film pero missed opportunity talaga na ipakita ang manila bilang isang living and breathing city
Sunshine,5970,3,gaile,,140.0,ltbx,Gets ba
Sunshine,5970,4,gaile,,140.0,ltbx,and one thing though
Sunshine,5970,5,gaile,,140.0,ltbx,the acting in this film is SO fawking good
Sunshine,5970,6,gaile,,140.0,ltbx,especially kay maris  super galing ng microexpressions Ugh lalo na yung scene where she was convincing her coach na hindi siya buntis
Sunshine,5970,7,gaile,,140.0,ltbx,Siper galing at ang realistic lang
Sunshine,5970,8,gaile,,140.0,ltbx,kita na agad na natatakot pero nagpipilit na magmukhang matapang
Sunshine,5970,9,gaile,,140.0,ltbx,ALSO JENNICA GARCIA
Sunshine,5970,10,gaile,,140.0,ltbx,"So good pero super love how di talaga nagwaver si sunshine sa ayaw niya na maging nanay  even the church scenes didn’t consist of her asking for guidance in her decision, it was her asking for forgiveness likee"
Sunshine,5971,1,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,"First of all, ang galing talaga ni Maris Racal umacting"
Sunshine,5971,2,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,Gets ko naGets din kita
Sunshine,5971,3,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,Nakakainis 'yung unang doctor (pero I know it reflects the prolifer's take on this kind of issue haha)
Sunshine,5971,4,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,Nung una nainis din ako kay xyril pero mabuti na kang may character development sya
Sunshine,5971,5,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,"Napaisil ako, if ever sa friend ko mangyayari yung ganitong bagay, I know for sure na hindi ako maghehesitate to help her"
Sunshine,5971,6,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,"I almost cried sa part ni Rhed, grabe talaga"
Sunshine,5971,7,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,"Napakairesponsable nung parents n'ya, and to think na 13 years old pa lang s'ya"
Sunshine,5971,8,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,Sobrang nakakapanlumo dahil nangyayare talaga 'to sa totoong buhay
Sunshine,5971,9,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,Medyo nadamihan lang ako sa part andaming mura (siguro ginawa 'yun para mas magmukhang natural
Sunshine,5971,10,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,"Pero somehow medyo na oa-han ako) Also, ginawang tao si anika and aryunuh with feelings and such, and pinakita pa dun na parang gustong mabuhay ni Aryunuh, wala parang medyo contradicting lang yung part na yun, I think unnecessary na 'yung character ni Aryunuh since nagbigay life lang 'to sa fetus sa tiyan ni Rhed"
Sunshine,5971,11,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,"I like the ending, akala ko nung una hindi matutuloy dahil nga sa sistema dito sa PH"
Sunshine,5971,12,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,"Add ko na din, bakit ba kasi hindi nagk-condom si Elijah Canlas hahahah"

Sunshine,5971,14,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,"Simple lang yung movie, and gets ko bakit nga ba controversial"
Sunshine,5971,15,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,I think kulang or hind na explore pa 'yung other reasons bakit need I legalize ang abortion to convince the public
Sunshine,5971,16,andreakellyw,,180.0,ltbx,"Pero maganda talaga, fr"

Sunshine,5977,3,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,I have never rooted for anyone so much to get rid of that damn baby
Sunshine,5977,4,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,"The movie also shows the darkest sides of the healthcare system in the Philippines, religion, and most of all, fucking men"
Sunshine,5977,5,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,It is unfortunate that us Filipina women have it the fucking worst
Sunshine,5977,6,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,"Not only are we in a third world country where it is illegal to abort, but we are guilt tripped over and over again by society to not choose ourselves"
Sunshine,5977,7,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,We are literal machines for them to procreate and forget ourselves in the process
Sunshine,5977,8,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,We are not human to them
Sunshine,5977,9,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,Right from the get-go it is shown how unprepared (who I assumed is 20) 20 year old Sunshine is
Sunshine,5977,10,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,"Even when she is cleaning up her sister’s child, she raises her hand as if to scare the child, when the child clearly does not understand this gesture"
Sunshine,5977,11,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,"The men in this film are shown to be no help at all, may it be sibling, the boyfriend, the men in the streets, every"
Sunshine,5977,14,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,"The concept of birthing a child will never be their problem, it will never even cross their minds"
Sunshine,5977,15,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,"I love how realistic the scenes were when all the pregnant were all together, aiding each other and comforting each other; that is the harsh truth— men will never know the connection us women have with one another"
Sunshine,5977,16,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,Even if they are strangers
Sunshine,5977,17,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,Rhed (Mary Grace) is the exact reason why abortion should be legalized in the Philippines
Sunshine,5977,18,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,Young women subject themselves to improper medical procedures because that’s all they have access to (and hardly)— they do not know the severity of what their bodies will go through
Sunshine,5977,19,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,"In the first place, sex education is still frowned upon in the Philippines"
Sunshine,5977,20,jystique,,200.0,ltbx,"God, I really hate, HATE how religion proves time and time again that they are the main reason why we cannot progress as a society"

Sunshine,5984,2,butt3rpopcorn,,160.0,ltbx,Women shouldn’t have to trade one for the other
Sunshine,5984,3,butt3rpopcorn,,160.0,ltbx,"This film shines light on this truth—understanding that every woman deserves the freedom to choose what’s right for her, and the autonomy to decide the path her life will take"
Sunshine,5984,4,butt3rpopcorn,,160.0,ltbx,Such a beautiful and inspiring watch
Sunshine,5984,5,butt3rpopcorn,,160.0,ltbx,"I hope more people watch it, and allow its message to open hearts, challenge norms, and spark understanding for women like Sunshine"
Sunshine,5985,1,whymary,,160.0,ltbx,"Holds so much meaning about womanhood during different stages of life, especially for those living in a country in which unplanned pregnancy is a death sentence"
Sunshine,5985,2,whymary,,160.0,ltbx,"The backwards system that gets perpetuated by bigots like a couple of doctors that Sunshine meets is heavily stacked against women, but the movie shows us how having a choice can save our lives"
Sunshine,5985,3,whymary,,160.0,ltbx,There's surrealism in the movie too but it's very much deeply rooted in reality

Sunshine,5986,5,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,This film struck a deep chord with me
Sunshine,5986,6,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,"Nearly every scene felt like it could happen in real life—and in many cases, it truly does"
Sunshine,5986,7,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,Abortion is treated like a sin in this godforsaken conservative and dominantly Catholic country
Sunshine,5986,8,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,"Many people disagree, but it really doesn’t matter whether you agree or not"
Sunshine,5986,9,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,"In the end, the decision should be up to the woman who’s pregnant"
Sunshine,5986,10,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,We shouldn’t have an opinion—just understanding is enough
Sunshine,5986,11,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,"After all, it's her body, her life, her future, her choice"
Sunshine,5986,12,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,That's why I'll always firmly believe that abortion should be legal and safe
Sunshine,5986,13,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,"There are women—and even girls—who are far too young, forced into pregnancy, still unstable, still trying to build their own lives, and completely unprepared to raise a child while chasing their dreams"
Sunshine,5986,14,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,"Abortion is healthcare, and access to it is a basic reproductive right"
Sunshine,5986,15,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,This film captures that reality so loudly
Sunshine,5986,16,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,"It’s loud with the streets of Manila, with people’s judgment, with hypocrisy"
Sunshine,5986,17,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,"You can hear it all so clearly—the way society pushes women toward unreliable and dangerous methods like pamparegla in Quiapo or hilot, simply because abortion is condemned and proper reproductive healthcare is lacking"
Sunshine,5986,18,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,It’s so fucked up and heartbreaking
Sunshine,5986,19,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,"Tangina, ang hirap-hirap maging babae sa bansang ’to—sa mundong ’to"
Sunshine,5986,20,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,'Yung scene na walang filter na ipinakita ang estado ng public hospitals—mga serbisyong galing sa buwis ng tao pero hindi nila kayang ayusin—sobrang sakit panoorin
Sunshine,5986,21,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,Sobrang bulok ng sistema natin
Sunshine,5986,22,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,And there’s probably something even worse behind it—we are so fucked
Sunshine,5986,23,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,"So when Sunshine finally went through with the abortion, I felt relieved"
Sunshine,5986,24,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,"For a moment, I was scared she might keep the baby"
Sunshine,5986,25,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,Bringing a child into the world when you’re not ready—and being forced to give up your own dreams because of it—is one of the most cruel things you can do to yourself and to that child
Sunshine,5986,26,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,And that’s exactly why choice matters
Sunshine,5986,27,riysch,,200.0,ltbx,Gets ko na

Sunshine,6002,3,ruel_,,160.0,ltbx,One of the film’s most harrowing moments is the scene where Sunshine rescues Mary Grace after she nearly dies from a self-induced abortion

Sunshine,6007,2,lowbitrae,,200.0,ltbx,"I was gonna leave it there but I have thoughts so full steam ahead—Manila is a staple in almost every Filipino film, being the capital and all, but rather than the large city itself— Sunshine specifically captures the essence of Quiapo so well"
Sunshine,6007,3,lowbitrae,,200.0,ltbx,"The bustling markets, the overcrowd and kids begging for alms, and religion is embedded everywhere— whether it be its churches, the posters within the buildings, street stalls selling rebultos and rosaries, or the people themselves"
Sunshine,6007,4,lowbitrae,,200.0,ltbx,"I don't usually care for the setting of the story but I always think it's smart when it actually helps drive the narrative forward, so I find this neat little aspect of the film amusing (also, while we're at it, props to whoever the prod designer is wow)"
Sunshine,6007,5,lowbitrae,,200.0,ltbx,"I watched this at 3AM during a vigil so I had all the time to read other reviews and can I just say, while I understand how it could be viewed as such— I don't think this film was didactic or propaganda"
Sunshine,6007,6,lowbitrae,,200.0,ltbx,"I love films that open conversations and Sunshine opened a lot, but more than the conversations it opened, I love how the center of it has always been women"
Sunshine,6007,7,lowbitrae,,200.0,ltbx,"The heart of Sunshine is Sunshine herself, and Maris Racal definitely gave the performance of a lifetime in this one"
Sunshine,6007,8,lowbitrae,,200.0,ltbx,"The fact that she filmed this the same time as Can't Buy Me Love is insane, talk about range"

Sunshine,6084,26,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,"Honestly, with how close they were i was really surprised that sunshine never told her"
Sunshine,6084,27,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,all of their scenes were just so heart warming and it really just felt so comforting
Sunshine,6084,28,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,i feel like she was someone that sunshine really needed at the time and yknow those words probably meant so much to sunshine
Sunshine,6084,29,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,"i got a little teary eyed during that scene cuz it was just so next, the doctora"
Sunshine,6084,30,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,notice how it was a woman who risked her lisence and did everything to save the pregnant girl
Sunshine,6084,31,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,"yeah, thats what i call girlhood  but yeah, i was just so happy that someone, an actual stranger, reached out a helping hand"
Sunshine,6084,32,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,"even though she had very little screentime, i really enjoyed her character and it really just showed that there are still some good people out there"
Sunshine,6084,33,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,"moving on, we have the pregnant girl"
Sunshine,6084,34,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,her hug with sunshine absolutely made me cry
Sunshine,6084,35,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,"idk, maybe seeing someone going through the same things as her just brought some comfort like atleast theyre both in this together"
Sunshine,6084,36,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,"her almost dying made me feel something, it was either goosebumps or just deadass misery"
Sunshine,6084,37,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,i guess a HM would be the coach
Sunshine,6084,38,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,"(no i am not mentioning the kid cry about it )overall, this was such a beautiful movie"
Sunshine,6084,39,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,i felt everything and it just captured the life of a filipina so well
Sunshine,6084,40,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,just shows how much one person could be going through and how much a woman has to do to simply get rid of her baby
Sunshine,6084,41,beaatootie,,200.0,ltbx,def watch this if you have time
Sunshine,6085,1,xoxokei,,200.0,ltbx,"second watch, naiyak pa rin ako sa last performance ni sunshine HUHU GANON SIYA KAGALING"
Sunshine,6085,2,xoxokei,,200.0,ltbx,ramdam na ramdam yung pagmamahal niya sa ginagawa niya

Sunshine,6088,1,aeriesque,,200.0,ltbx,it hits harder the second time
Sunshine,6088,2,aeriesque,,200.0,ltbx,GETS NA GETS KO NA (watched it with mom)
Sunshine,6089,1,nechocheese,,200.0,ltbx,Its interesting how we yet blame a woman for everything and say nothing about man's actions
Sunshine,6089,2,nechocheese,,200.0,ltbx,"This reminds me of the Barbie movie especially that one line""it is literally impossible to be a woman"""
Sunshine,6090,1,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,this was so realistic
Sunshine,6090,2,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,and also so realistic in showing how fucked up the system in our country really is
Sunshine,6090,3,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,"people say things like ""paano kung 'yan yung maging susunod na president"
Sunshine,6090,4,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,""", ""paano kung 'yan yung makahanap ng cure sa ganito gan'yan"
Sunshine,6090,5,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,""" when talking about a fetus that might be aborted, when those questions should honestly be applied more about kids who were forced to live a messed up system that was also because of adults, just like yung kay mary grace"
Sunshine,6090,6,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,her case happens a lot in real life
Sunshine,6090,7,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,many children as young as 13 are forced to be pregnant and become mothers
Sunshine,6090,8,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,"like imagine, a 13 year old"
Sunshine,6090,9,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,that's a kid
Sunshine,6090,10,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,"anddd hindi ko rin talaga magegets (and never will, honestly) yung mga tao na hindi pro-choice who doesn't care if pregnancy happened because of rape"
Sunshine,6090,11,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,tangina niyo
Sunshine,6090,12,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,"another thing, dahil nga illegal pa ang abortion in the philippines, a lot of kababaihan would resort to ""pangpa-regla"" and other unsafe procedures para lang makapag-abort"
Sunshine,6090,13,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,"if the healthcare system truly cares about the people, why prioritize the ""life"" of a fetus, imbis na sa taong buhay and humihinga na"
Sunshine,6090,14,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,bakit kailangan pa silang maghirap
Sunshine,6090,15,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,and i like annika's character here also symbolizing sunshine's guilt
Sunshine,6090,16,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,"kahit na parang desidido na talaga si sunshine noong una pa na she wouldn't keep the baby, there still lingers a feeling of guilt inside her, yunv parehong religious and personal guilt"
Sunshine,6090,17,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,"and yung sa last part, her saying na ""gets ko na"""
Sunshine,6090,18,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,"ay, putangina, i love it"
Sunshine,6090,19,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,"i really hope this movie would serve as an eye opener sa bansang 'to rsgarding abortion, and i also hope that people become more open-minded"
Sunshine,6090,20,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,sana maging legal na ang abortion
Sunshine,6090,21,kingrinamo,,200.0,ltbx,"hay, tangina kayo"

Sunshine,6091,2,hannismovie,,200.0,ltbx,"Sometimes I fail to remember how Philippines such as other countries, do not have the same privilege as first world countries do"
Sunshine,6091,3,hannismovie,,200.0,ltbx,"Imagine the first thing someone says to you after you almost die from trying to have an abortion “Say sorry to God, be thankful He is forgiving"
Sunshine,6091,4,hannismovie,,200.0,ltbx,Be thankful that your child is still here
Sunshine,6091,5,hannismovie,,200.0,ltbx,” Women shouldn’t have to feel guilt or religious pressure to have a baby they didn’t want
Sunshine,6091,6,hannismovie,,200.0,ltbx,"It should always be their choice, their right to their own body"
Sunshine,6091,7,hannismovie,,200.0,ltbx,"I hope one day that the Philippines legalises abortion, it’s healthcare after all"

Sunshine,6096,1,deedeedot,,200.0,ltbx,"If your moral values believe that no child should be aborted, sana kasama rin sa values nyo na walang babaeng deserved na mahirapan dahil sa unwanted pregnancy"
Sunshine,6096,2,deedeedot,,200.0,ltbx,"Women needs to have choice, if we always shame women na nabuntis, bakit hindi natin ibaling sa mga nakabuntis ang sisi"
Sunshine,6096,3,deedeedot,,200.0,ltbx,"Sa buong panonood ko, nainis ako kay Elijah Canlas, sa nanay ni xyril, kay Piolo Pascual, dun sa nagtitinda ng pampalaglag, dun sa doctor na ayaw mag-admit ng batang naghihingalo dahil gumawa daw ng ilegal (mind you, narape yan kaya sya buntis), at sa ospital na hindi kayang i-cater ang pangangalaga sa mga kababaihan"
Sunshine,6096,4,deedeedot,,200.0,ltbx,"Sana imbes na ijudge si sunshine sa choices nya, sana namulat tayong lahat na we should be free of our choices"
Sunshine,6096,5,deedeedot,,200.0,ltbx,Na hindi tayo selfish dahil lang ayaw natin ng anak
Sunshine,6096,6,deedeedot,,200.0,ltbx,And that we are entitled to be taken care of kahit ano pang desisyon natin when it comes to our pregnancy
Sunshine,6096,7,deedeedot,,200.0,ltbx,"Sobrang lupit ng mundo natin, na patuloy na nagtataas ng kilay kapag tungkol sa SOGIE pero wala ring ginagawang hakbang kapag nagkakaroon ng unwanted pregnancy ang mga kababaihan"

Sunshine,6099,4,noctrne8,,180.0,ltbx,it’s horrifying to watch sunshine and the other girl struggle with unwanted pregnancy throughout the film
Sunshine,6099,5,noctrne8,,180.0,ltbx,"unjust laws, religion, traditional norms, and other people’s opinions should NOT be barriers to abortion"

Sunshine,6139,1,ikariestotle,,200.0,ltbx,"waited so long na maging available on digital 'yung movie na 'to and needless to say it was worth the wait because wtf ilang beses ako naiyak from the depiction pa lang ng daily life sa pinas, the customs and norms we have, to the imaginary children representing the ""could-have-beens"", and also in a way, the girls' own guilt following them with every decision they try to make for a common situation that girls—especially the young ones—suffer through here sa bansa na 'to (not just the pregnancy itself but also the internal battles that come with religious guilt and having dreams beyond what other people would call as ""a gift from God"")"
