145,7,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her works, which are reminiscent of the late Marilou Diaz-Abaya, albeit with a more modern flair, are always centered around fully fleshed-out female characters who, while at times flawed, go through a transformative journey (case in point: directing That Thing Called Tadhana, Beauty in a Bottle (2014), Never Not Love You (2018), Alone/Together (2019), and Fan Girl (2020))"
145,8,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And this latest one is no different

145,11,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Yet Jadaone successfully completed the film without sacrificing her vision
145,12,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film manages to bravely portray the burden brought by unwanted pregnancies to women while men get a free pass in this patriarchal society designed by and controlled by men
145,13,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It also paints how religious people can't help but keep shoving their beliefs on others instead of minding their own business
145,14,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Most importantly, the film discusses the importance of a proper health care system in a third-world country like ours, which is run by capitalism and corrupt government officials"
145,15,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Instead of providing safe and accessible procedures like safe abortion for women, we have a country forcing them to find unsafe means on their own, endangering their lives in the process"

145,21,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But the film will definitely not work if not for the career-best portrayal from its lead, Maris Racal, who delivers a tour-de-force performance as Sunshine herself"
145,22,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"One can really feel and see the dedication she had for such a demanding role, physically and emotionally"
145,23,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her performance really pulls you into the film and won't let go until the emotionally charged third act, making it one of the best local female performances I've seen this year so far"
145,24,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film also boasts some great visuals thanks to Pao Orendain's slick camerawork and incredible music courtesy of Rico Blanco—a first for the singer-songwriter
145,25,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Overall, this latest film from Antoinette Jadaone is one rollercoaster of emotions that is buoyed by a daring and electrifying performance from Maris Racal"
145,26,filmcirclerjct,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's a poignant, gripping and thought-provoking journey of a woman coming to terms with her own inner conflicts"

147,4,xpert_ninja,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Direk Tonet is on Fan Girl mode: things get quite tense and harrowing
148,1,alexyoken,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Claustrophobic, not just in how the frame is composed in several scenes, but in how it shows the extent in which the malignant structure of self-righteous patriarchal conservatism has done palpable harm to women and children everywhere"
148,2,alexyoken,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film uses its central plotline to weave a rich tapestry of people and places that paint a picture of how this corrupted structure affects the titular protagonist, as well as the people around her"
148,3,alexyoken,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The tone possesses a gradually ratcheting anger at the oppressive status quo, going for the throats of its targets with at times bleak satire, or crushing nightmarish realities"
148,4,alexyoken,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This indignation, however, is ultimately fueled out of immense compassion"
148,5,alexyoken,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film never really downs itself in hopelessness as it actively claws for hope, and never loses sight of Sunshine's agency through it all"
148,6,alexyoken,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal's humane, scrappy performance is the total anchor of this film, carrying the heaviness with determination impressively"
148,7,alexyoken,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Although the breadth of the screenplay's scope is the film's biggest strength, there is some messiness in terms of scene-by-scene progression, and the more metaphorical/allegorical stuff doesn't fully coalesce with the film's more tangible arcs"
148,8,alexyoken,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Still, its willingness to take an approach both upfront and delicate to its central topic proves to be a burning, driving core towards a cathartic final endpoint"
148,9,alexyoken,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Meaningful, impassionate stuff"
149,1,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I am averse to making comparisons to Brocka, but here we are"

149,5,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This is a nation of bad decisions, especially when it comes to the plight of young women"
149,6,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And she has to weave through these apathetic streets to find the kindness that exists in spite of the cruelty
149,7,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film uses a device that I found tenuous at points, though I do think it works out in the end"
149,8,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's just that the film is so good at depicting the casual reality of these characters and the city that surrounds them that I found the break from it a little distracting
149,9,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film is transcendent when it just shows us what this city is: a place where a churchyard is where you go to find abortion drugs, a city where a motel is hesitant to give you a room if you're alone, a place where a person charged with caring for you might also take it as an opportunity to shame you for your choices"
149,10,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At the heart of this is Maris Racal, who delivers what might be the performance of a lifetime"
149,11,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"A lot is asked of the young actress, who is made to mask the rage of generations of women and put on the facade of someone who is pretending that all this will pass without incident"
149,12,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It is sadness and worry, but also the prevailing need to show the world that everything is okay"
149,13,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She gets ample support from the rest of the cast, with Jennica Garcia in particular embodying the spirit of this film in its most crucial moments"
149,14,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There were several moments watching Sunshine where I find myself saying, ""yes"
149,15,philbertdy,2025-07-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,""" Yes, because I was agreeing with what the movie was saying"

155,1,emongpanty,2025-07-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Phenomenal drama that explores so many aspects of abortion and the various aspects of living in a deeply religious society where it is illegal
155,2,emongpanty,2025-07-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is truly astounding as the title character
156,1,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Cinemaster FJ Calvario says:In 2022, the government of Cuba had undertaken a bold move"
156,2,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It ratified a revision of its Family Code which redefined the “family”
156,3,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It was no longer defined by only biological ties but also by relationships based on love and mutual support
156,4,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"This revised code is a radical piece of legislation, expanding the rights of women and children and recognizing same-sex marriages and adoption"
156,5,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It is a watershed moment for a country once colonized by Catholic Spain whose religious policies defined what was and wasn't allowed in society
156,6,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"In another corner of the world, the government of the Philippines continues to enforce the same religious norms set by Spain"
156,7,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Unlike Cuba, the Philippines has a long road ahead of itself in dismantling colonial legacy"
156,8,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,A road perhaps may be paved by radical films such as Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine
156,9,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"A pioneer of the dialogue-driven hugot films of the 2010s, Jadaone is best known for her screenplays that blended comedy and romance"
156,10,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"However, beginning with 2020’s haunting thriller Fan Girl which tackled male idolatry in the Duterte era, she seems to be on a sociopolitical streak in her directorial efforts"
156,11,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Her latest drama Sunshine now examines a woman’s decision to abort her pregnancy in a country where it is illegal and heavily stigmatized by the influential Catholic Church
156,12,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"At the heart of the film is the eponymous protagonist Sunshine (played by Maris Racal), a gymnast who dreams to compete for the Olympics"
156,13,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,We first see Sunshine practice her routine in a stunningly directed scene showcasing well-paced editing and choreography
156,14,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The pulsating electronic score by Rico Blanco is the cherry on top
156,15,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,He embodies his inner Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who coincidentally scored another sports film released the same year as this one
156,16,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Her character’s Olympic ambitions remind me of the great women athletes in our country who have been making waves for their international achievements
156,17,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I see in her the Olympic gold-winning weightlifter Hidlyn Diaz and the Wimbledon-competing tennis player Alexa Eala
156,18,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,But this dream of Olympic glory and national pride may not be realized if Sunshine decides to continue her pregnancy
156,19,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"We spend much of the film following her as she navigates through her personal relationships with her family and friends, her boyfriend, her gymnastics coach, and a mysterious girl who questions her decision to abort"
156,20,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It’s quite a cast really
156,21,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Maris Racal makes the film as Sunshine; she plays her with steadfast determination
156,22,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Bubbling behind Racal's eyes is great fear and tragedy
156,23,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Xyriel Manabat does a lot with silent glances as Sunshine’s best friend Thea who begins to distance herself from her pregnant friend
156,24,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Elijah Canlas epitomizes the upper class douchebag as Miggy the boyfriend, frequently speaking in straight English and hilariously offloading responsibility to his girlfriend"
156,25,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Annika Co as the mysterious nagging girl manages to be cute, annoying, and threatening in the same scene (although her character’s inclusion in the film is questionable and counter-intuitive, well intentioned as it is)"
156,26,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Jadaone’s dense screenplay is riveting in its timeliness, empathy and boldness"
156,27,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The struggle of Sunshine in choosing between her career and an unwanted pregnancy recalls last year’s controversy around another athlete the Olympic gold winner Carlos Yulo who feuded with his mother over the latter’s misappropriation of his hard earned money
156,28,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The discourse around the Yulo issue saw the clashing of cultures, the divide between conservatives (who viewed the athlete as an ungrateful son) and progressives (who championed Carlos’s autonomy)"
156,29,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I expect the same discourse around Sunshine’s decision in choosing herself to unfold in Facebook comments sections once the film gets widely released in the country
156,30,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It takes a cold heart not to be moved by Sunshine’s struggle for bodily autonomy
156,31,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Jadaone situates her protagonist in the working class environs of Manila
156,32,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It is a landscape defined by neglect and economic difficulties
156,33,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Sunshine’s mother and father are nowhere to be seen, leaving only Sunshine and her siblings to fend for themselves"
156,34,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Sunshine meets a young girl who is also in need of money for her own abortion, having been raped by her own family member"
156,35,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Miggy refuses to share the burden of Sunshine’s pregnancy and keeps his distance
156,36,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Beyond her words, Jadaone’s images (courtesy of cinematographer Pao Orendain) strikingly capture urban oppression"
156,37,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"There is a great shot of Sunshine praying behind the grills of a church, visualizing the struggle between Catholic faith and personal freedom"
156,38,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"There’s another great shot where a lone Sunshine is again framed behind a window of a motel beside a train line, highlighting how isolating her struggle can be"
156,39,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Who would want to give birth to a child into a world of constant struggle amidst economic hardship and social stigma
156,40,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,The screenplay brilliantly reimagines what a family and society could be
156,41,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"In the place of a mother and a father, Sunshine has two mother figures: her sister Geleen (played by Jennica Garcia) and her coach Eden (played by Meryll Soriano)"
156,42,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Where other films would fixate on the familial tension between a parent and a child, this film is refreshingly optimistic in envisioning a family that supports and respects each other in their decisions, even with a decision as controversial as abortion"
156,43,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Sunshine’s supportive, orphaned family challenges the dominant Filipino imagination of the family (a father, a mother, and children)"
156,44,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,There is a wryly funny dialogue exchange in a Catholic hospital scene between Geleen and a conservative doctor where the former defends Sunshine by pointing out the doctor’s religious hypocrisy
156,45,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Jadaone’s screenplay beautifully emphasizes the solidarity between women
156,46,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Beyond interactions within her family, we see Sunshine helped by a kind doctor (played by Angeli Bayani) and, in turn, she helps a young pregnant girl (played by Rhed Bustamante)"
156,47,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Even in an unjust male-dominated world, the film shows hope in the kindness among women"
156,48,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I have read reviews comparing this film to works of Lino Brocka and Marilou Diaz-Abaya
156,49,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Perhaps, they are not far off"
156,50,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"What Jadaone achieves in this film is the start of an honest conversation about women’s bodily autonomy in our society, much like what Brocka and Abaya have done in their social dramas during the Second Golden Age of Philippine Cinema"
156,51,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Time will tell how impactful Sunshine will be on legislation regarding abortion and other aspects of women’s rights
156,52,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The Philippines, society and state, has a long way ahead to embrace progressive ideas, unlike for our fellow ex-Spanish colony Cuba"
156,53,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I suspect this film will trigger backlash among conservative audiences
156,54,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"God, imagine the online discourse and private message chains from concerned parents"
156,55,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,But I do hope that close minded people would be moved by a film as empathetic as Sunshine
156,56,upcinema,2025-07-05 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Watch Sunshine exclusively in SM Cinemas starting July 23
157,1,ceptune,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Very backlogged review but hey, to have a star such as Maris (who is great in this film) lead in a controversial topic in this day and age is a breath of fresh air"
157,2,ceptune,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone steps out of her comfort zone yet again to bring out one of her bolder works
157,3,ceptune,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I am happy that something like this is out there, don't get me wrong, but there is something so off and odd about representing their struggles with hallucinatory unborn children"

157,5,ceptune,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In the talkback, direk says that she was inspired by Jojo Rabbit with this style of narrative and I wish she went deeper in explaining her reasoning"
157,6,ceptune,2025-06-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Edit: I strongly urge everyone to read my friend Mac’s review on this here

158,1,titoianlee,2025-06-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is a powerful, intimate portrait of a young gymnast who discovers she’s pregnant just days before her Olympic tryouts"
158,2,titoianlee,2025-06-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Rather than using the pregnancy as a dramatic twist, the film treats it as a deeply human moment—one that forces Sunshine to confront her identity, future, and agency as a young woman"
158,3,titoianlee,2025-06-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Jadaone’s direction is sensitive and grounded, allowing the story to unfold with quiet urgency and emotional truth"
158,4,titoianlee,2025-06-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film bravely highlights the invisible struggles women face when ambition and reality collide
158,5,titoianlee,2025-06-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Through layered characters and subtle symbolism, Sunshine reveals how choices—especially for women—are rarely simple, often shaped by expectations and silent pressures"
158,6,titoianlee,2025-06-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal delivers a standout performance, capturing Sunshine’s vulnerability and strength with nuance"
158,7,titoianlee,2025-06-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The final scene is restrained yet powerful, offering a deeply satisfying end"
158,8,titoianlee,2025-06-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a brave, necessary film that speaks volumes about the difficult choices women must make in a world that rarely makes space for them"

160,1,dennynotdeeny,2025-07-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What do you mean Sunshine walked from Quiapo Church to Siena College
160,2,dennynotdeeny,2025-07-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I’d recognize that street corner anywhere
160,3,dennynotdeeny,2025-07-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As in Fan Girl, the best thing about Jadaone’s filmmaking here is how she leverages unreality to create an immersive, tactile, and real subjective experience"
160,4,dennynotdeeny,2025-07-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film is not just set in Manila, but Sunshine’s Manila, at times hypocritically prim and tragically seedy, both just different modes of alienation borne from the conservative milieu that devalues and abandons the marginalized among us, here particularly young women"
160,5,dennynotdeeny,2025-07-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s a potent text not because it presents clear answers—although its allegiance to its protagonist is never uncertain—but because it paints the sort of full and rich portrait of a woman’s life that the society it portrays cannot seem to imagine for the women in it
160,6,dennynotdeeny,2025-07-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Very good
161,1,chocolocotol,2025-07-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a powerful, empathetic, and important film that bravely confronts a topic still considered taboo in the Philippines"
161,2,chocolocotol,2025-07-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As someone born and raised in the country, I found it both courageous and deeply resonant"
161,3,chocolocotol,2025-07-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s not just what the film is trying to say, but how it says it and, that stands out"
161,4,chocolocotol,2025-07-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"They did it with care, nuance, and emotional clarity rarely seen in local cinema"

164,4,carlparaan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As she traverse the limited and unfair choices, the feeling of helplessness associated with the ticking time bomb inside her is tactile"
164,5,carlparaan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I felt restrained from the very beginning until the penultimate scene because every obstacle she goes through, she can't show weakness; she has to show up with a brave face because of the programmed noise in her head; which was generated by the years of social norms put upon every woman's shoulder"
164,6,carlparaan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"One of the most profound and sensitive moments I found deeply moving was when Sunshine said, ""Hindi po ako buntis, coach"", yet her eyes was swelling with tears"
164,7,carlparaan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She can't believe that this is the only truth she is forced to deal with, that everything she has worked for will end in a whim, and that the choice wasn't even deliberately made by her; mirroring the many women in the Philippines who undergo teenage pregnancy, who also don't have a safe choice for their bodies, and for their dreams"
164,8,carlparaan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As I sit and bask in her story in the cinema, my tears kept falling even in the most simplistic emotions"

164,11,carlparaan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maybe this is how it is to step in the shoes of every woman in the Philippines, and at the very least, it's only a feeling I can imagine"

164,13,carlparaan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But it takes a stand, and at the core of it is Maris Racal; supported by a riveting ensemble just as honest as her"

195,11,iancarloarias,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and the mysterious girl character, while symbolic, didn’t fully land"

197,1,lanbah,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Philippines is still a conservative country and, honestly, I'm shocked that this got a wide release thanks to SM Cinemas"
197,2,lanbah,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I don't know how hard it must've been to make this release work given how abortion is still illegal in this country and the stigma surrounding it
197,3,lanbah,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Such an empathetic film that's filled with so much heart despite how other people make it seem like an immoral decision
197,4,lanbah,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As Direk Tonet said in the Q and A screening I went to, as a writer, she sides with her characters whether people think the decisions that her character makes is right or wrong"
197,5,lanbah,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In other words, she doesn't give a fuck what other people thinks about abortion"
197,6,lanbah,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As for Maris, damn, what a performance"
197,7,lanbah,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She's known to be more expressive and she admits as well that the hardest thing for her is leveling that down that she has to unlearn even the small nuances that she does
197,8,lanbah,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Such a vulnerable performance

197,10,lanbah,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"We have been behind as a country when it comes to talking about reproductive health and women's rights but I hope given how widely this film is being seen right now that it sparks the necessary conversation not only in our society but also in our government that at the very least, decriminalize abortion"
197,11,lanbah,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Side note: what a complete 180 when I saw this after watching Fantastic Four
198,1,thecritique143,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is corny when it's soap opera-ish
198,2,thecritique143,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is effective when it's simplistic
199,1,theod0re,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sunshine perfectly encapsulates every facet of what abortion looks like in the Philippines: how women resort to dangerous means because of its inaccessibility, the conservatives who set that system up, and the inutile men who exacerbate the plight of women"
199,2,theod0re,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,a lot of the scenes had me leaning over
199,3,theod0re,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the cast is incredible, and maris racal is at her peak"
199,4,theod0re,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i was expecting the movie to fail at delivering a perfect ending but it didn’t
199,5,theod0re,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,definitely direk tonet’s magnum opus

202,1,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sa Pilipinas, ang mga tulad ni Sunshine ay pinipilit habulin ang liwanag kahit paulit-ulit silang nilulunod sa dilim"
202,2,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Alam naman nating lahat: illegal ang aborsyon sa bansang ito
202,3,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Pero kailanman, hindi ito makakapigil sa aborsyon"
202,4,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ang nagagawa lang nito ay itulak ang mga babae sa delikado, hindi ligtas, at hindi kontroladong paraan"
202,5,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,At ipinakita sa atin ng pelikulang ito kung gaano ka-mapanganib iyon
202,6,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Mula sa pagbebenta ng pamparegla sa mga black market hanggang sa mga hilot na hindi naman ginagawa ng propesyonal—lahat ‘yan ay repleksyon ng desperasyong hindi nila ginusto, kundi bunga ng sistemang patuloy silang pinapabayaan"
202,7,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Pero hindi lang aborsyon ang laman ng pelikulang ito
202,8,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Binuksan nito ang mas malawak na usapin—bulok na healthcare system, paniniwalang relihiyoso na ginagamit panlaban sa kababaihan, incest, rape, teenage pregnancy, pressure bilang atleta, takot sa kahihiyan, at moralidad na tila laging nakasandal sa pananakit ng babae"
202,9,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Pinakita ng pelikula ang buong paligid ni Sunshine—pamilya, paaralan, simbahan, coach, kaibigan, doktor—at kung paano sila naging bahagi ng problema o ng solusyon"
202,10,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,At sobrang tamang-tama lang na sa Maynila ito kinunan
202,11,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sa Morayta, Recto, at Quiapo—mga lugar na malapit sa University Belt, kung saan maraming estudyante ang nakakaranas ng hindi planadong pagbubuntis"
202,12,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Mga lugar rin ito na kilala sa underground na kalakaran—mula sa pekeng dokumento hanggang sa black market na pampalaglag
202,13,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Realidad ito ng maraming kabataan, at pinili ng pelikula na hindi ito pagtakpan"
202,14,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Wala itong pa-plot twist
202,15,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Walang engrandeng eksena
202,16,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Pero ramdam mo ang bigat
202,17,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At naipaabot niya ang mensahe nang malinaw sa masa, sa bawat Pilipinong kailangang mamulat"
202,18,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Hindi para mangumbinsi, kundi para magpasimula ng pag-uusap"
202,19,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Pag-uusap na maaaring maging tulay tungo sa legalisasyon—o kahit dekriminalisasyon—ng aborsyon sa bansa natin
202,20,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sobrang husay ni Maris Racal
202,21,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Para siyang talagang gymnast
202,22,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Lahat ng galaw may kahulugan
202,23,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Lahat ng tahimik na sandali, may sigaw"
202,24,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Kudos sa choreographers—dahil bawat routine, may sariling kwento"
202,25,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Si Sunshine ay isa lang
202,26,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Pero napakarami pang katulad niya
202,27,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Iba-iba man ang dahilan, iisa ang dapat malinaw: ang desisyon ay dapat laging nasa babae"
202,28,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sa katawan nila
202,29,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sa buhay nila
202,30,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hindi kailangan ng pelikula ng sagot
202,31,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Pero may lakas ito para magtanong
202,32,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At sa isang bansang takot harapin ang tanong, sapat na iyon para tawaging rebolusyonaryo"
202,33,aarondavem,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sana ang Sunshine na ito, maging sinag ng panibagong simula"

328,2,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She is two weeks away from performing in the qualifying round
328,3,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She has won numerous gold medals in local and Asian competitions, making her an ideal candidate for an Olympic gold"
328,4,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But everything changes when she discovers an unwanted pregnancy
328,5,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a male-dominated, conservative, church-leaning country, who can help Sunshine achieve her dreams"
328,6,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Jadaone's latest picture is a gritty coming-of-age sports drama that tackles a sensitive yet realistic portrayal of the struggles women face when the government and society turn their backs on them
328,7,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is a claustrophobic journey that dims the shine of its lead character even before she sees the end of the tunnel
328,8,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film offers a timely and relevant discussion on gender roles, sex education, the health care system, body autonomy, female rage, and empowerment"
328,9,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At its center is Maris Racal, who plays the titular character with grace, bareness, and nuance"
328,10,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She embodies the sunshine amidst a dirty, hypocritical, careless, and immovable society that becomes a character of its own"
328,11,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is supported by the film’s striking eye for cinematic framing of the ragged city of Manila
328,12,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I love how the film handles the core of its subject: should Sunshine get an abortion and continue chasing her dreams, or take the baby and live a life she is not prepared for"
328,13,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I love how the women characters come together to help each other against the oppressive weight of our patriarchal society
328,14,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And when Sunshine finally makes a decision, I don’t think the film wants you to agree or disagree with her"
328,15,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It wants you to ask why she had to be in this position in the first place
328,16,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It wants us to notice the shoulder-to-shoulder crowding in public maternity wards
328,17,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It wants us to see the hypocrisy of a society where black markets for abortion operate in the shadows of churches, and why a woman still cannot make a decision about her own body without judgment from everyone around her"
328,18,sirmiroro,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Pero gets kita, Sunshine"

334,4,kimpoybrian,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She clings to her subject and vision with ardor, grit, and sensitivity that is why Sunshine lands so effectively"

341,1,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a statement
341,2,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Raw, delicate, and bold"
341,3,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It presents a social commentary on themes rarely explored yet deeply prevalent in the Philippine context
341,4,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It dares to be radical
341,5,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It dares to draw the line
341,6,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,When does the sun finally shine in a morally gray cloud of social disapproval
341,7,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As linear and straightforward as the film appears, beneath it lies a complex character study — fearlessly told, thematically sharp, and emotionally unsettling"
341,8,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone writes for women, and in a cinematic landscape like ours, we need more voices like hers"
341,9,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I was initially worried about where the story would go, but it was brave enough to take the harder path"
341,10,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is Maris Racal's best performance yet — nuanced and quietly powerful
341,11,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But it was Jennica Garcia who stole every scene she was in
341,12,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She was the emotional anchor, the tearjerker"
341,13,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Some casting choices outside the leads, however, fell short"
341,14,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Certain scenes and narrative decisions could have landed harder with stronger performances or more fitting direction
341,15,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That said, the editing needs work"
341,16,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The presence of a stunt double in certain scenes is obvious, breaking immersion"
341,17,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While the film’s visuals hauntingly capture a side of Manila we rarely see on screen, the sound design lacks polish"
341,18,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,These flaws are noticeable but not deal-breaking
341,19,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Still, this film succeeds in doing what few others do: it makes you ask what is ethical and what is not"
341,20,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It invites reflection
341,21,newrev,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And when a film draws that line clearly for society to see, perhaps that’s when the sun truly begins to shine"

363,1,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The film has a sense of urgency about it, presenting the drama with so much eagerness, firm convictions, and intense sentiments nearly to the point where it devolves into cheap propaganda for a cause with which I happen to agree ideologically"
363,2,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It was too on the nose and constantly going for shock value that it was draining to follow, brazenly provoking the audience to feel for a horrible social reality but instead of pointing it out with a nod and a commentary, it was trying so hard to make them feel bad about those situations"
363,3,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Not in a good way because it is one of those things that breeds frustration rather than empathy for the protagonist
363,4,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"At some point, Sunshine simply disappeared, becoming a vessel for the audience to put their shoes on since she is subjected to so much oppression, losing any semblance of agency as it is all about how messed up her social reality has become"
363,5,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It's the same problem I had with war films and other poverty porn, where it ignores developing the protagonist in favor of escalating the situations in front of her and throwing every miserable conflicts imaginable at her"
363,6,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"To be fair, the protagonist as a vessel had an aspiration, a threatened dream that was about to be broken, and the idea of her interacting with all these women, smoothly transitioning from the one who needed help to the one who provided help, clearly distinguished the film from those with a typical point-of-view character"
363,7,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Those moments of empowerment and camaraderie with other women may have eased the tension and made it feel more hopeful than the premise implies, but it also falls into the trap of caricaturing other characters for the sake of cheap sensationalism"
363,8,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It also felt betraying that so many things transpired that the gymnastics was set aside for so long, and I would hope that it was more of an escape than a hardship because no joy was displayed during those routines except for the last act"
363,9,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"I would say that the sport was not seamlessly wedded to the character, since it could have been any sport or dream, and the film would still be effective"
363,10,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The magical realism element is essentially what I detest about the film, because it could have lingered in the loneliness and allowed the audience to connect with the character through subtlety, but it had to be filled with hypothetical conversation that hits the audience on the head to explain the themes and demonstrate the unspoken dilemmas in the present predicament"
363,11,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It could be interpreted as a mean to communicate guilt, a process of forgiving oneself and empathizing with other women, or as humanizing the fetus inside the body, which I'm not sure how to feel about that ideologically"
363,12,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It's also tonally odd, which is a Philippine cinema branding at this point, but it's always convenient to use a child for humor, and it reduces the overall tone of what's happening to the main character"
363,13,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It was just too telegraphed at times, and I was hoping to let the sequences play out and use more silence because those are the scenes I enjoy when the protagonist is alone and burdened by her situation"
363,14,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The upward momentum of a film that begins bleakly will always impede any form of storytelling because it must outdo itself, building emotions that are overwhelming every ten minutes to the point of monotony"
363,15,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"In fact, I can't recall the chronology of the film even though I saw it yesterday, but I do remember every segments and the emotions it was going for"
363,16,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It actually came to the point of absurdity in the third act, when one character emerged, followed by a terrible circumstances, followed by even more bleak information and an unsettling confrontation, which would undoubtedly disturb anyone"
363,17,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"And then there was a cameo in which the small theater collectively whisper and giggle a bit as a result of being taken off guard, which again felt awkward because it always has to make a joke after every other miserably effective scene"
363,18,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Not letting the moments breathe for a while
363,19,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It can even be tonally confusing at times, with scenes that is either attempting to be comical or unsettling as some of the dialogue was just satirical and they incorporate some triggering monologue ala Vincentiments, but they also made the film lighthearted, which I am not sure is a good thing"
363,20,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"I suppose I want my abortion movies to be more thought-provoking and full of sociological nuances rather than funny and emotional, because it can be too loose for its sensitive subject matter, but it was heartfelt and that was good"
363,21,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"I'm making it seem like I hate this film when than I don't because it was terrific and entertaining, but it's just that I'm not sure if those are the things I want to take away from this film"
363,22,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I have to say though that it had a very good filmmaking mechanics
363,23,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"I heard they tried to hide the camera in public scenes to make the setting appear more authentic, and I was expecting long takes because it was another Filipino film about a protagonist wandering around which they did not employ at all, but I kind of like what they did here, from the shot composition and coverages to the way they were edited together"
363,24,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The only criticism I had regarding the filmmaking was the noticeable stunt double in the gymnastic routines, as well as how the emotions in the close-ups did not match those in the wide shots whenever they intercut them together"
363,25,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"I suspect no one grins when doing gymnastics since it is a serious performance by meticulous athletes rather than by an exuberant victorious person, as the film claims at the conclusion"
363,26,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It's just a little quibble, but I commend the filmmaking overall and even the rough cuts were fantastic"
363,27,bcd2114,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Definitely the best-directed Filipino film I've seen in quite some time, I can say that with confidence"

383,34,fordaart,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Walang dramatic confrontation, walang resolution, at walang solusyon sa mga problema ni Sunshine"

386,1,pancitkenton,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,as an rg fan i was prepared to be disappointed by the gymnastics
386,2,pancitkenton,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,but it was surprisingly great
386,3,pancitkenton,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"accurate 'yung skills to the CoP at the time, and maganda 'yung execution and flow of the routines imoi think for narrative/symbolic purposes 'yung pag-focus on training the ribbon, but i wish maris's character also trained with the other 3 apparatus kahit saglit kasi nagmukha siyang ribbon specialist, which isn't really a thingalso: what qualifiers"
386,4,pancitkenton,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"also not really a thing, unless they mean the qualification round of a specific competition (the asian champs)"
386,5,pancitkenton,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"anyway, i nitpicked the rg part because the story, the acting, and everything else was done really well :-) love the message surrounding reproductive rights and how the patriarchal system disadvantages, HARMS, women"

390,1,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone has always been one of the few Filipino filmmakers I deeply admire, not just for her craft, but for the way she tells women’s stories with empathy and nuance"
390,2,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her work has always felt personal, films like Alone/Together, Fan Girl and now Sunshine, might just be my favorite Filipino film released this year so far"
390,3,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I remember seeing the trailer last year and wondering if it would even get a proper release here
390,4,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It tackles such a taboo topic, one that many in this country still refuse to even speak about"
390,5,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,That’s why I admire Jadaone so much
390,6,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She’s chosen to talk about what others won’t
390,7,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a predominantly Catholic nation where abortion is criminalized, even in cases of rape or incest, Sunshine feels like an act of courage"
390,8,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I’ve always been pro-choice
390,9,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I grew up surrounded by the whole “abortion is murder” narrative, from relatives, from my old Catholic school run by nuns"
390,10,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But even as a kid, it never sat right with me"
390,11,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I never saw it as a sin
390,12,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And now that I’m studying to become a doctor, that belief matters even more to me, because women deserve healthcare that doesn’t judge or shame them"
390,13,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine affected me on a personal level because of that
390,14,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It reminded me why I want to do this
390,15,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s not a perfect film
390,16,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Some might find the pacing fast or feel like it didn’t say enough
390,17,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But to me, the point isn’t perfection"
390,18,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What matters is that it exists
390,19,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It dares
390,20,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s a film that opens doors, uncomfortable ones, sure, but necessary"
390,21,_filmonella,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I really hope it’s not the last of its kind
391,1,kianfilmsx,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Gets ko na
392,1,cerses,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maris plays Sunshine with so much empathy that it permeates outside the screen, her win is our win, her disappointment is our disappointment"
392,2,cerses,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Through the streets of Manila to the corners of her room, we get to hold hands with her and be a confidant"
392,3,cerses,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I like how it positions the audience as part of this journey, not as the usual bystander"
392,4,cerses,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"One sequence that stood out is the one from the inn to the hospital - Maris lets herself be consumed by Sunshine, almost as if the creeping is part of the routine itself"
392,5,cerses,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The messaging gets confusing in the middle but ultimately ends in a tender moment of acceptance and determination
392,6,cerses,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I’m just happy films like this finally exist in our country

394,1,christian_davao,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,shuta ang galing ni Maris
395,1,romebisaya,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I knew Sunshine was a good film even before watching it because Antoinette Jadaone has consistently delivered satisfying work throughout her career
395,2,romebisaya,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I had the chance to watch it in a cinema in Cebu, surrounded by fellow film enthusiasts, including Maris Racal and Antoinette Jadaone in the audience"
395,3,romebisaya,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I teared up multiple times
395,4,romebisaya,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This is a woman’s story, one that powerfully captures her control over her body and her choices"
395,5,romebisaya,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film's use of magical realism elevated the narrative, turning what could have been dull internal monologues into vibrant, engaging character portrayals by the actors"
395,6,romebisaya,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s no surprise the film has already received international recognition
395,7,romebisaya,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It absolutely deserves it, and even more"
396,1,jikan_desu,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hindi ako nahihiya
396,2,jikan_desu,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ayokong maging nanay Needless to say dahil expected na, pero ang galing ni Maris at Jennica"
396,3,jikan_desu,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,That leaning-on-shoulder scene nila sa taxi ang fave kong ganung moment in Asian cinema
396,4,jikan_desu,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Natuwa ako na nandito si Angeli Bayani, bilang isang compassionate na doctor"
397,1,danekylle,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,gets ko na
397,2,danekylle,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,gosh what a powerful one-liner to end and encapsulate the entire progression of the film
397,3,danekylle,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sobrang powerful that the child gets it; she understands and respects the reasons behind Sunshine's choices, even at the expense of her own life"
397,4,danekylle,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sobrang powerful din ng scene before the last routine, with jennica and maris, na kahit anong desisyon ni Sunshine, mage-gets ng ate niya"
397,5,danekylle,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"at ganoon din yung goal ng pelikula—na ma-gets nating lahat why people resort to abortion,…"
398,1,iclrxa,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"for as many times as we sit and talk about unwanted pregnancies and abortion, there is a woman out there na katulad ni sunshine na dala-dala ang bigat ng desisyong siya lang ang pwedeng gumawa"
398,2,iclrxa,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"conversations regarding this matter often talk about the cause and consequences, but never once did we talk about the process women have to endure— the grief, the confusion, the isolation"
398,3,iclrxa,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it was never just in black and white
398,4,iclrxa,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,hindi lang siya basta nabuntis at mas lalong hindi lang siya basta nagdesisyon
398,5,iclrxa,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this film showed everything in between
398,6,iclrxa,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it was an honest attempt to potray the realities women go through, a reminder that we are free to dream and we are free to live life the way we choose to"
399,1,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a Q&A with writer-director Antoinette Jadaone that I was lucky to attend, she was asked how she braced for the potential backlash of this film from Filipino audiences given our mostly conservative background"
399,2,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her answer resonated with me deeply: As a writer, Jadaone believes her primary duty is to stay loyal to her characters"
399,3,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"If her character's arc demands visiting unnerving and controversial depths, she is not afraid to take the plunge - regardless of how viewers might perceive it"
399,4,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her earlier work, Fan Girl (2020), already painted a similar picture, albeit a bit spottily"
399,5,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Jadaone takes her boldest steps yet in her latest work, Sunshine (2024), by tackling abortion, a highly contentious subject in the country, with both sensitivity and grit"
399,6,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This entry is unflinching in its commentary, taking us to the most harrowing places women can be in a nation where sexual abuse is prevalent, abortion is illegal, and healthcare fails the underprivileged"
399,7,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine, our protagonist, is a skilled gymnast, but even she can't leap over patriarchy, tumble past outdated laws, or cartwheel her way out of the conservative society and system"
399,8,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In one scene, Sunshine waits along a street choked with tricycles, behind the railing of a pharmacy counter - she is jailed in and by this wretched city, made a criminal for wanting to make a choice that should be her right"
399,9,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But this film's Manila is more than just Sunshine's prison
399,10,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's a breathing character, trailing her around from scene to scene"
399,11,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Always in the backdrop but never invisible
399,12,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Never speaking but always loud
399,13,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A passing MRT train rattles the windows of a shabby motel
399,14,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A crammed jeepney bounces to the bass of a local rap song
399,15,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Grimy streets teem with hustling vendors and weary residents
399,16,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine makes her choices, but her choices are only as good as this bleak, brutal city allows"
399,17,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal delivers a phenomenal performance, portraying our protagonist with nuance and raw intensity"
399,18,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She is backed by a stellar ensemble - Jennica Garcia, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, and Elijah Canlas - each breathing life into characters that are authentic and vital to the film's message"
399,19,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The sequences are daring, the story beats sometimes violent, but always necessary"
399,20,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The music elevates it all, with a standout Challengers-esque score underscoring the gymnastic scenes"
399,21,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This film is not without its faults though, with excessive cursing (seriously, again in a Project 8 work"
399,22,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"), somewhat awkward acting, and some unpolished plot points, but these are forgivable given how effective the complete work is"
399,23,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine may very well be Direk Tonet's finest work yet - and rightly so
399,24,pinathbutter,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It stands as one of the most important Filipino films in the modern times
400,1,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,first time watching a screening at a cinema with the star herself (ANG GANDA MO SA PERSONAL MARIS WTF)
400,2,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,such a great film with brilliant creative choices all throughout
400,3,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,so emotional and so so real
400,4,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,only a female director could masterfully tell this story
400,5,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"edit: after the second watch, i realized how empowering and important it was to portray this story using sports as a metaphor to her bodily autonomy"
400,6,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"everybody loves her when she uses her body to look beautiful for the world, but when mishap occurs, she is shamed for it"
400,7,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"yet, in the end, i noticed that the last thing she declares about her pregnancy is a statement that is so bold and firm: “Ayoko maging nanay"
400,8,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” right in front of the men who tried to control her decisions
400,9,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,which maybe leaves the audience to think: “what happened after that
400,10,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"” but the point is that her decision, her body, and her passion, are all unshakably hers until the end"
400,11,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and we see that because after that scene with miggy and his dad, she practices her routine again"
400,12,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and then it was so perfect-had tears in my eyes the whole time
400,13,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"in that gymnasium, Sunshine “drowns out the noise"
400,14,dewonroses,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"” what remains is her unwavering bond with her body, both as a woman and as a gymnast"

402,1,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,i was deeply moved and inspired by sunshine
402,2,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,what a gem of philippine cinema
402,3,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,you know a film is good when it makes you want to create again
402,4,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"however, while undeniable in its prowess and relevance, its potency and impact dwindles in its struggle to pinpoint with conviction who its target audience is"
402,5,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"it seems to want to pander to both liberal and conservative audiences, but this muddles its message"
402,6,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,who is this film really for
402,7,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,who is it in dialogue with
402,8,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"i thought that the choice to portray the unborn fetus as a grown, conscious being was counterintuitive at first, but then i realized the film was only trying to meet its conservative audiences halfway in their beliefs"
402,9,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"then i thought it was a stroke of genius: of course, the only way to convince someone to change their mind is by explaining it in the terms they understand, through their perspective of the world"
402,10,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,but then it also alienates this very audience by demonizing them in the film
402,11,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"while it successfully empathizes with the horrors of being a woman in the philippines, there is a lack of nuance, a dichotomy of good vs"
402,12,iauqmaj,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"evil, that might be more harmful than helpful in the grander scheme of things"

404,1,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The tone set by Sunshine over Jadaone's previous film, Fangirl, is way different"
404,2,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The urgency of survival is apparent and how it clashes with the film's thematic journey, like Paul Soriano's Thelma"
404,3,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Though Sunshine tends to get the feel of guerrilla direction, it is a combination of the director's experiences in mainstream and her indie roots"
404,4,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Meaning, we get to see well-lighted scenes and less usage of shake cam"
404,5,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine unpacks a lot of society's ills and inequalities
404,6,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Patriarchy, discrimination in the medical field, inhumane laws, and glaring social class issues that don't benefit those without that much"
404,7,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a country where religion reigns, or so they say, the film easily relays problems with well-made sequences and heartbreaking results"
404,8,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Jadaone knows the voices of her characters, and it tells a distinct topic with passion and wit, giving the audiences a rollercoaster of emotions"
404,9,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,One thing that makes this film unique is the inclusion of a fantastic element
404,10,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It somehow references, or a styling of, what they had in Death Note anime or Big Mouth to make it more accurate"
404,11,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And such symbolism as Sunshine's conscience made it relatively easier to tell the film's narrative

404,16,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The options to use close-ups for intensity of emotions and certain decisions to make the scenes with Mariz Racal's gymnastic performance were made with careful efficiency
404,17,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And the sound editing was just on point
404,18,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is technically the protagonist's in-ear audio being shared with the viewers
404,19,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Jadaone's casting is really one for the books

404,23,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,These aren't farfetched ideas shown in the film
404,24,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Most of them are realistically sound and Piolo Pascual's short stint really is just something for us to gasp about
404,25,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And we also get to see Jennica Garcia and Elijah Canlas' supporting roles to complete the ensemble
404,26,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Les we forget Annika Co's strong personality
404,27,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I guess we have another star made by the director
404,28,targrod,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And regarding Meryll Soriano being part of the film

433,4,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,No one spoke
433,5,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It was that rare kind of silence
433,6,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Not awkward, but sacred"
433,7,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,As if we had all just witnessed something painfully true and didn’t quite know what to do with ourselves
433,8,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Because Sunshine isn’t just a movie
433,9,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s a question
433,10,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A confrontation
433,11,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Directed with clarity and deep compassion by Direk Tonet Jadaone, Sunshine doesn’t soften its message or try to make it more palatable"
433,12,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s brave
433,13,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s loud in its honesty
433,14,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It doesn’t ask for permission to be angry or tired or vulnerable
433,15,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It simply is, and that’s why it hits the way it does"
433,16,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And yet, somehow, even with all its emotional weight, Direk Tonet’s signature humor still finds its way through"
433,17,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There are moments—unexpected but perfectly timed—when the entire cinema bursts into laughter
433,18,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s sharp, it’s honest, and it never feels out of place"
433,19,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maybe Direk Tonet makes us laugh because she knows we’ll cry eventually
433,20,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Or maybe that’s just how we are as Filipinos, finding humor even in the heaviest moments, because sometimes, it’s the only way we know how to carry the pain"
433,21,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What makes this film even more powerful is how it gives voice to things we often overlook
433,22,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As someone who isn’t a woman, I know I can’t fully grasp the weight of that experience"
433,23,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But this film opened a window for me
433,24,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"A clear, honest glimpse into a reality I will never live, but need to see"
433,25,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Much of that power comes from the performances
433,26,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal, as Sunshine, delivers the most vulnerable and grounded work of her career"
433,27,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her pain is quiet, but it radiates"
433,28,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"You feel it in the way she holds her breath between words, in the weight behind her gaze"
433,29,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Jennica Garcia, as her sister, is just as affecting"
433,30,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her stillness, her softness, the way she listens"
433,31,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She becomes a reflection of what the film asks of us: to pause, to witness, to respond with care"
433,32,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There’s a moment near the end that stuck with me
433,33,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine asks, “Gets mo na ba ako"
433,34,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"”And while it’s said to the person in the room, it felt like she was looking straight through the screen, asking us, the viewers"
433,35,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And like that person beside her, I hope we all have the courage to say: Yes"

433,39,ajduyac,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Keep telling stories that hold space for women to be everything—loud and quiet, strong and hurting, tired and brave"

472,1,farscribe,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine (2024) would be a perfect double feature with Eliza Hittman's Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) as they both tackle similar topics but with a stark difference in privilege and access
472,2,farscribe,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"where the latter becomes a story of sisterhood and compassion, as two girls cross state lines to get access to healthcare, Sunshine offers no such respite to our eponymous protagonist"
472,3,farscribe,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"in here, what Sunshine wants is not even a matter of choice, it is something that she is forced to bear"
472,4,farscribe,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"all alone as her confidants succumb to the stigma of her dilemma, Sunshine takes to the streets of Manila in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy"
472,5,farscribe,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the plot moves along while the audience is served scenes of what i believe to be one of the better cinematic depictions of modern Manila
472,6,farscribe,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the first few minutes almost feel like an entirely different film (one i would have particularly liked more) until the plot takes a peculiar detour
472,7,farscribe,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,in all of its realism and poignancy i found a particular element in its storytelling very out of place and oftentimes distracting
472,8,farscribe,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,while the ending made me understand why those choices were made i just don't think a semblance of Magical Realism is the perfect vehicle for a message as heavy as this one
472,9,farscribe,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"while i think the point that: ""an entire generation of Filipino women being forced to reckon with their unborn children as if the choice of abortion is something that has to be explained, and in turn, be understood"
472,10,farscribe,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,""" is a step in the right direction for this nation's pro-choice discourse, the delivery just felt like it was bordering into Diary of an Unborn Child territory"
472,11,farscribe,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"with that being said, i still thoroughly enjoyed Sunshine and i would still highly recommend it"

482,3,zarvindale,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Perhaps my favorite element of this new project from Antoinette Jadaone is the contrast between morality and sin as personified by the hawker who sells abortion pills behind figures of saints beside Quiapo Church, which is arguably the most popular place of veneration among Catholic Filipinos throughout the country"

513,3,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"You don’t just watch the story unfold, you feel it with Sunshine"
513,4,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"What stuck with me the most is the way the film builds this deeply uncomfortable paradox: a country that loudly declares abortion is murder, yet leaves no room for safe options, quietly allowing dangerous pills to be sold under the table"
513,5,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The contradiction isn’t even subtle, it’s the whole point"
513,6,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Being a Filipino is already hard, but being a woman in the Philippines"
513,7,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's brutal
513,8,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t sugarcoat anything, it throws you straight into the brokenness of it all, from healthcare to shame culture to just… surviving"
513,9,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As the story unfolds, you’re taken on this intense ride with Sunshine, a girl trying to make sense of what she’s going through while the world around her offers no real answers"
513,10,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It forces you to confront your own biases
513,11,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,You start to ask yourself: what would I do in her place
513,12,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"What’s the “right” choice, really, when you’re trapped in a society that only ever gives you wrong ones"
513,13,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Menggay’s story hit like a gut punch
513,14,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s the kind of pain that’s so real, but we never talk about because we’re scared to"
513,15,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Menggay isn't just another casualty, at the end of it all -- she's still a kid"
513,16,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What I love most about the storytelling is that it doesn’t preach
513,17,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It makes you think, it makes you question -- but in the end, it reminds you that it should all boil down to what Sunshine feels is right"
513,18,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What she knows is best
513,19,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It gives her that agency, that voice, something this world so often tries to take from girls like her"
513,20,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I've always been a fan of Maris Racal, and I agree that this is her best project yet"
513,21,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She didn’t need to go big; her silence already said everything
513,22,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And I loved how the film used gymnastics as this quiet metaphor of control, performance, and discipline all while her personal life spirals into uncertainty"
513,23,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s so smart
513,24,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And I have to say: the cinematography
513,26,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Of course, the gym scenes were beautifully shot, we all expected that - but it was the motel scenes that floored me"
513,27,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There was something about how those moments were framed that just hit harder
513,28,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Like everything was raw, exposed, still"
513,29,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And what really stayed with me, long after the credits rolled, was this one feeling: at the end of it all, our dreams, they’re always for the younger versions of ourselves"
513,30,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"We fight, we keep going, because we hope they’d understand"
513,31,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That if we ever had to explain why we chose what we chose, they’d look at us and say, “gets kita"
513,32,lizzycapellan,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"”But the question that lingers is: are we, is this world ready for a story as brave as Sunshine"
514,1,_bubble,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i love how sunshine stood her ground and said she didn’t want to be a mother, even when her boyfriend’s dad offered help and support"
514,2,_bubble,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it really showed how sure she was about what she wanted for her life
514,3,_bubble,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"abortion should be legalized not because people are being careless, but because women should have the right to decide for themselves"
514,4,_bubble,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and let’s not ignore the elephant in the room: the philippine healthcare system is so messed up
514,5,_bubble,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,women like sunshine don’t get the care they need
514,6,_bubble,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and for what
514,7,_bubble,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,so the budget can go to another pointless msproject or billboardsized face of some politician

515,1,davesori,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I think the best way to describe this film is that it’s truly a slice of life
515,2,davesori,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine may be a fictional character, but it’s not impossible to see someone like her in real life"
515,3,davesori,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maybe with a different name but sharing the same story or situation
515,4,davesori,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film beautifully portrays the strength of a woman as a sister, a friend, an athlete, and most importantly, as herself"
515,5,davesori,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I was also really impressed with how balanced the characters were
515,6,davesori,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Even the supporting roles had their moments to shine
515,7,davesori,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And Annika, what a star"
515,8,davesori,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I didn’t expect her character to unfold the way it did, but she delivered an outstanding performance, along with another child actor you absolutely need to see"

517,2,mdvllflrs,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I cried because it’s painfully relateable and also bc I know women like her
517,3,mdvllflrs,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I’ve been that friend who hears the secret
517,4,mdvllflrs,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The details are so specific and real
517,5,mdvllflrs,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,From the moment she bought the pregnancy kit with shame in her eyes and afraid of judgement — to checking that test in a cramped public restroom where two cubicles exist but only one works
517,6,mdvllflrs,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The fear of opening up to even one person and hiding it from her family
517,7,mdvllflrs,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sneaking into a motel for something you shouldn’t be ashamed of,,, all because abortion is illegal"
517,8,mdvllflrs,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is a reality for SO MANY women in the Philippines
517,9,mdvllflrs,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Women are forced in silence, danger, and in killing our dreams"

520,1,iamdamnation,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There’s no denying Sunshine matters - it speaks to harsh truths and tackles its themes with care and emotional honesty
520,2,iamdamnation,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film had a timely subject, sincere writing, and phenomenal acting - Maris Racal was stellar, while Jennica Garcia delivered with quiet power"
520,3,iamdamnation,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But I struggled with certain elements, particularly its attempt at magical realism"
520,4,iamdamnation,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The presence of the imaginary child felt clunky, tonally jarring, and out of sync with the otherwise grounded narrative"
520,5,iamdamnation,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Frankly, the character felt unnecessary - the film had already evolved past the need for her"
520,6,iamdamnation,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The story had power, and I wish it had trusted its own strength without the added flourish"
520,7,iamdamnation,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ultimately, I admired its purpose more than loving its execution"
521,1,chantipatico,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine sheds light on a topic many still avoid, the abortion and women's choices"

521,4,chantipatico,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sex education needs attention, lalo na mula sa mga nasa pwesto"
521,5,chantipatico,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The government should support this by pushing for proper education and open dialogue
521,6,chantipatico,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Kudos to the whole Sunshine team for bringing a story like this to light, something we should be openly discussing in this day and age"

553,2,jiannemsoriano,2025-07-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film transcends a simple narrative, offering a poignant and necessary critique of a society grappling with deeply entrenched religious and political views that often leave young women isolated and without agency"

553,5,jiannemsoriano,2025-07-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Where the film truly excels is in its unflinching depiction of the societal and systemic failures that trap young women like Sunshine
553,6,jiannemsoriano,2025-07-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The Philippines has the second-highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Southeast Asia, and a 2023 survey by Save the Children Philippines revealed that more than 500 adolescents become mothers each day, some as young as ten years old"
553,7,jiannemsoriano,2025-07-09 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine masterfully illustrates the intense personal isolation behind these numbers by using the accessible medium of sports

620,1,zkfdlf,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,WHAT A FILM FROM A GREAT DIRECTOR AND A GREAT LEAD
620,2,zkfdlf,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Its as if the main role was really predestined for maris racal
620,3,zkfdlf,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Made me emotional sa maternity ward, women really has so much empathy especially towards their own"
620,4,zkfdlf,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I think thats what make women really powerful
621,1,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We are in a limbo
621,2,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"So much of Philippine cinema, especially that which makes the rounds in local and international film festivals, is stuck churning out “groundbreaking” firsts"
621,3,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Because our cultural discourse is so behind, our filmmakers are tasked not only with telling stories, but also with inventing the stories to be told"
621,4,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"They’re required to stake out new thematic ground, not in service of aesthetic evolution, but simply to keep up with the global conversation"
621,5,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The cost of this is a cinema that often feels overburdened with didactic intent and undernourished in emotional and formal rigor
621,6,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a particularly polarizing gesture, Jadaone introduces a hallucinated child character, a device that indirectly echoes Jojo Rabbit (2019)"
621,7,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But this choice results in jarring tonal shifts that muddle the film’s emotional center
621,8,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"What was perhaps intended as farce to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour"
621,9,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility
621,10,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In fact, by personifying an unborn child as a character which speaks and thinks, then Sunshine unintentionally reinforces the very moral framing that anti-abortion rhetoric thrives on"
621,11,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It circles back into the age-old “when does life begin
621,12,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"” debate—a question that continues to paralyze policymaking in the country, even when the conversation should be about autonomy, access, and proper healthcare"
621,13,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, literalizes it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics"
621,14,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"What’s more revealing than the film itself is the discourse surrounding it: a ubiquity of gender-essentialist and bioessentialist defenses, as if any critique of any form is automatically a threat to representation"
621,15,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,That instinct: to guard a film’s cause rather than evaluate its craft just proves how far behind we are as a nation in talking about gender politics in filmmaking
621,16,macjohnearl,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The refusal to embrace genuinely revolutionary tactics, whether in politics or art, has kept us coasting on the optics of progress ever since"

631,1,vincentio,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is the product of the environment that failed her
631,2,vincentio,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's an excellent movie that's blatantly shows how women are being boxed with limited rights and decisions in their lives with her being a young gymnast who is forced to weigh her personal dreams against societal expectations
631,3,vincentio,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What makes the film compelling is how honest and raw it is which made it difficult and easy to digest at the same time
631,4,vincentio,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's difficult to digest since the film doesn't sugarcoat nor romanticize, it confronts"
631,5,vincentio,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It slaps us with the reality that our system is really crooked when it comes to having the options such as abortion which draws you into Sunshine’s emotional turmoil
631,6,vincentio,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's also easy to sort out as well as the film itself utilized a lot of symbolism and metaphor that's very comprehensible to the young audience since it was depicted in way of being simple and straightforward
631,7,vincentio,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is the kind of film that should have been made long ago
631,8,vincentio,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Its themes were not only relevant, but urgent not only within the country but the world"
631,9,vincentio,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine deserves to be shown in schools, especially for young women who are still learning to navigate their autonomy and choices in a culture that often denies them both"
631,10,vincentio,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"All I can say is that Sunshine is not just a film, it's a conversation starter, a one we desperately need"

638,6,cinesighs,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"whether you're going through or went through the same challenges sunshine did, it wasn't hard at all to relate to her and I can only hope that everyone who sees this film, specially now that it's released to the general filipino audience, will emphatize with her"
638,7,cinesighs,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,there were elements of the story that I wish had been woven in better but I couldn't hate them for it

648,2,ziaracarmelli,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is not just a film—it’s a rebellion against a system that punishes Filipinas for daring to survive
648,3,ziaracarmelli,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What a fearless and necessary filmz Sunshine dares to confront a brutal reality in a country where abortion remains illegal and where women’s rights are often reduced to whispers—silenced by false morality and systemic neglect
648,4,ziaracarmelli,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone’s storytelling isn’t just intimate; it is a searing indictment of how the state and even the healthcare system fail Filipinas
648,5,ziaracarmelli,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This film reminds us that every choice a woman makes is shaped by power structures that shame her, control her body, and turn compassion into judgment"
648,6,ziaracarmelli,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Through Sunshine’s journey, we see how being a woman in the Philippines means living in a constant struggle for autonomy—ang hirap maging babae, pero mas triple ang hirap ng mga babae dito sa Pilipinas"
648,7,ziaracarmelli,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is not just a movie; it is a mirror held up to a society that polices women’s bodies while abandoning them in their most vulnerable moments
648,8,ziaracarmelli,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s a rallying cry for the Sunshines, Theas, Helenas, Geleens, and Edens of this country—voices we must hear, stories we must protect"

652,5,libanlaraalyssa,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hay Antoinette Jadaone magsulat ka nalang talaga forever
653,1,johnwatchthings,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The anti-abortion people will always counter the pro-abortion with “Think about the child
653,2,johnwatchthings,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” without even thinking that the hypothetical child they protect would obviously side with their mother
653,3,johnwatchthings,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That’s probably my favorite part of the film, when the apparition-ed child, slowly revealed to be the baby in Sunshine’s womb, yet to be born, but who already became her conscience and shadow, finally understood why Sunshine had to make the decision"
653,4,johnwatchthings,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is Antoinette Jadaone making a courageous case as to…
654,1,lawrdbien,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Definitely Maris Racal’s breakout performance
655,1,claresse_,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,no notes it’s been an hour and i’m still speechless
656,1,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is astonishing as she gives a star-making performance in Antoinette Jadaone's finest film yet
656,2,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine takes us by the hand in a bustling Quiapo that's full of hypocrisy, contradiction, and a brutal system on women and their bodies"
656,3,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's a random odyssey of a woman trying to take back what is her's in an unforgiving conservative society
656,4,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In the film's opening moments, we see an ambitious athlete confused and paralyzed with the news of her untimely pregnancy"
656,5,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She's scared and she's prolonging the agony of confronting the inevitable
656,6,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"One thing that some people may ask is, why doesn't she immediately ask anyone for help"
656,7,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Doesn't she have a family
656,8,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Why is she trying to deal with such a serious problem on her own
656,9,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Is this the society that we've grown into
656,10,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Where a young woman is so afraid and paralyzed to get any help that she risks her life trying to deal with it on her own
656,11,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The answer is a resounding YES
656,12,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We are living in a country where dominant beliefs and religion are shoved down in women's throats even if it means giving up their dreams
656,13,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Where young women are scorned and defined by their mistakes instead of being educated and getting a strong support system
656,14,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Most egregiously, we live in a society that stigmatizes and punishes women but tolerates the very system, and actions that led to their unwanted pregnancies"
656,15,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,That is the society that Jadaone perfectly paints in this harrowing film
656,16,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Jadaone uses Quiapo as the backdrop to tell this story as she blends elements of neorealism and magic realism
656,17,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This film has a great sense of place as Sunshine roams around a Quiapo that hides hypocrisy underneath its Catholic cathedral
656,18,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Jadaone goes full Brocka mode through these scenes as she showcases different communities and people through a neorealist lens
656,19,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,That's why I found the film's surrealist tendencies to be a little bit jarring
656,20,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine encounters a kid that appears only through her consciousness and it really makes you wonder if this type of storytelling fits the themes that Jadaone is exploring
656,21,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It just runs the risk of making it too melodramatic and undercutting its authenticity
656,22,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But what keeps it from going off the rails is her unwavering compassion and understanding of Sunshine's plight
656,23,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Direk Tonet did mention in the Q&A session after that she swore that she was gonna hold Sunshine's hands and be by her side through every turbulence she'll face while writing this movie
656,24,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In the film's third act, the neorealist and magic realist narratives just blend into a powerful, poignant, and profound moment while Sunshine practices her routine one last time"
656,25,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I think this is a film that our country desperately needs right now
656,26,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's bound to spark debates and fruitful discussions about abortion, reproductive health, and women's right"
656,27,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Some may disagree with what Sunshine ended up doing, but at least this is a film that ignites a discussion for these taboo topics"
656,28,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I will never know how it feels to be a woman in an unfairly conservative country
656,29,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But this film rings with so much vitality, bravery, and honesty that I just cried by the end of it"
656,30,cjshua,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is so damn close to being a masterpiece

665,1,alonzojuwan,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Maybe most ingenious about Sunshine is its willingness to accept the decision to abort likely also involves a negotiation with the unborn child, maybe even a plea for forgiveness—less from God, because getting that would be easy, and in fact Sunshine gets it out of the way early on, but more from who the child would have been"
665,2,alonzojuwan,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"For the film indeed that is the longer battle, and it affords Sunshine a long array of events that could make the explaining easier"
665,3,alonzojuwan,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"She sees her dilemma reflected in the city's decay, her choice—which she readily makes—put into perspective, rounded out, by another girl's inaccess to that choice"
665,4,alonzojuwan,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Very carefully, and backed by research, Jadaone dissects what that choice may mean for women like Sunshine in a developing city like Manila, where dreams are scarce and their fulfillment even rarer"
665,5,alonzojuwan,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Sunshine's choice is an act of self-determination, in a world where that's seen as vulgar, irreverent: that is clear"
665,6,alonzojuwan,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"But to what should reverence be owed, in any case"
665,7,alonzojuwan,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Sunshine argues it's simply a matter of priority
665,8,alonzojuwan,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"When Sunshine chooses her dream—which she's been carrying in her womb longer than she's known her unborn child's ghost—we empathize with her, as does the ghost"

682,2,aragakky,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"mimicking what my friends say about this, it is indeed an important movie which hopefully, can open the doors for discussing the decriminalization of abortion and better, making the state strive toward a world that would not need it in the first place"
682,3,aragakky,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"quoting from one of my eye-opening reads this year, which greatly sums up my thoughts about abortion:“…focusing solely on the ‘right’ to have an abortion obscured the many other determining factors around childbirth, child-rearing and family"
682,4,aragakky,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It absolved the state of its responsibilities to create the support mechanisms for raising families
682,5,aragakky,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"If the decision to have a child is simply a woman’s choice, the responsibility for the well-being of children is shifted onto mothers instead of the society in which children are raised"
682,6,aragakky,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"”feminism, interrupted: disrupting power by lola olufemiinterestingly, what struck me the most was the portrayal of manila and the people living in it"

685,2,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It generally evokes feelings of tranquility and harmony, but Jadaone’s latest film flips it around to signify chaos and dysfunction"
685,3,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The color is almost everywhere, it’s inescapable: the walls of the protagonist’s home, the sterile and hostile clinic spaces, even the motel where the film’s lead almost died, comparable to the grip Catholicism has on the Philippines"
685,4,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"While they say there’s a separation between the church and the state, it’s barely upheld in practice, as they hinder human rights that could save thousands of lives"
685,5,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"And yes, I am talking about abortion laws, or the lack thereof here in my country"
685,6,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Jadaone’s Sunshine addresses the huge elephant in the senate, as it depicts the life of its titular lead (Maris Racal), whose life is turned upside down due to a sudden news of her own pregnancy"
685,7,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It’s easy to blame women like Sunshine for getting pregnant
685,8,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"After all, she’s presented as a domineering figure in her sport, even bound to compete in the Olympics, and she technically practiced unsafe sex, but not every case of unwanted pregnancy is like that"
685,9,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"There are multiple shots where Sunshine is physically separated by a fence-like barrier: be it the metal gates in the church, the ever-stretching horizontal jeepney rails, or the cold and black window frames, that subtly signal how Filipinas are imprisoned by their surroundings"
685,10,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Almost every gratingly infuriating, thought-provoking, and ludicrous dialogue circles back to one simple question: why is it that women are the ones penalized and restricted on matters that could jeopardize their own health and safety, especially in pregnancies caused by rape and incest"
685,11,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"While watching, I was constantly reminded of a film with similar thematic points, that of Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, and how women need to be discreet, travel thousands of miles, and suffer in silence over matters that should be openly discussed and not considered taboo or immoral"
685,12,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"If anything, I think this film is being highly censored in the Philippines, as the movie review board slapped an R-16 rating on a film that should be watched by teenagers"
685,13,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,How can we avoid teenage pregnancies when our government avoids talking about practicing safe sex to the right demographic
685,14,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Not everyone gets a happy conclusion like Sunshine did, so I hope that this film sparks a necessary conversation about women’s rights outside of the walls of movie theaters"
685,15,ahbr,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Jadaone’s Sunshine is truly one of the Philippines’ best releases of the year so far, in both its themes and execution, and a must-watch for all types, especially men and the religious-alike"

720,6,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In the first 10 minutes alone, Racal delivered a string of unbridled emotions, from being flushed with regret, anger and desperation, she grew with intensity, defiance and vulnerability"
720,7,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her resolve is one of strength and a moving emotional core that’s unshakeable while being present in every turn in Sunshine’s dilemma in which we met the most colorful and textured cast of unusual characters
720,8,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even with Racal’s stellar lead performance, every supporting actor also put on a remarkable stamp that not only served their scenes but also the entire story"
720,9,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"From Jennica Garcia to Annika Co to Elijah Canlas to Meryl Soriano to Xyriel Manabat to Angeli Bayani to Rhed Bustamante to Piolo Pascual, it’s perfectly casted and Jadaone made sure that they deliver a well-calibrated turn for Sunshine’s story"
720,10,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"A chilling and entrancing dissection of womanhood, the film shifts gears as a sports movie to a melodrama injected with some satire, absurdity, and a mystical element, it’s full of inspired creative choices that are in full concerto"
720,11,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"With its spectacular cinematography and production design from drab and somber interiors with a hint of natural light or sometimes depressing fluorescent light, to neon-tinged urban areas where chaos lingers just around the corner while also capturing Sunshine’s extraordinary close-ups behind window railings that cage her or framed by her vibrant pink ribbon; its outstanding sound design that puts Sunshine’s inner turmoil at the center of a noisy Manila and blends a surrealist element to its heart; and a formidable original music that juxtaposes Sunshine’s personality from her life as an gymnast to her personal life"
720,12,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is an urgent film that needs to be seen and heard, there’s power in its universality and Tonet Jadaone’s feminist voice soars with an elevated storytelling"
720,13,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Beaming with Filipino sensibilities and humour, its melodrama is used with beautiful intent while being grounded and playing with raw emotional reactions from the cast, and levity and grit in its screenplay"
720,14,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And as cliche as it sounds, it’s a totally different Jadaone that made this movie"
720,15,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There’s maturity that put her titular character at the center of a well-crafted film but there’s this restraint we haven’t seen before that refined the story’s message without ever being didactic
720,16,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Undoubtedly, her best film yet, an opus that cements her place as an important voice in Philippine cinema but also a landmark film that tackles subject matters that only a handful of Filipino filmmakers have touched on"
720,17,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"An absolute achievement in today’s climate of Filipino cinema, there’s power in its tone and its themes — a protest that exposes controlling hypocritical men and medical professionals, and an interrogation of a systemic inequality full of government’s shortcomings in giving proper care and support for unwanted pregnancies, in a place where poverty and overpopulation have been a decade-long problem"
720,18,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But also in Sunshine, we found hope and her light in confronting her reality while finding women who helped and listened to her, a kind of feminism that celebrates sisterhood even in the most horrifying circumstance in a woman’s life"
720,19,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"With high hopes, this should spark a conversation about women’s struggles and rights"
720,20,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In light of the overturning of Roe v Wade in the US, akin to Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Sunshine’s story is real and rampant in the PH, and as disturbing as it sounds, unsafe abortion have been killing 1 in 3 Filipinas each day"
720,21,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,—————This reminded me of a podcast conversation I once listened to about a woman talking to her mother at a time she’s getting to know her more as an adult
720,22,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She’s learning about her mom’s history and asked her if her mother ever wondered about living that life instead of having her
720,23,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Of course the mother responded that she’s happy that she’s born and she’s her child
720,24,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"To which she replied with, “if I didn’t happen, YOU would have been born"
720,25,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,”I think motherhood is beautiful but do you ever wonder what kind of woman your mother would have been if society gave them the rights to choose or their religion didn’t make them to aspire to fit into a mold of a woman
720,26,hellopaolo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maybe she could have been a president or she could have invented the cure to HIV/AIDS

721,1,mjvequi,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,that inn room scene
722,1,mikevandych,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Too often, films about abortion fall into the trap of emotional manipulation, when they push a specific agenda, reducing a complex issue to a simplistic, black-and-white narrative"
722,2,mikevandych,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,But Sunshine rises above that pattern
722,3,mikevandych,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Instead, the film offers a nuanced portrayal of the struggles (and even rage) experienced by women who are denied access to reproductive healthcare - told with such compassion and delicacy that you cannot help but empathize with and root for Sunshine because the conservative society has failed her"
722,4,mikevandych,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I hope many people get to watch the film because it is both a deeply personal and universal story that casts a light on one of the most pressing crises in the country: teenage pregnancy
722,5,mikevandych,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,And I also hope Sunshine ushers in a healthy and open conversation because women deserve the right to make decisions for themselves
722,6,mikevandych,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,This is the kind of film I’ll be thinking for days kasi ang bigat pero napaka-cathartic panoorin
722,7,mikevandych,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"And it features a talented (and reliable) ensemble of actors - napakahuhusay ng lahat, lalo na ng mga kababaihan"

723,5,anondrogynous,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It sent out a message, not by preaching, but by showing different realities faced by many, and trusted the audience to come to their own conclusions"
723,6,anondrogynous,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"If the reactions in the cinema were any indication, this has already started a conversation"

724,4,atomicdeadspace,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine, as a film and as a character, is bold and unwavering"
724,5,atomicdeadspace,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She doesn't preach or ask for pity
724,6,atomicdeadspace,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She doesn't beg for the forgiveness of her boyfriend or the religious
724,7,atomicdeadspace,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The story is clear all through out -- Sunshine has made her decision, and while she seeks understanding, she seeks it only from those who matter, not from the audience and definitely not from the holier-than-thou"
724,8,atomicdeadspace,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While Sunshine embarks on her journey to find answers, we never forget what she is -- a young girl in the Philippines, left to deal with the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy alone"
724,9,atomicdeadspace,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It is so easy to put the blame on women or on impulsive, lustful teenagers, but the film reminds us that in a country where religious biases trump teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality rates, pointing fingers helps no one"
724,10,atomicdeadspace,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film reminds us that for women and other marginalized sectors, the first line of defense against systemic neglect is community"

739,7,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But the structure of the film is far from chaotic despite the complicated and challenging subject Direk Antoinette Jadaone took upon herself to flesh out
739,8,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The stakes were high and indeed pushed the protagonist to do what she thought needs to be done
739,9,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her point was clear and warranted no further elaboration
739,10,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris Racal was stellar in her portrayal of an aspiring Olympian who got pregnant at the blossoming of her career as a young athlete
739,11,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The same can be said about the equally astounding young actress Annika Co who was a perfect foil to Racal’s character
739,12,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film, with its shorter than usual run time of barely an hour and a half minutes, didn’t hold back in driving its message, leaving nothing open for interpretation"
739,13,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Towards the end where Sunshine was performing her routine, I thought for a moment that her beaming towards the camera with her majestic ribbon would be the final shot of the film"
739,14,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But when the young Annika was shown watching Sunshine finish gracefully finishing her performance and embracing her when it ended, that was when I realized, gets ko na, that in this narrative, she would have a choice, one that's entirely her own"
739,15,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Direk Tonet has managed to make such a compact film about choice
739,16,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While choice for women is such a privilege in a conservative country like ours, there’s something powerful in showing that Sunshine made a choice, one that goes against the conventional"
739,17,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While other films of the same topic would leave it to the audience to ponder whether or not the protagonist would choose the controversial choice, Sunshine showed us that yes, she did that"
739,18,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"After the end credits have rolled, we were left staring at the black screen, perhaps, feeling fulfilled, weighed upon, or hungrier than ever for films of the same caliber"
739,19,tristanmdv,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is so monumental for Philippine cinema that it reaffirms one of my aspirations, that one day, Filipinos can have the choice about what films to watch in the cinema every weekend, not choose just either one—satisfying their physiological hunger or fulfilling the hunger of the soul"

751,22,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It trains the camera on Manila’s grime, decay, and nonstop noise, embracing its outcasts and harsh truths (the Lino Brocka comparisons are inevitable), just as it punctuates the gritty reality with a magical invocation via the imaginary friend that trails Sunshine"
751,23,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,“Media literacy” would tell you that the spectral presence is a representation of the internal-external friction the heroine deals with; fetus in the flesh and the body that refuses to carry it; the back-and-forth between morality and pragmatism
751,24,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"(Jadaone, in an interview with Filmmaker Magazine, revealed she was inspired by the imaginary character in Taika Waititi’s 2019 satirical drama Jojo Rabbit"
751,25,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,") But beyond this, the make-believe figure is a surrogate for the conservative, pro-life fraction of the audience, with the director opting to engage in the subject matter’s complexity instead of comfortably locating the film in an echo chamber"
751,26,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"While the narrative device could prove as an apparent play at sympathy, indulging in a “will she, won’t she” kind of thinking (surface-level reading could also suggest that women seeking abortion are deluded, ridiculous as that implication might sound), it also offers access to the broader violence disguised as “conscience” that puts women, regardless of gender identities, at a disadvantage"
751,27,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"If anything, Sunshine is less about the act of abortion itself than about the systems that encourage women to settle for dehumanizing rights already decided for them by a patriarchal few, systems that prohibit them from dreaming, and tell them that to dream only means more labor, nothing more"
751,28,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Sunshine, like Petersen Vargas’ Some Nights I Feel Like Walking (which made its Philippine premiere in June), harnesses the metropolis as a character of its own, instead of reducing it to a mere symbolic backdrop"
751,29,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Whereas Some Nights steeps its urban tale in neon erotica, completely absent of daylight, Sunshine shifts between the city’s diurnal and nocturnal environments"
751,30,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Pao Orendain’s camerawork here chiefly reaps magic from close-ups and interior shots, often framed from the window and dotted by a shaft of light (hence the Brocka sentiments), locating the viewer into the heroine’s intimate yet anxious state"
751,31,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The self-induced abortion scene in the sketchy motel, a sight casually interrupted by frantic railway noise, is particularly visceral that you can almost feel the texture of the image"
751,32,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The camera also draws focus to the irony that permeates Manila’s streets, particularly around the vicinity of Quiapo Church, where makeshift stalls selling figurines, scapulars, and all sorts of religious paraphernalia also offer abortion drugs and quack treatments, just as banners declaring “abortion is murder” remain a typical sighting"
751,33,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"In other scenes where Sunshine traverses the cityscape, the visuals are more straightforward"
751,34,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Accompanying the images is a soundscape that immersively mirrors the congestion, exhaustion, and urban din that form part of the DNA of the country’s capital"
751,35,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Jadaone’s script nearly leans on the miserablist
751,36,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"When Sunshine finds an opportunity to pull herself out of the vexing situation, poverty immediately gets in the way, leaving her with no choice but to ask her boyfriend for a meager P5,000 to secure the abortion drug and a cheap motel room to perform the deed herself"
751,37,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Yet even in Manila’s hospitals, the conditions are dire; patients are forced to share beds, and hallways are turned into makeshift wards, crowded by people in need of attention beyond the medical"
751,38,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Rape and casual prostitution also get in the way, as in the case of Menggay (Rhed Bustamante), the pregnant 13-year-old Sunshine comes across in Quiapo"
751,39,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"In a highlight moment, Sunshine, livid upon meeting her friend’s abuser, suddenly picks up a beer bottle and whacks it over the man’s head, before sprinting to escape the scene"
751,40,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"(Curiously, Jadaone plumbs the politics of self-determination by contrasting Sunshine’s ability to decide for herself with Menggay’s distance from that very sense of agency"
751,41,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,") Even the Quiapo vendors selling abortifacients, who some might think merely exploit the desperation of their customers, are also victims who simply don’t earn enough"
751,42,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Unflattering as these depictions are, it’s hard to deny that these aren’t routine realities in the social inferno that is the Philippines"
751,43,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Still, there is humor, whether in a scene that involves a knife interrupting a silly argument, or in another that sees a self-righteous doctor preaching the goodness of the divine"
751,44,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"As Sunshine, Racal delivers a performance that would be a disservice to reduce to neat superlatives"
751,45,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It’s a physical portrayal that required the actor to undergo training with national gymnastics coaches for nearly a year
751,46,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It’s a role that might put her in the center of another controversy after barely surviving the previous one
751,47,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"But just as Sunshine is asked to “drown out the noise” whenever she steps on the mat, Racal distills every layer and emotion into a character that’s simply life-like, almost free from the veil of performance-making"
751,48,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Jadaone once told me that her ideal lead performance is one that “is part of something bigger than herself
751,49,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,” There has not been a more worthy portrayal in local cinema this year
751,50,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"At the same time, the movie functions as a reintroduction to the boundless talent of Jennica Garcia, who plays Sunshine’s elder sister, a single mother trying to keep everything intact"
751,51,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Her portrayal expertly captures what a supporting performance should be—one that has enough screentime to be an emotional anchor for the lead but also generates her own moment
751,52,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,There’s a kind of invisible labor informing the character that Garcia encapsulates with an onscreen presence that always feels grounded and never incidental
751,53,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Sunshine is hardly a social exposé
751,54,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"What ripples throughout this partly winding urban tale is a ready, fatal fact about the place of women in this eternally eroded nation that we’d rather dismiss as “controversial” or “divisive” because we refuse to listen"
751,55,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The film’s visuals might be artful, but they don’t always convey a pretty picture"
751,56,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It’s no coincidence that the movie’s narrative throughline is the community that Sunshine finds in the women around her: her elder sister, her best friend (Xyriel Manabat), despite her initial inhibitions, her coach (Meryll Soriano), the young Menggay, the compassionate doctor (Angeli Bayani), and even the imaginary friend"
751,57,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Though this sense of solidarity comes at varying degrees, it keeps Sunshine afloat and does not let her think of herself as a monster for terminating an unwanted pregnancy"
751,58,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Once Sunshine nears its final shot, I keep thinking of Fan Girl’s insular ending that succeeds its heroine’s already exhausting journey"
751,59,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I’m glad to learn that our heroine this time does not succumb to sheer epiphany
751,60,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Here, hope actually feels like a tangible possibility instead of an unwarranted emotional wallop"
751,61,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Sunshine is perhaps not Jadaone’s most definitive work; That Thing Called Tadhana (2014) or Never Not Love You might claim that distinction
751,62,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,But it is her sharpest creation yet
751,63,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It took a whole lot of research and lived experiences to put this story on the screen
751,64,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It took a bit of time for the film to make its way back to where it started
751,65,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It’s a miracle that it even got the go signal to be screened publicly
751,66,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I can already sense all the hot takes and thinkpieces it will generate
751,67,baltarle,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,And I can only hope that it will be as meaningful as this

753,6,ukiyaseed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a very heavy film, but what makes Sunshine such a heartlifting film to watch is that she had the proper support system whether she decides to keep the child or not"
753,7,ukiyaseed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She gets to choose if she wants to carry the baby or not

753,9,ukiyaseed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film shows that women should at the end of the day, have the final choice in matters related to childbirth"
753,10,ukiyaseed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Oh and with heavy topic such as this, let women be the major voice in the storytelling"
753,11,ukiyaseed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is a powerhouse actress
753,12,ukiyaseed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadoane is a great writer and director and deserves all the praise in handling such a tough topic

760,2,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"”In this film, we follow Sunshine, a rhythmic gymnast and an Olympic hopeful, as she travels through Manila’s dark, narrow, grimy, and crowded streets and alleys in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy in a country where abortion is illegal"
760,3,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There are few parts of this film that really stood out to me because they made elevated the movie and made it more compelling
760,4,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The first part that I really liked is how the city became a living representation of this country’s oppressive stance against anything pro-abortion
760,5,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The city allowed us to have something tangible, to be able to relate to Sunshine’s struggles even more"
760,6,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Second, the magical realism aspect is also a highlight for me"
760,7,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Once it finally clicked what Ariana and Annika Co’s characters represented, I was blown away"
760,8,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,One common argument of those against abortion is that you are going to kill someone who’s probably gonna be a very important person
760,9,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And yet, we get Annika Co’s character"
760,10,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Through a very powerful performance we end up caring for this kid
760,11,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But once you start to realize who she us and who she represents, you start to realize that she’s not just an extension of Sunshine but a representative of all babies born to mothers forced to carry a child"
760,12,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She and these babies are vessels forced to carry the unfulfilled dreams of their mothers

760,14,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” And that line broke me
760,15,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The argument is always, “We are not fulfilling someone’s potential if we abort them"
760,16,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” but there’s always a failure to acknowledge that forcing someone to bear a child is also not allowing them to fulfill their potential
760,17,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The last part that stood out to me is Maris Racal’s great performance
760,18,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She is the movie
760,19,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Without that performance, this film will fall apart and she delivers"
760,20,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What this film did is humanize a debate that’s usually so contentious it ends up being too one dimensional
760,21,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It made the debate more accessible to every one
760,22,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The movie is unflinching and raw
760,23,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"A harsh criticism of a society and culture who despite being always proud of their women, continues to fail them by continuing to enabling oppressive systems that mostly targets women"
760,24,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A big middle finger to a society that still strongly reeks of misogyny
760,25,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It also an exploration of the country’s broken healthcare system
760,26,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This film is a celebration of female friendships and sisterhood
760,27,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The people who helped Sunshine in her journey are women
760,28,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It forces you to be uncomfortable
760,29,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It forces you to think and have empathy
760,30,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This film is highly relevant and should be a required watching for everyone
760,31,mobirebyu,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Probably one of the most important Filipino films ever made

820,8,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Antoinette Jadaone’s intentional direction on making some scenes too loud, too chaotic, and far too overwhelming added to the personification of Sunshine’s mind; scrambling, panicking, terrored"
820,9,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It was not just Quiapo’s busy streets, it was also Sunshine’s trembling heart"
820,10,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But in between the anxiety and fear, Sunshine gathers the courage to try making a choice—even amidst the confusion"
820,11,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine finds out in the harshest way possible that a choice is not an option
820,12,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She is put in a situation where the only way out is to give in to ‘sinful’ acts, dangerous pills, and death-defying abortion attempts"
820,13,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"For a young teenager whose dreams seem too far from where she is, this is the only way"
820,14,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While many expect this decision to become the climax of the movie, Sunshine’s story is far from over"
820,15,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In my understanding, the film explored her conscience through Annika Co’s beautifully done character"
820,16,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It reminded the audience that while women consent to abortion, they are still carrying its moral burden"
820,17,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Annika’s character became an instrument to make women who seek abortion feel human, with human conscience and sensibilities"
820,18,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But it was done with such care, careful enough not to make it counterproductive but rather stuck in the ideology of the system that she grew up in"
820,19,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, Annika’s character is only a personification of Sunshine’s chaotic mind, making Sunshine her own companion to her dawning journey"
820,20,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This character becomes Sunshine’s comfort in the dangers of her abortion attempts, showing the deeply awful and tragic realities many women face; alone in rotting walls of the city, drowning out the noise, and daring to dream bigger than the spaces they are subjected in"
820,21,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But what makes this movie even more special is that it did not let Sunshine go through it alone
820,22,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While the movie was an avenue for telling the reality, it also became a source of hope for many women, especially for young ones who will watch it"
820,23,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There will be other women supporting them in their decision, other women who will not judge them for their choices, and other women who will create a safe space for them—at least in ways that they can, in the rotting system we have"
820,24,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Finally, Sunshine does not just urge the system to give women the rights to their own body; it explicitly explains what women go through in the struggles that we speak of"
820,25,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It does not undermine the calls for a systemic change, but it brings you the stories behind why a choice is necessary"
820,26,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It opens you to a narrative that does not just agree to progressive actions, but puts the heart in it"
820,27,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And in between those narratives, the movie reminds us that women are more, that they deserve to take up more space"
820,28,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Women are dreamers, they have ambition, they are complex, cohesive, and compassionate"
820,29,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Women are more than their mistakes, their stories go beyond"
820,30,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And that is the essence of a choice; to let them dream
820,31,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,To free them from the shackles of an already oppressing society
820,32,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"To not dim their light and let them shine, like Sunshine herself"
820,33,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"To all the Sunshines out there, you are not alone"
820,34,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Be steadfast on your ambition and dare to dream big
820,35,kagitlingan,2025-07-24 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And you take up space even bigger

830,2,toriteriyakidon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But for Sunshine — How the movie depicted purchasing a pregnancy test kit in the Philippines = an act to get humiliated
830,3,toriteriyakidon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine, a teenage Filipina athlete forged to be an Olympian who had an unwanted pregnancy, was the sacrificial being for a story to be told"

830,7,toriteriyakidon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The movie happened right smack in the heart of Manila City — Quiapo
830,8,toriteriyakidon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It is an area known for a well-known Catholic Church and the surrounding kubols or booths of herbal medicines and potions for all uses — from seducing someone, cursing someone, to inducing abortion (or in Filipino, “pampawala ng kapit ng bata"

830,10,toriteriyakidon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine was very telling of the struggles of Filipinas
830,11,toriteriyakidon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But I think it’s globally reflective as well because it told the following things:1

831,1,sushipicks,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is more than a film about a teenage gymnast reaching for her olympic dreams
831,2,sushipicks,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it reflects the struggles, hopes, and quiet battles of countless young girls trying to find light in a world that often dims their shine"

898,9,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,ADDENDUM CHAR (i just can’t stop thinking about this movie after like a week) Sunshine is a story of hope entangled in reality’s shadow
898,10,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I’ve seen this film before—many times
898,11,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As a student, learning the theoretical aspects of medicine"
898,12,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As an intern, having actual encounters through interviews with women like Sunshine"
898,13,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And as a practicing physician, who trained to become an OB-GYN, completing many incomplete miscarriages—induced or not—removing what’s left of what we call products of conception"
898,14,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sometimes people call it products of misconception when they’re trying to be funny
898,15,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This movie didn’t just slap us with the sensitive issue of abortion
898,16,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It dissected so many layers of issues we need to talk about more often—and pondering them in reality is a mental and moral gymnastics at play
898,17,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I would love to discuss all of them one by one, but this is a movie review after all, not an essay on the dangers of lacking a solid law to protect our young women from the societal pressures of patriarchy and religion—pressures that push them into life-threatening situations, only to be blamed for doing something they had no real choice about"
898,18,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In short, fuck the system"
898,19,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s always been a mental gymnastics for me to decide how to approach situations like this
898,20,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And this movie is telling me exactly how
898,21,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Jennica Garcia’s character deeply resonated with me—from the way she calls Sunshine’s name so tenderly, to the way she assures her that she’ll be there no matter what"
898,22,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She reminds us that we all need at least one ate around us who looks after us despite everything
898,23,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"(She literally said, shouted even, BE KIND"
898,24,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,)Another character who lingered in my mind was the 14-year-old teenage mother
898,25,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Shoutout to the team for dressing her in something colorful—a subtle clue to her identity, only revealed later"
898,26,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She was one small character representing thousands of teenage mothers, who are becoming younger as the years go by"
898,27,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She also represented the vulnerable group prone to sexual abuse—the group we have somehow failed to protect
898,28,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I’d love to dissect each of the characters, but I’ll leave that to you"
898,29,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Instead, I’ll talk about Sunshine (last na, promise)"
898,30,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris Racal’s portrayal was a masterclass in character acting
898,31,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a fearless dreamer, full of dedication and passion to make that dream come true"
898,32,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She perseveres despite her family’s circumstances
898,33,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She’s also a believer, kind, and someone who truly cares"
898,34,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"You see it in the small things—like the way she makes the sign of the cross before her performance, or when she prays fervently in Quiapo Church to ask for guidance or forgiveness on the thing she’s about to do or not to do"
898,35,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And that’s the beauty of this film—it tells you so many things without saying so much
898,36,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It urges its viewers to talk about them because these are urgent matters
898,37,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maybe we’re still far from legalizing abortion, but this movie isn’t just about that"
898,38,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s telling us we have so many other issues to tackle
898,39,kennypmd,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In short, we need to protect the Sunshines—or this world will become darker than it already is"

900,4,1800milf,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The trailer already sets up the premise: an aspiring Olympic gymnast finds herself two months away from the qualifiers, and pregnant"
900,5,1800milf,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"What unfolds is not a cautionary tale, but a necessary, grounded story about the private cost of dreams and the impossible decisions women are often forced to make"
900,6,1800milf,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is not a conventional film

900,10,1800milf,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even if you haven’t experienced what she has, you feel it—because you are human, and perhaps more deeply, because you are a woman"
900,11,1800milf,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"When the credits rolled, it took a while before anyone in the cinema, including myself to get up and leave"
900,12,1800milf,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There was a heaviness in the room

900,17,1800milf,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I hope more people watch Sunshine and understand this side of womanhood, one that is constantly sidelined in the name of morality and ethics"

944,3,tresuhh,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Grabe ang effect lalo na sa mga babae, and how the women are always considered in the wrong and are always left alone"

956,1,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine listens
956,2,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It listens to the silence of shame, the dissonance of faith, and the quiet, aching resolve of a girl who simply wants to choose"
956,3,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s the kind of film that our deeply Catholic country isn’t ready for, but desperately needs"
956,4,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,That it’s showing in nationwide cinemas—not just tucked in the corners of a progressive film festival—feels like a small act of rebellion in itself
956,5,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Like Eliza Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, a film I often return to when thinking about stories of quiet resistance, Sunshine unfolds with restraint and tenderness, never sensationalizing what is already unbearable"
956,6,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But where Hittman’s film relies on cold urban detachment, Jadaone’s world breathes with a Filipino kind of chaos: loud horns, dim chapels, vendors selling herbal “solutions” beside icons of the Virgin Mary"
956,7,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s all there
956,8,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The hypocrisy, the hush-hush remedies, the weight of sin pressed upon young women’s shoulders before they even understand the language of their own bodies"
956,9,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is astonishing
956,10,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She carries the film with a performance so grounded, so lived-in, that she often feels less like a character and more like someone we know"
956,11,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A friend
956,12,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A cousin
956,13,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"A girl on the jeep beside us, clutching a bag, hiding her fear behind a tight grip and a brave face"
956,14,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her Sunshine is not loud, but she is brave"
956,15,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And perhaps bravery today looks exactly like this: choosing to take control of your life, even when the world tries to stop you"
956,16,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Jadaone’s direction is both intimate and distant, borrowing from the gaze of Brocka but infused with a distinctly feminine grief"
956,17,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"We see Sunshine from behind glass, from across alleys, as if we too are complicit in watching but not speaking up"
956,18,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Yet the film never loses its tenderness, even in its political anger"
956,19,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is not an easy watch
956,20,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But it is essential
956,21,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a country where reproductive rights are still cloaked in rosaries and stigma, this film asks us not just to look, but to sit, to stay, to listen"
956,22,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It doesn’t beg for permission
956,23,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It asserts presence
956,24,marckryancidro,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And sometimes, in a nation deafened by doctrine, that’s more than enough"

968,1,holdnogrudge,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i’ve already seen so many pro-choice films that greatly explore the difficulties of going through an abortion (never rarely something always, happening, etc) but i must say that it feels really different to watch a film like it made in your country"
968,2,holdnogrudge,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"because in the pro-choice films i’ve watched before, they’re usually either set in the old times where abortion was still illegal in their countries or set in a modern setting whereas the female lead needs to travel in other places/states to undergo abortion legally… but in sunshine, it’s set in the modern times or the living conditions of filipino people right now yet there’s still no place to go where abortion is accepted… which speaks a lot about the real life situation for women in our country"
968,3,holdnogrudge,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,women anywhere have to go through a lot to apply *the choice* that they’ve decided on
968,4,holdnogrudge,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"however, it is much much worse in the philippines as it’s a complete taboo and sometimes it feels like we’ll never see in our lifetime where abortion will finally be legal in the country…… so, it truly is a remarkable feat that we got a pro-choice filipino film now"
968,5,holdnogrudge,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"not only that because it’s directed by one of the most well-known directors, released nationwide, and promoted in mainstream shows and platforms"
968,6,holdnogrudge,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this film shedded some light to everyone and it was very much needed for every filipino woman out there

969,1,xianoquendo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Unflinching and soo affront—almost to a fault, but perhaps that's exactly what's needed for the Filipino audience"
969,2,xianoquendo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Still torn with how the film physicalized the unborn, especially that the film positions itself as pro-choice"
969,3,xianoquendo,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But surely, Jadaone delivers with heart, soul and, crucially, angst"

971,4,photoartbymm,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal brings sunshine with her strong and raw performance as the titular character, probably her most defining role yet"
971,5,photoartbymm,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Kitang-kita at damang-dama dito ang kanyang saya, galit, at hirap na kanyang pinagdadaanan"
972,1,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This film is, at its core, a well-intentioned and emotionally resonant film"
972,2,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It tackles difficult subject matter with sincerity, and for the most part, it does so with grace"
972,3,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, I found that the inclusion of fantastical or imaginary elements occasionally detracted from the weight of its core issues"
972,4,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While I understand the metaphorical ambition behind these stylistic choices as well as their function in softening the emotional blows with humor or levity, I believe the film is at its most powerful when it forgoes embellishment and leans fully into the raw intensity of its subject matter"
972,5,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In those moments, when it embraces the chaos, the pain, and the emotional urgency it really becomes something far more affecting and memorable, allowing the simplicity it strives for to emerge, though it’s often overshadowed"
972,6,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At times, the dialogue veers into overtly inspirational or didactic terrain, feeling more like affirmations meant to uplift than naturalistic exchanges between characters"
972,7,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s clear that the film doesn’t only aim to tell a story, it wants to educate, to empower, to stir social consciousness"
972,8,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Yet in doing so, it sometimes edges closer to the tone of an educational TV movie than a fully realized work of cinema"
972,9,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That’s not a critique of its moral imperative, it’s a film that should be shown in schools but rather an observation about its limitations as a piece of narrative storytelling"
972,10,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The emotional and ideological weight it seeks to carry isn’t always supported by the nuance or complexity that cinematic storytelling demands
972,11,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What grounds the film and gives it its most enduring power is its emotional core
972,12,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal delivers a performance of quiet strength and vulnerability, anchoring the film with remarkable consistency"
972,13,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Especially compelling is the subplot involving Rhed Bustamante’s character
972,14,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Without revealing too much, her arc resonated with me more deeply than the central storyline"
972,15,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It was heartbreakingly authentic, subtle, restrained, and profoundly human"
972,16,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In that thread, the film touches something honest and unflinching"
972,17,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I also admired Antoinette Jadaone’s formal restraint in certain key scenes, particularly her choice to mute the sound"
972,18,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a film so concerned with voice and expression, those pockets of silence carried tremendous weight"
972,19,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"They allowed the viewer a moment of stillness, a space for reflection and imbued the film with a haunting quietude that deepened the emotional stakes"
972,20,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That said, the film’s message doesn’t always land with clarity"
972,21,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"After a pivotal hospital scene, I overheard two audience members blame the protagonist for her choices, siding with the doctor who confronts her"
972,22,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That reaction, while anecdotal, reveals a significant shortcoming: the narrative may not have sufficiently challenged ingrained prejudices or prompted the kind of empathy it aspired to cultivate"
972,23,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It bravely addresses urgent topics- reproductive rights, bodily autonomy, the realities of being a young woman navigating unjust systems but the film doesn’t always sharpen these into a coherent or persuasive argument"

972,26,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Its flaws are born of ambition: the desire to inspire, to uplift, and to inform all at once"
972,27,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But perhaps empowerment doesn’t always need to be accompanied by joy
972,28,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sometimes, it is in the unvarnished confrontation of pain without fantasy, without consolation that we discover our deepest strength"
972,29,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I don’t mean to suggest the film ought to have ended in despair, but rather that its final act, which shifts into metaphor and closes with a success story, might have benefitted from something more grounded, more unresolved or ambiguous"
972,30,domfr_nc,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Real life rarely provides a clean arc, and in a film so rooted in truth, the ending felt almost too easy, too neat"

1027,2,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Definitely a film that will start conversations and something that will linger in thought even hours after watching it
1027,3,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This film - for starters, was really well-shot and well-edited"
1027,4,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,That was my first takeaway
1027,5,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Second, well-scored"
1027,6,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And when that credits rolled and I saw that Rico Blanco did it
1027,7,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The dots were connecting and with Maris Racal as the protagonist
1027,8,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Wow that was definitely personal maybe that’s why it was done so good

1027,18,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The way that that were balanced

1027,22,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They were supporting each others’ performances and maybe that’s why it became more effective as a script
1027,23,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The execution was phenomenal
1027,24,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Personally, I would have loved some bit more fleshing out by the third act, because I feel like the un-accustomed or laymen movie audience may not get it immediately with the execution of it and it would’ve been better with the topic at hand to be spoonfed a bit more (but not too much)"
1027,25,kuyaed,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But yeah this is more of a personal nitpick at this point

1040,2,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Indeed, although almost 50 years have passed between the two films, it's an unfortunate reality that women's rights in the Philippines still have a long way to go, with conservative Catholic values hindering its advancement"

1040,4,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Another Twitter post, however, posits that while Jadaone echoes Brocka in some ways, she ultimately diverges from him by virtue of her ""woman's instinct"" that also augments her narratives with an ""added layer"
1040,5,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,""" Obvious gender essentialism and identity politics aside, this is a sentiment that I'm keen on interrogating: what does it actually mean to have a female directorial sensibility, particularly in the vein of Antoinette Jadaone"
1040,6,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"An easy answer would be to look at the central conflict of Sunshine, that is, unwanted pregnancy, and that Jadaone opts for a female teenager as its main focalizer"
1040,7,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I'm pointing this out because trans men and intersex people can also get pregnant hence a pregnancy plot point would not inherently be women-specific (although there would surely be many overlaps), so it's Jadaone's directorial decision to create a female protagonist that imbues the film with intricacies of the female experience---how proceeding with motherhood would be career suicide for an athlete aiming for the Olympics, how Sunshine is constantly berated by self-righteous people she encounters, how society itself was built against female self-determination, and despite all these, how Sunshine finds small pockets of refuge in other women---a friend, a mentor, an inn receptionist, a doctor, an abused prepubescent, a sister---who are empathetic enough to understand her pain and conviction, and to whom she's equally compelled to reciprocate kindness whenever the situation permits"
1040,8,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Further, Jadaone digs deeper and finds the Catholic religious institution, itself a remnant of feudalism, as an underlying hegemonic force against women empowerment, so culturally embedded in Philippine society that Sunshine finds it wherever she goes, be it in the drugstore, in the hospital, in the university, in the sport that she loves, even in the man who got her pregnant"
1040,9,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Unfortunately, here is also where Jadaone's supposed female sensibility loses steam: religious guilt is so ubiquitous that even she is not aware that it limits her perspective, that instead of finding multiple angles of inquiry she instead chooses to hammer in the same anti-religious (therefore anti-patriarchal) talking point over and over and over again, even to the point of physicalizing the unborn children, a weirdly pro-life creative decision in a film that self-categorizes as pro-choice"
1040,10,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Heck, the film just assumes that the audience already knows about the economic facets of being a Filipino athlete so it makes no effort in examining it, nor is it concerned with how Sunshine and her family earn their money (nobody seems to be working"
1040,12,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"No, those aren't important; just focus on the fact that Sunshine is a woman and that she's oppressed because of it"

1040,14,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"My argument is that uncritical admiration for ""female sensibility"" is as dangerous as the patriarchy it contends with, and that it's the same liberal narrow-sightedness that applauds Jadaone's bravery for tackling taboo gender topics and turns a blind eye to her cowardice in heeding the pro-Palestine boycott of the Berlinale film festival in the same breath; what's the point of female sensibility if it is devoid of anti-fascist solidarity"
1040,15,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Perhaps Sunshine is actually a self-surrogate for the lengths Jadaone is willing to go through in pursuit of her career, and we're all just supposed to root for her because it's great that Philippine cinema is acknowledged and praised internationally, everything else be damned"
1040,16,gmcajayon,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And maybe I'm expecting too much from Jadaone, that I should just accept that her films are self-contained texts that will never reach the same kind of radicalism and depth as Brocka's (which is admittedly a high standard to reach), but deep inside I want to believe that she's capable of bolder, stronger filmic statements"

1070,17,odinofcodin,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I think (and maybe this is a reach), deliberate ang decision na pink and yellow ang official colors ng movie nato"
1070,18,odinofcodin,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I am a mark for this film
1070,19,odinofcodin,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I have no distance from it
1070,20,odinofcodin,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is a match between Jun Robles Lana and Direk Tonet as my favorite active Filipino filmmaker right now tapos crush ko na si Maris PBB days nya pa lang
1070,21,odinofcodin,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Of course I’m gonna love it
1071,1,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Sunshine (Maris Racal) is a record-breaking national athlete, but the film fails to show the weight of that achievement"
1071,2,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"She wears a tank top marked “Asian Games 2018,” and her coach (Meryll Soriano) warns her against complacency: “Balewala lahat ng gold mo sa Asian Games"
1071,3,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"”Since the Asian Games are held every four years, and Sunshine is about 19 or 20, this suggests she won multiple golds in 2018 — a rare feat"
1071,4,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"She would be gymnastics royalty, a media darling, likely the most successful Filipina rhythmic gymnast in history"
1071,5,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Yet the film doesn’t show her as a public figure
1071,6,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"No news clippings, no media buzz, no crowds—just a few kids asking for a selfie"
1071,7,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"It also focuses mostly on her ribbon routine, barely showing the hoop, ball, or clubs—all key to establishing her as Olympic-level"
1071,8,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Sunshine’s decision to abort is quick, and her fears and ambitions are underexplored"
1071,9,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The Olympics, in fact, feel more like her coach’s dream—the film tells us this but doesn’t show it"
1071,10,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"There’s no pressure from a country rooting for her, nor from sponsors who presumably funded her expensive training (which we’re left to assume, since rhythmic gymnastics is an elite sport)"
1071,11,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"No rival gymnast, no sense of competition, no major stakes, and no real glimpse into the demanding world of elite sport"
1071,12,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,All this undercuts the tension around her unwanted pregnancy
1071,13,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,Jadaone instead spends a chunk of screen time on soapy magical realism
1071,14,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"An imaginary, foul-mouthed child follows Sunshine around, mocking her decisions"
1071,15,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"But instead of adding insight, this character becomes repetitive and irritating"
1071,16,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Rhed Bustamante plays another pregnant teen, awkwardly inserted into the plot in an effort to cover too many sides of the abortion debate"
1071,17,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But Rhed’s more serious situation makes Sunshine’s dilemma feel shallow—like a story about a girl careless with sex and unwilling to face the consequences
1071,18,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Some visuals in Sunshine hit hard: abortifacients sold beside religious icons outside Quiapo Church—a jab at how the Catholic Church, in practice, is more ritual than moral compass"
1071,19,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,There’s also a grim motel scene
1071,20,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,But these moments can’t save the film
1071,21,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Set in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, where abortion is illegal, Sunshine tries to raise issues around teen pregnancy and reproductive rights, like overcrowded maternity wards"
1071,22,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"True enough, the Philippines has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Southeast Asia, especially among the poor"
1071,23,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"But if a film brings this up, it must give some context"
1071,24,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"The Reproductive Health Law, passed only in 2012, was meant to help—but the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) continues to fight tooth and nail against sex education and birth control"
1071,25,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The film ignores all this
1071,26,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"Instead, it gives us a cartoonish, Bible-thumping doctor and a patriarchal pastor—villains standing in for real problems"
1071,27,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"We don’t expect to be spoon-fed, but when a film enters controversial ground and hints at bigger issues, it has a duty to avoid shallow symbols"
1071,28,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"In the end, Sunshine parrots Western slogans like “My body, my choice” without anchoring its stance in the Philippine context"
1071,29,tepmayo,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,The message feels imported and emotionally flat

1089,2,julsbatuang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s gritty yet poignant, a dichotomy facilitated by careful restraint in its direction, intricate cinematography, and Maris Racal’s stellar performance"
1089,3,julsbatuang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film deflects clichés observed in Filipino melodramas that often rely on overly oppressive emotional tropes and techniques
1089,4,julsbatuang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Most notably, it veers away from positioning religion or the Church as a central source of female agency"
1089,5,julsbatuang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Instead, it presents it as an androcentric institution where permission for a woman’s reproductive health decisions must be sought, implying a strong assertion of control and dominance over women’s bodies"
1089,6,julsbatuang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Set against the backdrop of bustling, grunge-textured Manila, the camera takes a remarkable grasp on the parallelisms and minutiae of everyday life in the cruel city: a crowded train moving across the metro juxtaposed against a dreary room in Avenida; an abortifacient vendor sitting by a display of Mary Magdalene busts she sells in Quiapo; a tight-knit community devoid of love and empathy for a child"
1089,7,julsbatuang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film refuses to paint the gaps and seams of a faulty society in broad strokes

1089,9,julsbatuang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It deeply delves into the nuances and detailed complexities of living in a Christian society that has, ironically and deliberately, chosen to position women’s rights on the periphery"
1089,10,julsbatuang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It taps into female solidarity as a form of agency and collective resistance, offering both an idealistic and pragmatic antithesis to the marginalization they have long been experiencing"
1089,11,julsbatuang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Reminiscent of Antoinette Jadaone’s pre-studio works such as Plano (2004) and Saling Pusa (2006), Sunshine feels like a beautiful work of personal musings"

1092,1,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,I think it's safe to say by now that Antoinette Jadaone is one of the greats of Philippine Cinema
1092,2,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"And not just of now, but of all time"
1092,3,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"The still-young filmmaker, who cut her teeth on quirky indie comedies ( Six Degrees of Lilya Cuntapay, Beauty in a Bottle) soon became the new queen of Pinoy Romantic Comedies, resulting in an 8-films-in-5-years streak that included classics like That Thing Called Tadhana, Never Not Love You and Alone/Together"
1092,4,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Then in 2020, something changed"
1092,5,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"At the height of the pandemic, Tonet released Fan Girl -- an unflinching, searing commentary on celebrity worship, toxic masculinity and patriarchal oppression in the Philippines"
1092,6,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It not only won all the major awards during that year's MMFF, but was also the highest-grossing film for that year"
1092,7,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"This makes Tonet somewhat of a unicorn: a writer/director who can make socially relevant, intelligent cinema but at the same time kill it at the box office"
1092,8,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,This feat is especially astounding in a year when zero films have actually made money
1092,9,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"And so that six-year streak turned into a five-year absence, and wisely so"
1092,10,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Tonet channeled her creative juices towards other roles and mediums: television, streaming, producing"
1092,11,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"I'm a big believer in taking care of one's filmography, and she's doing just that"

1092,13,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Hello, Sunshine"
1092,14,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Sunshine follows a slew of, and there's no non-blunt way to put it, abortion movies that have come to the fore in the 2020s"
1092,15,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,You have the US's Never Rarely Sometimes Always and France's L'Événement
1092,16,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,All films follow the internal struggle and loneliness that women face when going through the abortion process
1092,17,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Of the three, Sunshine is the most powerful for one simple reason: it's set in the Philippines"
1092,18,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"And while it hits home because it is home, the oppression, hypocrisy and outright strangeness of the system makes this abortion story unique"
1092,19,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"It's a country where you can find ads for abortives just buy typing in ""abortion"" in your instagram search terms, where a vendor of Catholic paraphernalia situated outside a church will also peddle Cytotec, where a doctor who saves your life will also give you a 5-minute telling-to once you're well enough to listen"
1092,20,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It's a country where self-righteous sanctimonium has endangered millions of young women's lives
1092,21,quark,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Sunshine is pro-choice, but it's also pro-life"

1272,8,roynarra,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Tungkol ito kay Sunshine (Maris Racal) na naghahanap ng paaran na magpa-abort dahil sa napakaraming rason: hindi planado ang kanyang pagbubuntis, ayaw siyang panagutan ng nakabuntis sa kanya, ayaw na siyang samahan ng kanyang kaibigan, pagtsi-tsismisan siya, at mauudlot ang kanyang pangarap na maging Olympian"
1272,9,roynarra,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Sa dami ng kanyang rason, simple lang naman ang kanyang dahilan: ayaw pa niya maging nanay"

1272,13,roynarra,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Intersectional din ang pagtalakay ni Jadaone sa isyu ng abortion sa Sunshine
1272,14,roynarra,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Hindi ito basta-bastang women's rights na nakita natin sa Western media tulad ng Barbie (2024) at Sex Education (2019-2023)
1272,15,roynarra,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Hindi itinanggi o dinemonize ng pelikula ang Catholic guilt pero hinimay ito sa pamamagitan ng pag-humanize nito sa anyo ng batang babae na sumusunod kay Sunshine (Annika Co)
1272,16,roynarra,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Ang ganda ng chemistry nina Maris at Annika at ramdam mong iisa lang talaga sila
1272,17,roynarra,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"So, bakit nga ba dapat panoorin ang Sunshine sa sinehan imbes na hintayin sa Netflix o ano mang streaming service"
1272,18,roynarra,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Napakalalim ng isyu ng aborsyon at women's rights na dapat bigyan ito ng full attention

1339,5,dennisperez,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This voice becomes a haunting reminder of who she is and who she is expected to be, grounding her in an innate moral compass even as she’s pulled deeper into chaos, anxiety, and confusion"
1339,6,dennisperez,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine presents a world where the pursuit of dreams comes at a cost, and where ambition blurs the lines between resilience and ruin"

1392,3,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In the film, we follow nineteen-year-old Sunshine, who has dedicated most of her life, along with the support of her sister who was also a former gymnast, in rhythmic gymnastics and her pursuit to enter the Philippine team for the Olympics"
1392,4,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, several weeks before the National tryouts, Sunshine discovers that she got pregnant after a recent sexual encounter with her boyfriend"

1392,7,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"All of these are further amplified in the situation here in the Philippines where sexual education is still not a priority, access to quality maternal care is expensive, and role of religion to beset unfair expectations towards women"
1392,8,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Despite having a strong message, there are things in Sunshine that I wish had been improved on"
1392,9,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I must admit I felt a bit cheated out because the movie was initially hyped as a sports movie focusing on gymnastics - the same way Rookie did for volleyball, but in the end was more of a character drama that whose lead character is a gymnast"
1392,10,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I wish that Jadaone delved deeper on Sunshine’s motivations on why gymnastics is important to her because at how the story was written, Sunshine could’ve played any sport and the story would remain the same"
1392,11,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Before I get called out, I know the movie’s true intention is a commentary on the state of female reproductive health in the Philippines, but I felt like it was just a missed opportunity to highlight the state of female sports in the Philippines, particularly gymnastics because Filipino sports movies are so rare"
1392,12,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I also felt like that the script could’ve been tightened up a bit as the elements of magical realism introduced in the story (without going too much in spoiler territory) didn’t land as much in terms of story logic
1392,13,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As a follow-up to her lead starring role in 2023 movie Marupok AF, Maris Racal continues to be one of the promising actresses of her generation"
1392,14,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And in Sunshine, she delivers one of her career best performances so far, especially at lengths her character goes through and in the dedication to train of the gymnastics segments of the story"
1392,15,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Overall, Sunshine is not an easy watch because it doesn’t mince the hard truths of how it is living as a woman in the Philippines"
1392,16,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And now with with the ongoing female reproductive health and sexual education discussion in the Philippines, Antoinette Jadaone offers a strong message on why it is imperative that protections for women’s health should be passed, and why the movie Sunshine deserves your time and your attention"
1392,17,carlcuevas,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, irony that this movie can only be seen by a limited number of people because of its R16 rating as well as the unfair cinema practices in the Philippines, makes this even more frustrating"

1500,7,mfcarandang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Throughout the film, Sunshine’s emotional arc—marked by anguish, desperation, and vulnerability—lays bare the reality where women’s access to safe choices is morally questioned and legally denied"
1500,8,mfcarandang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This taboo isolates her: abandoned by friends and her partner, judged by doctors, and pressured by her coach to give up her dreams"
1500,9,mfcarandang,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Social stigma is one, but the films also highlights how poverty and consequently, sexual miseducation put into question the dignity of women"

1510,8,prdgldd,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Mahusay ang pagpapakita ng Sunshine sa iba't ibang impyernong dinaranas ng kababaihan: personal, panlipunan, pisikal, mental, pinansyal, sekswal, at, higit sa lahat, pulitikal"
1510,9,prdgldd,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Ramdam ito sa bawat eksena kung saan galit, pag-aalala, at pagod ang namamayagpag sa mga linya, ekspresyon, imahe, at tunog"
1510,10,prdgldd,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Pati nga mismo ang kalagayan nito bilang pelikula ay isang impyerno rin: ang masalimuot na danas nina Direk Tonet sa paghahanap ng distributor, ang katotohanang madalang abutin ng mga ganitong pelikula ang mainstream consciousness ng mga Pilipno, ang mabilis na pagliit ng bilang ng mga sinehan na nagpapalabas nito, at ang nagbabadyang diskurso na tiyak na magiging mapaghati"
1510,11,prdgldd,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Samakatuwid, ang pelikula mismo ay dumaan at patuloy na dadaan sa impyernong ginawa ng patriyarka"
1510,12,prdgldd,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Ipinapakita ng Sunshine na mula noon hanggang ngayon, kababaihan ang umaako sa responsibilidad na hamunin at buwagin ang patriyarka"
1510,13,prdgldd,2025-07-25 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Kaya sana mapanood ito ng mas marami pang lalaki, lalo na kung hindi pa sila mulat sa realidad ng kababaihan, mga batang ina, at mga biktima ng sekswal na karahasan"

1515,2,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,no regrets because this might be antoinette jadaone’s magnum opus yet
1515,3,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,sunshine (2025) had no metaphors and subtle parallelisms: it screams that a woman’s autonomy is her own
1515,4,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"a very straight-forward, well-thought of, and a passionate piece about how a woman was made to struggle the moment she was born by the system and how it’s designed to take away her ownnes"
1515,5,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this is true for everywhere else in the world; but much more significant in the context of a third world country such as the philippines
1515,6,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"abortion is a controversial topic in the country, to say the least"
1515,7,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it is seen as a violation to the sanctity of life—a sin to remove a clump of cell in a human body
1515,8,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"swayed by the biblical texts and the catholic church, abortion is illegal in the country"
1515,9,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"but for women like sunshine and mary grace, the law does little to stop the reality: it only pushes them to do the act in shadows, where the only option is unsafe and risky"
1515,10,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the religious references throughout the film were palpable: from the jeepney that sunshine rode to quiapo bearing the sign that says “gift of God” to sunshine’s physical manifestation of her conscience in the form of her would-be child—which shows an inner conflict between her faith and survival
1515,11,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,these references do not seem disrespectful but rather an emphasis on how deeply stitched sunshine’s struggle to catholicism is
1515,12,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it’s a critique on how the bible is weaponized to police a woman’s choices and her bodily autonomy
1515,13,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i want to make a point on the healthcare system too which the film really did a good job criticizing: with all its faults, the healthcare system is biased against women"
1515,14,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the lack of access to safe procedures, institutional neglect, and moral policing (made by professionals, mind you) leave women like sunshine and mary grace with nowhere to turn"
1515,15,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the lack of quality healthcare in the country is so normalized that it leaves everyone no dignified options to address even their basic needs
1515,16,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"a perfect film that paints intersectionality so well: women from different sectors, despite having the same oppressor, face different realities"
1515,17,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it did not sensationalize abortion but it gave the audience another angle to look at it from; in a perspective that’s raw and honest
1515,18,salingpusa,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i was crying at the end (#that scene) because in spite all this, she prevailed"

1582,7,legendaryl06,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Jadaone may have placed rhythmic gymnastics in the background but it excellently serves as a metaphorical tool to describe the ebb and flow of Sunshine's life
1582,8,legendaryl06,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We see her struggles pitted against conservativism and arguable morality in a country where religion and patriarchy rule and shackle

1582,11,legendaryl06,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Racal, with her sharp strength and vulnerability, is utterly commendable but so is her supporting cast - Jennica Garcia and Meryl Soriano as her strong-willed yet nurturing older sister and coach respectively, Annika Co as her unborn child manifestation (an unpredictable plot twist that eventually made sense), and even the cameos from Madeleine Nicolas, Angeli Bayani, Angie Castrence, Elijah Canlas, and Piolo Pascual fulfill their impressive character actor repertoire"
1582,12,legendaryl06,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Some arcs and scenes could have been fleshed out because it's got a premise worth exploring but the Philippine censorship may have played its upper hand to prevent the film's full bloom
1582,13,legendaryl06,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In the same vein of ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days"", ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"", and ""Happening"", it may not be everyone's cup of tea due to its hefty topic and open-endedness but it's a delight to see an important Filipino film that fearlessly opens the conversation to empower women more on making their own reproductive choices, even with the deafening noise and outdated discourse"

1619,43,sanenotsane,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It showed how distant she probably felt from her faith or how unworthy she thought she was in that moment
1619,44,sanenotsane,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,That kind of framing really hit me

1647,16,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and that’s where the power lies
1647,17,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the film knows the violence doesn’t start when a woman decides to abort
1647,18,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it starts when the state tells her she can’t
1647,19,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"when even in the face of trauma, poverty, or kahit simpleng “hindi ko kaya"" o ""ayoko,"" the answer is always “wala tayong magagawa"
1647,20,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,""" sunshine sits with that anger"
1647,21,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,nire-recognize niya na ang lack of choice ay isa lang sa napakaraming anyo o mukha ng systemic violence
1647,22,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,patunay ito of how the law protects an imagined morality while punishing the actual living woman
1647,23,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and yes, this film is very aware that class makes all the difference"
1647,24,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,hindi lahat may access to private clinics or doctors willing to take the risk
1647,25,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"karamihan, kung hindi lahat, gaya sa pelikula ay sa quiapo ang bagsak"
1647,26,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,o kaya naman hilot
1647,27,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"'yung iba wala talagang means & are forced to be victims of the way laws, culture, and religion collude to trap women into roles they never asked for"
1647,28,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and that matters
1647,29,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,because the way we talk about abortion in this country is always so detached from those realities
1647,30,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,laging hypothetical
1647,31,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,laging abstract
1647,32,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,laging nakadikit sa spiritual na paniniwala
1647,33,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"but sunshine shows that for many women, hindi lang siya tungkol sa pagkakaroon ng choice o sa moralidad kundi buhay at kaligtasan din nila mismo"
1647,34,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,literal na tinatanggalan sila ng basic human rights
1647,35,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,ang sarap himayin ng pelikulaaa especially 'yung subplot tungkol doon sa 13-yr old girl tapos isampal 'yun sa mukha ng mga taong hindi magawang ilabas ang sarili nila sa personal nilang mga baluktot na paninindigan
1647,36,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,ig the best part for me is how sunshine never tries to justify
1647,37,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"likeee it doesn’t go “look, she had no choice,” or “she’s a victim, kaya understandable"
1647,38,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” no
1647,39,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it says na kahit may support ka, kahit privilege ka, kahit hindi ka biktima, may karapatan kang pumili"
1647,40,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and that, for me, is what makes it a GREAT feminist film"
1647,41,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,hindi siya nakikiusap sa audience na intindihin si sunshine
1647,42,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it tells you, plainly, na she owes you nothing"
1647,43,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and maybe the most haunting part of this film is how it visualizes the weight of that decision
1647,44,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,hindi bilang guilt or punishment but as memory
1647,45,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the film doesn’t erase the what-if
1647,46,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it shows you that even when a choice is right, it doesn’t come clean or easy"
1647,47,aegyu,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and that doesn’t make it wrong

1759,4,macnfilm,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What hit me the most was how the film didn’t try to be loud or preachy
1759,5,macnfilm,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film doesn’t try to romanticize or a free promotion for abortion

1766,3,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"May tiwala ako sa kakayahan niyang gawing matula ang trahedya, at gawing tahimik pero mabigat ang mga sigaw ng kababaihan sa lipunang laging inuuna ang hiya kaysa sa hustisya"
1766,4,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Isa sa mga personal na dahilan kung bakit ako nanood ay dahil gusto kong unawain—hindi man buo, pero kahit konti—kung ano ang dinadala ng isang babaeng katulad ni Sunshine"
1766,5,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Bilang isang assigned male at birth, pero hindi ganap na komportable sa label na iyon, alam kong may distansya sa pagitan namin ni Sunshine"
1766,6,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Pero iyon mismo ang dahilan kung bakit ako nanahimik sa sinehan
1766,7,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Tumigil akong mag-analisa, at hayaan ang pelikula na magsalita para sa sarili nito"
1766,8,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hindi ko kailangang maging babae para makiramay
1766,9,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Pero gusto kong makiramdam
1766,10,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At dito, sa pelikulang ito, nagtagumpay akong maramdaman si Sunshine—ang kanyang pagkalito, galit, at takot—na para bang sarili kong laman-loob ang kinikiskis ng eksena"
1766,11,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At sa prosesong iyon, nadama ko si Sunshine—ang pagkalito niya na hindi simpleng pagkaligaw, kundi paglalakad sa isang landas na sinabihan siyang bawal"
1766,12,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ang galit niyang hindi mapagsigawan, at ang takot niyang hindi inamin, pero nandoon sa bawat kumpas ng katawan niya"
1766,13,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris Racal didn’t just play Sunshine—she inhabited her
1766,14,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She carried her, as if every scene weighed heavily on her spine, even when she stood upright"
1766,15,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,May mga eksena na walang dialogue pero mas mabigat pa sa sigawan
1766,16,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,At doon ko nakita ang mastery ni Maris bilang aktres: ang kakayahang magsalita gamit ang pananahimik
1766,17,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Nakakatawang may nagsabi raw sa likod ng kamera na “haggard” siya habang nagsu-shoot
1766,18,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I laughed—not because it’s funny, but because it’s too real"
1766,19,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ganito talaga ang hitsura ng kabataang babae na araw-araw tinatanggihan ang mundo, pero hindi puwedeng mapagod"
1766,20,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"May mga Sunshine sa Quiapo, sa mga post sa Reddit, sa mga comments na deleted, sa mga babae sa jeep na tahimik lang pero may bitbit na kwento"
1766,21,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And it takes a film like Sunshine to remind us: they are not voiceless
1766,22,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We just haven’t been listening
1766,23,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Unang tingin kay Annika, iisipin mong comic relief siya"
1766,24,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Isang batang gumugulo sa eksena, parang pang-balanse sa bigat ng naratibo"
1766,25,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Pero habang tumatagal, na-realize kong siya pala ang pinakamatining sa lahat"
1766,26,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hindi siya ordinaryong karakter—siya ang konsensya ni Sunshine
1766,27,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Hindi ang moralistic kind, but the invasive kind"
1766,28,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Yung konsensyang hindi laging tama o mali, kundi nagtatanong: “Nasaan ka na"

1766,32,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kasi hindi ba ganoon din ang konsensya
1766,33,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It creeps in when you're alone
1766,34,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It arrives uninvited
1766,35,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a country where abortion is taboo, Annika becomes more than a person—she’s a presence"
1766,36,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A question
1766,37,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"A symbol of possibility and loss, but not in a way that condemns"
1766,38,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She’s not there to judge Sunshine, but to make us feel what it means to carry a choice you can’t share with anyone"
1766,39,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sa isang bansang ang moralidad ay naka-template mula sa pulpito, ang pagkakaroon ng karakter tulad ni Annika is radical"
1766,40,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hindi siya plot device
1766,41,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Isa siyang reimaginasyon ng konsensya—hindi para ipahiya ang babae, kundi ipaalala kung gaano kabigat ang dalahin sa lipunang pilit silang pinatatahimik"
1766,42,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ang Sunshine ay hindi pelikulang pro-choice dahil gusto nitong makipagtalo
1766,43,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hindi rin ito pelikula tungkol sa abortion dahil gusto nitong mag-skandalo
1766,44,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ito ay pelikula tungkol sa karapatan
1766,45,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sa kakayahang pumili, kahit pa masakit ang pagpiling iyon"
1766,46,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine doesn’t celebrate abortion—it honors the courage to face it
1766,47,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sa lipunang ang kababaihan ay kailangang laging malinis, laging mabait, laging matino, heto ang isang pelikulang nagsasabing: ang katawan mo ay hindi kasalanan"

1766,54,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is not a perfect film—but it is a vital one
1766,55,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And in a country that rarely gives women room to speak, a film like this doesn’t just feel brave"
1766,56,teriyak_,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It feels necessary
1767,1,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,""" Drown out the noise"
1767,2,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"""This line in the Sunshine struck me after watching the film"
1767,3,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Noise is considered as a plot device in the film literally and figuratively
1767,4,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I like how the background music or the noise from the background is used to set the tone and mood of the film especially in scenes where Sunshine is walking or riding a jeep home
1767,5,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Noise in the film can also represent the doubts that fill her while practicing and self-righteous religious people who judge her actions throughout the film
1767,6,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film is about a gymnast who plans to join the tryouts for the Olympics
1767,7,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, she receives a result that is unexpectedly pregnant which can hinder her chances in getting in"
1767,8,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is great in her role as Sunshine and I think that she embodies the role of a gymnast especially since she tried gymnastics to prepare for her role
1767,9,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There were scenes that were remarkable for me such as when she tries to hit a the mirror of a car after her boyfriend (played by Elijah Canlas) doesn't take responsibility for her pregnancy
1767,10,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I also loved the supporting characters as well
1767,11,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Despite their small roles, they made a mark for me"
1767,12,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"For instance, Jennica Garcia was impressive in her scenes with Maris Racal as her older sister"
1767,13,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,You can feel that she defends and protects her sister and stay by her side especially during her revelation that she is pregnant
1767,14,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Xyriel Manabat is no surprise for me since I admire her acting skills since she was a child actress
1767,15,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She is great as Sunshine's best friend
1767,16,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Annika Co, an upcoming child actress, is a scene stealer where she acts as a conscience to Sunshine"
1767,17,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She is charming and witty in her role and I think the twist made sense to me in one scene
1767,18,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In addition to it being a sports drama, this film also tackled the themes of women's choice and abortion"
1767,19,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,These topics are considered sensitive and taboo in a dominant Catholic and conservative society
1767,20,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As a man, this film moved me and realize how hard it is to be a woman in a society wherethey are judged for having an autonomy in their body"
1767,21,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a third world country, healthcare is considered a privilege especially for the poor"
1767,22,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Because of abortion being considered illegal and immoral, women are forced to resort to unsafe practices which can endanger them"
1767,23,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is shown in the film and I think it's interesting that it depicted two doctors: one which discriminates women because of her religious bias and one which tried to understand and helped another character in the film who turned to abortion
1767,24,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's a sad reality, but I'm glad that this film will open conversations about themes like these"
1767,25,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Overall, I find Sunshine an impressive film"
1767,26,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I think this is Antonette Jadaone's best film so far
1767,27,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's my second film that I've seen in cinemas and I'm grateful to witness it in the big screen because it is worth the watch there with its immersive experience
1767,28,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I was definitely looking forward to it since it's rare to watch a sports film which centers around gymnastics and it has been shown in film festivals abroad
1767,29,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I was worried that it won't be shown here because of how controversial it would be because of the stand of the Catholic Church and other religious sectors regarding abortion
1767,30,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I guess more people are more open-minded towards the topics unlike before
1767,31,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Aside from the acting, what I found compelling in the film is the cinematography and scoring which adds tension and mood to the it"
1767,32,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Despite its limited release and pitted against two superhero films during its premiere, I really hope more people will get a chance to watch this movie"
1767,33,migueltheangelo,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even if it shows the harsh realities of life and in sports, I agree with other film critics that it also shows hope"

1772,2,giopuyat,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"What I mean is not a single frame is wasted, or given up for style points - every decision of performance, framing and pace is made to serve the story, to make us empathize with Sunshine, to feel what she feels"
1772,3,giopuyat,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Woman vs the institution - the clarity of this theme is just so powerful, yet we’re brought into Sunshine’s world through masterful camerawork that just feels honest"
1772,4,giopuyat,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There’s a shot I love, where Sunshine is framed inside a window (in her room then in a motel), and the chaos of the city goes on about her, uncaring and apathetic to her situation"
1772,5,giopuyat,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That’s the whole movie - the slow-burning horror that she is being shunned by society, cramped into tiny spaces trying to survive"
1772,6,giopuyat,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It made me cringe to hear the chants of “Pilipinas” by the crowd in her performance at the end (the sad reality of Filipino athletes, unsupported in training yet celebrated in victory)Maris Racal’s best performance"
1772,7,giopuyat,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The care and dedication she brought to the role should be applauded

1773,5,comingofagemess,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and as much as i hate comparing directors, the rawness of each frame felt deeply “Brocka” but captured through the tenderness and gaze of a woman"

1798,1,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"SUNSHINE advances itself as a film about bodily autonomy in a nation that denies its very terminology, yet it does so through the insulated idiom of psychological realism rather than the concretised mapping of the material conditions that make autonomy, abortion, and girlhood existentially precarious"
1798,2,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"We are immersed in affect, but the structure underpinning these sensations is left either ambient or altogether unrendered"

1798,6,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Abortion is outlawed in the Philippines because it preserves state-church power and results in the reproductive labour of the poor as exploitable and their agency criminal, but to bracket class from the narrative—in a context where economic vulnerability is the foremost determinant of reproductive injustice—is consequential"
1798,7,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Instead, the endless deferral into mood, while expressive, is in itself a seductive alibi for political disengagement"
1798,8,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"I understand that this is a film of interiority—that the point is to reflect Sunshine’s constrained perceptual field—but her interiority is a response to economic realities that the film chooses to elude, and when the audience is asked to interpolate systemic weight from ambience without any clear depiction of how deprivation functions, what we get is an abstraction that parades as empathy, and from that abstraction, other evasions proliferate: the neoliberal myth of the meritocratic athlete, whose suffering must be understood as psychological strain rather than as infrastructural abandonment; the convenient fiction that ambition alone propels a body through state-sponsored regimes without subsidy or the material realities the film forgoes"
1798,9,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"To abstract oppression into psychic distress then, while refusing its logistical origins, is to risk reproducing the same symbolic economy the Church relies upon: one in which the body is meaningful only as a metaphor and a vessel onto which morality is projected"
1798,10,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,This aesthetic disposition of interiority is of course obviously a structure inherited from the exportable idiom of European festival realism where the trauma of the Filipina is depicted legibly for the global North
1798,11,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"From this perspective, it would make sense that the institutions that manufacture her precarity are rendered as emotional rather than historical, inviting the audience to feel with her but never to account—but by doing so, what emerges is not so much a Filipino film but a Filipino offering: an artefact of pain rendered in tones familiar to jurors abroad, a choice that aligns seamlessly with both (1) Jadaone’s career pivot into the international circuit, having premiered the film at Berlinale and TIFF, and (2) the film’s own final sequence: Sunshine performing her routine at the SEA games before a panel of foreign adjudicators, body taut and calibrated for approval by those who will never understand the weight of what she forfeited to arrive there"
1798,12,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"By naming these two parallels do we metabolise the rage of a system into something palatable and interpretable, and since both Jadaone and Sunshine must contort to be seen, in being seen, they are asked to become less what they mean"
1798,13,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Perhaps the question is not whether SUNSHINE fails as a film or recedes as an offering, but whether it was ever permitted the autonomy to be anything else—whether within the landscape of Philippine cinema, where funding is precarious, distribution systems anaemic, and state culture support present only for the films that do not threaten it, a film like SUNSHINE must already enter the frame pre-legibilised and pre-digested, its rage ironed out for export"
1798,14,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"This is, after all, by the admission of its own producer Bianca Balbuena, a film that delayed its domestic release in order ‘to premiere in top festivals [around] the world to create noise and curiosity’, with the implication that only through international approval could the film attain enough value to justify its own existence at home"
1798,15,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"Thus, to resist the very circuit that enables its existence is impossible, but recognising this sharpens our understanding of the conditions under which those evasions occur"
1798,16,robbgc,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,60.0,ltbx,"What we must ask, then, is what kind of complicity we are willing to forgive in a nation that punishes truth so severely that even its cinema must contort just to be heard"

1846,23,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,it doesn’t glorify
1846,24,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,it doesn’t argue

1846,31,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,and maybe we avoid them kasi nga masakit
1846,33,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,kasi hindi tanggap ng kultura at sistemang kinalakihan natin
1846,35,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,but that’s exactly why they need to be told
1846,36,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,what makes the film powerful is how intentional it is
1846,37,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"every frame, every silence, every turn it didn’t take"
1846,38,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,lahat may dahilan
1846,39,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,it could’ve been more clever
1846,40,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,it could’ve been more dramatic
1846,41,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,pero hindi siya nagpakitang gilas
1846,42,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"instead, ginamit niya ‘yung simplicity para tumama"
1846,43,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,para magpa-reflect
1846,44,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,para magpa-isip
1846,45,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,what i appreciated most was that it didn’t force me to take a side
1846,46,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"it didn’t try to tell me which choice was right, no matter what sunshine ended up deciding"
1846,47,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,it just asked me to listen
1846,48,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,to sit with sunshine
1846,49,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,to be there with her
1846,50,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"even when things were loud & messy, even when she herself didn’t know what to do"
1846,51,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"and sometimes, that’s all people need"
1846,52,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,not answers
1846,53,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,just space
1846,54,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,and empathy
1846,55,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,maraming empathy
1846,56,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Sunshine moved me to empathize in ways i didn’t expect i could
1846,57,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,gusto ko rin pala i-highlight kung paano naging karakter ang maynila rito
1846,58,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,magulo ang maynila
1846,61,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"minsan bitag, pero minsan daan palabas"
1846,62,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"minsan parang impyerno, pero minsan parang tanging lugar na may pag-asa"
1846,63,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"sunshine moved through its chaos looking for clarity, and somehow the city mirrored her confusion"
1846,64,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,klaustro ang mga eskinita pero may mga puwang
1846,65,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,noisy yet full of silences
1846,66,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"manila is hysterically cruel, yes"
1846,67,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"brutal sa babae, sa mahirap, sa pagod"
1846,68,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"pero sa likod ng lahat ng ‘yon, may mga sulok na mabait"
1846,70,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,marunong makinig
1846,71,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"may tenderness na hindi nagpapakita, pero nandiyan; in the people who care quietly, in the moments of stillness in between the noise"
1846,72,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"and god, maris"
1846,73,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,maris fucking racal
1846,74,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,this is hers
1846,75,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,this is every woman’s story
1846,76,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,she is a woman in every way that matters
1846,77,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,alam kong magaling na siya dati pa
1846,78,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,nakita ko na rin naman ang ibang trabaho niya
1846,79,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"but this time, iba"
1846,80,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"masarap sa pakiramdam na makita ang isang magaling na babae na hindi nakakabit sa loveteam, walang lalaking bitbit sa screen para lang matawag na lead"
1846,81,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"walang kilig, walang branding"
1846,82,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,sakanya lang talaga ito
1846,83,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,and that felt right
1846,84,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,that felt important
1846,85,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"the way she portrayed sunshine’s pain and stillness and quiet strength, it just hit"
1846,86,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,hindi siya umaarte
1846,87,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,she wasn’t trying to convince anyone
1846,88,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,she just was
1846,89,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"may mga eksena na wala siyang sinasabi, pero ramdam mo lahat"
1846,90,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"nakakaiyak siya, pero hindi dahil may music o linyang mabigat"
1846,91,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,nakakaiyak kasi totoo
1846,92,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,kasi hindi mo alam kung saan ka huhugot ng ginhawa sa pinagdadaanan niya
1846,93,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"totoong haggard nga siya buong palabas hahaha, and it just made so much sense"
1846,94,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,ganun talaga ang itsura ng babae na napagod na
1846,95,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,sa sarili
1846,96,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,sa mundo
1846,97,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,sa kakaisip ng tama
1846,98,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,sa sistema na walang binibigay na sagot
1846,99,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,and yet she kept going
1846,100,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,and yet she was still trying
1846,101,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"that look—the mess, the confusion, the exhaustion, that’s what a woman in the middle of a fight looks like"
1846,102,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,not dramatic
1846,103,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,just human
1846,104,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"maris, sa’yo talaga ito"
1846,105,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,no one else could’ve done it this way
1846,106,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,no one can take this away from you
1846,107,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,and i hope alam mo kung gaano kahalaga ang binigay mo sa pelikulang ‘to
1846,108,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"and the women around sunshine, sila rin ang puso ng kwento"
1846,109,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"sa mata pa lang ng bawat isa, kita mo agad"
1846,110,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,hindi sila filler
1846,111,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,hindi sila background
1846,112,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"si jennica garcia, si annika co, si xyriel manabat, atbp"
1846,113,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"pati yung mga sandaling lumitaw lang, ang doktor, ang bantay sa motel, yung pharmacist sa botika, yung babae sa quiapo, maski yung mga babae sa maternity ward"
1846,114,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,lahat sila may dala
1846,115,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,lahat sila may pinanggagalingan
1846,116,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,and they all stood with sunshine in one way or another
1846,117,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"iba-iba sila, pero iisa ng tinig"
1846,118,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,kababaihan ang nagdala ng pelikula
1846,119,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,kababaihan ang gumising sa kwento
1846,120,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Sunshine isn’t easy to watch, especially if you're a woman in this country— but maybe it’s not meant to be"
1846,121,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,kasi tunay na kwento siya
1846,122,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,and real stories don’t always comfort
1846,123,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,they challenge
1846,124,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,they disturb
1846,125,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,they demand something from you
1846,126,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,and that’s what this film did
1846,127,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,it made me feel
1846,128,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,it made me think
1846,129,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,sobrang ganda napasulat tlg ako ng review
1846,130,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,i had to sit with it for an hour or two
1846,131,ishamae,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,ang husay mo direk tonet
1847,1,philipilihp,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"May nag-uusap kanina sa likod ko habang nanonood ako pero hinayaan ko nalang kasi nasanay na ako, tapos sakto yung scene na sumunod is yung sinabihan si Sunshine na “drown out the noise”"
1847,2,philipilihp,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Okay lang sana eh kasi may libreng commentary ako, pero nung nalaman na ni Sunshine na buntis na siya, yung lalaki sa likod ko sinabi na “tatanga-tanga” siya"
1847,3,philipilihp,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Medyo nawalan ako ng focus sa panonood dahil sa narinig ko kaya lumipat nalang ako ng pwesto maya-maya
1847,4,philipilihp,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sobrang ganda ng paghandle ng movie na ‘to sa topic niya, lalo na sa bansang ‘to na sobrang sensitibo ng mga ganitong usapan kahit na hindi na naman sa ibang bansa, kaya malakas yung respeto ko sa lahat ng involved sa paggawa nito, lalo na si direk Jadaone, kasi kailangan natin ng mga pelikula katulad nito para makasimula ng pag-uusap at pagbabago sa bansang ‘to"
1847,5,philipilihp,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ang daming taong tumutol at humamon sa konsensya ni Sunshine sa iba’t ibang paraan, pagkontra sa kanya gamit ang relihiyon, ang batas, ang pera, ang kalalakihan, at iba pa"
1847,6,philipilihp,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Kada sulok ng Pilipinas may matatamaan, kasama na yung nakaupo sa likod ko, at dapat lang"
1848,1,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ang pelikulang ito ay tunay na isang sikat ng araw
1848,3,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Tumatagos ang sinag
1848,4,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Totoo siya sa pakiramdam
1848,5,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Dahil totoo nga siya
1848,6,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Totoo si Sunshine
1848,7,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Matatanaw mo lang siya kapag binigyan mo ng oras ang sarili mong huminto at pansinin ang paligid
1848,8,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Saka mo mapagtatanto: kasama natin siya sa bawat hakbang ng kasalukuyan
1848,9,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kahit sa gabi
1848,10,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kahit pa sa gitna ng unos
1848,11,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Isa siyang payak na reyalidad—nararamdaman sa dulo ng mga daliri
1848,12,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Parang singaw sa paligid; halos masamyo mo sa hangin
1848,13,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ganyan siya kasinsid
1848,14,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ganyan siya humihingi ng pansin
1848,15,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Patuloy siyang lumulusot kahit sa pinakamasisikip at pinakatahimik na puwang ng kaingayan
1848,16,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Siya ang bumabati sa bawat umaga
1848,17,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At kahit sa gabi’t hapon, may iniwang peklat—mga bakas na, sa paglaon, bumubuo ng mas malaking larawan"
1848,18,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Larawang pumupukaw sa atin tungkol sa mga madalas itinatanggi, pinatatahimik, isinasantabi"
1848,19,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Mga bagay na totoo, at tunay namang nangyayari—ngunit ikinukubli"
1848,20,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Tila bawal
1848,21,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Tila tabu
1848,22,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ngunit sila pala ang tunay na bumubuo sa bilog, ngunit nananatiling hindi kinikilala sa tatsulok ng lipunan"
1848,23,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,At ang tanging hangarin ni Sunshine: na maging isa ka sa “atin

1848,26,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Gets namin siya
1848,27,janeeel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sana, gets din siya ng iba"
1849,1,sznamorolls,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"this movie is one of the many stories of women that are failed to be heard, and one of the many reasons why i will always be for women's rights and choices"
1850,1,jelowatches,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As a pro-choice person in the healthcare field, this is a harsh and brave storytelling of the reality in the PH"
1850,2,jelowatches,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris is a star and the whole cast carried
1851,1,watsooonv,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"“My body, my choice"
1851,2,watsooonv,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” But is it really when your options of what you can do with it is stuck in a country overtaken by religion and politics stuck in the medieval times
1851,3,watsooonv,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine falls under one of my most favorite genres: social commentary by simply showing girls just trying to live
1851,4,watsooonv,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,You can see throughout the film that she’s just a girl
1851,5,watsooonv,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Asking Miggy for money, asking for help when she needs, acts on her impulse, has dreams and goals, using twitter and Reddit for research (#real), etc"
1851,6,watsooonv,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She knows she can’t take care of a whole ass child right now, all she can (and she should) do is to chase her dreams and make a career out of it"
1851,7,watsooonv,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Though you can also see that Sunshine doesn’t really hate the kid
1851,8,watsooonv,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She takes care of her the way she can– giving her money to get home, looking for her when she’s lost, protects her from adult themes (drinking, abortion, etc)"
1851,9,watsooonv,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"So her decision at the end, it’s not because she hates the kid, it’s because she loves herself"
1851,10,watsooonv,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"With the limited choices she had, she made the most out of her youth And what’s so wrong with that"
1851,11,watsooonv,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,With being just a girl

2020,1,annahmuhrray,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is more than a story of a promising teenager, it is an illustration of how women traverse a situation of compromise in which each option is seen as greed and demise"
2020,2,annahmuhrray,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Nonetheless, it was always Sunshine’s choice to choose Sunshine"

2022,1,drrnjhn_,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,ramdam ko ang mga binibitbit na emosyon ni sunshine sa bawat unat ng kaniyang katawan at sa pag kumpas ng kaniyang laso mula sa umpisa hanggang sa dulo ng pelikula

2024,7,elle_angel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i don't have enough words to properly review this because it did left me speechless
2024,8,elle_angel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this is so painfully real to many women—young and not
2024,9,elle_angel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i got out of that cinema still in dazed because it's that beautifully raw and brave
2024,10,elle_angel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i can't help but to think of my mom and her internal struggle with herself getting pregnant as a young woman when at that time, she was also dreaming the life she wanted just as much Sunshine did in this film"
2024,11,elle_angel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,we all dreamed and are still dreaming
2024,12,elle_angel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"this film gives me so much hope in everything good, despite the unfortunate events"
2024,13,elle_angel,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,what a film indeed
2025,1,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I can already imagine the discourse once marelease to sa VOD
2025,2,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"First of all, I think it is so bold of Jadaone to come up with a concept that is so simplistic yet so real and full of grit despite the subject’s thematic weight"
2025,3,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Abortion remains to be a debatable matter in the Philippines and opinions are always highly polarized among liberals and conservatives
2025,4,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Despite the country’s right-wing political ideologies, there are still calls from progressive groups urging the government to legislate better constitutions on health and reproductive rights for the benefit of those who need it most"
2025,5,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine happens to be one of these people
2025,6,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a dedicated gymnast and an aspiring Olympian
2025,7,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"With only a few weeks left to polish and brush up on her routine, she suddenly found herself in a bind that put her faith, morals, and self-worth to the test"
2025,8,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t let us stay in a hopeful frame of mind; rather, it propels us to empathize with the character and question whatever is wrong and fucked up with the system"
2025,9,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"When Sunshine found out she was pregnant, her first instinct was to get rid of it"
2025,10,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Pray it away
2025,11,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,End it even if it means drowning in a cycle of self-destructive behaviors
2025,12,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It was clear from the very start she didn’t want to push through and she held onto that
2025,13,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I guess that’s as far as I can go for now so as to not give away too much of the plot
2025,14,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I watched this alone sa sinehan kanina and as soon as the credits rolled, i overheard someone sa likod ko saying na ‘bitin’ daw, and i totally get the sentiment that maybe for some people medyo half-baked or kulang ang storya"
2025,15,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But sometimes, films don’t have to be loud in order to hit the right spots"
2025,16,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"With its very straightforward premise and message, I think Sunshine deserves the amount of hype it’s getting"
2025,17,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The sports industry is already overwhelmingly taxing and having to face added burdens brought about by unwanted pregnancy can be way more damaging than one can fathom
2025,18,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is not a film that will convince you to change your moral and political convictions; rather, it clings to the little hope of making the audience understand that the dilemma Sunshine had to face isn’t something that exists only in the reel world, but something that is very much present in the real world—in a society where bodily autonomy often comes at a social cost"
2025,19,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Above all else, one thing’s clear is we really need better and safer reproductive laws in the Philippines so women wouldn’t have to go through under-the-table practices that put their lives on the brink of death"
2025,20,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, with the current political climate, i guess it’s realistic to assume we’re still a little far off"
2025,21,kitchienadoll,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But with films like Sunshine, I’d like to think there’s still an ounce of hope for our country to perhaps embrace ideals that give primacy to women’s autonomy and rights, at the very least"
2026,1,ayesak21,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,“Gets ko na
2026,2,ayesak21,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,”I think Sunshine is Direk Tonet’s best work yet
2026,3,ayesak21,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It is simplistic, raw, and bothering but it is wrapped in a cute pink ribbons that seeks to hide the harsh truths women in our society face"
2026,4,ayesak21,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The bits of humor at times give audiences a space to laugh and forget how heavy the message of the film is and then it just hits you with its narrative and the core message behind it
2026,5,ayesak21,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"My favorite scene was the conversation between Ariana and Bata, it was both pro life and pro choice which may be a hard thing to pull off but the team did it effortlessly"
2026,6,ayesak21,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I loved how raw and unfiltered it is and how it became a eureka moment for the other audiences
2026,7,ayesak21,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I am in no way fit to write a long ass review about the them of the film because stories like these are rooted in everyday struggles of women in such violent and patriarchal society
2026,8,ayesak21,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I loved the film but I would love more hearing how women react and talk about this film, sila ang tanging nararapat na magexpound lalo nito at naka supporta lang ako"
2027,1,jimiblake,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This movie surprised on how well-made it is from start to finish
2027,2,jimiblake,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I rarely watch local movies (I know I should be more active) but this very much convinced me it’s a 5/5 movie
2027,3,jimiblake,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Everyone from this movie pulled their weight jnto making this masterpiece
2027,4,jimiblake,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,From story to acting to cinematography to the grueling face of Manila
2027,5,jimiblake,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This is a movie that’s worthy of millions
2028,1,tristhany,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,subverts all kinds of toxicity of Filipinos
2028,2,tristhany,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i love how direk antoinette promotes safe sex and shows the consequences of irresponsible sex but at the same time challenges the norm of ideologies and beliefs of the Philippines’ stance on pro-choice and pro-life
2028,3,tristhany,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i think i believe when people say that, this is the best antoinette jadaone film"
2028,4,tristhany,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,sorry fangirl
2029,1,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Habang nasa kalagitnaan ng pelikula, nasabi ko na lamang sa sarili ko, “Para saan ba talaga ‘tong pelikula na ‘to"
2029,2,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ano bang point nito
2029,3,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"” Yun pala, ako lang ang hindi agad naka-gets"
2029,4,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ang fucked up lang kasi isipin kung yung bata ay literal na physical manifestation ng nasa tiyan ni Sunshine, parang anim na taong gulang na anyo ng dapat sana’y magiging anak"
2029,5,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Mas fucked up pa kasi kinokonsensya niya si Sunshine (tinawag siyang murderer)
2029,6,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Pero later on na-realize ko: hindi siya totoong bata, kundi visual representation lang ng internal conflict ni Sunshine"
2029,7,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Siya yung konsensya
2029,8,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Siya yung maliit na boses sa loob
2029,9,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Siya rin si Sunshine
2029,10,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kaya hindi talaga tungkol sa journey ni Sunshine sa pag-abot ng mga pangarap niya ang pelikula
2029,11,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Mas tungkol ito sa batang karakter—na hindi rin pala talaga bata—at sa mas malawak na karanasang pangkababaihan
2029,12,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Kasi sa totoo lang, ang kwento ng abortion ay hindi tungkol sa bata"
2029,13,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ito ay tungkol kay Sunshine
2029,14,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sa mga babae
2029,15,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sa mga may katawan
2029,16,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sa mga may kakayahang magdesisyon para sa sarili nila
2029,17,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maganda naman ang ending
2029,18,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Medyo parang Modess commercial nga lang (charot)
2029,19,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Pero kung tatanungin ako, feeling ko may kulang"
2029,20,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Bilang manonood, hindi ko gaanong naramdaman ang bigat ng emosyon"
2029,21,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kulang sa lalim
2029,22,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kulang sa hugot
2029,23,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Pero nabawi naman sa pagganap ng mga aktor—walang tapon, mahusay ang lahat"
2029,24,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Isang halimbawa ng kakulangan sa emotional connection para sa akin ay yung eksenang umiiyak si Sunshine sa loob ng inn habang isinasagawa ang abortion
2029,25,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Malapit na akong bumigay nun, ramdam na ramdam ko na, pero biglang nag-cut to a shot from outside the window of her emoting and yung maingay na traffic"
2029,26,kimmmmiko,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Aesthetic, oo"

2113,22,grcceries,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and i guess that's scientifically true
2113,23,grcceries,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,but if fetuses are rly just soulless clumps of tissue then why are we so afraid of pregnancy at all
2113,24,grcceries,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,why do we want to do abortions as early as possible

2113,26,grcceries,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and the fact that Sunshine Did Not Do That makes this movie good and relevant and real and special and a must-must-must-must watch

2150,4,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Gayundin ang ibang kababaihang nasa parehong katayuan mo
2150,5,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Hindi madaling maging babae, lalo na sa Pilipinas kung saan walang batas na magbibigay-karapatan sa ating awtonomiya sa katawan at reproduktibong kalusugan"
2150,6,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sa madaling salita, walang batas para sa ligal at ligtas na aborsyon"

2150,8,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,At hindi ito magiging posible kung hindi dahil sa maingat na direksiyon ni Direk Tonet at mahusay na pagganap ni Maris Racal
2150,9,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sa loob ng mahigit isang oras, inilagay ko ang posisyon ko kay Sunshine"

2150,11,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Totoo nga, na mas iba ang karanasan sa panonood sa sinehan"
2150,12,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Dahil doon, makikita mong iisa ang reaksiyon ng bawat tao sa bawat eksena"
2150,13,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Mayroong kolektibong karanasan
2150,14,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At para sa akin, isa itong tagumpay na layunin ng pelikula"
2150,15,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maaaring hindi kami pare-pareho ng paninindigan, pero iisa ang aming nararamdaman habang sinusundan ang kuwento ni Sunshine"
2150,16,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At sana, marami pa ang maabot ng pelikulang ito"
2150,17,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sana, marami pa ang maging bukas ang kanilang kaisipan sa ganitong kahalagang naratibo"
2150,18,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sana, maging tulay ang pelikulang ito upang magkaroon ng diskurso mula sa mga nakaupo"
2150,19,kalyechuchi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Dahil ang kuwento ni Sunshine ay tunay na nangyayari, si Sunshine ay isang tunay na tao"

2157,3,sbr2death,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” or “Sinisira nyo lang future nyo”  I’m not here to normalize teenage pregnancy at all pero nakakakalungkot talaga how other people view the WOMEN in the situation
2157,4,sbr2death,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ang dali dali nyo manghusga ng ating mga kapwa babae dhil di sila nagiintay for marriage, or minamadali nila ung “paglandi”, but it’s never on the guy"
2157,5,sbr2death,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Its normal for us humans to feel lust and think about sexuality but I do not want to glorify it okay,, Sunshine as a person is not perfect, shes human"
2157,6,sbr2death,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And so are all the other sunshines in the world
2157,7,sbr2death,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I have debated about the topic of teenage pregnancy a few times now and all i wish for is a better system in our country, and more support for the girls who have no choice, wether from strangers, family, loved ones, non-governmental organizations, or governmental ones,, even just that is rare haha"
2157,8,sbr2death,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Abortion is not murder, it’s saving your life; and aswell as your child’s life from being put into an environment that isn’t meant for them"

2157,15,sbr2death,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This shows that we can never truly understand what somebody is going through unless we experience it in our own hands
2157,16,sbr2death,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But i wont forget about Annika Co in this movie ofc

2165,5,avgchill,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I wouldn’t say the movie’s perfect—I have some issues with the use of Sunshine’s motivations as a student athlete being a little flat—but the movie resonates in the parts where it matters

2166,10,justinaerys,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Not a lot, really"
2166,11,justinaerys,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film did not fail in doing its job
2166,12,justinaerys,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"By tackling abortion itself, it already succeeded in sparking conversations such as this one"
2166,13,justinaerys,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And that's already a huge step in advancing women's right to accessible healthcare

2176,3,mgnvlfrs,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I hate how there is the depiction that ‘dreams have to end when motherhood starts’ ABSOLUTELY NO

2178,1,iyanvalenzuela,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Madaming bawal sa mundo, pero mas madaming bawal sa Pilipinas basta’t babae ka"
2179,1,cherisberries,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The story didn't go the direction I thought it would, and I’m glad it didn’t"
2179,2,cherisberries,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"An intersectional approach to abortion is exactly the film this country needs, depicting internal and external conflict is a realistic but still emotionally charged way"
2179,3,cherisberries,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,My only gripe with this film is that I’m not a fan of how this film looks and sounds — a sentiment I share across the current Filipino cinematic landscape
2179,4,cherisberries,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This film is a landmark, which is exactly why I hoped it would give more in terms of cinematography and music"
2179,5,cherisberries,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But nitpicking aside, this film is perfect as it is"
2180,1,greenlightgoer,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hindi ako si sunshine at wala rin akong matres

2180,4,greenlightgoer,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At bilang isang future healthcare worker, sana dumami pa ang mga taong katulad ni Doc Helena, na matapang na nilalabanan ang sistemang hindi mapagpalaya"
2180,5,greenlightgoer,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"All things said, this film is undoubtedly one of the important Filipino films of the decade"
2180,6,greenlightgoer,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It encapsulates the growing debate on whether a woman should have the right to HER OWN body
2180,7,greenlightgoer,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,More Filipino films should be bolder like this

2181,1,sisyd,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,That is the kind of mix of realism and surrealism that I want to achieve
2181,2,sisyd,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Nakaka-inspire sakin ito bilang manlilikha because it's not pretentious and it shouldn't be pero napaka lakas ng mensahe, isa yan sa mga gusto kong mamaster bilang manunulat"

2181,4,sisyd,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ang husay ni Maris Racal dito heck I think lahat ng aktor dito gave it their all lalong lalo na yung mga child actors
2181,5,sisyd,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And even if this film with the themes that it tackles, I think this is the first time in a LONG while na napatawa ako ng malakas sa movie theater"

2182,1,justley,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,hell yeah
2183,1,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine doesn’t waste time
2183,2,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Within ten minutes, we already know what the titular character wants: she doesn’t want this pregnancy"
2183,3,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What follows isn’t a mystery or a coming-of-age arc- it’s a fight
2183,4,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We meet Sunshine as she trains for the Olympic gymnastics qualifiers
2183,5,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She’s 19- focused, disciplined, and carrying a dream she’s had and has trained for since she was 10"
2183,6,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Then she discovers she’s pregnant
2183,7,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"From that moment on, the film never strays from what Sunshine wants: will she be able to get an abortion"
2183,8,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sound design is a big part in every movie and in Sunshine, the sound feels like another character"
2183,9,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Before her routines, her coach tells her to “drown out the noise"
2183,10,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” But what if you can’t
2183,11,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine lives by a noisy street
2183,12,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She trains in a chaotic gym
2183,13,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There’s a baby in the house that cries at all hours
2183,14,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even in a church- where she prays not for guidance, but for forgiveness before attempting to buy an abortion pill- there is no peace"
2183,15,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sound, in this film, becomes symbolic of the constant interference she endures"
2183,16,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The noise of judgment, of religion, of expectations- it’s relentless"
2183,17,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,That judgment bleeds into nearly every interaction she has
2183,18,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The pharmacist gives unsolicited opinions when she buys a pregnancy test
2183,19,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her best friend’s mother condemned her
2183,20,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a country where over 90% of the population identifies as Christian and Catholicism dominates public life, the supposed separation of church and state is functionally meaningless"
2183,21,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Religion makes the rules
2183,22,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And when Sunshine is rushed to the hospital after complications from taking an abortion pill purchased from a street vendor, the doctor shames her in front of other patients, calling her actions “a sin in the eyes of the Lord"
2183,23,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,”Sunshine carries everything alone
2183,24,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her future, once so certain, is now uncertain"
2183,25,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"If she continues the pregnancy, the nine years she spent training will be for nothing"
2183,26,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her body is already changing
2183,27,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her coach notices
2183,28,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She can’t train like she used to
2183,29,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her dream is slipping
2183,30,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And then we meet Mary Grace, a quiet but devastating side character whose story lingers"
2183,31,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Their first encounter happens at the same place where Sunshine tries to buy an abortion pill
2183,32,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The second time they meet, Mary Grace tells her she thought her bloated belly was just worms- a line so innocent it crushes you"
2183,33,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In that moment, we are reminded: she’s a child"
2183,34,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"A victim of incestuous rape and we later learn she’s just 13, after she was taken to the hospital for complications when she attempted to get rid of her pregnancy"
2183,35,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a country where sex is taboo and sex education is frowned upon by religious leaders, what hope do girls like Mary Grace-or Sunshine-really have"
2183,36,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is outstanding
2183,37,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her physicality, her posture, her tension even in the quite moments makes her character feel very real"
2183,38,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She carries the film with a maturity and vulnerability and it’s undeniably Racal’s best work to date
2183,39,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At just 90 minutes, Sunshine is lean and direct"
2183,40,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It doesn’t meander
2183,41,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Just a young girl fighting again and again for her dreams
2183,42,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a masterful depiction of what it means to grow up in a country where women and girls lack the right to choose
2183,43,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Where “I don’t want to be a mother” isn’t considered a valid reason
2183,44,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film drives this home in its final minutes: the guy responsible for Sunshine’s pregnancy shows up at her house with his pastor father
2183,45,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They assure her they’ll support the baby “every step of the way” until the child turns 18
2183,46,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine listens, then finally says what she’s been saying all along: she doesn’t want to be a mother"
2183,47,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We already know this
2183,48,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We’ve known it since the first ten minutes
2183,49,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But her ex and his father don't, or rather, can't understand it"
2183,50,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,“That’s not the point
2183,51,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"” she yells, and she’s right"
2183,52,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The moment others found out she was pregnant, it stopped being about her, but about the baby"
2183,53,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"They had no regard for her dreams, for her aspirations, and how pregnancy will affect her well-being"
2183,54,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It was never about if she'll be supported, it was about whether she's still ""allowed"" to have what she wants"
2183,55,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And in a country that denies girls and women a choice, the cost is often their dreams, their futures, and sometimes, their lives"
2183,56,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is just one story, but it’s shared by thousands"
2183,57,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And unless the law changes, there will always be more Sunshines"
2183,58,xxai,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Jadaone’s film dares to say that-loudly-even when the world tells her to drown out the noise
2184,1,ssunmoonsagi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,can’t count kung gano karami ang pigil iyak ko sa movie na to tangina sobrang laking sampal sa pinas talaga na bakit pa rin ilegal ang abortion when yung character ni rhed bustamante is nabuntis as early as 13
2184,2,ssunmoonsagi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"all of the decisions that sunshine did was valid talaga like you’re willing to take risk para lang sa pangarap mo, pangarap ng pamilya moi really really really love the sisters love tangina grabe yung character ni jennica garcia to the point na i was literally immersing myself into her GETS BA like u can’t compare a sister and a mother’s love talaga"
2184,3,ssunmoonsagi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"di lang talaga siya like super focused sa abortion yung topic but also it tackles about how fucked up yung pinas sa ganitong sitwasyon like for example, yung sa hospital na scene, GETS naman na u can’t risk ur license pero if u really care and value ur patients well being, atleast u could’ve done something"
2184,4,ssunmoonsagi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"also, kung paano nammeasure yung safety ng tao talaga is naguumpisa sa bahay like how dafuc u can’t be a proper mother to sustain your child’s needs tapos i-llet go mo lang siya sa ibang tao to get predated"
2184,5,ssunmoonsagi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it was so nice to experience sa cinema ng ganto like so fucking much
2184,6,ssunmoonsagi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i love u direk tonet and maris racal for this movie talaga
2185,1,h8ware,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,you really won't catch a break in manila
2186,1,tuesjays,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine does not go the way of those brutish Brillante Mendoza social commentary flicks where the end goal is to suffer, and suffer, and suffer"
2186,2,tuesjays,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,instead it opts to project its demons as an internal problem
2186,3,tuesjays,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That, which works quite splendidly if not for the fact that this is a film supported by a very tepid and uncharacteristic score from Maris Racal's own ex-partner"
2186,4,tuesjays,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That being said, the best things about Sunshine actually emanate from its night sequences"
2186,5,tuesjays,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It captures wholly the distress, illegality, and dismay of everything to do with abortion, the black market, and whatever Sunshine's problems are adjacent to in reality"
2186,6,tuesjays,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Those night scenes seemed straight out of Abbas Kiarostami’s Like Someone in Love
2186,7,tuesjays,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's actually so apparent by the film's end that everything that does come out of this leads to the most reasonable one: a film that doesn't explicitly preach what to do, save for what its problem is tied to in context"
2186,8,tuesjays,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But yeah, that score really does this thing a disservice"
2186,9,tuesjays,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Tom Cruise was right
2186,10,tuesjays,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Anyway, WHAT IS MY HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL DOING IN THIS MOVIE"

2232,3,evrybdyluvspie,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"watching this film on the big screen, i felt so uneasy knowing that this is pretty much a reality for filipino women and women overall"
2232,4,evrybdyluvspie,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sunshine is more than just a story of a girl tortured by the thoughts of bearing a child at such a young age; it is a grounded story surrounded by problems caused by societal pressure towards women and questionable christian morals and beliefs, which also opens up the current state of the country in terms of healthcare and its views on abortion"
2232,5,evrybdyluvspie,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"art has always been meant to provoke, and direk tonet did it so gracefully—like how sunshine performed her routines, but still so raw with scenes depicting medically unsafe abortions during the second half"

2232,8,evrybdyluvspie,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,another directorial choice that caught my attention was its symbolism

2232,11,evrybdyluvspie,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,details like added sound bites from the television and radio or the production design of sunshine's house

2240,3,lovetina,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it shows the struggles of our main character, sunshine, and goes into depth how unwanted pregnancy can lead to mental and physical problems, the desperation of having limited options and resources, the shame encoded into our heads at birth by religious and societal expectations, and most importantly, it shows the resilience women are forced to do just to simply survive"
2240,4,lovetina,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"second of all—i love, love, LOVE how this story is not your typical filipino pro-life propaganda warning"

2240,6,lovetina,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i’m actually so glad sunshine doesn’t force its main character to attach herself to the stigma of “abortion is murder” mindset; but rather, being able to be firm and push through with her decision—knowing that she’s not ready to be a mother—and doing what’s right for her (and the baby), without the influence of her boyfriend’s opinion, as well as the boyfriend’s father who offered to take care of financial expenses, which is quite rare"
2240,7,lovetina,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,another beautiful moment in this movie that i personally love is the sisterhood between sunshine and geleen
2240,8,lovetina,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,geleen’s understanding nature is powerful in itself—that having one person who will love you and guide you despite everything you’re facing can make your way in life a little easier
2240,9,lovetina,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"knowing that you have someone to lean on in times like this is so fortunate, cause not many filipinas can have that kind of support system"

2240,15,lovetina,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,although the first doctor that “helped” sunshine was unnecessarily rude
2240,16,lovetina,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i’m glad geleen stepped in and defended her sister

2240,19,lovetina,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"overall, i’m so glad that philippine cinema is slowly stepping out of its comfort zone to talk about sensitive topics like these despite half (or even the majority) of the country being against abortion"
2240,20,lovetina,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i hope this movie spreads like wildfire—a wake-up call to break free from patriarchal laws, and the belief that women’s bodies and choices are truly their own"

2242,3,ravenph,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The characters, the culture, the psyche, how far and behind we are in women's rights and sex education is rolled into this beautiful, heart wrenching movie"

2262,5,satuwina,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And definitely a deafening silence once the title card was shown

2265,1,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,My favorite part of the film is how Sunshine simply does not have any maternal figure in her life
2265,2,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her mother is literally nowhere
2265,3,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Numerous characters try to act in this woman's place, but all fail in being the figure Sunshine needs"
2265,4,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I believe this is why the coach remains a flat character for the entire duration of the plot
2265,5,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even if she refers to Sunshine as ""anak,"" we never get to see her be a mother to her"
2265,6,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The coach is at the center of the conflict, the one person who must never know that she's pregnant"
2265,7,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Thus, Sunshine refuses to open up to her coach, refusing to be cared for knowing the consequences"
2265,8,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"When her coach hears rumors of her pregnancy, there is no comfort in her words when she confronts Sunshine"
2265,9,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Instead, all the secretly pregnant teenager receives is a reminder of what is at stake, that she won't get to be on the team"
2265,10,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This pushes Sunshine to go back for a stronger round 2 of the pamparegla
2265,11,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Not even Thea's mom can give comfort to the friend of her daughter
2265,12,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She literally does the opposite, ordering Thea to stay away from Sunshine"
2265,13,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even when Sunshine asks the motelkeeper for help, and they reluctantly do so"
2265,14,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The elder women place her on a tricycle and leave her to bleed out as the tricycle rushes to the hospital
2265,15,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Then there's the doctor
2265,16,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine's sister perfectly criticizes her demeanor towards Sunshine
2265,17,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her sister asks the doctor if she's a relative of theirs or possibly their mother because she's acting like one
2265,18,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Though this might seem like a counter, when you take into account how the doctor cares more about Sunshine apologizing to the Lord and thanking Him rather than Sunshine's well-being, the case falters"
2265,19,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Also, her character felt more like a voice of how religion greatly affects the medical field and in turn, women's bodies"
2265,20,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The same goes even for the case of Mary Grace, who has been impregnated by her own uncle"
2265,21,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While her mother is alive, their relationship is complicated to say the least"
2265,22,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her mother enables the abusive relationship between the uncle and child for money, so that someone else can ""take care"" of Mary Grace, essentially removing herself from the role of being a mom"
2265,23,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I think all this is why her sister is highlighted as a light in her life
2265,24,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She is the closest thing to being a mother in Sunshine's life, caring about her health, whether she goes to school or not, and so on"
2265,25,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, they are sisters at heart"
2265,26,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They can only hold each other's hands through life
2265,27,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her sister does not order her what to do with the baby, instead defends her from the doctor, pays for the bill, and gets her home"
2265,28,everybobi,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They are sisters through and through

2295,2,jrnwll,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s not due to a lack of relevance, on the contrary, the film captured the complexities and ironies of abortion culture in the Philippines with striking accuracy"

2298,2,lo_ori,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” ito yung hard pill to swallow na hindi lubos maintindihan ng madla
2298,3,lo_ori,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,bakit ba kapag ganitong mga sitwasyon laging babae ang nalalagay sa alanganin

2300,3,lezty4,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Marahil hindi ito laging napag-uusapan, dahil bakit"

2300,7,lezty4,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ipinakita rito na hindi madali ang desisyon
2300,8,lezty4,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ipinakita rin dito ang mga matitibay na rason para hindi ituloy ang panganganak— pangarap
2300,9,lezty4,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sana lahat ay ma-gets ang desisyon ni Sunshine, katulad ng pag-intindi ng bata sakanya"

2301,1,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The entire time I was watching, I felt like I couldn't breathe"
2301,2,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's claustrophobic and suffocating, just like how Sunshine herself feels"
2301,3,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"You feel her world slowly closing in on her, invisible walls tightening around her in every frame"
2301,4,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The camera doesn't let you breathe, and neither does the sound"
2301,5,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Manila's noise is constant, overwhelming, and disorienting, especially for a gymnast who needs focus and silence to thrive"
2301,6,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is literally and figuratively trapped in tight spaces, cramped jeepneys, crowded streets, the overbearing sound of trains passing by, judgmental stares, and high expectations"
2301,7,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Visually and sonically, it captures how isolating and terrifying it is to carry a burden like hers in a society that is less than kind toward women"
2301,8,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"(Btw, just to put it out there, the cinematography and colors in this film are GORGEOUS"
2301,9,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,") In almost every film that tackles women's issues in the Philippines, you'll find this line repeated in many reviews here in Letterboxd: ""Ang hirap maging babae"
2301,10,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,At lalong mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas
2301,11,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,""" It's because it's true"
2301,12,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Every day, women here continue to fight for autonomy, for safety, for the right to choose themselves"
2301,13,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"We live in a deeply patriarchal and religious society that expects women to always put others first—especially family, be it their parents, siblings, or children—and shames them whenever something bad happens to them as if they brought it upon themselves"
2301,14,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Society never asks the men who take advantage of women simply existing to change, rather it expects women to quietly endure"
2301,15,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Bakit kailangang babae ang palaging mag-adjust
2301,16,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I appreciated how the film showed moments of solidarity between women, but it's sad how that's not always the case in real life"
2301,17,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Exceptional performances from the entire cast, especially Maris Racal, who is tremendous in the titular role"
2301,18,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"From the start, she's completely convincing as an elite athlete and future Olympian: disciplined, focused, and has no room for error, as both her dreams and the dreams of others rest heavily on her shoulders"
2301,19,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But it's in moments where Sunshine wrestles with fear, guilt, and inner conflict that Maris truly shines"
2301,20,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She captures and presents the character's vulnerability so well
2301,21,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Also, as someone who always adored Jennica Garcia since her GMA days, I absolutely loved watching her quiet and subtle acting as Sunshine's sister"
2301,22,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I said in my first review of Fan Girl that I hoped Direk Tonet would make an even braver film, and she did"
2301,23,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine focuses and dives deep into the themes it introduces and stands firm in its critique—something that I felt was somehow lacking in Fan Girl
2301,24,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While some moments didn't always work for me and the magical realism elements sometimes took me out, I understand the choice"
2301,25,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Part of me wishes it stayed more grounded and direct, but the “Gets ko na” scene near the end hit so hard that I stopped minding altogether"
2301,26,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's a great, important film and I hope it helps open up more discourse on women's reproductive rights in the country"
2301,27,jahdfaune,2025-07-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Go see it in cinemas when you can

2302,3,artsycola,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"More than anything, pinaalala sakin nito na hindi pwedeng diktahan ng sinuman, mas lalo na ng kalalakihan, ang katawan ng babae"

2305,4,shaniqua_99,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,To think that we are now in a very modern world this topic is still a taboo in our country

2485,2,mariakrishna,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Honestly having a difficult time writing down my reflections
2485,3,mariakrishna,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,First–it was so important to me that Sunshine got pregnant because of consensual premarital sex instead of rape
2485,4,mariakrishna,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,For years I have heard people say that the only valid reason for even considering abortion is if the pregnancy is a product of assault
2485,5,mariakrishna,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This conservative mentality is harmful because it insinuates that women have a choice over our bodies only if it has been violated first

2487,3,ydmk,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The cinematography was so spot on
2487,4,ydmk,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Antonette’s writing was so solid that I really feel like watching a 20 years old struggle with this
2487,5,ydmk,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And I’m a little bit bitin and was looking for something that I don’t know because it didn't felt like an hour and forty+ minutes film
2487,6,ydmk,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It was really a fast pace

2489,4,spaniishlatte,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"a lot of issues were tackled so gracefully and with sensitivity in this film, whilst not necessarily favoring any particular side"
2489,5,spaniishlatte,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the scene where sunshine asks for forgiveness at quiapo church, the same church where she was desperate to find abortion methods, shows how two conflicting views on abortion can be felt at once"
2489,6,spaniishlatte,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"also liked how it depicted the pressure of being an athlete, of maintaining your weight, and of the unrelenting need to train despite your life pretty much falling apart"
2489,7,spaniishlatte,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"if there’s anything i want to praise, it’s the way the film portrayed the role of women supporting one another, from the protagonist, her sister, her coach, the doctor, down to the innkeeper that rushed her to the hospital"
2489,8,spaniishlatte,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the worst takes in this film were from men (no surprise there) who didn’t even bother asking sunshine how she felt (because in our incredibly conservative & patriarchal society, women are nothing more than their childbearing abilities lmao)"
2489,9,spaniishlatte,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"ultimately, the only valid opinions on a woman’s body & whether or not she should undergo abortion should be hers & hers alone"

2494,14,lavdrfts,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,but what if she did
2494,15,lavdrfts,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,what if her religion did not instill fear onto her — did not make her choose between her dream of living in the US and…me
2494,16,lavdrfts,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,what if she was given the right to make autonomous decisions for her own body and for herself
2494,17,lavdrfts,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the importance of the sanctity of life has long been asserted in, what seems to be, an unending discussion on the controversial topic of abortion"
2494,18,lavdrfts,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,these endless queries led me to enlightening myself to a greater picture of things
2494,19,lavdrfts,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,THAT criminalizing abortion is a NEGLECT to women’s rights

2494,33,lavdrfts,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"she is every young woman who was denied proper healthcare, every young woman who was denied their choices and rights"

2549,5,jonsntual,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,got goosebumps when I realized what symbolizes those kids
2549,6,jonsntual,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"liked the fact that they didn't give them a name or identity, cause that's what they are, nothing"

2554,1,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,drown out the noise
2554,2,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,sisimulan ko ’tong review sa paraan kung paano nailantad ang pelikula sa mga manonood— sa ingay
2554,3,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sa unang parte, maliban sa naging pagsasanay ni sunshine, ay dadalhin ka nito sa marumi at maingay na sulok ng quiapo kung saan nakabudbod ang mga relihiyosong karatula tulad ng “gift of god,” at “in god we trust"
2554,4,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” hindi ka nito lulubayan subalit halos nakaukit na ito sa bawat ugat natin— para bang isa itong palantandaang isa kang pilipino
2554,5,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sobrang bigat nung isang scene na umiiyak si sunshine sa labas ng simbahan, nagmamakaawa na tanggalin lang ang sanggol sa loob niya at babawi rin siya sa Diyos"
2554,6,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,dahil iyon naman talaga ang itinuro sa atin tungkol sa relihiyon sa simula palang; ang pagiging kondisiyonal nito
2554,7,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,dito rin na-introduce ang batang karakter na hindi natin nalaman kung ano ang pangalan at kung bakit ba siya sunod nang sunod kay sunshine na parang nakatali sila sa isa’t-isa
2554,8,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,hindi ko alam if napansin din ng iba na hindi totoo/hindi naman nag-e-exist yung bata at isa siyang talinghaga ng magiging anak ni sunshine
2554,9,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"ineencapsulate niya yung pagkakasala, kahihiyan, at trauma sa relihiyon ni sunshine"
2554,10,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sinusundan siya nito sa bawat balak niya, sinisigawan siya gilid, at pinagdududa ang sarili"
2554,11,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"higit pa diyan, suportado rin naman siya nito"
2554,12,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"ika nga niya, kung ano ang pangarap ni sunshine ay pangarap niya rin"
2554,13,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,kung ano ang nakabubuti kay sunshine ay makabubuti rin para sa kaniya
2554,14,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sa usapin ng abortion, lingat sa mga tao na bigyan ng kaluluwa ang nagdadala ng bata"
2554,15,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,na para bang isa lamang itong karwahe at hindi taong may puso at pangarap
2554,16,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,na sa sandaling nagkaroon na ng buhay sa tiyan mo ay doon na rin nagsimula ang pagkamatay mo
2554,17,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,dagdag ko lang sa parte ng mga bata bilang representasyon/metaporya ng mga anak na hindi pa naisisilang ay si ariana
2554,18,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"natuwa ako kasi example nga siya ng mga sinasabi ng tao o di kaya nung doktor kay sunshine na, “paano kung maging presidente siya ng pilipinas"
2554,19,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,mag-imbento ng gamot sa aids
2554,20,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” dahil binahagi niya rin na pangarap niyang mag-artista o di kaya maging unang beking presidente ng pilipinas
2554,21,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"at hindi naman din natin isinasantaboy yung mga posibilidad na ‘yon, pero sa sitwasyon na tulad ng nagdadala sa kanya na si menggay na isang biktima ng incestual at corrective rape bilang isang tomboy, maiintindihan natin kung bakit kinailangan maglaho ni ariana"
2554,22,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,pinabulaanan din ng pelikula ang mga kuro-kuro na aabusuhin ng mga kababaihan ang legalisasyon ng abortion— na baka maging isang gawi na nilang magpalaglag
2554,23,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,naipakita na ang abortion ay hindi madaling piliin
2554,24,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,na kahit sigurado ang isang tao na ayaw niya maging ina ay isa pa rin itong mabigat na pagpasya
2554,25,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"madugo sa puso, madugo sa katawan"
2554,26,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"hangga’t mananatiling walang pagpasya ang mga kababaihan sa kanilang katawan, mananatili rin ang iligal na pagsasagawa nito"
2554,27,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,walang lugar ang mga kababaihan sa ganitong sistema at bansa
2554,28,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"napatunayan ito sa pelikula— mula sa ospital, sa lansangan, pati sa karapatan mamili"
2554,29,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"kahit hindi pa nalalaman ang kasarian ng nasa sinapupunan ni sunshine ay hinalaang lalaki na agad ito, isa na namang tanda na hindi kailanman iniisip ang posibilidad ng isang babae"
2554,30,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sana sa mga nakapanood nito dahil lang gusto nila si maris, o di kaya’y na-curious sila sa kwento"
2554,31,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,sa mga hindi sigurado sa kinatatayuan nila sa usaping abortion
2554,32,lunarii,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sana, tulad nung bata, ay masasabi niyo na ringgets ko na"

2562,5,zev4stian,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this film shows one of the most important and painful truths that women still go through — being shamed for having control over their own bodies
2562,6,zev4stian,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it captures what it feels like to be a woman in a country where your choices are questioned, your body is politicized, and your autonomy is treated like a threat, when it shouldn’t be"
2562,7,zev4stian,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,there’s nothing wrong with wanting to choose for yourself

2563,2,409films,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,sunshine’s journey within the whole film was just me rooting for her
2563,3,409films,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,well maybe because i am the same age with her right now and that makes me feel how shaken up she is when she found out she’s pregnant (literally experienced the same heavy feeling and cry uncontrollably during that jeepney scene) i know exactly how deeply sunshine feels (pero hindi po ako buntis)
2563,4,409films,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it was just really such a heavy film and gets na gets ko ang buhay ni sunshine bilang taga-maynila, kung gaano hindi ka-fair ang mundo esp with unprivileged ones and it really captures how it is being a woman in a place like this"

2563,6,409films,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,one detail i love about this film on how it exactly captivates manila
2563,7,409films,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the white noise from the crowd and the sound of vehicles and trains that passes by
2563,8,409films,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it somehow mirrors how sunshine feels, the city is with her"
2563,9,409films,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"that’s why she’s a different person once she collides with ballet, she really drowns out the noise once she picks her ribbon and live by the meaning of her name, sunshine"
2563,10,409films,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the rehearsal scene at the end really got me bawled my eyes out as getting rid of it was the right thing to do, sunshine will forever be haunted of the child she could have had"
2563,11,409films,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"she’ll certainly thinks about it from time to time and u can’t blame her as we grow up to a catholic country that gives importance to a word ‘family’how i wish the ending could be longer but with technicality, i get it"
2563,12,409films,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i’m still grateful that we have a film like this, it’s brave, transparent and very realistic with the world we live by everyday"

2566,1,daintysunset,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Beautiful film exploring women's choices (or lack thereof)
2566,2,daintysunset,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It gave the audience a deep dive into the war that goes inside a woman's head as she makes decisions that could have great impact on her future all the while taking into consideration the different opinions of people around her
2566,4,daintysunset,2025-07-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"5 short of a perfect score because there were symbolism that I personally would want to change but overall, this is a great film"

2569,3,beidadoobee,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,ang galing rin ng pagkakatagpi tagpi ng kwento kasi napakita na yung mga societal issues ng bansa ay magkakaugat lang rin at nakakalungkot na hindi pa rin nasosolusyunan up to this date
2569,4,beidadoobee,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"lastly, i loved how they made sunshine's character as someone na alam sa sarili niya kung ano yung gusto niya from the start, kaya GETS KO NA"

2576,2,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” I still recall that time back in high school when we were taught the morality of abortion in Religion class
2576,3,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I was a scholar at a conservative Catholic all-boys school, and although I wasn’t religious (nor did I ever practice Catholicism on paper), its discussions almost shaped my beliefs on the subject matter"
2576,4,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What I did not know was that those beliefs were tied with several factors besides religion such as patriarchy and conservatism
2576,5,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That was before the pandemic, and since then, my viewpoints have stirred away from every close-minded and male-led influence those so-called teachings had"
2576,6,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Yet, I still find it unfair that I don’t have to go through those experiences that women go through in this patriarchal society, including that of Sunshine"
2576,7,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Critics were not kidding about the Lino Brocka comparisons to Sunshine, yet this has that unique female perspective that elevates its authenticity"
2576,8,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film is straight-forward, and in doing so, it is raw, visceral, and brutally honest"
2576,9,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It takes its viewers through an experience rather than dictate or spoonfeed, and it rarely shies away from its reality"
2576,10,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"From the milieu alone — from the shitty healthcare system, to the sheer lack of contraceptives (if you could find them, they’re very expensive), ignorant, privileged boyfriend, and to the conservative religious doctors and rapist relatives — we are already shown that this is not a world suitable for Sunshine and for women like her who are struck with unwanted pregnancies"
2576,11,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Because that’s the truth of our nation
2576,12,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Because this is not a country that favors the oppressed
2576,13,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As the famous saying goes, “Mahirap maging babae, pero mas mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas,” (“It’s impossible to be a woman, but it’s more impossible to be a woman living in the Philippines,”) and that couldn’t be reflected better in this film"
2576,14,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine seeks to reclaim autonomy over her own body, which every woman deserves so but is seldom granted that right"
2576,15,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Despite the latter being true, we still see Sunshine do everything she could to get that abortion, even if it means having to spend an unreasonable amount of money just to do so"
2576,16,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Some may say that her story is inspiring, but it’s tragic how inspiration is confused with disturbance"
2576,17,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This is a story that’s supposed to shed light on the fact of the matter because this is one of many issues in the country that have to be addressed, especially within our own government"
2576,18,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Even its production design and cinematography that go hand-in-hand highlight how constrictive this place is for those who are forced to go through such uncomfortable, unasked experiences"
2576,19,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Much of the film’s raw emotions would not have been as impactful without Maris Racal
2576,20,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her acting and performance here are simply generational and incomparable
2576,21,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She may be known for her more comedic roles (and pure wit and vibes in interviews), but her role of Sunshine brings out her more vulnerable side that is just as raw as the attitude of the film itself"
2576,22,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Among the more underrated performances is Jennica Garcia, who levels up with Maris Racal’s natural performance but brings a distinct, yet supportive dynamic"
2576,23,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Child actor Annika is also great and is secretly the one who makes some of the more emotional scenes, especially those towards the end, work so well"
2576,24,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In addition, Meryll Soriano stands out, as do Elijah Canlas, Rhed Bustamante, Xyriel Manabat, Piolo Pascual, and Angeli Bayani – even if the latter two only show up in one scene each"
2576,25,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Some ongoing debate had sparked since its release here with regards to the weaving of the children subplot into the story, and while it did have its risks, for better or worse, it still cannot be disregarded how brave Antoinette Jadaone and Maris Racal are for telling this kind of story"
2576,26,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Perhaps it could have been subtler, but in a country like ours, it was necessary to have been told through a more straightforward direction without being too preachy"
2576,27,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"There have been a handful of films out there that tackle abortion and unwanted pregnancies, but what makes Sunshine stand out is the mere fact that it is set in the Philippines"
2576,28,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"We are one of the last few countries to have abortion illegal as we are rooted in traditions influenced by the patriarchy and religion that treat it as an immoral, evil doing and as a taboo simply because, to them, the youth are “being irresponsible"
2576,29,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"” Sunshine never puts the blame on its titular character for its consequential catalyst, and through its depiction of such a life in this country, instead, asks us to question our reality: Did the youth fail us for exploring a natural part of ourselves, or did the adults fail them by placing and enabling all these barriers as mere punishment substituted by the words of “a lesson” or “a teaching”"
2576,30,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That’s what makes Sunshine scary: The simple fact that it’s set in the Philippines; that women with unwanted pregnancies have to navigate through these stupid barriers, but it also ends with hope for a better future where women are allowed to make choices for their own body"
2576,31,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In fact, we must also be reminded of this saying: “No uterus, no opinion"
2576,32,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” Such a timely film that is raw and honest with its sensitive topic that must be talked about because so many women have had experiences like that of Sunshine
2576,35,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Seeing this at one of the many screenings with Q&A and audience sharing truly added to its communal experience
2576,36,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Direk Tonet always mentions how the film is no longer hers but ours now that we have seen it, and you could clearly see and feel it as the credits rolled, with some women opening up about once being a Sunshine or their parents giving birth to them at such an early age"
2576,37,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It reminds you that those experiences are real and are still happening to other women underground up to now
2576,38,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s also amazing to see an eye-opening drama such as this fill up the theaters more than it did for Fantastic Four (which made for such a whiplash of a double-feature for me because it tackles the opposite theme to Sunshine)
2576,42,joshclaude,2025-07-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It goes without saying that those who say that Philippine Cinema is nothing compared to Hollywood films should shut up and watch this in cinemas

2608,1,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,the film hits too close to home for me
2608,2,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"sunshine is suffocating, and maybe that's a directorial choice"
2608,3,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,it hits in the most uncomfortable and painful parts of me at times
2608,4,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,it resonates with every woman who has to determine a better choice out of two shitty choices: one that might shackle her freedom or one that may free her but haunt her at the same time
2608,5,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"it makes you feel rage at systemic failures which birth a backward society that villifies women for their lapses of judgment--damned if they do, damned if they don't"
2608,6,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,sunshine is linear in its plot
2608,7,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"it never really takes you out of sunshine's head, so you see how raw everything is, how immature she is, how she's desperate and breaking apart but trying to keep it together, and how she's just a kid who fucked up"
2608,8,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"the film works because of this approach, albeit some plot devices are too on the nose--making them iffy and questionable, and may have muddled the film's stance"
2608,9,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"there are obvious plot holes, little details that could have enriched the world-building were overlooked"
2608,10,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"some subplots lack depth, but the performances made me look past on these things, in a sense that it was pleasant enough to watch for me"
2608,11,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"not for everyone, but everyone should be part of the discussion"
2608,12,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"jadaone's films are usually hits-or-misses for me, but sunshine is one of her better ones"
2608,13,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"the message may be clear and hopeful, but real life presents a much darker truth: for most women, there are no olympics and dreams to hold on to"
2608,14,agsbewatchin,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,80.0,ltbx,"in reality, we still have a long way to go in paving for a more humane society for filipino women"

2677,9,kacecabali,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The way the film delivers its message too overtly makes the subplot involving the 13-year-old feel disconnected and distracting

2680,4,mkgummy,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it sparks uncomfortable discussions and really highlights as much as we want to have a black and white and sometimes gray world, it's really not how it works because we deserve the basic right to our Self"
2680,5,mkgummy,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the background of manila in all this, the religious imagery, the complex family dynamics seen in the everyday"
2680,6,mkgummy,2025-07-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it might not seem much to most, but its a loud and important start to having conversations that can shape change for this damned country"
2681,1,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The OB admitting section was, and still is, one of the busiest parts of the hospital I worked in as an intern"
2681,2,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It had been renovated prior to my first duty there, and it would be renovated once again after I'd left"
2681,3,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Both of those renovations were done in part to address a persistent issue: that the place never runs out of patients
2681,4,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Every day, and especially on Mondays and Fridays, the admitting section would take in a significant number of expectant mothers with all sorts of conditions"
2681,5,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Some would be giving birth for the first time
2681,6,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Some were veterans who were familiar to the staff working there, giving birth like clockwork every year"
2681,7,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Some had serious conditions alongside their pregnancies that made giving birth extremely complicated, to the point where their current state posed a significant risk for death while giving birth"
2681,8,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Nevertheless, they would slowly fill up the adjacent labor and delivery room, often two to three mothers to a stretcher"
2681,9,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"On very busy days the stretchers would run out, and the labor room would be filled with mothers settling down wherever they could, mostly on the cold, tiled floor"
2681,10,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I remembered those days in the admitting section when I saw Antoinette Jadaone's latest film, Sunshine, about a young gymnast (Maris Racal) who gets pregnant right before a very important event that might lead to the SEA games and eventually the Olympics"
2681,11,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine doesn't have any qualms about making the decision as she immediately gets to work trying to find an abortifacient to terminate the unwanted pregnancy
2681,12,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This process is not made easy
2681,13,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Miggy (Elijah Canlas), the man who impregnated Sunshine, wants nothing to do with her after learning of her pregnancy"
2681,14,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"He doesn't even tell her to have an abortion directly, only saying that 'she knows what to do"
2681,15,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"' Getting medical help is equally difficult, and intersects gender with class: medical treatment is expensive (despite the fact that state sponsored healthcare should be financially accessible) and as abortion is still illegal in the Philippines, people resort to black markets to seek the care they need"
2681,16,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Once in a while, the OB admitting section will receive a patient who has lost her child"
2681,17,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Miscarriages are common, and often they are spontaneous"
2681,18,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Once, a mother of a stillborn child asked me if the cries in the next room were her child's, when I knew the infant was lying in a box, ready to be given to back to their parents"
2681,19,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Then there are the other kinds of patients, ones who made a choice like Sunshine"
2681,20,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They all had their reasons; this was a conscious and informed decision
2681,21,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,After a while you know it when they come in
2681,22,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sometimes the doctor would come in and tell them that what they did was illegal, some would even threaten to call the police"
2681,23,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Nothing ever came of it; they were empty threats - often to 'scare' them into not making that decision again
2681,24,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It always made me uncomfortable
2681,25,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"To be born a woman is to be born into violence, into a world where the odds are stacked against you"
2681,26,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is not the first film to depict this violence - films like Rae Red's Babae at Baril (2019) and Jadaone's own Fan Girl (2020) are two examples
2681,27,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"They show what a deeply patriarchal society creates: people like Miggy and a certain other character near the end, people who I interpreted as not exactly archetypal or allegorical towards the structures that created them, but as the inevitable products of it"
2681,28,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But unlike those two films that I mentioned earlier, Sunshine feels far more indignant, full of anger that Fan Girl lacked, and drawing towards a different conclusion compared to Babae at Baril"
2681,29,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Quiapo has been a backdrop for many a Filipino film, and here it is a sanctuary of sorts"
2681,30,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is here where Sunshine goes to find the solution to her problems
2681,31,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ironically draped in religious imagery, it both embodies the faith it represents (as a source of refuge for those who are in need) and as something that stands against its tenets"
2681,32,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a film about choices: the choice to live one's own dream, the choice to live freely as the best person you can be"
2681,33,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine's sister Geleen (Jennica Garcia) coaches Sunshine as she practices in their shared home
2681,34,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Certain background elements (thanks to the film's excellent production design) hint that Geleen, too, was once an aspiring gymnast, whose dreams ended with a baby"
2681,35,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"If she had the choice, would she have lived a different life"
2681,36,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It shows as well in Geleen's character, and Garcia gives a standout performance as her"
2681,37,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Finally, that idea of ""refuge"" may not refer to Quiapo, but something else entirely"
2681,38,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Throughout the film there are many people, both seen and unseen, who help Sunshine in her quest"
2681,39,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"""Ipagdadasal ko kayo,"" a hilot tells Sunshine after they bring a child to the hospital who made the same choice"
2681,40,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"""Mag-ingat ka,"" another one tells Sunshine as she sets off"
2681,41,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A sympathetic medical professional gives a knowing look
2681,42,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Every doctor has a story like it: in one of my last rotations at the labor room, a patient walked in nervously in the robe the hospital supplied her"
2681,43,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It was a very busy day, and pregnant women overflowed on the stretchers and sat on the floor"
2681,44,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She had no business being here: she looked no older than 14, and she should be going to school and playing with friends, not in the last stages of giving birth"
2681,45,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Suffice it to say, this pregnancy was not her choice"
2681,46,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"If she had the choice like Sunshine did, would she be here"
2681,47,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"On the other hand, the point of the film for me is not whether one makes one choice over the other, but that people like Sunshine and that kid has the ability to choose in the first place"
2681,48,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Because the labor and delivery room should be semi-sterile, companions (in this case, the kid's very worried mother) are not allowed in"
2681,49,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But the rest of the mothers in that labor room heard us taking the medical history and heard her story
2681,50,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The other expectant mothers gave the kid their blankets, talked to and comforted her, up until she gave birth"
2681,51,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Everyone was that kid's mother that day
2681,52,jrtawasil,2025-07-31 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a world where you are denied agency, where one is subjected to violence from birth, the least women can do is find refuge in each other"

2683,13,swowberi,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"when it comes to reproductive health, nothing is just for convenience"
2683,14,swowberi,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and it’s not only about the ending—it’s ALSO about how important it is to equip the youth with the actual, necessary knowledge about the topic"

2683,16,swowberi,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"let our women know what they can do for themselves, and what they should never allow men—or anyone else—to decide for them"

2685,5,acethetical,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But as I reflected more on it, I realized that might have been the point—although many of the scenes were commendably filmed, the film wasn’t trying to entertain; it was trying to confront"

2685,7,acethetical,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The rawness and silence I initially perceived as weaknesses were actually reflections of Sunshine herself—caught between the pressures of gymnastics and the weight of her misfortunes

2685,10,acethetical,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine challenges us to understand their pain and see their urgent need for help

2688,1,sircs94,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Sunshine fue una experiencia bastante sorprendente dentro del contexto del cine mainstream filipino moderno
2688,2,sircs94,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"Saliéndose del margen seguro y cómodo que tiene acostumbradas a las masas a la complacencia social retratada en un romanticismo casi cínico de la pobreza y la glorificación del poder y la influencia, además de la necesidad por rectitud religiosa"
2688,3,sircs94,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"La cinta, desarrollándose sin teatralidad ni grandes despliegues telenoveleros de drama, entiende perfectamente que la sobriedad y sequedad de la realidad filipina de la clase baja no necesita endulzantes para trabajar de manera efectiva y cortante en pantalla"
2688,4,sircs94,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"La cinematografía es excelente, el ritmo es perfecto y las tomas se toman todo el tiempo necesario para declarar visualmente sus ideas, además de que la dirección si bien denota algunos rastros y pequeños momentos de la desconexión farandulera moderna del voyerismo cínico que nos fuerza a sentir lastima por la pobreza, no cae totalmente en ello, demostrando mucha fuerza y entendimiento la gran parte del tiempo"
2689,1,thondelmundo,2025-08-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sunshine explored important and sensitive topics that are not only necessary for filipino audience to see but also essential to open dialogues and conversations, to shed light on and ultimately to spark change especially on things that are often labeled as taboo in a conservative and retrogressive country like the philippines"

2713,7,generichanna,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it’s a small ripple but it keeps the momentum (or at least rattle the conscience) in an environment that refuses to progress with time

2768,37,spideypunk,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,kaya ‘yung unang ginawa ni sunshine matapos niyang malaman na buntis siya—pumunta sa simbahan—sobrang telling kung saan siya lumaki

2789,3,siramaris,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,5 star for the super random cameo that was also somehow super on the nose
2789,4,siramaris,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's such a good bit that amuses me to no end
2789,5,siramaris,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I'd rate the movie higher if not for a plot device that felt completely unnecessary and at times distracting

2789,7,siramaris,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Every time they employed this plot device, it was just so unnecessary and distracting"

2789,14,siramaris,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It shows the ironic juxtaposition of abortion pills being sold next to religious artifacts
2789,15,siramaris,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But most importantly, it does not get preachy"

2801,7,overlypisces,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"every detail, even the smalles rings true and is authentically filipino"

2865,9,maestaels,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it’s so easy for some to just state an anti-abortion stance, but the reality for a woman wrestling with such a complex decision is so much more nuanced and personal"
2865,10,maestaels,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,you hear it all the time: choosing to terminate a pregnancy is selfish
2865,11,maestaels,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"but then i genuinely wonder, isn't it also selfish to bring a child into the world if you're not fully ready, or if you're uncertain about the future that motherhood brings"

2865,17,maestaels,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and that's okay
2865,18,maestaels,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it’s time we should be open to talking about these topics, really opening up our minds, and stop letting our religious beliefs completely go into our way of empathy and understanding"

2872,1,iram,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ang pinakanagustuhan ko sa Sunshine ay yung tapat na kwinento ang karanasan ng mga kababaihan, lalo na ng mga batang babae, sa bulok na healthcare dito sa Pilipinas na hindi tayo binibigyan ng kalayaan para makapili"
2872,2,iram,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Hindi ito paligoy-ligoy, at ang galing ni Maris sa kanyang ginampanan na papel bilang bida - na mas lalo ko pang naappreciate dahil sa pagparticipate nya sa pagkausap ng mga babaeng nakaranas nito sa realidad"
2872,3,iram,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sana marami pang makanood nito
2872,4,iram,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sana, balang araw, may kalayaan na ang mga Sunshine sa Pilipinas para makapili at maalagaan ng sistemang may pakialam"
2873,1,cathcathcath,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,a real horror film for every filipina who starts to have their period
2874,1,sadiesss,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This movie hunts me in every way, I hope I was there for my sister when she was sunshine, THE GUILT"
2875,1,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"although i already knew what the premise of the movie was, sobrang emotional pa rin nung dating nung intro sakin"
2875,2,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it opened with Sunshine performing her gymnastics routine almost flawlessly tapos maya-maya, it was immediately revealed that she was pregnant"
2875,3,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,knowing all this beforehand didn't lessen the impact of the intro scene for me - my heart broke for her all the same
2875,4,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,living in an extremely conservative country with an extremely poor healthcare system is a nightmare especially for people like Sunshine
2875,5,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,where the only choices are to carry on with the pregnancy or risk going through an unsafe abortion - she will get judged either way
2875,6,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,another thing that i liked was the kid's character
2875,7,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,she can be interpreted in many ways - some say she is Sunshine's what if but i interpreted her as Sunshine's conscience
2875,8,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"in the early parts of the movie, she was discouraging Sunshine from going through with her plan but eventually came at peace with Sunshine's decisions by the end of the movie"
2875,9,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"for me, she was also a manifestation of Catholic guilt - something that most of us carry since we grew up in a religious country"
2875,10,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the things she says to Sunshine is exactly the kind of thoughts you would think of when deciding on something that is against the principles you grew up with
2875,11,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"surely, this movie will become something that starts a discussion on the sensitive topics it tackled - para sa mga taong nagdadawang-isip pa sa pagiging pro-choice, sa mga taong sinsubukang intindihin yung mga pro-choice, at para sa mga taong katulad ni Sunshine"
2875,12,sushic,2025-07-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i just hope that people with more conservative views can watch this para naman maintindihan nila yung point ng mga nasa kabilang side ng diskursong ito

2879,2,mixd_chrctr,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It exposes the irony of our society, which openly profess religiosity, yet we secretly tolerate and practice things that contradict those beliefs"
2879,3,mixd_chrctr,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Using Quiapo, Manila as the backdrop of the movie is really perfect, because the place embodies the chaos, contradictions, and disorganization that mirror…"

2901,1,jellobee,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is a bold and compelling story about when passion collides with unforeseen circumstances
2901,2,jellobee,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Delivering a powerful performance, Maris Racal gives light to Sunshine, a bright and hopeful teen gymnast whose Olympic dreams come crashing down after an unplanned pregnancy"
2901,3,jellobee,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While the film is beautiful aesthetically, it’s also dark and grim as it not only deals with a controversial subject matter, but is also an accurate reflection of Philippine culture and society"
2901,4,jellobee,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I love stories that involve moral dillemas — stories that make the character choose between two conflicting moral values
2901,5,jellobee,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This is the case for Sunshine, whose choice is either to abort her baby to reach her Olympic dream, a goal she’s dreamt of in years; or keep the baby as this is deemed the morally right thing to do"
2901,6,jellobee,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Set in the Philippine context, one of the most religious countries in the world, that is one of the hardest dilemmas to have, and I thought the film gave justice to what Maris’ character had to go through"

2901,12,jellobee,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The city, while beautiful to look at, lying beneath it feels like a sense of grime and moral corruption, which blended well with the film’s theme"
2901,13,jellobee,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But aside from a couple of narrative choices made, I really liked this film"

2902,5,nosfw,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Filipino society's marites culture and religious evangelism no less is bound to have an effect on Sunshine's life and that was something I wished to see her persevere through post-abortion
2902,6,nosfw,2025-08-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"but I do also respect the need to end Sunshine's story on a more hopeful note, as that message of sheer hope and optimism is probably more important than portraying an already familiar reality"

2997,3,rainiersulla,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It takes a missed period and a couple of pink lines to veer her off-course
2997,4,rainiersulla,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And just like that, she crashes headlong into a society that’s dead set on denying women their bodily autonomy"
2997,5,rainiersulla,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Racal’s performance is where the film’s soul resides
2997,6,rainiersulla,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She embodies Sunshine with a physicality and emotional depth that’s fully felt from start to finish
2997,7,rainiersulla,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her sobs are painful to watch, but she’s given some respite she can hold onto: the comradeship among women"
2997,8,rainiersulla,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Jennica Garcia’s Geleen, Sunshine’s older sister, is a particular standout"
2997,9,rainiersulla,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Fittingly, Jadaone is not soft around the edges, and the film is unflinching in its message"
2997,10,rainiersulla,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Yet Sunshine never feels preachy or didactic
2997,11,rainiersulla,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Because, to be fair, there’s really no neat, easy, and one-size-fits-all resolution for women like Sunshine"
2997,12,rainiersulla,2025-07-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But ultimately, it does pull back the curtain and invites you into a conversation, rather than passing judgment"
2998,1,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sabi ng coach ni Sunshine, “yung iniisip mo, ilang araw lang yan"

2998,3,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"pero ito, ang tagal na nito sayo"
2998,4,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” pertaining to her dream of representing her country in the olympics
2998,5,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"not knowing na yung problema ni Sunshine will long outlive her dream, and will likely stay with her for the rest of her life"
2998,6,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,hindi humingi si Sunshine ng opinyon sa mga tao sa paligid niya
2998,7,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"bago pa niya sabihin sa iba, alam na niya yung desisyon niya"
2998,8,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"she didn’t need anyone to ‘talk her out of it’, she only asked for their understanding"
2998,9,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,yun lang naman talaga hinihiling ng mga babaeng katulad ni Sunshine
2998,10,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"hindi naman nila sinasabing gawin mo, gusto lang nilang maintindihan mo kung bakit nila ‘to ginagawa"
2998,11,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"kasi wala naman silang choice, at hindi sila binibigyan ng choice ng bansang ‘to, at ng mga outdated beliefs nito"
2998,12,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"nakakalungkot isipin kung ilang babae na ang dumaan sa paghihirap at sakit na pinagdaanan din ni Sunshine dahil lang kinicriminalize ng batas at simbahan ang abortion, kaya ito nagiging unsafe"
2998,13,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"at mas lalong nakakalungkot isipin kung ilang babae na rin yung nakaranas ng paghihirap na pinagdadaanan ng mga nanay, kahit hindi naman nila ‘to ginusto"
2998,14,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,ewan wala na ‘ko masabi basta naiyak ako sa kwento ni Sunshine at sobrang nag eempathize ako sakanya kasi nakikita ko sakanya yung kaibigan ko
2998,15,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine represents all the women who dream big and are unapologetically true to themselves
2998,16,maxenne,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,we need more films like this in ph cinema
2999,1,yvesiendo,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,that shot of sunshine and her sister in the taxi
2999,2,yvesiendo,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"inject that shit in my VEINSthis was so beautifully lit, the night scenes were so captivating"
2999,3,yvesiendo,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,probably my favorite scenes aesthetically because it sets the mood of an isolating society for women but a mix with the light of hope
2999,4,yvesiendo,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the addition of the “future” children was pretty clever and adds a witty touch of when people say what if your aborted child becomes this
2999,5,yvesiendo,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it’s truly a women-centric film that we barely had a few seconds without the titular sunshine
2999,6,yvesiendo,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i love the grit mixed with wittiness— which i think are the quintessential qualities of filipino films
2999,7,yvesiendo,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,maybe im greedy but i wish we could’ve gotten more of how sunshine overcame the pregnancy and not just a “girl who is going to be okay” scene
2999,8,yvesiendo,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"if they were gonna represent the struggles of women, possibly be the face of a movement, and be “gritty,” they should’ve went all the way"
2999,9,yvesiendo,2025-08-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it just felt incomplete and leaves an unsatisfying feeling that we are still stuck (which is true but i wanted more

3214,2,navinhendrix,2025-12-06 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,It’s heart wrecking to realise that still there’s a country with total ban on “Abortion” irrespective of the way got the girl pregnant (even rape) or the condition of the pregnant woman

3214,7,navinhendrix,2025-12-06 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,Where she just keeps hitting her stomach with bare hand hoping it’d kill the baby or the approach of bringing in surrealism (or mythology) to show the unborn kids’ connection and interactions with their yet to give birth Mom had made it much more harder for us to come over it

3216,4,_jxcx,2025-12-06 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Giving agency to the people whose decisions will only affect them anyway sounds so simple since you can apply it to almost anything, but once abortion is mentioned, suddenly some people want to control the decisions of other people"
3216,5,_jxcx,2025-12-06 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Religion is obviously at the forefront of this topic

3797,1,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is one of those rare Filipino films that refuses to look away
3797,2,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Instead of sugarcoating or romanticizing the world its characters inhabit, it confronts the audience with the uncomfortable truths we collectively sidestep—the toxic mindsets we inherit, the social issues we normalize, and the moral rigidity we mistake for virtue"
3797,3,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What makes the film remarkable is its honesty
3797,4,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It acknowledges how deeply ingrained complacency is in our culture, how we often witness injustice, misogyny, or dysfunction and simply shrug, labeling it as “ganun talaga"
3797,5,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” Sunshine exposes that mentality for what it is: a quiet violence that enables suffering
3797,6,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film does not preach; it simply presents the weight of these realities with clarity and emotional intelligence, letting the audience feel the consequences of silence and inaction"
3797,7,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Its commentary on anti-abortion attitudes is especially bold for Philippine cinema
3797,8,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Rather than reducing the debate to dogma or melodrama, the film shows how anti-abortion rhetoric becomes a peril for women; not just physically, but emotionally, socially, and economically"
3797,9,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It reveals how denying reproductive autonomy restricts their futures, limits their ambitions, and punishes them for choices men are rarely held accountable for"
3797,10,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine portrays this with nuance: the internal conflict, the fear of judgment, the systemic lack of support, and the complete absence of safe options"
3797,11,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film understands that this isn’t just a “moral issue”—it’s a structural one, tied to poverty, misogyny, and societal expectations about what women owe to the world"
3797,12,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ultimately, Sunshine is more than a movie; it’s a critique of the culture that raised us"
3797,13,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It forces us to ask why we maintain harmful traditions, why morality is weaponized against women, and why we accept inequality as a norm"
3797,14,aijikken,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Its power lies in its refusal to let the audience remain comfortable, and in reminding us that the first step toward progress is learning to confront what we’ve been taught to ignore"

3857,4,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I think it's fair to say (and undeniably so) that this is an important and a refreshing story on what's the take of abortion & body autonomy here in the Philippines and I do appreciate this movie for that

3857,7,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It started really strong and direct to the point which I really liked
3857,8,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"By the next part, we'd see a little girl who follows Sunshine"

3857,10,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This device they used provided a bit of comic relief in the movie which I thought is cute and actually can be an effective way to delve deeper sentimentally because its so personal
3857,11,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, I came to learn (through online reading) that she is indeed her unborn future child (bc of Ariana disappearing)"
3857,12,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"To be honest, I couldn't finalize my thoughts on this whether I like it or not because with that in mind, the mix message does confuse some a bit on whether or not it's a ""pro-life"" but I guess that could also be the point that it is complicated"
3857,13,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Afterall, Sunshine did kept coming back to the church scenes and this can represent a lot of women who faces/d the same situation"
3857,14,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I just thought the movie might have to clarify in telling that message
3857,15,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I also much prefer her being Sunshine's inner child (which could be a ""tangible"" reminder on what the whole movie is all about, Sunshine taking control of her own life and the dream of being a national athlete ever since she's a child)"
3857,16,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But the line ""Gets ko na"" have such a great impact on people because of its ""casualness"" but its the words that has a really heavy weight on it that I thought is effective to pull people's heartstrings in"
3857,17,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Another aspect of the movie that kinda lacked for me which is, I think a big part of it: I want to see how much Sunshine wants it by seeing her own training to be a gymnast"
3857,18,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What does she do every day as a training athlete
3857,19,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,How does she balance everything in her life-- being a sister/aunt/student/friend/a woman in general while also being a training athlete
3857,20,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What do you to do train as a gymnast
3857,21,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"How heavy does it weigh on her that she's truly doing every thing she can to be in olympics and be a great gymnast, what does it look like"
3857,22,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I wished she saw that a bit (even just in a montage) before or during the moment she found out she got pregnant
3857,23,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I want to see her really work hard and see how much blood, sweat, and tears and really feel and see that ""goddamn it i want this so bad"" and not just tell it"
3857,24,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I guess what I want to say is that I want more training scenes too because I am also interested in watching gymnasts do their thing haha
3857,25,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I also thought that by the 3/4 part of the movie where we do meet Ariana is kinda took a different turn for the movie
3857,26,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I am not sure if it is necessary that we meet another kid (Ariana, not Mary Grace) and that maybe without that, they could still end up getting the same storyline/result (though don't get me wrong, I did like Ariana, i think she's fab)"
3857,27,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It also didn't do much impact on Sunshine's decision but rather it does prove how fucked up it is that this happen in reality and how shitty it is again that we don't have much (legal and safe, known) access to women's sexual and reproductive health services, let alone being a woman/person who's forced into something they aren't ready to be/never wanted be in the first place"
3857,28,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"More so, the visuals and cinematography, can't deny that it is beautiful, that's a given"
3857,29,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Acting is amazing, no notes no doubt"
3857,30,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"A little predictable on emphasizing on the Manila landscape and scenery although it is still beautiful to look at (especially considering to people haven't been to Manila/Philippines, at least they'd get the gist of it even though its not all picturesque all the time)"
3857,31,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I especially appreciate the movie getting in deep and showing the grim & messy ways of taking different methods of abortion
3857,32,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I thought its very important to see how harrowing and fucking hard/harsh/unfair/dangerous it is that women have to/had no choice to do experiences like these
3857,33,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I only wished that they showed the method of when Sunshine made an appointment for that Doctor Helena because maybe it could also show that abortion could also have safe and harmless way that would make people feel less wary and scared of it and maybe even talk about it
3857,34,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"With all that, in conclusion I think I do like this movie"
3857,35,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It is an important movie to exists especially at our modern times, it's long overdue that we finally talk about this here in our country"
3857,36,jazsisante7,2025-12-04 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I hope we keep talking about it because it is necessary for us we want to keep fighting for women's rights

3873,8,slimedeni,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i love how this film doesn’t just show us the story of a teenage girl who got pregnant while chasing her dreams—it is a story of all the girls and women who are forced to carry a baggage they never asked for
3873,9,slimedeni,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,we saw their hardships and struggles
3873,10,slimedeni,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it also shows us how flawed our system is and how hypocritical some religious people are
3873,11,slimedeni,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this should be a wake up call
3873,12,slimedeni,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the little girl (annika) doesn’t just represent sunshine’s unborn child—she also represents us
3873,13,slimedeni,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,we only see abortion and choosing oneself as something wrong and sinful because we are too blinded by what was merely taught to us
3873,14,slimedeni,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,we never get to see or feel what others feel

3874,4,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,htmlAntoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine has been one of our most anticipated local releases of the year and it does not disappoint
3874,5,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Emotionally charged and socially resonant, the film tackles teen pregnancy and the realities of limited reproductive rights in the Philippines with honesty and empathy"
3874,6,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While it may not offer clear-cut moral answers, Sunshine succeeds in revealing the real and painful stakes of becoming a young mother tackling equally both sides of the moral coin"
3874,7,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,National gymnast Sunshine (Maris Racal) has always dreamed of competing in the Olympics
3874,8,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"With qualifiers fast approaching, she pushes her body to its limits until she suddenly faints during training"
3874,9,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What she assumes is exhaustion from her intense regimen and strict diet turns out to be something far more life-altering: she is pregnant
3874,10,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At only 19 and with her lifelong dream on the line, Sunshine faces a bitter decision: keep the child and lose her final chance at the Olympics, or pursue an illegal abortion and grapple with the moral and emotional fallout"
3874,11,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As expected, Sunshine doesn’t shy away from tough conversations"
3874,12,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Its central dilemma is painfully relatable, regardless of where you stand on the right to choose in a predominantly Catholic country"
3874,13,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal is a revelation, delivering a nuanced and deeply human performance as a young athlete forced to confront consequences that will shape the rest of her life"
3874,14,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And while we won’t spoil where the story ultimately lands, the film takes a definitive stance without betraying the complexity of its subject matter"
3874,15,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It was a balancing act handled with notable care
3874,16,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What elevates Sunshine further is how vividly it captures the societal pressures and chaotic realities of Philippine society when it comes to the right to choose
3874,17,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The judgment, the ironies, the lack of support systems, everything feels painfully authentic and grounded"
3874,18,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Where the film stumbles slightly is in its more fantastical elements
3874,19,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Though the intent behind these sequences is clear, they often feel out of place and not fully integrated into the narrative, appearing more convenient than cohesive"
3874,20,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Still, Sunshine is a compelling and important watch and not only for Maris Racal’s standout performance but for its bold and compassionate exploration of an issue that remains deeply relevant in modern Philippine society"
3874,21,reeladvicenet,2025-11-27 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s a film that provokes and ultimately shines

3876,3,bobbiebinges,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris Racal also did a phenomenal job in portraying the titular character and so did the other actors
3876,4,bobbiebinges,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The story, though it can be a little ""in your face"" at times really drives the message home"

3880,4,badjaja,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kailanman ay hindi magiging pro-women ang kahit anumang sistema dito sa Pilipinas kung patuloy na babahiran ng relihiyon ang mga batas na ipinapatupad

3880,6,badjaja,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Walang Sunshine, o kahit sinumang babae, ang dapat na isakripisyo ang kanyang mga pangarap"

3887,1,lookitsaworm,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,felt this film deeply in my soul bc: count 1: im a woman in a predominantly conservative country count 2: ive had a pregnancy scare count 3: same financial situation as sunshine count 4: film set in the areas i frequent
3888,1,vicsvaporub,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this feels very similar to brocka in that it portrays manila as a city full of hardship and loneliness that can leave you so disillusioned and alienated; and where hope and humanity exist on the fringes of it
3888,2,vicsvaporub,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it's a working-class story with working-class sentiments that fully takes on its own identity because jadaone is able to portray such familar elements in a way that feel completely isolating; the interiors of jeepneys, tricycles, shabby motels, clinics — everything feels so alien"
3888,3,vicsvaporub,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"which, i guess, offers many people unfamiliar with what these woman go through a much-needed perspective on the importance of dignity and bodily autonomy and how violent, horrible men try to take that away from many women"
3888,4,vicsvaporub,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i think it's also worth noting that religion and patriarchy play such a prominent role here in oppression; jadaone laser-focused on placing religious beliefs and preconceived notions about abortion in the spotlight, all the more affected by teenage pregnancy and how religion has kind of shaped the way many filipinos treat abortion as something so taboo and inhuman that they completely forget how it affects the mother"
3888,5,vicsvaporub,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and it's brought to life by a really incredible maris racal; shaped by all the adversity — the kind of performance that requires you to bare your soul to the audience, to beg them to see the humanity behind the people suffering from religious oppression, and why access to abortion services — even in a heavily catholic country — is of utmost importance"

3890,17,wrenvill,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I think a more important question is: do we need these kinds of films

3928,2,sircylovesyou,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The moral codes and expectations instilled in us from childhood often determine whether society views abortion as a sinful act or a necessary choice, and this cultural tension becomes the silent force shaping many young women’s lives"

3928,7,sircylovesyou,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Through Racal’s nuanced portrayal, the narrative exposes the cultural contradictions we live with: a society that celebrates the achievements of young women yet imposes rigid expectations on their bodies and choices"
3928,8,sircylovesyou,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film invites the audience to move beyond judgment and recognize the quiet courage required to stand at the crossroads of identity, aspiration, and responsibility"
3928,9,sircylovesyou,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In grounding a personal crisis within the broader context of Philippine social norms, the film becomes more than a character study; it becomes a commentary on how we, as a society, often fail to extend empathy to young women navigating impossible circumstances"

4032,7,jazzphen,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As a man, I always believed that i am no position to speak about what women should and shouldn't do about their bodies, but will absolutely support the concept of abortion"
4032,8,jazzphen,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"When we speak about abortion in a country that is like the Philippines, that is so centered on religion, abortion becomes a taboo, illegal and unethical"

4032,11,jazzphen,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I will just make it clear that i think this film is not pro abortion or anti life, without directly stating it, the film focuses on making better decisions, the importance of protection, sex is more common than we think which is ironic in the Philippines that is so religious but that’s ok, this country just needs proper education and thats it"
4032,13,jazzphen,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"If you are going to argue with me about me being ok about abortion or use of protection, I’m going to tell you this, how dare you bring a life in this world, in this country that cant do anything about poverty, cant do anything about corrupt politicians, cant vote right, doesn't have an accessible healthcare and on top of that, if you’re a man, stfu, and if you’re a woman, who is not ready, physically, mentally and financially, Ari and that young girl doesn’t deserve to live like that, on the streets or getting abused"
4032,14,jazzphen,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But if you are, financially stable, mentally stable and physically stable with a nice and healthy environment to grow a living thing then go fucking crazy"

4074,1,patroclues,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i get a lot of the criticisms with the film and i do think it could have examined more without trying to be palatable to religious filipinos but i do hope the message is clear to anyone still in doubt of the rights women deserve in this country
4075,1,nicnoks,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i kept thinking about this after watching it the first time
4075,2,nicnoks,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i get you sunshine
4076,1,eveermore,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,sedih  kasian ih
4077,1,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ang hirap maging babaeng puno ng pangarap
4077,2,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film Sunshine (2024) resonated with me because it honestly depicts how unforgiving reality can be
4077,3,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It shows how quickly people judge young women, often before they even have a chance to breathe or ask for help"
4077,4,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film also makes painfully clear how the lack of reproductive rights pushes women toward risky, sometimes dangerous choices"
4077,5,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"You can almost feel Sunshine being boxed in on all sides, not because she did anything wrong, but because society refuses to give her real options"
4077,6,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Women in the Philippines face judgment, limited choices, and immense pressure around pregnancy"
4077,7,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And the film makes a point I strongly agree with: no government or religious institution should dictate what a woman does with her body
4077,8,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Those decisions belong to the person living that reality, not to people watching from a distance"
4077,9,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine made the right choice
4077,10,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sobrang taboo sa Pilipinas ang usapang abortion, pero at least the child didn’t grow up feeling guilty or resenting their mother for what might have happened if they hadn’t been born"
4077,11,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s better for a child to know they were truly wanted, rather than feeling like the product of someone else’s dilemma"
4077,12,flreu,2025-12-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Constantly being told they’re a blessing can’t replace the sense of being genuinely chosen

4197,9,4bgl,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"nagdebate kami noon about sa abortion, ang sabi ko gagawin ko kasi sarili ko ang iniisip ko, na hindi ko kaya at hindi ako ready"

4203,1,sinrue,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the film moves slowly, almost cautiously, letting you sit with people who are trying to hold their lives together even when everything around them keeps slipping sideways"
4203,2,sinrue,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,nothing is exaggerated; it all feels painfully ordinary in the way real lives are
4203,3,sinrue,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the characters are not shouting for answers, they are just trying to make sense of the days piling up"
4203,4,sinrue,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,there is this constant push and pull between wanting to break free and accepting that the world has edges you cannot always escape

4204,3,njcdxx,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Why is it ever that when a woman bears life, they are to sacrifice their own dreams and on the other side, men continues to live on vicariously"
4204,4,njcdxx,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And so Sunshine flipped the narrative
4204,5,njcdxx,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Live a long good life, Sunshine :)"

4206,1,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It was true when they said that this was a brave film
4206,2,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"To be one of the first films in pinoy cinema to explore a pro-choice and an unwanted pregnancy narrative is indeed brave, especially when you know the Philippines’ socio-political and religious climate around topics regarding sex, female desires, pregnancy, bodily autonomy, and parenthood"
4206,3,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There were unfortunately some parts of the film that felt like they didn’t work
4206,4,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I’m not sure but Sunshine’s decision to abort felt too quick
4206,5,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And her dream to be an Olympian felt underexplored and more of her coach’s
4206,6,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We’re told rather than shown that it was hers
4206,7,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The inclusion of Annika Co whose character can be interpreted as Sunshine’s subconscious/ego or unborn child or whatnot sometimes felt irritating to watch (sorry not sorry)
4206,8,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But I guess to reach more towards a predominantly Filipino audience and to highlight Sunshine still being a (teen) child who’s forced to confront the consequences of her choices by a child: worked
4206,9,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I don’t know
4206,10,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Not to mention that it felt a little silly to include two other characters, where one was another pregnant teen girl, that lowkey felt like their stories were being shoved down to the audience’s throats"
4206,11,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And in the end, felt shallow"
4206,12,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I just think that I hoped they showed more of the technicalities of her being an athlete
4206,13,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Rhythmic gymnastics is considered an elite sport
4206,14,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And when you consider it in the Philippine context – the film didn’t really show what was at stake of being an athlete in this sport
4206,15,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film’s strong aspects are definitely on the score, cinematography (particularly to highlight the corners of Manila as this chaotic, packed, and cruel city), and of course: Maris’ performance as Sunshine"
4206,16,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,There were scenes that hit hard and heavy
4206,17,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The irony of abortion drugs sold and found in the street outside a church
4206,18,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The motel scene to show Sunshine’s quiet desperation
4206,19,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her final rehearsal for her routine before her “gets ko na” scene with Annika (where I cried unfort bcz luteal phase duh)
4206,20,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film does show you a glimpse of the unforgiving reality of what many Filipino women go through everyday: teenage pregnancy, overcrowded and underfunded public hospitals, and the lack of comprehensive sexuality education about sexuality and sexual and reproductive health"
4206,21,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It lacked, sure"
4206,22,letshencook,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But I guess, for pinoy cinema to start tackling difficult topics such as this: it’s a start"
4207,1,lyeski,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,genuinely cried so much this isn't funny
4208,1,ladyfcrtune,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This story is so bold in its themes and it got all of it across with no bullshit
4208,2,ladyfcrtune,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It got everything across so straightforwardly, and I applaud it for that"
4208,3,ladyfcrtune,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Criminalizing abortion only makes things worse, women should be able to make decisions about their own body—not men, not the law, not religion"
4208,4,ladyfcrtune,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Thank you to everyone who made this movie happen, truly"

4387,2,patriciaangelx,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Not only does it talk about teenage pregnancy, pre-marital sex and how women's lives, hopes and dreams being put aside for a pregnancy, but it also talks about the uncomfortable truth of how abortion really is in the Philippines and how unsafe, unavailable and painfully unaccepted it is in our society"

4389,3,gio_miguelo,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I for one can never fully give my stance since I am religious but also because I am not a woman

4389,5,gio_miguelo,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"So, to see pros and cons of wanting to abort a child as well as choosing to go through abortion was quite engaging and I understand things more now"
4389,6,gio_miguelo,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"To see the horrors of using illegal ways of abortion was eye-opening, in all honesty"

4389,9,gio_miguelo,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Also, it was blatantly obvious that the mysterious (and annoying, mind you) little girl was Sunshine's supposed daughter"

4396,7,iceddunkin,2025-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Anyways, just for the sake of sharing kahit onti:(1) I agree that the supposed personified child is, safe to say, contradictory"
4396,8,iceddunkin,2025-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Kahit may explanation si Direk Jadaone, it still felt conflicting and made the film unsure of itself"

4397,1,moniquea,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i feel like i could have empathized with her more if the film showed how her imaginary child gradually understands sunshine from her own perspective like how
4397,2,moniquea,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,How would she even know
4397,3,moniquea,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"lol aside from that, we could’ve explored more of why this sport is so important to her instead of adding a subplot (that 13 yr old girl case) that makes her situation feel less serious"
4397,4,moniquea,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"her feelings and reasons are all valid but that subplot makes her look careless and kinda dumb lol so it’s hard to root for her tbh also, her imaginary child looks cute, healthy, and fun to talk with"
4397,5,moniquea,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,why would she think of aborting her if that’s what her imaginary child is going to look like growing up
4397,6,moniquea,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the imaginary child should reflect the life she can’t give or the pressure she feels or at least something burdensome that is so much worse, not some fantasy lolz"

4398,2,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Siguro tumaas lang expectations ko dahil sa dami ng reviews na nakita ko sa social media (na hindi ko binasa para iwas spoiler) at syempre dahil sa haba ng theatrical run niya
4398,3,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What I genuinely liked were the performances
4398,4,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"They hired competent actors, and it shows"
4398,5,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And since marami na rin akong napanood na Jadaone films, andun pa rin ’yun trademark angst niya—and I love that for her"

4398,7,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Siguro kasi sobrang dami ko nang nakitang ganitong atake sa short films at full-length lalo na kapag tungkol sa abortion kaya hindi na bago sa paningin ko
4398,8,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I get kung bakit siya ginamit as a plot device to feel “innovative,” especially with a message that wants to tell the masses na okay lang piliin ang sarili at magpa-abort"
4398,9,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Importanteng mensahe ’yun
4398,10,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kaso… hindi ako nadala emotionally
4398,11,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,May mga babae akong kakilala na nagpa-abort at grabe ’yun pinagdaanan nila
4398,12,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Compared sa mga kwentong narinig ko, ang nipis lang ng emotional experience ni Sunshine sa film"
4398,13,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Kaya siguro nainis ako sa imaginary children na atake
4398,14,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The feeling itself of learning you're pregnant tapos mag-decide to get an abortion already carries so many complex emotions
4398,15,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hindi mo na kailangan idikit pa ’yun mga bata to prove a point
4398,16,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hindi ko rin nagustuhan na parang ang babaw ng pagkakahandle sa kwento nung batang na-rape ng tito niya
4398,17,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Pakiramdam ko ibang pelikula dapat ’yun—isang pelikula na mas malalim at mas handang i-tackle ’yun bigat ng topic
4398,18,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Feeling ko kung lalaki ka, baka mas ""oks"" itong film para sayo"
4398,19,sunjazzfilms,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Pero bilang babae… parang kulang pa

4399,1,goodatama,2025-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I’m very grateful at this film’s attempt to keep the narrative always in favor of pro-choice
4399,2,goodatama,2025-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"For a recent narrative on a young woman’s choice about her pregnancy, this film plays a lot of modern elements well"
4399,3,goodatama,2025-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Social media is used several times throughout the start of the film, but none of it is cliché or abhorrent"
4399,4,goodatama,2025-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Each social media is used in a very relatable way, which kind of shocked me but it was a feature of the film I really appreciated"

4399,6,goodatama,2025-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In terms of tonal shifting, the film does a really great job at keeping it’s theme and message intense and suffocating, much like Sunshine’s need to make a decision"
4399,7,goodatama,2025-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It should ALWAYS be the woman’s choice

4401,2,mangostine,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it did not feel exaggerated, hits its points especially the tiniest details such as the looming hunch of security in the depths of Manila (a place full of otherworldly side quests, brimming of characters,, from experience)"
4401,3,mangostine,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Annika Co's acting was great, seeing her go from showtime to an actual movie is such a heartwarming sight"
4401,4,mangostine,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i love home but man there is so many things that are outdated, the mention of using ""hilot"" to mend a situation of a pregnant 13 year old girl, women’s health care OR even the fuck ass health care system itself, which is greatly shown, overpopulation, etc, you name it"
4401,5,mangostine,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it's too corrupt, and i feel like ending the film with sunshine on her own way was the best (and only) way to do it"

4405,2,mus3ira,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it truly is a privilege to have the right to our own bodies
4405,3,mus3ira,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the writing of this movie was quite interesting and i believe the children held so much significance to the development and the decision making of the main lead
4405,4,mus3ira,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i believe they are the make-believe consciousness of the “thing” (lets stop calling them babies PLEASE) inside the main lead and the 13yo girl, and i LOVED being so confused and then realising this later on"
4405,5,mus3ira,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,“drown out the noise” something we need to tell ourselves more often than not
4405,6,mus3ira,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,we shouldn’t listen to outside opinions of what to do with ourselves and our own bodies
4405,7,mus3ira,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it is the happiest way to live and love life
4405,8,mus3ira,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i hold this movie very close to my heart and living in a country where abortion is legal is a HUGE privilege and i look forward to the days where religious doctrine dont run the government and put its citizens in a chokehold
4405,9,mus3ira,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"religious or not, DON’T tell ANYONE what to do with their bodies, we are all in different circumstances and have wants/dreams/aspirations we’d like to pursue for our own happiness and that’s not selfish"
4406,1,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,my best friend sent a message in the group chat saying “guys please don’t ever get pregnant” fresh after watching this
4406,2,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i laughed in my mind thinking how is that even gonna happen
4406,3,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,but here i am sobbing like a child and wishing that nobody ever gets pregnant against their will
4406,4,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"what a demented, horrifying, and pathetic world we live in"
4406,5,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this film plunged my heart deep into my guts from the very beginning
4406,6,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it’s already hard being a girl and then you have systems in place that form a fist around your throat
4406,7,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,this was so well made that none of it looked fake
4406,8,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i mean it’s so funny to see the juxtaposition of the church and the “pamparegla” vendors that are still there today
4406,9,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,maybe it’s more sad really but that is the reality
4406,10,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i don’t know i guess it is so hard to explain the horrors of being a woman
4406,11,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,men get to conveniently be selfish as part of their nature but putting yourself first as a girl needs an apology from god
4406,12,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"men regard laws only when they can deny women any autonomy, but break them with ease for their own disgusting desires and freely laugh about it with their friends"
4406,13,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i am so glad this film ended the way it did but i am also very sad and angry that girls who meet the same fate have to suffer maybe even worse than this
4406,14,parbhlematic,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and that’s when i know god is not a woman
4407,1,titingtumulak,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Society claims to protect the “unborn child,” yet the conversation often leaves out the women whose bodies, health, and futures are directly involved"
4407,2,titingtumulak,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It feels unsettling to watch how easily society dismisses the experiences of women, as if their lives become secondary the moment they become pregnant"
4407,3,titingtumulak,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I can’t ignore how deeply this connects to the patriarchal norms I’ve grown up seeing
4407,4,titingtumulak,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"From subtle expectations to outright judgment, there is a long history of controlling women’s bodies and decisions"
4407,5,titingtumulak,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The shame placed on those who consider or seek abortion is not just personal; it is cultural and religious, embedded in systems that teach us to shame and question women’s choices instead of supporting them"
4407,6,titingtumulak,2025-12-02 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This made us more aware of how easily society turns compassion into condemnation when it comes to reproductive health

4409,2,cinephileckurt,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The fantastical elements really took me out a bit and some scenes where it's like spoonfeeding the information to the viewers imo
4409,3,cinephileckurt,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I'm still rooting for Jadaone and some other directors to make more realistic and relatable mainstream drama films

4411,2,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Jadaone films always stab softly, pero ito"
4411,3,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Parang dahan-dahang hinihiwa yung dibdib, layer by layer, para ipakita yung takot, pangarap, at kahihiyang matagal nang nakatago sa ilalim ng “ok lang ako"
4411,4,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"”this is the kind of film na hindi mo papanoorin para gumaan ang loob mo, papanoorin mo siya para maalala kung gaano kabigat mabuhay bilang babae sa bansang ayaw umamin na may mali sa sistemang sinasamba nito"
4411,5,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine doesn’t preach
4411,6,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it just stands there, raw and trembling, asking the kind of questions we’re trained to avoid:Paano ka pipili kung lahat ng choice mo ay kasalanan sa mata ng iba"
4411,7,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Paano ka lalaban kung mismong katawan mo ang pinaparusahan
4411,8,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris Racal is devastating in ways na hindi loud pero lumalalim
4411,9,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,hindi siya yung tipikal na dramatic heroine — she’s simply a girl suspended between a dream and a reality that keeps shrinking her choices
4411,10,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,her silence says more than any monologue could
4411,11,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"every frame feels like a confession: hesitant, trembling, pero totoo"
4411,12,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and what struck me most wasn’t the gymnastics, or even the central issue of abortion"
4411,13,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it was the ache between who we want to become and what our circumstances force us to be
4411,14,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"nakakapagod maging babae sa Pilipinas — laging may moral lesson, laging monitored, laging may takot na isang maling galaw lang, tapos na ang lahat"
4411,15,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,parang ang liit liit ng mundo mo kahit ang laki laki ng pangarap mo
4411,16,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine doesn’t romanticize any of this
4411,17,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"walang sermon, walang cinematic gloss"
4411,18,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"just a raw, unfiltered look at how dreams bruise under a society na mas mabilis manghusga kaysa umintindi"
4411,19,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the film’s imperfections — the loose ends, the uneven metaphors, the sometimes rushed stakes — oddly work in its favor"
4411,20,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,because real life isn’t clean
4411,21,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,hindi linear ang trauma
4411,22,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,hindi laging malinaw ang choice
4411,23,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and maybe that’s the point: that we’re all navigating a world built not on empathy, but on fear and control"
4411,24,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"in the end, Sunshine feels less like a movie and more like a mirror — one that forces you to sit with the darkness until you finally admit na masakit talaga ang liwanag"
4411,25,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it’s an eye-opener not because it shocks, but because it whispers truths we’ve mastered the art of ignoring"
4411,26,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"a film worth watching, not because it entertains, but because it confronts"
4411,27,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"because it nudges you to look beyond the screen and into the world we built… and ask, Bakit ganito"
4411,28,makimakkk,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And more importantly — hanggang kailan

4654,3,dicotalvarado,2025-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The craft here really shines, at just 90 or so minutes the film feels tightly-paced and confidently crafted through Jadaone's masterful direction, yet it still swings wide over several discussions and thoughts over its major theme in an arguably short amount of time"
4654,4,dicotalvarado,2025-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Mind you there's an element here that I'm not the biggest fan of-- I think the film could have actually eliminated it altogether as it feels inelegant especially against the overt realism of the rest of the film
4654,5,dicotalvarado,2025-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But otherwise it's easy to overlook this compared to how wise the rest of the film is

4862,2,haziah,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It shows how quickly people are forced into rigid sides—pro-choice or pro-life—without being allowed the space to exist as confused, scared, and human first"

5169,1,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine offers a quiet yet affecting exploration of teenage pregnancy and abortion—two issues deeply intertwined with the social and economic realities of our country
5169,2,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"What makes the film striking is its simplicity: it doesn’t rely on heavy dramatics, but instead allows its heartfelt moments and grounded storytelling to speak for themselves"
5169,3,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I particularly appreciated how the film subtly incorporated supernatural elements
5169,4,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Rather than distracting from the story, these touches added depth and symbolism, making the film feel both intimate and introspective"
5169,5,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s a creative choice that gives Sunshine a unique emotional texture
5169,6,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As someone who grew up Catholic, I’ve never taken a firm stance on abortion; I’ve mostly remained indifferent or unsure"
5169,7,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But this film pushed me to reflect on the bigger picture
5169,8,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It gently raises a painful yet necessary question: Why bring a child into a country that struggles to provide a dignified, nurturing environment for its people"
5169,9,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Without forcing a specific viewpoint, Sunshine invites viewers to confront the harsh realities that many young Filipinos face—stories that are often ignored or oversimplified"
5169,10,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Overall, Sunshine succeeds not just as a piece of cinema, but as a conversation starter"
5169,11,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It lingers with you, urging you to think about compassion, choice, and the societal conditions that shape both"
5169,12,theironcolonel,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s a simple film, but one with a resonance that’s hard to forget"

5182,8,soieii,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Nakakalungkot noong ipinakita sa movie na ito kung gaano kalala ang situation sa public hospitals—kulang sa resources, walang safe at stigma-free options, mayroon pa ngang nanganganak na lang sa sahig dahil sa kakulangan sa mga tao at kagamitan"
5182,9,soieii,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Kaya hindi nakapagtataka na for many women, the “safest” choice ends up being underground options, kahit sobrang risky"
5182,10,soieii,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Mas ironic pa, kasi nasa paligid lang ng simbahan ang mga nagbebenta ng pamparegla, hilot, at kung anu-ano, tapos ang narrative ng church: “kung natukso ka, talo ka"
5182,11,soieii,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,” Kaya understandable that the “tukso” becomes sometimes the only lifeline for someone desperate

5238,6,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the film uses restraint as its sharpest tool
5238,7,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the dim, muted visuals; the overwhelming noise of her environment; the way the camera locks her in the centre of the frame"
5238,8,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"always boxed in, always between lines"
5238,9,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"all emphasise how trapped she is by the social and religious stigma, and by a society that refuses to recognise abortion as a woman's right"
5238,10,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the blurred backgrounds aren't just aesthetic; they reinforce her disconnection from the world around her
5238,11,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"she doesn't have the luxury to care about anything beyond her immediate reality: herself, her dreams, and the looming consequences of every decision she faces"
5238,12,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and that is the tragedy, sunshine is a young woman with ambition, yet she navigates a world that is unforgiving"

5238,14,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"with abortion vilified and access almost impossible, the film illustrates how society corners, isolates, and silences young mothers"
5238,15,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"not with loud condemnation, but with quiet, crushing inevitability"
5238,16,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it is a devastating portrait of how systemic and cultural forces conspire to limit women's autonomy, and a reminder of the human cost of denying choice"
5238,17,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"one of the most striking elements of the film, for me, is its gendered power dynamic"
5238,18,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"every character, without exception, imposes his own beliefs onto sunshine"
5238,19,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"urging her to keep the baby, citing legality, morality, or personal conviction"
5238,20,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"their ""advice"" is never about her well-being, it's about controlling her choices"
5238,21,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the absence of a single moment where a man asks what she wants is not accidental, it reflects a broader social structure where women's autonomy is secondary to male authority"
5238,22,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the women in the film, however, present a more nuanced spectrum"
5238,23,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"some internalise patriarchal norms and unintentionally reinforce them, but many others recognise sunshine's struggle immediately"
5238,24,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"they empathise not because they have the answers, but because they understand the emotional, economic, and social burden that falls disproportionately on women"
5238,25,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,their solidarity is quiet but powerful
5238,26,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"a direct contrast to the coercive, dismissive tone of the male characters"
5238,27,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"the film ultimately critiques how systems built and upheld by men deny women agency, especially around reproductive choices"
5238,28,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"in a society where institutional and cultural norms consistently silence women, the film shows that women often became each other's only source of validation, understanding, and empowerment"
5238,29,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,no scene is waster
5238,30,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,nothing is filler
5238,31,baobeisaur,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"every character is intentionally placed, each one shaping or limiting sunshine's decisions in ways that feel painfully real"

5241,5,alberttseno,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I thought an hour and a half wouldn’t be enough to dig deeper into the journey of Sunshine but it was actually just enough to see all of it
5241,6,alberttseno,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Although, there were unnecessary choices made in the film that I disliked and that I wish were done differently and I wish saw more of Sunshine’s character in the lowest of lows or maybe I’m just greedy"
5241,7,alberttseno,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However,Maris Racal is a revelation"
5241,8,alberttseno,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And for the Philippines to have such a film like this one that speaks to so many women, even men, in the country"
5241,9,alberttseno,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I hope this is a step forward for the country to move progressively and this be a force for politicians to pass that bill
5241,10,alberttseno,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Because after all, films are made to speak out, protest, and to implement change"
5241,11,alberttseno,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Lastly, Sunshine is such a huge step towards good filmmaking in the Philippines"
5241,12,alberttseno,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,We need more films that speak of truth and of society

5241,14,alberttseno,2025-11-30 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Though Sunshine isn’t perfect as a film itself, the courage and the amount of truth revealed in an hour and a half are enough to have the voices of so many women be heard"

5352,3,astrocampo,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That, somehow, Sunshine is a lesson in, as the elders say, ""opening your legs for just about anybody""; that she did not listen to the adage is an absolute failing on her part, and its consequences fall rightfully on her shoulders"
5352,4,astrocampo,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But here's the tricky bit: Sunshine could very well have been about a mother who could no longer give birth to another, and it would have still been met with the same logic-defying resistance that still places the blame squarely on the woman"
5352,5,astrocampo,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Minor gripes include a finicky plot device that, at times, feels jarring and slightly questionable in terms of messaging"
5352,6,astrocampo,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But it all feels egregious to say because the urgency of its existence really dwarfs over whatever minor flaws it may have
5352,7,astrocampo,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It also helps that Sunshine carried is so deftly by Maris Racal's and Jennica Garcia's career-defining performances, and a score by Rico Blanco that knows how to restrain and reintroduce itself in all the right moments"
5352,8,astrocampo,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine cracks open a conversation on an obstinately immovable subject, and unflinchingly exposes the grim reality on how our women and girls move about our society, bearing the problems that we could easily find solutions to but which our religious guilt and intolerance constantly shame us into denying"

5357,2,lkcmx,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the message is straightforward and clear
5357,3,lkcmx,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it showed us the reality of women alike that had to endure the consequences of the patriarchal oppression and the dominance of Catholicism in the country, which is something that the rightists would undoubtedly refuse to accept because they'd still believe their presumed ""norms"" are what they think what's ""best"" for everyone and in the country — which is so out of touch from reality and it's very frustrating"
5357,4,lkcmx,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"however, i just had a bit of a problem with the film's inclusion of imaginary children; which i think somehow holds it back from letting the main message have its full weight"

5420,1,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"if there is light, kahit konting-konti lang, we chase it—because sometimes that’s the only thing left for women to hold"
5420,2,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,sunshine (2025) is the kind of film na hindi ka pinapa-wow sa effects or spectacle
5420,3,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"instead, it sits beside you quietly, like a friend na alam lahat ng pagod mo kahit hindi mo sinabi"
5420,4,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it’s woman-centered in the most unsettling, honest way—walang sugarcoating, walang mythologizing, just the raw truth of being a girl in a country that asks you to endure more than it ever protects"
5420,5,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the film strips away the usual softness associated with its title
5420,6,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,sunshine isn’t light; she’s a girl trying to survive a world that keeps dimming her
5420,7,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and when the story touches the issue of abortion not being legalized in the Philippines, it doesn’t sensationalize it—pinapakita lang niya ‘yung totoo: na in this country, women are expected to carry consequences alone"
5420,8,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"that reproductive rights become moral battles instead of health and safety; na the system treats our pain like an inconvenience, our choices like crimes"
5420,9,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"‘yung internal struggle ni Sunshine—‘yung fear, guilt, confusion, desperation—hindi dahil “mahina siya,” but because society makes women feel cornered by circumstances we never chose"
5420,10,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and the film doesn’t villainize her for thinking about her future; it villainizes the world that forces her to justify wanting one
5420,11,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and then there’s Miggy
5420,12,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Miggy is… familiar
5420,13,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"not evil, not abusive, just painfully typical"
5420,14,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"he represents the kind of boyfriend most girls in the philippines know too well—the one who “cares,” but only until it requires accountability"
5420,15,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the boy who says “I’m here for you” pero umiilag sa big conversations
5420,16,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the boy who loves you but doesn’t understand the weight you carry because he’s never had to carry anything like it
5420,17,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Miggy is the embodiment of how boys in this country are raised: may freedom without consequence, may opinion without knowledge, may presence without responsibility"
5420,18,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"his reactions, his avoidance, even his attempts to comfort—they feel real because they’re exactly what so many girls have lived through"
5420,19,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,boys who think support is just saying “kaya natin ’to” while leaving the actual pain to us
5420,20,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,sunshine 2025 becomes a commentary on how women are taught to be accountable for everything—including mistakes that weren’t only theirs—while men are taught to be forgiven for everything
5420,21,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the movie doesn’t hate Miggy; it exposes him
5420,22,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it shows the casualness of male privilege, the way it slips into daily life unnoticed but heavy—always heavy—on our side"
5420,23,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and that’s what makes the film hit: it’s not loud, not preachy, not dramatic"
5420,24,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it just shows the truth—and the truth is already loud enough
5420,25,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"sunshine isn’t a story about brightness; it’s a story about women trying to navigate a world that refuses to make space for their choices, their fears, their bodies, their futures"
5420,26,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"it’s a film that says:the pain wasn’t yours alone, but somehow, you were the only one expected to carry it"
5420,27,chocopaolover,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and long after the credits, you’re left with that hurt—the kind that reminds you why we keep fighting for a world where women don’t have to beg for the right to their own lives"
5421,1,akenom47,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"pls papa God, let the PH decriminalize abortion"

5551,2,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Although I have personal reservations about Maris Racal due to past issues, her performance in this film was undeniably amazing"
5551,3,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sunshine is a definite eye-opener regarding religion, stigma, and the taboo surrounding abortion matters here in the Philippines"
5551,4,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I genuinely feel for all the women represented by the characters of Sunshine and Rhed
5551,5,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"They may have different names, but they share a rough, unfair path: being stigmatized and pressured to conform to religious and misogynistic beliefs about motherhood"
5551,6,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"They are forced into the role of nurturing a child, often without considering their own agency"
5551,7,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I particularly noticed the scene when Miggy and his father confronted Sunshine about her situation
5551,8,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,They never once asked her what she wanted
5551,9,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Their ""plans"" were simply laid out for her to accept without a word, effectively depriving her of choice"
5551,10,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This lack of genuine care is what hurts
5551,11,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Furthermore, the film shows how these women are forced to go through dangerous and unhygienic lengths just to pursue their personal dreams, highlighting how their rights as human beings are limited solely because of their CHOICE"
5551,12,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I appreciate this film immensely, and it should be talked about more"
5551,13,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The tragic reality of Rhed’s character, a 13-year-old victim raped and impregnated by her own uncle, is a situation faced by many"
5551,14,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Yet, victims like her are still discriminated against for wanting an abortion"
5551,15,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The movie effectively represents this toxicity, such as the scene where the OB-GYN cruelly orders a literally pale and blue Sunshine to ""repent"" while she is struggling in a hospital bed"
5551,16,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This film is beautifully made
5551,17,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I sincerely hope that someday, people will truly receive the message: Every woman should have a choice"
5551,18,camiiberry,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Depriving them of that fundamental choice does NOT make one a saint

5553,2,kleyaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's as good as I remember
5553,3,kleyaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It challenges the foundation of this county's backwards and outdated beliefs — the very fact that we are willing, as a nation, to limit what an individual, specifically, a woman's decisions with what she wants do to her own body even if it means them harm just to hold up centuries-old ideals, because what, we want to feel righteous and good people"
5553,4,kleyaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This kind of shit is barbaric and has no place in the current state of the world
5553,5,kleyaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The ending was very powerful

5553,7,kleyaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, I feel like final final scene was unnecessary, it could have ended with the ""gets ko na"" scene"

5555,4,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I know that tackling this kind of topic would raise brows to the people especially the one who’s spirituality believes that a women shouldn’t undergo abortion even if she really didn’t want to bear the child
5555,5,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Actually, it’s even funnier that this country preach that abortion should ban but the truth is there is a lack of education about sex, abortion, and contraceptives"
5555,6,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Additionally, it’s so hypocrisy and misogynistic that people really blame woman for getting pregnant but NOT THE MAN"
5555,7,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In fact, they are the ones who put babies inside the woman’s womb"
5555,8,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I really learned so many lessons in the movie which open my mind to the struggles of a woman
5555,9,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s disappointing that people keep preaching what’s right or wrong but THEY NEVER HELP AND UNDERSTAND THESE WOMEN
5555,10,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The movie open my mind that abortion SHOULD BE LEGALIZE
5555,11,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Abortion ISN’T a sin, murder, nor crime"
5555,12,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,IT’S A HEALTH CARE
5555,13,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s NOT selfish
5555,14,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s okay
5555,15,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But it is just sad that the Philippines is not yet ready to understand and tackle this kind of topic
5555,16,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I get Sunshine
5555,17,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The guilt-tripping, shame, and misogyny are tackled in a best possible way to give the viewers assurance and comfort"
5555,18,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Also, it gives reminder that Filipinos should really open their minds and change their mindset"
5555,19,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Women didn’t deserve the shame, the hate, and mostly the expectations that have been throwing to them just because THEY ARE WOMEN"
5555,20,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,For fucking sake
5555,21,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,WOMEN NEED SUPPORT NOT A FUCKING JUDGEMENT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO’S CLAIMING TO BE A SPIRITUALLY ACTIVE BUT CANNOT OPEN THEIR MINDS AND THINK RIGHT
5555,22,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I hope and wish that the government legalize abortion
5555,23,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is not a shameful thing to do
5555,24,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is not killing
5555,25,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is a self-care — A HEALTH CARE
5555,26,jelieloop,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,People should know and understand that

5707,5,hotgotto,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"(sarcasm meant)while i appreciate the gritty and emotional moments of the film especially when the focus is entirely on the movie’s protagonist who it’s named after (maris carried this entire film along with the supporting cast’s acting) it’s overshadowed by it’s dogshit abysmal surface level performative writing, its inclusion of imaginary children that is either a representation of the characters and their inner child or their unborn children which confuses and irritates me as they’re shown way too much, the on the nose messaging of conservatism in the philippines, the lack of detail on how important sunshine’s dream actually is because it focuses on another separate character that rids sunshine a chunk of her story and conflict, and the abstract, hollow message they’re trying to advocate for"
5707,6,hotgotto,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"genuinely, can we take the pen away from this grown ass woman"
5707,7,hotgotto,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"not only does she exploit the masa to serve her story but women as well, nakakabastos sa totoo lang, not very feminist and not very for the masa also—add to the fact that jadaone probably thinks that her audience is stupid and can’t read in between the lines for how she chooses to write the story"
5707,8,hotgotto,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,20.0,ltbx,"more actions, less words sana, more time spent in the writer’s room, less color-grading and filming quiapo’s slums for your poverty porn sana"

5709,7,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film I should see when tackling feminism
5709,8,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The film that shows how the Philippines lack support for its beautiful and brave women

5709,12,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,i also loved how fuckass men were portrayed in this movie
5709,13,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"walang kwentang jowa, walang kwentang kapatid, walang kwentang tatay, walang kwentang tito, walang kwentang doktor"

5709,22,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Yes, 13 years old pa lang siya"
5709,23,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The movie refuses to romanticize their situation
5709,24,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"instead, it leans into the uncomfortable truths of being a young woman in a society that praises discipline, resilience, and sacrifice yet offers little support when life derails"
5709,25,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Director Jadaone shapes the film with a raw, documentary-like honesty: tight shots of silent breakdowns, stripped-down scenes with no dramatic score, and a narrative that mirrors the suffocating pressure placed on young Filipinas navigating taboo choices"
5709,26,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Lastly, ang nagustuhan ko talaga sa film na to is the fact na the film didn’t fail to show and acknowledge the other women surrounding sunshine"
5709,27,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"women who, though not always in the spotlight, embody the many forms of pressure, expectation, and silent resilience that shape the world she moves in"
5709,28,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"they all carry their own versions of sacrifice: women praised for being disciplined, nurturing, and endlessly strong, yet rarely offered the same support they tirelessly give"
5709,29,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,like seriously
5709,30,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the maternity ward scene broke my heart so much  seeing allthe women sharing the same beds also shows how fucked up our healthcare system really is

5709,35,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Ironic lang na sa harap pa talaga ng mga rebulto ni santo niño nagtinda ng pampalaglag  these kinds of religious beliefs shouldn’t really hinder us from doing what’s right and best for ourselves
5709,36,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"and in showing these women’s quiet struggles, the film expands its emotional weight, reminding us that the story isn’t just about one girl’s burden but about an entire generation of women expected to endure everything while being thanked for it in silence"
5709,37,2yaaa,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"kulang pa tayo sa pansin, sa pagmamahal, at sa suporta"

5712,2,y2krzl,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The trailer was so promising and I expected a lot
5712,3,y2krzl,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I’m all for it from what they’re trying to convey but the storytelling wasn’t it
5712,4,y2krzl,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Execution is realistic tho
5712,5,y2krzl,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I believe most of us relates in jeepney scene when you’re in the verge of breaking down and you don’t know what to do but to breathe slowly and comfort yourself, hoping no one would notice"

5712,7,y2krzl,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But then again, they be trying to highlight everything all at once but failed to deliver why we’re here in the first place"
5712,8,y2krzl,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It was moving, as a woman"
5712,9,y2krzl,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,BUT AS A WOMAN I was hoping for a more impactful message since it opened a lot of discourse
5712,10,y2krzl,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Women are far more complex and I was looking for chaos in what a woman feels in a society where everyone are so entitled to decide on how a woman should act and carry themselves
5712,11,y2krzl,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The movie could’ve gone deeper, one that touches diff range of emotions"
5712,12,y2krzl,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It just doesn’t feel genuine, yk"
5712,13,y2krzl,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Overall, Im giving it 4 stars"

5731,4,samdotmov,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"What was perhaps intended as a bold attempt at cinematic expression to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour"
5731,5,samdotmov,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility

5731,9,samdotmov,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, frames it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics"

5731,12,samdotmov,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I hope it inspires other filmmakers to be bold in the face of a country that chooses to be blind to issues that continue to grow with no solutions in sight

5849,4,ratedj,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,taking away their future also means taking away the future of their children
5849,5,ratedj,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"both are really big factors to take in, but what truly matters is knowing what needs to be done today for a better tomorrow"
5849,6,ratedj,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"so if you’re asking me, the real selfishness here is doing what is deemed right by society just because they don’t realize how selfish bringing a life to a world that isn’t ready for you is"
5849,7,ratedj,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,it’s simple
5849,8,ratedj,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"they’re not ready, and that should be a good enough reason"
5849,9,ratedj,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and the way this was written and directed by a filipino woman is really brave storytelling

5851,1,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"First of all, I know that this movie premiered at the 49th Toronto International Film Festival in 2024 and arrived in Philippine cinemas 4 months ago"
5851,2,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And now that it finally dropped on Netflix… I hope I’m not too late to say it finally: This movie is powerful Antoinette Jadaone delivers one of her most fearless films yet with ‘’ — a coming-of-age sports drama that hits with quiet power and emotional honesty
5851,3,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Maris Racal plays the titular character, a young gymnast on the road to the Olympics"
5851,4,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Her world revolves around discipline, repetition, and the dream of making it to the competition she’s trained her whole life for"
5851,5,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But when she discovers she’s pregnant, her perfectly controlled world cracks open"
5851,6,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What I loved about the film is how it never sensationalizes her situation
5851,7,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine’s fear is treated with quiet realism
5851,8,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The movie acknowledges how complicated teenage pregnancy is, especially in a society where abortion, reproductive rights, and bodily autonomy remain heavily stigmatized and often misunderstood"
5851,9,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,These themes are controversial
5851,10,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And yes, the movie will divide people"
5851,11,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But ‘’ refuses to look away from the truth:
5851,13,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Maris is phenomenal here
5851,14,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She carries the entire emotional weight of the story with a performance that feels painfully real
5851,15,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She rarely breaks down on screen, but you think her internal collapse in the smallest expressions — the breath she holds, the way she avoids eye contact, the way she pushes her dream forward while everything else is falling apart"
5851,16,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The supporting cast — particularly Jennica Garcia, Meryll Soriano, Rhed Bustamante, and Xyriel Manabat — also elevate the film, each representing a different kind of pressure or support Sunshine faces"
5851,17,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"And yeah, some male characters in the movie definitely got what they deserved"
5851,18,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Jadaone’s direction is quiet, patient, and uncomfortably close — exactly how it should be"
5851,19,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The movie lets us follow Sunshine’s anxiety and feel the suffocating pressure she’s under
5851,20,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,One of the film’s boldest artistic choices is the recurring appearance of a mysterious girl who seems to follow Sunshine
5851,21,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At first it’s confusing, then a bit eerie, then surprisingly emotional"
5851,22,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I won’t spoil anything, but when the film finally reveals who she represents…"
5851,23,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s symbolic, heartbreaking, and adds a deeper emotional layer to Sunshine’s arc"
5851,24,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Beyond the gymnastics, beyond the controversy, Sunshine is really about choice — and how young women often aren’t given the space to empower themselves to make their own choices"
5851,25,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The movie conveys important messages: your body is your own; silence can mask the deepest struggles; the pressure to be perfect is harmful; pursuing dreams matters, but so is ensuring one's survival; kindness fosters safety, while judgment breeds fear; and young women need safe spaces"
5851,26,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The movie doesn’t push a specific viewpoint — it drives for humanity
5851,27,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Overall, ‘’ is brave, heartbreaking, and painfully relevant"
5851,28,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It does not shout — it whispers truths that hit even harder
5851,29,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Indeed, it’s a film that mirrors reality for many young women today, and one that our society needs to see, even if the conversations it starts are uncomfortable"
5851,30,jolsf,2025-11-26 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"With that being said, I’m going to give this movie…9/10"

5858,3,contratina,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It kinda felt like it should've ended at the scene before that, when she was having that conversation with the Girl about her understanding her decision"

5858,5,contratina,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Not wanting to be a mother is enough justification, imo, and that alone makes the abortion worth it"

5859,2,alfredyy,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Because this is not about the child alone, but also the mere fact of being a mother unprepared"

5939,3,monamona_31,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"A little spoiler: I really like how they were able to let us see the experiences of women, including young girls, who are abused and forced to take on a weighty responsibility just because choosing themselves is wrong in some people’s eyes, even if they didn’t want what’s happening to them in the first place"
5939,4,monamona_31,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Some experience it as the consequences of their actions, but this movie also gives up a glimpse of those who are oppressed and have nowhere to go"

5956,3,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,unang-una: Maris Racal
5956,4,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,hindi lang nag-portray — she became Sunshine
5956,5,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"yung pagod, yung takot, yung pagka-desperate pero umaasa pa rin… ramdam mo hanggang buto"
5956,6,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"this is the face of so many young women na araw-araw lumalaban in a country that tells them what to be, what to do, and what to carry"
5956,7,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"ang ganda ng pagkakahuli sa Manila — yung sikip, yung init, yung ingay, pati yung bigat na hindi mo maipaliwanag"
5956,8,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,hindi siya romanticized; totoo lang
5956,9,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,yung Quiapo scenes
5956,10,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,sobrang accurate na parang naamoy mo na yung alinsangan at dasal at pag-asa ng mga taong dumadaan dito para humanap ng solusyon sa problema na hindi sila binibigyan ng choice
5956,11,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,and that’s the heart of the film: choice
5956,12,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,or the lack of it
5956,13,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"bilang kababaihan, ang hirap pag-usapan ng reproductive rights dito sa Pilipinas kasi every conversation is haunted by guilt, religion, and judgment"
5956,14,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"pero Sunshine manages to hold that tension — yung guilt, yung fear, yung what-if — without punishing the woman at the center of it"
5956,15,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,this isn’t just a film — it’s a mirror
5956,16,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"it asks questions na hindi madali, and refuses to hold your hand para bigyan ka ng sagot"
5956,17,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,it lets you sit with discomfort
5956,18,japschae,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,,ltbx,"it lets you ask yourself: kung hindi ikaw ang nasa sitwasyon, bakit ikaw ang magdedesisyon"
5957,1,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,What will you do if your dream is at stake because of one mistake
5957,2,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine delivers a powerful message about reproductive rights and the need for access to safe and legal abortion
5957,3,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film shows the current state of healthcare in the Philippines and how this basic necessity has become inaccessible, especially to those living below the poverty line"
5957,4,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I like how the film does not romanticize the societal issue of unwanted pregnancy
5957,5,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Instead, it highlights how stigma deeply affects women’s decision-making about their own bodies"
5957,6,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It shows how the main character struggles with an internal conflict and debates with her own conscience
5957,7,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While the film clearly presents why abortion should be legalized and recognized as part of healthcare in the Philippines, it also portrays how religion and health often clash"
5957,8,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is true that our country is still in the process of accepting that abortion is a right that should be available to all women
5957,9,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Some might argue that safe sex is the only way to avoid these situations, but we cannot ignore the fact that many women experience sexual abuse, rape, or non-consensual ejaculation during intercourse"
5957,10,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Sunshine is not just a film that explains why safe abortion should be legalized; it calls our attention to consider the issue without guilt-tripping women through religion or societal pressure
5957,11,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Women should have the freedom to decide what to do with their own bodies
5957,12,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Marriage or co-parenting should not be treated as a band-aid solution to a lifelong responsibility
5957,13,jmosatalla14,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"These solutions do not apply to everyone, especially to those who do not have the means to support a child"

5959,1,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Love how the film depicts the harsh reality of what women have to go through just to be able to decide for themselves and their BODIES
5959,2,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,This movie really goes to show how making abortion illegal makes it so much harder and dangerous for women
5959,3,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It does not sanctify the value of life since in the first place the life of the woman is endangered
5959,4,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Moreover, I love how Manila gets depicted in this light, it shows the good and bad that comes with the city"
5959,5,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It is bad for obvious reasons, the normalized chaos that is happening around it, how every night Sunshine is there, a mayhem ensues"
5959,6,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"However, I appreciate how Manila became a sanctuary place for her, where we can see how despite the chaos that happens every night, there are bits of humanity that saves her"
5959,7,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The girl dun sa hotel, yung tricycle driver, and the 13-year-old girl that she met"
5959,8,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Furthermore, I would like to commend the addition of having childrens act as her conscience or the ""what if child of hers"""
5959,9,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's a great addition because we can see how in the beginning of the film the girl was literally shouting ""murderer"" over and over again because in her perspective, her mother is harming her"
5959,10,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But in the end when she said ""gets ko na"", it became a cathartic scene as it finally hits us that it isn't about being irresponsible and selfish ---- rather it is something more than that"
5959,11,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The whole line of the girl saying to her friend Ariana that her dream is the same as Sunshine's is a great addition because I think it rings true with reality
5959,12,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"As every now and then, when a child hears about the dreams of their parents and how they had to stop it to take care of their children, especially when it comes to Mothers, the child often feels bad and just wished that thier Mom was able to live out their dream first"
5959,13,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Lastly, I love the relationship of sunshine and her older sister, the fact that never once pinagalitan o diniktahan ng ate nya sa kung paano nya haharapin yung sitwasyon niya goes to show how much she trusts and love Sunshine"
5959,14,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I also love the contrast that all throughout the film there were different sides of the story whether labelling her as a ""murderer"" o miggy telling her to do what you got to do that once you reached the end scene when her sister just told her ""kahit ano maging desisyon mo kampi lang ako sayo"" made it soo impactful"
5959,15,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Kase in the end yun lang naman ang kailangan niyang marinig, we have seen her face through that circumstance alone with nothing but her conscience, that the moment na sinabi sa kanya yun, it became a relief to her as well as allowed her to finally tell someone or at least cried it out to them na natatakot din siya kase nga bata din siyaa and hindi pa siya ready maging nanay"
5959,16,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"All in all, the film was a 10 out of 10, and I appreciate how the film wasn't all in the face about what you should believe in and what you shouldn't"
5959,17,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It just presents Sunshine's story and her decision which should be acknowledged because hindi dapat humantong sa isang sitwasyon na mas uunahin pa ng isang doktor ang kaniyang lisensya kesa sa buhay ng isang tao dahil lang ""nagpalaglag"" siya"
5959,18,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,If you really value life in its essence then we should also acknowledge the life of the person carrying the baby so bakit niyo papabayaan lang na mamatay yung batang 13-year-old
5959,19,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,so in conclusion:TANGINAA NG MGA LALAKETANGINA MO MIGGYTANGINA NUNG DOKTORATANGINA NUNG LALAKING DOKTORTANGINA NUNG TITO TANGNIA NUNG WALANG KWENTANG NANAY (
5959,20,cas_siana,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,) - di nya deserve matawag na nanay

5963,3,_jean,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,the sick religiosity that permeates every level of filipino society is SICKENING

5966,3,anjeni,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"i’d say aside from the way they tackled the topics of unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion practices with so much empathy and care, this film is very realistic bc every man in it is a villain"
5967,1,larraylarray,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I FUCKING HATE ALL THE MEN THAT SPOKE IN THIS FILM

5968,5,earaclaire,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It’s about time we normalize conversations abortion and sex education
5968,6,earaclaire,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,How many more women will go through what sunshine went through
5968,7,earaclaire,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Women should not be forced into motherhood because not all of us are made to be a mother

5970,1,gaile,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,while watching naalala ko sinasabi ni sir lau na parang dinadaanan lang ni maris ang maynila instead of interacting with it and ykw i see it  kumbaga tinarato lang ng pelikula ang manila na ‘prop’ imbes na isang karakter
5970,2,gaile,2025-11-28 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,and i’m aware that i’m looking for something that wasn’t in the film pero missed opportunity talaga na ipakita ang manila bilang isang living and breathing city

5971,10,andreakellyw,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Pero somehow medyo na oa-han ako) Also, ginawang tao si anika and aryunuh with feelings and such, and pinakita pa dun na parang gustong mabuhay ni Aryunuh, wala parang medyo contradicting lang yung part na yun, I think unnecessary na 'yung character ni Aryunuh since nagbigay life lang 'to sa fetus sa tiyan ni Rhed"
5971,11,andreakellyw,2025-11-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I like the ending, akala ko nung una hindi matutuloy dahil nga sa sistema dito sa PH"
