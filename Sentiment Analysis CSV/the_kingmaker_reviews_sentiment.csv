The Kingmaker,875,20,nicolatte_love,2019-10-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I think I would have liked a more linear storyline
The Kingmaker,875,21,nicolatte_love,2019-10-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,BUT during the conversation she did actually speak to that
The Kingmaker,875,22,nicolatte_love,2019-10-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She said when doing a documentary the audience believes what they are seeing
The Kingmaker,875,23,nicolatte_love,2019-10-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,So what do you do when you have a subject that lies
The Kingmaker,875,24,nicolatte_love,2019-10-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,So I guess that explains the storyline feeling all over the place for me because she would cut to actual facts after Imelda Marcos said something that wasn't true
The Kingmaker,875,25,nicolatte_love,2019-10-23 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,So that does make sense but it just really had a way of feeling disjointed for me

The Kingmaker,912,2,marioalvarez,2019-11-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"El que Imelda Marcos se haya prestado para este documental solo me da a pensar que tiene problemas mentales, no había manera alguna de que su persona pudiera salir bien librada de esto"
The Kingmaker,913,1,unobstrctdspace,2019-11-03 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Honestly after reading Darren's review, what more is there to add or say"
The Kingmaker,914,1,tiarasuguitan,2019-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"~AFI FEST 2019~Ferdinand, Imelda's husband (the kingmaker) was president of the Philippines from 1965-1989 and rumors had spread that the couple had used their power to assassinate politician Benigno Acquino which was a major factor in the way the public begun to view the pair"
The Kingmaker,914,2,tiarasuguitan,2019-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It was a case filled with fraud and speculation on how this couple was making their money yet a lack of solid evidence to support that whatever it was they were doing was unjust
The Kingmaker,914,3,tiarasuguitan,2019-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Today, the concern is that Imelda's son, Bongbong is on his way to ruling the Philippines which terrifies many since history is seemingly beginning to repeat itself in the sense that whoever speaks out negatively about the family suddenly disappears or is subject to assassination with a cover up"
The Kingmaker,914,4,tiarasuguitan,2019-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I just find this so insane and I feel the best thing to do is to spread the word
The Kingmaker,914,5,tiarasuguitan,2019-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It's such a controversial case and Lauren Greenfield did an excellent job at showing both perspectives
The Kingmaker,914,6,tiarasuguitan,2019-11-17 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I don't want to spoil anything so i'm just going to leave this at a strongly recommend & if anyone's watched this and would like to discuss it I'd be open to sharing some thoughts
The Kingmaker,915,1,guybyron,2019-11-28 19:03:17.126,100.0,ltbx,This is a masterclass in how to compose a story to sell you a thematic point
The Kingmaker,915,2,guybyron,2019-11-28 19:03:17.126,100.0,ltbx,So well put together that it makes you hate yourself for having laughed at the beginning
The Kingmaker,916,1,dennyl,2019-11-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,A documentary about Imelda Marcos and the general political situation in the Philippines
The Kingmaker,917,1,gralls,2019-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Hard for me to be objective about this as I’m married to a Filipino whose mother is from the same province as Imelda and is supportive of her for what appears to me to be purely tribal reasons
The Kingmaker,917,2,gralls,2019-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"With that aside as much as I can put it, I think it’s a well done doc that tells a story of interest to those unfamiliar with the Philippines but with some amount of curiosity about other cultures"
The Kingmaker,917,3,gralls,2019-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,More than once my husband said aloud “I didn’t know that” in-between laughs at Mrs
The Kingmaker,917,4,gralls,2019-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Marcos’ lack of self awareness
The Kingmaker,917,5,gralls,2019-12-01 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Those who never venture far from home and shake their heads in judgement when told of cultures different from from theirs could find it tedious, but it’s done well enough that anyone willing to give it the short 100 minutes will come away educated and entertained"
The Kingmaker,918,1,mikemak,2019-12-06 14:38:59.378,100.0,ltbx,Another great takedown of the grotesque from Lauren Greenfield
The Kingmaker,919,1,ppad,2019-12-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's like an anti-Irishman; if you kill enough people, if you live long enough, you might still look fantaastic, and be ready to regain your power"

The Kingmaker,920,2,redbacon,2019-12-07 12:32:16.436,100.0,ltbx,one of the weirdest documentary experiences I ever had
The Kingmaker,921,1,deepest99,2019-10-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I had no info about it when I entered the theatre
The Kingmaker,921,2,deepest99,2019-10-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Glad I didn't know anything because it was such a pleasant experience
The Kingmaker,921,3,deepest99,2019-10-18 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Never lost my interest and attention and the editing was superb

The Kingmaker,922,1,kennylasa,2019-12-05 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Money, I got money"
The Kingmaker,923,1,kano,2019-11-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Beneath the thick make-up and perfected smile of Imelda Marcos there seems to be something more sinister and unnerving about her appearance
The Kingmaker,923,2,kano,2019-11-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"“Perception is real and truth is not,” she says when speaking about accusations of torture and abuse of power, and it's this understanding of how to manipulate her image that has enabled her to remain outside of a prison cell for so long"
The Kingmaker,923,3,kano,2019-11-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It’s a warped form of cognitive dissonance that director Lauren Greenfield has captured in her documentary, The Kingmaker, showing the rise, fall and steady rise again of the Marcos clan in the Philippines"
The Kingmaker,923,4,kano,2019-11-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Greenfield has spent much of her career documenting the rich and deluded, which made Marcos the perfect subject"
The Kingmaker,923,5,kano,2019-11-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,She is famous for her lavish lifestyle which included the ownership of thousands of luxury brand shoes and the spending over $2 billion of state money during her time in power
The Kingmaker,923,6,kano,2019-11-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But the longer Greenfield spent with Imelda, the more obvious it became she was an unreliable narrator, locked away in a fantasy bubble refusing to face up to the pain her family has caused the Philippine people for the past half century"
The Kingmaker,923,7,kano,2019-11-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Imelda dominates the first half of the film speaking about her journey to government alongside former husband, and now deceased President, Ferdinand Marcos"
The Kingmaker,923,8,kano,2019-11-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"At the same time she is galvanising support behind her son, Bongbong, while he seeks election as Vice President"
The Kingmaker,923,9,kano,2019-11-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Greenfield managed to secure good access to the former First Lady with a one-on-one interview at home, also following her as she travels through the Manila slums (“it never used to be like this” she says with faux incredulity) handing out cash from the huge wad fixed to her side"
The Kingmaker,923,10,kano,2019-11-07 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She makes a good fist of playing the ‘woman of the people’ role, but it is little more than a sham"

The Kingmaker,925,2,road2oscars,2019-12-11 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,One of those docs that start out one way and slowly reveal another darker side
The Kingmaker,925,3,road2oscars,2019-12-11 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,And also one of those subjects so sure of themselves that they have no problem saying things that are incriminating
The Kingmaker,925,4,road2oscars,2019-12-11 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Imelda reveals a lot w/o caring
The Kingmaker,926,1,kraanj,2019-12-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Classic Greenfield
The Kingmaker,926,2,kraanj,2019-12-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Imelda Marcos is given free rein to exhibit her own folly and delusion, while interspersed archival footage and other interviews show the true story of the Marcos regime in the Philippines"
The Kingmaker,926,3,kraanj,2019-12-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While generally a troubling and depressing story, The Kingmaker has its lighter moments and dark comedy, a tonal mix that Greenfield manages beautifully"
The Kingmaker,926,4,kraanj,2019-12-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The ending hints at the possibility that Rodrigo Duterte's election as president may have been part of some larger plot to return a scion of the Marcos family to power
The Kingmaker,926,5,kraanj,2019-12-12 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"While interesting, I'm not sure this theory is fleshed out enough to merit inclusion"
The Kingmaker,927,1,ewan_m,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Lauren Greenfield has made films about people with immense wealth before, and both those and her books tend to cover that uncomfortable collision of aspirational wealth and real lived experiences, about little corners of the human psyche (or rather bigger ones in some cases) that desire the glossy fashion spread lifestyle"
The Kingmaker,927,2,ewan_m,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Imelda Marcos largely fits neatly into that, but with a far bigger and more dangerous political footprint that continues to make itself felt"
The Kingmaker,927,3,ewan_m,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ostensibly the title is about her relationship with her husband, the massively corrupt dictator of the Philippines for two decades from the mid-60s to the mid-80s (at which point he was ousted by a 'People Power' revolution via the wife of an assassinated opposition leader, Corazon Aquino), whose power she was said to manipulate for her own ends, most famously for the acquisition of art, designer items and of course shoes"
The Kingmaker,927,4,ewan_m,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But the film moves quickly on from these trappings to her real and lingering effect on Filipino politics, via her family's dynasty and their support for current dictator-wannabe Rodrigo Duterte"
The Kingmaker,927,5,ewan_m,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Stylistically it frames Marcos with the opulence of her living spaces, repeatedly showing her handing out money to her loyal supporters crowding around her car or in public appearances (often held and distributed by her staff)"
The Kingmaker,927,6,ewan_m,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She shows off art and photos of her with world leaders (at one point hilariously, but utterly unconcernedly, breaking some of these framed highlights while reaching to show off one, I think with her and Nixon)"
The Kingmaker,927,7,ewan_m,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She is also apparently blithely unaware of how her namedropping comes across, especially when she's talking about aforementioned world leaders or her art collection"
The Kingmaker,927,8,ewan_m,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"She could be a figure of fun, but gradually the film becomes more and more serious about her impact, as it layers on the Marcos's crimes and the real effects of the policies and division they have sowed within the society, paving the way for her and her family's chilling return to power"
The Kingmaker,928,1,sml_btn,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The worst kind of villains are the villains who believe that they are doing the right thing
The Kingmaker,928,2,sml_btn,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It is clear from this brutally honest documentary that she truly believed she was incapable of doing no wrong
The Kingmaker,928,3,sml_btn,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"To quote the film ""Hustlets"" from this earlier this year, ""motherhood is a mental illness"" and Imelda and the whole Marcos family are the cause of the various illnesses that run plague in my home country"
The Kingmaker,928,4,sml_btn,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Being a Filipino who lives abroad is a blessing as I am away from the violence and disasters back home, but a curse because I cannot be more than an observer"
The Kingmaker,928,5,sml_btn,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I can only do my part to try and fight the cynical thoughts in my head saying ""we have always been corrupt"" ""there is nothing we can do"", ""that is just how things are done"""

The Kingmaker,928,11,sml_btn,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I guarantee all Filipinos can take something from watching it
The Kingmaker,928,12,sml_btn,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I can only hope that the Marcos' never return to Malacañang
The Kingmaker,929,1,jorgenson,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,I'm pleased to report that this is a far superior and less odiously self-indulgent that Greenfield's Generation Wealth
The Kingmaker,929,2,jorgenson,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The Kingmaker starts from a position of curiosity and sympathy (there's something of The Fog of War in Jocelyn Pook's Philip Glassy score); Imelda Marcos as ridiculous but tragic, and maybe misunderstood"
The Kingmaker,929,3,jorgenson,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The second half of the film morphs into Act of Killing territory and the testimony of victims of the Marcos dictatorship cause the mask to slip
The Kingmaker,929,4,jorgenson,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Her attempts to propel her David Brent-like son to power likewise move from mildly pathetic to deeply troubling
The Kingmaker,929,5,jorgenson,2019-12-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Ultimately a film that speaks to a variety of worrying political trends across the world, and how perception trumps truth at all turns"
The Kingmaker,930,1,doofood,2019-12-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Really brilliantly constructed - the film sets up as a cosy, cute, harmless portrait of an eccentric celebrity in her grey years, and allows itself to remain in that framework as the body count grows higher, as Kissinger dances on the screen, as the talking heads, initially brought in to provide sappy reminiscing about Imelda's public life, begin to admit propping up dictators for the US' foreign policy interests or detail their sexual assault at the hands of the Marcos regime, as the gormless Jeb Bush-like son goes from affable mummy's boy to a brutal example of the violence of capital exerting itself, and of course as it ends with the still-unfolding nightmare of Duterte"
The Kingmaker,930,2,doofood,2019-12-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The usefulness of this for the film is that it provides an aesthetic critique of the influence of capital on society by relating everything back to Marcos, in that we see that all its awful violence, its total control over humanity, its manufacturing of poverty and suffering, don't serve some sort of greater noble cause, but instead simply exist so that an elite can buy shoes and completely bizarre confirmations of their self-image"
The Kingmaker,930,3,doofood,2019-12-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's useful sometimes to remember how utterly ugly it all is, and how power has no correlation to either intelligence or beauty, it just exerts itself in service of itself - I'd never immediately disbelieve someone who told me the rich devote their whole lives to worshipping Molloch and doing satanic rituals, because there's no need for these things to be real for the idiotic rich to exploit the world in practicing them, as Marcos' obsessive world-mother fantasy and surreal safari island show"
The Kingmaker,930,4,doofood,2019-12-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The woozy, nightmarish quality of the film's descent into horror doesn't distract from the reality, and it's a serious documentary that isn't reductive to just pointing at the absurdity of the rich"
The Kingmaker,930,5,doofood,2019-12-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Instead, it uses these contrasts to make the total dominion of capital in public life and its attendant brutality that protects and asserts the power of the dominant elite all the more vivid, and shows how apparently laughable figures like Duterte can exist as the sinew between capitalism and fascism, artificially creating a need and then fulfilling it with a solution that has no alternative (or, a failed neoliberal alternative), like Marcos literally buying the affection of the poor she helped impoverish"
The Kingmaker,930,6,doofood,2019-12-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"It's that clear critique of capital as a structure and empathy for the oppressed throughout that keeps it from being just liberal aesthetic critique, although mockery of the venal rich still has its place - don't let unfunny US talk show hosts take it away from you completely"
The Kingmaker,931,1,codywhit,2019-12-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Likable enough and entertaining but lacks the unique personal style of Greenfield's previous work
The Kingmaker,931,2,codywhit,2019-12-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a way, Marcos is the ultimate Greenfield subject and you kinda wish, it wasn't so focused with a yeoman-like investigation on present-day Filipino political corruption and human-rights crimes"
The Kingmaker,931,3,codywhit,2019-12-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Sure, Marcos is a focal-point in Filipino politics but we spend a lot of time away from Imelda, to focus on the other stuff"
The Kingmaker,932,1,brunorabello,2019-12-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Excepcional documentário que retrata de maneira implacável a corrupção política nas Filipinas, valendo-se da confiança de Imelda Marcos, que se expõe e se entrega sem demonstrar que percebe a natureza hedionda de sua figura e de sua família"
The Kingmaker,932,2,brunorabello,2019-12-14 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Fala do passado recente das Filipinas, mas poderia perfeitamente estar falando do Brasil"

The Kingmaker,933,2,nealonl,2019-12-15 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,The world can just not do anything right
The Kingmaker,934,1,1dmg,2019-12-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Greenfield tells this story with almost a degree of flippancy at the beginning as the audience is invited to laugh at Imelda Marcos and her inflated ego and mock her for her crocodile tears for the victimhood she claims
The Kingmaker,934,2,1dmg,2019-12-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Then we are shaken out of this feeling with reminders of the reality of the Marcos regime - Aquino's assassination most of all
The Kingmaker,934,3,1dmg,2019-12-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"We are then left with the image of a figurehead with an evil murderous past, left powerless and benign in her advancing years - her campaign to have her eldest son elected Vice President fails"
The Kingmaker,934,4,1dmg,2019-12-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,But Greenfield hasn't done pulling the rug from under the audience's feet with a final horrible sting in the tail that really explains the film's title
The Kingmaker,934,5,1dmg,2019-12-16 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It turns out this is no laughing matter after all - the bad guys are winning again

The Kingmaker,937,2,toonlit,2019-12-17 02:54:25.111,20.0,ltbx,"They trotted out all 5 people still alive who remember the Marcos dictatorship from the 70s/80s to trash Imelda, only to tie her family to Duterte"
The Kingmaker,937,3,toonlit,2019-12-17 02:54:25.111,20.0,ltbx,There are lots of reasons to dislike Duterte
The Kingmaker,937,4,toonlit,2019-12-17 02:54:25.111,20.0,ltbx,This just looked kinda slimy and I felt like I spent $15 to watch a political commercial
The Kingmaker,937,5,toonlit,2019-12-17 02:54:25.111,20.0,ltbx,1/2 stars out of 5

The Kingmaker,968,1,sanriel,2020-01-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I think the most important thing that The Kingmaker did was to directly connect the Marcoses to Duterte - the money, the power, the influence, the strategy, the long con - in a way that is easy for people to follow and understand"
The Kingmaker,968,2,sanriel,2020-01-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Infuriating and frustrating to watch how this same story played out twice in our lifetimes

The Kingmaker,989,1,rchrdmmrl,2020-01-29 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,never again
The Kingmaker,990,1,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,Lauren Greenfield has always had this strange fascination with showing how wealth corrupts people and how excess magnifies eccentricity
The Kingmaker,990,2,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,I went to an exhibit of hers sometime last year and found it interesting how so many of the portraits were of Imelda Marcos
The Kingmaker,990,3,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"Imagine my excitement, then, when I found out that the reason behind that was that Greenfield was making a documentary about Imelda"
The Kingmaker,990,4,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"Finally, the wider world would know about the regime that tore our country into pieces"
The Kingmaker,990,5,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"The Kingmaker is mostly successful at that, but it hardly treads new ground"
The Kingmaker,990,6,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"She is portrayed in the documentary like she is portrayed in other international cultural works that feature her: eccentric, charismatic, having led a charmed life, having possessed 3000 shoes"
The Kingmaker,990,7,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"In the end you have to wonder if it's Greenfield who's ""tricking"" Imelda into making this doc, or it's Imelda who's playing Greenfield"
The Kingmaker,990,8,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"Strangely enough, the section that made it most interesting for me is what probably made it a weaker documentary"
The Kingmaker,990,9,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"There is a 30 minute digression where we hardly see Imelda, and instead focus on the 2016 Vice Presidential elections"
The Kingmaker,990,10,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"The family sees it as a chance to regain power and redeem their name, but their delusions of grandeur and desperation are only magnified"
The Kingmaker,990,11,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"And while Bong Bong Marcos lost the elections, it is apparent that their power only grows stronger with the allegiance of Rodrigo Duterte"
The Kingmaker,990,12,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"It feels less cohesive as a documentary as a result, but at least we're seeing something new"
The Kingmaker,990,13,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,So is it good
The Kingmaker,990,14,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,I feel it is
The Kingmaker,990,15,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,Is it enough
The Kingmaker,990,17,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"While there was a heartbreaking series of interviews with Martial Law victims, it is only implied that Imelda Marcos has something to do with this"
The Kingmaker,990,18,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,Why was there no coverage of the convictions in international courts
The Kingmaker,990,19,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,Why was there no definite statement about the guilt of this woman
The Kingmaker,990,20,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,The Kingmaker is just another piece of cinema that perpetuates Imelda Marcos's legend
The Kingmaker,990,21,quark,2020-02-02 16:27:00.152,100.0,ltbx,"What I want to see is an outright condemnation of this woman, because she deserves nothing less"

The Kingmaker,994,3,hk258,2020-02-08 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"But in the early 1990s her family returned to the Philippines and in the 2010s began it's return to the frontline of politics, seeking office for her son Bongbong"
The Kingmaker,994,4,hk258,2020-02-08 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"This film, with a tone of mounting horror, relates their appallingly successful efforts to return to power, the facts as frequently jaw-dropping as they are terrifying"
The Kingmaker,994,5,hk258,2020-02-08 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,For 90 minutes we watch this despicable cartoon villain throw herself a pity party while others suffer the consequences of her vomit-inducing luxury
The Kingmaker,994,6,hk258,2020-02-08 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The ripest metaphor at the films centre is the safari park she and her husband built, evicting hundreds of families from their island home to make way for animals poached from Africa"
The Kingmaker,994,7,hk258,2020-02-08 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The film doesn't quite sell this as a metaphor for the political inbreeding, but it remains an incisive example of the cruelty and selfishness these vile humans spread"

The Kingmaker,1059,7,v9733xa,2020-03-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Greenfield's style in this film is to allow Marcos to tell her own history and her own story at first

The Kingmaker,1059,10,v9733xa,2020-03-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Famously catching Ferdinand cheating on her with tape recorder under the bed, which she used as blackmail to get what she wanted later, she grew in prestige and influence into the 80s as the family lived like extravagant royalty amidst a nation suffering in abject poverty"
The Kingmaker,1059,11,v9733xa,2020-03-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,It was the 1986 People Power revolution (and election of Corazon Aquino) which forced them from office and exiled the family from ever ruling The Philippines again
The Kingmaker,1059,12,v9733xa,2020-03-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Of course, the Marcos regime ruled with an iron fist in a military dictatorship, and gradually through The Kingmaker the stories of others -- those affected by the imposition of martial law, the families evicted from their homes to the Marcos family could build and renovate at will, the torture victims and political prisoners of innumerable amounts -- come to the fore, and the real truth is revealed about Imelda"
The Kingmaker,1059,13,v9733xa,2020-03-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"That is, Greenfield allows her to be an unreliable narrator, and brings in members of the Aquino family and other opponents to counter her fabrications and exaggerations, like a form of fact checking"

The Kingmaker,1059,18,v9733xa,2020-03-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"In a bizarre state of denial about the years of horror her family brought to The Philippines, Imelda plays the victim and twists the facts to beg for sympathy; unfortunately it has worked in some ways, stealing billions from the country while many Filipinos suffered"
The Kingmaker,1059,19,v9733xa,2020-03-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"Greenfield has explored themes of wealth, privilege, and bewildering ignorance of power and influence before, and The Kingmaker does that effectively"
The Kingmaker,1059,20,v9733xa,2020-03-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"The doc plays with a linear timeline a little, and the shifting stories can make it difficult to follow if you don't already have knowledge of the era"
The Kingmaker,1059,21,v9733xa,2020-03-13 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,"I imagine anyone not from the Philippines and especially anyone under 30 might need more background information about this history to fully grasp the evil of the Marcos regime and impact for decades more, as well as how it's profoundly affected the current Duterte era"

The Kingmaker,1331,6,romanrangel,2020-05-20 00:00:00.000,100.0,ltbx,Muy recomendable
The Kingmaker,1332,1,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"Throughout the film there were various commentaries from people and the fact that they weren't positioned in the same background with the exact same static angle was very interesting- each person that gave a commentary gave it in the comfort of either their own home or office with a full frontal view, giving off a feeling of rawness and vulnerability as they spoke, luring the audience to full believe in what they say"
The Kingmaker,1332,2,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"In terms of audio, there was one mellow melancholy tune that would play whenever a devastating/unfortunate event was brought up, which would of course elevate the feeling of loss and damage- these two feelings are important because that's the main goal of the documentary: for the people to feel the loss and damage that has happened to the Philippines and the people because of the abuse of power by the Marcos family"
The Kingmaker,1332,3,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"Although the film revolved around Imelda, I deeply appreciated how it did not feel biased at all"
The Kingmaker,1332,4,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"The people behind the film didn't just interview and capture people in awe of Imelda, but also brought in people who found the family and their doings unjust"
The Kingmaker,1332,5,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"You would expect this documentary to be very one-sided, but instead you get two sides battling each other- although it's subtle in the documentary, it's something that is actually happening in real life in the Philippines even up to today"
The Kingmaker,1332,6,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,It was clear that Imelda was trying to paint this picture-perfect image of herself to the audience
The Kingmaker,1332,7,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"She repeatedly states that she lost her mother and that she believes she is the mother of the Philippines and that she ""birthed"" all these great and beautiful things, my only question is: where"
The Kingmaker,1332,8,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,Throughout the film I could feel nothing but indecencies coming out of her mouth
The Kingmaker,1332,9,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"I firmly believe in ""actions speak louder than words"" and there's one scene in the whole documentary that really stood out to me- the scene where Imelda picks up the frame and the other frames fall on the floor"
The Kingmaker,1332,10,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"She acts as if nothing happened, she does not even acknowledge, and she goes on and talks about the picture frame she's holding as a worker of her shyly cleans up the broken pieces of glass on the floor"
The Kingmaker,1332,11,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,This scene is really interesting as she says all these good things about herself and all yet a small act such as recognizing the frames falling and seeing the worker clean up after her she cannot acknowledge and help
The Kingmaker,1332,12,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"This is very reminiscent of her as a first lady and the Marcos Family- they see what they want and they get it without hesitation, complete unaware of the mess they left behind for the Filipinos to clean up"
The Kingmaker,1332,13,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"In addition, throughout the film she mentions that throughout her reign as first lady, she was friends with powerful people all across the globe, further proving how unaware she is of her and herhusband’s doings"
The Kingmaker,1332,14,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,She states that she is disgusted with how the government and Philippines is now however she is completely delusional as she doesn’t realize that her and her family has contributed to how the Philippines is no longer “paradise”
The Kingmaker,1332,15,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"Lastly, it’s interesting how this film was made by someone that is not a Filipino"
The Kingmaker,1332,16,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"I’m not sure why someone who has no close ties to the Philippines would make a documentary about something so notorious, however, perhaps the fact that it’s so notorious is probably the reason why it was made by the director in the first place"
The Kingmaker,1332,17,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,I wondered why no one in the Philippines has made something like this- is it because we are scared of the consequences
The Kingmaker,1332,18,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,Is it because it would be full of bias
The Kingmaker,1332,19,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"Whatever the reason is, I think that the fact this film was made by someone looking at the outside in really gives us a non-biased and equal perspective, as well as a clear division on fact and truth"
The Kingmaker,1332,20,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"My gripe with this documentary is how it felt that it shifted to Duterte and that it meandered from Imelda and the main topic on hand, however, I can't really rule this out as the documentary was stating facts and the fact about the Marcos' funding Duterte was vital for people to know"
The Kingmaker,1332,21,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,This film was a beautiful yet disturbing layout of Philippine History
The Kingmaker,1332,22,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,Everything was presented in a way that would benefit the feeling and mood of the film
The Kingmaker,1332,23,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,It’s definitely not for people who are very sensitive to the Marcos’ as this film obviously dives deep into them and Imelda’s delusions
The Kingmaker,1332,24,queenellouise,2020-05-21 08:05:53.737,100.0,ltbx,"Imelda may have thought that this film would bring her and her family justice, however personally, it just justified why the Philippines and its people are having hardships today"
