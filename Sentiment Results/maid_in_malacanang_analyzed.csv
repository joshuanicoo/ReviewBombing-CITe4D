Yet, the movie didn't give the experience of a family in their last 72 hours

The progression of events is anti-climactic

The flow of conversation is hollow

The choice of words contribute to the hollowness

The storytelling is disorderly

Continuously changes format narratives

I think if they stuck to a ""documentary"" type of movie it would've fit well

They didn't know what to tell and how to tell it, so it became an amalgamation of every movie format possible

They just combined all their scenes by inserting ""chapters"" and ""long texts"" in between that literally summarizes what they want to tell-which defeats the purpose of a movie

Cristine Reyes carried the movie, Ella Cruz has solid crying acts

Cesar Montano, playing the infamous dictator, has no semblance of the supposed 'strongman' traits of the one he's playing Diego Loyzaga literally has no emotion

Others didn't do anything Looking at you Kiko Estrada

Misrepresentation of nuns with Giselle Sanchez playing mahjong already crosses this film out as a supposed ""addition"" to history, since said nuns are cloistered

Usage of words that were not present those days, but are yet frequently heard in the movie

Usage of musical scores are way off, since most of the scores play in scenes that are unremarkable

Then by the end, there's a weird and sudden tribute to characters that were not given its decent exposure during the actual movie runtime",negative,0.8735878467559814,0.8735878467559814,4.891492790193297e-05,0.12636315822601318,negative,10.0
