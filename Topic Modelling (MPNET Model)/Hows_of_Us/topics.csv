Hows of Us,"KathNiel's G.O.A.T movie!: I don't usually go watch local films, but KathNiel just have that thing that makes me not want to miss it every single time (I always watch on it's first day too.) lol

So here's my non-biased review. I will try to be as objective as possible. For someone who appreciate movies a whole lot, it is such a hard thing to please me and my siblings when it comes to movies. I was a bit hesitant before watching the movie, rom-com-drama movies are not really my type.

This movie, went beyond my expectations. The cinematography wasn't as great compared to their Crazy Beautiful You movie, but nonetheless, it really went beyond expectations. I never expected it to be as creative and dynamic because of the simple setting and story line, but it was unbelievably quite on par with CBY. Kudos to the team for that!

Story wise, it was that kind of movie which is really simple and not as complicated as others but it really brought out the feels. I specifically loved the beginning part the most! It's not common for Filipino movies to start that way but it did! Not gonna spoil the scenes though. Gonna leave it all to you to find out how beautifully catching it was. Another thing to note, was the transition to each and every scene, the voice overs and the story flow. It's meticulously put together that you'll be hooked the whole time you're watching the movie. The dynamics was there too, will sound cliche but it was a roller coaster of feelings. When you think you're through all the heavy scenes, and can feel the whole cinema audience sharing that light feeling, they'll hit you with the feels again.

To the couple, Kathryn and Daniel, they were really the one who brought the movie to life. Unlike, Barcelona: A Love Untold, we saw how great of a supporting actor Joshua is and for me, he was one of the actors who brought the movie to life. In here, it was all them. Not discrediting other actors, they all did a good job. Darren is a revelation, the kid is a multi-talented person. We can't really say anything about Miss Jean Garcia cause she really is a legend. Other cast's acting were quite bland but it was still a good one. Joross and another actor's cameo was also on point. For those who never had a relationship like me, Juan Miguel Severo and Ria Atayde was the most relatable one. They really showed what friends do, it was real, really genuine. Back to KathNiel, I really feel like this is their best movie yet. Kathryn was on her zone, she really owned this one. She literally shone her, she really showed her vulnerability and it's super far from when she was starting and her teen movies. We really saw Kathryn, not Kathryn with Daniel but Kathryn. Kathryn herself. Daniel is a natural, we all know that. I can't even explain how great of an actor he is, whenever he accepts a character, you won't see a trace of the Daniel Padilla in real life but he really gets into the character and owns it. He was the best Primo just as Kathryn was the best George. They really owned this one.

Direk Cathy showed us again why she is a blockbuster director. She is a legend. Maybe not indie wise, cause that's not her forte. But we can always trust Direk Cathy to bring out all the emotions, may it be tears of both joy and pain, all the laughs and all the frustrations.

Rated it 8 because there will always be room for improvement for all the actors and the movie itself, but overall it is a really great one. A must-watch!",2018-08-30,-1
Hows of Us,"TOUCHING AND UNIQUE: As a non-fan of the usual romantic Filipino films, especially those starring love teams, ""The Hows of Us"" is a unique film thanks to the set up. It's also nice to see a nice twist to the what's essentially the same formula.",2021-10-10,7
Hows of Us,"7/10 rating will do: I watched this movie out of curiousity... 'cos my friends keep on telling me its a nice movie... well, not bad, the story is good. What I only don't like is the ""Live in"" concept.. it tells youth nowadays to it's okay to live together without marriage for if you two don't click living together..let go and leave each other.. but if you click that's it be with each other... Realization nowadays, Filipino youth seems forget the culture, the values... anyway, congrats to kath and daniel, great improvement in their acting...it won't surprise me if you two brag the Best / Promising Actress and Actor of the year..",2018-09-02,8
Hows of Us,direk cathy is superb in showing us the ups and downs of a long term relationship.: This movie is the 'one more chance' of this generation. very relatable. i agree that there's nothing new in the storyline simply because couples these days still struggle with the same issues like all other couples from before.,2018-09-02,9

Hows of Us,"8/10: For a Filipino Film I'll give it a score of 9/10 It is one of the best RomComs in the Philippines ever!

But if you stack it against Hollywood movies. a score of 7/10 would suffice.

Acting Lead Actors: 10/10, they portrayed it masterfully. Supporting Cast: 6/10, could have casted a better ""Yohan"", they gave him a lot of screentime and his portrayal is lacking. The cousin and friends of Primo needs more workshops. George's friends were the bright spots.

Story/Dialogue The plot is simple and direct to the point. It somewhat dragged when they went to Amsterdam. Dialogue was good 7/10

Direction/Cinematography CGM is one of the best when it comes to RomComs here in the Philippines. 9/10

As of Sept 7 it has 404M php gross, and its only been up for 10 days.

PS: To the other reviewees, please be fair, don't bring your Crab mentality here.",2018-09-09,8

Hows of Us,"Not supposed to be 1 STAR, but........: Ok ladies and gentlemen, I might get hate comments on this but this is my review on this movie.

First, the only reason I had the urge to create an account on IMDB is because of the overrated reviews this movie has gotten. On top of that, this film became the BOX OFFICE FILM of the Philippines of all time! (So, arousing my curiosity, I took the time to watch).

The material of this film was alright. Nothing extra special to be honest. The usual romcom pinoy film. In my opinion (no hate to Kathniel), it could've been better if someone better portrayed their characters.

Seriously, who would live in the same house and put a division using a tape? Like, cmon, seriously?

There were okay moments, but seriously Filipinos who went gaga on this movie need to re-evaluate yourselves. I'm not even hard to please.

I would rate this film a 4/10 or 5. I gave it 1 STAR to lower down its overrated reviews from other people like giving it 10?? and their best movie of all time? Jeez.",2019-05-19,8
Hows of Us,Best movie ever!!!: 10 is not enough to rate this movie it should be ughh 101. This is the best movie of 2018 literally! Will give u a lot of realizations. This movie didn't GRADED A for no reason! So watch the talk of the town movie and don't forget to bring tissue. KathNiel and THOU team ay maghahakot ng awards!,2018-09-02,-1
Hows of Us,"Good movie but not too commercialized: Neither I am a Kathniel fan nor hater, this is just an honest review (for me).

Before I watched the movie, I made sure that I've had checked social media on everyone's take on this film. Honestly, I was convinced to watch it. As I enter the movie house, my eyes were on point to each scene. During the first part, I totally enjoyed it. Everything was so realistic and on-point. But as the movie runs, it made me bored already. The scenes were all over already. I must say, Can't help falling in love was their ""most matured film.""

Did I leave the movie house feeling heavy-hearted? No Did I leave the movie house happy? Yes, but just to give my thoughts about it. Will I watch it again? Maybe if I want to see what part I may have missed. Was it worth the money? 280 pesos is not bad but I left the movie house thinking I should have watched other local movies that will really make my feelings satisfied.

Let's just be honest here, do you think this was their best movie so far? I don't think so. To be honest, I think I was just convinced by lots of fans commenting that this was their movie ever.

Lesson Learned: Do not believe in what you see or hear.",2018-09-29,-1
Hows of Us,Best Movie of Kathniel: A story everyone can relate to. Kathryn was at her best in this movie and she deserves all the praises she is receiving from those who watched the movie. Daniel a natural charmer and his comedic timing was impeccable. Kudos to director CGM for bringing out the best in them!,2018-08-30,2

Hows of Us,"10/10!: Cathy garcia molina and kathniel definitely outdid themselves with this movie! superb acting, cinematography, direction, and lines. A MUST WATCH!",2018-08-30,2
Hows of Us,"Don't believe the 10/10 reviews here: First half of the movie was good, promising... can't say the same for the rest.

I felt like her struggle during the relationship wasn't acknowledged enough when he came back. Then the scene where we're told of what his life was after he left her felt lacking. Sure, he experienced real life, but that doesn't change how much of an a-hole he was to her. I still thought that's not enough for a reconcilliation at this point. But, of course, you see her starting to give into him. Pathetic.

Then there's the letter. Such a corny literal piece of garbage. People who fall for that, are the same people who fall for heart emojis.",2024-01-13,4

Hows of Us,"Good production, Disappointing story: The cinematography is good and can be improved. Actors are not that bad. However, the story does not make it worth-watching. The male lead character doesn't seem to have changed that much when he returned. If I were the female lead, I would never choose such man. The good reviews maybe a bit biased because of the large fandom of KathNiel.",2021-01-22,2
Hows of Us,"REAL, HONEST REVIEW FOR #TheHowsOfUs. ""IN THEIR MOST FINEST PERFORMANCE/MOVIE OF ALL"": Watched it exactly on it's showing date in cinemas (August 29, 2018) and I can say that the audience really missed KathNiel on big screen/cinemas! Sold-out screenings, long lines, etc.

Review for the movie: This is going to be the last tandem movie of KathNiel together with Filipino's Blockbuster Director, Cathy Garcia-Molina. And they really did impress us viewers with their last movie together! The movie is a little bit cliche as you can say but atleast, it has something new to offer for the viewers. Direk Cathy indeed put up her best for the movie turned out to be beautifully scripted, it is by far expectation acting coming from all of the cast especially Kathryn Bernardo (this is her most amazing character/acting as she portrays ""George""). KathNiel didn't failed us on each of their movie. Perhaps, they both keep on leveling up in their craft of acting or as a love team or maybe a partners in real life (hehe).

THE MOST TALKED-ABOUT AND MUST WATCH MOVIE OF 2018. YOU SHOULD NOT MISS IT! ;)",2018-08-31,-1
Hows of Us,"Half baked poetry!: Exactly this is half baked. The first half is poetic, the agony of the heroine is well-portrayed.

It would have been better if they didn't end up together like the dude was such a red flag then they would tryna change him which is the whole point of the story and make them come back together, lol chiche. They really make everything a happy ending like I haven't seen a movie of kathniel that has a sad ending at least this one would be better if they didn't end up together again at the end. I'm only rating it a 3 because of their acting, they deserve that.",2023-02-24,2

Hows of Us,"Definitely a must watch film!: The story and concept is simple which makes this film more interesting and remarkable in a way. How? Then watch it!

Kidding aside, the actors were great, ang galing ni Kathryn and Daniel! My God, best actress ang acting ni Kathryn dito and yung ibang cast nagbeblend in sa kanila. I love Miko! (Beki friend of Kath in the film). The scenes and lines were very relatable. Believe it or not, yung katabi kong guy na may kasamang gf umiyak nung pa-end na yung movie.

The 'hugot' of this film is not just the typical na hugot pagibig. It's a hugot about life, love, your family and friends.

If given a chance at may magaya, for sure panuodin ko ulit! Sobrang worth it sa ticket prize na 295 (ang mahal bes). I hope a lot of people will be able to watch this film. Pwede sa barkada, sa magjowa, sa buong pamilya (makakarelate si inay at itay). Go na bes, watch na. You won't regret it! Promise!",2018-09-01,11
Hows of Us,"KATHNIEL'S ""THE HOWS OF US"" , A BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE INDEED!: #TheHowsOfUs The 9th Movie-team up of KathNiel and their second movie with the blockbuster director, Cathy Garcia-Molina (after She's Dating The Gangster) and may I just say that they keep on leveling up with their acting skills as a love team or as individual actor/s.

*Beautifully scripted *Cinematography, Wise! *Simple plot and story but will definitely hit you hard and after it will give you a lot of realizations about relationship/s. *At syempre, TATAK CATHY GARCIA-MOLINA yan eh!

#THOU is their best movie of all! (though lahat naman ng movie nila is maganda). All of the cast has brought such a great performance but Kathryn Bernardo? She really nailed it! She brings a Award-Winning worthy acting as she portrays ""George."" Also, what I like about the movie is that it is very relatable in all aspects (relationship, family, self)

! If in year 2000, we have Popoy and Basha. In year 2018, we have Primo and George. You should not miss such great movie like The Hows Of Us! THE BEST TAGALOG MOVIE OF 2018 so far.",2018-08-31,2

Hows of Us,"A reflection of the line, How do we save us: The question ""how do we save us?"" does not only pertain to failing relationships. It is also a question you would ask yourself when you are at a crossroad. If you are at a point in life where you needed to choose between pursuing your passion or settling for practicality. It is a question of ""how do I save myself?"" from my own failed expectations when things don't work out to how I planned it. How do I save myself from the self pity? the self hate?

No, this is not an epic star-crossed lovers nor a cute campus crush story. A simple story of a couple facing the ups and downs of a long-term relationship. Facing the challenges caused by their own passion and dreams.

There are heavy scenes that you'll feel the weight and tension(fav:first 25 minutes) while there are also light ones that will bring a smile on your face.(the house division sequence)

The characters are likable with strong characterization...thanks to the cast's performance and the direction. The dialogue never felt out of place.

Hows of Us,"There used to be a time when the powers-at-be were trying to convince people that Daniel Padilla was cool, casting him as the broody teenage bad-boy that had to be won over by the steely determination of his good-girl paramour Kathryn Bernardo. But he's not cool, at least in that way. He's got a big goofy smile, a friendly presence, and an earnestness that gives his characters surprising vulnerability. His growth as an actor largely involves him being comfortable up on screen, being some version of himself that's closer to who he really is.And this leads to the best bits of this movie, which almost seem to happen in a vacuum of narrative. It doesn't matter what came before or what might happen after. In the moment, it just looks like these two kids are enjoying themselves. Kathryn Bernardo hasn't quite kept up with Padilla's development, her performances getting a little stiffer as she gets older, but their clear affection for one another smooths out a lot of these scenes.But these moments don't actually exist in a vacuum. There's a movie around it, and like so many local big romcoms, there are just too many things going on. All the classic formula markers are there, too: some sort of medical problem, some parental issues and a whole bunch of characters that exist purely to tell the leads what they're supposed to be feeling. The movie stretches into two hours with the added weight of these rote elements, and by the time they fly off to some foreign land, it kind of feels like an entirely different movie. It shifts focus completely, and starts filling in even more backstory through yet another character that just says everything outright.The story they end up telling is actually pretty simple, but there are just so many other things that crowd out the much more affecting core of this story: two people still clearly in love with each other, just trying to overcome the hurt that also still exists between them. In bits, in moments, the two kind of make that work. But the movie itself feels so caught up in the norms of their genre to just let the leads take the lead.",2018-08-29,-1
Hows of Us,"HEARTFELT. This film presents a distinct, powerfully affecting kind of love story to prove that the standard CGM formula has still some unique perspectives to spin and explore. Here’s a mind dump (with little spoilers) rendered in the same fashion as the film’s break-build narrative, starting off with negatives (baka awayin ako ng fans, lol), wrapping up with positives. 1. The opening voiceovers are certainly moving but seem lengthier than necessary. I hate that I feel like I’m being spoon-fed.2. Daniel’s character is rather poorly developed. And the choice to reveal his backstory through another character’s verbose lines is quite a disappointment. 3. I am totally confused about (what I think is) the turning point where Primo has to leave because that’s obviously what he is asked to, then is instantly being chased by George afterwards. There is no question about Kathryn’s acting, but seriously I’m like, “Girl, why are you crying? Pinaalis mo ‘di ba?” And when he returns, she says something like “That’s not what I actually meant because I was just tired, and that I wanted you to fight for us that night.” Ang labo. 4. The prepossessing bike scene gets less delightful when Primo starts throwing gibberish pick-up lines. Ganda na sana eh. Rickety in part but there’s so much that makes it worthy as a whole:5. Editing does not look as though it’s rushed. ‘Buti naman. 6. A dialogue-heavy scene backdropped by Amsterdam’s glaring flower fields and lovely sunset is my favorite. How would you feel if you’re in a beautiful place, talking to someone you love about how your lives got better after you painfully parted ways? Tearful acceptance, ganun. Ako, hindi ko alam. Unfathomable. 7. Second favorite is the harana/apology scene. Pain and kilig stirred together. 8. It may not be picture-perfect, but it’s a warehouse of authentic messages, inspirational ideologies, and lessons in love, which I gladly take away:- Relationships take great, great effort to maintain. It’s easy to give love and be happy when things are going well. But what happens when life suddenly feels as though it’s caving in with a spirit-crushing weight? Ang tanong eh kung kaya mo pa. Pero kung siya ayaw na, tama na. Ginawa ko na ‘yan. Okay naman ako. Pero ako lang ‘yun. - I give a nod everytime Primo says “Sayang iniwan kita, nagkahiwalay tayo,” and George will answer “but we became better persons.” Eh kasi tama naman. We don’t grow when things are easy, comfortable, and effortless. We grow when we face something beyond what we’re capable of handling. Kahit magkahiwalay pa kayo. Again, ako lang ‘to. - For the most beautiful part: Just because we think our heart is broken doesn’t mean it’s incapable to love again. (Sa’kin talaga galing to? Hahaha!) It’s those times when we have to step aside, heal in whatever foolish way we can, and remind ourselves of what keeps us going. It’s when we think na wala nang dahilan magmahal ulit kasi masasaktan ka lang ulit, that instead of curling up and hiding from the world, we gather our scattered bits of resolve to keep moving forward, whether with someone from the past, with someone new, or with yourself alone. Friend, life is worth every single moment. Be open to lessons from your hardships and misfortunes — they will build within you an unshakable passion, acceptance, understanding, and LOVE. THOU redefines my idea of living life, makes me want to fall in love again.",2018-08-31,-1

Just not a fan of the cast - and it's not because I'm not a fan of the couple. Even the supporting cast fell short. Tried my best to not be biased about it, but I found myself cringing a few times because of the sucky acting. Side note: Actors act, singers sing. That's how the world should work.

To make us feel or just even tell us that everything will be okay. Primo’s character is also us in some moments of this so called life that we are in. We pursue our passion and only think of ourselves (I think, this is the majority of the millenials). But sometimes, unfortunately there will come a time that we’ll be in a crossroad and we only have to choose one path. Yourself or not yourself. They say, you are lucky if you found what you are passionate about and make a career out of it. But sometimes our stars doesn’t align in what we know we want to pursue and what we need or know to do. I consider myself lucky in my career. Not YET financially but I love what I’m doing and where I am at. My takeaway in the story is that if you love someone, fight for this person. No matter what.

The film has three languages (I think) English, Spanish, and Tagalog (at least I'm guessing so) and cycles through them interspersedly which is fascinating to me because I can't even get beyond the one I currently speak. Both actors look a bit too young to make the time span of the movie completely believable -- they're either together seven years and then separated two or those two years are included in the seven, either way there's supposed to be at least seven years between when they first meet and when the film starts but they don't really look it.

Hows of Us,"I have always been checking for Daniel Padilla because I do think he has an impressive talent and very natural acting and charisma. I liked Kathryn in her previous shows and movies when she was younger but while she grew up, some of her acting appeared to be too mannered for me. In this movie however, Director Cathy Garcia-Molina flipped the script and made Kathryn shine more out of the duo. Don't get me wrong, Daniel is still a great screen presence but he was encumbered by what is, in my opinion, a deeply unlikable character while Kathryn got to play a long suffering and determined young lady and really got her chance to shine here. There are lots of parts of this movie that lost my rapt - the out of place Amsterdam part and newcomer Darren Espanto's stilted acting, to name a few. But Kathryn and Daniel's special brand of chemistry still drives this movie home.",2018-10-17,2

Georgina (Bernardo) ingin pasangannya, Primo (Padilla) lebih terlihat berjuang, padahal mereka punya 'pertempuran' dan cara berjuang yang berbeda dari sejak pertama mereka bertemu.Relate banget filmnya.. di saat pasangan harus saling mendukung, dari yang awalnya percaya dengan passion Primo, dan menerima segala kekurangannya dan bersabar.

Ia berharap Primo bertahan mendengarkan keluhannya, bersabar menghadapi amarahnya dan lebih berjuang membantu lelahnya.

Keduanya berpisah dan baru bertemu kembali setelah 2 tahun.Primo kembali lagi, berusaha memperbaiki, tapi Georgina menganggapnya sudah terlambat.

The story is plain simple and it was going okay as it goes along, but I think the father/Amsterdam thing was unnecessary, however, I'm not hating the not-tulips-but-other-flowers-on-the-field scene when they both finally realized they've become better people with their separation.It was also nice to see the evolution of this love team's acting; they just get better and better as time goes by, giving more opportunities for them to go with mature roles — including this one.

Hows of Us,"I don't know if I have nearly as many questions about how this couple happened than I do about the one in ""She's Dating a Gangster"". This onscreen romance between Kathryn Benardo and Daniel Padilla can only be healthier than their last one under Cathy Garcia-Molina, but we're still talking about an aspiring musician and a medical student moving in together after she inherits her great aunt's hows-I mean house. I don't know how mature the film itself is with that wordplay in the title, so of course it's not too long before the med student gets tired of supporting the bum. Years later, ""he just happens"" to return declaring that he is a ""changed man"", but at least sticks around when he discovers that his ex-girlfriend blew up her medical career to whine about breaking up with her boyfriend. As if that's not unhealthy enough, after they ruined their first relationship with too much pressure, they have to start a new one by selling the house and finding the female lead's estranged father before her brother goes blind from diabetes. Along the way, they figuratively return to the debate club where they literally met to assess the ""hows"" that will save these lovers, even though the only one that counts is that they're played by Kathryn Benardo and Daniel Padilla. Filipino cinema's hottest power couple are sure to draw a crowd to what bickering they can manage, but the film still has to pander to them to oblivion.The masses might be a bit thrown off by the film's wildly convoluted nonlinear storytelling, and even then, it's mostly hard to keep up with the rapid-fire progression of the characters' arc settling into the house and adapting to their draggier reunion some years later. Something as overdramatic as a flashback structure mostly just shows how contrived this thing is, as a simplistic melodrama that forces conflict in the flashback storyline to spice up an initially ""happy"" home and facilitate its downfall, and blows the reunion arc on either randomly searching for an estranged father or a grown-ass doctor screaming about the ""tragedy"" of getting dumped. This film deals with some pretty sophisticated themes on how individuals are complexly shaped by their relationship, and although fairly likable character undergo a lot of change, it's all undone by those ""I can't live with you"" confrontations and ""I can't live without you"" declarations. It's never a particularly well-written romp, of course, the comedy being almost singularly embarrassingly juvenile screwball banter with friends or cutesy shenanigans with the couple, whose romantic interplays are devalued by sexual tension and saccharine dramatic progression. For the film to talk about moving into an adult relationship, this is in no way an adult movie, with Cathy Garcia-Molina being just one of many writers on a flimsy committee, and giving up on carrying this above that as directress. As full-hearted as her frantic overstylization, over-scoring, overpacing and overall overhandedness are, it's yet more grating pandering that wears down a superficial romantic dramedy. It's just a fluff piece, and it's sure to please the crowd, sometimes with actually tasteful elements.The wooded suburban house is a key character, and a comely one at that, with a beauty and humility beaming with some of the truest romance in the atmosphere of a film all about the hassle of a couple settling down. This sentimental tone is carried over by Jessie Lasaten's sweetly bright score and Noel Teehankee's dreamily polished cinematography, but without the maturity naturally inherent in that home. Cathy Garcia-Molina's direction just keeps going too far with the romantic disposition, but no matter how cloying this gets, there's always such honesty in such fiery emotion. As melodramatic as the film gets, there are times when Garcia-Molina is simply owning up to that with her dreamy sentiments, trusting that the cheese will be grounded by the admittedly fairly solid character factor. It's a romantic drama about growing up that is in no way grow-up, until there comes a point in both the flashback and present-day segments when the characters really start to break through, losing a grip of their prospects under the pressure of making a home, then reuniting some time later to further contemplate how they function as a unit. Juxtaposing these two processes deepen fairly sharp themes on understanding the differences between healthy dependency and toxic codependency; sacrificing your own prospects and supporting someone else's; and succumbing to the burden of a serious relationship and giving it time to breathe. I can tell you one thing: it's getting hard to see Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla functioning without each other, their radiant chemistry continuing to flourish alongside their bubbly charms and often surprisingly piercing emotional forces, as they try to hold together a film that is having a harder time managing fluff with true maturity.The nonlinear narrative is just part of the incessant contrivances that devalue a would-be mature love story, but not like the grating humor, histrionics and overstylization that render this strict pandering, with enough charm in its craft and punch-up, if not enough depth in its character developments and the leads' chemistry, to save Cathy Garcia-Molina's ""The Hows of Us"" a likably farcical romantic drama that warms your heart in some places and leave it cold in others.2.5/5 - Adequate",2019-06-27,7

Hows of Us,"Bingung sebenarnya mau nulis review film ini gimana. Bukan karena filmnya jelek, tapi karena filmnya RELATABLE SEKALI, KAKAK. Aku bingung karena aku pasti kecurcol soal mantan. Aku gatel pengen cerita soal kehidupan percintaanku, sesuatu yang rasanya bisa menjijikkan buat dibaca orang lain. Bisa bikin orang lain memaki, “MANA BAHASAN SOAL FILMNYA, ANJIIIIIIR. MALAH CURHAT SI BANGKEEEEEE.” But… fuck it. Aku tulis aja deh. Aku nggak tau mau nulis apa juga. Selain film ini bagus kecuali adegan pas setting-nya berpindah di Amsterdam di mana pas bagian itu terasa membosankan. Bagi yang males dan mual kalau baca curhatan, bisa berhenti sampai di sini.-------------------------BATAS SUCI-----------------------------Tuh, aku bikinin batas sucinya ehehe.Aku ngerasa kenapa nonton ini pas banget dengan momen si mantan ngajak balikan. FYI, aku dan si mantan putus beberapa waktu lalu. Aku diputusin, lebih tepatnya. Ehehe.Film ini seolah bikin aku optimis mau dan bisa balikan sama mantan. Karena filmnya tentang pasangan yang putus terus balikan lagi. Tentang cowoknya yang buat salah terus cowoknya minta maaf, menyadari kalau ternyata dia yang salah dan berusaha berubah. The Hows of Us adalah mimpi basah bagi orang-orang kayak aku. Yang dalam lubuk hatinya pengen balikan tapi takut bakal hancur lagi. Yang ngerasa bingung kalau pake otak, jadinya rasional. Kalau pake hati, bisa senang tapi irasional. Kalau ngikutin otak, wajar banget rasanya kalau nggak balikan. Memang harusnya nggak balikan. Kalau ngikutin hati, rasanya pengen balikaaaaan aja. Memaafkan dengan mudah apa yang telah dilakukan mantan.Aku nggak bilang kalau sepenuhnya mantan yang salah. Aku juga salah. Aku nggak bisa memenuhi ekspektasinya. Aku nggak sesempurna yang dia mau. Aku udah berusaha berubah jadi apa yang dia mau, tapi aku nggak bisa. Rintangan yang dihadapi menuju ke 'arah sana' juga bukan dianggap cobaan, tapi halangan. Aku nggak berhasil meyakinkan dia buat terus berusaha demi aku. Demi kami.Aku paling ingat kata-katanya temannya George (Kathryn Bernardo), salah satu tokoh utama di film ini. “George, I know that story all too well. First, you start to listen. Then you believe what he says. Then you agree what he wants. Then you’re fooled again, you’re naive another time! Listen to me, do not repeat the same mistake!”George adalah perempuan cerdas yang bisa jadi contoh dari kalimat, “Kalau soal cinta, semua orang bisa jadi goblok.” Temannya George udah kayak Kak Ira, kakak sepupuku, pas nasehatin aku jangan sampai balikan sama mantan.Hiks. Ditambah lagi, George dan Primo (Daniel Padilla), sepasang kekasih yang udah jadi mantan, waktu pacaran punya panggilan sayang. Yaitu Jo.JO ANJEEEEER.KENAPA HARUS JO. ANJEEEEEEEEEEEER.FILM KURANG UAJAAAAAAAR. Ya gimana, aku manggil si mantan waktu masih pacaran dengan nama Jojo. Tapi aku sering panggil dia, “Jo,’ dan nama kontaknya di hapeku itu aku tulisin nama Jo. HUAAAAAAA KENAPA BISA KEBETULAN SIIIIH. Film ini brengsek. Patut aku bilang brengsek karena bikin aku optimis aja buat balikan sama si mantan. Bikin mikir kalau aku juga bisa kayak George yang akhirnya balikan sama Primo. Aku nggak bisa bohong dengan bilang aku nggak sayang sama mantan. Aku masih. Nggak berubah. Nggak tau sampai kapan. Aku pengen rasa ini berubah, minimal berkurang sedikit. Tapi malah…. aaaarrrrrrrgh. Cuman kalau balikan lagi, pasti kami berantem lagi. Nyakitin lagi masing-masing.Hahahaha. Hahaha. Haha. Ha.Ih ngeselin ya kalau jadi orang baperan. Mau nonton apapun dibaperin ke diri sendiri.",2019-08-26,9

Hows of Us,"The power of this movie is aint about their relationship, instead is about George's relationship with her mother, brother, and family. So beautiful although sometimes cringey.",2019-09-30,4
Hows of Us,"Downright mediocre. So many unnecessary hugot lines, drama scenes— typical Cathy Molina-Carmi Raymundo movie. Moses even said to me: “mababaw luha mo, bakit di ka umiyak?”. Why would I? As a matter of fact, I was cringing for the most parts, the movie also romanticized a problematic relationship. Why???? I enjoyed the first act though, but that was it. The rest? Meh. Totally unwatchable if not for Kathryn. So kudos to her. Dinala niya buong movie, eh. That one star is for Kath and Orange & Lemon’s music as OST. Also, tangina talaga ng mga lalakeng kuhang-kuha ka sa isang ngiti at kanta nila.

Hows of Us,Lebay anjir,2019-11-01,0
Hows of Us,"Sebuah film drama yang mempunyai cerita yang tidak baru.Sebenarnya film ini bisa menjadi tontonan yang menghibur, namun dalam eksekusinya film ini seperti terlalu panjang karena ada cerita sampingan seperti adiknya yang sakit, pencarian sang ayah yang sebenarnya tidak penting. Sehingga menonton film ini cukup melelahkan. Padahal bila film ini fokus terhadap pasang surut hubungan sang tokoh utama, maka film ini sangat manis.Sebuah film dengan rasa opera sabun yang durasinya terlalu lama.Setidaknya lagunya cukup enak didengar.",2019-11-05,9
Hows of Us,"Membosankan, dari dulu karakter Kathryn dan Daniel begitu2 saja.Ceritanya nggak ada yang spesial sih. Tentang kesuksesan, karier, idealisme, dan cinta. Ada plot adiknya yang mau banget ketemu ayahnya di Belanda. Menurutku itu nggak perlu. Kayak nggak ada efeknya buat jalan cerita utama. Seakan mau pamer aja syut di Amsterdam, setelah sebelumnya di Barcelona di film Barcelona A Love Untold. Tapi bukan berarti buruk. Walau klise, cerita dibuat se-believeable mungkin. Sebab akibatnya. Konsekuensinya. Tentang si perempuan yang muak dengan idealisme cowoknya. Masa si Daniel (eh aku lupa di sini nama peran dia siapa? sudah nonton sebulan lalu) nggak mau nyanyi bahasa Inggris di kafe hanya karena idealisme. Hehehehe. Mending situ nyanyi di kamar mandi, kan beda musisi pro dan musisi kamar. Maksudnya keidealismean dia terlalu banyak dan kurang menohok aja. Bahkan sampai ditinggalkan temen ngebandnya. Mungkin mereka disuruh ganti genre dangdut kali ya sama produser rekamannya sampai Daniel nolak ambil proyek rekaman.Si Kathryn gagal jadi dokter, karena mengurus suami kumpul kebonya. Mereka belum kawin sih. Tapi bebas, kan Filipina. Di sini juga ada wkwkw. Aku suka aja kegerahan Kathryn dengan toxic relationships antara mereka berdua. Kalau cinta itu butuh duit, bukan cuma kepercayaan. Sayang aja mesti happy ending dan mereka balikan lagi. Kalau gue mah ogah, emansipasi ciiinn. Women empowerment  Sebenarnya kalau kita sering nonton film dan sinetron mereka berdua, mirip lah kayak couple Michelle Zuidith dan Rizky Nassar atau Dimas Anggara. Sutradaranya juga sama aja. Kayak ditulis khusus penggemar mereka. Waktu film ini tayang di bioskop Indonesia, banyak komen filmnya syedih bingitttt. Four Sisters and the Wedding: take my tissue!",2019-11-11,2

Hows of Us,"I'll be honest, this movies was on my bucketlist so my expectations were kinda high. It's a VERY TYPICAL Filipino romantic film. There was nothing new about it that would make your mind blown. Most of the scenes are those that you can see in other filipino films such as after the break up, the guy will return to win back the lost love of the girl, the ""traveling to other places to strengthen the relatonship"" and the overly dramatic confrontation scenes. (which in fact 'caused me to be teary eyed lol!) What makes it more exciting was Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo was in it! They were so good together and you can just feel the love they have for each other. They demonstrated good acting skills and their script- DAMN. Most of it were heartbreaking. Overall, I did like this movie and I can feel that most of the people in the cinema enjoyed it as well.",2020-04-03,8

Hows of Us,My fav movie,2020-07-10,-1
Hows of Us,"The first act, sweetie, you're doing amazing! The Amsterdam sequence—you don't even go here Just when I thought this film strayed away from formulaic, comfortable rom-com that never fails to have: a hugot festival, kids with parental issues, and the need to go to special places to release repressed feelings, instead it stayed loyal to it. The beginning was so promising, may pa-slow motion pa, but it wasn't consistent. Also, I'm curious as to how and why they make the audio in these types of films. There's something about how voices are amplified too much or smoothened out. Sometimes, it looks like it was dubbed which I find disturbing. Anyway, Kathryn Bernado's acting is stale as ever and I almost pity Daniel Padilla who caged in roles as a charismatic loverboy that it scares me to see him outside it.",2020-07-20,2
Hows of Us,"While the start and main problem were promising, the formulaic resolution was very disappointing. I just don't get the point of already starting with the post-breakup, and then showing the redeeming value of Primo was with him all along, even before the breakup, as if pointing out that it was all a misunderstanding. This subtly puts the blame on George for not knowing that Primo was actually a good man (she should have just trusted him!).This should have been a film about HOW Primo acknowledges his accountability and redeems himself, and HOW George finally finds in herself the courage to forgive and love again. That would have been less formulaic, less harmful, and most probably very endearing.Also, what's with the exaggerated acting? Almost all of them are good to great actors (except of course for Espanto), and yet most of them were also over the top. I think, because they have proven in their other projects that they can act, that it's a directorial problem. Which is also suprising, given that this is Garcia-Molina we are talking about.",2020-08-01,4
Hows of Us,"the only thing i don't like about this movie is that we all know that their relationship is already toxic and yet we are being forced to root for that said couple. but i also believe that there is a room for change and development for one's self, and both george & primo showed that they did become better people.anyway 1 star because this movie almost made me cry. 2 stars for kathryn bernardo herself, she must be very tired of carrying the whole movie by herself.",2020-08-11,4

Hows of Us,filipino rom-com/rom-dramalikeable movie; kathryn and daniel don't pass as seasoned adults though. they look like kids ...,2020-09-28,2
Hows of Us,"This is the first Kathniel project i ever truly liked — loved even! In typical Star Cinema fashion, the movie starts with a chaotic scene depicting hyperactive leads that, somehow, lose that hyperactivity through the rest of the film.In another typical Star Cinema fashion, insert the need to shoot in a foreign country. I have to be honest, though — those Amsterdam scenes could have also panned out effectively if shot in some remote province in the Philippines. But, yeah, I know Amsterdam doesn’t require permits for filming there, so I guess Star Cinema took the opportunity to film and have a European vacation at the same time. Typical Filipino showbusiness tactic. Splitting the house in two - seen that many times, mostly in comedies. It did the job for this movie, though. It worked as a story device that did not feel forced.Anyway, Kathryn and Daniel have both really matured in this movie. Especially Kathryn — in all her previous movies where she was supposed to play an adult, she didn’t quite do so well. I mean, acting-wise, she did. But in terms of looks, she always looked like some teenager and, sometimes, even a child. So I commend the styling team for doing a good job with her look for “The How’s of Us”. Her screen presence matured. As for Daniel, boy, has he grown into a man. I especially love him in this role. I love it when men are depicted as soft, vulnerable, and pitiful — in the context of a love story, of course.And this — I cried. Yup. I tried to hold back the tears, but I just couldn’t. This is the true hallmark of good storytelling — when you fight your emotion, but it gets the better of you.",2020-09-29,2

Hows of Us,"Napanuod ko ulit kasi nasa netflix na.Anyway, eto yung movie ng kathniel na tumatak talaga sakin. Hindi naman siya ganun kaganda. Very basic lang din naman ang kwento, para ngang starting over again na onting iniba lang. Pero siguro kasi nung pinanuod ko to, kasama ko ex ko tapos gantong ganto din yung sitwasyon namin (Ako si Jo) humagulgol ako sa sinehan nun tapos di muna kami nagusap saglit, siguro kasi alam nyang aKO LAHAT ANG NAG AASIKASO SA LAHAT NG BAGAY AT WALA SYANG GINAGAWA. Charot. Anyway, ayun. Syempre di na ko nakarelate dun sa Amsterdam nila, at sa nagkabalikan sila. hanggang dun lang ako nakarelate sa triny ni Primo makipagbalikan, pero hindi na tanga si Jo. (Yesss, hindi na ko tanga, and masaya padin ako) HAHAHAHA. daming entrada. Anyway ulit. Putanginang Kuryente at tubig naman kasi yan, at ng cake na yan, miski cupcake kasi wala.

Hows of Us,"don’t get me wrong, kathryn and daniel did well on this film, especially the former who seemingly carried the film on her back (as most critics seem to be saying— and i agree) but, as there always is an apprehensive but, the storyline was, objectively and personally, not to my taste. not only did it remind me and my mother (who cried very hard might i add) of my parents’ abusive relationship, it was just . . . hard to force myself to like primo. i saw too much of my father in him, a man i hate and have no pity for. they were too alike— in their actions, words, beings, so how could i forgive one and crucify the other?i think this brings us back to how good of an actor daniel was in this film. i don’t think it was his best performance, but it definitely wasn’t his worst. he portrayed primo very well, showcasing the complexities of his being making one question whether or not he really deserves to be forgiven. (i personally would not have forgiven him, i have to say. the relationship that primo and george had was too toxic, and it hit a little too close to home than my liking)there are many things i would still like to say about this film, perhaps i’ll expound more on this when the morning comes. just know that this was a good watch, not the best, not the worst, but good.",2020-10-24,2
Hows of Us,"""George, I'm sorry.""""And what makes that sorry different from all your other sorrys before?""I've always been a devoted admirer of Kathniel, eagerly anticipating each of their upcoming movies. They stand out as my preferred Filipino loveteam, especially since I used to follow Social Seryes on Twitter inspired by their story. My admiration for Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo deepened after watching this particular film in theaters.While the movie's plot follows the typical, cliché, and foreseeable pattern of Filipino romance films, I found it delightful because of the remarkable chemistry between the two leads. Somehow, they infused it with a special and heartfelt quality. Kathryn Bernardo's acting deserves special recognition; her exceptional performance left a lasting impact, even stirring my emotions at 3:00 AM.Forgiveness, a challenging virtue, becomes particularly daunting when faced with someone who has caused you pain and shattered your self-esteem. The decision to forgive or harbor perpetual resentment carries immense pressure, complicated further by the fear of disappointing those opposed to your chosen path.I won't deny that Primo was quite the jerk in the past, blinded by his dreams to the harsh realities around him. Despite acknowledging George's struggles in a letter, he failed to take meaningful action. His reckless behavior, fueled by alcohol, exacerbated their financial woes. Fortunately, George displayed remarkable understanding and selflessness. It's heartening that Primo eventually transformed into a better person, learning from his mistakes and genuinely committed to fixing everything.In contrast, I resonate more with George's approach. I refuse to let the same person inflict harm on me once again.",2020-10-24,-1

Hows of Us,"I still think that SDTG is Kathniel's best film (despite the unnecessary medical-related sub-plot), but THOS is so special. This is Daniel Padilla's best. I saw him grow as an actor from the same bad boy teenager roles since Growing Up, and his comfortability on screen makes him better.What I do not like about the film is the same medical-related subplot, the parental issues, friends/family conflicts. Same Cathy Garcia-Molina formula. Same Filipino romcom formula. What made this film better though is how warm and pleasant Kathryn and Daniel act together. Their chemistry made this film work. I would have loved this more if the film focuses on Primo and George's story. More scenes during their stay on Tita Lola's house, what happened after Primo left, and after Primo came back. It's like the Barcelona: A Love Untold. Too many sub-stories that could have been deleted.Overall, I love it. THIS IS DANIEL PADILLA'S MOVIE.",2020-10-24,2

Hows of Us,"At two hours long, ""The Hows of Us"" was limited severely by so much bloat and so many tropes that it really made us wonder why they just didn't tell a straightforward story in the first place. But don't get us wrong though, it wasn't a bad experience at all and we actually found ourselves liking this film much more than we anticipated. But its barely middling middle section should have been reworked maybe even removed.For years, Jo (Kathryn Bernardo) and Primo (Daniel Padilla) had a long-lasting relationship so much so that when Jo’s Aunt died, she left her house to the both of them. But with Primo, a budding musician, failing to attain the success that he feels he is beholden to and with Jo feeling that Primo’s failures are holding her back, Primo abandons Jo all by herself. A few years pass by when Primo suddenly shows up and wants to fix the wrongs he has done in the past - including his relationship with Jo. But this isn’t as simple as it sounds as Jo plans to sell their house soon and hasn’t really forgiven and forgotten that Primo left her to fend for herself. We must admit that “The Hows of Us” left us with a heavy dose of mixed feelings. On one hand, its narrative and story really had potential to be substantially and emotionally moving. But the film also suffers because it felt it needed to do genre tropes within its story that was just unnecessary. For example, there’s a parent or sibling who suffers a sickness in the most opportune time or simply travelling to a foreign country. We wished it just told a more straightforward and down-to-earth story - one that we could actually imagine happening in real-life and not one obviously written for the big screen. While the overall narrative was bloated, the film actually had bright spots. In fact, the first thirty minutes and last thirty minutes were outstanding in our opinion. It had us gripping our seats with emotionally moving moments. Of course, these scenes were bolstered by the great chemistry and acting between Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla. Overall though, “The Hows of Us” will make you swoon in key moments and if that’s what you’re after, you’ll actually find it a story worth experiencing.

Hows of Us,"CGM's style just hasn't aged well. People in her movies don't talk and act like people normally would. Mas concerned sila with inserting catchy lines they can put in their trailers than with actually making human stories.Kathryn is great in her dramatic moments, and I think those moments show sparks of how much better this movie could have been. However, you could really feel her exerting in moments where she should come off as steely or sexy. I think Daniel is the better actor between the two, but his character is just irredeemably awful. They are both really capable actors but it almost feels like they're being forced to recite these awful and cheesy lines.I hate when movies try to make toxic relationships cutesy. Like the years of him disrupting her from achieving her dreams and holding her back is not enough, he has to force himself back into her life, and we're supposed to find it cute. Nah.",2020-10-26,2

Hows of Us,"If you saw me crying during this movie, no you didn't. Kathryn Bernardo was amazing in this film. Her acting really matured so much, and you could tell that she and Daniel worked extremely hard on it. The two had revealed that some of their lines had been taken from their own relationship, and it makes a lot of sense. The emotion they'd all put out was genuine, and it was all a lot of great acting. It was also a really good story for the duo's usual repertoire, and I love that they decided to give them a more mature story that was on the level of Cathy Garcia-Molina's masterpieces like One More Chance. It was relatable, fun and heartbreaking all at the same time. It's a great Filipino movie. I highly recommend.",2020-10-24,2

Hows of Us,"this is peak Pinoy romcom cinema. it has everything you’d expect; flashbacks and flashforwards, a junket trip to Europe, 2 charismatic leads, etc. what separates this from the fluff is its execution, the story (up until the end) is well crafted and avoids the natural pitfalls of the premise it set up for itself. the protagonists have agency and do not make any decision just for plot contrivance. not to say this is a perfect movie, it has its problems— the editing and pacing is not quite there. it spends way too much time meandering through Amsterdam, and crafting a Pixar Up-like sequence in the beginning was not necessary if they were only going to spend a lot of running time going through the past all over again, so there is no economy of storytelling present. my biggest problem though is the ending. i understand why they did it the way they did, but imo it was completely unnecessary and actually harms the characters’ growth during the movie. SPOILER what the ending does is retcon the movie’s story; we find out in the end that Primo actually knew he was being a selfish prick before he left, but instead of actually doing something about it, he instead, what, wrote a letter? that makes it okay? that actually makes it worse, because now we know he had a CHOICE to be better 2 years ago, but he chose not to. his 2 years of change therefore did not matter because it implies he in fact didn’t change, at all. then they have George APOLOGIZING to him? as if anything was her fault? that is wrong on so many levels. this development looks unfortunately to have been put there only to create a reason for George to get back together with Primo in time for the movie to end, but this was completely unnecessary. Primo has grown as a person, he’s already shown this to George, and George already acknowledges that he has. there was no need for the letter. instead, what they should have done was, after all the items have been sold off, have both of them say farewell to their past selves, the people that owned that house, and reintroduce each other as new people. have the movie end with George agreeing to go on a first date with Primo, a chance that this time around, things will work out.",2020-11-04,8

Meh plotline. Nothing new there. It's obviously a money-grabbing, fan service blandness.4. Not well-acted at all. Not one of them. But especially, Kathryn. Please, crying easy doesn't mean your acting is effective.5. Philippine cinema formula. Yes, let's shoot at overseas location to use the beautiful sceneries as background and our studio gave us extra budget anyway eventhough it doesn't really add anything to the story itself. Check.6. The unnecessarily long runtime of 117 minutes. There's lot of useless stuff there. Does this film think it's an epic?7. What's up with that end credits scene? Soooo cringey.8. If Kathniel and Direk Cathy think this is their mature take on romance movie, they're deluded.

Hows of Us,"Ugh boy. It started with a promising first act that got me really hooked on to the movie and liking it right away. There were scenes that were all too real and relatable. Then the second act came and this movie just falls into like any other Filipino romantic drama films with the “return of the exes and still hung up from each other after not seeing or communicating after many years but it felt like nothing has changed and we still love each other so much that we end up together because LOVE CONQUERS ALL ADVERSITIES” trope with a little bit of an identity crisis from our supporting characters as a side plot.I really thought this film was gonna give us a tale of couples dealing with ups and downs and eventually, a breakup and going through the transition of being single after being in a committed relationship for so long. It did touch that issue in the first act but it was so rushed and I just didn’t feel any sympathy or connection with the characters. I really believe this movie isn’t really worth the hype.Phenomenal acting from Kathryn but still unimpressed with Daniel’s acting ability still.

Hows of Us,"The Hows of Us is a beautifully written film that touches all the romantics out there - giving us the beauty and sappiness of romantic comedies while giving the harsh realities that hurt us within.Kathryn Bernardo is in her prime in this movie, given with such great lines, direction, and build up with her partner Daniel Padilla. I just cannot emphasize more how the characters have provided bittersweet scenes. The pain lingers even though it's a happy ending.Also, I want to go to Amsterdam.",2020-12-25,7

Hows of Us,"Finally completed my Kathniel movie list... probably the best one if not at least in the top 3? Plot and some scenes will always be cheesy but it's too be expected so I wasn't thrown off. Kathryn.... you really said watch me GROW. You can tell she knows she's good and I love it! You cry, I cry!!!! Daniel ofc that FACE and the VOICE, but it's hard to comment on his acting since he gets generally the same roles with very similar personalities. There was definitely more depth this time around . I enjoyed it way too much to get into the things i didn't like that are just ingrained in these romcoms. Regardless they know I will eat up any movie they throw at me, keep 'em comin'! Kathniel RISE!!!!",2020-12-29,2
Hows of Us,"The Hows of Us is a drama romcom type film about a Filipino boyfriend musician and a girlfriend on her way to being a doctor growing individually as well as through their relationship in ties with their new home purchase. The film touches on aspects of romance/love, aspects of grief loss, aspects of depression, aspects of addiction, aspects of being a homeowner, aspects of negative pride, aspects of romantic relationships/friendships, aspects of maturity, aspects of family, and aspects of diabetic retinopathy amongst other points. The camera work is on point. The acting partners fulfill the film. I find the film funnier than sad. The film has some interesting messages about relationships. Though I think a lot is simply put together to fluff the film/make it make more sense toward the end, I find the film entertaining.",2020-12-29,7

Hows of Us,filipino love team culture is toxic and usually the members of that love team cant act but kathryn is different. she IS that ACTRESS!,2021-01-11,8
Hows of Us,"hindi ko alam if i’m just getting back into pinoy movies or my star cinema melodrama bias is acting up but i really liked this movie. kathryn is such a good actor and i’m realizing that more than ever. daniel is decent at most but it does feel natural to see him with kathryn— and that plays a huge part on how we see him on screen. most actors are great aside from darren. palagi naman may ini-introduce na “young talent” ang star cinema in all of their movies na hindi talaga marunong umarte so i guess masasanay ka na din. yun lang, ang pangit at awkward talaga. isa pang pansin ko: color grading sa amsterdam scenes sobrang processed! you’re already in amsterdam, might as well follow its natural vibe instead of presenting it as a much brighter, summery place compared to the philippines (where it’s always bright and summery). plot-wise, decent pero overused as usual. sa script lang lagi nagkakatalo ang mga star cinema melodramatic romance blockbusters and this was average. kathryn lang talaga nagdala. and she did a damn good job! parang character niya sa movie, dalang-dala niya si daniel. good for her! go girl! ayun, overall ay bigyan natin siya ng 3.5 stars. it’s definitely good enough to be called generally well-made. at napaiyak niya ako so laking factor din yun for this very serious and very lengthy review in the very revered letterbox.",2021-01-16,-1
Hows of Us,Super love this movie. High quality production. Great acting and great direction. I cried many tears.,2020-11-17,31
Hows of Us,you can't change my mind when i say kathryn bernardo is the filipina actress of our generation,2021-01-19,21
Hows of Us,"The Hows Of Us could've been a strong film, especially with Kathryn Bernardo's effective acting. But the topsy turvy storytelling ruined a good experience. It started off too serious and heavy, then shifted to a corny rom-com approach and a third act that's unnecessary (ma-justify lang ng prod team pag-abroad nila under Star Cinema's expense). Daniel Padilla's acting is generic and was overshadowed by Kathryn's more upfront character. Still, they do kilig scenes the best. The dialogue would hit couples who experienced a similar dilemma as Primo and George - and that's a real dart to the heart.",2021-01-22,7

Hows of Us,only watched like 15 mins and then stopped because i realized this is just a concoction of all the things i hate in filipino cinema. also wtf were those misogynistic lines WHAT WAS THE POINT,2021-02-02,8
Hows of Us,"Okayy something new to me.. I don't usually do pinoy films, but I was urged by a friend to see flicks featuring Kathryn Bernardo and first up was this film.I think this is the 1st time for Kathryn to bask into a more mature role, and she did great showing off some skin (e.g. sandos, sleeveless shirts lol). Pretty straight forward plot, yet brought to life by the good performance by Kath who carried the whole film unto her tiny shoulders.",2021-02-03,2
Hows of Us,"So this is the first time for me to watch a KathNiel film, and HOLY MOTHER OF GOD KATHRYN IS THE MOST ADORABLE ACTRESS. She so adorable I want to hold her back in the Jeepney and tell her ""no girl he ain't worth it don't go saving that drunk!"" She so adorable I want to put a towel over her as she monologues in the rain. She so adorable I want to drink with her and Ria and Gege and convince her that she deserves better. She so adorable that I want to find a cure for Darren Espanto's diabetic retinopathy so she won't have to worry so much. She so adorable I want to find that record under the fridge and give it to her at the start of the film so she won't have to go through all that torment. What a star, this girl.",2021-02-03,2

Hows of Us,cried on my first watch but now? meh,2021-02-28,16
Hows of Us,"It's been a long time (years) since my last Thailand's movie, and The Hows of Us reminds me on Thailand's movie ability to make us laugh at their silliness, the authentic stupid dialogue, I enjoy that so much (a lot of time I find it hard to accept the slow motion scene and the cheesy dialogue on Korean movie, but Thailand's unrealistic stupid dialogue is just so pure and authentic I love it cso much).There's nothing special from the plot, it's a basic romance story line--the couple fall in love, flirt and fight with each other, act stupid--just like other relationship. But I like this movie because I just miss watching an enjoyable basic romantic comedy movie, my all time favorit, my comfort zone.",2021-02-12,7
Hows of Us,"still surprisingly rich with insight about relationships and the time we spend up keeping them, ourselves and the thresholds we maintain for sanity, and how integral sacrifice is for survival. this film probably does not deserve my musings. a good tear or two were shed.",2021-03-01,9
Hows of Us,"The film's premise surely captures the kind of sentimentality that is born out of selfless devotion. George (Kathryn Bernardo) represents every doting lover who understands that love is both a struggle and sacrifice. But she's human enough to reach her breaking point, that non-singular moment Primo (Daniel Padilla), her lover, erodes into a miserable man. That's outright promising, given an opportunity to go deep into the characters' core. Until the narrative submits to Star Cinema formula. While Primo tries to win George back, a lot of other things happen, all brazenly pointing to them realizing they need to be back together, even if he decides to set her free--a banal device that aims to make love look elusive but more intense. Because how are these two characters supposed to respond to other charcters whose sole duty is to remind them that they still love each other? The sequences in Amsterdam feel like you're watching a different film, with characters so eager to accomplish something for a great cause. The attempt at proving its significance by way of editorializing the flowers and the sunset does not put weight on either the characters or the narrative itself. Daniel effortlessly delivers, his eyes expressing the right emotions. Kathryn tries hard, a few times she's hitting it. Other times she's like a dainty, vulnerable young girl being forced to battle tough times. Her eyes convey ambiguity rather than perceptive and penetrating responses that don't demand words. Her delivery of ""quotable quotes"" and the lines in the debate scene sounds like a graded recitation (yung mukhang minemorize nang maigi).And then the film gets too didactic, telling us what we should make of how Primo and George triumphed at their story and how we should distinguish battle and war as metaphors for love (kung maka-figure of speech!). The film is supposed to tackle maturity in relationship, but it appears that its depiction does not quite go with its marketing. And Star Cinema is not bothered by such incongruency. It just continues to shape love through a narrative that always turns factitious and simplistic. It does not mind reducing it into the fundamentals of melodrama and simplified association or discourse.",2021-03-02,4
Hows of Us,kathryn hard carried this one,2021-03-03,12
Hows of Us,"Kathryn did well. Realistic scenes of heartbreak is hard to execute, i think Daniel can relate in this film. The film is well done, a bit of a bumpy road in the middle but the ending is actually good. Underrated film imo.. people don’t appreciate this much as a good executed film.. some see it as “Kathryn, Daniel movie? Yey”.. which is fair,, but appreciate it while not overrating it pls.",2021-03-04,2
Hows of Us,"One of Kathryn and Daniel’s best films in terms of acting. The story did really well in the first half, but it eventually got lost. There were many out of place scenes that also felt unbelievable. The movie would’ve been better if they didn’t drag it too much.",2021-03-06,2

Hows of Us,"The sub plot is actually similar to Marriage Story. Kathryn did great. I just hoped some didn’t play too exaggerated at times and this would have been a 4.. i surprisingly like this more than most people..Edit from 3.5 to 3.. well, this was executed in a way i really didn’t like, i’m not invested in the characters so much mainly because they are not relatable but they are imaginable, so imaginable that a kid can imagine making these characters. Again, storyline is good.",2021-03-20,2

Hows of Us,"This film glorifies giving chummy ""efforts"" and gifts as a way to earn female affection and forgiveness. But I will not comment on that yet, and instead focus on the scene that I think gave me the impression that this film could be considered a cultural artifact of our time. And that scene is when Bernardo and Padilla's characters were putting price tags on the items from their house, as if memories are quantifiable in pesos. (Also special mention, Rice…",2021-04-29,-1

Hows of Us,The second highest grossing movie of the Philippines of all time is indeed a gem. The Hows of Us is in fact an anti-love story. The movie explores not the best moments in a relationship but sets it’s focus on the moments that were the beginning of the end. The calm vibe and the direct confrontations of the couple make the movie captivating and leave a bitter taste. Bernardo and Padilla act so damn good in this film that I had to check if they indeed broke up in real life. So many emotional moments and the question “Who’s right?” pull the viewer into the story. The rain scene is one of the most legendary moments in Filipino cinema for me. So many emotions with so less words really got me. I really loved the movie and can understand why every Filipino I met recommended me this masterpiece. It’s worth watching!,2021-09-22,7

Hows of Us,"Perhaps the most formally assured of these--Garcia-Molina plays with temporality in interesting ways, and utilizes spaces extremely well, using set design to suggest barriers between her leads--and these are my favorite KathNiel performances so far, but, I found the story a bit too busy, cramming extra sub-plots (a health scare AND a long-lost father?) that distract from the central relationship (and they do much more than merely distract: they actively conspire against it, as it keeps alive the dream that external events could solve the problems in their relationships....which is never the case, the changes must come from within!)But perhaps I'm being harsh, as this is a serious, adult drama (albeit with moments of levity), one that isn't content with the rosy-eyed ""relationships are easy"" view (nor one that ignores its characters material circumstances; money pressures drive all the key events in the film).",2021-09-27,2

Terdengar simpel, sederhana dan sudah ketebak. Tapi yang membuat film ini berbeda dengan drama percintaan pada umumnya adalah pengemasannya. Pemilihan kata dalam dialognya yang sempurna, banyak yang relate dengan kisah seperti ini dan film ini juga sangat jujur dan realistis. Cathy Garcia-Molina berhasil mengangkat kisah biasa yang sering dialami dalam hubungan, sesuai realita, namun dikemas dengan sangat baik. Film kedua dari sutradara perempuan Filipina Cathy Garcia-Molina yang aku tonton. Berawal dari Hello, Love, Goodbye (2019) dengan soundtracknya ""Ikaw At Ako"" yang masih terngiang-ngiang dikepala menuntunku ke film ini, dan aku ketagihan dengan caranya bertutur dalam filmnya, jujur aku menikmatinya. The Hows of Us (2018) juga kabarnya memecahkan banyak rekor perfilman di Filipina dan menjadi film terlaris sepanjang masa di Filipina.Duet Kathryn Bernardo dan Daniel Padilla udah kayak benar-benar pasangan pada umumya, natural kali gak lebay dan berlebihan. Oh ya baru tau juga aku kalo mereka katanya dinobatkan sebagai pasangan klop yang sering dipasangkan diberbagai serial drama dan film.

Hows of Us,"Streaming on Netflix now is this topgrossing 2018 Filipino drama that i somehow liked and shamefully but not secretly enjoyed and bawled my eyes out to.  It tells the story of former lovers Primo and George who, at the beginning of the film, relive the days and sad occasions that led to their break-up. For fans of Filipino tearjerkers, a box of tissue may not be enough for this film. It will squeeze you out dry but you will not be complaining. This movie hits all the right formula in the genre. From the beautiful cast to the relatable relationship drama that’s been a staple of Philippine cinema for decades now. The story is somewhat typical but the storytelling is fresh. The conflict is as old as Sharon Cuneta’s first movie (or could be older) but the execution somehow feels novel. There are many cutesy scenes definitely constructed for the diehard fans of the loveteam but it somehow does not offend or get in the way of the developing drama. There is a subplot that will not ordinarily work but somehow works here. Every emotion this movie elicits from the audience is definitely earned. The great character actress Odette Khan appears in a cameo towards the end of the movie that only made me love this film more.",2022-02-25,-1

Hows of Us,"My second rewatch thoughts:This film is actually kind of good. What I don't like about it is how unrealistic some of the scenes are, but it's saved by the amazing performance of Kathryn and her co-star Daniel. The chemistry they both have is seen clearly in here. Of course, it wouldn't be a Star Cinema film without the following:1. an emotional scene while raining2. going abroad3. medical issues4. daddy/mommy issues5. cheesy and sometimes even cringy lines that feels unrealistic if said in real life.With all of these in mind, I enjoyed the film because it shows the struggle between the people, and how we should always have each other's back no matter what. "" The story they end up telling is actually pretty simple, but there are just so many other things that crowd out the much more affecting core of this story: two people still clearly in love with each other, just trying to overcome the hurt that also still exists between them.

Hows of Us,"Akala ko nung una heavy drama to..... 1. Ang ganda sa umpisa kaso naiba yung direksyon ng kwento nung kalagitnaan hanggang huli2. Contrary sa nakita kong reactions ng fans, di ako agree na problematic si Primo. Oo, idealistic siya at ma-pride. Pero bata pa siya nun. Atsaka tingin ko may pagkukulang din si George. Sa relasyon kasi, dapat may communication. Bigayan kumbaga. Kaso, pareho silang nagsasarili ng hinanakit nila. Pwede naman maayos yan sa masinsinang usapan. Di sinabi ni George yung expectations niya kay Primo at nagtiis nalang siya sa gilid hanggang napuno na siya3. Gusto ko pang makilala si Primo. Parang dito sa movie na to, albeit lovestory siya, mas focused kay George yung kwento. Naging 'pixie dream girl' si Primo. Gusto ko siya. Partly siguro dahil ang charismatic ni Daniel Padilla 4. May ibang plot lines and characters na unnecessary at naging plot device lang sila. Gaya nung past romance movie na napanood ko, di na kelangan pumunta sa ibang bansa para gawing nakakakilig yung story. Tbh, parang irrelevant nga sa main story yung Amsterdam plot nila.5. Sobrang rare talaga siguro ng filipino romance (lalo na yung focused sa loveteam) na maging grounded sa reality. May ibang lines sa movie na kung di korni eh unrealistic. Like, wala namang taong nakakaisip agad ng hugot line and take note, yung sobrang madrama pa. Gusto ko lang siguro talaga ng romance story na makatotohanan. Yung pakiramdam mo totoong tao talaga yung mga characters at hindi para for kilig lang",2022-04-15,5

Hows of Us,This is one of my go-to movies but the ending sucks. Why would she go back to someone who wrecked and delayed her future? Primo's side wasn't enough reason for her to come back to him. The first half was indeed great but the ending was disappointing.4 stars because Kathryn was really in character for this one. Carried the film once again!,2022-04-24,4

Hows of Us,"I’ve watched this film countless times and I just want to watch it again because of the soundtrack number one, the story and because I’m sick and in no mood to watch new movies. Plus I missed this movie because of the trend that’s going around tiktok right now tumawid ka na baby. It reminds me of him in a bittersweet way. Primo the ultimate red flag. I’m quite happy na alam ko sa sarili ko that I would never let this happen to me under any circumstance. It’s just not possible for me be in this situation. First I have a rule I made for myself, that if I want to be in a relationship or to experience relationships it would be during high school. Because I won’t be going to college with a boyfriend. I can’t afford distraction, medicine is already too much I can’t afford to bother with another humans physical and mental health? Plus what do you need a man for? What exactly is their use? You won’t gain anything from, physical touch is 0% on my love language so men would be a 100% hindrance in my case. And don’t start with “makakahanap ka din ng katapat mo” or “bitter, sino nanakit sa ‘yo?” Wala. Tumahimik ka nalang because like men I don’t need an opinion from you about myself. If I’m gonna be honest, I like Primo sa una, he is totally my type, passionate and knows what he wants in life. He’s also smart, musikero plus he’s Daniel Padilla for goodness sake? But my favorite character in this movie would still be Mikko my love the only one who has sense. But kahit ilang beses kong panuorin ‘rong movie na ‘to ‘pag hindi ako maga pause babaha nanaman here sa bahay. I tend to invalidate peoples feelings ‘pag nasabi nila na about sa relationship kung bakit sila depressed. And for all the people feelings whom I invalidate you deserve an apology. I’m so so sorry. My mindset used to be makipag break ka na tapos na lahat ng problema mo I mean for me hindi parin s’ya mahirap but maybe for others it won’t be that easy and I’m slowly opening to that possibility. I’m glad God didn’t give me a friend like George because I only would cry with her because of how much I care about her and I would go to jail because I would accidentally kill Primo. I love Kathryn and Daniel’s acting, I love all their movies omit Barcelona from the list I didn’t appreciate that movie quite as much. I love Can’t help falling in love, she’s dating the gangster of course a classic and this film. This movie has the potential to have my 5 stars and like if it weren’t for Darren Espanto can someone please remove him from the movie. I literally skip every time I see him, his acting was not it. He acts too young for his age in the movie, ‘yung eye sight may problema sa’yo not mentally. I’m so sorry for saying all this but seriously, ang childish? Who made him an actor? He’s a singer not an actor, porket na famous doesn’t mean he has the talent to act, y’all could literally choose anyone tapos he doesn’t look remotely close to the younger version of Yohan, that little kid did it better by the way. He infuriated me more than Primo did all through the movie.Na delete ‘yung other review ko fml. Anyway I just finished the movie and earlier I said I’m so glad that it is impossible for me to experience something like this, but at the end the pain and love of the kiss George and Primo shared made me think what it feels like to fall in love and fall out of love and fall in love all together. I don’t think they ever stopped loving each other but you get my point. I could never experience loving or being loved that hard ever. Anyway, where is the new kathniel film?! The house arrest of us sucks I would rate it a negative if I could. Cringe sobra I feel so bad for the both of them to be forced to do this show.",2022-05-12,-1

Hows of Us,“I lost you.”“But we became better persons.”I revisited this movie today after watching it on cinemas last 2018. I definitely understand this movie better now. I think that Primo didn't deserve George. The girl sacrificed too many things for him. But I would be lying if I said I did not cry when she read the letter.... I have to stop consuming second chance romances because I am now rethinking every decision I have ever made.,2022-05-18,4

Hows of Us,"The acting was pretty good. Kathryn Bernardo was fantastic! When the movie jumped forward in time, the aging effects (makeup) was flawless. I actually thought we had seen a younger Kathryn before and now she's maybe in her 30s in the movie. Padilla plays the dipshit musician boyfriend a little too well. I think the film wants us to like him more than we do. But, I am nitpicking. It's a very sweet movie I'd happily watch with my Mom",2022-10-23,2

So I was tired of begging for your love because all you do is ignore my feelings. And when I said goodbye I still hope that you wouldn't let me go, but how could you let me go so easily? How could you never say sorry, why did you give up on me so easily when I needed you to fight for me just once.อยากถามเธอมาก ๆ เลยนะ ว่าทำไมถึงปล่อยเราไปง่ายจัง แค่เธอโทรมาเราก็พร้อมจะอยู่กับเธอแล้วแท้ ๆ ไม่คิดจะไปเลย ทั้งๆที่เรารอเธอมาตลอด แต่คงต้องยอมรับแล้วจริงๆแหละ อย่างน้อยทุกการจากลาก็ทำให้เราได้เป็นคนที่ดีขึ้นใช่มั้ยนะ.",2022-11-08,9

Hows of Us,"Honest thought, this could've been a good (not great) movie if George and Primo didn't end up together. The first few minutes of the film was okay, a bit realistic, but onwards, it became super cheesy and frustrating. Please, for the love of God, free Kathryn Bernardo from Daniel Padilla and Cathy Garcia Molina (and other mainstream directors). She either greatly overshadows DJ's acting skills or DJ drags her down with his acting (or the lack thereof). She also wouldn't grow as an actress if she just keeps getting the same role with different names. Cathy Molina has done it again with her favorite movie formula: the toxic guy gets in a relationship with the positive strong woman, they break up, guy or girl goes to a different country and then goes back to the Philippines years later, guy woos girl (redemption arc), girl forgives guy, and they live happily ever after. God, this is why Filipinos love to romanticize problematic relationships and toxic men.",2023-01-07,4

Hows of Us,"“Patience.”This is the moral of the movie. George and Primo showed a realistic relationship. It is not always a romantic one, sometimes it can be sad and heartbreaking. They let each other because they are tired — but letting go each other makes them grow and be the person they want to be. It is a matter of staying through thick and thin, through your darkest days. It is all about the patience we have in love. Sometimes we get tired, but it doesn't mean we don't want anymore. We just get tired, but we can rest.Maybe one of the lines that I can forget is, “we cannot survive to a battle if we fight each other, but staying together can conquer the battle.”This is one of the best Filipino movie I've ever watch, and undeniably the best KathNiel film ever produced. No doubt, this movie is the 2nd Highgest Grossing Filipino of all time. A masterpiece.",2023-01-27,-1

I feel like they should've just stuck to that.

Hows of Us,"Love the cold open--contemporary and innovative.Primo's a fucking red flag, egocentrically manipulative as ever. But perhaps Tita Lola was the real antagonist here, charot.Galing ng EO product placement.Very cliché, nakaka-cringe, as always with KathNiel films, but it’s their best films I've watched.I was wondering bakit kailangan umuulan pag may strong heartfelt scene between the two of them. I figured it must be symbolism for George's turmoiled feelings toward Primo. Tulips are definitely a symbolism as well for George's ideal partner. Primo gave him a plastic ones when he was courting her.Background music or the musical scoring can be a little excessive in some scenes, but I realized that commercial local films do be like that. Was it necessary to resolve George and her brother's daddy issue? I don't think that was essential, but the film could've been done without the Amsterdam trip. It could've ended with when they already sold the house. The whole Amsterdam trip and there on was like a second act.Overall, despite being cliche, good execution. Deserve naman ang pagiging batikan ni Direk Cathy Garcia-Molina, time-tested na rin. Subok na ng panahon, ganern.George's mistake was falling in love with Primo's potential.Personally, I resonate with George with her territorial and sungit trait; but damn, she's right, she's dumb and weak when it comes to the fucking guy. I WOULDN'T tolerate Primo's comeback if I were her. Pero feel ko binalikan niya lang din out of convenience and because first and only love.

Hows of Us,"The two stars are solely for Kathryn's PAGOD NA PAGOD NA PAGOD NA PAGOD NA AKO coz daaaamn the delivery is so good I felt thatRemove that scene and I will immediately give this a 0/5 for romanticizing problematic relationships. Primo is everything I don't want in a partner. George has very low self-esteem and lacks self-respect. Sacrificing your future and missing your NMAT exam for a prideful but useless man??? PURE IDIOCY. I can't even side nor feel pity for George. I'm so sorry sweet but you brought this upon yourself. I want to hit her in the head at least just once to wake her up from her own stupidity. I didn't even finish this movie. I stopped watching around the 30-minute mark when I was hinted that they'll surely get back together again. I just hate the ""going blind for love"" trope so much. This is a good portrayal of stupid immature young love, though, I'll give them that. Other than that, the story has no redeeming qualities unless it's rewritten so that Primo and George don't get back together again.",2023-02-18,4
Hows of Us,"now i get why filipinos eat this film up. shit ass story telling. how did it go from heavy to rom-com real quick? it had all the elements of a drama typical filipinos like: familial issues and relationships, prominent love team, mainstream production company, toxic character traits that make you SEETHE. bernardo carried this film with her acting otherwise it would be absolute trash.",2023-02-19,8

Hows of Us,"Realistic, emotional, and heartwarming. I really admire Primo’s character development to fight for his love for George. He was tireless in spite of the actuality that George repeatedly rejected his return in her life, that’s where I deeply feel that Primo’s true love for George kept going and it also kept on growing profusely as the time passed by. In the middle of the story, I was kind of confused by Primo’s behavior which was still blurry about where will they take their future to? I daresay it’s very related to the lives in the present time, especially for couples who want to bring their relationships to an improved or more serious level. I feel like watching real life experiences of a couple who became wise with their life experiences, hence it feels so real. It truly deserves a great rating!",2023-02-28,4

Hows of Us,"i still think primo was just doing the bare minimum. acts of service is expected. and of course he was going to put his best foot forward. if he was going to come back, couldn’t he have done it without being an invasion of private space? boundaries ? if you were going to come back a better person, what do you have to show for it? yea so, your dad was sick and you took over all the responsibilities? as you should ! you gave up your unrealistic main hustle and put it aside for jobs that pay? as you should. you do your best to make up past wrongs? as you should . dude’s got a big head start by being decent-looking, musically-gifted, and good with words. girl knew she was smart. it’s too bad she gave in and didn’t let learning experiences be learning experiences.ok hm. maybe sure he deserved at least a chance to prove himself, but redemption came too quickly in my opinion. like, given the 7-year relationship that turned to crap, you’d think it’d take at least a year or two (preferably more) to really prove that you’ve changed, right ? and that you’re capable of conducting the relationship right this time ? then again, what do I know .oh also— kathryn bernardo slayed.",2023-06-25,4

Hows of Us,"I think we can see parts of ourselves on both George and Primo. May mga panahon na we are ready to give everything up for our partners, even our individual dreams, hoping that everything will work out in the end. After all, sino bang hindi gusto yung taong mahal nila hanggang sa dulo, sa dulo kung saan masaya na kayo?Minsan din tayong naging Primo; desperately chasing our passions in life kahit hindi pa praktikal. Well, art should be a liveable job naman technically, but we all know the reality rn. Still, we all had a little bit of Primo in ourselves believing na what if our passion can be our career at the same time. But mahirap din maging George at Primo. While Primo was chasing his dreams, he forgot that he has a partner to take care of and consider. Si George naman, kakaasikaso at asiste kay Primo, nakalimutan na yung mga sarili niyang pangarap. For me, this is what made the movie realistic.What I didn't like though was the fact na nagkabalikan sila and how they approached it. Para kasing nabura rin kung gaano ka-shitty yung ginawa ni Primo kay George over the course of their relationship. For me, dapat hindi sila nagbalikan talaga. Hence 4 stars.

Hows of Us,"+ There is a hint of a better-written film in ""The Hows of Us"". The supposed premise of lovers continuing their emotionally halted journey in life together starts of strong. But with the number of expositions squattered throughout this film, mediocre characterizations, and underbaked romance, this film fails in deliverying a more memorable love-story. Its themes of redemption, growth, and forgiveness seems to be lop-sided in parts, and Kathryn Bernardo's George was poorly written—though Kathryn gave an ecstatic performance. Daniel Padilla as Primo, on the other hand, also gave enough nuance to make his character charming, and surprisingly earnest. Though much is to be desired in how this movie had told us its story, still, there is enough charm in here to win you over, even if it doesn't give you a lasting impression.",2023-07-28,7

Hows of Us,"revisiting this movie, whether it’s watching the whole thing or just watching clips of it, always makes me cry very very ugly tears especially the scene where george finally gets to read the letter primo wrote for her 2 years later  this movie just portrays the heartbreak of meeting the right person at the right time yet circumstances and bad choices getting in the way so beautifully, it just hits you right to the corei’ve never personally experienced anything george and primo have, at least not to that degree, but they made me feel like i carried george’s burden and felt the guilt primo felt the entire time  these characters are just work of fiction yet they feel SO real, i honestly think they’re the most “human” characters ms. cathy g molina has created yet other than popoy and basha, which is already an impressive feat considering how one more chance and ESPECIALLY a second chance depicted the feeling of inadequacy in both marriage and your career.knowing that your s/o could do SO much better than you and it’s just agonizing to watch popoy slowly antagonize the woman he loves as he gets consumed by his own insecurities while basha’s doing her best to fix the damage that’s been donebut anyways to anyone who hasn’t watched the hows of us AND a second chance, 10/10 movies, both tear-jerkers, filipinos are the masters of romance-dramas idc if i’m biased, yes this review is just me singing praises for the director’s writing but ",2023-08-04,4

Hows of Us,"Strictly speaking, probably the best of the Kathniel movies. The one where both put in their most rounded performances, both charming and weighty when necessary. Beyond that, they're supported by much better material than in any of their other films. So much feels authentic and even the silliness of the core concept (dividing a house in half out of spite) feels grounded in a strong emotional reality that it passes by without much resistance from myself. There's also just a lot of interesting visual ideas going on here. Not all of them land perfectly, but I find myself appreciating all of them. In all her best work, Cathy Garcia-Molina has this very strong eye for divisions and framing and how that relates to the characters on screen. Obviously the divided house concept gives her a lot of chance to play with these ideas and generally speaking, they work to the film's benefit more than they detract.Where the film suffers is where it has to bow to the studio tentpole formula. Lengthy travel sequences get included in films like this as a means for the intended audience to live vicariously through the characters. Can't afford to go to The Netherlands? You can at least watch your favorite romcom team go instead. The Netherlands is a beautiful country but the entire subplot around Kathryn's brother and long lost father is just bloat that detracts from the heart of the movie. If this film had simply been contented being a romantic comedy (leaning towards drama), it might have been great. The addition of the family drama weighs it down dreadfully.That being said, it's a good movie.

And in those seven years, it was just one time I told you I was tired. Only once did I ask myself if I could still fight. Only once did I have the courage to tell you how I felt. That I was hurting, that I was losing myself. Just one time, in the many times I could have given up, but I didn’t. But then you only needed one time to give up on us. To leave and not come back.

Hows of Us,"darren and his subplot ruined itfirst half of the film >>> because the second half (the amsterdam arc, specifically) seemed like a different movie.if the amsterdam arc focused more on primo's side (as the film was told from george's point-of-view), rather than the search for george and yohan's father (darren's subplot), the film would be much better and the ending could be ‘more justified.’the only part of that arc that i like is the flower field scene. seeing the tulips was primo's and george's dream together. but things didn't go as planned. same as with life, you don't always get what you wished for but life will always find a way to give you something better or in their case, they became better persons despite the fact that they were unable to reach their dreams together as they had planned.speaking of the flower field scene, i truly wish they had given primo's side equal attention. i believe many viewers failed to notice his depression and suicidal phase. of course, it won't excuse him for what he did, but at least it shows that he didn't do it just because he wants to.overall, thou has lots of iconic lines that became part of philippine pop culture. also one of kathniel's best acting performances—daniel's quiet moments (internal) and kathryn's intense dialogues (external). if not for darren's irrelevant subplot, this will dethrone ‘she's dating the gangster’ as my favorite kathniel film. one of the highest grossing filipino films of all time, without a doubt.“Palibhasa kasi alam na alam mo kung paano ako kunin e. Isang ngiti, isang kanta, isang yakap, isang sorry, wala... Umiikot na ulit ‘yong mundo ko. Tangina, Primo! Matalino akong tao e. Pero pagdating sayo, ewan ko natatanga ako.”",2023-10-16,4

Hows of Us,"Heartbroken…just heartbroken. I hope the break-up news isn’t true. I truly hope this wasn’t their last movie together. Kathniel movies are the reason I went back to school to pursue film. Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla are inspirations to me. These movies mean so much to me. This couple means the world to me. I’ve been beyond devastated after hearing the heavy rumors of the break-up and it really seems to be true. My heart seriously aches so much…I cannot take it. With the new drama surrounding Kathniel, it can be said that “The Hows of Us” is a reflection of real life. Growing apart…making mistakes…the difficulty to forgive in adulthood…too many factors that limit our happiness…too many factors that change the way we love. The first time I watched this a couple of years ago, I was sobbing at the end of the movie. I was already a huge Kathniel fan before I watched this one, so that ending struck me so hard. Overall, the drama, cinematography and music meshes well together. I believe this is seriously a really beautiful film. I love this movie so much. I love Kathniel so much. I will always love Kathniel. As much as I would hope that they aren’t broken up, it’s not up to me to decide what’s best for them. They have helped me get through rough times. I believed in true love because of them. Sometimes, even the best relationships grow apart. Thank you Kathryn Bernardo. Thank you Daniel Padilla. Thank you for being the greatest love team of all time. I will always have a place in my heart for Kathniel. #KathnielForever",2023-11-28,2

Kathniel is one of my fav couple, i adore them so much. I remember when i watched this movie for the first time, i fell in love with them both. i mean, i could easly think that they are couple in real life. Their chemistry is insane, everyone can see it. 11 years and now means nothing? how could this movie becomes real? i watching it again today and i cried so hard. it hits different now, especially when this line comes ""how did you not find a reason to stay?"" it stabbed me to the deepest heart.can you imagine? 11 years they survive, and now they met the final chapter.

Hows of Us,"Baka naaawa lang ako kay Kathryn ngayon kasi look at the date diba... Pero tbh binuhat nila silang lahat, kahit yung wig ni Daniel.Noong nakita ko ito nung 2018, over yung acting niya for me. Sa ikalawang panunuod, may mga mahahalagang performances si Kathryn dito. Mistulang siya ang nakaintindi sa paghihirap at ang naaangkop na kalakasan ni George upang makamit nya ang maayos na buhay.Naway ito na sana ang wakas ng pagdusa ng isang storya, ng pagbuo ng karakter sa pinoy romcoms, para lang mapunan ang negosyo ng love teams.Mas mahusay rin sana ang maiaambag sa kamalayan kung hindi na nagkatuluyan pa si Primo at George. Kay tagal rin niyang nagdusa sa makasariling pag-iisip ni Primo. Naway maging mas malaya pa ang mga ganitong kwento, hindi nahahanay sa ""Prince Charming"" si Maria Clara.Ang sabi ni George, pagod na sya sa grand gestures. Pagod na syang itigil yung mundo niya para kay Primo. Pero sa dulo, malalaking gestures nanaman, may pa-kanta kanta pa. Siyempre isasama niyo siya sa Amsterdam dahil siya nagbayad ng plane tickets. Walang respeto sa hiling ni George na lumayo na siya sa buhay niya. Dahil dito hindi nagsucceed ang pelikula.",2023-11-30,-1

NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM. of course at first, your heart will ache with their absence. there will still be times that it will still hurt, but i swear, it gets better! it is healthier and happier to grow alone instead of staying yourself in a relationship that drains you.love is also about acceptance and letting go. choosing yourself over staying with someone who drags you down is the best form of love that you can give yourself !# shungekz mo talaga, jo !!!!!!",2023-12-30,-1

Hows of Us,"A tale about rekindling the flame in a failed relationship. Watching this movie post-KathNiel breakup feels a bit odd. The love team you grew up watching, starring in several films and series has finally came to an end. Nonetheless, Kathryn’s acting in this film is excellent as usual, but there is something about Daniel which makes his role as Primo seem effortless. Perhaps this may be contributed by his newly-unearthed affair with a certain Blythe?Pero in all seriousness redflag si Daniel and ang moral of the story ay: Don’t date a self-centered musician who always plays the victim!

Hows of Us,"Star Cinema have to stop producing repetitive and mediocre storyline for a romantic-drama/comedy film while using famous love teams to extract money from the audience especially to avid Kathniel fans. first, there are so many side stories such as the medical problem and the daddy issue which i find it unnecessary. i also want to point out the longingness of Darren to his father does not break the social construct of a traditional family and his acting makes it even annoying. second, the part where they go abroad seems forced, just to say that the movie is set in Amsterdam. it is irrelevant and a waste of production's money especially they can use provincial places in our country. third, the friends of Kathryn and Daniel are trying hard to be funny and have no significance to the character development of the protagonists even if Juan Miguel's role makes sense. fourth, the dialogues are too cheesy and have so many ""hugot lines"". fifth, the moral story of this film only taught audiences to be hopless romantic and to endure toxicity in order to save the relationship. the only breakthrough somehow is the absence of third party in the relationship. as well, Kathryn is too good as an actress to play another fragile female character.P.S.pangalawang beses ko na itong napanood at ganun pa rin, inis na inis pa rin talaga sa pekikulang ito. hindi na ulit ako mag-aaksaya ng dalawang oras para dito. mas pipiliin ko na lang ulit panoorin ang SDTG o HLG.",2024-01-08,-1

Hows of Us,"Since the breakup of power couple Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla, it seems like the best thing to do is to have a bittersweet marathon of all their films together. Although the teen romance genre is not typically not my cup of tea, the wife and I was able to watch at least one Kathniel film - which turned out to be their last - The Hows of Us (2018). Directed by the go-to filmmaker when it comes to romantic drama blockbusters, Cathy Garcia-Molina crafted something truly special that would resonate more to the love team's followers five years later.The film revolves around the central characters, George (Kathryn Bernardo) and Primo (Daniel Padilla), a couple whose relationship undergoes a tumultuous journey. The narrative ingeniously navigates through the highs and lows of their love story, exploring themes of commitment, dreams, and the inevitable challenges that life throws at them. The storytelling is compelling, keeping the audience engaged with a mix of heartwarming moments and gut-wrenching conflicts.By letting Bernardo and Padilla portray layered and maturing characters, this project breaks the conventional boundaries of the love team which became widely popular through their numerous rom-com TV serials. The commitment of the two young actors make this work as the story revolves around their truly relatable character arcs. Although the supporting cast could also use deeper exploration, the couple's natural chemistry is the beating heart of this film.It may have leaned more towards traditional romantic comedy/drama elements, but the film's success lies in its passionate execution, especially in terms of narrative exploration and character depth. The actors' real-life love story may have ended, but this film shall remain as a highlight of PH cinema.4.0 OUT OF 5STORY - 0.8EXECUTION - 0.8CHARACTERIZATION - 0.8ENTERTAINMENT VALUE - 0.8LASTING IMPACT - 0.8",2023-12-08,7

Firstly, Kathryn Bernardo ditched the teen idol tag and went full-blown actress – nailed it! There's this scene that screams dramatic superstar. Secondly, it's got this crazy formula that somehow clicks. Imagine all genres crashing like a traffic jam, but hey, it works like magic. Drama, comedy, romance – it's a whole package. Thirdly, it's like a crash course in Filipino values – family vibes, chasing dreams, and growing old with your ride-or-die. Can't get more Filipino than this.

Hows of Us,"*incoming word vomit, i will not reread this to check it the things i say make sense fjsdhfd*I watched this with a loud as-it-happens commentary on the decisions the characters make and I find myself acting like how people usually would advice their friends when they're with a /useless/ partner. I'd say ""LEAVE HIM!"" or ""He isn't worth it!!!"" or ""There are other fish in the sea!!! Better fish!!""But I found myself silently relating a bit too much to Primo as I watched. I know how comforting it is that you know that there's someone rooting for you in what you feel are your darkest times. The only difference is that I live alone, therefore there was no one to see me when my 'functional' mask is off. In a way, it's good to not reveal that to anyone. But at the same, it may have been helpful to have someone like Jo around. (anyway, therapy helps!! you dont need a jowa to save you from yourself HAHA)My favorite part was when Jo opened up about how she felt about their breakup. The choice the scriptwriters made to have Jo angry at the fact that Primo left, rather than the fact that we was a piece of shit on the days leading to their breakup made it clear that she really was rooting for him. That her love for Primo was rooted in something deeper than the idea of what he could offer her. She was simply disappointed that he gave up on what they had when she started to break down as well. I definitely feel like their breakup was necessary. At that point, Jo's hope was the singular thread keeping that relationship intact, and hope can only take so much. So when it wasn't strong, the relationship had to unravel. And it was good that they both grew despite being apart.Did she have to go back to Primo? I don't know. If she didn't, i think it'll go to a ""Past Lives"" type of scenario when they meet each other again in the far far future, except with more contempt.On the subject of passion vs. practicality. I wish I knew the answer. I always always want people to choose passion. But I can't relate because I don't have passion. I simply have a drive to survive. So I go for practicality. But if I had passion like Primo, I understand why he acted the way he did. I always imagine that it must be nice to want something so strongly.Overall, I liked this movie. That red biochem book was one sturdy mf.",2024-02-17,4

They were connected with so many dreams to pursue, yet they also became separated by their own passions and differences in life. However,…",2024-02-18,-1

Hows of Us,"This is like my 6th watch of this movie, to be honest. I enjoy this movie, which is currently my favorite Filipino movie right now. But holy sht, Kathryn Bernardo carried this movie with her own two hands. She deserves so much better. The acting performance of other people ESPECIALLY Darren is the reason why I couldn't rate this even higher. Anyway, I truly enjoyed this movie from start to finish, except when Darren was acting it was kind of cringe, to be honest. Music as well was so good. I remember I watched this when I was in Freshman high school, I didn't tear up but was definitely attached to it when watching it. so yeah, 4 stars.",2024-02-24,8

Kathryn and Juan Miguel Severo carried hard during the first half of the movie. Absolutely banger monologues from them, quotable and cuts deep.

Hows of Us,"The Hows of UsOne of the best KathNiel films for me. It’s one of my feel-good Pinoy movies. I’ve seen it three times, and I just had some realizations about relationships.After rewatching it, I found myself reflecting again on how love can be so complicated. What makes it more meaningful is not just the love itself—but the presence of understanding, respect, and the choice to keep showing up for each other. It’s not always about grand gestures. Sometimes, it’s the quiet assurance, the willingness to stay, and the help you give one another when things get tough that matter the most.Love is not always filled with happy or funny days—there will be real struggles to face. But having a partner who truly gets you, who won’t make you feel like a burden even in your lowest moments—that’s something else. It’s a different kind of feeling when you’re sharing your life with someone who sees your mess and still chooses to stay. That kind of love feels safe. It feels like home.Living together isn’t easy. But what makes it bearable—even beautiful—is when both people make the choice to stay, to fight for the love they share. It should never be one-sided. A relationship thrives when both partners are making an effort. Communication, respect, loyalty, and understanding—these are the pillars that hold love together.Sharing a home means sharing lives, dreams, flaws, and even pain. It’s not just about romance; it’s about commitment. It’s choosing each other every day, even in the midst of exhaustion, misunderstandings, and storms. There will be moments of doubt, words spoken in anger, and days when love feels more like a burden than a comfort—but staying, especially during the storm, is what love truly asks of us.Before entering a lifelong commitment, ask yourself:Are you truly ready to live with someone through the calm and the chaos, the ease and the effort?Are you ready to love, not just in the good times—but especially in the hardest ones?Are you ready to choose them again and again, even when it’s no longer easy?The Hows of Us doesn’t just show us what love looks like—it shows us what it takes. And if you’re with the right person, every hardship turns into something beautiful.",2025-12-05,7

Because I can’t, all I feel is rage and stupidity for George’s side. After going through all of that how can she go back.Napakaunnecessary at forced ng Amsterdam. The reason for going abroad is not even relevant and coherent with the plot of the film. Na para bang gusto lang ng staff and crew na mag abroad.MVP: Mikko ",2025-12-01,11

Alam niya na nasasaktan niya sa George pero wala siyang ginawa. Tsaka nakakainis lang na kailangan niya magkaroon ng ""traumatic experience"" after niya iwan si George na para bang kailangan siya patawarin kasi may masama rin naman siyang pinagdaanan. Ulol! Pwedeng naransan niya yun pero nasaktan niya pa rin si George. Grabeng panggago yan di ko matanggap yung redemption arc niya. Taena rin ni Yohan HAHAHAHAH sarap batukan eh.

Hows of Us,"The How’s of Us captures the kind of relationship that feels real — messy, painful, and full of the quiet moments that make love worth holding onto. Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla deliver their best performances yet; their chemistry is raw and mature, showing what it really means to love someone through the highs and lows.It’s not just a romance — it’s a reflection on growing up, on chasing dreams without losing yourself (or the person you love along the way). The emotions are so grounded that you can’t help but see a bit of yourself in Primo and George.Some scenes hurt to watch, but in the best way possible. The How’s of Us reminds us that sometimes love isn’t about staying the same — it’s about growing together, even when it hurts.",2025-11-10,7

Hows of Us,"Honestly, I don't understand why people are doing those things when they are in love. This is the reason I'm scared to fall kasi I can't do this kind of commitment. I mean loving someone brings you joy, yes, but you can't have only one side of the coin. Love can also make you suffer. Like it did to these two. For years they suffered. Well I guess atleast they make up in the end. But still, I don't think I can do what Jo did, sticking to the person they love even though her dreams are slowly getting out of reach. Maybe I'm just scared but by the gods I would rather be alone than experience such gut wrenching pain. Wala naman po nanakit sakin. I just saw how love can build things but also destroy a lot of things. No hate to those people who love love. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. This movie just showed me the real truth about love. That it's not always nice and loving. And that makes me more scared to try.",2025-10-10,10

Hows of Us,"For the couples drowning in love and survival.Primo (Daniel Padilla) and George (Kathryn Bernardo) are the embodiment of “mahal pero pagod na.” Love alone isn’t enough when dreams and pride collide. The line that cut deepest: “Sawang-sawa na kong magmahal sa ’yo.” It’s cruel, yet so honest. This movie is about the wear and tear of long-term love—the kind that tests your patience and your will to stay.Pero the most painful line for me was George saying:“I needed you to fight for us that night, because I was tired fighting alone.”Ang bigat. Kasi love is supposed to be shared—hindi pwedeng isa lang ang lumalaban. When she said that, it showed how empty and one-sided their relationship had become.For me, George shouldn’t have gone back to Primo. The braver, healthier ending would’ve been choosing herself. Love can’t survive kung ikaw lang ang may hawak ng lubid habang yung isa paulit-ulit na bibitaw. Walking away doesn’t erase the love, but it proves na self-respect and peace are worth more than a history that keeps breaking you. George deserved someone who would fight with her, not leave her fighting alone.",2025-02-05,4

Hows of Us,"Due to I can't find again the movie I was supposed to watch again today because I want to watch movies that was never heard of or already been buried too deep, I decided to use my sister payment to that hideous app (Netflix). Because in years of subscribing to that app, the ones I've always wanted to watch are not in this app and no, I'm not gonna risk my time and waste it by watching their own horrible production films. Crazy that they managed to change their price when they couldn't even give me a quality… you're really just enjoying this app if you're still a koreaboo (at this time), if you're also a Filipino media enjoyer or an Adam Sandler movie enjoyer and thankfully, I'm not one of either of the three. So yeah that app is just being logged in our TV but no one is actually using it unless we have friends coming over. Totally a waste of money I think but my mother is enjoying it I guess…I literally just said what the hell. If I can't always find the movie I wanted to watch then I'm just wasting the consecutive suspensions of classes so yeah fawk it, I will just whatever's on the table. Well, it's not exactly in the table because I still searched in this app what hideous film I would waste my time and something ticks in me that I should watch a Kathniel movie because why not? And then I remembered that this is one of their films that I still haven't watched but knowing how impactful it is to this country, maybe this is the time. You know, I have always been not a fan of Kathniel. I mean, I don't hate them so much like it's not about them. I just don't invest in Filipino media so much because it hurts to admit but we are really bad at everything in here from the movies, televisions, music and everything so that's why I stopped investing in that side. But #trust that whenever there's an issue lying around of course, I'll be there. I'm sorry I'm just a normal Filipino who loves gossip and nosing my butt in other's lives. I remembered back when I was Grade 12, we had a roleplay activity that we had to do in front of us and we had some movie references that we could copy and this movie is one of them. First is, the teacher showed us the scene of Kathryn’s crying in the rain scene and lol I literally take a picture of that and posted in my story and said that this woman really cannot act and all my classmates saw it and laugh about it so that's why one of the best known of me is being a hater of Kathryn Bernardo. And hey! I'm sorry if I was called that . I never wanted it and I never intended to. I was just being honest and I told you that I still haven't watched this movie so watching that scene out of context really brought the wrong and early judgment of me. But this is why I'm changed now that I watched this film. I don't know if I can do it since I still haven't watched all of her films but based on the films that I watched, this really might be her best performance yet. But I wouldn't say the best… I mean she definitely improved maybe because her roles have always been the same for years and this role back then might be the most mature one yet and I really see that. Her character here is one of the best ones she played and one of the best written yet considering this was written by the same director who always gives the same quality of characters for me. There's an attempt here that I really appreciate but I still hope that it could've been more just like the rest of all people. I need her to be bolder, stronger and better. But it's enough I guess if this is actually the story they wanted to portray since the start.I know one thing that we can agree on liking this. The YEARNING. It might be the best love approach that can be shown in the media. And it's rare for me to watch a Filipino movie that the yearning was done right. This is the highlight of the film for me. You can really feel the couple’s chemistry in this movie and I understand and see that considering this is one of this couple's peak years. I was smiling, giggling like a girl and entertained. But it's also annoying to watch now. I think this is really one of the films that can be watched back then but cannot be now. This is their best role yet if we're gonna base it on the chemistry like they're literally just being a couple in here but with a plot. And it's making me mad that they can't be like that off camera now because this man played his role a little too well. Fawk this guy to death like I wish he never finds a stardom again after what he did to their relationship. Everybody is worshiping your relationship like it was a major holiday whenever you're doing something. But you are also the one who ruined it. Men really are ruining everything. Straight men specifically. I like Primo in this movie but I can't bear to see that it was being played by this man.There's still some bad acting in this movie that of course, will never go in Filipino movies. And yes that was you Darren. Question, why is he here?? Seriously. Ah. I remember now. I live in the Philippines where everybody can be anything just because they can! Like just go back being a singer or do something but just please don't ever step foot in the acting industry. I think the gay best friend is doing the bare minimum too, like a little bit overacting for me because I'm a gay bestfriend too or maybe I just didn't like his character in here. I mean it's obvious to me in the start how he didn't want her to be happy and I wouldn't do that to my girl besties. It's not right for me to see Jean Garcia not acting an antagonist because she really solidified her career in those roles. Like why do I kinda need her to slap Primo in here?? The thing is, I wouldn't hate this movie so much because my friend right literally acted like George who is always coming back to her ex and I know a lot of y’all are being hypocrites too because I'm sure as hell you would do the same as George or far worse. I mean that's literally one of the reasons why we don't have proper birth control in our country, right? But I'm glad the quote of “Love is not enough” is being taken seriously now and being the base or references of every couple now because it's always been the right statement for every couple. The ending was a lackluster for me. I mean I literally have to go through their makeup which is too long for me. It is too long just to end it with George seeing Primo’s letter that he hid in the music record which is I still think why'd he have to hide in there. I don't think the finding father plot was out of place but if the results are like that then the whole Amsterdam scene should've been the time where the finally made up and spent each other's lives again together and better. In short, the yearning was too good just to have unsatisfying results. I might say that this was a good choice of movie. This is definitely Kathryn's one of best roles and I hope she continues to improve and I will continue to support her career and wish the downfall of that man on the other hand. I hope she's happy and is eating a good meal everyday. Daniel Padilla, you will burn in hell. I will make sure of that.B Tier2018 Ranked",2025-09-23,-1

Hows of Us,"This movie left my stomach in deep pits. Especially, one of Kathryn Bernardo's best performances, which all the more makes her portrayal of Jo so gut-wrenching and leaves you feeling helpless with her, as he always has to look out for the man he loves. Arguably, one of Daniel Padilla's WORST performances in all of their flicks. I personally believe he should've evoked a much better performance to stand alongside his ex.All in all, my favorite Kathniel movie, but probably the worst ending of all time.",2025-02-07,2

Hows of Us,"The OG! Even though KathNiel are no longer together, I always rewatch their films. As I get older, I realized that Primo doesn't really deserve George. I learned that it is better to leave your love one if it they're not good for you anymore. Mind over heart. George's love for Primo is unconditional. But self love is something you have to build with yourself before entering a RS.",2025-09-17,4

Hows of Us,"If I was George, I would never look back to Primo. I don't want love if it costs me my dreams. Pangarap ko yon. I don't want a life full of what ifs when I get old. Ano naman kung hindi ako mayayakap ng diploma ko sa gabi? It's a proof of my hard earned blood, sweat, and tears or even more. Ang pagmamahal ay hindi ako nananakawan ng pangarap. I get Primo's, though. He's supposed to have his breakthrough but he chose Jo. Pero ayoko mapunta sa point na papasanin ko lahat. What is it for that we are called partners, right?",2025-09-16,-1

Hows of Us,hindi na dapat bumalik si george kay primo tuldokt,2025-09-16,15
Hows of Us,I think compared to one more chance this one like kiiiiiinda like made me almost like the guy after the first hour. He was PMO cuz he was so intentionally dense when returning and I hate the trope of “I care abt u but I can’t express it so I’m gonna annoy you till you and ride off our previous relationship” I’m like  but I did feel like his redepmtion was lowk believeable by the end of the movie like he really did lock in once her brother started having health complications and just accepted they wouldn’t get back together and openly tried to help her respectfully out of his objective love for her regardless of the outcome. Still a pdrama still PMO in the early act but this one felt liek kinda good,2025-09-16,4
Hows of Us,guilty pleasure ko ‘to and a constant reminder to myself na lalaki ang sisira ng buhay ko,2025-09-15,-1
Hows of Us,"sobbed the entire movie. actually shows that relationships isn’t all rainbows and sunshine. Felt really, really bad for George though. Primo was incredibly immature for leaving by the only time George needed someone to listen to her because of the issues they’ve been carrying because Primo couldn’t let go of his passion that was obviously failing. I’m not saying that this movie was bad because of Primo’s actions, without the way he acted in the beginning the movie itself wouldn’t exist or progress anywhere. I’m actually pretty happy and I found it sweet that Primo was willing to help George and her family out. Shows that he deeply did care for her, he always has but was incredibly selfish during the time he left. They both had their issues. They both changed into better people with the love and care that still stuck onto them.",2025-09-14,4

Hows of Us,Gets na gets ko galit ni kath dito kahit sino naman yata. Nakakaiyak talaga yung part ni daniel na gusto lang naman nya sundan passion niya—pangarap niya para sa kanilang dalawa. Ang masaklap lang bumitaw sila pero one thing I learned in this movie is if you really love someone you have to let them go in order for them to grow.  this one struck my heart so so much,2025-09-05,11
Hows of Us,"Manipulative tong movie pero hindi ko pa rin masabi na pangit sya. Effective sya e, nadala pa rin ako ng mga eksena, galit na galit pa rin ako kay George. Kulang siguro to ng second lead, ng magpapakita sa kanya (kay George) how the grass is greener on the other side para kapag pinili nya pa rin si Primo, tangang-tanga na talaga siya. O wala sigurong kulang, baka marami lang labis. Baka sa loob nito, may tight 90-minute movie na walang masyadong family drama on both sides but this is the version that ultimately exists. Sayang pamasahe papuntang Amsterdam jusko nababadtrip lang ako.",2025-09-05,6

Hows of Us,"It’s the first time I’m writing a review for a romance movie, although I do actually watch some. This one hits different when it comes to love. The way they portrayed the characters, it’s just bitter yet sweet. My favorite scene is when they were outside during the rain—Joy’s dialogue is what you’d feel the most. She was giving her pieces one by one to her love, so she was left with nothing in the end. Despite that, Primo actually received nothing, because people do not get the ability to receive that. Only to suck it up. Both of them were drained and sad and lost.For Primo’s side, he was really a good man. Although for the scenes that he was facing bad things, he didn’t deserve Joy nor anything from her. I pitied him. But it doesn’t mean that Joy should feel that, too. That’s why when they got away from each other, it was probably to find themselves. That’s how I liked The Hows of Us. The ending is up to you, actually. Whether they ended up together or just friends. The only thing I hope is for them to be happy.",2025-08-17,9

Like, what’s the point if you’re always putting them first, tapos ikaw, you forget your own needs, your goals, your peace just to keep them? That’s not love. That’s self-abandonment.

Hows of Us,"loved the delivery of the exposition, lalo na yung direct parallels from when they were still together to 2 years after the breakup. very similar in style sa starting over again, which is fave ko. what i really loved about this movie aside from the characters is the pacing, manner of narration, and the way it portrayed how jo lost her resolve and resistance against primo, kasi relatable pa rin kahit na nakakainis at nakakairita na yung katangahan ni george. matalino naman talaga siya pero i think ang problema sa kanya is masyado niyang sineryoso ang feelings na nagresurface noong bumalik si primo, in short, masyadong marupok! remember, hindi lahat ng emotion na nararamdaman natin sa katawan ay reliable. we should never make decisions based on our feelings alone, dapat may balance between objective fact/reality and what we feel. totoo na mahal pa rin ni george si primo, pero at the same time, malaki ang kasalanan at trauma na nacause ni primo kay george, kaya hindi dapat nagpadala si george sa feelings niya at bumalik kay primo. what they need from each other is sincere apology with accountability and closure, hindi comeback. hindi deserve ni george na magstay sa taong katulad ni primo. george deserves so much better, and not the ""better"" that primo has to offer.",2025-08-01,-1

Hows of Us,"This one hurt differently— not in the loud, heart-wrenching way some love stories do, but in that slow ache of staying too long. Of loving past the expiration date. Of fighting for something that no longer knows how to fight back.George and Primo weren’t star-crossed or tragic in the classic sense. They were real. Exhausted. Stubborn. Still soft for each other beneath the bruises of all those unfinished conversations. And maybe that’s what made it worse— their love didn’t end with anger. It ended with the weight of trying. Again and again. And again.I didn’t cry at the big scenes.I cried when she stared at him from across the room and didn’t know what to say.I cried at the way he said “pangarap” like it used to mean us, and now it only means me.The film didn’t scream. It simmered. It dragged me through the quiet cruelties of outgrowing someone you still care for. It reminded me of the version of myself I stayed with too long. The promises we tried to keep when our hearts had already started packing.And yet— somehow— it wasn’t hopeless. It was sad, but not bitter. That’s harder to write. That’s harder to feel.It whispered,“You loved. You outgrew. You survived.”And sometimes, that’s the most devastating line of all.This film felt like a letter you never sent. The kind that sits in your notes app. Half bitter. Half soft. Fully human.If you’ve ever loved someone deeply and had to choose yourself anyway— this one will sting. Gently.",2025-07-26,4

Hows of Us,"""The Hows of Us” isn’t your usual dreamy, rom-com na may happy-ever-after agad. It digs deeper—sobrang sakit, sobrang real. This movie shows na kahit gaano kalalim ang pagmamahalan n'yo, minsan, hindi ‘yon sapat para manatili. George and Primo’s story hits hard kasi hindi ito tungkol sa how they met, kundi sa how they survived... or didn’t.Pero ang ganda ng mga songs dito ha, damang-dama.It’s about love that starts with so much fire but slowly fades into frustration, broken dreams, and too many “sorrys.” Yung mga “I love you” na eventually napalitan ng “Pagod na ako.” Yung tipong mahal mo pa, pero pagod ka na. At ‘di ba, that’s one of the worst kinds of heartbreak?Kathryn nailed it with her raw, painful delivery—lalo na sa scene kung saan sinasabi niya kung gaano siya naghihintay na lumaban si Primo.""How did you not found a reason stay?""""And what makes your sorry different from all your sorry before?""Ang ganda rin ng message ng film: Love isn’t always magical. Minsan, love is staying, choosing, and fixing—kahit ang hirap-hirap na.Tho nawala lang yung gana ko kasi bakit ganon na lang uli naging soft si George kay Primo? 7 years siyang nawala and parang tinanggap niya lang uli as if 1 week silang nag-away? Hindi man lang pinahirapan yang si Primo kahit na gusto niya pa, sinubukan niya man lang sana na i-challenge para mas masukat kung totoo na ba talaga yung pinapakita niya. Pero okay bumawi naman siya sa pagtulong kay Yohan.",2025-07-24,7

Hows of Us,"this movie had a lot of potential to resonate even more however it stays as potential.it started off so strong until it expands through unnecessary stuff when the messages and themes could easily be done in a more cohesive way. it strayed off from being grounded to the typical romcom filo film which robbed it from its potential to be even more hard-hitting.Kathryn was a definite highlight, portraying the convoluted yet true experience of exhaustion and frustration but somehow, still having feelings of love.the overall message of the movie is definitely something you don’t take at face value. it requires an understanding of the different complex parts of ourselves and our emotions that play into a relationship working out or not.",2025-07-25,2

Hows of Us,"both sides were valid for me …. lahat tayo ay napapagod pero we are either made from it or broken from it. si george ang isang halimbawa ng mga taong ieendure talaga ang lahat-lahat para sa pag-ibig. it was supposedly her desirable trait until she was broken from it bit by bit. sa sobrang pag-uuna niya sa mga taong mahal niya, nakalimutan niyang magtira para sa sarili niya  inuna niya ang pag-ibig kaysa sa pangaraphabang si primo naman … inuna ang pangarap bago ang pag-ibig, at ayon ang ikinasira niya. it does hurt when your passion is not appreciated enough, at alam niyang nahihirapan din si george sakanya. it never meant he loved george less, he was just passion-driven, and that is never wrong. ang mali lang niya ay nagkulang siya para ipakita yon kay georgeeither way — love will either blind or wake us from reality. we do things out of spite for love even in the least expected times that we will. ibubuhos ang buong kaluluwa at pagkatao para sa taong mahal natin — but too much of something never ends well.",2025-07-04,-1
Hows of Us,"“in order to win a war, you have to stay together.”that line hit hard because love isn’t about avoiding conflict, it’s about choosing to stay even when it’s hard. the hows of us reminded me that real love isn’t always romantic or dreamy. it’s work, patience, and showing up even when it hurts.what stood out to me was kung gano kadali sumuko when things get painful, and how rare it is to hold on. but sometimes, like the film said, all we need is a little patience.some relationships need space to grow. others grow best together. and figuring that out is part of the journey.i learned that love means constantly choosing each other. not just when it’s easy, but especially when it’s not. facing the problem together, talking, being tired together, resting when needed. that’s what makes love last.i hope one day i find a kind of love that feels safe, honest, and patient. and i hope that kind of love finds me, too.",2025-07-04,10

Hows of Us,"This film was okay. Cathy's movies just really have a track record for being cheater and manipulator apologists. Darren's character is one of the flaws. Not sure if it was his execution or bad writing but his 17 yo character acts like a 9 yo on some occasions, which I find weird. George's friends are lowkey annoying too. The plot was all over the place- lots of things don't make sense (eg. tita lola entrusting Primo to the house, the Amsterdam storyline, etc.)The acting, however, was very powerful here. Kathryn's delivery was very raw. Daniel improved so much. He's not that on par with Kath still imo, but not too bad.",2025-06-28,-1

Hows of Us,"The House of Us is a quiet kind of heartbreak. It tells the story of two people who once shared the same dreams but slowly drifted apart. It is not the loud kind of love. It is the kind that stays even when things get hard. The kind that gets tired but never fully disappears.It shows how love can be full of promises, but life can still find a way to test every one of them. They love each other deeply, but they are no longer the same people who started the journey. And that is what hurts the most. Watching two people hold on while slowly breaking inside.The film reminds you of the love you once believed would last forever. The kind that felt like home. And when that love starts to fall apart, it does not shatter all at once. It fades. Quietly. Painfully. And yet, in all the breaking, there is still hope. Hope that love, when chosen again, can still heal. Even if nothing is the same anymore.",2025-06-30,7

Hows of Us,"The Hows of Us felt to me like a simple, yet not shallow romantic melodrama. It sits somewhere between emotional depth and surface-level storytelling, focusing on a couple navigating love, breakup, and reconciliation.The screenplay was simple but had an almost episodic feel to it, i wasn't annoyed by it though and actually enjoyed some of the sequences as well.The humor was a mix of slightly cringeworthy moments and genuinely funny ones.The romance, both in its joyful and sorrowful moments had a mixture of both melodramatic, over the top yet funny moments, dialogues that felt like lied between borderline cringe and genuinely touching and effectively playful at times as well The chemistry between the leads stood out. I liked them as a couple, and both gave good performances, the lady, maybe, more than the male lead, since the writers did give her a bit more importance with backstory, depth and dialogues and so the actress had more to work with in here.The Amsterdam scene was the only one that felt a little unnecessary. Even though it added depth to both characters, especially George and featured the important flower field moments, and the detailing regarding her wish to watch tulips and all, there was still something about it that felt out of place. And yeah, i guess, it was the location change that might've made me think that way.",2025-06-11,7

It shows that being in a relationship is not all about ""love"", ""spark"", and ""kilig"" There are times that you'll have a fight and you'll just throw hurtful words at each other. Not all the time it's all about love, but it's all about sacrifices and devotion .

Hows of Us,"""I needed for you to fight for us that night because I was so tired fighting alone""Napa what if nalang talaga ako sa part na what if George read the letter in the vinyl record on her birthday? Would it change the trajectory of their story? Would it be enough to convince her to continue fighting even though she's drained and exhausted of everything? Would they still be together? And if she did, would it be worth it? But I also realized that it's good narin na hindi niya nabasa kasi after ending things with Primo, she had a better life. Kahit mahirap at masakit para sa kanya. This made me realize that sometimes you have to lose what you thought you needed in order to make space for what you truly deserve.Maraming pagkakamali si Primo, and of course may mali din si George. Lalo na sa part na she has all the reason to walk away and leave Primo before, but she just can't kasi sobrang mahal niya. It's not her fault for loving someone at their worst. Pero sana hindi niya kinalimutan yung self worth niya. Nakakahinayang lang talaga yung years na nasayang niya taking care of Primo only to end up sacrificing her opportunity to become a doctor This reminded me that you can love someone with all your heart but do not forget your own worth in the process. You don't have to shrink your worth just to fit someone else's comfort or expectation. Girl, you do you! Ang pinaka takeaway ko sa movie na 'to is to choose wisely between love and life's priorities. Know when to stop and walk away kasi walking away is not just about giving up on love, but choosing to honor your worth and the future you've worked so hard for. Also, hindi ibigsabihin na may natapos ay tapos na. The end is just the beginning of something better. To my girlies, I hope we won't experience what George had gone through. I hope we don't meet the Primo in our life that will make us choose between love or career. I hope we get the love that we truly deserve. ",2025-05-18,-1

""in train, you have to stop in your destination before the pay gets too high"".Dreams is not non-negotiable. May this lovestory never find me",2025-05-11,10

Primo was so fucked up. i hate him, tbh. but i know that people like him exists (u know i love real life situation movies). that no matter how hard you try, no matter how heavy the guilt is, there is just something that limits you from going forward in life. Primo needed that time and a big slap of reality just to get him to do something with his life. i hate him but i know that if i were him, i will understand why he's like that. and to George, i understand her coming back. actually, it's okay. life is just like that. not just because we witnessed their situation, we also know what they are feeling. so i get her. all her sacrifices, i get it. some people just do that just for love. i know that not all people will understand that situation nor will do the same. but for me, i get her.",2025-03-08,2

Hows of Us,"Watching this was an experience that truly stayed with me  I remember settling in for the film, not knowing that it would stir up so many emotions and memories of my own ups and downs in love. From the very first scene, the realistic portrayal of a relationship’s joys and struggles pulled me into a world that felt both familiar and profoundly moving.What struck me most was the film’s honest depiction of the challenges that come with deep, enduring love. The story isn’t about a perfect romance; it’s about real-life conflicts, sacrifices, and the bittersweet moments that define our relationships. I found myself recalling personal experiences times when love meant both elation and heartache and this connection made the film’s narrative all the more powerful.The chemistry between KathNiel was undeniable  Their performances felt genuine, conveying the vulnerability and intensity of their characters’ journey. I was particularly touched by how their expressions and subtle gestures spoke volumes, often more than the dialogue could. It’s rare for a film to make you feel as if you’re living the characters’ experiences alongside them, and that’s something I felt deeply throughout the movie (I just want to mention this so bad ) Beyond the romance and drama, this prompted me to reflect on my own relationships. There were moments of quiet introspection scenes where the characters faced their inner battles and external pressures that resonated with me personally. The film’s pacing allowed for these moments to sink in, making the experience both cathartic and thought provoking.The cinematography was evident in every frame  The visual storytelling, from intimate close ups to sweeping shots of the setting, created an immersive atmosphere. I appreciated how the film balanced its dramatic highs with more tender, reflective scenes, offering a nuanced look at what it means to love and to let go.In the end I just want to say, AY LAB IT SO MUCH!  The Hows of Us isn’t just a love story it’s a reminder of the complexities and realities of life. It left me with a sense of nostalgia and a deeper appreciation for the unpredictable nature of relationships. (which I don’t feel much anymore ‘cuz I just expect the worse) For anyone who has ever loved, lost, or simply wondered about the true nature of connection, THIS FILM IS DEF A MUST WATCH!

Hows of Us,"Reflection on The House of Us (2018)The 2018 Filipino film The House of Us, is an emotionally stirring drama that explores love, dreams, and the struggle to hold onto relationships despite life’s hardships. The movie follows the story of Primo (Daniel Padilla) and George (Kathryn Bernardo), a couple whose relationship is tested by ambition, miscommunication, and the harsh realities of life. Watching this film was a deeply emotional experience, as it delved into themes that felt incredibly real and relatable. It made me reflect on the complexities of love and the sacrifices that people make to sustain their relationships.One of the most striking aspects of The House of Us is how it captures the essence of Filipino relationships and family dynamics. The plot feels deeply Filipino because of its emphasis on love as not just an emotion but also a responsibility. Many Filipinos will see themselves in George and Primo characters who represent different perspectives on dreams and commitment. The film also highlights the idea of bahay, or home, as not just a physical structure but a place built through shared experiences and struggles. This theme resonates strongly with Filipino audiences, as family and home play a crucial role in Filipino culture. The sacrifices made by George and her struggle to balance love with self-respect mirror the reality of many Filipinos who navigate relationships while trying to improve their circumstances.The film also appears to reference other works in the romance and drama genre, particularly in how it presents its narrative and themes. For instance, it shares similarities with One More Chance (2007), another Filipino film that explores second chances in love and the consequences of choices in a relationship. Like One More Chance, The House of Us portrays raw emotions and the difficult path toward forgiveness and reconciliation. Additionally, it takes inspiration from classic romance tropes found in both literature and film, such as the idea of lovers growing apart due to personal ambitions but later finding a way to reconnect. These references are used effectively to enhance the film’s storytelling, making it feel familiar yet fresh.",2025-02-28,7

The second time was not the same knowing they are not already together. It's more on ""sayang naman"" but I still admire them as an artist. The Filipino culture that I noticed is that George grandmother gave them a house for them to live when they already have a family. Since in us filipinos once you introduce your boyfriend/girlfriend in your family, that means he/she is the man/woman you'll marry for we are conservative not unlike in other countries which they are more liberated. When it comes to relationship, what happened to george and primo actually happens in real life relationship. There will be a time where we will be tired, where we need to choose between our dreams or him, and where we need to let go for the sake of ourself.

Hows of Us,"‘The Hows of Us’ is a 2018 Filipino romantic drama directed by Cathy Garcia-Molina, starring Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla. As the movie goes, we follow Primo and George, a couple who dreamed of building a life together but struggled with the realities of love, career aspirations, and personal growth. As their relationship faces a lot of challenges along with their career progress, they must decide whether to keep fighting for their love or let go for their own individual happiness. The movie offers a deep and emotional look into love, sacrifices, and the struggles of young couples trying to build life together.The movie brought a mix of emotions, joy, frustration, heartbreak, and hope. It was easy to connect with the struggles of Primo and George, making their story feel real and authentic. There were moments of kilig (romantic excitement), especially in the early stages of their relationship, but as they grew together conflicts arose, I felt the pain and frustration of their struggles. The film’s emotional depth made it hard not to sympathize with both characters, especially George, who had to make difficult choices for her standing in the relationship and the stake of her future. The ending will leave you with an emotional strain that is bittersweet yet satisfying impact.Their dialogue felt natural and realistic, blending Filipino and English like everyday conversations. Their emotional exchanges, especially during conflicts, made them more authentic and relatable. The movie reflects Filipino culture through family values, sacrifices, and dreams. The setting, character names, and struggles with career and relationships make it deeply relatable to Filipino audiences. For me, a ‘Hugot’ refers to heartfelt deep feelings of emotional lines drawn from personal experiences. A memorable hugot line from the movie is when George said to Primo“Matalino akong tao eh! Pero ba’t pagdating sayo? Ba’t sayo ang tanga-tanga ko.” This captures the vulnerability of a person to love that she feels smart in life but weak when it comes to her own emotions.In conclusion, ‘The Hows of Us’ is more than just a film, it is a reflection of real-life relationships and the challenges that come with love and personal growth. The emotions it expresses, the realistic dialogues, and the distinctly Filipino elements make it a compelling and heartfelt movie. It beautifully captures the essence of hugot, making it relatable to anyone who has experienced love and heartbreak. The film serves as a reminder for all of us that when loving someone, no matter how deep, and you want to fight it out, understand that and sometimes, letting go to something will truly grow.",2025-02-27,7

The movie's ability to rapidly shift emotions is a testament to its storytelling effectiveness, as it delves into the intricate complexities of relationships and the profound emotional struggles of its characters. This resonates deeply with Filipinos, who are renowned for their strong family bonds and expressive nature.The film's conclusion, while satisfying, left me empathizing with George's reaction. It's challenging to internalize emotions when others expect you to remain composed and manage your daily life without showing any signs of distress. This societal expectation can be overwhelming, as it pressures individuals to maintain a facade of being okay, even when they're struggling to cope with their emotions. The movie highlights this struggle, making it relatable and thought-provoking for viewers.",2025-02-27,7

Of course, blinded by the reality they are set in and not thinking outside the boxAlso Darren, of course it's DarrenLet's say... There a huge room of improvement that he needs to properly execute the role he is supposed to perform....But still, this somehow kinds tearjerker type of romance is still commendable, given how some situations does apply in real life and people will understand the situations themselvesBut, they still need improvement if i say so myselfI can expect what will happen in the plot itself and how it will resolveLet's say, it's cliched",2025-02-26,-1

Hows of Us,"It’s a great movie, but I didn’t like it. I get the message that maturity is needed for a relationship to work, but do I think Primo is a good match for George? Absolutely not. I understand that time can help us grow, but do you really need growth to realize you’ve ruined your partner's career and become a burden while they sacrifice everything just to meet your basic needs? Even after Primo came back, he needed another breakdown from George to realize the damage he caused couldn’t be fixed with sweet gestures or “pa-pogi” moments. No relationship is perfect, but the situations here were a little difficult for me, and it lacked empathy until the very end. That was a huge red flag. George deserved better!!!also, the ending was so cliché, I wanted George to choose herself and focus on her own growth instead of returning to Primo. She had so much potential on her own, and the movie missed that opportunity. I think they’re better off apart, because sometimes maturity is realizing the person you love might be better off without you. I wish they had stayed on good terms instead of jumping back into a relationship. They should’ve taken it slow. The ending really didn’t sit right with me huhu – again, George deserved better as for my additional prompts, I don’t think romance films are a waste if the leads don’t end up together. A good film is about character growth, not just staying together. Sometimes, not being together is the more mature choice. In *The Hows of Us*, I think it would’ve been better if George didn’t go back to Primo. Their personal growth was more important than just a happy ending. So, no, the movie wasn’t a waste of time for me  there are scenes naman na nakakakilig kaya worth the watch parin ",2025-02-26,4
Hows of Us,"I chose to watch ""The Hows of Us"" by KathNiel because it shows the reality that not all relationships are happy and exciting. This movie is a literal portrayal of Filipino culture, where people pour their hearts out to their partners even if they're exhausted, offering their full support. But there comes a time when it gets tiring. There’s a scene that make me laugh because in real life, we have friends who will tell you an advice like “ beh, iwan mo na yan wag mong sayangin sarili mo jan” hahahahaha shempre you're so marupok, you won't listen. The lesson you get from this movie is that you need balance in love. Give yourself time and love, and do the same for your partner and the people in your life. Make yourself a priority because you can't truly support others if you're lacking in yourself. It's literally in our culture to love fiercely even when it's hard. When it comes to the actors, KathNiel did a solid job conveying real emotions and scenes. It was easy to understand. In the end, they were happy and moved on, literally turning a new page in their love story.# kathnielplskambak",2025-02-26,7

It shows the challenges that come with love and how it isn't always perfect, but with effort, relationships can grow stronger.One of the most Filipino things in the movie is the constant tug between career aspirations and family responsibilities. In Filipino culture, there’s often pressure to take care of family, and that can sometimes affect personal dreams. This is shown in the movie, where George has to make decisions about her future, while Primo also faces challenges in his own career. It's a situation many Filipino families can relate to because of the importance of close family ties.Overall, it's a heartfelt, emotional film that highlights the Filipino experience of balancing love, career, and family.

Hows of Us,"The Hows of Us* (2018) is an affecting study in love, sacrifice, and the trials of maturing together—or apart—through time. Directed by Cathy Garcia-Molina and starring Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla, the film tracks Primo and George, a couple whose erstwhile brilliant future is gradually extinguished by ambition, disillusionment, and the harsh realities of adulthood.What is particularly Filipino about *The Hows of Us* is its visceral emotional center, one that speaks to the very notion of *hugot*—that bare, gut-level pull of emotion oftentimes associated with individual histories of love and heartbreak. Primo's quest for his ambitions, with George lugging the burden of prudence, reflects a common Filipino dynamic in which aspiration and responsibility tend to war against one another. The fact that *pamilya* is an important consideration in their choices also makes the story more rooted in Filipino culture, reaffirming the way that love is seldom just between two individuals, but wrapped up in family obligations. The movie also toys with the concept of *sayang*—that aching, lingering sorrow when love fails because of everything. Although *The Hows of Us* provides closure, it dwells on the heartache of nearly losing someone, so it is understandable to anyone who has ever clung to love a little too long. It does not merely pose the question of whether love is worth fighting for, but whether love by itself is ever sufficient.Would the life of Primo and George have been the same if they were not in the Philippines? Maybe not. The cultural significance of *kapit* (holding on), *tiis* (patience), and the anticipation of *pagtatagal* (enduring love) influence their journey. Deep down, *The Hows of Us* is not simply a love story—it is a testament to what it is to love as a Filipino.",2025-02-26,7

Hows of Us,"I have already watched this movie multiple times, from cinema to netflix, yet it does not change the excitement and kilig I feel everytime I watch it. The kilig when Primo & George's relationship was just starting, the happiness I felt with them when their relationship worked for years, and also the anger when things started to go downhill and Primo chose to be selfish, self-centered, immature and impractical with the decisions he made which greatly affected George's mental health and career because she put Primo on top of her priority, especially over her exam. Truly, love can make people do crazy things, not thinking and considering the consequences that comes with it. The movie also portrayed the importance of maintaining the teamwork in the relationship, the ""doing things together"" even with the smallest thing. Most importantly, the show is an eye opener of the beauty of growing, even if it means the need of growing apart. The beauty of exploring life outside your comfort zone, facing your fears and conquering what the world has for you outside your shell. After all, if things are really meant to happen, no matter how many turns, delays or challenges you both face in life, fate will have its own way of bringing you back to each other's life. At that time, you both are grown up, able to make decisions that also considers your partner and has a different perspectives in life, making you love each other in the right way—the way you both deserve to love and to be loved. Just like how fate brought back Primo and George together after years of not having communication, both shared different life realizations and lessons that made them who they were when they met again. One thing just did not change after years of being apart, the fact that they will always be the missing part of each other, the one that will complete the empty and dull space of their lives.",2025-02-26,4
Hows of Us,"""The Hows of Us"" is a poignant exploration of love, sacrifice, and the complexities of sustaining a long-term relationship.

Hows of Us,"""The Hows of Us"" pinatunayan sa atin na walang patutunguhan ang isang relasyon kung may isa sa inyo ang makasarili. Primo is egotistical, too ambitious, and self-centered. I understand; he wants to provide for their future and be successful, but in the end, he loses. He had forgotten the concept of relationship. He was so focused on his ambition that he forgot he had a partner who needed him.Conversely, George shows that when a woman falls in love, she is prepared to jeopardize everything to validate her worthiness.Every relationship has its own unique set of stories, problems, and dreams. However, we all know that we all desire the same ending: ""Happily ever after"". LOVE is more than just passion or practicality; it is about mutual respect, understanding, and compromise. Primo becomes more open and supportive of George's artistic ambitions, seeing that her dreams are an integral part of who she is. He learns to be more open about his personal needs and worries, rather than focusing solely on providing for their future.George, in turn, learns to understand that partnerships involve effort, and that love is more than just beautiful gestures; it is also about overcoming obstacles together. She understands that they may still dream together, but they must learn to compromise and talk openly. In the film's last minutes, they are seen heading forward together, hand in hand, with a fresh sense of dedication to one other.

Directed by Cathy Garcia-Molina and starring Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla, the film follows the journey of Primo and George—two young lovers whose relationship is tested by ambition, failure, and personal growth.One of the strongest aspects of the film is how Filipino it feels, from its themes of family expectations to the struggle of chasing dreams while maintaining relationships. Primo, an aspiring musician, embodies the passion and persistence of many Filipinos pursuing creative careers, while George represents the pragmatic side—someone who wants stability and security in life.

Hows of Us,"""The Hows of Us"" is a beautifully written film that takes viewers on an emotional rollercoaster. I appreciate how realistically it portrays a love that isn't always perfect; it shows a relationship enduring difficulties.The film's Filipino essence is embodied in George's unwavering support for Primo. She silently bears the weight of their struggles, believing in his potential for success. Despite her exhaustion, she remains supportive, only voicing her burden when she can no longer endure it. Her immense sacrifice exemplifies the Filipino concept of ""tanga sa pag-ibig"", yet her actions are entirely understandable, stemming from her deep love and faith in Primo.I loved how each character's growth leads to self-discovery, particularly Primo's understanding of sacrifice and his ability to overcome his pride.Primo and George's journey isn't perfect; it demands significant sacrifices and overcoming numerous challenges. Nonetheless, the film emphasizes the importance of individual and couple growth. It teaches us that relationships don't stifle dreams; rather, shared dreams foster growth.

Also, the most popular thing that had the Filipinos was music. This story of George and primo gives the reality that the couple can experience along their relationships, the tiredness to continue to go on.

Hows of Us,"After re-watching this movie (the hows of us), I resonated in so many ways. This movie is a reflection on personal growth, the need for compromise, and sometimes painful process of maturing within a relationship. I think Kathryn especially owned this film after showcasing such true and raw emotions whenever there are those bawling scenes with Daniel that was either because of happiness, anger or grief. And Daniel somehow became less of the typical cool and proud character he has portrayed in the past and he showed that he can also shine in his quiet, turned well-mannered character who isn’t argumentative or proud.The portrayal of George and Primo’s love has not been grand. In fact, the turn of events in their love story were unflattering. There’s nothing to be proud of when your boyfriend is broke but still can’t swallow his pride because he is too inflexible to do something else aside from his music. There’s nothing to be proud of that George is devoted to a person who kept proving to her and to other people that he’s just a no good. It’s hard that they’ve reached the ultimate slump in their relationship and they have to realize that it’s no longer healthy to stay in that relationship. Most definitely, it is silly and true for us humans, that we only find ourselves and make time to right our wrongs when we’ve lost the most important thing in our lives.As for the hugot, I can't forget when Kat said ""Pagod na pagod na pagod na pagod na ko"", we all feel this whenever we feel that we're the only one who carries the relationship. The movie shines in its portrayal of the struggles that come with balancing love and ambition, and it underscores the reality that love may not always be enough if you don’t grow together as individuals.",2025-02-26,2

Not all relationships last forever. even though George and primo still love each other, sometimes letting go is the best choice for both people, after all their struggles found each other again at the right time, like for everyone we should not rush love. if something is meant for us, it will come at the right time. this movie teaches us that love should help us grow, not hold us back, its okay to love someone but we should never lose ourselves in the process.",2025-02-26,-1
Hows of Us,"""The Hows of Us"" is such an amazing and inspiring movie that I would recommend to everyone. It clearly shows the strength of love despite life's challenges, showing that love endures, especially for those we cherish most. Therefore, we must learn to understand one another, as understanding is the ultimate strategy for successful and healthy relationships. Reflecting on the film, both characters ultimately realize the mistakes of their judgments. The girl didn't understand what the boy was going through in his family (he was compared to his other siblings with a descent jobs, unlike him. Making him the person he didn't want to be). While the boy failed to deeply understand and consider the girl's feelings (He reacted to her words without fully understanding them more deeply). The film highlights the importance of communication, offering insight into the characters' struggles and emphasizing the need for mutual support to overcome life's ups and downs. We must remember that we need each other's support, and no one can provide that better than someone who truly understands us. No matter what happens, always communicate, consider each other's feelings, don't give up easily, and it's okay to rest, but not to give up. This film is a beautiful filipino masterpiece, showcasing that love can last if both partners understand each other and always choose to find solutions instead of giving up. It realistically portrays love's challenges, and its Filipino perspective, where it highlights that love isn't just about romance; it involves choosing between personal dreams and commitment to a loved one. The sacrifices made, the perseverance shown—these are hallmarks of the Filipino spirit, making this film a truly recognizable and resonant portrayal of Filipino life and values.",2025-02-26,7
Hows of Us,"Reflection on The Hows of UsThe Hows of Us is a deeply emotional film that resonated with me on many levels. It made me feel a mix of sadness, hope, and pride, as it told a story of love and perseverance that felt both universal and uniquely Filipino. The struggles of George and Primo, balancing love with personal growth and ambition, struck a chord because they reflect real-life challenges many young couples face, especially in the Philippines.What makes the movie distinctly Filipino is its emphasis on family, sacrifice, and resilience. George’s deep sense of responsibility, not just for herself but for her shared dreams with Primo, mirrors the Filipino value of bayanihan or communal support. The setting, with its familiar homes, vibrant streets, and local culture, immediately evokes the everyday life of many Filipinos. Even the characters’ names, George and Primo, feel relatable and authentic, reflecting how Filipino names often carry simplicity and charm.The way the characters look and speak also feels Filipino. Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla embody a natural, down-to-earth aesthetic that resonates with Filipino audiences. Their dialogue, filled with a mix of English and Filipino (Taglish), reflects how many Filipinos communicate. The humor, the dramatic expressions, and even the moments of silence between them capture the essence of how Filipinos connect and express themselves in relationships.The plot itself feels inherently Filipino because it revolves around themes of sacrifice, enduring hardship, and chasing dreams despite adversity. Primo’s struggle to pursue his passion for music, even as it strains his relationship with George, reflects the Filipino spirit of pangarap (dreaming big) and the tension it creates within relationships and families. George’s ultimate decision to prioritize herself is a powerful message about self-love, but it is also rooted in the idea that love requires strength and compromise—values deeply embedded in Filipino culture.This story couldn’t have unfolded the same way if the characters weren’t Filipino. The cultural backdrop, their ways of handling conflict, and their resilience are shaped by the Filipino way of life. The characters’ dreams, their struggles with finances, and their deep connections to family and tradition are experiences many Filipinos can relate to.The film also nods to other works in Filipino cinema, especially the tradition of romantic dramas that deal with heartbreak and redemption. Its themes are universal, yet the Filipino flavor in its storytelling, dialogue, and values make it stand out. On the other hand, The Hows of Us has become iconic in itself, often referenced in memes and conversations about modern relationships in the Philippines. Lines like “I’m so tired” have become symbolic of emotional struggles, and the movie has been hailed as a modern classic in Filipino romance films.In conclusion, The Hows of Us is more than a love story; it’s a reflection of Filipino culture and values. It speaks to the heart of what it means to love, to dream, and to grow—both as individuals and as a couple—while staying true to one’s roots. It’s a film that Filipinos can see themselves in, and that’s what makes it so impactful.",2025-02-26,7
Hows of Us,"Watching The Hows of Us felt like going through a rollercoaster of emotions—one moment, you're swooning over Primo and George’s sweet moments, and the next, you’re feeling the weight of their struggles. This film is more than just a love story; it’s a reflection of real-life relationships, the sacrifices people make for love, and the painful reality that sometimes, love alone isn’t enough. :)One of the most striking things about The Hows of Us is how undeniably Filipino it feels. The story revolves around dreams, sacrifices, and the struggle between love and personal ambition—things that many Filipinos, especially the younger generation, can deeply relate to. George and Primo’s relationship isn’t the sugarcoated romance we often see in mainstream rom-coms. It’s raw, messy, and full of the kind of emotional punches that make you reflect on your own relationships, whether they’re romantic, familial, or even personal aspirations that require difficult choices.The film also captures a very Filipino dynamic—the expectation to endure, to stay, to fight for love even when things get unbearably hard. It highlights the cultural sentiment of “sayang” when relationships don’t work out, as if every failed relationship is a lost investment rather than a lesson. The setting, the way the characters talk, the family pressures, and even the concept of diskarte in life and love all feel so close to home.As for hugot, The Hows of Us is full of it. George’s monologues about feeling exhausted from carrying the relationship on her own hit hard. Primo’s struggle between chasing his dreams and being a responsible partner is a reality many Filipinos face. The line “Pagod na pagod na ako” is something that lingers, because haven’t we all, at some point, felt drained from fighting for something that no longer feels fair? Do romance films feel “sayang” when the leads don’t end up together? Not necessarily. But in this case, the ending was both satisfying and realistic—love isn’t just about the big gestures, it’s about growth, timing, and the willingness to compromise. The Hows of Us gives us a hopeful ending, but not before reminding us that love isn’t just about staying; it’s about choosing each other despite the hardships, over and over again.",2025-02-26,7
Hows of Us,"The Hows of Us is a heartfelt portrayal of love, sacrifice, and the struggles of maintaining a long-term relationship. Unlike typical romance films, it delves into the reality of choosing between personal dreams and staying with someone you love. The chemistry between Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla makes the emotional weight of their story feel raw and relatable, especially with the film’s natural use of hugot lines that reflect real-life heartbreak and hope. What makes the film distinctly Filipino is its emphasis on perseverance, family, and shared responsibilities values deeply embedded in Filipino relationships. George and Primo’s struggles are not just about love but also about survival, making their story feel grounded and authentic.

Kathryn and Daniel chemistry is undeniable making it one of the notable romantic films in the Philippines cinema. What I really like about this movie is that it portray many aspects of the realities that many couples face in real life. The film explore the complexities of a long term relationship, highlighting how love alone is not always enough to sustain it. The struggles that primo and George face reflect the challenges that many couples experience such as personal growth and dreams. Both the characters have personal goals and dreams, and throughout the movie, they must navigate how to prioritize their individual aspirations while maintaining their relationship. This mirrors how many couples struggle with balancing their personal ambitions and the dynamics of being in a partnership.",2025-02-26,7
Hows of Us,"""The Hows of Us,"" a KathNiel starrer, isn't just another romantic comedy; it's a poignant exploration of love, commitment, and the messy realities of long-term relationships. Primo and George, the film's central characters, navigate the highs and lows of their shared dreams, facing challenges that range from career setbacks to family disapproval. The movie cleverly interweaves their present struggles with flashbacks of their blossoming romance, offering a compelling look at how time and circumstance can impact even the strongest bonds. While the film certainly delivers the kilig moments KathNiel fans expect, it also delves into deeper emotional territory, prompting viewers to reflect on their own relationships and the sacrifices love often demands.Personally, ""The Hows of Us"" resonated with me because it portrayed a relationship that felt real and relatable. It wasn't a fairytale romance; it was a story about two people trying to make it work, even when things got tough. I appreciated the film's honesty in depicting the arguments, the insecurities, and the moments of doubt that are inevitable in any long-term partnership. It reminded me that love isn't always sunshine and rainbows; it's also about navigating storms together and choosing to stay, even when it's hard. The film's exploration of dreams, both individual and shared, also struck a chord. It highlighted the importance of supporting each other's aspirations, even when they diverge from the initial plan.On social media, I'd caption a still from the movie with something like, ""Love isn't about finding someone you can live with, it's about finding someone you can't live without... even when they drive you crazy. #TheHowsOfUs #Hugot #KathNiel #RelateMuch"". Another post could feature a picture of George crying with the caption, ""Sometimes, love means letting go. But sometimes, it also means fighting harder. Which one is the real deal? #TheHowsOfUs #LoveLessons #KathNiel #DeepThoughts"". These ""hugot"" lines capture the emotional core of the film and tap into the universal experiences of love, loss, and the complexities of human relationships.The film's plot twist revolves around the true meaning of the ""hows"" in the title. While the audience initially assumes it refers to the practicalities of a relationship (how to live together, how to manage finances, etc.), the twist reveals a deeper meaning. It turns out that the ""hows"" refer to the different ways people love. Primo's love language is acts of service and providing for George, while George expresses her love through words and emotional support. The film highlights how these different ""hows"" can sometimes clash, leading to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. The resolution comes when they finally understand and appreciate each other's unique ways of loving, realizing that love isn't just about grand gestures but also about recognizing and valuing the small, everyday expressions of affection.",2025-02-26,7

Hows of Us,"Ang kwento ay nag simula ng si George at Primo na sa umpisa ay mag kamag aral na nagkaibigan. Ng mag kolehiyo si George ay tumuloy sa pag aaral ng medisina habang si primo itunuloy na isang maging sikat na musikero sa pamamagitan ng pag babanda. Sila ay nanirahan sa loob ng iisang bahay habang sabay na nangagarap ng magandang buhay at nangako sa isat isa na susuportahan at isat isa. Lumipas ang mga araw ang pangarap ni Primo na sumikat bilang isang musikero ay di nag tagumpay. Dahil dito nag iba ang kanyang pag uugali hanggang sa umabot na pati ang kanyang mga kaibigan at kabanda ay pinili na lumayo sa kanya. Habang si Primo nag bago, si George ay patuloy na iniintindi at minamahal si primo kahit ang kapalit nito ay ang kanyang pang sariling kasiyahan at pangarap . Sa kasamaang palad lahat ng bagay ay may hangganan ng si George ay napuno na sa ikinikilos at ginagawa ni Primo kaya naman kahit labag sa loob pinaalis ni Goerge si Primo sa kanilang bahay na tinutulyan. Naklipas ang ilang taon, habang si George ay tinuloy ang pag aaral ng medisina. Si primo naman ay nag bago at bumalik sa pag asang magkabalikan sila.Sa aking opinion sinisimbolo ng kanilang bahay ang kanilang estado o kalagayan. May mga bagay na gusto nilang punuin sa bahay na iyon tulad ng malaking 65 inches na TV at sofa, ngunit kalaunan ay hindi nila nagawa. Parang sa relasyon nilang dalawa, may mga bagay na gusto nilang mangyari, mga bagay na pinangarap nilang makamit ngunit hindi nangyari dahil sa sakim na katotohanan ng buhay. Aking nagustuhan sa pelikula ay ang kakayanan nitong ipakita ang hindi makasariling pag-ibig. Pinapakita dito kung paano magmahal ang pagod na puso. Ang mga pangako, panghihinayang, at paghihirap. Kung paano kayang buhusin ng isang tao ang kanyang sarili para sa pagmamahal. Kung paano ito patuloy na tumatayo, subukan man ng mga realidad ng buhay.",2025-02-26,-1
Hows of Us,"“The Hows of Us” is a Filipino movie that depicts the challenges experienced in a long-term relationship such as family dynamics, sacrifice, and resilience. It is centered around two values that all relationships in the Philippines share: tiis (endurance) and alaga (nurturing). The film also emphasizes the desire to go overseas that most in the average Filipino family has. Characters Primo and George embody the passionate, sometimes stubborn, but ultimately kindhearted Filipino dreamer, while George stands for the ate (elder sister) character. The things they say and do depict what real relationships would look like to their fellow countrymen. This is framed by the more serious undertones of what love can mean in the Philippines, which is full of tadhana (fate), enduring love, and personal sacrifice. This film is full of hugot moments, especially when George says: “Dati gusto kitang makasama pangarapin ‘yung mga bagay na gusto natin. Ngayon, gusto na lang kitang makasama kahit wala na ‘yung mga pangarap natin.” That line hits hard because it reflects the painful realization that love sometimes requires letting go of dreams.",2025-02-26,7

Hows of Us,"The Hows of Us feels deeply Filipino in many ways, making it easy for audiences to connect with the story.1. Family Comes First – Unlike Western romances that focus just on the couple, this film highlights how family plays a big role in relationships. George takes care of her younger brother, and Primo struggles with family expectations, showing the Filipino value of utang na loob (debt of gratitude).2. Love, Sacrifice, and Destiny – The movie reflects the Filipino belief in tadhana (destiny) and habambuhay na pag-ibig (lifelong love), where love is worth fighting for despite hardships. George’s patience with Primo and his journey to redemption mirror the sacrifices many Filipinos make for love.3. Familiar Names and Language – George (Georgina) and Primo are names that feel natural in Filipino culture, and the dialogue blends English and Tagalog, just like everyday conversations in the Philippines.4. Authentic Filipino Settings – From traditional homes and Manila’s busy streets to picturesque scenes in Amsterdam, the locations reflect real-life struggles—staying in the Philippines or chasing dreams abroad.5. Dreams vs. Reality – Primo’s passion for music and George’s need for stability represent a common Filipino dilemma: following your dreams or choosing practicality.6. Heartfelt Hugot – The film is packed with emotional lines that hit home, like “Pagod na ako. Kakahintay, kakasalo, kakaisip kung may patutunguhan ba tayo.” These deep, relatable moments make the story even more impactful.Overall, The Hows of Us isn’t just a love story but it’s a reflection of real Filipino relationships, values, and struggles.",2025-02-26,7
Hows of Us,"“The Hows of Us” is about a couple who have been together for years but are starting to feel the strain of chasing their own dreams while trying to keep their love alive. Watching this movie made me feel a lot of emotions—frustration, sadness, and even a bit of hope. It felt so real, like it was showing a love story that could easily happen to anyone. The idea of sacrificing for love, even when it seems like it’s not working anymore, is something deeply rooted in our culture. Filipinos often hold on to relationships, even when they get difficult, because we value family and long-term commitment so much.This movie made me reflect on love, sacrifice, and the idea that not all relationships are meant to last. Sometimes, people grow apart despite their best efforts, and that’s something everyone can relate to. It’s a bittersweet story, and it hits hard because it feels so familiar.",2025-02-26,7
Hows of Us,"The film follows George and Primo, a couple who started with big dreams and promises but slowly fell apart due to unbalanced sacrifices and priorities. While the movie tries to capture the highs and lows of love, I didn’t like the way it was portrayed because there could have been a better way to show the struggles of a long-term relationship. Instead of making it about real growth and compromise, it felt like George was the only one making sacrifices while Primo kept making excuses.What made this film distinctly Filipino was how deeply rooted it was in the idea of perseverance in relationships. Many Filipinos are taught to hold on, to be patient, and to fix what is broken instead of walking away. George embodied this—she kept choosing Primo even when he continuously let her down. This is a common theme in hugot films: the painful reality that love alone is not enough.Kathryn Bernardo’s performance as George was incredibly raw and emotional. Her frustration and exhaustion felt so real, especially in that powerful confrontation scene. Meanwhile, Primo’s character was frustrating to watch—he was selfish, immature, and only realized his mistakes when it was almost too late. His actions throughout the film made it clear that George deserved better, and it was exhausting to see her continuously put up with him.One of the most heartbreaking moments in the movie was when George was on her way to take her board exam. She was already in the jeep, finally choosing herself and her future, but she still got off to check on Primo. That moment was painful to watch because it showed how much of herself she had given to him—even when she was about to take one of the most important exams of her life, she still prioritized him. It was frustrating, but it also reflected the reality of many relationships where one person keeps giving while the other keeps taking.Another scene that struck me was when George confronted Primo and said, “Kahit cupcake, hindi mo ako mabigyan.” That line wasn’t just about a cupcake—it was about all the little efforts that Primo never made, the small but meaningful ways he could have shown he cared but never did. It summed up how unreciprocated George’s love and sacrifices had been, and it was heartbreaking to see her reach her breaking point.Some people say romance films feel “sayang” when the leads don’t end up together, but I don’t think that’s always the case. In The Hows of Us, I honestly wouldn’t have minded if George had walked away for good. The emotional damage was already there, and she had given so much of herself without getting anything in return. While the film tries to redeem Primo in the end, it doesn’t erase the fact that George had to suffer before he even realized her worth. The story would have been just as powerful—if not more—if George had chosen herself instead.That being said, I also can’t blame George for acting the way she did. One thing I’ve learned and seen from people around me is that love isn’t universal—everyone experiences it differently. Love can be complex and complicated to the point that it doesn’t make sense to others anymore. Even though I think she deserved better, if she couldn’t see it, then there’s no point. It’s her love, her story, and her choice.This movie made me reflect on love and sacrifice. How much should someone give before realizing they’ve lost themselves? Does love always have to come with suffering? While the film gives hope in the end, it also makes you question whether some relationships are worth holding on to or if letting go is the better choice.",2025-02-26,4

I told myself I wouldn't be George, but somehow, I did what she did because she loved Primo too much. Maybe love is so powerful that it makes you forget your dreams just to love your person. Also, it's really hard to balance happiness and a peaceful life. I hope it's simple and easier, but it's not. May we find the love we deserve, the love we won't beg for, and the love that will always feel like a peaceful home.",2025-02-14,4

Ang tanga lang ni Jo for giving up her dreams for a severely drunk Primo but, I would do the same if I were her. Ramdam na ramdam ko yung bawat emosyon sa lines nilang dalawa kaya napaisip ako na “Ah…baka ganito rin sila during that time.” Pero, sino ba ‘ko para magassume sa relasyon ng ibang tao? I relate both to Primo and George. One, being Primo—I saw myself in him as someone who is overly-passionate about what I really love but only to become an unexpected disappointment. Two, being George—George was a realistic character, who stayed, tried to understand the situation despite hindering her from furthering her dreams, still stayed, almost left, left the dream for a man, and left completely—but, she still pursued, hindi pa kasi masiyadong late para magsimula ulit—mahaba ang buhay, do and pursue what you really want to do.

Hows of Us,"yall i think i need to grow up more because the if i were george and primo started singing hanggang kailan to me while playing the guitar i would take him back right away  the movie actually made me cry because as someone fresh out from a 20-month relationship, it’s sad to see the version of someone you once loved dearly fade & suddenly you’re stuck with someone who you don’t seem to recognize anymore BUT ACTUALLY hot take … i think primo deserved a second chance with george  he seemed to have learned his lesson and was actively showing george how he’s changed after years of not beinf in contact. i also think that the vinyl he gave george on her birthday (which she found years after) shows us that he never ignored george’s struggle and was also affected by it as it was a result of his situation. if she only read the letter on the vinyl, i think things would’ve been different actually!! for me, primo was just misunderstood  he wasn’t a red flag (at least for me) but he was just very passionate about something that he has poured his whole life into. not getting your big break after multiple attempts? i would be losing my mind too but anyways! both of them had their faults as characters, george’s being not communicating her feelings to primo (she did this once and it was DONE) and primo… well he has a lot of flaws let’s not dig deeper. but yeah that’s basically itthree stars because the movie made me smile and cry. minus two stars because some of the scenes were a hard watch  and because i just didn’t get the whole “we will go to amsterdam but my dad ends up being dead” plot love can be sweeter the second time around. or maybe the third time around?but i’m never going back to my ex stay safe yall ",2024-10-24,4

Hows of Us,"This confused me on some personal things. As to why should we forgive and still choose the same person who hurt us. How do we forget and still love unconditionally. Looking back at it, George should've not forgiven Primo.But then I found my current partner and understood that in a relationship mistakes are never one sided, both didn't feel assured. They had different priorities but one lacked more and made it difficult to his partner. We used to fight like George and Primo. We would throw things, say things we dislike about each other; cried and despised but still gave us both plenty of chances. We took turns into staying in the living room whenever we fought and thinking about it now makes me laugh. We love each other on our best days and understand us more on our worst. I would sing him ""hanggang kailan"" that Primo sang to George and just like him, my bf takes care of my family like his own. This movie kind of reminds me of us.",2024-10-17,-1

Typical Cathy Garcia writing, puro toxicity nalang at forced positivity.Ito din pala yung movie na kinailangan ni D ng break from showbiz. Jusko, akala ko naman kung anong method acting yung pinakita niya, he was just playing himself. For all i know, they had to add that rain scene kasi hindi siya makaiyak. Jusko, buhat na buhat ni Kath yung movie. ""Bakit, hindi ba ako box office king?"" Gets ko na yung sinasabi nila na kung wala yan siya sa KN, he wouldn't have been BOK. Tsaka bakit ang daming unnecessary characters and storyline just to make us empathize with the mc. Tapos yung revelation sa ending, wow I've never seen anything like that before. It actually took me to watch two whole movies, several skips and increasing the movie speed into 1.5x just to finish it.Naappreciate ko bigla yung acting ni Alden.

Hows of Us,On a Tuesday night where I can't go to sleep because it has been quite a day- I went to the Filipino channel and found this movie. I love romcoms with a happy outcome and this one suited me perfect. The love story is elevated above the usual plot although it relies on misunderstandings and withholding information to protect the other. The entire story pivots on a house as a base as an anchor for their love- yet the house provides a way to work out their conflict. I like it. The direction towards the end sort of pushes the audience to a different outlook but as delightful romcoms go- it will please the audience with a sigh- a good sigh and tears will flow. Shhhh- don't tell my wife I'm a softy.,2024-09-26,8
Hows of Us,"very flawed, there are obvious problems like the pacing shifts a little bit at the end, few moments where you just think to yourself ""what tf is happening"" and few scenes that i think DID NOT have to be in the movie. but i would still recommend ppl to watch this bcz its in the better side of filipino movies.",2023-06-22,8
