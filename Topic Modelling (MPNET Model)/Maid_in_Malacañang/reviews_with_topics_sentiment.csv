Maid in Malacañang,"Anyone who gives this film higher than a 9 lacks integrity, or just has never seen a good movie: A lot of the late dictator's loyalists will hype this film up but its really, really boring. It's not the worst film I've seen but just like most of Darryl Yap's films, it's trash. Much of the acting from Christine Reyes is just her shouting. It's a grating noise to the ears. The maids in the film are the best part of it as the delivery of their lines are somewhat entertaining, however the lines and ""hugots"" feel so forced and shallow. The main problem is really the script. The emotional scenes feel so forced. It's obviously a propaganda film and a really boring one at that. It had an okay start but dragged so much at the middle almost as if they were trying to fit a bunch of propaganda from a checklist. The soundtrack and cinematography are okay but not enough to salvage the film. Skip it.",2022-08-31,negative,0.9078528881072998,0

Maid in Malacañang,Ferdinand E Marcos Sr is a great president: This movie shows a president who loves his people. I don't call him a dictator. I call him a great president. The Marcos family became victim of many false accuses.. I'm happy they are back.,2022-08-09,positive,0.9903535842895508,0
Maid in Malacañang,"Another Darryl Yap trademark: Political messages aside, the movie editing is messy and incoherent at times. The scene transitions were bad even for a typical Filipino drama. The acting seems forced and the story direction tries too hard but fails to convince viewers to sympathize with the cast because of badly placed comedic banters in between scenes and badly-written script. It seems like the director didn't learn or even try to improve on his filmmaking formula which has already been frowned upon in his previous films.",2022-08-05,negative,0.901583731174469,0
Maid in Malacañang,"Not even worth it: Honestly, I was expecting a coherent turn of events in this film. However, the lack of cinematography bores me to the point it feels like I'm watching a poorly executed youtube skit. As to the transition of the scenes, it was choppy. At first, I thought I'll get used to it but it turns out to be very unnecessary and annoying. The color grading was ok but I supposed they could have done more in terms of the lighting.

Furthermore, the acting was so bland and god it was horrible, in fact one of the actress could not shed a tear in the climax of the film. Nonetheless, the girl with the short hair expresses well with her eyes but her voice screeches sometimes. The dialogues written was plain and bland unfortunately did not engaged us viewers. I was hoping they would take us back to that time but that was not the experience at all.

Overall, the movie felt so rush and unproduced. Not even worth your time.",2022-08-04,negative,0.9804239273071289,0

Maid in Malacañang,"It made me cry: Please ignore harsh and negative comments about this movie. Most of them only watched the trailer and never bothered to watch the whole film. They are primarily from people who hate the Marcos family.

I just watched it last night, and it made me cry. I never expected myself to cry over a biopic, semi-documentary film that depicts the last 72 hours of the family of the leader who has been tagged as a dictator in Philippine history.

I don't have much expectation when it comes to local Filipino films. I never bother watching one in the past. But, for this one, I made an exemption.

I have watched maybe a thousand movies and foreign tv series; thus, I have a very high standard when rating one.

For this film, I rate it 6.5 stars.

It's a low-budget movie with a very compelling storyline and dialogue, and I don't want it to end. When it ended, I felt like there were more stories to tell, thus the reason I gave it a 6.5-star rating.

Another reason for my rating is that a few scenes are OA. I hope the director can improve his craft in the sequel movie, MoM - Martyr or Murderer? I am very interested to know what the Marcos family's take about the assassination of Benigno Aquino.",2022-08-06,positive,0.8788747191429138,0
Maid in Malacañang,"It could've been better.: I know criticism is your enemy, but let's be honest in here.

Apparently, this could've been a good movie if all of these plots and stories were made with true and validated proofs. I could say it's not ""bad"" to tell the story of the Marcoses-if only they were truthful to what the Marcoses did back-in their last 72-hours in Malacañang. I could say that most of the plot in this movie is just as distorted as ever, although I wanted to hear a single thing that Marcos Sr. Admits his mistakes that he have done to his country back then, but it turns out that this movie came out to be such an anti-climatic, and distorted. I know this is hard to accept, but mocking the Carmelite Sisters playing Mah-Jhong, making Cory falsely say ""Let them out of the Philippines"" isn't really the most accurate stuff I've ever seen in the movie. There are still missing pieces that I wanted to hear from this movie's script and plot.

I could re-watch it again to re-validate the topics above, but no, Daryl Yap, you should've grabbed the history books and read them well-even if it contains your enemies' stories, learn to accept them-accept the truth for everyone to accept your movie, and not keeping up with those beautiful lies to distort the lads.",2022-08-05,negative,0.5293133854866028,0

Maid in Malacañang,"The title says it all: a version of a tale of one of the most contentious times in modern Philippine history...: The title says it all: a version of a tale of one of the most contentious times in modern Philippine history as told from the point of view of three domestic helpers employed in the dictator: Ferdinand Marcos Senior's Presidential Palace.

(This is obviously the root of a recent trending topic on Philippine social media pitting historical accuracy against rumor-mongering - with the clear intent to validate this film's point of view.)

With the involvement in this film's production of a lone, single, individual with the last name 'Marcos,' from the entirety of this point in Philippine history; the film is the embodiment of a lone, single, individual's point of view.

Full transparency: this reviewer could only stand the first 30 minutes of the film before storming out because almost all of the events are conveyed through the incessant shouted narration, screamed narration, and complained narration of three fictional maids.

Context was totally absent - leaving the viewer to figure out for themselves and navigate the precise point in history that is being portrayed on film. As a witness to this history, even I could not make heads or tails of it.

Adding to the confusion, the actors playing their respective roles did not even exert any effort to try to emulate the mannerisms, speech patterns, and idiosyncrasies of the historical characters they are portraying. It's a guessing game, distracting from whatever message the film tries to convey, unless the entire nature of this film's existence is to distract.

The constant cutting between re-enactments and historical footage adds to the confusion since no attempt was made to recreate the footage using the actors in the same context. Go figure!

Maid in Malacañang,"A Movie that adds the story from the other persoective: I would like to write this review with no political bias between Pro Marcos and Anti-Marcos as I can;

In the recounts of history about the Marcos Family has been demonized by the media and our historical books about the Martial law, the plot was entirely simple that depicts the last 3 days of the Marcos Family living inside the Presidential Palace. No Historical revisionism has taken place, I said it myself, THERE'S NONE! During the EDSA Revolution in the 1986 every documentary has all-out entirely focused about the Aquino and the People who went out to spurt their anger about how they are sick and tired on the rule of Marcos for the past two decades, the ounce of brutality and the human rights violation during the time of martial law (1972-1981) the mere fact that it was understandable due to the rise of Communism in the 70's and organized terrorist running rampant in the Philippines of why it was declared. When I sat down in cinema frowning down with my expectations quite low. Upon realizing that the movie is comprised with different segments of chapters as if its a book of some sort, another thing I can add-on was that documentaries are lazily panned from the actual movie instead of letting the actual actors/actresses to do their part of the following history. The first Chapters started quite alright upon build-up pacing for the story. This, however went dragging on to the point the chapters were too repetitive, unpolished and very unnecessary. Instead why not derive the Chapters to just 3 settings instead of 10. The First Chapter is the buildup, the second chapter will be the climax, and the third chapter as the aftermath.

My most awaited part of the plot was the actual 3 maids that served the Marcos family for 20 years. Beverly Salviejo as Yaya Biday, Elizabeth Oropesa as Yaya Lucy and Karla Estrada as Yaya Santa, which served as the center-piece of the history which proves that this event really happened during the last days of the Marcoses. My only issue with the maids depicted in this movie is portrayed in comedic manner in such a serious movie that tear-jerks your emotion The pacing went downhill when the rallyists stormed the Malacañang in a very comedic manner due to Budgetary constraints. Philippine movies have come a long way to depict a proper practical effects in the movie.",2022-08-05,positive,0.9030425548553467,0

I really dislike this film, I enjoy Filipino documentaries because as a Filipina myself, it sparks nationalism in my heart but this movie? Not only did it do the polar opposite of what films usually make me feel but it made me sick to my stomach.

Maid in Malacañang,"history revisionism: Maid in Malacañang (2022) Directed by: Darryl Yap

Huling tatlong araw ng mga Marcos sa Malacañang... Ano ang nangyari ?

The movie didn't give the experience of a family in their last 72 hours.

The progression of events is anti-climactic.

The flow of conversation is dull.

The choice of words is hollow.

The storytelling is not cohesive.

It feels like you're watching some YouTube skits, TV Patrol excerpts, Theater scenes and SOCO rolled into one.

News. Drama. Documentary.

Fiction. Biopic. Comedy.

Fantasy. Tribute. History.

They didn't know what to tell and how to tell it, so they showed a bit of every other thing.

They just combined all their scenes by inserting ""chapters"" and ""long texts"" in between that literally summarizes what they want to tell-which defeats the purpose of a movie.

Some scenes give the impression of one long continuous shot. It actually works when Cristine Reyes is in the scene.

Si Cristine Reyes ang nagdala ng pelikula. Tumataas ang tensyon kapag siya na ang nasa eksena.

Magaling umiyak si Ella Cruz. Masaya ang tambalan nila Karla Estrada, Elizabeth Oropesa at Beverly Salviejo.

Walang dating si Cesar Montano.

Walang emosyon si Diego Loyzaga.

Walang ginawa sina Kiko Estrada at Kyle Velino.

Mas malakas ang prisensya nina Robin Padilla at Giselle Sanchez kahit ilang segundo lang sila nagpakita.

Hindi marunong umarte si Ruffa Gutierrez. Lumuluha na pero mukhang nagpapatawa pa rin.

Mas magaling pa umarte yung bodyguard na taga-Ilocos daw.

Meron mga salita na hindi naman ginagamit nuon. Pero lantaran nilang sinasabi sa pelikulang ito.

The scoring is deceiving, trying to enhance the scene-even when there's nothing remarkable in it.

Then by the end, there's a sudden tribute to characters that were not given its decent exposure during the actual movie runtime. An illusion that something is made for them-when it is not.

Mapanlinlang ang pelikula.

Maid in Malacañang,"Brilliant Movie with sense of humor!: This side of the story had long been suppressed to be unraveled to the Filipino people since time immemorial.

In fact, Philippine history books instill very negative pictures about a past President, while numerous living grandparents and ordinary folks who were witnesses of his reign (including my father, uncles and aunts) were all praises and admiration, calling him the ""Best Philippine President ever"" were undocumented.

This movie stirs additional curiosity to every Filipino as the story revolves from the point-of-view of the first family, being revealed and heard of for the first time.

A very family-oriented and brilliant movie you shouldn't miss!

The writers did a poor job with their research, this much is apparent. Painfully obvious how the narrative tried to bend reality. Hence the cringe script.

Acting was subpar, it felt awkward. The actors were misguided, perhaps in their direction on how to attack such scenes. At some points, scenes felt surreal. Good thing there were some funny tidbits.

Scenes were oftentimes monotonous, yet sometimes overbearing at the same time. The shrill zany acting in the second half of the film is just irritating at best.

This film has painted a negative narrative for President Cory Aquino. According to this film, during the EDSA Revolution in 1986, the late president dared to gamble with nuns whilst the Philippines' democracy is under siege.

On the other hand, the thesis of this film was to depict the Marcoses in a better light. However, the appeal to pity was unsuccessful.",2022-08-06,negative,0.9470106363296509,0

It finally showed what was happening inside Malacañang during those times. In the film you could actually connect some parts of it to Philippine history and would make absolute sense.

Also, if you watched the film you would know that it never distorted history instead it filled those gaps in history.

Maid in Malacañang,"Don't mind the 1star reviews: First of all, don't even waste your time reading all the 1-star reviews that were given to this movie. They are just mad because they are driven by the fear that their narratives might be overshadowed.

Second of all, this is just a FAMILY drama and intended to show their side of the story that other people outside the President's residence are not aware of.

Plot: This is just a straightforward dramedy that tells the struggles of the first family of the Philippines during their last 72 hours inside the Malacañang palace. The movie is divided by chapters. Of course it touched politics, but more than that it was a Family drama. The story was told with a mix of truth and artistic view. The movie will make you cry and laugh at the same time.

Tone: It was made to entertain and educate as well. It highlights what is obvious in Politics; trust, betrayal, loyalty, etc. Most importantly, it really tackles the importance of family during difficult times.

Acting and Characters: All the actors have played their roles really well. It seems that each character's attitude and behavior fit the actor who played it. Every scene is remarkable and will pinch your heart as if you are part of the scene. You can feel the emotions in every dialogue exchange, as if they are not acting and just comes out naturally.

Cinematography: There were scenes where the camera is panning in circular motion as if the movie is showing the audience how this family's life is turning upside down especially the scene between the mother and her son. The movement and acting are aligned and the actors are properly framed.

Summary: This may be my own opinion about the movie, but I can assure you that this is a legit review as I have already watched the entire film. Don't rely on the reviews having 5 stars and below, there are some Anti Marcos out there that don't even bother to watch the whole movie yet they are leaving reviews as if they are being good critics when in fact they are just bitter because another Marcos has returned in Malacañang.

""Huling tatlong araw ng mga Marcos sa Malacañang, ano ang nangyari?"" was the supposed plot

Yet, the movie didn't give the experience of a family in their last 72 hours

The progression of events is anti-climactic

The flow of conversation is hollow

The choice of words contribute to the hollowness

The storytelling is disorderly

Continuously changes format narratives

I think if they stuck to a ""documentary"" type of movie it would've fit well

They didn't know what to tell and how to tell it, so it became an amalgamation of every movie format possible

They just combined all their scenes by inserting ""chapters"" and ""long texts"" in between that literally summarizes what they want to tell-which defeats the purpose of a movie

Cristine Reyes carried the movie, Ella Cruz has solid crying acts

Cesar Montano, playing the infamous dictator, has no semblance of the supposed 'strongman' traits of the one he's playing Diego Loyzaga literally has no emotion

Others didn't do anything Looking at you Kiko Estrada

Misrepresentation of nuns with Giselle Sanchez playing mahjong already crosses this film out as a supposed ""addition"" to history, since said nuns are cloistered

Usage of words that were not present those days, but are yet frequently heard in the movie

Usage of musical scores are way off, since most of the scores play in scenes that are unremarkable

Then by the end, there's a weird and sudden tribute to characters that were not given its decent exposure during the actual movie runtime. An illusion that something is made for them - yet the movie is portraying a supposed tribute for the said dynasty

In the end, you'd stay awake because it isn't boring, but you're trying to understand why the movie is made as it is, and the supposed plot and the actual output strayed so far

You will appreciate the storyline, the portrayals and all if you go and watch with neutral stance on matters concerning Philippine politics..but of course, not easy to do for a person like , being an ilocano descent with over 20 years of exposure to the monopolized truth taught in schools from elementary to college pair it with a conflicting view and accounts from elders who have actually lived throughout the heavily pixelized Marcos and Aquino Eras..

A great family movie indeed. Historical Revisionism? I dont think so! Why wouldn't you give the Marcoses due process by just allowing their side to be heard or expressed in this Film? What are you so afraid of?",2022-08-05,positive,0.9952040910720825,0

To cut the review short without leaving any spoilers, MIM is a self-serving movie only towards the Marcoses and their loyal supporters. The acting and research behind this movie were hit-or-miss too; Ruffa Gutierrez fails to embody the delusion of grandeur that Imelda Marcos had.

They're so afraid that the Marcoses will be seen as humane and not the evil they actually thought they were because of how this information was indocrinated to us since elementary days. Poor us. I'm so glad though that I awoke early on like Noynoy Aquino days, I was hopeless at that time thinking all my college first time voter classmates are so impressed by the ""walang bahid ng kasamaan"" (No trace of wrongdoings) of the son of Cory Aquino but not seeing that he's actually a spoiled brat idiot who can't even get a girlfriend in his lifetime. Thank God he has no heir - Oh my Lord thank you, I praise You for this. Truly DIVINE JUSTICE as Imelda Marcos calls it is real. The Aquino's are the true destroyers of our nation.

After 4 decades, they still don't have any solid evidence against the man they portrayed to be evil. The haters are just too full of pride to admit that they persecute the wrong man/people.

This movie is bad to be shown to children who cannot discern properly yet and may believe what they see. STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED.,2022-08-05,negative,0.9596287608146667,0

Maid in Malacañang,"A film about a powerful political family facing the reality of their collapse.: The film portrayed the last three days leading to the fall of the Marcos family and their exile to Hawaii in 1986.

Taking away the political bias, the context of the film was about how each family member responded and acted to the realization that their world, their paradigm, was about to shatter because of betrayal which is a universal theme that everyone can relate to.

The cinematography was good, limited by the fact that the film had a meager budget and there was only one or two shooting locations for the movie. The soundtrack was well-thought of and laid out very well throughout the movie. Editing was better than most Filipino films that I personally had seen.

The acting was top-notch, and this is coming from a non-viewer of Filipino films---the performances were riveting and heart-wrenching which took me by surprise and disarmed me which is probably because so many people had given the movie bad reviews based on the trailer and not actually watching it. There were scenes which were jarring to paranoia tempered by scenes that were light-hearted and cringingly humorous. My only wish was that the costumes, props, and settings were more historically accurate, but I will cut it some slack since there wasn't much of a budget to begin with.

I would gladly recommend this movie to everybody, and would like to encourage everyone to have an open mind and the suspension of disbelief when going in the movie theatre. One's politics is only a small fraction of one's personality, so leave it at the doorstep and enjoy a rollercoaster ride.

This movie is a good one to take the time to watch. It is a film that is greater than the sum of its parts. Looking forward to watching the proposed sequels.",2022-08-04,positive,0.9932358860969543,0

The very existence of this film and its supporters spit on the lives and suffering of those who were unfortunate enough to dwell under thetyranny of the Marcoses' rule.

The funny thing is that the Marcos' relied on the gossips of the maids for their decision making. That in itself was already a red flag. The actual footages of the videos from the EDSA Revolution were just spliced to fit in the fictional storyline. The movie would appeal to the blind masses that are loyalists to the Marcos'. The whole events that happened in the palace were romanticized by the director like the Bongbong and Imelda drama in the bed, the father and son talk of Sr and Jr, Marcos and his daughter Irene, the speech of the 3 maids and the households,etc to make the movie palatable.

Unfortunately, the director only uses his one brain... inefficiently. His creative prowess is lesser a 5 month a fetus. The story he attempted to retell is so inaccurate it question his reading ability. That is if he has even read a single history book in his entire life. He tries to humanize the Marcos family with false information and blatant deception. His film style is extremely incoherent, it's almost like he has 5 different personalities writing the film but using only one brain cell. I cannot comprehend how this was published. It is more entertaining to watch paint dry than look at a single frame of this shameful ""film"".

In the end, Maid in Malacañang isn't just a bad movie. It's a manipulative, irresponsible piece of propaganda.

Christine Reyes' acting was the only positive thing I saw here. She is good with her portrayal and commands attention everytime she is on screen. The rest of the actors are disappointing. The extras are even better.

The story, indeed, runs contrary to what historical records show. There was an attempt to make the film appear to be a documentary but the lack of empirical evidence/proof as basis made it lackluster. The lousy editing made it even worse. It is like watching short videos woven together. It is not cohesive. And remarkable only for being utterly disappointing.

The musical scoring is weird. The music is ok but feel displaced as some unimportant scenes were heavily scored while the others were left disserviced by a musical scoring.

The direction of Mr Yap is also lackluster. The costumes and makeup were acceptable, but not noteworthy.

Overall, I think it will be better if they just showed it for free in youtube or other platforms for it is not worth paying good money for in cinemas.

Maid in Malacañang,"The Other Side of The Story GONE WRONG: As someone who has an open mind when it comes to politics, this film really made me see how distorted the POV of the other side. This film really aims to justify and victimized the family by making them appear too good and genuine to the point that it is not realistic anymore and is already trying hard. There's a lot of inconsistencies that I can't help but shake my head during a lot of frames.

I really can say this film is really not good in terms of artistic expression and direction. Acting-wise, most of the main actors are stiff and boring. I do not know if their script intentionally wants them to portray the roles like that or they are just terrible actors.

Overall, if you are someone trying to understand the ""other sides of the story"" as the people market this film, this junk is not really the best material. One word explanation: BIASED. I am aware that the supporters of this family are mad as hell for biased pieces but this movie is indeed one of those. Well, I don't wonder why they are not raging on this one since it is something that is what they want to believe.

Maid in Malacañang,"The film was boring and full of crap. Entirely a lie from start to finish.: Free movie stubs were given to us by some friends therefore, although I hated the thought of watching the movie, I came in to watch it with a friend. We were stuck watching the film just so we can sit on something.

First of all, don't believe these people giving this piece of crap positive reviews, these are people the director himself asked to review the movie and rate it with the highest score. The truth is, this movie was made to distort Philippine Marcos regime history. The movie clearly depicted an unlikable Cory Aquino ( Marcos' rival to the Presidential post ) to feed people with a false belief that Cory was the "" antagonist"" and the Marcoses we're victims of treachery and oppression of the Filipino people. The truth is, the director of this film is a friend to the Marcoses and he was paid to create a fictional version of the Marcoses story of the last 72 hours of them in Malacanang before they flee to the U. S. by force, as the Philippines had enough of their atrocities, corrupt administration and the poverty they left the country with due to their incapacity to lead the country to progress. The people had enough of them and they were attacked by the people after 2 decades under Martial Law.

The movie showed a Cory Aquino playing mahjong with some nuns while the Philippines was at war with the Marcoses. I mean, Would anyone ever think of playing mahjong while their lives are in danger and their country's state is uncertain? I don't think anybody will have the nerve to even sleep peacefully at a certain point, all the more, these people depicted to be playing mahjong are nuns and the late President Cory. This movie even managed to disrespect the nuns who brought Cory Aquino to hide with them while the Marcoses were hunting her. The movie made them seem as if they were uncaring at the time of crisis. The scene was senseless, blasphemous and laughable, as if the director tries so hard to degrade the nuns and ruin the name if the late President on purpose.

It also showed the Filipinos during the late 80's in the most advance city in the Philippines, mind you, holding torches while attacking the Malacanang Palace. What kind of activists in their sound mind would rally to the Presidential palace and while holding torches and in the late years of 1980's? Really torches in the 1980's? And people from the city in that time, holding them torches? What a funny fart ignorance of a movie this is. I don't know whether to laugh at the scene or just leave lol.

Had I known it was this ridiculous, I would have given my ticket to someone else. The movie was very inaccurate, provocative and utterly a dismay, a laughable senseless depiction, or fictionalization of characters, events and the entire history at the Marcos regime.

The universe does keep track of the all the deeds and pays back accordingly, this movie is not a revisionism at all like what minority noise people are saying. There is always two sides to every story ever told, Filipino people have been taught to only observe and understand one side of every story and that is to hate Marcos.

I had a tinge of sadness for what happened to the household workers, they werent given a choice and they werent really part of you know whats happening outside. I had to give it to Cristine and Cesar, they are really great actors. For actually a simple film, their acting is still consistent from all their award winning movies. Ruffa's transformation to IRM is on point. I was hoping though she could've given more lines or scenes. But nonetheless, the film is not that bad.

Maid in Malacañang,"Great Movie : The low rating is not due to the quality of movie and storyline but is purely political. A lot of anti-Marcos and anti-government have given very low review to this movie to retaliate because their ""Presidential candidate"" did not win in the last election.

Not everything that was written in our History about the Martial Law was the truth, our history, the international media, and Uncle Sam has badly tainted the Marcos family name and they were never given a chance to really explain their story for the past 36 years. No historical revisionism was done in this movie. The movie is factual and very entertaining to watch.

If you visit the Philippines, you will know that majority of people support our government and the President but some of the local and international media outlets are spreading false and biased news because of their political leanings.",2022-08-05,positive,0.8219477534294128,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Funny that 1 star-reviews are from those who didn't actually watch the film. Pathetic!: I was disappointed. I was disappointed that there was no ""historical revisionism"" in the movie, just like what is exploding now in social media saying the film is trying to revise history. The film only revolves around the story of the Marcos family, the people, and what is happening inside the Malacañang during the 1986 People Power Revolution. The actors were great! Christine Reyes was so damn awesome actress! Surely, the movie proved that Imee is a badass. Hahaha I was surprised that Ella Cruz's acting was great, too! The dramatic scenes can be heavy, so I suggest you bring tissue or hanky. I was preventing myself to wipe my tears at first, but when I saw other people sobbing unashamedly, I didn't stop myself. LOL I love that Director Darryl Yap added some comedy scenes to the film as a breather for the heavy drama. I enjoyed the film and I think it was also appreciated by the people who watched it, because the cinema in SM Aura where we were in exploded in applause after the film ended. I even heard people say, ""Ang galing!"" ""Shocks, ang ganda."" while clapping their hands. Awesome movie!

Story wise, this is an account of a maid in malacanang who was never given due wages and recognition (only those who saw the movie can relate to this). It was a moving story of a struggle of the nation's leader yet his vulnerability towards his family.

Imelda Marcos played by Ruffa Gutierrez did not have that much dialogue but portrayed brilliantly with her looks and affection as a mother for her children and the country.

The transition between scenes was fluid. The satirical nature of the director cannot be denied hence, those who have been against this movie would be triggered.

Because there's not a glimpse of the ""history revisionism"" as to what they are talking about in the movie. It was just telling the story of what the people inside the titular place had experienced when the Edsa 2 happened. The same narrative that was being told to us over and over like people raiding the palace was there.

Again. The 1 star ratings are just there due to their irrational hate to the Marcos name who is our current president now and also because there's a movie who is supposed to ""counter"" this but not really selling well because that's what these people, the opposition supporters, are.

Maid in Malacañang,"The movie that brought Filipinos back to the Cinema. A heartwrenching, untold story of the Marcos family in their last 72 hours of power.: Unfortunately, some reviews of this movie is politicized and given negative reviews by the Marcos haters even before it is shown in cinemas. The movie only started showing in Philippine cinema on August 3rd and it was a blockbuster hit. Tickets were already sold out by August 2, and cinemas had to add another cinema house and slot for people who walked in to watch.

Some reviews are based on their emotions and not about the movie.

Judging by the art of the film, it was made with brilliance. The timing, the plot, the story, even with a lot of conversations was not boring, it was intense and really impacting.

Maid in Malacanang is a heartwrenching untold story of what the Marcos family went through, days before Cory took office.. it's actually more of a drama and comedy film.

No scenes nor script in the film, of the Marcos family bad mouthing the Aquinos.

The plot conveyed unknown details of events but it is left to the viewers how to judge such information given.

It may be more of a personal family story rather than historical, but it will give us a lesson we never knew we were missing.

To me, the film is an opportunity for us Filipinos.

Maid in Malacañang,"It is an eye opener to those who are bias and selective in Filipino History: Just watch the movie first and make your comment afterwards. This movie is not an attempt to revise history of the philippines but an attempt suply stories that has been deprived to be heard more than 3 decades ago. It is good to know the the totality of the history before drawing a particular judgment. It is illogical to directly discredit a particular experience of history just because such experience is not popular or not in congruent to what has been accepted. History is not an exclusive per se but an all-inclusive collection of recollected events in the past which undergoes series of scrutiny and validation in consideration of its truthful product. Thus, I think it is time now to listen to the other side of the story first before making your conclusion.

If you are not a Filipino be informed first before drawing your conclusion. Do not be fed with bias media instead go to the Philippines and make your further research. It sounds plausible when you listen to both sides of the story before you make any judgment about Martial Law or the Marcoses.",2022-08-03,positive,0.8249387741088867,0

Maid in Malacañang,"SINO BA SILA?: It is not my habit to watch films on the first day they're shown in theaters. Knowing ""Maid in Malacañang"" is viral, popular, and controversial, I knew the cinemas would be packed so I did not make it an exception.

I watched it on the second day yet the theater was still full.

This movie is about a family that Filipinos are used to see on TV and read in newspapers and magazines, but never seen and heard behind closed doors.

This is the first time to see the candid side of the Marcoses and how they dealt with one of the most tumultuous parts of their regime.

The first part had the ""Nosi Balasi"" playing in the background, which made me think of the critics and the detractors that continue to discredit the Marcoses and their supporters through the years.

When you read the lyrics of this song, you'll realize that's exactly how the Marcoses treated their critics in the last 36 years.

I knew this film only presents one of the many perspectives of the so-called People Power Revolution in 1986. As the movie progressed, however, it became evident that two main perspectives are being narrated: those of the ""maids"" or the kasambahays, and that of the other ""maid"" in Malacanang who promised her father to tell their story in due time: Imee Marcos.

Others may disagree with me on this but I see this film more as Imee's perspective of events as the ""panganay"" and as the unpaid ""maid"" in Malacanang, who did her best to give order to chaos and make some of the important decisions for her family during the last 72 hours of her father's regime.

Having watched so many of Imee's vlogs and interviews, I can only imagine what she was like behind closed doors. It was Christine Reyes' portrayal of the character that gives glimpses of Imee's younger self in a way that I believed she was Imee. Christine showed Imee's facets convincingly: she was feisty, a quick thinker, always on her toes, decisive, a multi-tasker, and at times appeared to be a control freak.

The stories of the helpers inside the palace gave me a roller coaster of emotions; but more importantly, they gave the audience an idea of how the Marcoses treated their workers. The fact that the maids could be candid around the president, the first lady, and their children speaks volumes.

They also had accounts that painted the Marcoses as ""just like other good employers"".

One important bit that got me was when the maids showed their furs given by Imelda. The former First Lady told them that they, too, deserved to own furs. This reminded me of what FEM and Imelda often talk about in their writings and interviews: to give dignity to the Filipino people.

Of course, I couldn't help but mentally ""fact-check"" and compare some information in the movie with what I read from books and other publications throughout the campaign period.

The part about mainstream media spreading fake news that the Marcoses had already left Malacanang when they were still in the palace can be found in Paul Goldstein's article in EIR Journal dated July 25, 1986.

There was also the bit about Cory winning the elections based on NAMFREL's tally and FEM winning based on COMELEC's tally. You can find this info in Cecilio Arillo's book, A Country Imperiled and Rigoberto Tiglao's book, Debunked.

The part where the people at EDSA headed to Radio Veritas can be found in Paul Goldstein's article in EIR dated July 15, 1986

There's also something I noticed that's unique in this film that I don't see often in other Filipino films: the art of long takes.

A ""long take"" is a shot that's intended to appear as a single, uninterrupted take in the final edit of a film.

I thought this was interesting as it made the scenes appear more intimate. Long takes can draw you closer to the scene. At times, I felt transported into the story as if I were there in the moment with the characters, but as a silent and invisible observer.

As the camera gracefully glided from one angle to another, the drama and tension became more palpable. That's because long takes mimic the real-life scenarios of freely moving through space and time while expressing feelings of agony, confusion, and fear.

I jokingly posted yesterday on Facebook: ""Who wrote the screenplay, Direk? Because it was attempting to make me cry.""

And I did cry an ugly cry. Darryl, you're a brilliant writer. I felt the suffering, the confusion, the hopelessness, and the shattering of the souls of the characters.

The simplest of lines can turn those who are hardened into misty-eyed. You will identify something very personal in your own life with a line, a scene, a character, or a moment in this movie. I am not sure anyone could have written the screenplay any better as you did.

Another thing that I liked about this film is there were almost no actions and no special effects -- just a family and their staff talking to one another sometimes in a group, sometimes just between two people or among the family members. It's the simplicity of it that highlights its sentimental edge with dialogues so movingly performed.

You'll probably never find the stories of these characters in any publications mainly because they chose to remain quiet for decades or maybe they were not given the chance to air their side.

While others will most likely question the accuracy of the narratives in this film, no one should invalidate them especially when these perspectives come from characters who LIVED inside Malacanang for several years.

Like I said several times in my previous posts, there are hundreds or even thousands of ways to narrate an event depending on who is telling it.

Maid in Malacañang is about the perspectives of those inside the palace at the time when the opposition and the people on EDSA also crafted their own stories to tell.

All perspectives are valid, especially of those who were in the same rooms as the president of the Republic These perspectives are pieces that help complete a puzzle that perplexed the nation for decades.

The movie did not negate exiting perspectives at all. In fact, perspectives should be looked at and treated separately without prejudice against one another. This is how we understand both sides objectively. This is how we form a more complete picture of an important event in our history.

Maid in Malacañang is about how it makes you feel in the end. This movie makes me feel hopeful as a Filipino because, perhaps, this can help pave the way to national reconciliation so we can finally move on together as one.",2022-08-05,positive,0.8153965473175049,0
Maid in Malacañang,"We are entitled to know the TRUTH!: We are so excited to watch this film after they released the trailer, and it feels surreal when its 1st showing day (August 3,2022). And after watching the film, here's my analysis why this film deserves to be more recognized.

-the cinematography is lit! Its detailed and will allow you to go back in time when that tragedy happened. It captured every simple details that millennial should be aware of.

-Every character has given time to show its limelight, the ambiance,the script,the emotion,the soundtrack-that made the scene be more extraordinary yet realistic.

-the plot, the story that every fellowmen should know without filter and biased opinion or outlook.

We had so much fun watching the film, with an emotion in balance with witty funny sides of the in -character maids in Malacañang. This film exceeded my expectations and hoping for another part,part 2!

Now another light is being shed telling the POV/accounts of other witnesses of how things transpired during that moment. It is a whole new information besides the one sided narration being portrayed by the anti-Marcos.

Acting is pretty darn good and i specially appreciated Cristine Reyes, Cesar Montano, Diego Loyzaga, and Ella Cruz's scenes. Maiiyak ka tlaga. A lot of siblings would really relate to their roles. Yes there are quite a few political POV from their side but that's just a small part of the story since it clearly is a family film. Madadala ka talaga sa actingan nila. By the end of the film you will realize that the Family isn't really a family of pure evil as the yellow/pink cult would want you to believe. They are just as human as we are.

Maid in Malacañang,"GREAT MOVIE, IT'S HIGH FOR THE MARCOS'S SIDE: From CockyRocky (Facebook page Cocky Rocky, please follow him for all insights)

After military and rebel forces in collusion with the USA and the Catholic Church in the Philippines stole the 1986 snap elections from the democratically elected president, the late Ferdinand E. Marcos, rioters, looters and criminals stormed Malacañang Palace. Darkness swept across the land as a Yellow dictator illegally took over the government.

This was the start of the decline of our country's fortunes. Infrastructure, culture and the arts, agriculture, technology and even education gradually deteriorated due to her government's incompetence and corruption. The departure of the Marcoses signaled the start of our national trials and tribulation.

But. History is not through with the Marcoses.

The story of our country's success, security and prosperity begins again. Two great families - powerhouses, polar opposites and legacies - have come, a son of the North and a daughter of the South. Together, they are electrifying the world with their statecraft.

What a glorious time to be alive, to be a Filipino. Philippine history is upended. The truth and lies which were deviously but masterfully mangled, marbled and warped through the passage of time are now under scrutiny. This is a reckoning. We are fighting not just for our stories today but for everyday that we have lost since the historical revision which began in 1986.

The past - hidden by the hate-filled lies of the academics, the clergy and the media - are finally seeing the Philippine sunrise for the first time. Let it not be dimmed and cowed into obscurity again.",2022-08-05,positive,0.9876954555511475,0

Acting. Cristine should at least be nominated for Best Actress. Cesar, they will say he was boring, but he got Marcos Sr.'s serenity. Diego did well as Marcos Jr, he delivered his lines excellently and made me cry my eyes out. Ella was a delight to watch, I didn't want to cry at That scene but her emotions were contagious. Rufa was underutilized as Imelda, perhaps intentionally. The 3 maids were funny.

Maid in Malacañang,"An Actual Objective Review of the Movie: Okay. I am writing this because I just watched it earlier.

First of all, folks, the movie is not ""bad"". You only deem it bad because it portrays the side of the Marcoses.

Second, Have you watched it? Have you actually bought tickets to see the film? If yes, did you watch it for entertainment? Or did you watch it as your source for ""the truth"". Because if you went for the latter, then you're a snowflake and you just proved the other party's point that they can trigger you. Your source of information shouldn't be on what you see on the movies. It's a movie, give everyone a break.

Third, they portrayed the side of the Marcoses. If you think your idea of their own experiences should be followed, then you go make and produce the movie.

Fourth, when did you actually see a Marcos film post 1986? You know, the one that depicts their part of the story, even if it was bad. Was there? Honest question. Because I don't think there ever was. And this was the perfect film for it. Admit it or not, post 1986 we were already bombarded with Anti-Marcos, Pro Aquino, NPA, Martial Law events and victims movies - BUT. NOT. ONE. MARCOS. FILM.

Anyway, here is my take on the movie.

First five-ish ""Chapters"" of the movie went on with no cut scenes. I found this amazing as it shows their mastery of their script and their character.

The build up of the story was slow but entertaining, nonetheless, thanks to the comic of the three maids.

They were obviously pointing out references to defend themselves (Marcoses) which was kind of a smirking moment for me - it wasnt because I doubt them or something but more of a ""Okay they are being defensive on this part but go on.""

The team tried to build up the story by ""Chaptering"" the whole plot which is I think is kind of in the infant stage of Philippine cinema, at least they tried, and I should give credit to them because it was in a unique way of directing/producing the film. Given the fact that our movie industry is falling apart because of the likes of mainstream tweetums drama cliche stories of Cardo Dalisay, Kim Chiu, Vice Ganda and the like.

Feels of the movie could be better. I guess it was just the filter of the picture.

There were scenes of some of news cuts. It was okay for references but again, it could be portrayed/edited better. But nevertheless, the cinematic feels is there.

The torches, the Mahjong, the nuns were better off omitted if possible. But it is their point of view so whether or not these were true, they left it for us to do more research if we wanted confirmation.

Acting: The three maids, were great especially Beverly Salviejo. Great Character!

Ella Cruz was really into it! I thought she's just one of those actresses who was just famous. But no, she can act. And she can perform really well!

Cesar Montano as always has always been a great actor. So thats just it.

Diego Loyzaga needs improvement. I can't wait for his lines to be finished.

Ruffa depicted Imelda just fine. Nothing much engagement with the film.

Finally, Christine Reyes. She went on full beast mode with this one. The acting was just overflowing but I guess that how they wanted to portray her.

Overall, come on guys. It's a film so just watch it. Be objective enough to give where proper credit is due and not just because of Historical Revisionism point of view. It gets old. Compare him to Hitler for all I care, but some of you watched Davinci Code, Hitler movies and Lucifer the TV show. I mean, come on.

P. S. Will watch Katips tomorrow and will leave a reply to that review as well.

Maid in Malacañang,"SUPERB!!!!! MUST WATCH!!! : All those who gave just 1 star to this movie are desperate and obstinate losers who couldn't move on from their 'epic fail' movement last elections. Funny how they'd even spread their bitterness up to a movie review site!!!

BACK TO THE MOVIE...it was absolutely AMAZING!!!!! It's a whole ride of a roller coaster of emotions while watching this movie. You will definitely cry and laugh and get mad and feel all the raw emotions of everyone inside the Malacañang Palace during the last 72hrs of their stay.

DOES IS REVISE PHILIPPINE HISTORY??? DEFINITELY NOT. AS IN BIG BIG ""NO"". It doesn't change a thing about what we already know. The movie is not about showing who's right and wrong. It just showed the chaos and what was happening outside the palace and what was happening INSIDE the Malacañang at the same time. It never discredited any abuses nor any other claims. Instead, it just showed a new perspective and that is what was going on INSIDE the palace while every other thing is happening outside and in EDSA.

DOES IT MAKE PEOPLE SYMPATHIZE WITH THE MARCOSES? DOES IT MAKE PEOPLE SEE THE MARCOSES AS VICTIMS? NO. I don't think it intends to do that either. Everything depends on how every viewer takes everything in. It's an emotionally-packed movie and it just bombards you with everything. It bombards you with their ""truth"", their personal experiences, their emotions. It just literally gives you what these people felt and what they did during those last hours. Now, it's up for the viewers to decide whether or not they'd believe their story.

DOES IT PAINT LATE PRESIDENT CORY AQUINO IN A BAD LIGHT? NO. I don't think so. It just stated a normal reaction from a leader who thinks of Marcos Sr as her enemy. She wants him out of the country and so she did. I won't look at her like she's the bad one just because she wanted Marcos out of the Philippines.

AS FOR THE CONTROVERSIAL MAH-JONG SCENE...IT IS A METAPHOR. It just showed how politicians together with the ""CHURCH"" played their blocks for this EDSA Revolution. PLUS, FILIPINOS ARE NOT STUPID. Of course we know that Cory Aquino is really not playing Mahjong with her pink sisters during time of crisis. It's a given. Not just because we saw in the big screen that late pres. Cory and the nuns are playing means that they're really doing that at that time. We all know what to take as a symbolism, a metaphor and what to take literally.

IN VIEW HERE OF, ALL I CAN SAY IS...MAID IN MALACAÑANG IS A MUST WATCH!!!!! The family is crisis and all the characters are very relatable. Each of the viewers can see themselves in those characters, may it be as a father or mother or sister or brother or even as househelps who have been treated as a part of the family they've served for years. The music is powerful and very on point. The actors are all great!!! The lines are very very impactful especially the last part. No wonder why it will surely be a BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE!!! To everyone, WATCH IT!!!! IT IS ALL WORTH THE HYPE!!! VERY VERY WORTH IT!!!! KUDOS TO EVERYONE WHO MADE THIS MOVIE HAPPEN!!!

The atmosphere throughout the room is mixed - at one end, you could see people crying in tears, while on the other end, some would burst into laughter.

We already know the victors version of half-baked history and their bias narratives enforced into our books (sic), now, it's time to listen to the Marcoses' actual experiences in their last 72 hrs (and hopefully some more hours or events in the next upcoming movies in the future) before they left the Philippines.

Suggestions: Please bring your family and friends with you because for sure it will be a family bonding of TRUE HISTORY (the Marcoses' history which were deleted, hidden and unpublished by paid yellow historians) and for sure, you will not regret to miss for the world..

Witness the last 72hours of the Marcoses as a family inside the Malacañang as they were forced to be removed to power by an angry mob after Marcos won the 1986 snap presidential election on Comelec.

Director Daryl knit the story perfectly with the perfect cast, soundtrack, best cinematography, controversial scenes, metaphors and symbolism and actual footages from 1986!

The movie that leftist fear the most!

The movie they tried so hard to cancel but ended up being the biggest blockbuster movie since pandemic.

Maid in Malacañang,"BEST FILIPINO FAMILY FILM: Just like what Direk Darryl Yap said, Maid in Malacañang is a family drama. It is a perfect depiction of a Filipino family. It shows what you're willing to do for your family. It shows the length you're willing to go to for them. Every family-oriented and open-minded person will relate to this film -- politics aside.

I'm happy they get to tell their story now. After being deprived of it for 30 years.

Congratulations Direk Darryl Yap, VinCentiments, Senator Imee R. Marcos, and VIVA Films for a BRILLIANT project.

Maid in Malacañang,"My child's POV (History taught on their school): As a parent born in 1980, I want my children to have their freedom of expression and we respect it because it is their rights. We watched it on the first day of the movie (Aug 3, 2022) so that we can experience the vibe of millions of Filipinos who are hunger for entertainment and excited to go out with their families after 2 years of fear, anxiety brought by pandemic. The movie MiM is a very family oriented movie, that's why it has a rating of PG. And we can assure that it is very understandable and remarkable in the minds of our little ones. Me and my husband together with my youngest (15yr old), really enjoyed our family time - we laugh, react and even hide our little tears while watching the movie. It really touched our hearts as a FATHER to his SON, a SON to his FATHER & MOTHER, a DAUGHTER to her FATHER, and an AMO to their KASAMBAHAYS, we don't even thought of any political motives and it doesn't enter our minds that it was a black propaganda againts the previous administrations after the Marcos regime. I am not a movie expert, but I have eyes to see what is beautiful or not, I have hands that can feel the hands of my child that touched me during scenes that might get her nervous or excited. And I have a heart that can feel the hurt, the fear, and the hopelessness of a family that was betrayed by their so-called friends, allies, supporters and even families. I can relate to that, because I even experienced that in real life. When we got home, I asked my child ""so anak may nabago ba sa history nyo?"" She said ""wala naman po mommy"".

Admittedly, I have a love hate relationship with Darryl Yap's movies. Don't like Pornstar 2, Babaeng Walang Pakiramdam, Revirginized. Indifferent to Gluta, liked Pornstar, liked Jowable alot and truly AMAZED at Tililing. (All of which we have posts of as well) Had high hopes with this one but I really didn't know what to expect.

The story telling part was very well done. Same with the choice of music and scoring. Could have been so flat and boring because it was mostly talking among a few, emphasis on a few characters on a single location with a single topic. BUT, Biday, took control of this movie! There were a lot of powerful scenes and her involvement in those scenes, though actually minor and irrelevant and some made just to lighten the mood was SO ON POINT and FUNNY it made this movie that much more fun to watch! Truly unexpected and caught me off guard that made me laugh so hard.

The cast in general were really good, special mention to Christine Reyes, wow, Cesar Montano, wow, and BEVERLY SALVIEJO, WOW! Ella Cruz had one powerful great scene and hoped she did more.

8 of 10 for me. Was suppose to be a 9 but that cheap shot in the end was distasteful and merits a minus one, even if the telephone conversation (alone) was based on a documented interview. BUT, overall, something worth watching, specially because of Biday :D #wherecollectingisalifestyle.",2022-08-05,positive,0.9840099215507507,0

Maid in Malacañang,"GREAT MOVIE!!10/10: The movie was not about revisionism as what others who have not watch the movie claimed. I understand if others rate it as 1 even before the movie was released on cinemas maybe due to political reason I think. The movie was about the Marcos family during their last 72 hours in the malacañang. The cinematography was good. Kung di magaling ang pagawa, the movie can be boring. From start to end sobrang ganda. So far, this is the only philippine movie na aking napanood na aking pinalakpakan..GOOD JOB! Maid in Malacañang!

Definitely a movie for the ages. The story centered with the Marcos family in the 80's era where they must face the difficult situations ,cirumstances and wise dwcision to save themselves and the people they loved. How they adjusted to the actions and reactions of people around them. How the characters in the story helped each other and played their individual roles .

Maid in Malacañang,"AN UNTOLD STORY OF A KNOWN FILIPINO FAMILY: As someone who ACTUALLY WATCHED the film, I believe, It would be better for someone like me (who have watched it) to comment or make a review about it.

The movie has A LOT going on, definitely worth your money. It is an ""untold story of a known Filipino family"", nowhere near how they call it: ""historical revisionism"", but I do agree with revising parts of our history if there is a need to, and clearly, there is.

It is well-made; the acting, the plot itself, the setting, the effects, the props/clothes, everything.

It made me cry and at the same time, it made me laugh. Now, if you'd like to feel the same thing, know the what's happening inside the Palace that time, and know the Marcoses better, watch #MAIDinMALACAÑANG.

Showing now in over 200 cinemas nationwide and SOON worldwide!

So, this is what happened to the Marcos family 72 hours before they left Malacañang. I can see their love for their staff and how their staff loved them back.

It was beautifully written. The whole time I was crying! And then I would laugh and then I would cry again! Such a roller coaster of emotions.

Maid in Malacañang,"IT'S NOT REALLY AN HISTORICAL DISTORTION NOR A BIOPIC, IT'S JUST ALL ABOUT THE LAST DAYS OF THE MARCOSES IN MALACAÑANG DURING 1986 EDSA REVOLUTION: At first, we really thought or expect that it was historical distortion or revisionism of what really happened during the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution. But we've surprised and dissapointed, disappointed because we thought there will be revisionism but they did not have that.

And here's my review about the movie, which is same as the reviews of Mr. Mark Perez Agullana.

Plot.

The movie as the trailer suggested it is about the few days of The Marcoses in Malacañan Palace from the personal account of their household helper or maid and the Maid in Malacañan Senator Imee R. Marcos. By watching this movie, it presented a view I rarely see, read or hear about the Marcoses. Of course, it touched politics but more than that it was a family drama, the other side of the villain most of us do not know through the eyes of those close to him. The story was told with mix of ""truth"" and ""artistic license"". It was fun, laughters and tears. The story was told in a clear simple manner that everyone can easily follow.

Themes and Tone The main theme of the movie for me is family than politics. It was made to entertain and educate as well. It is easy to spot on the funny and entertaining jokes inserted in the movie. It is also highlighting and presenting what are the obvious in politics and life - traitorship, allyship, trust, honesty, doing what is right, doing what is good, family connection, friendship and other values. But most importantly, it highlighted the most important unit of the society, the family and its importance especially in difficult times. It tells the importance of making up a decision and acting on it.

There are many symbolisms in the film like the conversation between Bonget and Imelda and how they will be able to return to the Philippines and to the power, great use of imagination. And of course, the most controversial scene of Cory played by Giselle Sanchez. That closing scene and the statement are great show of how Politics and Religion are playing the lives of many Filipinos, the fate of the nation and its wealth while they are lucky for having a seat of power. Until today this is true, in every election and important bills being pushed in the congress.

Acting and Characters I like how each character played their roles. Still, Cesar Montano is Cesar Montano. From Muro Ami to this film. I am thinking how difficult it maybe for Diego Loyzaga to act with his father. Great scene. I wish I have a conversation with my father on important matters in my life. I feel like ILoveRuffaG is not Ruffa with her like x100 very slow movement in the movie. But I like how she potrayed Imelda with so much grace, beauty and elegance. She is really different from who she really is. She matched and gave justice to the role. Ella Cruz is okay. Not too much, not less. But she really did great in her scene with Cesar convincing the father to move out. The three maids were really good. Karla Estrada and Beverly Salviejo were very funny in their scene which gave a balance to this dramatic movie. It was not OA. Of course, Christine Reyes who played the very important role, showed in the movie the acting you expect from her.

Direction Daryll Yap's signature story telling was very evident in the movie. It was simple, not complicated, not too fast and not to slow directing. It was almost a straightforward story telling with symbolisms in a funny way. There was a little tension.

Score The music chosen for each scene were matched perfectly to build the emotions and connect to the characters and story. I like the song choice.

Cinematography The camera movement especially during long walks of Imee is bit shaky, maybe budget or I am not certain if that was intentional. The various shots and angle were good. It is comparable to mainstream films at low budget. I like how the camera was moving in circular motion changing the position of the characters of Bonget and Imelda while they were talking. It depicted how their lives were turning up side down. The lines, the shot, the movement and acting were aligned. All actors were framed properly.

Production Design The costumes and props were good. They matched with the story, the setting and the characters.

Special Effects There's not much special effects used in the movie except the sound effects which are okay.

Editing The film was cleanly edited. The flow is consistent. The transitions used are very simple but effective alongside with the effects and music.

Pace The pace is neither slow nor fast. It was enough. Each scene is not dragging and arranged properly. It was like small episodes of the usual vincentiments film and combined as one.

Dialogue There are conversations that I really feel not needed and the movie will stand still. Oh well, there is really a good script.

Lessons There are many lessons you can take from the movie. It presented an alternative view of the existing truth about the freedom we are enjoying today. Does it change the way I view EDSA, Cory, FEM, Ramos, Juan Ponce Enrile, the Nuns, the Martial Law victims, the truth, the democracy and others? No. It just reaffirmed what I am already believing about FEM, Cory, Ramos, Johnny, the Marcos Family, the Aquino Family, the Nuns, the Martial Law Victims, the EDSA Rallyists and the Filipino People - they are all human beings neither good nor bad. That good or bad outcomes are based from each person's decisions and actions. The movie was good, but I expect more next time.

PS. Indeed, the crowd went applauded after watching the movie. I just want to understand those person who are full of hatred in this movie even the truth is always truth. And this kind of movie, was made from the creative minds and imaginations. Their situations are believable, but the drama or act? Hehehe only they know the truth.

Full of drama and comedic acts with the FEM members and staffs. The 3 yayas are so perfectly balanced. Love the musical score. A lot of details in the movie are well placed, may be intentionally symbolic and/give credence to what really happened back then. I also love the use of video clips of news/interview footage.

That's why it made me wonder why a lot of noise is going on about historical revisionism. I am not a political analyst, but I think it's all just an automatic reponse to anything 'Marcos', that they are evil people, as what their mantra for so many decades has been.

People should see this with an open mind given that the Martial Law history written was incomplete and sides with the Aquino narrative.,2022-08-06,negative,0.92518550157547,0
Maid in Malacañang,THE BEST MOVIE: One of the best movies that I watched. It's a very good story and never boring to watch. Only here you can say that your time is not wasted because it is so worth it. Here you can really see the truth that happened before instead of a made-up story that has no truth. So all I can tell you is to pack a lot of tissue because until the movie is over you will just cry and cry. I hope here you can re-realize the truth that was not in the book before.,2022-08-06,positive,0.9961981177330017,0

The film, despite patently baseless allegations of ""historical revisionism"" by spineless critics, and farce, inorganic ""reviews"" by those seeking to resuscitate their defunct and decaying political capital, provides insight into the untold final moments of the Marcos family in Malacañang during the 1986 EDSA protests. No material misrepresentation of ""known"" historical facts were made in the film. I encourage you to see Maid in Malacañang for yourself to see how laughable and immature its film critics are.

This film made us cry, laugh, cringe, hate and love. All the actors were excellent in portraying their roles, most especially the Maid in Malacanang.

I love how the story unfolded in chapters, more like so when you are reading a book, and I got to appreciate how each title was artistically appropriate. The development of the drama and the timing of the humor were perfect. It can be published in a book and can be even made more powerful in a theater production.

This movie made me appreciate my family even more and it reminds people how love and family can make us strong despite the pain and the difficulty.

Maid in Malacañang,"Thought-provoking, remarkable, and hilarious - overall, entertaining!: I'd say 99% of the low rating reviews that the movie received came from people who have not watched the movie, I'll tell you why after I share my honest and objective review of the one of the most popular and controversial Filipino movies of 2022.

Most of these people are saying the movie twisted the usual narrative and that it revised the history by peddling lies about the Marcoses. The person who'd say just that is being too dramatic and is most likely a god who's all knowing of what actually happened inside the house and the minds of the Marcoses during the last 72 hours of its dynasty.

No one can really tell you what exactly happened in the last 72 hours as every person's perception of an event that took place in the past has his/her own version of that event. Say you interview 10 people from a single event, each one of those participants may have different version based on his/her perception, views, and beliefs. Hence, you can't say someone else's testimony or version of an event is ""false"" or ""wrong"". There is no absolute right or wrong - what's right for you may not be right for others, do not be all too self righteous.

However, this movie in particular is truly controversial as the movie apparently did not put the Marcoses in the bad light, which is something new to most people given how this last name is notorious for being the worst of the worst kinds of people - only if social media existed during the Marcos dynasty, back then, it was easy for powerful people to twist the minds and realities of the masses.

The theater in Cebu (SM Seaside) where I watched was i'd say was about 95% full, and the movie received a round of applause upon reaching the credits. If that doesn't make a movie good for you, then I do not know what is. Again, what's a good movie for you may not be good for the others viewers, and that's alright. As always, watch the movie before you rate it.",2022-08-06,positive,0.9057995676994324,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Two thumbs up: Don't be fooled by the. Snowflake dilawans' review of this movie. Not only do they have no intention of seeing the movie (yet rated it low anyway) but they got so excited rating it ahead of its official theater release. That alone gives you a clue as to what kind of people this group are.

The movie is not an ""attempt"" to ""revise history"" or to ""distort"" it. The movie is simply a glimpse of how the Marcoses handled their situation inside Malacanang Palace as EDSA ""people power"" was going on outside their gate. It's how they struggled through the ordeal individually as a son/daughter, as a father, as a mother, as member of the extended family (the maids), and how they handled it as a family as well.

Sure there were scenes that can be thought of as provocative. They can be seen as a swipe to Cory and those who masterminded and staged PP but they were very few and far in between. Besides, the movie itself caters to a specific audience. It's for those who are sympathetic to the Marcoses so it's to be expected that it will play to its audience.

Anyway, this is more of a family drama more than anything else. It humanized the Marcoses. And it was done in a way that it did.not completely absolved them nor completely glorified them. Honestly, I don't know where the fear is coming from.

Anyway, it's refreshing to see a Filipino movie that is different from the usual.

This film can pioneer a revolution in the industry. Our films should abandon the usual movie formula of loveteams, sampalan, predictable plot and storyline, very heroic and purely good protagonist and the pure evil antagonist. This movie used a lot of symbolism, there are character development even within that short span of time.ive not seen this done in most of our movies.",2022-08-05,positive,0.8972891569137573,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Martial Law- the other side: The movie revolves around the last 72 hours of the Marcos family in the Malacañang Palace.

The story depicts the unspoken side of the Marcos family who were painted monsters by the yellow democracy. Many revelations were shown in the movie which are not known to many Filipinos and strikingly, despite the fact how the Marcoses have been terribly persecuted, they have maintained their quiescence for the longest of time.

The transition of the story were stitched neatly and simply and these have made some gray areas clear.

The actors portrayed their roles effectively. One can related well with the characters especially the maids.

Musical scoring have matched the emotions of every scene. I laud well the arrangement of Nosi Balasi. It sounded really a dark past.

But I still have a few questions in mind that were not shown in the movie that I think will turn the tides and I hope to see it in the next two parts (because this is a trilogy)

1. Why did FEM stay long in power?

2. Who assassinated Ninoy Aquino?

The three maids will make you laugh & cry. I'm glad to see Yaya Biday (played by Beverly Salviejo) was able to see her family (The Marcoses) back.

I know Manang Lucy (Played by Elizabeth Oropeza) is happy because Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Was way ahead in the survey (60%) back in MARCH 2022.

Acting-wise: (1.) It's a mix of comedy and emotional scenes.

(2.) The acting is very well portrayed, it's mostly accurate, the way they talk, they move, they dress.

Overall, NO DISTORTIONS in this movie. NO REVISIONISM OF HISTORY. It is just plainly telling a story.

This movie opens up a lot of things for discussion and further examination.

And thus prejudice is because of who thus movie is portraying. But for me i base my rating on what i had watched and how much i enjoyed it. It's a great movie overall it has a lot of moment that will make you cry especially if you picture yourself in their shoes. I enjoy laughing and crying at every funny and sad scene during the movie. Some say it is historical distortion but as far a i have watched they even included video footages from that period to backup the scenes. For me the most memorable part of the movies is near the end where they try to leave malacanang. It shows how protesters jumped over the palace gates in an attempt to hurt/""oust"" them. That is not historical distortion because that really happened. There are video footage of that and it was also included in the movie. I just hope that people don't just make rating here because they are againts the people being portrayed.

Maid in Malacañang,"Worth the watch - For open-minded viewers: It's a family drama with an excellent pinch of comic relief. Contrary to the ""hate"" it's getting from those who have not really watched it due to political leaning, this movie did deliver on entertainment value.

The actors performed surprisingly well. From the extras, ""maids"" and to the lead roles, kudos. Story telling was smooth and editing was masterfully stitched. Soundtrack, hands down. The director really made an effort to tell the story without pretense. It was raw.

Was there a historical revisionism? I didn't think so. My father had personal accounts of the ML and the story was already ingrained in me since childhood. So I think, (at least to my perspective) that this story was something else.

In the cinema, I do hear people being emotional from some scenes. Seeing some audience nearby my seat, trying to wipe their tears. I was also one of those. I was actually moved not because of the characters itself but on how the director and the actors made the story relatable to common people - family. It does make you realize how important it is to learn from experiences and that it's always wise to listen to your parents. Love - is the primordial factor of survival.

The movie doesn't have anything to do with historical revisionism nor fiction like what others are trying to say selfishly just to bring down the image of a family or certain people.

The movie is mainly about what the people in Malacañang felt specifically the Marcos family during their last 72 hours there. Don't they have the right or at least the freedom to tell their side of the story that never been heard or fairly listened to since the past 30+ years? I thought the opposition love to scream the word ""freedom"" every rally? After all these years, why not ask ourselves who are the real dictators and threat to the country?

It seems that those people saying history distortion or history revisionism(those giving 1/10 for obvious selfish reason) didn't watch the movie yet. They gave review just to drag the movie down. For sure many anti-Marcos trolls will rate the movie 1/10 and yeah, that's just how sad and selfish some of them.

Maid in Malacañang,"Most awaited film: As you can see,the opposition or I must say,losers of the 2022 election flocked this site just to whine and invalidate a masterpiece that was created which stomped all their delusional hold of the public since 2016.

This is the story of a family,their grievances, and their vulnerability when they were betrayed by the people they fought so hard for.

The Philippines is riddled with brainwashed dafts who thinks they know everything and forcing their version of truth to us,the public,but their reign ended in 2016.

The film is visionary,a testament of people who witnessed that era that was silenced by the mainstream media. If you really want to know what's the real status or heart of the Filipinos,look at 31M Filipinos who voted for the Marcos presidency this 2022.

Maid in Malacañang,"Imperfectly perfect.a MASTERPIECE!: How should I put it?

Owh,way back 1986, EDSA people power took place and as a result,the Marcos family and the late President Ferdinand Marcos have nothing to do but to stepback and surrender the presidency.

Since then, the Victor's,Aquino administration, with all her allies continue to run the country and start their own side of history from that day. Sell the biggest government owned electricity establishment to private,change the Manila International Airport to her late husband's name, confiscating and freezing all the Marcos wealth, file hundreds or thousand of cases about the family which in Hawaii,the time wherein Ferdinand Marcos is already dying. His only request was to go back to the Philippines and die here,but the Aquino refused!

For the past 36 years, none of the Marcoss tries to tell what happened that day or have the chance to just discern their side.

I've just read about the unfortunate story in the book. It was taught in elementary,secondary and a little in college about Martial Law. Believing that the Marcos are evil and Martial law is nothing but a shackles to every Filipino.

Then the internet rise.

Iam now 37 years old, little by little,I'm questioning myself. Is the story about the EDSA and Martial law are correct,creditable and factual?

I started searching. Books by books. Article by article.

Then I realized, the history about it,which I've known since elementary was just a piece of trash.

I was living in a factual lies!

2016,BBM(Ferdinand Marcos Jr.) run the Vice Presidential seats but lost. From then on, I told to my self that I will support them. Not because what I have learned about them,but on what they can do in order to lead the Filipino people.

6 years gone past and he run again but for the highest post. And tremendously won the heart of 31m Filipinos by landslide. Why? Because he received more trampled trash from the past, tons of bashing, humiliation and unhuman forbearance by those who supported and believe that EDSA is worthy and the Aquino are saints that time.

After the election,2022, one movie becomes controversial. The Maid in Malacañang is a story of the last 72 hours of the Marcos family inside the presidential palace. They are also human who cries when experience heartbreak, who gets upset,who feel disappointment, who feels anger and hatred. They are also a typical family in different status in life,but they are human.

Those who believe in the people power said that the movie will revise the history.. IT'S A BIG NO You better watch it first then if there's any of the clip or scenes distorted the history, then email me and let's have some healthy argumentation about that. It's not a biopic and documentation movie. It is a story on what happened to them inside the Malacañang palace from the last 72 hours of their reign.

I rated it 9/10 it is. It needs to more justified. The other side of the coin must be heard and watched,not to change the history but they deserved to be heard. Even in the court. The judge weigh both sides.",2022-08-05,positive,0.9877560138702393,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Redeeming 30+ years of damage: I have lived my life from the very start of martial law and I am now approaching my senior years.

All along, I already knew the stories portrayed in this movie so none of these are new or surprising to me since I have followed these events in 1986 on tv, radio, newspapers and further reading.

And yet, I just have to shed tears for myself and my fellow Filipinos while watching Maid in Malacanang.

Great acting, story telling and directing. We can all relate to this movie if we watch it with an open mind and no political baggage.

Bottomline for me, if I were to categorize it, is that this is a movie about a family in the eyes of a family member and extended household who were in the throes of revolutionary hopelessness and filled with drama (not sensational or over the top like what we see in our soap operas) and light comic relief.

The soundtrack was equally moving and has been dwelling in my mind, rent-free.

Those 30+ years, sad to say, were wasted time for what could have been a truly great nation of and for the Filipinos.

Damage has and will continue to be done to the mindset of Filipinos from mind-conditioning and brainwashing by schools, the communists, the catholic church and the biased mainstream media which are still controlled by oligarchs and US puppets.

They have done this for the last 50+years and has institutionalized this bias since 1986.

These evil collusions will continue to wreak havoc if we don't deepen our understanding of the true state of this nation and the forces that are acting against the common good of the Filipinos.

I don't see any attempt to revise history.

Story was told as it happened from first hand experience and personal perspectives.

The movie serves its purpose in broadening the mindset and consciousness for nation building.

With Knowledge, Understanding and Unity, Filipinos will rise to true greatness.

It was how they were betrayed by close friends and relatives and a political party that hitched a hike with the American Government to KIDNAP President Ferdinand Marcos and family. History has painted the Marcos family as a dictator, inhuman and corrupt. The opposition also used religion to distort a predominantly catholic country in asia to protest against the ruling Marcos. In effect the 1986 People Power revolution was a peaceful process of power grabbing of the Cory Aquino presidency. Marcos could have stirred a cicil war, but instead left against his will peacefully.

Maid in Malacañang,"Emotion-triggering, tears and laughter: Despite all the fuss about this film, I went to watch it with an open mind. It could go either way but it did not disappoint. I liked that the movie was broken down into chapters. I liked the dynamic of the family, it's just like a normal family who goes through traumatic events. I mean, how is it not traumatic when there are so many death threats. The pacing is easy to digest, I love the details that were of the era. 

The biggest take away I have is that, not everything is as media portrays it. Which is very rampant even to this date. It only solidifies all the stories I heard from my 79 year old father who lived and thrived. He always shared stories of life back in the day. The narrative over the past 34 years have been the same, it's old and tired. The narrative has been broken. I think it's high time to hear the other side, which is weird because there are a few who are against it? Why? Even during a trial, there's prosecution and defense. We werent allowed to hear the defense side of things, it's due time to hear the other side. Also, if those years were truly the worst of the times, how come some of the very crucial hospitals that were made then are still very useful these days? What's even more boggling is that those who wished to overthrow then president and promised better lives for Filipinos did the exact opposite of what they promised the people? How come instead of making our lives better it became stagnant and even went downhill? Where is the improvement they promised? Heart center, lung center, and kidney institute were not improved and there werent any creation of additional public hospitals like those anymore. Those facilities that were built in that ""dark era"" are still functional to this date. Overrun as they are, they help the common citizen. These are some of the things that broke the opposing narrative. We refuse to be led to believe the holier-than-thou narrative. It's overused and tired. The hypocrisy is blatant and we no longer stand beside it.

The movie showcases amazing acting from very good artists, it'll trigger so many emotions in the audience no matter your age or sex. At the end of the day, it is an imagining of the last 72 hours in Malacañang in 1986. It is a movie, democracy is for everyone not for a select few.

Maid in Malacañang,"I Didn't Like It But Definitely Entertaining: So what are my thoughts about Maid In Malacañang.

This is a non paid review for this film.

Unlike trolls who reviewed this film and gave this bad marks without watching it.

So to start.

I don't like it. But read along before you attack with torches and hurl insults.

Here are reasons why. (Warning : Few Spoilers)

This is not a historical movie. If you want to see something stronger, then watch Brocka's banned movie or actual news footage. Not a movie told from the perspective of the producer, the director or the award giving bodies.

If you are expecting a revisionist movie like dispelling rumours about the Marcoses excesses and opulence, this is not for you. It doesn't hide their wealth and their control of people around them - from the luxury-wearing zero-gravity moving Imelda, to the scary bossy angered Imee, the party going camou-wearing brave-wanting Bonget. No sugar coating here - they are revealed as spoiled people.

It doesn't portray the Marcoses as the bravest souls as they show here how they spiraled to their fears and frustrations, the latter shown by former President FEM himself. If you are expecting them to be portrayed here as a blameless hero family, they aren't as even Irene

It doesn't show the Marcoses as the most powerful family in the country as they too failed to save their entire extended household (meaning those who lived long with them in the palace). The mahjong scene that irked many before the actual showing revealed the figures who were more powerful, and I emphasize, were as it is passe. And it is not the one who sat at the mahjong table but the bigger entity some tried to represent mockingly.

It didn't show the atrocities during Martial Law nor it depicted further the evil side of many politicians some have come to worship for decades. Nor did it tackle the roots of what made Martial Law to be declared.

It didn't utilise more some actors like Elizabeth Oropesa, the controversial Ella Cruz and even the most hated actress now for portraying the symbolic yellow wearing saint, Gieselle Sanchez. I feel like some scenes really got stolen much by the superb timing and acting of Beverly Salviejo aka Manang Biday.

But it did reveal some things that would make more people ponder, especially with the ""what ifs"". Highly entertaining as was the movie, I am left with questions after seeing it as the pieces still don't feel complete. With many puzzle pieces hidden before like actual video clips of how the palace was stormed and yes, burned (as there are actual reports to such in the news), the actual announcements to join EDSA uprising (I wish they put recordings of those actual announcements of Sin calling the faithful), to the big reveal for some that Marcoses were aimed to be killed by friends and some organised people, I can't help but ponder is the running time enough for film or is this better a series?

Some things are made clear here though.

First, and I won't be apologetic. This is a middle finger movie to Ramos who died days before the movie was shown. Maybe he chose to die before his humiliation can be revealed that he was indeed part of planners to kill off the first family. I know BBM paid respects but the Maid in Malacañang didn't and I understand her for that.

This is also a big middle finger movie to family and friends who betray us for politics. Darryl never shies away from controversy and arguments. With the 2022 election campaign being hailed as the most toxic we experienced (and maybe the worst of all time). The lines hit hard that you eat on the same plate with people who wish you dead. Sadly, toxicity is shared on the plate.

This is not a hate film though. In fact, it is a beautifully crafted melodrama with light touches of humor and reference to 80s, to telenovelas and even PRRD's expletives. The music was superb, the pacing mostly on point but always easy to follow and the acting delivered credibly by everyone in the main cast. If Cesar Montano and Beverly Salviejo don't get awards here, we know some directors probably thought to award it to someone else and found their own reflections.

Darryl also is masterful in creating memorable lines like how he delivered with his notoriously popular LenLen series. My dad kept repeating some of the lines he remembered and I of course love villains so you know whose I remember the most. Add the symbolisms, references and mild swearing he put may look or sound cliche for some but those are reminders that this movie is not perfect nor the people shown in it. It doesn't lie like others hailing their own as absolute truth and true masterpiece that must be seen again (and I say again as not much watched the first run, it wouldn't earn either with a re-run if not put side by side with Maid in Malacañang). It doesn't lie that it is not without creative liberties meant to stir emotions at almost every chapter as they hit the right nerves at most points.

Maid in Malacañang is not a movie made to justify lies as others claim it would be. Rather, it presents itself as a vulnerable piece prone to dissection - hence chapters. It is highly entertaining as it is thought provoking, tear inducing, BP raising, heart warming.

So I don't like it.

I love it.

PS the final mahjong scene looks funny in the trailers but it is actually a sinister dark energy filled take, from the daunting music which reminds of The Omen, to the evil spewed out lines to the closing of hands playing with yellows. A promotion of what was to come. Darryl should make a horror film continuation about this. :P.",2022-08-06,negative,0.5591394305229187,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Untold story not historical revisionism: We see the other face of history Lincoln once said, ""nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character give him power."" This to me sums up Maid in Malacanang.

I came out thinking of love and power after laughing and tearing up on the various chapters of the movie. Love being power in itself. The movie was love of parents, siblings, workers who remained loyal until the end, love of self (masama ba akong tao?), people who surrounded those in power and love of country. Love after all is power.

It has often been said, ""Love is Light, that enlightens those who give and receive it. Love is gravity, because it makes some people feel attracted to others. Love is power, because it multiplies the best we have, and allows humanity not to be extinguished in their blind selfishness. Love unfolds and reveals.""

I hosted a private screening of #MIM last 9 August. I carefully selected the audience ensuring a generational mix. There are six (6) generations: Baby Boomers: born 1946 to 1964; Generation Jones: born 1955 to 1965; Generation X: born1 965 to 1980; Xennials: born 1977 to 1983; Millennials: born 1981 to 1996; Generation Z: born 1997 or after and Generation Alpha: born 2010 or after. X. Only Generation Alpha was not represented. A total of 56 individuals watched #MIM.

There was no revisionism made. It provided the 72 hours on the other side of the proverbial fence, the side of the Marcoses which were never really made clear to all Filipinos. The side I hated and never crossed in my youthful years. But a leader I knew from grade school to college. He was my only president for my first 23 years.

Of course I didn't know the POV of the three (3) maids but certainly knew of Sen. Imee Marcos' role as ""mayordoma"" - she was after all the assistant of her father, being the eldest and more knowledgeable than the other siblings.

MiM reinforced the characterizations I learned of Imee Marcos and Bongbong Marcos growing up. There was no sugarcoating on those two. What got my attention was that of the youngest, Irene Marcos. She was never political. She was always the sweet girl with a ready smile. That scene of Irene Marcos with the father was gut wrenching. Was there creative license there? I don't know because Irene Marcos has never been in the public eye. But that scene summed up what to be in government meant, what to hold power and how to deal with people wanting more. Meron bang mabuting pamahalaan is still ringing.

Clearly the sibling rivalry was there. Clearly, Imee was her father's daughter and Bongbong was the mama's boy. On point was a strong Imee and a gentle and low-key Bongbong. The moorings of the son was palpable in the scenes with the eldest, father and mother. Interesting that the journal page on Bongbong had an extended play with FM saying he believed in his son despite being a spoiled brat, the son after all was out to secure the support of the father. In politics, the namesake will always have that internal doubt (am I worthy of the name? Can I be better than my father? Could I achieve even just an inch of what he has done?). I have seen that internal debates with fathers and sons in the world of politics.

The scene of loyalists remaining in the palace wearing yellow and doing the L sign were just stories I heard from friends who joined the march to Malacanang on that night. ""May mga tao kaming nadatnan pero pro-Aquino."" I remembered the trashing, the bringing out of souvenirs. I myself had a piece of the barbed wire but can't recall where it is today...

Ang ""kasaysayan ay chismis""? Puede pero sa ilang dekadang pagsasaliksik at paghahanap ng katotohanan, puede and chismis ay nagkakaruon ng ugat at yumayabong hanggat may nagiibang daloy para ito muling baguhin. Hindi natutulog ang kasaysayan. Ito ay umiikot kung may kontrang daluyan ng punto o pangyayari na uusig sa ating kinagisnan.

Darryl Yap knows the public pulse so well. He intertwined happy and sad; comedic relief in a hot confrontation; the power of the moment and the internal questions one get to ask about how to love a country are all in the film. Sometimes, its takes a very ordinary view by maids that we discover the real narrative at the back of certain events. They may not sit well for some but it has to be told.

Were the Marcoses placed in a different light after MiM? Yes, because we saw their humanity and no, because the final chapter has yet to be written. As a wise man said to me after the film, it would be better to see who instigated all these things. ""Where is Joma in all these?""

MiM also confirmed the role of a foreign power in getting the Marcoses out. They were escorted and just by a call, they were rerouted. I again remember a favorite adage: ""In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it does, you can bet it was planned that way.""

The character I loved in this film was Manang Biday. For someone who did not know how to swim, maybe she survived her plight because she drank a lot from the Pasig River .

Sometimes ordinary people hold the keys to where the mighty will soar or land head on. Often, they take the calumny to heart and that's what loyalists are made of. ###",2022-08-10,positive,0.9706566333770752,0

In fact, he is transparent declaring in a recent interview that, ""This is a family in crisis film"". It is to be appreciated from the perspective of the maids. It is the story of an eldest daughter who struggled to lead a family and to hold it together. There is no deliberate attempt to revise history.

Maid in Malacañang,"LEARN, ACCEPT, FORGIVE, FORGET & PROSPER: MOVIE REVIEW: 1. Amazing Acting of all actors involved in this film. (Their acting were able to immerse me into the situation) 2. Great mix of comedy and pain 3. Great storyline

MY PERSONAL MESSAGE: In this film, you will see how unjust these people went, but at the same time, how they deserved justice in the present time.

Remember, the Truth always will be revealed, one way or the other, maybe now or sooner. Whether you like it or not, Justice will prevail. It does not mean many people will believe and accept, but the Marcoses demonstrated that they still continued even if there are circumstances around them.

Haters out there, even if the elections are finished, do you even think the Marcoses will fail this time? No matter how much energy you put on hating the Marcoses, it would be useless. But it does not mean I hate you.

As a Filipino, can we all please stop all of this. Can we all move on? What would happen to the Philippines if we keep being divided? As a Filipino, I request that we must continue to prosper more, rather than being stuck talking about this history. It is time to start a new beginning.

Supporters or Haters, let's make a new beginning, for the sake of our future generations. Let us learn how to accept, how to forgive, how to forget the past mistakes, and how do we move on. It may not be easy, but we must learn to endure!!",2022-08-06,positive,0.9842292070388794,0

I could consider it as a ""Dra-medy"" drama mix with comedy, and it was done perfectly! Actors portrayal of Marcos family and all the cast were superb, intriguing, miraculous and very funny. It is not a film about pro or anti Marcos, it's about simple things in life which is love to humanity. In terms of its technical aspect, I was blown away from the costumes, props. ( airplane was one of them), and the soundtrack was top notch, you'll be humming it after you saw it, a world class classic!

Maid in Malacañang,"SUPER BLOCK BUSTER FILIPINO MOVIE OF THE YEAR AFTER PANDEMIC: THE EMPEROR'S SWINDLER: A SPOILER-FREE REVIEW OF DARRYL YAP'S MAID IN MALACAÑANG BY SASS ROGANDO SASSOT

I have watched Darry Yap's other films - Jowables, Pornstar series, and Revirginized. What I noticed in those films is Yap's storytelling: he begins strong, then somewhere in the story he rushes to reach a denouement. Maid in Malacañang (MiM) is a different Yap.

Nothing felt rushed, the storytelling progressed like an onion being peeled delicately. Yap peeled MiM so delicately in its intricate layers, letting the audience shed tears as each layer unravelled, without emotionally manipulating them to do so.

And like in his other films, Yap combined drama and comedy - this time, seamlessly. There's still the usual preachy parts, like in his other films - this time, integrated so well as a narrative device, rather than as a cop out from the labor of story development.

As an ensemble, the cast is skilfully selected.

Cesar Montano is a Bernini sculpture: the minutest detail of his acting is Ferdinand E. Marcos. Diego Loyzaga is spot on in his portrayal of President BBM's coming of age moment. Real-life father and son, Cesar and Diego's confrontation scene is like watching a masterclass in acting.

Ruffa Guttierez's elegant acting unveiled Imelda, as a mother, beneath all the glamor. Ella Cruz as Irene Marcos tells us she has a bright future in Philippine cinema.

The three maids: Karla Estrada's comedic timing is masterfully delivered. Elizabeth Oropesa is timeless. Even when she's just standing, she makes you believe. Beverly Salviejo deserves a standing ovation for every scene: Give her her own full-length film. One never wastes a juggernaut like her! Even if there are 24 characters in a film, just cast Salviejo, and she would be able to persuade you that there were 24 different actors.

Now...Cristine Reyes as Imee Marcos. She does not deserve an acting award. Reyes must be given a monument. Rename NAIA, EDSA, the West Philippine Sea after her -- I don't care. Reyes, like Montano, is a Bernini sculpture: even when she is deep in thought, she is giving us Imee Marcos. If Reyes could top her acting prowess in MiM, name an entire galaxy after her.

As the film reached its denouement, I cursed: ""Potaena ka Darryl Yap!!!! Brilliantly wicked!""

The Emperor's New Clothes told the story of the swindlers who made a fool of an emperor and his ministers. They promised to weave the finest cloth for the emperor, and whoever wouldn't be able to see it is unusually stupid. Unusually stupid - that's how enfant terrible Yap made everyone who thinks so highly of themselves looked like with his most brilliant work to date.

MiM's real plot isn't in the film itself. This is one of the rare instances where the real plot developed after the film has been promoted publicly. In this sense, MiM is just a subplot. The main plot is the one - consciously or unconsciously - written by Yap: The mass hysteria of people addicted to their victimhood - real or imagined, reacting to the film they never watched. Yap directed a satire -- and it's not MiM. If you're as alert as the innocent child in The Emperor's New Clothes, you will easily spot the nakedness of the Emperor, his ministers who lost the plot, and the swindlers who wove the finest golden cloth worn by history.",2022-08-11,positive,0.9801157712936401,0

We finally get to see their side after decades of being perpetrated as evil by mainstream media.

When this movie came out, and of course the vloggers and YouTube.. questions in my mins have been answered. The Marcoses are not monsters. They were portrayed as monsters by the oligarchs and elitists.

Previously made films or dramas always celebrated how the Aquinos were supposedly the heroes of Philippine democracy.

No other film in the contemporary time had tackled the story of Maid in Malacanan. And for that alone, I think this is a must watch for every Filipino, whatever political inclination you may have.

It is not democracy, it is the truth. There are no historical revisionisms, this is a story of every Filipino family.",2022-08-07,positive,0.9886634945869446,0
Maid in Malacañang,"My reviews for MIM: I've watched ""Maid in Malacañang"" last Aug.3 in a fully-packed at SM Cinema SMBF.

What it accomplished was to convey the EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER behind the last 72 hours of a family that is either going to be lynch-mobbed to death, or kidnapped for safety.

There is nothing revisionist about what happened in the critical days of EDSA, and absolutely nothing about Martial Law or the attempt to redifine it.

MIM did not distort the story of EDSA, nor of Cory, or the Carmelite Nuns for that matter. Far from it. The dilawan rage over the movie is so misplaced, and so convulated that I cannot help but again believe that it was contrived and manipulated just to fuel more hate and devide.",2022-08-07,positive,0.9667109251022339,0

Every parent / child can deeply relate with the scenes between FEM-Irene, FEM-BBM , FEM-Imee. Lines were strongly delivered. The artists were superb,! The three maids gave sterling performances. It is heartwarming to know how the Marcoses treated their helpers.

So much can be learned from the movie which I believe must be appreciated .Over all MiM is masterfully crafted by its Director.

Maid in Malacañang,"A Must-Watch For All Filipinos: It seemed pretty obvious that the rating here has been desperately pulled down by no other than the yellows/pinks, otherwise known as the anti-Marcos people. Notice how uniform the ratings are? People who truly took the time to watch the film wouldn't have written such utterly biased, uniform ratings. Somehow there would be slight differences in numbers, depending on each and everyone's movie-watching experience. However, as obvious as they can get, their purpose here is to attack the film and the people surrounding it, because they do not want the Marcoses' side of truth to come out, or be heard. Even before the film was released, there were already 1-star reviews, which is typical of how the other side has always reacted to anything Marcos. The real distortion here is the other side who claims to be for democracy, but couldn't even allow others to tell their side of the story. Ponder on that.

Darryl Yap is a brilliant filmmaker. Genius. I admire his brevity and his courage in divulging the untold story of a family that would help pave the way for an eye-opening experience to the Filipino people, through a significant work of art.

I love how the film was made; the symbolisms, the transitions, its metaphorical scenarios. Bravo, Direk Darryl!

Note: Open-minded people who are not pro-Marcos have watched the film and they were mind-blown. How do I know? I chanced upon watching their reactions on their Facebook live.

It was a story held back for so many years. It was the story that the media did not allow to be aired but were valid on all points because they too were humans, they too were Filipinos with families and friends who got hurt in the process. For me the story was ""bitin"", they could have shown more and planted more foundation but it was a direct point as to the story they want to get across. It was the story of the Maid in Malacañang.

Maid in Malacañang,"Imperfect!: As Ella told Cesar, the government can never be perfect. So does the movie. A gallant effort to show the 'normal' side of a family whose 'kingdom' is crumbling amidst efforts to destroy them, quite literally and figuratively and the reaction and interactions amongst them. Besides a Prologue and an Epilogue, divided into 8 chapters highlighting the conversations (topic is accurate but the specific conversation is cinematic invention) between and among members of the Marcos family feeling the world close in on them and the pain and angst associated with it. Each chapter conversation will try to pinch your heart and then caress them with humor, placed near the end. It has many foreshadowing, Between chapters are short narratives to connect each chapter either text, footages or narrations. It focus only on the family and their helpers. Its music is haunting and heavy (MOSTLY PIANO) save for some sequences. It is not epic and doesn't pretend to be, nor documentary, albeit it does show footages that are self-explanatory. Generally good, and has some scenes that I feel are either out-of-place or not-well thought-out or appears to be an editing misjudgment due to discontinuity. It is worth watching. Those rating this 1 or saying historical revisionism HAVEN'T SEEN this and shame they bother to rate something they've NOT SEEN.

It was a very good movie, I cried and laughed multiple times even though I'm not a fan of martial law and FEM. It was a story of family who wants to survive for the last 72 hours from the hands of NPA and brainwashed people because of the Aquino's.

Maid in Malacañang,"A story of family in the midst of crisis: I have watched the movie and honestly, there's no discussion on historical revisionism, it's a story of the last 72 hours of the Marcos family before departing at Malacanang. The historical events weren't change and old film clippings were inclusive and published to give the audience of what really happened at the so- called Siege of Malacanang, all were accounted and recorded.

Maid in Malacañang,"A Surprisingly Good Movie with Roman Catholic Themes: A surprisingly good movie, considering the sensitive subject matter! Genuine characterizations of the Marcos family, including their personality flaws, and a nice balance of drama and humor. Not at all revisionist, as the contents are mainly interpersonal events between the Marcos family and household staff, and TV news footage. Looking forward to the sequel.

There are a lot of Christian and Roman Catholic themes in the movie. I will not mention these in my review to avoid spoiling the movie. These themes become more evident on the second or third viewing. Observe the way the characters are presented visually. Also listen carefully to what they say, especially their choice of words. Observe things that are present around the characters.

The genre of the movie is definitely political, with the objective of humanizing the Marcos political family. This is good, because the Marcos family are human beings, and the movie is telling this truth. But I think the movie at its core, is deeply Roman Catholic, and uses the story of the Marcos family to communicate spiritual truths.

I did not give the movie the highest rating because there are some parts of the movie that ""tell you"" rather than ""show you"" through action and character development. But it is not easy to see this because the acting is so good. You are able to lose yourself in the world of the Marcos family during their final days in power, and we also care about the characters so much that we do not clearly discern the screenplay writer ""preaching to you"".

A lot of criticism about the movie comes from the final scene where Cory Aquino is playing Mahjong with some nuns, as they say this did not happen, and so give this final scene as an example of historical revisionism. However, what Cory was doing at the time is not historically significant. The critics miss what is being communicated in this scene at a spiritual level. Observe closely the altar next to the Mahjong table. Do you notice anything odd? What is the position of Cory Aquino relative to the altar? Do you notice anything odd about the nuns? If you see the spiritual theme being presented, then now you might have something significant to be upset about, after you get over the initial shock.

Enjoy the movie. It gets better with every viewing.

I have created a vlog reviewing this movie in my BitChute Channel: ""Prepare For Departure"". It is a spoiler review, so I recommend that you watch the movie first.",2022-08-27,positive,0.9940598011016846,0

Its a side of the story that was kept secret fr a long time. Thanks for the pilipino who voted marcos (Im not one if those because Ive voted another candidate but not yellow of course).

Maid in Malacañang,"Truly a masterpiece, three decades in the making.: Having finally watched Maid in Malacanang twice already over the last couple of days, I felt I should take to IMDB myself to rate the movie. Before watching this film, I had no idea really of what it might have actually really been like during those last 72 hours of the Marcos Presidency.

It's very easy just to rely on what's out there already in terms of historical documentation and documentaries on the Marcos era and those days as well as the so called EDSA revolution, but what we don't know is what it was really like for those present with the family themselves, what were there feelings, emotional responses and so much more. This movie and that era has been brought to life through the excellent storytelling of Philippine director, Darryl Yap. I believe he has put his heart and soul into this movie as have the whole cast and crew. Both Cesar Montano and Christine Reyes put on great performances, really believable and heartfelt.

Contrary to claims of those who have not seen the movie, we found No distortion of history because our PH history never wrote about their side of the story.

There are scenes that are super intense and you will feel it while watching. There are also some tear jerker scenes and then some comedic scenes from the 3 maids.

Character development and cinematography for me is good as well. And the soundtrack, it does help set the tone for some scenes.

Maid in Malacañang,"An absolute masterpiece: It was the first time in my entire life that a movie had such a profound impact on me from beginning to end.

The chapters are their entirety highlights. In the movie, each character has a standout moment.

1. The scene between Marcos Sr. And MarcosJr. Is excellent and ends with some humor.

2. I was deeply moved by the interaction between Irene and Marcos Sr. Irene's speech reflects her anguish very viscerally.

3. Imelda and Marcos Jr. Scene also made me shiver, and the scene where Imelda recognizes her jewelry and shoes captivated me. In the end, one of the maids sings the background music, and Biday is hilarious.

4. I was moved by the scene between Marcos Sr. And Imee in which he declared Imee to be his favorite and most trusted child.

5. But it was the sight with all the house staff and security officers that moved me and practically shed a tear to my eye. The three main maids address the entire staff in this scenario in order to inform them of the apparent departure of the first family. I was only able to control myself because I was sitting next to another viewer. But if I'm by myself, I imagine I'll be sobbing uncontrollably.

6. The final chapter, in which the servants lamented their exile with the family but were forced to use a piece of yellow clothing from Imelda's closet, is similarly heartbreaking.

Even as I write this review, I can't stop crying. The movie is a true masterpiece and magnificent. I'll watch this movie again, I swear.",2022-09-25,positive,0.9950196743011475,0

Maid in Malacañang,"true story: The movie is actually a family dramedy. If there is one thing that I find problematic, it is the stereotypical typecasting, once again, of maids becoming the sources of comic relief. But certainly, it is hard not to be amazed by Yap's masterful weaving in of humor as a punchline, most vividly represented by that emotionally charged confrontation between father and son Ferdinand Marcos Sr. And Jr., played by real father and son Cesar Montano and Diego Loyzaga, capped by the tiptoeing Biday, ably played by veteran comedian Beverly Salviejo. It was seen again in that touching dramatic silent monologue of Imelda Marcos played by Ruffa Gutierrez as she bid goodbye to her material possessions of gowns and shoes, taking only small mementos and love letters her husband Ferdie sent her, to the tune of that iconic 'Dahil Sa Iyo,' which turned out to be not a soundtrack but Biday, again, belting out her own aria as she was dusting a flower vase.

On a larger scale, the entire movie was actually a wicked punchline to rudely douse water ON the misplaced fears, the ruckus and the noise, about this movie becoming a monumental sacrilege to the altars of historical purity. There is nothing in this movie that actually distorts, revises, or replaces what we already know. This is not Yap and Viva Films trying to assault history with outlandish claims, but simply a dramatic, and sometimes hilarious, representation of a powerful family at their most vulnerable, most defeated state as they faced their imminent downfall.

It is the story of an eldest daughter, a role excellently enacted by Cristine Reyes playing Senator Marcos who struggled to lead a family in the throes of collapse, trying to hold it together. It is the story of a son, poignantly played by Loyzaga as the young President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., trying to make his father proud, trying to prove that he can be more than the party animal with whom his father expressed disappointment. It is the story of youngest daughter Irene Marcos Araneta played by Ella Cruz pleading with her father, and whose lines in the movie embodied a summary of the entire political career of her father.

Some people took note of the absence of any reference to the actual reasons why EDSA took place, and count this as a deficiency of the movie. What they missed is that this movie is less a historical account of EDSA, or the political downfall of the Marcoses, but a family drama to reveal the stories behind the façade of the presidential palace. Ella Cruz's character of Irene summed up what can possibly be said about the rule of her father - that his government was not perfect, and that he lost control of it and his people, many of whom betrayed him. These are factual claims.

There is no deliberate attempt to radically alter facts. Instead, what is given space is to provide the Marcos narrative a voice, and for the audience to form their own interpretations. The scene of the stash of cash at the beginning of the movie is perfect imagery that captured this. It establishes the fact that indeed there were boxes full of undistributed cash, which many would interpret as money intended to buy voters in the 1986 snap elections, but the character representing Senator Marcos rationalized it as payment for people who actually worked for the Marcos campaign. It was left to the viewers to form their own conclusions as to which narrative we will believe.

The much talked about, and bashed scene, of former president Corazon Aquino playing mahjong with nuns, who incidentally are clearly represented not as the Carmelite sisters, is actually an artistic and symbolic representation, following another symbolic scene where Ferdinand and Imelda waltzed while Malacañang was being attacked by a mob. If there is one moment where Yap made a political commentary, it would be in this symbolic representation of the political elites playing with the Church during EDSA. And no one can dispute that indeed the Church played a crucial role there.

This movie is not about revising history but about humanizing the Marcoses at their most vulnerable and weakest. This is something that cannot be denied by anyone, tyrant or otherwise. It doesn't change what they did or failed to do.

If there is another important fact that this movie revealed, it is that aside from the Marcoses there were others in Malacañang when it fell. These were the people who served them as guards and maids, who for so long were invisible, but finally were given a voice in this film.

In the end, the politics of this film is less seen in its content but more in how it has been received. It is like an RT-PCR test that would reveal whether we are positive with partisan prejudice, or negative and tolerant of other voices.

Beverly provided the comic relief from such heavy scenes.

Maid in Malacañang,"Worth Watching: This is a good story from the other side of the spectrum which gives audience a chance to veer away from the long standing narrative of EDSA.

Direk Yap did not hide the real truth behind MIM. In fact, he is transparent declaring in a recent interview that, ""This is a family in crisis film..."" and is to be appreciated from the perspective of the maids, primarily the three Yayas - Biday (Beverly Salviejo), Lucy (Elizabeth Oropesa), and Santa (Karla Estrada). He also did not conceal the fact that the Marcos family had a direct hand in the making of the film, admitting in the same interview that Senator Imee Marcos deleted some from the original script, added some of her own, and approved the final script. Senator Imee Marcos is also the Executive Producer. It is in these regards that those behind MIM are honest and transparent as to the intentions of the movie.

And yeah, the number of ratings gives justice that this movie is indeed worth watching for Filipinos.",2023-03-30,positive,0.9936016201972961,0
Maid in Malacañang,"The last 72 hrs....: If you're expecting a political thriller or a historical biopic, this is not it.

While based on true accounts, this is not about flipping the EDSA narrative at all. It is not to glorify the first family nor to make them heroes. So all the fuss about historical revisionism as far as we can see, is much ado about nothing.

What you'll get instead is a powerful tearjerker that exposes the Marcoses at their most vulnerable - during their last 72 hours in Malacañang. Even if you're apathetic about the Marcoses, you will still be moved by how Direk Darryl Yap. Is the film perfect? That's too generous of a statement. But it's very well-done.

The film is not a hagiography of the Marcoses but it shows them in a more humane light without completely absolving them of their sins.

It is a story of family, of love, and of hope. And that's something we can all root for..",2022-08-05,positive,0.9695640206336975,0

Add Recipe Note

Servings: six to eight.

Created at Brennan's restaurant in New Orleans in 1951, this classic dessert was named after loyal customer Richard Foster. Firm, ripe bananas are sautéed in a rum-infused caramel sauce, then flambéed in front of diners and spooned over vanilla ice cream. For extra pyrotechnics, throw a pinch of cinnamon onto the sauce as it flames.

Read the Test Kitchen blog for tips on flambéing safely.

Ingredients2 oz. (4 Tbs.) unsalted butter1 cup lightly packed dark brown sugar1/2 tsp. Ground cinnamon1/4 cup banana liqueur4 firm-ripe bananas, peeled, halved lengthwise, then halved crosswise1/4 cup amber rum, such as Old New Orleans or Goslings1 pint vanilla ice cream

Nutritional Information

PreparationIn a 12-inch skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the brown sugar and cinnamon and cook until moist, about 1 minute. Add the banana liqueur and cook, stirring continuously, until the grainy texture disappears and the mixture rolls off the spoon in a steady stream, 1 to 2 minutes. Put the banana quarters rounded side down in the pan. Cook until the bananas begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes.

Turn the bananas onto their flat sides. Remove the pan from the heat and pour in the rum. Set the pan over high heat and carefully ignite the rum with a long match or grill lighter. Gently shake the pan until the flame subsides. Remove from the heat.

Place a generous scoop of ice cream in 6 to 8 individual heatproof dessert bowls. Arrange 2 to 3 pieces of sautéed banana around each scoop of ice cream. Spoon on the sauce and serve immediately.",2022-08-21,positive,0.9755631685256958,1

The books introduced to us in elementary thru college do not write anything about the Marcos' side of the story - their anxiety, their hysteria, their pain. There is nothing in this movie that tells that the history taught to us were wrong.

It is sad that the people who support the opposition of this present day government, loose what principle they have of appreciating art because they get rabid when their opinions are stubbornly not accepted.

Bring tissues coz unless you are not human, you wont cry. It is relatable, imagine yourself being in their shoes in those last hours after living there for 20 years, and your sick dad and an angry mob. I really feel bad for Marcos as he was betrayed by his closest. But I guess they must do it para walang civil war. Somethings got to give. Marcos is no saint all politicians are anyway dirty kahit saan bansa. I read yung mga ninakaw nila Marcos na money binalik na sa pinas govt and yet those presidents that time took it to their own pockets using Marcos' name. So ganon din.

The movie's cinematography is really good. The actors who portrayed Marcos, Imee Marcos, and the 3 maids are great! There are some dramatic scenes that maybe did not exactly happen but were just added for cinematic purposes, of course.

Maid in Malacañang,"The Other Side of History: For a very long time history books and the opposition mainly pictured the Marcos family as despicable and evil, and that Cory Aquino was the one who led the ""peaceful"" revolution that led to the overthrow of the Marcos Regime. Most of the Filipino people, if not all, were fooled into believing the narrative and lies that the left, the rebels and communists, NPA sympathizers, oligarchs, and student activists peddled. (And now they are going to IMDB to give this movie a low rating because that's what losers do)

The movie showed the other side of that story. The director, Darryl Yap, is successful in making the acting, the story, closer to reality by inserting old video footages of the real happenings around the time of EDSA Revolution in 1986. Yap was able to show the Marcoses as humans who have emotions, too. They were betrayed, frustrated, scared, and feared for their lives as the revolution is not really as peaceful as the opposition claims it to be. It was chaotic and bloody.

The best thing about this movie is that the information used to create this masterpiece came from a very reliable source -- one of the maids of the Marcoses in Malacañang. She was able to get herself out of the chaos in the palace by jumping into the Pasig River.

The movie is a roller coaster ride of emotions. It made me cry and laugh and mad at times. IT IS THE BEST.",2022-08-08,positive,0.8148283958435059,0

The theme of family and loyalty, love for the nation is there, they really prefer to not use the gun, unlike their opposition.

If they were as ""eViL"" as some of these leftists/commie supporters have claimed, then how come the Philippines got worse when they elected that yellow saint of theirs who could not even bother to find out why her husband was offe'd and blamed it on Marcos senior.

Maid in Malacañang,"A MOVIE THAT SPEAKS FROM THE HEART: I must confess that many portions of the movie found me teary-eyed. Oddly, the tears came naturally. I kept asking myself how the simple scenes could evoke such an instinctive reaction. As such, based on the tears alone, my objective star-rating for the movie should not be less than 8 stars.

My rating would have been must less than the ten stars given. But I say that the low rating of one-star from many reviewers of the movie, is grossly unfair to the artistry and quality of the film. I found no one in the cast as over-acting, most all of the cast giving sterling performances. And given me the impetus to give it my full ten-stars to increase its IMDb rating. To up the star-rating of the film.

I encourage everyone to see the film. Not only because of its message. But also because we must give the Philippines a chance to heal from the hatred that has pervaded the country for so long.",2022-08-05,positive,0.8180345296859741,0

Maid in Malacañang,"made an account just for this!: I should've watched this sooner.

Everything was great including the cinematography and writing. The opening gave so much nostalgia for the 80s even though I'm a Gen Z. Tons of references, props and historical videos to back it up. The comedy is very cheesy but that also applies to every Filipino movie ever.

One complaint I have is the forced dialogue and political potshots but I don't really care that much because.

1. The plot is contained in only 72 hours

2. This was made in the middle of the election where everyone was in ""war mode""

FACT OR FICTION? (SPOILER)

There are some elements that are fact and fiction but the history is 100% FACT. U. S News articles back then showed the extent of the military coup where Malacañang was being peppered with rockets. The protest being violent was also true as there's no such thing as a ""peaceful protest"" and the movie even shows news clips of brawls between Marcos and Aquino supporters.

I saw a negative reviewer here that claimed the maids were just fictional comic relief. The same reviewer admitted that they only watched 30 minutes of the film before storming out of the cinema in anger. This is just false.

The big reveal at the end was revealing that these 3 maids were actually real people. One even sadly passed away just two weeks after the events. Almost every Malacañang staff loved the Marcoses and it's a commendable Filipino trait as maids are always treated as part of the family.

So the history is actually factual, so where's the fiction?

Opinion: Personally I feel that Imee's entire character is fiction. As she heavily contributed to this film, it feels as though this is what she wanted it to have been rather than what actually happened.

In the film, Imee is treated as the leader of the household that even her parents can depend on. But witnessing the dynamics of older Ilocano households and even in Bongbong Marcos' own words, the Parents are never questioned and they lead the family by themselves.

WHY THE RATING?

As stated, my only problems were two elements so 8/10 but overall, it was enjoyable to watch.

The solemn scenes are beautifully intermixed with the humorous scenes. It doesn't follow the Filipino extreme like making us think someone's dead only to reveal that they were sleeping. It knows when to put a joke and not interrupt the pacing.

The scenes were also heavy. Props to the actors for the performance especially during my favorite scene ""Ilocos o Leyte"" where Imee has a mental breakdown of paranoia after finding out the severity of the situation.

I highly encourage watching with your family (16+) as it's more of a family film than a historical film. Seeing your parents relate to the 80's references makes you feel like your bonding with them and the theme of the entire film is a lesson on how strong family bonds always prevail over petty political fights.",2023-04-10,positive,0.9000793099403381,0

Now i saw a lot, as in LOTS of supporting documents that are now binding to each other (the missing piece not shown by the media before). Also some of my titos and titas are more aware of the EDSA REVOLUTION events aside from the biased media telling me that the events are tailored.

The movie really showcase the other piece that are kept 37 years ago, specially inside the Malacañang Palace. Well documented and the actors/actress selection are excellent!

Maid in Malacañang,"The movie isn't a total rotten fruit but a lot of things need improvement!: Just watched Maid in Malacañang a couple of days ago. This is my first time to write a movie review and since I have no expertise in anything related to film production and writing stories, take this as a piece from an ordinary moviegoer. You might come across some strange expressions here, so I'm sorry in advance.

TECHNICAL STUFF. Whether it's the cinema's systems or the film's audio mixing, I found the sound so terrible that it affected my experience during the entire time. It was too loud that I had to cover my ears sometimes, even more for the moments when Cristine Reyes as Imee was shouting. And the balance between dialogue and music wasn't great; the Nosi Ba Lasi song didn't fit in well. And I wanted to enjoy the song naman while following the scenes. Another thing is the text. Did they make the text switch too soon or am I just a slow reader. I think it was too fast, and was part of my thought about the story feeling so rushed.

MUSIC. Nosi Ba Lasi is the theme song of the film. I didn't pay attention to the lyrics (never listened to the song before) but this version of Sampaguita's song did give some melancholic feeling to the story. Also I wished the background music wasn't so plain. I'm a sucker for movie soundtracks. The music score should have a unique identity.. It wasn't memorable. Also the sound of plucking strings during the maids' scenes felt pretentious. Didn't fit in with the sound style of the film.

CAST AND CHARACTERS. Okay, so I know nothing about the personalities of the family, so I wanted to see how the film would portray them whether it's assuming we already know the kind of people they are or it's gonna introduce them to us as if they're new (of course, accompanied with the knowledge this film is about the presidential family living at the Palace). I'm on the latter. I think Imee's introduction was good because I got to know her as this woman who's always moving, got a lot on her mind. When she gets back to the Palace, she's shown as the person most concerned about matters at home. I would be disappointed too if my siblings don't know what to do with their responsibilities haha. So I got the impression that the story would focus more on her development but the film dropped her in the middle of it. Irene, Imelda, and Bongbong suddenly got scenes of their own when I didn't really get to know them before that. (And clearly the father Ferdinand is a secondary character). Like, okay, I didn't care about their emotionals because I was already hooked on Imee's development from the start. The actors weren't bad actually. Christine Reyes as the stressed out Ate-of-the-house was impressive. Of course, she's the star here. For the other actors, I wasn't really impressed with them. I wish the story was written differently to bring out their best talent.

STORY. Bruh, I didn't enjoy the pacing. Too much tense and emotional scenes, it felt like a drag. I actually zoned out during Bongbong and Ferdinand's scene. And I saw two people on their phones during that scene too. I was expecting a good breathe of air after that but Irene's scene came next, I think. Hopefully my memory isn't bad. Also maid Biday's presence during that scene felt so out of place. I actually found it funny but it still didn't fit in appropriately. I wish the household staff had more scenes on their own since I felt they were important people in the story. If the story was written to not focus so much on the family but the Palace as a whole, I would've found it more interesting. The balance between serious and comedy needs improvement. Last thing, Robin Padilla's cameo was goddamn too cringe. What is this? The MCU? Welcome to the Malacañang-verse. And IRM 2022 during the Bongbong & Imelda scene was, er, cheesy.

THINGS I LIKED. I can't explain how the scene with Ferdinand and Imelda dancing in the middle of the Palace's chaos was nice. Ganda. Imee's scene with the staff at the end. I think that the only emotional scene I liked. The family cared for the staff and didn't simply abandon them. After Ferdinand called Imee the best maid in the Palace, the fact that the three maids were real people was a (heartwarming) twist! ""Maids are not just maids.""

Summary of stars deducted: 1. Terrible sound mixing and musical score was disappointing for a movie soundtrack lover 2. Lack of character exposition and development 3. Story felt like dragging and lost my interest and attention in the middle 4. Robin Padilla cringe and inappropriate comic relief (the maids deserved better!)",2022-08-08,positive,0.5576213002204895,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Rewatched for the first time since seeing it in the cinemas in 2022. I don't support anything that happened during the Marcos regime, however, I enjoyed the movie then, even now because it was meant to show the helpers/maids who worked in the palace during the People's Revolution. Personally, I grew up always having helpers/yayas and I have tremendous respect for them, and what they do for me and my family. I’ve had helpers who have seen me grow up, took care of me as a child, and some even took part in raising me instead of doing all that for their own children. In the movie, you could see the amount of loyalty the helpers had towards the family, and that’s something that I definitely see every single day with mine. Sometimes, I just think how lucky and how blessed I am to be on the receiving end of things, because they don’t just choose to be a nanny, most times they don't really have a choice, they have to work to send their children to school, put a roof over their families heads, or to just put food on the table and make ends meet. In return, it takes significant moments away from their lives, they take care of somebody else’s kid rather than their own, they take care of somebody else’s mother or father instead of their own. Spending time that can never be given back on making someone’s life easier. Even on the hardest days, they have no choice but to keep going. When theres nothing else they can do but obey what they are being told to do. Even after all of that, they still have a smile on their face, they still do their job to the best of their ability, and for that I will always be grateful.

There are times that they would inject humor when in just one scene Imee was paranoid. 2. More tell than actually showing the narrative. Each chapter has its own introduction. 3. Audio has its problems and in the first scene at the Palace, it seems that Christine has the mic alone. 4. Undefined genre, it becomes a comedy, then drama and at one point, horror. There was a point that it becomes a documentary. I guess, Darryl, pick a narrative style. 5. Production-wise, I will be nitpicking this. Instead of using the images of Cesar and Ruffa, they used FM and IM’s images instead. I need consistency because Cesar doesn’t look as much as FM. 6. Most of the time, they used the One-shot technique and engaging narrative but it was flat. 7. We don’t see much of the maids in Malacañang. I guess we have to change this to The Marcoses in Malacañang.",2025-03-25,negative,0.7324504256248474,0

Kaso hindi, ano rin bang ineexpect ko sa walang hiyang direktor na 'to, pinapalabas na para bang taumbayan pa ang masama, na parang hindi inalipin ng kanilang pamilya ang Pilipinas nang mahigit dalawampu't taon (at sa ngayo'y patuloy pa rin), minaliit ang rebolusyon bilang isang pulitikal na agenda ng mga Aquino, at hindi bilang isang makamasang kilusan na nagpabagsak ng diktadurya. Nakakatakot lang talaga yung huling chapter, kasi sa bawat isang makakakita sa katarantaduhang pinapalabas nito, may limang mauuto at maniniwala sa 'totoong kasaysayang' pinaparatang ni Yap, ng mga Marcos, ng mga bumubura at bumabaluktot sa ating kasaysayan - madaling makita ang appeal nito sa masa, napakadaling ipalimot at mabago ang ating pananaw sa pamilya ng isang diktador.Ang pinakamasahol pa ay, ordinaryong mamamayan pa ang ginamit (ang mga kasambahay at PSC) para sa pagpapalaganap ng propagandang Marcos - para lamang sabihing si Imee pala yung ""Maid in Malacanang"" (no fucking way they did this). Hanggang ngayon, ginagamit at inaabuso pa rin ng parehong Marcos at Duterte ang taumbayan para sa sari-sariling pulitikal na layunin.Iniisip ko bago 'to panoorin na ""Baka bawi naman 'to sa visuals at technical aspects"" kaso hindi, ang gimmicky ng long takes, inconsistent yung audio, hindi maayos yung pagpalit from comedy (na hindi rin naman nakakatawa) to drama, ang uncomfortable ng blockings, at ang artificial ng acting ng lahat ng gumanap, high school play lang ang peg.Kahit ganito, naging matagumpay ang pelikula sa nais nitong gawin: hugasan ang pangalan at krimen ng mga Marcos, napa-upo ba naman si Bonget sa palasyo. Pero kahit anong pagbaluktot ang gawin nila sa kasaysayan, kitang kita ngayong ika-39 anibersaryo ng EDSA na tayo pa rin ang may hawak ng kasaysayan, hangga't may hindi nakakalimot, hindi ito mabubura o mapapalitan.1/2 star para sa Traydor na Pag-Ibig ni Marion Aunor, ang ganda ng kanta, pero bakit naman dito ka napunta.Putangina mo Darryl Yap, putangina ng mga Marcos, at putangina ng mga DuterteNever Again, Never Forget!",2025-02-25,negative,0.7243925333023071,1

Gagi lahat ba naman ng iyakan pinepraise sina FEM and Imelda sa lahat ng mga ""mabuting"" nagawa daw nila. Not to mention rin how every single time the Filipino people are mentioned we are villainized just because we are fighting for the oppressed. “Hindi ko kayang labanin ang mga Pilipino”Tangina imaginin mo presidente ka tas gusto mo labanin directly mga citizens mo without even understanding why?Lumalaban daw tayo sa mga kabutihan na ginawa ng mga Marcos and malicious intent lang lahat para sirain ang pangalan nila. Eh the entire premise/the reason why we’re fighting is going over their heads. FEM saying that the revolution for the Filipino people starts when they leave the country to flee for their safety taints what it truly means to hold a revolution to fight for one’s rights.Wala, I hate this. Halatang pang brainwash with so many unnecessary emotional dialogue to get us to sympathize with them through the experiences of real life characters (the maids). The humor is so forced and out of place too. At ang pinakanakakainis is the ending scene- they really tried to be that deep huh Ang dystopian rin ng dating eh, a scene highlighting all of Imelda’s shoes and dresses tas the entire palace being so fancy. Do you really want to defend rich people who stole from the government and everyone’s damn taxes? Galing sa perang bayan lahat ng mga sapatos at damit na yan eh. Nakakaputangina, just because they gave their workers the bare minimum kailangan ba talaga sila sambahin ng ganyan?

Maid in Malacañang,"Lies. Lies. Lies.Fact#1. There's no denying this propaganda movie was made to clear the name of the Marcoses.Fact#2. Even as a work of fiction, this movie suffers from a bad script and bad acting. The only saving grace is Cesar Montano as FEM and, in certain scenes, Ella Cruz as Irene Marcos, Karla Estrada as Santa and Beverly Salviejo as Biday.Fact#3: Delusions of grandeur and messianic complex run in the Marcos family. Hindi lang si Imelda. Pati si Imee. The Malacañang Palace is not the permanent residence of the Marcoses. In fact, your family overstayed for 21 years because of your parents' greed for power. Imee as the 'Maid in Malacañang' is DEFINITELY NOT a reliable source. I have a feeling the eldest Marcos daughter will run for President after BBM.Fact#4: Unfortunately, a lot of Filipinos will be fooled by this movie judging by the reaction of the people inside the cinemahouse.

Maid in Malacañang,"+ Let's start with the few positives. How this film looks is amazing. Though, for most of the time, people are just standing and exchanging dialogues, the colors of this film really feels like a step-up, relative to Filipino comedies and teleseryes. Also, I guess I liked how it utilized old news footages. And, that's pretty much it.+ Anyways, leaving all politics aside (even though it's hard to do so), if we are going to just view this on the technicality of film making and writing, it's bad. The writing, sound design, and score are overly dramatic clichés you would expect from a family drama, a low-brow comedy, and from a historical and political biopic. Though I appreciate the long takes as it really let's the drama feel natural, however, it also exposes just aforementioned poor writing because it's dialogue that serves nothing to progress the story other than sending their propaganda. + But truly, one cannot really discuss how this film is written without acknowledging the context of which it arose from. If we really dissect the film, it will not stop bleeding ""Marcos Apologist"" and historical revisionism. It is also troubling how the film really conveniently is not interested in truly discussing the politics with enough rigor and discipline. It really overly simplifies the entire EDSA People Power to just a dangerous riot orchestrated by power hungry politicians. It leaves out all the complexity of the political climate, as well as all the money laundering which sparked the entire social crisis. Not to mention the violences inflicted during the Martial Law. There really is the sense that Daryll Yap, the director and writer, was only really interested in telling one minute moment of this dark but important part of Philippine history. And he did not even discipline himself enough to not fall prey to self-indulgence. He really wrote it as if its a novel which ironically, made all of the actors in this film feel like they are overacting. + What is also troubling is how it did not even shy away from truly depicting the regal and glamorous life of the Marcos' in Malacañang. From the number of loyal maids, every wall plastered with life size portraits, easy international travels, among others. And with that kind of glamorous mise en scene, the audacity of this film to mention that the Marcos are not elitists, and that it's the reason for the hate they get. + Christine Reyes, portraying a younger Sen. Imee Marcos, who happens to be a creative and executive producer of this film, had the highest screen time with acting that knows only to scream frantically. It really is interesting that the senator allowed herself to be depicted and written like this, a controlling paranoid daughter flustered by their family's downfall. And how they revealed she is the Maid in Malacañang? Wow. + And let me just point out how blasphemous this film can get sometimes. Other than the regal mise en scene that competes with churches and their number of Christian iconographies. The scene where President Marcos scolds his son, Bongbong Marcos, the camera gradually and steadily circles around the two as they exchange their dramatic dialogue. The scene is honestly one that I can appreciate because of how it chose to keep this camera circling them technique continue on one long take. But during this long take, there are a handful of moments when the ceiling lights goes behind the President's head resembles a saint with a halo. It's a small nitpick but, dear Jesus, this film really wants to be on the Marcos' good side. + Another nitpick I want to highlight is how in the scene where Bongbong and Imelda Marcos are talking, they seem to have overestimated the Philippine government after the Dictatorship, stating once they leave, the people of the Philippines would do everything not to let them come back. It does make the audience wonder, and potentially realize the failures of the republic that came after. But what bothers me is this will only paint the democratic and liberal ideas, that should govern us, with yellow And because of it, the discourse of political awareness goes down as just another color contest. And that ""IRM 2022"" just screams corny.+ There's no substance to this film other than the blatant propagandist nature of it. I recommend watching, not to support this types of film, but to persecute it.",2023-10-01,positive,0.7027298212051392,0

The composition and camerawork look good when contrasted with some of the soulless garbage that have come out of Hollywood recently.

Maid in Malacañang,"Nakakahiya lang…Looking for a movie to assist with Tagalog exposure, I thought this one might stand out amid what looked mostly like a sea of lukewarm romantic comedies. As it happens, this was substantially worse than I could possibly have feared about the others. You know you’re in trouble right from the jump when Imee Marcos is listed as both a creative and executive producer and then turns out to be the main character of the film. I suppose you can’t blame the Marcos clan for trying to further whitewash history now that they’ve fully completed their comeback with the ascension of Bongbong to the presidency a month before this was released, but I almost wonder why they even bothered when the attempt was so dire. This movie is two hours long and it could have cut down to about 20 minutes total - most of the runtime is occupied by interminable scenes of characters saying anything and everything they’re thinking, none of which would be particularly interesting even if most of it weren’t focused on the thesis that Ferdinand Marcos was not an oppressive dictator but rather a Great Man who Loved His People, Actually. Even by Filipino movie standards the overacting is intense - virtually every member of the main cast gets at least one showpiece to absolutely devour the scenery. The actress playing Imee screams so much she must have needed a lozenge by the end of filming (how this was intended as a flattering portrait of a producer of the film I have no idea, but I guess she is referred to as a “genius” multiple times).This reminded me of nothing so much as the kind of thing that might be dumped out by American *cough* “auteur” Dinesh D’Souza. It evinces absolutely zero talent on the part of anyone involved - the acting stinks, the writing would stink even if the message weren’t horrendous, the tone lurches wildly between melodrama and slapstick for no apparent reason, and the long takes (with their constantly moving camera) are insanely tedious. Paul Thomas Anderson this ain’t. But you actually have to appreciate how badly this is made - if this were a better movie, it might actually have some hope of convincing people of what it’s trying to do. But it’s such a mess it’s hard to imagine anyone getting all the way through unless they’re already enormous Marcos fans or absolute gluttons for punishment like me. For anyone else, don’t waste your time, and I do mean waste. There are easier ways to learn Tagalog than trying to sit through this joke.",2023-07-12,negative,0.8579104542732239,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Ang cinema ay audio-visual medium. Pwedeng panoorin tong MiM nang nakapikit dahil lahat ng information ay nasa dialogue na. Mas gumawa ang produksyon ni Daryll Yap ng radio drama kaysa pelikula. Yung pabibong one-shot unang tatlong chapter e hindi rin naman nakakamangha dahil wala namang action. Astig ang one-shot sa mga zombie movie o war movie dahil sa continuous orchestrated action. Pero kung puro lang naman dada ang gagawin e balewala din. Mas awtobiograpikal ito kaysa politikal. Memoir to ni Imee Marcos (the best maid in malacanang - FM). Siya ang producer e. Yung mga tunay na kasambahay sa malacanang noon ay halos narrator lang dito. Ni wala nga sila sa poster. Si Marcos Sr., sa persona niya during his times, e eloquent at strong man. Dito sa pelikula, binaliktad. Siya lang yung hindi matatas magsalita kung tutuusin. Paulit-ulit na nakakairita na naghahabol ng mga salita. Lalo na doon sa eksenang pinagagalitan niya si Bongbong. Tina-try gawing tao si Marcos Sr. PInakikita kuno yung malambot na side nila, yung hindi inihaharap sa publiko. Ganoon din si Imelda, at si Bongbong na may oedipus complex pa ata. At yung Irene ba yun. Mukhang tatakbo si Imee Marcos sa susunod na eleksyon dahil strongwoman siya ng pelikula, pinapabango ang sarili. Bilang propaganda palyado din ito. Dahil magagalit, matatawa, o aantukin lang nang husto ang mga ""oposisyon"". NI-re-reinforce lang nito ang parasocial relationship sa pamilya marcos ng mga loyalista.

Maid in Malacañang,"There is so much to dislike about Maid in Malacañang that there is not even one redeeming value in this blatant propaganda movie.The cast performance, which I thought would be the best (and only) part of the movie, ended up being disastrous. Not only they are terribly miscast, but they also don't sound like the Marcos family at all. Even if Christine Reyes had the ""best"" acting in this movie, it does not say much when she doesn't even look like Imee Marcos and the dialogue is terribly written. All of the budget to make them look accurate to the Marcoses went to Ruffa Guitterez's wig as Imelda and the filmmakers are lazily relying on the viewers to identify which one is who in the Marcos family. The cinematography is also not good. The use of pseudo ""one-take"" shot framing using the square aspect ratio to highlight the film's time period just makes this film so ugly and ingenuine. It's like I am watching a poorly-edited Lana Del Rey music video.The Vincentiments humor in some of the scenes is just terrible and very out-of-place for a period film like this. This is what you get for a film written by someone whose previous background in filmmaking was tacky sex comedies.Perhaps the most offensive part of this film is that it attempts to put the entire family in a positive light as if they are not held responsible for the things that took place during Martial Law. To justify their lapses, the film instead presents the Marcoses as genuinely good people who happen to be naive and absent-minded about the people who betrayed them and Imee (who is the film's main POV and the real-life senator is also a producer of the movie) happens to be the only smart one in the family. I just cannot fantom how people fall for this obvious lie, yet their supporters will take them as facts on the surface.It's so annoying how films like Maid in Malacañang, as well as its counter-programming film Katips, only aim to fuel our culture war here in the Philippines. Both of these films are only made to strengthen the confirmation bias of their target audience, forcing them to accept whatever they presented as facts instead of asking the audience to ponder the message they want to tell.Among all of the bad-to-mediocre Martial Law and post-ML era films made since President Bongbong Marcos became president, this is the worst one of the bunch.

Maid in Malacañang,"A gross spectacle in hindsight, one that embraces and glorifies every single form of manipulative and almost fascistic appeal from the characters. It's rather devoid of any sort of emotion and dipped into an endless pit of constant egotism by Darryl Yap that it's embarrassing to look at. When we are introduced to Marcos family, the first thing they with the large and spacious hallways of their palace, filled to the brim with gold, maids, and a polish mansion with never a single flaw in hindsight. When we are then introduced to the protesters, it's through low-angle shots, a filter of uneducated and poor peasants that almost sees them as derogatory of any kind. A film both ville and technically incompetent in direction. You can compare this to films such as Birth of a Nation or Triumph of Will, but at least those two films have clear reason and direction on why they exist a propaganda. In Maid In Manacalang, everything is so convoluted that it almost feels like a parody on Facebook rather than something to take seriously with. This film isn't even about any maids, and they probably just served as a light cover-up with the marketing. I hope Luis Bunuel comes back from the dead to make Darryl Yap live the events of ""Un Chien Adalou""",2023-03-06,negative,0.7169685363769531,0
Maid in Malacañang,"Historically distorted films have marred history for decades now. Certain movies like Argo, Braveheart, Pocahontas, and Patton had their fair share of twisting history in exchange for spectacle. Even movie juggernauts like Lawrence of Arabia or Titanic have been lambasted because they portray actual events. The difference between those films and this is that they have been created with cinematic accuracies that provide enjoyment to the audience.In the eyes of the filmmakers, what matters most is if the movie generates income, even if it's executed poorly story-wise and technicality-wise.Maid in Malacañang, despite its well-divided 10-chapter plot, is a mixture of unnecessary inconsistencies shown in a very cheap spectacle style. Inconsistent shots that tried to execute long takes, like in 1917 or Birdman, but the character blockings and setup make it more annoying than pleasing. Cheap sets used to represent the Malacañan Palace (The grandest mansion in the Philippines) looked like a huge village home full of creaks and poor paints. Mixing in 21st Century Gen-z dialogues to add humor that doesn't work well. And line delivery seemed like the actors tried to portray their roles because they were asked to and did not practice well.But I got to say, it takes a lot of heart and brains to really watch this one.Because to me, who has watched a good chunk of films, especially award-winning ones, made this film more annoying than enjoyable even if you don't bother comparing it to actual history. I know we are not always gunning for our movies to be ""world-class"" because filmmaking is still a business, and sales are more important because it generates money. Maid in Malacañang is definitely a tad below the low-class filmmaking because the whole movie felt like it was done in a rush, like a school project. Yet, it was still watched by a lot of people.I am wondering, have our standards on how we watch films gotten really low?",2023-03-06,negative,0.7004610300064087,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Fresh from the success of winning the Philippines' 2022 Presidential elections through their endless propaganda and trolling, Darryl Yap brings us his latest pessimus opus: the fictionalized retelling of the end of Marcos family's dictatorship, focusing on their last three days in Malacañang Palace before their exile in Hawaii following the People Power Revolution in 1986.In the film, Cristine Reyes play the fictionalized version of Imee Marcos, who returns to the Philippines after she is summoned by his father, a fictional, mild-mannered version of Ferdinand Marcos (played by Cesar Montano). Upon returning to the film's cheap-looking version of Malacanang, the fictional version of Imee Marcos learns about a failed assassination plot against their family. All throughout the film's excessively long running time, the fictional version of the Marcos family face betrayal of several high-ranking officials, including several Palace staff, food shortages, plus fear and anxiety from the growing number of the ""mindless"" crowds joining the EDSA revolution. After ten excruciating chapters and 105 wasted minutes, the family, upon the persuasion of the fictional version of Imee, decides to leave the Palace, with the help of m0therfvcking senator Robin Padilla as Gen. Fabian Ver, the Chief of Staff of the AFP under the Marcos Administration. The film ends with people storming the Palace, looting and destroying its premises.Penned and directed by Yap, with the real Imee Marcos serving as the film's creative producer, this propaganda film is actually not the worst Filipino film of 2022 for me (that recognition still belongs to the Claudine Barretto revenge drama ""Deception""). But this is definitely the most boring local film from last year. The film opens with a text saying the following: "" Ang pelikulang ito ay naglalaman ng mga tunay na kaganapan, sa gitna ng kasaysayan, sa gilid ng kaguluhan, sa likod ng media, na ngayo'y ihaharap sa Bayan."" Early on, it already conditions the viewers' minds that what they're about to see is based on a true story. It even used real life footage and clips from the time of the EDSA revolution to make it feel more ""real."" There's even a voice-over, claiming that Cory Aquino herself was advocating for the public's civil disobedience. We all know how it's going to end, with Marcoses as mere victims of fate and tragedy. Nothing is surprisng anymore. In short, their version of the truth, so it's predictable from the get-go. Kuwento niyo yan, eh.On top of this, the forced comedy makes it even more painful to watch. Can you imagine, the actual ""maids"" in the movie are the ones that make it more cringy, acting like some chorus and providing comic relief (which all failed). Karla Estrada and Beverly Sarmiento in particular, are both excruciating to watch and listen to. It feels more like a series of Vincentiments skit with bigger names, stitched together to form a film. It also looks like one. It's cheap. It's boring. It's always loud (lots of shouting, as usual). It's very dependent on stirring controversy. Very Darryl Yap.Right from its early scenes, the film's main focus is on the fictionalized version Imee Marcos, making it feel like she's the hero of the story. It's actually pretty confusing, because I remember the real Imee Marcos saying before that she was ""too young"" when she heard about Martial Law, but here, she's portrayed as a full-grown, fierce and intelligent woman, which we all know are all made up, just like her claim that she is ""one of the first female graduates from an Ivy League School -- Princeton University, graduating with honors.""And as expected, it paints Ferdinand Marcos as a naive and innocent victim who trusted the wrong people, and the entire family as sad victims. Boohoo. ""Palagi lang mabait! Yan, yan yung ginamit nila para mapagbagsak ka. Sobrang tiwala mo sa kanila,"" said the fictional version of Imee. They did get one detail right though: that young Bong-bong is a party animal, as proven by their massive private video collection obtained by the media, including the infamous ""We Are The World"" video during his birthday celebration on board the presidential yacht Ang Pangulo.To make matters worse, all the scenes lack tension. They all feel dull, despite how loud the characters shout their lines. The only thing that adds emotions to its scenes is its manipulative and overbearing music. The cinematography employs long shots which, instead of giving the film an authentic feel, makes it look more boring. The performances only add up to the film's blandness, like Ruffa Gutierrez's performance, who looks like she doesn't know any other facial expressions. She's like Jennifer Coolidge, but in a very bad way. You don't know whether she's about to laugh, about to cry, or she's just constipated. The only good decision that this film had is having Cristine Reyes playing the improved, cinematic version of Imee.It's packed with lies after lies, that it is so hard to keep track.""Galit na galit sila dahil hindi tayo nanggaling sa elitistang angkan. Galit na galit sila dahil probinsyano lang tayo. Galit na galit sila dahil mahal tayo ng mga tao. Pero hindi ko magawang magalit sa kanila,"" says the sadboi ex-President in the movie. And I'm not even going to dig further in that scene featuring Giselle Sanchez's portrayal of Cory Aquino playing mahjong with nuns, which has been debunked by the Carmelite sisters themselves.Long, loud, lame and lifeless, this fictionalized, propagandist film from Viva Films and Darryl Yap is nothing more than a disgusting attempt to whitewash the crimes and atrocities under the Marcos dictatorship, and to suck-up to the current administration.The design is very Darryl Yap.",2023-03-01,positive,0.7759637236595154,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Finally got to see the year's most controversial film! (Currently ranks as the 3rd highest grossing Filipino film* of all-time...as well as the fourth lowest rated film on all of Letterboxd right now.)I think Yap is just too stupid and lazy for this film to be *truly* offensive; as it is, it just plays out as the sort of propaganda whose only goal is to preach to the converted. The Marcoses are depicted as paragons of virtue, unfairly maligned by the ignorant (and jealous) activists/media who've always despised them. There's never any mention as to WHY these activists are so angry--no menton of the thousands of victims of the dictatorship. No, Ferdinand Marcos's only crime (according to this) is that he loved his country too much.I'd like to be charitable--one could defend this by saying that, since this film is only from the perspective of the Marcoses and their staff, that of course the result will be hero-worship...that in fact, he's making a critical view of him by showing how brainwashed his inner circle was....except Yap can't even do that, as he inserts newsreel footage and chapter headings that all promise he's showing us ""the TRUE story"" of the PPP. And the ending--Cory Aquino's lone appearance, gambling with nuns and heartlessly ordering the Marcos's exile--completely scraps that possibility (as it depicts Aquino as a monster, and it's also a scene no one in the Marcos family witnesses--it's all Yap.)That said: on a formal level, the film is really interesting. The average shot length is about 3 minutes each, and they're not lazy stationary ones; Yap will start a scene outside the palace, then go indoors, up the stairs, into different rooms, with dialogue from multiple actors, all without a cut. I don't quite know why he's doing that, but it's a really neat touch, as most of the film is comprised of conversations, and I'm always a sucker for shooting those at a distance with shots as long as possible--it's the best way to capture performance, imo. And the odd music cues (it starts with an 80s dance version of an OPM classic ""Nosi Balasi""), random interjections of humor (from the maids), and odd bookends of scenes (a maid ends her Big Speech to the palace staff by asking one for a candy bar), it's all very interesting...yet totally at odds with the rest of the film which is blunt and brutal.*That’s what Wikipedia says, but I’ve learned that the box office figures for this were almost certainly inflated artificially.",2023-02-14,positive,0.7855309247970581,0

Maid in Malacañang,"as with all things in life, one must take this film with a grain of salt - obviously you have to when imee marcos is a producer - and they absolutely are trying to whitewash the marcos family, even romanticize them. thus, the way to view this film is as a window to how delusional the marcoses and their supporters are. in this way, it becomes a fascinating and at times hilarious watch (often unintentionally). the extent to which daryl yap tries to humanize the marcoses is so over the top it is comical. it’s not that humanizing the marcoses is a sin - it’s the @$$ kissing that makes one rolls their eyes. and there’s plenty of it here.nonetheless, i found this to be more entertaining than basically any lav diaz film i’ve seen, and less offensive than the racist film of (the otherwise great auteur) mike de leon (both of whom - rightfully so - are marcos critics). at least with maid in malacanang i knew what to expect - diaz is so pretentious i dgaf how much my politics align with his, and the fact that filipinos ignore the (not even casual) racism of kakabakaba ka ba really makes me want to bash my brains out. as if fawning over the royal family of england is any different than the fanaticism of marcos supporters, but one is more acceptable to certain filipino cinephiles than the other. in the end, if you’re not ken loach/paul laverty or the dardennes, what does it really matter? guys, it’s just a corny movie.tl;dr the marcos dynasty still sucks and this film is corny, just like all the films about the royal family. just laugh at it. or hate on it, i dgaf. but let’s not front, either postscript i can’t believe i have to actually say this, but one of my uncles was actually tortured under the marcos dictatorship, but i might as well just do it preemptively to ward off any weirdos who might come across this post and want to comment you apologist you! foh!",2023-02-10,positive,0.8793555498123169,0

Maid in Malacañang,"[ahahaha if u saw my profile yes I watched this, but I also watched Katips as well- ALSO NO I WATCHED THIS FILM ONLINE JUST LIKE KATIPS]Okay before anything, I'm not a kakampink or Marcos Loyalist [and I don't care about political labels] so if you don't like my opinion cuz it doesn't align with your political views, then don't read my post from here.I've heard of Darryl Yap before [Via vincentiments] but I wasn't interested in his works- since I found most of them to be disrespectful and controversial, yet ig that's the style he likes or made him relevant anyways...So, I watched this film with a neutral thought-and I knew that this would focus on the Marcoses' (Obviously cuz Imee helped him produce it) last hours in Malacanang (yk when they were ousted in 1986), and I never really thought about it but yea I never heard their side of the story when it came to their last hours there...[Okay this is where all the political shenanigans happen so please respect my opinion huhuhu]Well, it's rare to see a film talk about the Marcoses on a less-evil note - unless bloggers talk about them, so there was kinda a gap for me when it came to perceiving Marcos Sr. as a father than as a strongman. It wasn't my cup of tea at first, but ig he was also a person who had his flaws IN THE FILM. The actor portrayed him pretty well, the same goes for Bongbong and the rest...I also liked how they centered this more on family issues than political issues tho. And wow They sure had their conflicts...I just didn't like how they kinda rushed on some parts, or overly exaggerated the maids...Storyline: Engaging and interesting, yet had some plotholes. [3/5]Characters: OKAY OUTSIDE THE ACTUAL MARCOSES, the characters in the film were good. [4/5]Music: Meh. [2/5]Overall: 9/15 - again I'm not a Marcos supporter [or even a Leni supporter] - but okay the film was decent. Relieved I didn't see this in the cinemas, but well it did reach my low expectations...""Does this change my opinion on the Marcoses"" - bruh, just cuz I watched a film that all the Marcos supporters had been eyeing about, doesn't mean that I will support him or his allies at all. I have my opinion on the family- and even if this film centers on them, it will never change my political views whatsoever.""Do you think this boosted Marcos' reputation"" - I can't speak for the film's viewers, it's up to the mindsets of both toxic and healthy-minded Filipinos who bothered seeing this movie. ""Do I think that this is historical revisionism?"" - not really, it's just their POV, also it's a movie with an exaggerated plot so I doubt it; after all, we can't speak for Imee, she's the daughter so she's tryna keep it clean ig""Katips or MiM?"" - I suggest watching both...then making your own opinion on them- outside the political viewpoint. Character-wise - MiM / Music-wise - Katips / entertainment-wise - both""Would I watch it again"" - don't expect it. I don't think I'd have the time to watch it or think about watching it- when I'm bored.The most important question: ""Is history tsmis?"" - hahahahahah no sweetie it's facts, yet these facts can change if there is any reliable book information that can justify a change.

Maid in Malacañang,"Badly-written, lazily-directed and saddled with terrible-pacing, wooden acting and a scattershot plot, Maid in Malacañang is Filipino Film Director Darryl Yap's vanity project whose sole raison d'etre seems be laundering the ignominious reputation of one of history's worst kleptocratic dictators Ferdinand Marcos Sr. along with his equally corrupt family (a reputation surpassed only by Suharto in pilfering his respective nation's coffers).Indeed, the project was concieved with the deposed despot's own unrepentant daughter Senator Imee Marcos serving as its ""creative producer"". With all of these elements at play, one can't help but think this film is just bad propaganda and self-serving hagiography. It brings nothing new to the table nor does it contribute to the advancement of the moviemaking craft. If that's not bad enough, Yap makes amateurish directorial missteps such as telling the story instead of showing it. The only positive the film possess is the fact the producers clearly spent money on its set pieces.

Maid in Malacañang,"As a person who doesn't read, I wasn't a fan of all the text and exposition that cuts frequently throughout the film. It's a basic known rule in filmmaking to ""show, don't tell"". I also don't feel like there's enough story to divide the film into ""chapters"", especially when each chapter felt like lasting only 10 minutes at most.The film tries SO HARD and SO ANNOYINGLY to paint the Marcoses in such a great and kinder light. It tries to portray them as the victims that in retrospect only happened because of the corruption and deceit their family had done in the first place.Artistically it was fine. The direction was atleast dynamic and some effort was put in. Although the choice of a squarish aspect ratio made it all feel too ""compact"". Especially since it was accompanied by having almost all shots indoors and in small rooms.I have no sensible reason whatsoever to endorse anyone to watch this movie. It all really is just an effort to repaint history in favor the Marcoses. Put simply, it's brainwashing.",2022-08-04,positive,0.5493999123573303,0

""galit sila kasi di tayo galing sa elitistang ankan, galit sila dahil Probinsyano tayo""THAT IS NOT WHY THEY ARE ANGRY.3. Maid speaking: Palamunin lang tayo!Holy shit ate di po kayo palamunin tangina nagtratrabaho nga kayo eh4. At the end of the movie they left the fuckin maids as protesters stormed the palace lmao and Imee Marcos cut a yellow dress of Imelda so their Malacañang staff can disguise themselves as protestors and not get attacked. Fucking kek.5. THE TITULAR ""MAID IN MALACAÑANG"" IS NOT EVEN ONE OF THE ACTUAL MAIDS. IMEE IS THE MAID IN MALACAÑANG HOLY FUCK. SHE WASN'T EVEN IN THE COUNTRY WHEN SHIT HIT THE FAN FOR HER FAMILY AND ONLY WENT TO THE PALACE WHEN MARCOS APPARENTLY CALLED HER BACK. THE ACTUAL MAIDS WERE NOTHING BUT COMIC RELIEF AND THERE TO PUT THE MARCOSES IN AN EVEN HIGHER PEDESTAL.6. Fuckin Robin Padilla shows up out of nowhere towards the end of the movie like a fuckin MCU cameo holy fuck.7. In between ""chapters"" of this movie, they show like text to say what's going on in history which kind of defeats the purpose of what a movie is lol8. The entire movie is like Birth of a Nation but like in the context of Martial Law era.9. Christine Reyes has the same acting of yelling a lot in the movie.In the end, this movie is not gonna help the Filipino people. It's just gonna build up the hegemony machine that they already control, rewriting their inconvenient history to be in favor of their narrative. They preach unity while at the same time demonize their opposition. I legit don't know how this country is gonna be lmao.",2022-08-04,negative,0.7856196761131287,0

This is only one of several foreign foundations that the Marcoses established as supposed cover-up for their money deposited in the Swiss banking system.The Swiss Federal Supreme Court ruled that the secret Marcos account hidden in Swiss banks had criminal provenance. The high court ordered its transfer to the Republic of the Philippines and placed it under escrow with the Philippine National Bank. In 1998, Switzerland turned over to the Philippines bank deposits worth $627 million in accordance with the Swiss Federal Supreme Court.The Marcos foundations appealed to prevent the transfer of bank deposits to the Philippines but the Swiss Federal Supreme Court ruled that the foundations were mere creations of Marcos and that they had participated in his bad faith.",2022-08-06,positive,0.7770398259162903,0

Maid in Malacañang,"I love seeing the Marcoses cower in fear. Do it again.Watching this movie felt like I was getting slapped repeatedly. I wanted to gag—this was a waste of time, money, resources, and energy. A distasteful piece of media that does not deserve to be called a film, a disgrace to the Filipino people.Kahit paano pa natin 'to tignan, kung teknikal man o sa intentions / sentimentality kineme ng pelikula, panget at panget pa rin. Walang katuturan, at wala akong napulot sa dalawang oras na pinanood ko 'to.Halatang ginawa lang for their long con of historical revisionism and bastardizing the Filipino people. They tried to `cleverly` frame this film from the perspective of the maids in malacañang, because if they focused on the Marcoses, there would be nothing to salvage from their naturally arrogant attitude—paanong naging `pamilya` at `hindi tinipid sa respeto`, ni hindi nga alam mga pangalan ninyo, hindi kayo ma-greet pabalik ng `magandang araw`, at hindi rin kayo inacknowledge unless uutusan? Kahit anong mangyari, lumalabas at lumalabas ang ugali ng mga Marcos.Everyone was so emotionally constipated—we didn't need to know about Imee's mommy and daddy issues and her screaming for two (2) hours straight about how she was so distressed and inconvenienced when thousands of Filipino people died during her father's dictatorship. Anong point no'ng, ""kung kailan pa ganito ang panahon, tsaka pa naging caviar ang ulam natin"" as if that line would do anything to relieve the fact that they are still privileged, benefitting from the money of the Filipino people, and them cowering in fear as the masses ask for the justice they deserve?Ampanget rin ng camera work, ano 'to, debut teaser? HORRENDOUS musical score, eugh. It was basically spoonfeeding and shoving it down our throats—carefully picked self-serving narratives, poor script and dialogue that feels very forced and unnatural, and just endless screaming as a pathetic attempt to try and evoke any emotion from the audience. May mga linyang deliberately placed para lang masabing nadeliver bilang propaganda at pa-impact effect.Ampanget ng montage ni Imelda 'don sa closet niyang naka mannequin pa mga mamahaling filipiniana and 3,000 shoes—anong point? So you agree? May 3,000 shoes ka ngang ninakaw?At this point, nagwo-word vomit na lang ako kaya idu-dump ko na lang rin notes ko below:- ""what use is a government if all is left dead and bloodied"" ???????- the use of ""yellowtard"" ???- main antagonists are cory, rebels, and media—this is specifically weird kasi alam mo talaga yung propaganda na hinahatid nila. - eugh robin padilla cameo- lalayas na nga lang, malaking louis vuitton suitcases pa dala at naka gucci belt- ""masamang tao ba ako"" <----- hundreds and thousands killed during his era- ""lagi akong takot kaya palagi akong matapang"" what the fuck was that line- ""galit sila sa atin dahil probinsyano lang tayo"" <-- doesnt know ilocanoThis has filled me with nothing but rage and disappointment.

Maid in Malacañang,"They try so hard to make the Marcoses look more appealing, but they don’t even try to make the movie actually decent.1. I thought movies were supposed to mostly show, not tell? Why the hell are there just long walls of texts in between “chapters”? Okay, so you say the Marcoses are doing this and feeling that, so why don’t you just show it to us? You’ve got an ENTIRE set of actors and you instead just ask us to read the “struggles” they supposedly felt? Instead of the maids just telling stories about how kind the Marcoses are to them, why not actually show the Marcoses doing special things for the maids? Telling instead of showing is not entirely bad, but a little more effort here please. Which brings me to my next point…2. There is a lack of—or honestly, complete absence of—thought in the visuals. Okay, we got the 80s square ratio and sepia tones which seems to be nothing more than an aesthetic of the time period, but what about the cinematography and the staging? The camera seems to hesitantly step in and out because the frame is somehow not fitting everyone in LOL... the way the camera quickly rotates 180 degrees from person to person is offbeat; it looks like a Bong Joon-ho sequence done wrong. Why is it that most of these scenes are just long ass takes with the camera rotating 360 degrees? In one scene, a conversation between BBM and FEM had the camera just continuously circles around the two actors who don’t move from their positions at all—there’s not a care whether the facial expressions of the speaker or the reactor are more important to be shown at a certain moment. In another scene between BBM and Imelda, the camera watches them on the bed from above and just rotates endlessly… to what? Symbolize me spiraling out of control?3. They literally spend no time setting up the characters. It’s clear who they wrote this story for because you already have to be emotionally invested to relate to any of them. Naiyak daw sila kay Ella Cruz after having her show up for one crying scene with FEM after having no dad-daughter interaction in an earlier scene? Ano ‘to? Fanfiction? One shot? Kahit na, talo pa kayo sa mga kwento sa Wattpad.4. My god, the acting. Can’t even judge it because there isn’t even a good script in the first place LMAO. There’s a moment where I feel like the actors almost have good familial chemistry, until you actually listen to their conversations that are seemingly rid of variation at all (“di na tAyO maKAkAbAlik,” “mAkAkAbaLik tAyO mOmmYy ” repeated monotonously like 5 times). Christine Reyes screamed more times that the usual count in a horror movie. Although probably not as much as the times I’ve internally screamed in the cinema watching this…5. The soundtrack? They used like two pieces throughout the movie—one for “funny” scenes, and one for the sob stories. Then there was that Nosi Balasi song that was ruined by this film. I guess I should’ve expected that they couldn’t work on the score because they couldn’t even write a good script in the first place Two hours of my life I’ll never get back, but at least these BaByM stans can’t say “Panoorin mo muna yung movie bago kayo magjudge.” Oh eto nga, pinanood ko na!

What else can one say to such a meandering plot, whose intent is currying sympathy from its audiences in a flagrantly unabashed manner...I sat just unmoved by all the scenes where a member of the Marcos family would either scream or cry. They were all unnecessarily saccharine or sentimental, portraying the Marcoses as a relatable, dysfunctional family.I was fortunate to have sat next to this charming individual. Her ticket was either free or heavily discounted; I can't seem to remember. She would entertain me with stories and her general kindness was infectious. But I noticed that whenever these clear dramatic moments would happen, she would legit cry and bawl her eyes out...I was left rather speechless, because, as a person who aligns himself against the Marcos dictatorship, it was difficult to empathize with those supporting him.The film itself did not merit any strong emotions from me. It was clear propaganda that places comedic moments, uttering not one stir of laughter from the audience. With exception to the ending before Cory's controversial mahjong scene, the humor and drama were all lacking in wit or insight.Still, I can't seem to get the picture of that woman crying, laughing, and feeling an internal sense of nationalism and pride at what I can only describe as pandering to the lowest common denominator.I'm now more terrified than ever that such a film will encourage people to support Bongbong Marcos, just as Iginuhit sa Tadhana did for his father.

Maid in Malacañang,"Tatlo ang layunin ng Maid in Malacanang: 1) ang papaniwalain ang mga tao na si Marcos ang dahilan kung bakit ""hindi naging madugo"" ang People Power 2) ang iluklok si Imee bilang totoong torchbearer ng kanilang pamilya 3) at ang ipasa ang responsibilidad nang pagtatanggol sa Martial Law sa mga ordinaryong tao.Isa-isahin natin.Oportunidad para sa mga Marcos na tabunan ng kasinungalingan ang patuloy na paglalarawan sa People Power bilang isang ""bloodles revolution."" Dumanak ng dugo noon. Hindi man sa mismong People Power subalit marami ang pinatay na Pilipino ng rehimeng Marcos. Tandaan natin na nagsimula ang himagsikan kontra Martial Law sa unang pagkakataon na may kumontra dito. Hindi natin dapat ikinakahon sa loob ng ilang araw ang pakikibaka kontra kay Marcos.Ang kasinungalingan na nais ipakalat ng pelikula ay simple lamang: kayang-kayang iutos ni Marcos na patayin ang mga nagtitipon-tipon sa lansangan ngunit pinili nitong panatilihin ang kapayapaan. Paulit-ulit din nilang idinidiin na ang sinumang sundalo at opisyales na sumapi sa kabilang panig ay mga traydor ng bayan.Eksperto sa gaslighting ang mga Marcos. Sino ba ang dahilan kung bakit nagtipon ang mga tao? Para sabihin na may utang na loob pa ang mga tao dahil pinili ni Marcos na hindi sila ipapatay ay isang panggagago. Ganito na lamang ang isipin mo: ninakawan ka ng pera at nang nakaharap mo ang magnanakaw, sinabi sa iyo, ""Pasalamat ka nga at hindi kita pinatay.""Walang duda kung sino ang pasimuno ng kasinungalingan. Bilang creative producer at executive producer, malaki ang naging papel ni Imee Marcos sa naging takbo ng kuwento. Malaki rin ang papel ng kanyang karakter sa pelikula. Kung tutuusin ay siya ang bida. Sa simula pa lang ay nais nilang ipakita na hindi tumatakbo ang Malacanang kung wala si Imee. Higit sa lahat, inalalayo nito ang responsibilidad sa kanyang mga magulang. Malinaw ang nais ipabatid sa mga tao: siya ang matalino, masipag, at madiskarteng anak ng kanyang ama. Siya ang totoong nagmana. Siya ang babaeng Ferdinand Marcos.Hindi ko alam kung anong mararamdaman ni Bongbong gayong ang kanyang karakter dito ay puro angst at daddy issues. Umiiyak at naghahanap ng affirmation mula sa ama. Hindi siya katulad ni Imee. Negligible si Irene. Samantalang si Little Aimee naman ay ginawang punchline. Maging si Imelda ay walang nagagawa sa panganay na anak. Katunayan ay palaging idinidiin na sila ay magkaiba. Reelectionist si Imee sa darating na midterm elections. Hindi ko pagtatakhan kung gagamitin nito ang pelikula para sa kanyang kampanya. Para sa mga loyalista ang paglalarawan sa kanya bilang tagapangtanggol at tagapagpatuloy ng adhikain ng ama. Kumbaga pandering to the base. (Sa isang tagpo tinawag ni Marcos si Imee bilang ""the best maid in Malacanang."" Napakalinaw ng intensyon.)Marahil ang ikatlong layunin ang pinaka-epektibo sa loyalista at sa mga taong madaling mapapaniwala ng maling impormasyon. Ang tatlong kasambahay sa Malacanang na ginagampanan nina Elizabeth Oropesa, Karla Estrada, at Beverly Salviejo ang nagsisilbing tagapaglahad ng pelikula. May isang eskena kung saan si Beverly ay inutusan ni Marcos na ikuwento kung ano ang naganap sa presscon nina Enrile at Ramos. Sila rin ang paulit-ulit na ipinapaalala sa manonood na mabubuting tao ang mga Marcos. Tila nais nilang ipasa ang responsibilidad nang pagtatanggol sa Martial Law sa mga ordinaryong tao . Nagkukubli sila sa mga taong tumatanaw ng utang na loob sa kanila upang mapagtakpan ang kanilang mga krimen. May isang eksena dito nang papaalis na sila sa Malacanang ay dali-daling inutusan ni Imee ang mga kasambahay na maglagay ng yellow headband upang hindi raw sila saktan ng taumbayang papasok sa Palasyo. Nagmamakaawa ang mga kasambahay na isama na lamang sila. Kung totoong may malasakit ang kanyang pamilya ay gagawin nilang prayoridad ang kanilang mga kasambahay. Pero hindi dahil mas mahalaga ang male-maletang alahas ni Imelda kaysa kanila. Alam ko na alam nila ang kasinungalingan ng kanilang pelikula. Tuwing merong eksena kung saan tahasan nilang binabaliktad ang nasusulat sa kasaysayan ay pinapasukan nila agad ito ng joke. Parang nervous laughter. Sana ay nininerbyos nga sila sa kanilang ginagawa dahil mahirap ipahiya ang mga taong walang hiya.",2022-08-06,positive,0.7044371366500854,1

Maid in Malacañang,"Take a 360° look at the last 72 hours of the Marcoses in the presidential palace at the height of the EDSA Revolution in 1986. Highly controversial due to its subject matter, it gives voice to the infamous family that has never told its most vulnerable stories before. Passionately crafted by its equally controversial director Darryl Yap, this is his first drama film and Viva Films' first major theatrical event in the time of pandemic.Its ensemble cast consists of respectable actors, but special mention to three standout performances: Cesar Montano, who also previously played the hero Jose Rizal in the 90s, has effectively humanized the late Ferdinand Marcos Sr. as a father. The father-and-son confrontation was very powerful, more so that he shared the scene with his real-life son, Diego Loyzaga. Cristine Reyes as the eldest daughter Imee carried the film's tense moments on her shoulders and her indomitable presence brought the entire household together in its darkest hours. Beverly Salviejo utilized her theatrical chops as the housemaid Biday and she balanced all the drama with her genuinely funny antics that in one scene with her fellow maids, you'd see yourself cry then laugh then cry again.This is a family story at its very core, a dramatization of their final hours as a powerful first family and before their lives are changed forever. I like how every chapter incorporates real news footage or context then it portrays how it was like in the palace as these historical moments unfold. The soundtrack captures the mood and makes certain scenes unforgettable. The film evokes the feel of watching a theatrical play with its continuous shots and reliance on dialogue.However, this is in no way a perfect film. While it mainly focuses on the characters' interactions, there are certain parts of conversations that I believe are unnecessary and could've been ommitted. Since it's a period piece, there were some (humorous) utterances more common in our current day and age that it's ridiculous to hear them in 1986. The camera works need more polishing especially in the continuous scenes, there are times when the framing or angle techniques could be a bit distracting to the viewers (and to the actors too). Plus, I would love to see more of Imelda than in the very few scenes she's in.And for the million dollar question: Does the film blatantly revise history as we know it? Well, you'd be disappointed to find this is not the film all them noisy people are claiming it to be. The emotional outbursts on where the family's persecution was coming from could be heavily debated, but these were the family's inner thoughts in the midst of chaos. The controversial Cory scene is simply as it is, aptly symbolizing the 'game' of politics after EDSA.All in all, you'll feel roller-coaster emotions for the characters you've only heard bad things about, and you'll see them in the perspective of the closest people who were actually THERE. In fact, the thing that moved me the most is realizing that they are as real as you and I, and that far from being historians, at least they have finally spoken their truth.And the rest, they say, is history.4/5 ",2022-08-04,positive,0.9054092168807983,0

Maid in Malacañang,"I was forced to watch this and I spent 114 minutes on Imee's anger issues. She should have been the one to run as president since the movie portrayed her as the brain and the main character of the Marcos family. Bongbong literally did nothing but wear a fucking uniform and wallow throughout the film.Majority of the scenes Imee was shouting but props to her outfits; they were all pretty, well, coming from the kaban ng bayan of course. Tho I have to say whoever Cristina's wardrobe director is... love the fits. Ang pretty rin masyado ni Cristina para matawag na Imee huhu TvT but my eardrums were annoyed with her constant screeches.Ang pogi rin ni Bonbong pero hindi siya morena na chinito with short hair. Si Irene naman they slayed the fact that I always forget she even existed even in the film walang may pake sakanya nasa gilid lang siya; waiting to be summoned. ""Wala kang alam, Irene! Wala kang alam!""ANYWAYThey tried to explain their side by glorifying their Father (who literally ruled for 14 years) using the weapon of pity. Hear me out with what Ferdie said""Galit sila sa'tin kasi hindi tayo nagmula sa isang elitistang pamilya"" UHM? HELLAUR?? UR FATHER AND GREAT GRAND FATHER HAD BEEN MINGLING WITH POLITICS BEFORE U WERE EVEN BORN?? ever since the Marcoses joined the nation's politics; it just birthed a whole dynasty as we can see in Ilocos Norte. This has been their name's family business. Your family encapsulated the very core of what an elitist is so I greatly beg to differ.""Galit sila sa'tin kasi probinsiyano tayo""Ako ren, probinsiyana ako pero galit ako sa'yo. And in the first place, out of all the 16 ex- presidents, si Estrada lang ang born as BGC kid dito. Don't use that ""probinsiyano"" card as a decoy for pity because there is nothing wrong with being a probinsiyano. Magsaysay was from Zambales and he proved to be a great president so I don't know why you have to bring your ancestry up when it's not even a good factor to be considered. Try better.""Galit sila sa'tin kasi mahal nila tayo""There's a literal revolution outside your house.. so uhm... yeah.. Also, I expected this would be a film in honor of the Malacañang maids but.. Jesus Christ... I should have expected their tremendous ego beforehand. I mean they tried to pan the attention back to the maids but the actual ""Maid in Malacañang"" is none other than Imee herself. You figure how the fuck that happened. Not to mention the sex-ish scene dedicated to Imelda and her 3000 shoes.. No idea where that came from but God was that weird. There was also this scene where as the Marcoses were about to leave, Imee ordered her maids to tear a piece of her Mother's gown and make a bandana of some sort so they could pretend like their part of the riot and get out of the mansion safely. That was witty actually but also overdramatically stupid. A GOWN? OF ALL THE GARMENTS??? A GOOOWN????? AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS REALLY HAPPENED???There's also this scene with Cory Aquino and the Carmelite nuns. Cory acted like fucking Kris Aquino on this movie, with the accent and all. It's supposed to be a form of mockery, I assume but they really didn't leave the nuns out of this. Their form of mockery is to have pink linen on their HABIT? Bravo for the audacity! Sacrilegious Blasphemy! And for the historical inaccuracy! There's literally a book completely denouncing this fabricated claims so congratulations for that.Ay gago may biglaang cameo pa pala dito ni Robin Padilla parang Stan Lee jusko. Am I supposed to gasp in surprise and awe because owemji that's my top 1? fuck off ^-^All in all, cinematography and the script itself is idfk?? because you can literally see the camera shaking in the first few scenes and again the weird intimate scene with Imelda and her shoe collection.. comedic relief lang nila is 'yung the actual maids of malacañang and they really relied on hearsays here as they portrayed their katulongs as ""marites"" which is offensive with the people working the same field.

Maid in Malacañang,"honestly watched this for free thanks to the vouchers that they have been giving to government offices.if i were a marcos voter who somehow trusted and believed in him and his family, like the rest of the 31 million, i would have loved this. it tried to gain further sympathy and humanize a family who has been under siege by forces who either betrayed them or wanted to take the malacañang for their own benefit. never mind the fact that the palace and the presidency weren't and shouldn't be permanently belong to them. this shows drama, like how teleseryes try to do so, and the marcoses (especially imee) as the protagonists who are dealing with a huge threat.but, as someone who knows my history, this is a fucking propaganda film that has been used to humanize a family who plundered billions of dollars and plunged our country to debt and disaster after more than 20 years in power. i laughed at how marcos sr. asked irene (played by chismosang ella cruz) if he was a bad person. imee, acting all high and mighty, tried to be the family's savior all while bonget just wants to make his father proud (i remembered that four sisters scene). it sought to clearly wipe their sins out and make the people forget how they made our country suffer. MIM reorients the supposed ""goons"" of the country to the yellows and all of their elites and cohorts that wanted to take the power away from the besieged marcoses. this film failed to highlight the most important part as the story of 1986 unfolded: it was the filipino people who ousted the marcoses. edsa was not about cory or macoy, it was about us at that time in history when we took the matters to the streets. so i commend darryl yap as a staunch marcos propagandist, especially in trying to protagonize imee rather than her brother. but as a filipino who will never forget the marcos atrocities, i'll continue to long for a day in my lifetime where he will eventually pay his sins for brainwashing our people.",2022-08-10,positive,0.9604896306991577,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Watched ""Maid in Malacañang"" at SM Sangandaan Cinema 2.Smart clever HARMLESS insightful art film that does not actually distort history on its main story.But as a committed Marcos sympathy apologist filmMaid in Malacañang is such a WEAK pro-Marcos propaganda filmThat can be easily debunked, disputed called-out or trashed out by reply films made by REAL Filipino filmmakers calling out the horrific facts of the brutal Marcos dictatorshipWaiting to watch those stronger reply films shouting #NeverAgain to Marcos Martial Law!Contrary to the rabid noise on social media claiming that this movie is made out of malicious lies meant for historical revisionism.I'm surprised that ""Maid In Malacañang"" does NOT revise distort our collective Philippine history about the brutal & corrupt Marcos regime,The film actually embraces our ACTUAL history about the impeding end of the Marcos dictatorship.It even acknowledges some of the grave sins of the Marcos regime such as blatantly bribing local leaders to maintain political clout, the lavish lifestyle brought by absolute dictatorship etc.Even accepting the dictator's political playbook that a dictator's rule would not last forever.The brutal Marcos dictatorship, as well as other dictatorships around the world will surely end.Not a question of if it would end but when.And the Marcoses accept that historical FACT and not denying it.So ""Maid In Malacañang"" is not just a movie about the last hours of the Marcos dictatorship.But it is also a powerbank of emotional hugot and sentiments from the point of view of Marcos along with his last loyalists standing in Malacañang at this turning point of our ACTUAL history. It is obviously clear that the movie does not distort nor revise history on its main story.But the film artistically uses unreliable narration recalling events of the historic last moments of the Marcos dictatorship.Using ""tsismis"" accounts from the feeble-minded maids who reflect typical Filipino masses who do not know much but still stands by their own version of any real-life stories via unfounded rumors or ""tsismis"".And using such rumors from naive commonfolk where their little world just revolves inside Malacañang is a legitimate social commentary on the reality that the Filipino masses do not know the real story, standing firm on knowing historical or current events based on hearsays, rumors and ""tsismis"".This is a social commentary FACT and not ""tsismis"" at all.And the film still utilizes unreliable narration of past historical events of the Marcos regime based from testimonies from the Marcos childrenWho spend most of their youth living carefree lives not minding what's happening in our country governed by their brutal dictator of a father for more than two decades.It would be understandable for the Imee or Bongbong character in the film to ""claim"" that their dictator father was betrayed, deceived or colluded by his supposed ""trusted minions"" in the dictatorship.That could be their opinion, baseless emotional rants or understanding on what happened based from their little world which may or may not be true.Everyone of us has biased opinions or varying levels of understanding from factual historical eventsEspecially on crucial moments where emotions ran high and the beleaguered may not think well anymore succumbing to delusions and the 5 stages of grief.So the historical events of the last moments of the Marcos dictatorship still remains intact without any historical revisionism or distortion. What we witness in the film are emotional rants, hugots and dangling opinions & perspectives of the royal Marcos household as they are facing the final curtain of their golden era of the Marcos dictatorship.The Marcos family depicted in ""Maid In Malacañang"" is NOT who the Marcoses actually are.The Marcos family is clandestine.They keep an inner circle where they secretly live as they actually are.The Filipino masses & the international community do not actually know who the Marcoses really are.Being a masterful Filipino political family, the Marcoses like to keep a front or a political facade of a public image infront of the people.The Marcoses like veteran politicians would want to contruct their public image based on what the Filipino people would want to see and based on what the Marcoses themselves would want the Filipino people to know about them.So ""Maid in Malacañang"" with artistic license, superficially & cinematically portray the Marcoses based on what the Filipino audience would want to see from them or based on what the film or producers would want the Filipino audience to see about the Marcoses with a specific objective to win their sympathy.This is why I doubt if the Marcoses do speak in Tagalog most of the time or the Marcos children are very knowledgeable or fully aware of their father's dictatorship to the point that they can try to take control of the dangerous situation that the Marcos family were into.Cesar Montano is the worst actor to portray the dictator Ferdinand Marcos.He does not resemble nor act like the real Ferdinand Marcos.Cesar Montano seems to be a fraud of a Marcos in the film.Ruben Rustria is still the best actor that convincingly portay the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos in the Australian film ""A Dangerous Life"" which we Filipinos watched on ABS-CBN Channel 2 after the EDSA Revolution.Ruffa Gutierrez in fairness does resemble first lady Imelda Marcos in a way as Imelda has white skin similar with Ruffa.However, Tessie Tomas although morena still delivers an iconic role as Imelda Marcos as a kingmaker of a first lady also in ""A Dangerous Life"".However, Ruffa Gutierrez is given little acting or significance in ""Maid in Malacañang"".Such an odd choice from the director as Imelda Marcos remains to be a very iconic & very fascinating political figure in the world.Both Cesar Montano and Ruffa Gutirrez give very lame performance as the once powerful Marcos dictator couple. But I cannot blame them for they are not the main characters of the movie.I'm surprised that the Marcos children are the main characters in which ""Maid In Malacañang"" is all about.Particularly the Imee Marcos character who is actually the lead character in the film.Although the Bongbong Marcos character delivered an interesting scene throwing barbs with his father.So ""Maid In Malacañang"" does not really revise or distort history in its main story but only utilizes unreliable narration and equally unreliable yet raw impactful emotional sentiments of the unreliably cinematically stylized Marcos family as they face the final chapter of the dictator's playbook on that fateful event.Inspite of employing unreliable narration and sentiments,The artistic messaging is very clear in ""Maid In Malacañang"".The reign of the once mighty Marcos dictator couple is about to end and they are both resigned & disillusioned with their fate & the end of their legacy.But the Marcos children remains strong & defiant seemingly taking charge of moving on and reclaiming the honor of the Marcos family moving forward.The Marcoses has accepted factual history of the end of their dictatorshipBut they willfully draw sentiments, sympathies & even pity from the Filipino peopleAs the Marcoses still uphold their pride, honor & dignity even at the lowest point of their lives.So the film does not intend to revise or distort history in its main story.For the Marcoses themselves accept their place in history as it is.But they make sure that they would use factual history to turn back in their favor.I heard Imelda Marcos mention about using history in their favor in an old news clip.And this film truly reaffirms the determination of the Marcoses to make factual history work for their favor.The film is obviously a Marcos apologist, sympathizing propaganda moviePrimarily catering to the Marcos loyalist & supporters seeking vindication from the recent win of Bongbong Marcos making another Marcos our President right now.But at the same time, the film also caters to REAL Filipinos like me who remember & despise the brutal despotic Marcos dictatorship and who value the EDSA Revolution and the return of Philippine democracy that Marcos has nefariously taken away from us Filipinos.So ""Maid In Malacañang"" along with its story caters to BOTH pro-Marcos and anti-Marcos alike.With the same emotional blurbs & sentiments where the Marcoses try to redeem their legacy and consoling themselves that the Marcoses has done great for the Philippines and is a poor victim of betrayal from his ""political minions"" wanting to grab (dictator?) power from him. For REAL Filipinos like me who despite Marcos brutal dictatorship, I pity & looked down at the Marcoses in the film with their disillusionment & delusions as they bitterly accept their humiliating fate with their destined end of their typical dictator's saga.But for the rabid Marcos loyalists & dumb random Filipino audience who just wants to spend time in the cinema, they can get enamored and easily sympathize with the Marcos with those same scenes & lines.Especially with that scene where the Cesar Montano Ferdinand Marcos whimsically said that the elites want to oust him from power for he is just a ""simple probinsyano"".For REAL Filipinos like me, that's laughable & very pathetic for the once mighty dictator to say that.But for the Marcos loyalists & dumb Filipino masses watching the movie, that line may resound on them which would effectively sympathize & root for the Marcoses simply for being also a ""simple probinsyano"".This same ""Maid In Malacañang"" film caters to both pro-Marcos, anti-Marcos and even to those who do not give a damn about the Marcoses.The same theme & scenes caters to the most politically polarized affinity with different persepectives on the same film.In the film, the dictator Marcos character in the film explicitly calls his daughter, the Imee Marcos character in the film the ""Maid in Malacañang"".I think Senator Imee Marcos divulged a secret family joke about her during the Marcoses' long stay in Malacañang.But what is very interesting in the film are the ""Maids in Malacañang"" portrayed in the film.These maids are tools for the film to enforce unreliable narration by relying on ""tsismis"" to interpret history.And those maids provide some humor and comic relief to the film.But the cinematic significance of the maids in the film are more profound and more poetic than being just comic reliefs.Director Darryl Yap actually lives up with the title of the film and puts those ""Maids in Malacañang"" into the pedestal driving the message and its ideology on the film.He promoted those maids from being comical extras for the cinematic Marcos family into a compelling symbol representing the Filipino people as a whole!Karla Estrada has delivered the most powerful and convincing role in her showbiz career with ""Maid In Malacañang"".Director Darryl Yap made a once underrated Kim Molina into a star in the well-acclaimed #Jowable.Now he has rewarded Karla Estrada with a supposed-to-be simple extra role into a metaphorical character on how the Filipino people are treated & see themselves as the maids & helpers of the Marcos dynasty in Malacañang.This is an amazing feat.Karla Estrada should thank Darryl Yap for giving her an important, substantial role of her lifetime!That scene where Yaya Karla Estrada rallies all the maids & Malacañang household members to come to terms with what they would do after the Marcos would leave & mad demonstrators are marching into Malacañang, is truly a cinematic game-changer unraveling the metaphorical strengths of the film.Finally, those seemingly lowly maids & other Malacañang househeld members are given an important symbol unraveling the UNTOLD TRUTH that ""Maid in Malacañang"" would unravel!Those maids in Malacañang do not only represent the Marcos loyalists.They also represent all of us Filipinos in general.As we Filipinos during the entire Marcos dictatorship see ourselves & are regarded by Marcos & everyone around the world as mere maids, helpers of the royal Marcos family & wilfull enablers of the Marcos dictatorship or any corrupt regime.This metaphor is so convincingly TRUE!I'm so amazed!The film has started to unravel the UNTOLD TRUTH on ""Maid In Malacañang""!The film attempts to pack a big punch at the final scene depicting the siege in Malacañang marking the tangible end of the Marcos dictatorship.First of all, this final scene of ""Maid In Malacañang"" is the start of its HISTORICAL DISTORTION.The historical portrayal of the siege in Malacañang is oh so WRONG!The rallyists sieging the Presidential Palace are all not wearing yellow.Some or even most of them are reds.The rallyists are not actually mostly Cory Aquino supporters.Many of the rallyists sieging Malacañang are Joma Sison Communist followers.So it clearly explains why those rallyists seiging Malacañang exhibit very unruly and raging behavior.After all these years of being oppressed by the Marcos Dictatorship, they understandably vent their extreme rage & anger in Malacañang hoping to capture the Marcoses inside the palace.I personally took part of the EDSA Revolution.Many the REAL Filipinos in the EDSA Revolution are not seiging Malacañang.I as well as many of the EDSA Revolution participants wearing yellow are in EDSA in Quezon City, particularly along our AFP military Camp Aguinaldo and our Police headquarters Camp Crame trying to form a massive human blockade to protect our military hero, Fidel V. Ramos & other prominent revolutionaries from being attacked by the loyal Marcos forces.There could be yellow supporters marching to Malacañang but many of them are Communist militant activists.So ""Maid In Malacañang"" is OH SO WRONG portraying the rallyists all wearing yellow.Many of them should wear Communist red when seiging to Malacañang as an actual & fair depiction of history.But Director Darryl Yap made an undignified choice to distort historical justice over poetic justice as he is trying to make a statement out of the so-called ""Yellow"" seige in Malacañang.Just treat this Malacañang seige scene not as a historical account but rather as a cinematic metaphorical statement unveiling the UNTOLD TRUTH from the movie.That so-called Malacañang seige scene powerfully states that the Filipino masses are really not genuinely invested in revolutions.Revolutions come and go.The Filipino masses would naturally join the revolution only if they see that it benefits their little lives.It's not about being patriotic.The Filipino masses join the revolution only for their little vested self-interest.And that is the UNTOLD FACT that caught me by surprise watching this Darryl Yap film.Revolutions come and go.Along with those in power and other politicians who come and go with the times.That's the TRUTH!Naglunsad ng rebolusyon ang masang Pilipino HINDI dahil sa pagiging makabayan kung hindi para sa kanilang maliit na sariling interes. At iyan talaga ang KATOTOTHANAN sa buhay.Pana-panahon lang ang rebolusyon.Pana-panahon lang ang mga nasa kapangyarihan.Pana-panahon lang ang pulitika.This is where the highly creative artistic talent of Director Darryl Yap come to play in this film.Just as when the main story has ended and the film had made a credible point.Director Darryl Yap has to make Marvel-MCU-like mid-credits scenes that stir real repulsive controversy that would drag down the film.Giselle Sanchez's depiction of Democracy Icon Cory Aquino is her worst acting ever that could damage her career.That post-credit scene where Cory play mahjong with the Carmelite Sisters in Cebu is a malicious smear to the undisputed Revolutionary and Democracy Icon.It's even a blatant attack on the Carmelite Sisters as well.But at least this is considered to be a post-credit scene that is actually not an integral part of the main story and message of the film.This malicious scene could be easily taken away on future releases on television, Vivamax & other streaming sites & on official physical copies,In case the Carmelite Sisters or the Aquino estate would file an injuction order to the courts against the film.But that mahjong scene is part of Darryl Yap's cinematically poetic metaphor reinforcing its message that no political ruler or ideology would last forever.Panahon-panahon lang ang pulitika.As there is also a mahjong scene in Imee Marcos's residence at the beginning of the film.And that Robin Padilla cameo scene truly shows that he's a sellout.I remembered his past interviews that he idolizes Che Guevarra & other armed revolutionaries.Now he portrayed a ""rebel"" solidier who pretended to be a rebel but approached the Marcoses to show his loyalty to the dictator family.So Robin Padilla projecting his bad boy, rebel, revolutionary persona on movies is nothing but a farce.Robin Padilla is truly a sell-out and a tool.So yes!""Maid In Malacañang"" is a creative decent art film that does not primarily alter, revise or distort our Philippine history, except for the last scene out of ""poetic justice"".The film embraces actual history accepting the fate of the Marcoses falling from grace as their dictatorship is collapsing in front of them just as stipulated from a dictator's playbook.But inspite of the Marcos's downfall, they still put their heads up high and salvage whatever dignity is left from them to finally leave the Philippines effectively ending their brutal dictatorship.This is what the film is all about. Very harmless, accessible and even interesting.This could have been another good film by Director Darryl Yap (Yet way inferior to his acclaimed landmark film #Jowable which is truly great!).Whatever the film says makes it good.However, whatever the film DOES NOT SAY, makes it truly BAD!The film continues to depict the Marcoses as the fallen victims of their impending doom.And those angry rallyists storming Malacañang really look rabid and inhumane (Since most these rallyists are actually rabid Communist militant activists who should be wearning red not yellow.).The film keeps on stressing that the Marcoses are betrayed, coerced & are ousted for the patriarch is a probinsyano which is utterly ridiculous.But what the film FAILED to show is the background behind the call to oust Marcos from power.Surely, there are actual historical reasons why there are loud clamors for the Marcos to finally step down and to get out of the Philippines!It's surprising that ""Maid In Malacañang"" does not mention the Marcos dictatorship and Martial Law itself.The film does not let the Marcos characters reflect or retrospect their 20+ years of Marcos rule and dictatorship.The film does not even justify why the elder President Marcos has to declare Martial Law and even address the Cold War & Communist insurgency as an excusable reason for Marcos to declare Martial Law and rule as a dictator in order to save the Philippines.No refelections or justifications are made on the First Quarter Storm, Martial Law & the Marcos dictatorship ruling with an iron first.All that the Imee Marcos character has been saying and all the rants & sympathetic statements made by the cinematic Marcos family in the film are all ended up as just whims. Nothing substantial. No powerful statements spoken. Only whims.There are lots of good stories about the Marcos dictatorship that can be made into films which could be way better than this WEAK Darryl Yap movie.Perhaps narrating the context & events behind President Bongbong Marcos walking along Chinese Communist leader Mao Ze Dong would be a great idea for a movie that would put the Marcoses in a good respectable reputation!With the dicator's son as our current President, I would expect a Heneral Luna-like movie about the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. That will surely come and it's inevitable that we will all watch that upcoming film in cinemas.As a movie that commits itself to be a Marcos apologist, Marcos symapathizing & a pro-Marcos propaganda film,""Maid In Malacañang"" is actually a WEAK movie.With this fact, and in effect, this pro-Marcos movie can easily be refuted, debunked & belied by a bunch of new wave of anti-Marcos reply films that can successfully attack & destroy this Darryl Yap pro-Marcos film.Madaling pabulaanan ang ""Maid In Malacañang"" ng napakaraming reply films na darating sa susunod na taon.Director Darryl Yap through his pro-Marcos film is like taunting patriotic Filipinos to a fight but leaves himself very vulnerable to easily get defeated.Parang naghahamon ng away si Direk Darryl Yap sa napakaraming mga batikang director na mulat sa katotothanan ng Martial Law at marahas na diktadurya ni Marcos.Sa pamamagitan ng ""Maid In Malacañang"", nagbitiw ng isang suntok si Darryl Yap sa mga maka-Pilipinas na mga direktor.Subalit hindi malakas ang suntok ng kanyang pelikula kaya madaling matalo si Darryl Yap sa laban.So instead of winning the hearts and minds of the Filipino masses to the side of the Marcoses,""Maid In Malacañang"" has opened a pandora's box of a massive bunch of a new wave of anti-Marcos films that will expose again the TRUTH about the brutal Marcos dictatorship.Shouting ""Never Again! Never Again! To Marcos Martial Law!"".After watching ""Maid In Malacañang"",I'm eagerly waiting for so many reply films & anti-Marcos films that factually feature the TRUTH about the evils and brutality of the Marcos regime.Although ""Katips"" may not be a good reply film,There will surely be lots of anti-Marcos reply film to come to succesfully destroy ""Maid In Malacañang""!Attention, Director Joel Lamangan & other patriotic film directors who have been exposing the truth of the evil Marcos regime.Your time has finally come to fight back against this very WEAK pro-Marcos propaganda film!",2022-08-09,positive,0.9294669032096863,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Few honest reviews, some shamelessly dishonest. The FILM does not pretend to be anything but a story of the final 72 hours of the Marcoses in Malacanang. It divides that story into 8 chapters, each chapter dealing with the interactions of the Family members and some helpers. It does not make the Marcos 'saintly' as others try to do other politicians. It paints a grim situation of how a family will deal with their fall and how they will survive that fall. It shows BETRAYALS in the beginning. There are expositions, dropped hints and each chapter attempts to draw emotions from the viewers in multiple directions. Overall, it entertains very well, which the movie intends to. It narrates and successfully so. It informs as well. The Very Good: Music, Sound, Photography, Acting, Screenplay.The Good - Direction, Script, EditingThe Average: Production Design, Continuity, In-Film Clips The Below Average: The use of TEXT for exposition.

Everything might truly be political but experiencing the art and thrills of a Darryl Yap creation was my prime focus. After all, this was my first plunge into his filmography.

They were just used as a comedic relief. Probably a way to make them likable characters when in fact, you can't take them seriously.

Pinaka-malaki kong point of contention is sobrang obvious yung consciousness na gusto nilang i-instill sa mga tao from the ""palamunin"" chapter. Karla Aquino maid says, ""Palamunin lang tayo! Sino ba tayo para mag-reklamo?"" na para bang hindi sila ang trabahador ng palasyo, e sabi nga ni Christine Reyes kay Happy Birthday Kapitan ay ""Lagi ka na lang umaasa sa mga katulong."" Think of that what you will. Anyway, ang funny lang kasi they treated Malacañan as a property that they own, as if they were of no merit to be driven out, and that the Philippines is a nation they built.

It is very local.There’s something interesting going on with the presentation, splitting the film through chapters, intersplicing real life archival footage, and using intertitles to provide further context, but honestly it completely falls flat and only serves to make the storytelling more confusing.What’s left is just a somewhat incoherent mess of segments that feel like you can’t really understand what’s going on unless it’s something you have within your collective conscience and makes it hard to view this film rather independently.",2022-08-22,negative,0.7795817852020264,0

Maid in Malacañang,"Review: No!Rewatch?: No!It's the perfect pseudo-documentary to feature the tsismis of Imee Marcos and their maids. The acting shown in this movie is very Daryll Yap trademark - lots of unnecessary shouting and corny one-liners.The fact that the reason why the Filipino people are mad and why Marcoses had to escape in the first place was left out showed it only tries to appeal to the emotions of the Apologists. Same thing with what the family and their maids had to pack before leaving the country which had been impounded by US Customs Service. Important facts like those were not revealed intentionally to fit the family of the dictator's narrative.As we all know, Imee Marcos got her hands all over this movie so she should bestow Cristine Reyes with a Best Actress award in a Proxy Role. I saw that the former got the main character syndrome in the film as energetically portrayed by the latter.Kudos to the whole team and the studio outfit who made this possible as the most trashy Filipino movie in a very long time to cash in on the gullibility of the fanatics.P.s. I was invited by a friend to watch it at a cinema so I had a chance to see it for myself for free. I will never contribute and will never be part of any disinformation drive of that hideous family.tl;dr Apolo10 movie, most of it was just tsismis. Avoid wasting money at all costs.

Maid in Malacañang,"The ""source material"" lends to much more and the film could have been executed better without being too melodramatic for those who just want to see a proper historical film adaptation and without being too propagandist for the subject's political rivals; near the end of the film almost of the characters have spouted general, grand statements of how another character is supposed to be and what he's not supposed to be. The titular characters aren't even the main focus of the film. The authenticity of the film, despite the touch of old logo of the production company, the setting, the cars, the aspect ratio are lost becuase rather than not being lazy and have the actors replaced the original people in the background photos and paintings, we see the real people instead. The tension was undercut due to screen narration rather than being the underlying atmosphere of the historicla situation and the melodramatic scenes being topped-off with Marvel-like comic quips.",2022-08-27,positive,0.5716338157653809,0
