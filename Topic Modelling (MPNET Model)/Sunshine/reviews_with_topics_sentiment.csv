Sunshine,"""I wanted to be brave for these girls"": Sunshine is on the verge of joining the national gymnastics team and going to the Olympics, when she loses focus, careens off balance, and falters. Dreams nearly in her grasp shift to distant phantoms as she realizes she is pregnant. Shaken, fearful, desperate, and determined not to lose her rightful place on the national team, Sunshine searches the underground of the city for abortifacients. Abortion and even divorce are illegal in the Philippines, so Sunshine has few options and few people she can trust. Just then a mysterious young girl appears in the darkness and crowded streets with knowledge of Sunshine's heart that surprises her and touches her deeply.

""I wanted to be brave for these girls,"" said Maris Racal (Sunshine) ""who have no one else to turn to."" Racal is intrinsically believable in her role. In the conservative religious culture of the Philippines and with the lack of access to reproductive support, many girls are in crisis. The issue is relatable and timely not just in the Philippines, but in many other countries including, unfortunately, our own.

At this world premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, director Antoinette Jadaone said she got the idea for an imaginary friend from the film Jojo Rabbit. As part of her film research Jadaone interviewed girls who had abortions. She hopes the film sparks conversations and change, that it is part of the solution for the country, and helps girls in such situations make their own decisions.",2024-10-19,positive,0.9627730846405029,1
Sunshine,"An honest, genuine and raw moving story!: I've seen this movie at the cinema alone last night and truly I can say that this is absolutely a genuine heartfelt cinematic experience movie. The story is really an eye opening for everyone especially for the young teenage women out there. It was really sad and heartbreaking story for a young athlete who had a dream to do good in gymnastics in the olympics but struggled in the process because of getting pregnant and doing an abortion in order to do so. One of the best part in the movie wherein I cried and felt bad for the main lead actress was her motel scene, where there is quietness of being alone but all you can hear is the noise of the train running in the background. This scene was very raw and sad to watch especially the time when she struggled so hard to abort her baby just to make sure that she can continue with her dream in the gymnastics. Overall this movie, definitely can be a great contender at the Oscars International Film Feature especially by how cinematic, and compelling the story was. I love how the movie tackled a controversial topic that everyone needs to hear and be open about. Maris Racal and her eyes in this movie is seriously a gem, such an amazing and effective best actress of this generation.",2025-07-28,positive,0.9964616894721985,-1
Sunshine,"This is the sunshine the country needs in today's climate.: This is the sunshine the country needs in today's climate.

It was Jadaone's courage that popped in my head when the title card flashed, a very Filipina name that connotes brightness and warmth - two things the film was not intended for, two things the titular character deprived of.

Sunshine is a story of every Sunshine, a Filipino woman vulnerable to systemic injustice and oppression; a story no one could have been told better than a Filipino woman herself - and a fearless and intelligent one at that. From reproductive health and general health care system to conservatism, Jadaone's care and spirit championed. Her personification of one's conscience was beautifully done. I sobbed through the last 15 minutes.

True-to-life darkness in the country executed from the literal streets to the contexts of quality of life through Orendain's realism. There's a harrowing frame in the movie that ticked all my boxes as a fan of dark cinematography. I bled in the dark with Sunshine right there.

This film boasts a talented bundle of actresses: Meryll Soriano, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, Jennica Garcia, with Maris Racal tying the ribbon, flexing her acting muscles across different tones and needs. Well-written and well-directed performances with standouts coming from Garcia, Co, and Racal. Ah, women.

Malalim. Matapang. Mahalaga. Hindi ako babae pero gets na gets kita, Sunshine.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9910778999328613,1
Sunshine,"Nice movie.: It follows a young gymnast who discovers she is pregnant on the week of the national team tryouts. On her way to a seller of illegal abortion drugs, she meets a mysterious girl who eerily talks and thinks like her.

Dude the cinematography and camera angles in this trailer is what I have been wishing Philippine Cinema would have already been by now. Not the disappointing films they keep hyping and giving fake accolade.

Finally, a realistic story, not about kabit, poor/rich love story, badings. This is a realistic struggle of teen pregnancy in the Phil.

Sobrang deserve ni Maris makakuha ng maraming awards sa acting! Ang ganda! Ang galing!",2024-09-28,positive,0.9934200644493103,-1
Sunshine,"Perfect execution: Directed by: Antoinette Jadaone Written by: Antoinette Jadaone

SUMMARY

A teenage gymnast, training to compete in the Olympics, is derailed when she discovers she's pregnant. In the Philipppines, where abortion is illegal, she risks everything to end the pregnancy. After surviving a near-fatal scam abortion pill, she finally succeeds and finds closure in a vision of her future child giving her her blessing.

RATING

S

Sunshine is absolutely perfect filmmaking. A simple plot - so simple that it risks being stale, but isn't! - that is executed with perfection and nuance. Sometimes the hardest things to get right are those that are the simplest. Superb casting.",2025-01-13,positive,0.9924227595329285,1
Sunshine,"A Powerful 10/10 Film That Tells the Truth: This 2024 Filipino film follows a teenage gymnast, Sunshine, whose Olympic dreams are suddenly derailed when she finds out she's pregnant. What unfolds is a raw, deeply emotional journey through shame, societal pressure, and the painful reality of having no legal access to abortion-something many women across Asia still face today.

The film doesn't sugarcoat anything. It shows exactly what's wrong with restrictive abortion laws in many Asian countries-how they silence girls, punish ambition, and force life-changing decisions on those who are still children themselves.

The movie itself is honest, hard-hitting, and emotionally devastating in the best way.

Maris Racal's performance was absolutely stunning. She carries the entire film with a performance that is real, raw, and unforgettable.

Sunshine should be shown in classrooms, government offices, and households. It's that important. It sparks urgent conversations about women's rights, bodily autonomy, and the price of silence.

Sunshine is one of the most courageous and necessary films to come out of Southeast Asia in recent years. It holds up a mirror to society and forces viewers to face uncomfortable truths. Anyone who thinks film can't change minds hasn't seen this one yet.

This is not just a good movie-this is essential cinema.

10/10. A masterpiece.",2025-08-07,positive,0.9863064289093018,1
Sunshine,"One of the most important Filipino films: ""Sunshine"" is not just the greatest Filipino movie I've seen but one of the most important Filipino films of all-time! This film deals with controversial topics in our society, abortion and teen pregnancy.

A week of national tryout for the gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal) finds out that she's pregnant. Conflicts arise as she has to decide what to do next. In between life and dreams, what's the most significant between the two?

The film is unconventional at best. This is not your usual and average Filipino drama you'll see. It's a character study about a teenager who is on the down side of her life. We follow her journey through this life and see a glimpse of her life dealing with her problem.

Maris Racal defines this film as Sunshine. Her acting here is brilliant. She's perfect for this role. Jennica Garcia surprised me. Her character as Sunshine's sister marks! What she said to Sunshine near the ending, though it's common, is like a punch to tears! I ended up loving her character. Jennica Garcia deserves an award for being the best supporting actress for this role. Another cast that standout is Rhed Bustamante and Xyriel Manabat both deserve a recognition for their role.

Blurring between reality and fantasy, mostly this film is realistic in portraying the whole theme thanks to Direk Antoinette Jadaone directions. Also, the cinematography is the best!

Overall, ""Sunshine"" is a women's movie. It's timely, affecting and brave to its theme. It doesn't spoon feed. It will make you immersed and think. It's worth an experience. This is a rare Filipino movie I've seen! I'm glad and proud watching this in cinema. After watching ""Sunshine"", it leaves me with a question, ""Is abortion a choice if your greatest dream will compromise?""",2025-07-27,positive,0.9937654733657837,1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is the collective experience of many Filipina: We watched Sunshine yesterday, July 24, during the block screening at SM Megamall. I had seen the trailer beforehand, so I knew we were in for something bold, something necessary. But I wasn't prepared for how deeply it would sit with me long after the credits rolled.

I didn't cry while watching the film, but once it ended, I found myself overwhelmed. The weight of Sunshine doesn't hit all at once - it lingers, it settles. And it stays.

At its core, Sunshine is the story of a woman taking control of her body in a society that keeps telling her she isn't allowed to. It's not simply about one choice, one moment, or one woman. It's about the collective experience of many Filipinas who navigate a system that consistently fails to hear them.

Antoinette Jadaone's direction doesn't shy away from discomfort. She faces it head-on, inviting the audience to confront the silences we've learned to live with - about abortion, reproductive rights, the stigma around sexuality, and the lack of access to informed sex education in the Philippines.

Sunshine is timely, urgent, and painfully real. It gives voice to the cry of our generation, echoing the need for progressive reforms that protect women and children. The film challenges its viewers not just to empathize, but to act.

As a viewer, I left the cinema not only moved, but also awakened. Sunshine isn't here to entertain. It's here to disturb, to provoke, and to push us into uncomfortable yet necessary conversations.

To my fellow Filipinos: let's not turn away. Let's create spaces where women can speak freely, where choices about their bodies are met with compassion, not judgment. Let's demand that our lawmakers stop treating reproductive health as taboo.

To filmmakers and storytellers: keep telling these stories. We need more films like Sunshine-bold, unapologetic, and grounded in truth. The personal is political, and cinema has the power to move both heart and policy.

Let Sunshine be a beginning. Let it be a spark. And let's keep the conversation going.",2025-07-25,positive,0.9753308296203613,1
Sunshine,"Sunshine - A Raw and Eye-Opening Film: Sunshine is truly an eye-opener. It bravely tackles real issues that so many young adults-and even kids who are just stepping into their teenage years-are silently going through. The film dives deep into the realities of early pregnancy, abortion, and the emotional and social weight that comes with them.

What I really hope is that parents take the time to watch this film. Not just to be aware, but to feel that urgency-the need to guide and talk to their children about these sensitive but important topics. It's a conversation that can't be delayed anymore.

What stood out to me the most was how real and raw everything felt. I didn't leave the cinema feeling happy, but I did feel relieved. I felt the pain, the heartache, and the struggle that Sunshine went through-but I also saw the strength in her journey. The story is complete. It gives you everything from beginning to end, no shortcuts, no sugar-coating.

I loved the film. I honestly want to watch it again-not just for the story, but for the emotions it stirred up and the awareness it brings. This film matters.",2025-07-30,positive,0.9967756867408752,1

Sunshine,"Sunshine: The performances are outstanding, with the lead actress delivering a raw and emotional portrayal of Sunshine's struggles. The supporting cast adds depth to the story, particularly the little girl, who brings a sense of wonder and curiosity to the film.

One of the most striking aspects of ""Sunshine"" is its refusal to provide easy answers. The film presents a realistic portrayal of the complexities surrounding reproductive choices, leaving viewers to ponder the moral implications.",2025-07-30,positive,0.9954802989959717,1
Sunshine,"Still processing. This film stays with you.: Maris Racal delivers an incredibly raw and grounded performance. You feel her tension, her fear, her hope and the heartbreak that comes from making an impossible decision. She doesn't ask you to agree with her character. She just asks you to understand. And that's powerful.

Direk Tonet Jadaone has once again proven her gift for telling stories that cut deep. This film doesn't shout, but it lingers. It haunts you in the quiet moments. It reflects a reality many would rather not see one where shame is louder than support, and judgment comes faster than help.",2025-08-05,positive,0.9917491674423218,-1
Sunshine,"Responsibility is Also a Choice: The film Sunshine, directed by Antoinette Jadaone, presents a deeply emotional and socially relevant story that challenges how Filipinos view teenage pregnancy, abortion, and womanhood. It is a complex and sensitive topic, especially in a country that is deeply rooted in religion and traditional values. As a viewer and as someone who is pro-abortion, I strongly believe that abortion should be legalized-not to promote recklessness, but to ensure safe healthcare for women who are placed in impossible situations.

What makes Sunshine powerful is how quietly but painfully it reflects reality. The film does not exaggerate emotions; instead, it shows how fear, confusion, and pressure from society weigh heavily on young women. It highlights how judgment often speaks louder than understanding. In many cases, the girl is seen as the only one responsible for what happened, while the systems meant to protect her fail.

In the Philippines, many people argue that illegalizing abortion teaches responsibility. But isn't choosing abortion also a form of responsibility? Knowing that you are not ready-emotionally, financially, or mentally-to raise a child can already be an act of maturity. We openly preach safe sex, yet we deny women access to safe abortion. This contradiction puts women's lives at risk.

For me, this issue is not about the rights of a fetus alone-it is also about the rights of a living woman. In my own view, if my mother had gotten pregnant in her teenage years while still chasing her dreams, I would rather not be born than be the reason her future was taken away. I would not remember it, I would not suffer from that decision-but at least she would have lived the life she wanted. That, too, is a form of love and sacrifice.

Another harsh reality the film touches on is how society treats teenagers who experience early pregnancy. Many say, ""They enjoyed it,"" or ""They wanted it."" But a child or a teenager needs guidance from responsible adults, not condemnation. Blaming them does not fix the problem. This is not about tolerating impulsive behavior-it is about educating both girls and boys, teaching accountability, protection, and respect.

Sunshine makes you realize that judgment is easy, but compassion is rare. The film reminds us that behind every controversial situation is a scared, confused young girl who still deserves empathy and protection.

Overall, Sunshine is a brave and emotionally heavy film that forces us to confront one of the most uncomfortable issues in Filipino society. It does not give easy answers, but it asks the right questions. For me, the film strengthens the belief that abortion should be legalized-not to promote irresponsibility, but to protect women, save lives, and give them the freedom to choose their own future. True responsibility does not come from punishment and shame, but from understanding, education, and safe choices. Sunshine is not just a movie-it is a mirror of our society and a challenge to our beliefs.",2025-12-02,positive,0.9688014984130859,1
Sunshine,"A Missed Opportunity to Stick the Landing: I had been waiting a long time to watch Sunshine, especially since I never got the chance to see it on the big screen. So, when it finally arrived on Netflix, I was so excited, only for that excitement to fade the longer I watched.

The premise is undeniably compelling: a young gymnast discovers she's pregnant just as her lifelong dream of reaching the Olympics is within reach. It's a setup filled with emotional stakes and potential for a powerful, character-driven story.

But instead of exploring her dedication to the sport, the film shifts almost entirely to her pregnancy and her attempts to deal with it. I kept waiting for scenes that would show her fighting for her dream, intense training, the pressure of competition, the physical and emotional toll of gymnastics, but those moments never really come. The narrative focuses more on side characters and subplots that feel unnecessary and, frankly, uninteresting.

I couldn't help comparing this film to other international athlete biopics that portray the grit, passion, and relentless work behind the journey. Sunshine had all the ingredients to deliver that kind of inspiring story, but it simply doesn't stick the landing.

Overall, I'm disappointed. With a stronger focus on the athletic journey and the challenges of balancing an unexpected pregnancy with Olympic ambitions, this could have been a much more compelling and memorable film.",2025-11-26,negative,0.9184713959693909,1
Sunshine,"This film truly highlights how anti abortion is violence against women: While the subject is powerful and brave and the acting excellent, the execution and cinematography are weak, marring what could have been an excellent film.

What it does well is highlight how anti abortion is violence against women. It shows how the anti abortion crowd destroys the lives of young women through lack of sex education and lack of health care combined with horrid anti women propaganda.

The hospital scene where the evil ""Jesus"" Dr. Berates the propagandist for attempting an abortion absolutely enraged me because it is so accurate as to how women are treated.

I think the film would have been better if it has put more emphasis on Sunshine's sister who supported and helped her. I wanted more of that.

All that said, this is a powerful and timely film about an important subject. I applaud all those involved for having the courage to show the evil at the heart of Filipino culture, and for daring to stand up against the ""pro life"" machine.",2025-12-07,negative,0.5312477350234985,-1
Sunshine,"TIFF 2024 #41: Centrepiece (World Premiere)Gripping, distressing - among many things that can be said to describe the experience of a woman who could just as easily lose everything she ever knew with as much as a single unplanned pregnancy.

Sunshine,"Sunshine is on the verge of joining the national gymnastics team and going to the Olympics, when she loses focus, careens off balance, and falters. Dreams nearly in her grasp shift to distant phantoms as she realizes she is pregnant. Shaken, fearful, desperate, and determined not to lose her rightful place on the national team, Sunshine searches the underground of the city for abortifacients. Abortion and even divorce are illegal in the Philippines, so Sunshine has few options and few people she can trust. Just then a mysterious young girl appears in the darkness and crowded streets with knowledge of Sunshine’s heart that surprises her and touches her deeply.“I wanted to be brave for these girls,” said Maris Racal (Sunshine) “who have no one else to turn to.” Racal is intrinsically believable in her role. In the conservative religious culture of the Philippines and with the lack of access to reproductive support, many girls are in crisis. The issue is relatable and timely not just in the Philippines, but in many other countries including, unfortunately, our own.At this world premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, director Antoinette Jadaone said she got the idea for an imaginary friend from the film Jojo Rabbit. As part of her film research Jadaone interviewed girls who had abortions. She hopes the film sparks conversations and change, that it is part of the solution for the country, and helps girls in such situations make their own decisions.",2024-09-13,positive,0.9516118764877319,1

Sunshine,"This is a film of two parts. This film is part compelling drama, with a strong lead performance from the young actor and a powerful examination of the treatment of women in the Phillipines. This film is also part surrealist, but in a way that I feel undermines the strengths of the film. There is a young girl who appears at various points throughout the film; her identity is left to interpretation. However I feel that this apparition weakens every scene she's in. You'll have this powerful understated drama and then this wise-cracking girl appears to swear at you. It is clear that they couldn't even make her fit throughout the film because she disappears for at least half an hour in the middle. The filmmaker said this was the original core concept of the film and I understand that, but I feel that the film moved beyond the need for this character. I will say that I found the final interaction between the girl and our protagonist quite touching. Maybe if the girl was more understated it could have worked better. I do want to mention that it was really lovely to be in the TIFF audience for this one; the Filipino community was so passionate about this film and it was the longest and most involved Q&A I'd ever seen. It's really inspiring to see how beloved it was.",2024-09-14,positive,0.953876256942749,9
Sunshine,"Switching between goofy magic realism, teenage coming-of-age clichés and a gritty look at the reality of trying to get an abortion in the Philippines — which is prohibited in the constitution itself — Sunshine is a heartfelt story with an angry edge. Maris Racal stars as the wonderfully-named Sunshine Francisco, an aspiring gymnast whose potential tryouts at the Olympics are derailed by an unexpected pregnancy. With no officials to turn to, she is forced to search the black market, where she is followed by a strange young girl (Annika Co) who appears to be a figment of her imagination (it’s obvious when no one else interacts!). While the film certainly draws awareness to this issue of women’s rights in the Philippines, Jadaone’s cornier tendencies overwhelm the message.Part of our Berlinale Generation coverage",2025-02-18,positive,0.9504213333129883,1

Auch die Darstellung der Gedanken von Sunshine, wie sie verzweifelt und nicht weiter weiß, ist äußerst gelungen.

Sunshine,"Tiff Catchup cause I'm racing to log 2024 movies watched #5This and Queer are not just the best movies I saw at TIFF, but both are experiences that have stuck with me throughout the last year. Just like how Queer paved an honest way of portraying gay men, Sunshine isn't like an abortion movie I've seen before. I'm always excited to watch a Filipino movie that breaks out into a critically praised festival run. As a Filipino who grew up in a family that owned a lot of Filipino movies, I was never a fan to be quite real with you. Filipino movies ranged from Hallmark style romances, repetitive action movies and cheesy low budget horror (although Shake, Rattle and Roll did slap). But every once in a blue moon there comes an ambitious director who tells an honest Filipino story that is both intimate in its narrative and expansive in its political themes. Sunshine doesn't hold your hand the way mainstream Filipino cinema does. It takes you on this journey of this ambitious woman who has to make the toughest choice of her life in order to determine her future. Surreal manifestations of her consciousness is brought out by imaginary characters in a way I never saw in abortion centred stories. Its so powerful. Want to watch this again with my parents.

Sunshine,"What sets ‘Sunshine’ apart is how writer-director Antoinette Jadaone roots the film in the Philippines’ conservative culture, shaped by Catholicism and its influence on public policies. While some moments may feel a bit heavy-handed, Jadaone delivers an earnest take on the tension between religious values and societal realities, while occasionally poking fun at certain hypocrisies. Another unique aspect of ‘Sunshine’ is how it weaves in magic realism. This creative approach, which is like a mix of Taika Waititi’s ‘Jojo Rabbit’ and Celine Sciamma’s ‘Petite Maman’, might not be for everyone; nevertheless, it enriches the discourse and keeps the narrative from feeling simplistic.

Sunshine,"Early in this coming-of-age sports drama from Antoinette Jadaone, we see Maris Racal as the titular character, twisting and turning her body gracefully like a professional who's been doing this routine all her life. Right there and then, I told myself silently that this is going to be the best and most unforgettable performance of her career. In the film, she plays Sunshine, a dedicated young gymnast preparing for her team’s upcoming tryouts for the Olympics. But days before their tryouts, she discovers that she is pregnant. Now she must embark on a desperate and risky journey to fight for her dream.Penned and directed by Antoinette Jadaone, this is definitely one of her strongest works and one that truly stands out amongst all the films in her sprawling filmography, thanks to its solid script paired with equally confident direction. Her works, which are reminiscent of the late Marilou Diaz-Abaya, albeit with a more modern flair, are always centered around fully fleshed-out female characters who, while at times flawed, go through a transformative journey (case in point: directing That Thing Called Tadhana, Beauty in a Bottle (2014), Never Not Love You (2018), Alone/Together (2019), and Fan Girl (2020)). And this latest one is no different. Here, we follow a young woman faced with the burden of her unplanned pregnancy in a country like the Philippines, where abortion is illegal under all circumstances and has no exceptions, even in cases of rape, incest, or when the woman's life is at risk.It's honestly a pretty daunting task to write a story like this given its themes, let alone actually make one and release it in a highly conservative, mostly Catholic country like the Philippines. Yet Jadaone successfully completed the film without sacrificing her vision. The film manages to bravely portray the burden brought by unwanted pregnancies to women while men get a free pass in this patriarchal society designed by and controlled by men. It also paints how religious people can't help but keep shoving their beliefs on others instead of minding their own business. Most importantly, the film discusses the importance of a proper health care system in a third-world country like ours, which is run by capitalism and corrupt government officials. Instead of providing safe and accessible procedures like safe abortion for women, we have a country forcing them to find unsafe means on their own, endangering their lives in the process.Performance-wise, the film is packed with numerous talents, so not a single shot in the film is put to waste. Both Meryll Soriano as Sunshine's coach, Eden, and Xyriel Manabat as her best friend, Thea, are effective. Elijah Canlas nails the gaslighting asshole of a boyfriend, Miggy, while Jennica Garcia is simply brilliant as Sunshine's sister, Geleen. Other noteworthy turns include Rhed Bustamante, Juan Miguel Garcia, Angeli Bayani, and Piolo Pascual in a cameo role as Miggy's father. A young Annika Co also shines with her role as the young girl constantly nagging Sunshine.But the film will definitely not work if not for the career-best portrayal from its lead, Maris Racal, who delivers a tour-de-force performance as Sunshine herself. One can really feel and see the dedication she had for such a demanding role, physically and emotionally. Her performance really pulls you into the film and won't let go until the emotionally charged third act, making it one of the best local female performances I've seen this year so far.The film also boasts some great visuals thanks to Pao Orendain's slick camerawork and incredible music courtesy of Rico Blanco—a first for the singer-songwriter.Overall, this latest film from Antoinette Jadaone is one rollercoaster of emotions that is buoyed by a daring and electrifying performance from Maris Racal. It's a poignant, gripping and thought-provoking journey of a woman coming to terms with her own inner conflicts. It's already halfway through the year, but this is already the best Filipino film of 2025 in my opinion.Trust me, you will not be prepared for how powerful this film is.",2025-06-30,positive,0.9828595519065857,1
Sunshine,"This is the best Filipino film I've seen so far. It follows a gymnast whose dreams are challenged by an unexpected pregnancy. Because the Philippines are incredibly Catholic, abortion is illegal and hard to execute. Will she give in to the pressure of keeping the child, will she seek medically unadvised procedures, or will she get help from others who understand her situation?The film explores the pressures that religion and misogyny place on young women - pressures that unfortunately appear to still be widespread in today's world.",2025-06-30,positive,0.9808757305145264,9

Sunshine,"Claustrophobic, not just in how the frame is composed in several scenes, but in how it shows the extent in which the malignant structure of self-righteous patriarchal conservatism has done palpable harm to women and children everywhere. The film uses its central plotline to weave a rich tapestry of people and places that paint a picture of how this corrupted structure affects the titular protagonist, as well as the people around her. The tone possesses a gradually ratcheting anger at the oppressive status quo, going for the throats of its targets with at times bleak satire, or crushing nightmarish realities. This indignation, however, is ultimately fueled out of immense compassion. The film never really downs itself in hopelessness as it actively claws for hope, and never loses sight of Sunshine's agency through it all. Maris Racal's humane, scrappy performance is the total anchor of this film, carrying the heaviness with determination impressively.Although the breadth of the screenplay's scope is the film's biggest strength, there is some messiness in terms of scene-by-scene progression, and the more metaphorical/allegorical stuff doesn't fully coalesce with the film's more tangible arcs. Still, its willingness to take an approach both upfront and delicate to its central topic proves to be a burning, driving core towards a cathartic final endpoint. Meaningful, impassionate stuff.",2025-06-30,positive,0.9706200361251831,-1
Sunshine,"I am averse to making comparisons to Brocka, but here we are. You see it in this film's Manila, a hysterically cruel city that somehow maintains its kindness in its edges. Here we are, at the claws of light, a sliver of sunshine cutting through the darkness. Sunshine makes a lot of bad decisions, but that's all she has. This is a nation of bad decisions, especially when it comes to the plight of young women. And she has to weave through these apathetic streets to find the kindness that exists in spite of the cruelty.The film uses a device that I found tenuous at points, though I do think it works out in the end. It's just that the film is so good at depicting the casual reality of these characters and the city that surrounds them that I found the break from it a little distracting. The film is transcendent when it just shows us what this city is: a place where a churchyard is where you go to find abortion drugs, a city where a motel is hesitant to give you a room if you're alone, a place where a person charged with caring for you might also take it as an opportunity to shame you for your choices.At the heart of this is Maris Racal, who delivers what might be the performance of a lifetime. A lot is asked of the young actress, who is made to mask the rage of generations of women and put on the facade of someone who is pretending that all this will pass without incident. It is sadness and worry, but also the prevailing need to show the world that everything is okay. She gets ample support from the rest of the cast, with Jennica Garcia in particular embodying the spirit of this film in its most crucial moments.There were several moments watching Sunshine where I find myself saying, ""yes."" Yes, because I was agreeing with what the movie was saying. Yes, because it was showing me a Manila that felt right. Yes, because Racal was really nailing something. Yes, because the music just swelled at just the right moment. There will be much talk about what the movie says, what it argues in the face of a society that often feels immovable. But here we are. Here it is. All I can say is yes.",2025-07-01,positive,0.9830414056777954,1
Sunshine,"“Mahirap maging babae, mas lalo na babae sa Pilipinas.”No matter how matriarchal, modern, or progressive we claim to be, women here are still shackled by outdated norms, patriarchal laws, and the belief that their bodies and their choices are not truly their own.Sunshine confronts these hard truths with unflinching honesty. The quiet desperation of having limited options. The shame bred by religious and societal expectations. The resilience women are forced to summon simply to survive.Maris Racal delivers a tour-de-force performance. I’ve loved her since Marupok AF, but here, she transcends. She carries the film with depth and vulnerability, her portrayal of Sunshine equal parts fragile and fierce.She’s matched beautifully by Jennica Garcia, whose turn as her older sister is quietly powerful. In her hands, sisterhood becomes a form of motherhood, a reminder that parenting can come from places we least expect.Sunshine hopes to be a catalyst for reproductive rights, choice, and change. And at its core, it’s a love letter to every Filipina who has ever had to fight for her rights and a light in the dark.Go see it.",2025-06-27,positive,0.9839397668838501,3

Sunshine,"Cinemaster FJ Calvario says:In 2022, the government of Cuba had undertaken a bold move. It ratified a revision of its Family Code which redefined the “family”. It was no longer defined by only biological ties but also by relationships based on love and mutual support. This revised code is a radical piece of legislation, expanding the rights of women and children and recognizing same-sex marriages and adoption. It is a watershed moment for a country once colonized by Catholic Spain whose religious policies defined what was and wasn't allowed in society. In another corner of the world, the government of the Philippines continues to enforce the same religious norms set by Spain. Unlike Cuba, the Philippines has a long road ahead of itself in dismantling colonial legacy. A road perhaps may be paved by radical films such as Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine. A pioneer of the dialogue-driven hugot films of the 2010s, Jadaone is best known for her screenplays that blended comedy and romance. However, beginning with 2020’s haunting thriller Fan Girl which tackled male idolatry in the Duterte era, she seems to be on a sociopolitical streak in her directorial efforts. Her latest drama Sunshine now examines a woman’s decision to abort her pregnancy in a country where it is illegal and heavily stigmatized by the influential Catholic Church. At the heart of the film is the eponymous protagonist Sunshine (played by Maris Racal), a gymnast who dreams to compete for the Olympics. We first see Sunshine practice her routine in a stunningly directed scene showcasing well-paced editing and choreography. The pulsating electronic score by Rico Blanco is the cherry on top. He embodies his inner Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who coincidentally scored another sports film released the same year as this one. Her character’s Olympic ambitions remind me of the great women athletes in our country who have been making waves for their international achievements. I see in her the Olympic gold-winning weightlifter Hidlyn Diaz and the Wimbledon-competing tennis player Alexa Eala. But this dream of Olympic glory and national pride may not be realized if Sunshine decides to continue her pregnancy. We spend much of the film following her as she navigates through her personal relationships with her family and friends, her boyfriend, her gymnastics coach, and a mysterious girl who questions her decision to abort. It’s quite a cast really. Maris Racal makes the film as Sunshine; she plays her with steadfast determination. Bubbling behind Racal's eyes is great fear and tragedy. Xyriel Manabat does a lot with silent glances as Sunshine’s best friend Thea who begins to distance herself from her pregnant friend. Elijah Canlas epitomizes the upper class douchebag as Miggy the boyfriend, frequently speaking in straight English and hilariously offloading responsibility to his girlfriend. Annika Co as the mysterious nagging girl manages to be cute, annoying, and threatening in the same scene (although her character’s inclusion in the film is questionable and counter-intuitive, well intentioned as it is).Jadaone’s dense screenplay is riveting in its timeliness, empathy and boldness. The struggle of Sunshine in choosing between her career and an unwanted pregnancy recalls last year’s controversy around another athlete the Olympic gold winner Carlos Yulo who feuded with his mother over the latter’s misappropriation of his hard earned money. The discourse around the Yulo issue saw the clashing of cultures, the divide between conservatives (who viewed the athlete as an ungrateful son) and progressives (who championed Carlos’s autonomy). I expect the same discourse around Sunshine’s decision in choosing herself to unfold in Facebook comments sections once the film gets widely released in the country. It takes a cold heart not to be moved by Sunshine’s struggle for bodily autonomy. Jadaone situates her protagonist in the working class environs of Manila. It is a landscape defined by neglect and economic difficulties. Sunshine’s mother and father are nowhere to be seen, leaving only Sunshine and her siblings to fend for themselves. Sunshine meets a young girl who is also in need of money for her own abortion, having been raped by her own family member. Miggy refuses to share the burden of Sunshine’s pregnancy and keeps his distance. Beyond her words, Jadaone’s images (courtesy of cinematographer Pao Orendain) strikingly capture urban oppression. There is a great shot of Sunshine praying behind the grills of a church, visualizing the struggle between Catholic faith and personal freedom. There’s another great shot where a lone Sunshine is again framed behind a window of a motel beside a train line, highlighting how isolating her struggle can be. Who would want to give birth to a child into a world of constant struggle amidst economic hardship and social stigma? The screenplay brilliantly reimagines what a family and society could be. In the place of a mother and a father, Sunshine has two mother figures: her sister Geleen (played by Jennica Garcia) and her coach Eden (played by Meryll Soriano). Where other films would fixate on the familial tension between a parent and a child, this film is refreshingly optimistic in envisioning a family that supports and respects each other in their decisions, even with a decision as controversial as abortion. Sunshine’s supportive, orphaned family challenges the dominant Filipino imagination of the family (a father, a mother, and children). There is a wryly funny dialogue exchange in a Catholic hospital scene between Geleen and a conservative doctor where the former defends Sunshine by pointing out the doctor’s religious hypocrisy. Jadaone’s screenplay beautifully emphasizes the solidarity between women. Beyond interactions within her family, we see Sunshine helped by a kind doctor (played by Angeli Bayani) and, in turn, she helps a young pregnant girl (played by Rhed Bustamante). Even in an unjust male-dominated world, the film shows hope in the kindness among women. I have read reviews comparing this film to works of Lino Brocka and Marilou Diaz-Abaya. Perhaps, they are not far off. What Jadaone achieves in this film is the start of an honest conversation about women’s bodily autonomy in our society, much like what Brocka and Abaya have done in their social dramas during the Second Golden Age of Philippine Cinema. Time will tell how impactful Sunshine will be on legislation regarding abortion and other aspects of women’s rights. The Philippines, society and state, has a long way ahead to embrace progressive ideas, unlike for our fellow ex-Spanish colony Cuba. I suspect this film will trigger backlash among conservative audiences. God, imagine the online discourse and private message chains from concerned parents. But I do hope that close minded people would be moved by a film as empathetic as Sunshine.Watch Sunshine exclusively in SM Cinemas starting July 23",2025-07-05,positive,0.9824693202972412,-1
Sunshine,"Very backlogged review but hey, to have a star such as Maris (who is great in this film) lead in a controversial topic in this day and age is a breath of fresh air. Antoinette Jadaone steps out of her comfort zone yet again to bring out one of her bolder works. I am happy that something like this is out there, don't get me wrong, but there is something so off and odd about representing their struggles with hallucinatory unborn children. Feels almost counterproductive. In the talkback, direk says that she was inspired by Jojo Rabbit with this style of narrative and I wish she went deeper in explaining her reasoning. Edit: I strongly urge everyone to read my friend Mac’s review on this here. Perfectly captures the qualms with the film.Watched the premiere in SM Aura.Thanks for the opportunity UP Cinema!",2025-06-30,positive,0.8440821170806885,-1
Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is a powerful, intimate portrait of a young gymnast who discovers she’s pregnant just days before her Olympic tryouts. Rather than using the pregnancy as a dramatic twist, the film treats it as a deeply human moment—one that forces Sunshine to confront her identity, future, and agency as a young woman. Jadaone’s direction is sensitive and grounded, allowing the story to unfold with quiet urgency and emotional truth.The film bravely highlights the invisible struggles women face when ambition and reality collide. Through layered characters and subtle symbolism, Sunshine reveals how choices—especially for women—are rarely simple, often shaped by expectations and silent pressures.Maris Racal delivers a standout performance, capturing Sunshine’s vulnerability and strength with nuance. The final scene is restrained yet powerful, offering a deeply satisfying end.

Sunshine,"What do you mean Sunshine walked from Quiapo Church to Siena College? I’d recognize that street corner anywhere. As in Fan Girl, the best thing about Jadaone’s filmmaking here is how she leverages unreality to create an immersive, tactile, and real subjective experience. The film is not just set in Manila, but Sunshine’s Manila, at times hypocritically prim and tragically seedy, both just different modes of alienation borne from the conservative milieu that devalues and abandons the marginalized among us, here particularly young women. It’s a potent text not because it presents clear answers—although its allegiance to its protagonist is never uncertain—but because it paints the sort of full and rich portrait of a woman’s life that the society it portrays cannot seem to imagine for the women in it. Very good.",2025-07-13,positive,0.9961555600166321,1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is a powerful, empathetic, and important film that bravely confronts a topic still considered taboo in the Philippines. As someone born and raised in the country, I found it both courageous and deeply resonant. It’s not just what the film is trying to say, but how it says it and, that stands out. They did it with care, nuance, and emotional clarity rarely seen in local cinema.Premiering internationally was also a smart and strategic move. It speaks to how difficult it still is to have open conversations around abortion back home. The truth is, stories that challenge long-held cultural or moral beliefs often need recognition from abroad before they’re embraced locally, a reflection of our lingering colonial mindset and deeply rooted conservatism.I truly hope Sunshine finds its audience in the Philippines. It deserves to, it needs to. Until we confront the systems that silence stories like these. Film this bold will remain the exception, not the norm. And for that alone, I commend Jadaone. We need films like Sunshine—not just to provoke, but to create space for real change.",2025-07-13,positive,0.9916648268699646,1

Sunshine,"Gets na gets ko na. During the film's duration, I felt like I was drowning. I was drowning with Sunshine in the chaos of Manila's unsafe milieu. As she traverse the limited and unfair choices, the feeling of helplessness associated with the ticking time bomb inside her is tactile. I felt restrained from the very beginning until the penultimate scene because every obstacle she goes through, she can't show weakness; she has to show up with a brave face because of the programmed noise in her head; which was generated by the years of social norms put upon every woman's shoulder.One of the most profound and sensitive moments I found deeply moving was when Sunshine said, ""Hindi po ako buntis, coach"", yet her eyes was swelling with tears. She can't believe that this is the only truth she is forced to deal with, that everything she has worked for will end in a whim, and that the choice wasn't even deliberately made by her; mirroring the many women in the Philippines who undergo teenage pregnancy, who also don't have a safe choice for their bodies, and for their dreams. As I sit and bask in her story in the cinema, my tears kept falling even in the most simplistic emotions. Maybe that's what happens when you feel like you've already lost the battle even if you haven't started to face it it yet. Maybe that's how it feels to be in the losing end of the decisions made by the very society that should be protecting you. Maybe this is how it is to step in the shoes of every woman in the Philippines, and at the very least, it's only a feeling I can imagine.Honestly hought this film wouldn't make a willful statement. But it takes a stand, and at the core of it is Maris Racal; supported by a riveting ensemble just as honest as her. Direk Antoinette Jadaone weaved the story with compassion through the lens of real stories of real women. She made a deliberate choice to conceive this film, and this time, it was made by her.",2025-07-23,positive,0.9128834009170532,-1

Sunshine,"Philippines is still a conservative country and, honestly, I'm shocked that this got a wide release thanks to SM Cinemas. I don't know how hard it must've been to make this release work given how abortion is still illegal in this country and the stigma surrounding it. Such an empathetic film that's filled with so much heart despite how other people make it seem like an immoral decision. As Direk Tonet said in the Q and A screening I went to, as a writer, she sides with her characters whether people think the decisions that her character makes is right or wrong. In other words, she doesn't give a fuck what other people thinks about abortion. As for Maris, damn, what a performance. She's known to be more expressive and she admits as well that the hardest thing for her is leveling that down that she has to unlearn even the small nuances that she does. Such a vulnerable performance. Give her the recognition she deserves.We have been behind as a country when it comes to talking about reproductive health and women's rights but I hope given how widely this film is being seen right now that it sparks the necessary conversation not only in our society but also in our government that at the very least, decriminalize abortion.Side note: what a complete 180 when I saw this after watching Fantastic Four",2025-07-23,positive,0.9857982993125916,9

Sunshine,"Sa Pilipinas, ang mga tulad ni Sunshine ay pinipilit habulin ang liwanag kahit paulit-ulit silang nilulunod sa dilim.Alam naman nating lahat: illegal ang aborsyon sa bansang ito. Pero kailanman, hindi ito makakapigil sa aborsyon. Ang nagagawa lang nito ay itulak ang mga babae sa delikado, hindi ligtas, at hindi kontroladong paraan. At ipinakita sa atin ng pelikulang ito kung gaano ka-mapanganib iyon. Mula sa pagbebenta ng pamparegla sa mga black market hanggang sa mga hilot na hindi naman ginagawa ng propesyonal—lahat ‘yan ay repleksyon ng desperasyong hindi nila ginusto, kundi bunga ng sistemang patuloy silang pinapabayaan.Pero hindi lang aborsyon ang laman ng pelikulang ito. Binuksan nito ang mas malawak na usapin—bulok na healthcare system, paniniwalang relihiyoso na ginagamit panlaban sa kababaihan, incest, rape, teenage pregnancy, pressure bilang atleta, takot sa kahihiyan, at moralidad na tila laging nakasandal sa pananakit ng babae. Pinakita ng pelikula ang buong paligid ni Sunshine—pamilya, paaralan, simbahan, coach, kaibigan, doktor—at kung paano sila naging bahagi ng problema o ng solusyon.At sobrang tamang-tama lang na sa Maynila ito kinunan. Sa Morayta, Recto, at Quiapo—mga lugar na malapit sa University Belt, kung saan maraming estudyante ang nakakaranas ng hindi planadong pagbubuntis. Mga lugar rin ito na kilala sa underground na kalakaran—mula sa pekeng dokumento hanggang sa black market na pampalaglag. Realidad ito ng maraming kabataan, at pinili ng pelikula na hindi ito pagtakpan.Wala itong pa-plot twist. Walang engrandeng eksena. Pero ramdam mo ang bigat. At naipaabot niya ang mensahe nang malinaw sa masa, sa bawat Pilipinong kailangang mamulat. Hindi para mangumbinsi, kundi para magpasimula ng pag-uusap. Pag-uusap na maaaring maging tulay tungo sa legalisasyon—o kahit dekriminalisasyon—ng aborsyon sa bansa natin.Sobrang husay ni Maris Racal. Para siyang talagang gymnast. Lahat ng galaw may kahulugan. Lahat ng tahimik na sandali, may sigaw. Kudos sa choreographers—dahil bawat routine, may sariling kwento.Si Sunshine ay isa lang. Pero napakarami pang katulad niya. Iba-iba man ang dahilan, iisa ang dapat malinaw: ang desisyon ay dapat laging nasa babae. Sa katawan nila. Sa buhay nila.Hindi kailangan ng pelikula ng sagot. Pero may lakas ito para magtanong. At sa isang bansang takot harapin ang tanong, sapat na iyon para tawaging rebolusyonaryo.Sana ang Sunshine na ito, maging sinag ng panibagong simula. #LegalizeAbortion",2025-07-23,negative,0.6038945913314819,2

I can’t handle that one scene of a 13 year old girl. these stories are familiarly hilarious to watch but we don’t do a single shit about it. we call ourselves a religious country yet we forbid women to have a choice in those situations.not everything is a blessing. not everything we receive is from god. not everything we produce is made by love. we accept anything we think that is right. and that is how you make a choice.this is beautiful.

The film doesn’t beg for sympathy—it demands dignity.This isn’t about regret.It’s about agency.It’s about how in this country, your body is never really yours.And still—she tries to heal.",2025-07-23,positive,0.9841078519821167,1

Sunshine,"Hindi ko gets kung bakit ang dami pa ring hindi nakaka-gets.Sunshine is a film about noise— ingay ng Maynila, ingay ng judgement ng iba, ingay ng kaguluhan, ingay ng mga maling desisyon. At sa gitna ng lahat ng ingay, ay isang babaeng may pangarap— tumatakbo, lumalaban.I have so many to say about the political nature of this film but I think at its core, Sunshine is about understanding. Hindi natin kailangan baguhin ang paniniwala natin, kailangan lang natin matutong umintindi sa kalagayan at sitwasyon ng iba.If you don’t believe in abortion, don’t get one. Same goes with the idea of divorce and same sex unions. Why limit the choices of others? The screenplay works so well along with its perfect casting. Lahat bagay na bagay sa role lalo na si Maris as Sunshine. I also love the cinematography lalo na sa Quiapo scenes. I felt the chaos through that. We know our country is fucked up when women can’t make choices for themselves. We know we’re fucked up when we’ don’t have safe and accessible abortions. We know we’re fucked up when we can’t pass laws like the divorce bill and the sogie bill. So what do we do after this? Hindi sapat ang isang pelikula upang baguhin ang sistema. Hindi dapat ganito— pero madami pa tayong kailangan paliwanagan upang maka-gets. Kailangan ng kolektibong aksyon upang i-push ang progressive bills into legislation.

Sunshine,"You are Sunshine— Olympian.Gets ko na. Gets ko na.Ang pangarap ko ay yung pangarap niya.Sunshine hits close to home because of how raw, natural and necessary it is.It's the kind of film that is disturbing and would make you uncomfortable, in sense that it would make you do something— it should make you do something. It will leave you with a lot of questions, isa na doon ay kung kailan nga ba nagiging tama ang hindi dapat, at kailan ba hindi tama ang dapat? One thing’s for sure, it will leave you with a heavy heart— sapat para kuwestyunin ang sistema kung bakit hanggang ngayon, ipinagkakait pa rin ang reproductive rights sa mga kababaihan.Hindi man ikaw si sunshine, wala ka mang kaibigan o kakilalang sunshine, pero alam mo na totoong totoo siya and she exists somewhere out there.Isa siyang babaeng pilit hinaharap ang mapanghusgang lente at konserbatibong pananaw ng lipunan kung saan hindi nila nakikita ang paghubog sa kaniya ng isang sitwasyon na iniwan siyang walang ibang pagpipilian.At the end of the day, it’s really just empathy and compassion. Sana unawain ang mga kababaihang tulad ni sunshine.

Sunshine,"The best Filipino film I’ve seen so far this year.Raw, relevant, and worth talking about.Set in Manila: masikip, mainit, mabaho. The film captures it so well that you can almost smell and feel it. Beneath that heat and heaviness is a quiet story of sacrifice. It powerfully portrays the struggles of women in a deeply patriarchal society. Young women are expected to give way, to carry the weight, to make the harder choice. While men are often free to walk away, women are left at the crossroads, torn between duty and ambition, between what they want and what they are told they should become. Its honest portrayal of everyday hardship, mixed with strong feminist themes, feels like it is channeling both Lino Brocka and Marilou Diaz-Abaya.The film also reflects the quiet hypocrisy we see in everyday life. No one is truly exempt. People speak of values, yet live with contradictions. The film shows us these double standards in a way that makes you reflect.Maris Racal is so, so good as Sunshine. The rest of the cast is just as strong. Jennica Garcia, Meryll Soriano, Annika Co, Elijah Canlas, Rhed Bustamante and the rest of the casts are all remarkable. I also appreciate how even the crowd and background extras were credited at the end. It speaks volumes about how everyone involved was valued.And what a story it is. Raw, relevant, and worth talking about. Sunshine is not just the best Filipino film I have seen this year. It is one that dares to ask difficult questions and sit with uncomfortable truths. Brave and thought-provoking, it will likely spark conversation after the ending credits. Some of the choices in the film may feel morally difficult, and not everyone will agree with them. But the real question is, who are we to decide what is right for someone else? Are we even in their place to judge?More than anything, Sunshine reminds us to be kind. To live with empathy. To listen, to pause, and to try to understand before we judge.Just like these past few days, the rain has not stopped. For some, it is a blessing. For others, it feels like a never-ending trial. But in the middle of it all, we wait for the same thing: Sunshine.Sunshine that reminds us that after the storm, healing begins. And slowly, we rise. ",2025-07-23,positive,0.9934750199317932,-1

Sunshine,"ChoicesSunshine makes mistakes and will make mistakes. People will question why she is pregnant at a very young age. And it was clearly hers and her boyfriend’s choice to be unprotected. And when she decided to tell him she was pregnant, both of them had to make choices. But when legal options run out for Sunshine and the only choice she can make is to abort through illegal means, she puts her own life at risk. But it is also in making a choice that Sunshine finds herself.God’s Gift Sunshine leaves a jeepney with the words God’s Gift. She walks towards Quiapo church and asks for forgiveness, and outside the church there is a market selling religious things, but also potions that “induce menstruation”. A medical professional preaches God at Sunshine’s bedside after her “medicine” fails her. And it says a lot about the structures surrounding young women with unwanted pregnancies. Later on in the film, we see the impact of these structures on them. They are forced to make decisions that risk their lives.Full of GraceMaris Racal is perfect at portraying Sunshine’s physicality and character. Her performance will make you believe she’s an Olympian who can take the spotlight and get everyone’s attention, a sister who learns how important it is to make her family proud, but most importantly, a dreamer who understands her young age is the right opportunity to change the world around her. I will never feel the exact same way as Sunshine experienced, but as a male audience, the film still allows me to put myself in Sunshine’s hard and difficult situation. The film is able to open eyes, and hopefully the audience willingly opens their eyes to Sunshine.",2025-07-23,positive,0.9578874111175537,3

Sunshine,"It’s so odd to see Jadaone out of her box—or perhaps returning to her old form. If Fan Girl leaned into the dark, Sunshine veers into the gritty. The clever use of environment makes Maris Racal’s performance feel grounded and central, without overly commenting on political allegories like in Jadaone’s previous work. Orendain’s shots don’t try to elevate the story—they move hand-in-hand with it, gripping tightly to the isolation of being a young woman in the Philippines.I haven’t seen any Filipino film tackle abortion quite like this. The nuance of setting it in a deeply religious country is compelling. It opens the conversation, but perhaps plays a little too safe—maybe to appeal to a broader audience. I was hoping for a stronger push, but it chooses to be understated: a film beaming with quiet urgency and an accurate reflection of the current climate surrounding women’s reproductive rights.",2025-07-23,positive,0.965728223323822,1

Sunshine,"There’s a lot to unpack in Sunshine, but let me begin by saying this: Maris Racal owns this character. There’s no other actress who could have pulled off Sunshine the way she did. She embodied every bit of the character so completely that Maris disappears—you’re not watching Maris as Sunshine; you’re watching Sunshine herself. Her performance is quietly powerful and emotionally charged, grounded in rawness and empathy.But this film isn't just carried by Maris alone. Alongside her are Annika Co, Jennica Garcia,and Rhed Bustamante, who play pivotal roles in deepening Sunshine’s story. In many ways, their characters are Sunshine—reflected through different lenses. Through themes of mental health and teen pregnancy, the film constructs a layered portrait of girlhood under pressure. It's raw, empathetic, bold, and unafraid. It doesn’t flinch from the truth, nor does it romanticize the pain.What Sunshine does best is handle a very sensitive subject in our country with sincerity and urgency: the ongoing struggle for bodily autonomy. It quietly and firmly illustrates the emotional toll of being a young woman in a society that refuses to let her decide for herself. And worse, how these conversations remain taboo.Every silence in the film is so loud. The pauses, the stillness, the unspoken—Sunshine knows that some of the loudest screams come from what isn’t said. The film allows space for emotion to breathe, for truths to sink in, and for viewers to truly feel the weight these girls carry.The producers behind Sunshine had to fight to get this film seen—not for profit, but because these are stories that matter. They pushed forward to open a much-needed conversation on bodily autonomy and reproductive rights. And it’s 2025—yet these issues are still being dismissed, invalidated, or worse, treated like they’re myths. In truth, they are not up for debate. They are basic rights that every woman deserves.I only hope that in the years to come, we won’t need another Sunshine just to get people to listen.Panoorin ang Sunshine, hindi lang dahil gusto n'yo, kundi dahil kailangan.

It brings you to the darkest alleys of Manila where hope feels nowhere to be found, especially in a political climate where a woman is at a disadvantage, for the lack of a better term.Sunshine is disturbing in such a way that a woman, in this modern age, is still left with limited options, or the lack thereof, and has no autonomy in doing informed decisions on her own body amidst retribution of a patriarchal society.Sunshine is moving. It kicks. It punches. Five months after its Berlinale win, Sunshine comes home, and it needs traction. It is high time to make the conversation going until, for some divine intervention, it reaches the people that should be of utmost concerned about the plight of women.Sigh.

Sunshine,"2:30pm AWKP Screening @ SM North with Direk Tonet Jadaone & Maris Racal We live in a nation of choices & contradictions where women are the ones who are burdened with most of its unwanted consequences. Abortion? Illegal. Teenage pregnancy? Immoral. Contraceptives? Taboo. Elders look down on women who have pre-marital sex, unwanted pregnancy, and even an ounce of body autonomy.Beneath clouds of apathy & judgment, SUNSHINE reminds us to choose empathy & compassion.Nora Aunor was Bona. Hilda Koronel was Insiang. Today, Maris Racal is SUNSHINE.To bring up Lino Brocka is a heavy statement itself, but the Crystal Bear winning-SUNSHINE has also memorized Manila, and all its aches and decays. In her background are the familiar veins of Avenida & Quiapo. The heaviness of everyday life, religion and culture all add to her already buzzing headspace. She tries and must drown out the noise.With this award-worthy role, Maris might just have earned her place among the revered women in Philippine cinema who have embodied the honesty and rawness of the Filipina experience—in their respective era, each still under the same problematic patriarchal society.There's an all-timer hospital scene that stayed with me the most. As a medical student, what we're taught often align with Catholic teachings, even if our personal beliefs say otherwise. Our hope is that the next generation of health professionals will be provided with aligned legislation and protection that will help them become more compassionate, empathetic, and sensitive to women's autonomy over their bodies. These conversations should start not just in household discussions but in our social institutions as well.Elijah Canlas nails the recklessness of a young boy scared to man up. Xyriel Manabat's eyes speak for themselves. Jennica Garcia is simply luminous and embodies the 'Ate' in our lives. Her tough love exterior melts whenever Sunshine needs her genuine guidance. Meryll Soriano's presence is calming and reassuring. Piolo Pascual delivers friction and captures the high and mighty men in our society who assume to know all about everything and everyone, especially women’s needs. This is Direk Antoinette Jadaone's career-best work, yet. And at the heart of it all is Maris Racal, delivering a thrilling performance that will catapult her to superstardom.",2025-07-23,positive,0.9860607385635376,2

Sunshine,"This film on female reproductive health boldly centers the female gaze, offering a fresh and unflinching take on the realities that many Filipinas face. It attempts to break the glass ceiling of deeply rooted Filipino norms and challenges the culture shaped by religion, stigma, and silence around topics like abortion, sex education, and women’s health.Direk Tonet Jadaone masterfully captures the struggles of the protagonist, whose aspirations are put on hold after she discovers she’s pregnant. The film follows her journey, portraying how a woman navigates the weight of societal expectations in a culture that often leaves little room for personal agency.Cinematically, it’s far from your typical Filipino cliché. The pacing is tight, the cinematography is visually compelling, and each scene is deliberate, drawing the viewer into the emotional and social turmoil the character endures. The film allows us to witness how Sunshine finds resilience amidst adversity, all while shedding light on the layers of deprivation and injustice a Filipina can experience in a patriarchal society.More than just a narrative, the film leaves an impact. It sparks important conversations about our broken systems—the stigma surrounding reproductive health, the taboo nature of sex education, the inaccessibility of contraceptives, and the criminalization of abortion. It confronts how society often reduces women to objects of pleasure or vessels of reproduction, without regard for their mental or physical well-being.Ultimately, this is a film about empowerment. It’s a powerful reminder that women can dream for themselves, stand their ground, and rise above a system designed to keep them down. Thought-provoking and timely, it’s a testament to Direk Tonet Jadaone’s bold storytelling and her commitment to stories that matter.",2025-07-23,positive,0.9774869084358215,9

Sunshine,"This movie is arguably one of the best films of the year. It feels incredibly real because it reflects life in the Philippines, where women's rights are acknowledged but often support a male-dominated system and the patriarchy.""Sunshine"" tells the story of many women living in the Philippines. In this country, discussions about sex and sex education are frequently considered taboo. Many people talk about sex negatively, treating it as something sinful rather than educational. As a result, issues like teenage pregnancy are primarily viewed as public health problems. Furthermore, while there is a law aimed at protecting women from violence, it forces victims of sexual abuse to carry any resulting pregnancy to term, even in tragic circumstances such as r4p3.With abortion being illegal in the Philippines, many women find themselves in difficult situations. Those facing unplanned and unwanted pregnancies may have to consider unsafe options, which can threaten their lives.Women's rights must prioritize the well-being and choices of women, not men. The self-righteousness and views of certain religious groups should not dictate whether abortion is legalized. Women must have the power to make choices about their bodies.""Sunshine"" is a story of hope, second chances, and pursuing dreams. It hopes for a better society where women are not scrutinized for claiming rights over their bodies. This movie is a bold and significant step for film in the Philippines, as it represents the experiences of many women in the country. We must continue the conversation and let this film be a part of the movement advocating for better women's rights.Without a doubt, Maris Racal brought life to her character, Sunshine.

Sunshine,"“gets ko na”the physical representation of sunshine making peace, letting go of her guilt, and getting complete reassurance in her decision, all in the form of the child she once detested, but in the end, loved, was honestly beautiful. there is so much love and strength with the child in understanding sunshine’s dreams and circumstances, and how society was truly set against them; two females who were young girls at the end of the day. in a way, it reminded me of the popular thought prompt, “if my mother didn’t have me, what kind of life would she have had?” it’s a bittersweet thought at first, but there is such genuine love and understanding in seeing your mother past her caregiving responsibilities and wanting to witness her thrive as an independent woman with goals and ambitions, even if it meant losing your existence. however, there is also so much love and strength with sunshine deciding what would be best for both her and for the child, even if it hurt. sunshine loved the child enough to recognize that she didn’t deserve to be brought into such a cruel world, not when her own mother was still navigating through it, barely managing to survive the horrors she was dealt with. she knew she wasn’t ready at all and she didn’t want her child to bear the brunt of it, given what she herself has went through. there is love and strength in choosing yourself, recognizing your weaknesses, and acknowledging that both you and your child deserve the best version of yourself; one that has wholeheartedly lived her dreams and life despite societal expectations and harsh realities and one that is ready to help her child to do just the same.despite all odds, naintindihan nila yung isa’t isa. and out of love, for both themselves and for each other, they both let go.",2025-07-23,positive,0.9955189228057861,-1

From the lack of support for public hospitals to teenage pregnancy, our country has always been advocates for procreation, pro-union but consistently fails to address the root causes of these issues.Indeed, this film is not a fantasy movie that conservatives, like manong guard, might feel comfortable watching.

From the direction, to the acting, to the perfect casting, the script, the cinematography, and even the sound design, this film near-perfectly incapsulates the struggle of someone who is given no choice but to succumb to secrecy in a world that wants to make choices for her.Such a heavy film, but it’s a film that is overdue.

Sunshine,"Sunshine is an aspiring Olympian. She is two weeks away from performing in the qualifying round. She has won numerous gold medals in local and Asian competitions, making her an ideal candidate for an Olympic gold. But everything changes when she discovers an unwanted pregnancy. In a male-dominated, conservative, church-leaning country, who can help Sunshine achieve her dreams?Jadaone's latest picture is a gritty coming-of-age sports drama that tackles a sensitive yet realistic portrayal of the struggles women face when the government and society turn their backs on them. It is a claustrophobic journey that dims the shine of its lead character even before she sees the end of the tunnel. The film offers a timely and relevant discussion on gender roles, sex education, the health care system, body autonomy, female rage, and empowerment.At its center is Maris Racal, who plays the titular character with grace, bareness, and nuance. She embodies the sunshine amidst a dirty, hypocritical, careless, and immovable society that becomes a character of its own. This is supported by the film’s striking eye for cinematic framing of the ragged city of Manila.I love how the film handles the core of its subject: should Sunshine get an abortion and continue chasing her dreams, or take the baby and live a life she is not prepared for? I love how the women characters come together to help each other against the oppressive weight of our patriarchal society.And when Sunshine finally makes a decision, I don’t think the film wants you to agree or disagree with her. It wants you to ask why she had to be in this position in the first place. It wants us to notice the shoulder-to-shoulder crowding in public maternity wards. It wants us to see the hypocrisy of a society where black markets for abortion operate in the shadows of churches, and why a woman still cannot make a decision about her own body without judgment from everyone around her.Pero gets kita, Sunshine.

Sunshine,"Sunshine is a statement. Raw, delicate, and bold. It presents a social commentary on themes rarely explored yet deeply prevalent in the Philippine context. It dares to be radical. It dares to draw the line. When does the sun finally shine in a morally gray cloud of social disapproval?As linear and straightforward as the film appears, beneath it lies a complex character study — fearlessly told, thematically sharp, and emotionally unsettling. Antoinette Jadaone writes for women, and in a cinematic landscape like ours, we need more voices like hers. I was initially worried about where the story would go, but it was brave enough to take the harder path.This is Maris Racal's best performance yet — nuanced and quietly powerful. But it was Jennica Garcia who stole every scene she was in. She was the emotional anchor, the tearjerker. Some casting choices outside the leads, however, fell short. Certain scenes and narrative decisions could have landed harder with stronger performances or more fitting direction.That said, the editing needs work. The presence of a stunt double in certain scenes is obvious, breaking immersion. While the film’s visuals hauntingly capture a side of Manila we rarely see on screen, the sound design lacks polish. These flaws are noticeable but not deal-breaking.Still, this film succeeds in doing what few others do: it makes you ask what is ethical and what is not. It invites reflection. And when a film draws that line clearly for society to see, perhaps that’s when the sun truly begins to shine.",2025-07-23,positive,0.8679049015045166,1

Sunshine,"Sa bawat eksena ng pelikula ni Antoinette Jadaone, iisa ang tinig na umaalingawngaw — tinig ng babae. Hindi lang basta karakter ang mga babae, gaya ni Coach Eden mapa hanggang kay Doc Helena; sila’y haligi, saksi, at sandigan. Maging ang mga ina sa maternal ward, tahimik man o may tinig, ay larawan ng kababaihang nagtutulungan, nagkakapit-bisig sa gitna ng unos.Sa mundong kinahon ng patriyarka, binubuksan ng pelikula ang mata natin sa lakas ng kababaihan — lakas na hindi lang para sa tahanan o pamayanan, kundi para sa paghubog ng mas makatarungan at pantay na lipunan. Sa mata ng kamera, dama ang panawagan: bigyang saysay ang katawan at karapatan ng kababaihan.Dahil sa mundong nararapat, walang Sunshine, walang Menggay, ang kailangang manahimik sa sakit. Walang babaeng kailangang dumaan sa dilim ng unsafe practices para lamang maramdaman ang kontrol sa sariling buhay.

Sunshine,"Obviously im not a woman so I will never fully understand the lived experience of a woman but just like sunshine, I am someone who made regrettable decisions in the past. Someone who’s also eager to make it right. At least for me. But sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing when you have so many people telling you what to do, or when you don’t have the resources to do so. It’s hard to drown out the noise in your head when everything around you is so loud. Sometimes you don’t even need someone to tell you what to do at all, because you already know. Sometimes all you need is someone to be by your side. Something to make you feel like youre not alone. A text message from a friend. A hug from a sister. A pair of compassionate eyes of a stranger. Despite feeling alone in her whole ordeal, Sunshine was held together by the women she encounters. From the child, her sister, the cashier at the motel, the doctor at the hospital.I was lucky enough to have my own community lift me up at a time when I thought i was done for. It’s because of them that I’m still here, and that I still keep going. “Mahalin mo si sunshine, kahit ano pa siya, kahit ano pang nagawa niya”, said my friend. Indeed, we are all just people in need of community to get us through. In need of compassion. In need of empathy. Someone to say “kakampi mo ko dito”.

Sunshine,"The film has a sense of urgency about it, presenting the drama with so much eagerness, firm convictions, and intense sentiments nearly to the point where it devolves into cheap propaganda for a cause with which I happen to agree ideologically. It was too on the nose and constantly going for shock value that it was draining to follow, brazenly provoking the audience to feel for a horrible social reality but instead of pointing it out with a nod and a commentary, it was trying so hard to make them feel bad about those situations. Not in a good way because it is one of those things that breeds frustration rather than empathy for the protagonist. At some point, Sunshine simply disappeared, becoming a vessel for the audience to put their shoes on since she is subjected to so much oppression, losing any semblance of agency as it is all about how messed up her social reality has become. It's the same problem I had with war films and other poverty porn, where it ignores developing the protagonist in favor of escalating the situations in front of her and throwing every miserable conflicts imaginable at her. To be fair, the protagonist as a vessel had an aspiration, a threatened dream that was about to be broken, and the idea of her interacting with all these women, smoothly transitioning from the one who needed help to the one who provided help, clearly distinguished the film from those with a typical point-of-view character. Those moments of empowerment and camaraderie with other women may have eased the tension and made it feel more hopeful than the premise implies, but it also falls into the trap of caricaturing other characters for the sake of cheap sensationalism. It also felt betraying that so many things transpired that the gymnastics was set aside for so long, and I would hope that it was more of an escape than a hardship because no joy was displayed during those routines except for the last act. I would say that the sport was not seamlessly wedded to the character, since it could have been any sport or dream, and the film would still be effective. The magical realism element is essentially what I detest about the film, because it could have lingered in the loneliness and allowed the audience to connect with the character through subtlety, but it had to be filled with hypothetical conversation that hits the audience on the head to explain the themes and demonstrate the unspoken dilemmas in the present predicament. It could be interpreted as a mean to communicate guilt, a process of forgiving oneself and empathizing with other women, or as humanizing the fetus inside the body, which I'm not sure how to feel about that ideologically. It's also tonally odd, which is a Philippine cinema branding at this point, but it's always convenient to use a child for humor, and it reduces the overall tone of what's happening to the main character. It was just too telegraphed at times, and I was hoping to let the sequences play out and use more silence because those are the scenes I enjoy when the protagonist is alone and burdened by her situation. The upward momentum of a film that begins bleakly will always impede any form of storytelling because it must outdo itself, building emotions that are overwhelming every ten minutes to the point of monotony. In fact, I can't recall the chronology of the film even though I saw it yesterday, but I do remember every segments and the emotions it was going for. It actually came to the point of absurdity in the third act, when one character emerged, followed by a terrible circumstances, followed by even more bleak information and an unsettling confrontation, which would undoubtedly disturb anyone. And then there was a cameo in which the small theater collectively whisper and giggle a bit as a result of being taken off guard, which again felt awkward because it always has to make a joke after every other miserably effective scene. Not letting the moments breathe for a while. It can even be tonally confusing at times, with scenes that is either attempting to be comical or unsettling as some of the dialogue was just satirical and they incorporate some triggering monologue ala Vincentiments, but they also made the film lighthearted, which I am not sure is a good thing. I suppose I want my abortion movies to be more thought-provoking and full of sociological nuances rather than funny and emotional, because it can be too loose for its sensitive subject matter, but it was heartfelt and that was good. I'm making it seem like I hate this film when than I don't because it was terrific and entertaining, but it's just that I'm not sure if those are the things I want to take away from this film. I have to say though that it had a very good filmmaking mechanics. I heard they tried to hide the camera in public scenes to make the setting appear more authentic, and I was expecting long takes because it was another Filipino film about a protagonist wandering around which they did not employ at all, but I kind of like what they did here, from the shot composition and coverages to the way they were edited together. The only criticism I had regarding the filmmaking was the noticeable stunt double in the gymnastic routines, as well as how the emotions in the close-ups did not match those in the wide shots whenever they intercut them together. I suspect no one grins when doing gymnastics since it is a serious performance by meticulous athletes rather than by an exuberant victorious person, as the film claims at the conclusion. It's just a little quibble, but I commend the filmmaking overall and even the rough cuts were fantastic. Definitely the best-directed Filipino film I've seen in quite some time, I can say that with confidence.",2025-07-23,positive,0.5159894824028015,0

Sunshine,"This film tackles numerous points that need to be discussed. It provides a comprehensive overview of the different systemic issues that our country is not addressing, ranging from the double standards imposed on women to the societal barriers that make it difficult for women to meet these standards. It is an irony between what society wants for women and how society sets up women to fail to meet these standards.That's where the ""bullsht-ery"" comes in, as this film successfully sends it to its audience. I want to say a lot of things about this film, on how it provides a good argument, on how it provides a good piece of reality that is not glorified nor romanticized and on how it gave us something that will not just be left on the cinema, but to be talked about in the streets and on the media.I really understand the fear of the production of showing this in the Philippines, but I believe that strong and brave films like this are what we need, to not just start conversations but to challenge the views we have as individuals and as a collective. This is the kind of film that everyone needs to watch, as it will definitely afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted. No words, but pure awe of everything about this film. Definitely the best work of both director Antoinette Jadaone and actress Maris Racal.

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone has always been one of the few Filipino filmmakers I deeply admire, not just for her craft, but for the way she tells women’s stories with empathy and nuance. Her work has always felt personal, films like Alone/Together, Fan Girl and now Sunshine, might just be my favorite Filipino film released this year so far.I remember seeing the trailer last year and wondering if it would even get a proper release here. It tackles such a taboo topic, one that many in this country still refuse to even speak about. That’s why I admire Jadaone so much. She’s chosen to talk about what others won’t. In a predominantly Catholic nation where abortion is criminalized, even in cases of rape or incest, Sunshine feels like an act of courage.I’ve always been pro-choice. I grew up surrounded by the whole “abortion is murder” narrative, from relatives, from my old Catholic school run by nuns. But even as a kid, it never sat right with me. I never saw it as a sin. And now that I’m studying to become a doctor, that belief matters even more to me, because women deserve healthcare that doesn’t judge or shame them. Sunshine affected me on a personal level because of that. It reminded me why I want to do this.It’s not a perfect film. Some might find the pacing fast or feel like it didn’t say enough. But to me, the point isn’t perfection. What matters is that it exists. It dares. It’s a film that opens doors, uncomfortable ones, sure, but necessary.

One sequence that stood out is the one from the inn to the hospital - Maris lets herself be consumed by Sunshine, almost as if the creeping is part of the routine itself.

Sunshine,"In a Q&A with writer-director Antoinette Jadaone that I was lucky to attend, she was asked how she braced for the potential backlash of this film from Filipino audiences given our mostly conservative background. Her answer resonated with me deeply: As a writer, Jadaone believes her primary duty is to stay loyal to her characters. If her character's arc demands visiting unnerving and controversial depths, she is not afraid to take the plunge - regardless of how viewers might perceive it. Her earlier work, Fan Girl (2020), already painted a similar picture, albeit a bit spottily.Jadaone takes her boldest steps yet in her latest work, Sunshine (2024), by tackling abortion, a highly contentious subject in the country, with both sensitivity and grit. This entry is unflinching in its commentary, taking us to the most harrowing places women can be in a nation where sexual abuse is prevalent, abortion is illegal, and healthcare fails the underprivileged . Sunshine, our protagonist, is a skilled gymnast, but even she can't leap over patriarchy, tumble past outdated laws, or cartwheel her way out of the conservative society and system. In one scene, Sunshine waits along a street choked with tricycles, behind the railing of a pharmacy counter - she is jailed in and by this wretched city, made a criminal for wanting to make a choice that should be her right. But this film's Manila is more than just Sunshine's prison. It's a breathing character, trailing her around from scene to scene. Always in the backdrop but never invisible. Never speaking but always loud. A passing MRT train rattles the windows of a shabby motel. A crammed jeepney bounces to the bass of a local rap song. Grimy streets teem with hustling vendors and weary residents. Sunshine makes her choices, but her choices are only as good as this bleak, brutal city allows . Maris Racal delivers a phenomenal performance, portraying our protagonist with nuance and raw intensity. She is backed by a stellar ensemble - Jennica Garcia, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, and Elijah Canlas - each breathing life into characters that are authentic and vital to the film's message. The sequences are daring, the story beats sometimes violent, but always necessary. The music elevates it all, with a standout Challengers-esque score underscoring the gymnastic scenes. This film is not without its faults though, with excessive cursing (seriously, again in a Project 8 work?), somewhat awkward acting, and some unpolished plot points, but these are forgivable given how effective the complete work is.Sunshine may very well be Direk Tonet's finest work yet - and rightly so. It stands as one of the most important Filipino films in the modern times.",2025-07-23,positive,0.9596983194351196,-1
Sunshine,"first time watching a screening at a cinema with the star herself (ANG GANDA MO SA PERSONAL MARIS WTF)! such a great film with brilliant creative choices all throughout. so emotional and so so real. only a female director could masterfully tell this story!edit: after the second watch, i realized how empowering and important it was to portray this story using sports as a metaphor to her bodily autonomy. everybody loves her when she uses her body to look beautiful for the world, but when mishap occurs, she is shamed for it. yet, in the end, i noticed that the last thing she declares about her pregnancy is a statement that is so bold and firm: “Ayoko maging nanay.” right in front of the men who tried to control her decisions. which maybe leaves the audience to think: “what happened after that?” but the point is that her decision, her body, and her passion, are all unshakably hers until the end. and we see that because after that scene with miggy and his dad, she practices her routine again. and then it was so perfect-had tears in my eyes the whole time. in that gymnasium, Sunshine “drowns out the noise.” what remains is her unwavering bond with her body, both as a woman and as a gymnast.",2025-08-03,positive,0.9933100938796997,19

Sunshine,"i was deeply moved and inspired by sunshine. what a gem of philippine cinema. you know a film is good when it makes you want to create again. however, while undeniable in its prowess and relevance, its potency and impact dwindles in its struggle to pinpoint with conviction who its target audience is. it seems to want to pander to both liberal and conservative audiences, but this muddles its message. who is this film really for? who is it in dialogue with? i thought that the choice to portray the unborn fetus as a grown, conscious being was counterintuitive at first, but then i realized the film was only trying to meet its conservative audiences halfway in their beliefs. then i thought it was a stroke of genius: of course, the only way to convince someone to change their mind is by explaining it in the terms they understand, through their perspective of the world. but then it also alienates this very audience by demonizing them in the film. while it successfully empathizes with the horrors of being a woman in the philippines, there is a lack of nuance, a dichotomy of good vs. evil, that might be more harmful than helpful in the grander scheme of things.(there are also so many scenes where maris racal’s quiet yet powerful performance should have been enough, but the beauty of the moment is ruined by the “child” voicing out sunshine’s thoughts, spoon-feeding the audience.)only particularly critical because i think sunshine is an exciting step in the right direction for ph cinema. i loved it and i think everyone should still watch it in spite of its flaws.",2025-07-23,positive,0.9732455611228943,1

Sunshine,"The tone set by Sunshine over Jadaone's previous film, Fangirl, is way different. The urgency of survival is apparent and how it clashes with the film's thematic journey, like Paul Soriano's Thelma. Though Sunshine tends to get the feel of guerrilla direction, it is a combination of the director's experiences in mainstream and her indie roots. Meaning, we get to see well-lighted scenes and less usage of shake cam.Sunshine unpacks a lot of society's ills and inequalities. Patriarchy, discrimination in the medical field, inhumane laws, and glaring social class issues that don't benefit those without that much. In a country where religion reigns, or so they say, the film easily relays problems with well-made sequences and heartbreaking results. Jadaone knows the voices of her characters, and it tells a distinct topic with passion and wit, giving the audiences a rollercoaster of emotions.One thing that makes this film unique is the inclusion of a fantastic element. It somehow references, or a styling of, what they had in Death Note anime or Big Mouth to make it more accurate. And such symbolism as Sunshine's conscience made it relatively easier to tell the film's narrative. It was smartly added, and it didn't make the audience unintelligent.The technical are overwhelmingly great. The use of lighting in urban areas, especially those scenes shot at night, is worthy of a picturesque view of the marginalized reality. We rarely see such strong shots in film. The options to use close-ups for intensity of emotions and certain decisions to make the scenes with Mariz Racal's gymnastic performance were made with careful efficiency. And the sound editing was just on point. It is technically the protagonist's in-ear audio being shared with the viewers.Jadaone's casting is really one for the books. An appreciation to Mariz Racal's graceful bookend performance. The representation is exactly what we need to see from young adults, especially in the situation of what is happening to her character. The conflict-bearers really made the sequences memorable, and it made you think of the situations presented. These aren't farfetched ideas shown in the film. Most of them are realistically sound and Piolo Pascual's short stint really is just something for us to gasp about. And we also get to see Jennica Garcia and Elijah Canlas' supporting roles to complete the ensemble.Les we forget Annika Co's strong personality. I guess we have another star made by the director. And regarding Meryll Soriano being part of the film. It made me remember how she did a similar role back in 2010, as Lizette in the Mark Meily film, Donor.Sunshine displays what needs to be said in a society when abortion is considered a taboo topic. A possible eye-opener to the current status quo. .:smcityeastortigas>>",2025-07-23,positive,0.9928392171859741,1

Sunshine,"Sunshine Francisco played by Maris Racal, is a teenage gymnast dreaming of getting in the Olympics, got pregnant by accident, and must face the moral dilemma of choosing between her dreams and keeping the baby.Maris Racal carried the film to pitch perfection and rawness. She takes you in and makes you feel her struggles. Her facial nuances and physical vigor makes her the right choice to play the titular role, in what could be a role of a lifetime. Director Antoinette Jadaone's never been more sure and absolute of her vision here. The film stands as an audacious statement in a country full of naysayers when it comes to the sensitive and controversial subject matter: abortion. The ending really made me shed a tear, in response to understanding why women do what they do. Though the film is not without its flaws. I sometimes felt the script and characters could have been more seamlessly sewn, and not just coming out of nowhere, making it feel a bit unnatural. Nevertheless, this is an essential film that needs to be seen by a wide audience. It didn't provide the answers, but this is what a filmmaker does best: to start conversations, to challenge the status quo and make us reflect our own beliefs and morals.ps. support local films, local music, local products, and local boys. eme",2025-07-24,positive,0.9881244897842407,1

Sunshine,"This was honestly just a sad movie. Even though you should be at least happy for Racal's character at the end. She went through hell and back just for the sake of her dream. It was a poignant (POIGNANT?!) commentary on a person's instinct to pursue one's dream and how it can lead to decisions and sacrifices to avoid compromise or delay. The other commentary is definitely about teen pregnancy/sex education/family planning in the Philippines. Despite having dramatized scenes, the burden that tolls on the characters is easily felt.

Sunshine,"Every time I visit Quiapo Church, I’m always amused by the chaos outside its gates. Right beside vendors selling rosaries, crucifixes, candles, and bottles of holy water, there are stalls hawking pamparegla and other herbal concoctions said to “regulate” missed periods. The juxtaposition is striking. Sacred and taboo, salvation and cycle, side by side like it’s the most natural thing in the world. It’s absurd, hilarious, and deeply Filipino. I always find myself thinking, someone should write a story, play, or movie out of this contradiction. With Sunshine, it finally feels like someone did. Fearlessly and with heart.It’s not exactly about Quiapo, but it carries the same beautiful mess of contradictions. Faith and survival, morality and body, dream and disappointment. It dares to talk about reproductive health care in the Philippines without flinching, but it’s also about more than that. It’s about the right to choose. Not just over one’s body, but over one’s future. It’s about women tired of being told to wait, to settle, to stay silent. And finally daring to want more. What makes it powerful is its quiet grace. It doesn’t preach. It listens. To the unspoken shame carried by women. To the whispers exchanged in tricycle/jeepney rides and neighborhood clinics. To the dreams that keep getting deferred by the weight of economy, expectation, and morality. Sunshine is a film that sees women. Not as symbols or martyrs, but as people.Technically, it’s a marvel. The cinematography captures the real Manila. Not the sepia-toned or shadow-drenched “poverty porn” we’re so used to. No extra lighting or artificial grime smeared on walls for the sake of grittiness. No “designing poverty.” The production design feels lived in, never overworked. Every detail feels honest. If I have only one criticism, it's that the magical realism elements could have been woven in more seamlessly. But even that doesn’t take away from the film’s quiet power.Then there’s the acting. Maris Racal delivers the role of a lifetime. Raw, honest, and quietly devastating. Jennica Garcia, whenever she’s on screen, shines. Her presence is magnetic, and together, their chemistry feels lived-in and true.In every sense, Sunshine is a landmark film. It should be our Oscar submission for next year. And if there’s any justice, it should sweep every local award. It’s not just a movie. It’s a mirror. One we’ve long needed in a country as patriarchal and hypocritical as ours. The kind of mirror that’s often hard for Filipinos to look into, but impossible to ignore.",2025-07-24,positive,0.9880081415176392,-1

Sunshine,"Some films entertain you. Sunshine confronts you.When the credits rolled, no one moved. No one spoke. It was that rare kind of silence. Not awkward, but sacred. As if we had all just witnessed something painfully true and didn’t quite know what to do with ourselves.Because Sunshine isn’t just a movie. It’s a question. A confrontation. Directed with clarity and deep compassion by Direk Tonet Jadaone, Sunshine doesn’t soften its message or try to make it more palatable.. It’s brave. It’s loud in its honesty. It doesn’t ask for permission to be angry or tired or vulnerable. It simply is, and that’s why it hits the way it does. And yet, somehow, even with all its emotional weight, Direk Tonet’s signature humor still finds its way through. There are moments—unexpected but perfectly timed—when the entire cinema bursts into laughter. It’s sharp, it’s honest, and it never feels out of place. Maybe Direk Tonet makes us laugh because she knows we’ll cry eventually. Or maybe that’s just how we are as Filipinos, finding humor even in the heaviest moments, because sometimes, it’s the only way we know how to carry the pain.What makes this film even more powerful is how it gives voice to things we often overlook. As someone who isn’t a woman, I know I can’t fully grasp the weight of that experience. But this film opened a window for me. A clear, honest glimpse into a reality I will never live, but need to see. Much of that power comes from the performances. Maris Racal, as Sunshine, delivers the most vulnerable and grounded work of her career. Her pain is quiet, but it radiates. You feel it in the way she holds her breath between words, in the weight behind her gaze. Jennica Garcia, as her sister, is just as affecting. Her stillness, her softness, the way she listens. She becomes a reflection of what the film asks of us: to pause, to witness, to respond with care. There’s a moment near the end that stuck with me. Sunshine asks, “Gets mo na ba ako?”And while it’s said to the person in the room, it felt like she was looking straight through the screen, asking us, the viewers. And like that person beside her, I hope we all have the courage to say: Yes. We see you. We understand.Please, Direk Tonet, keep making films like this (inutusan pa nga). Keep telling stories that hold space for women to be everything—loud and quiet, strong and hurting, tired and brave. Stories that make people feel seen.Gets kita, Sunshine.",2025-07-24,positive,0.9691988825798035,1

Sunshine,"Sunshine (2024) would be a perfect double feature with Eliza Hittman's Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) as they both tackle similar topics but with a stark difference in privilege and access.where the latter becomes a story of sisterhood and compassion, as two girls cross state lines to get access to healthcare, Sunshine offers no such respite to our eponymous protagonist.in here, what Sunshine wants is not even a matter of choice, it is something that she is forced to bear. all alone as her confidants succumb to the stigma of her dilemma, Sunshine takes to the streets of Manila in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy.the plot moves along while the audience is served scenes of what i believe to be one of the better cinematic depictions of modern Manila. the first few minutes almost feel like an entirely different film (one i would have particularly liked more) until the plot takes a peculiar detour.in all of its realism and poignancy i found a particular element in its storytelling very out of place and oftentimes distracting. while the ending made me understand why those choices were made i just don't think a semblance of Magical Realism is the perfect vehicle for a message as heavy as this one.while i think the point that: ""an entire generation of Filipino women being forced to reckon with their unborn children as if the choice of abortion is something that has to be explained, and in turn, be understood."" is a step in the right direction for this nation's pro-choice discourse, the delivery just felt like it was bordering into Diary of an Unborn Child territory. with that being said, i still thoroughly enjoyed Sunshine and i would still highly recommend it. despite some of my grievances with the film, the unblemished ray of sunshine known as Maris Racal delivers a stellar performance in the titular role. perhaps even a mariesteller one. *wink* *wink*",2025-07-24,positive,0.976695716381073,1

Sunshine,"This is my first film in FOUR months?! It’s horrible for my cinephile ass out here…This is the Happening of Filipino cinema, except it’s less thrilling and more aligned with the traditional storytelling of Filipino drama.Perhaps my favorite element of this new project from Antoinette Jadaone is the contrast between morality and sin as personified by the hawker who sells abortion pills behind figures of saints beside Quiapo Church, which is arguably the most popular place of veneration among Catholic Filipinos throughout the country.Beyond that, I’m struggling to seek nuance and proper closure. What sets this work, aside from the palpable gentleness toward the female main character, apart from the many stories about abortion out there?It’s worth noting, however, that stories about women are told by women, just like what Jadaone manages to deliver here. I believe (cis) male filmmakers, no matter how genuine their intent is, cannot tell stories about women because women’s danas, the distinct Filipino word for experience, is not men’s danas.[Watched at SM Mall of Asia Cinema 1]",2025-07-24,positive,0.6435948610305786,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is going to be an eye-opener for a lot of people here in the Philippines. It doesn't just raise awareness, it confronts the daily injustices Filipino women face just for being women. This should kickstart long-overdue conversations about reproductive rights, no matter how uncomfortable they may be.Maris Racal gives a career-defining performance as Sunshine. She fully captures the vulnerability, resilience, and quiet strength of her character. She feels heartbreakingly real. The supporting cast also pulls its weight, with Jennica Garcia standing out in a big way.What I really appreciated is how the film frames everything through the lens of a deeply Catholic country. The Sto. Niño statues being sold next to illegal abortion pills and the Christmas lights in the maternity ward stick with you. They are not just background details, they feel like commentary. Birth and suffering are made sacred here, even when they come with pain, even when they are not wanted.Sometimes it feels like the film is about to lean into pro-life messaging, with ""what if"" hypotheticals and future-president guilt trips. But instead of reinforcing those ideas, it pulls them apart. I didn't expect it to handle such a taboo subject with this much care. Subtlety is completely thrown out the window at times, with some characters written like Facebook comment sections come to life. They are loud, caricature-like, and clearly meant to provoke. But the sad truth is that people like that exist.Without getting into spoilers, the film isn’t trying to decide what’s right or wrong. It’s more interested in what it means to be understood.Heavy-handed? Sometimes. Necessary? Absolutely.So with that, we thank God for Sunshine.",2025-07-24,positive,0.9861440658569336,1

And because of that, I’ll never truly understand how a woman feels.But this is precisely what the film accomplished—it made me feel.Direk Tonet’s writing and direction are potent and hard-hitting, while Maris’ performance is just as powerful. For a film that exudes a seemingly hopeless atmosphere, with no end in sight to the world’s harshness, Maris’ Sunshine shone like a light at the end of the tunnel.I hope the future is kinder to women, and I hope I get to contribute to paving the way for that future to become a reality.",2025-07-24,positive,0.9917513728141785,1

When in reality, it’s a gritty portrayal of thousands of Filipinas—all the dreams and lives lost, the could haves and what ifs.

Sunshine,"My experience with this film didn’t end when the credits started rolling. Walking out of the cinema and into the crowded floors of a large mall, I began to watch people with a weighted heart. The children playing. The mothers of different ages. It left me reeling and in silence for quite a bit, to the point I felt a little sorry to the company I watched the film with. That was the moment I knew this film would leave an impact for a lot of people, and could even be divisive among most of its Filipino audiences.Sunshine leaves a mark. A film that paints a very real, raw, uncomfortable, and deeply moving picture on what it is like to be a Filipino woman with a dream, a mistake, and an agency that is being challenged by those around her—even by herself. It does this through depicting scenes all pointing towards the state of reproductive healthcare in the Philippines, and all those who are affected by it.Its characters are what makes the film so moving. Of course, Maris Racal does a stunning job portraying Sunshine and the character’s emotional complexity. Every character, though, has a purpose and reflects Filipino realities accurately. Perhaps the most special characters are what the film uses as a device to move the story along. At first, I felt unsure of it, but by the end of the film, it was very effective.This is a type of story that I feel, and hope, most Filipinos get to see. It is highly relevant as much as it is good. The narrative, linear structure of the film lends to the experience of the casual spectator; it builds up and comes crashing down. The scene of Sunshine being alone in the gymnasium.. is one that will stick with me for a while.I love this film. Go see it. It is so worth the ₱270.",2025-07-23,positive,0.9955165982246399,-1

There’s so much weight in the silence, the stares, the quiet desperation. It doesn’t hold your hand or tie things up neatly, but that’s what makes it so powerful.

Sunshine,"Really a sucker for films where the protagonist chose themselves, a recurring theme in Antoinette Jadaone films and Sunshine might be her best one yet. Being a girl is hard, but being a girl in the Philippines is something else. At the end of the day, it’s our decisions in life that make us. And Sunshine gets to decide. Not some doctor she just met. Not some random pharmacist. And definitely not Miggy. Heck, what’s Miggy gonna do, call his Papa?Dear reader, please go see Sunshine. It’s an important film. PS.

Sunshine,"For a couple of years, I've lived and roamed in the kind of Manila Tonet has painted for us: busy and dirty streets of Recto and Carriedo overflowing with people trying to make ends meet, the filthy motels of Avenida filled with horny, exploitative men who need them, and the whispering neighborhood all around the tight grid-like system such as Tondo, Blumentritt, San Lazaro, Laon-Laan or Dapitan watching, staring, looking for something to make time pass.Under the watchful eyes of this condemnatory city stands a rather bright-eyed Sunshine, a young female student-gymnast trying to secure her spot in athletic competitions such as the Olympics and SEA Games. Her hard work and dedication have reflected in her routine, and her coach is confident in her skill in making it to the national team. But all of her dreams of soaring global recognition have been put to risk when one day, she discovers she is with child.What's heartbreaking about this piece is that this film is about a young woman working day and night fighting for a country who doesn't fight for her. This is a country where a woman needs to make unnecessarily drastic measures just to live a life she works hard on achieving. This is a country built on guilt and shame, yet a country proudly branded for its resilience. This is a country that veiled its dirt and its scum with the cloak of catholic morals and self-righteousness. This is no place for a sun to shine on.It's easy for me to believe in this film, because it is a true story. This is a biography, not of Sunshine and not of Tonet. This is a biography of Philippines in modern day, and for decades this has been told time and time again from the works of Lino Brocka, Ishmael Bernal, and Brillante Mendoza, to works of Kip Oebanda, Ramona Diaz, and now Antoinette Jadaone. For years filmmakers like them have hoped for a brighter future, hoped for people to open their eyes and unveil what is hidden in plain sight, and Tonet, in this incredible feat, making the movie ticket as cheap and as accessible as it can be, is reaching out to us saying ""This is my country. Look and see.""",2025-07-24,positive,0.9335386157035828,-1
Sunshine,"The moment Sunshine opened, I felt like I was already there in her world. That’s one of the things I’ve always admired about Direk Tonet Jadaone: how she builds these quiet, lived-in spaces that don’t just exist for her characters, but completely pull you in. You don’t just watch the story unfold, you feel it with Sunshine.What stuck with me the most is the way the film builds this deeply uncomfortable paradox: a country that loudly declares abortion is murder, yet leaves no room for safe options, quietly allowing dangerous pills to be sold under the table. The contradiction isn’t even subtle, it’s the whole point. Being a Filipino is already hard, but being a woman in the Philippines? It's brutal. The film doesn’t sugarcoat anything, it throws you straight into the brokenness of it all, from healthcare to shame culture to just… surviving.As the story unfolds, you’re taken on this intense ride with Sunshine, a girl trying to make sense of what she’s going through while the world around her offers no real answers. It forces you to confront your own biases. You start to ask yourself: what would I do in her place? What’s the “right” choice, really, when you’re trapped in a society that only ever gives you wrong ones?Menggay’s story hit like a gut punch. It’s the kind of pain that’s so real, but we never talk about because we’re scared to. Menggay isn't just another casualty, at the end of it all -- she's still a kid.What I love most about the storytelling is that it doesn’t preach. It makes you think, it makes you question -- but in the end, it reminds you that it should all boil down to what Sunshine feels is right. What she knows is best. It gives her that agency, that voice, something this world so often tries to take from girls like her.I've always been a fan of Maris Racal, and I agree that this is her best project yet. She didn’t need to go big; her silence already said everything. And I loved how the film used gymnastics as this quiet metaphor of control, performance, and discipline all while her personal life spirals into uncertainty. It’s so smart.And I have to say: the cinematography? Stunning. Of course, the gym scenes were beautifully shot, we all expected that - but it was the motel scenes that floored me. There was something about how those moments were framed that just hit harder. Like everything was raw, exposed, still. And what really stayed with me, long after the credits rolled, was this one feeling: at the end of it all, our dreams, they’re always for the younger versions of ourselves. We fight, we keep going, because we hope they’d understand. That if we ever had to explain why we chose what we chose, they’d look at us and say, “gets kita.”But the question that lingers is: are we, is this world ready for a story as brave as Sunshine?",2025-07-23,positive,0.9914633631706238,1
Sunshine,"i love how sunshine stood her ground and said she didn’t want to be a mother, even when her boyfriend’s dad offered help and support. it really showed how sure she was about what she wanted for her life. abortion should be legalized not because people are being careless, but because women should have the right to decide for themselves.and let’s not ignore the elephant in the room: the philippine healthcare system is so messed up. women like sunshine don’t get the care they need. and for what? so the budget can go to another pointless msproject or billboardsized face of some politician? like, please… put the money into actual healthcare. PRIORITIZE PEOPLE, NOT CLOUTsunshine’s is reality for so many. and it’s about time na we listened. amen? AMEN!",2025-07-25,positive,0.8994554281234741,-1
Sunshine,"I think the best way to describe this film is that it’s truly a slice of life.Sunshine may be a fictional character, but it’s not impossible to see someone like her in real life. Maybe with a different name but sharing the same story or situation. The film beautifully portrays the strength of a woman as a sister, a friend, an athlete, and most importantly, as herself.I was also really impressed with how balanced the characters were. Even the supporting roles had their moments to shine.And Annika, what a star! I didn’t expect her character to unfold the way it did, but she delivered an outstanding performance, along with another child actor you absolutely need to see!",2025-07-23,positive,0.9977008700370789,1

Sunshine,"NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN DYING IN SECRET AND LIVING IN SHAME. I cried because it’s painfully relateable and also bc I know women like her. I’ve been that friend who hears the secret. The details are so specific and real. From the moment she bought the pregnancy kit with shame in her eyes and afraid of judgement — to checking that test in a cramped public restroom where two cubicles exist but only one works. The fear of opening up to even one person and hiding it from her family. Sneaking into a motel for something you shouldn’t be ashamed of,,, all because abortion is illegal. This is a reality for SO MANY women in the Philippines. Women are forced in silence, danger, and in killing our dreams. Abortion should be legal. Thank you to the whole Sunshine team.

Sunshine,"There’s no denying Sunshine matters - it speaks to harsh truths and tackles its themes with care and emotional honesty. The film had a timely subject, sincere writing, and phenomenal acting - Maris Racal was stellar, while Jennica Garcia delivered with quiet power. But I struggled with certain elements, particularly its attempt at magical realism. The presence of the imaginary child felt clunky, tonally jarring, and out of sync with the otherwise grounded narrative. Frankly, the character felt unnecessary - the film had already evolved past the need for her. The story had power, and I wish it had trusted its own strength without the added flourish. Ultimately, I admired its purpose more than loving its execution.",2025-07-25,positive,0.8750513195991516,1
Sunshine,"Sunshine sheds light on a topic many still avoid, the abortion and women's choices. It's not just a Philippine issue, but a global one. Sensitive as it is, this film proves it's a conversation worth having, especially with the youth. Sex education needs attention, lalo na mula sa mga nasa pwesto. The government should support this by pushing for proper education and open dialogue.Kudos to the whole Sunshine team for bringing a story like this to light, something we should be openly discussing in this day and age.",2025-07-23,positive,0.989488422870636,1

Sunshine,"The premise was simple but the message was hard. It did not just amplify a young girl's struggle with how to handle a life-changing conflict, but it also showed how the external actors play a huge role on how things must go. The film aimed to magnify how conservative the culture of the Philippines is, in which in this modern age, some of it could be considered obsolete.Coming from someone with a short attention span, I found myself staring at the cinema screen for the whole time, even after the film ended. There were no dull parts of the film, all scenes were necessary to how the story flows.Maris Racal's portrayal was exemplary. It was a different flavor from what she was known for, and this might be the turning point to her career.

Sunshine,"In a deep personal level, saying that I like this film is an understatement. This is a well crafted story that follows a gymnast enroute of becoming an Olympian. Antoinette Jadaone is really clever in tackling a stigma with boldness and sensitivity at the same time. I really appreciate that the movie also depicts the reality and scenarios of living in Manila on a daily basis. I also appreciate the shots where the busy streets of Manila is in the backdrop. This may be an overstatement but Lino Brocka will be proud. I do not want to compare but when I was watching this movie, I remembered the late Gil Portes' classic High School Scandal starring Gina Alajar and Sandy Andolong. Its a proof that we need movies like this to be informed and educated.Maris Racal, the entire heart of the movie, humbly carried the story in her back - a teenager who got pregnant in a very religious and conservative country. This is her best one yet - humble, raw and precise. The supporting cast are great, too. Jennica Garcia's eyes are really captivating on those crucial moments. And Anika? Bruuuh, we really need to watch for that little one in the years to come.One of the best Filipino films in recent memory, Sunshine is bold, thought-provoking and relevant.

Sunshine,"Play ""Perpektong Tao"" by Maris Racal.Oh Diyos ko po, mapapatawad N’yo pa ba ako!!!I walked into the cinema with so much expectation—and Sunshine delivered more than my expectations. This is a landmark film. A humanizing, soul-stirring, and bold piece of cinema that dares to speak truth in a country that often prefers silence and compliance.In a nation as conservative and deeply religious as the Philippines, Sunshine dives headfirst into the conversations we often whisper about, especially around the elderly and religious individuals—abortion, reproductive health, sexual abuse (WITHIN the family), and the religious hypocrisy that surrounds them. One of the most powerful moments for me was when she prays to God in the middle of an abortion attempt: “Lord, tanggalin Mo lang ’to, babawi ako sa lahat-lahat.” That line alone—honest and devastating—is a statement that cuts deep into the Filipino moral paradox.Napakagaling. Maris Racal carried this film on her own, brilliantly. No awkward or cringey moments—just pure, intentional acting that hits you right in the gut. This is easily her most brilliant and mature performance to date, and I am hungry for more.Also, just to share my theory: I don’t think the kids she sees represent a “mother figure” version of herself. To me, they were the babies’ little angels, quietly watching over their mothers, protecting them, forgiving them.I laughed, I wept, I cursed out loud inside the cinema. PUTANGINANG PILIPINAS TO. We need to see this. Sunshine deserves every bit of international acclaim it’s been getting—and more. And most of all: the Philippines is ready. Filipinos are ready for this conversation, for this kind of truth-telling, for this kind of art. More than a film, it’s also a wake-up call.

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is a powerful and unflinching examination of the ongoing issue of teenage pregnancy in the Philippines, anchored by a stunning breakout performance from Maris Racal. The film transcends a simple narrative, offering a poignant and necessary critique of a society grappling with deeply entrenched religious and political views that often leave young women isolated and without agency. Through its raw and unapologetic storytelling, Sunshine doesn’t just present a problem. It takes a stand and demands that we, the viewers, confront it alongside its protagonist.Where the film truly excels is in its unflinching depiction of the societal and systemic failures that trap young women like Sunshine. The Philippines has the second-highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Southeast Asia, and a 2023 survey by Save the Children Philippines revealed that more than 500 adolescents become mothers each day, some as young as ten years old. Sunshine masterfully illustrates the intense personal isolation behind these numbers by using the accessible medium of sports. Read my full review here.",2025-07-09,positive,0.9754471182823181,1

Raw, unflinching, necessary.Maris Racal exceeds everything she has done before since she bears the film with acute vulnerability. Jennica Garcia is a match to her beautifully. The sister's love becomes as a form of motherhood itself too.Each Filipina forced for fighting for all of her rights deserves such love. This Filipino film is quite vital and a must see.Kudos to our mother ka-eme, Direk Tonet! P.S. Thank you Direk for including Rhed Bustamante :(",2025-07-25,positive,0.9963255524635315,-1

Sunshine,"I have a love-hate relationship with the Philippines.My country has it all, a strong historical background and culture, beautiful agricultural sights. The Philippines shines in so many ways. This country is easy to love, but it’s also easy to hate. On the other side of the spectrum, the Philippines is plagued with corruption, deeply oppressive religious standards, and many more hateful traditions and mindsets that continue to affect the Filipino people. The bare minimum is oftentimes glorified as the best that society could do for itself in the Philippines, but is to settle for less to settle for enough? This is the question that Sunshine raises. In a country that struggles to stand for its women, Sunshine did what many movies could not, it fearlessly depicted what was real and happening in our country. It showed the pure, unfiltered realities of a young, adolescent woman facing an unwanted pregnancy. The film doesn’t hold back. From the infamous ‘motel scene’ to the different women we follow in the film, direk Antoinette Jadaone fearlessly portrays the dangers a woman has to go through just to gain autonomy over their body, hopes, and dreams.Upon a second watch (this time with my mom and my cousin), I noticed something about the way Sunshine (Maris Racal) progresses in the film. She starts off as quiet. When she finds out she is pregnant, she only tells her boyfriend and her best friend. When she’s worried or angry, she conceals her emotions. She is held back. She is chained. As the film progresses, she slowly finds her footing, first through the infamous ‘basag windshield’ scene, and then through the numerous situations she finds herself stuck in. There is a scene near the end of the film. Sunshine is practicing her routine. She is emotional, and she’s made up her mind. As she ends her routine, the ribbon falls around her body, chaining her. She has a heartfelt conversation with ‘bata’ and she breaks free from her chains, which directly leads to the ending. Nothing is holding her back, she won’t settle for less, she has had enough.There is a scene in the film between Thea (Xyriel Manabat) and Sunshine. They are at a school canteen, eating separately from each other, but through their eyes, through the way they are looking at each other, you know that they are in support of one another. In a country that fails its women, they are forced to support each other in silence.Listening to my mom’s thoughts and reaction to Sunshine was the best part of my experience with this film. A woman who is somewhat religious, understanding why someone would want an abortion. An emphatic moment between my mom, me, and all the Sunshines in our country. The irony of watching a film entitled Sunshine during tag-ulan season is an irony that’s hard to look past, but I think this film couldn’t have come at a better time. We are settling for less. The streets are flooding, and the women in our country struggle to find the healthcare they deserve. We are chained and we are held back. When will we break free? When will we have enough?

Sunshine,"With directorial precision and unflinching clarity, Antoinette Jadaone's Sunshine (2024) makes the claim that being a young woman in the Philippines means navigating systems that deny one's agency on a continual basis.

What about not wanting to be a mother yet is so hard to understand?A woman who has been intimate with others is not a whore or ""malandi.""Religion should never be the basis of what is legal and illegal.

Sunshine,"""Sunshine"" is one of the most important Filipino films of all time as it sheds light on the struggles of women in a conservative country that shames them for not embracing motherhood in any circumstance. It's a powerful story that teaches viewers about empathy, bravely tackling a sensitive topic about women's rights and the dangers women like Sunshine face when a country punishes them for making choices about their future instead of giving them the proper care and support they need.Director Antoinette Jadaone is a creative genius. She masterfully tells the story of ""Sunshine"" in a manner that opens hearts and minds. Hopefully, this movie achieves its dual purpose: To spark healthy conversations about women's health & rights and to encourage people to show kindness and understanding to the ""Sunshines"" of the world. Sana pagkatapos ng pelikula, mas marami ang magsasabi ng mga salitang: ""gets ko na.""Meanwhile, this outstanding story comes alive beautifully on screen also because of Maris Racal's strong performance.

Sunshine was not just about the system failing women and their needs, but also tackles the sad reality that Filipinos are still entangled with the conservative and traditional principles they hold. It wasn’t just Sunshine who was being forced to adapt to the system, it was most of the women in Sunshine’s life. I love how the film was almost depicted like it was a horror movie. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a coincidence that I noticed this detail. It was meant to be like that—Manila being a horrible and disgusting place to live, day or night. With that being said, you couldn’t blame those who would draw parallels with Lino Brocka’s Maynila.I feel like each character was written purposely for each actor. The way Direk Tonet writes each character in her stories is always in detail and intentional.

The supporting characters did what they were meant to - help tell her story without stealing the spotlight.What stood out to me visually was how natural everything felt. The cinematography wasn’t overly stylized, but it matched the tone and mood perfectly. Set against the harsh backdrop of Manila, the film captured that mix of grit, morality, and religion in a way that felt all too real. It opens up an important conversation about sex education, teenage pregnancy, and abortion - topics we often shy away from, but ones that need to be talked about.More than anything, Sunshine shows how hard it is to be a woman in a world that’s stuck and unforgiving. It doesn’t scream its message, but it stays with you. If there really is such a thing as a “best,” this might just be one of Jadaone’s strongest works and definitely Maris Racal’s best performance yet.",2025-07-25,positive,0.9922661185264587,1

Sunshine,"We are in a limbo. So much of Philippine cinema, especially that which makes the rounds in local and international film festivals, is stuck churning out “groundbreaking” firsts. Because our cultural discourse is so behind, our filmmakers are tasked not only with telling stories, but also with inventing the stories to be told. They’re required to stake out new thematic ground, not in service of aesthetic evolution, but simply to keep up with the global conversation. The cost of this is a cinema that often feels overburdened with didactic intent and undernourished in emotional and formal rigor.In a particularly polarizing gesture, Jadaone introduces a hallucinated child character, a device that indirectly echoes Jojo Rabbit (2019). But this choice results in jarring tonal shifts that muddle the film’s emotional center. What was perhaps intended as farce to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour. It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility. In fact, by personifying an unborn child as a character which speaks and thinks, then Sunshine unintentionally reinforces the very moral framing that anti-abortion rhetoric thrives on. It circles back into the age-old “when does life begin?” debate—a question that continues to paralyze policymaking in the country, even when the conversation should be about autonomy, access, and proper healthcare. The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, literalizes it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics. What’s more revealing than the film itself is the discourse surrounding it: a ubiquity of gender-essentialist and bioessentialist defenses, as if any critique of any form is automatically a threat to representation. That instinct: to guard a film’s cause rather than evaluate its craft just proves how far behind we are as a nation in talking about gender politics in filmmaking. The refusal to embrace genuinely revolutionary tactics, whether in politics or art, has kept us coasting on the optics of progress ever since.Full review for the Kinoise Substack published here",2025-07-24,positive,0.6980586051940918,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is the product of the environment that failed her. It's an excellent movie that's blatantly shows how women are being boxed with limited rights and decisions in their lives with her being a young gymnast who is forced to weigh her personal dreams against societal expectations. What makes the film compelling is how honest and raw it is which made it difficult and easy to digest at the same time. It's difficult to digest since the film doesn't sugarcoat nor romanticize, it confronts. It slaps us with the reality that our system is really crooked when it comes to having the options such as abortion which draws you into Sunshine’s emotional turmoil. It's also easy to sort out as well as the film itself utilized a lot of symbolism and metaphor that's very comprehensible to the young audience since it was depicted in way of being simple and straightforward.This is the kind of film that should have been made long ago. Its themes were not only relevant, but urgent not only within the country but the world.

Sunshine,"Sunshine isn't afraid to show what it truly means to be a woman in the modern world. In a society where your choices are often shamed, imposed, or forced into the very core of your identity, Sunshine remains steadfast in her decisions. We are too unforgiving towards women—too critical, too much of everything. And for a 19-year-old girl simply wanted to chase her dream, who are we to shame her for the choices she takes pride in?The film is heavy, filled with thrilling sequences and beautiful picturesque cinema that adds an insightful edge to its narrative. It doesn't shy away from the realities of living in Manila, where everything is muddy, dreary, and dried in irony. It reminded me at different tangents of Black Swan and Manila in the Claws of Light—a woman haunted by the consequences of her actions while navigating Manila's streets with weary kindness and understanding.All I can say is, ""Gets ko na.""

Sunshine,"In a country where a uterus can feel like a prison, Sunshine breaks through the silence with a scream.This is not just a film—it’s a rebellion against a system that punishes Filipinas for daring to survive.What a fearless and necessary filmz Sunshine dares to confront a brutal reality in a country where abortion remains illegal and where women’s rights are often reduced to whispers—silenced by false morality and systemic neglect.Antoinette Jadaone’s storytelling isn’t just intimate; it is a searing indictment of how the state and even the healthcare system fail Filipinas. This film reminds us that every choice a woman makes is shaped by power structures that shame her, control her body, and turn compassion into judgment. Through Sunshine’s journey, we see how being a woman in the Philippines means living in a constant struggle for autonomy—ang hirap maging babae, pero mas triple ang hirap ng mga babae dito sa Pilipinas.Sunshine is not just a movie; it is a mirror held up to a society that polices women’s bodies while abandoning them in their most vulnerable moments. It’s a rallying cry for the Sunshines, Theas, Helenas, Geleens, and Edens of this country—voices we must hear, stories we must protect.May this film be the turning point for our generation: progressive, pro-women, and unapologetically pro-choice.Thank you to the entire Sunshine team and SM Cinemas for making this powerful narrative accessible by lowering ticket prices.

Sunshine,"Maris Racal is astonishing as she gives a star-making performance in Antoinette Jadaone's finest film yet. Sunshine takes us by the hand in a bustling Quiapo that's full of hypocrisy, contradiction, and a brutal system on women and their bodies. It's a random odyssey of a woman trying to take back what is her's in an unforgiving conservative society. In the film's opening moments, we see an ambitious athlete confused and paralyzed with the news of her untimely pregnancy. She's scared and she's prolonging the agony of confronting the inevitable. One thing that some people may ask is, why doesn't she immediately ask anyone for help? Doesn't she have a family? Why is she trying to deal with such a serious problem on her own? Is this the society that we've grown into? Where a young woman is so afraid and paralyzed to get any help that she risks her life trying to deal with it on her own? The answer is a resounding YES. We are living in a country where dominant beliefs and religion are shoved down in women's throats even if it means giving up their dreams. Where young women are scorned and defined by their mistakes instead of being educated and getting a strong support system. Most egregiously, we live in a society that stigmatizes and punishes women but tolerates the very system, and actions that led to their unwanted pregnancies. That is the society that Jadaone perfectly paints in this harrowing film. Jadaone uses Quiapo as the backdrop to tell this story as she blends elements of neorealism and magic realism. This film has a great sense of place as Sunshine roams around a Quiapo that hides hypocrisy underneath its Catholic cathedral. Jadaone goes full Brocka mode through these scenes as she showcases different communities and people through a neorealist lens. That's why I found the film's surrealist tendencies to be a little bit jarring. Sunshine encounters a kid that appears only through her consciousness and it really makes you wonder if this type of storytelling fits the themes that Jadaone is exploring. It just runs the risk of making it too melodramatic and undercutting its authenticity. But what keeps it from going off the rails is her unwavering compassion and understanding of Sunshine's plight. Direk Tonet did mention in the Q&A session after that she swore that she was gonna hold Sunshine's hands and be by her side through every turbulence she'll face while writing this movie. In the film's third act, the neorealist and magic realist narratives just blend into a powerful, poignant, and profound moment while Sunshine practices her routine one last time. I think this is a film that our country desperately needs right now. It's bound to spark debates and fruitful discussions about abortion, reproductive health, and women's right. Some may disagree with what Sunshine ended up doing, but at least this is a film that ignites a discussion for these taboo topics. I will never know how it feels to be a woman in an unfairly conservative country. But this film rings with so much vitality, bravery, and honesty that I just cried by the end of it. This is so damn close to being a masterpiece. Gets ko na!",2025-07-23,positive,0.9710016846656799,1

Sunshine,"Maybe most ingenious about Sunshine is its willingness to accept the decision to abort likely also involves a negotiation with the unborn child, maybe even a plea for forgiveness—less from God, because getting that would be easy, and in fact Sunshine gets it out of the way early on, but more from who the child would have been. For the film indeed that is the longer battle, and it affords Sunshine a long array of events that could make the explaining easier. She sees her dilemma reflected in the city's decay, her choice—which she readily makes—put into perspective, rounded out, by another girl's inaccess to that choice. Very carefully, and backed by research, Jadaone dissects what that choice may mean for women like Sunshine in a developing city like Manila, where dreams are scarce and their fulfillment even rarer. Sunshine's choice is an act of self-determination, in a world where that's seen as vulgar, irreverent: that is clear. But to what should reverence be owed, in any case? Sunshine argues it's simply a matter of priority. When Sunshine chooses her dream—which she's been carrying in her womb longer than she's known her unborn child's ghost—we empathize with her, as does the ghost. That shows the film’s executed its heavy work.",2025-07-25,positive,0.9474266171455383,1

Sunshine,"a lot of things were going on in my mind after watching this. mimicking what my friends say about this, it is indeed an important movie which hopefully, can open the doors for discussing the decriminalization of abortion and better, making the state strive toward a world that would not need it in the first place. quoting from one of my eye-opening reads this year, which greatly sums up my thoughts about abortion:“…focusing solely on the ‘right’ to have an abortion obscured the many other determining factors around childbirth, child-rearing and family. It absolved the state of its responsibilities to create the support mechanisms for raising families. If the decision to have a child is simply a woman’s choice, the responsibility for the well-being of children is shifted onto mothers instead of the society in which children are raised.”feminism, interrupted: disrupting power by lola olufemiinterestingly, what struck me the most was the portrayal of manila and the people living in it. kaya kahit alam kong marumi, masikip, at mausok ang maynila, it feels alive and weirdly enough, i get comfort from it as it highlights how much of it stems from our collectivist culture.random pero napansin ko rin na whenever kids swear in this movie, medyo pilit at nagiging borderline darryl-yap-style of filmmaking for me lmao  anyways dami kong ebas (na puro disconnected ideas) pero i feel like the movie needs a little more push and it would be harsh to confine it into a rating kasi importanteng movie siya so di ko na lang talaga lagyan hahahaha but overall it’s a nice watch. star-studded sha jshdhdjshs",2025-07-25,positive,0.9929963946342468,25

Sunshine,"If there’s anything that is uniquely Filipino in terms of interior design, it’s the green walls. It generally evokes feelings of tranquility and harmony, but Jadaone’s latest film flips it around to signify chaos and dysfunction. The color is almost everywhere, it’s inescapable: the walls of the protagonist’s home, the sterile and hostile clinic spaces, even the motel where the film’s lead almost died, comparable to the grip Catholicism has on the Philippines. While they say there’s a separation between the church and the state, it’s barely upheld in practice, as they hinder human rights that could save thousands of lives. And yes, I am talking about abortion laws, or the lack thereof here in my country. Jadaone’s Sunshine addresses the huge elephant in the senate, as it depicts the life of its titular lead (Maris Racal), whose life is turned upside down due to a sudden news of her own pregnancy. It’s easy to blame women like Sunshine for getting pregnant. After all, she’s presented as a domineering figure in her sport, even bound to compete in the Olympics, and she technically practiced unsafe sex, but not every case of unwanted pregnancy is like that.There are multiple shots where Sunshine is physically separated by a fence-like barrier: be it the metal gates in the church, the ever-stretching horizontal jeepney rails, or the cold and black window frames, that subtly signal how Filipinas are imprisoned by their surroundings. Almost every gratingly infuriating, thought-provoking, and ludicrous dialogue circles back to one simple question: why is it that women are the ones penalized and restricted on matters that could jeopardize their own health and safety, especially in pregnancies caused by rape and incest?While watching, I was constantly reminded of a film with similar thematic points, that of Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, and how women need to be discreet, travel thousands of miles, and suffer in silence over matters that should be openly discussed and not considered taboo or immoral. If anything, I think this film is being highly censored in the Philippines, as the movie review board slapped an R-16 rating on a film that should be watched by teenagers. How can we avoid teenage pregnancies when our government avoids talking about practicing safe sex to the right demographic? Not everyone gets a happy conclusion like Sunshine did, so I hope that this film sparks a necessary conversation about women’s rights outside of the walls of movie theaters. Jadaone’s Sunshine is truly one of the Philippines’ best releases of the year so far, in both its themes and execution, and a must-watch for all types, especially men and the religious-alike.

Sunshine,"We watched Sunshine yesterday, July 24, during the block screening at SM Megamall. I had seen the trailer beforehand, so I knew we were in for something bold, something necessary. But I wasn’t prepared for how deeply it would sit with me long after the credits rolled.I didn’t cry while watching the film, but once it ended, I found myself overwhelmed. The weight of Sunshine doesn’t hit all at once — it lingers, it settles. And it stays.At its core, Sunshine is the story of a woman taking control of her body in a society that keeps telling her she isn’t allowed to. It’s not simply about one choice, one moment, or one woman. It’s about the collective experience of many Filipinas who navigate a system that consistently fails to hear them.Antoinette Jadaone’s direction doesn’t shy away from discomfort. She faces it head-on, inviting the audience to confront the silences we’ve learned to live with - about abortion, reproductive rights, the stigma around sexuality, and the lack of access to informed sex education in the Philippines.Sunshine is timely, urgent, and painfully real. It gives voice to the cry of our generation, echoing the need for progressive reforms that protect women and children. The film challenges its viewers not just to empathize, but to act.As a viewer, I left the cinema not only moved, but also awakened. Sunshine isn’t here to entertain. It’s here to disturb, to provoke, and to push us into uncomfortable yet necessary conversations.To my fellow Filipinos: let’s not turn away. Let’s create spaces where women can speak freely, where choices about their bodies are met with compassion, not judgment. Let’s demand that our lawmakers stop treating reproductive health as taboo.To filmmakers and storytellers: keep telling these stories. We need more films like Sunshine—bold, unapologetic, and grounded in truth. The personal is political, and cinema has the power to move both heart and policy.Let Sunshine be a beginning. Let it be a spark. And let’s keep the conversation going.",2025-07-24,positive,0.978285014629364,1

Sunshine,"Walang Sunshine sa mundong patas.Hindi ko mapigilang ihalintulad ang Maynilang ipinapakita ng Sunshine sa Maynila na kung saan nakilala si Lino Brocka. Amoy mo ang malamayang usok ng mga sasakyan at hindi mo na ito kailanman malabas sa iyong sistema. Mahapdi ang tirik ng araw sa balat. Ramdam mo ang pawis sa balikat ng bawat kasalubong na para bang ramdam mo na rin ang bitbit nilang bigat. Rinig mo ang ingay ng mga umiiyak na sanggol sa kapitbahay at pati ang nakabibinging busina ng tren na dumadaan sa Avenida. In a Quiapo churchyard, abortion pills are sold right across the “abortion is a sin” signages. In a cramped hospital, the doctor who preaches their kind and merciful God is the same one who will shame you until you are forced to say I’m sorry, God, repenting a thousand times not to a benevolent being, but to a woman in a coat. Four women, round bellies squeezing against each other, share only two small hospital beds. Hundreds more in that one tiny room, some whose dreams never saw the light of day. I’ve had two girls already. You’re so lucky that your child is a boy. The horrifying realization that 13 isn’t even the youngest of them.Hindi mabait ang mundo, at mas lalong hindi sayo mabait ang mundo kung babae ka. But sometimes, it takes just a sliver of warmth to remind you that you are not alone. The kind that comes from the ate sa botika who hands you a pregnancy test without judgement. The kind that comes from your best friend texting they love you right when you don’t know if you’re making the right choice. Or the kind that comes from the gentle caress of a young girl bleeding out, telling you she does not want to die in the back of a police car. How you can sense that the fear in her voice is also the one that crept up on you days before, as the motel lady put you in tricycle telling the driver to hurry to the hospital. I’ve always found the word “ate” to be a strong signifier of the tight the bonds between Filipina women. We may not know each other, but we know that we carry similar burdens. Call a woman ate and their heads turn with instinct. The film does not only show you the grim, unrelenting, cruel Manila that takes (and claws) more than it gives. Nor does it exclusively show you the girlhood that was stolen from you by the capitalistic and patriarchal structures so deeply embedded in society.Yes, it shows you that. It does not hold back from showing you how tiresome it is to clean the poo of a newborn or how much more easy it is to find empathy in illegal markets than it is in public institutions. Yet, what it also shows you is that whenever you feel like a lone speck of light in the dark, just call an ate. Ask them for help. Rest on their shoulders. You are all each of you has. The film itself does its job of telling an important story beautifully. One of the key narrative devices may be a bit too on the nose for some viewers, but I find that it adds a sort of tangibility and gravity to the story that otherwise would have been missing some heart and soul without it. Tonet’s directing is sharp and focused on such visceral and visual contradictions. Racal is bursting with passion and rage…vulnerable…and stellar. Everyone from her coach and older sister down to the younger kids our titular character meets held so much weight in their portrayals. Noong pinapanood ko, ang nasa isip ko, tunay na tao ‘tong mga pinapanood ko. Walang Sunshine sa mundong patas. Ngunit, hindi patas ang mundo natin. Kaya mabuti nalang at may pelikulang ganito (in a country where abortion is illegal, at that). Mabuti nalang na sa bawat lalaking kagaya ni Miggy at Bobot na nagdidesisyon para sa buhay ng kababaihan, may mga katulad ni Sunshine na hindi takot i-reclaim ang kababaihan niya.

Sunshine,"Sinugod and Bagyo at Baha Para Kay #SunshineMovie May mga pelikulang tumatagos hindi lang sa mata, kundi pati sa kaluluwa. At sa mga pelikula ni Direk @tonetjadaone, ramdam na ramdam ko 'yan!I’ve recently been staying in Manila for a few months now. I've walked through Quiapo and the surrounding areas, felt the pulse of the city, and Sunshine just nailed it – physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Ang gulo mo, Manila, pero grabe ang vibrancy mo! Para akong nasa loob mismo ng pelikula, bawat sulok, bawat ingay, bawat damdamin, kumakapit.Gano'n din ang naramdaman ko sa That Thing Called Tadhana. Amats na amats ko 'to! Hindi lang dahil sa hugot story, kundi dahil sa pagkakalarawan nito sa Baguio at Sagada. In fact, I've been frequenting Baguio because of its impact – hindi lang dahil sa kuwento, kundi sa kung paano nito ipinakita ang Baguio at Sagada sa audience.Both movies made me cry! There's something so raw and real in how Direk Jadaone captures the essence of these places and the human emotions within them. It's more than just a story; it's an experience.I watched Sunshine on the same day as Fantastic Four, and while I enjoyed both, there's no question for me: this movie, Sunshine, should be watched in cinemas, as a community. It's a communal experience, something that sparks conversations and shared emotions. 'Yung Fantastic Four, pwede na 'yan sa Disney Plus kung tight ang budget. But Sunshine? It deserves the big screen, the collective gasps, and the shared tears.I genuinely hope this movie reaches everyone's radar. SANA MA GETS NYO NA RIN.

Sunshine,"Bakit? Nanay ba kita? Gut-wrenching and brave, Sunshine speaks truth with honesty and feminine rage in a heartbreaking story of womanhood, a character study that puts a young woman, an aspiring Olympian in the most harrowing ordeal — pursue her dreams or let go of it, continue her pregnancy or terminate it. In a country where traditions and conservatism plague our sociopolitical landscape, and at a time where the world at large is being corrupted by right-wing fundamentalists, Sunshine stands with a strong pro-choice message; that women should have the rights to bodily autonomy despite the patriarchal structures that harp on religious preachings in which our women have to pay social costs or worse, their own lives and safety. At the center of it is Sunshine, played by the brilliant Maris Racal whose tenacious yet delicate character work put so much layers to a heartfelt protagonist. In the first 10 minutes alone, Racal delivered a string of unbridled emotions, from being flushed with regret, anger and desperation, she grew with intensity, defiance and vulnerability. Her resolve is one of strength and a moving emotional core that’s unshakeable while being present in every turn in Sunshine’s dilemma in which we met the most colorful and textured cast of unusual characters. Even with Racal’s stellar lead performance, every supporting actor also put on a remarkable stamp that not only served their scenes but also the entire story. From Jennica Garcia to Annika Co to Elijah Canlas to Meryl Soriano to Xyriel Manabat to Angeli Bayani to Rhed Bustamante to Piolo Pascual, it’s perfectly casted and Jadaone made sure that they deliver a well-calibrated turn for Sunshine’s story. A chilling and entrancing dissection of womanhood, the film shifts gears as a sports movie to a melodrama injected with some satire, absurdity, and a mystical element, it’s full of inspired creative choices that are in full concerto. With its spectacular cinematography and production design from drab and somber interiors with a hint of natural light or sometimes depressing fluorescent light, to neon-tinged urban areas where chaos lingers just around the corner while also capturing Sunshine’s extraordinary close-ups behind window railings that cage her or framed by her vibrant pink ribbon; its outstanding sound design that puts Sunshine’s inner turmoil at the center of a noisy Manila and blends a surrealist element to its heart; and a formidable original music that juxtaposes Sunshine’s personality from her life as an gymnast to her personal life. Sunshine is an urgent film that needs to be seen and heard, there’s power in its universality and Tonet Jadaone’s feminist voice soars with an elevated storytelling. Beaming with Filipino sensibilities and humour, its melodrama is used with beautiful intent while being grounded and playing with raw emotional reactions from the cast, and levity and grit in its screenplay. And as cliche as it sounds, it’s a totally different Jadaone that made this movie. There’s maturity that put her titular character at the center of a well-crafted film but there’s this restraint we haven’t seen before that refined the story’s message without ever being didactic. Undoubtedly, her best film yet, an opus that cements her place as an important voice in Philippine cinema but also a landmark film that tackles subject matters that only a handful of Filipino filmmakers have touched on. An absolute achievement in today’s climate of Filipino cinema, there’s power in its tone and its themes — a protest that exposes controlling hypocritical men and medical professionals, and an interrogation of a systemic inequality full of government’s shortcomings in giving proper care and support for unwanted pregnancies, in a place where poverty and overpopulation have been a decade-long problem. But also in Sunshine, we found hope and her light in confronting her reality while finding women who helped and listened to her, a kind of feminism that celebrates sisterhood even in the most horrifying circumstance in a woman’s life. With high hopes, this should spark a conversation about women’s struggles and rights. In light of the overturning of Roe v Wade in the US, akin to Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Sunshine’s story is real and rampant in the PH, and as disturbing as it sounds, unsafe abortion have been killing 1 in 3 Filipinas each day. —————This reminded me of a podcast conversation I once listened to about a woman talking to her mother at a time she’s getting to know her more as an adult. She’s learning about her mom’s history and asked her if her mother ever wondered about living that life instead of having her. Of course the mother responded that she’s happy that she’s born and she’s her child. To which she replied with, “if I didn’t happen, YOU would have been born.”I think motherhood is beautiful but do you ever wonder what kind of woman your mother would have been if society gave them the rights to choose or their religion didn’t make them to aspire to fit into a mold of a woman? Maybe she could have been a president or she could have invented the cure to HIV/AIDS? Who knows?",2025-07-26,positive,0.8089647889137268,1

Sunshine,"Too often, films about abortion fall into the trap of emotional manipulation, when they push a specific agenda, reducing a complex issue to a simplistic, black-and-white narrative. But Sunshine rises above that pattern.Instead, the film offers a nuanced portrayal of the struggles (and even rage) experienced by women who are denied access to reproductive healthcare - told with such compassion and delicacy that you cannot help but empathize with and root for Sunshine because the conservative society has failed her. I hope many people get to watch the film because it is both a deeply personal and universal story that casts a light on one of the most pressing crises in the country: teenage pregnancy. And I also hope Sunshine ushers in a healthy and open conversation because women deserve the right to make decisions for themselves. This is the kind of film I’ll be thinking for days kasi ang bigat pero napaka-cathartic panoorin. And it features a talented (and reliable) ensemble of actors - napakahuhusay ng lahat, lalo na ng mga kababaihan.",2025-07-25,positive,0.9892430305480957,1

Sunshine,"Direk Tonet Jadaone holds a mirror up in the middle of Quiapo and asks the question: what is the proper protocol to take control of your life? Does the prayer come before or after the abortifacient? Does the boyfriend have to take it too? Sunshine, as a film and as a character, is bold and unwavering. She doesn't preach or ask for pity. She doesn't beg for the forgiveness of her boyfriend or the religious. The story is clear all through out -- Sunshine has made her decision, and while she seeks understanding, she seeks it only from those who matter, not from the audience and definitely not from the holier-than-thou.While Sunshine embarks on her journey to find answers, we never forget what she is -- a young girl in the Philippines, left to deal with the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy alone. It is so easy to put the blame on women or on impulsive, lustful teenagers, but the film reminds us that in a country where religious biases trump teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality rates, pointing fingers helps no one. The film reminds us that for women and other marginalized sectors, the first line of defense against systemic neglect is community.Brave and unfiltered, I can easily see Sunshine becoming a Filipino classic. What a beautifully written, directed, and acted film. This is Direk Tonet's best so far, and definitely a career-defining performance for Maris Racal. Gets ko na.

Sunshine,"Heavy raindrops were like meteorites landing on the pockmarked pavements of Manila when we braved two storms to catch the screening of Sunshine. Our tuktuk carried only three passengers: me, my partner, and another man—seven people short of the usual full ride as it had been a week of rain with flooding which meant classes and government work were cancelled. When it rained harder, our driver couldn’t help but mutter Tama na. Gutom na kami.It’s hunger borne out of poverty that limits, if not entirely removes, the access of ordinary Filipinos to watch important films such as Sunshine. Like any other works of art attempting to feature parts and parcels of Philippine society, etched on its tapestry is the signature Manila mayhem: masikip, mabaho, maingay and magulo.But the structure of the film is far from chaotic despite the complicated and challenging subject Direk Antoinette Jadaone took upon herself to flesh out. The stakes were high and indeed pushed the protagonist to do what she thought needs to be done. Her point was clear and warranted no further elaboration. Maris Racal was stellar in her portrayal of an aspiring Olympian who got pregnant at the blossoming of her career as a young athlete. The same can be said about the equally astounding young actress Annika Co who was a perfect foil to Racal’s character.The film, with its shorter than usual run time of barely an hour and a half minutes, didn’t hold back in driving its message, leaving nothing open for interpretation. Towards the end where Sunshine was performing her routine, I thought for a moment that her beaming towards the camera with her majestic ribbon would be the final shot of the film. But when the young Annika was shown watching Sunshine finish gracefully finishing her performance and embracing her when it ended, that was when I realized, gets ko na, that in this narrative, she would have a choice, one that's entirely her own.Direk Tonet has managed to make such a compact film about choice. While choice for women is such a privilege in a conservative country like ours, there’s something powerful in showing that Sunshine made a choice, one that goes against the conventional. While other films of the same topic would leave it to the audience to ponder whether or not the protagonist would choose the controversial choice, Sunshine showed us that yes, she did that!After the end credits have rolled, we were left staring at the black screen, perhaps, feeling fulfilled, weighed upon, or hungrier than ever for films of the same caliber. Sunshine is so monumental for Philippine cinema that it reaffirms one of my aspirations, that one day, Filipinos can have the choice about what films to watch in the cinema every weekend, not choose just either one—satisfying their physiological hunger or fulfilling the hunger of the soul.",2025-07-25,positive,0.9094199538230896,20

Sunshine,"“GETS KO NA.”First things first, thank you Direk Antoinette Jadaone for being so brave. Our country badly needs films that dare to confront the cries and injustices our society (esp women) continue to face. Sunshine is a soft, aching plea for change. It’s a quiet but urgent cry for body autonomy, for choice, for justice. And it’s not just about one woman’s pain — it’s rooted in something deeper: a system that has long failed us, most esp women, in this country.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9546144604682922,-1
Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine begins with control. With poise, with the perfect arabesque, and with the precision of a gymnast that is ready for the next move. But as the film moves along, the tension in the stillness builds up and begins to show. Behind the clean flow and rhythm of theribbon, the rehearsed elegance of the body is still pushed to their limit. Sunshine feels like a cruel misdirection, but the contrast is exactly the point that womanhood needs.In a country where abortion is still illegal without exceptions, Sunshine doesn’t just tell the story of a young woman’s crisis. It captures a quiet violence of expectation, the pressure to remain graceful even when they are under a system that does not allow women to fail, to choose, or even to speak freely. In the Philippines, the Revised Penal Code punishes abortion with imprisonment, while access to safe and legal procedures remains out of reach for most women, especially those who are young and unfortunate. Punishment because of abortion with imprisonment, and this legal stance is reinforced by deeply rooted religious conservatism. It is not just illegal—it is unthinkable. The stigma runs deep, and the silence surrounding it is even deeper.According to the Center for Reproductive Rights (2023), thousands of women are forced into this silence every year. Estimated around 1.1 million Filipino women induce abortion annually. About 1,000 of Filipinas die each year from abortion-related complications, and over 100,000are hospitalized due to unsafe procedures. These numbers are not just statistics, they are lives of the young, scared, and the unheard. Sunshine puts that reality front and center, but does so without shouting. It doesn’t force emotion, it lets it build naturally. This film follows Sunshine as she navigates through the aftermath of a missed period, a distracted boyfriend, and a society that offers no legal, safe, or accessible options. She’s left to carry the weight of a decision she didn’t choose, in a system that treats her body like public property.Sunshine (played by Maris Racal) is a kind character with stillness that feels like a resistance. Her performance is tight, contained, and filled with the kind of fear that is quiet and does not seek and beg for sympathy. A character with a facade that represents many generations of women where they mask all of their feelings and hold on to the thought that “this too shall pass”.She is not trying to explain herself, she is simply trying to breathe and move in a world that keeps on closing in. Racal does not rely on big breakdowns or dramatic lines. She holds her ground even when that ground is crumbling beneath her. Every look, every breath, feels calibrated. Like someone preparing for a landing they know they might not even survive. What makes the performance even more powerful is how familiar Sunshine feels. She is notwritten as an extraordinary character. She is a regular young woman, navigating school, relationships, and the uncertainty of early adulthood. She could be any girl from any province, any city, any university. That ordinariness is important. Because it reminds us that this story isnot rare. It is not fiction. It is the quiet, constant reality of so many young women in this country who are forced to navigate the consequences of a decision they didn’t even get to make.Jadaone doesn’t push for spectacle. The film sits with silence and discomfort. No overdramatization and overexplanation. Her braveness has a place in Philippine Cinema as this take and storytelling of hers about abortion in a world where systems and institutions are fallingshort, the quiet resistance of Sunshine speaks volume. Instead of turning the film into a message movie, Jadaone chooses to linger. She doesn’t try to solve anything. She doesn’t pretend that resolution is possible. And that’s what makes Sunshine hit even harder. The film doesn’t just show the problem, it lets us sit in it. It allows discomfort to stretch across the screen without rushing to ease it. That discomfort mirrors what many women feel in real life. The shame. The fear. The confusion. The silence that comes not from peace, but from pressure.It also explores the feelings through visuals. Pao Orendain, the Cinematographer of the film captures the feel of the City of Manila. How it is familiar inside the streets, but also how suffocating it is. The noise pollution that is made by the vehicles, the streets filled with conversations, and the trains rattling as it passes by. The way they captured it, Manila is just another place where it forces the characters to move carefully, just like any other people who lives, visits, and goes to Manila to reclaim life. The streets hum with life, but not always with warmth. The camera observes from a distance, never forcing perspective but always aware of the space Sunshine must navigate.What makes Sunshine stand out is that it never asks permission to tell this story. It does not frame abortion as a debate, or as an issue that needs to be justified. It centers the experience without apology. In doing so, it offers a kind of cinematic resistance that feels rare in Philippine cinema. Jadaone’s choice to tell this story without moralizing, without preaching, without forcing catharsis, gives it more weight than any dramatic scene ever could.And in a country that still debates whether women should have that right, Sunshine lands, not perfectly, but with all the force of someone who has had enough. Someone who knows she deserves more. And that is enough to shake the ground beneath her, even if no one else is watching. Like a gymnast mid-tumble, it shows how much strength it takes just to survive a fall.And sometimes, survival is the bravest routine of all.Gets na gets kita, Sunshine.",2025-07-24,positive,0.9290935397148132,1
Sunshine,"This review features some spoilers.In local cinema, as with mainstream media, there’s a dearth of films tackling abortion. 12 Weeks, Anna Isabelle Matutina’s Cinemalaya feature debut, was the latest attempt I could recall, or at least one that had something useful to say. At the same time, a comprehensive sexuality education integrated at all education levels (separate from the education department’s sex ed order), as proposed in the anti-teenage pregnancy bill, has been under fire from the country’s conservative population.Into this frantic context emerges Sunshine, the latest indie darling from writer-director Antoinette Jadaone. The sole Philippine entry in the Centrepiece section of the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, the film finally comes home. It’s making its local premiere exclusively at SM cinemas, after touring the international film fest circuit to critical renown, including the Crystal Bear for Best Film at this year’s Berlin International Film Festival.But make no mistake, as the picture refuses to be singled out as an “abortion film,” a descriptor so sweeping and limiting that it is seen only vis-à-vis morality. Jadaone finds new ammo with which to make sense of the polarizing topic: gymnastics. (The film’s TIFF world premiere, in fact, came at the heels of gymnast Carlos Yulo’s double Olympic gold in Paris.)The sports drama unfolds through the title character, played by Maris Racal, a young gymnast whose preparation for national tryouts is upended after discovering she’s pregnant. Refusing to compromise her shot at Olympic glory, with her useless boyfriend (Elijah Canlas) almost instantly ditching her, Sunshine resorts to illegal abortifacients offered by Manila’s underbelly, where she runs into an enigmatic young girl (Annika Go) bent on tracking her every move and policing her every decision. Soon, she internalizes biblical shame.Sunshine follows Jadaone’s feminist inclinations. Her directorial debut Six Degrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay (2011), is a raw mockumentary that doubles as a compelling paean to the titular screen bit actress, whose name is nearly synonymous with Philippine horror but has largely remained underappreciated. In Never Not Love You (2018), Nadine Lustre’s Joanne is a breadwinner who trades a long-awaited job promotion in Manila for a fraught chance to begin anew and dream together with her privileged boyfriend in London, only to wrestle with the punishing economics of romance. Fan Girl (2020) explores the dark side of being a superfan through a female character who’s a proxy for the film’s articulation about the psychology of idle worship in a nation forever beholden to it.Shortcomings of these movies aside, Jadaone insists on narratives that do not treat and present the female gaze as though it’s self-explanatory. The director often edges toward gray areas and destabilizing standpoints, whether or not they wind up humorous, fascinating, schmaltzy, or troubling.Whereas Jadaone’s previous movies are attuned to the conventions of their respective genres, Sunshine offers something new to the director’s dramaturgical defaults. The film is an intersection of neorealism and magical realism. It trains the camera on Manila’s grime, decay, and nonstop noise, embracing its outcasts and harsh truths (the Lino Brocka comparisons are inevitable), just as it punctuates the gritty reality with a magical invocation via the imaginary friend that trails Sunshine.“Media literacy” would tell you that the spectral presence is a representation of the internal-external friction the heroine deals with; fetus in the flesh and the body that refuses to carry it; the back-and-forth between morality and pragmatism. (Jadaone, in an interview with Filmmaker Magazine, revealed she was inspired by the imaginary character in Taika Waititi’s 2019 satirical drama Jojo Rabbit.) But beyond this, the make-believe figure is a surrogate for the conservative, pro-life fraction of the audience, with the director opting to engage in the subject matter’s complexity instead of comfortably locating the film in an echo chamber. While the narrative device could prove as an apparent play at sympathy, indulging in a “will she, won’t she” kind of thinking (surface-level reading could also suggest that women seeking abortion are deluded, ridiculous as that implication might sound), it also offers access to the broader violence disguised as “conscience” that puts women, regardless of gender identities, at a disadvantage.If anything, Sunshine is less about the act of abortion itself than about the systems that encourage women to settle for dehumanizing rights already decided for them by a patriarchal few, systems that prohibit them from dreaming, and tell them that to dream only means more labor, nothing more.Sunshine, like Petersen Vargas’ Some Nights I Feel Like Walking (which made its Philippine premiere in June), harnesses the metropolis as a character of its own, instead of reducing it to a mere symbolic backdrop. Whereas Some Nights steeps its urban tale in neon erotica, completely absent of daylight, Sunshine shifts between the city’s diurnal and nocturnal environments.Pao Orendain’s camerawork here chiefly reaps magic from close-ups and interior shots, often framed from the window and dotted by a shaft of light (hence the Brocka sentiments), locating the viewer into the heroine’s intimate yet anxious state. The self-induced abortion scene in the sketchy motel, a sight casually interrupted by frantic railway noise, is particularly visceral that you can almost feel the texture of the image.The camera also draws focus to the irony that permeates Manila’s streets, particularly around the vicinity of Quiapo Church, where makeshift stalls selling figurines, scapulars, and all sorts of religious paraphernalia also offer abortion drugs and quack treatments, just as banners declaring “abortion is murder” remain a typical sighting. In other scenes where Sunshine traverses the cityscape, the visuals are more straightforward. Accompanying the images is a soundscape that immersively mirrors the congestion, exhaustion, and urban din that form part of the DNA of the country’s capital.Jadaone’s script nearly leans on the miserablist. When Sunshine finds an opportunity to pull herself out of the vexing situation, poverty immediately gets in the way, leaving her with no choice but to ask her boyfriend for a meager P5,000 to secure the abortion drug and a cheap motel room to perform the deed herself. Yet even in Manila’s hospitals, the conditions are dire; patients are forced to share beds, and hallways are turned into makeshift wards, crowded by people in need of attention beyond the medical. Rape and casual prostitution also get in the way, as in the case of Menggay (Rhed Bustamante), the pregnant 13-year-old Sunshine comes across in Quiapo.In a highlight moment, Sunshine, livid upon meeting her friend’s abuser, suddenly picks up a beer bottle and whacks it over the man’s head, before sprinting to escape the scene. (Curiously, Jadaone plumbs the politics of self-determination by contrasting Sunshine’s ability to decide for herself with Menggay’s distance from that very sense of agency.) Even the Quiapo vendors selling abortifacients, who some might think merely exploit the desperation of their customers, are also victims who simply don’t earn enough.Unflattering as these depictions are, it’s hard to deny that these aren’t routine realities in the social inferno that is the Philippines. Still, there is humor, whether in a scene that involves a knife interrupting a silly argument, or in another that sees a self-righteous doctor preaching the goodness of the divine.As Sunshine, Racal delivers a performance that would be a disservice to reduce to neat superlatives. It’s a physical portrayal that required the actor to undergo training with national gymnastics coaches for nearly a year. It’s a role that might put her in the center of another controversy after barely surviving the previous one. But just as Sunshine is asked to “drown out the noise” whenever she steps on the mat, Racal distills every layer and emotion into a character that’s simply life-like, almost free from the veil of performance-making. Jadaone once told me that her ideal lead performance is one that “is part of something bigger than herself.” There has not been a more worthy portrayal in local cinema this year.At the same time, the movie functions as a reintroduction to the boundless talent of Jennica Garcia, who plays Sunshine’s elder sister, a single mother trying to keep everything intact. Her portrayal expertly captures what a supporting performance should be—one that has enough screentime to be an emotional anchor for the lead but also generates her own moment. There’s a kind of invisible labor informing the character that Garcia encapsulates with an onscreen presence that always feels grounded and never incidental.Sunshine is hardly a social exposé. What ripples throughout this partly winding urban tale is a ready, fatal fact about the place of women in this eternally eroded nation that we’d rather dismiss as “controversial” or “divisive” because we refuse to listen. The film’s visuals might be artful, but they don’t always convey a pretty picture. It’s no coincidence that the movie’s narrative throughline is the community that Sunshine finds in the women around her: her elder sister, her best friend (Xyriel Manabat), despite her initial inhibitions, her coach (Meryll Soriano), the young Menggay, the compassionate doctor (Angeli Bayani), and even the imaginary friend. Though this sense of solidarity comes at varying degrees, it keeps Sunshine afloat and does not let her think of herself as a monster for terminating an unwanted pregnancy.Once Sunshine nears its final shot, I keep thinking of Fan Girl’s insular ending that succeeds its heroine’s already exhausting journey. I’m glad to learn that our heroine this time does not succumb to sheer epiphany. Here, hope actually feels like a tangible possibility instead of an unwarranted emotional wallop.Sunshine is perhaps not Jadaone’s most definitive work; That Thing Called Tadhana (2014) or Never Not Love You might claim that distinction. But it is her sharpest creation yet. It took a whole lot of research and lived experiences to put this story on the screen. It took a bit of time for the film to make its way back to where it started. It’s a miracle that it even got the go signal to be screened publicly. I can already sense all the hot takes and thinkpieces it will generate. And I can only hope that it will be as meaningful as this.This review appears on PhilSTAR Life in a slightly different version.",2025-07-24,positive,0.9311792254447937,-1

Sunshine,"Last year, I saw High School Scandal. Both films share the same throughline that Philippine health care sucks when it comes to pregnancy and sex education. High School Scandal was made in the 80s. The difference being is that Sunshine made me feel hopeful, while High School Scandal made me feel depressed.Here's the thing. Sunshine is a very heavy film, but what makes Sunshine such a heartlifting film to watch is that she had the proper support system whether she decides to keep the child or not. She gets to choose if she wants to carry the baby or not. She has a sister that cares about her well being, a best friend who will do everything for her, and strangely enough, a manifestation of what her child will be. The film shows that women should at the end of the day, have the final choice in matters related to childbirth.Oh and with heavy topic such as this, let women be the major voice in the storytelling. Maris Racal is a powerhouse actress. Antoinette Jadoane is a great writer and director and deserves all the praise in handling such a tough topic.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9644258618354797,1

Sunshine,"“Gets ko na.”In this film, we follow Sunshine, a rhythmic gymnast and an Olympic hopeful, as she travels through Manila’s dark, narrow, grimy, and crowded streets and alleys in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy in a country where abortion is illegal. There are few parts of this film that really stood out to me because they made elevated the movie and made it more compelling.The first part that I really liked is how the city became a living representation of this country’s oppressive stance against anything pro-abortion. The city allowed us to have something tangible, to be able to relate to Sunshine’s struggles even more. Second, the magical realism aspect is also a highlight for me. Once it finally clicked what Ariana and Annika Co’s characters represented, I was blown away. One common argument of those against abortion is that you are going to kill someone who’s probably gonna be a very important person. And yet, we get Annika Co’s character. Through a very powerful performance we end up caring for this kid. But once you start to realize who she us and who she represents, you start to realize that she’s not just an extension of Sunshine but a representative of all babies born to mothers forced to carry a child. She and these babies are vessels forced to carry the unfulfilled dreams of their mothers. She said something like, “Ang pangarap niya ay ang pangarap ko.” And that line broke me. The argument is always, “We are not fulfilling someone’s potential if we abort them.” but there’s always a failure to acknowledge that forcing someone to bear a child is also not allowing them to fulfill their potential.The last part that stood out to me is Maris Racal’s great performance. She is the movie. Without that performance, this film will fall apart and she delivers. What this film did is humanize a debate that’s usually so contentious it ends up being too one dimensional. It made the debate more accessible to every one. The movie is unflinching and raw. A harsh criticism of a society and culture who despite being always proud of their women, continues to fail them by continuing to enabling oppressive systems that mostly targets women. A big middle finger to a society that still strongly reeks of misogyny. It also an exploration of the country’s broken healthcare system. This film is a celebration of female friendships and sisterhood. The people who helped Sunshine in her journey are women. It forces you to be uncomfortable. It forces you to think and have empathy. This film is highly relevant and should be a required watching for everyone. Probably one of the most important Filipino films ever made. Hope it gets an even wider release.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9753217697143555,-1

Sunshine,"we meet sunshine through her battle of being an olympian. armored by her well-worn asian games shirt and her head held high, she shines the brightest among her peers who also look up to her and what more she can become. her coach knows this too, along with her family and lifelong friend, who would all do everything to make sure she achieves them.perhaps its in the nuance of a story that is deeply feminist and human, but antoinette's jadaone's sunshine is the strongest in its ability to capture the realities of adolescent pregnancy with both gentleness and fierce. portraying (albeit sometimes preaching about, but deservingly so) the world of a filipina girl navigating the weight of expectations and the silence surrounding sexual and reproductive health, the story unfolds as a reflection of what we lack and suffer from. this flaw persists in the lesson of consent that was never taught, contraception never offered, the judgment of clinical service providers, the terrifying possibility of dying alone, and the unbearable strength it takes to push forward anyway, not because you’re fearless, but because you must. as a youth. as a woman. as a human with dreams and rights.the reality today is rough: the philippine government failed to pass its version of the adolescent pregnancy prevention bill in the recent senate, the current curriculum and implementation of the comprehensive sexuality education is in question, and more and more right-wing (ish) groups are mobilizing their funds to hinder the fight even more. but hopefully, with these kind of films made accessible to the public, we will be reminded that abortion happens not just because teenagers are risky or that they have been abuse hence it's justified, but because they have the right to decide for themselves.after all, sunshine's every step and every twirl, carries not just her own hope, but the collective dreams of those who raised her, and fought for her to have this. and in watching her take the mat, we are reminded of every girl who dreams of olympic gold, of becoming president, of curing AIDS, and how urgent it is that we believe in them first before some blob of blood. that we talk to them about things that matter. that we care.because when we do, they shine.",2025-07-25,positive,0.9896404147148132,1

Sa mahusay na direksyon ni Direk Tonet ay naipakita ang lahat ng lungkot, saya, at galit ng istorya. Sa tulong din ng iba pang aktor ay mas nagningning ang performance ni Maris Racal bilang Sunshine. Bawat ngiti, sigaw, at iyak ay ramdam ng lahat ng manonood at siguradong dadalhin din nila ito paglabas ng sinehan.Marami pang Sunshine na hindi nabibigyan ng boses at sana sa pagkakataong makasalamuha natin sila, tayo naman ang maka-gets.Makinig.

Applause din for Annika for being a very great addition to the story. Kakaiba din talaga yung paghabi ng istorya dito hindi ko inexpect yung simbolismo niya. Honestly, this is such a strong ensemble as they really made you feel every single emotion that is being evoked in every scene. Idk if mabilis lang ako umiyak pero grabe tulo ng luha ko sa pelikulang ito.Kudos to Direk Tonet for being brave to tackle topics like this.

Sunshine,"Sunshine is a victim of her poor choice. She is a victim to the patriarchal system of the country. It perfectly encapsulates the intersectionality of being impoverished and a woman in the predominantly catholic setting. It is a bold statement to the cruel realities women face, especially the ones at the bottom. She is caged by the system. Jadaone has given justice in telling the plight women face.Sunshine’s character is imperfect and flawed, but real which makes you root for her character. This was emphasized by the camerawork which maintains a certain intimacy with the character that makes you see Sunshine’s vulnerability. Racal portrayal of Sunshine makes you want to empathize with the character because amidst of all the imperfections, there is this young dreamer. Her poor decisions are the consequence of the society she exists in, wherein there is no other choice— leaving her to opt for desperate methods.This film is so personal bilang isang babae.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9031163454055786,1

Sunshine,"Sunshine Is Every Woman Who Dreams Beyond Her CircumstancesSunshine was not created for the sake of making a statement, nor just triggering a conversation; it was meant to make people feel and understand why abortion happens and how our current system makes them dangerous for women. Sunshine did not need to be pitied or root for, she needed to be understood.The film opens and immediately solidifies Sunshine’s ambition. It is anchored on Sunshine’s eagerness to excel, to achieve, to succeed, to be the best, to be an Olympian. And this ambition is not going anywhere. With every tiptoe that Sunshine stands on—as she throws her pink ribbons and gives in to impulse—she stands tall again, catching the ribbons as if they were always meant to fall in the right places… until they don't. Sunshine’s perfect harmony gets disturbed by her sudden realization that she is pregnant. Antoinette Jadaone’s intentional direction on making some scenes too loud, too chaotic, and far too overwhelming added to the personification of Sunshine’s mind; scrambling, panicking, terrored. It was not just Quiapo’s busy streets, it was also Sunshine’s trembling heart. But in between the anxiety and fear, Sunshine gathers the courage to try making a choice—even amidst the confusion. Sunshine finds out in the harshest way possible that a choice is not an option. She is put in a situation where the only way out is to give in to ‘sinful’ acts, dangerous pills, and death-defying abortion attempts. For a young teenager whose dreams seem too far from where she is, this is the only way. While many expect this decision to become the climax of the movie, Sunshine’s story is far from over. In my understanding, the film explored her conscience through Annika Co’s beautifully done character. It reminded the audience that while women consent to abortion, they are still carrying its moral burden. Annika’s character became an instrument to make women who seek abortion feel human, with human conscience and sensibilities. But it was done with such care, careful enough not to make it counterproductive but rather stuck in the ideology of the system that she grew up in.However, Annika’s character is only a personification of Sunshine’s chaotic mind, making Sunshine her own companion to her dawning journey. This character becomes Sunshine’s comfort in the dangers of her abortion attempts, showing the deeply awful and tragic realities many women face; alone in rotting walls of the city, drowning out the noise, and daring to dream bigger than the spaces they are subjected in.But what makes this movie even more special is that it did not let Sunshine go through it alone. While the movie was an avenue for telling the reality, it also became a source of hope for many women, especially for young ones who will watch it. There will be other women supporting them in their decision, other women who will not judge them for their choices, and other women who will create a safe space for them—at least in ways that they can, in the rotting system we have. Finally, Sunshine does not just urge the system to give women the rights to their own body; it explicitly explains what women go through in the struggles that we speak of. It does not undermine the calls for a systemic change, but it brings you the stories behind why a choice is necessary. It opens you to a narrative that does not just agree to progressive actions, but puts the heart in it. And in between those narratives, the movie reminds us that women are more, that they deserve to take up more space. Women are dreamers, they have ambition, they are complex, cohesive, and compassionate. Women are more than their mistakes, their stories go beyond. And that is the essence of a choice; to let them dream. To free them from the shackles of an already oppressing society. To not dim their light and let them shine, like Sunshine herself.To all the Sunshines out there, you are not alone. Be steadfast on your ambition and dare to dream big. And you take up space even bigger.",2025-07-24,positive,0.9907771348953247,1

Sunshine,"In many known movies, abortion is commonly narrated as a quest with so much comedic acts, plus some forced shallow arguments to inject drama.But for Sunshine — How the movie depicted purchasing a pregnancy test kit in the Philippines = an act to get humiliated. Sunshine, a teenage Filipina athlete forged to be an Olympian who had an unwanted pregnancy, was the sacrificial being for a story to be told.Sunshine happened in the Philippines, where access to reproductive health services is way harder to have compared to other countries, like in the US and Europe. The country has been enclosed with regressive conservatism, causing talks about sex to still be taboos. Abortion is still illegal as well. The movie happened right smack in the heart of Manila City — Quiapo. It is an area known for a well-known Catholic Church and the surrounding kubols or booths of herbal medicines and potions for all uses — from seducing someone, cursing someone, to inducing abortion (or in Filipino, “pampawala ng kapit ng bata.”) The story, its darkness, and some women’s resort to the said harmful options would not have happened if only proper education and healthcare are available, to be honest.Sunshine was very telling of the struggles of Filipinas. But I think it’s globally reflective as well because it told the following things:1.) Unfair treatment on female athletes: Remember Venus Williams’ pregnancy? She almost died after giving birth, and she was kicked out of the top ranks because she cannot play during recovery. The WNBA players? They just wore shirts last All-Star weekend saying “Pay Us What You Owe Us.” And here, Sunshine, an aspiring Olympian, unintentionally risking her passion and potential bread and butter just because proper help is nowhere in sight.2.) Violence against women and children: Catcalling, predatory stares, and rape were parts of this movie. The movie did as much as it could to raise awareness that these actions are still apparent and are unfortunate enablers of all things that went downhill for the female characters. Sunshine mirrored reality, especially for us, Filipinas. I hate writing that sentence, but, it’s the truth. ————————Technical items I liked:• Rico Blanco’s Challengers-esque film score! The music was so immersive. • Rhetorical characters (which are pretty difficult to execute and usually come out as trying-hard, but they weren’t)• Piolo Pascual and his presence. The audience just gasped as soon as he entered the frame!• Most of all — Maris Racal. Her future is so bright. Pain, so much pain, was expressed by her character. And she did more than enough that the audience would want to stop whatever’s causing her agony.• Gusto Ko Sakin Ka Lang is a banger in a tugstugs jeep ↕If you’re in the Philippines, watch this in any SM Cinema. If you’re outside the Philippines, watch out for more future film festivals. Sunshine has been shown in the Toronto International Film Festival, Berlin International Film Festival, Palm Springs International Film Festival, and many more.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9529175758361816,1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is more than a film about a teenage gymnast reaching for her olympic dreams. it reflects the struggles, hopes, and quiet battles of countless young girls trying to find light in a world that often dims their shine. Sunshine isn’t just an athlete wearing an asian games shirt holding a pink crane—she is a woman, a sister, a student, a friend, and someone younger girls look up to. set in the noisy, smoggy, and congested streets of Manila, the film doesn’t shy away from the uncomfortable realities many Filipino girls face: teenage pregnancy, poverty, lack of access to healthcare and education, judgment from professionals, and the systemic neglect of women’s rights. it's not just Sunshine's story—it’s the story of so many young women who are silenced, dismissed, and left to figure things out on their own. Antoinette Jadaone once again directed a story that is not meant to be questioned, but understood. it's in movies like this that we uncomfortably see how and why women resort to abortion-simply because they are forced by circumstances. pregnant teens do not need to be told how reckless they were; they already know it, and they're already bearing the consequences of their actions. what they actually need is someone they can seek help from, someone who can give them the support they need.lest we forget it's the government that continuously denies women their right to a safe society free from the shackles of abuse and neglect.Maris Racal, you are one hell of an artist—and seeing you and Jennica Garcia in an Antoinette Jadaone film was something i didn't know i needed.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9810070395469666,1

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine starts strong and hits hard. Maris Racal kills it (debatable lol) as a gymnast chasing the Olympics, only to find out she’s knocked up. Next thing you know, she’s in Quiapo buying abortion pills tucked between Santo Niño statues. Literal na religious trauma meets reproductive rights. Sunshine’s haunted—literally—by a bata na obvious namang it’s her unborn child or either manifestation ng internalized Catholic guilt. But damn, it works.

Sunshine,"SUNSHINE: THE REVOLUTION!Lost for words after watching tbh, like fr!!Usa sa ni tatak jud nako ani na film kay ang thought na I HAVE NEVER, AS IN NEVER SEEN MS. MERYLL SORIANO THIS RAW, LOUD AND CLEAR EVEN WITH NO-ACTING ACTING STYLE WITH POIGNANT ROLE AS SEEN IN THIS MOVIE. Grabeee, kuhang kuha kaayo niya ang no-acting acting na pinakagusto nako with independent films. If wala lang jud ko kaila niya, i could say na siya gyud ang trainer ni Sunshine like ana siya kamaayo na wala nako nakita iyaang pagka Mama Meme or any other characters she portrayed but THE COACH OF SUNSHINE. Hands up Ms. Meryll! Inay Maria must be proud of you! I hope you'll bag an acting award on this film, you deserve it!Second, gets man na nakafocus pud ang ending sa role ni Ms. Jennica Garcia cause siya nga lang naman nagtiwala at nakakaintindi kay Sunshine, but I would have love to see the change of tone on Ms. Meryll Soriano's character (kulang po yung exposure emz) — she has been one of the dynamic characters in this film and I want to see her sa ending more, now that Sunshine has done what she really loves to do, and parte rin naman siya ng success ni Sunshine. She, in the first place, confronted Sunshine about the ""rumors"" but in the end, in her quiet strength, sinuportahan man pud niya.Third, TAYO ANG CHARACTER NI ANNIKA CO. Ang character ni Annika Co reminds me of the character ni Joven sa Goyo: Batang Heneral. Annika Co doesn't just represent ""Sunshine's child"", she represents how Pinoy see and interpret in their own narratives ang mga personal decisions ni Sunshine. Kumbaga ing-ana ang most judgments sa mga tawo sa mga personal decisions ni Sunshine. She was taken lightly kay ang character naglalaro thru a child actor pero katong part sa falling action na ni ana si Annika ug ""ngayon gets ko na..."" with full of love and a hint of conviction. That's the cue, mao na ang gusto ni Sunshine mahitabo sa nation na magets siya na women should always have the right with their bodies, and what to do with their bodies. I was ugly crying sa whole falling action-resolution because of that freaking satisfaction makita sa nawong ni Sunshine while gracefully performing sa iyaang practice. Ing-ana ang gusto nato makita sa mga babaye if they choose themselves and could become as selfish as these men or even more. Basta gahilak rako ani na part kay heartfelt kaayo ang whole scene with Annika plus giatay dalang dala kaayo ko sa musical scoring ani na scene even without dialogues, just pure execution.Andami ko pang gustong sabihin, but mao ra sa ni ang nitatak sa ako while watching.This is not just a reflection of what's happening sa mga kababaihan, cause this is also a call for action na kailangan na mulihok ang mga lawmakers na ma-Decriminalize ang Abortion sa Pinas to give chance to all women who are not ready to become mothers kasi may mga pangarap pa na mas dapat unahin. Let women be selfish for once. Hindi lahat pwede maging ina; hindi lahat gustong maging isang ina.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9820685982704163,33

Sunshine,"Jennica Garcia, best supporting actress! Grabe. Iyaq na naman si ako, naalala ko na naman iyong “Sunshiiine” nya. Grabe. Andame kong thoughts sa movie! I can’t! Direk Tonet, kung nababasa mo to, yis galeng tai nah!!!! Woooooooh!!!!!!ADDENDUM CHAR (i just can’t stop thinking about this movie after like a week) Sunshine is a story of hope entangled in reality’s shadow.I’ve seen this film before—many times. As a student, learning the theoretical aspects of medicine. As an intern, having actual encounters through interviews with women like Sunshine. And as a practicing physician, who trained to become an OB-GYN, completing many incomplete miscarriages—induced or not—removing what’s left of what we call products of conception. Sometimes people call it products of misconception when they’re trying to be funny.This movie didn’t just slap us with the sensitive issue of abortion. It dissected so many layers of issues we need to talk about more often—and pondering them in reality is a mental and moral gymnastics at play.I would love to discuss all of them one by one, but this is a movie review after all, not an essay on the dangers of lacking a solid law to protect our young women from the societal pressures of patriarchy and religion—pressures that push them into life-threatening situations, only to be blamed for doing something they had no real choice about. In short, fuck the system.It’s always been a mental gymnastics for me to decide how to approach situations like this. And this movie is telling me exactly how. Jennica Garcia’s character deeply resonated with me—from the way she calls Sunshine’s name so tenderly, to the way she assures her that she’ll be there no matter what. She reminds us that we all need at least one ate around us who looks after us despite everything. (She literally said, shouted even, BE KIND!)Another character who lingered in my mind was the 14-year-old teenage mother. Shoutout to the team for dressing her in something colorful—a subtle clue to her identity, only revealed later. She was one small character representing thousands of teenage mothers, who are becoming younger as the years go by. She also represented the vulnerable group prone to sexual abuse—the group we have somehow failed to protect.I’d love to dissect each of the characters, but I’ll leave that to you. Instead, I’ll talk about Sunshine (last na, promise). Maris Racal’s portrayal was a masterclass in character acting. Sunshine is a fearless dreamer, full of dedication and passion to make that dream come true. She perseveres despite her family’s circumstances. She’s also a believer, kind, and someone who truly cares. You see it in the small things—like the way she makes the sign of the cross before her performance, or when she prays fervently in Quiapo Church to ask for guidance or forgiveness on the thing she’s about to do or not to do. And that’s the beauty of this film—it tells you so many things without saying so much. It urges its viewers to talk about them because these are urgent matters. Maybe we’re still far from legalizing abortion, but this movie isn’t just about that. It’s telling us we have so many other issues to tackle.In short, we need to protect the Sunshines—or this world will become darker than it already is.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9855556488037109,-1

Sunshine,"I’m fairly easy to please when it comes to films. Give me a solid plot, a bit of laughter, a love story I can root for, and a strong ensemble, and I’m happy. Sunshine delivers all of these, but more importantly, it delivers a quiet, aching kind of truth. The trailer already sets up the premise: an aspiring Olympic gymnast finds herself two months away from the qualifiers, and pregnant. What unfolds is not a cautionary tale, but a necessary, grounded story about the private cost of dreams and the impossible decisions women are often forced to make.This is not a conventional film. At several moments, I found myself crying with Sunshine—because I know there are many women like her. Women who have been in the same position, or still are. In a country where laws continue to deny women the right to make choices about their own bodies, Sunshine handles its subject matter with a kind of restraint and realism that does not demand pity, but insists on empathy. Even if you haven’t experienced what she has, you feel it—because you are human, and perhaps more deeply, because you are a woman. When the credits rolled, it took a while before anyone in the cinema, including myself to get up and leave. There was a heaviness in the room. Everyone sat in silence, letting the weight of the film settle in.Some have described the film as Brocka-esque, and I find that comparison apt. This is Tonette Jadaone’s most powerful work to date. A film that is necessary, timely, and deserving of all our support. I hope more people watch Sunshine and understand this side of womanhood, one that is constantly sidelined in the name of morality and ethics. There is truth, and power, in giving women the right to choose. In letting them take ownership of their own bodies. Always.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9830551147460938,1

Maris shined, but Jennica Garcia’s performance as the firm yet nurturing older sister really stuck with me. Lastly, this movie brought to light just how much we need progressive reproductive health policies in the country, and just how much we have to fight for it.

Maris Racal delivers her best performance yet, as there’s a stillness to it that makes it all the more heartbreaking.What I really loved is how it doesn’t feel like it’s trying to explain itself and it just presents the reality where religion, poverty, and patriarchy intersect in deeply personal ways. It’s a whole world closing in on a girl who’s just trying to breathe, fighting for her freedom to choose and a right to dream.Seen at SM City Dasmariñas",2025-07-26,positive,0.9816508293151855,1

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine listens. It listens to the silence of shame, the dissonance of faith, and the quiet, aching resolve of a girl who simply wants to choose. It’s the kind of film that our deeply Catholic country isn’t ready for, but desperately needs. That it’s showing in nationwide cinemas—not just tucked in the corners of a progressive film festival—feels like a small act of rebellion in itself.Like Eliza Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, a film I often return to when thinking about stories of quiet resistance, Sunshine unfolds with restraint and tenderness, never sensationalizing what is already unbearable. But where Hittman’s film relies on cold urban detachment, Jadaone’s world breathes with a Filipino kind of chaos: loud horns, dim chapels, vendors selling herbal “solutions” beside icons of the Virgin Mary. It’s all there. The hypocrisy, the hush-hush remedies, the weight of sin pressed upon young women’s shoulders before they even understand the language of their own bodies.Maris Racal is astonishing. She carries the film with a performance so grounded, so lived-in, that she often feels less like a character and more like someone we know. A friend. A cousin. A girl on the jeep beside us, clutching a bag, hiding her fear behind a tight grip and a brave face. Her Sunshine is not loud, but she is brave. And perhaps bravery today looks exactly like this: choosing to take control of your life, even when the world tries to stop you.Jadaone’s direction is both intimate and distant, borrowing from the gaze of Brocka but infused with a distinctly feminine grief. We see Sunshine from behind glass, from across alleys, as if we too are complicit in watching but not speaking up. Yet the film never loses its tenderness, even in its political anger.Sunshine is not an easy watch. But it is essential. In a country where reproductive rights are still cloaked in rosaries and stigma, this film asks us not just to look, but to sit, to stay, to listen. It doesn’t beg for permission. It asserts presence. And sometimes, in a nation deafened by doctrine, that’s more than enough.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9821745157241821,1

Sunshine,"i’ve already seen so many pro-choice films that greatly explore the difficulties of going through an abortion (never rarely something always, happening, etc) but i must say that it feels really different to watch a film like it made in your country.. because in the pro-choice films i’ve watched before, they’re usually either set in the old times where abortion was still illegal in their countries or set in a modern setting whereas the female lead needs to travel in other places/states to undergo abortion legally… but in sunshine, it’s set in the modern times or the living conditions of filipino people right now yet there’s still no place to go where abortion is accepted… which speaks a lot about the real life situation for women in our country. women anywhere have to go through a lot to apply *the choice* that they’ve decided on.. however, it is much much worse in the philippines as it’s a complete taboo and sometimes it feels like we’ll never see in our lifetime where abortion will finally be legal in the country…… so, it truly is a remarkable feat that we got a pro-choice filipino film now. not only that because it’s directed by one of the most well-known directors, released nationwide, and promoted in mainstream shows and platforms. this film shedded some light to everyone and it was very much needed for every filipino woman out there.thank you direk antoinette, maris racal, and all the amazing women here for sharing the story of sunshine.

Sunshine,"This film is, at its core, a well-intentioned and emotionally resonant film. It tackles difficult subject matter with sincerity, and for the most part, it does so with grace. However, I found that the inclusion of fantastical or imaginary elements occasionally detracted from the weight of its core issues. While I understand the metaphorical ambition behind these stylistic choices as well as their function in softening the emotional blows with humor or levity, I believe the film is at its most powerful when it forgoes embellishment and leans fully into the raw intensity of its subject matter. In those moments, when it embraces the chaos, the pain, and the emotional urgency it really becomes something far more affecting and memorable, allowing the simplicity it strives for to emerge, though it’s often overshadowed. At times, the dialogue veers into overtly inspirational or didactic terrain, feeling more like affirmations meant to uplift than naturalistic exchanges between characters. It’s clear that the film doesn’t only aim to tell a story, it wants to educate, to empower, to stir social consciousness. Yet in doing so, it sometimes edges closer to the tone of an educational TV movie than a fully realized work of cinema. That’s not a critique of its moral imperative, it’s a film that should be shown in schools but rather an observation about its limitations as a piece of narrative storytelling. The emotional and ideological weight it seeks to carry isn’t always supported by the nuance or complexity that cinematic storytelling demands.What grounds the film and gives it its most enduring power is its emotional core. Maris Racal delivers a performance of quiet strength and vulnerability, anchoring the film with remarkable consistency. Especially compelling is the subplot involving Rhed Bustamante’s character. Without revealing too much, her arc resonated with me more deeply than the central storyline. It was heartbreakingly authentic, subtle, restrained, and profoundly human. In that thread, the film touches something honest and unflinching.I also admired Antoinette Jadaone’s formal restraint in certain key scenes, particularly her choice to mute the sound. In a film so concerned with voice and expression, those pockets of silence carried tremendous weight. They allowed the viewer a moment of stillness, a space for reflection and imbued the film with a haunting quietude that deepened the emotional stakes.That said, the film’s message doesn’t always land with clarity. After a pivotal hospital scene, I overheard two audience members blame the protagonist for her choices, siding with the doctor who confronts her. That reaction, while anecdotal, reveals a significant shortcoming: the narrative may not have sufficiently challenged ingrained prejudices or prompted the kind of empathy it aspired to cultivate. It bravely addresses urgent topics- reproductive rights, bodily autonomy, the realities of being a young woman navigating unjust systems but the film doesn’t always sharpen these into a coherent or persuasive argument. In trying to reach everyone, it occasionally loses the sharpness needed to truly confront.Still, “Sunshine” is a valuable film, one with earnestness, compassion, and purpose. Its flaws are born of ambition: the desire to inspire, to uplift, and to inform all at once. But perhaps empowerment doesn’t always need to be accompanied by joy. Sometimes, it is in the unvarnished confrontation of pain without fantasy, without consolation that we discover our deepest strength. I don’t mean to suggest the film ought to have ended in despair, but rather that its final act, which shifts into metaphor and closes with a success story, might have benefitted from something more grounded, more unresolved or ambiguous . Real life rarely provides a clean arc, and in a film so rooted in truth, the ending felt almost too easy, too neat.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9708266258239746,0

Sunshine,"A random review ***it may contain spoilers*** I was in awe after seeing the first 10mins or more of this film. How perfectly shot, how each Sunshine’s flow, movement and forms were perfectly calculated in graceful manner, it may translate to her goals as a national athlete. I like the raw and realistic on the situation where she had an idea if she might be pregnant, from the varsity clinic, how she react, getting a pregnancy kit to a local pharmacy, how she search online on how to get rid or literally “mawala sa sarili” in the moment she found out, i may say if i were in that age I probably be acting the same thing Sunshine did.It very direct, light and eye opening to different perspectives in abortion, from the pro life views, to views of men who is not ready fathered or accept responsibilities, to the views of her friends and colleagues/societal norms, in the perspectives of her coach and to her lifelong dream, to the views of some unwanted pregnant women who dealt from complicated situations, to view of her own family, for Sunshine and to her unborn child. We all have out own biases when it comes to this topic; abortion but at the end it still in the capacity of the woman, the beholder to take choice on what choices she want to take… I was too happy how her family especially her eldest sister Geleen support Sunshine in what decision she may lead to. Its a gemIn silver screen seeing that moment, that scene that is so comforting, q moment that most of us longing in a situation like this. It’s not about taking responsibilities but owning and accepting mistakes and making peace to yourself. We know what is good and what's right but in the end of the day we are the not the right one to decide for someone else fate and choices especially we are not in that situation, where they are coming from.I want to commend Maris Racal for casting as Sunshine. I can’t think anyone else to portray for the role of Sunshine. Flawless acting, she really Sunshine. Also Jennica Garcia too and Meryl Soriano, superb performance. *i love the Aryanna scene. Speaks reality!*the scene with Angeli Bayani /Dr. Helena. After Mary Grace rushed to the hospital and Dr. Helena offer her service after a male doctor rejected Mary grace and Sunshine, only women understands women… period say it all.

Sunshine,"yung number 1 reason kung bakit nagustuhan ko ang sunshine ay dahil si sunshine ang bida. that was a conscious and bold choice for the film. kasi ang mindset ng mga tao, okay lang ang abortion kapag nabuntis ang babae dahil sa rape.pero malinaw ang gustong ipa-realize satin ng pelikula, na si menggay ka man o si sunshine, na-rape ka man o hindi, may option at access ka dapat sa safe abortion. kwento ito ng maraming kababaihan sa bansa, ang iba’y mga ina tulad ni susan (The Barber’s Tales).dapat i-decriminalize ang abortion sa pilipinas and discussions about it must be more about the social reality than morality. naalala ko ang statement noon ng gabriela women’s party:“Whether we see abortion as a moral decision or not, we cannot turn a blind eye to the reality that poor women resort to unsafe abortion as they do not have the resources to raise a child amid the economic crisis, aside from the alarming cases of pregnancies arising from rape.”",2025-07-26,positive,0.5374411344528198,-1

I’m so sorry pero hindi ko mapigilan i-compare si maris kay angelica panganiban. equally talented. it was uphill for angelica after santa santita, and this is maris’ santa santita. an actress na kayang-kaya tumawid between mainstream and profound roles. at sobrang powerful ‘nun kasi konting-konti lang ang nakakagawa ‘nun na kinakagat ng mga tao. husay din nung chuwariwap sunshine. si annika, meryll soriano, and lalong-lalo na si jennica garcia. sa konting eksena nya, para bang binigay nya yung buong pagkatao nya? kung papanoorin nyo palang, abangan nyo yung scenes ni jennica. pag hindi kayo napukaw, kakain ako ng tae!tell me something about mothering without being a mother ang atake ni tonet at sunshine. gets na gets ko ang mensahe na gustong iparating kahit wala akong uterus. at yung pagpapadala ng mensahe, sing-graceful ng rhythmic gymnastics ni sunshine.who was she talking to? her younger self? her dream? her baby? or her conscience? kanya-kanyang interpreration nalang, pero dun ako sa latter. yung tipong, ito yung societal standards na kinalakihan mo, to the point na naging konsensya mo. ang konsensya ba, napapalaglag? that is the question.nung 2020 after ko mapanood ang fangirl, nasabi ko talaga na this is the new age of tonet jadaone. after sunshine, indeed totoo nga. ganda rin talaga ng mga bond nya sa actresses nya for them to spill this hard.this film is not glorifying abortion; it glorifies the women’s choices, because their body, their choice. pinakita ang struggle, the weighing in, and most importantly, the strength on making a firm stand for yourself.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9680581092834473,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is a film that proves time and time again that art matters. This is unrelated to the film but Ethan Hawke best explains it when he said that human art is a sustenance that lets us make sense of the things that we have no understanding of. And Sunshine exceeds in that very criteria because of how delicate the plot is yet it puts so much faith on its viewers by challenging them into understanding the struggles explored in the film, and it cleverly succeeds in such a way that does not make it intrusive. The viewer is allowed to draw their own opinions without the film ever forcing them to side with it. Sunshine is Antoinette Jadaone's magnum opus, and the film further shines as Maris Racal delivers a performance of a lifetime. I cannot stress enough how important this film is to the Philippines, and how it is a step forward to everything it stands for. Manila is unforgiving, relentless, and dark, but even the streets can feel like home with even just a little light.",2025-07-24,positive,0.9946152567863464,1

Sunshine,"Gets na gets ko na.To be honest, Sunshine may follow the story of a gymnast, but it's really about the quiet, impossible contortions many women are forced to make just to keep going—physically, emotionally, morally. It’s about the weight of carrying something you didn’t choose, in a world that offers you no real way out.It asks the kind of questions that linger long after the credits roll: How do you hold on to your dreams when your body no longer feels like your own? How do you choose anything at all when every choice comes with shame, fear, or punishment?In a country where abortion is completely outlawed—even in cases of rape or danger to the mother—and where women are taught to suffer silently for the sake of appearances or faith, Sunshine hits differently. It doesn't shout. It doesn't try to shock. It simply tells the truth as it is lived: with quiet pain, with small acts of defiance, and with the kind of strength that often goes unnoticed.This film doesn’t just resist—it listens, it aches, and above all, it stays with you.July 26, 2025SM Mall of Asia",2025-07-26,positive,0.9111640453338623,1

Sobrang ganda.I'm not sure if I am right, but among Direk Tonet's heroines, Sunshine seems to have the least lines.Pero kahit 'yun ang kaso, her story is clear without her having to say much. Maris's acting brought Sunshine to life, in moments when she calms herself and says ""Tiwala lang."" In moments na napapamura siya sa galit. But most especially in moments na mag-isa lang siya at tahimik (that motel scene ). Some people say that it is a happy ending. Nakakatuwa naman talagang nakarating si Sunshine sa SEA Games.

Sunshine,"To hell with these topics being taboo in the Philippines - Jadaone says LET’S TALK ABOUT IT and this film did that. Definitely a film that will start conversations and something that will linger in thought even hours after watching it.This film - for starters, was really well-shot and well-edited. That was my first takeaway. Second, well-scored. And when that credits rolled and I saw that Rico Blanco did it? The dots were connecting and with Maris Racal as the protagonist? Wow that was definitely personal maybe that’s why it was done so good.As a man, who actually didn’t know anything about this topic - THIS WAS EYE-OPENING EDUCATIONAL FOR ME. I didn’t know how self-abortion works, I didn’t know how much it cost, I didn’t know what it looks like, I didn’t know how treatment is done after, I didn’t even know that doctors refused service for this! Imagine my fuming anger when that scene happened. For me, this was information overload.I appreciate how this was not Maris Racal anymore. This was Sunshine. Sunshine was a real person. It borderline made me forget that this was a film, it felt like reenactment of something, or maybe unintentionally, it was.Also, scriptwriting and editing masterclass - How you make people laugh with subtle punchlines with great timing, but not cutting off the momentum and emotion you feel for the scene, and also not lightening off the topic at hand. The way that that were balanced? Hats off to Jadaone and the editor, Ben Tolentino (THE GOAT)Performances were topnotch as well! I love that you feel the cast, from lead to support, not one-upping each other. You felt them read the script and read the room and operate on that energy. They were supporting each others’ performances and maybe that’s why it became more effective as a script. The execution was phenomenal.Personally, I would have loved some bit more fleshing out by the third act, because I feel like the un-accustomed or laymen movie audience may not get it immediately with the execution of it and it would’ve been better with the topic at hand to be spoonfed a bit more (but not too much). But yeah this is more of a personal nitpick at this point.Either way - BEAUTIFUL FILM! Is this my favorite Jadaone? I’m not sure yet. But is this objectively the best Maris Racal?

But life throws her a twist: an unexpected pregnancy. Suddenly, her body—once her source of power—feels like it no longer belongs to her. She’s scared, tired, and unsure what choice feels right.The setting isn’t just Manila—it’s its soul. Busy, sacred, messy. In one scene, she’s buying abortion pills from a street stall, while church bells ring nearby. The contrast is sharp, but real. Sunshine doesn’t tell you what’s right or wrong. It just shows you what’s true.What stayed with me most is how the film feels personal. Like every time I’ve had to choose myself, even when others didn’t understand. It reminded me that courage isn’t loud—it’s the quiet strength to keep going.If you’ve ever felt like you were drowning in expectations, Sunshine reminds you that even in the darkest alleys, there’s a sliver of light.

Sunshine,"Yesterday, I stumbled upon a Twitter post pointing out parallelisms between Jadaone's Sunshine and Brocka's Insiang with how both films' main characters, in at least one scene, were framed behind bars, mirroring their metaphorical imprisonment within gendered norms of their respective social milieus. Indeed, although almost 50 years have passed between the two films, it's an unfortunate reality that women's rights in the Philippines still have a long way to go, with conservative Catholic values hindering its advancement. Both Jadaone and Brocka present us with their titular characters' fractured psyches, trying everything within their limited power to achieve some kind of self-emancipation. Another Twitter post, however, posits that while Jadaone echoes Brocka in some ways, she ultimately diverges from him by virtue of her ""woman's instinct"" that also augments her narratives with an ""added layer."" Obvious gender essentialism and identity politics aside, this is a sentiment that I'm keen on interrogating: what does it actually mean to have a female directorial sensibility, particularly in the vein of Antoinette Jadaone?An easy answer would be to look at the central conflict of Sunshine, that is, unwanted pregnancy, and that Jadaone opts for a female teenager as its main focalizer. I'm pointing this out because trans men and intersex people can also get pregnant hence a pregnancy plot point would not inherently be women-specific (although there would surely be many overlaps), so it's Jadaone's directorial decision to create a female protagonist that imbues the film with intricacies of the female experience---how proceeding with motherhood would be career suicide for an athlete aiming for the Olympics, how Sunshine is constantly berated by self-righteous people she encounters, how society itself was built against female self-determination, and despite all these, how Sunshine finds small pockets of refuge in other women---a friend, a mentor, an inn receptionist, a doctor, an abused prepubescent, a sister---who are empathetic enough to understand her pain and conviction, and to whom she's equally compelled to reciprocate kindness whenever the situation permits.Further, Jadaone digs deeper and finds the Catholic religious institution, itself a remnant of feudalism, as an underlying hegemonic force against women empowerment, so culturally embedded in Philippine society that Sunshine finds it wherever she goes, be it in the drugstore, in the hospital, in the university, in the sport that she loves, even in the man who got her pregnant. Unfortunately, here is also where Jadaone's supposed female sensibility loses steam: religious guilt is so ubiquitous that even she is not aware that it limits her perspective, that instead of finding multiple angles of inquiry she instead chooses to hammer in the same anti-religious (therefore anti-patriarchal) talking point over and over and over again, even to the point of physicalizing the unborn children, a weirdly pro-life creative decision in a film that self-categorizes as pro-choice. Heck, the film just assumes that the audience already knows about the economic facets of being a Filipino athlete so it makes no effort in examining it, nor is it concerned with how Sunshine and her family earn their money (nobody seems to be working!). No, those aren't important; just focus on the fact that Sunshine is a woman and that she's oppressed because of it. ""Drown out the noise,"" her coach tells her, but is it really necessary to drown it out if the noise is as repetitively monotonous (albeit still imminently threatening) as Jadaone presented it?My argument is that uncritical admiration for ""female sensibility"" is as dangerous as the patriarchy it contends with, and that it's the same liberal narrow-sightedness that applauds Jadaone's bravery for tackling taboo gender topics and turns a blind eye to her cowardice in heeding the pro-Palestine boycott of the Berlinale film festival in the same breath; what's the point of female sensibility if it is devoid of anti-fascist solidarity? Perhaps Sunshine is actually a self-surrogate for the lengths Jadaone is willing to go through in pursuit of her career, and we're all just supposed to root for her because it's great that Philippine cinema is acknowledged and praised internationally, everything else be damned.And maybe I'm expecting too much from Jadaone, that I should just accept that her films are self-contained texts that will never reach the same kind of radicalism and depth as Brocka's (which is admittedly a high standard to reach), but deep inside I want to believe that she's capable of bolder, stronger filmic statements.",2025-07-26,positive,0.8999626636505127,1

Sunshine,"Ganito pala sa Maynila—maingay, mausok, at puno ng pangarap. Sunshine holds up a mirror to Manila's contradictions. There is a sketchy motel that asks for your ID before handing over the keys, as if the system needs to know if you are old enough to make your own decisions. A crowded hospital where pregnant women share beds in the maternity ward, almost as if they are only given a small space in a world they live in. A religious landmark for those seeking miracles, but just outside are street markets selling religious paraphernalia and illegal abortion pills.Maris Racal gives an outstanding performance as Sunshine, a young rhythmic gymnast whose Olympic aspirations are upended by unexpected pregnancy during tryouts. One of the film's striking choices is the inclusion of this magical presence played by Annika Co. To me this character felt like a reflection of the conservative audience inserted into the narrative, a constant presence, watching, whispering, and trying to make sense of Sunshine's decisions.The film closes with the hope that Sunshine, and others like her, might still get the chance to finish their routine and maybe, even become champions of their own lives.",2025-07-24,positive,0.810518205165863,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is a charming film. Beautifully directed, well-acted, and elevated by a great score and gorgeous cinematography (ang ganda ng Maynila kahit gritty). The pacing is tight and purposeful (walang fillers, or at least I didn't feel it), and honestly, I loved every minute of it. It’s the best Filipino film I’ve seen this year.What stood out most was how it tackled the lack of body autonomy that women face in this country. We reaaaalllyyy need a legal avenue for abortion, and I hope this film helps spark that conversation. Ang hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas!I also liked that it showcased the real Manila without falling into poverty porn (great shots of Quiapo). It celebrated female friendships and relationships without centering men, and it showed the complexities of family without resorting to toxic tropes(supportive ate yes! Jennica Garcia was amaaaazing). I loved the inclusion of sports too; we definitely need more athlete-centered films.Pero, at the heart of it all is a strong, well-developed main character — flawed, impulsive, but deeply likeable and easy to root for (even during her chaotic, violent outbursts!!! I loved those moments, geh girl go lang!!!).Maris Racal was phenomenal. She captured Sunshine’s stress and anxiety with so much nuance — it never felt overacted. Grabe, I really felt her frustration, and by the end, I felt her relief too.I don’t usually write movie reviews, but this film was so phenomenaaaaal I couldn’t help but put my thoughts into words. Ayan tuloy, nakapagsulat ako ng ilang paragraphs! I really hope it gets the support it deserves and that more people catch it in cinemas before Tuesday so that it gets extended and marinig ni Direk yung now on it's 3rd week — ganern!Thank you, Papa God para sa movie na to!!!",2025-07-26,positive,0.996860146522522,1

Sunshine,"Usually, when a film claims to challenge a societal norm, it ends up being either too preachy or barely scratching the surface. But sometimes, a film like Sunshine comes along and delivers on its promise—clear, direct, and most importantly, brave.Not only is this Jadaone’s best film to date, but it’s also her most important. It’s a feminist masterclass in storytelling, evident in how every significant character in the film that supports Sunshine is a woman. And to top it all off, the ending was written to give the character what she truly deserves—even if the harsh realities of our country don't always allow a woman to have that.Even the casting was perfect and clearly intentional—from Maris’s embodiment of Sunshine to Elijah’s portrayal of the privileged Miggy (perfect choice of name, by the way). Setting the story against the raw backdrop of Manila adds just the right weight to the film’s intention.Minsan lang dumating ang isang pelikulang pwedeng magbukas ng mata ng mas marami pang tao. Sana dumating ang araw na hindi na mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas. Sana maintindihan ng kung sino man ang nasa taas. Sana masabi nilang, “Gets ko na.""",2025-07-26,positive,0.8923219442367554,1

No problem, sa sunod na shot with the car, intentionally mag-ga-glide ang shot sa harap at makikitang napalitan na ang windshield at wala nang confrontation about it. It is just fixed.Kailangan ni Sunshine ng pera para magpalaglag ng bata? Walang intro-intro, dumukot sa bulsa si Miggy, binigyan nya si Sunshine ng 5k. 5000 pesos!Nalaman ng tatay ni Miggy na nakabuntis sya? Edi sige, sasagutin nila lahat ng hospital bills nya. Susustentuhan nila ang magiging bata until mag-18 ito. Pag-aaralin nila sa Ateneo, La Salle, you name it.Money is not an issue for them.The runners up are:2.

Sunshine,"Sunshine (Maris Racal) is a record-breaking national athlete, but the film fails to show the weight of that achievement.She wears a tank top marked “Asian Games 2018,” and her coach (Meryll Soriano) warns her against complacency: “Balewala lahat ng gold mo sa Asian Games.”Since the Asian Games are held every four years, and Sunshine is about 19 or 20, this suggests she won multiple golds in 2018 — a rare feat. She would be gymnastics royalty, a media darling, likely the most successful Filipina rhythmic gymnast in history.Yet the film doesn’t show her as a public figure. No news clippings, no media buzz, no crowds—just a few kids asking for a selfie. It also focuses mostly on her ribbon routine, barely showing the hoop, ball, or clubs—all key to establishing her as Olympic-level.Sunshine’s decision to abort is quick, and her fears and ambitions are underexplored. The Olympics, in fact, feel more like her coach’s dream—the film tells us this but doesn’t show it.There’s no pressure from a country rooting for her, nor from sponsors who presumably funded her expensive training (which we’re left to assume, since rhythmic gymnastics is an elite sport). No rival gymnast, no sense of competition, no major stakes, and no real glimpse into the demanding world of elite sport.All this undercuts the tension around her unwanted pregnancy.Jadaone instead spends a chunk of screen time on soapy magical realism. An imaginary, foul-mouthed child follows Sunshine around, mocking her decisions. But instead of adding insight, this character becomes repetitive and irritating.Rhed Bustamante plays another pregnant teen, awkwardly inserted into the plot in an effort to cover too many sides of the abortion debate. But Rhed’s more serious situation makes Sunshine’s dilemma feel shallow—like a story about a girl careless with sex and unwilling to face the consequences.Some visuals in Sunshine hit hard: abortifacients sold beside religious icons outside Quiapo Church—a jab at how the Catholic Church, in practice, is more ritual than moral compass. There’s also a grim motel scene. But these moments can’t save the film.Set in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, where abortion is illegal, Sunshine tries to raise issues around teen pregnancy and reproductive rights, like overcrowded maternity wards. True enough, the Philippines has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Southeast Asia, especially among the poor.But if a film brings this up, it must give some context. The Reproductive Health Law, passed only in 2012, was meant to help—but the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) continues to fight tooth and nail against sex education and birth control.The film ignores all this. Instead, it gives us a cartoonish, Bible-thumping doctor and a patriarchal pastor—villains standing in for real problems. We don’t expect to be spoon-fed, but when a film enters controversial ground and hints at bigger issues, it has a duty to avoid shallow symbols.In the end, Sunshine parrots Western slogans like “My body, my choice” without anchoring its stance in the Philippine context. The message feels imported and emotionally flat.READ FULL REVIEW (DAILY TRIBUNE): https://tribune.net.ph/2025/07/26/sunshine-review-abortion-tale-misses-the-mark",2025-07-27,positive,0.7121022939682007,1

Masikip sa bahay kung saan nakikita mo kung paano natapos ang pangarap ng ate niya. Masikip sa paaralan kung saan mag-isa niyang nilalabanan ang mga mapangmatang titig at pandidiri.

Sunshine,"Layunin ng Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) na magkaroon ng kamalayan ang kabataan sa mga isyu ng seksuwalidad lalo pa na nasa yugto sila na tinutuklas ito. Sa kabilang banda, kontrobersiyal ito sa ating bansang Katolisismo ang pinakalaganap na relihiyon. Gayundin ang usapin ng aborsiyon. Sa panulat at direksiyon ni Antoinette Jadaone, isa itong pelikulang sports drama na umiikot kay Sunshine (Maris Racal) na kailangan magpasiya kung ipagpapatuloy o hindi ang pagbubuntis habang papalapit ang kaniyang paglahok sa pambansang paligsahan sa rhythmic gymnastics. Walang tapon sa bawat kuha ng mga eksena, kahit na sa mga background audio nito, sapagkat sumisimbolo ito sa kalagayan ng Pilipina sa ating patriyarkal na lipunan. Nagustuhan ko ang panulat at direksiyon nito dahil sang-ayon sa sinabi ng aking kaibigan, naiparanas nito ang pakiramdam na may isa kang kakilala na kahalintulad ni Sunshine. Bukod dito, naiparamdam nito na kasama ka sa pelikula. Iyong tipong sinubaybayan mo rin ang paglalakbay ni Sunshine sa saanmang sulok ng Maynila. Kaya, makakaugnay at mailalagay mo ang sarili sa kalagayan ng pangunahing tauhan o sa sinuman. Malinis din ang pagkaka-edit ng pelikula sapagkat malinaw sa direktor kung ano ang nais niyang mangyari kay Sunshine. Piling-pili ang mga eksena kaya ang hirap pumili ng pinakamaganda o pinakanagustuhan. Hangang-hanga rin ako disenyong pamproduksyon nito dahil bukod sa ginalugad talaga ang madidilim na espasyo ng Maynila, iniisip ko kung paano sila nakapag-shooting sa ganoong karaming tao. Grabeng blockings niyon. Karapat-dapat talaga na papurihan si Racal sa kaniyang pagganap dito. Tama lamang ang timpla ng iba't ibang emosyon ang ipinamalas niya rito. Ngunit ang pinakanakabibilib sa lahat, magaling din ang mga pantulong na tauhan kaya napalitaw nito ang husay ng pangunahing artista. Ang tinginan nila ni Thea (Xyriel Manabat). Ang coach na tila pangalawang nanay na si Eden (Meryll Soriano). Ang misterysong batang babae (Annika Co). Ang kakampi na si Geleen (Jennica Garcia). Kahit na ang lokong si Miguel (Elijah Canlas). May ambag silang lahat upang mapagtibay ang karakterisasyon ni Sunshine at ang husay ni Racal. Ang ganitong pelikula ang nagbibigay ng dahilan kung bakit mahalaga na mayroong CSE at kung bakit kailangan mapag-usapan at mapag-isipan muli ang legal at siyentipikong pagpapalaglag. Babae man o lalaki, kahit na ang LGBTQIA+, binibigyan tayo nito ng awtoridad sa ating katawan. Sa kabuuan, nagustuhan ko ang ""Fangirl"" (2020) ni Direk Tonet na naglarawan ng estado ng babae sa rehimeng Duterte. Higit pa sa debate ng aborsiyon, napaibig ako sa ""Sunshine"" dahil sa pagpapakita nito ng tunay na ideya ng feminismo - ang pagkakaroon ng kalayaang pumili at ng kakampi.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9789350628852844,2

Sunshine,"Sunshine presents a two-pronged takeoff on putting forth a controversial subject it aims to transfigure into a discourse. It’s gritty yet poignant, a dichotomy facilitated by careful restraint in its direction, intricate cinematography, and Maris Racal’s stellar performance.The film deflects clichés observed in Filipino melodramas that often rely on overly oppressive emotional tropes and techniques. Most notably, it veers away from positioning religion or the Church as a central source of female agency. Instead, it presents it as an androcentric institution where permission for a woman’s reproductive health decisions must be sought, implying a strong assertion of control and dominance over women’s bodies.Set against the backdrop of bustling, grunge-textured Manila, the camera takes a remarkable grasp on the parallelisms and minutiae of everyday life in the cruel city: a crowded train moving across the metro juxtaposed against a dreary room in Avenida; an abortifacient vendor sitting by a display of Mary Magdalene busts she sells in Quiapo; a tight-knit community devoid of love and empathy for a child.The film refuses to paint the gaps and seams of a faulty society in broad strokes. Sunshine is delicately crafted and measured. It deeply delves into the nuances and detailed complexities of living in a Christian society that has, ironically and deliberately, chosen to position women’s rights on the periphery.It taps into female solidarity as a form of agency and collective resistance, offering both an idealistic and pragmatic antithesis to the marginalization they have long been experiencing.Reminiscent of Antoinette Jadaone’s pre-studio works such as Plano (2004) and Saling Pusa (2006), Sunshine feels like a beautiful work of personal musings. It is honest, outrageous, yet tender—marking one of her greatest directorial masterpieces.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9783943295478821,1

Sunshine,"I think it's safe to say by now that Antoinette Jadaone is one of the greats of Philippine Cinema. And not just of now, but of all time. The still-young filmmaker, who cut her teeth on quirky indie comedies ( Six Degrees of Lilya Cuntapay, Beauty in a Bottle) soon became the new queen of Pinoy Romantic Comedies, resulting in an 8-films-in-5-years streak that included classics like That Thing Called Tadhana, Never Not Love You and Alone/Together. Then in 2020, something changed. At the height of the pandemic, Tonet released Fan Girl -- an unflinching, searing commentary on celebrity worship, toxic masculinity and patriarchal oppression in the Philippines. It not only won all the major awards during that year's MMFF, but was also the highest-grossing film for that year. This makes Tonet somewhat of a unicorn: a writer/director who can make socially relevant, intelligent cinema but at the same time kill it at the box office. This feat is especially astounding in a year when zero films have actually made money. And so that six-year streak turned into a five-year absence, and wisely so. Tonet channeled her creative juices towards other roles and mediums: television, streaming, producing. I'm a big believer in taking care of one's filmography, and she's doing just that. And as fans we have finally been rewarded. Hello, Sunshine. Sunshine follows a slew of, and there's no non-blunt way to put it, abortion movies that have come to the fore in the 2020s. You have the US's Never Rarely Sometimes Always and France's L'Événement. All films follow the internal struggle and loneliness that women face when going through the abortion process. Of the three, Sunshine is the most powerful for one simple reason: it's set in the Philippines. And while it hits home because it is home, the oppression, hypocrisy and outright strangeness of the system makes this abortion story unique. It's a country where you can find ads for abortives just buy typing in ""abortion"" in your instagram search terms, where a vendor of Catholic paraphernalia situated outside a church will also peddle Cytotec, where a doctor who saves your life will also give you a 5-minute telling-to once you're well enough to listen. It's a country where self-righteous sanctimonium has endangered millions of young women's lives. Sunshine is pro-choice, but it's also pro-life. It never tries to turn away from the consequences and the trauma women go through when making this decision. And it shows us what could have been, never cheapening the lives that were lost. These layers, the emotional depth with which Tonet imbues Sunshine, are what sets it apart. It's a very thought provoking film, but it aims straight for the heart. I've spent all this time singing Tonet's praises, but of course Sunshine wouldn't be Sunshine without the brilliant Maris Racal. I meant it when I said that Maris is a generational talent: a true actress with genuine love for the craft who just also happens to be incredibly popular. She breathes so much life and attitude into Sunshine that she really feels like a friend. Someone you're rooting for, someone whose pain you understand.It's a very important film, but don't let its importance weigh you down. End of the day, like all of Tonet's films, it's a story well told with characters you genuinely care about. Sunshine is now showing in all SM Malls.

Gets ko na. and i hope so much more people get it ngayon lang din mas naging clear saakin yung meaning ng prochoice. how sunshine chose to Not have it. how firm she was to continue her dreams. how she knows and chose na hindi pa siya handa maging nanay. that's what being prochoice is. and so many people, lalo na teens, who go through such painful procedures and even risking their life kasi they didnt have the choice to have a safe procedure done. ok dami ko na sinasabi basa na kili-kili ko! this is such an important film and sana everyone gets to watch this movie. i hope it becomes more accessible. i hope this doesnt become a weapon for schools to scare teens to not have sex. i hope this becomes the reason why sex education and the concept of being prochoice isnt a taboo topic in the ph anymore OK YUN LANG THANK YOU ANG GALING NI MARIS RACAL SOBRANG HANGA AKO",2025-07-27,positive,0.9896360039710999,8

Sunshine,"This is the sunshine the country needs in today’s climate.It was Jadaone’s courage that popped in my head when the title card flashed, a very Filipina name that connotes brightness and warmth — two things the film was not intended for, two things the titular character was deprived of. Sunshine is a story of every Sunshine, a Filipino woman vulnerable to systemic injustice and oppression; a story no one could have been told better than a Filipino woman herself — and a fearless and intelligent one at that. From reproductive health and general health care system to conservatism, Jadaone’s care and spirit championed. Her personification of one’s conscience was beautifully done. I sobbed through the last 15 minutes.True-to-life darkness in the country executed from the literal streets to the contexts of quality of life through Orendain’s realism. There’s a harrowing frame in the movie that ticked all my boxes as a fan of dark cinematography. I bled in the dark with Sunshine right there.This film boasts a talented bundle of actresses: Meryll Soriano, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, Jennica Garcia, with Maris Racal tying the ribbon, flexing her acting muscles across different tones and needs.

She did it not for anyone else but for herself. Sana mas dumami pa ang makaintindi hindi lang sa naging sitwasyon niya, sa sitwasyon ni Menggay, pero maging sa marami pang kwento ng bawat babae sa mundo.Movie wise, para sa akin, maganda ang pacing. Maayos na naihayag ang kwento ni Sunshine na hindi minadali. Sakto lang para maintindihan pero bibigyan ka pa rin ng karapatan bilang manonood na mag isip.

Sunshine,"“Bakit ka ba takbo nang takbo? Mahirap yan.

Sunshine,"""Sunshine"" is not just the greatest Filipino movie I've seen but one of the most important Filipino films of all-time! This film deals with controversial topics in our society, abortion and teen pregnancy. A week of national tryout for the gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal) finds out that she's pregnant. Conflicts arise as she has to decide what to do next. In between life and dreams, what's the most significant between the two?The film is unconventional at best. This is not your usual and average Filipino drama you'll see. It's a character study about a teenager who is on the down side of her life. We follow her journey through this life and see a glimpse of her life dealing with her problem. Maris Racal defines this film as Sunshine. Her acting here is brilliant. She's perfect for this role. Jennica Garcia surprised me. Her character as Sunshine 's sister marks! What she said to Sunshine near the ending, though it's common, is like a punch to tears! I ended up loving her character. Jennica Garcia deserves an award for being the best supporting actress for this role. Another cast that standout is Rhed Bustamante and Xyriel Manabat both deserve a recognition for their role.Blurring between reality and fantasy, mostly this film is realistic in portraying the whole theme thanks to Direk Antoinette Jadaone directions. Also, the cinematography is the best! Overall, ""Sunshine"" is a women's movie. It's timely, affecting and brave to its theme. It doesn't spoon feed. It will make you immersed and think. It's worth an experience. This is a rare Filipino movie I've seen! I'm glad and proud watching this in cinema. After watching ""Sunshine"", it leaves me with a question, ""Is abortion a choice if your greatest dream will compromise?""",2025-07-27,positive,0.9953338503837585,1

The film successfully captured the nuances of a teenage girl in a college setting. Walang moments na napa-huh? ako because it was so well made (or maybe I’m just used to Filipino films [that i’ve seen] making me huh) Maris was phenomenal. Jennica was outstanding.

Sunshine,"Interesting na rhythmic gymnastics ang sports ni Sunshine (Maris Racal). Hindi ito kilala sa ating bansa pero kitang-kita sa sports na ito na kailangan ng marinading determinasyon at disiplina hindi lamang sa larangan ng sports dito sa Pilipinas pati na rin sa paghahanda sa paglaban sa Olympics. Kaya naman ng mabuntis si Sunshine ay naharap siya sa isang desisyong babago sa kanyang buhay at sa mga tao sa paligid niya. Ilan sa mga isyu na nilatag ng pelikula ay ang kakulangan ng sex education at accessibility ng legal abortion sa Pilipinas dahil na rin sa konserbatibong paniniwala. Idagdag pa ang kulang na suporta ng gobyerno pagdating sa ating atleta tulad na lamang sa eksenang sila pa mismo ng pamilya niya ang naghanda ng kanyang isusuot sa Olympics. Religious hypocrisy din ang kinokompronta ng pelikula tulad sa eksenang giniguilt trip ng isang sarado Katoliko na OB GYNE at muli ring pang-guilt trip sa kanya ng pastor na ama ni Miggy kay Sunshine. Si Miggy ay pastor kid na nakabuntis sa dalaga. Hindi na rin naman bago ang pagtalakay ng abortion sa Pilipinas sa pelikulang Pilipino dahil nariyan ang ""High School Scandal"" (1982) sa direksyon ni Gil Portes at ""Hinugot sa Langit"" (1985) na pinagbidahan ni Maricel Soriano at dinirek ni Ishmael Bernal. Ang kagandahan ng pelikula ay babaeng filmmaker ang lumikha at alam niya ang nadarama at pinagdadaanan mapa-pisikal, emosyonal at sikolohikal ng kapwa babae. Napakahusay ni Maris Racal sa pelikulang ito. Ang laking tulong ng cinematog kasi 'yun ang nag-set ng tone at mood ng pelikula over-all. Somewhat reminded of ""Gusto kita with all my hypothalamus"" pagdating sa cinematog.

Sunshine,"SUNSHINE (2024)3.8/5 SAME, ARIANA… She’s a main biàtch!! HAHAHAHA GETS KO NA!! Isa sa mga pinakapulidong gawa ni Direk Tonet. Ka-EME represent, alongside “Never Not Love You” & the iconic “Beauty In A Bottle” and “That Thing Called Tadhana.” Maris Racal literally emanated Sunshine!! She’s a ray of sunshine. This film is really for her. I didn’t know who else can bring Sunshine to life than her. & ANNIKA CO & JENNICA GARCIA…. ACTING MASTERCLASS!! MY FAVES IN ONE FRAME!! THE Xyriel Manabat could’ve been maximized more kasi halimaw sa actingan masterclass, but I think she had a proper exit. It is a delight to see Ms. Angeli Bayani’s presence contrary to her former portrayals. Her character only appeared for how many seconds, BUT THE IMPACT OF HER EXPOSURE IS OVER THE TOP!! Ang nagpalaylay sa storyline is not the open ending, but a rushed conclusion of the problem. Nasagot nga ba ang problema? Anong nangyari kina Miggy at Sunshine? Is ‘Ari-yun-uh’ also a personification that Sunshine only imagine, like Annika’s character? Hindi ko maramdaman ang father and son dynamic nina Elijah Canlas and Mr. Piolo Pascual. However, Piolo’s character, as Pastor Jaime could’ve been explained and discovered more, and not pressed in a few minute exposure. What stood out in the film were Maris, Jennica, Annika, and “Ariana”‘s portrayal. Also, Sunshine, due to her juvenile age, can be prone to misconception and misinformation. In a predominantly Catholic country wherein proper sex education and proper healthcare system are nowhere to be found, and practices are dictated by religion and morality, relying on social media platforms as search engines would mean that she’s susceptible to wrong notions of her reality, which may lead her to resort to the sudden decisions that she make. The debate between religion and choice is long-going in the Philippine context. If the international audiences accepted this film with open arms, it’s about time that the Philippines does the same, and the film’s message would transgress to those without an open mind and for those who are unawakened with the harsh realities that most “Sunshine” faces.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9878431558609009,-1
Sunshine,"Manila in its rawest form. I was teary eyed through the whole movie but something in the scenes always felt lacking. And then I remembered some actual close friends who were once in the same situation, who once asked for my help and company. That what they actually needed was people who would understand and hear them and not who would feel bad for them. This did not intend to resolve anything, cos we have been seeing this in real life and in the news. But this was a good reminder that after all these headlines, after all the movies that tackled the same story, and after all the social media awareness, IS IT’S STILL A PERSISTING PROBLEM FOR MANY FILIPINO CHILDREN AND WOMEN. That we have still yet to save these women, that our authorities still don’t care, and these women are still in danger. MALALA ANG HEALTHCARE, MALALA RIN ANG JUDGMENT! I’m pro-choice because I advocate for a world where children could be children and play freely and grow old and love the life that’s ahead of them. I LOVE YOU SUNSHINE FRIENDS!

Sunshine,"Ito ang ibig kong sabihin kapag sinasabi kong may problematic pattern sa ilang pelikula. Layunin nito ay marahil ipakita ang pinakamasalimuot na kalagayan ng ating lipunan, subalit nauuwi lagi sa paggamit ng trauma at karahasan bilang device lamang. Sa paraang ito, yumuyugto ang kawalan ng respeto sa lived experiences ng mga biktima. Sunshine, however, is not that kind of film.Sa halip na pagsamantalahan ang lunan ng karanasan ng mga kababaihan, pinili ng pelikula na maging mapanagot. It is a story about women, in a world that constantly tries to pin them and to deny them full autonomy and diginity for themselves. Naging maingat at makatao si Direk Tonet sa treatment niya rito sa Sunshine. Hindi niya sinensationalize ang karahasan, bagkus ginawa ito nang may paggalang. Inilantad ang katotohanan pero hindi iniwan sa dulo ang mga biktima at maging ang mga manonood. In this film, we see a woman who is brave. A woman who insists on choosing for herself. A woman who, despite everything, claims her shine. To Sunshine, and to many sunshines out there: ang sinag ninyo ay magmumula sa inyo lamang. Hindi ito hinihiram, hindi ito ibinibigay, sa inyo ito at sa inyo lamang. Kasi gaano man kadilim ang lipunan sa atin, women will always be the brightest. ",2025-07-27,positive,0.5325356125831604,-1

Sunshine,"Nauso na sa mga Pinoy viewers na hihintayin na lang nila sa Netflix yung mga pelikulang Pilipino. Para raw makatipid. Pero karamihan sa kanila, willing gumastos kapag Western superhero movie ang papanoorin. Gets naman din kasi nga may escapism kapag sinasalba ni Superman o ng Fantastic Four ang New York City kumpara sa mga realist stories sa Pilipinas. Bat nga naman kailangan ng malaking screen para lang makitang nag-aaway si Dingdong Dantes at Charo Santos?Pero please, panoorin niyo ang mga pelikulang Pilipino sa big screen, lalo na yung may magandang istorya na maaaring magbigay-linaw pa sa mga isyu. Tulad na lang ng Sunshine ni Antoinette Jadaone. Tungkol ito kay Sunshine (Maris Racal) na naghahanap ng paaran na magpa-abort dahil sa napakaraming rason: hindi planado ang kanyang pagbubuntis, ayaw siyang panagutan ng nakabuntis sa kanya, ayaw na siyang samahan ng kanyang kaibigan, pagtsi-tsismisan siya, at mauudlot ang kanyang pangarap na maging Olympian. Sa dami ng kanyang rason, simple lang naman ang kanyang dahilan: ayaw pa niya maging nanay.Ito ang unang Pinoy film na napanood ko na talagang sinusulong ang karapatan ng babae para sa kanyang katawan. At sa dami ng pinagdaanan ni Sunshine, kahit na may reservations ka sa isyu ng abortion, gugustuhin mong matupad ang gusto ng ating bida. Ramdam na ramdam ko kay Maris ang mga dinadalang problema ni Sunshine hindi lamang bilang isang aspiring Olympian kundi ang isang pagiging babae sa Pilipinas kung saan malakas ang impluwensya ng Catholic values sa ating mga batas.Intersectional din ang pagtalakay ni Jadaone sa isyu ng abortion sa Sunshine. Hindi ito basta-bastang women's rights na nakita natin sa Western media tulad ng Barbie (2024) at Sex Education (2019-2023). Hindi itinanggi o dinemonize ng pelikula ang Catholic guilt pero hinimay ito sa pamamagitan ng pag-humanize nito sa anyo ng batang babae na sumusunod kay Sunshine (Annika Co). Ang ganda ng chemistry nina Maris at Annika at ramdam mong iisa lang talaga sila.So, bakit nga ba dapat panoorin ang Sunshine sa sinehan imbes na hintayin sa Netflix o ano mang streaming service? Napakalalim ng isyu ng aborsyon at women's rights na dapat bigyan ito ng full attention. Pag naman nanonood tayo sa streaming service, may tendency tayong mag-check ng phone. Pero hindi dapat tayo ma-distract habang pinapanood natin si Sunshine. Pag naman sobrang intimidating yung scene, pwede nating i-pause. Pero sa mga ganitong storya, dapat hindi ito pina-pause. Ma-disturb dapat tayo sa ganitong kwento.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9136689305305481,7

I literally got chills and cried when she entered the Inn.What struck me the most is how the film doesn’t romanticize pain it shows the truth as it is. Sunshine’s journey feels real and vulnerable and it makes you think about how every decision carries weight and responsibility. The use of her future child as a reminder of her choices was powerful and emotional.The film speaks about rights, life and the struggles of women how society pressures them while they’re just trying to survive and live freely.

The power of the film is the way it presents and tackles about womanhood and abortion. How Jadaone, shows, and you get it without needing the tell part.Every woman in the film is amazingly presented. From the coach, doctor, sister, and teenager. I’m giving injustice and lackluster narrative of how powerful, impactful, and lustrous the film is. Each frame is enthralling, given Maris’ powerful performance and how raw Manila is portrayed. You take it as it is. The mess, powering through the noise, and living it all every single day.The film also presents a huge middle finger to the hypocrisy of abortion and religion and how the only time Sunshine (Maris) felt free from her prison, which I must say is visually and creatively presented in the film is through her passion as a gymnast.

Sunshine,"Women are frequently placed in situations where they feel they have no choices due to the regressive and harsh judgment of society regarding our rights, particularly our right to safe healthcare. Sunshine, as a whole, has stood firm in its mission, showing why such story is important, as women continue to endure the repercussions of societal choices that place us in jeopardy. This film is undoubtedly one of those that was treated with so much care, showing little to no romanticization of the anger and struggles the characters faced, and most importantly, it did not conform to conservative ideologies.Maris Racal is definitely an actress to keep an eye on; her artistry and commitment to her craft shine through in this film. She certainly delivered one of the most valiant depictions of women in cinema, and it felt just right for her to bring the character of Sunshine to life.And of course, Antoinette Jadaone, who consistently brings depth and authenticity to her female characters, has done it again. As many have said, while anyone can create sociopolitical films, having women write and direct them adds a special touch that connects us to our shared struggles. Jadaone knows exactly how to write her female characters, and there’s nothing more beautiful than a woman who values the lives, journeys, successes, and struggles of her fellow women. Ultimately, as the film shows, it’s women who always end up caring for one another. May we live in a lifetime where abortion is decriminalized and seen as a fundamental aspect of healthcare for every woman, ensuring that no woman ever has to confront death or risk her life due to circumstances that leave her with no choice.",2025-07-27,positive,0.992672860622406,1

Mga babaeng nagpapadali sa mga karanasan ng kapwa kababaihan.

Sunshine,"Dreams carry a powerful force—one that can drive people beyond the bounds of their morals. In the film Sunshine, this force is embodied by a young gymnast, whose ambition, fueled by society’s expectations of fame, pushes her to the edge—physically, psychologically, and morally—as she struggles with the weight of success and an unplanned pregnancy. Surrounding her are characters who reflect and intensify this tension: a doctor torn between personal ethics and the responsibility of helping an abortion patient; a street vendor selling both faith and death, caught in her own contradictions; a friend navigating the rift between her parents’ choices and her own agency; and a coach who, in relentlessly pushing her to break physical limits, unknowingly drives her toward moral collapse. The film offers a counterpoint through the voice of a child—a quiet yet powerful presence that serves as both an echo of the gymnast’s inner conscience and a projection of the expectations society imposes on her. This voice becomes a haunting reminder of who she is and who she is expected to be, grounding her in an innate moral compass even as she’s pulled deeper into chaos, anxiety, and confusion.Sunshine presents a world where the pursuit of dreams comes at a cost, and where ambition blurs the lines between resilience and ruin.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9478053450584412,1

Buti nalang, wala sya nung classic ""Pinoy 3rd act curse"" like Kathryn Bernardo's A Very Good Girl. Actually, the last act pa nga ang strongest part of the film.This is the kind of conversation na kailangan talaga natin pag usapan -- reproductive rights, lack of access to quality healthcare, and so much more.I hope mas marami pa ang makapanuod nitong movie na 'to.

The collective Filipino religious trauma, poverty, crime, the lack of accessible healthcare—it's all encompassing with Sunshine's experience (and to all Filipinas as well).Gets kita, Sunshine.

Sunshine gives voice to the quiet suffering that many Filipinas carry stories of pain, confusion, guilt, and survival. it doesn’t offer simple answers, but it offers empathy. and that’s powerful.i hope more Filipinos get to watch this film, not just to be entertained, but to really listen. to open their hearts and minds to the struggles of women they may not fully understand. i hope it challenges them to reflect, to unlearn, and to care more deeply about the rights and realities of women.sana magets niyo rin",2025-07-27,positive,0.9898009896278381,-1

Sunshine,"How does a young woman endure a life filled with “faithfuls” who feel morally superior to judge and ridicule her choices in a society riddled with antiquated beliefs, further magnified by patriarchal politics where men can walk away without responsibilities and consequences? How do you thrive when institutions that are supposed to protect you are trying to pin you down? Maris Racal shines as the titular character Sunshine, hindi sumosobra o kinukulang, raw, honest, perfectly capturing a young woman in turmoil while trying to show a facade that everything is okay. She is supported by an amazing cast: Annika Co, Elijah Canlas, Xyrel Manabat, Piolo Pascual, Rhed Bustamante, and the most affecting performance of Jennica Garcia.This film captures the gritty essence of Manila without being patronizing or didactic. Each frame is filled with ironies: abortion drugs sold beside a church, a repeated shot of split windows showing dreams, chaos, judgement, and slivers of kindness. One shot in particular shows Sunshine rehearsing at home, on the split side are young people probably coming home from a fun night, kasi bata lang naman si Sunshine and she is willing to sacrifice everything for her dreams, at napakarami pang tulad niya, lahat sila hindi napapakinggan. Listen, read, learn, resist until every woman has autonomy over her body.Drown out the noises, lift your head, close your eyes, and let your light pull you through.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9826651811599731,3
Sunshine,"“gets mo na ‘ko?” id like to believe that the kid was a depiction of sunshine’s conscience and its such a powerful statement to put out there — that sunshine didnt have anyone to convince but herself. that its okay as long as the choice was hers and not anyone else’s, especially in a society that often robs women the decision to make a choice in the first place.and despite the loud and often guilt-ridden noises that paralleled the packed and polluted streets of manila, it contested the catholic and cis-heteropatriarchal belief that the sole purpose of womanhood is motherhood and to choose to become someone else is to sin. but sunshine wouldn’t have come through all odds if it weren’t also for the women in her life that chose to show up for her. the only thing more powerful than the dangers that women are constantly subjected to, are the embrace of fellow women who just understand it. sunshine didn’t even have to utter a single word, her silence, both in her vulnerable and fearless moments, was heard. the quiet glances between her and thea, reassuring her that she is seen. her sister’s arms reaching out to her in bed, making her presence known and reminding sunshine that she’d never be alone, the gentle squeeze of menggay’s hands to let her know she’s safe. they all heard and seen each other, and having someone who’s willing to carry and share your burden with is enough for everything else to be bearable. gets na gets kita Sunshine, at sana mas marami pang mga pilipino ang makarinig at makaintindi sa’yo at sa kuwento mo.",2025-07-26,positive,0.9836000204086304,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine tells the story of a 19-year-old gymnast pursuing her dream of making it to the national team to compete in the SEA Games and eventually, the Olympics until a life-altering event changes everything.Ito marahil ang isa sa pinakamahalagang pelikulang Pilipino ngayong taon, o baka pati na rin sa buong dekada. Hindi ito nagpaligoy-ligoy sa layunin nitong maglahad ng katotohanan masakit man ito o hindi.Unang tumatak sa akin ang pangalang Antonette Jadaone noong napanood ko ang That Thing Called Tadhana. Mula noon, sinusubaybayan ko na ang kanyang mga pelikula maging ito man ay romcom, crime, psychological, o political. Siya at si Direk Dan Villegas ay palaging may tatak: may kirot, may kurot, at higit sa lahat, may lalim.Ang Sunshine ay isang napapanahong pelikula na nagsisilbing mitsa para sa mahahalagang diskusyon: ang kalagayan ng mga atleta sa bansa, ang sistemang pangkalusugan at pang-edukasyon, pananampalataya, gender roles, at higit sa lahat, ang karapatan ng kababaihan sa sariling katawan.Madalas nating marinig: “Ang anak ay biyaya.” Pero kailan nga ba ito nagiging biyaya? Kailan naman ito nagiging pasanin? Ang isang pagbubuntis ba sa murang edad ay dapat tawaging biyaya, lalo na kung ito ay dumating sa panahong hindi pa handa ang isang babae? O isa itong uri ng sumpa, bunga ng sistemang mapanghusga?Hindi laging pisikal ang pang-aabuso sa kababaihan. Minsan, ito ay nasa anyo ng mga ideolohiyang pinipilit ipalunok sa kanila. Kapag inagaw mo ang kakayahan nilang magdesisyon para sa sarili nilang katawan, para sa kinabukasan nila, para sa mga pangarap nila, iyon ay anyo ng pang-aabuso.Wala nang mas akmang gumanap bilang Sunshine kundi si Maris Racal. Ang kanyang pagganap ay puno ng puso’t tapang mula sa kanyang mga sulyap, bawat paghinga, hanggang sa mga katahimikan niya sa ilang eksena. Nararamdaman mo ang kanyang sakit, pangarap, at takot. Isa ito sa mga pinakamahusay na performance ng isang aktres sa kasalukuyang panahon.Ang buong ensemble cast ay maingat na pinili mula kina Elijah Canlas, Meryll Soriano, Jennica Garcia, Annika Co, Rhed Bustamante, Xyriel Manabat hanggang sa mga may limitadong eksena ngunit tumatak: Juan Miguel Garcia, Madeleine Nicolas, Angeli Bayani, at Piolo Pascual. Bawat karakter ay may silbi sa masalimuot ngunit malinaw na salaysay ni Sunshine.Ang pelikulang ito ay malakas, matapang, at mapanghamon. Hindi ito madaling kalimutan. Hindi kami agad nakatayo matapos ang closing credits hindi dahil baka may post-credit scene kundi dahil ninanamnam pa namin ang bigat ng mensahe nito.Sa huli, isang malaking saludo kay Direk Tonet Jadaone. Maraming salamat sa liwanag at lakas ng Sunshine. Sa panahong maraming gustong manahimik, pinili mong magsalita. Mabuhay ka, Direk!Rating:  (5/5 - unanimous)",2025-07-26,positive,0.7244098782539368,1

It's also about courage and knowing oneself better than anyone can. I wish any girl who's forced to choose between herself and other people's plans for her—no matter how more reasonable they are—gets to realize it's not a sin to pick the former, especially if it leads to a more purposeful life for her. And with this, I also hope that the girls who do so, gets to have the same support system Sunshine has.

Sunshine,"Sunshine (2025, Project 8 Projects)I acknowledge that there are a lot of things in life I take for granted as a cisgender man. In Antoinette Jadaone’s new film, Sunshine, she presents a flawed yet heartbreaking tale on the female cost of pregnancy.In the film, we follow nineteen-year-old Sunshine, who has dedicated most of her life, along with the support of her sister who was also a former gymnast, in rhythmic gymnastics and her pursuit to enter the Philippine team for the Olympics. However, several weeks before the National tryouts, Sunshine discovers that she got pregnant after a recent sexual encounter with her boyfriend.Stepping out of the theater, I realized how it’s so hard to be a woman, not just in the Philippines but in general. And pregnancy, one of the human experiences that only a cisgender woman can experience, and how much it impacts on their health, emotions, and even their dreams or aspirations - especially when it happens completely unplanned. All of these are further amplified in the situation here in the Philippines where sexual education is still not a priority, access to quality maternal care is expensive, and role of religion to beset unfair expectations towards women.Despite having a strong message, there are things in Sunshine that I wish had been improved on. I must admit I felt a bit cheated out because the movie was initially hyped as a sports movie focusing on gymnastics - the same way Rookie did for volleyball, but in the end was more of a character drama that whose lead character is a gymnast. I wish that Jadaone delved deeper on Sunshine’s motivations on why gymnastics is important to her because at how the story was written, Sunshine could’ve played any sport and the story would remain the same. Before I get called out, I know the movie’s true intention is a commentary on the state of female reproductive health in the Philippines, but I felt like it was just a missed opportunity to highlight the state of female sports in the Philippines, particularly gymnastics because Filipino sports movies are so rare. I also felt like that the script could’ve been tightened up a bit as the elements of magical realism introduced in the story (without going too much in spoiler territory) didn’t land as much in terms of story logic.As a follow-up to her lead starring role in 2023 movie Marupok AF, Maris Racal continues to be one of the promising actresses of her generation. And in Sunshine, she delivers one of her career best performances so far, especially at lengths her character goes through and in the dedication to train of the gymnastics segments of the story.Overall, Sunshine is not an easy watch because it doesn’t mince the hard truths of how it is living as a woman in the Philippines. And now with with the ongoing female reproductive health and sexual education discussion in the Philippines, Antoinette Jadaone offers a strong message on why it is imperative that protections for women’s health should be passed, and why the movie Sunshine deserves your time and your attention.However, irony that this movie can only be seen by a limited number of people because of its R16 rating as well as the unfair cinema practices in the Philippines, makes this even more frustrating.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9270309209823608,1

Sunshine,"first, i’m so happy of the featured sport. since the achievements of carlos yulo, gymnastics has been rising in the country. i think we need explorations of the fields in which we actually excel, even much more from the perspective of a woman.second, this film has a scent of lino brocka’s—the journey, the road, the streets, the jeep, the buildings, the motel, the church, the stalls and stores, the hospital, the government, the people—the social realism of it all. but different to his, sunshine has its own rhythm—a never-ending going back and forth, a push and pull, a dilemma that only athletes know, only pregnants know, only women know—a jadaone rhythm.third, everything about this film is brave. sunshine is brave. women in this film are brave. the writer is brave. the director is brave. it carefully touches a taboo topic that a lot of filipinos tend to talk about in shallow means, or even a lot also do avoidance of it. but this film just keeps on going and it’s not even apologizing for it. unapologetic but with care. and that is why THIS FILM IS IMPORTANT.maris, you are indeed a sunshine.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9940006136894226,-1

Sunshine stands to be a symbol for what is wrong with Philippine society (healthcare, religion, etc.) and what is right (truly loving and caring family) and could be a source of courage for the many who undergo similar situations but whose voices are drowned out and left unheard.

Sunshine,"CRIMINALIZING  ABORTION  DOESN’T  MAKE  IT  GO  AWAY  IT  ONLY  MAKES  IT  UNSAFE The ph has a long way to go in terms of decriminalizing abortion and accepting it as an actual health issue but this film offers a brave and fresh perspective that needs to be seen and heard. I liked how the subject matter was tackled delicately and with intention. Very raw yung emotions and ang galing ng pag portray ni maris sa character ni sunshine. I also liked how, despite struggling alone, like most women in sunshine and mary grace’s situation, other women can still come through and support each other. Female solidarity or whatttt Also interesting take on religion and how sunshine was also religious and even repenting on her thoughts of aborting her child pero the people around her kept saying na makasalanan at mamamatay tao siya. HMMMAnd the ending !! Very satisfying and gave justice to the main character na despite her circumstances, she still achieved her dream. Thank god hindi ito yung typical na poverty porn na ang sad na nga ng nangyayari, ang sad pa ng kahahantungan.

But I’m glad that, a year later, Sunshine came out, a film that all things considered, is so bold and so loud and so strong in what it wants to say. Leave it to Antoinette Jadaone and Maris Racal not only to craft such a severe, yet truthful and empathetic tale, but also to rally a community to see this film. It makes me feel like we went out with a bellow, and all of our pains, struggles, and heartache with our sudden departure was heard somewhere, somehow.ANIMA was where I really grew into my own as a marketer, a coworker, and as a person.

Sunshine," Maris Racal delivers her most visceral performance to date — raw, quiet, devastating, Annika Co brings subtle intensity as Sunshine’s confidante, brimming with quiet guilt and Jennica Garcia anchors the story with maternal grit and emotional weight. Courage bleeds through every performance; this film demands to be seen a brutal, unflinching portrayal of abortion, rape, and systemic neglect in Philippine society every silence in the film speaks louder than dialogue; breath and ambient sound shape the mood Jadaone’s direction refuses easy comfort — every frame dares you to feel gritty visuals and handheld camera work ground the story in realism Sunshine isn’t just a movie — it’s a mirror, a gut-punch, a reckoningfavorite scene: the ""mata-mata"" scene of xyril and maris.. soundless but full of emotionsleast-liked: this is like a hard pill toswallow, theme is very heavy, but needs tobe seen to spark the conversationverdict: highly recommended, a very important film",2025-07-27,positive,0.9965722560882568,-1

Kulang ang isang oras para magbalik-tanaw sa kwento mo, Sunshine.Isa lamang ang tiyak kong masasabi: Ang hirap maging babae. Ang hirap galawan ng isang lipunang ikinukulong ka sa ideya na ang puwang mo sa mundo ay nakabase sa iyong sinapupunan—sa pagluluwal mo ng bata.Kapag babae ka, hindi ka pwede mangarap nang mataas. Hindi ka pwede maghangad ng magandang career. Kapag babae ka, hindi mo pwedeng piliin ang sarili mo. Kailangan ang timeline ng buhay mo ay nakaangkla sa pagbubuo ng pamilya.Hindi lahat handang maging nanay. Hindi lahat kayang maging nanay. Hindi lahat ng babae ay pipiliin maging nanay.Balang araw, nawa’y makita ng lipunang ito ang kababaihan bilang isang pwersa, bilang isang lakas. Bigyan sana ng lipunang ito ang mga kababaihan ng kalayaang lumipad at kumawala sa mga rehas na pumipigil sa pamumukadkad ng kanyang pakpak.Maraming salamat, Sunshine, sa matapang at mahusay na pagbabahagi ng iyong danas. Isa ka mang kathang-isip, ang buhay mo ay hindi nalalayo sa kasalukuyang tinatahak ng isang babae sa bansang ito.Hindi rito nagtatapos ang kwento mo.

The way the camera and direction paints the complex feelings of Sunshine, the usage of Manila as both familiar yet alienating in its loudness and chaos, the rage and social commentary that is extremely brave in our current societyGiving tons of flowers for this film, I would even say that taking away the campier/comedic aspects of the film would have made this a masterpiece in my eyes!

Favorite ko rito yung little transgressions. Madalas ang pekilula tungkol sa shame, kumporme sa shame. That is to say parang laging uphill battle. Pero dito ni minsan hindi ako kinabahan para kay Sunshine. Panatag na panatag ako, nakakatuwang panoorin ang deliryo ng biyahe niya mula Quiapo-Avenida-Paco. Wala akong awa, naluluha lang ako sa lungkot. Bitin na bitin lang ako sa last sequence which looking back looked like an Aronofsky reference but contrivedHere is Maris Racal, who I’ve told my friends has a Mona Lisa face. Minsan 'di ko mawari kung anong nararamdaman niya, but with her command on-screen you could tell what she wants. Desperado. That is an actor you want to play Sunshine.Because Sunshine only has her mistakes to prop her up to dreams, which is a tricky proposition in the city, but nonetheless possible. And is often the case. Kailangang gustong-gustong-gustuhin mo lang talaga. Some kneel for a quarter-mile in Quiapo. Ang iba, pumapatay.

Mahirap maging babae sa bansang hindi kumikilala sa mga karapatan ng mga kababaihan.

Nakakalungkot ang reyalidad. Pero hindi pa tapos ang laban. May this be an eye opener to many and may we be advocates of safer and more accessible reproductive health.

Sunshine,"ang tagal ko bago isulat yung review ko sa SUNSHINE. sa pangkalahatan, walang duda—maganda at matapang ang pelikula. hindi lang maganda sa produksyon, kundi nakakanginig din ng laman. ang galing ng mga aktor, mula sa mga beteranong sina meryll soriano, xyriel manabat, elijah canlas, hanggang sa mga mas batang bituin na sina annika at julius. at higit sa lahat, si maris, na may malalim at matalim na hugot. simple pero malinaw ang paraan niya ng paghahatid ng mensahe: ang mga babae ang gulugod ng lipunan. nag-iiwan ‘to ng tanong na bakit sa kabila ng bigat ng responsibilidad na iyon, mailap pa rin ang mundo sa kanila? representasyon ang pelikulang ito na kulang pa ang mga diskusyon patungkol sa mga karapatan ng mga babae sa pilipinas. sa pelikulang ito, hindi ko kayang maging kritikal dahil alam kong hindi ko hawak ang karapatang humusga sa kwento ni sunshine. HINDI KO ITO KWENTO, at siguro iyon ang pinakamahalagang bagay na kailangang kong maunawaan. ako ay taganood lamang, at bilang manonood, ang tanging sigurado ako ay kung paano pinaigting ng pelikulang ito ang pagmamahal ko para sa kababaihan.habang pinapanood ko, parang unti-unting lumalalim ang pagkakaunawa ko na hindi pa rin patas ang batas sa mga kababaihan. mas nagkaroon ako ng lakas na sumandig sa tabi nila, sa pakikibaka para sa maayos, pantay, at respetadong pagtrato. hindi ko kailanman lubos mauunawaan ang bawat sakit, takot, at pag-aalinlangan na kaakibat ng pagiging babae pero dahil sa pelikulang ito, mas malinaw na sa akin: sila ang sentro ng komunidad. at kung may dapat magbago, hindi sila iyon ngunit ang sistema, paniniwala, at pagtingin ng komunidad sa kanila.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9282937049865723,-1

Watched it twice and it just got better — the first time i was focused with everything about Sunshine, her dreams, her feelings, her frustrations, her struggles; the second time I was more immersed with all the other characters in Sunshine’s life (including and especially the Kid) and how they perfectly represented the different faces of judgment or support or even her own thoughts and contemplations.Nothing more to add kasi wala talaga ako nakitang mali sa film.

Sunshine,"an underrated beauty of cinema is how it can invite one into a suspended state of reality. for a brief and borrowed hour or two, our story pauses to make space for someone else’s. sunshine (2024) is one of those rare films that honors the lending of time not with surprise and spectacle, but with empathy as its goal and medium for exploration.and the language of empathy in sunshine settles in slowly, almost bodily. aptly named, the movie seeps through the senses like the quiet force of nature: it casts a harsh light on the grayed and shadowed alleys of manila, where sins and prayers blur into one cruel cacophony. it burns with familiarity when we recognize sunshine, the girl, in our own world.she sits beside us in overcrowded jeepneys, gets scolded like us in hospital beds, walks among us on streets of quiapo that shame and steal a strip of dignity. with the same light, the film reaches for the sunshine within us - the ones who dream and persist, who dare hold our potential as promises. there are sunshines among us held tightly by sisters, while some sunshines are held up only as stubborns who flicker through the dark. yet herein lands the most transcendent part of the film: it peddles no moral lesson or pedantic sermon. all that it offers is an invitation to bear witness to sunshine, as she moves to the rhythm of a music only she can hear and pushes against the gravity of choices forced upon her. the film doesn’t seek answers; it simply asks for understanding. in its own sober way, it holds out hope that when the borrowed time is up, may we not only remember every sunshine who flies and rises, but also the ones who fall and return, until we see how every ground that meets her, holds her, or traps her, as she labors to birth her becoming, is also the same one we own.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9906835556030273,1

Sunshine,"Si Sunshine ay ako.Hindi man ako rhythmic gymnast, pero may pangarap din ako. Gaya ng maraming babae at dalaga na dumaan sa unwanted pregnancy o pregnancy scare, ramdam ko ang takot ni Sunshine. Yung pagkabalisa at pag-ukit ng konsensya kapag nakahiga sa kama. Yung konsensyang lalong lumalalim kapag may mahinang katok sa pinto. Ito na siguro ang pelikula na kung ang younger self ko ang makakapanood, hindi niya magugustuhan na nakakarelate ako kay Sunshine. Pero ganito talaga, personal na ito sa akin. Naiintindihan ko si Sunshine. Damang dama ko yung galit. Yung takot. Yung tapang, na bahala na nga basta wag lang mapurnada ang mga plano. Ramdam ko at alam ko kung saan hinugot ni Sunshine yung tapang na 'yon. Ang karakter ni Sunshine ay nakaangkla sa batang pasulpot-sulpot. Para sa akin, inner child niya ‘yon. Pero may kasama akong nanood na nagsabing baka konsensya niya raw 'yon. Pwede rin.Tingin ko inner child niya 'yon, dahil sa tricycle scene, duguan rin ang hita ng bata. Na para bang sinasabi na kung iniinda ni Sunshine ang sakit at pilipit ng puson, dama rin yon ng inner child niya. Nasasaktan. Naaawa. Maliban doon, gusto ko rin i-emphasize kung gaano ka poetic ng eksena. Naka higa sa hita ng bata si Sunshine na nag-aagaw-buhay. Hinihinging lumaban siya. Hindi ba't magandang pagnilayan na sa lowest points ng buhay, ang boses na naririnig mo ay ang boses ng munting ikaw? Maliit, oo, pero may bigat, may bagahe.Ang rason naman kung bakit daw konsensya ni Sunshine ang bata, ay dahil sa eksena sa ospital. Galit na galit ang bata kay Sunshine at hinahanap niya si Ariana, isa ring batang pasulpot-sulpot. Ineexplain ni Sunshine na okay na si Mary Grace pero ang importante para sa kanya ay si Ariana, na nawawala. Nawala na ba si Ariana dahil nawala na rin ang dinadala ni Mary Grace?Pero sa kabila ng lahat, matapang si Sunshine. Doon sa unang hospital scene, kita mong may hiyang nararamdaman si Sunshine. Pero dahil sa trauma at pagkalito, sunod lang siya sa pinagsasabi ng overly righteous na doktora. Hanggang sa napuno si Sunshine. Isa sa pinaka-paborito kong linya niya ay nang tanungin niya ang doktora: ""Para saan?"" Na para bang may panghuhusga rin si Sunshine sa kanya. Ang daming layers ng pelikulang ‘to. Hindi lang siya tungkol sa isang babae. Kwento ito ng pinagdadaanan ng isang babae sa isang bansa na binigo at binibigo ang mga kababaihan na magkaroon ng karapatan na magdesisyon para sa katawan nila. Nagbabago na ang panahon. Hindi na dapat taboo ang usapin ng sex at sex education. Higit sa lahat, ang mga batang gaya ni Mary Grace ang pinaka bulnerable sa lahat. Ramdam ko rin si Mary Grace. Ano ang laban ng isang 13-year-old sa isang Uncle Bobot? Alam nating maraming Uncle Bobot. At dapat lang na basagan ng bote sa ulo ang mga kagaya nila. Maraming kagaya ni Mary Grace, nananahimik lang, natatakot. Kaya nga ang pelikula at kwentong ito ay magandang halimbawa ng quote na:“Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.” Mahusay. Napakahusay. Truly a landmark film.",2025-07-27,positive,0.5526455044746399,12
Sunshine,"We are introduced to Sunshine through her warming up with other student-athletes and performing her routine for the upcoming Olympic team tryouts. Viewers can tell that her prowess and national team member status is a mix of talent and hard work, that even when she messes up halfway through, it doesn't make her any less of a great gymnast.When she first finds out that she is pregnant, the camera focuses on her hands tremble. But she immediately acts on it – searching for suspicious dealers for pills, telling the boy that knocked her up, and going to church to pray that the Lord takes away the being forming in her womb – even when we see glimpses of her trying not to lose her composure in the humid streets of Manila.The film shows and justifies Sunshine's reasons for wanting an abortion, even if the means available in the Philippines will harm her. She has dreams that can't be put on hold, and she clearly is a young girl with mannerisms and tendencies deemed ""immature"" – factors that do not make her fit to be a mother.But in a scene wherein she talks to a pastor (played by Piolo Pascual, who made everyone in my cinema gasp) that promises financial support throughout her pregnancy and motherhood, she rejects it. ""Ayoko maging nanay,"" she says, plain and simple.That was my favorite part of the film, because it felt cathartic to hear it. Although Sunshine had good reasons for the choices she makes, we must not need to have justified, valid, and layered reasons for wanting an abortion. Some of us do not want to be mothers and undergo the medical complications that come with carrying a child, just because.I hope that it has more time to stay in cinemas.

Sunshine,"The body of the story may be about Sunshine, but its soul revolves around Menggay.From the moment the official trailer dropped, Sunshine instantly captured my interest. I’ve been waiting ever since for the chance to see it and after months of anticipation, I finally did. And now, I can say this without hesitation: I have nothing but praises for the film.More than just well-made, Sunshine is a brave and necessary work. It’s a film that demands to be seen — not only because of Maris Racal’s powerful performance, but because of how urgent and relevant its message is in today’s world.Unlike other films that leave you in feel-good state when the credits roll, Sunshine leaves you with questions — difficult, uncomfortable questions that deserve to be brought into the open.What if women had better options?What if men received the same public scrutiny when it comes to unwanted pregnancies?What if we had a healthcare and justice system that actually protects girls like Menggay?What if we dared to talk about abortion in a way that invites honest, compassionate, and informed discussion?This is where the film finds its power. When Menggay’s story arc unfolds, that’s when Sunshine cements its message, it stops being just a film and starts becoming a mirror to reality.Because this is for the countless Menggays out there — young girls with no real choices. Mga batang gaya niya. Isang 13-anyos na tinanggalan ng karapatan ng mismong sariling pamilya.And the painful truth is: there are far too many Menggays in our country. Uneducated. Deprived of opportunities. Denied the chance to choose a safer path forward.Watching this film taught me to become more open-minded. It urged me to weigh both the pros and cons of abortion more critically, and to consider how we can use art as a tool for education and awareness.In the end, Sunshine is not just a film — it’s a challenge. A challenge to our government to craft better, more inclusive campaigns. Ones that don’t just resonate with the intellectuals but reach the grassroots, where change is most needed. #Sunshine",2025-07-28,positive,0.9923668503761292,1
Sunshine,"After two decades in the industry, Antoinette Jadaone has cemented her capacity to bend, direct, and write with different genres — the deconstruction of ekstras with Lilia Cuntapay, the ironic and hilarious takedown of cosmetic surgery industry with Belo-approved meta-comedy “Beauty in a Bottle,” and the dialogue-driven romantic hugot dramas with ‘Tadhana.” Without a doubt, Jadaone stands as one of the most vital voices in Philippine filmmaking today, consistently challenging conventions and pushing Filipino Cinema forward. In all her films, one thing that’s notable she's put women's voices at the forefront. She has since taken a pandemic pause after Fan Girl, but this has also led to her researching and diving deep into her most recent film, Sunshine. The film follows a student gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal), who discovers she’s pregnant just as she’s about to compete for the SEA Games. The film takes a surreal turn when she encounters a kid/ alter ego appears in crisis moments, reflecting her inner turmoil as she faces societal judgment.Throughout the film, Sunshine’s emotional arc—marked by anguish, desperation, and vulnerability—lays bare the reality where women’s access to safe choices is morally questioned and legally denied. This taboo isolates her: abandoned by friends and her partner, judged by doctors, and pressured by her coach to give up her dreams. Social stigma is one, but the films also highlights how poverty and consequently, sexual miseducation put into question the dignity of women. To be able to choose freely, is too high of a cost for Sunshine who has to deal with its social, financial, and legal repercussions. The film understands how for women in the fringes there’s little to no choice.The film is not without hope. Her sister, who’s a single mother, grounds Sunshine. Her alter ego serves as emotional salve during her many crises. And she also chances upon an underaged girl months into her pregnancy who reflects and echoes her experiences. In each of them, Jadaone realizes Sunshine’s future: to be a single mother, carry her pregnancy to term, and have a daughter. The film effectively wrestles with the nuances of her situation: to choose her dreams or be with a child. Ironically, Sunshine occasionally stumbles under the weight of its many themes: its surreal elements and side characters threaten to overshadow Sunshine’s emotional arc. It makes one wonder how better the film would have been had it just been, as the film title suggested, about Sunshine. Nevertheless, the film is a showcase of Jadaone’s confident vision.There’s this wonderful scene in the film of a maternity ward that just for brief moment became a community for pregnant women and mothers helping and supporting one another. It epitomizes the warmth that carries Sunshine forward: from isolation to solidarity, and from uncertainty to self-understanding. Parting with her past, she talks to her alter ego hoping she’d understand. They hug. To be understood that’s just what Sunshine needed.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9783662557601929,-1

Sunshine,"Alam kong napakahalaga ng pelikulang ito sa kababaihan pero ang hiling ko ay sana mas maraming kalalakihan ang makapanood nito.Ang misogyny at patriyarka ay mga problemang dulot naming mga lalaki. Matibay ang paniniwala kong kami ang dapat may pinakamalaking ambag sa pagbubuwag ng mga ito. Dapat kami ang nagpepenitensya. Pero hindi ganito ang realidad. Mga babae tulad ni Sunshine, Menggay, at ang maraming babae sa pelikulang ito ang bumabaka at nagdurusa sa ilalim ng huwad na sistema. Tila habambuhay silang nagpepenitensya para sa isang kasalanang hindi matubos-tubos kahit pa anong gawin nila—ang kasalanan ng pagiging babae.Mahusay ang pagpapakita ng Sunshine sa iba't ibang impyernong dinaranas ng kababaihan: personal, panlipunan, pisikal, mental, pinansyal, sekswal, at, higit sa lahat, pulitikal. Ramdam ito sa bawat eksena kung saan galit, pag-aalala, at pagod ang namamayagpag sa mga linya, ekspresyon, imahe, at tunog. Pati nga mismo ang kalagayan nito bilang pelikula ay isang impyerno rin: ang masalimuot na danas nina Direk Tonet sa paghahanap ng distributor, ang katotohanang madalang abutin ng mga ganitong pelikula ang mainstream consciousness ng mga Pilipno, ang mabilis na pagliit ng bilang ng mga sinehan na nagpapalabas nito, at ang nagbabadyang diskurso na tiyak na magiging mapaghati. Samakatuwid, ang pelikula mismo ay dumaan at patuloy na dadaan sa impyernong ginawa ng patriyarka.Ipinapakita ng Sunshine na mula noon hanggang ngayon, kababaihan ang umaako sa responsibilidad na hamunin at buwagin ang patriyarka. Kaya sana mapanood ito ng mas marami pang lalaki, lalo na kung hindi pa sila mulat sa realidad ng kababaihan, mga batang ina, at mga biktima ng sekswal na karahasan. Tayong mga lalaki ang nag-imbento at nakikinabang sa patriyarka. Tayo ang may kasalanan, tayo ang dapat magpenitensya.",2025-07-25,positive,0.936455249786377,-1

Sunshine,"i knew i had to watch this before this film disappears off the face of the earth like gitling did. no regrets because this might be antoinette jadaone’s magnum opus yet. sunshine (2025) had no metaphors and subtle parallelisms: it screams that a woman’s autonomy is her own. a very straight-forward, well-thought of, and a passionate piece about how a woman was made to struggle the moment she was born by the system and how it’s designed to take away her ownnes. this is true for everywhere else in the world; but much more significant in the context of a third world country such as the philippines. abortion is a controversial topic in the country, to say the least. it is seen as a violation to the sanctity of life—a sin to remove a clump of cell in a human body. swayed by the biblical texts and the catholic church, abortion is illegal in the country. but for women like sunshine and mary grace, the law does little to stop the reality: it only pushes them to do the act in shadows, where the only option is unsafe and risky. the religious references throughout the film were palpable: from the jeepney that sunshine rode to quiapo bearing the sign that says “gift of God” to sunshine’s physical manifestation of her conscience in the form of her would-be child—which shows an inner conflict between her faith and survival. these references do not seem disrespectful but rather an emphasis on how deeply stitched sunshine’s struggle to catholicism is. it’s a critique on how the bible is weaponized to police a woman’s choices and her bodily autonomy. i want to make a point on the healthcare system too which the film really did a good job criticizing: with all its faults, the healthcare system is biased against women. the lack of access to safe procedures, institutional neglect, and moral policing (made by professionals, mind you) leave women like sunshine and mary grace with nowhere to turn. the lack of quality healthcare in the country is so normalized that it leaves everyone no dignified options to address even their basic needs. a perfect film that paints intersectionality so well: women from different sectors, despite having the same oppressor, face different realities. it did not sensationalize abortion but it gave the audience another angle to look at it from; in a perspective that’s raw and honest. i was crying at the end (#that scene) because in spite all this, she prevailed. a woman, in a system that set her up to fail, survived and lived to achieve her dreams.overall, sunshine (2025) was hopeful, important, and full of courage. an important film that must be seen by everyone (and more importantly, by women). maris racal, you are a generational talent, you deserve all the flowers AND jennica garcia, this piece’s hidden gem, you have mothered on a scale no one has ever had before.",2025-07-28,positive,0.9917216897010803,1

Sunshine,"This movie had balls. It tackled one of the most taboo things in Filipjno culture; abortion. Everything was thrown at Sunshine, all facets of belief, both negative and positive. But in the end, what prevailed was her dream, and how its actually okay . The idea of giving a Jojo rabbit persona to the unborn children worked well for me. It gave those children a voice.

Sunshine,"Few films manage to hold intensity, tenderness, and truth all at once-but Sunshine does.It was a brave story of strength, love, and kindness. Yet it was also sharp, honest in its portrayal of the harsh realities young Filipina women often endure: the limits imposed on their bodies, their choices, their futures.And still, it was warm. It never allowed you to drown in despair. Instead, it held you with care, gently reminding you that even in the most shadowed and uncertain places, light still finds its way in.Just like its title, Sunshine felt like light breaking through, like a quiet kind of hope that chooses to stay.",2025-07-23,positive,0.990962564945221,1
Sunshine,"Sunshine’s strength lies on its strong messaging. It confronts the audience— yes, what you heard was right. Maternity wards are in terrible conditions. A lot of R*pe and incest victims are of that age. Bigotry and victim-blaming play a huge part in our society. Antoinette Jadaone doesn’t tiptoe or walk around with her message: she is loud, angry, and knows where she stands. Her direction is both observational and sympathetic, allowing the audience to feel for Sunshine and feel helpless in situations out of our control. Despite all of these, it’s an incredibly hopeful movie about choice. Maris Racal is radiant and fantastic, and Jennica Garcia is the heart of the film.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9839403629302979,1

Sunshine,"Sabi nila, kapag ang isang pelikula ay tumatak sa damdamin at isipan ng manonood, naiparating nito ang mensahe nais ipaabot. Kapag dala mo pa rin ito hanggang sa pagtulog mo, ibig sabihin ay maganda ang pagkakagawa. At kung pagising mo'y ito pa rin ang laman ng isip mo, isa itong tunay na obra maestra.Naalala ko pa noong una kong mapanood ang That Thing Called Tadhana. Alam kong iba si Direk Tonet. Para niyang binago ang pormula ng mga pelikulang Pilipino. Simula noon, naging tagahanga na ako ng kaniyang mga gawa. Walang tapon sa kaniyang filmography. May lalim ang bawat karakter na nililikha niya. Naiipakita niya ang mga struggle at kahinaan naming mga babae, pero kasabay nito, naipapakita rin niya kung paanong buong tapang naming niyayakap ang aming pagkababae.At sa pelikulang ito, mas lalo niyang pinatunayan kung gaano siya kagaling bilang direktor. Alam ko nang magiging maganda ito, mula pa lang sa premise at trailer, kuhang-kuha na niya ako. Pero nang mapanood ko na ito nang buo, mas lalo akong humanga. Panahon na, sa tingin ko, para kilalanin si Direk Tonet bilang isa sa mga haligi ng pelikulang Pilipino. Ang pelikulang ito ang magbubukas ng daan para mas mapansin siya hindi lang bilang direktor ng rom-com, kundi bilang isang seryoso at malalim na haligi ng sining at dakilang manunulat.Bawat shot, pinag-isipan. Hindi lang basta kinuha para lang sa aesthetic. Bawat karakter, may saysay at mahalagang ambag sa buhay ni Sunshine, hindi lang basta comic relief o pandagdag lang sa cast. Mahusay ang bawat isa, lalong-lalo na si Jennica Garcia, kada eksena niya, tagos sa puso. Napakahusay rin ng batang si Annika Co, kaya niyang makipagsabayan sa mga beterano. Siya ang nagmistulang liwanag, ang ""sunshine"" sa kabuuan ng pelikula.At si Maris Racal—kung hindi siya mananalo ng mga acting awards, ewan ko na lang. Para siyang isinilang para sa papel na ito. Bitbit niya ako sa bawat eksena. Bawat ngiti, bawat pikit ng mata, bawat hinga, ramdam na ramdam ko si Sunshine. Ang lalim ng koneksiyon ko sa kaniya. Wala akong ibang hiniling kundi matapos na ang paghihirap niya. Dahil 'yon sa galing ng pag-arte ni Maris. Nagawa niyang kumonekta sa kaluluwa ng mga manonood hanggang magroll ang credits.Hindi na kinailangang i-detalye pa ang mahabang backstory para makilala si Sunshine. Ang galing ng pagkakasulat. Walang patay na eksena, lahat mahalaga, lahat may emosyon. Mararamdaman mo ang lahat: awa, inis, galit, tawa, lungkot, takot, pag-asa, at saya.Ito ay nagsilbing tinig ng mga kababaihan. GETS NA GETS tayo ng pelikulang ito. Hindi lang nito binunyag ang mapait na realidad ng mga kababaihan, pero ipinakita rin nito kung paanong ang mga babae ay kayang maging unapologetically passionate sa mga gusto namin sa buhay, sa mga pangarap namin. Dagdag na rin ang pasilip kung gaano kahirap na itinatawid ng mga atletang Pilipino ang buhay sa loob at labas ng pagsasanay.Hindi perpekto si Sunshine, pero kahanga-hanga ang pagkakabuo ng kaniyang pagkatao. Ang ganda ng paghubog sa kaniyang karakter. Lagi na lang nagtatanong ang kalalakihan: “Bakit ang mga babae na lang ang laging maingay? Bakit sila ang laging humihingi ng karapatan?” Para bang pakiramdam nila’y binabalewala na sila sa modernong panahon. Sana mapanood nila ito. Sana makita nila kung gaano unfair ang mundo para sa kababaihan. Sa aspetong pisikal pa lang, talo na kami. Kaya kung maaari, bigyan man lang sana ng puwang ang aming mga karapatan na matagal na namin hinihiling na pagbigyan. Ang dali-daling talikuran ng lalaki ang responsibilidad, pero sa babae? Kami ang nagdadala ng lahat ng iniwan na pinsala mapa-mental, pinansyal, emosyonal, sosyal, at lalong lalo na sa pisikal.Ang pelikulang ito ay isang mahigpit na yakap para sa kababaihan, at isang mata na bumubulaga sa mga nananatiling bulag sa mga hinaing at karapatang matagal na naming ipinaglalaban. Ito ang klase ng mga pelikulang minsan lang dumating sa ating buhay at siguradong mananatiling relevant sa mga susunod pang taon.",2025-07-28,negative,0.5468562245368958,7

Isang pelikulang binigyang kulay ang isang usapin na matagal nang pinapadilim — ang karapatan ng kababaihan. Hindi ito pag-romanticize ng abortion. Ito ay pagtindig sa matagal nang pinapatay na diskurso tungkol sa maling ideolohiya, diskriminasyon, at ang paulit-ulit na pagkundena sa kakayahan ng babae na magdesisyon para sa sarili.Ang bigat ng mga eksena, pero ang galing — kasi ang gaan nitong naipaintindi. Gets ko na.Salamat, Direk Antonette, sa tapang at galing mong magkwento. Kay Maris, na sa loob ng higit isang oras at kalahati, ay naging si Sunshine — at naging kaibigan ko. Sa buong cast, salamat sa pagbuo ng mundong hindi namin kayang talikuran, dahil ito ang totoo.Kung may oras ka, panoorin mo Sunshine.

She gave it all for this. The movie is full of different emotions. You will laugh, become angry, and be inspired. It is a story of a struggling athlete and the reality of different social issues in the country. The cinematography was superb, showing the different scenes in a way that made you get hooked and feel the emotion. The dialogue was natural and sublime and not filtered to show the actuality of what would happen. WHAT I LOVE THE MOST IS THE TWIST ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF ANNIKA AS “BATA”. It sealed the deal.

It spoke so loudly to me of how a woman's life could change from bearing a child in your womb. it could shatter your dreams, make your life critical, or give you a life you have always wanted- to become a mother. Annika, the bata, as a narrative device to signify conscience of Sunshine was Jadaone's wonderful choice to gently discuss a sensitive topic such as abortion without deafening the fetus inside of a pregnant woman. Sunshine was a cinematic storytelling of coming to a decision, with never-ending to contradictions with your conscience and peeking through jalousies of other people's similar but different narratives, to come to a choice for yourself, as a woman.",2025-07-28,positive,0.9939694404602051,32

Sunshine,"The chaotic rhythm of life.Spoilers ahead.Bold and controversial, writer-director Antoinette Jadaone continues her non-romantic-comedy streak with another compelling and dark subject matter through ""SUNSHINE"". Gracing the screen is the titular character, played by Maris Racal in her career-best performance, who finds out she's pregnant while she prepares for her Olympic-qualifying event. Trouble ensues, dream and ambition crash.Teenage pregnancy and women conditions take front and center as the film gives voice to the usual silenced of the society. Jadaone may have placed rhythmic gymnastics in the background but it excellently serves as a metaphorical tool to describe the ebb and flow of Sunshine's life. We see her struggles pitted against conservativism and arguable morality in a country where religion and patriarchy rule and shackle. Through magic realism where we are introduced to two young players who abruptly show up mid-scenes, the film gets a rich layer on how our lead navigates her perilous journey. They channel the moral compass though at times their appearances and comedic flair tend to be uneven and out of timing. Racal, with her sharp strength and vulnerability, is utterly commendable but so is her supporting cast - Jennica Garcia and Meryl Soriano as her strong-willed yet nurturing older sister and coach respectively, Annika Co as her unborn child manifestation (an unpredictable plot twist that eventually made sense), and even the cameos from Madeleine Nicolas, Angeli Bayani, Angie Castrence, Elijah Canlas, and Piolo Pascual fulfill their impressive character actor repertoire. Some arcs and scenes could have been fleshed out because it's got a premise worth exploring but the Philippine censorship may have played its upper hand to prevent the film's full bloom. In the same vein of ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days"", ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"", and ""Happening"", it may not be everyone's cup of tea due to its hefty topic and open-endedness but it's a delight to see an important Filipino film that fearlessly opens the conversation to empower women more on making their own reproductive choices, even with the deafening noise and outdated discourse.Quiapo.

Sunshine,"Been eyeing this film since last year. Fortunately enough, I was able to watch this yesterday with my Mom. In the midst of darkness and rain, we looked for Sunshine.It adds surrealism without sacrificing its groundedness. Remember crying in a few scenes just because of how real it felt and then that sudden realization hits me, and I remember — nangyayari talaga siya sa totoong buhay yet it's inadequately addressed. Alienated, discriminated, and hidden behind idols and symbols stained with shame like the Sunshines and Menggays who are forced to comply with the rules set by a patriarchal, hypocritical, conservative society. I think this film won't force you to agree with its message but it challenges our morals and belief system. Above all, it only asks to be understood. There's multiple shades of womanhood that's not confined within a black and white backdrop. And it's good that we start and continue to talk about it. Overall, this film isn't just about abortion — it's a critique on society, politics, and feminism. As well as a call for women's accessible reproductive healthcare.Ps. Dahil sobrang lakas ng ulan pagpunta namin ng nanay ko sa sinehan, halos basa na likod namin, especially likod niya. I had to buy her a blanket (which she had in her back while watching the film). She chose this pinkish? Almost corally one.

Sunshine,"Grabe gets ko na bat sya award winning.Before I even entered the cinema, prepared na aq mag cry cry. I saw the trailer, the interviews, and the podcasts so I was bracing myself for emotional confrontations and intense family drama pero wala so what really made me cry was how real everything felt. The way Sunshine just tried to carry on, the way Jennica quietly supported her, and the way the story showed how painfully human this situation is. There was so much honesty in how it was told. Pogi din ni Papa P.As a woman who has experienced a teen pregnancy scare before, I saw parts of myself in Sunshine. That helpless feeling, the fear of not knowing what to do, the shame, and the silence around it… It was all too familiar. I also have friends who’ve gone through it for real. They shared their stories, and as I watched the film, I could see their experiences mirrored by Sunshine.Maris Racal is amazing as Sunshine. Everything about her performance was convincing, from the way she moved to the way she spoke (pero direk kita yung face ng double ni Sunshine ha ). She really looked like a young athlete from a struggling family, someone whose life revolved around discipline and dreams until it all came crashing down. I’ve seen Maris in different roles before, like in Incognito, where she played this aircon ex-military girly na mukhang ginagawang pangbahay ang gucci, it’s rlly impressive how she completely transforms into Kanal Sunshine bc she doesn’t just act the part, she becomes it.Jennica also stood out for me. As Sunshine’s Ate, her presence was comforting throughout the film. She had this motherly vibe that felt very natural. I liked how the film gave her character depth without spelling everything out. You could tell that her love for Sunshine came from a place of experience, like she had her own quiet struggles too. Galing din ni Annika.Even the supporting casts delivered. The manghihilot, the abortion pill seller, the doctors and the people Sunshine met along the way weren’t just fillers. Their performances felt soooooo real, and they matched the tone of the film so well. I didn’t feel like I was watching actors, I felt like I was watching people actually living through these moments.Sa ibang indie films, I cringe when I hear characters cursing because it feels like the writers are just slapping random tangina words trying too hard to sound edgy or cool. But here, everything made sense. The dialogue flowed naturally. The curse words weren’t just for shock, they felt earned u know. One of the scenes that stayed with me was in the motel. It was quiet, then the sound of a train passing by filled the background. That sound stuck with me. It gave the scene so much weight. It felt like the world outside was moving forward, while Sunshine was stuck in a moment where everything felt uncertain. That kind of sound detail is the kind of thing I really appreciate.As someone na working din sa field, I couldn’t help but notice the small design details. Sunshine’s costumes were on point, from her jerseys na may ibat ibang year (aminin, pambahay natin mga intrams shirt ) to the athletic tapes on her body, to her bag full of pins and cute hair clips. Those little choices made feel convincing talaga. She looked like an actual teen athlete, not just someone pretending to be one.The scene in the church was another standout. She didn’t even go inside. She stayed outside and prayed, and that choice said so much. It was symbolic. It showed how distant she probably felt from her faith or how unworthy she thought she was in that moment. That kind of framing really hit me.I also appreciated the sound design. Instead of dramatic bg music, they focused ambient sounds. It gave everything a grounded feeling. It was like I was right there with her, experiencing everything in real time.The pacing was perfect. There were no awkward pauses, no scenes that felt unnecessary. Sa ibang movies, may moments na napapa-phone lang ako hahahah Every second mattered. Every moment added layers to the story. Even the locations were smartly chosen. They weren’t overly stylized. They felt like real places people actually live in and go through things in.Award ka talaga Sunshine.

Sunshine,"Sobrang fitting na sunshine ang title ng pelikulang ito dahil katulad ni sunshine, may tapang, puso, at pagkakakilanlan ang pelikula. Matapang dahil bilang predominantly catholic country na sobrang na ka-angkla ang paniniwala, mga desisyon, at disposisyon sa buhay sa kung ano ang tama at mali sa bibliya, isang malaking hakbang ang ipakitang tumaliwas sa nakaugalian at kinalakihang ideya ng kung ano ang “tama”. Matapang dahil sa mundo at sa bansang sobrang patriyarkal na nag c-cater lamang sa kalalakihan, walang pag-uubling pinakita na wala dapat may ibang may karapatan sa katawan at kapakanan ng isang babae kung hindi sila lamang. Matapang kasi ilegal ang aborsyon sa pilipinas at imoral ang tingin sa mga taong gustong gawin ‘to pero walang tako’t na ipinakita na katulad ni sunshine, may mga babeng hindi ginusto at gustong maging ina at dapat ay may karapatan silang mamili. May puso kasi naguumapaw sa pagmamahal ang pelikula. Pagmamahal ng kapatid, kaibigan, mentor. At higit sa lahat ang pagmamahal sa kapwa babae. Ang pagmamahal na ipinakita ni sunshine kay menggay, ang pagmamahal na pinakita ni doctora helena sa kanilang dalawa. Masakit in a way pero sobrang gandang isipin na women will always have each other’s back at the end of the day. Walang titindig para sa isang babae nang lubos kung hindi babae lamang rin. Ngunit ang nangibabaw rito ay ang pagmamahal ni sunshine sa sarili niya at sa kanyang mga pangarap. May doubts si sunshine bilang isang babae, bilang isang katoliko. Kaya nga ilang beses natin siya nakitang nagdasal eh at kaya na rin nag e-exist ang karakter ni annika co. Siya yung nagsilbing physical form ng nagsalong upbringing at inhibitions ni sunshine pero at the end of the day, nanaig pa rin ang pagmamahal niya sa pangarap niya. Ang ganda, sobrang ganda. May pagkakakilanlan kasi sobrang pinoy na pinoy ‘tong pelikulang ito. Mula sa kung paano pinakita yung ingay at gulo ng maynila, hanggang sa dynamics ng magkakapatid sa pamilyang pilipino. Pati kung paano nabubuhay ang mga babae sa bansang bulok ang reproductive health system at hindi tanggap ang pagiging sexual nila. Sunshine is now my favorite maris racal performance which was previously held by peachy of Pamilya Ko. I know it’s the bare minimum and literally the point of acting but you can really tell she’s a good actress kasi walang bahid ng kung sino si maris racal sa totoong buhay sa mga karakter na ginagampanan niya. Sobrang believable niya as an actress. In my opinion, this is direk tonet’s best work to date. Her magnum opus so far. Also, jennica garcia is truly a fucking star. She owned every scene she had.

Sunshine,"THISSS IS CINEMAAAA U GUYS (YAS, edited w/ a short commentary)what i love about sunshine is it never tries to sell the idea that motherhood is innate, pure, or noble. instead, it asks the real question paano kung ayaw talaga? and it’s so bold to center that lalo na sa context ng pilipinas where everything about being a woman is reduced to sacrifice.we’re raised to believe na ang katawan natin ay para sa pamilya, para sa pananampalataya, para sa kinabukasan ng iba. never para sa sarili. kaya sobrang rare and sobrang radical makakita ng pelikula na nagsasabing ""hindi mo kailangang gustuhin. hindi mo kailangang magpaka-martir.”sunshine understands na abortion is not some abstract “debate” about morality. it’s lived. it’s embodied. it’s desperate. and it doesn’t look away from that. it shows us what women are actually left with when they’re denied safe and legal options. instructions sa papel, gamot na walang label, pangambang baka mamatay ka sa proseso. it doesn’t sensationalize it, but it doesn’t sanitize it either. and that’s where the power lies.the film knows the violence doesn’t start when a woman decides to abort. it starts when the state tells her she can’t. when even in the face of trauma, poverty, or kahit simpleng “hindi ko kaya"" o ""ayoko,"" the answer is always “wala tayong magagawa."" sunshine sits with that anger. nire-recognize niya na ang lack of choice ay isa lang sa napakaraming anyo o mukha ng systemic violence. patunay ito of how the law protects an imagined morality while punishing the actual living woman.and yes, this film is very aware that class makes all the difference. hindi lahat may access to private clinics or doctors willing to take the risk. karamihan, kung hindi lahat, gaya sa pelikula ay sa quiapo ang bagsak. o kaya naman hilot. 'yung iba wala talagang means & are forced to be victims of the way laws, culture, and religion collude to trap women into roles they never asked for. and that matters. because the way we talk about abortion in this country is always so detached from those realities. laging hypothetical. laging abstract. laging nakadikit sa spiritual na paniniwala. but sunshine shows that for many women, hindi lang siya tungkol sa pagkakaroon ng choice o sa moralidad kundi buhay at kaligtasan din nila mismo. literal na tinatanggalan sila ng basic human rights. ang sarap himayin ng pelikulaaa especially 'yung subplot tungkol doon sa 13-yr old girl tapos isampal 'yun sa mukha ng mga taong hindi magawang ilabas ang sarili nila sa personal nilang mga baluktot na paninindigan.ig the best part for me is how sunshine never tries to justify. likeee it doesn’t go “look, she had no choice,” or “she’s a victim, kaya understandable.” no. it says na kahit may support ka, kahit privilege ka, kahit hindi ka biktima, may karapatan kang pumili. and that, for me, is what makes it a GREAT feminist film. hindi siya nakikiusap sa audience na intindihin si sunshine. it tells you, plainly, na she owes you nothing.and maybe the most haunting part of this film is how it visualizes the weight of that decision. hindi bilang guilt or punishment but as memory. the film doesn’t erase the what-if. it shows you that even when a choice is right, it doesn’t come clean or easy. and that doesn’t make it wrong.FKK SOBRANG GALING LANG !!",2025-07-28,positive,0.9372338056564331,1

Sunshine,"A sunshine of hope in the dark, conservative alleys of Manila.This is a film that tackles what we Filipinos mostly shame women for: abortion. In this film, we see how the patriarchal society has a chokehold on our women. Men continue to crush the dreams of women, whether through abandoning them (ehem Miggy), ruining them (ehem Bobot), and deciding for their future (ehem Pastor Jaime).But not Sunshine.Despite everything, she persisted. She never gave up. Her trials and eventual triumphs gave a nice contrast to the setting: the dark alleyways of Quiapo. In the desolate streets, there she is continuing to shine. And can I just say, sobrang galing ni Maris! She really did justice in portraying the character. Additionally, I’d also like to commend Annika Co in her portrayal of the bata. Superb, she has potential! Her character is like an annoying voice of reason for Sunshine. Pero grabe, naluha ako in the end sa scene nilang dalawa.And Rhed Bustamante too as Mary Grace. Despite a short screen time, I felt that she was the soul of the movie. Through her, we saw how Sunshine comes to realize her fight for her dreams. Mary Grace was the bridge that Sunshine crossed to eventually come to her decision of persisting with her goals. I also liked how the women in the film supported each other. Thea, despite her mother not allowing her to hang out with Sunshine, showed up in the end. Coach Eden, who helped Sunshine realize her dreams. Her sister Geleen, who strongly supported her in every way. This film is an ode to women, and tackles an issue that should really be talked about more.",2025-07-28,positive,0.9925340414047241,9

Sunshine,"Sunshine tried to open a discussion about a topic rarely talked about in the Philippines -- and in that aspect, I think it was already a success.For it to be played in Philippine cinemas is already a win for the film, on top of the other awards it has received abroad. In terms of the technical aspects, I liked how the film showed the beauty of Manila despite its flaws, how graceful rhythmic gymnastics look like despite being a tough sport, and how the venues mostly used in the film had enough space needed despite being cramped.Story-wise, I like how it tackled the problems of the Philippines in terms of reproductive health, but also showed the pro of being a mother -- or at least having a mother figure by your side. However, while I understand why Sunshine made that decision, I think it somehow lacked that oomph on why she was eventually convinced to do IT. What happened after THE TALK? Still, I believe Sunshine should be watched by many. Sunshine shows that one may be in a dark situation, but if you stand your ground and believe in what's best for you, then you know how or where to find the light.",2025-07-28,positive,0.9957460761070251,1

Sunshine,"A lot has already been said about this film—timely, important, brave. Sunshine is not great just because it tackles abortion, it welcomely invites us to be with its titular character. Every scene we are with her, and no scene is wasted. We know she got big dreams, and it's all she's ever known. We feel her despair, anger, and the facade through her smile. We see her make bad choices, but we understand why.I've seen a similar film in 2020, US's Never Rarely Sometimes Always. What sets Sunshine apart is it is set in the Philippines, a predominantly Catholic country. From the moment Sunshines wants to know about her status, judgment has already been cast upon her. People around her treat her as if she's some sort of contagious disease. Institutions, who are supposed to provide help, condemns her and gives a long-ass speech as if they're god. Yet, she finds a glimpse of hope in the most unlikely of places.Direk Tonet has proven to be one of the most versatile and essential modern directors in the Philippines. From her indie roots to her modern take of romcoms, she consistently has made semi-blockbuster memorable Filipino films. In her shift to sociopolitical drama, which already started in Fan Girl (2020), her voice as a female writer-director is clearer than ever. Hearing the germ of idea for this film got me intrigued, inspired from Jojo Rabbit (2019). At first, I was skeptical of this borrowed plot device, but it completely won me over and elevated the film in the end. Manila is captured as pure as it is. The score is played at the right moments, and so did pure silence.And of course, Maris Racal, the heart of this film. A year of training and research for the character paid off. She is Sunshine through and through! Her in that motel scene is raw and chilling to say the least. All the supporting actors and bit roles are just as great and gives life to Sunshine's world. Jennica Garcia may have a few lines, but her performance especially in that scene with Maris is one to be remembered for, especially for teenage mothers. A surprising yet worthy appearance comes from Rhed Bustamante, whose minor role made a huge impact on me—I cried!Sunshine is such a lightning in a bottle kind of Filipino film. Who would have thought that a great indie pinoy film about abortion is getting this high amount of traction and success? One's hope is for this to create discussion among us and to move the needle systemically for girls like Sunshine. (And as a cinephile, I hope more films like this get produced and be seen by Filipinos, because Philippine Cinema has always been alive!)",2025-07-24,positive,0.9918980598449707,1

Sunshine,"Hopefully, this movie sparks the much-needed conversation. Time for the Filipinos to open their minds. Your beliefs are your own, but they shouldn’t hinder others from exercising their rights. Making abortion illegal doesn’t make it go away — it only puts women’s lives at greater risk.Also, of course, hands down to Maris Racal. She portrayed her character really well.And kudos to Direk Tonet for creating such a brave film in a country as close minded as the Philippines.

Sunshine,"Courageous. This is how I would describe the film. The way it speaks to and for society, portrays women's experiences, and challenges the pre-existing notions— the societal pressures, religious guilt, patriarchal norms—all were executed perfectly.One thing that I can't seem to stop thinking about is the personification of Sunshine's troubles. Some said it could be her conscience, maybe her guilt, maybe it's also the pressures society had brought upon women experiencing the same struggle, but I personally saw it as the personification of the child inside her. Kasi as a pregnant woman, one of the top things that she's probably considering the most would be the child (since it has been embeded into us that the child has a life as soon as it's formed). Ang galing lang kasi talaga ng portrayal na 'to and it keeps my mind gears churning. And that 'gets ko na'… I BAWLED.Sunshine is also one of the movies na mayroong ibang level of understanding yung mga babae, e no? A man could watch this and empathize, pero iba yung dating ng pelikulang ito lalo na sa mga babae sa Pilipinas. I would really only trust movies about women to women. Props to DIrek Tonet for this, really.Listing the things I love abt the movie here too!- Sunshine and the women she encountered…- Ang galing nung mga bata at ni Rhed tangina!!!???? - basagin ang ulo ng mga rapist >>>> magbasag ng bote sa ulo ng rapist- I have a lot more kaso my short term memory can't write it now because I'm logging this days late UGH.But It feels really freeing to see this kind of story sa theater, with a broader audience. Salamat sa matapang na pagbitaw ng mga salitang ""Ayaw kong maging nanay"" at ""Hindi pa ako handang maging nanay"" sa harap ng bansang ang tingin ay ito lang dapat ang kahihinatnan ng kababaihan. Oo, motherhood is great, but it's not for all of us— especially for ones who are forced into it.Para sa pangarap, buhay, at kaligtasan— Isulong natin ang karapatan ng kabataan at kababaihan! No to Abuse, Harassment, and Teenage Pregnancy!Yes to Reproductive Health Awareness! Decriminalize abortion!Hayaan nating magdesisyon ang bawat babae para sa kanilang katawan dahil ito ay kanila, at kanila lamang. #ProChoice :)",2025-07-26,positive,0.989953875541687,1

Sunshine,"It is refreshing to see such a brave filmmaker like Antoinette Jadaone take on such a taboo topic as this, and despite its obvious flaws, there is so much to be celebrated about ""Sunshine"". Her depiction of realist Manila within a predominantly Catholic albeit judgmental Philippines is strikingly affecting, and the first half of this in particular is a worthy showcase of great filmmaking. The plot device did take me out of the film from time to time, and I do not think it was necessary nor was it effective. Yet, what more can you ask for when you have such a riveting turn from Maris Racal, who puts forward a performance for the ages. Those around her are also excellent, particularly Jennica Garcia, who embodies so much heart and emotion in the little scenes that she is in. Could this have been a better film? Yes. But is it one that is worth seeing? Absolutely.[Watched at SM Mall of Asia cinemas]",2025-07-28,positive,0.9959056377410889,1
Sunshine,"“drown out the noise.”easier said than done when the noise is everything.the streets of Maynila. the train. the coach. the prayers. the stares. the guilt.Sunshine isn’t just a film about a girl with Olympic dreams and an unplanned pregnancy. it’s about how loud the world gets when you’re no longer allowed to dream. the kind of noise that follows you into cramped maternity wards, judgmental glances, and conversations that aren’t even about you, but your body.it’s claustrophobic — not just visually, but emotionally. the tight shots mimic how it feels to be backed into a corner: by family, religion, institutions, and the echo of “what will people say?” that never stops ringing. there’s no space to move. no time to think. just pressure.this is a strong film. one that dares to confront the Philippines’ obsession with purity, shame, and control. it pulls back the curtain on a country where reproductive health is taboo. it also shows the quiet fear around abortion — how it’s never really said out loud, but always there, hiding under the surface. a real choice that girls are never allowed to make. where the system will preach “life is sacred,” but give you a plastic chair in an overcrowded ward and leave you to figure it out alone.sure, it plays it safe sometimes — there are parts where you wish it pushed a little more. but it still says a lot, even in quiet moments.Sunshine doesn’t claim to have all the answers. but it knows the questions that need to be asked.about bodily autonomy. about access to care. about what it really means to grow up in a place that punishes girls for being girls.APAKAHUSAY NYO MS TONET AT MARIS!",2025-07-28,positive,0.9779788851737976,-1

Sunshine,"Watching Sunshine wasn’t just watching a movie. Parang I was sitting beside a woman, listening to her story ng tahimik lang, pero sobrang bigat. It’s not easy to watch, but that’s exactly why it felt so real. What hit me the most was how the film didn’t try to be loud or preachy. The film doesn’t try to romanticize or a free promotion for abortion. It just let the silence do the work. Minsan iyak lang, minsan wala talagang salita. That makes it more powerful. Hindi ito simpleng kwento. It’s about pain, dreams, and mga choices na hindi talaga madaling pagpilian.Pero I have to say, may parts na medyo kulang for me. Sana mas dark yung cinematography, like Khalel 15 — gritty and raw. Lastly, hindi ito movie para sa lahat. But still, Sunshine gives us something real.

Sunshine,"Mula pa lang sa trailer, alam ko na—hindi ko puwedeng palampasin ang pelikulang ito. Direk Tonet ‘yan, eh. May tiwala ako sa kakayahan niyang gawing matula ang trahedya, at gawing tahimik pero mabigat ang mga sigaw ng kababaihan sa lipunang laging inuuna ang hiya kaysa sa hustisya.Isa sa mga personal na dahilan kung bakit ako nanood ay dahil gusto kong unawain—hindi man buo, pero kahit konti—kung ano ang dinadala ng isang babaeng katulad ni Sunshine. Bilang isang assigned male at birth, pero hindi ganap na komportable sa label na iyon, alam kong may distansya sa pagitan namin ni Sunshine. Pero iyon mismo ang dahilan kung bakit ako nanahimik sa sinehan. Tumigil akong mag-analisa, at hayaan ang pelikula na magsalita para sa sarili nito. Hindi ko kailangang maging babae para makiramay. Pero gusto kong makiramdam. At dito, sa pelikulang ito, nagtagumpay akong maramdaman si Sunshine—ang kanyang pagkalito, galit, at takot—na para bang sarili kong laman-loob ang kinikiskis ng eksena.At sa prosesong iyon, nadama ko si Sunshine—ang pagkalito niya na hindi simpleng pagkaligaw, kundi paglalakad sa isang landas na sinabihan siyang bawal. Ang galit niyang hindi mapagsigawan, at ang takot niyang hindi inamin, pero nandoon sa bawat kumpas ng katawan niya. Maris Racal didn’t just play Sunshine—she inhabited her. She carried her, as if every scene weighed heavily on her spine, even when she stood upright. May mga eksena na walang dialogue pero mas mabigat pa sa sigawan. At doon ko nakita ang mastery ni Maris bilang aktres: ang kakayahang magsalita gamit ang pananahimik.Nakakatawang may nagsabi raw sa likod ng kamera na “haggard” siya habang nagsu-shoot. I laughed—not because it’s funny, but because it’s too real. Ganito talaga ang hitsura ng kabataang babae na araw-araw tinatanggihan ang mundo, pero hindi puwedeng mapagod. May mga Sunshine sa Quiapo, sa mga post sa Reddit, sa mga comments na deleted, sa mga babae sa jeep na tahimik lang pero may bitbit na kwento. And it takes a film like Sunshine to remind us: they are not voiceless. We just haven’t been listening.Unang tingin kay Annika, iisipin mong comic relief siya. Isang batang gumugulo sa eksena, parang pang-balanse sa bigat ng naratibo. Pero habang tumatagal, na-realize kong siya pala ang pinakamatining sa lahat. Hindi siya ordinaryong karakter—siya ang konsensya ni Sunshine. Hindi ang moralistic kind, but the invasive kind. Yung konsensyang hindi laging tama o mali, kundi nagtatanong: “Nasaan ka na?” “Handa ka ba?” “Ito ba ang gusto mong piliin?” At dahil hindi laging consistent ang paglitaw niya—minsan parang guni-guni, minsan parang totoo—mas naging epektibo siya. Kasi hindi ba ganoon din ang konsensya? It creeps in when you're alone. It arrives uninvited. In a country where abortion is taboo, Annika becomes more than a person—she’s a presence. A question. A symbol of possibility and loss, but not in a way that condemns. She’s not there to judge Sunshine, but to make us feel what it means to carry a choice you can’t share with anyone. Sa isang bansang ang moralidad ay naka-template mula sa pulpito, ang pagkakaroon ng karakter tulad ni Annika is radical. Hindi siya plot device. Isa siyang reimaginasyon ng konsensya—hindi para ipahiya ang babae, kundi ipaalala kung gaano kabigat ang dalahin sa lipunang pilit silang pinatatahimik..Ang Sunshine ay hindi pelikulang pro-choice dahil gusto nitong makipagtalo. Hindi rin ito pelikula tungkol sa abortion dahil gusto nitong mag-skandalo. Ito ay pelikula tungkol sa karapatan. Sa kakayahang pumili, kahit pa masakit ang pagpiling iyon. Sunshine doesn’t celebrate abortion—it honors the courage to face it. Sa lipunang ang kababaihan ay kailangang laging malinis, laging mabait, laging matino, heto ang isang pelikulang nagsasabing: ang katawan mo ay hindi kasalanan. Ang pagpili mo ay hindi dapat katumbas ng pagkapako.Maraming salamat, Direk Tonet. Salamat sa hindi pag-ikot sa ligtas na naratibo. Salamat sa pagbibigay ng boses sa katahimikan. Salamat sa paghubog ng pelikulang hindi lang para sa kababaihan, kundi para sa lahat ng gustong matutong makinig.Bilang isang lalaki na walang MATRES, pero may malasakit sa mga may isa, ramdam ko ang urgency ng kwento. Sunshine is not a perfect film—but it is a vital one. And in a country that rarely gives women room to speak, a film like this doesn’t just feel brave. It feels necessary.",2025-07-28,positive,0.8684080243110657,14
Sunshine,""" Drown out the noise.""This line in the Sunshine struck me after watching the film. Noise is considered as a plot device in the film literally and figuratively. I like how the background music or the noise from the background is used to set the tone and mood of the film especially in scenes where Sunshine is walking or riding a jeep home. Noise in the film can also represent the doubts that fill her while practicing and self-righteous religious people who judge her actions throughout the film.The film is about a gymnast who plans to join the tryouts for the Olympics. However, she receives a result that is unexpectedly pregnant which can hinder her chances in getting in. Maris Racal is great in her role as Sunshine and I think that she embodies the role of a gymnast especially since she tried gymnastics to prepare for her role. There were scenes that were remarkable for me such as when she tries to hit a the mirror of a car after her boyfriend (played by Elijah Canlas) doesn't take responsibility for her pregnancy. I also loved the supporting characters as well. Despite their small roles, they made a mark for me. For instance, Jennica Garcia was impressive in her scenes with Maris Racal as her older sister. You can feel that she defends and protects her sister and stay by her side especially during her revelation that she is pregnant. Xyriel Manabat is no surprise for me since I admire her acting skills since she was a child actress. She is great as Sunshine's best friend. Annika Co, an upcoming child actress, is a scene stealer where she acts as a conscience to Sunshine. She is charming and witty in her role and I think the twist made sense to me in one scene.In addition to it being a sports drama, this film also tackled the themes of women's choice and abortion. These topics are considered sensitive and taboo in a dominant Catholic and conservative society. As a man, this film moved me and realize how hard it is to be a woman in a society wherethey are judged for having an autonomy in their body. In a third world country, healthcare is considered a privilege especially for the poor. Because of abortion being considered illegal and immoral, women are forced to resort to unsafe practices which can endanger them. It is shown in the film and I think it's interesting that it depicted two doctors: one which discriminates women because of her religious bias and one which tried to understand and helped another character in the film who turned to abortion. It's a sad reality, but I'm glad that this film will open conversations about themes like these.Overall, I find Sunshine an impressive film. I think this is Antonette Jadaone's best film so far. It's my second film that I've seen in cinemas and I'm grateful to witness it in the big screen because it is worth the watch there with its immersive experience. I was definitely looking forward to it since it's rare to watch a sports film which centers around gymnastics and it has been shown in film festivals abroad. I was worried that it won't be shown here because of how controversial it would be because of the stand of the Catholic Church and other religious sectors regarding abortion. I guess more people are more open-minded towards the topics unlike before. Aside from the acting, what I found compelling in the film is the cinematography and scoring which adds tension and mood to the it. Despite its limited release and pitted against two superhero films during its premiere, I really hope more people will get a chance to watch this movie. Even if it shows the harsh realities of life and in sports, I agree with other film critics that it also shows hope. There is Sunshine after the rain.",2025-07-28,positive,0.9874756932258606,-1

Sunshine,"No doubt my favorite Jadaone film, Sunshine is not only an important work of art in a cultural context, but an objectively beautiful, clean and concise narrative work. What I mean is not a single frame is wasted, or given up for style points - every decision of performance, framing and pace is made to serve the story, to make us empathize with Sunshine, to feel what she feels.Woman vs the institution - the clarity of this theme is just so powerful, yet we’re brought into Sunshine’s world through masterful camerawork that just feels honest. There’s a shot I love, where Sunshine is framed inside a window (in her room then in a motel), and the chaos of the city goes on about her, uncaring and apathetic to her situation. That’s the whole movie - the slow-burning horror that she is being shunned by society, cramped into tiny spaces trying to survive. It made me cringe to hear the chants of “Pilipinas” by the crowd in her performance at the end (the sad reality of Filipino athletes, unsupported in training yet celebrated in victory)Maris Racal’s best performance. The care and dedication she brought to the role should be applauded. Everyone else in the movie is so dialed in too, a subtle superpower of Direk Tonet’s ear for relatable acting and dialogue. Also love the Pastor P appearance, who brings such an important discussion into the public consciousness. The ultimate boss level: God & practicality vs the woman’s decision.Instant classic!",2025-07-27,positive,0.995896577835083,1
Sunshine,"“Sunshine” gripped my soul and left me hollow with unease. the first ten minutes we follow Sunshine as she drifts aimlessly through the restless streets of Manila, and that’s how the entire film feels. yes, it’s sending a message, but watching her spiral felt almost voyeuristic, as if we were witnessing something intimate and illegal. no propaganda, just raw, heartbreaking truth.and as much as i hate comparing directors, the rawness of each frame felt deeply “Brocka” but captured through the tenderness and gaze of a woman. at the film’s core is Maris Racal, exceptional in her quiet nuance, supported beautifully by Jennica Garcia.this film will linger with me for days. it’s about the cruelty of the world, the ache of aspirations, the fragile hope for a better life, and, ultimately, a woman’s choice.And at the center of it all, I love when a woman chooses herself.",2025-07-28,positive,0.9899216294288635,1

Sunshine,"""gets ko na""a moment in this film that really struck me was the last scene with sunshine and her almost child — that could've been me to my mom. my parents were teenagers when they had me, and my mom told me na she tried buying pamparegla from quiapo before, but her parents stopped her saying it was a horrendous sin kay Lord. if she had chosen to live her life without me existing, i would thank her for it. gets na gets ko siya. i hope this film will successfully convey its message to the viewers, and serve as an eye-opener for those who believe that a woman doesn't have a choice.rhed bustamante's character as a 13-year old who was sa'd by her tito reflects the reality of a lot of women — girls even, cause she's not even an adult yet. abortion being illegal in the philippines doesn't stop people from doing it, hence it leads them to doing it in a horrifying and deadly way. pamparegla pills and hilot are ways people resort to because of abortion being inaccessible here in our country. tapos nung na-ospital siya hindi pa ginamot? tangina talaga ng mga lalaki! thank you dra. helena for your life!to all anti-abortion out there, i hope this film reaches you. if it's not convenient for you, then okay, but at least think about those who really need it. overall, this film is such a great commentary on how women aren't always meant to be mothers, and that one failure won't ever stop you from reaching your dreams. to all sunshine's out there, kapit lang :))",2025-07-29,positive,0.9800831079483032,-1

Sunshine,"SUNSHINE advances itself as a film about bodily autonomy in a nation that denies its very terminology, yet it does so through the insulated idiom of psychological realism rather than the concretised mapping of the material conditions that make autonomy, abortion, and girlhood existentially precarious. We are immersed in affect, but the structure underpinning these sensations is left either ambient or altogether unrendered. Yes, the pharmacy exists as a moral space and the hospital as carceral, but where is the livelihood? Who funds the training? What does it mean, materially, to be a 19-year-old athlete—and an international one, at that—with no visible labouring parent and no bread line to back it up?Abortion is outlawed in the Philippines because it preserves state-church power and results in the reproductive labour of the poor as exploitable and their agency criminal, but to bracket class from the narrative—in a context where economic vulnerability is the foremost determinant of reproductive injustice—is consequential. Instead, the endless deferral into mood, while expressive, is in itself a seductive alibi for political disengagement. I understand that this is a film of interiority—that the point is to reflect Sunshine’s constrained perceptual field—but her interiority is a response to economic realities that the film chooses to elude, and when the audience is asked to interpolate systemic weight from ambience without any clear depiction of how deprivation functions, what we get is an abstraction that parades as empathy, and from that abstraction, other evasions proliferate: the neoliberal myth of the meritocratic athlete, whose suffering must be understood as psychological strain rather than as infrastructural abandonment; the convenient fiction that ambition alone propels a body through state-sponsored regimes without subsidy or the material realities the film forgoes. To abstract oppression into psychic distress then, while refusing its logistical origins, is to risk reproducing the same symbolic economy the Church relies upon: one in which the body is meaningful only as a metaphor and a vessel onto which morality is projected.This aesthetic disposition of interiority is of course obviously a structure inherited from the exportable idiom of European festival realism where the trauma of the Filipina is depicted legibly for the global North. From this perspective, it would make sense that the institutions that manufacture her precarity are rendered as emotional rather than historical, inviting the audience to feel with her but never to account—but by doing so, what emerges is not so much a Filipino film but a Filipino offering: an artefact of pain rendered in tones familiar to jurors abroad, a choice that aligns seamlessly with both (1) Jadaone’s career pivot into the international circuit, having premiered the film at Berlinale and TIFF, and (2) the film’s own final sequence: Sunshine performing her routine at the SEA games before a panel of foreign adjudicators, body taut and calibrated for approval by those who will never understand the weight of what she forfeited to arrive there. By naming these two parallels do we metabolise the rage of a system into something palatable and interpretable, and since both Jadaone and Sunshine must contort to be seen, in being seen, they are asked to become less what they mean. Perhaps the question is not whether SUNSHINE fails as a film or recedes as an offering, but whether it was ever permitted the autonomy to be anything else—whether within the landscape of Philippine cinema, where funding is precarious, distribution systems anaemic, and state culture support present only for the films that do not threaten it, a film like SUNSHINE must already enter the frame pre-legibilised and pre-digested, its rage ironed out for export. This is, after all, by the admission of its own producer Bianca Balbuena, a film that delayed its domestic release in order ‘to premiere in top festivals [around] the world to create noise and curiosity’, with the implication that only through international approval could the film attain enough value to justify its own existence at home. Thus, to resist the very circuit that enables its existence is impossible, but recognising this sharpens our understanding of the conditions under which those evasions occur. What we must ask, then, is what kind of complicity we are willing to forgive in a nation that punishes truth so severely that even its cinema must contort just to be heard.",2025-07-28,positive,0.7755416035652161,1

Sunshine,"Quiapo has always felt like a contradiction. It's a district that thrives on both holiness and hustle, tradition and survival, all crammed into claustrophobic, identical alleyways. At its heart stands a towering church, surrounded by vendors selling everything: street food, religious images, herbal medicines, fake documents, sex toys, and abortion kits – pamparegla. The irony writes itself. And yet, that's where people are forced to go when they're desperate. Like Sunshine.Sunshine (Maris Racal) is a gymnast on the rise who discovers she's pregnant before a major competition – just as her future starts to tighten around her. The plot is simple, but never small. What unfolds is a slow, steady panic of a young woman trying to figure things out in a country that offers her no real choices. You feel the weight that she's carrying, not just in her silence, but in her body. She's holding so much in, almost willing it all to be a fever dream. But beneath that restraint is a quiet rage — in her posture, in her breath, in the way she fights to keep it all together.The movie doesn't try to frame anything as heroic or tragic, and that's what makes it powerful. What stood out most to me was how angry, how fearless, it allows itself to be. It simmers. Controlled, but with crushing intensity. This is Direk Tonet's best work to date. It's her most honest and her most focused. And you can tell she did this with immense care. The love is in the details.",2025-07-24,positive,0.9707272052764893,-1

Sobrang raw, sobrang totoo at sobrang tapang ni direk tonet sa paggawa ng gantong pelikula na sana marami pa ang makapanood. Also, the performance of THE Maris Racal. Dalang dala nya ang emosyon ng manonood, the rage, pain, and bravery of Sunshine. Isa sa talagang nagpa agos ng luha ko ay ang eksena na sumasayaw sya, nakangiti pero ramdam mo ang bawat emosyon. Grabe ang scene na yun, walang dialogue pero tagos sa puso!! It was really indeed the best performance of her. And that ending, i love how direk tonet didnt show what happens to the unborn child, and pinakita na lang na nakaabot sya sa competition, it just shows na ang pagkakaroon ng choice ay magsasalba sa mga pangarap na minsan ng kinain ng sistema ng bansang ito. Gets na gets kita, Sunshine bago ko pa ito panoorin at sana magets ka na rin nila.Ginawa ang pelikula na to hindi lang para sa mga babae, ginawa ito para ipakita sa mga taong hindi nakakaintindi ang reyalidad ni Sunshine.

Sunshine,"This film gives you the opportunity to judge Sunshine & her decision-making as she deals with the consequences of an act she did not commit alone yet had to face entirely by herself. Dahil sa sistema at mga paniniwalang hindi pabor sa mga kababaihan.After watching, you might say “gets ko na” as you start to understand how they feel & where they’re coming from. Unfortunately, that’s only the tip of the iceberg. You must also imagine the lives of all other Sunshines out there whose stories remain unheard and unseen. In the real world setting, you no longer have access to every woman’s story. But through Sunshine, you gain something just as important: empathy and understanding. And maybe— just maybe— hindi naman matatapakan ang pagkatao mo if you simply allow women the freedom to decide for their own lives.

They peel back the shame, the fear, the silence.Kaya habang nanonood ako, ang tanong ko na hindi ko na matiis:Hanggang kailan magiging krimen ang pagpili para sa sariling katawan?Hanggang kailan natin ipagkakait ang dignidad ng babae sa gitna ng pagdurusa?",2025-07-29,positive,0.8680629730224609,1

Sunshine,"mahal kita, sunshine! at mahal na mahal ko kayo, direk tonet, maris racal, at lahat ng mga babaeng naging parte ng kwentong ito! [4:46AM] iba yung alam mo lang, sa naiintindihan mo talaga. staying informed is one thing, but feeling it? letting it crack something open in you? ibang usapan ‘yon.alam kong masama ang aborsyon sa mata ng simbahan. lumaki akong alam 'yon; itinuro, inulit, pinaniwalaan. alam ko rin kung paano siya tinitignan ng lipunan, ng batas, ng sistemang matagal nang hindi pumapanig sa kababaihan. isang sistemang feudal, patriyarkal, mapanghusga. pinalaki tayo rito, pinalo, pinatahimik.pero alam ko rin ito: may karapatan ang babae. sa sarili niyang katawan. sa sarili niyang desisyon. at sa healthcare na hindi dapat ipinagmamakaawa, kundi kusang ibinibigay. alam ko rin na hindi dapat tinitingnan ang aborsyon sa lente ng kasalanan o krimen, na para bang awtomatikong mali ang pagpili, at masama ang pumipili. pero ang hindi ko alam, ang hindi ko kailanman mararanasan sa ganap na paraan, ay kung ano ang pakiramdam. ang bumangon araw-araw dala ang bigat ng isang desisyong walang tama sa paningin ng lahat. ang labanan hindi lang ang sarili mong konsensya, kundi ang mundong hindi kailanman kinilala ang pinagdadaanan mo, ang takot mo, ang dahilan mo.yun ang hindi ko alam. at yun ang pinaramdam sa akin ng Sunshine.and i think that's where Sunshine really succeeds. it doesn’t glorify. it doesn’t argue. it simply shows. it gives us a glimpse. into a life of a young woman, into her choice, into her pain, and the kind of quiet strength we rarely talk about. gusto lang talaga ng pelikula magkuwento tungkol sa isang babae. ang dami kong gustong himayin. but if there’s one thing that stayed with me, it’s this: Sunshine gives voice to stories we rarely hear. and maybe we avoid them kasi nga masakit. mabigat. kasi hindi tanggap ng kultura at sistemang kinalakihan natin. uncomfortable. but that’s exactly why they need to be told.what makes the film powerful is how intentional it is. every frame, every silence, every turn it didn’t take. lahat may dahilan. it could’ve been more clever. it could’ve been more dramatic. pero hindi siya nagpakitang gilas. instead, ginamit niya ‘yung simplicity para tumama. para magpa-reflect. para magpa-isip.what i appreciated most was that it didn’t force me to take a side. it didn’t try to tell me which choice was right, no matter what sunshine ended up deciding. it just asked me to listen. to sit with sunshine. to be there with her. even when things were loud & messy, even when she herself didn’t know what to do. and sometimes, that’s all people need. not answers. just space. and empathy. maraming empathy. Sunshine moved me to empathize in ways i didn’t expect i could.gusto ko rin pala i-highlight kung paano naging karakter ang maynila rito. magulo ang maynila. marumi. maingay. minsan bitag, pero minsan daan palabas. minsan parang impyerno, pero minsan parang tanging lugar na may pag-asa. sunshine moved through its chaos looking for clarity, and somehow the city mirrored her confusion. klaustro ang mga eskinita pero may mga puwang. noisy yet full of silences. manila is hysterically cruel, yes. brutal sa babae, sa mahirap, sa pagod. pero sa likod ng lahat ng ‘yon, may mga sulok na mabait. tahimik. marunong makinig. may tenderness na hindi nagpapakita, pero nandiyan; in the people who care quietly, in the moments of stillness in between the noise.and god, maris. maris fucking racal. this is hers. this is every woman’s story. she is a woman in every way that matters. alam kong magaling na siya dati pa. nakita ko na rin naman ang ibang trabaho niya. but this time, iba. masarap sa pakiramdam na makita ang isang magaling na babae na hindi nakakabit sa loveteam, walang lalaking bitbit sa screen para lang matawag na lead. walang kilig, walang branding. sakanya lang talaga ito. and that felt right. that felt important.the way she portrayed sunshine’s pain and stillness and quiet strength, it just hit. hindi siya umaarte. she wasn’t trying to convince anyone. she just was. may mga eksena na wala siyang sinasabi, pero ramdam mo lahat. nakakaiyak siya, pero hindi dahil may music o linyang mabigat. nakakaiyak kasi totoo. kasi hindi mo alam kung saan ka huhugot ng ginhawa sa pinagdadaanan niya.totoong haggard nga siya buong palabas hahaha, and it just made so much sense. ganun talaga ang itsura ng babae na napagod na. sa sarili. sa mundo. sa kakaisip ng tama. sa sistema na walang binibigay na sagot. and yet she kept going. and yet she was still trying. that look—the mess, the confusion, the exhaustion, that’s what a woman in the middle of a fight looks like. not dramatic. just human.maris, sa’yo talaga ito. no one else could’ve done it this way. no one can take this away from you. and i hope alam mo kung gaano kahalaga ang binigay mo sa pelikulang ‘to.and the women around sunshine, sila rin ang puso ng kwento. sa mata pa lang ng bawat isa, kita mo agad. hindi sila filler. hindi sila background. si jennica garcia, si annika co, si xyriel manabat, atbp. pati yung mga sandaling lumitaw lang, ang doktor, ang bantay sa motel, yung pharmacist sa botika, yung babae sa quiapo, maski yung mga babae sa maternity ward. lahat sila may dala. lahat sila may pinanggagalingan. and they all stood with sunshine in one way or another. iba-iba sila, pero iisa ng tinig. kababaihan ang nagdala ng pelikula. kababaihan ang gumising sa kwento.Sunshine isn’t easy to watch, especially if you're a woman in this country— but maybe it’s not meant to be. kasi tunay na kwento siya. and real stories don’t always comfort. they challenge. they disturb. they demand something from you. and that’s what this film did. it made me feel. it made me think.sobrang ganda napasulat tlg ako ng review. i had to sit with it for an hour or two. ang husay mo direk tonet!",2025-07-29,positive,0.5518777966499329,12

Sunshine,"“My body, my choice.” But is it really when your options of what you can do with it is stuck in a country overtaken by religion and politics stuck in the medieval times? Sunshine falls under one of my most favorite genres: social commentary by simply showing girls just trying to live. You can see throughout the film that she’s just a girl. Asking Miggy for money, asking for help when she needs, acts on her impulse, has dreams and goals, using twitter and Reddit for research (#real), etc. She knows she can’t take care of a whole ass child right now, all she can (and she should) do is to chase her dreams and make a career out of it.Though you can also see that Sunshine doesn’t really hate the kid. She takes care of her the way she can– giving her money to get home, looking for her when she’s lost, protects her from adult themes (drinking, abortion, etc). So her decision at the end, it’s not because she hates the kid, it’s because she loves herself. With the limited choices she had, she made the most out of her youth And what’s so wrong with that?

Sunshine,"women carries the weight of the world the moment they were born 'no? a woman that chooses herself has a lot of implications that makes them look selfish.this film is consistently tight, not making moments linger a second longer than it should be. it places urgency to sunshine's situation and i just love how sunshine has full autonomy and gets right to it the moment that she knew. admittedly, a certain plot device employed here might've become a burden in the long run, there's a moment where it felt like the film doesn't know what to do with it, but in the end it still landed pretty well. jadaone throws a lot of anger in this film. an exasperation to the tito bubots of this world, to the judgmental people who's supposed to make you feel safe, to the system that prohibits women to have safer options, but never to sunshine. what might this film's great achievement is that you feel it too, the film carefully takes you on a walk to make you understand and feel its anger, to understand sunshine, just how much important her dreams are and how she doesn't aspire to be a mother in this time of her life. women carries the weight of the world the moment they were born, but people like sunshine makes it feel that choosing themselves is an act to be truly selfless and for once be free",2025-07-24,positive,0.9852993488311768,-1

Sunshine,"Direk Tonet knows exactly when to let silence speak, when to drown out the noise, and when to let emotions simmer. In Sunshine, she invites us into Sunshine’s mental and bodily struggles, but leaves just enough space for the character’s autonomy and our own. While some films impose what should or shouldn’t be, Sunshine deliberately resists the impulse to moralize— and does so with intention. Instead, it evokes. It urges us to feel and think through its subtlety. Jadaone’s placement of Sunshine’s body within the harshness of Manila is a political act. To know Sunshine, then, is to know the spaces that both suffocate and shelter her.The film doesn’t offer easy answers (or any at all), but that’s precisely what makes it resonate and linger.",2025-07-29,positive,0.9301810264587402,1

Shout-out to Paolo Orendain's austere cinematography, Eero Yves Francisco's oppressive production design, Benjamin Tolentino's laser-sharp editing, and Vincent Villa's absorbing sound design.

Sunshine,"The film confronts the harsh realities of teenage pregnancy, abortion, and even the challenges faced by athletes in the Philippines. With abortion being illegal here in the Philippines, many women resort to dangerous methods that put their lives at risk. The movie also highlights how men often evade accountability for such situations, leaving women to bear the heavy burden alone. It sheds light on the prevalent issue of unwanted pregnancies, a reality that is sadly common here. The film emphasizes the powerful influence of religion in shaping societal norms. Overall, it’s a bold and honest portrayal of women's struggles, particularly in a country deeply shaped by religion and patriarchal values. Kudos to Maris Racal and Antoinette Jadaone! Truly a well-deserved win. ",2025-07-29,positive,0.989194393157959,9
Sunshine,"Hindi lamang ito pag-uusapan dahil sa kontrobersyal nitong paksa—humihikayat din siyang mapag-usapan. Nasa isang lipunan tayo na sobrang layo pa sa usaping abortion, at ang isang pelikulang katulad ng Sunshine (2025) ay paniguradong magbibigay liwanag—hindi lang sa usaping abortion—kundi sa usapin din kung paano gamitin ng lipunan ang relihiyon at pulitika para diktahan kung ano ang dapat at hindi dapat gawin ng kababaihan sa sari-sarili nilang mga katawan. Baka maging susunod na presidente ng pilipinas o baka makahanap ng gamot sa aids, oo. Pero paano naman si Sunshine, na isinasang tabi ang karapatan, na para bang pinuputulan niyo ng pakpak makalipad. Paano naman si Sunshine, na mas mataas ang potensyal—National teams, SEA Games, kahit maging sa Olympics pa.Lumabas ako sa sinehan at naririnig ko ang kanya-kanyang diskurso ng mga nanood. Positibo at negatibo. Kesyo gino-glorify ang abortion, kesyo sumusuporta sa mga desisyon ni Sunshine. Ano man ang reaksyon at opinyon nila patungkol sa pelikulang ito, malaking hakbang pa rin yung mailagay siya sa lamesa para mapag-usapan. Hindi na dapat natin ito pinag-uusapan ng patago, na para bang malaking kasalanan. Buhay at kinabukasan ng babae ang nakasalalay.Kaunting spoiler: sobrang halaga sa akin nung eksena na dumaan muna si Sunshine sa simbahan para humingi ng tawad sa mga desisyong gagawin niya pa lamang. Pinapahalagahan ng pelikula ang usaping abortion pero hindi nito binubura ang aspetong moral ng ganoong gawain. Saka, mahalagang detalye rin sa akin yung naroon lamang siya sa labas ng simbahan at hindi siya pumasok—dahil sa tingin niya ay hindi siya karapat-dapat, dahil iba ang catholic guilt ng bagay na gagawin niya.",2025-07-29,negative,0.5602125525474548,2

She is able to express pain (both physical and internal) in ways that make me writhe with her. I don’t think I’ve wanted to hug a woman through my screen like this in a while.And wow!!! Annika is a star in the making. She impressed me so much in this, especially in the scene where they head to the hospital. It’s definitely a scene that will stick with me for a long time. Jennica’s performance also stuck with me (as a panganay~)Manila is presented so cruel, yet so kind in those moments where Sunshine finds help. I’ve seen a couple of other films talking about abortion in the Philippines (Hinugot sa Langit and 12 Weeks specifically), but I think this one struck me the most. I found this to be extremely nuanced, the presence of the kids and their roles in Sunshine’s life really made me think. I’m still not a hundred percent sure how I feel about their presence, but I appreciate that it made Sunshine’s plight something to really think about.I also appreciated the ending, I think we often see a remorseful side post-abortion for female characters here. But I’m glad we get to see someone who gets to move on and continue to dream, to live.I also thought about the other women I’ve heard about going through similar situations. With how much the world seems to be going backwards, I really hope this piece makes people think about women’s right more here.

Im not sure of the other devices used in this movie but I'm glad we have media that bravely shows a side society tries to push aside. Ang hirap maging babae!!!! We should have better legislation that supports women and children's health and welfare. Whether you choose to be a mom or not, you should be able to carry that out freely and safely.

Sunshine,"watched this movie at a new cinema. new environment & new everything. no connection to the movie at all but i really felt the need to watch this masterpiece asap! so i got out, alone & motivated to push through everything i had set out for the day.my expectations were not disappointed as the movie delivers such a strong message towards the harsh audience which is the Filipino society. everything about the Philippines' secular practices to its contradictions that are laid by the patriarchal nature of the country—it was cruelly portrayed in the movie transparently. that's what i loved about everything that had transpired in the hour and hour-half time i sat in my seat. everything was in color too—something our country is quite known for; though maris racal had played the role of Sunshine, her character had pretty much went through the storms of what seemed to be an unplanned pregnancy that would become her hindrance in achieving her dreams. dreams. something women would always give up once motherhood would grip them by the toes. sad but true, tragic but a reality. yet this film assures women all around that carrying a child—or not, should not be something that would hinder us from reaching for the stars. every scene reminds us, the audience, how motherhood is a gift (unplanned or not), and its something we should carefully discern of before accepting such a blessing. sunshine knows this, she knows it too well to give her baby the life she does not deserve, if they was born with a mother not mature enough to handle the challenges of maternity. moreover, sunshine knew her dreams. her lifetime dream. God knows how much she desired the big stage. as said by Doc Helena, our God is a forgiving god; the statement echoes towards the ending as sunshine weighed out her choices. it was not a matter of letting something go, it was a matter of reaching for something that was always there. ika nga, talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not; and for sunshine, she grabbed the chance. gripped it hard. never letting it out of her touch. and ceased it like it was her last chance—it was. i loved this movie too much. social class, reproductive rights, healthcare, religion, mixed with the right amount of comedy all married into one thought-provoking film. mabuhay ang pelikulang pilipino!",2025-07-29,positive,0.9961112141609192,-1

Sunshine,"mamaya ka sakin may gagawin lang ako saglet Most likely born from Carlos Yulo's gold win in the olympics and the emergence of recent abortion films such as Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Jadaone presents how teenage pregnancies ruins lives and dreams and how the lack of freedom for women in a religion oppressed third world country is a problem as alarming as any other. Although clearly being influenced by recent films tackling similar subject matter 'Sunshine' separates itself from the pack simply because it's set in a country where abortion is illegal. With no abortion clinics and only shady abortion pills how is a teenage woman chasing her dreams let alone a 13 yr old girl raped by her own uncle supposed to reclaim the life that was supposed to be ahead of them. Portraying Manila as a neverending,never resting street filled with people desperate to find whatever they are looking for. How it is a city filled with the kindest people stuck in the most cruel of circumstances. Contradictory to its title the film never shows us a sun that is shining but rather a moon desperate to try and shine on its own despite the world telling her she can never do so alone.",2025-07-29,positive,0.8639654517173767,-1

SOBRANG TALINO! kitang kita sa mata niya yung guilt of even thinking of doing her plans !!! hirap siya to decide between doing what society thinks is right and doing what she thinks is right for herself. her choosing to do the latter does not mean the guilt felt lighter,,, kaya sobrang importante ng personification ni bata dito. for us to see how she’s conflicted with the decision she’s about to make!!! na kahit alam niya what she wans to do, she’s still hindered by the views and beliefs she grew up with!!!ang ganda ng last few minutes ng film. sobrang makatao. sobrang “ahh gets na gets ko siya.” i love na nalet go niya yung guilt, and she chose herself. gets ko si sunshine kasi hindi ko rin kayang ilet go yung pangarap ko, lalo na if pinanghawakan ko na siya simula nung bata ako. yung smile niya nung nilelet go na niya yung guilt felt so heartwarming! kaya sana we’re not too quick to judge other people who is (or has been) in the same situation!!",2025-07-29,positive,0.7975730895996094,-1

Sunshine,"It's decent to say the least, it's a Jadaone movie for Jadaone fans. But that's the thing, it's myopic that it themes and logic of the narrative presented is as only limited as the filmmaker's worldview to say the least, or rather it is limited to how Jadaone sees the subject matter in regards to abortion and having an agency which is told in such a simplistic way, lacking that empathy and how objective it is. However, I commend the script to call out against the prejudiced perception but that's how it is, it did not hold accountable to it, and while Sunshine had conviction to make her decision in the end, and matters in her own hands, it didn't feel unearned to be honest. Like who is Sunshine to the audience, as a main character? Why do the audience should root for her, I think the screenplay failed to make its audience care and thank god Maris Racal made it somehow work because she did put effort to act in those dramatic scenes and it shows she's into that role, kudos for putting an extra work on gymnastic scenes.But in some light hearted scenes, it felt like she didn't convey those emotions that at times it felt monotone. She could've shown a more human and relatable side of Sunshine.It didn't helped that the runtime could've expanded or improve some things that were lacking, but overall the film did ok. Lastly, I have a message to those who are invoking Brocka's name or likening it to the film or the filmmaker: ""keep his name out of your mouth.""",2025-07-29,positive,0.803313136100769,-1

Sunshine,"I love this film. It delivers a powerful message about why the legalization of abortion is important. People get pregnant due to many reasons; not just because they wanted to have sex.If abortion is illegal, then abandoning women after impregnating them or raping them should carry serious legal consequences as well. (oo may serious consequences ang rape pero hindi naman kasi ito binibigyan pansin masyado kaya nga takot mag sumbong ang mga victims meaning HINDI SIYA ENOUGH to scare the rapists)This is a must-watch. An eye-opener for people who prioritize their beliefs over understanding the bigger picture of why women choose illegal abortion despite the risks.Hindi illegal abortion ang sagot. Tamang sex education at ang karapatan ng babae sa sarili nilang katawan ang dapat unahin.",2025-07-29,positive,0.9909936785697937,-1

Sunshine,"This really is a socio-realism film. I honestly get what the other’s say when they said na parang nakukulangan sila sa story but to me it is complete and a great starter conversation for why sex education is really needed for teenagers. Cause let’s be honest most of the teenagers don’t really know what to do, they just mostly learn from what they watch like pornography that will lead up to a lot of teenage pregnancy.And i also like the symbolism doon sa jeep na sinakyan ni sunshine may nakalagay na “Gift of God” while sunshine is thinking of aborting the baby inside her. wala lang its the small details the really make the shotSobrang effective talaga ng pag arte ni Maris Racal like give ko talaga kay ate and also to Jennica Garcia as ate ni Sunshine sobrang.. dalang dala nya talaga ang galing.

Sunshine,"“pasalamat ka kay Papa God.” pasalamat ka para sa sining ng pagpepelikula.madali lang naman mahalin ang pelikulang ito. tulad ng pagmamahal sa mga bagay na pinaniniwalaan at pinaninindigan mo: madali, simple, at walang pag-aalinlangan.there is no doubt that i would love this film effortlessly because the direk tonet jadaone formula never fails in empowering women in their strongest moments; and even more so in their struggles in the fucked up reality of living in a third world country where they are robbed of their freedom to choose.i loved all the little details in sunshine’s home; the subtle reference to problematic people supporting fascists and corrupt politicians; and the way the city of manila is captured in all of its colors, filth, and beauty—showing us familiar roads and alleyways, reminding us of the vibrancy and dullness of the thousands of lives that passed us by.but what struck me the most is the irony of abortion pills being illegally sold where you can buy a statue of Sto. Niño, an image of the Child Jesus who was born from an unplanned pregnancy (albeit God-willed and wholeheartedly accepted by Mary if you’re Catholic). because much like this visual, i do believe that devotion to God and the right to choose for yourself are not mutually exclusive. if you’re using your belief to shun others instead of understanding them, then you’re not living up to your faith.i’ve said it before in past movie reviews—to me, unsafe abortions are the most horrific thing you can show your audience and i’ve seen two other films before, one more vivid than the other. but this one in sunshine is the most painful and depressing. hihilingin mo talaga na sana walang babae sa mundo ang makaranas nito. how can something regarded as the source of life drain the life out of a woman? ang pinakamahirap lunukin na katotohanan ay mayroon at mayroong mga babaeng makakaranas nito kung hindi magkakaroon ng maayos na sex education sa ating mga paaralan at hanggat walang access ang lahat sa reproductive health at safe abortions sa bansa. saludo ako sa tapang mo, direk tonet, to show something no other director of today is not afraid to do so.naniniwala akong ang kababaihan ang pinagmulan ng mundo. quite literally, babae ang nagdala at nagluwal sa ating lahat. kaya maraming salamat sa pelikulang ito dahil nabigyan ng spotlight hindi lang ang mga babaeng tulad ni sunshine at ni mary grace, pero pati na rin ang mga babaeng tulad ng ate ni sunshine, kaibigan niyang si thea, ang kanyang coach eden, si doctor helena, at pati na rin ang babaeng bantay sa avenida inn na walang pag-aatubiling tumulong sa kanya. this is womanhood, ika nga. marahil para sa’yo, ang mga babaeng ito ay iyong ina, ate, kapatid, pinsan, kaibigan o kasintahan. pero isa lang ang sigurado, may mga babae sa buhay nating nagsisilbing kakampi natin sa araw-araw at dapat lang silang bigyang-pugay at pasalamatan.(please stop reading at this point if you don’t want spoilers for the ending!)at first, i thought annika’s character is sunshine’s manifestation of her younger self or her inner child that serves as her conscience in every decision she makes. but when we’re introduced to ariana, it’s finally clear to me that they were sunshine’s manifestation of the unborn babies from her and mary grace’s unwanted pregnancies. this is why that “gets ko na” scene is so powerful! because after relentlessly asking for forgiveness from God for reasons she couldn’t fully understand, she finally forgives herself for choosing herself and her dreams. minsan ay may ni-repost si direk sa twitter and it is all about the paths our mothers did not take when they chose to love us instead. when i read that, i just cried. obviously, i am thankful my mama chose me but honestly, i would’ve understood if she didn’t.i am glad i chose to watch this spontaneously on a work night (thank you, biancake, sa biglaang aya!) kahit nakipagsapalaran ako mula makati hanggang sta. mesa, tumakbo sa extension sa pagitan ng estasyon ng doroteo jose at recto para mahabol ang simula, at naglakad sa madilim at mataong lugar sa harap ng isetann para sumakay sa jeep pa-españa. dama ko ang maynila sa hangin sa daan at nasisilayan ko ang buhay nito sa mga taong nagsisiuwian. hiling ko lang na sa bawat tahanang nalalagpasan ng aking sinasakyan, may mga babaeng naaabot ang pangarap nang hindi nahihirapan.thank you, Papa God. thank you, para sa Sunshine.",2025-07-29,positive,0.965578019618988,8

Sunshine,"I can already imagine the discourse once marelease to sa VOD. First of all, I think it is so bold of Jadaone to come up with a concept that is so simplistic yet so real and full of grit despite the subject’s thematic weight. Abortion remains to be a debatable matter in the Philippines and opinions are always highly polarized among liberals and conservatives. Despite the country’s right-wing political ideologies, there are still calls from progressive groups urging the government to legislate better constitutions on health and reproductive rights for the benefit of those who need it most. Sunshine happens to be one of these people.Sunshine is a dedicated gymnast and an aspiring Olympian. With only a few weeks left to polish and brush up on her routine, she suddenly found herself in a bind that put her faith, morals, and self-worth to the test. The film doesn’t let us stay in a hopeful frame of mind; rather, it propels us to empathize with the character and question whatever is wrong and fucked up with the system. When Sunshine found out she was pregnant, her first instinct was to get rid of it. Pray it away. End it even if it means drowning in a cycle of self-destructive behaviors. It was clear from the very start she didn’t want to push through and she held onto that. I guess that’s as far as I can go for now so as to not give away too much of the plot.I watched this alone sa sinehan kanina and as soon as the credits rolled, i overheard someone sa likod ko saying na ‘bitin’ daw, and i totally get the sentiment that maybe for some people medyo half-baked or kulang ang storya. But sometimes, films don’t have to be loud in order to hit the right spots. With its very straightforward premise and message, I think Sunshine deserves the amount of hype it’s getting.The sports industry is already overwhelmingly taxing and having to face added burdens brought about by unwanted pregnancy can be way more damaging than one can fathom. Sunshine is not a film that will convince you to change your moral and political convictions; rather, it clings to the little hope of making the audience understand that the dilemma Sunshine had to face isn’t something that exists only in the reel world, but something that is very much present in the real world—in a society where bodily autonomy often comes at a social cost.Above all else, one thing’s clear is we really need better and safer reproductive laws in the Philippines so women wouldn’t have to go through under-the-table practices that put their lives on the brink of death. However, with the current political climate, i guess it’s realistic to assume we’re still a little far off. But with films like Sunshine, I’d like to think there’s still an ounce of hope for our country to perhaps embrace ideals that give primacy to women’s autonomy and rights, at the very least.",2025-07-29,positive,0.9471916556358337,9
Sunshine,"“Gets ko na.”I think Sunshine is Direk Tonet’s best work yet. It is simplistic, raw, and bothering but it is wrapped in a cute pink ribbons that seeks to hide the harsh truths women in our society face. The bits of humor at times give audiences a space to laugh and forget how heavy the message of the film is and then it just hits you with its narrative and the core message behind it. My favorite scene was the conversation between Ariana and Bata, it was both pro life and pro choice which may be a hard thing to pull off but the team did it effortlessly. I loved how raw and unfiltered it is and how it became a eureka moment for the other audiences. I am in no way fit to write a long ass review about the them of the film because stories like these are rooted in everyday struggles of women in such violent and patriarchal society. I loved the film but I would love more hearing how women react and talk about this film, sila ang tanging nararapat na magexpound lalo nito at naka supporta lang ako.",2025-07-29,positive,0.9955101013183594,-1

Sunshine,"Habang nasa kalagitnaan ng pelikula, nasabi ko na lamang sa sarili ko, “Para saan ba talaga ‘tong pelikula na ‘to? Ano bang point nito?” Yun pala, ako lang ang hindi agad naka-gets.Ang fucked up lang kasi isipin kung yung bata ay literal na physical manifestation ng nasa tiyan ni Sunshine, parang anim na taong gulang na anyo ng dapat sana’y magiging anak. Mas fucked up pa kasi kinokonsensya niya si Sunshine (tinawag siyang murderer). Pero later on na-realize ko: hindi siya totoong bata, kundi visual representation lang ng internal conflict ni Sunshine. Siya yung konsensya. Siya yung maliit na boses sa loob. Siya rin si Sunshine.Kaya hindi talaga tungkol sa journey ni Sunshine sa pag-abot ng mga pangarap niya ang pelikula. Mas tungkol ito sa batang karakter—na hindi rin pala talaga bata—at sa mas malawak na karanasang pangkababaihan. Kasi sa totoo lang, ang kwento ng abortion ay hindi tungkol sa bata. Ito ay tungkol kay Sunshine. Sa mga babae. Sa mga may katawan. Sa mga may kakayahang magdesisyon para sa sarili nila.Maganda naman ang ending. Medyo parang Modess commercial nga lang (charot). Pero kung tatanungin ako, feeling ko may kulang. Bilang manonood, hindi ko gaanong naramdaman ang bigat ng emosyon. Kulang sa lalim. Kulang sa hugot. Pero nabawi naman sa pagganap ng mga aktor—walang tapon, mahusay ang lahat.Isang halimbawa ng kakulangan sa emotional connection para sa akin ay yung eksenang umiiyak si Sunshine sa loob ng inn habang isinasagawa ang abortion. Malapit na akong bumigay nun, ramdam na ramdam ko na, pero biglang nag-cut to a shot from outside the window of her emoting and yung maingay na traffic. Aesthetic, oo. Maganda, pero di ko gusto. Parang sinampal ako pabalik sa reyalidad na, “Hoy, hindi ka kasama sa kwento.” Saksi ka lang. I don’t know about you guys, but I don’t like that.Favorite scene ko siguro ay yung early scene sa pelikula, yung umiiyak si Sunshine sa jeep. Maingay sa simula, tapos unti-unting tumahimik habang nakatutok lang ang lente sa kanya. Ang galing nun. Ang ganda. In addition, siksik sa intensyon ang mga detalye—katulad ng painting sa unahan ng jeep na may nakasulat na “Gift from God.” Hala siya, eh di ikaw na ang tumanggap. (charot)Anyways, ang dami kong nasabi. Pero ngayon na lang naman ‘to. Ang galing ni Maris. At isang malaking middle finger sa mga mahilig makialam sa buhay ng iba—lalo na’t hindi naman hinihingi ang opinyon nila. Wala rin namang ambag.

Sunshine,"Beyond how brilliant Sunshine is, this film reminded me once again why cinema matters in shaping and inspiring a better society. It has the power to connect, to spark meaningful conversations, and to heal.The film doesn't ask you to take a side or change your stance, instead it offers perspective. It doesn't scream any agenda on you, instead it quietly holds your hand and asks you to listen. This film made me realize just how unfair this world can be to women. It is hard enough to be a woman, even more so to be a woman in the Philippines. As a man, it opened my eyes around struggles I'm privileged not to face, but must learn to understand.Sunshine champions women with deep care and honesty, and Tonet Jadaone continues to be one of the most important voices in Philippine cinema today. I can't wait to see what she creates next.Maris Racal portrayed Sunshine with such precision and depth. Her fears and pain simmer just beneath the surface, yet she keeps moving-focused, trying to hold herself together-trying to drown out the noise as she fights to choose what's best for her.Top 3 scenes that stirred the audience at our local theater:1.

Sunshine,"This kind of film is what the whole Philippines has to watch. It is an eye-opener that sparks significant discussion in terms of how Filipinos perceive situations in a traditional and conservative way.I definitely loved how it tackled this controversy while focusing on Sunshine’s dream, which represents many teenage girls that suffered from unwanted pregnancies. In this hour-and-a-half film, it did highlight the majority belief yet also countered it in different narratives. Despite being so interested in pre-watching the film, I still didn’t expect how the film has featured many symbols and situations that Filipinos have to realize. I get so emotional about how the storyline has approached this issue, and I hope to see more of this in our country.Maris Racal is the right actress for the role. The way she played Sunshine was so natural and raw. Her delivery of lines, the body language, the expressions—everything was on point.

The bit with the pregnant teenage girl felt like a random device, which is unfortunate given the weight it carried on the film's plot.Still, I like how it tried to take on subjects like incest, poor maternal health, Catholic guilt. It works well when it shows its heart -- the tender moments between sisters, the heartbreaking text message to a friend before a risky decision.

Pero nagaalala pa rin sya, pero binigyan nya ng pang tricyle, 100 para special, para ligtas si annika.

Nung nawala si Annika, takot na takot si sunshine, nakakapagtaka kasi e ayaw nya naman talaga si Annika in the first place. Pero parte parin sya ni annika.

Hats off to you for delivering such an amazing performance! Despite the challenges you may face, you have proven that you’re an incredible actress.To Direk Tonet Jadaone, you did a phenomenal job exploring these pressing issues—abortion, public health, teenage pregnancy, Catholic guilt, patriarchy, and even sports.

Sunshine,"i have so many thoughts and feelings for this film. but it’s just a great film, hands down. throughout, we see sunshine behind and through bars and whenever we see her beyond it, her choices feel cathartic (like dasurv masiraan ng kotse! dasurv mabasagan ng beer sa ulo!) i found the hospital scenes to be the hard-hitting ones since there are so much to unpack. like either way, you’re trapped—trapped alongside the many other women who are forced to share hospital beds in public health centers/clinics/hospitals or either, you end up fighting for your life when the abortifacients don’t work. given the structures around us, the choices we are given do not serve us nor empower us, which then make these other options more enticing. despite this dreary reality, i found myself being emotional during the final sequence. sunshine finds herself free in gymnastics and that’s what she gets to do and she gets to drown out the noise. and that’s all what we’re advocating for, for women to have the choice. GOD i love this film sm. i do think it’s a good first step in addressing abortion in contemporary PH cinema. we are doing this film a disservice if we expect it to fully encompass the extent of nuances of this experience. what we can hope for, perhaps, is the exploration of more nuanced stories like sunshine’s to be seen and heard.",2025-07-30,positive,0.9960909485816956,-1

Sunshine,"the irony of the super christian ob-gyne treating sunshine like a child (say thank you papa jesus) while also expecting her to carry a child full term.there are lots of ironies in this movie, especially in how sunshine—a girl, barely a woman herself—is treated. “what if the child you’re carrying is the next president of the philippines?” but what about sunshine’s dreams? must those dreams end when motherhood begins? whose dreams and potential are more important? sunshine the movie doesn’t answer these questions outright, leaving you to chew on them instead and come to your own conclusions. at the start, i found the narrative device of the child as a manifestation of sunshine’s guilt a little too on-the-nose, but the pay-off in the ending made it worth it. as the ending says: gets ko nabut the best parts of sunshine are when it dwells on the almost fantastical ridiculousness of manila—not just the place, but also the people. details like the abortifacient vendor using the money sunshine gave her to “bless” her holy figurines or the santo niños looming over their whole transaction or dangerous illegal abortions followed by scenes of overflowing maternity wards. the movie passes no judgement on these scenes but merely offers them up for observation: here is manila in all it’s messy glory. it’s the perfect backdrop for sunshine’s series of bad choices.

Sunshine,"Siguro nasabi na ang halos lahat ng magagandang aspeto ng pelikulang Sunshine, pero may isang bagay talaga ang tumatak sa akin: ang ilaw.Hindi ko alam kung sinadya man ito, pero napansin ko kung paanong ginagamit ang ilaw upang i-spot si Sunshine. Sa bawat eksenang naggi-gymnastics siya, ramdam mo ang goals at motivation ng karakter niya. Tunay nga na siya si Sunshine, siya ang liwanag. Ang bawat eksena sa loob ng training court ay nagmistulang higaan ng dilaw na liwanag, puno ng pangarap, dedikasyon, at pag-asa.Pero sa tuwing lalabas siya ng gym, sa tuwing aalis siya sa mundo ng gymnastics, unti-unting dumidilim ang paligid. Ang bahay nila, na nasa gitna ng nakakasulasok na usok ng Maynila. Ang pampublikong ospital na kalunos-lunos ang itsura. Ang mga kalsada ay madilim, makulimlim, nakakalunod ang ilaw. Habang bumabalot ang dilim, makikita sa mukha ni Sunshine, lalo na sa kanyang mga mata, ang pagnanais niyang kumawala. Parang sinasabi ng mga mata niya, ayaw ko ng ganito. Ayaw niya ng dilim. Ayaw niyang masakal ng mundong nasa labas ng kanyang pangarap.Siguro ang pelikulang ito ay hindi lang tungkol sa abortion. Isa rin itong kwento ng mga batang babaeng may pangarap. Kung paanong nililimitahan ng lipunan ang kakayahan nilang abutin ang mga pangarap nila. Kung paanong pinangungunahan at dinidiktahan ang mga desisyon nila kung ano ang “tama” o “mali” habang sabay na pinipigilan silang lumipad nang malaya.Ang dami ko nang nasabi, pero grabe, wala talaga akong masabi sa galing mo, Maris. Ang husay mo, sobra. At ikaw naman, Direk Tonet, ang tindi mo. Dati, pinapakinggan ko lang yung opinyion mo tungkol sa abortion sa AWKP, tapos ngayon, pelikula na siya. Kwento na siya.

Sunshine,"Sa dami ng opinyon ng mga tao lalo na kapag tungkol sa katawan ng babae, iba ang ginawa ng Sunshine. Hindi ito dumaan sa maingay na diskusyon o pakikipagtalo. Tahimik lang siya, dala dala ang katotohanang hindi kayang ipaliwanag ng statistics, relihiyon o moralidad. Hindi siya ginawa para kumbinsihin ka o pasayahin ka. Ginawa siya para ipakita kung ano talaga ang nangyayari, at maramdaman mo kung gaano ito kabigat.Kwento sya ng libo-libong babae na tahimik lang, pero araw-araw may dalang mabigat na desisyon. Yung tipong kahit gusto mong may makausap, mas nauuna pa rin yung kaba kasi madalas, ang sumasalubong hindi pag-unawa kundi panghuhusga.Ang Sunshine ay paalala na hindi lahat ng sakit ay may eksenang iyakan.. minsan, nasa katahimikan ng paglalakad pauwi, sa paghawak sa tiyan, sa pag-iwas ng tingin, sa pagbitbit ng bigat na hindi mo pwedeng ibahagi kahit kanino.Hindi ito pelikulang dapat lang mapanood, pelikula ito na dapat pakinggan. Dahil sa mundo kung saan ang babae’y madalas pinagdidiskitahan, ang Sunshine ay isang matapang na bulong: ‘Pakinggan mo naman kami.'",2025-07-23,negative,0.7164961099624634,12

Sunshine,"I LOVE THIS SO MUCH  two things: (1) you already know my gripe with movies nowadays being too self-aware, esp when making commentary on social issues (e.g. through infodump dialogues and/or in-your-face monologues). given the themes of this movie, i was initially scared that this'll end up having the same issue— but THANK GOD that wasn't the case here. this one actually took the effort to situate us in Sunshine's shoes. it knew how to convey Sunshine's story by fleshing out the world that she lives in, by showing how she relates to others, by showing us the things she does not do and does not say. this movie knows how to practice restraint! that's how it managed to really make Sunshine shine :D(2) i love that this movie makes a very decisive stance on abortion, without having uhhhh such a cold attitude towards children. like, never once did Sunshine change her mind about having an abortion, and this movie also made several strong cases about how motherhood disadvantages/endangers women— but it also makes it clear that the problem is not... the babies/children? in fact the children are also victims here, as shown in Ariana's case. instead of being shown as ~the problem~ pa nga, this movie instead shows us that children may symbolize hope and companionship and possibilities. the unwanted pregnancy made life difficult for both Menggay and Ariana— but wasn't it Ariana, still, who stood up for Menggay? what Sunshine went through throughout the entire film was difficult and isolating— but she wasn't exactly alone, was she? hindi man niya gusto 'yung bata, there was a part of her that sought comfort from the possibility of the child's companionship. i think it's just human nature, yenno, to seek connections from others when going through a difficult time. and when you live in a society where you can't disclose all these troubles to anyone, not even to those closest to you— whose companionship can you seek, if not your own flesh that's taking shape into another life? sino pa ba ang mas makakaintindi sa 'yo kundi ang sarili mong laman at dugo? yeah in practice that may not be true LOL kaya nga ipinaabort pa rin ni Sunshine eh xD kahit anong ""romantic"" ng notion na susuportahan ka ng anak mo anuman ang pangarap mo, that's practically impossible when its very existence is what could hinder you from reaching them lol. pero ayun nga, it's the difficulty of the situation and our human vulnerabilities that add nuance to these discussions.—some pro-choice people (and i know they mean well naman) like to claim that abortion is ok because it's just getting rid of some soulless clumps of tissue anyway. and i guess that's scientifically true... but if fetuses are rly just soulless clumps of tissue then why are we so afraid of pregnancy at all...? why do we want to do abortions as early as possible...? I MEAN LIKE, it's silly to keep dismissing the possibility of actual growing life when discussing these things. and the fact that Sunshine Did Not Do That makes this movie good and relevant and real and special and a must-must-must-must watch. i love this movie <33 i hope more people get to see it",2025-07-29,positive,0.9871259331703186,1

Sunshine,"Sunshine offers something refreshing and different in Philippine cinema—and honestly, we need more stories like this. It’s bold, necessary, and deserves to be talked about. Kailangan natin ng mga kwentong totoo—‘yung nagpapakita ng realidad ng pamumuhay sa bansa natin.Under the direction of Antoinette Jadaone, Sunshine goes beyond being just a story about sports or dreams. It’s a story about womanhood in the Philippines—isang bansang deeply rooted sa religion, conservatism, at kung saan ang mga usaping tulad ng abortion ay nananatiling taboo. But the film’s message resonates far beyond our borders. It reflects the reality of so many women around the world. The film speaks so much truth about the lived experiences of countless women, and saludo talaga ako sa tapang ng mga gumawa nito. In these times, it takes guts to tell a story like this.Sunshine, as a character, represents those who dare to dream, and more importantly, those who dare to choose for themselves. The film is a powerful reminder that you have the right to carve your own path. Lalo na sa isang bansa na madalas i-demonize ang mga choices ng kababaihan, ng LGBTQ+ community, o kahit sinong pumipili para sa sarili nila.The entire film is gripping, emotional, and tense in the best way. Sa bawat eksena, may bigat, may puso, may katotohanan. I genuinely believe Sunshine will be remembered as a modern classic in Philippine cinema.

I liked how they showed both sides of the debate, sparking conflict in me as well as a viewer. And even though I am a catholic who grew up in an all-girls school, I found myself saying “gets ko si Sunshine”, kasi ‘yun yung realidad. Not everyone has access to the same resources, nor the privilege to live comfortably. Dito ko rin natutunan na wala akong karapatang manghusga.Maris Racal, tangina napakahusay mo!!! She portrayed Sunshine’s desperation, anxiety, and grit in such a raw manner that it was so beautiful. Fan na fan mo rin ako Jennica Garcia! I think everyone should see this film at least once in their lifetime. It shows the reality of Manila and forces you to face the truths of young Filipino women.

Hindi madaling maging babae, lalo na sa Pilipinas kung saan walang batas na magbibigay-karapatan sa ating awtonomiya sa katawan at reproduktibong kalusugan. Sa madaling salita, walang batas para sa ligal at ligtas na aborsyon.Katulad ni Sunshine, may tapang, puso, at paninindigan ang pelikula. At hindi ito magiging posible kung hindi dahil sa maingat na direksiyon ni Direk Tonet at mahusay na pagganap ni Maris Racal. Sa loob ng mahigit isang oras, inilagay ko ang posisyon ko kay Sunshine.

Maaaring hindi kami pare-pareho ng paninindigan, pero iisa ang aming nararamdaman habang sinusundan ang kuwento ni Sunshine.At sana, marami pa ang maabot ng pelikulang ito.

Sunshine,"— gets na gets kita sunshine (rant bc i need to take out sum shit that people my age cannot understand +medj spoilers)although I’ve always supported pro-choice, i still grew up in an environment and society of toxic, judgemental, religious people na sobrang diri sa idea ng topics na pinapakita ng movie nato… i have to admit that i am not perfect and have either stayed silent or have been partially agreeing w/ them to stay out of judgement,,,, that’s the issue here. Maraming tao na nagsasabi lang ng,,, “Bat ba hindi kayo nag-iisip?” or “Sinisira nyo lang future nyo”  I’m not here to normalize teenage pregnancy at all pero nakakakalungkot talaga how other people view the WOMEN in the situation. Ang dali dali nyo manghusga ng ating mga kapwa babae dhil di sila nagiintay for marriage, or minamadali nila ung “paglandi”, but it’s never on the guy. Its normal for us humans to feel lust and think about sexuality but I do not want to glorify it okay,, Sunshine as a person is not perfect, shes human. And so are all the other sunshines in the world. I have debated about the topic of teenage pregnancy a few times now and all i wish for is a better system in our country, and more support for the girls who have no choice, wether from strangers, family, loved ones, non-governmental organizations, or governmental ones,, even just that is rare haha. Abortion is not murder, it’s saving your life; and aswell as your child’s life from being put into an environment that isn’t meant for them. Adoption after labor isn't always the right choice. Imagine if u actually gave birth to it and put it up for adoption that ends the baby up in a worse household noh!!?!?!? If a girl isn’t ready to give birth, and has an independent choice, there shouldn’t be people to stop her at that point. One thing i dislike hearing is people bringing religious “morality” into the topic. It’s honestly super disrespectful, don't want to elaborate it anymore.Everything else aside, well no,, i just wanted to finally say how beautiful and educational this film was, the message was loud, raw, and clear, and is such an eye-opener to people who are unfamiliar with the topic; to see the authenticity of what teenage victims in the philippines go through, we see two perspectives, (Arianna) a little girl in a toxic household r’ed by her uncle, (Sunshine) and a young adult going through pregnancy, not being able to bare seeing another girl torturing her body— both suffering through the judgements of their fellow filipinos. This shows that we can never truly understand what somebody is going through unless we experience it in our own hands. But i wont forget about Annika Co in this movie ofc. Her part of being here shows na nde masama turuan ang mga kabataan tungkol sa mga gantong sensitibo na topic, and that Sunshine was never alone in her journey, Annika’s character was there to guide Sunshine on her journey, even though they had hardships with their relationship together, in the conclusion, the kid understood how Sunshine felt, and supported her throughout the end and that is more than enough.Basta i love u sunshine  this was not just a review of the movie, but also my personal rant feeling the reality beyond this fictional movie. Absolute cinemahay kingina tlg ni miggy and bubot !! I do not glorify teenage pregnancy/abortion but we should not disregard our rights as women to be able to make our own decisions for our future",2025-07-30,positive,0.6735455989837646,2

Sunshine,"no one tells you how alone it feels. to carry something you didnt ask for. to suffer in silence because your pain is inconvenient, because your choices are not yours. sunshine didnt just show that. it made me remember it. it made me feel it again.i watched it twice. and both times, it hurt in the same places. but it also touched something soft in me.a reminder im not the only one whos ever felt this way. her name was sunshine. but nothing about her story was light. and maybe thats the point—women are expected to shine, even when everything inside is collapsing. she made bad choices. yes. but what choices do we really have, when the world makes decisions for our bodies before we even know how they work? what choice does a girl have when the world punishes her for not being ready, and punishes her again for trying to survive it? when the system has failed us already when they have decided that bearing a baby is a demand and not a choice?and i felt seen. in all the things i was too scared to say out loud. the hiding. the pain you cant tell your mother about. the googling. the not knowing where to get pills, or how to afford them. the fear of your own body, and the shame of not understanding it. putangina. ang hirap maging babae. lalo na sa bansang pilit kang pinatatahimik.and still—there was warmth. there was sunshine. because somehow, this film made me feel less alone. because stories like this remind us that we are not alone. that our pain is not isolated. that someone out there is watching too, and feeling seen. that is what sunshine gave me. a relieving and painful kind of light. that not everything has to be healed, sometimes it just has to be shared.",2025-07-30,positive,0.9745790362358093,1

Sunshine,"Kakampi mo ako.I think what felt most important to me about this film is that the sensitivities considered in writing this story ensured that reality was still being shown. It showed respect for the people direk was able to interview, and it showed disdain for the culture we perpetuate in the guise of religion and culture.It calls for the audience to see the effects of the choices they ask of others. It calls for empathy for the victims and what they have to go through and give up — their dreams, their childhood, their life. And it calls for disgust for the old ways of thinking, and possibly our skewed views on morality.And in these hard times, how proper support from the people around you can allow you to make decisions for yourself and not because of what others will think. Something that most people do not readily have in our society.Every moment of this film has emphasized a deep-rooted societal problem that was asking to be seen.

Sunshine,"Although Sunshine (2024) advanced the conversation about abortion and body autonomy, one treatment of the film sets the conversation back.Don't get me wrong tho', it effectively presented difficult conversations within an already difficult subject. It doesn't just talk about abortion in the moral sense, but also its nuances—such as abuse and inaccessibility of healthcare, including both financial and policymaking aspects that rob women of the right to appropriate medical procedures.It also gave face to the concept of guilt through the personification of the unborn, embodied by the characters of the unnamed child and Ariana.But that very personification is where exactly the issue starts.The argument for the pro-choice position is the fact that life does not start at conception, but upon delivery. To personify unborn fetuses strengthens the narrative that abortion is murder. ""Murderer,"" as the unnamed child called Sunshine the moment abortion crossed her mind upon knowing that she's pregnant.But how much does this set the conversation back? Not a lot, really.The film did not fail in doing its job. By tackling abortion itself, it already succeeded in sparking conversations such as this one. And that's already a huge step in advancing women's right to accessible healthcare.Let's just hope that we'll get to see more ""woke indie films"" like Sunshine (2024).

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine doesn’t waste time. Within ten minutes, we already know what the titular character wants: she doesn’t want this pregnancy. What follows isn’t a mystery or a coming-of-age arc- it’s a fight.We meet Sunshine as she trains for the Olympic gymnastics qualifiers. She’s 19- focused, disciplined, and carrying a dream she’s had and has trained for since she was 10. Then she discovers she’s pregnant. From that moment on, the film never strays from what Sunshine wants: will she be able to get an abortion?Sound design is a big part in every movie and in Sunshine, the sound feels like another character. Before her routines, her coach tells her to “drown out the noise.” But what if you can’t? Sunshine lives by a noisy street. She trains in a chaotic gym. There’s a baby in the house that cries at all hours. Even in a church- where she prays not for guidance, but for forgiveness before attempting to buy an abortion pill- there is no peace. Sound, in this film, becomes symbolic of the constant interference she endures. The noise of judgment, of religion, of expectations- it’s relentless.That judgment bleeds into nearly every interaction she has. The pharmacist gives unsolicited opinions when she buys a pregnancy test. Her best friend’s mother condemned her. In a country where over 90% of the population identifies as Christian and Catholicism dominates public life, the supposed separation of church and state is functionally meaningless. Religion makes the rules. And when Sunshine is rushed to the hospital after complications from taking an abortion pill purchased from a street vendor, the doctor shames her in front of other patients, calling her actions “a sin in the eyes of the Lord.”Sunshine carries everything alone. Her future, once so certain, is now uncertain. If she continues the pregnancy, the nine years she spent training will be for nothing. Her body is already changing. Her coach notices. She can’t train like she used to. Her dream is slipping.And then we meet Mary Grace, a quiet but devastating side character whose story lingers. Their first encounter happens at the same place where Sunshine tries to buy an abortion pill. The second time they meet, Mary Grace tells her she thought her bloated belly was just worms- a line so innocent it crushes you. In that moment, we are reminded: she’s a child. A victim of incestuous rape and we later learn she’s just 13, after she was taken to the hospital for complications when she attempted to get rid of her pregnancy.In a country where sex is taboo and sex education is frowned upon by religious leaders, what hope do girls like Mary Grace-or Sunshine-really have?Maris Racal is outstanding. Her physicality, her posture, her tension even in the quite moments makes her character feel very real. She carries the film with a maturity and vulnerability and it’s undeniably Racal’s best work to date.At just 90 minutes, Sunshine is lean and direct. It doesn’t meander. Just a young girl fighting again and again for her dreams.Sunshine is a masterful depiction of what it means to grow up in a country where women and girls lack the right to choose. Where “I don’t want to be a mother” isn’t considered a valid reason. The film drives this home in its final minutes: the guy responsible for Sunshine’s pregnancy shows up at her house with his pastor father. They assure her they’ll support the baby “every step of the way” until the child turns 18. Sunshine listens, then finally says what she’s been saying all along: she doesn’t want to be a mother.We already know this. We’ve known it since the first ten minutes. But her ex and his father don't, or rather, can't understand it. “That’s not the point!” she yells, and she’s right. The moment others found out she was pregnant, it stopped being about her, but about the baby. They had no regard for her dreams, for her aspirations, and how pregnancy will affect her well-being. It was never about if she'll be supported, it was about whether she's still ""allowed"" to have what she wants. And in a country that denies girls and women a choice, the cost is often their dreams, their futures, and sometimes, their lives.Sunshine is just one story, but it’s shared by thousands. And unless the law changes, there will always be more Sunshines. Jadaone’s film dares to say that-loudly-even when the world tells her to drown out the noise.",2025-07-29,positive,0.831271767616272,1

That, which works quite splendidly if not for the fact that this is a film supported by a very tepid and uncharacteristic score from Maris Racal's own ex-partner.That being said, the best things about Sunshine actually emanate from its night sequences. It captures wholly the distress, illegality, and dismay of everything to do with abortion, the black market, and whatever Sunshine's problems are adjacent to in reality. Those night scenes seemed straight out of Abbas Kiarostami’s Like Someone in Love.It's actually so apparent by the film's end that everything that does come out of this leads to the most reasonable one: a film that doesn't explicitly preach what to do, save for what its problem is tied to in context.But yeah, that score really does this thing a disservice.

But to be honest, I was a bit hesitant lang sa character ni Annika at first, don’t get me wrong, she’s good, but hindi ko alam during the film if necessary ba sya? and I feel like naging unrealistic yung palabas bigla but eventually natanggap ko din naman and yes, “gets na gets.”I’ve been a supporter of Maris ever since her PBB days and I know that many, including myself, won’t forget her issue, but I hope this film and her talent alone will open more doors for her in the film industry.

Sunshine,"direk tonet, i am (and will forever be) in awe of you.i have always been hooked on to this film even before its philippine premiere, due to its striking plot and of course the leading star attached to it, maris racal. watching this film on the big screen, i felt so uneasy knowing that this is pretty much a reality for filipino women and women overall.sunshine is more than just a story of a girl tortured by the thoughts of bearing a child at such a young age; it is a grounded story surrounded by problems caused by societal pressure towards women and questionable christian morals and beliefs, which also opens up the current state of the country in terms of healthcare and its views on abortion. art has always been meant to provoke, and direk tonet did it so gracefully—like how sunshine performed her routines, but still so raw with scenes depicting medically unsafe abortions during the second half.the cinematography was very pleasing for the eyes. most of the shots used were very effective in laying out the emotional impact of this film, most especially its exterior and tight shots with sunshine being the subject. another directorial choice that caught my attention was its symbolism. notably, the use of bata and ariana as figments of sunshine's imaginations. despite those major choices, i personally liked the subtle and unnoticeable details more because i truly believe that it was those that helped keep the film coherent with its vision. details like added sound bites from the television and radio or the production design of sunshine's house.overall, i love it. yun lang HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",2025-07-30,positive,0.9974868297576904,-1
Sunshine,"watching this movie took me back and reminded me that pagbabae ka, magisa ka lang. they were able to encapsulate that with sunshine navigating everything on her own. having to hide because there is no other choice. the moment she tells anyone, she wont get help, it means surrendering her dreams even if she doesnt want to. to have a movie discuss the sensitive topics of this country such as abortion, child pregnancy, premarital pregnancy, and the negative side of religion is so brave. to be able to show it in a story so compelling and very filipino is so important imo. sobrang ganda ng cinematography, using manila’s lights and noise while also highlighting the darkness within its shadows. everyone’s performance in this film adds so much to the already great backdrop and dialogues. there was so many scenes that went so hard, too. when sunshine was on the jeep, when she was alone in that motel, when she performed, even when she was just walking. every scene felt so important because maris embodied and delivered sunshine so well. ramdam ko yung galit, yung desperasyon, yung sikip sa dibdib ng walang magawa. especially when she woke up in the hospital, the doctora started making her ask god for forgiveness. my blood boiled and i may have cried angry tears ngl. we are so used to religious guilt tripping in this country, its not even helping anyone. anyway, Sunshine deserves her flowers.

Sunshine,"“kahit anong mangyari, kakampi kita.”first of all, this movie is so refreshing. it shows the struggles of our main character, sunshine, and goes into depth how unwanted pregnancy can lead to mental and physical problems, the desperation of having limited options and resources, the shame encoded into our heads at birth by religious and societal expectations, and most importantly, it shows the resilience women are forced to do just to simply survive.second of all—i love, love, LOVE how this story is not your typical filipino pro-life propaganda warning. it’s honestly so upsetting how conservative and unprogressive our county is with abortion, but hopefully with this movie, older generations can sympathize with not just sunshine, but also mary grace’s situation.i’m actually so glad sunshine doesn’t force its main character to attach herself to the stigma of “abortion is murder” mindset; but rather, being able to be firm and push through with her decision—knowing that she’s not ready to be a mother—and doing what’s right for her (and the baby), without the influence of her boyfriend’s opinion, as well as the boyfriend’s father who offered to take care of financial expenses, which is quite rare.another beautiful moment in this movie that i personally love is the sisterhood between sunshine and geleen. geleen’s understanding nature is powerful in itself—that having one person who will love you and guide you despite everything you’re facing can make your way in life a little easier. knowing that you have someone to lean on in times like this is so fortunate, cause not many filipinas can have that kind of support system.and dr. helena’s help? as someone pursuing medicine, i understand the male doctor’s perspective on how he doesn’t want to loose his license, but with just dr. helena stepping in discreetly, she is incredibly brave. she’s risking her entire life on the line for someone she doesn’t even know, and for me, that’s such a great example of camaraderie between women.although the first doctor that “helped” sunshine was unnecessarily rude. i’m glad geleen stepped in and defended her sister. as a doctor, don’t you have to leave religious talk outside work? what an asshole.overall, i’m so glad that philippine cinema is slowly stepping out of its comfort zone to talk about sensitive topics like these despite half (or even the majority) of the country being against abortion. i hope this movie spreads like wildfire—a wake-up call to break free from patriarchal laws, and the belief that women’s bodies and choices are truly their own.",2025-07-30,positive,0.9952682852745056,-1

This is the movie I will recommend to international friends if they want to know the Philippines.The characters, the culture, the psyche, how far and behind we are in women's rights and sex education is rolled into this beautiful, heart wrenching movie. We may venerate a baby (Sto. Nino) and the virgin (Mary), but the way women and children are treated is ironically (if not disgustingly) far apart from our devotion to the Catholic faith. And we are reminded of it from the set and location. Even the jeepney's signage. The writing is clever in its use of language. Its use of [insert -ism] was gently introduced and when you realized what it is, it hits hard. I can't describe it any other way how confidently gentle this was tackled.It reminded me of 70's-80's era of Filipino films. This is the highest praise in the canon of Philippine cinema.

Sunshine,"been a few days since i watched the film as of writing this but i still can’t find the proper words to describe the experience of watching sunshine in the cinemas with all the people around me. first of all, it really is a different feeling to enjoy a movie in the cinema and see how other viewers will react to scenes as the film progresses. may dagdag factor talaga sya na napapaganda lalo yung film and mas nakaka-engross talaga sha for me grabe!!!!! hands down lang talaga sa performance ni maris. her character wasn’t merely a persona shaped by the script or the vision of the writer, SHE IS SUNSHINE. PERIOD. sobrang natural yung expressions, parang nandun talaga ako sa tabi nya for the entire journey to sea games (and in my head, pati sa olympics na pinapangarap nya ) and it’s mindblowing how i never really felt na movie yung pinapanood ko— everything felt so real because what’s portrayed is the reality. sa totoong buhay, kahit na ang laki na ng pagbabagong naganap tungo sa pagkakaroon ng lugar ng babae sa lipunan, ang realidad ay marami pa rin ang ipinagkakait sa kanila. marami pa ring hakbang ang maaaring gawin at mga pagbabago na dapat isulong dahil hindi sapat na ang mga filipinong babae ay naikakahon sa imahe na hinubog ng daang-taong impluwensiya ng katolisismo sa naging kultura natin. ANG MGA KABABAIHANG PINOY AY MATAPANG! MAABILIDAD! MAHUSAY! AT HIGIT SA LAHAT, SILA AY PUNO NG PANGARAP. nakakalungkot na hanggang sa kasalukuyan, ang mga desisyon na dapat sila ang gumagawa ay patuloy pa rin na hinahadlangan hindi lamang ng batas kundi pati ng kapwa-tao mismo. the symbolisms in the movie are subtle yet soooo impactful. the color choices sa outfit ni maris at annika, the choices of angles sa mga eksena na parang nanliliit sya o kaya ay triumphant, maging sa mga shot na sinusuntok ni sunshine yung tiyan nya— these details make the movie worth rewatching just to dig deeper into the creative choices sa movie. hands down to direk tonet and everyone who shaped the film to become what it is today<33until now, hindi pa rin ako sigurado kung sapat ba yung mga naisulat ko para maipahayag kung ano ang tunay na naramdaman ko upon watching this movie. pero ang mahalaga, GETS KO NA.",2025-07-27,positive,0.9862576127052307,-1

Sunshine,"There are films that entertain, and then there are films that hold up a mirror—brutal, honest, and impossible to look away from.Sunshine did that to me. It stripped me raw and left me in quiet reflection long after the screen went black. I saw in Sunshine’s story not just a character, but the collective ache of countless women who’ve had to choose between self-preservation and duty.The central challenge of Sunshine—a young gymnast discovering her pregnancy at the cusp of her Olympic dream—hit me in a visceral way. Not because I’ve ever been pregnant, or aspired to the Olympics, but because I know what it’s like to carry something heavy in silence, to want something for yourself while the world insists you exist for others.Sunshine’s fear, defiance, and quiet longing mirrored the emotional territory I navigate daily: trying to live on my terms in a world that insists I don’t get to choose.My full review here: inthewakeofthings.wordpress.com/2025/07/30/sunshine-2024-on-choice-compassion-and-the-weight-of-expectations/",2025-07-30,positive,0.9753408432006836,1

Sunshine,"What I like about Sunshine is this film fully embraced Antoinette Jadaone's artistry as a filmmaker, similar to her magnum opus ""Fan Girl"".The luscious colors and shades at the backdrop of a failing city. The grounded surrealism. And Jadaone's honesty in what she wanted to convey in the film. Much like her previous romance films Alone/Together and Never Not Love You, this film grappled with social and economic uncertainty but this time it highlighted Maris Racal's character's struggle to love her passion in gymnastics. It's no surprise Racal acted the hell out of her role, but my flowers are for Jennica Garcia who encapsulated the ghost of Sunshine's what-could-have-been.

Sunshine,"marami akong nakikitang western reviews calling this so-so. if titingnan mo nga from their pov, oo nga? ano bang bago dito, it's literally about a high school student getting an abortion to focus on her olympian gymnast dreams. but this is where context matters. films like sunshine are so important as a conversation-starter in countries like the philippines where abortion and reproductive health is deemed not as important by a male-dominated government and a religious culture. ang dami pa ring pro-life kaya sobrang hirap para sa mga kababaihan tulad ni sunshine at mary grace magkaroon ng access sa safe ways for abortion. sobrang nakakadala makita sila na irisk ang buhay nila para magpatuloy pa mabuhay. mahirap magbuntis pero di hamak na mas mahirap magpa-abort.at lalo itong pinapahirap ng isang patriyarkal na lipunan, katulad ng doktor na unang nilapitan ni sunshine para tulungan si mary grace. tumatak siya sakin kasi siya ang salamin ng mga kalalakihan sa ating legislation chambers na walang pakialam sa karapatan ng mga kababaihan at galit na galit sa mga plataporma na nagsusulong ng kanilang welfare. isa pa yang si miggy at ang tatay niya. mga barumbado. kaya oo, importante ang paggawa at pagpapalabas ng mga pelikula tulad ng sunshine. nagulat nga ako pinondohan to ng fdcp? at pinayagan ilabas sa maraming sinehan. sana marami pang mamulat sa importansya ng pagbibigay ng choice sa mga kababaihan. choice mabuhay, at hindi lang bilang tagadala ng buhay.",2025-07-29,positive,0.6299049258232117,-1
Sunshine,"Late diary entry. It really is true that employment screws the cinephile in us. This is Jadaone's Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) mixed with the magical realism of Jojo Rabbit (2020), and Brocka's depiction of Maynila as a harsh, predatory city that traps and exploits the marginalized. There's a night scene that was basically taken from a Brocka handbook, framing, camera movements, dialogue. I love Jadaone's growth as a filmmaker and this project shows how she matured in multiple filmic aspects, but more so on the commendable screenplay. The conversations felt realistic– something a Gen-Z would say in the present context. There's a clever and subtle critiquing done by adding the English-speaking scenes as well. As if they poke fun at the other contradictions in our postcolonial, patriarchal society now.Multiple ironies and contradictions lie in this film—the titular character's name doesn't coincide with her lived experiences, the vendor selling the religious images of Nazareno and Sto Niño also sells the abortion pills, how the people who claim to care for us are so quick to judge if situations do not align with their perspective or morality. Sunshine to me was a thought-provoking way of presenting a very evident issue in our Philippine society, and Jadaone made it brutally honest without lacking the compassion and clarity to bring about this story.I love how hopeful the ending was tbh. I know that this country has been so steeped in religious conservatism that even acknowledging how hopeful that ending was would raise flak—but this movie has done a great deal to create awareness and productive discussions on unwanted pregnancies. Sunshine was a confrontation of our modern maladies, something that very clearly threatens the health and future of women. That's another contradiction in itself, having a government by the people, for the people and yet it chooses to ignore the evident crises of its people. I digress. Gets kita, Shine.

Sunshine,"My favorite part of the film is how Sunshine simply does not have any maternal figure in her life.Her mother is literally nowhere! Numerous characters try to act in this woman's place, but all fail in being the figure Sunshine needs.I believe this is why the coach remains a flat character for the entire duration of the plot. Even if she refers to Sunshine as ""anak,"" we never get to see her be a mother to her. The coach is at the center of the conflict, the one person who must never know that she's pregnant. Thus, Sunshine refuses to open up to her coach, refusing to be cared for knowing the consequences. When her coach hears rumors of her pregnancy, there is no comfort in her words when she confronts Sunshine. Instead, all the secretly pregnant teenager receives is a reminder of what is at stake, that she won't get to be on the team. This pushes Sunshine to go back for a stronger round 2 of the pamparegla.Not even Thea's mom can give comfort to the friend of her daughter. She literally does the opposite, ordering Thea to stay away from Sunshine. Even when Sunshine asks the motelkeeper for help, and they reluctantly do so. The elder women place her on a tricycle and leave her to bleed out as the tricycle rushes to the hospital.Then there's the doctor. Sunshine's sister perfectly criticizes her demeanor towards Sunshine. Her sister asks the doctor if she's a relative of theirs or possibly their mother because she's acting like one. Though this might seem like a counter, when you take into account how the doctor cares more about Sunshine apologizing to the Lord and thanking Him rather than Sunshine's well-being, the case falters. Also, her character felt more like a voice of how religion greatly affects the medical field and in turn, women's bodies.The same goes even for the case of Mary Grace, who has been impregnated by her own uncle. While her mother is alive, their relationship is complicated to say the least. Her mother enables the abusive relationship between the uncle and child for money, so that someone else can ""take care"" of Mary Grace, essentially removing herself from the role of being a mom.I think all this is why her sister is highlighted as a light in her life. She is the closest thing to being a mother in Sunshine's life, caring about her health, whether she goes to school or not, and so on. However, they are sisters at heart. They can only hold each other's hands through life. Her sister does not order her what to do with the baby, instead defends her from the doctor, pays for the bill, and gets her home. They are sisters through and through.",2025-07-30,negative,0.5130021572113037,1

At times I feel like the film is a literal outcry for help. Every character here is a representation of that and is the result of what's wrong with the system in general. This paired with Racal's impressive performance strengthens the film's core message. Simply put, Jadaone's work is not a prententious flick that uses sensitive subject matter for mere views but rather an impactful affair that successfully champions itself as a vessel for awareness. Overall, the film is resonating with me, a powerful testament that the film transcends genders and in itself is a beautiful feat because it lets you see and viscerally feel Sunshine, and witness her journey to self-forgiveness and inner peace.",2025-07-30,positive,0.9916178584098816,1

Sunshine,"The entire time I was watching, I felt like I couldn't breathe. It's claustrophobic and suffocating, just like how Sunshine herself feels. You feel her world slowly closing in on her, invisible walls tightening around her in every frame. The camera doesn't let you breathe, and neither does the sound. Manila's noise is constant, overwhelming, and disorienting, especially for a gymnast who needs focus and silence to thrive. Sunshine is literally and figuratively trapped in tight spaces, cramped jeepneys, crowded streets, the overbearing sound of trains passing by, judgmental stares, and high expectations. Visually and sonically, it captures how isolating and terrifying it is to carry a burden like hers in a society that is less than kind toward women. (Btw, just to put it out there, the cinematography and colors in this film are GORGEOUS.) In almost every film that tackles women's issues in the Philippines, you'll find this line repeated in many reviews here in Letterboxd: ""Ang hirap maging babae. At lalong mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas."" It's because it's true. Every day, women here continue to fight for autonomy, for safety, for the right to choose themselves. We live in a deeply patriarchal and religious society that expects women to always put others first—especially family, be it their parents, siblings, or children—and shames them whenever something bad happens to them as if they brought it upon themselves. Society never asks the men who take advantage of women simply existing to change, rather it expects women to quietly endure. Bakit kailangang babae ang palaging mag-adjust? I appreciated how the film showed moments of solidarity between women, but it's sad how that's not always the case in real life.Exceptional performances from the entire cast, especially Maris Racal, who is tremendous in the titular role. From the start, she's completely convincing as an elite athlete and future Olympian: disciplined, focused, and has no room for error, as both her dreams and the dreams of others rest heavily on her shoulders. But it's in moments where Sunshine wrestles with fear, guilt, and inner conflict that Maris truly shines. She captures and presents the character's vulnerability so well. Also, as someone who always adored Jennica Garcia since her GMA days, I absolutely loved watching her quiet and subtle acting as Sunshine's sister.I said in my first review of Fan Girl that I hoped Direk Tonet would make an even braver film, and she did. Sunshine focuses and dives deep into the themes it introduces and stands firm in its critique—something that I felt was somehow lacking in Fan Girl. While some moments didn't always work for me and the magical realism elements sometimes took me out, I understand the choice. Part of me wishes it stayed more grounded and direct, but the “Gets ko na” scene near the end hit so hard that I stopped minding altogether. It's a great, important film and I hope it helps open up more discourse on women's reproductive rights in the country.Go see it in cinemas when you can.

Sunshine,"After making waves at the Toronto Film Festival last year and winning a Crystal Bear at the Berlin Film Festival early this year, #SunshineMovie finally comes home to the Philippines. Starring Maris Racal in a powerful lead performance, the film follows Sunshine Francisco, a decorated gymnast whose Olympic dreams are threatened when she unexpectedly becomes pregnant. She must choose between her ambitions and the responsibilities suddenly placed on her — all while navigating a society that dictates what women should and shouldn’t do with their bodies.Directed by Antoinette Jadaone, the film doesn’t shy away from the hard questions — ones that should be answered by the Church, the government, the educational system, and most crucially, parents. Why is premarital sex and reproductive health still taboo in 2025? Why does society police women’s choices about their bodies? Why can’t we provide options for victims of abuse? These questions linger long after the credits roll.Maris Racal gives a career-defining performance — fragile yet defiant — as a young woman trying to stay strong while breaking under immense pressure. Aside from her acting, her gymnastics scenes are highly commendable, a testament to her dedication to the role. Jennica Garcia gives a quietly affecting turn as her older sister, shining in key emotional scenes. Child actor Annika Co, making her debut, is a revelation — a true scene-stealer with star potential. Former child star Rhed Bustamante will touch your heart & churn your stomach. Piolo Pascual also appears in a poignant special role. Manila, chaotic and contradictory, plays more than just a backdrop — it becomes an extension of Sunshine’s journey. From historic churches to narrow alleyways, she searches for clarity, strength, and hope, beautifully captured & lighted by ace cinematographer Pao Orendain.Sunshine is bold, relevant, and deeply moving. It’s a call to conversation, to empathy, and to change. Super highly recommended!!! Now showing exclusively at SM Cinemas nationwide — don’t miss it.",2025-07-31,positive,0.993259847164154,1
Sunshine,"This movie is so satisfying to watch because it empathizes with its main character, sunshine, a young gymnast training for the olympics who happened to have an unwanted pregnancy. Young women like her are figures often shunned in popular philippine media and well, society so it’s refreshing to see someone like her in a sympathetic light. Abortion is such a taboo topic in this country so i very much appreciate the relentless uncovering of the different failures of the government and society with regards to women’s reproductive health and rights. Props to Maris for fearlessly embodying the role. Abortion is healthcare. It should be a choice accessible to anyone that wants it. It doesn’t have to be earned which is why I do find the imaginary kid representing sunshine’s conscience or the possible “kid” she might bear in the future unnecessary and redundant in the face of all the other oppressive opinions surrounding her. If the goal was to voice her inner worries, it wasn’t needed, it was already felt and would’ve been better shown some other way. If the goal was to voice the external conservative audience’s thoughts, then it wasn’t needed as well because they’re already thinking it, the film should’ve been secure with putting its faith on Sunshine alone. She’s a woman and she has dreams and having a baby is not part of that. She has value still for just the fact of being a person. I guess it just rubbed me the wrong way. It’s a very beautiful film nonetheless, shining best in its moments of truth and courage.",2025-07-25,positive,0.9945034980773926,-1

Sunshine,Hindi ako ang target audience ng pelikulang ito dahil isa na akong pro-choice at feminist before I entered the cinema. Ang tunay na target audience nito ay ang mga conservative nating parents or mga kakilala.

Sunshine,"this is such an important piece of art—for women, from women, as women—especially in the context of the reality of being a filipina living in the philippines. the whole runtime genuinely felt like i was watching a piece of philippine cinema history unfold. i’ve never been so emotionally compelled, invested, and moved over a piece of (ph) film (for quite some time now). this is what real cinema should be. the weight and power it bears in emphasizing the ills of society, directing empathy, progressing toward solutions.from the opening sequence of the routine, the editing and cinematography of this movie shines. quickly pacing up to the story’s compelling conflict, maris’ gripping performance hooks you into a spiraling anxiety. that immediate catholic guilt was just perfect in its timing and execution, you can’t help but greatly appreciate how well thought-out this specifically was. as she walks through the streets of metro manila aimlessly and frantically all throughout in different parts of the story, it mirrors a striking resemblance of a guarded uneasiness that we women all fear that something bad might happen to us in the streets; it’s a fight for our lives everyday. it’s also so bold of a creative decision to figuratively humanize the unborn that at first, suspiciously could have gone wrong in one mishandling of the story but eventually paid off in working favorably by ticking the (filipinos’) tendency for sentimentality—especially with an even darker subplot. the casual inhumane reality the common filipino endures.only by memory, my only issue with the whole cinematic experience is that piolo pascual as a character actor is too damn iconic and too damn handsome that there was literally a collective gasp in the theater when he came out on that one scene. di mapugngan ang kilig sa mga tao and were taken aback and away from the story with his perfect sir marco lewk. yes, my only complaint in the whole film is that gwapo ra kay ka SIR piolo pascual. this is balanced by how good of a casting choice miggy is—unrecognizable character actor (complimentary), looks like your typical spoiled teen with a face people can easily hate (complimentary), with his acting adequately matching up to his scene partners.pretty sure it was by choice that all the men are the direct a(holes)ntagonists of this story. fuck the patriarchy. fuck the system. in contrast, the relationship with the women around her significantly holds her. to nurture and to care for one another. it’s the gentlest part. knowing you’re never alone in the struggle.who knew a simple routine could bring so much emotion to a crowd. a fitting ending that serves justice to the character and story.stellar performances. cinematography, editing, and scoring is divine. thank god this is one of those filipino films paced intentionally. the writing coupled with its humorous takes in such a bleak setting was done so tastefully and appropriately that it never felt out of place. optimistic for the progressive turnout of the story’s message to the general public. art shapes culture, culture shapes people, and people shape the world. please papa god let this work in our country’s favor.i’ve only just seen this once and would love to see this a couple of times more in appreciation of the mastery of craftsmanship everyone involved in this production. as i always believe that movies can save lives, and can change lives. it’s one of those pieces that makes you hopeful of what great cinema (and future) lies ahead for our country.p.s.lahi ra sad gyud ang igo sa clear reflection of a society you currently live in",2025-07-31,positive,0.9906091690063477,9

Sunshine,"Ang iniluha ko naman talaga kasi sobrang bigat sa puso knowing how raw and authentic this has been, especially with the fact that a lot of women, even girls, actually experience this, na this just goes way beyond the screen but is a sad reality of some.Being a woman will always be both a blessing and a curse, most likely when it comes to fertility, because often it will always be tied down to a woman's worth. Being a mom takes a lot of courage, for it requires a lot of sacrifices, dedicating your whole life to a child you've conceived for 9 months. It makes you appreciate motherhood and admire the women who dream to be a mother who is capable of giving unconditional love and a good life in a sense na they are willing to do everything for their child... But the truth is not everyone wants to be a mother, and society must learn to respect this kasi it is genuinely for the betterment of everyone, most likely for the child itself. Kasi being a mom is such a huge responsibility that most aren't even ready for, and a lot of other factors, such as teenage and unwanted pregnancy and being a victim of sexual abuse, contribute to the decision of termination of the child. People often tend to overlook it and deem it as something so negative, but what they fail to see is how this decision will always come from the place of love and care for themselves as well as the baby kasi genuinely I think it is more cruel to continue things you don't even want in the first place 'cause both the child and the parent would only suffer physically, emotionally, and psychologically. Also, I hate how women are expected to sacrifice their own dreams, aspirations, and life itself like it's so unfair how men could easily get away with anything, while the the women will be the ones to suffer, be condemned, and be villainized for things that they both did naman. Kaya sex education shouldn't really be a taboo topic, especially safe sex kasi it would really be a huge help in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Aside from it, grabe ang ganda ng cinematography ng film and sobrang galing ng mga gumanap kasi isinabuhay talaga nila 'yung characters nila to the point na 'you wouldn't even think na this is acting kasi it feels so real. Ewan ko but I really loved the fact na they kept the background noises kasi it makes you feel like you are really there with them at that moment, tapos 'yung overall vibes na sobrang Filipino coded.",2025-07-29,positive,0.9835665822029114,3

She’s talented, funny and v pretty The fantastical way the characters were introduced made me cringe a little bit, but it reminded me of college theatre days. It’s uniquely Filipino in a way that I can’t describe. There were a few rough edges here and there.

I also appreciate how film celebrates the innate wisdom of children :’))Tribulations don’t kindly pick a certain period in our lives, we will be found unarmed in them any time. It is also vague how long its adversities will delay our dreams—but what is sure is that they can never end them.

We had different perspectives about the topics discussed in Sunshine, which is exactly what makes the movie relevant. And why so many people need to watch it. Every detail and line seemed to be carefully crafted. Every scene had an important message. From men failing to take accountability and leaving all the burden on the woman, the religious and conservative opinions, the reality of the healthcare system, to the harsh truth that criminalizing abortion does more harm than good. Annika Co's role was such an amazing addition to the entire story. Without her, I feel like it would be incomplete. She was a representation of a young girl's heart. I would say I felt like the ending was lacking in impact and power, hence my rating. I feel like there could have been more to show Sunshine's decision and outcome.

Sunshine,"babae at isang agham ang puso ng pelikula. sa maynila: kung saan masikip, mabaho, hindi makakilos ng maayos, at maraming mga tao ang huhusga sa iyo. the movie shows how women even in this modern society, still carry the burden of the spectrum. we, women, are expected to act like it. na laging piliin ang practical at hindi bigyang pansin ang pangarap. “mahirap maging babae, mas lalo na sa Pilipinas.” Sunshine confronts these social issues. the patriarchal conflicts of societal and religious issues. Maris Racal, carries her character with potential and determination. Ang daloy ng mensahe ng pelikula ay nararapat mapag-usapan. sana sa darating na panahon, people will choose to ignore the religious beliefs of the system- sana makabuo tayo ng empathetic, understanding, and compassionate individuals. kudos!",2025-07-31,positive,0.9779844880104065,-1

Sunshine,"“The unborn” are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don’t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don’t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don’t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don’t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.– David Barnhart",2025-07-31,positive,0.989078938961029,-1

The film highlights how this country has continuously failed and disregarded its women, trapped in an unprogressive system blinded by religion and outdated norms. It chooses not to see the real dangers and struggles they face every day.Our government should focus more on this long-standing issue because protecting women is not just necessary, it is crucial. Women are the only ones who hold the right to their own bodies, and we need to give them the full chance to live freely, safely, and with dignity.This film does not just tell a story.

Sunshine,"sunshine is a film by Tonet Jadaone. context is very important because if you have seen jadaone’s films (That Thing Called Tadhana, Fangirl, Alone Together among others) then you will know this is HER film. you feel it in every frame. the writing. the direction & performances. there’s no voyeurism here. no moralizing. just truth. honest, specific, sometimes messy truth about what it’s like to be a woman in this country. not in the headlines, not in theory, but in the streets, in health centers, in quiet conversations with friends who are too afraid to say what they really need.maris racal delivers the performance of her life. she holds back when she needs to. she breaks in silence. she carries every scene with restraint, sensitivity & precision. she becomes sunshine. and it’s the kind of performance that demands to be remembered.the ensemble is just as grounded. jennica garcia, thea, the kid: each one brings something real to the table. nothing is forced. they don’t play characters. they play people you’ve probably met. maybe they remind you of someone you know. maybe they remind you of you.what makes sunshine work is not the acting or the direction but the refusal to look away. the film doesnt hide behind a metaphor. it gives us a manila that feels exactly like the one we move through. where pamparegla is sold outside churches. where motels won’t let you in if you’re alone. where grieving teenagers are all around but they have kept it in because no one has dared say “you’re safe here.” from my POV, the film takes a narrative risk. there’s a device that briefly pulls you out of the realism it builds so well. but it sticks the landing. because what matters is that you never stop feeling for these women. and that you leave the theater asking why stories like theirs still feel unsafe to tell.i’ve had my own sunshines, close friends, a relative, a classmate. women who needed care, not judgment. watching this film felt like watching them again. and all i could think was, “please, let her be safe.”this film deserves a seat in our national conversations. not just in cinema panels, but in health committees, in policy rooms, in the offices of people who still think there is a valid excuse to deny access to care.one of the most necessary films of the year.",2025-07-31,positive,0.992244303226471,1

Sunshine,"this one hit omg here r my thoughts - jadaone just gave us a visual storytelling masterclass brah. The amount of meaning etched into every single frame was so tastefully done and was especially satisfying to watch as a young filipina- they could never make me hate you maris racal omg what a star  sobrang halimaw umarte taena!- i felt like that gif of leonardo dicaprio pointing at the screen whenever i recognized a filming loc LMAOAOOA like omg thats morayta?- i really loved the subliminal messages scattered throughout the film.. all the little moments when you see mothers who clearly did not want to be mothers, the moments when you see children who were born into families unplanned, the moments when the male characters refused to provide assistance when needed.. they made up such little parts of the plot but they added so much volume to the message- i also really liked the choice of making the aborted children their own characters in the story. it may be a double-edged sword kind of thing but i think addressing the ""buhay pa rin yan!"" argument by giving the kids their own autonomy and still concluding that despite fear, they truly just want the best for their mothers was just spot onnn- lowk felt too short LOL like feel ko there was potential for more.. pero the film is enjoyable as it is- somebody else said this already but this was one of those social commentary films that critique today's society simply by showing a woman living a regular week in her life. Like this is the reality of thousands of filipino women. The reason this hit so hard for me and for my sister and all the young filipino women in the cinema with us was because sunshine could easily be usi'm really glad this received critical acclaim because its narratives like these that filipinos need to hear. surviving in the conservative catholic philippines as a woman is nawt for the weak  and its about time that progressive, proudly pro-choice films like sunshine make it big",2025-07-31,positive,0.9966243505477905,-1

Sunshine,"alam niyo yung feeling na pagkatapos manood ng pelikula tungkol sa struggles ng modern women, o ng kababaihan in general, parang may nagaalab na galit sa loob mo? ganon na ganon ako. tipong hindi lang galit na umiiyak sa tahimik, kundi galit na kumakabog, galit na gusto mong isigaw, gusto mong may baguhin.galit ako sa sistema. galit ako sa kung paano itrato ang mga babae — na parang katawan lang, na parang obligasyon nilang tiisin, magparaya, manahimik. galit ako sa mga bulok na paniniwala na tinuro sa atin at patuloy pa ring pinaniniwalaan. galit ako sa tradisyon na sinasanto kahit matagal nang nakakasakit. galit ako sa mga mata na mapanghusga, sa mga bibig na laging may masasabi pag babae ang gumagalaw. galit ako sa mundo nyeta!pero itong galit na 'to, hindi to galit na mauupos lang. hindi to galit na lilipas pagkauwi. ito yung klase ng galit na may pinaghuhugutan — may direksyon, may laman, may pagmamahal. galit na gustong ipaglaban ang kapwa. galit na may layuning itama ang mali. ganito yung pinaramdam sakin ni direk tonet ngayon. ramdam mo na hindi lang siya nagdidirect eh. nagsisisigaw siya sa pamamagitan ng pelikula. pero sa halip na sumakit ang tenga mo, sa puso siya tumatama.at si maris, grabe. ibang klase, walang duda. sobrang galing niya mag-embody ng role, ang effortless pero ang lalim. habang pinapanood ko siya, hindi ko na siya nakita bilang artista eh. she felt like someone i knew. a friend. a neighbor. a stranger na napadaan pero dala ang bigat ng buong mundo sa katawan niya. dama mo sa kanya yung lapot, yung pagod, yung hagard, pero higit sa lahat — yung dignidad. yung tahimik pero matapang na dignidad.at ang mas masakit, 21st century na, pero kailan ba talaga matatapos ang pag-ccrucify sa mga babae? bakit pag babae ang may choice — sa katawan niya, sa sex, sa pagiging ina — bigla tayong nagiging moral police? gets ko, some people will say, ""eh pinili niya makipag-sex."" oo, pero bakit sa panahong ito, ang pagbili ng condom, ang pag-access sa contraception, ang simpleng pagtanong tungkol sa pts, ay parang kasalanan? bakit parang kahit anong piliin ng babae, mali pa rin?at sa kaso ni red, bakit parang hindi pa rin siya pinapayagang mamili kung anong gagawin niya sa sarili niyang katawan? bakit parang laging may kapalit, laging may parusa, laging may kapwa babae pa nga na una sa paghusga?ang ironic, diba? ang daming takot sa sex education, sa reproductive rights, pero hindi takot manghusga. the more we condemn, the more we isolate women. at kapag nagiisa na sila, dun nagsisimula ang desperation — dun sila mapipilitang hanapin ang mga opsyon na mas delikado, mas tahimik, mas mapanganib.sana makita ng mga tao na hindi lahat ng babae na nabubuntis ay handang maging ina. hindi lahat ng katawan ay handang magdala. hindi lahat ng buhay ay handang isuko ang sariling pangarap para lang maging ina. at hindi ito dahil masama silang tao — kundi dahil may sarili silang timeline.sana yung mga taong galit na galit sa konsepto ng ""choice"" ay matutong makinig. choice is not evil. choice is freedom. and freedom is humanity.sana maging wake-up call itong pelikula na ang kababaihan ay hindi lang tagapagdala ng buhay — may mga buhay din silang gustong buuin para sa sarili nila. at kung alam nila sa puso nila na hindi pa sila handa, hindi natin sila dapat pilitin. hindi natin sila dapat husgahan. hindi natin sila dapat ipako sa krus.punyeta talaga ang sistema, pero hindi ibig sabihin wala na tayong magagawa.",2025-07-31,negative,0.6395929455757141,-1

Dinig ang dumaraang tren, bulungan ng mga tao sa daan, kakaibang tugtugan sa tricycle, nakakasulasok na paligid, at marami pang iba. Mula Avenida hanggang Quiapo, ramdam ko ang nag-aalab na pangarap ni Sunshine. Pursigido. Desidido. Hindi siya nagpatinag sa ingay ng paligid. Mula umpisa hanggang dulo, buo ang kaniyang loob para sa kaniyang sarili at pangarap. Walang halong pag-aalinlangan. Mahusay ang pagkakahabi ng pelikula, mula cinematography hanggang linya ng mga karakter. Mahusay ang pagkakaarte. Madaling maunawaan. Hindi ko naramdaman na halos isang oras na ang nakalipas. Hindi nakababagot. Punong-puno ng pangarap at serye ng kawalan ng akses sa sektor ng pangkalusugan. Dinala tayo ni Sunshine sa kaniyang buhay at pangarap. Isa sa tumatak sa akin na eksena ay ang huling tagpo. Ginawa niya ang kaniyang stunts, nag-gymnastics siya, sumayaw nang walang pag-aalinlangan at pangamba. Sumabay sa indayog ng musika habang dinadama ang bawat hampas ng kaniyang ribbon. Doon pa lang, alam mo na. Tahimik ang eksena matapos ang pagsayaw, ang higpit ng yakap ay ramdam mo. Para bang ikaw ang niyayapos at pinapakalma nito. Salamat sa mahigpit na yakap. Sa malalim na aspekto, nakalulungkot isipin na hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa rin tanggap ang abortion sa ating bansa. Nakalulungkot isipin na nawawalan ng karapatan ang mga kababaihan na mamili— na piliin ang sarili at pangarap. Mapagmulat at mapagpalaya ang pelikula. Pinamulat sa atin ng bawat eksena ang isang isyung nangyayari sa ating bansa sa kasalukuyan. At pinalaya tayo ng pelikula mula sa tanikala ng tradisyunal na paniniwala at pananaw ng karamihan. Hindi maglalaon, unti-unti na rin matatanggap ng mga tao ang katotohan na bahagi ng ating karapatan ito bilang kababaihan. Sa huli, isa lang ang sigurado, nanaig ang kaniyang pangarap. Pinili niya ang kaniyang sarili ng walang halong pag-aalinlangan. Kaya para sa lahat ng Sunshine, nawa'y lagi ninyong piliin ang sarili at pangarap.

Sunshine,"“the filipino women and the curse of catholic guilt” despite popular western belief where early stages of pregnancy are just lump of cells and does not count as a human being, this is where pro-choice comes in and protest women’s autonomy through the lens of science. in our nation this is not a strong argument as this doesn’t penetrate the teachings of the catholic/christian church where flesh is flesh and the act of aborting a lump of cells is murder. now this is where sunshine and the jojo rabbitesque kid brave depiction contradicts with the filipino pro-life argument “future president” and the what ifs of the future child, despite some view this representation as counter productive it actually stands for how much catholic guilt and patriarchal values is imbued from the moment we are born, that’s why no matter how we view ourselves as progressive, modern, and forward, the filipino women still struggle with their autonomy over their body and choices where they face at the mercy of unwanted consequences. that’s why i admire how brave “sunshine” depict the lump of cells as a hallucinatory unborn child where it grounds how filipino culture views it and turns it as a film creative force to show how women no matter the circumstance should have complete autonomy over their body, not in an overly liberal way where everything is muddled in the gray area but as an acceptance that we live in a society where women are still tied to patriarchal reproductive roles and system wherein we disguise feminist liberalism as matriarchal.with abortion still illegal in our country, teenage and unplanned pregnancy a national problem, and contraceptives a taboo subject. this is a film that offers understanding, empathy, and compassion to sunshines out there that are resorting to unsafe, life threatening, and “illegal” ways that society calls bad choices but what is “bad” when it is the only choice they have. lastly i cannot complete this write up without mentioning the lino brocka, i love how it shows manila as a character with its noise, chaos, and decay through the familiar seams of avenida and quiapo with its religious interplay of choice (accessibility to unsafe preganancy pills) and solace of a religious power it holds.maris racal stellar performance will forever hold her in the filipino cinema history as sunshine, as how nora aunor is bona, and hilda koronel is insiang.i really really hope more people watch this and be a strong catalyst of change for reproductive rights as it is core a healthcare and human rights.",2025-07-31,positive,0.9758603572845459,-1

Sunshine,"Promise, 'di siya overhype.We’re halfway through 2025 and far from its denouement but I must say that SUNSHINE, if not the best, is one of the best and one of the most important films of the year. I’m so sorry, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION FROM LILIA CUNTAPAY, but I believe I now have my new favorite Antoinette Jadaone’s work. They said during the promotion that this is the last day this will be shown here sa provinces and then starting tomorrow, sadly, it will only be shown to 3 cinemas na lang so I felt the substantial need to watch it tonight. Mind you, sobrang bigat pa rin ng pakiramdam ko, tapos na lahat, at ngayon na tina-type ko lahat ng to.Sunshine heavily tackled significantly sensitive issues here in the country - rape, teenage pregnancy, poor healthcare, and machismo. At habang ina-absorb ko lahat kanina inside the movie theatre, I couldn’t help but think about my two sisters who are the same age as the protagonist. Ang bigat. Ang lala. Ang hapdi. Give me a span of time to write an essay about this and I will take that challenge without a doubt. That’s how it affected me big time. It hits home.Now let’s talk about the performances. First sequence pa lang, it’s apparent that Maris Racal studied the role. Inakap niya at binigyan niya ng kaluluwa yung karakter. Hindi siya bumitaw hanggang final sequence. She had a lot of silent moments in the film and those were the most powerful. Nakakabingi yung katahimikan na halos hinahabol ko na rin yung hininga ko minsan. Jennica Garcia’s character, on the other hand, though it’s just a supporting role, is one of the main highlights throughout. Yung kahit minimal lang yung dialogues niya, tignan mo lang siya sa mga mata niya, maiintindihan mo sya. I love her here. She’s too authentic. May eksena silang dalawa ni Maris dito and that was when I lost it. Iyak ako eh. GRABE YUN. Grabe yun!!!!As for the direction, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, direk Tonet. Iba pa rin talaga kapag ang kwento ng babae ay gawa rin ng babae. Maselan, matapang, at may puso. Salamat sa buhay mo. Nag-uumapaw sa social realism ang pelikula mo. Lino Brocka would’ve been so proud!! Sunshine knows Manila and all its aches and decays. May problema ka? Okay, pero hindi titigil ang mundo. Hindi titigil ang buhay ng mga naka-paligid sa‘yo. Dagdag mo pa na nasa Maynila ka kung saan life is always on survival mode. The film captured those perfectly.Lastly, Sunshine doesn't preach or impose. She makes her decisions but doesn't force you to change your opinion either. Your role as an audience member is to listen. The rest is for you to reflect upon on your own.Gets ko na.",2025-07-31,positive,0.9835394620895386,1

Sunshine,"a beautiful and important film :"")i spent most of it crying and whispering curses at the screen. matagal ko nang alam kung gaano kahirap maging babae sa pilipinas—but watching it unfold onscreen hits differently. ang hirap kasi lahat ng sakit, galit, at poot makikita mo. you’re forced to face the things we’ve been taught to bury, forget, or avoid.by the last ten minutes, i was inconsolable.ang hirap harapin ng katotohanan na whatever happened in the film—our reality is even worse. sunshine may be fictional, but her story is the story of all filipinas. it speaks the raw and painful truth about how limited our choices are.lahat tayo si sunshine.lahat tayo, kailangan pang ipaglaban ang karapatan natin sa sarili nating katawan.lahat tayo, pinalaki ng hiya at takot, forced upon us by society’s expectations.we’re all just trying to survive the cruelty of our country’s outdated norms and catholic guilt.as the credits rolled and the lights came on, i looked around at the people seated there with us. there were women my age, some younger, some older. there were men. there were lolos, lolas, nanays, tatays. so many different lives and experiences. and all i could think was: “sana lahat ng nandito gets na rin si sunshine.”and if they don’t yet, i hope they find it in their hearts to have empathy—for her, and for all the sunshines out there.i hope this film reaches more people. but more than that, i hope it urges those in power to finally take a closer look at the very real struggles filipinas face and make the long overdue changes we’ve been fighting for.",2025-07-31,positive,0.9754939675331116,-1

Sunshine,***TW: SA***Long review ahead!!! Honestly having a difficult time writing down my reflections. First–it was so important to me that Sunshine got pregnant because of consensual premarital sex instead of rape. For years I have heard people say that the only valid reason for even considering abortion is if the pregnancy is a product of assault. This conservative mentality is harmful because it insinuates that women have a choice over our bodies only if it has been violated first.…,2025-07-30,negative,0.8230368494987488,-1

Sunshine,"“gets ko na.” — tears. almost immediately. a lot of issues were tackled so gracefully and with sensitivity in this film, whilst not necessarily favoring any particular side. the scene where sunshine asks for forgiveness at quiapo church, the same church where she was desperate to find abortion methods, shows how two conflicting views on abortion can be felt at once. also liked how it depicted the pressure of being an athlete, of maintaining your weight, and of the unrelenting need to train despite your life pretty much falling apart. if there’s anything i want to praise, it’s the way the film portrayed the role of women supporting one another, from the protagonist, her sister, her coach, the doctor, down to the innkeeper that rushed her to the hospital. the worst takes in this film were from men (no surprise there) who didn’t even bother asking sunshine how she felt (because in our incredibly conservative & patriarchal society, women are nothing more than their childbearing abilities lmao). ultimately, the only valid opinions on a woman’s body & whether or not she should undergo abortion should be hers & hers alone ! ! !",2025-07-31,positive,0.990515947341919,24

Sunshine,"“Naiintindihan mo na ba ‘ko?”“Gets ko na.”i grew up in a somehow conservative and very religious household. i was taught by my elders that abortion is murder. period. full stop — that no reason could ever justify the taking of a “human life.”i never questioned this belief. until i grew up and learned about the social conditions that surround my imperfect — almost dysfunctional — family. dumating na sa punto na palagi ko nang tinatanong kung bakit nga ba pinili pa akong ipanganak ng nanay ko. tinawag ko ang sarili ko na isang kasalanan. isang aksidente, hindi sinasadya.eventually, i started to question my own views. my mother didn’t have a choice. but what if she did? what if her religion did not instill fear onto her — did not make her choose between her dream of living in the US and…me? what if she was given the right to make autonomous decisions for her own body and for herself?the importance of the sanctity of life has long been asserted in, what seems to be, an unending discussion on the controversial topic of abortion. these endless queries led me to enlightening myself to a greater picture of things. THAT criminalizing abortion is a NEGLECT to women’s rights. up until this day, women’s health and bodies have been continuously politicized by society. bago natin ituring na isang krimen ang abortion, we first need to view this on a sociopolitical lens. bakit nga ba maraming mga babae ang nagpapalaglag?what i loved about this film is how it portrayed Sunshine’s story in the most raw and harshest way possible. direk jadaone, a WOMAN director (yes kailangan iempahsize to), saw Sunshine as a human being — a young woman who FEELS, who DREAMS big for herself. not as a criminal but as a real woman with real human flesh with the right to her own life. even Manila didn’t feel like a foreign place as a Batangueña. the entire film was real, we were all living in the same society as Sunshine’s.hindi ito pawang fiction lang. totoo si Sunshine. she is every young woman who had to choose between herself and a life she does not want for herself. she is also every young mom who had to choose between the same things. she is every young woman who is held back by what today’s society deems as morally upright based on outdated religious doctrines. she is every young woman who was denied proper healthcare, every young woman who was denied their choices and rights.she is every young woman who was neglected by a corrupt system that politicizes on women’s health and bodies.thank you, direk jadaone for introducing us to Sunshine. and to my mother, i hope you know that i would’ve understood you the same way Bata understood Sunshine.",2025-07-31,negative,0.6487762331962585,2

Rather, para siyang naging sigh of relief that finally, FINALLY this issue is being talked about and represented on the big screen for the masses. diba? ang pagbubuntis, lalo na ng mga dalaga ay hindi lahat pinlano at ginusto. karamihan, pawang mga biktima lang din ng kakulangan sa edukasyon ukol sa kahalagang ng safe s*x practices. ‘yung iba, biktima ng kasahulan.although i cannot fully say that this representation of such an issue was able to encompass all its accompanying factors, however, it indeed delved into some of its facets: how abortion is a healthcare and a socioeconomic issue due to it being constitutionally prohibited in the country, and much more. sobrang bigat ng mensahe, ng mga salita, at ng tinatalakay ng palabas. pero kahit ayaw man natin no’n, that’s really how it is in real life. this movie isn’t fiction; it’s inspired by true events, particularly of the young, pregnant women in the philippines. many do resort in unsafe practices leaving them at more risk, so bakit kailangang mag agaw-buhay muna ang tao para sa desisyong iyon? abortion is a choice, abortion is healthcare.",2025-08-01,positive,0.5386788845062256,-1

Sunshine,"Aspiring Olympian Sunshine's (Maris Racal) world suddenly turned upside down after she realizes that she is pregnant. This is by far the most beautiful and bravest Filipino film I've watched. There is an important topic that needs to be discussed after watching the film. And we need to sit down and talk about it. Loved the whole technical aspect of the show. Cinematography was on point (go Pao!). The gritty Quiapo was a whole character in itself. The bustling city echoes the fear and confusion in Sunshine's mind, yet amidst all the chaos - she is alone. Rico Blanco's music radiated organically throughout the film. Both silent and scored scenes touched feelings and intensified emotions.Maris Racal cemented her status as one of the great actors of her generation. No need to look pretty as long as she delivers the right emotions that her character calls for. And damn, Jennica Garcia! She fuckin' deserves an award! Take it, take it!!! Especially that last scene (spoiler ahead!) where she's the only one who's crying among the cheering crowd? My heart tore to pieces. Special mention to Annika Co who amused me with her natural acting chops. For a kid to deliver that, she's definitely a hot talent to watch out for! And of course, Direk Tonet. Been a fan of Antoinette Jadaone since That Thing Called Tadhana (and yeah, as a ka-eme, AWKP) and damn she really is one strong voice in this industry. Her writing, strengthened by her directing, sends out a clear message to her audience. Sunshine is an example - subtle yet painfully direct in one.After the 7pm screening in SM North last Monday, she came to answer a few questions and what struck me the most is her sharing about her most favorite part of writing - REVISING. For a professional writer like her, it is very humbling and inspiring to hear that. And her body of work definitely shows how great they are due to the notes, lessons and heart she puts to her stories.Favorite scene in the whole series of course was the last routine of Sunshine where she hugged the little girl. Just found myself crying. I literally wanted to jump to the screen and hug both of them just to say, ""it's okay"". ""Naiintindihan mo na ba ako?""

Sunshine,"drown out the noise.sisimulan ko ’tong review sa paraan kung paano nailantad ang pelikula sa mga manonood— sa ingay. sa unang parte, maliban sa naging pagsasanay ni sunshine, ay dadalhin ka nito sa marumi at maingay na sulok ng quiapo kung saan nakabudbod ang mga relihiyosong karatula tulad ng “gift of god,” at “in god we trust.” hindi ka nito lulubayan subalit halos nakaukit na ito sa bawat ugat natin— para bang isa itong palantandaang isa kang pilipino. sobrang bigat nung isang scene na umiiyak si sunshine sa labas ng simbahan, nagmamakaawa na tanggalin lang ang sanggol sa loob niya at babawi rin siya sa Diyos. dahil iyon naman talaga ang itinuro sa atin tungkol sa relihiyon sa simula palang; ang pagiging kondisiyonal nito. dito rin na-introduce ang batang karakter na hindi natin nalaman kung ano ang pangalan at kung bakit ba siya sunod nang sunod kay sunshine na parang nakatali sila sa isa’t-isa. hindi ko alam if napansin din ng iba na hindi totoo/hindi naman nag-e-exist yung bata at isa siyang talinghaga ng magiging anak ni sunshine. ineencapsulate niya yung pagkakasala, kahihiyan, at trauma sa relihiyon ni sunshine. sinusundan siya nito sa bawat balak niya, sinisigawan siya gilid, at pinagdududa ang sarili. higit pa diyan, suportado rin naman siya nito. ika nga niya, kung ano ang pangarap ni sunshine ay pangarap niya rin. kung ano ang nakabubuti kay sunshine ay makabubuti rin para sa kaniya. sa usapin ng abortion, lingat sa mga tao na bigyan ng kaluluwa ang nagdadala ng bata. na para bang isa lamang itong karwahe at hindi taong may puso at pangarap. na sa sandaling nagkaroon na ng buhay sa tiyan mo ay doon na rin nagsimula ang pagkamatay mo. dagdag ko lang sa parte ng mga bata bilang representasyon/metaporya ng mga anak na hindi pa naisisilang ay si ariana. natuwa ako kasi example nga siya ng mga sinasabi ng tao o di kaya nung doktor kay sunshine na, “paano kung maging presidente siya ng pilipinas? mag-imbento ng gamot sa aids?” dahil binahagi niya rin na pangarap niyang mag-artista o di kaya maging unang beking presidente ng pilipinas. at hindi naman din natin isinasantaboy yung mga posibilidad na ‘yon, pero sa sitwasyon na tulad ng nagdadala sa kanya na si menggay na isang biktima ng incestual at corrective rape bilang isang tomboy, maiintindihan natin kung bakit kinailangan maglaho ni ariana. pinabulaanan din ng pelikula ang mga kuro-kuro na aabusuhin ng mga kababaihan ang legalisasyon ng abortion— na baka maging isang gawi na nilang magpalaglag. naipakita na ang abortion ay hindi madaling piliin. na kahit sigurado ang isang tao na ayaw niya maging ina ay isa pa rin itong mabigat na pagpasya. madugo sa puso, madugo sa katawan. hangga’t mananatiling walang pagpasya ang mga kababaihan sa kanilang katawan, mananatili rin ang iligal na pagsasagawa nito.walang lugar ang mga kababaihan sa ganitong sistema at bansa. napatunayan ito sa pelikula— mula sa ospital, sa lansangan, pati sa karapatan mamili. kahit hindi pa nalalaman ang kasarian ng nasa sinapupunan ni sunshine ay hinalaang lalaki na agad ito, isa na namang tanda na hindi kailanman iniisip ang posibilidad ng isang babae. sana sa mga nakapanood nito dahil lang gusto nila si maris, o di kaya’y na-curious sila sa kwento. sa mga hindi sigurado sa kinatatayuan nila sa usaping abortion. sana, tulad nung bata, ay masasabi niyo na ringgets ko na.",2025-08-01,positive,0.6393097043037415,-1

Sunshine,"Seen @SM North EDSA Cinema 6 w/Post-Show Q&A and Pagpag Session w/Direk Antoinette Jadaone FANTASTIC SUNSHINE 2/2“Gets ko na.” I still recall that time back in high school when we were taught the morality of abortion in Religion class. I was a scholar at a conservative Catholic all-boys school, and although I wasn’t religious (nor did I ever practice Catholicism on paper), its discussions almost shaped my beliefs on the subject matter. What I did not know was that those beliefs were tied with several factors besides religion such as patriarchy and conservatism. That was before the pandemic, and since then, my viewpoints have stirred away from every close-minded and male-led influence those so-called teachings had. Yet, I still find it unfair that I don’t have to go through those experiences that women go through in this patriarchal society, including that of Sunshine. Critics were not kidding about the Lino Brocka comparisons to Sunshine, yet this has that unique female perspective that elevates its authenticity. The film is straight-forward, and in doing so, it is raw, visceral, and brutally honest. It takes its viewers through an experience rather than dictate or spoonfeed, and it rarely shies away from its reality. From the milieu alone — from the shitty healthcare system, to the sheer lack of contraceptives (if you could find them, they’re very expensive), ignorant, privileged boyfriend, and to the conservative religious doctors and rapist relatives — we are already shown that this is not a world suitable for Sunshine and for women like her who are struck with unwanted pregnancies. Because that’s the truth of our nation. Because this is not a country that favors the oppressed. As the famous saying goes, “Mahirap maging babae, pero mas mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas,” (“It’s impossible to be a woman, but it’s more impossible to be a woman living in the Philippines,”) and that couldn’t be reflected better in this film. Sunshine seeks to reclaim autonomy over her own body, which every woman deserves so but is seldom granted that right. Despite the latter being true, we still see Sunshine do everything she could to get that abortion, even if it means having to spend an unreasonable amount of money just to do so. Some may say that her story is inspiring, but it’s tragic how inspiration is confused with disturbance. This is a story that’s supposed to shed light on the fact of the matter because this is one of many issues in the country that have to be addressed, especially within our own government. Even its production design and cinematography that go hand-in-hand highlight how constrictive this place is for those who are forced to go through such uncomfortable, unasked experiences. Much of the film’s raw emotions would not have been as impactful without Maris Racal. Her acting and performance here are simply generational and incomparable. She may be known for her more comedic roles (and pure wit and vibes in interviews), but her role of Sunshine brings out her more vulnerable side that is just as raw as the attitude of the film itself. Among the more underrated performances is Jennica Garcia, who levels up with Maris Racal’s natural performance but brings a distinct, yet supportive dynamic. Child actor Annika is also great and is secretly the one who makes some of the more emotional scenes, especially those towards the end, work so well. In addition, Meryll Soriano stands out, as do Elijah Canlas, Rhed Bustamante, Xyriel Manabat, Piolo Pascual, and Angeli Bayani – even if the latter two only show up in one scene each. Some ongoing debate had sparked since its release here with regards to the weaving of the children subplot into the story, and while it did have its risks, for better or worse, it still cannot be disregarded how brave Antoinette Jadaone and Maris Racal are for telling this kind of story. Perhaps it could have been subtler, but in a country like ours, it was necessary to have been told through a more straightforward direction without being too preachy. There have been a handful of films out there that tackle abortion and unwanted pregnancies, but what makes Sunshine stand out is the mere fact that it is set in the Philippines. We are one of the last few countries to have abortion illegal as we are rooted in traditions influenced by the patriarchy and religion that treat it as an immoral, evil doing and as a taboo simply because, to them, the youth are “being irresponsible.” Sunshine never puts the blame on its titular character for its consequential catalyst, and through its depiction of such a life in this country, instead, asks us to question our reality: Did the youth fail us for exploring a natural part of ourselves, or did the adults fail them by placing and enabling all these barriers as mere punishment substituted by the words of “a lesson” or “a teaching”? That’s what makes Sunshine scary: The simple fact that it’s set in the Philippines; that women with unwanted pregnancies have to navigate through these stupid barriers, but it also ends with hope for a better future where women are allowed to make choices for their own body. In fact, we must also be reminded of this saying: “No uterus, no opinion.” Such a timely film that is raw and honest with its sensitive topic that must be talked about because so many women have had experiences like that of Sunshine. P.S. Seeing this at one of the many screenings with Q&A and audience sharing truly added to its communal experience. Direk Tonet always mentions how the film is no longer hers but ours now that we have seen it, and you could clearly see and feel it as the credits rolled, with some women opening up about once being a Sunshine or their parents giving birth to them at such an early age. It reminds you that those experiences are real and are still happening to other women underground up to now. It’s also amazing to see an eye-opening drama such as this fill up the theaters more than it did for Fantastic Four (which made for such a whiplash of a double-feature for me because it tackles the opposite theme to Sunshine).P.P.S. It goes without saying that those who say that Philippine Cinema is nothing compared to Hollywood films should shut up and watch this in cinemas. Cool to see my prof work on this.

Sunshine,"""gets mo na? gets ko na.""This film could've ended there! since it already foreshadows the choice she made. But no, instead it got better and gave the audience a satisfaction of how Sunshine became successful despite her hurdles.I really loved the color grading in this film! at the first scenes it gave me a feeling of uneasiness, and worry for Sunshine — maybe that's because of the constant dark grading along with the green or teal background. The film's color grading gradually changed as the story progresses, when Sunshine gained hope, and courage for her decision the film got brighter.Fuck I have a lot to say in this movie. I also loved how they showed a taboo topic in the Philippines as well which is the incest among minors because of the so-called ""utang na loob"". I really loved how Sunshine stood up to tito bobot — that fuckin' asshole. By showing and portraying this taboo topic in this film I hope the viewers gained a light that this is wrong. A minor, pregnant by his tito, is not normal and is wrong. Many people chooses to turn a blind eye on this matter kasi.I also loved how women support women in this film, okay not that first doctor but the second doctor who offered Sunshine a checkup on her private clinic.This movie showed that being a woman doesn't mean being a mom only. Being a woman could mean so many things, being a woman could make being an olympian possible.Rooting for you Sunshine, you are not just a mom-to-be.

Because they always go for the most shallow differences and often time the most hypocritical. Every city in the Philippines, and for the most part the world, has traffic, hot weather, trashy streets, muggers, and poor air quality, not just Metro Manila. This frustrates me because there IS a tangible difference between Manila and other cities, it's just that a city's identity is more spiritual in essence. The churches in Cebu City won't have vendors selling abortion pills, nor will doctors in Davao City berate you moments after caring for you after you nearly died from an attempted abortion, but in Manila they do. It's a city of people getting by, it's why you go to Manila, and a deep understanding among everyone that that's what they're all trying to do, just get by.Every year my favorite Filipino movie to come out pass by me until the next year, I think this is the first time that's changed.",2025-08-01,positive,0.5765801668167114,-1

Sunshine,"the film hits too close to home for me. sunshine is suffocating, and maybe that's a directorial choice. it hits in the most uncomfortable and painful parts of me at times. it resonates with every woman who has to determine a better choice out of two shitty choices: one that might shackle her freedom or one that may free her but haunt her at the same time. it makes you feel rage at systemic failures which birth a backward society that villifies women for their lapses of judgment--damned if they do, damned if they don't. sunshine is linear in its plot. it never really takes you out of sunshine's head, so you see how raw everything is, how immature she is, how she's desperate and breaking apart but trying to keep it together, and how she's just a kid who fucked up. the film works because of this approach, albeit some plot devices are too on the nose--making them iffy and questionable, and may have muddled the film's stance. there are obvious plot holes, little details that could have enriched the world-building were overlooked. some subplots lack depth, but the performances made me look past on these things, in a sense that it was pleasant enough to watch for me. not for everyone, but everyone should be part of the discussion. jadaone's films are usually hits-or-misses for me, but sunshine is one of her better ones. the message may be clear and hopeful, but real life presents a much darker truth: for most women, there are no olympics and dreams to hold on to. in reality, we still have a long way to go in paving for a more humane society for filipino women.here's to working towards a future where women are not shamed for reclaiming their agency, and where their indiscretions are not berated and ridiculed, but treated with proper education and compassion.",2025-08-01,positive,0.9589068293571472,-1

Sunshine,"""sunshine"" delves deeply into prevalent social realities and dares to question long-standing traditional systems. but what struck me most was how it thoughtfully explored women’s bodily autonomy, weaving it into a narrative that felt both natural and unforced.the lead's inner turmoil exists in the gray areas—a subtle moral dilemma, especially when prioritizing autonomy challenges societal expectations.this raises critical questions: how does sunshine’s obligation to herself impact the broader community? and what roles do the people around her play in shaping or reinforcing these expectations?i honestly wished there was more screen time, yet in the moments it was given, it still managed to leave a profound message about women's reproductive rights—one that lingers and quietly settles in your mind.",2025-08-01,positive,0.9839567542076111,1

Sunshine,"Superb portrayal of religious elements and realism in the Philippines. Kung ipagpalagay mo sarili mo na maagang na buntis at nag gagalugad sa quiapo na tila bawat sulok naka tingin sayo ang panginoon, para ka talagang sinasaksak ng liwanag. E wala kang magagawa, saan ba dapat humihingi ng tulong? Sa doctor na sasabihan kang mag sorry kay lord o kay manang na tiga benta ng abortion pills sa quiapo tas sobrang mahal pa? Ang hirap maging babae dito, yung nakabuntis nakakatakas at yung nabuntis kailangan maging mabuting ina kahit mag-isa na't lahat. Yung scene na nag uusap sila nina Miggy at tatay niya, arghh sorry pastor pero pakyu. Kadalasan sa totoong buhay, o sige nabuntis na nga buti papanagutan EH KASO anong kapalit? Bawal na mag-aral yung babae, yung pangarap na maging propesyonal wala na, dito na lang sa bahay tiga alaga hanggang magkaroon na sapot ng gagamba. Pag babae ang daming kailangang isakripisyo, pangarap ko o yung fetus na to e.Also want to point out how well written lahat ng side characters. Si Dr. Helena!! As someone who belongs sa healthcare forces, ang hirap kung yung sistema natin hindi sinusuportahan yung nga katulad nilang maagang nabuntis, lalo na mga below 13yrs old. Myghod naiyak talaga ako dun sa ateng nabuntis ng tito niya. Marami nakong nabasa na irl stories na kinukutya daw sa hospital mga ganyan. Yung lalaking doctor sa sunshine arghh isa pang pakyu. Bakit tatanggihan ang buhay ng isang biktima dahil lamang sinubukan nilang ipalaglag yung batang nabuo in an illegal way din? Puta doctor ka sa lagay na yan, bakit ko hahayaan mamatay parehas kung kaya ko naman buhayin yung isa? Dahil sa sistema na pumipigil sa atin at sa mga paniniwala na matagal na tayong binabalot. UGHH PAANO MAGIGING PROGRESIBO ANG HEALTHCARE SA PILIPINAS KUNG PURO NA LANG SOCIAL BIASES AT DISKRIMINASYON. Nag breakdown talga aq hays knowing na may mga kabatch din akong sobrang pikit sa problema ng lipunan, paano pa kaya kung nag tatrabaho na sila.""Bakit di ka manghingi ng pera sa bf mo""""Di ko yun bf, tito ko""Para sa mga biktima ng sexual abuse, isang mahigpit na yakap. Dapat pa bang hintayin na maging biktima (rape, sa, etc) ang isang babae para lang masabi na may karapatan siyang mag pa abort? Lalo na sa mga kabataan, mygod tanginang mga matatandang mahilig sa mga walang kaalam-alam na bata. Kung sino pa may mas alam, sila pa maninira. Last na, yung scene na magkatabi si sunshine at ate niya rinig mo yung ulan habang binbanggit nung ate niya pangalan ni sunshine. nice symbolism na idk how to explainOverall, sulit yung gutom ko simula 5am to 4pm at nahabol ko oras sa sm masinag pagkauwi eheheGanda talaga ni Maris.

Sunshine,"“Sunshine” tackles urgent and relevant issues that are at the core of the current public health system in the Philippines. The film confronts the alarming rise in teenage pregnancies, a problem often worsen by a lack of sex education. It bravely addresses women's rights to choose, challenging the patriarchy that continues to influence societal norms in the country.The film's powerful message is that women have the right to be anything they want to be. They should have the final say over their bodies, their dreams, their choices, and their lives. No one should ever dictate who they are or what they can become. ""Sunshine"" makes a compelling case that a woman's decisions are her own, and outside opinions, particularly from men, are irrelevant. It is a story that empowers women, giving them a VOICE to be HEARD and a presence to be SEEN.""Sunshine"" is raw, relevant, and a catalyst for important conversations. It is not just a film; it is a reflection of the struggles faced by countless women. The movie fearlessly asks difficult questions and forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths. It's a story that deserves to be discussed by everyone, because Sunshine is more than just a character—she is a symbol of HOPE and COURAGE. Maris Racal's portrayal of Sunshine is the best. She perfectly captures the reality of a woman's struggle and the immense difficulty of navigating life in this world. The supporting cast is equally remarkable. Jennica Garcia and Annika Co deliver powerful performances that are essential to the film's impact. Every cast in this film was remarkable.A big big thank you to Direk Tonet Jadaone for her bravery and boldness in telling this story. Your work is consistently admirable because you don't just make films; you spark meaningful conversations that resonate long after the credits roll.Hindi mahirap maging babae sa mundo kung sa umpisa pa lang ang BABAE ay merong sariling desisyon para sa sarili nila at di dinidiktahan ng kung sino man.",2025-08-02,positive,0.8924875855445862,1
Sunshine,"Everything is political when you're a woman! Our healthcare, our lives, our choices... It is all political...These are the reasons why I am a feminist. Filipino women deserve better healthcare!!! Filipino women deserve to have a choice!!! Filipino women are more than being mothers— they are nurses, doctors, teachers, engineers, artists, gymnasts, and so much more. Kaya gustong gusto ko yung confrontation scene na iginiit ni Sunshine kayna Miggy na ayaw niyang maging nanay. WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR THEMSELVES.Living in a really conservative religious country is hell for women nga naman. We are bound to be shamed kahit anong gawin natin. Nakakaiyak na tinitiis na lang naming mga babae ang sistemang hindi naman ginawa para saamin. Kapag nabuntis, sasabihan na malandi. Kapag gustong magpalaglag, immoral. Kapag ayaw maging nanay, makasarili. Saan na lang kami lulugar sa bansang ito???? Kahit ang simpleng karapatan sa quality healthcare ipinagdadamot pa! Maraming salamat direk tonet sa paggawa ng napakagandang pelikula na to. From the cinematoraphy to the sounds to the script! Napakahusay. Yung shots don sa hotel scene and yung ingay ng LRT grabe i think that sums up the whole movie. Kuhang-kuha ang ingay at gulo ng Maynila. Ang Maynila na puno ng gulo at pangarap.

Sunshine,"overheard a girl in the restroom saying “at least mabait si [yung character] piolo” and maybe thats what makes this film effective and horrifying. patriarchalism masks itself in kindness, in family values, religious salvation, in medicine, in the thought of care. we are so deeply entangled in its edifice we cannot decipher care from control. against the backdrop of the sticky, restless, and noisy streets of manila, Sunshine becomes a suffocating experience. a formidable display of how patriarchy is insidious. even the reactions of the women around sunshine are outcomes of its thinking, sometimes its intentional, sometimes unaware. the judgement and unsolicited advice are concealed as concern and even sunshine herself isn’t free from it. it is literally manifested as an imaginary child that echoes her guilt, pressure, and the moral burden thats placed upon her. There are moments where its subtexts are parallel to Ernaux’s memoir Happening, which is visceral in its honesty about seeking abortion in 60s France, a time where it was illegal there. But Sunshine is dangerously current. Abortion remains illegal in the country because religion and patriarchy is deeply etched that it is indistinguishable from moral law (yet pamparegla pills in quiapo sit on the same shelves as statues of the infant jesus and still our agency must somehow exist in conflict with holiness.) in the final act, Sunshine’s choice is physically expressed through a routine. her movements make it seem her body is being wrapped in ribbons, constricted and suffocating, but as she continues, the bindings are loosened and ultimately released. the film’s profundity lies in its portrayal of abortion not as something easy nor devoid of consequences. it is contradicting: physically and emotionally excruciating but undeniably life saving.",2025-08-01,positive,0.9356765747070312,9

Sunshine,"Sunshine is an important film—one that Filipinos shouldn’t miss. It’s not the strongest film, but it’s certainly worth discussing.In fact, it currently tops my list of Filipino movies this year. And that’s precisely why I feel a sense of disappointment. At the very least, I wish it had resonated more deeply. It had the potential to delve further into its realism, but instead, it chose to spoon-feed every emotional beat, leaving little room for quiet reflection. While I understand why Jadaone took this direction, I can’t say it worked for me.Personally, I wasn’t fully sold on the use of children as a narrative device. The way the film delivers its message too overtly makes the subplot involving the 13-year-old feel disconnected and distracting. The child character might have been more effective as a symbolic presence, her inner voice, her conscience. Had it stayed that way, rather than taking the more problematic route of literally giving life to unborn children, as in Ariana’s case, the film might have delivered a far more powerful impact.Still, there was a moment near the end, a line that marked a turning point of understanding and acceptance, where freedom was finally felt from guilt. That scene alone earned the film a 9 out of 10 from me.",2025-08-02,positive,0.6886397004127502,1

Sunshine,"The OB admitting section was, and still is, one of the busiest parts of the hospital I worked in as an intern. It had been renovated prior to my first duty there, and it would be renovated once again after I'd left. Both of those renovations were done in part to address a persistent issue: that the place never runs out of patients. Every day, and especially on Mondays and Fridays, the admitting section would take in a significant number of expectant mothers with all sorts of conditions. Some would be giving birth for the first time. Some were veterans who were familiar to the staff working there, giving birth like clockwork every year. Some had serious conditions alongside their pregnancies that made giving birth extremely complicated, to the point where their current state posed a significant risk for death while giving birth. Nevertheless, they would slowly fill up the adjacent labor and delivery room, often two to three mothers to a stretcher. On very busy days the stretchers would run out, and the labor room would be filled with mothers settling down wherever they could, mostly on the cold, tiled floor.I remembered those days in the admitting section when I saw Antoinette Jadaone's latest film, Sunshine, about a young gymnast (Maris Racal) who gets pregnant right before a very important event that might lead to the SEA games and eventually the Olympics. Sunshine doesn't have any qualms about making the decision as she immediately gets to work trying to find an abortifacient to terminate the unwanted pregnancy. This process is not made easy. Miggy (Elijah Canlas), the man who impregnated Sunshine, wants nothing to do with her after learning of her pregnancy. He doesn't even tell her to have an abortion directly, only saying that 'she knows what to do.' Getting medical help is equally difficult, and intersects gender with class: medical treatment is expensive (despite the fact that state sponsored healthcare should be financially accessible) and as abortion is still illegal in the Philippines, people resort to black markets to seek the care they need.Once in a while, the OB admitting section will receive a patient who has lost her child. Miscarriages are common, and often they are spontaneous. Once, a mother of a stillborn child asked me if the cries in the next room were her child's, when I knew the infant was lying in a box, ready to be given to back to their parents. Then there are the other kinds of patients, ones who made a choice like Sunshine. They all had their reasons; this was a conscious and informed decision. After a while you know it when they come in. Sometimes the doctor would come in and tell them that what they did was illegal, some would even threaten to call the police. Nothing ever came of it; they were empty threats - often to 'scare' them into not making that decision again. It always made me uncomfortable.To be born a woman is to be born into violence, into a world where the odds are stacked against you. Sunshine is not the first film to depict this violence - films like Rae Red's Babae at Baril (2019) and Jadaone's own Fan Girl (2020) are two examples. They show what a deeply patriarchal society creates: people like Miggy and a certain other character near the end, people who I interpreted as not exactly archetypal or allegorical towards the structures that created them, but as the inevitable products of it. But unlike those two films that I mentioned earlier, Sunshine feels far more indignant, full of anger that Fan Girl lacked, and drawing towards a different conclusion compared to Babae at Baril.Quiapo has been a backdrop for many a Filipino film, and here it is a sanctuary of sorts. It is here where Sunshine goes to find the solution to her problems. Ironically draped in religious imagery, it both embodies the faith it represents (as a source of refuge for those who are in need) and as something that stands against its tenets.Sunshine is a film about choices: the choice to live one's own dream, the choice to live freely as the best person you can be. Sunshine's sister Geleen (Jennica Garcia) coaches Sunshine as she practices in their shared home. Certain background elements (thanks to the film's excellent production design) hint that Geleen, too, was once an aspiring gymnast, whose dreams ended with a baby. If she had the choice, would she have lived a different life? It shows as well in Geleen's character, and Garcia gives a standout performance as her.Finally, that idea of ""refuge"" may not refer to Quiapo, but something else entirely. Throughout the film there are many people, both seen and unseen, who help Sunshine in her quest. ""Ipagdadasal ko kayo,"" a hilot tells Sunshine after they bring a child to the hospital who made the same choice. ""Mag-ingat ka,"" another one tells Sunshine as she sets off. A sympathetic medical professional gives a knowing look. Every doctor has a story like it: in one of my last rotations at the labor room, a patient walked in nervously in the robe the hospital supplied her. It was a very busy day, and pregnant women overflowed on the stretchers and sat on the floor. She had no business being here: she looked no older than 14, and she should be going to school and playing with friends, not in the last stages of giving birth. Suffice it to say, this pregnancy was not her choice. If she had the choice like Sunshine did, would she be here? On the other hand, the point of the film for me is not whether one makes one choice over the other, but that people like Sunshine and that kid has the ability to choose in the first place.Because the labor and delivery room should be semi-sterile, companions (in this case, the kid's very worried mother) are not allowed in. But the rest of the mothers in that labor room heard us taking the medical history and heard her story. The other expectant mothers gave the kid their blankets, talked to and comforted her, up until she gave birth. Everyone was that kid's mother that day. In a world where you are denied agency, where one is subjected to violence from birth, the least women can do is find refuge in each other.",2025-07-31,positive,0.9403328895568848,2

SHE IS ALWAYS GOING THROUGH IT. she goes beyond her past roles all the time.may this film truly help and get the message through when it comes to the real-world necessities our women need. when it comes to reproductive health, nothing is just for convenience. and it’s not only about the ending—it’s ALSO about how important it is to equip the youth with the actual, necessary knowledge about the topic. it’s not something that should be hushed. let our women know what they can do for themselves, and what they should never allow men—or anyone else—to decide for them!!! at higit sa lahat, itigil ang ipokrisya!!! bilang katoliko at pilipino, how do we manage to continue in shaming other people? there SHOULD always be room for conversations pero laging pinapangunahan ng pamamahiya, ng pagtawag ng mga pangalan when kindness should always be the one upfront ?!!! dahil sa wrong order of priority, hindi nakikita ng tao yung tunay na pinagdadaanan ng ibang bumoboses at humihingi ng tulong.",2025-08-01,positive,0.9937999844551086,39

Sunshine,"Maris and the rest of the cast were perfectly chosen for the film, with each character making a meaningful contribution to the plot. Maliban sa acting and galing galing din ni maris sa mismong mga gymnast performances niya!!To be honest, I initially found Sunshine disturbing and lacking in many parts. It felt like the film held back, especially in its screenplay and pacing. But as I reflected more on it, I realized that might have been the point—although many of the scenes were commendably filmed, the film wasn’t trying to entertain; it was trying to confront. Maliban sa mismong tema ng storya, sobrang daming iba pang paghihirap na danas ng lipunan natin na mismo ako ay hindi aware ang naipakita sa pelikula.The rawness and silence I initially perceived as weaknesses were actually reflections of Sunshine herself—caught between the pressures of gymnastics and the weight of her misfortunes. In that light, I came to see that her quietness was powerful and already served as the message.The film was created not just to tell Sunshine’s story, but to help us recognize the many ""Sunshines"" around us—especially in the Philippines, where abortion remains heavily stigmatized due to political control and religious conservatism. Sunshine challenges us to understand their pain and see their urgent need for help.I truly hope that someday, those in power will recognize that safe and legal abortion is not just a debate—it’s a right every Filipina deserves to have.",2025-08-01,positive,0.9077475666999817,-1

Saliéndose del margen seguro y cómodo que tiene acostumbradas a las masas a la complacencia social retratada en un romanticismo casi cínico de la pobreza y la glorificación del poder y la influencia, además de la necesidad por rectitud religiosa. La cinta, desarrollándose sin teatralidad ni grandes despliegues telenoveleros de drama, entiende perfectamente que la sobriedad y sequedad de la realidad filipina de la clase baja no necesita endulzantes para trabajar de manera efectiva y cortante en pantalla. La cinematografía es excelente, el ritmo es perfecto y las tomas se toman todo el tiempo necesario para declarar visualmente sus ideas, además de que la dirección si bien denota algunos rastros y pequeños momentos de la desconexión farandulera moderna del voyerismo cínico que nos fuerza a sentir lastima por la pobreza, no cae totalmente en ello, demostrando mucha fuerza y entendimiento la gran parte del tiempo.",2025-08-02,positive,0.9532753825187683,1
Sunshine,"sunshine explored important and sensitive topics that are not only necessary for filipino audience to see but also essential to open dialogues and conversations, to shed light on and ultimately to spark change especially on things that are often labeled as taboo in a conservative and retrogressive country like the philippines.the film does not impose, it only depicts the struggles of the character. it shows her grit, resilience and her power to decide for herself. sunshine is a beautiful portrayal of a woman’s ability to choose and her autonomy to determine her fate. despite the living ironies she’s confronted with, she remains hopeful, that she could still follow her dreams and that she could rule over her life against all odds. she doesn’t have to conform. no one else could dictate how her story goes but her.sunshine does not necessarily promote pre-marital sex or abortion. it goes beyond issues of healthcare and reproductive health. it advocates empathy and compassion to the sunshines of the world. it allows us to understand the complexities and the silent pains and plights women go through and why there’s a need for them to have access to safe and equitable options.",2025-08-01,positive,0.9898518919944763,1

Sunshine,"set the scene. modern-day manila, a city equally bound by the abundance of opportunity as it is bound by the abundance of consequence. sunshine is a dreamer tied to the goal of becoming an olympian. she is told to drown out the noise while she lives a life enclosed by it. she gets pregnant by a good for nothing conyo elijah canlas and is told that her poverty-stricken ass should carry the burden of aborting the baby. and of all places, she finds herself in quiapo, manila’s catholic landmark, praying to Jesus as she repeatedly journeys through the downtown in her search for the most effective pills while surrounded by statues of Mary, her conscience carrying the loudest whispers that deem her a murderer, echoed by the church she sought forgiveness in—and the very God she prays to.there exists an assumption about the matriarchal philippines, a country that holds its female sensibilities to the highest regard in the same way it adores Mary. yet as we are exposed to our society’s deepest cancers, the mask of matriarchy only rings true for as long as it submits to the role of patriarchy and as a result, we are a nation of contradictions because of this reality. only in the philippines you can see a catholic girl pocketing abortion pills in a church. sunshine is no Mary, and manila is no matriarchy. her conscience rides through a push and pull with the conservative ideals she was brought upon. her best friend briefly ditches her out of familial pressure. her ex’s family (hi papa p) barges in their house to own up to the mistake. sunshine’s life is filled to the brim with contradiction. in spite of this, even with her lack of maturity and the ever-so demanding backdrop of a patriarchal manila, there remains glimmers of hope, her own thriving matriarchy within the small space she can truly call her own. an environment not bound by fluctuating contradiction, but by the permanence of choice.",2025-08-02,positive,0.9688493609428406,1

THE 'GETS KO NA' SCENEEE FUCCCCKKK ANG LUHA KOOOHH :(( and its even more beautiful kasi that also reflects to annika in real life because she fully understood the role she played in the film :( na para bang mas open-minded pa siya sa karamihan ng mga matatanda sa atin. sobrang dami kong luhang binuhos sa sunshine at sobrang dami ko ring natutunan. sobrang raw at sobrang vulnerable — kinda ironic pero ayun yung naging strength ng pelikulang ito. mahal na mahal ko mga likha ni direk tonet. grabe. one of the best directors of her time.

Sunshine,"""Ang pangarap ko ay pangarap niya."" This line, spoken by the child, sums up the entire film. It’s simple, heartfelt, and my favorite line. People may have their own interpretations, but this is how I personally understood it.Sunshine has an older sister, Ate Geleen, played by Jennica Garcia. Ate Geleen was once a gymnast, just like Sunshine. But now, she takes care of her child. The film doesn’t say it outright, but it’s clear that Ate Geleen gave up her dreams and career to raise her baby. Why did she give it all up? We don't know. But maybe it’s because she’s the eldest daughter — the one expected to take care of her siblings, the one who is supposed to work harder, sacrifice more, and carry the heaviest weight.Mahirap maging babae, lalo na kung ikaw ang panganay na anak ng pamilya.Maybe that’s also the very reason why she’s so supportive of Sunshine’s decision — to have an abortion, to chase her dreams, and to not follow in her footsteps. Ate Geleen knows exactly what it’s like to give up everything, and she doesn’t want her younger sister to carry the same burden she did.The movie ended with Ate Geleen proudly looking at Sunshine while holding her baby. Dahil ang pangarap ni Sunshine ay siya ring pangarap ni Ate Geleen na hindi niya natupad.",2025-07-28,positive,0.9546473026275635,-1

Sunshine,"Natawa ako sa simula. Like I love how Sunshine visited QUIAPO Church first, then went to Miggy's school ALL THE WAY in DEL MONTE AVE, QUEZON CITY (Sha Tin in the background and I recognize Miggy's school), smashed his car in his school's parking spot, then ran TO RECTO AVE, MANILA to avoid being caught  Never skipped leg day si Sunshine.On a serious note, I love how it is way much more than a pro-choice/pro-abortion movie. It champions compassion and understanding first through the many hardships that pregnancy poses in a country where abortion is very much illegal. It's uncomfortable at times, heartbreaking at others, but in spite of the pain and desperation, it's also empathetic at times too, like with Thea and Sunshine's siblings. Love her sister especially.The only reason why I gave it a 4.5 stars is because there are some... SOME moments where nabitin ako, like I wish the runtime could be a little longer so we could flesh out some aspects of the film, like Doc Helena, Migs and his dad, and the ending, to name some.Overall, I'm SOO GLAD I saw this film.

Sunshine,"Sunshine was an entity of her own. As consistent as the celestial body her name was derived from, she was stern on her decision up until the end of the film. The rawness of the film venturing into the the ""sketchy"" streets of Quiapo, digs into shady transactions covered under the mountains of skyways clouded with ignorance over what minorities have to deal with. How does our devotion and concept of purity outweigh the dangers underlying in pregnancy or becoming a mother when one isn't ready to give everything up for a child they bore out of guilt? Or is this just something they choose to turn a blind eye to when the higher-ups knowingly have put women's lives in the gravest situations yet again?Releasing this film in the midst of a conservative country was a bold critique of the proper healthcare we're deprived of, but it was also a cry from all women who deserve better.",2025-08-02,positive,0.9284676909446716,1

Sunshine,"let me just say na MARIS RACAL IS SUCH AN AMAZING ACTRESS. totoong haggard nga siya (lol), pero ‘yung haggardness niya, that actually added to everything. you can see the pain, the exhaustion, and the heaviness in every scene—it all felt so real.. grabe, nakakamangha talaga siyang panoorin. sobrang husay niya, and because of that, sunshine didn’t feel like a film at all—it felt like someone letting you into her world. it felt like sunshine was sitting beside me, telling her story, and all i could do was listen and feel everything.from the very beginning, klaro na kay sunshine kung ano ang gusto niya. hindi ang maging nanay, kundi ang makasali sa Philippines' national gymnastics team. but the world she lives in kept pushing her into a corner. this film tackled more than just abortion—it exposed how cruel the system is to women, lalo na sa pilipinas. it showed the weight of religious beliefs forced onto our bodies, the cycle of abuse, and the daily injustices women face just for existing. napakahirap maging babae sa pilipinas tangina.lahat ng lalaki sa pelikula—si miggy, 'yung tito ni menggay, si tatay ni miggy, pati ‘yung doktor—lahat sila, galit na galit ako. bakit babae lagi ang kailangang mag-sakripisyo? bakit babae ang kailangang mag-adjust, magpatawad, magtiis? putangina talaga. and yet, these characters weren’t exaggerated. they were too real. which makes it even more terrifying—kasi alam nating totoo ‘to. it happens. it’s still happening.what haunted me most were menggay’s scenes. dun talaga ako tuluyang naiyak. ang sakit sakit. gusto ko siyang yakapin, gusto ko siyang ipagtanggol. bata pa lang siya pero pasan na niya 'yung bigat ng mundong hindi naman niya kasalanan. sana sa lahat ng menggay, may sunshine sa buhay nila. and then there was anikka. nung una, akala ko multo siya o guni-guni lang. pero habang tumatagal, i realized—she was sunshine’s imaginary child. or maybe her younger self. or both. she represents so much: a lost dream, a piece of sunshine. kaya ‘yung eksena sa dulo, when anikka said “gets ko na,” it wasn’t just her talking—it was also sunshine finally accepting her own decision. grabe ‘yung iyak ko dun. that should be enough. a woman’s choice should be enough.the film also showed that women, at our best, are each other’s safe space. si coach, si doktora, yung kaibigan, most especially ‘yung ate niya—lahat sila, may dalang simpatya. yung presence nila nagsasabing “nandito ako.” yung scene na tumabi yung ate niya sa higaan sobrang nakakalungkot panoorin. it reminded me that the first place we should feel supported is at home. buti na lang at nandiyan ang ate ni sunshine dahil minsan sapat na ‘yung maramdaman mong hindi ka nag-iisasunshine isn’t just a movie. it’s a wake-up call. it asks us to reflect—bakit tayo mabilis humusga? bakit kulang ang pag-unawa? and most of all, bakit kailangang maging matatag ang babae para lang mabuhay nang payapa? sunshine is a beautiful, heartbreaking, and necessary film. hindi lang siya basta panoorin. kailangan mo siyang damdamin. hindi ka niya pipilitin, pero hahayaan ka niyang mag-reflect, in your own time and your own way.huge congratulations to everyone who worked on this film. sana mas maraming makapanood. sana mas maraming makaintindi",2025-08-01,positive,0.8521168231964111,-1

When I finished watching it, I already knew the state and how our society would portray abortion and how it was always deemed evil and inhumane but after seeing this film, I felt a sense of relief that finally, a film about women, about abortion, about its effects, not just mentally but physically, and how sometimes, we really just have to understand, for who are we to judge someone who really is just fighting to live through and view women in a way that they should be, respected.Even the supporting characters—especially Jennica Garcia—were brilliant. I felt her love for her sister so deeply. Even when Sunshine thought the world had turned its back on her, her sister’s presence was a constant reminder that someone was still there, always beside her, fully aware of the struggles she faced—struggles made heavier because she’s a woman.Also a huge role that was portrayed by Rhed Bustamante. Just, wow. It was a story meant to be told and written. It isn't just fiction it's currently happening today and that's why it should be a story that needed to be shed light on. It was tragic, painful to look at but it was real, all of it, and that's what makes it a story worth telling.And Maris Racal—what a phenomenal actress. Her cries pierce right through you. Her frustration, her courage, her strength as a woman—all of it shines through. In Sunshine, I saw her desperation, her bravery, her womanhood, and her relentless grasp on her dreams, refusing to let them slip away.Maris and Direk Tonet knew exactly what they wanted to tell their audience, and I’m so glad they did it with such courage. They gave voice to women like Sunshine—women who are still too afraid to scream their truths.I hope this film becomes a beacon for people like Sunshine, the way she brings life to every twirl of her ribbon and every movement of her body to the rhythm. There are so many like her still hidden in the shadows of fear and guilt. And yes, we all know that in the Philippines, some mindsets are hard to change—but does it have to stop there? Will we allow people like Sunshine to remain caged by a judgmental society?Maybe for now, it’s hard. But because of this film, women like Sunshine can finally catch a glimpse of hope.:’)",2025-08-02,positive,0.993693470954895,-1

Sunshine,"Honestly, 3.5 stars for the movie overall, but here's extra 0.5 star for the super random cameo that was also somehow super on the nose. It's such a good bit that amuses me to no end. I'd rate the movie higher if not for a plot device that felt completely unnecessary and at times distracting. Take it away, and it won't even change anything about the movie. Every time they employed this plot device, it was just so unnecessary and distracting. The movie also squeezed in too many ""unwanted pregnancy"" tropes that it risked being too bloated story-wise. Think of an ""unwanted pregancy"" trope, it's there. They stop short of it being too bloated at the expense of the story (and you have to give it to Antoinette Jadaone for this balancing act), though I still spent a good chunk of the movie wondering how many more tropes were coming. Still the movie is brave, and is made so much better for its bravery. It does not shy away from the realities faced by so many women in this country when it comes to maternal health. It tackled head-on the heavily religious overtones that tends to dominate the conversations around this topic. It shows the ironic juxtaposition of abortion pills being sold next to religious artifacts. But most importantly, it does not get preachy. It does not feel like it is patronizing the audience about what should be in each scene that squeezes your heart, it just shows it. But also Jennica Garcia steals the show in every scene is in. Maris Racal deserves the accolades she's getting for carrying the movie so steadily as its lead and with everything asked of her for the character. But Jennica Garcia just commands every scene even she doesn't say a word. And every scene these two have together was really gold-medal worthy.",2025-08-02,positive,0.972047746181488,0

Sunshine,"ok ito na ang review ko na hindi naman ganun ka-relevant (???) CHARpero kailangan ko lang ‘to ilabas before anything else: maris racal is THE doja cat of the philippines, controversial-wise. bakit? GIRL… kasi kahit anong gawin ni maris na “cancellable”, hindi talaga siya ma-cancel because she’s just THAT good. GETS BA!!! pruweba lang ‘to na ang cancel culture ay hindi totoo… chrue?OK ITO NA TALAGA. this is it.mula sa pinanood ko, hindi lang basta-bastang pelikula ang sunshine. given na ‘yung magandang konsepto, storyline, casting, at setting ng pelikula pero gusto ko lang mas i-highlight ‘yung fact na kahit ba sobrang taboo ng “abortion” topic sa pilipinas, direk tonet did what NEEDS to be done and i mean, talk about IT. sa malawak na masang pilipino, kailangan nilang maintindihan na hindi pwedeng tanggapin na lamang ng bawat babaeng maagang nabuntis na dadalhin nila ito hanggang sa mabuhay ang sanggol. hindi. kasi may mas malawak pang diskusyon labas sa pagbubuntis at ito ang kapalpakan ng sistemang kinagisnan ng karamihan.kung maglalaan ng oras ang administrasyon sa pag-aaral hinggil sa kahalagahan ng abortion sa pilipinas, mas gagaan ang buhay ng bawat pilipinang maagang nabuntis. gaya ni sunshine, hindi na nila kailangan pang dumaan sa peligrosong proseso upang ipalaglag ang pagdadalang-tao nila dahil aksisable, at ligal na ito. pero sa lagay ng bansa natin ngayon, mukhang wala pa tayo sa kalingkingan ng pagsasabatas nito dahil tila mangmang ang mga mambabatas na iniluklok sa pwesto. malayo pa ang tatahakin ng bawat pilipino sa lipunang patuloy na binubura ang mga progresibo pero ang mga pelikula gaya ng sunshine, ay isa lamang sa maraming paraan upang manghamig, magmulat, at pakilusin ang masang patuloy na inaapi laban sa mapanamantalang sistema na kinalakihan natin.suportahan natin ang mga lokal na pelikula. suportahan natin ang larangan ng sining. suportahan natin ang sariling atin.#MakeAbortionLegal #AbortionIsNotMurder",2025-08-01,positive,0.8238145112991333,-1

Sunshine,"It’s been a while since I last watched a movie alone. I actually asked my partner first if it was okay to watch Sunshine without him—he’s not really into Filipino films, and I totally respect that. But something about this movie pulled me in.And I’m glad I watched it. Sunshine shook me. It’s not just a film—it’s a mirror of what’s really happening around us. It hit hard, especially thinking about those who’ve gone through abuse—women, children, even the ones who never had the courage to speak up.Sure, there were a few funny scenes—maybe to ease the weight of the story—but the truth behind it stays. It’s heavy, it’s real, and it’s heartbreaking.We can’t just look away anymore. These kids and young women who’ve lived through this kind of nightmare… they need to be seen, heard, and protected. Because maybe—we are their last hope. And that means something.",2025-08-02,positive,0.9906573295593262,1

The line “gets ko na” struck me deeply; it’s both empowering and eye-opening. Every woman in the country should see this, as it sheds light on the difficult experiences many go through. The story is raw, relevant and it is worth talking about. It’s a bold feminist film that reminds us we all sunshine in our own unique ways and we continue to wait for sunshine. Every woman has the right to make decisions about her body and her future. Thank you so much, Direk Tonet, for creating this important piece.",2025-08-02,positive,0.9933308959007263,24

She was just there, fully present in every scene. Manila looked exactly how we know it. Crowded, humid, alive, and heavy.Sceeenplay wise, it was honest and not trying hard. A lot of those lines I’ve heard in real conversations. It just shows you what it’s like to be a woman in this country with no access to reproductive rights and safe and legal abortion. I hope Sunshine helps start more open and honest conversations. Reproductive health is still treated like something dirty in the PH. Women suffer quietly, and most people pretend not to see.The story is simple, but the path it takes is so clear. From beginning to end, it doesn’t stray. I was honestly scared it would compromise somewhere along the way, but it didn’t. It stayed brave.Antoinette Jadaone, you are so brave!!! Seriously. It takes guts to make something like this here.

Sunshine,"Sunshine sa Kuko ng MaynilaKasama ng mga pelikulang may “maynila” sa titulo na kamakailan ko lang napanood, bukod sa pagpupunit ng bandila ng konserbatibong paniniwala na nagmula sa kristiyanismo, pinapakita din ng Sunshine ang siyudad ng Maynila sa gabi—kung saan imbes na pag-asa, sumpa ang pangunahing kaluluwa na hinihinga’t tinitiis ng mga mamamayan. Sa labas ng simbahan makikita ang mga illegal na medesinang pampalaglag na nagsisilbi bilang pagasa para sa maraming kababaihan marahil ang institusyon sa harapan ng mga tindahang ito, ang simbahan, ang may kapangyarihan kahit na sabihing progresibo na ang mga paniniwala ng tao. Sa isang eksena, si Sunshine ay nagbuwis buhay sa isang masikip na motel sa Avenida, dala dala ang boteng pampalaglag, nagdudugo, nanghihingalo palabas habang patuloy ang pagtakbo ng LRT, at nagising nalang sa ospital, puno ng mga babaeng tinitiis ang hindi makataong pampublikong pasilidad.Halos 500 teenager ang nagiging ina araw araw. Kung legal lamang ang pagpapalaglag, ang mga numerong ito’y mababawasan. Isa sa may pinaka mabigat na istorya ay ang karakter ni Rhed Bustamante na si Menggay, isang 13 taong gulang na binuntis ng kaniyang tito. Kaniyang sinusundan si Sunshine at ibang mga babae, upang humingi ng pampalaglag. Nililibot niya ang Maynila na may tiyang di nararapat para sa isang dalaga. Tulad ni Sunshine, si Menggay ay pinadala rin sa ospital. Ngunit di natin siyang nakitang gumising. Ang pelikula ni Jadaone ay paniguradong titignan ng mga iskolar bilang “classic” makalipas ang ilang taon, tulad ng Manila by Night at Maynila Sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag. Isa sa mga susi ng pagtatagumpay ng storyang ito ay naiintindihan nito ang mga karakter na kinekwento bilang mga tao at hindi lamang teksto. Madaling tapusin ang mga pelikulang may realismo sa trahedya ngunit hindi pinili ni Jadaone ang direksyong iyon. Ang titulong “Sunshine” ay sumisimbolo rin sa diwa ng Pilipino—madalas masiyahin at nakakahanap pa rin ng ilaw sa madidilim na eskenita, matatatag (o resilient). Dahil tayo’y kilala sa ganitong paraan, madali tayong abusuhin ng ating gobyerno. Labag raw sa batas ng diyos ang pagpapalaglag ng bata ngunit sa ganitong pagiisip, sa pagproprotekta ng mga hindi pa naisisilang, pinapatay ang ating mga kababaihan. Ngunit isa sa mga ipinakita sa pelikulang ito ay ang mga babae na nakikiramay kay Sunshine, kahit man ito’y makulit na bata, o kapatid na nagsilbing nanay, o kahit mga babae sa post maternal ward na nakakaintindi ng sakit na nadarama ng karakter ni Maris Racal at ang mga Sunshine sa Pilipinas. Mahaba pa ang magiging lakbay patungo sa bansang kayang tumanggap na isang karapatan ng babae ang awtonomiya ng kaniyang katawan, ngunit sa pelikulang ito, at sa pagdami ng mga manonood, nagkakaroon ng espayo upang magbukas ang mga usaping tinuturing “taboo”.",2025-08-01,positive,0.6970081925392151,12

Sunshine,"This is the kind of film I want to see.I had huge expectations for this movie before I came to the theater to watch it, and it did not at all disappoint. It didn’t, in any way, fall short of anything I hoped for. From the direction to the casting, sobrang ganda… and I wish I were exaggerating.Una, Antoinette Jadaone, what a director you are. Throughout the movie, the words “Ang galing” kept escaping my mouth. The camera angles were beautiful, the timing of the sound production was marvelous, the screenplay was solid—everything was on point. Sunshine satisfied my standards for aesthetics when it comes to film.Pangalawa, Maris. Hands down—sobrang talentadong babae talaga. Setting her issue aside, she’s a versatile actress. She embodied Sunshine so well that I felt myself completely absorbed in the story. Dagdag pa riyan si Jennica Garcia, another golden star. I knew her through Saving Grace, and doon pa lang, sobrang namangha na ako sa kakayahan niya. I need to see her in more films. Halos lahat naman kung tutuusin—they have done a tremendous job with their performances. Everything felt so real.Pangatlo, the script? Hello? Ang natural. It wasn’t like her other directed movie, Uninvited, na puro mura. This time, it was profanity with purpose. (haha) The lines were written and delivered so well that it made me stop and think how observing plays such a vital role in every profession. Lalo na rito. Kaya tagos sa puso, kasi totoo. Nangyayari ‘to.At panghuli, the hidden message. In every movie, I like to believe that there’s at least a little advocacy screaming through every minute. In this case, it’s the consideration of legalizing abortion in the Philippines. Maraming mga hindi kayang bumuhay ng anak, mga hindi kayang sustentahan ang isang tao, at mga taong sinamantala lamang. Even with these reasons, is it still not right to consider abortion? One might counter, “Pwede mo namang ipaalaga sa kamag-anak o sa mga magulang.” But the truth is: life is much more complex than that. It is so much more complicated because there are cases like this in real life, where the only family they have is their siblings... Some only have themselves.…Hays, basta abstinence talaga dapat guys!I love everything about this movie. I love how it depicts the reality some pregnant teenagers go through—even those who have dreams. I believe I have more to say, but I’d like to reflect on that myself. Just keep a bit of Sunshine all to me.That's how deeply it hit me.",2025-08-02,positive,0.9926895499229431,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine.Akala mo pabebe title. Pero nope.Pinasabog ako emotionally. Walang pasintabi.At this point, masasabi ko na isa ito sa mga pinakamagandang pelikulang Pilipinong napanood ko. Walang pilit na patawa. Walang palamig. May saysay, may sipa, at may kirot na hindi mo pwedeng balewalain. May mga eksenang uncomfortable pero kailangan.Kasi minsan, ang totoong kwento, hindi masarap panoorin.Pero dapat.The storytelling?Putcha. Tahimik pero mabangis. Hindi ito yung tipo ng pelikula na sasabihin sa’yo kung ano ang tama o mali. Ipapakita lang niya tapos bahala ka sa internal crisis mo after. May bits na parang sinaksak ka sa puso pero may ngiti ka pa rin sa labi. Kasi ganon katalino ang pagkakasulat. Simple lang ang galaw ng camera, pero lahat ng eksena may laman. Lahat ng katahimikan, may sigaw.Maris Racal bilang Sunshine?Grabe. Ang natural. Parang hindi umaarte, pero ramdam mo bawat pikit, bawat buntong-hininga, bawat patak ng luha.And for the rest of the cast?Jennica, Meryll, Elijah, Annika, Rhed. Kung may acting Olympics, podium lahat ‘to.And the themes?Feminism na hindi lecture. Commentary na hindi sermon. May mga eksenang tatahimik ka after. Yung tipong mapapaisip ka: “Shit. Ako ba ‘yung pinatatamaan?” Oo, bes. Tayong lahat. Kasi lahat tayo may ambag sa double standards na tinotolerate natin araw-araw.Hindi ito ‘yung tipong pelikulang minadali. Sunshine is crafted, not just created.Hindi lang siya ginawa para may mapanood. Sunshine is a film that meant something and moved with purpose.Hindi siya sumisigaw ng “tignan mo ako.” Pero hindi mo rin siya kayang i-ignore. It sits with you. Stays with you. Makes you ask things you usually avoid.At sa ending, walang fireworks. Walang dramatic breakdown, walang moral lesson na pilit. Pero andun yung bigat. Yung linaw. Yung paninindigan.Sunshine made a choice: tahimik, matatag, at alam niyang hindi lahat makakaintindi. Pero hindi rin niya kailangang ipaliwanag. Katawan niya ’yon. Buhay niya ’yon.At sa pagpili niya, may kirot, oo. Pero may ginhawa rin. May lungkot, pero may pag-asa. Kasi for once, isang babaeng Pilipina ang pinayagang pumili para sa sarili niya, at hindi siya pinarusahan.Hindi siya ginawang trahedya.Ginawa siyang posibilidad.At sana mas dumami pa ang ganitong kwento, yung mga kwentong hindi sinusukat sa sakripisyo kundi sa kalayaan. Yung mga babaeng hindi inaasahang sumunod, kundi tinuturuang magtanong ng: “Ano ba talaga ang gusto ko? At handa ba akong ipaglaban ito?”Because at the end of the day, whether it’s about your career, your body, or your future, ikaw dapat ang may final say. Hindi ang mundo. Hindi ang ingay. Hindi ang kahon na kung saan gusto nilang ipagsiksikan ka.Kung saan ka masaya, kung saan ka buo, doon ka tama.",2025-08-02,negative,0.763340950012207,12

Sunshine,"to live in a society where your most personal decisions are controlled by external forces and outdated structures… it’s exhausting.after watching the film today, i found myself deep in thought as i left the cinema. it was so real and raw. like, genuinely, an eye-opener. the film just beautifully, but also painfully, shows how interconnected everything is. your sex education, or lack thereof, impacts your healthcare system access, your personal moral compass, and of course, your dreams and your passion. it really hit home how incredibly hard it is to be a woman especially here in the philippines, with all our deeply ingrained religious beliefs, particularly around topics like abortion. it’s just so disheartening to hear all the harsh opinions and these strong pushes for anti-abortion laws, especially when they come from people who aren't personally dealing with those difficult, life-altering situations. it’s so easy for some to just state an anti-abortion stance, but the reality for a woman wrestling with such a complex decision is so much more nuanced and personal.you hear it all the time: choosing to terminate a pregnancy is selfish. but then i genuinely wonder, isn't it also selfish to bring a child into the world if you're not fully ready, or if you're uncertain about the future that motherhood brings? in a country that can be so conservative, we really, really need a broader, more compassionate discussion. we need to figure out how to support women and their choices, whatever they may be. not all women want to be mothers. not all women want to be impregnated. even i, personally, don't want to be a mother. and that's okay. it’s time we should be open to talking about these topics, really opening up our minds, and stop letting our religious beliefs completely go into our way of empathy and understanding. this movie just amplified that for me. ang galing galing mo, maris.",2025-08-02,positive,0.9740868210792542,-1

Sunshine,"“Saan ka pupunta?”—Di ko alam.“Mahirap ’yan. Tumatakbo at hindi alam kung saan ang pupuntahan.”These words pierce through the screen because they echo the confusion and helplessness felt by so many young women who were never taught what to do, only what not to become.The film refuses to sensationalize and instead, it exposes how a girl’s so-called mistake (often rooted not in her choices but in a partner’s negligence or acts of abuse) can lead to an avalanche of lost dreams, happiness, and possibility. Sunshine becomes every girl who was failed by sex education, every young woman silenced by stigma, and every teenager blamed instead of held.Running beneath the narrative is a critique of the Philippine healthcare system. Sunshine does not receive proper maternal support. She is not offered structured care, options, or safe counseling. Instead, she moves through her pregnancy in silence guided only by whispered advice, black market pills, and the cold gaze of people. Clinics do not offer refuge, hospitals feel clinical in the worst way. Rushed. Underfunded. Emotionally vacant. Healthcare here is not healing but a trauma repackaged as procedure.What I find striking is how the film threads the idea of stigma into the structure itself. It’s the system. How fear, silence, and judgment strip away any chance for recovery, much less dignity. And this is where Sunshine dares to challenge its viewers. The existence of this movie forces a confrontation. Sunshine doesn’t preach, but it demands to be seen. It tells the story of a girl who chose herself. In a world that expected her to stop, she kept going, and that choice changed everything.“Naiintindihan mo na ba ako?”—Gets ko na.",2025-08-03,negative,0.5825136303901672,-1

Super galing with the ribbon routines tho!]. big deal sya but she chose not to address the issue.me: she didn’t address the issue bc she is NOT ALLOWED to. That’s the whole point. Abortion is stigmatized, which doesn’t give girls much of a choice but to stay silent and afraid and ashamed.

Sunshine,"“Naiintindihan mo na ba ako?”That's how she basically ended that chapter. She’s aware sa ginawa niya, hindi niya kailangan pagsabihan pa siya na yung mga ginawa niya was wrong, illegal, or malaking kasalanan etc. And she doesn’t even deny that in the film. There were enough reasons laid out throughout the film validates her choice, and you see the life that she leads. The hallucination of her own child is her own manifestation of the guilt that haunts her — which tells you she still has hesitations and ramdam niya yung kahihiyan ng mga desisyon niya. You can mourn all you want about the potential of these unborn fetuses that “could’ve” changed our world. Pero paano naman yung mga Sunshine na buhay at may pangarap? What if they’re the ones capable of changing the world?

Sunshine,"Para sa isang lipunan kung saan nalilimitihan pa rin ang karapatan ng kababaihan, dadako at dadako ang mga ito sa 'illegal' na paraan para mabawasan ang pasan. How couldnt they?Sa loob ng pelikulang 'Sunshine,' binubuksan nito ang mahirap at hindi napaguusapang diskurso ukol sa karapatan ng kababaihan ayon sa kanilang katawan, aborsyon, guilt, morals, pati na rin ang Sexual abuse/harassment partikular sa mga kabataan o menor de edad. At sa kabilang banda naman, napoportray dito yung bond na nabubuo ng mga kababaihan sa loob ng pyudal na lipunan. Ilang beses akong naiyak habang nanonood, especially nung scene na ni Maris na nagtake siya ng pampalaglag. Ang bigat panoorin nito actually, kasi what do you mean na para mabawi ko yung buhay na mayroon ako before, kailangan kong pumunta ng Quiapo para bumili ng pampalaglag at pagdaanan yung sakit para lang duguin ako ulit? Sunod pa ay yung dinala si Rhed sa hospital dahil binuntis siya ng tito niya. 13 lang siya. Ang mga ganitong klaseng halimbawa ay pinapakita kung gaano ka-devastating yung fact na walang tulong ang narereceive ng mga kababaihan with this kind of situation. Meron naman siguro, pero mahirap at hindi lahat ay may kakayahang makakuha nitong ""tulong"" na ito dahil halos lahat ay kailangan ng pera.Nakaka-mind fuck yung situation ni Rhed (kahit short amount of time lang sha ron s film) kasi sa lipunan natin ngayon, ang daming batang babae ang nabubuntis, at bawat taon, pababa nang pababa ang edad ng mga ito. Ngunit, sino ba ang bumubuntis sakanila?Ang abortion ay hindi isang paraan upang mag-promote ng sarap sa sex sa mga kabataan;And with films like this, maganda yung na-aacknowledge na may ganitong klaseng pangyayari sa lipunan. Pero kagaya ng iba pang pelikula that tackles issues like this ay tulad ng 'Uninvited,' bakit hanggang acknowledge lang?Sa role ni Maris bilang Sunshine, pinapakita nito ang journey niya sa loob ng mundong nangguguiltrip and self-devoted Christians, matatanda, etc etc (at napepersonify itong guilt na to through the character of Bata (played by annika)), nakita niya na may mga batang nabubuntis, nakita niya na may judgement agad yung mga tao sa tulad niya, nakita niya na hindi madaling nakakatanggap at nakakahingi ng tulong yung mga nasa sitwasyon niya—pero even after all these, walang self-reflection or closure yung film or yung character ni Sunshine mismo (since first-hand niyang nawitness and naexperience lahat) sa lahat ng issue na naipakita. Parang ""bahala ka na kung ano gusto mo isipin, basta eto yung pinapakita namin."" Solid 6-7/10.",2025-08-02,negative,0.6791618466377258,2
Sunshine,"It's a rather decent take on the current status of the Philippine status quo on women's health and the healthcare system in general. Rather a hit and miss for me with the kids being a figure of speech so to speak and that the little kid's dream is also Sunshine's dream being the same but should have been clear that both won't be able to meet as per the dialogues. Story-wise, everything somehow fell into place in such a way that all the things that could have been possible in terms of occurrences akin to a deus ex machina of sorts, giving the sense that everything was too good to be true - still, point stands; it's a great film to talk about and amazingly delivers points that we should discuss more of a society, especially when it concerns the lives of women, children, and the difficulties of being a woman in a third world country.<<Objectively, story continuity could have been better which could have convinced me of giving it a higher score.>>",2025-08-02,positive,0.9859640598297119,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is a bold and compelling story about when passion collides with unforeseen circumstances. Delivering a powerful performance, Maris Racal gives light to Sunshine, a bright and hopeful teen gymnast whose Olympic dreams come crashing down after an unplanned pregnancy. While the film is beautiful aesthetically, it’s also dark and grim as it not only deals with a controversial subject matter, but is also an accurate reflection of Philippine culture and society.I love stories that involve moral dillemas — stories that make the character choose between two conflicting moral values. This is the case for Sunshine, whose choice is either to abort her baby to reach her Olympic dream, a goal she’s dreamt of in years; or keep the baby as this is deemed the morally right thing to do. Set in the Philippine context, one of the most religious countries in the world, that is one of the hardest dilemmas to have, and I thought the film gave justice to what Maris’ character had to go through.Maris deserves her props for this as well. She was an acting powerhouse, delivering and making the audience feel everything she was going through right out of the screen. It seemed like she trained legitimately for all the stunts, too. All these efforts made the film much more impactful and grounded.Visually, this is what I imagined the City of Manila is like on film. The city, while beautiful to look at, lying beneath it feels like a sense of grime and moral corruption, which blended well with the film’s theme.But aside from a couple of narrative choices made, I really liked this film. Sunshine, while beautiful, is also a haunting reminder of the everyday struggle of the common Filipino. A Filipino who has goals and dreams but is blindsided by forces beyond their control but chooses to push through. It’s an empowering film that I think will leave its mark for years to come.",2025-08-02,positive,0.9929621815681458,1
Sunshine,"Every choice in cinematography, production, writing, etc. feels all so delicately planned together to build itself into a single cohesive message on the state of reproductive health in the Philippines. Even just the choice of Sunshine being a gymnast- a sport that is known to affect women's menstrual cycles, which explains why Sunshine didn't consider pregnancy in the first place- proves the care and attention direk Tonet placed on every aspect of the film.The ending however, did leave me to wish more in terms of understanding the aftermath of Sunshine's abortion. Filipino society's marites culture and religious evangelism no less is bound to have an effect on Sunshine's life and that was something I wished to see her persevere through post-abortion...but I do also respect the need to end Sunshine's story on a more hopeful note, as that message of sheer hope and optimism is probably more important than portraying an already familiar reality.",2025-08-02,positive,0.9703720211982727,1

Sunshine,"For Every Woman (Para sa bawat Babae) It’s hard to fully grasp what women go through in our society, what more if you’re living in a country like the Philippines, where there aren’t enough laws to protect women’s rights. This movie is a wake-up call, an eye-opener, a voice for the voiceless women. It sheds light on major issues we often sweep under the rug like, sexual assault, teenage pregnancy, public healthcare, poverty, child abuse, and most especially, abortion. These are real, painful realities in the Philippines and we need to talk about them. We need tangible solutions. We need action from our government.As for the cast, whoever handled the casting, hats off. Every single actor in this film delivered. No weak links. Maris Racal completely embodied Sunshine. It wasn’t Maris I saw on screen, it was Sunshine. I know she’s getting a lot of praise for her impeccable, flawless acting here, and she absolutely deserves it.But let me also talk about Annika Co and Jennica Garcia. Annika was incredible in this film. From funny to irritating to heartbreaking, she nailed every single scene. She held her own alongside veteran actors, and that’s not easy dude. And Jennica Garcia? Her eyes, that “mata-mata acting” . In one confrontation scene where she barely had lines, her eyes told the whole story, you could feel out of the screen that she’d do anything for Sunshine. She’s the older sister we all deserve.And the rest of the cast, Elijah Canlas, Xyriel Manabat, Meryll Soriano, Ar-Yuh-Nuh (JM), Rhed Bustamante and the others...damn, perfection! They ate and left no crumbs, mothered!!!This film serves rawness. It’s honest (the Quiapo, to searching from Reddit, X, FB) . It almost feels like a documentary film type. From the gritty shots of Manila’s streets to the realness of the lines, these are the same things we hear in actual situations like this. The script cuts deep. The weight of each line… it’s crushing, full of heavy emotions. Major kudos to Direk Antoinette Jadaone for creating films that reflect the harsh realities of life in the Philippines, especially the realities that women face, the never-ending battle against a society that dictates what a woman should do with her body, the shame, the guilt, and the silence they’re forced to carry. I hope more films like this are made, films like Pamilya Ordinaryo, Birdshot, and now, this. This film deserves AWARDS. I’m also amazed by the cinematography, the color grading, the symbolism of the two children, the sound (especially the NATSOT from Manila, ang lala beh, it really adds so much depth to every scene). This movie will make you laugh, cry, and feel pain. But above all, it stirs the mind and hits the heart, also it carries a message that matters. Message that needs to be heard, seen, and acted upon.The story arc is solidddd. The ending? Not abrupt, not lacking, it was just right. Perfectly right! To every Sunshine out there “gets na namin kayo.” Compassion shouldn’t depend on religion, gender, or social status. These aren’t just stories. This is real life. And we need bold, brave storytellers to bring these realities to light. Highly recommended. Another title could be ""HALA PASALAMAT KA""",2025-08-02,positive,0.9923692941665649,-1

Sunshine,"“Babae siya, hindi bayani. At hindi niya kailangang maging isa para maging totoo.”Sunshine is not here to baby you. It assumes you can handle the discomfort—because you should. Quiet, raw, and unapologetic. Hindi ito comfort film. Hindi rin ito film na may malinis na aral sa dulo. Sa halip, isa itong tahimik pero galit na sigaw sa bansang patuloy na tinuturing ang kababaihan bilang incubator, atleta, o anak—pero hindi bilang ganap na tao. It’s not even a loud film. Antoinette didn’t spoon-feed, and that’s exactly why it hurts.She frames Maris not as a victim, but as a girl with agency. Sa kamay ng ibang director, baka naging sermon to. Pero sakanya, naging tanong. At ang sagot: hindi mo kailangan sumagot.PS:This film turned into a full-blown debate night with my boyfriend. Loved it! Solid talk! Ang dami namin insights.

Sunshine,"You know, I was a child of unwanted pregnancy too. So are my siblings. Like Sunshine, my mom had dreams. Like Sunshine, my mom was striving for better living. Like Miggy, my father was the more financially capable. Like Miggy, my father was useless about it [pregnancy]. Though, my mother couldn't do anything. She still had me— and my ate; and my younger 2 siblings. I wish she had a choice, or even knew that there are options more than just acceptance. Maybe, she could have lived her dreams. It hurts me that I lived on and carried on in my father's care (and even my dad lived unbothered); meanwhile, my mother still suffers in poverty. She is always dead worried about us, and about how she can even carry herself at the age of 40.I hope this film helps people realize Sunshine humanizes all Filipino women who endure such a heavy living— heavy dreams, heavy hearts, and heavy standards. I hope Sunshine becomes the gateway to opening discussions which let women choose and live, especially against how we had been dictated.

Sunshine,"""Drown out the noise!""I watched this film just hours before I turned twenty (teenage graduate). After a year of waiting for it to be released here in the Philippines, I can say—it was absolutely worth it.What makes it so powerful is its courage to open the conversation about abortion and reproductive health in a deeply religious country like ours. It doesn't hold back. As a society, we need to be more open to the realities women face, and ask ourselves what we can do collectively, especially what the government can and should do. ""Mahirap maging babae, lalo na dito sa Pinas"".The film is raw and relevant. Sunshine is real. Her character struck a chord, and I saw glimpses of my past classmates and friends in the struggles of Maris Racal and Rhed Bustamante’s roles. The film tackles poor awareness and lack of access to health facilities, while also confronting religious beliefs and cultural norms head-on.It really centers on abortion—not to promote it, but to open the conversation, especially for conservative audiences. It is still a taboo and personally, I hold a progressive stand on abortion, and seeing it presented this way felt affirming.I also loved the use of symbolism—from the “Gift of God” jeepney that Sunshine rides on her way to Quiapo, to her choosing not to enter the church even while seeking God’s guidance. Those subtle moments say so much.I admire how it ends with the strong message that women own their bodies and have the right to choose and decide—whether or not it goes against religious or cultural expectations.This film is more than a story, it’s a tool. A voice. A reflection of many who share the same experiences as Sunshine.

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is an absolute cinematic gut-punch. Sunshine, the titular character played by Maris Racal, is on her way to Olympic glory, her dreams already in the bag. It takes a missed period and a couple of pink lines to veer her off-course. And just like that, she crashes headlong into a society that’s dead set on denying women their bodily autonomy. Racal’s performance is where the film’s soul resides. She embodies Sunshine with a physicality and emotional depth that’s fully felt from start to finish. Her sobs are painful to watch, but she’s given some respite she can hold onto: the comradeship among women. Jennica Garcia’s Geleen, Sunshine’s older sister, is a particular standout.Fittingly, Jadaone is not soft around the edges, and the film is unflinching in its message.

Sunshine,"sabi ng coach ni Sunshine, “yung iniisip mo, ilang araw lang yan. weeks, or months. pero ito, ang tagal na nito sayo.” pertaining to her dream of representing her country in the olympics. not knowing na yung problema ni Sunshine will long outlive her dream, and will likely stay with her for the rest of her life. hindi humingi si Sunshine ng opinyon sa mga tao sa paligid niya. bago pa niya sabihin sa iba, alam na niya yung desisyon niya. she didn’t need anyone to ‘talk her out of it’, she only asked for their understanding. yun lang naman talaga hinihiling ng mga babaeng katulad ni Sunshine. hindi naman nila sinasabing gawin mo, gusto lang nilang maintindihan mo kung bakit nila ‘to ginagawa. kasi wala naman silang choice, at hindi sila binibigyan ng choice ng bansang ‘to, at ng mga outdated beliefs nito. nakakalungkot isipin kung ilang babae na ang dumaan sa paghihirap at sakit na pinagdaanan din ni Sunshine dahil lang kinicriminalize ng batas at simbahan ang abortion, kaya ito nagiging unsafe. at mas lalong nakakalungkot isipin kung ilang babae na rin yung nakaranas ng paghihirap na pinagdadaanan ng mga nanay, kahit hindi naman nila ‘to ginusto. ewan wala na ‘ko masabi basta naiyak ako sa kwento ni Sunshine at sobrang nag eempathize ako sakanya kasi nakikita ko sakanya yung kaibigan ko.

Sunshine,"that shot of sunshine and her sister in the taxi? inject that shit in my VEINSthis was so beautifully lit, the night scenes were so captivating. probably my favorite scenes aesthetically because it sets the mood of an isolating society for women but a mix with the light of hope. the addition of the “future” children was pretty clever and adds a witty touch of when people say what if your aborted child becomes this!!! it’s truly a women-centric film that we barely had a few seconds without the titular sunshine. i love the grit mixed with wittiness— which i think are the quintessential qualities of filipino films. maybe im greedy but i wish we could’ve gotten more of how sunshine overcame the pregnancy and not just a “girl who is going to be okay” scene. if they were gonna represent the struggles of women, possibly be the face of a movement, and be “gritty,” they should’ve went all the way. it just felt incomplete and leaves an unsatisfying feeling that we are still stuck (which is true but i wanted more!!).",2025-08-03,positive,0.9959757924079895,1

It doesn’t have a resolution nor does the message really sticks it landing. It is however, simply a story told that is based on the bits and pieces of reality that we can only conceive. It’s a conversation starter, but its certainly does not explore much of the topic that its centered on. So much so that the film doesn’t really let you grow to care about the Protagonist’s support system, thus their presence, their wisdom and their comfort, falls flat in terms of having and relevance to you. There are moments wherein I enjoyed the humor, but you can only do so much with curse words in dialogues that it starts to sound like Daryl Yap’s films, the only difference here is that it handled a topic that’s taboo and has managed to deliver its point across, however at the expense of being safe enough to be told, but less poignant and thought provoking to be considered as something to be discussed in depth.

However, if the movie talks about social and political issues like it has in SUNSHINE, I can tune and lock in.SUNSHINE is straightforward to its message. It's about dealing with abortion in a country where not only is illegal but also discriminated hardly. A sensitive topic portrayed with a really good script by Jadaone. What a complete package in terms of writing. The story is justified.Even though I may have found the climactic moments not explosive enough, I'm sure the average Filipino conservative does. Personally, I am pro-abortion and I believe women have the rights to their own bodies. I'm glad the movie went in the direction I wanted. As someone who has seen a lot of abortion films in Holywood, this is the first Filipino. And I just applaud everyone in this project for the risk and making a statement through SUNSHINE. For that, it's already a big win for independent Filipino cinema as theaters flock and raise the demand. Because at the end of the day, a movie is not only good if it's good, but also if it sparks conversation. Hundreds of essays and reviews are out there for this film.

Sa kabila ng panawagang boykot bilang pagtutol sa henosidyo ng Israel sa Gaza, lumahok ang pelikula sa Berlin International Film Festival 2025 at indirektang nakisangkot sa panlulupig ng kababaihan kapalit ng Kanluraning balidasyon.Sa tulak ng lokal na suporta, na-extend ang pagpapalabas ng “Sunshine” sa mga sinehan—patunay na posible ang tagumpay ng pelikula nang hindi kinakalakal ang sarili sa mga institusyong may kamay sa karahasan.Basahin ang buong rebyu dito.",2025-07-24,positive,0.6414142847061157,2

Sunshine,"[will edit later, for now this is my initial thoughts]Gets kita, Sunshine!Abortion is not just a decision—it's a process. It's never easy. We saw how sunshine depicted guilt, anxiety, and contemplation throughout the film, which mirrors many women's lived experiences. The more we don't talk about this kind of topic and deny women's bodily autonomy, the more women to seek unsafe alternatives—like hilot at pamaparegla sa quiapo—which can lead to death and complications. ""Baka next president yang dinadala mo pero ipapalaglag mo lang"" pano magiging next president ang isang baby kung yung nanay nya walang mapakain sa kanya at walang pera para mapaaral sya? Pro-life lang kayo kapag nasa tyan ng nanay, pero wala na kayong pake after that. Sunshine is just one of many women who also have a dreams for themselves. If giving birth is for you, good for you and it's a valid choice. But for some, it was never an option because they have big dream to fulfill and personal stories as to why they want to make that decision. I love it when Dir. Toñet Jadaone creates characters who are goal-driven and ambitious— Christine(Alone/Together), Vilma(Beauty in a bottle), and now Sunshine. Throughout the film, it felt like Sunshine already had a decision and she's firm with it. She's going to do it regardless of what will happen. I hope in the future, there will be legal medical practices that provides safe abortions, because there's an urgent need for them.",2025-08-03,positive,0.8129671216011047,1

Para akong ibinalik sa mga oras na iyon. ‘Di ko mapigilang mag-isip kung nagawa ko bang maging katulad ni Geleen. Kung nakapag-offer ba ako ng enough understanding at compassion kagaya ni Geleen. Surface-level lang pala ang alam ko sa struggles niya noon, dahil hanggang doon lang naman ang kaya kong malaman at maintindihan even as a gay guy and a feminist. There is so much more struggles to abortion than just making a decision— it inevitably comes with guilt, shame, and fear to which the film portrayed effectively.One thing is for sure, ang hirap na nga maging babae— mas lalo pa sa Pilipinas. Poverty, bulok na public health system, lack of access to reproductive rights— all were tackled with so much bravery, honesty, and rawness.

Sunshine,"“naiintindihan mo na ba ako””gets ko na.”raw, simple, poignant, brave is how i would describe this film. its a film that has something to say and my god they delivered it so well. its direct to the point, its bold, its in your face, it shows you the reality of what the women in this country go through when it comes to reproductive health. nakakaiyak, nakakalungkot isipin na our women has to depend on unsafe abortion just because the men violated their body — mary grace’s tito raped her and miggy not pulling out when he said he will — and just because abortion is illegal.i don’t think my mind has fully processed the film in a way that my thoughts are still all over the place and dont know where to start even if 2 hours has passed since i watched the movie. there are so many key moments in the movie and i want to talk abt it all, but let me stick to at least 3. one, sunshine and geleen’s (jennica) relationship, specifically yung part na tinabihan niya si sunshine sa kama para sabihin na sinusuportahan niya si sunshine sa kung ano mang desisyon niya, CRIED HARDDDD!!! kasi ramdam mo na conflicted siya in terms of abortion pero si sunshine ang priority niya at kung ano magpapasaya at magpapalaya kay sunshine iyon ang lagi niyang pipiliin. im glad that sunshine has an ate like her, i wish i had one too and i’m hoping to be a good of an ate like geleen. two, the whole sequence between mary grace and sunshine, it was sooo heartbreaking and so shattering to think na ito ang reyalidad ng napakaraming kabataan hindi lang sa pilipinas kundi sa buong mundo. our children deserves better. lastly, when sunshine finally perfected her routine, she looks so free, so happy, so contented, you just know she already made her decision. it was such a beautiful scene, its just her and her routine and the kid — her kid — watching her and finally understanding her. sobrang nakakaiyak. “gets ko na” such a simple statement but made me cry so hard wow. gets na gets talaga. great performances all around din talaga especially to maris racal grabe napakagaling, literal na wala talaga ako ibang masabi kundi sobrang sobrang galing wow. jennica garcia na hindi rin talaga maipagkakaila ang galing, ang onti lang ng scenes niya pero lahat may impact. and siyempre who would forget rhed bustamante na napakagaling din. sound design and cinematography are on point din talaga, i especially love those parts when sunshine drowns out the noise. writing this made me realize that the whole film, the ones who made the most impact are women. oh women, i hope one day the world will be kinder to us. i think i have said enought but i really hope that this film would be a way for people to be more open minded when it comes to the discussion of abortion and sana itong pelikulang ito ay maging daan rin para mas lalong maraming pang tao ang sumama sa laban na gawing legal ang safe abortion practices sa bansa. and to direk tonet thank you for sharing us your craft and for meticulously creating this film. you delivered its message very well! kudos to you direk and to everyone involved!",2025-08-03,positive,0.9880113005638123,24

Sunshine,"Fear and self-interest. The two powerful drives of men according to Napoleon.But Sunshine is a woman— a gymnast, one of the few sports considered most feminine—one of those burning out athletes who lives by flexibility, by bending yourself in all possible corners to become this perfect beautiful being. So yes, maybe she was driven by fear and love for gymnastics, but why not?Her panic walks bending through eskinitas, the close ups on Maris’ expressive eyes unyielding despite the fear, and the overwhelming passionate Filipino noise shiver through the gritty scene of Manila and it feeds us, the audience, a rhythmic choreography of the most tender experience of a woman. Manila succumbs her, a fragile thin young girl on the verge of losing it all. And I fucking loved and consumed it.I love it too much I felt the giddiness through the tips of my fingers when the first scene at Quiapo entered, Sunshine in panic crying inside the jeep, and the first thing I thought was, “putangina si Julio ng Maynila sa Kuko ng Liwanag.”Yes maybe Sunshine enjoyed doing it with Miggy, and maybe seen the near death process of getting rid of it through Mary Grace, felt the catholic guilt, and that maybe her drive to success is to disregard what could be (motherhood) but still, ultimately still, tender is the flesh of a woman who wants to be in life. Like Julio (my shayla), tender is the flesh that holds all possibilities in life. The difference is, the tragedy of Brocka’s Julio is the absence of grounded support systems. Sunshine became her own because of the people and the women in her life who understood and grieved with her.Ito ang kasagutan sa katanungang paano naging kapantay Lino Brocka, Ishmael, Mario O’Hara si Dir.

Sunshine,"long ass word dump bc wow. it’s been a long time since i’ve felt so much for a film. hindi ko alam paano simulan, pero grabe kabog ng puso ko the entire time.the frustration of knowing that this happens in real life. that every girl, in a sense, was once sunshine. isang batang babaeng puno ng potensyal, mga pangarap, at may mga plano para sa sarili. isang batang babaeng takot na takot at walang magawa kundi tumungo sa online spaces (twitter, reddit, google, tiktok, etc.) para humanap ng paraan para makawala sa sitwasyong hindi niya inakalang mangyayari sakanya; saklap pa na isang lalaking walang kwenta ang naglagay sakanya sa posisyon na iyon.actually, isang buong bansa (with its strictly religious ideals, nonsensical government, and fucked up healthcare system) ang naglagay sakanya sa posisyon na iyon. from the beginning until the end of the movie sobrang emphasized nito. from the small comments (yung pharmacist) to the loud barking of unsolicited remarks (yung doktora na sinabihan pa si sunshine na magpasalamat kay Lord na hindi nalaglag yung bata, grabe rage bait 10000).pero makikita mo parin na grabe talaga ang chokehold ng religion sa ating mga pinoy. the way sunshine’s first instinct was to go to church and pray that it all goes away? prays that He takes the baby? an ironic reality.the film encapsulates manila and its complexities, completely. walang sugarcoat. manila up close? horrid. konti nalang parang maaamoy mo na yung baho sa may avenida at quiapo in the movie… but somehow, antionette jadaone makes it beautiful. the scene of maris contemplating and hesitating inside her room in avenida inn? the darkness that is only lit up by the train rushing by? cinematography at its finest. ultimo yung background noice, to a T. prayers and church bells, clinking bottles, vendors yelling, random cursing— it was so authentic i genuinely felt like i was in manila. the representation of a lot of things in the movie were also beautiful. the “bata” (which i assume is younger sunshine) was my favorite. telling the older sunshine that abortion was wrong at the start, then hugging her at the end whispering “gets ko na.” after the older sunshine performs her piece ??? HEART CRUSHED. TEARS WERE SHED!!!! although may questions ako left unanswered, hindi ako unsatisfied. this film opened my eyes to so much more. i truly loved this film. tangina buong cast walang tapon. ang gagaling. hats off to maris!!!!!!

Sunshine,"Ang pangarap mo ay ang pangarap ko.Nirerepresenta ng pelikula na ito ang malaking sikreto ng isang babaeng nakaranas ng ganitong sitwasyon. Pinag-usapan sa pelikula na ito ang katahimikan, takot, kasabikan, pagdadalawang-isip, pag-iisa, ang konsensya, ang buhay, ang kamatayan--- isinambit sa pelikula ang hindi maibanggit-banggit ng mga kababaihang nakaranas ng aborsyon, at ngayon sila ay narinig, nagkaroon ng boses at patuloy lang sa pagpapatuloy.Some people don't understand the role of Annika and Aryana(?). Some think it's just a cell (you will forget about it). But for someone who carried it, even for a short time, you know it's there--- the heartbeat, the suffocation. You find yourself dreaming of their face, of their future. But they will never be engraved in your soul. You just know that, for a brief moment, something existed inside you.

Sunshine,"i absolutely love how nuanced this is. how it took into consideration filipino contexts in discussing such a sensitive topic. i love the cinematography, absolutely stunning. captured the vibe of living in the busy and harmful streets of manila.discussed this with my gf but i find the heavy incorporation of religion in this quite integral to the story. while westerners may be able to discuss about abortion more openly, filipinos whose lives revolve around religion, are not at all the same. we were taught at an early age that religion is the absolute law, and we must follow every rule made in the name of religion. and so, the guilt sunshine carries throughout the film is heavier than ever, because not only was she dealing with the judgment of others, she was also dealing with the judgment of God, “The Father.” And, surprisingly enough, I find the presence of the child important. At first, she bothered me a bit, how she accused shine of being a murderer, stopped shine from her attempts at abortion. She’s the superego, the guilt that follows shine everywhere. But also, she’s a part of sunshine, hence her line “Pangarap ko ang pangarap niya.” (non verbatim) and so, she too, wishes to see sunshine succeed. Her running to sunshine after her final performance and saying “gets ko na” was her way of easing shine’s guilt. After all, as people love to give life to everyone’s unborn child, then I guess this once, I too, shall make use of that. Viewing sunshine’s life through the eyes of her “unborn child” must have been painful, yet every child I know has questioned (at least once) how good of a life their mother would’ve had, had they never been born. And just like every living child, the kid too, understood how much gymnastics meant to shine. And she was willing to trade the loss of her life for sunshine’s happiness, because she will always be a part of sunshine.",2025-12-07,positive,0.9954296350479126,9

Sunshine,"Sunshine affected me deeply. The film explored women’s autonomy with so much honesty, and the characters’ struggles and victories felt incredibly real. I loved how it showed the layered challenges that come with unwanted pregnancies and the emotional, physical, and social weight women carry. The story treated its themes with grace and intelligence, and I truly believe it deserves a wide audience.One of the most powerful elements came from Sunshine’s relationship with her sister. Watching the difficulty of her sister’s life, especially the reality of raising a child, shaped her own decision. It felt like she saw her future in that picture, a future filled with sacrifices and dreams placed on hold. That glimpse alone said so much about choice, survival, and the pressure placed on women.The film also opened an entire landscape of conversations. Misogyny, women’s choices, abortion, body autonomy, laws, healthcare, and the quiet burdens carried by women in this country. These are everyday truths, yet they rarely reach the screen with this level of sincerity. I crave more stories with this courage, stories that explore mature themes with depth and curiosity. This film touched many important ideas and left me eager for even richer layers. Symbolism filled the entire narrative, and I loved how each detail carried emotional weight. I could spend an entire afternoon unpacking everything.One scene stays with me the most. The motel sequence. The stillness, the rumble of the train, her actions, and the aftermath created a breathtaking moment. That scene captured the danger of doing something unfamiliar to one’s body and the immense pressure created by law and religion. It felt intense, raw, and beautifully crafted.And the presence of the kid as her guilty conscience completed the emotional arc in such a striking way. It felt like a final haunting reminder of everything she carried.",2025-12-06,positive,0.9944785833358765,1

Sunshine,"this is a film that shows several harsh realities that many young women face every day. it tackles sensitive yet crucial issues such as unplanned pregnancy, illegal abortion, sexual assault committed by a family member, the heavy influence of religion on decision-making, and how one snap can completely shatter a young person’s future. these themes are not exaggerated; they are painful and real. “Mahirap maging babae, mas lalo na babae sa Pilipinas.”the film drop a reality line about women especially here in the philippines. this resonates the lived experiences of countless young women who grew up navigating a society that often blames them first before offering help.the movie also embodied the noises—the noise of judgment from society, the noise of broken dreams, and the noise coming from people who desperately need help but have nowhere to turn. it speaks out that the loudest sound isn’t the chaos of Manila’s streets, but the silent cries of countless helpless women. the film exposes the flaws in our cultural, social, and institutional systems, making it easy to see where we are lacking the most.the scene showing the overcrowded OB department in a public hospital was somehow alarming. it’s chaotic, understaffed, and overcrowded—yet this reflects reality. it reveals how instead of creating long-term solutions, government tend to simply acknowledge the issue or, worse, disregard it. the systems remain weak and unresponsive.beyond all of these social issues, the film also shows how dreams can easily collapse under the weight of societal pressure. this makes the film more than just a film—it becomes a moviefied reflection of the everyday struggles of filipino youth, especially young women who are forced to grow up too fast.overall, the movie sunshine is a wake-up call. it’s a call for empathy, understanding, and meaningful change.",2025-12-04,positive,0.9378353357315063,9

Ang pelikulang ""Sunshine"" idinirekta ni Antoinette Jadaone sobrang danas at isyu sa bansang Pilipinas. Ang ganda ng set sa manila, ang raw, rinig at ramdam mo ang init, sikip, usok, baho, at gulo. Noong tatapatin pa lang niya yung nakabuntis sa kanya itong salita agad ang pumasok sa isip kong sasabihin ng lalaki e,""Sigurado ka bang sa akin 'yan?"" Ito talaga ang una mong maririnig sa isang lalaki kapag sinabi ng isang babae na ""buntis ako"". Walang hiyang linya 'yan imbes na pagsuporta kay Sunshine pagdududa ang ibibigay para ikaila yung responsibilidad, lalaki nga. hahahahaha, sorry kung may pagka discriminate sa parteng ito pero iyan ang reyalidad. Sunod naman yung batang si Anika, noong una hindi ko gets bakit bigla siyang susulpot at mawawala. Para sa akin para siyang inner child ni Sunshine kung susuriin yung pelikula sa bandang dulo nang tinuloy ni Sunshine na gamitin yung nabiling gamot sa Ale sa quiapo, basta fast-forward sa tricycle, makikita na yung legs ni Anika ay may dugo rin which is sign na ganon ang epekto ng nabili niyang gamot o pag abort, hindi ko ma explain pero gets na yan, at kung paano huminga si Sunshine ganoon din siya noong isinusugod na siya sa hospital. Tapos parang noong una hindi pa gets ni Anika yung mga desisyon ni Sunshine sa kagustuhang magpa abort pero yung sa huli nakita niya kung paano mahal at gusto ni Sunshine yung pangrap niya kaya I love the part na sinabi niya na ""gets ko na"" ika niya nga. Tapos if you think yung pagintindi ay hindi nanggaling sa iba kundi sa sarili niya diba????? So, ito na nga dahil binanggit ko na ang quiapo, gusto ko rin yung scene na matapos niyang malaman na buntis siya dumiretso agad siya sa simbahan para mag dasal. why? kasi may guilt siya part niya sana gets niyo ako, staka super religious o predominant catholic itong bansa natin, sana gets hahahaha...tapos diba yung binilhan ni Sunshine ng pangpa abort parang katabi o malapit sa simbahan parang na pinipilit ng relihiyon at batas ang mga babae sa isang krisis, ngunit ang parehong lugar din ang kanilang takbuhan para maghanap ng bawal na solusyon. Sobrang konserbatibong bansa. At sunod ulit yung pag bili niya ng illegal na pangpa abort, no choice e, walang health care sa mga katulad niyang may ganoong problem. diba? ang lala ng sistema, walang program na pwedeng lapitan right away. Kasi ano ang unang nangyayari o ginagawa ng mga tao pag ang isang babae ay buntis, ang gagawin ng ibang tao manghusga ngunit hindi naman handang magbigay ng practical na tulong. Kaya ang katuwang lang ng babae ay sino? Sarili, dignidad, at pangrap. Kaya, gets ko si Sunshine sa mga desisyon niya, it's a relief for her kung gagawin niya yung illegal. At huli, sobrang galing ni Maris Racal, hanga ako, dalang-dala niya talaga yung bigat ng karakter. Mata-mata acting at yung pag perform niya galing. Huli na talaga, gustong-gusto ko ang mura ng batang si Anika, galing! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",2025-12-07,positive,0.7779091596603394,12

Sunshine,Wonderful movie with an exceptional meaning thay I think coming from a very conservative country is very important to talk about. It is not the most visually stunning movie but it had some incredible shots. It is a well-made film and the heart of it is what really made it an even better one. I love it when movies really present a story that challenges their audience to think about and start a conversation for. It is so enticing and deeply original in a way that it tried to tackle a story that is morally frowned upon in the Philippines so having a brave set of creative to present is just impressive. The performances of the entire cast is truly memorable and that scene from Maris and Jennica will be an important one that would heal so many hearts. It is an important story to talk about and I am glad that they did with so much care for the people who might get involved with it while teaching thise that needs to understand it better.,2025-12-06,positive,0.9974871873855591,-1

Film ini juga pake simbol dan momen hening buat nunjukkin betapa sempitnya ruang gerak yang dia punya.Yang aku suka, filmnya nggak pernah maksa penonton buat mikir searah. Banyak hal dibiarkan ambigu, tapi justru itu yang bikin interpretasinya hidup. Kita diajak ngikutin proses dia ngambil kembali kendali atas tubuh dan masa depannya, pelan-pelan, tanpa drama berlebihan. Aku merasa ada satu titik di mana semuanya terasa klik. Bukan karena dijelasin, tapi karena apa ya bisa pahamlah gitu dari caranya bersikap dan bertindak.Akhirnya juga bukan yang gimana-gimana, tapi ya kerasa personal dan melegakan.

Unimaginable curse of being a child bearing gender in this stupid stupid world. How much inequality have we imposed on them in different ways and names.Where she just keeps hitting her stomach with bare hand hoping it’d kill the baby or the approach of bringing in surrealism (or mythology) to show the unborn kids’ connection and interactions with their yet to give birth Mom had made it much more harder for us to come over it. Hypothetically speaking, “If I ever get a girl child I’d call her Sunshine” Coming from rural India, I guess without much realisation I had recently developed a more liking towards Asian cinemas.

Having no one to share your suffering with.Sunshine only gained clarity when she felt supported by her older sister - that at the end of the day, she gets to have control and the final say to whatever her decision is. Giving agency to the people whose decisions will only affect them anyway sounds so simple since you can apply it to almost anything, but once abortion is mentioned, suddenly some people want to control the decisions of other people.Religion is obviously at the forefront of this topic. People forget that their religion is based on faith, not objective truth. It is still crazy to me that we live in an age where you could educate yourself, yet some of us still blindly choose to follow a random book that was written by a random person thousands of years ago.Kudos to Jadaone and team for making this important and (unfortunately) still relevant film.",2025-12-06,positive,0.9221529960632324,-1

Sunshine,"All I can say is that this film is undeniably brave—brave enough to tackle a timely and controversial issue within a country shaped by religious beliefs, societal judgment, and limited access to healthcare. For Sunshine, the act of making a decision carries extraordinary weight, as she becomes fully aware of the consequences that she will have to faceI appreciate that the filmmakers not only showed how Sunshine arrived at her decision, but also place emphasis on why she makes it. The narrative thoughtfully explores the influences, pressures, and circumstances that frame her choices, allowing the audience to understand her on a deeper level.The film effectively captures the bleak realities and unfiltered rawness of Manila, which it is easy for me to say “gets ko na”—to agree with certain moments and empathize with Sunshine’s actions, precisely because the film enables us to feel the gravity of her experiences.This work is a feat for Filipino cinema.

Sunshine,"This is different from the genres I usually go for but I’m glad I watched it. Acting is good and the script is wow.I love her dialogue when she firmly said she did not want to be a mother in front of her man-child ex. The guy was looked like the apology was forced out of him. He always looked at his dad as if may ambag ang papa niya sa kasalanan. Loved the 2nd to the last clip of her practicing. She is so passionate about her craft. I’m not sure cause I skilled some of her routine but in the whole movie, I think this is the part where she got her routine right. She did apply what her coach said, to leave her problems aside and just embrace the moment. The side characters are so carefully placed to further progress the story.

I will never know what it’s like to be a woman with child but this film made me feel all the conflicted, complicated, and crushing emotions of what it’s like to make that oh so difficult decision. Yes it’s incredibly sad yet she has to make the choice that’s best for her even though it literally breaks every inch of her soul. It accurately portrays Filipino society’s perception around abortion and how religion and gender roles play an integral part in the whole ordeal when it absolutely should not. It should be between the woman and her doctor alone, the outsiders opinion only makes this life altering decision so much harder than it already is. It’s so wonderfully nuanced and so so beautiful, thank you for keeping Filipino cinema alive Sunshine.

And those people have to make decisions that sometimes are not acceptable to norms or beliefs. But Maris Racal delivers a story of a girl na hindi humihingi ng sympathy kundi karapatan. Karapatan na mamili. Karapatan na magpatuloy. Karapatan na mangarap. For me, it's not just a simple talk tungkol sa abortion; it’s about access, fairness, and acknowledging na hindi tayo pare-pareho ng laban.We don’t have to personally want what Sunshine wants. Pero we must understand why she has to fight for it. Kung bakit may mga oportunidad na dapat bukas para sa lahat kahit na hindi natin ito kailangan.

Sunshine,"“Pangarap ko din mga pangarap mo, Sunshine”This movie was so beautifully written, directed and acted. Grabe, hands down kay maris kasi ramdam na ramdam mo yung emosyon niya and struggle throughout the whole movie. This literally depicts women around the philippines—-no matter what economic class they may be— when it comes to teenage pregnancy. Whether or not we care to admit it, no teenage pregnancy is planned and the toll that has on a developing woman will never ever ne experienced by ANY man. So miggy, pakyu.Pero grabe, you can feel the internal battle Sunshine was going through and I think that every single woman who has a dream, a goal in life perhaps, if situated the same, would go through the same lengths. Maybe not through all of that extent, but this is such an eye opening movie to those who still feel like abortion in the philippines is taboo. You would literally rather have all these women dying instead of getting and giving them the right medical treatment? These are children, btw. Yes, they did adult things but bear in mind that there is no such thing as a consenting child in the eyes of the law.Oh Antoinette Jadona, the woman that you are.

Sunshine,"It’s always “labag yan sa batas ng Diyos” but never “naiintindihan mo ba ako?” This film carefully define failures of this country. Ang ironic lang for me na kalat sa labas ng Quiapo ang bentahan ng mga gamot pampalaglag, habang ang sistema natin ay patuloy na tutol sa ganitong paraan. Goosebumps when my friends and I noticed the sign sa jeep saying “Gift of God”, we came up with only one assumption of what that sign is trying to tell the viewers. Simply, babies are a blessing. And that’s what they’ll always say whenever abortion comes up in a conversation.The symbolism of the Kid who has been following Sunshine all throughout the film. My first assumption was— she was the conscience of the latter. Obviously, lumalabas siya every time na may gagawin si Sunshine sa pagbubuntis niya. Siya ang constant reminder na lahat nang gagawin niya ay mali. Second, it was Sunshine’s younger version. Trying to tell her something. Pero bandang dulo ng film it was revealed na it was the baby. I would like to believe na malaki ang naging parte niya sa naging desisyon ni Sunshine. Because Sunshine was the happiest when she’s doing what she love. Walang karapatan ang kahit sino man sa magiging desisyon ng babae para sa katawan niya.Super dami kong pang gustong sabihin sa film na ‘to kasi super pleased ako sa mga details and symbolisms.

Sunshine,"i have so many thoughts about this movie so i might just make edits. also i only got to watch it now kasi kakarelease lang sa netflix first i just wanted to applaud the use of background noises. i think im so used to movies relying on ‘noise cancellation’ that the background sounds were so instantly noticeable for me, and i understood it as something integral to the plot na ‘sunshine’s story is just one sound among many’, and thinking about how noisy these public spaces are (quiapo, avenida) parang ang liit tignan ng buhay ni sunshine tuloy. and it’s so real that society tends to overlook the lives of these women where they’re commonly diminished into statistics or cautionary talesi can even argue that in some instances, like sunshine praying outside the quiapo church or secretly talking to the pamparegla seller, is a ‘background noise’ in itself. naingayan ako sa mga scenes na yun to the point where the dialogue was just blending with the background noise. it really says a lot about how these stories are just among us, and it’s so devastating to think that something as serious as this matter (something hindering of one’s ambitions and with the capacity of changing the direction of one’s life) blends so well with noise we consider every-day and mundanesecond, this movie really touched my pathos  given my positionality as a woman. the scrolling on reddit, silently looking for online communities or help..ugh i understood the frustration of being a woman in a catholic country so well. i obviously have never been pregnant, but when im at the BIOLOGICAL age for it, ang scary to think na we don’t have that option at all, na our bodily autonomies are immediately disregarded by others just because of personal beliefs. ang daming instances when i was watching na iniisip ko nalang ‘what if that were me?’ SYEMPRE WAG NAMAN SANA PERO that’s the point diba? for the movie to put us in the shoes of sunshine and make us FEEL that we don’t want to be in her shoes. that way we’ll think of challenging the system that we currently have but i really love how despite the circumstances, sunshine was still adamant about being true to her autonomy and GANUN talaga dapat. i heard the ending was supposed to be different, but im so glad they changed it to this",2025-12-06,positive,0.9728866219520569,-1

It tries to do too much for its own good. The sequence of events make no sense, relationships with people have no emotional weight aside from Sunshine and her sister, ang gulo.

Sunshine,"Gets kita Sunshine, gets ka namin.Grabe, napakahusay. I didn’t expect how emotional this film would make me feel — to the point that it got me all teary-eyed. ""Sunshine"" is one of those films that stirs something inside: It makes you see, it makes you feel, it makes you realize, and it makes you understand.Itong ""Sunshine"" ay hindi lang basta-bastang pelikula gaya ng iba, dahil sa malalim at mabigat nitong mensahe. Sunshine, the girl with big dreams who got pregnant too early. Mary Grace, a child neglected by her own Mother, and was raped and impregnated by her Uncle — these characters aren’t purely fictional; they reflect real-life problems that many have faced. Iilan lamang ang sitwasyon nina Sunshine at Mary Grace sa maraming dahilan kung bakit sang-ayon ako sa Abortion o Pro-choice.Abortion isn’t murder; it’s healthcare — this is a strong and profound message in the film. ""Sunshine"" is a film that goes beyond entertainment; it also functions as an eye-opener. I hope na mas marami pa ang manood ng movie na ‘to. Para ma-realize nila kung gaano kahalaga na i-legalize ang aborsyon sa bansa. Kasi, sa totoo lang, napakaraming problema na puwedeng ma-solve kapag na-legalize na ang aborsyon (e.g., poverty, suicide cases, unemployment, uneducated people, etc.).Ang solid talaga nito, pati ‘yung mga bwisit na chismosa at religious people na nagpapaka-saint kuhang-kuha. But joke aside, nakakainis talaga ‘yung mga nagmamagaling na ‘yan, ta’s gagamitin pa ang Bible para i-justify ang pagiging ignorante nila. Like please, can’t they learn to set aside their religious beliefs and think about what truly matters?! They disagree, solely because the bible says it’s a sin. But what about those who have (and will) suffer? All they care about is that the baby gets delivered, but what comes after that? They don’t care.

Importante ang bawat sulok ng pelikulang ito lalung lalo na ang pananalamin sa estado at kasuluksulukan ng Quiapo. Sa bawat busina at usok ng mga jeep, sa bawat ingay ng mga tao, sa bawat lakad ng mga kababaihan na may sabay na bitbit na pangarap at problema, hinding hindi maikukumpara kung gaano kasalimuot ang kanilang mga nararanasan. Kaya kung napanood mo ito at hindi ka pa sumasang-ayon, naway isipin mo ang mahabaging desisyon na bitbit ni Sunshine (hindi man ito aayon sa kultura at relihiyon ng ating bansa), sapagkat ito ay mahalagang proposal na dapat isaalang-alang ng nakararami.",2025-12-06,positive,0.8739200234413147,14

Ang nakakainis pa rito, makikita mo sa mga reviews esp sa socmed na super sarado pa rin sila sa isyung ganito. Ano na? Hindi pa rin ba kayo ready sa usaping aborsyo? Paano tayo uunlad kung utak kalawang pa rin kayo?Hindi purke illegal ito sa bansa natin, doesn't mean na walang gumagawa nito.Which is FAXX. I will never judge a girl doing such thing no matter what her reason. Kahit makipag sex sya with consent or without her consent at may nabuo, it is her fucking choice kung ipapaabort nya or hindi.

Bakit kailangan isisi sa mga kababaihan at iguilt trip sila when in the first place mga lalaki nmn itong mga duwag at walng bayag? When a man is not ready to be a father, it's ok. But a woman who's not ready to be a mother, considered a sin. What kind of thinking is that?",2025-12-06,positive,0.8597999215126038,-1

Sunshine,"This movie unveiled how every unexpected pregnancy burdens solely the women. The men who always attempt to get away with their responsibility after learning the byproduct of their act. More significantly, the relevance of the depiction of the child on how the story and the plot progresses gives an emphasis on the acceptance of the sentiment of not wanting to conceive a child. How Maris' character dedicated most of her life doing something she loves: gymnastics, which can be taken away from considering her pregnancy--- she literally did everything and sacrificed everything to reach her dreams. The movie has conveyed the weight of abortion and how motherhood is a choice which is not tailored for all women.",2025-12-06,positive,0.9333183169364929,-1

IF YOU HAVE TIME PLEASE WATCH IT, VERY EYE-OPENER.Sa castings pa lang panalo, walang tapon, lahat ng characters nabigyan nila yung mga role nila ng hustisya, lahat ng emosyon tumatagos sa screen, nakakarating sa manunuod ng klaro. Kada umiiyak si Maris, umiiyak din ako.Direk Tonet, sobrang ganda ng pelikula mo, and super grateful ako na nakarating din to sa PH cinemas. I really think kailangan pa natin ng mga ganitong pelikula na nagtatackle ng mga controversial or taboo topics dito sa Pinas. It's a great medium to let people know kung anong realidad ang meron tayo. GANITO DAPAT ANG MGA PELIKULANG LUMALABAS SA SINEHAN.Lumabas ako ng sinehan na mapula ang mata at ilong, at di mapakali, gusto ko agad pag-usapan kung anong nangyari sa movie. Since I watched it alone, wala akong kasamang mapagdiskusyunan 'to. Now, I just decided to let out everything here. Up to you if babasahin mo to lolGusto ko pa sanang pagusapan yung main topic ng pelikula which is  abortion.

Hindi ko alam kung bakit ang hirap nitong intindihin para sa iba.This movie doesn’t just show the reality of unplanned pregnancy, it exposes why good quality and ACCESSIBLE healthcare is crucial and why fucking abortion needs to be legalized. It makes you realize how a corrupt, underfunded healthcare system, shaped by decades of neglect, ends up deciding the choices and safety of women. A country with no real healthcare access, outdated religious stigma, and a government that would rather shame women than help them traps women into choices they never truly want, and pushes them to resort to illegal and unsafe ways just to be able na mapalaglag na lang yung bata para makapagpatuloy sa kanilang buhay.

Hindi ko naiintindihan, are the words na lagi kong sagot kada ang response niya sakin ay “kasi ikaw ang buhay ko”, kasi ang kapalit nun sakin ay yung mga responsibilidad na maging mas matalino, mas magaling, na hindi option ang pumalpak, especially when it comes to decisions.Sabi ko, hindi ko naiintindihan kasi sayang. Lahat ng kung ano ako ngayon, lahat ng mga narating ko ngayon, dapat siya na yun, o mas higit pa kung nilakasan niya lang loob niya. Ika nga, in this world we can’t always get all that we want, kaya sa kabila ng bawa’t hindi ko maintindihan, siya ring may katapat na naiintindihan ko. Gets ko na, hindi pala na sayang, dahil siya din naman ang lahat ng kung ano ako ngayon, dahil dun palang sa pinili niya ako para maging anak niya, kahit pa na may kapalit iyong mga responsibilidad hindi lang para sakin kundi para din sa kaniya, dun palang sa araw na yun, isang matapang na pagpasya din ang ginawa niya para piliin na kaming dalawa ang magkakampi sa bawat laban na haharapin namin. Gets ko na, na hindi lang sakin to mahirap, na masyado ring mahirap itong mundong ito para sa kaniya, kaya’t ano pa’t para dumagdag pa ako sa mga kalaban niya.I feel like most daughters shares this same sentiments and dreams for their mothers of wanting them to choose themselves even if it means not having the chance to be born in this world, and that’s what makes me love this movie. It comforted me to have the perception of making that dream come true for my own mom. It showed the depth of the understanding between the mother and their child especially their daughters. Just when we thought it’s already deep, it could get more deeper.Gets ko na.

I am pro abortion but I never really know kung gaano kalalim yung pinaglalaban natin, well atleast not until I saw this film.Bilang lalaki na manonood, I can only empathize & be compassionate towards sunshine because I feel like nobody can understand her better than women themselves. Highlight ng film for me is yung scene ni Maris sa motel, besides feeling a sense of dread, it also fills me with anger dahil babae pa din talaga ang sasalo sa lahat ng hirap. Anong ginawa ng nakabuntis? binigyan lang ng pera si sunshine, that’s it. Si sunshine yung naghirap, nasaktan, at napahiya. Kaya ang galing ng pelikula kasi nakuha niya gaano pa rin ka pabor ang mundo sa mga kalalakihan.Ang ganda ng casting, sobrang buhay nila na pwede ko lang silang makita sa labas ng bahay namin. Favorite performance ko ay si Maris at Jennica, hayop sa galing! (Grabe yung iyak ko sa kwarto scene nila) Ganda ng cinematography, editing, at music.

Sunshine,"This is a really controversial topic especially in the Philippines where abortion is not accepted both legally and as normal norm. Anyways, the movie did great in relying why sometimes some reasons do weigh more in terms of accepting an unwanted child birth, but well I do not actively support it but I respect it. I am not to judge to what they do, because sometimes when you think about it, like for instance that 13 girl who was raped by her mother's boyfriend(What an absolute ahole btw and also the mother??? which brings me that some women is not fit to be a mother. So if you do not want a child please don't be stupid and use protection like always.) is such a nightmare and to think that girl probably do not fully grasp the whole situation she is in, I understand why she also did what she did. Also to end this, if abortion is not allowed, why is contraceptive allowed? Like isn't like almost the same? You are not giving the reproductive cells do well some reproduction. The only difference is that abortion is the baby is already alive but the reproductive cells is prevented to be much more(a new life).",2025-12-05,positive,0.8846801519393921,9

Sunshine,"Worth the year long wait, brilliant film and really cements Antoinette Jadaone as an Auteur of Philippine Cinema. I think what I found so strikingly sad about this is that, fourteen years removed from the Philippines (more than half of my life!); I try to tread carefully when I talk about Manila, the people and their struggles. I don't think that my incredibly sheltered memory of the place would hold as much cultural weight than that of a local, and yet fourteen years later Manila is still...Manila. And if I am brought to tears by this, I wonder about the grief carried by generations of young women failed by a dated system. In all her films, what Jadaone ultimately wants, or rather demands for her female protagonists, is Space. Space to exist safely and choose freely.To break women out of crowded public maternity wards with shared beds, obsolete facilities, abject doctors (with their religious biases), and to bring them into the clearing of their dreams, the main-stage gymnasium, the Olympics.",2025-12-05,positive,0.9943587183952332,-1

Sunshine,"“Ayoko maging nanay. Hindi ko ipapanganak ‘to dahil hindi ako ready maging nanay.” / English: I don’t want to be a mother. I won’t give birth to this child because I’m not ready to become a mother.Abortion is illegal in the Philippines, heck even being pro-choice here is looked down upon. Yet, motherhood is an expected life trajectory for many Filipino women, that is if you marry at the “right age” and have more than 1 child at the “right time”. So what choice do women have if they are pregnant under different circumstances? For a country that claims to be collectivist (pakikipagkapwa tao mindset ang dapat pinapairal, etc.), how can this principle become a universal behavior for most when its own government continues to throw its own citizens under the bus? Every dire problem that needs to be addressed can be traced back to how fucked Filipinos are by their government. Whatever rhetoric the Spaniards spread about Filipinos being “lazy” is still used today by the rich and powerful, their basis why the Philippines continues to be poor. Galit na galit ako sa nagtitinda ng mga pekeng “gamot” para sa pagpapalaglag ng bata, the review she showed Sunshine that it was effective could possibly be fake, pero narealize ko na nagbebenta sila ng pekeng solusyon para sa maka ahon sa buhay (not justification of this behavior). This government continues to fail people in every aspect of life, you’d realize why the crime is so high. But is it such a crime to not want a baby? (It is not).How can Filipinos truly care for the children (whether born or unborn) when elected officials undermine reproductive health in this country, primarily women’s health. The Reproductive Health Law faced a long legislative battle just to get passed, and it still took two years for the law to be fully accessible for the public. When your prospects are so thin, people will do anything to get what they want, even if it costs their life. That is a hard pill to swallow for a lot of Filipinos. At the end of the day, Filipinos are treated as just mere statistics in politics.",2025-12-05,negative,0.8003368377685547,2

Sunshine,"Sunshine (2024) looks soft, warm, almost gentle on the surface. the colors cradle you, the scenes feel tender, and at first, you think it is comforting. but beneath all of that warmth carries a weight that is impossible to ignore. it is about abortion in the Philippines, where it is illegal, and labeled as “blasphemous,” “disgraceful,” and judged above the lives it affects. the film does not shy away from showing how cruel reality can be. people, even doctors, prioritize morality over humanity, ignoring the pain, the fear, and the uncertainty of the woman at the center. it shows a woman whose future and potential clash with society’s judgment.the unknown girl who follows Sunshine feels like a younger version of herself. she is the part of Sunshine that believes abortion is wrong, the part that cannot yet grasp the weight of a life lived on someone else’s terms. and yet, by the end, she mutters, “gets ko na.” she sees that Sunshine’s life is not a simple question of right and wrong. she feels the burden Sunshine carries, the life she cannot give without losing herself. she recognizes how much was left for Sunshine to live, how much potential to burn bright, and how pregnancy would have dimmed it. she senses the life that should have belonged to Sunshine alone.the realization does not absolve, it recognizes the choices forced upon someone who should have been free to live her life on her own terms. that recognition shatters you more than any argument, any moral lesson ever could.watching this film, you feel everything at once. the warmth of the colors, the softness of the scenes, the love in small gestures, and then the ache, the rage, the grief that lingers because the world can be cruel, unfair, unfeeling. Sunshine is about life that is too heavy for the judgment of others. it is about the potential snuffed out when morality is chosen over empathy. it is about understanding, even when the world cannot. it is gentle, devastating, and necessary. it will stay with you long after the credits roll.Sunshine is soft to watch, hard to forget, and brutally honest about the ways society fails those who need understanding the most.it will make you feel what it is to live, to choose, to survive, and to understand when understanding is all that remains.",2025-12-05,positive,0.9708520174026489,1

Indirectly, the filmmaker supports having an abortion for the sake of her dreams and future life.Imagine what if mom chooses not to give birth to me in order to achieve her dreams of her youth. of course I won't mind, I will gladly support mom to get the life she longs forRemembered the conversation that night, about mom's childhood dreams. we all felt guilty hearing her dreams, but mom didn't blame it, she was ready to be a mother, she said her future was her child.

WTHthere are scenes that subtly depicts women's maternal challenges alongside the ”abortion dilemma” such as the jeep with the banner written ‘God’s Gift’ and Sunshine and her boy relative (not sure if it’s her niece or cousin) passing the baby responsibilities to each other. and ultimately, women, carrying the burden of bearing a childhonestly, I don’t think that this movie promotes abortion itself. it just layers out the challenges of unexpected pregnancy in women—physically, emotionally, socially, and career-wise. so to those boomers who says otherwise, F Uthis is so refreshing to see in the PH's film discography, i mean, IM SO GLAD THAT ITS NOT A MOVIE ABOUT AFFAIRS OR MISTRESSES... the ending tho (im still trying to convince myself that a final performance would be too much and the ending is right the way it should be, hence a 4 ) did i mention how this movie perfectly encapsulates the double standards in women?",2025-12-05,positive,0.9841716885566711,-1

Sunshine,"“kasalanan sa mata ng diyos”is abortion a sin? people will answer this differently because morality in the philippines is rarely personal. it is inherited by religion, tradition, and the weight of everyone watching. for many, the word “abortion” automatically activates the label of sin, as if life were a simple moral equation and suffering didn’t count as part of the formula. for others, it is a decision carved out of fear, pressure, and survival, made in the middle of circumstances that no outsider fully understands. kung ginahasa ka, kasalanan pa rin ba ang pagpapalaglag sa bata? if your answer is yes, then your moral compass is calibrated more by dogma than empathy, and your worldview is as rigid as the doctrine you inherited without questioning.conservatism in the philippines is not subtle. it is soaked into daily life, in families, in pulpits, reinforced by laws that pretend neutrality but are shaped by centuries of religious influence. sa bansa natin, halos lahat ng desisyon ng babae ay may kasamang mata ng lipunan na handang humusga, tama? abortion becomes more than a medical choice; it becomes a cultural crime, a symbol that people weaponize even when they know nothing about the life behind the decision. the environment itself—manila’s density, poverty, inequality, survivalism—creates conditions where choices are never purely “moral.” what do you expect from a city where half the population is just trying to get through the day?when you strip away the labels, the question of sin becomes less religious and more philosophical. sin implies intent, malice, or moral wrongdoing. abortion, for many, is none of these. if you’d ask me i’d say that, it is not an act of cruelty. it is a response to reality, a calculated survival decision shaped by pressure that most people never experience. kung hindi mo kailanman naramdaman ang desperasyon ng isang taong walang mapuntahan, anong karapatan mong magsabing mali ang pinili niya? reducing abortion to “sin” ignores everything: economic instability, trauma, lack of support systems, inaccessible healthcare, fear of judgment, and the sheer brutality of living in a country that demands endurance but offers nothing in return.the real discussion is not about moral purity but about environment. what context shaped the choice? what access to resources existed? what physical, emotional, and social risks will the woman face? people prefer judgment over understanding because judgment feels easier. introspection requires effort, and compassion requires complexity—two things society often avoids.if morality is measured by harm done, abortion may not be a sin at all. it may be a reflection of a society that fails its people so deeply that they must make decisions the world refuses to understand. sa totoo lang, mas madali para sa lipunan na manisi kaysa kumilala ng sistematikong pagkukulang. we condemn individuals because it distracts us from confronting the bigger failure—the environment that gave them no safe path.the real sin might not be in the act of abortion but in the society that makes someone carry the weight alone. a society that romanticizes suffering, worships conformity, and punishes anyone who chooses survival over tradition. a society that has the audacity to moralize while refusing to provide support, empathy, or alternatives.",2025-12-05,negative,0.6459452509880066,2

Sunshine,"""Do you understand me?""""I get it""Jadaone's Sunshine portrays the raw, harrowing, and excruciating journey of a young gymnast who found out that she is pregnant, just months before Olympics qualifiers. The emotional turmoil that sends her into a downward spiral ghastly encapsulates the prevalent issue of teenage and accidental pregnancies in the Philippines and how public's notions that are grounded from bigotry, conservatism, and outdated values can negatively imbue the minds of these helpless women.The fragments of Sunshine's psyche of children also deepened the already thematically layered piece where it now provides the protagonist a whole new outlook whether she should carry on with the pregnancy or terminate it. What I really love about it is the film stays grounded to its footing and steadily focuses on putting the audience in Sunshine's lens. The last act with the kid is a top-notch and probably the most heartwarming scene in the whole film.Maris Racal's impeccable performance also puts the cherry on top where the in-depth introspect of a young woman that is going down the rabbit hole won't be solidified without her.

And to my mom who had dreams too, until she found out she was pregnant with me, she was torn a real 50/50 on whether to keep me or not. She chose to keep me and eventually married my dad.Sometimes I can’t help wondering what her life could’ve been if she pursued her own dreams.

Sunshine,"Sunshine is a feat for Philippine cinema. It tackles a topic most are scared to produce and it was written WELL. Yes, without the poverty porn or political porn most films of ours subtexts. There are characters that are REAL. Not written to tell unjustly-unrelated issues but to support the story itself. And so, characters that are in poverty aren’t written to convey another message, rather to stand with what the film is about in the first place. This film is easily the one of the best written films of all time in our history. Not only does it tell a beautiful picture of a character undergoing such a life-turning “accident” but how it tells it psychologically, and powerfully. It never let go of what it portrays nor does it settle for a scene that would bring in viewers, it’s written SO realistically that you’d forget it’s a movie. A quick one to point out is Sunshine texting her bestfriend, at the time she needs support the most, even if she’s disappointed for losing contact with her, she still texts out of fear, and that’s something i’m sure plenty of people have done. Those text messages are so real, raw and incredibly well-written too. The whole story is an absolute masterclass of writing a film straightforwardly without losing the essence of what it is. It’s a display of perfect world-building, from the story of her boyfriend, the realistic response from him to the story of the tindera, who without building a relationship, completely makes sense of the film. Even built a subtext of a no nonsense coach that adds to fear, support, motive and regret of the main character.I can tell you all about the beautiful writing but this would be too long. Let’s get to the cinematography. Well, it’s good. Definitely better than most films, it’s quite obvious that certain camera works and shots aren’t just to finish the scene but is chosen to look good while portraying a scene nicely. There’s a lot of cues that whispers visually, like how she prays with bars infront of her, evoking the feeling of our character not FEELING or BEING welcome inside the church. Shot-selections like those sre essential and quite reliable to make a scene impactful so i’m incredibly proud they excerted better effort to make this film the best it could possibly be. Wouldn’t say it’s a strong suit, but this fil is definitely visually well-made.I’ve always seen Maris Racal as a great actress before this, now she’s PHENOMENAL one and is one of the best in the industry right now. The talent to portray talent and skill alone, is something most actors/actresses not only have the chance to audition for BUT absolutely nails from the first to the last second of the film. There’s a Piolo Pascual jumpscare here, Elijah Canlas KILLS it AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.Sunshine is great, it’s amazingly told through emotions and a bit of a psychologically present engagement to allow interpretations of viewers be as wide as it can.",2025-12-04,positive,0.9941403269767761,1

It should be part of women’s rights that their safety is guaranteed no matter the situation. Because abortion is not accessible in this country, women tend to rely on unsafe methods that could harm their bodies or, worse, could kill them. Other people shouldn’t have an opinion on what women choose to do with their bodies. Legalizing abortion doesn’t mean encouraging all pregnant women to get one—it means giving women safe options if they don’t want to keep that little chunk of blood cells in their body, instead of forcing them into unsafe methods that could be fatal.I will always stand by the fact that abortion should be legal.",2025-12-04,positive,0.9539976119995117,25

Pero they ignore what's happening around the world. They ignore that there's a genocide happening in Sudan and in Gaza. Wala silang pake. Tapos when it comes to women's reproductive health, hala gustong mangialam. Bida bida ka teh? Stupid laws! Yes im pertaining to divorce and abortion.You care so much about life pero wala kang pake even if it endangers the life of the mother. You care so much about the sanctity of marriage yet you turn a blind eye when there are millions of women being abused.Ang kapal mo naman.Catholic daw kasi.Duh, Catholic country din ang Spain pero they separated criminal law. Tapos yung ayaw pang mag pasa ng abortion bill is yung may mga case pa against humanity, haha kalokohan.Those law dont protect anyone.Anti-abortion law cannot make the woman love the child lalo na if that child is the everyday reminder of what hell she went through. Kawawa parehas diba? The kid's unloved, tapos reminder pa ng pang aabuso sa nanay niya. Anti-divorce law can't make a broken family happy again. It not just damage the parents, but also the kids. ""Kids might suffer from broken families"" daw kasiAh, so, ipipilit mo? So mas okay na nakikita ng mga anak nila na nagsisigawan sila, na nag sasakitan at ginagawang punching bag yung nanay nila kaysa maghiwalay?!Keeping these bans doesn’t uphold morality, it endangers women, silences survivors, and empowers abusers.You're not protecting anyone but the perpetrators.And I hope this film serves as a message.",2025-12-04,negative,0.9133816957473755,2

Sunshine,"Sunshine is one of those rare Filipino films that refuses to look away. Instead of sugarcoating or romanticizing the world its characters inhabit, it confronts the audience with the uncomfortable truths we collectively sidestep—the toxic mindsets we inherit, the social issues we normalize, and the moral rigidity we mistake for virtue.What makes the film remarkable is its honesty. It acknowledges how deeply ingrained complacency is in our culture, how we often witness injustice, misogyny, or dysfunction and simply shrug, labeling it as “ganun talaga.” Sunshine exposes that mentality for what it is: a quiet violence that enables suffering. The film does not preach; it simply presents the weight of these realities with clarity and emotional intelligence, letting the audience feel the consequences of silence and inaction.Its commentary on anti-abortion attitudes is especially bold for Philippine cinema. Rather than reducing the debate to dogma or melodrama, the film shows how anti-abortion rhetoric becomes a peril for women; not just physically, but emotionally, socially, and economically. It reveals how denying reproductive autonomy restricts their futures, limits their ambitions, and punishes them for choices men are rarely held accountable for. Sunshine portrays this with nuance: the internal conflict, the fear of judgment, the systemic lack of support, and the complete absence of safe options. The film understands that this isn’t just a “moral issue”—it’s a structural one, tied to poverty, misogyny, and societal expectations about what women owe to the world.Ultimately, Sunshine is more than a movie; it’s a critique of the culture that raised us. It forces us to ask why we maintain harmful traditions, why morality is weaponized against women, and why we accept inequality as a norm. Its power lies in its refusal to let the audience remain comfortable, and in reminding us that the first step toward progress is learning to confront what we’ve been taught to ignore.",2025-12-04,positive,0.9393126964569092,1

Sunshine,"Films like this make me realize how great the potential of the PH film industry is when it comes to storytelling, creativity, and taking risks. Sunshine proves exactly that. Ang tapang ng pelikulang ‘to, not just in the execution, but sa choice of subject matter. Makamasa, madaling kapitan, and at the same time, a real eye-opener. From start to finish, ramdam mo yung puso at bigat ng kuwento, and yet ang linis ng pagkakadala.Maris Racal shines in a way that’s both raw and controlled; she gives a performance that stays with you long after the credits roll. Jennica Garcia is equally powerful, grabe yung presence niya, every scene hits (we all need a family member like her!!). Together, they carry the emotional core of the film so well na hindi mo mapigilang maapektuhan like ALL I CAN SAY IS I REALLY LOVE WOMEN SM.But above all, very important yung conversation na binubuksan ng Sunshine. Abortion is a difficult, nuanced topic—one that should be openly discussed not just within families, but within our society and government. And I firmly believe na choosing yourself first, your success, your safety, your future matters just as much. AND, women should be able to decide for themselves: their body, their rules. This isn't a simple issue, and the film treats it with the depth and humanity it deserves.Sunshine is indeed a courageous and a necessary film that everyone should watch!!",2025-12-04,positive,0.9779938459396362,-1

ABORTION IS SELF AND HEALTH CARE. Wala ‘yan sa susustentuhan naman, pananagutan naman, etc. Women have every right to decide what to do in this kind of situation. An opinion from a man is not needed — NEVER. A woman gets to decide what they want to do with their body. Sobrang raw ng emotions, kaya pala nasabihan si Maris na haggard/hindi fresh during shoot kasi ‘yan pino-portray niya. Isang 19 year old na gymnast na pangarap maging olympian — nabuntis at walang malapitan, walang mahingan ng tulong kundi tiktok, reddit, at twitter. Kuhang kuha yung situation sa Quiapo, yung mga nagtitinda ng mga pamparegla sa tapat ng simbahan, mga nagdadasal sa simbahan, etc. Abortion should be legal, really. Kaysa kung ano anong solusyon gawin ng mga kababaihan para lang makapag-abort, why not gawin na lang in a safe and legal way? Masyadong relihiyoso mga tao, ‘di mo na alam kung ano pinaglalaban e. Kanino lalapit ang kababaihan kundi sa mga 2.5-3.5k na pampalaglag na gamot na nabibili sa Quiapo at online? Haist, I love you, Sunshine.

Sunshine,"More didactic than her previous films, but this is still a great “social issues” drama (albeit one with some magical realist touches), with a moving central performance. In terms of “abortion movies,” it really does a great job of making its case. For a teenage gymnast, carrying a baby to term really does completely remove that path as a possibility for her life—that dream just gets immediately destroyed, in a way that (obviously) won’t happen for the baby’s father, and it’s why it’s so essential to this film’s success that Jadaone so skillfully captures the tactile and practical *reality* of Sunshine’s body in the gymnastic scenes: that body, with its graceful and athletic movements, that she has spent her entire life molding for this sole purpose of Olympic gold, and it will go away, permanently, if she doesn’t have an abortion. I also think Jadaone does a good job of avoiding deck-stacking. Yes, the pro-life nurse who castigates Sunshine is portrayed as a witch, but the saleswoman who gives her the abortifacients is also shown to be a greedy haggler herself. And while the two male figures pressuring her to have the baby (her boyfriend and her boyfriend’s father) both make specious and insincere cases, it is again to Jadaone’s credit that she cast two dynamic male performers for these roles (Elijah Canlas and Pio Pascual—whom I didn’t recognize in a straight-up “Dad” role, after decades playing the heart-throb!)…this is one of those reviews where in the process of writing it I’ve realized I liked the movie a lot more than I thought I did while the credits were rolling.

Sunshine,"One of the biggest factors holding back the Philippines from being as progressive as our neighboring countries like China and Japan is our deep entanglement with religion—Christianity, in particular. As much as faith shapes our culture, it also becomes a hindrance to national progress when religious beliefs are imposed on matters that should prioritize the welfare and rights of all citizens. Imagine how much better our society could be if we allowed personal freedoms and evidence-based policies to guide our decisions, instead of insisting on religious doctrine as the standard for everyone.The movie portrayed this reality so powerfully. It addressed so many issues in one narrative—how women are often the ones who suffer the most under a misogynistic system, how men can easily walk away from responsibilities while women cannot, and how horrifying it is that young girls, even minors, can be raped and then forced to bear a child. These are the consequences of a society that refuses to give women full autonomy over their own bodies.I truly hope more people come to realize the importance of allowing women to make decisions for themselves by legalizing abortion. Every woman deserves the right to choose what happens to her own body.Despite the heaviness of the story, I’m glad that Sunshine still managed to pursue the dream she longed for, proving that resilience can still bloom even in the harshest circumstances.",2025-12-04,positive,0.9691411852836609,-1

Sunshine,"I may be on the unpopular side of this: I want to love this so badly but for some reason, I can't help to mull-on & pinpoint some details lacked for me and thought it needed more revising story-wise. I am not hating on this. In fact, I actually like several parts of the movie. I think it's fair to say (and undeniably so) that this is an important and a refreshing story on what's the take of abortion & body autonomy here in the Philippines and I do appreciate this movie for that. (I added the half star plus because it still is an important movie)I want to love this movie (but only like it) because I thought it obviously have such a great potential to be ""a great movie"" on most aspects. What holds me back is the writing, story-wise.It started really strong and direct to the point which I really liked. By the next part, we'd see a little girl who follows Sunshine. At first it seems to me that it could be her inner child or her unborn future child so it confused me a bit (most especially on the part where Sunshine was rushed to the hospital, we'd see a blood on her crotch area as well). This device they used provided a bit of comic relief in the movie which I thought is cute and actually can be an effective way to delve deeper sentimentally because its so personal. However, I came to learn (through online reading) that she is indeed her unborn future child (bc of Ariana disappearing). To be honest, I couldn't finalize my thoughts on this whether I like it or not because with that in mind, the mix message does confuse some a bit on whether or not it's a ""pro-life"" but I guess that could also be the point that it is complicated. Afterall, Sunshine did kept coming back to the church scenes and this can represent a lot of women who faces/d the same situation. I just thought the movie might have to clarify in telling that message.I also much prefer her being Sunshine's inner child (which could be a ""tangible"" reminder on what the whole movie is all about, Sunshine taking control of her own life and the dream of being a national athlete ever since she's a child). But the line ""Gets ko na"" have such a great impact on people because of its ""casualness"" but its the words that has a really heavy weight on it that I thought is effective to pull people's heartstrings in. Another aspect of the movie that kinda lacked for me which is, I think a big part of it: I want to see how much Sunshine wants it by seeing her own training to be a gymnast. What does she do every day as a training athlete? How does she balance everything in her life-- being a sister/aunt/student/friend/a woman in general while also being a training athlete? What do you to do train as a gymnast? How heavy does it weigh on her that she's truly doing every thing she can to be in olympics and be a great gymnast, what does it look like? I wished she saw that a bit (even just in a montage) before or during the moment she found out she got pregnant. I want to see her really work hard and see how much blood, sweat, and tears and really feel and see that ""goddamn it i want this so bad"" and not just tell it. I guess what I want to say is that I want more training scenes too because I am also interested in watching gymnasts do their thing haha.I also thought that by the 3/4 part of the movie where we do meet Ariana is kinda took a different turn for the movie. I am not sure if it is necessary that we meet another kid (Ariana, not Mary Grace) and that maybe without that, they could still end up getting the same storyline/result (though don't get me wrong, I did like Ariana, i think she's fab). It also didn't do much impact on Sunshine's decision but rather it does prove how fucked up it is that this happen in reality and how shitty it is again that we don't have much (legal and safe, known) access to women's sexual and reproductive health services, let alone being a woman/person who's forced into something they aren't ready to be/never wanted be in the first place.More so, the visuals and cinematography, can't deny that it is beautiful, that's a given. Acting is amazing, no notes no doubt.A little predictable on emphasizing on the Manila landscape and scenery although it is still beautiful to look at (especially considering to people haven't been to Manila/Philippines, at least they'd get the gist of it even though its not all picturesque all the time). I especially appreciate the movie getting in deep and showing the grim & messy ways of taking different methods of abortion. I thought its very important to see how harrowing and fucking hard/harsh/unfair/dangerous it is that women have to/had no choice to do experiences like these. I only wished that they showed the method of when Sunshine made an appointment for that Doctor Helena because maybe it could also show that abortion could also have safe and harmless way that would make people feel less wary and scared of it and maybe even talk about it.With all that, in conclusion I think I do like this movie. It is an important movie to exists especially at our modern times, it's long overdue that we finally talk about this here in our country. I hope we keep talking about it because it is necessary for us we want to keep fighting for women's rights. I don't love it but I do like it and I appreciate it for what it did.",2025-12-04,positive,0.9343748092651367,9

Sunshine,"this is what the filipino people need to see more often. it might be obscure for some, but it is timely and important. teenage mothers are often judged for carrying a child; whether they keep it or not, judgement will still eye on them. the guilt of their conscience will still haunt and hunt them. but we never get to see their point of view, we only see them for the mistakes they have done. where is that energy when it comes to boys who choose to abandon the outcome of their bad decisions? nowhere. i love how this film doesn’t just show us the story of a teenage girl who got pregnant while chasing her dreams—it is a story of all the girls and women who are forced to carry a baggage they never asked for. we saw their hardships and struggles. it also shows us how flawed our system is and how hypocritical some religious people are. this should be a wake up call. the little girl (annika) doesn’t just represent sunshine’s unborn child—she also represents us. we only see abortion and choosing oneself as something wrong and sinful because we are too blinded by what was merely taught to us. we never get to see or feel what others feel. and once we do, we will understand them. that is when we will realize. let’s be more like the little girl, let’s try to understand more.i also love that they chose manila as the setting of this film. it might not be important but i think it is. manila is messy, scary, and it will kill you. but once you overcome it, you’ll see its beauty.lastly, sorry pero super bothered talaga ko sa part na nasa lope de vega na sila tapos ang layo pa ng hospital na pinuntahan nila e mas malapit naman ang metro, san lazaro, or jose reyes.  bothered lang ako pero gets ko naman kung bakit, so wala na lang yon, di siya mahalaga. hahaha",2025-12-03,positive,0.8127827644348145,9
Sunshine,"Source: www.reeladvice.net/2025/12/sunshine-2024-movie-review.htmlAntoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine has been one of our most anticipated local releases of the year and it does not disappoint. Emotionally charged and socially resonant, the film tackles teen pregnancy and the realities of limited reproductive rights in the Philippines with honesty and empathy. While it may not offer clear-cut moral answers, Sunshine succeeds in revealing the real and painful stakes of becoming a young mother tackling equally both sides of the moral coin.National gymnast Sunshine (Maris Racal) has always dreamed of competing in the Olympics. With qualifiers fast approaching, she pushes her body to its limits until she suddenly faints during training. What she assumes is exhaustion from her intense regimen and strict diet turns out to be something far more life-altering: she is pregnant. At only 19 and with her lifelong dream on the line, Sunshine faces a bitter decision: keep the child and lose her final chance at the Olympics, or pursue an illegal abortion and grapple with the moral and emotional fallout.As expected, Sunshine doesn’t shy away from tough conversations. Its central dilemma is painfully relatable, regardless of where you stand on the right to choose in a predominantly Catholic country. Maris Racal is a revelation, delivering a nuanced and deeply human performance as a young athlete forced to confront consequences that will shape the rest of her life. And while we won’t spoil where the story ultimately lands, the film takes a definitive stance without betraying the complexity of its subject matter. It was a balancing act handled with notable care.What elevates Sunshine further is how vividly it captures the societal pressures and chaotic realities of Philippine society when it comes to the right to choose. The judgment, the ironies, the lack of support systems, everything feels painfully authentic and grounded. Where the film stumbles slightly is in its more fantastical elements. Though the intent behind these sequences is clear, they often feel out of place and not fully integrated into the narrative, appearing more convenient than cohesive. Still, Sunshine is a compelling and important watch and not only for Maris Racal’s standout performance but for its bold and compassionate exploration of an issue that remains deeply relevant in modern Philippine society. It’s a film that provokes and ultimately shines.",2025-11-27,positive,0.9899671077728271,1

Sunshine,"Isa sa mga realistic films na napanood ko. Tbh, okay siya kumpara sa mga Filipino films, okay na okay talaga 'to. Prob ko lang, hindi ko masyadong naramdaman yung SEA GAMES na sasalihan niya. Walang pressure from it. Pinapakita nung una na Pagbuo sa bata vs Pangarap niya, hindi gaano najustify yung pangarap niya at ano siya bilang sasali sa Olympics. Ang nakita ko lang don simpleng training na para bang hindi big event yung sasalihan niya. Isang beses ko lang din nakita na may nagpapicture sa kanya. Hindi nagmemake sense sa part na yun. Sana may mas nafeel tayong pressure sa surroundings niya para rin makita natin gaano ito kahalaga para sa kanya. 'Di lang yon, kilala rin tayong bilang mga pilipino na grabe kung sumuporta sa nagrerepresent ng bansa natin. Parang si Manny Pacquiao lang yan or candidate na sasali sa Miss Universe. Kulang sa pressure o justification. Sayang, but honestly, sanay naman na ako sa bansa nating hindi gaano nagiinvest ng budget para sa film.Legit, okay 'to siya.

Sunshine,"this feels very similar to brocka in that it portrays manila as a city full of hardship and loneliness that can leave you so disillusioned and alienated; and where hope and humanity exist on the fringes of it. it's a working-class story with working-class sentiments that fully takes on its own identity because jadaone is able to portray such familar elements in a way that feel completely isolating; the interiors of jeepneys, tricycles, shabby motels, clinics — everything feels so alien. which, i guess, offers many people unfamiliar with what these woman go through a much-needed perspective on the importance of dignity and bodily autonomy and how violent, horrible men try to take that away from many women.i think it's also worth noting that religion and patriarchy play such a prominent role here in oppression; jadaone laser-focused on placing religious beliefs and preconceived notions about abortion in the spotlight, all the more affected by teenage pregnancy and how religion has kind of shaped the way many filipinos treat abortion as something so taboo and inhuman that they completely forget how it affects the mother. and it's brought to life by a really incredible maris racal; shaped by all the adversity — the kind of performance that requires you to bare your soul to the audience, to beg them to see the humanity behind the people suffering from religious oppression, and why access to abortion services — even in a heavily catholic country — is of utmost importance.",2025-12-03,positive,0.9901832938194275,-1

Sunshine,"“Gets ko.”This is the first time na medyo mag-essay ako here because just… wow. Usually, when I watch films, madaldal ako with side comments here and there. Pero habang nanonood ako ng Sunshine, tahimik lang ako. Walang imik. Kasi it didn’t feel like I was watching a script come to life, it felt like I was actually watching Sunshine. Not Sunshine as the protagonist of a movie or a character that Maris plays, but Sunshine as a real person—her, as someone like me. A young girl struggling with the kind of belief system that we have in our country. Bilang babae, nakakatakot na malagay sa sitwasyon na mapapahamak lahat ng pinaghirapan mo, lahat ng pinagtrabahuhan mo buong buhay mo, lahat ng mga pangarap mo. Lahat tayo may karapatan mamili ng kapalaran natin. Kaya gets ko, Sunshine. Gets na gets ko. Hindi dapat tayo inihahalintulad sa demonyo o pinipilit na humingi ng kapatawaran sa kahit sino dahil lang gumawa tayo ng isang desisyon na para sa sarili natin. Hindi para sa pamilya o sa kaibigan, para sa atin.Would I say na the Philippines is ready for these kinds of films? I don’t know, pero parati akong naniniwala na hindi kailangang maging handa ang isang tao o bagay sa lahat ng oras. I think a more important question is: do we need these kinds of films?

Sunshine,"Gets ko na :(It’s not even debatable. ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE. Hindi ko maintindihan kung bakit may mga taong against sa abortion. If you’re against something, you don’t have to do it. Pero bakit kailangan mong ipagkaila yung isang bagay sa taong nangangailangan? Tangina 13 lang sya, nirape ng Tito nya. Imagine na may taong ganito yung sitwasyon. Kung maging legal man ang abortion sa Pinas, hindi ka required na gawin yon. At hindi ka maaapektuhan kung magdedesisyon ang isang tao na gawin yon.Fuck people with this kind of mindset.Imagine, nasa pedestrian lane ka, tapos tatanungin ka kung magpapakamatay ka? Tanga ka ba?Bibili ka lang ng pregnancy test, tapos ijjudge ka at sasabihing, “Mga kabataan ngayon hindi na marunong magpigil.” People just can’t shut their mouths.Fuck the government.Putangina nakakalungkot, everytime na may Pilipino na magkakasakit, una nilang iisipin ay wala silang pera, paano ang gagastusin, at kung anong ipangbabayad nila sa ospital, imbes na isipin ang kalusugan at mangyayari sa kanila. Nakakalungkot pero totoo, and I’ve been a witness of that, yung dalawahan sa higaan at yung konting check up na sobrang mahal, na dapat naman ay libre. Sobra na, bakit ganito? Mayaman ang Pilipinas, pero nasaan? Putangina ng gobyerno, paano nyo nagagawang magpakasasa sa pera habang nakikitang naghihirap ang mga mamamayan? Mas masahol pa kayo sa mga mamamatay tao. Pag may sakit, lilipad ng ibang bansa para magpagamot imbes na ayusin ang healthcare system sa Pinas. Tangina diba?Fuck men and their views to women.Haha tangina, bakit ba sila ganon? Bakit ang tingin nyo sa babae e parang laruan? Pwedeng basta iwanan, itapon, o palitan kapag nagamit na? Bakit tingin ng mga lalaki e sex lang ang pinakamagandang bagay sa relasyon na maiooffer ng isang babae? Putangina, tite lang ba nagpapatakbo sa isip nyo?Thank you sa scene na hinampas ni Sunshine yung bote ng beer yung lalaki, super deserve nya yon.Fuck society for thinking all we’re made for is to procreate and care for our husbands.There’s more to life than men. Literal. Ito yung gusto kong sabihin everytime na may family gathering tapos unang tatanungin sa’kin, “May boyfriend ka na?” Putangina. Nakakapagod. Ito lang ba yung concerning na bagay sa buhay ko? Lalaki? Haha. Pano kung tanungin nyo kamusta yung pag-aaral ko? Ano yung mga bagay na ginagawa ko lately? Ano yung mga lugar na napuntahan ko? Kamusta ako? Wala ba? Lalaki lang ba talaga? “Hindi ako nahihiya, ayoko maging nanay”This was the part where I literally cried, salamat, at least at some point narealize ko, may boses tayo, may karapatan tayong magdesisyon para sa sarili natin, may karapatan tayong piliin kung ano yung tama at mas makakapagpasaya satin.Gets ko na, salamat Sunshine.",2025-12-03,negative,0.9351233243942261,2

Sunshine,"Women in the Philippines continue to grapple with deeply rooted issues such as teenage pregnancy which is made even more complex by the country’s predominantly Catholic identity. The moral codes and expectations instilled in us from childhood often determine whether society views abortion as a sinful act or a necessary choice, and this cultural tension becomes the silent force shaping many young women’s lives.In the film, Maris Racal embodies this struggle with striking emotional clarity. She carries the weight of a decision that no young woman should have to make alone: the impossible choice between holding on to her dream of becoming an Olympian or confronting the life-altering reality of an unexpected pregnancy. Her performance is powerful not because it dramatizes the dilemma, but because it mirrors the experiences of countless Filipinas whose voices are often dismissed or shamed into silence.What elevates the film is how it frames her situation not as a moral failure, but as a human story: one shaped by fear, hope, societal pressure, and the search for agency. Through Racal’s nuanced portrayal, the narrative exposes the cultural contradictions we live with: a society that celebrates the achievements of young women yet imposes rigid expectations on their bodies and choices. The film invites the audience to move beyond judgment and recognize the quiet courage required to stand at the crossroads of identity, aspiration, and responsibility.In grounding a personal crisis within the broader context of Philippine social norms, the film becomes more than a character study; it becomes a commentary on how we, as a society, often fail to extend empathy to young women navigating impossible circumstances. And in that sense, Maris does not just act the role; she embodies a truth many are too uncomfortable to confront.",2025-12-03,positive,0.9400888085365295,-1

Sunshine,"this movie is surprisingly good. i was impressed by how the story centers the lived experiences of marginalized women, showing not just the weight of their decisions, but the harsh realities, judgment, and lack of support they often face. it isn’t about glorifying or condemning anything, but about understanding why some women make the choices they do.this film doesn’t just tell a story, it challenges people to empathize beyond biases. and i think that's beautiful :)",2025-11-25,positive,0.9976621866226196,19

The movie gives you an uncomfortable feeling—exactly what we should feel, because it reflects a truth we need to see and confront.The storytelling of Sunshine’s journey is smart and compelling; every scene gives you chills.

Sunshine,"ABORTION IS KILLING!! THEN JERK OFF AND DON'T FUCK WOMEN!!What makes Sunshine haunt me is how real it feels — not just as a story of a gymnast’s dream, but as a raw, painful portrait of what it means to be young, afraid, and fighting when everything seems stacked against you. The moment the truth sinks in — that this girl, brimming with hope and ambition, is now carrying a life she never asked for — the world she built starts cracking. Maris Racal gives a performance that doesn’t feel like acting — even when she’s silent, you feel every tremor of fear, every doubt, every moment she prays for a different ending. The film doesn’t paint shades of grey — it throws you into a world where choices are dangerous, and every door seems closed.And the way the city closes in around her — tight alleys, cold clinics, judgmental stares, desperation disguised as quiet — Sunshine doesn’t just tell a story. It burrows underneath your skin and refuses to leave. This film isn’t easy or comfortable, but it’s needed — for the stories it refuses to sanitize, for the voices it pulls from the shadows, and for the courage it asks from us to look. If you think you know pain, you might not until you watch Sunshine.",2025-12-03,positive,0.7590253949165344,1

Sunshine,"Finally had a chance to watch this, i was meant to watch this when it was showing at the cinemas but so busy until recently saw news that it was gonna come out on Netflix so i was elated. Haha.I like it so much, i love the cast in this film, and i love seeing this kind of quality in Filipino movies which is super rare these days. The story is about a young woman who has a dream that she pursued her whole life and suddenly she becomes pregnant which risks this dream, and now she has to weigh everything carefully because either which choice she pick will be life-changing. The whole movie revolves around that and we get to be introduced to the characters and the environment around her that is essential and will influence the choice she will make. Here we get to see a real picture even though the story is fictional, as filipinos you could almost grasp the realness out of this film and say, this is the REALITY but we don't have to embrace it, WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT. As a man, I always believed that i am no position to speak about what women should and shouldn't do about their bodies, but will absolutely support the concept of abortion. When we speak about abortion in a country that is like the Philippines, that is so centered on religion, abortion becomes a taboo, illegal and unethical. We also see these professionals, government leaders that support this kind of ideology that abortion is bad blah blah blah. This film is a great commentary and an eye opener to what young women and women in general what they go through, and that abortion should become an option for all women in our society. I will just make it clear that i think this film is not pro abortion or anti life, without directly stating it, the film focuses on making better decisions, the importance of protection, sex is more common than we think which is ironic in the Philippines that is so religious but that’s ok, this country just needs proper education and thats it. PS. If you are going to argue with me about me being ok about abortion or use of protection, I’m going to tell you this, how dare you bring a life in this world, in this country that cant do anything about poverty, cant do anything about corrupt politicians, cant vote right, doesn't have an accessible healthcare and on top of that, if you’re a man, stfu, and if you’re a woman, who is not ready, physically, mentally and financially, Ari and that young girl doesn’t deserve to live like that, on the streets or getting abused. But if you are, financially stable, mentally stable and physically stable with a nice and healthy environment to grow a living thing then go fucking crazy.",2025-12-03,positive,0.9967334270477295,-1

Sunshine,"In spite of her past controversies, Maris Racal's performance in this film is the very reason why she remains in the spotlight. Her acting as Sunshine is spectacular. The story requires someone who is capable of letting the viewers feel the heaviness of her pain, the agony, and the hope of standing up for yourself and for what you want, and she made us feel all of that. And though I may not completely agree with everything that's pointed out here, I really admire Jadaone's attempt and bravery at addressing such a taboo topic, not just in the Philippines but the rest of the world. Being prayerful and always going to church do not give us the right to see ourselves as being more morally upright than others. When you put all of that aside, Sunshine is just a teenager who regretfully made a mistake and who made a decision for herself, stood up for what she wanted, and spared the child from the resentment of a mom from being robbed of her own dreams, and of leading her to what could possibly be a miserable life.She knows she could be ridiculed for that decision, but she lived according to her own terms anyway. And we know that in the end, she is happy, and that's all that matters.",2025-11-28,positive,0.9944174289703369,-1

Sunshine,JAFF 20 - Day 4Sunshine jadi film yang gak gue sangka bakal gue suka banget. Padahal filmnya punya tema yang udah sering diangkat di Indonesia. Apa yang ngebedainnya adalah Sunshine menelusuri proses kepahitan secara utuh; dari berada di puncak karier sampe akhirnya jatuh ke jurang. Uniknya alur ceritanya kerasa ga menye-menye karena punya pendekatan yang lembut dan jenaka.Salah satu hal yang memikat lainnya adalah penggambarkan imajinasi wujud sosok anaknya. Kehadiran elemen ini bikin jembatan emosional antara hubungan ibu-anak jadi begitu kuat dan melekat.Pengemasan closure-nya berani nan kontroversial seakan Sunshine ngajarin kalo menatap masa depan juga adalah salah satu bentuk cinta yang tulus.| 2025 Ranked |,2025-12-02,negative,0.5077270865440369,1

Sunshine,"ang hirap maging babae parang pasan mo ang mundo.ilang minuto pa lang sa pelikula, ramdam mo na kaagad, pinakita na ni direk tonet. una, yung kawalan ng akses sa impormasyong pangkalusugan. karamihan ng babae, katulad ni sunshine, umaasa lang sa sabi-sabi. libo-libong babae ang kumakapit sa peligro ng pagpapalaglag: ilegal na gamot, hilot, o pribadong clinic.pangalawa, babae rin ang makatutulong sa kapwa babae ngunit babae rin ang pwedeng magtulak sayo sa kapahamakan. parehong biktima at minsan instrumento ng isang macho-pyudal na lipunan. maraming eksena ang nagpapakita ng pagtutulungan: si aling nagtitinda ng pampalaglag, buena mano kahit gabi na, may tawad pa dahil alam niyang gipit ka. si ate sa motel, kahit anong sungit, kukuha pa rin ng tulong dahil duguan ka. pero sa kabila ng tulong, nariyan ang mga babaeng nakakulong pa rin sa lumang paniniwala: si doktorang victim-blamer at relihiyosa, yung nanay na nagpapadala sa lalaki niyang kapatid kapalit ng kaligtasan ng kanyang babaeng anak. sa lipunang matagal nang pinagsasamantalahan ang kababaihan, nakakalungkot isipin na nasanay na tayo sa ganitong galaw.maganda ang sunshine, pero higit pa doon, kailangan itong mapanood ng bawat babae—bata man, teenager, o nakatatanda. dito pa lang makikita na may kailangang baguhin sa sistema; hindi tayo dapat masanay sa ganitong kalagayan.sunshine, pangalan mo pa lang, alam mong isa itong pelikula na magpapaalala na lilipas din ang pagpasan ng mundo. para sa lahat ng babae, sabi nga ni sunshine, ""laban lang tayo. kapit lang tayo."" sa dulo, malinaw ang mensahe: hindi babae ang dapat magbago, kundi ang sistemang matagal nang mali ang takbo.",2025-12-03,positive,0.876518189907074,14

Sunshine,"Ang hirap maging babaeng puno ng pangarap. The film Sunshine (2024) resonated with me because it honestly depicts how unforgiving reality can be. It shows how quickly people judge young women, often before they even have a chance to breathe or ask for help. The film also makes painfully clear how the lack of reproductive rights pushes women toward risky, sometimes dangerous choices. You can almost feel Sunshine being boxed in on all sides, not because she did anything wrong, but because society refuses to give her real options.Women in the Philippines face judgment, limited choices, and immense pressure around pregnancy. And the film makes a point I strongly agree with: no government or religious institution should dictate what a woman does with her body. Those decisions belong to the person living that reality, not to people watching from a distance.Sunshine made the right choice. Sobrang taboo sa Pilipinas ang usapang abortion, pero at least the child didn’t grow up feeling guilty or resenting their mother for what might have happened if they hadn’t been born. It’s better for a child to know they were truly wanted, rather than feeling like the product of someone else’s dilemma. Constantly being told they’re a blessing can’t replace the sense of being genuinely chosen.Sana ma-gets ng lahat si Sunshine.",2025-12-03,positive,0.7886843085289001,1

Sunshine,"SOBRA SOBRANG GANDA NG PELIKULA NI DIREK TONETsa sobrang ganda i had to watched it 2 times. hindi ko alam ma fefeel ko after kong unang panuodin ito, sobrang lungkot at bigat dahil alam kong hindi lang ito basta pelikula kundi realidad ng bawat babae, bawat tao, at bawat batang muntik makita ang mundo.i love the jeepney scene, It was a really heavy scene, I think it was me interpreting na iniisip na ni sunshine na 'bakit??, bakit saakin pa? baka hindi na ako makasama sa olympics na ito- bakit?' maybe there was this question of confusion na kahit siya hindi niya masagot.. na kahit saan siya dalhin ni kuya manong at ibaba dala dala parin niya talaga ito (yung bata)I loved how this film not only focuses on abortion rights, but also shows many of the real problems in the Philippines.Napakita talaga kung gaano ka–fucked up ang sistema ng mga hospital dito—kulang sa pasilidad, nagsisiksikan, at ang daming pwedeng mamatay dahil sa ganitong sistema. Sobrang nakakagalit isipin na sa hospital ka pa dapat may chance mabuhay, pero doon ka pa pwedeng bawian.It also shows the messed-up beliefs of people who think it’s “easy” to raise a child. Yung mga nagsasabing “takot mo sa una lang ‘yan” at “biyaya ‘yan ng Panginoon.” I’m not against their beliefs—they’re entitled to them—but I find it toxic. Paano mo kayang sabihin sa isang tao na “biyaya” ito kung galing sa karumaldumal at walang kamalay-malay na kasalanan ng ibang tao? Paano mo sasabihing tanggapin niya na lang ito?I think not everything can be called a blessing. And I don’t think it’s fair to say “binigay ito ng Diyos” kahit mali ang pinanggalingan. When I watched it for the second time, ang dami ko talagang na-notice. Naging malaking tanong sa’kin kung *paano* at *saan* narealize ni Sunshine ang lahat.At first, akala ko si Annika (yung batang babae) was her inner child someone who guides her, the version of herself who dreamed of becoming an Olympian but never got the chance.Yung part sa ilalim ng tulay, nung lumabas na si Ariana — doon ko talaga na-connect. I think Sunshine realized it too. Habang hinahanap niya si Sunshine, hindi siya mapakali. Naging question ko rin talaga kung paano kilala ni Sunshine si Ariana if kakakita niya lang dito? Diba??!And what Ariana said made sense. May part sa movie na sinabi niya na ayaw niyang bumalik sa bahay dahil wala namang may pakialam sa kanya. sabi ni Sunshine doon “Hindi, naguguluhan lang siya.” i think she was referring to marygrace.The conversation between Ariana and Annika (the little girl) really altered my brain.The way they pictured the life they could’ve had in a world they will never get to be part of sobrang bigat..And that line, “Pangarap ko kung anong pangarap ni Sunshine,” grabe.sobrang naiyak ako sa part ng ate niya at si sunshine, grave sobrang galing talaga ni direk tonet. tinanggap at inintindi niya ito ng buong buo mabuhay talaga ang pelikulang ito.Lastly! finally!(ang sobrang daming yap)the last part, yung “gets ko na.” Those words explained everything.It felt like Sunshine was saying,“I hope naiintindihan mo kung bakit ko ‘to ginagawa.”And i know that’s exactly how she felt.Maybe the girl can’t have the world.But no—actually, she did.Because she gave Sunshine the world she always wanted, even if she couldn’t have it herself. ""Pangarap ko kung anong pangarap niya""That “gets ko na” part really hit me.Sobrang bigat. And right after that line,there was a cut showing Sunshine in this moment of relief and it says so much kahit na walang description kahit walang explanation.i love this film na gustong kong yakapin si sunshine at hawakan ang kamay niya at sabihing ""hindi mo ito kasalanan""",2025-12-03,positive,0.9815836548805237,8

It's truly time to wake up and see why abortion is needed especially with teen pregnancies kasi minsan lalaki talaga ang problema, kahit ano sabihin mo, hindi sila kikinig and now women are left with this burden and guilt. The addition of catholic guilt is so UGH AMAZING! Especially with religion being used as a reason to make abortion illegal because it's God's gift. There's so much I want to say about this film but talaga, one of the best films I have watched!!

Sunshine,"i have a lot to say about this movie but if i were to describe it in one sentence, it would be: ang hirap maging babae, at mas mahirap maging babae sa pilipinas. i can tell that this story is well-written. it is my first time watching a filipino movie so realistic and women-focused. this movie depicted the struggles of being a woman—not just sexually, but in all aspects. women are expected to be perfect—capable of carrying the weight, not expected to make any mistakes despite everything hateful is being thrown at us. we are expected to meet and be the standard even if it is out of our capabilities. dahil? babae tayo. at kung ‘di man natin maabot ‘yon, isa tayong kahihiyan. dahil nga, mga babae tayo. kalaban natin ang relihiyon, gobyerno, at bansa na mapang-husga. ika nga ni coach, drown out the noise. but that is not the case. even if you force yourself to be apathetic, you’ll still hear the the voices of the people. mga kabataan nga naman ngayon, hindi na makapag-pigilbawal ‘yan sa batas ng Diyoshindi ko ma-a-admit kaibigan mo dahil illegal ‘yonkung buntis ka, i’ll have to kick you out of my rosteranother thing i loved about this movie is that it was shot in manila and covereed many social issues—making it even more relatable to us filipino. especially when it comes to poverty, dito talaga natin masasabi na mahirap maging mahirap. the film showed the reality of life for those without privilege—struggling to find a tricycle, not having enough money for basic needs, and doing everything we can just to earn a little. even parents are driven to the point of selling their own children.some men, on the other hand, can run away from everything. nakabuntis? kasalanan pa rin natin ‘yang mga babae! kesyo hindi tayo nananamit nang maayos, kesyo tayo raw ang may mali kahit sila naman ang tumakbo sa responsibilidad. here, i saw how cowardly some men can be—afraid to take responsibility for their wrongdoings, and always ready to cling to anyone who will shield them from consequences.lastly, i love how the kids represented their inner child—sunshine’s bata symbolizing her dream of becoming an olympian, while menggay’s bata represented the lgbtq community and her longing to get revenge on those who wronged her. each represented their dreams, no matter how impossible they seemed in their circumstances. each represented their dreams, clinging to whatever little piece of themselves the world hasn’t taken away.",2025-12-02,positive,0.8595951199531555,9

Sunshine,"""gets ko na""that line literally sent me into the abyss. going into the film, i was so confused about the little girl following sunshine. i thought she was sunshine’s inner child, like a guide through the mess, reminding her who she was and what she actually wanted. but when they introduced ariana, the kid that “bata” playmate during that night, everything started clicking.then the incident happened. mary grace (rhed bustamante) tried to get an abortion, and her baby died. when we saw ariana recognize mary grace, and then later, at the hospital, the nurse announced the baby didn’t make it… ariana just disappeared. that’s when it hit me: ariana and bata was supposed to represent the baby, their baby. it felt ironic at first because you’re torn between “should i feel bad?” and “should i feel sad about the literal premise of the film?” but then bata said to sunshine, “gets ko na,” and the whole film just punched my soul.maris racal is easily one of the best actresses of this generation, and sunshine proves that. the film is raw, very indie pinoy cinema vibes, and it works. it also doesn’t shy away from the heavy stuff, like how brutal the philippines can be when judging teenage pregnancy and abortion. the shame, the gossip, the pressure to “keep it,” the lack of safe spaces… the film shows how hard it is for girls to make choices about their own bodies when everyone feels entitled to comment.i just kinda wish they explored sunshine being a public athlete more, like the public eye, the rumors, the judgment she’d face online and her community as the time goes by. the ending showing her making it to the sea games was nice, but i feel like addressing the backlash and the pressure could’ve made the story even stronger.overall: great film. beautiful, painful, and honest. i love you, sunshine.",2025-11-27,positive,0.9724954962730408,-1

Sunshine,"I have a lot of feelings to share about this beautiful and heartbreaking film. Truly a big eye-opener to many Filipinos.Women carry a biological physical pain we are given the moment we are born. Period, childbirth, postpartum, etc. But we also carry the pain this world and men cause. The pain men should be held accountable for. Emotional labour, cultural and religious expectations, rape, pregnancy, forms of abuse, etc. It's like our suffering is pre-written, pre-approved, and expected. And yet the world still has all the audacity to treat us as if we're lesser, fragile, dramatic, overreacting. I think I will never be able to understand the logic of a world that demands strength from women and then punishes us for being strong.Like Sunshine and Menggay, a lot of women out there don't have choices. A lot of women are already deprived of basic rights before they even learn to speak. But then again, society still keeps finding new ways to take more from them.The hypocrisy of the Filipinos in this film is also insane but couldn’t be more well depicted. (It’s actually so much worse in real life.) Filipinos will praise God with one hand and strip women of autonomy with the other. Anti-abortion because “God said so,” but silent about abuse, poverty, rape cases, or the girls forced into motherhood long before they even have the chance to understand themselves. They defend unborn children better than they defend the living women who have to endure the burden of carrying them. Because if they don’t, you will judge them. You will shame them. How is that love? How is that morality? Abortion is criminalized, but sexual abuse cases get dismissed.It’s exhausting. It’s enraging.To all of the Sunshines out there, gets na gets ko kayong lahat. The world keeps underestimating and shaming us, but here we are, still standing, still surviving.To end this, I want to share that one monologue in Fleabag that came back to me after watching this film and inspired my entire review:""Women are born with pain built in. It's our physical destiny—period pains, sore boobs, childbirth. We carry it within ourselves throughout our lives. Men don't. They have to seek it out. They invent all these gods and demons so they can feel guilty about things, which is something we do very well on our own. And then they create wars so they can feel things and touch each other and when there aren't any wars they can play rugby. We have it all going on in here, inside. We have pain on a cycle for years and years and years, and then just when you feel you are making peace with it all, what happens? The menopause comes. The fucking menopause comes and it is the most wonderful fucking thing in the world. Yes, your entire pelvic floor crumbles and you get fucking hot and no one cares, but then you're free. No longer a slave, no longer a machine with parts. You're just a person.""",2025-11-28,positive,0.8239359259605408,9

Sunshine,"It was true when they said that this was a brave film. To be one of the first films in pinoy cinema to explore a pro-choice and an unwanted pregnancy narrative is indeed brave, especially when you know the Philippines’ socio-political and religious climate around topics regarding sex, female desires, pregnancy, bodily autonomy, and parenthood.There were unfortunately some parts of the film that felt like they didn’t work.I’m not sure but Sunshine’s decision to abort felt too quick. And her dream to be an Olympian felt underexplored and more of her coach’s. We’re told rather than shown that it was hers.The inclusion of Annika Co whose character can be interpreted as Sunshine’s subconscious/ego or unborn child or whatnot sometimes felt irritating to watch (sorry not sorry). But I guess to reach more towards a predominantly Filipino audience and to highlight Sunshine still being a (teen) child who’s forced to confront the consequences of her choices by a child: worked? I don’t know. Not to mention that it felt a little silly to include two other characters, where one was another pregnant teen girl, that lowkey felt like their stories were being shoved down to the audience’s throats. And in the end, felt shallow. I just think that I hoped they showed more of the technicalities of her being an athlete. Rhythmic gymnastics is considered an elite sport. And when you consider it in the Philippine context – the film didn’t really show what was at stake of being an athlete in this sport. The film’s strong aspects are definitely on the score, cinematography (particularly to highlight the corners of Manila as this chaotic, packed, and cruel city), and of course: Maris’ performance as Sunshine. There were scenes that hit hard and heavy. The irony of abortion drugs sold and found in the street outside a church. The motel scene to show Sunshine’s quiet desperation. Her final rehearsal for her routine before her “gets ko na” scene with Annika (where I cried unfort bcz luteal phase duh).The film does show you a glimpse of the unforgiving reality of what many Filipino women go through everyday: teenage pregnancy, overcrowded and underfunded public hospitals, and the lack of comprehensive sexuality education about sexuality and sexual and reproductive health. It lacked, sure. But I guess, for pinoy cinema to start tackling difficult topics such as this: it’s a start.",2025-12-02,positive,0.6743590831756592,-1

Sunshine,"a well-crafted filipino movie made by a woman for women. napakagaling ni maris (OH MY GOD TALAGA) napaka oscar worthy ng performance niya. so happy to see xy and rhed too! ang galing ng buong casts! production design team deserves so much flowers too!ramdam na ramdam sa Sunshine gaano kahirap maging babae sa isang patriyarkal na lipunan. ramdam na ramdam din ang korupsyon ng gobyerno: kalagayan ng mahihirap & bulok na healthcare system ng pilipinas. sobrang daming issues ang natackle on this movie (and i believe they were not surface level at all). nakakalungkot at nakakagalit ang realizations 'to the point na maiiyak ka talaga (i Can vouch. lmao).""Naiintindihan mo ba ako?"" ""Gets ko na.""i interpreted the child as her inner conscience kasi pinakita how societal standards (ex: religion na sobrang evident sa movie) affected her decision-making. thats why gustong gusto ko yung linya na yan, kasi sunshine felt na everything was already settled for her and all noises were finally shut out. mas mahalaga parin talaga ang mga pangarap niya para sa kanya.this movie begs the watchers to Be More Understanding. ganun lang kasimple. intindi na hindi lahat ay pare-pareho; at for sunshine & menggay's cases, intindi na hindi lahat ay handang maging ina. unawa lang sa sitwasyon ng iba. tunay naman na abortion is not for all, pero may iba parin na Kailangan ito. why restrict the choices of others diba? legalizing accessible and safe abortion helps girls like sunshine and menggay. no one deserves to be go through those levels of pain. direk tonet's best work yet imo!!!! sunshine is indeed a movie that can move you + can change one's thoughts about abortion. altho i believe sobrang long way to go pa natin. malayo pa tayo sa pinaglalaban natin, ngunit walang imposible. :)",2025-11-30,positive,0.9673935174942017,-1

Sunshine,"“naiintindihan mo ba ako?”oo, gets ko na.”this film is raw, relevant and worth seeing. it goes to show that it’s not about changing one’s political belief, but about having radical kindness. the film doesn’t intend you in changing sides, but it teaches you to be more understanding of people’s choices. i’ve known sunshines in my life - a co-worker, a co-worker’s sister, close friends, and old classmates back home. and it’s just sad just how much they were under scrutiny for, for something they should have total control over. it infuriates me even further to realize that back home, abortions are not accessible, and are illegal even. oftentimes the women are frowned upon because of our country’s conservative and religious culture, they face shame and judgement first before they can even get to decide of their own autonomy. meanwhile, the men that are responsible can get to walk away from all scrutiny just because it’s not theirs to hold and carry. to all the sunshines that we know, get to know and may not know yet, they deserve to talk about these things openly, not in secret, not in shame. sunshine reminds us that we definitely have a long way to go. yet a little empathy can go a long way.",2025-12-02,positive,0.9642019271850586,-1

Sunshine,"I don't remember where I first heard of it, but the idea has always stayed with me: for every abortion, miscarriage, or infertility, if a women desires to be a mother, it will come to her at the right time—in one form or another.And I think this film beautifully echoes hints of that belief.The part where Sunshine asks the little girl, ""Naiintindihan mo na ba ako?"" And the child replies, ""Gets ko na,"" feels like a simple, but so profound of an exchange of words. It feels like a hand that's gently soothing a wound she's been carrying all this time. A wound that asked to be seen with the nuances that came with it, not the fantasies the society chooses to blind themselves with.Another thing that stood out to me abt this film is how it challenges the viewers to confront the expectations forced onto women simply for existing. Not with judgement, but with a silence that understands what it means to be human.I just love that this film respects women's choices. It doesn't force a message or a narrative that motherhood is the only path to walk through once it enters in a woman's life. Instead, it says that your life, dreams, and timing are all yours regardless of what everyone thinks nor says abt it.Because to be a mother means to be ready mentally, physically, and financially. Love alone isn't enough to carry a life, just a majority of its suffering.",2025-12-02,positive,0.9917671084403992,-1

Sunshine,"I loved it to bits. The Philippines has always been against abortions due to its religious nature, so I love that this is the kind of film that will spark conversations about the said controversial yet necessary topic. I for one can never fully give my stance since I am religious but also because I am not a woman. I've always believed that the woman is the one that should decide on what to do with an unwanted pregnancy. So, to see pros and cons of wanting to abort a child as well as choosing to go through abortion was quite engaging and I understand things more now. To see the horrors of using illegal ways of abortion was eye-opening, in all honesty. The film did a fantastic job of showcasing these issues, as the message was loud, clear and perfect. I'd say that my only issue with this film is that I wish the story was more fleshed out in a way. Also, it was blatantly obvious that the mysterious (and annoying, mind you) little girl was Sunshine's supposed daughter.

Sunshine,"First Letterboxd essay — I had an itch to scratch so bad with this one. Also medyo late, crammer kasi year-end na :) Right off the bat, I knew how reviews of this film would look like. At hindi naman nagkamali. This film is highly praised, receiving remarks such as masterpiece, brave, and a stepping stone.Yet to my surprise, a few share the same sentiments I had, thoughts that were brewing in me while watching Sunshine. Kaya rin ang hirap buuin ng review na ito (bukod sa hindi naman talaga ako nag-eessay sa plataporma na ito), kasi ayoko maging echo lamang.Anyways, just for the sake of sharing kahit onti:(1) I agree that the supposed personified child is, safe to say, contradictory. Kahit may explanation si Direk Jadaone, it still felt conflicting and made the film unsure of itself.(2) The introduction of some characters felt out of place. In some aspect parang chess yan, character placement and arcs matter, so the player must be aware of their moves.(3) The slap in the face commentary on religion felt overdone. Sayang ang parts and points na pwede pang mahimay.Oh diba, dami niyang sinasabi. But in all honesty, I really felt the need to essay the hell out of this review. Mahalaga sa akin ang usapang SRH at syempre mahalaga rin sa akin na maging diskurso ito.And dahil diyan, here’s a point I feel no one else has raised. Personally, it felt like under-researched ang pelikula. Bakit? Mababaw pa ang na-capture nitong realidad ng abortion at ang hirap na nadadanas ng kababaihan sa kalusugan. These are things you would know agad with one simple search on Reddit. Gets ba? (Lol) And to think na mas layered and complex pa dapat ito sa sitwasyon ni Sunshine, as a student-athlete with financial instability. Sayang lang, ano? Syempre may good points din ang Sunshine sa pananaw ko. Visually, it did its thing. Acting, no doubt, great talents, especially Maris and Jennica. The fact that I watched this with my parents and that they were genuinely interested and concerned about the film is a good point.Sa dulo naman, baka expectations ko rin ang rason kaya ko ito naisip. From here on, sana hindi laging hanggang unang bato lang. Here’s to hoping na makahakbang at makausad na tayo.",2025-12-01,positive,0.8360112309455872,8
Sunshine,"i feel like i could have empathized with her more if the film showed how her imaginary child gradually understands sunshine from her own perspective like how? How would she even know? lol aside from that, we could’ve explored more of why this sport is so important to her instead of adding a subplot (that 13 yr old girl case) that makes her situation feel less serious.her feelings and reasons are all valid but that subplot makes her look careless and kinda dumb lol so it’s hard to root for her tbh also, her imaginary child looks cute, healthy, and fun to talk with... why would she think of aborting her if that’s what her imaginary child is going to look like growing up?????? the imaginary child should reflect the life she can’t give or the pressure she feels or at least something burdensome that is so much worse, not some fantasy lolz. gets na niya, hinayaan niya, tinaggap nalang niya ang fate niya kahit imaginary siya.",2025-12-02,positive,0.8973295092582703,1
Sunshine,"I’ll be honest, underwhelming siya for me. Siguro tumaas lang expectations ko dahil sa dami ng reviews na nakita ko sa social media (na hindi ko binasa para iwas spoiler) at syempre dahil sa haba ng theatrical run niya. What I genuinely liked were the performances. They hired competent actors, and it shows. And since marami na rin akong napanood na Jadaone films, andun pa rin ’yun trademark angst niya—and I love that for her.Ang hindi ko kinaya ay ’yun imaginary children. Siguro kasi sobrang dami ko nang nakitang ganitong atake sa short films at full-length lalo na kapag tungkol sa abortion kaya hindi na bago sa paningin ko. I get kung bakit siya ginamit as a plot device to feel “innovative,” especially with a message that wants to tell the masses na okay lang piliin ang sarili at magpa-abort. Importanteng mensahe ’yun.Kaso… hindi ako nadala emotionally. May mga babae akong kakilala na nagpa-abort at grabe ’yun pinagdaanan nila. Compared sa mga kwentong narinig ko, ang nipis lang ng emotional experience ni Sunshine sa film. Kaya siguro nainis ako sa imaginary children na atake. The feeling itself of learning you're pregnant tapos mag-decide to get an abortion already carries so many complex emotions. Hindi mo na kailangan idikit pa ’yun mga bata to prove a point.Hindi ko rin nagustuhan na parang ang babaw ng pagkakahandle sa kwento nung batang na-rape ng tito niya. Pakiramdam ko ibang pelikula dapat ’yun—isang pelikula na mas malalim at mas handang i-tackle ’yun bigat ng topic.Feeling ko kung lalaki ka, baka mas ""oks"" itong film para sayo. Pero bilang babae… parang kulang pa. Hay. Miss ko ’yun docu days ni Jadaone. Can we bring her back? Charot.",2025-12-02,negative,0.6615150570869446,8
Sunshine,"I’m very grateful at this film’s attempt to keep the narrative always in favor of pro-choice.For a recent narrative on a young woman’s choice about her pregnancy, this film plays a lot of modern elements well. Social media is used several times throughout the start of the film, but none of it is cliché or abhorrent. Each social media is used in a very relatable way, which kind of shocked me but it was a feature of the film I really appreciated. Sunshine’s panic is so realistic and grounding too, the performance is amazing. In terms of tonal shifting, the film does a really great job at keeping it’s theme and message intense and suffocating, much like Sunshine’s need to make a decision. It should ALWAYS be the woman’s choice!!",2025-12-01,positive,0.9954784512519836,1

Annika Co's acting was great, seeing her go from showtime to an actual movie is such a heartwarming sight. i love home but man there is so many things that are outdated, the mention of using ""hilot"" to mend a situation of a pregnant 13 year old girl, women’s health care OR even the fuck ass health care system itself, which is greatly shown, overpopulation, etc, you name it. it's too corrupt, and i feel like ending the film with sunshine on her own way was the best (and only) way to do it.",2025-12-02,positive,0.9925863146781921,-1

Sunshine,"ive been waiting for this to come out on netflix and it is honestly such a GREAT commentary on anti-abortion laws in the philippines and in religious/third world countries as a whole. it truly is a privilege to have the right to our own bodies.the writing of this movie was quite interesting and i believe the children held so much significance to the development and the decision making of the main lead. i believe they are the make-believe consciousness of the “thing” (lets stop calling them babies PLEASE) inside the main lead and the 13yo girl, and i LOVED being so confused and then realising this later on. “drown out the noise” something we need to tell ourselves more often than not. we shouldn’t listen to outside opinions of what to do with ourselves and our own bodies. it is the happiest way to live and love life.i hold this movie very close to my heart and living in a country where abortion is legal is a HUGE privilege and i look forward to the days where religious doctrine dont run the government and put its citizens in a chokehold. religious or not, DON’T tell ANYONE what to do with their bodies, we are all in different circumstances and have wants/dreams/aspirations we’d like to pursue for our own happiness and that’s not selfish.",2025-12-02,positive,0.9965368509292603,9
Sunshine,"my best friend sent a message in the group chat saying “guys please don’t ever get pregnant” fresh after watching this. i laughed in my mind thinking how is that even gonna happen. but here i am sobbing like a child and wishing that nobody ever gets pregnant against their will. what a demented, horrifying, and pathetic world we live in. this film plunged my heart deep into my guts from the very beginning. it’s already hard being a girl and then you have systems in place that form a fist around your throat. this was so well made that none of it looked fake. i mean it’s so funny to see the juxtaposition of the church and the “pamparegla” vendors that are still there today. maybe it’s more sad really but that is the reality. i don’t know i guess it is so hard to explain the horrors of being a woman. men get to conveniently be selfish as part of their nature but putting yourself first as a girl needs an apology from god. men regard laws only when they can deny women any autonomy, but break them with ease for their own disgusting desires and freely laugh about it with their friends. i am so glad this film ended the way it did but i am also very sad and angry that girls who meet the same fate have to suffer maybe even worse than this. and that’s when i know god is not a woman.",2025-12-02,positive,0.8995212912559509,32
Sunshine,"Society claims to protect the “unborn child,” yet the conversation often leaves out the women whose bodies, health, and futures are directly involved. It feels unsettling to watch how easily society dismisses the experiences of women, as if their lives become secondary the moment they become pregnant. I can’t ignore how deeply this connects to the patriarchal norms I’ve grown up seeing. From subtle expectations to outright judgment, there is a long history of controlling women’s bodies and decisions. The shame placed on those who consider or seek abortion is not just personal; it is cultural and religious, embedded in systems that teach us to shame and question women’s choices instead of supporting them. This made us more aware of how easily society turns compassion into condemnation when it comes to reproductive health.P'wede ba pag walang matres, 'wag na bumoses?",2025-12-02,negative,0.5583615899085999,3

Sunshine,"hindi ko alam kung anong mas mabigat habang pinapanood ko Sunshine — yung katahimikan ng mga babaeng walang mapagsabihan, o yung ingay ng mundong ang bilis humusga pero ang bagal tumulong. Jadaone films always stab softly, pero ito? Parang dahan-dahang hinihiwa yung dibdib, layer by layer, para ipakita yung takot, pangarap, at kahihiyang matagal nang nakatago sa ilalim ng “ok lang ako.”this is the kind of film na hindi mo papanoorin para gumaan ang loob mo, papanoorin mo siya para maalala kung gaano kabigat mabuhay bilang babae sa bansang ayaw umamin na may mali sa sistemang sinasamba nito. Sunshine doesn’t preach. it just stands there, raw and trembling, asking the kind of questions we’re trained to avoid:Paano ka pipili kung lahat ng choice mo ay kasalanan sa mata ng iba?Paano ka lalaban kung mismong katawan mo ang pinaparusahan?Maris Racal is devastating in ways na hindi loud pero lumalalim. hindi siya yung tipikal na dramatic heroine — she’s simply a girl suspended between a dream and a reality that keeps shrinking her choices. her silence says more than any monologue could. every frame feels like a confession: hesitant, trembling, pero totoo.and what struck me most wasn’t the gymnastics, or even the central issue of abortion. it was the ache between who we want to become and what our circumstances force us to be. nakakapagod maging babae sa Pilipinas — laging may moral lesson, laging monitored, laging may takot na isang maling galaw lang, tapos na ang lahat. parang ang liit liit ng mundo mo kahit ang laki laki ng pangarap mo.Sunshine doesn’t romanticize any of this. walang sermon, walang cinematic gloss. just a raw, unfiltered look at how dreams bruise under a society na mas mabilis manghusga kaysa umintindi. the film’s imperfections — the loose ends, the uneven metaphors, the sometimes rushed stakes — oddly work in its favor. because real life isn’t clean. hindi linear ang trauma. hindi laging malinaw ang choice. and maybe that’s the point: that we’re all navigating a world built not on empathy, but on fear and control.in the end, Sunshine feels less like a movie and more like a mirror — one that forces you to sit with the darkness until you finally admit na masakit talaga ang liwanag. it’s an eye-opener not because it shocks, but because it whispers truths we’ve mastered the art of ignoring.a film worth watching, not because it entertains, but because it confronts. because it nudges you to look beyond the screen and into the world we built… and ask, Bakit ganito?And more importantly — hanggang kailan?",2025-11-29,positive,0.6803125739097595,-1

One of which is the inaccessibility to women-friendly environments, may it be in your household, in public, at the hospital, at school. And when I say women-friendly, it's the support for the emotional and mental consequences, and physical choices for oneself. We suffer consequences that are beyond our own control but when we decide how to deal with it, our surroundings tend to vilify us for our choices. But Sunshine shows us that we are in charge of our own choices however we like it. We know our bodies, our dreams, our capacities the best.

Sunshine,"abortion is a topic i usually avoid because it’s morally, socially, and emotionally heavy. what i loved about this film is how it didn’t shy away from that weight, showing how complicated it really is especially in a conservative, Catholic society like ours where abortion is still illegal and pregnant teens are often judged and shamed. i liked how they showed that harsh reality here. and i also really liked Maris Racal’s performance, i think she brought so much depth and vulnerability to her role.i’m a Christian, so of course i have my own beliefs. but honestly, i don’t think life is always black and white. i do believe every woman should have a say over her own body. we shouldn't force someone into a choice they aren't ready for. if she isn't ready to be a mother, she may not be able to provide the care a child deserves. sometimes, the bravest and kindest choice a woman can make is the one who chooses the best for herself, who considers her life and circumstances. at the end of the day, it's not our body, not our life, not our consequences so we shouldn't judge. we're called to love, to show mercy, and to respect the dignity and choice of others. after all... autonomy is a lifeline.",2025-12-02,positive,0.9929967522621155,-1

Sunshine,"""A woman’s body is not a vessel only to bend for a man’s morals nor a canvas for a man’s shame.""Imagine a young woman who is chasing her dreams, but being struck down by laws made by patriarchal society which restricts and shames her for taking decisions for her own body. We failed our women! Antoinette jadaone’s SUNSHINE is powerful , poignant, beautiful, and yet heartbreaking which showcases the crisis of young age pregnancy, the taboo and the shame comes with it, hypocrisy of society and being resilient and standing up for yourself and for your dreams over anyone. It’s not a fairytale, but a hard hitting truth. There is no ending to this cycle of shame for women who are bred in this macho-feudal society, how religion and social taboos remain a bottleneck than a savior. But the movie overcomes those things so bravely and leads a courageous path to tell women to take their rights in their own hands. I really loved the idea of her imaginative child being with her all the time, giving her strength, and emotional support and that final moment between those two is tear jerking. What most people think it was a sad ending, but actually it was not, it was an inspiring ending which reaffirms that every woman should have the right to make a decision for herself. Abortion is actually less cruel than bringing a baby in this hell hole and making its life shitty, when its parents are not capable of taking care of it mentally, physically, financially and emotionally. You are not only ruining one life, but multiple lives.2025 Movies Ranked",2025-12-01,positive,0.9834758043289185,3

Sunshine,"Nakakalungkot lang. Basta. It brought me back to the Fangirl days when it gave me the chills about how being a delulu can bring you to your worst disappointments. But this time, Sunshine hits different. When you realize what she did to achieve her dreams, you'd be flabbergasted. It's giving The Unforgivable dilemma. Biktima lang din talaga si Sunshine ng circumstances.Sunshine is just one of the many girls in the society who still get solely blamed for the acts that should also be blamed on the boys. This movie is not just your typical feminist film; it speaks of depth, especially on the challenges of women and the dilemma they face. Isa pa sa nagustuhan ko sa film na to is yung pinadama niya yung hopelessness ni Sunshine. Di naman sa ayaw ko ng movies na binibigyan ng pag-asa ang main character sa huli, pero this served something different and it worked. It's when she was forced to choose between two things, and ended up choosing what's best for her, even if it meant—basta. May empathy ka pa din kay Sunshine kahit labag sa iyong kalooban ang kanyang gagawin (as a Filipino Catholic).Sobrang ironic lang din ng title, which I admire.

Sunshine,"this film is a deeply realistic exploration of what it means to be a woman in the philippines—a country where patriarchy, tradition, religion, and economic pressure converge in ways that make womanhood both exhausting and precarious. Importantly, the film is not a pro-life statement, nor does it romanticize suffering or prescribe motherhood as a moral imperative. instead, it shows that the choices women face are complex, constrained, and often invisible to those who hold power.it also addresses the ways women navigate survival under these pressures. it shows that women are often responsible for both care work and emotional labor without recognition or support. the everyday reality of harassment, unsafe streets, economic vulnerability, and social judgment creates conditions in which reproductive choice becomes a deeply personal but politically fraught decision. the film does not moralize these choices; it presents them with nuance, empathy, and a refusal to simplify the stakes into a pro-life narrative.at higit sa lahat, thank you, sunshine, sa pagpukpok ng bote sa tito.",2025-12-01,positive,0.9806509613990784,9

Sunshine,"This is a blistering, gut-punching film that doesn’t just ask difficult questions about bodily autonomy and Olympic dreams; it screams them into the humid, chaotic reality of Manila. It’s a brave, essential piece of cinema that confronts the devastating consequences of living in a country where a woman’s control over her own body is perpetually under threat. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and utterly visceral—it’s relentless, trapping us inside Sunshine’s suffocating anxiety. Jadaone uses the oppressive visual texture of Quiapo’s crowded, sweltering streets—a perfect, gritty backdrop—to symbolize the labyrinthine journey of a young woman navigating impossible choices in a system designed to fail her.A massive and well-deserved standing ovation goes to the central performances. Maris Racal is devastating as the titular gymnast, embodying the crushing physical and emotional burden with every strained muscle and every desperate, silent plea. Her performance is a masterclass in controlled despair, capturing the agony of a lifetime of sacrifice being threatened in an instant. She is perfectly complemented by Annika Co’s mesmerizing, eerie, and unrelenting presence as the Kid—an unsettling narrative device that functions as both Sunshine’s internal critic and her desperate conscience. But let’s be real: the film’s rawest emotional hook comes from the shocking failure and apathy of the men around her. Their irresponsibility and sheer lack of accountability form a central, infuriating symbol of the patriarchal society that traps Sunshine.Ang hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas. Every day feels like a battle against a society na paulit-ulit kang nilalagay sa kahon, insisting that your worth begins and ends with motherhood. Fuck the stigma na finoforce ang mga kababaihan into roles they never agreed to—parang automatic default na lang na dapat tahimik, dapat magtiis, dapat magpakamartir. Walang puwang para sa sariling pangarap, sariling katawan, sariling desisyon.Kaya sana mas umingay at mas mapag-usapan ang Reproductive Rights—hindi lang as a “women’s issue” but as a basic human right. This is about giving women the freedom to choose, the safety to seek care without judgment, and the dignity to exist without being shamed or controlled. Hanggang hindi natin tinatalakay nang seryoso ang mga ito, paulit-ulit lang tayo sa cycle ng stigma, trauma, at kawalan ng choices.Being a woman here shouldn't feel like a punishment. It shouldn't demand silence in exchange for survival. And yet, dito sa Pilipinas, ganun pa rin ang realidad—and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.Putangina, Miggy/Miguel na naman!",2025-12-01,positive,0.902533233165741,-1

Sunshine,"DIREK TONET! YOU DID IT AGAIN!first of all, this should be more relevant than it is. being pro choice and growing up somehow religious, I know what other people think of abortion. especially yung mga sagradong katoliko. and that scene where sunshine went to church and immediately begged for forgiveness showcased EXACTLY THAT. (religious guilt!!!) it perfectly captures how the film isn’t just telling a story, but also reflecting a very real internal conflict na ang daming pinoy women who quietly deals with—yung clash between what you personally believe is right for your body and what your religion tells you is a sin. ang bigat pakinggan at panoorin.""buntis lang ako, 'di to nakakahawa""kahit sa kapwa babae natin di mapipigilan yung judgement eh. kasi ganun yung pagpapalaki satin which is honestly fucked up. and that line hits SO hard because it’s a commentary on how society treats pregnancy like a moral failure instead of a situation that needs support, empathy, and actual options. the film shows how even other women, who should’ve been supporting you, end up policing each other because yun yung environment na kinalakihan natin. tangina diba?!!?also the irony of buying abortion pills at a church and you can't get a room at a motel ALONE?? the system makes it impossible for women to make decisions about their own bodies, pero at the same time they judge you for every workaround you try to do. also for young girls who get raped and still, THEY have to deal with the consequences. it exposes how the philippines forces women into shame, secrecy, and inconvenience—and then they act shocked when women feel unsafe or unsupported. it’s painfully real, and so, so on point.overall, i love this movie because it's honest in a way that most local films are too scared to be. some women don't have a choice, and it's important that WE DO HAVE A CHOICE.

It’s not the woman’s fault if she chooses to get an abortion—her body, her choice.And to the men: can you all just be responsible? Some of you have the audacity to leave after getting what you want, acting like you have no responsibilities.Hindi masama ang abortion.

Sunshine,"What stayed with me long after the credits rolled is how Sunshine understands the quiet corners of being young. The ones filled with fear you don’t even have language for yet, and the hope you still hold anyway. The film doesn’t chase shock value; instead, it trusts stillness, letting the soft ache of its characters speak for themselves.And then there’s that storyline about the 13-year-old girl, pregnant because of her own uncle. OH GOD. That shattered me. It’s horrifying, devastating, and the film doesn’t sanitize the truth of it. It shows how violence like that hides inside families, how children are left carrying consequences for sins that were never theirs. I felt so much grief and anger for that kid; it’s the kind of scene that makes you sit there and go quiet because it hurts in a very real way. The film’s exploration of choice, shame, and the pressure to “grow up correctly” hits even harder because of moments like that. It never lectures. It simply shows how heavy it is to carry circumstances shaped by adults who should’ve protected you. Maris Racal delivers an immaculate kind of devastation in this role. There’s a sharpness to every look she gives, a trembling truth in every word, that feels painfully real. She breaks open the character’s longing, lets the fear spill out raw, and turns her strength into something that rises slowly from the wreckage. It’s a performance that destroys you and stays spotless in its honesty.Sunshine is the kind of film that lingers. Soft, bruising, furious when it needs to be, and quietly bright in all the places that matter.",2025-12-01,positive,0.9223154187202454,1

Sunshine,"Sunshine (2024) serves as a powerful and eye-opening film, especially for us Filipinos. As someone working in the healthcare field, I believe the movie highlights an important truth: abortion should not be treated as a taboo subject or inherently immoral. Whether we acknowledge it or not, there are women who do not wish to become pregnant or are not ready to become mothers. Criminalizing abortion does not stop it from happening; it merely drives women toward unsafe procedures that place their lives at greater risk.If one personally identifies as pro-life, then one has the choice not to pursue abortion. However, holding that belief does not grant anyone the authority to dictate or restrict what women can do with their own bodies, especially when they do not contribute to the wellbeing of the child these women may be forced to bear. The health, autonomy, and safety of women must remain our priority. It is time to end the stigma surrounding reproductive choices and to uphold the separation of religion and state in policymaking.",2025-12-01,positive,0.9826232194900513,1

Sunshine,"Ang pelikulang Sunshine ay hindi lang simpleng kwento ng isang babae—isa itong salamin sa maraming isyung matagal nang umiikot sa Pilipinas pero pilit pa ring isinasantabi. Nagawa ng pelikula ito na ilahad ang mga sakit ng sistemang kinabibilangan natin: mula sa pakikibaka ng kababaihan sa kanilang sariling katawan hanggang sa nakakalungkot na estado ng ating healthcare system.Isa sa pinakamalinaw na ipinupukol ng pelikula ay ang isyu ng aborsyon. Ipinapakita ng pelikula kung gaano kahirap ang desisyong hinaharap ng mga kababaihan—lalo na sa bansang halos bawal pag-usapan ang reproductive rights. Nakakahalit dahil hanggang ngayon, marami pa ring kababaihan ang hindi ganap na malaya sa sarili nilang katawan dahil sa malalim na kapit ng konserbatismong relihiyoso. Sa halip na suportahan, hinuhusgahan sila. Sa halip na pakinggan, pinapatahimik. At gaya ng ipinapakita sa pelikula, napipilitang harapin ng mga babae ang mga sitwasyong hindi nila pinili, wala man lang ligtas o legal na option para makaligtas..Kasunod nito, mariing binabangga ng pelikula ang realidad ng ating healthcare system. Hindi na bago ang nakikitang eksena sa ospital: siksikan, kulang sa gamit, at kapos sa espasyo. Dalawa, minsan tatlong ina sa iisang kama—hindi dahil gusto nila, kundi dahil wala talagang mapaglagyan. Ito ang reyalidad na hinaharap ng ordinaryong Pilipino araw-araw, habang ang mga pulitikong may kapangyarihan ay kayang lumipad paabroad para magpagamot sa mas kumpletong pasilidad.Sa kabuuan, nagsilbing boses ang Sunshine para sa mga isyung matagal nang dinidinig ngunit hindi pinakikinggan.

Sunshine,"This movie was fun to watch in terms of its setting. I have been to the gym Sunshine was training in and also the Rizal Sports Complex because I have trained there before in 2015!Argh, teenage pregnancy in the Philippines stems from the lack of sex education and advocacy for contraceptives and abortion. The fact that we are a mostly Catholic-dominated country or population that strongly adheres to tradition makes it harder for pregnant teenagers to find support. They are made to feel ashamed and helpless because even the law says that abortion is illegal, meaning that they do not have a choice but to deliver the child. Sunshine's passion was found in gymnastics, something that she couldn't let go of. She knew that if she were to become a mother (which she isn't ready for, as she explicitly states during her conversation with Miguel and his father), she would have to surrender everything she has worked hard for. Her sister's situatio, who was a former gymnast as well, basically shows that Sunshine's life would eventually become just like hers if she were to proceed with the pregnancy. The doctor was so annoying because that's exactly how the older generation sounds like when stating their opinions about religion, abortion, and chilbirth.I also liked the fact that they tackled topics like sex, autonomy, rape, and incest. These are very real in the Philippines and the situation with Ariana and his sister (?) greatly displayed how messed up it is. These children have no choice or power over their elders and what makes it sad is that those who should be protecting them are the ones putting them in danger and ruining their lives.I read somewhere that the little girl that followed Sunshine was her unborn child. I also thought of this throughout the movie and it even made more sense when the little girl said ""Gets ko na"" after Sunshine practiced her piece with a passionate smile and aura that could be felt by the audience.I love that Sunshine chose herself and her dreams over being a mother. A child born into this world who would eventually live in substandard conditions just because people say they should be born won't truly experience a life that should be lived.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9903616905212402,9

Also, I appreciate how this movie shows na accessing safe abortion care from clinics is far better than relying on herbal remedies or sa mga faithhealers. And of course, this also shows the effects of our flawed healthcare system, it's inaccessible and expensive, pushing women to resort to those kinds of practices.

Sunshine,"Ganda. A harrowing, claustrophobic, yet essential sprint across Manila streets. The craft here really shines, at just 90 or so minutes the film feels tightly-paced and confidently crafted through Jadaone's masterful direction, yet it still swings wide over several discussions and thoughts over its major theme in an arguably short amount of time. Mind you there's an element here that I'm not the biggest fan of-- I think the film could have actually eliminated it altogether as it feels inelegant especially against the overt realism of the rest of the film. But otherwise it's easy to overlook this compared to how wise the rest of the film is. It culminates in a truly lovely finale that uses simplicity to great, moving effect, especially when juxtaposed to how much noise and haste the rest of the film's heavy atmosphere is. Gets ko na why ""Gets ko na"" became an easily recognisable, even arguably iconic line from this film.Besides the stellar direction, the rest of the departments here really shine. The camera and production design really stand out here, painting a crowded and cramped world. The performances are simply captivating. Maris Racal truly carries this hefty narrative, but Annika Co really exudes such natural confidence that steals the scene whenever she appears. Ultimately, this really feels like important cinema from simply one of the best Filipino filmmakers out there.",2025-12-01,positive,0.9951417446136475,-1
Sunshine,"Sobrang tapang ng pelikulang 'to. Sobrang tapang ni direk tonet. Sobrang tapang ni Sunshine. Sobrang tapang ng mga kababaihang nagpapatuloy, lumalaban sa mga hamon ng lipunan. Dinala ako ng pelikulang 'to sa kung anong klaseng lipunan ang kailangang harapin ng mga kababaihan araw-araw — lahat ng husga, dikta, at pangungurakot. Wala sa kahit anong batas or salita ng diyos ang makatutulong sa mga taong kagaya ni Sunshine, kung 'di ang maayos na health care system, maayos at tapat na gobyerno, at isang mapagpalayang lipunan — malaya sa kahit anong dikta at husga ng mga taong hindi kailanma'y namroblema sa kanilang kaligtasan kapag maglalakad mag-isa sa madilim na kalsada, sa kanilang kasuotan at pananamit, sa kung anong pananaw ng iba sa kanilang katawan, sa kakayahan makapag-luwal ng anak, sa mga tingin at pagnanasa ng mga mabababang-uri, at sa mga marami pang bagay. Napakaraming aspeto ng pelikulang Sunshine ang paulit-ulit sinasampal sa atin para lang magising sa realidad ang bulok na lipunang 'to. Isa na rito ang pagbibigay sa mga kababaihan ang kalayaang mamili, kalayaang magdesisyon, at kalayaang mangarap, kasama ang proteksyon para sa mga batang katulad ni Mary Grace.Ilang kababaihan at bata pa ba ang kinakailangang maranasan ang hirap nina Sunshine at Mary Grace bago mamulat at umusad ang lipunang sakop pa rin ng makalumang pananaw — mga pananaw na hindi nila alam ay unti-unting ginigilitan at pinapatay ang karapatan, kalayaan, at kakayahan ng mga kababaihan. Ang mga taong tulad nina Bobot, nanay ni Mary Grace, at Miggy ang tunay na lumalabag sa sa utos ng diyos, ang tunay na gumagawa ng krimen, at ang tunay sa nagpapabulok pa sa inuuod na sistema para sa mga kababaihan at bata, hindi ang mga taong tulad ni Sunshine na pinanghahawakan ang karapatan nilang mangarap at magkaroon ng desisyon para sa kanilang sariling katawan. Tangina gaano ba kahirap isipin yon?Napakaganda ng cinematography.

Sunshine,"This film really reminded me that sometimes even the most seemingly trivial decisions—like whether to use a condom or not by relying on the excuse of pulling out—can have huge effects on one’s life. It also shows how having no access to proper medical care for abortion (since it is illegal) is so unfair, especially for children who were taken advantage of, which leads them to use unsafe methods that put their lives at risk. I really applaud Sunshine’s determination to chase her dreams and stay strong in the face of her friends ignoring her and her boyfriend not wanting to take responsibility for their child. Aside from her, I also applaud her family for staying by her side regardless of what her decision may be. I applaud this film for showing the hardships of being a woman—specifically, a woman in the Philippines—surrounded by noise, distractions, and judgment.",2025-12-01,positive,0.9922065138816833,1

Sunshine,"""Naiintindihan mo na?""""Gets ko na.""Whenever somebody asks me why I support abortion, I will ask them to watch this film—especially now that it is widely accessible through Netflix. The ability to choose for a woman's own welfare and decide for the future of a child is a fundamental right, it should never be a debate. Bodily autonomy is a human right. We can use religious morals as a basis to weigh the decision but NEVER force it on somebody and leverage that same bullshit to guilt-trip them. Safe-sex should be promoted not shushed by religious parties; accessible care for abortion should be a must We shouldn't demonize doctors and women who want that for themselves. Like the line, ""Flush out the noise"", these unneeded external noises should never be heard in the first place, all throughout the film it catches up to Sunshine. Hangang, hanga, ako sa'yo Sunshine. Dreams should never be impeded because of a mistake, she's still a teen who's transitioning to adulthood. She should be allowed to live her life not being worried about a child she never wanted in the first place. And to all the women out there, who's met with arguably stronger hostility, I hope that laws, people, the Philippines becomes more friendly to you. It should be like that. I never doubted Maris Racal's ability to act, and all I can say is they found jackpot by casting her as Sunshine and casting Annika as the little girl that appears all throughout the film.

Sunshine,"“usapang bata to!””bakit? bata rin naman ako!”a striking detail that struck me the most is the contrast between the very first time we watch sunshine step onto the mat and the last time she ever does. at first, you hear this deep and intense noise of her drowning the music, her choach’s instructions, and even the sound of her own breathing. and the noise only goes louder and harsher each time we see her practice her routine while she quietly endures the devastating ordeal of attempting to terminate her pregnancy. what started off as a sound to describe her pressure and desperation to reach her olympic dreams, now becomes the sound of her fear, her secrecy, and her grief. this says so much about what it means to be a woman in the philippines: how suffering must be hidden, how autonomy becomes something to apologize for, and how you’re expected to quietly tend to your own wounds you never asked to carry.and sunshine carries her decision with guilt, so much that she looks at the unnamed young girl like she’s staring at every version of her future that never got the chance to choose. but she dreams. she dreams so much. and she dreams for more. and she stands firm, because what’s so wrong about wanting a life that belongs to her? what’s so wrong about refusing to be swallowed by sacrifice? what’s so wrong about refusing to become another woman she didn’t want to be?“gets ko na.”so as we see the last time she practices on the mat, we finally hear the sound of the music, not the deep sound of pressure of fear, but a rhythm that finally belongs to her. the gymnasium is dark, she’s alone and she’s pale, but this is the brightest she has ever looked in the past hour i’ve watched the film. she moves with a softness that feels earnest, like this is the first time her body isn’t performing to impress or survive, only to exist. she dances gracefully, probably the most she ever has, and it’s a moment that shows us that she has unapologetically reclaimed something no one ever thought she deserved: the right to choose herself. and for the first time, she is no longer a girl she’s afraid to be—she is a woman who has already decided.i hope more people watch sunshine (2024) not to criticize women with early and unintended pregnancies, but to meet them with grace and empathy for their fears, their confusion, and their fight to claim what should have always been theirs in the first place—their autonomy, dignity, and right to have access to healthcare without being made to beg for it.patuloy nating pahalagahan ang kalusugan, karapatan, at mga kwento ng kababaihan minus half star kasi parang kaya pa natin i-improve yung dialogues, direk??

Sunshine,"Philippine cinema is not dead and Sunshine is a living proof of it. this film has so much emotional depth and thought-provoking scenes that captures perfectly what it feels like to be a woman living in a patriarchal society- in a country where hypocrisy runs rampant and making decisions for yourself is often frowned upon. why is it that women are the ones always blamed, shackled and punished for choices they make- choices driven by the need to prioritize their health and safety in situations they did not fully create? Antoinette Jadaone's best film yet so far, and i'd say it because of its boldness, for addressing an elephant, a taboo topic that most of us are not ready to talk about, but eventually we must. it's already hard enough that we don't have proper access to healthcare, even worse to be scrutinized by society simply for choosing yourself.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9929128289222717,1

Sunshine,"”Ay nako! Talaga naman ang mga kabataan ngayon hindi na makapagpigil.”Throughout Sunshine, there are several adult figures that do not listen to Sunshine, blinded by either their convictions or Filipino societal norms. They push Sunshine on what she must do: pray, seek forgiveness, give the baby a life, be a mom, and pray. In the adults’ eyes, Sunshine is not a nineteen-year-old Filipina in Manila going to school and practice. To the adults, Sunshine is already a mom.On Saturday, the Filipino noontime show It’s Showtime invited parents with 7 or more children for their game Laro, Laro, Pick. A majority of the contestants were women, and two of the mothers interviewed, Elsa and Rosalie, had 15 and 8 children respectively. Elsa, the 63-year-old woman with 12 living children and 3 deceased children recited the ages of her 12 children from the oldest, 46, to the youngest, 24. The gap between the older ones is 1-2 years apart, while the younger ones are about 2-3 years apart. Elsa confesses how difficult life is for her and her children, spouting how without God she would not be as strong as she is today, living off 300 pesos everyday. When Vice Ganda asked Elsa why she has so many children, Elsa plainly said, “Ehhh di ako marunong mag family planning eh,” inciting some laughter in the audience. Elsa even revealed that the father was absent and had a different family, leaving the Filipina mother and her 12 living children to figure out how to live.The second woman, Rosalie, with 8 children echoed the same sentiments as Elsa. She sells sampaguita every day with no days off at the age of 60 something; her children married and had their children early; the highest level of schooling one of her children attained was high school, but never graduated; her children sell sampaguita with no days off; and she has 19 grandchildren to look after in a home with no roof above their heads.What Sunshine, Elsa, and Rosalie have in common is how the patriarchy confines them to suffocating religious ideals, a corrupt and conservative government, and poor healthcare. What Sunshine does not have in common with the two women is the ignorance in family planning. Sunshine is no one's mother! It should never be a reason to have 7 or more children at an early age, with no means of support financially and emotionally, because it is ""God's gift,"" or because they simply want to experience having children. The favorite catchphrase, ""Kase malakas ako, kaya ko to"" can only thrive for so long with honesty until oppressors abuse the Filipina determination. Access to sexual education MUST be a right, not a privilege nor a taboo subject. Children do not decide when they want to be born, so there should be conscious efforts to assess if the environment people live in can secure their children's/childrens' future(s), especially in a country like the Philippines. Unfortunately, there are connections to poverty and the lack of interest and access to proper education. There is also the inability for Filipinos in poverty to seek other options, or have the real agency to pursue aspirations. While there is such thing as being irresponsible, Filipino women are a laughingstock in conversations surrounding teen pregnancy and reproductive rights—when realistically—they should have the choice to protect themselves, but are instead ruthlessly flayed off by the very system that commands kindness.[Minor spoilers ahead]Annika Co manifests herself as (what I think) Sunshine's Catholic guilt. We first meet Annika after Sunshine prays outside of Quiapo Church and is about to light a cigarette. Annika appears whenever Sunshine does something that will affect the fetus, and often berates Sunshine for being ""bad."" At first, I was hesitant towards the idea of Annika representing Sunshine's potential child, because it can mistakenly support the pro-life argument of murder (which Annika actually yells at Sunshine), until Annika says, ""ang pangarap ko ay pangarap niya."" SOBRANG bigat yung line na yan! In a sense, Sunshine and Annika are the same person. Sunshine should be able to pursue her dreams successfully the same way Annika, along with other living and future children, should feel secure enough to be ambitious. The message further builds itself with Ariana, Annika's friend and the 13-year-old girl's potential child. Ariana wants to be the first gay president, but how can they do that in an environment with a r*pist, a neglectful grandmother, and a KID whose choice was stolen?If mothers like Elsa and Rosalie can somehow ""get away"" with no family planning, how can Sunshine and the 13-year-old girl survive in a Catholic Philippines? The Reproductive Health Law was passed in December 2012, and efforts to educate the masses and distribute contraceptives have improved, yet there is still a high percentage of unintended pregnancies, AIDS rates, and JUSKO PO—ISSUES WITH BUDGETING (source 1),(source 2) !!!!!! The Philippines will never progress as a nation if objectivity is blocked by the grip the church and the state have on one another, which ultimately and consistently harms Filipinas who give their best yesterday, today, and tomorrow.I am certain that Sunshine is not the first film to be unapologetically bold and loud for the Filipina, but it is certainly the first to make rounds among the casual movie-goers and the general Filipino. It is not a perfect film and such flawed instances are where:- the narrative of Sunshine being an Olympic-level athlete clashes with the lack of popularity shown outside of practice- the cinematography is poetic without a doubt, but the scenes of Sunshine messaging her Coach, Miggy, and Thea isn't synchronized with Sunshine typing on the phone/isn't even her actually texting. If you're going to place emphasis on the quietest scenes, I believe that something as minor as texting should be clean (this was the same quip I had with the controller scene in Anora like c'mon now....)- the cinematography can be too poetic. for example, the shot of Sunshine looking out of her hotel window with the Metro Manila noise juxtaposing her quiet turmoil contributes to Sunshine purposely not drowning out the noise (or the failure to?), but I found it unnecessary because right after she woke up in pain. the juxtaposition felt like it was purely for aesthetics- the Jojo Rabbit esque character of Annika and Ariana was VERY risky (re: pro-life arguments)- maybe it's just me but the film gives you some breathers with comedic aspects in things like ""no bad words"" and Annika proceeding to say ""putangina"" which I found myself like ""damn girl ! ! !"" though it makes me wonder if those who do not share the same ideals as me laughed at it the same way the audience laughed at Elsa in Laro Laro Pick. In a not long-winding way, and assuming negatively, if tonal shifts struck the audience as a serious matter and not a reactionary narrative.- the last 3 paragraphs of this review regarding how art can effectively stand by its purposeAng hirap maging isang Sunshine sa Pilipinas, at hindi pinaguusapan kahit eto ang reality ng karamihan ng babae at batang babae. Women can dream for themselves. Women can learn to protect for themselves if there are resources available by sources that make themselves available. Women are strong, but you cannot glorify them to always be strong at the expense of exploitation. Sunshine is many of the first steps in Philippine cinema that can continue the conversation. I hope the film incites action in Filipinos to call out the current and future administration, who, under the guise of a devotee to a forgiving religion, perpetuates being uncritical and whose laziness is a disservice to the Filipino people. And most importantly, may Filipinos denounce the administration's vigor in committing violence against them, and reclaim the autonomy all Filipinos are born with.",2025-11-30,positive,0.5794910192489624,12

Sunshine,"I know this movie feels heavy and complicated the first time you watch it. It’s about a girl who is struggling against the world and against herself. She loses her way, and she could lose her dreams if she doesn’t stand up to the world.From this movie, I learned one important thing in life, everyone has their own problems, different kinds of problems. But the important thing is what you choose to do when you’re going through something difficult and nobody is there to help you. Even when you feel alone, useless, or hopeless, don’t give up. You can still reach what you want and chase your dreams. Just keep going and keep fighting.As a man, I feel sorry for Sunshine, but believe me, there are many good men in this world better than selfish and stupid men and I learned from this movie how to be a better man. Use protection when you’re doing something intimate, and if you don’t, make sure you can take responsibility for your actions. Live wisely and don’t make rushed decisions. Every choice you make shapes your future. We may not regret our actions in the moment, but we regret them later.And for other men, I want to say this if you have a girlfriend, make sure she’s happy with you. Don’t be rude to her, and don’t ruin her life because of your desires. As a man, I promise myself that I'll be better. I’ll treat women with respect, and I'll never raise my hand when we have problems or arguments.",2025-12-01,positive,0.9521209001541138,-1

She's such a strong female character and I love the subtlety in which they showed it in the movie. nanay siya pero never niya pinafeel sa kapatid niya na dapat i-keep ni Sunshine yung bata dahil lang siya kineep niya yung kanya. pinakita rin na kadalasan talaga kapwa babae ang tutulong sayo, sad reality kahit na dapat may katuwang ka in the form of a partner (the one who knocked you up in the first place), it's always women helping other women- even in situations where they themselves don't have much (the maternity ward scene, just a whole community of mothers caring for each other) and even when they have issues of their own (Sunshine helping out the younger girl that was also pregnant all while dealing with her own pregnancy) the 13 year old girl who was revealed to have been GAY and a victim of her uncle's story was very impactful. nakakalungkot na yun ang realidad ng karamihan sa mga batang babae sa bansa. abuse is so normalized and looked over, especially in marginalized areas. that's why we need more Dra Helenas in the world.

And the cinematography is a solid 10 out of 10.this movie shows how cruel the system is for women in general. with a patriarchal society and a conservative country, talagang “jackpot” maging babae. it also highlights how badly we need proper sex education and why decriminalizing abortion should be pushed hard!gigil ako dun sa hayop na bobot, yung unang doctora na super pabida, at siyempre special mention kay miggy at sa pastor niyang tatay.overall, this movie hit me in a way na kahit hindi ako in sunshine’s situation, ramdam ko pa rin. as a woman, it just made me realize again how much we deal with. it’s not just a good movie it’s the type na kahit okay ka naman, pero pag may sad song, bigla kang nagrereflect. that’s exactly the energy it gave me. kudos to the director, and of course maris, who always gives justice to every character.",2025-12-01,positive,0.997509241104126,-1

The way the film shows her struggle, the shame, the fear, the judgment, the dreams she’s forced to postpone, feels like a mirror held up to countless Filipina girls who had to grow up too fast. You can feel how her choices are never just hers; they’re tied to religion, family, and the weight of “dapat” at “bawal.”But what makes Sunshine beautiful is how it refuses to punish her for wanting more. For wanting herself.When she finally chooses her dreams, finally chooses herself and it doesn’t feel selfish. It feels like survival. Like finally stepping out of a shadow she never asked to stand under.This is a reminder that a woman’s future shouldn’t be treated like a sin.And that the sun doesn’t ask permission to shine… it just does.The best Filipino Film of 2025.",2025-12-01,positive,0.9825522899627686,24

Yes un ung naging tradition natin pero just bcs it's tradition doesn't mean it's right. Naiinis lang ako bakit hnd nila maunawaan? Ok cge religious ka pero wla kbng empathy and understanding? Eh un nga ang dapat meron ka. Just because sabi sa bible or whatever eh ang tanong TAMA ba tlg? wag nyo ibase lahat s religion sna gmitin nyo isip at puso nyo kht maunwaan nyo man lang. I have no religious beliefs ah pero kung totoo nga ang snasabi nyo tungkol kay god hnd ba maiintindihan nya? Pls manahimik sa mga moral kineme eh sa tingin nyo b moral na hayaan silang magdusa at ipilit ung hnd nmn tlg nila gusto? Let's be HUMAN please.

Sunshine,"Ayokong maging nanay! Ano bang pakielam nyo?!Followed by her Ate's support is what every young woman's response to people trying to dictate what to do with her body. not when she's not ready, not whenever. In this world, we need an ate like her, Dok Helena, and ate pharmacist who completely shows support no matter what her decisions, does not have malicious mindset and judgmental tendencies. Sunshine reflects the reality all young women face, the struggles of being a woman in a religious third world country and it is so brave to create this kind of film, so kudos to Direk Antonette Jadaone, Maris Racal, and to everyone behind this. Sunshine's bravery for fighting for what she wants, her exercising her rights, and her choices are what young women of today should follow. It is important to see how women who plan to abort or did abort are NOT completely cruel nor sinners, as they also have a conscience and dilemma as they go through every consideration. Her conscience, being represented by ""bata,"" goes to show how she considered having her, but of course it all just boils down to her body, her choices, and her future. And the rights to have access in safe abortions does NOT only applies to rape victims but all WOMEN. ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE. AND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS HUMAN RIGHTS. Sunshine showed how hard it is to receive health care in the philippines; that we resort to what is accessible even if it meant danger for herself. This is sad but this is reality.

Felt like a wasted opportunity to have Maris Racal be the lead but without a real plot to actually steer. Was it a censorship issue?? I don't understand why they would choose such a topic and not really have a stance on it. Maybe the creators themselves are also confused as to being pro-choice or pro-life, as are most Filipinos due to their religious beliefs (I'm assuming). I'm just saying, if you didn't want to get ""too"" political by having a clearer opinion in the film, then it's probably best to take more time and do more research about the topic, or just make another kind of movie.",2025-11-30,negative,0.7995671033859253,-1

Sunshine,"what hit me the most was how the film shows society’s pressure without ever yelling at you. the judgement, the shame, the rules you’re supposed to follow — it’s all there, always in the background, shaping every choice she makes. but then there are these tiny moments of kindness, little glimmers of hope, and it’s those moments that make the sadness bearableyou really feel her pain, her confusion, her stubborn spark to survive and keep dreaming, even when everything seems against her. and the story doesn’t give you easy answers — it just lets you sit with the reality of what it’s like to be a girl in a world that doesn’t make it easypero na-realize ko na the girl who follows sunshine and calls her “murderer” is not a real person. she represents the harsh judgment sunshine feels from others and the guilt she carries inside herself. the girl is basically the voice of society telling sunshine she did something wrong, even when the situation is more complicated. she’s also sunshine’s own fear and self-blame turned into a person. in short, the girl is the symbol of the guilt and pressure that keep haunting sunshineyung nasa jeep scene fav ko kasi pinakita na how overwhelmed sunshine is without her having to say a word. while she’s sitting in the jeep, everything around her feels loud, messy, and fast—parang tuloy-tuloy yung mundo habang siya, nakastuck. when she starts crying quietly, it shows how much she’s been holding in for so long",2025-11-30,positive,0.8942081928253174,-1

GRABE. sunshine, with her ribbon, was able to be free on the mat. now, clad in her shimmering pink and purple bedazzled spandex, she walks out with the brightest smile in her force and, like the ribbon she’s been acquainted with since childhood, is finally able to take control of her own life.

Sunshine,"Putangina, hanggang ngayon, ang daming lalaking nag-aakalang may karapatan silang magpasya para sa katawan ng babae. What stays with you long after Sunshine ends is how the film treats every moment as something pulled straight from real Filipino girlhood. You see it in the small, mundane ways Sunshine tries to keep herself together like the way she tightens her jaw during training to hide the panic creeping up her spine, how she forces a neutral expression when adults around her throw judgment disguised as concern and the humiliation of realizing everyone expects her to handle a crisis she never chose.Girls grow up by being punished for becoming women. Sunshine is still a teenager, but the moment her pregnancy becomes known, people start talking to her like she owes them maturity, penance, and accountability she was never taught to carry.When Pastor Jaime steps in, offering moral pressure, you can feel the room closing in on her again. Everyone wants her to be a mother. Everyone thinks they have the right to her future. Despite all that pressure, Sunshine’s refusal hits like a rupture in a system built to control her.",2025-11-30,positive,0.7472818493843079,-1

Sunshine,"[ system log : 001 ]user : haziah | age : 23status : active // processingI liked Sunshine because it speaks volumes about the lack of real sex education among teenagers—how so many are left to navigate consequences without ever being given proper knowledge, guidance, or protection. It shows how quickly people are forced into rigid sides—pro-choice or pro-life—without being allowed the space to exist as confused, scared, and human first. I didn’t like it only because Maris Racal’s acting was phenomenal—raw, restrained, and painfully real—but because the film chose to center understanding instead of judgment. It didn’t sensationalize the situation; it made you sit with it.I liked it because it treated the experience as what it truly is: a life-altering moment that cannot be simplified into slogans, morals, or online arguments. It showed how heavy one decision can feel when the world is already crashing down on you. I liked it because it refuses to make the audience comfortable. It doesn’t beg for sympathy, it doesn’t chase approval, and it doesn’t try to make itself digestible for everyone.And most of all, I liked it because it never tells you what the “right” answer is. It simply lays everything bare and lets you face it on your own. It allows you to choose what to feel, what to believe, and what to carry after the credits roll.Some people say it lacked something—especially in its length—that it should’ve been longer, that it ended too soon. But I don’t agree. I think it had to end exactly where it did. Because some stories aren’t meant to be over-explained. Some experiences don’t offer neat closures. The ending didn’t feel incomplete to me—it felt honest.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9673311710357666,1

Sunshine,"""naiintindihan mo ba ako?""Sunshine, at its core, is a film that aims to make the people who watch truly understand. hopefully to also change minds but for that to happen, dapat maintindihan muna kung bakit. and in the spectrum of making films that want to make people listen, Sunshine sits perfectly in the middle. hindi masyadong dinikta yung mensahe to the point that it may be a bit too ""preachy"" kahit walang substance, pero hindi rin nasobrahan sa spectacle at drama at kinulang sa tapang to the point that the message gets blurred. this was a very well executed show and not tell, and show it did.plus everyone was just soooo good. ang husay ng pag arte ng lahat. maris, jennica, annika???? ang husay. no acting to take you out of the scene, no lines to remind you that you're watching a film aiming to be a commercial success (which is a pinoy movie disease, the infamous hugot line syndrome)simple lang. the story was straightforward. it knew what it wanted to tell and it delivered. the topic was handled with care without shying away from the heaviness of it. visually stunning, i love seeing manila filmed as it is and have it be a setting that adds to the storytelling. technically admirable, without losing the heart to tell the story. ms tonet jadaone you've won me over once again. balik nanaman ako sa good side mo po ms jadaone po. please don't stop making pinoy movies tnx po",2025-11-30,positive,0.992867112159729,-1

They have to seek it out. They invent all these gods and demons and things, just so they can feel guilty about things, which is something we do very well on our own. And then they create wars, so they can feel things and touch each other. And when there aren’t any wars, they can play rugby. We have it all going on in here inside. We have pain on a cycle for years and years and years and then just when you feel you are making peace with it all, what happens? The menopause comes. The fucking menopause comes, and it is the most wonderful fucking thing in the world.

Abortion is a woman’s right because she has full authority over her own body. Women are autonomous humans. Reproductive rights should not depend on how tragic the story is. Abortion should not be portrayed as acceptable only for rape survivors or under certain conditions, but as a fundamental expression of bodily autonomy for all women, regardless of their reasons.",2025-11-28,positive,0.8535364270210266,25

Sunshine,"loveee the solidarity of women in the film. especially jeannica's character (sunshine's sister) what stood out to me abt “Sunshine” is how it handles abortion without turning it into shock value or moral debate. the film treats it the way real life does, quietly, privately, and w a kind of heaviness that doesn’t need big explanations. it shows how a situation like this doesn’t happen in a vacuum; it’s shaped by family, religion, money, expectations, fear, and the silence surrounding women’s choices, seeing how, in the film, women were denied healthcare even in life or death situations bc of the values and systems upheld in this country.motherhood demands so much, money, energy, time, and an immeasurable amount of emotional labor. once u step into it, there's no turning back. that's why becoming a mother should never be forced, it's not something anyone should bepushed into. it's not easy to be one.being a mother is a beautiful, yet deeply complex role. it should be intentional, it should be a choice.at the same time, every person brought into this world deserves to be born out of intention, love, and readiness. if someone doesn't want to become a mother, that's OKAY. it's only fair, both to her, and to the life she could've been expected to bring into the world.the movie doesn’t try to justify anything or convince u what is right. instead, it shows the reality of how young people end up dealing w choices they were never prepared for. it’s not dramatic, not preachy, just painfully honest. the long pauses, the still shots, the way conversations trail off… it all reflects how hard it is to say something out loud when yk u’ll be judged before u’re understood.it’s thoughtful, grounded, and uncomfortable in a necessary way. a reminder that behind every headline or opinion is someone trying to figure out how to move forward when every option hurts.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9935637712478638,1

Sunshine,"""naiintindihan mo ba ako?""""gets ko na.""See Greatest Filipino Films Of All TimeSee Jom’s Greatest Films Of All TimeOnce in a while, movies like this will remind us how great Philippine Cinema could be with proper production and marketing.Let's be honest, there are many films like Sunshine out there, produced and marketed independently. The talent of our Filipino directors, writers, and actors is flourishing; it just needs the right hand managing them. Studios surrounding Sunshine took a huge gamble promoting and marketing this movie, because they know how good it is. And it's that fcking good!Sunshine beautifully captures Sunshine, our protagonist, as she battles her way out of an unwanted pregnancy set in the cold city of Manila. This journey was documented with captivating visuals of Sunshine in the gym, in Quiapo, in a motel, etc. On top of this, this is unlike any other dialogue in mainstream Pinoy. The dialogue often has witty layers, purposeful intentions, and emotional punches.Maris Racal delivered a career-defining performance. This is not the same Maris Racal we often see in teleseryes or some other romcom movie. Her performance is an incredible take on such a complex and relatable character.I could nitpick some off details here and there which really bugged me, but I won't talk about it here as I believe that further magnifying this movie's success is what we should do.Sunshine represents every woman, every female, every girl, every lady of any shape or form. It brings up socially relevant topics and issues worthy of discussion. I am most impressed by its bravery to speak all about these, coming from a conservative country. Sunshine, the protagonist, showed bravery in confronting the stigma and the conservative norms. Sunshine, the movie, showed the bravery of promoting and marketing this despite the stigma and the conservative norms.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9865072965621948,-1

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone's ""Sunshine"" is anchored by a stellar lead performance from Maris Racal and a neo-realist perspective on the lack of reproductive rights in the Philippines. The film follows a rhythmic gymnast who dreams of participating in the Olympics, only to find out that she is pregnant. The film explores the difficulties of finding the right medical care for abortion. Racal's performance is impressive, and she is solidly supported by Annika Co, Jennica Garcia, and Meryll Soriano. Jadaone is able to capture the dirt and grime of Manila's urban areas, as well as the outdated beliefs in the country.Reproductive rights for all!",2025-11-30,positive,0.9947570562362671,1

Biggest fear na ata ang maging teenage mom ka dito sa Pilipinas; hindi dahil may nakakahiya, kundi dahil doon na lang irereduce ng lahat ng tao ang buong pagkatao mo. Kung tutuusin, mas cinocondemn pa nga nang iba ‘yung pagpapa-abort kesa sa pagnanakaw o pag-ddrugs na makakalimutan na makalipas ilang araw at babansagang “normal” lang. Sa bawat sulok ng Pilipinas, there would always be a Sunshine or a Mary Grace na aping-api na nga ng patriyarkiya, ilulugmok pa ng mga maka-relihiyon. Just shows how difficult it is to be a woman, especially a woman living in the country of so-called saints.

Sunshine,"The movie did not contain any surprise elements whatsoever — rather, it depicted the realities that Filipino women endure, especially when it comes to pregnancy and abortion. Seeing individuals like Sunshine and Mary Grace deal with the outcomes they did not choose is devastating. It's awful that they had to put their own lives in danger to reclaim their lives. In addition, I detest the notion that women are blamed and criticized while the majority of males who participated in the incident roam free from the consequences. It's horrible how obviously apparent the double standards are. Most of us are aware of the worst-case situations if abortion isn't legalized, and this film accurately depicts the gravity of the situation. If watching this doesn't change your mind about being anti-abortion, I don't know what will. Not everyone is ready to be a mother. Not everyone is capable of being a mother. Is protecting your child's future and safety truly a sin? I truly hope that this movie will continue to inspire empathy and provide better facilities for safe and regulated practices in the country. Let's do better, Philippines.",2025-11-30,positive,0.8461475968360901,9
Sunshine,"“Gets ko na.”Ang dami kong gustong sabihin na feeling ko, hindi ko kayang masulat in a movie review. Literal na daramdamin mo lang yung pelikula and your emotions will be enough for people to understand.Gets na gets ko si Sunshine—from thinking you’re an adult yet feeling like a child; an ambitious girl to a woman on a tightrope; from being alone and criticized by society as a whole to finding your space, your people, your support system despite what people have to say… and ultimately choosing your own peace and happiness—something that is deemed a privilege for women. Hindi naging madali ang pinagdaanan ni Sunshine at ng milyong-milyong babae sa Pilipinas, sa mundo. May mga babaeng katulad niya na hindi sinasadyang mabuntis, may mga babae namang katulad ni Menggay na posibleng ginahasa at pinagsamantalahan. Hindi ko masikmura kung gaano karaming babae ang dumadaan sa ganitong hirap araw-araw at nakakaramdam na wala na silang mapanghahawakan pa. At dadagdag pa sa pasakit ang ang mga lalaki, ang simbahan, gobyerno at mga sarado ang isip sa ganitong sitwasyon. Why is it that women have to suffer the consequences alone, with the whole world—heaven and hell—blaming them for what happened. A world that continues to place heavy pressure on a woman’s shoulders yet crucify them the moment they make a mistake. Society needs to be more forgiving to women who are trying their best to make and take up space without making them sacrifice their whole life and identity. Every woman is a Sunshine of their own, and I hope that they realize that their happiness, their life, their voices and choices matter.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9505261182785034,-1

Sunshine,"SAGOT SA PELIKULANG “SUNSHINE”: HINDI GUGUSTUHIN NG BATA ANG MAMATAY SA ABORSYON KONTRA SA PINAKITA SA PELIKULA----------------------------Paalala: Ito ay dati naming Facebook post na muli naming inilabas dahil nasa Netflix na ang pelikulang ""Sunshine."" Para sa nagnanais na malaman kung sino ang ""unlikely guide"" sa caption, basahin ang post dito. ----------------------------Matapos maibalita ang pelikulang “Sunshine” ni Maris Racal, inaasahan ko na ang pagsuporta nito sa aborsyon o ang pagkitil sa anak na nasa sinapupunan ng kanyang ina. Ngunit, ang hindi ko inasahan ay ang huling parte ng pelikula. Hindi ko pinanood ang pelikulang ito ngunit nagbase ako sa buod nito upang malaman kung ano ang naganap [1].Si Sunshine (Maris Racal) ay naghahanda na sumali sa “gymnastics team” para sa Olympics ngunit nalaman niya na buntis pala siya. Dahil dito, pumunta siya sa Quiapo upang bumili ng pampalaglag. Matapos ng eksenang ito ay makikita na sinusundan siya ng isang batang babae. Iyon pala, ang babaeng ito, na nasa larawan sa post na ito, ay isang “imaginary friend” ni Sunshine. Hindi ko na babanggitin ang gitna ng buod ng kwento ngunit sa huling parte ng pelikula, makikita na si Sunshine ay naghahanda para sa Olympics. Nagpakita muli ang “imaginary friend” na batang babae kay Sunshine. Tinanong ni Sunshine kung nauunawaan ba ng batang babae ang desisyon niya. Matapos nito, pinakita ng batang babae na tinatanggap niya at niyakap niya na may luha sa mata si Sunshine. Ang “plot twist” dito ay ang “imaginary friend” na ito ay ang anak ni Sunshine na namatay dahil sa aborsyon. Sa imahinasyon ni Sunshine, tinanggap ng kanyang anak ang desisyon ni Sunshine na patayin siya sa sinapupunan. Tila ba tinuturo ng pelikulang ito, hindi lang na dapat gawing ligal ang pagpili ng tao na patayin ang anak sa sinapupunan ng ina, kundi gugustuhin ng isang bata na mamatay na lamang sa aborsyon kaysa ang mabuhay dahil sa benepisyo na matatanggap ng nanay kung pinatay na lang ang kanyang anak. Nakakalungkot dahil sobrang sama ng moralidad na ipinapalaganap ng pelikulang ito. Dahil dito, nais ko lang ipakita kung ano ang sinabi ng mga taong nakaligtas sa tangkang aborsyon. Hindi sa lahat ng pagkakataon ay namamatay ang mga anak na pinapalaglag. Dahil dito, mahalaga na makita ang kanilang perspektibo sa usapin ng aborsyon matapos silang makaligtas dito. Sabi ni Linda Swayn na nakaligtas sa aborsyon ngunit nagkaroon ng problema sa kanyang bungo dahil sa bawal na gamot na ginamit sa pampalaglag,""The greatest gift I have received is life. God has given me the greatest gift of life [2].""Ito naman ang mababasa sa buhay ni Charlie Rousseau, isang tagapagsalita sa radyo sa Canada, na nakaligtas ng aborsyon na nagdulot upang mabuhay siyang putol ang braso at dalawang binti,“She wants to continue with her dream to work and live remotely, and see the world [3].""Makikita naman natin na lagi nanaginip ng masama si Kimberly na maaaring parte ng kanyang masamang alaala sa tangkang pagpatay sa kanya,“For as long as I can remember, I would have a recurring nightmare. I could feel it coming, as if someone was coming to kill me... Somehow I knew it was going to kill me! It was terrifying! When I was 15 years old, I woke from the nightmare screaming and crying [4].""Ngayon, huwag muna natin isipin ang aborsyon kundi ang bagong silang na sanggol. Tama ba na patayin sila para hindi maapektuhan ang pangarap ng kanyang nanay? Sa tingin ba natin, sasabihin ng sanggol na tama ang desisyon ng kanyang ina na patayin siya? Malamang ay hindi. Ito rin ang ating rason sa pagtanggol sa buhay ng lahat, lalo na ng mga bata na walang kakayahan ipagtanggol ang kanilang sarili. Galing mismo sa boses ng mga nakaligtas ng aborsyon na alam nila kung gaano ito kasama at gaano kaganda ang buhay. Walang bata ang gugustuhin na sila ay patayin. Itigil na sana nila ang kasinungalingang ipinapalaganap sa pelikulang ito.",2025-11-30,negative,0.5613740086555481,12
Sunshine,"Bring back more filipino movies like this, gets ko sunshineSunshine really hits the mark in portraying toxic filipino culture (since we’re a largely catholic country, abortion is looked as “sinful” and “immoral”) and Filipino women struggles. We don’t even have access to safe abortion, even if the baby is born off of violence since it’s illegal. And it STILL is. Why is the concern of safety regarded for the unborn baby,, not the woman carrying it? Why are we shaming women for not wanting to keep it even if they didn’t ask for it? Kakainis. No more words other than thank you to Antoinette Jadaone for making a movie that tackles the pro-life/pro-choice conflict so well and shows awareness respectfully. Nailed it so hard. It’s uncomfortable to watch, but I can’t imagine the reality of living it.The movie leaving us with the question, are these beliefs that can be challenged more important to uphold than the safety of our Filipino women? How many more women must suffer until it gets through their thick skull that these beliefs and the anti-abortion law actively does more harm than good?Extra: I reco you read Nutribun review of this movie after you’ve watched it, explains it much better than me and i agreed with SO many points.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9336199760437012,9

Witnessing Sunshine's inner dilemma of wanting to be an olympian, kitang kita mo kung paano niya gawin ang lahat para sa pangarap niya.

Sunshine,"this isn’t really a film about mistakes. well, at least for me. it’s a film about the quiet burdens women carry—those moments when the world expects you to stay composed while everything inside you is breaking apart. what stayed with me wasn’t the plot itself, but the feeling of watching a girl stand at the edge of her dreams while life keeps pulling her in directions she never asked for.there is a particular kind of loneliness here that Filipinas know too well: the pressure to be strong, the fear of being judged, the lack of safe spaces to fall apart... The film captures that ache, the way society can be quick to moralize but slow to understand.For me, it felt like looking at a reflection of a system we’ve all quietly learned to navigate: the whispers, the shame, the institutions that pretend to help but rarely do. Yet in those heavy moments, you still see a girl trying to choose herself, even when the world insists she shouldn’t.it’s messy, raw, and painfully familiar… and that’s why it felt less like watching a film and more like remembering something you wish you could forget.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9616154432296753,-1

Sunshine,"just had to rewatch once more. ito, seryoso na at skl ko lang din this anecdote of mine. i remember being a transferee in sixth grade when i was suddenly forced into an intra-school debate tournament. one of the motions i had was about the legalization of abortion and i was placed in the opposing team. i vividly remember kung paano ako naging mulat sa topic na ‘to and i thought to myself, “oo nga, ‘no? bakit nga ba bawal?” i honestly had a hard time countering the government side’s points, so i just ended up focusing on my own arguments (without saying any rebuttals) instead — buti leader of the opp. lang ako no’n, lol. our debate teacher, or the madam chair, was very strict about not using the church as a basis when making an argument. but all i could think of then was the bible, i couldn’t think of any other countering argument na pwede kong maibato.and so, if a small-scale school debate tournament prohibits using the church as an argument, why can’t we demand the same from our government? bakit patuloy na iginigiit ang impluwensya ng simbahan sa batas if we supposedly live in a secular state?sunshine and all filipino (women) do not deserve this bullshit. free and accessible (reproductive) healthcare for filipinos!on the side note, this film is incredibly well-made and fearless. salamat, direk tonet and to everyone involved. give maris racal her flowers juseyo! i’m sooo glad i finally got to watch this kasi i missed the local screening months ago. i really hope na maging mulat ang bawat manonood kung bakit napaka-timely at mahalaga ang mga pelikulang tulad nito.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9764590263366699,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine offers a quiet yet affecting exploration of teenage pregnancy and abortion—two issues deeply intertwined with the social and economic realities of our country. What makes the film striking is its simplicity: it doesn’t rely on heavy dramatics, but instead allows its heartfelt moments and grounded storytelling to speak for themselves.I particularly appreciated how the film subtly incorporated supernatural elements. Rather than distracting from the story, these touches added depth and symbolism, making the film feel both intimate and introspective. It’s a creative choice that gives Sunshine a unique emotional texture.As someone who grew up Catholic, I’ve never taken a firm stance on abortion; I’ve mostly remained indifferent or unsure. But this film pushed me to reflect on the bigger picture. It gently raises a painful yet necessary question: Why bring a child into a country that struggles to provide a dignified, nurturing environment for its people? Without forcing a specific viewpoint, Sunshine invites viewers to confront the harsh realities that many young Filipinos face—stories that are often ignored or oversimplified.Overall, Sunshine succeeds not just as a piece of cinema, but as a conversation starter. It lingers with you, urging you to think about compassion, choice, and the societal conditions that shape both. It’s a simple film, but one with a resonance that’s hard to forget.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9927984476089478,1

PRO-LIFERS.WOMEN'S RIGHTS SHOULDN’T BE SOMETHING TO BE DEBATED!“Hindi pa ako ready maging nanay” is already a valid reason for abortion. It’s her choice, not a moral issue for everyone to judge. Nakakalungkot noong ipinakita sa movie na ito kung gaano kalala ang situation sa public hospitals—kulang sa resources, walang safe at stigma-free options, mayroon pa ngang nanganganak na lang sa sahig dahil sa kakulangan sa mga tao at kagamitan. Kaya hindi nakapagtataka na for many women, the “safest” choice ends up being underground options, kahit sobrang risky. Mas ironic pa, kasi nasa paligid lang ng simbahan ang mga nagbebenta ng pamparegla, hilot, at kung anu-ano, tapos ang narrative ng church: “kung natukso ka, talo ka.” Kaya understandable that the “tukso” becomes sometimes the only lifeline for someone desperate. Women bear the brunt of the hypocrisy. That’s literally the only way a woman could access it. Hindi ko alam kung bakit kapag babae ka, ang daming bawal sa’yo. Pero hindi ka naman bibigyan ng reliable options. Napaka eye-opening nito sa atin, lalo na’t ipinakita sa atin na wala tayong karapatan husgahan ang batang ina kasi hindi natin alam ang pinagdadaanan nila.

Sunshine,"“Drown out the noise. You are Sunshine.”it’s heartbreaking how many young women are going through this right now. abortion in the Philippines is not only illegal, but also so deeply stigmatized that many are forced to carry this burden alone, sometimes risking their own lives through unsafe procedures. the film portrays this reality with such quiet honesty that it sticks with you. the symbolism throughout was also so striking, like the “Gift of God” sign in the jeepney Sunshine rode, or her so-called imaginary friend who could represent her unborn child or her inner child.it was honestly so satisfying watching her stand up for herself against miggy and his father, who’s a pastor. then of course, her breaking the bottle on tito bobot’s head? deserved. every mf like him deserves that.the final sequence felt incredibly freeing as well. it was like she was finally free, almost like a release of everything she had been carrying — fear, shame, pressure, expectation. her imaginary friend disappearing can be interpreted that she did push through with the abortion (which parallels the 13 y/o kid and ariana), or as her finally finding peace with whatever choice she made. hopefully, this film gives conservatives some perspective on the immense weight placed on women in these situations, and they’ll finally be able to say, “Gets ko na.” not everyone has the means to raise a child, especially when society is quick to judge. and even if you do have the means, you might simply not be ready because you might still have dreams you want to chase. it’s really tough, and that’s why kindness matters so much.at the end of the day, we shouldn’t be the ones deciding what women should do with their bodies. and yeah, practice safe sex!!",2025-11-30,positive,0.991877555847168,1

Sunshine,"crazy movie to watch with your boyfriend for the first time (no regrets)- says a lot that i already knew the realities the movie was meant to expose because it's a very real possibility for me (and i've experienced some parts firsthand) (XD) (i am never going back to reddit that had me believing in some bs) (which is based on truth naman but still you could never fully trust these sites)- some aspects of teenage pregnancy and abortion might be new to some people because these things wouldn't concern them in the first place (men) (conservatives)- which is why the characters feel very planted. as in, their role is In Your Face (to name a few: the kids, piolo pascal*, miggy**, ate, her kid, unhelpful little brother that shares a room with her lol, whole tito boyet sideplot)- but i think the best thing this movie does is spark conversation, especially since it covers those unsaid aspects (e.g., the role of the church & ses, feelings of dread & anxiety when faced with the possibility of being pregnant, again: reddit, the actual pain & danger of an abortion) and makes it Palatable for d general ph audience!!!!!!!- again, since this is a taboo topic, people wouldn't want something too extreme and radical, so this movie is a good first step towards talking about it- still tho, the palatability made the ending so ass for me personally like. everything just started coming together a lil too smoothly for sunshine and honestly... for me ha...... Meh..........- anyway, props to maris racal for executing the choreo holy shit. so impressive and so cleanalso, Wow this movie hit so close to home, even outside of the content mismo1) towers2) i have never seen a movie with so many familiar landmarks like vito cruz (hello what other ""mainstream"" media's been filmed here), recto, avenida, quiapo. plus the lrt and the fact that they commuted everywhere!! i loved that3) all girls (cliques) and all boys school aspect. plus the fact that they were in a relationship coz partner school ata lol4) the fact she basically had no one but herself at one point oh my god made me So grateful for my support systemtbh the only thing that made me cry from this movie was the ate coming to bed with sunshine Ough... and the very hard conversation i had with aldy after coz wow we did not process that pala (o diba sparks conversation) but yes good movieside notes* i'm so sorry nathrow off aq sa mukha nya like the movie has pretty new faces for me so seeing him was like Woah. what are u doing here** casting for him was actually spot on. straight from a private school",2025-11-29,positive,0.9955571293830872,-1

Para sa'kin, purong-puro 'yung mga scenes, naipakita talaga 'yung reyalidad ng buhay pagdating sa mga taong katulad ni Sunshine, mga pangyayari na katulad ng sa kanya. Pati 'yung sitwasyon na nangyayari sa mga public hospitals, 'yung mga facilities na binabayaran natin gamit ang tax natin, ay hindi nila magawang maayos. May mga doktor pang kung umasta ay hindi sila propesyonal at napaka-condescending. It is the reality of life here in the Philippines. Napansin ko rin that hatred for abortion is rooted from patriarchy and religion, napakahirap maging babae kapag ito ang mga kalaban mo, 'no? Sa babae ang sisi, sa babae ang lahat ng kasalanan habang ang mga lalaki ay may tinatawag na ""free pass."" Sabi pa nga nila, ""Ba't ka kasi bumubukaka,"" o kaya naman, ""Kung sino-sino na lang kasi ang kinakalantari mo."" Those things are the representation of the mindset of those who deem themselves as religious, but for me, they are just a bunch of hypocrites. Men can even be erased from the picture, and women will continue being condemned. Fuck people with double standards. Our society is so hypocrite that 'yung mga tinatawag na ""pamparegla"" ay natatagpuan malapit sa labas ng simbahan. Gaano sila kamapanghusga sa mga babaeng may karapatan sa kanilang sariling katawan, ipinapakita 'yan sa paniniwala nilang biased at outdated. It is sad to think na kailangan pa ng mga kababaihan na mag-lean towards these illegal means just to afford being free, when in the first place, it is their right to have a legal, safer, and non-demoralizing way to abort when it means taking care of their body, preventing the unborn from having a miserable life, and just letting women have their right to bodily autonomy. It just shows na napaka-patriarchal ng batas, sumabay pa 'yang pagiging misogynistic ng lipunang ginagalawan natin. These force women into motherhood and to have a life they do not want, and guess what happens after that? The cycle continues. Sa mga katulad ni Sunshine, at sa mga kababaihan, I'm proud of you.

Yet somehow, the film manages to confront its darkest truths while still carving out a sliver of hope. The performances are extraordinary—raw, fearless, and honest—but they make the film difficult to watch in the best possible way. It exposes how our country refuses to grow, medicine needed for the operation coming from black markets, how it continues to force women into roles far smaller than what they’re capable of, and how it avoids addressing issues that desperately need to be talked about. Women deserve choice. They deserve agency. They deserve that right without question.This film places you in the shoes of a woman who believes her life has been shattered by one reckless decision made by someone she trusted—and then shows, unflinchingly, how our society treats victims.Hopefully, the success of this film reignites the conversation around the importance of being pro-choice and pushes us toward building a better, more humane system.All we hope for is a little sunshine to finally break through.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9725549221038818,1

Sunshine,"this film doesn't just tell a story; it exposes a system. for that reason, it stands as one of the most important films ever made in the philippines. honestly, it deserves far more attention, discussion, and recognition. include it in school curriculums too if possible.you don't need tearful monologues, or dramatic breakdowns (not that there's anything wrong with them) to understand the full weight of sunshine's situation. the film uses restraint as its sharpest tool. the dim, muted visuals; the overwhelming noise of her environment; the way the camera locks her in the centre of the frame.. always boxed in, always between lines.. all emphasise how trapped she is by the social and religious stigma, and by a society that refuses to recognise abortion as a woman's right. the blurred backgrounds aren't just aesthetic; they reinforce her disconnection from the world around her. she doesn't have the luxury to care about anything beyond her immediate reality: herself, her dreams, and the looming consequences of every decision she faces.and that is the tragedy, sunshine is a young woman with ambition, yet she navigates a world that is unforgiving. she is asked to seek god's forgiveness for attempting to abort the baby, yet if god is understanding, wouldn't he understand that she is not ready, and that she acted out of necessity? with abortion vilified and access almost impossible, the film illustrates how society corners, isolates, and silences young mothers.. not with loud condemnation, but with quiet, crushing inevitability. it is a devastating portrait of how systemic and cultural forces conspire to limit women's autonomy, and a reminder of the human cost of denying choice.one of the most striking elements of the film, for me, is its gendered power dynamic. every character, without exception, imposes his own beliefs onto sunshine. urging her to keep the baby, citing legality, morality, or personal conviction. their ""advice"" is never about her well-being, it's about controlling her choices. the absence of a single moment where a man asks what she wants is not accidental, it reflects a broader social structure where women's autonomy is secondary to male authority.the women in the film, however, present a more nuanced spectrum. some internalise patriarchal norms and unintentionally reinforce them, but many others recognise sunshine's struggle immediately. they empathise not because they have the answers, but because they understand the emotional, economic, and social burden that falls disproportionately on women. their solidarity is quiet but powerful. a direct contrast to the coercive, dismissive tone of the male characters. the film ultimately critiques how systems built and upheld by men deny women agency, especially around reproductive choices. in a society where institutional and cultural norms consistently silence women, the film shows that women often became each other's only source of validation, understanding, and empowerment. no scene is waster. nothing is filler. every character is intentionally placed, each one shaping or limiting sunshine's decisions in ways that feel painfully real.",2025-11-30,positive,0.9280344247817993,42

Sunshine,"Yes! This is the type of films the Philippines should make more! Finally a movie with substance, relevance, and courage to tell a story despite cultural taboo. This is required and essential.I thought an hour and a half wouldn’t be enough to dig deeper into the journey of Sunshine but it was actually just enough to see all of it. Although, there were unnecessary choices made in the film that I disliked and that I wish were done differently and I wish saw more of Sunshine’s character in the lowest of lows or maybe I’m just greedy. However,Maris Racal is a revelation. And for the Philippines to have such a film like this one that speaks to so many women, even men, in the country. I hope this is a step forward for the country to move progressively and this be a force for politicians to pass that bill. Because after all, films are made to speak out, protest, and to implement change. Lastly, Sunshine is such a huge step towards good filmmaking in the Philippines. We need more films that speak of truth and of society. Stories that need to be heard and not rely too much on fake romance. Though Sunshine isn’t perfect as a film itself, the courage and the amount of truth revealed in an hour and a half are enough to have the voices of so many women be heard.

MARIS RACAL I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH YOUR GAME!Ang kwento, ang cinematography, ang emosyon!!! Sobrang raw and realistic from the familiar “jeje” song playing sa jeep pagsakay ni Sunshine, to the 13 yr old na nakaranas ng pang aabuso mula sa kanyang tito (talamak ang kaso ng incest sa pinas, thank u direk for highlighting that). Sa sobrang realistic pati ang inis ko kuhang kuha ng conservative doctor. Literally had to pause and say “Putangina” pag sabing “Baka yan pala ang magiging future presidente ng Pilipinas or ang makakagamot sa AIDS.”Ang pelikulang ito ay napakatapang. It had the guts to shine a spotlight on a longstanding issue sa bansa na lagi na lang inooverlook. It dare call out and address what Filipinos considered as taboo. And as someone who had a debate with her mom over dinner about abortion, this film is so special to me. “Hindi ka ba kinikilabutan?” were my moms’ exact words but I cannot blame her. Being a country deeply rooted in Christianity, where morals and teachings of the church are deeply ingrained in you ever since you were young, it is actually hard to speak freely about this things without the catholic guilt creeping up on you. Kaya ang laki rin ng significance ng pagdasal muna ni Sunshine before nya gawin. To ask the lord for forgiveness.Plus it doesn’t shy away from showing the state of the country’s public healthcare system. Nakakaputangina lang. Putangina ng gobyerno. Putangina ng sistema kung saan kailangan maging life-threatening situation ang pagpapalaglag. Banning abortion does not end it, it only makes it unsafe for women since it causes them to resort to underground means. And what an irony that one of those means can be found tucked under the shadows of the church (mga ale na nagbebenta ng pamparegla, u carry so much hope for these women). The very church that condemns it and shuns women who will even consider it. This film is a big step in understanding women’s bodily autonomy. Mas mahalaga pa rin ang buhay ng nagdadalang-tao. Lastly, Annika (the child symbolizing Sunshine’s future child) saying “Gets ko na” at the end is so so dear huhu. Bata pa ang bata para magkabata. She has her whole life ahead of her and god forbid a woman chooses herself and her dreams. Gets ko na, Sunshine. Gets ko na.",2025-11-30,positive,0.5542739629745483,-1

Sunshine,"Hands down, wala akong masabi sa palabas na ‘to. This film reveals everything about the Philippines that we don’t often talk about. Many Filipinos have no choice kasi illegal ang abortion dito, and young women are forced into situations THEY NEVER REALLY WANTED. It shows the harsh reality of how society constantly pressures women into motherhood, ignoring their dreams, their health, and their right to make decisions about their own bodies. The film doesn’t sugarcoat the pain physical, emotional, and mental—that comes with being trapped in a system that refuses to acknowledge their autonomy.What hits the hardest is how normalized this struggle has become, and how many are suffering in silence. Especially the story of rhed bustamante’s character. Grabe. 13 years old nag cacarry na ng baby  a child carrying a child. This is a message to all the people to talk more openly about abortion, to stop victim-blaming, and to hold those useless shitty ass irresponsible men accountable. It’s more than a movie—it’s a wake-up call, a plea for empathy, and a DEMAND for change. Sobrang gets kita, sunshine.",2025-11-29,positive,0.7647103667259216,-1

Sunshine,"SUCH AN IMPORTANT FILM!!!!During these times, we genuinely need more films like this. First, not only does it touch on the struggles of a young woman faced with an unwanted pregnancy. It also shows how easy it is for the men to rid themselves of the responsibility. Miggy DID NOT give a fuck about Sunshine. He wanted her to deal with it herself; he wasn't even going to give her money if she didn't threaten him. It was his fault that she got pregnant, and yet she has to suffer the consequences of their unprotected sex, which he insisted upon. Second, it is very important how this film shows that early/childhood pregnancies are not just because of young people's 'kapabayaan.' More often than not, young girls' pregnancies are results of sexual assault and rape by predators. I cried when I saw Mary Grace, even more when we were told she's just 13. JUST 13!!!!! She wasn't ""wreckless,"" she wasn't out there having sex with anyone; she was raped by her own uncle. And she's just expected to mother the child born out of such a horrific thing done to her?Third, it shows you just how important legalizing abortion is. It's already happening out there. People are selling abortive pills or concoctions. People are doing basement abortions, in unsafe conditions, without licensed doctors. It's happening and it's dangerous. Sunshine was hospitalized. Mary Grace almost died. If abortion was legal, none of this would've happened. These girls would've been safe and cared for.Again, what an important film! It also shows how abysmal the healthcare system is in the Philippines. Overcrowded hospitals, little to no financial support, etc.On top of that, phenomenal performances all around. Maris Racal was great. Jennica Garcia was, as usual, brilliant. Rhed Bustamante, you will always be a star.This might be the longest entry in my letterboxd rn.

Sunshine,"One thing I like about Sunshine is its brazen risk to center the story on a 19-year old who's made consequentially irresponsible choices. It's a gambit that can easily be -- and, judging by discussions surrounding this movie, has already been -- misconstrued as a lesson on the importance of hammering down our society's puritanical views on sex and reproductive health to set teenage girls straight. That, somehow, Sunshine is a lesson in, as the elders say, ""opening your legs for just about anybody""; that she did not listen to the adage is an absolute failing on her part, and its consequences fall rightfully on her shoulders. But here's the tricky bit: Sunshine could very well have been about a mother who could no longer give birth to another, and it would have still been met with the same logic-defying resistance that still places the blame squarely on the woman. Minor gripes include a finicky plot device that, at times, feels jarring and slightly questionable in terms of messaging. But it all feels egregious to say because the urgency of its existence really dwarfs over whatever minor flaws it may have. It also helps that Sunshine carried is so deftly by Maris Racal's and Jennica Garcia's career-defining performances, and a score by Rico Blanco that knows how to restrain and reintroduce itself in all the right moments.Sunshine cracks open a conversation on an obstinately immovable subject, and unflinchingly exposes the grim reality on how our women and girls move about our society, bearing the problems that we could easily find solutions to but which our religious guilt and intolerance constantly shame us into denying.",2025-11-29,positive,0.9077398180961609,1

Sunshine,"This is such a wake-up call about how dangerous abortion can be when it’s not done safely. That’s why we really need to legalize abortion, so women can have the option and so it can be done medically and safely. It’s funny how all the men in the movie reflect real life, where they don’t have a fucking ounce of understanding about women’s reproductive health. This also reflects how men often dictate the legalization of abortion when they shouldn’t, because they don’t even have a fucking UTERUS!Also, fuck that old doctor. Holier-than-thou people are the most hypocritical pieces of shit. Instead of empathizing with Sunshine, she had the audacity to take the religious route.The storyline of the thirteen-year-old also shows that people should not have a child if they cannot fucking provide and protect. It reflects our current society especially the poor children whose parents are pieces of shit. And that’s exactly why abortion should be legalized so women can have the option if they are not ready. Just look at her life; she was born to a mother who doesn’t care and a rapist uncle who should be imprison.Why the fuck is the Philippines so backward? Fuck all the corrupt politicians. Also, what the fuck was that male doctor doing denying care to a child whose life was at stake because of the abortion? Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t think that happens in real life. Doctors should save a patient regardless of whether it was due to an abortion, especially when the patient is critical. As a healthcare worker, I have never witnessed a doctor deny care to a critical patient.Despite her issues, MARIS RACAL ALWAYS DELIVERS!",2025-11-30,positive,0.6395184993743896,25

Sunshine,"the premise alone is enough for me to give it a full rating. to come up with a movie about one of the most taboo topics in this predominantly catholic country—given how conservative almost everyone is about it, how it’s actively vilified and condemned, how those who seek it are treated as no better than murderers, and how women are left to fend for themselves and look for alternative ways, whether through an underground clinic, safe or unsafe, or a seller’s comforting words when you don’t even know if the medicine will work—is a huge feat. it has been long overdue, but this is already a big step for everyone. abortion is, and will always be, healthcare.film-wise though, i absolutely LOVE the color grading. i usually hate SOME filipino movies (omg i’m sorryyyy) because the coloring pisses me off (like ik we can do better). idk how to pinpoint what gives me the ick but,,, yeah. sunshine’s though was nice. and it was a delight to see bits of manila’s vibe. always shady, dirty, BUT well, that’s our country and i loved the actual showcase of it. there were some symbolism and stills of how ironic some scenes can be too!! nice touch :) from the pills next to the statues to the jeepney signs. the plot is predictable for me (re: what those kids are), but not in a bad way. it just shows that it’s working, and i feel seen. a lot of women will feel seen. not saying we went through the exact same thing, but generally, the gist of thinking your life is over, or will be if it does happen, because we don’t have a choice in the first place, and are expected to just live with it, is familiar. the amount of mental gymnastics people will spew about “the future of the children,” how they could be “the next inventor of a cure,” while never considering the mother, who has her own ambitions, who has to give birth, raise the child, and provide the system and support for their hypothesis to even happen… it’s all broken-record arguments. these are the usual lines they’ll say, and some of their reactions (doctors, friends, “partners”) really DO HAPPEN irl and it’s proof that the film is heavily based from real experiences, and well researched enough about the actual process people will go through (and went through) for this. here’s to shed light, to inform, and hopefully, to make people more open, thoughtful, and willing to give women the autonomy they deserve.mic drop",2025-11-29,positive,0.9939538836479187,-1

It’s more than just dreams being unattainable, people stereotyping you including yourself, other people making decisions for you as if it’s their life. But it’s also about the lack of safe and available procedure for people like sunshine and mary grace. There’s this one scene that made me giggle haha. The jeepney signage saying “Gift of God” stoping in a “no unloading” sign. I also love that they give the possible future kids a face. Something i think that helped sunshine solidify her decision.Ang hirap lang kase masyadong ipokrito and mga pilipino na kesyo masama ang magpalaglag ng bata, bawal maghiwalay ang pinagsama ng Diyos pero karamihan din sa mga yan sumusuporta sa mamamatay tao.",2025-11-29,positive,0.9843772649765015,32

HINDI SIYA MADALI, lalo na if may iba pang circumstances na kailangan tignan. sana magets ng mga close-minded people yung point pag pinanood nila.kung iisipin, buhay ng isang babae in real life ang buhay ni sunshine sa pelikula. pero kahit nakikita natin si sunshine sa ordinaryong Pilipina, napakahirap pa rin ng conversation surrounding abortion. kaya ang tapang talaga ng movie for inviting discussion on this topic.hindi ko nagets at first pero i appreciate how the kid represented her unborn child. ang ganda nung ""yung pangarap ko, kung ano ang pangarap niya"" nakakaiyak...ang galing galing galing ni maris racal!!!!!gets ko na :)",2025-11-29,positive,0.9409309029579163,2

Sunshine,"if there is light, kahit konting-konti lang, we chase it—because sometimes that’s the only thing left for women to hold.sunshine (2025) is the kind of film na hindi ka pinapa-wow sa effects or spectacle. instead, it sits beside you quietly, like a friend na alam lahat ng pagod mo kahit hindi mo sinabi. it’s woman-centered in the most unsettling, honest way—walang sugarcoating, walang mythologizing, just the raw truth of being a girl in a country that asks you to endure more than it ever protects.the film strips away the usual softness associated with its title. sunshine isn’t light; she’s a girl trying to survive a world that keeps dimming her. and when the story touches the issue of abortion not being legalized in the Philippines, it doesn’t sensationalize it—pinapakita lang niya ‘yung totoo: na in this country, women are expected to carry consequences alone. that reproductive rights become moral battles instead of health and safety; na the system treats our pain like an inconvenience, our choices like crimes.‘yung internal struggle ni Sunshine—‘yung fear, guilt, confusion, desperation—hindi dahil “mahina siya,” but because society makes women feel cornered by circumstances we never chose. and the film doesn’t villainize her for thinking about her future; it villainizes the world that forces her to justify wanting one.and then there’s Miggy.Miggy is… familiar. not evil, not abusive, just painfully typical. he represents the kind of boyfriend most girls in the philippines know too well—the one who “cares,” but only until it requires accountability. the boy who says “I’m here for you” pero umiilag sa big conversations. the boy who loves you but doesn’t understand the weight you carry because he’s never had to carry anything like it.Miggy is the embodiment of how boys in this country are raised: may freedom without consequence, may opinion without knowledge, may presence without responsibility. his reactions, his avoidance, even his attempts to comfort—they feel real because they’re exactly what so many girls have lived through. boys who think support is just saying “kaya natin ’to” while leaving the actual pain to us.sunshine 2025 becomes a commentary on how women are taught to be accountable for everything—including mistakes that weren’t only theirs—while men are taught to be forgiven for everything. the movie doesn’t hate Miggy; it exposes him. it shows the casualness of male privilege, the way it slips into daily life unnoticed but heavy—always heavy—on our side.and that’s what makes the film hit: it’s not loud, not preachy, not dramatic. it just shows the truth—and the truth is already loud enough.sunshine isn’t a story about brightness; it’s a story about women trying to navigate a world that refuses to make space for their choices, their fears, their bodies, their futures. it’s a film that says:the pain wasn’t yours alone, but somehow, you were the only one expected to carry it.and long after the credits, you’re left with that hurt—the kind that reminds you why we keep fighting for a world where women don’t have to beg for the right to their own lives.",2025-11-28,positive,0.9586190581321716,-1

Tapos mga sagrado katoliko pa na pinipilit 'yung aral ng dyos na di naman nila sinusunod lang din.

Sana makareach sya ng wider audience pa at mamulat sila sa reyalidad na kinahaharap ng mga babae at kabataang babae.Just to reiterate, women OR girls, shouldn't feel guilty for wanting to get abortion. It doesn't matter if you got pregnant from abuse or if you willingly participated, kung ayaw mo edi ayaw mo. Tapos dapat ang usapan. Wala nang tanong tanong kung naabuso ka ba or kung ginusto mo ba.

Sunshine,"Ang hirap mangarap sa pilipinas, at mas lalong mahirap maging babaeng nangangarap sa pilipinas. Here, our dreams can be taken away in just one snap. The hardship every woman face in this country was shown in this movie — everything in every angle. From the lack of support from the government, the inequalities women face, how fucked up the mentalities of most of the Filipinos, struggles in the face of poverty, to the fragility of our dreams. ""Libre lang mangarap"" they say, but it's not really free when you live in this country. It costs you your dignity, and even your life.---- I just know na I chose Humanities and Social Sciences to broaden up my understanding, perspective, and empathy like how this movie exposed and depicted our reality. We all need exposure to learn, since parang hindi sapat yung everyday witnessed struggles nating mga Pilipino, let this movie open your eyes on how f-ed up our system in this country really is.

Sunshine,"Sunshine (2024) is the most needed Filipino film of our generation and the generations to come. Beyond the excellent storytelling and technicalities, the message it conveys in a predominantly Catholic & conservative country is a long-overdue revelation of the reality of women.The film opens conversations for the uncomfortable truth of human nature. This is not just Sunshine's story. This is also the story of every woman and every young girl who face the challenges of being silenced and whose rights are being dictated and stepped on by our society.Maris perfectly portrayed Sunshine as a woman who knows what she wants and realizes the power that she and every other woman should have.The rest of the cast realistically depicted the Filipino society that reflects their morals on the teachings of Christianity. Moreover, the two ""imaginary"" characters brought life to the film by displaying the faces behind the masked moralities our society tells us.As a child of unwanted birth and as an adoptee, I know deep in my heart how much I advocate for abortion. I will always side with what is just and right; the ability of women to have access to reproductive health and the power of women to make decisions for their own life.Maraming salamat sa tapang at galing mo, Direk Tonet.",2025-11-29,positive,0.984855592250824,1

Sunshine,"I watched this film with my very religious family. I didn't say a word the whole duration of the film— yet every few minutes, without fail, at least one of my family members would nag me about teenage pregnancy and promiscuity. I heard countless demeaning phrases like ""kita mo yan? alam mo na ha, pag ikaw"" and ""san ka pupulutin kung di namin sinasabi sayo 'to?"". I'm 15, they don't even let me watch movies with sex scenes on the family tv. (but obviously i still do watch movies beyond my age rating) The overbearing nature of religion is truly a problem in the philippines; and among our people, the vast majority of our country is made up of catholics, and it seems like the state is sometimes one with the church because of that fact. I commend this movie for being a step in the right direction. It's showing the true nature of these things to our often ignorant and close-minded society. I know it's still a long way to a progressive philippines, but atleast i know there are still measures being made to ensure that we will get there.

Sunshine,"Authentic depiction of how the female reproductive health is viewed and discussed in the Philippines. It is terrifying and undeniably demeaning that many, if not all, do not have access to these basic rights and thus continue to endanger the lives of many women out there. It is more infuriating to know that this also includes children as young as 13. Though this inclusion in the film may seem minor, it actually emphasizes that not being able to be given a choice to our own body steals our futures away.I also liked the nuances and subtle details that made this film feel more humane and relatable, including the motto etched on the Jeepney Sunshine rode when she found out she was pregnant, which was “GIFT OF GOD.” Hands down, Maris Rascal nailed this role. Those facial expressions? Period. Bonus na rin appearance ni Piolo Pascual.I could yap about this film but for the sake of my fingers typing this review, I’ll leave this as it is for now.All in all, this one is a great watch.",2025-11-29,positive,0.9968365430831909,-1

Sunshine,"Nadama ko sa pelikula na mag-isa si Sunshine sa kanyang tinatahak ngunit nadama ko din na may iilang sumoporta sa kanya at ito ay mga kapwa kababaihan.Ito ang mga babae sa istorya na tumatak para sa akin: Sa eksena kung saan tinanggihan ng isang lalaking doctor i-attend ang batang nag pahilot sa takot na mawalan siya ng lisensiya at isang babaeng doctor ang nag lakas loob na tulungan ang bata. Ito ay realidad na ang batas sa bansang ito ay nakaka apekto sa pag lilingkod kapwa. Ang ate ni Sunshine na inintindi at sinuportohan hindi lamang ang desisyon kundi ang pangarap ni Sunshine. Malaking aspeto ang pagkakaroon ng kapamilya na hindi ka i-guiguilt trip o susumbatan ka sa nagawa mo, bagkus nag tiwala siya na alam ni Sunshine kung ano ang makakabuti para sa sarili niya. Ang imaginary child na nag boses na gets niya ang alab sa puso na makamit ang pangarap ni Sunshine. Sa tanong na who will protect women? Ang sagot ay tayo. Tayong kapwa kababaihan ang palaging tumutulong sa isa't isa dahil alam natin ang bigat ng mundong pasan pasan natin. Sa bansang hindi prayoridad ang kalusugan ng kababaihan, napakita ng pelikulang ito ang realidad ng isang babae kakapit sa kung anong meron sa paligid niya na paraan para mag palaglag dahil pinag kakait sa atin ang accessible healthcare.

Sunshine,"alam mo ung line sa pelikula na “drown out the noise”? grabe teh!!! hindi lang siya tungkol sa literal na ingay,, it’s the kind of noise na araw-araw nating dinadala bilang babae — yung ingay ng expectations, ng moralism, ng judgment, ng kung sino-sinong feeling entitled magsabi kung ano dapat gawin sa katawan natin. at ang lakas, ang gulo, ang bigat niyang lunurin.pero habang pinapanood ko ang Sunshine, doon ko talaga naramdaman na,, ang hirap na ngang mabuhay bilang babae… tapos nasa Pilipinas ka pa.hindii basta hirap na surface level — but that kind of struggle na nakakadrain sa pagkatao mo. ung bawat galaw mo, may mata. bawat desisyon mo, may opinyon. bawat pangarap mo, may kapalit na moral judgment. ung tipong ikaw ang may katawan, pero hindi ikaw ang may pinaka-malakas na boses tungkol dito.&&& watching sunshine, parang may kirot na very familiar,, hueyyy!!! yung struggle ni Sunshine? hindi siya layo sa totoong nararanasan ng maraming babae.yng pagpili sa sarili kahit lahat ng tao around you sinasabi kung ano dapat mong gawin. ung bigat ng moralistic expectations.YUNG TAKOT!!!! YUNG GUILT !!!!!!! YUNG SHAME!!! na hindi naman dapat sa’yo ibinibigay pero ikaw ang nagdadala.kaya naman isa malaking PUTANGINA TALAGA NG MGA LALAKI (no explanation needed)pero ang powerful dito,, pinapakita ng pelikula na kahit gaano kaingay, kahit gaano kagulo — may karapatan kang piliin ang sarili mo.at gaya ng bata “yung pangarap ko, kung ano ang pangarap niya"" at “gets ko na.”",2025-11-29,negative,0.7194709181785583,-1

Sunshine,"Grabe napaiyak naman ako nito. Although I have personal reservations about Maris Racal due to past issues, her performance in this film was undeniably amazing. Sunshine is a definite eye-opener regarding religion, stigma, and the taboo surrounding abortion matters here in the Philippines.I genuinely feel for all the women represented by the characters of Sunshine and Rhed. They may have different names, but they share a rough, unfair path: being stigmatized and pressured to conform to religious and misogynistic beliefs about motherhood. They are forced into the role of nurturing a child, often without considering their own agency.I particularly noticed the scene when Miggy and his father confronted Sunshine about her situation. They never once asked her what she wanted. Their ""plans"" were simply laid out for her to accept without a word, effectively depriving her of choice. This lack of genuine care is what hurts. Furthermore, the film shows how these women are forced to go through dangerous and unhygienic lengths just to pursue their personal dreams, highlighting how their rights as human beings are limited solely because of their CHOICE.I appreciate this film immensely, and it should be talked about more. The tragic reality of Rhed’s character, a 13-year-old victim raped and impregnated by her own uncle, is a situation faced by many. Yet, victims like her are still discriminated against for wanting an abortion. The movie effectively represents this toxicity, such as the scene where the OB-GYN cruelly orders a literally pale and blue Sunshine to ""repent"" while she is struggling in a hospital bed.This film is beautifully made. I sincerely hope that someday, people will truly receive the message: Every woman should have a choice. Depriving them of that fundamental choice does NOT make one a saint.",2025-11-29,positive,0.9907752871513367,1

Sunshine,"Watched this before sa sinehan and with the netflix release, had the chance to watch it again alone and at home (can repeat scenes too).It's as good as I remember. It challenges the foundation of this county's backwards and outdated beliefs — the very fact that we are willing, as a nation, to limit what an individual, specifically, a woman's decisions with what she wants do to her own body even if it means them harm just to hold up centuries-old ideals, because what, we want to feel righteous and good people? This kind of shit is barbaric and has no place in the current state of the world. The ending was very powerful. The gymnasium scene where sunshine could be herself: free from the shackles of the patriarchy, is something that brought tears to my eyes. However, I feel like final final scene was unnecessary, it could have ended with the ""gets ko na"" scene.Jesus, Pilipinas. Do fucking better. Protect your citizens.

Sunshine,"Gets ko si Sunshine.This film really captures me the most. As a woman who grew up in a most conservative country and a religious family, I feel the comfort of the movie. I know that tackling this kind of topic would raise brows to the people especially the one who’s spirituality believes that a women shouldn’t undergo abortion even if she really didn’t want to bear the child. Actually, it’s even funnier that this country preach that abortion should ban but the truth is there is a lack of education about sex, abortion, and contraceptives. Additionally, it’s so hypocrisy and misogynistic that people really blame woman for getting pregnant but NOT THE MAN?! In fact, they are the ones who put babies inside the woman’s womb. I really learned so many lessons in the movie which open my mind to the struggles of a woman. It’s disappointing that people keep preaching what’s right or wrong but THEY NEVER HELP AND UNDERSTAND THESE WOMEN. The movie open my mind that abortion SHOULD BE LEGALIZE. Abortion ISN’T a sin, murder, nor crime. IT’S A HEALTH CARE. It’s NOT selfish. It’s okay.But it is just sad that the Philippines is not yet ready to understand and tackle this kind of topic. I get Sunshine. The guilt-tripping, shame, and misogyny are tackled in a best possible way to give the viewers assurance and comfort. Also, it gives reminder that Filipinos should really open their minds and change their mindset. Women didn’t deserve the shame, the hate, and mostly the expectations that have been throwing to them just because THEY ARE WOMEN. For fucking sake. WOMEN NEED SUPPORT NOT A FUCKING JUDGEMENT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO’S CLAIMING TO BE A SPIRITUALLY ACTIVE BUT CANNOT OPEN THEIR MINDS AND THINK RIGHT.I hope and wish that the government legalize abortion. It is not a shameful thing to do. It is not killing. It is a self-care — A HEALTH CARE. People should know and understand that.Overall, I really love the movie and it will have a special place in my heart. I hope, Filipino directors would produce many movies like this to promote woman and to educate people that abortion is a health care.",2025-11-29,positive,0.996309220790863,-1

Sunshine,"I have so much to say about this movie. Grabe. The story, the cinematography, the acting—everything, just wow. This movie is so impactful, and it felt surreal as it is totally happening in this country right now. Kuhang kuha yung reyalidad sa bawat buhay ng mga Pilipino, sa mga babaeng pinagkaitan ng sariling desisyon sa kanilang sariling mga katawan. As a person who agrees about legalising abortion in this country/pro choice, the religious people who tried to convince Shine and even made her feel guilty about aborting her baby triggered me so much. Dahil lamang sa relihiyosong paniniwala, o konsensya? I get it, it is a sin and it is evil thing to do. But what's more evil is that producing an unwanted child out of guilt into this world. Sunshine wasn't ready to be a mother, she still has dreams to follow, and she has the right to make a decision for her own life, own good, and own satisfaction. Miggy didn't even felt responsible for that child. He only got scared of his pastor father who is also a manipulative religious man. Smh. Men will be a horndog and disappear, yet it's their sperm that made that baby.  Yes, raw sex is pleasuring. But the thought or risk of producing a child habang hindi ka pa handa maging magulang ay dapat lamang na mas nangingibabaw sa kagustuhan mong masatisfy sexually. I hope people are aware of the consequences of their action before doing something because it's a big responsibility.I love this movie so much. Grabe kuhang kuha lahat, mga kaganapan sa maynila, mga black market, mga bawat sulok o tindahan sa quiapo, mga taong hindi nauubusan ng pag asa mabuhay sa kabila ng kahirapan ng buhay, mga batang kalye na nangangarap, at ang mga kinabukasan na naghihintay para sa kanila.I had goosebumps about Annika's representation in the movie. I thought she was the younger Sunshine  I just realized that she's the child that shine could've had. Now I know why she always appears around her, and make her feel guilty, and understood her in the end.I love this movie so much! I hope this will be an eye opener to those imbecile peeps lol, and ofc the government. Abortion should be legal, especially if it'll be processed by the law too. Irresponsible people should not be punished by forcing them to keep the child. Because only the child will suffer throughout their lives. There are for sure a lot of an unwanted pregnancies situation, not only by not using condom but could be also by a failed contraceptives, or lack of knowledge about the reproductive system. Restricting abortion doesn't really promote responsibility—it just punished people for circumstances that are often beyond their control, and women will always be left with no choice but to abort an unwanted child in a harmful way.",2025-11-29,positive,0.9943006038665771,-1

Sunshine,"From the very beginning, the film doesn’t sugarcoat anything. It throws you straight into the raw, unfiltered reality of the city. You feel the noise, the chaos, the sense of being overwhelmed, like you’re standing right in the middle of it all.Pero beyond the city’s noise, Sunshine digs into something heavier. It shows the weight of Sunshine’s struggle, the clash between personal pain, religious expectations, and society’s harsh judgment. The movie doesn’t shy away from the reality na hanggang ngayon, ang hirap mag-access ng abortion services sa Pilipinas dahil illegal pa rin ito. It captures how isolating it is to face a problem this heavy, and how hard it is to seek help in a system that refuses to understand.Overall, I like it.",2025-11-29,positive,0.9943833351135254,1

Sunshine,"A young aspiring teenage Filipino gymnast who everyone looks up to has been selected in the National team to participate in Olympics. Her nightmare begins when she finds out she is pregnant. Her boyfriend wants her to abort. Her best friend disowns her. She hallucinates a small girl chasing her around trying to make her feel guilty. Desperate to pursue her gymnastics career, she buys a product from the local black market. She rents a room in a shady inn, inserts the product and ends up bleeding profusely. She wakes up in an anti abortion clinic to learn that the fetus is still alive. ‘Sunshine’ plays out like a horror movie as the characters try to come to terms with their reality. The tension, fear and desperation is palpable. Sunshine’s journey from numb helplessness to a woman who wants to pursue her dreams is truly remarkable.Abortion is illegal in the Philippines under all circumstances, including rape, incest, or when the mother's life is at risk. Black markets of abortifacients thrive near places of worship and street side shops. Hospitals refuse admission and doctors perform secret illegal procedures. Antoinette Jadone’s writing and direction is raw and brutal. The narrative is neither preachy nor claims to know a solution to a complex problem that leaves women without agency. It simply critiques the situation and demands that viewers confront it along with women who are left helpless in front of politics and religion. Maris Racal pours her heart into the titular character and you would feel nothing but compassion and empathy for Sunshine Francisco.",2025-11-29,positive,0.9242180585861206,1

It shows the very realities women go through in today’s world.What makes it even bolder is its willingness to be raw, relevant, and unapologetically confrontational in a country where abortion remains illegal.

Sunshine,"Hands down. One of the best filipino films I have ever seen.This deserves more than what I’ll write. More than the stars I’ve given. More than a mere category of ‘favorites’.This is worth talking about. The film I should see when tackling feminism. The film that shows how the Philippines lack support for its beautiful and brave women.Una sa lahat, fuck quiapo air. Quiapo—ang baho, ang sikip, ang init! Pero Quiapo… a place where you’ll find even the tiniest bit of hope, a place where even an ounce of solution can be found, a place where help exists, even if only through a few people.i also loved how fuckass men were portrayed in this movie. walang kwentang jowa, walang kwentang kapatid, walang kwentang tatay, walang kwentang tito, walang kwentang doktor. Tangina ang may kwentang lalaki lang ata rito is yung tricycle driver eh. Tangina ng mga lalaking ganyan. Patriarchy at its finest! Also, fuck women who let themselves be abused by this power. Yes, I’m talking about YOU nanay ni Mary Grace.as it progressed, onti-onti kong nararamdaman yung emotional sincerity ng film. yung dilemmas of decisions ni sunshine and yung heartbreaking truth about Mary Grace’s pregnancy. 13 years old pa lang siya? Yes, 13 years old pa lang siya. The movie refuses to romanticize their situation. instead, it leans into the uncomfortable truths of being a young woman in a society that praises discipline, resilience, and sacrifice yet offers little support when life derails. Director Jadaone shapes the film with a raw, documentary-like honesty: tight shots of silent breakdowns, stripped-down scenes with no dramatic score, and a narrative that mirrors the suffocating pressure placed on young Filipinas navigating taboo choices.Lastly, ang nagustuhan ko talaga sa film na to is the fact na the film didn’t fail to show and acknowledge the other women surrounding sunshine. women who, though not always in the spotlight, embody the many forms of pressure, expectation, and silent resilience that shape the world she moves in. they all carry their own versions of sacrifice: women praised for being disciplined, nurturing, and endlessly strong, yet rarely offered the same support they tirelessly give. like seriously? the maternity ward scene broke my heart so much  seeing allthe women sharing the same beds also shows how fucked up our healthcare system really is. Tayo-tayo lang rin nagtutulungan. Tayo lang ang sumusuporta sa isa’t isa. Tayo lang mga babae. Kudos to that tindera. Ironic lang na sa harap pa talaga ng mga rebulto ni santo niño nagtinda ng pampalaglag  these kinds of religious beliefs shouldn’t really hinder us from doing what’s right and best for ourselves. and in showing these women’s quiet struggles, the film expands its emotional weight, reminding us that the story isn’t just about one girl’s burden but about an entire generation of women expected to endure everything while being thanked for it in silence. kulang pa tayo sa pansin, sa pagmamahal, at sa suporta. i hope that someday, all of us can finally feel how to live as a woman and be loved as a woman.",2025-11-29,positive,0.979620635509491,-1

Sunshine,"Rewatched it and still felt underwhelmed. The trailer was so promising and I expected a lot. I’m all for it from what they’re trying to convey but the storytelling wasn’t it. Execution is realistic tho. I believe most of us relates in jeepney scene when you’re in the verge of breaking down and you don’t know what to do but to breathe slowly and comfort yourself, hoping no one would notice. Love the irony, the symbolism, and the heats.But then again, they be trying to highlight everything all at once but failed to deliver why we’re here in the first place. It was moving, as a woman. BUT AS A WOMAN I was hoping for a more impactful message since it opened a lot of discourse. Women are far more complex and I was looking for chaos in what a woman feels in a society where everyone are so entitled to decide on how a woman should act and carry themselves. The movie could’ve gone deeper, one that touches diff range of emotions. It just doesn’t feel genuine, yk.Overall, Im giving it 4 stars.

If they talk about it to an adult, they will likely get shamed for feeling that way when it happens. If they're going to keep abortion illegal, at least educate people properly to prevent it from happening, especially the guys, they should have consequences too.

Sunshine,"Kudos to Direk Tonet, Maris Racal, and the whole team responsible for creating this film, thank you for being brave and casting a light on our nation’s issues often overlooked in fear of the cultural taboo it carries. I would have rated it 5 stars, but the choice to represent Sunshine’s internal conflict with herself through a hallucinated child character doesn’t sit right with me. Jadaone’s direction results in jarring tonal shifts that muddle the film’s emotional center. What was perhaps intended as a bold attempt at cinematic expression to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour. It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility. In fact, by personifying an unborn child as a character which speaks and thinks, then Sunshine unintentionally reinforces the very moral framing that anti-abortion rhetoric thrives on. It circles back into the age-old “when does life begin?” debate—a question that continues to paralyze policymaking in the country, even when the conversation should be about autonomy, access, and proper healthcare. The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, frames it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics. Though, I will still give my flowers to this movie. It helped brought upon a conversation in our country long overdue and for that I am grateful. I hope it inspires other filmmakers to be bold in the face of a country that chooses to be blind to issues that continue to grow with no solutions in sight.",2025-11-28,positive,0.7868162393569946,1

Some people are not fit to be a mother.4. Rape-related pregnancies should at the very very least be allowed to have abortion. Just imagine the trauma they're going through.5.

Sunshine,"people often judge teenage pregnancy as the result of “giving in to temptation,” but this film shows the other side—not all teenage pregnancies are wanted or chosen. what i love about the film is how powerful it is; it resonates deeply with viewers and delivers a clear message consistently from start to finish.maraming sunshine sa lipunan—na biglaan, takot, at walang lakas ng loob na harapin ang pagiging ina—pero hindi ito usapin na masama ng tao si sunshine kaagad nang dahil lamang sa hindi pa siya handa. a moment of temptation is not enough reason to demand she accept her situation, as forcing a woman into parenthood before she is ready is a far greater mistake.i hope this film opens more eyes and highlights the need to strengthen reproductive rights in our country, recognizing that abortion is a right for all women. men who cause pregnancies rarely face the same scrutiny or shame; women, on the other hand, bear society’s judgment alone.abortion is not always chosen for pleasure—often it is the result of abuse or exploitation.it is heartbreaking that in the philippines, a case of violence against women is reported every 57 minutes. globally, over 30% of women—more than 737 million—experience abuse from partners or non-partners. many feel trapped, unable to leave because they are pregnant and have no right to terminate.in february 2024, save the children urged stronger reproductive rights in the philippines, noting that 35% of filipino girls under 15 became pregnant from 2021 to 2022—clear victims of abuse and exploitation. this is a critical issue that the government must address.women have the right to control their own bodies and make their own choices—regardless of religion, culture, or social pressure. they are often the most vulnerable and left behind in such situations.thank you to sunshine for her courage in standing up for herself and pursuing her dreams, and thank you to the film for portraying these realities.as i read somewhere, “marami ang hindi mapapatawad si sunshine dahil sa ginawa niya, pero sapat naman nang napatawad ni sunshine ang sarili niya.”",2025-11-29,positive,0.8094590902328491,-1

Sunshine,"lahat ng tao ay may sariling ingay na tinatahak. sa pelikula, hindi lang ito ingay ng traffic o tambutso. ito yung ingay ng moralidad, ng tsismis, ng relihiyong mabilis magturo pero mabagal magmahal. ito yung ingay ng mga taong hindi naman mabubuhay sa katawan mo pero sila ang pinakamalakas magdikta kung ano ang dapat mong maramdaman, gawin, at piliin. at sa lahat ng ito, isang nineteen-year-old girl ang pasan ang mundo—a girl who should’ve been allowed to dream freely, pero sinasakal na ng lipunang takot sa kababaihang may sariling isip.isang bagay na ramdam mo agad sa pelikula: magkakampi ang mga babae. halos lahat ng karakter ay babae, at karamihan sa kanila may dalang munting piraso ng simpatya. isang kolektibong danas. isang unspoken sisterhood built on the multiple burdens that women carry: being caregivers, dreamers, breadwinners, shock absorbers of society’s cruelty. pero hindi rin romantisado ang pelikula—may mga babaeng kakampi, at may mga babaeng hindi. katulad ng doktor na ultraconservative, na nagpapaalala sa atin ng painful truth: hindi lahat ng babae ay mapagpalaya, at hindi lahat ng babae ay kakampi sa kapwa babae. minsan, ang mismong sistemang umaapi ay umiiral din sa mga babaeng natutong ipasa-pasa ang sakit.pinaka-mahalaga sa lahat: hindi totoong pagiging makasarili ang pagdedesisyon ng babae para sa sarili niyang katawan. kung may isang “gets ko na” moment ang sunshine, ito ‘yon. kung sarili lang niya ang iniisip niya, wala sana tayong ganitong pelikula. wala sana tayong ganitong lalim. pero ang totoo, bawat desisyon niya ay puno ng takot, pagmamahal, at pag-asa—lahat ng bagay na kinalimutan ng lipunan kapag babae ang may kailangan pumili.dito rin pumapasok ang simbolismo ng batang babae—ang unborn child, ang personified conscience. ariana is 13 y/o's own past self, her own fear, her own what-if. lahat ng interaction nila ay nangyayari “sa loob,” sa pinakatahimik na sulok ng isip ng babaeng hinahati ng daigdig. at nung ending, it’s for herself. the hug is acceptance. ang yakap na iyon ay tahimik na paglaya.pero kahit sa mundong pilit nagpapatahimik sa kababaihan, may irony na hindi kayang itago ang pelikula: sa isang konserbatibong lipunan, ang nagbebenta ng religious figures ay siya ring nagbebenta ng abortion pill. ang ob ay bigot. ang bahay ay hindi laging ligtas. ang simbahan ay humuhusga. at ang babae? wala man lang tunay na espasyo para huminga. bakit ang mga lalaki, may opsyon? bakit ang kababaihan, pilit pinapapili pero hindi ginagawaran ng tunay na choice?dito nagiging mas malakas si sunshine. hindi siya martyr. hindi siya sainted victim. she doesn’t just endure—she decides. she chooses herself kahit alam niyang bawat galaw niya may kasamang kurot ng panibagong judgment. she’s not fearless, but she moves anyway. at minsan, iyon na ang pinaka-matapang na pwedeng gawin ng babae sa bansang sobrang hilig kontrolin ang katawan at kinabukasan niya. dedma sa ingay. dedma sa prejudice. kung may pangarap ka, hawakan mo, kahit pa buong mundo pa ang naka abang na magkamali ka. ang sabi ni direk jadaone, ang pagbubuntis ay magbabago sa katawan ni sunshine, sa career niya, sa buong trajectory niya bilang atleta. at totoo—para kay sunshine, ang pregnancy ay literal career suicide. at dito umaalingawngaw ang tanong na gusto talagang ipukpok ng pelikula: bakit ba laging kababaihan ang kinakailangang magsakripisyo ng pangarap? bakit ang freedom ng babae ay laging conditional?kaya oo—decriminalize abortion. kasi ang autonomy ay hindi dapat ipinaglalaban, dapat innate. ang katawan ng babae ay hindi battleground para sa moralidad ng iba.in the end, sunshine reminds you that sometimes the bravest thing a girl can do is to choose herself, quietly, consistently, even when the world says she shouldn’t.",2025-11-29,positive,0.8195306658744812,14

Really, this movie is so heavy for me—not in a negative way you know.

A woman always left thorn between keeping her dreams or to be a mother, samantalang ‘yung nakabuntis, tangina, sasabihin hindi pa siya handa at sustento na lang ambag? Tangina. Every woman have the right to say na hindi rin siya handa sa ganitong mga circumstances. It’s her life.I hope it becomes an eye opener for every Filipino.

Sunshine,"‘yong pangarap ko, kung ano'ng pangarap niya. ⋆˚࿔Especially in the Philippines, society is stacked against women. From secretive clinic visits to hushed conversations with unsympathetic adults— with Sunshine’s journey, you can feel the judgement of a society that constantly polices women’s bodies and their choices. Patriarchy is relentless : they leave it up to the women to pick up the pieces that the men shattered— ""Bahala ka na diyan, just get rid of it"". Maris Racal’s performance was exquisite, ramdam mo yung pagod, sakit, and overwhelming suffocation that Sunshine faces as she navigates through making a choice that is supposed to be hers and hers alone. Every flip, every landing, every stretch was a step towards her dreams— the stage, the recognition, the life she has ever envisioned for so long. Sunshine’s journey is not just about survival; it’s about the courage to continue dreaming in a world determined to limit her. Gymnastics wasn’t more than a sport, it was her identity, her sanctuary, the place that gave her hope to keep believing. At the end, pinili niya pangarap niya, despite the fear, the sadness, and the guilt, her decision was a refusal to let anyone dictate her future, to let her stop that dream.",2025-11-29,positive,0.9149873852729797,3

Ewan ko, ang hirap manganak, ang hirap maging nanay, at ang hirap ng estado ng healthcare sa Pilipinas. Bukod pa roon, nandoon yung bigat tsaka ingay sa kabuuan ng palabas.

Sunshine,"First of all, I know that this movie premiered at the 49th Toronto International Film Festival in 2024 and arrived in Philippine cinemas 4 months ago. And now that it finally dropped on Netflix… I hope I’m not too late to say it finally: This movie is powerful Antoinette Jadaone delivers one of her most fearless films yet with ‘’ — a coming-of-age sports drama that hits with quiet power and emotional honesty.Maris Racal plays the titular character, a young gymnast on the road to the Olympics. Her world revolves around discipline, repetition, and the dream of making it to the competition she’s trained her whole life for. But when she discovers she’s pregnant, her perfectly controlled world cracks open.What I loved about the film is how it never sensationalizes her situation. Sunshine’s fear is treated with quiet realism. The movie acknowledges how complicated teenage pregnancy is, especially in a society where abortion, reproductive rights, and bodily autonomy remain heavily stigmatized and often misunderstood.These themes are controversial. And yes, the movie will divide people. But ‘’ refuses to look away from the truth:         .    ,  .Maris is phenomenal here. She carries the entire emotional weight of the story with a performance that feels painfully real. She rarely breaks down on screen, but you think her internal collapse in the smallest expressions — the breath she holds, the way she avoids eye contact, the way she pushes her dream forward while everything else is falling apart.         .The supporting cast — particularly Jennica Garcia, Meryll Soriano, Rhed Bustamante, and Xyriel Manabat — also elevate the film, each representing a different kind of pressure or support Sunshine faces. And yeah, some male characters in the movie definitely got what they deserved. Jadaone’s direction is quiet, patient, and uncomfortably close — exactly how it should be. The movie lets us follow Sunshine’s anxiety and feel the suffocating pressure she’s under.One of the film’s boldest artistic choices is the recurring appearance of a mysterious girl who seems to follow Sunshine. At first it’s confusing, then a bit eerie, then surprisingly emotional. I won’t spoil anything, but when the film finally reveals who she represents… . It’s symbolic, heartbreaking, and adds a deeper emotional layer to Sunshine’s arc.Beyond the gymnastics, beyond the controversy, Sunshine is really about choice — and how young women often aren’t given the space to empower themselves to make their own choices.The movie conveys important messages: your body is your own; silence can mask the deepest struggles; the pressure to be perfect is harmful; pursuing dreams matters, but so is ensuring one's survival; kindness fosters safety, while judgment breeds fear; and young women need safe spaces. The movie doesn’t push a specific viewpoint — it drives for humanity.Overall, ‘’ is brave, heartbreaking, and painfully relevant. It does not shout — it whispers truths that hit even harder. Indeed, it’s a film that mirrors reality for many young women today, and one that our society needs to see, even if the conversations it starts are uncomfortable.With that being said, I’m going to give this movie…9/10!

I'm also glad na this movie became mainstream kasi it makes us think and talk. I never realized I hadn’t fully understood my stance on abortion until I watched this film.Other comments: - Feel ko lang ang daming hindi naconsider/napakita sa film like how athletes should also be public figures (atleast on my POV, if athlete ka, medyo known ka talaga sa public --- especially if marami ka panalo). So iniisip ko lang how Sunshine could roam freely nang walang nakakakita sa kanya. hahaha - Feel ko may iiimprove pa yung plot ni Rhed.

Sunshine,"Where Filipino films trend to historic dramas and at times big explosive bursts of emotion, Sunshine reflects the good and the ugly of Filipino society in the modern times. It is within the same type as the classics like Maynila sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag, but where it could've easily just copied that same old formula of poverty, crime, and the ugliness that lies beneath the city, the film chooses to explore controversial topics at its heart and anchors it toward really good character dynamics, not to mention where other films center around a male character from the rural side or from the slums, we instead focus on a lady who is faced with a great moral dilemma (in the Filipino perspective, you'll get it) when her dreams are on the verge of being stripped away from her. While watching, I sometimes forget that it is a Filipino film (not to sound derogatory or self-hating btw) because it strays away from tired old cliches other Filipino films do, and while the blueprints of those tropes are present, they are presented in a light that feels more subdued than its usual contemporaries. Also, I do love how the film does respect the audience in choosing not to explain certain things, letting us fill in the gaps.It's a great watch, in my opinion. And I feel that this film should be at the helm of some sort of renaissance for Philippine cinema, where we aren't afraid to speak out and be bold while also making great art out of it.",2025-11-29,positive,0.9952247142791748,1

Some experience it as the consequences of their actions, but this movie also gives up a glimpse of those who are oppressed and have nowhere to go.

Sunshine,"this film stayed with me. raw, quiet, tapang na hindi sumisigaw pero tumatagos.unang-una: Maris Racal. hindi lang nag-portray — she became Sunshine. yung pagod, yung takot, yung pagka-desperate pero umaasa pa rin… ramdam mo hanggang buto. this is the face of so many young women na araw-araw lumalaban in a country that tells them what to be, what to do, and what to carry.ang ganda ng pagkakahuli sa Manila — yung sikip, yung init, yung ingay, pati yung bigat na hindi mo maipaliwanag. hindi siya romanticized; totoo lang. yung Quiapo scenes? sobrang accurate na parang naamoy mo na yung alinsangan at dasal at pag-asa ng mga taong dumadaan dito para humanap ng solusyon sa problema na hindi sila binibigyan ng choice.and that’s the heart of the film: choice. or the lack of it. bilang kababaihan, ang hirap pag-usapan ng reproductive rights dito sa Pilipinas kasi every conversation is haunted by guilt, religion, and judgment. pero Sunshine manages to hold that tension — yung guilt, yung fear, yung what-if — without punishing the woman at the center of it.this isn’t just a film — it’s a mirror. it asks questions na hindi madali, and refuses to hold your hand para bigyan ka ng sagot. it lets you sit with discomfort. it lets you ask yourself: kung hindi ikaw ang nasa sitwasyon, bakit ikaw ang magdedesisyon?",2025-11-29,positive,0.9468302130699158,-1
Sunshine,"What will you do if your dream is at stake because of one mistake?Sunshine delivers a powerful message about reproductive rights and the need for access to safe and legal abortion.The film shows the current state of healthcare in the Philippines and how this basic necessity has become inaccessible, especially to those living below the poverty line.I like how the film does not romanticize the societal issue of unwanted pregnancy. Instead, it highlights how stigma deeply affects women’s decision-making about their own bodies. It shows how the main character struggles with an internal conflict and debates with her own conscience.While the film clearly presents why abortion should be legalized and recognized as part of healthcare in the Philippines, it also portrays how religion and health often clash. It is true that our country is still in the process of accepting that abortion is a right that should be available to all women.Some might argue that safe sex is the only way to avoid these situations, but we cannot ignore the fact that many women experience sexual abuse, rape, or non-consensual ejaculation during intercourse.Sunshine is not just a film that explains why safe abortion should be legalized; it calls our attention to consider the issue without guilt-tripping women through religion or societal pressure.Women should have the freedom to decide what to do with their own bodies. Marriage or co-parenting should not be treated as a band-aid solution to a lifelong responsibility. These solutions do not apply to everyone, especially to those who do not have the means to support a child.I know we all have different perspectives on this issue, but thinking long-term about the future of our children depends on how ready we truly are to take on this responsibility.",2025-11-28,positive,0.9596962332725525,1

Sunshine,"Love how the film depicts the harsh reality of what women have to go through just to be able to decide for themselves and their BODIES!! This movie really goes to show how making abortion illegal makes it so much harder and dangerous for women. It does not sanctify the value of life since in the first place the life of the woman is endangered. Moreover, I love how Manila gets depicted in this light, it shows the good and bad that comes with the city. It is bad for obvious reasons, the normalized chaos that is happening around it, how every night Sunshine is there, a mayhem ensues. However, I appreciate how Manila became a sanctuary place for her, where we can see how despite the chaos that happens every night, there are bits of humanity that saves her. The girl dun sa hotel, yung tricycle driver, and the 13-year-old girl that she met.Furthermore, I would like to commend the addition of having childrens act as her conscience or the ""what if child of hers"". It's a great addition because we can see how in the beginning of the film the girl was literally shouting ""murderer"" over and over again because in her perspective, her mother is harming her. But in the end when she said ""gets ko na"", it became a cathartic scene as it finally hits us that it isn't about being irresponsible and selfish ---- rather it is something more than that. The whole line of the girl saying to her friend Ariana that her dream is the same as Sunshine's is a great addition because I think it rings true with reality. As every now and then, when a child hears about the dreams of their parents and how they had to stop it to take care of their children, especially when it comes to Mothers, the child often feels bad and just wished that thier Mom was able to live out their dream first.Lastly, I love the relationship of sunshine and her older sister, the fact that never once pinagalitan o diniktahan ng ate nya sa kung paano nya haharapin yung sitwasyon niya goes to show how much she trusts and love Sunshine. I also love the contrast that all throughout the film there were different sides of the story whether labelling her as a ""murderer"" o miggy telling her to do what you got to do that once you reached the end scene when her sister just told her ""kahit ano maging desisyon mo kampi lang ako sayo"" made it soo impactful. Kase in the end yun lang naman ang kailangan niyang marinig, we have seen her face through that circumstance alone with nothing but her conscience, that the moment na sinabi sa kanya yun, it became a relief to her as well as allowed her to finally tell someone or at least cried it out to them na natatakot din siya kase nga bata din siyaa and hindi pa siya ready maging nanay. All in all, the film was a 10 out of 10, and I appreciate how the film wasn't all in the face about what you should believe in and what you shouldn't. It just presents Sunshine's story and her decision which should be acknowledged because hindi dapat humantong sa isang sitwasyon na mas uunahin pa ng isang doktor ang kaniyang lisensya kesa sa buhay ng isang tao dahil lang ""nagpalaglag"" siya. If you really value life in its essence then we should also acknowledge the life of the person carrying the baby so bakit niyo papabayaan lang na mamatay yung batang 13-year-old???????? so in conclusion:TANGINAA NG MGA LALAKETANGINA MO MIGGYTANGINA NUNG DOKTORATANGINA NUNG LALAKING DOKTORTANGINA NUNG TITO TANGNIA NUNG WALANG KWENTANG NANAY (?) - di nya deserve matawag na nanay",2025-11-28,positive,0.9942731261253357,9

How many more women will go through what sunshine went through? Women should not be forced into motherhood because not all of us are made to be a mother.

Napaisil ako, if ever sa friend ko mangyayari yung ganitong bagay, I know for sure na hindi ako maghehesitate to help her. I almost cried sa part ni Rhed, grabe talaga. Napakairesponsable nung parents n'ya, and to think na 13 years old pa lang s'ya. Sobrang nakakapanlumo dahil nangyayare talaga 'to sa totoong buhay. Medyo nadamihan lang ako sa part andaming mura (siguro ginawa 'yun para mas magmukhang natural? Pero somehow medyo na oa-han ako) Also, ginawang tao si anika and aryunuh with feelings and such, and pinakita pa dun na parang gustong mabuhay ni Aryunuh, wala parang medyo contradicting lang yung part na yun, I think unnecessary na 'yung character ni Aryunuh since nagbigay life lang 'to sa fetus sa tiyan ni Rhed. I like the ending, akala ko nung una hindi matutuloy dahil nga sa sistema dito sa PH. Add ko na din, bakit ba kasi hindi nagk-condom si Elijah Canlas hahahah. Overall, magagaling ang cast.

Sunshine,"Holy shit, this film had me in tears. Not only is it extremely well made, the cinematography and the characters were so raw that it had me stressing over them. I have never rooted for anyone so much to get rid of that damn baby. The movie also shows the darkest sides of the healthcare system in the Philippines, religion, and most of all, fucking men. It is unfortunate that us Filipina women have it the fucking worst. Not only are we in a third world country where it is illegal to abort, but we are guilt tripped over and over again by society to not choose ourselves. We are literal machines for them to procreate and forget ourselves in the process. We are not human to them.Right from the get-go it is shown how unprepared (who I assumed is 20) 20 year old Sunshine is. Even when she is cleaning up her sister’s child, she raises her hand as if to scare the child, when the child clearly does not understand this gesture. The men in this film are shown to be no help at all, may it be sibling, the boyfriend, the men in the streets, every. single. man. The concept of birthing a child will never be their problem, it will never even cross their minds. I love how realistic the scenes were when all the pregnant were all together, aiding each other and comforting each other; that is the harsh truth— men will never know the connection us women have with one another. Even if they are strangers.Rhed (Mary Grace) is the exact reason why abortion should be legalized in the Philippines. Young women subject themselves to improper medical procedures because that’s all they have access to (and hardly)— they do not know the severity of what their bodies will go through. In the first place, sex education is still frowned upon in the Philippines. God, I really hate, HATE how religion proves time and time again that they are the main reason why we cannot progress as a society. This film is beautifully filmed, I loved every bit of it. My heart sank deeper whenever she struggles, but the weight lifts whenever she chooses herself. Ladies, please choose yourself, above everyone else.",2025-11-28,positive,0.8957067131996155,-1

Gets na gets ko—and I hope many more people will get it, too. This film struck a deep chord with me. Nearly every scene felt like it could happen in real life—and in many cases, it truly does.Abortion is treated like a sin in this godforsaken conservative and dominantly Catholic country. Many people disagree, but it really doesn’t matter whether you agree or not. In the end, the decision should be up to the woman who’s pregnant. We shouldn’t have an opinion—just understanding is enough. After all, it's her body, her life, her future, her choice. That's why I'll always firmly believe that abortion should be legal and safe. There are women—and even girls—who are far too young, forced into pregnancy, still unstable, still trying to build their own lives, and completely unprepared to raise a child while chasing their dreams. Abortion is healthcare, and access to it is a basic reproductive right.This film captures that reality so loudly. It’s loud with the streets of Manila, with people’s judgment, with hypocrisy. You can hear it all so clearly—the way society pushes women toward unreliable and dangerous methods like pamparegla in Quiapo or hilot, simply because abortion is condemned and proper reproductive healthcare is lacking. It’s so fucked up and heartbreaking. Tangina, ang hirap-hirap maging babae sa bansang ’to—sa mundong ’to.'Yung scene na walang filter na ipinakita ang estado ng public hospitals—mga serbisyong galing sa buwis ng tao pero hindi nila kayang ayusin—sobrang sakit panoorin. Sobrang bulok ng sistema natin. And there’s probably something even worse behind it—we are so fucked.So when Sunshine finally went through with the abortion, I felt relieved. For a moment, I was scared she might keep the baby. Bringing a child into the world when you’re not ready—and being forced to give up your own dreams because of it—is one of the most cruel things you can do to yourself and to that child. And that’s exactly why choice matters.Gets ko na.",2025-11-28,positive,0.9214392900466919,53

Sunshine,"Gets.I was gonna leave it there but I have thoughts so full steam ahead—Manila is a staple in almost every Filipino film, being the capital and all, but rather than the large city itself— Sunshine specifically captures the essence of Quiapo so well. The bustling markets, the overcrowd and kids begging for alms, and religion is embedded everywhere— whether it be its churches, the posters within the buildings, street stalls selling rebultos and rosaries, or the people themselves. I don't usually care for the setting of the story but I always think it's smart when it actually helps drive the narrative forward, so I find this neat little aspect of the film amusing (also, while we're at it, props to whoever the prod designer is wow). I watched this at 3AM during a vigil so I had all the time to read other reviews and can I just say, while I understand how it could be viewed as such— I don't think this film was didactic or propaganda. I love films that open conversations and Sunshine opened a lot, but more than the conversations it opened, I love how the center of it has always been women. The heart of Sunshine is Sunshine herself, and Maris Racal definitely gave the performance of a lifetime in this one. The fact that she filmed this the same time as Can't Buy Me Love is insane, talk about range.Also, props to Direk Tonet 'cause I have only watched this film a day before, but it is so dear to my heart.

To bravely put it out on Philippine media is a start of a more aware perspective. The cinematography and script are well combined and well thought of. The metaphors hit the spot and Maris' performance not only represented a lot of young girls out there, but also those who are mentally struggling. Seeing someone doing everything alone and bear the burden of something that isn't normative is heartbreaking. Children must not be guilt tripped into doing things just to survive.

FUCK YOU BOBOT!! now lets talk about the people who supported sunshine along the way, starting with her sister. Honestly, with how close they were i was really surprised that sunshine never told her. all of their scenes were just so heart warming and it really just felt so comforting. i feel like she was someone that sunshine really needed at the time and yknow those words probably meant so much to sunshine. i got a little teary eyed during that scene cuz it was just so next, the doctora. notice how it was a woman who risked her lisence and did everything to save the pregnant girl? yeah, thats what i call girlhood  but yeah, i was just so happy that someone, an actual stranger, reached out a helping hand. even though she had very little screentime, i really enjoyed her character and it really just showed that there are still some good people out there.moving on, we have the pregnant girl. her hug with sunshine absolutely made me cry. idk, maybe seeing someone going through the same things as her just brought some comfort like atleast theyre both in this together. her almost dying made me feel something, it was either goosebumps or just deadass misery.. i guess a HM would be the coach. (no i am not mentioning the kid cry about it )overall, this was such a beautiful movie. i felt everything and it just captured the life of a filipina so well. just shows how much one person could be going through and how much a woman has to do to simply get rid of her baby. def watch this if you have time!!",2025-11-28,positive,0.994734525680542,-1

Sunshine,"this was so realistic. and also so realistic in showing how fucked up the system in our country really is.people say things like ""paano kung 'yan yung maging susunod na president?"", ""paano kung 'yan yung makahanap ng cure sa ganito gan'yan?"" when talking about a fetus that might be aborted, when those questions should honestly be applied more about kids who were forced to live a messed up system that was also because of adults, just like yung kay mary grace. her case happens a lot in real life. many children as young as 13 are forced to be pregnant and become mothers. like imagine, a 13 year old?? that's a kid. anddd hindi ko rin talaga magegets (and never will, honestly) yung mga tao na hindi pro-choice who doesn't care if pregnancy happened because of rape. tangina niyo. another thing, dahil nga illegal pa ang abortion in the philippines, a lot of kababaihan would resort to ""pangpa-regla"" and other unsafe procedures para lang makapag-abort. if the healthcare system truly cares about the people, why prioritize the ""life"" of a fetus, imbis na sa taong buhay and humihinga na? bakit kailangan pa silang maghirap? and i like annika's character here also symbolizing sunshine's guilt. kahit na parang desidido na talaga si sunshine noong una pa na she wouldn't keep the baby, there still lingers a feeling of guilt inside her, yunv parehong religious and personal guilt. and yung sa last part, her saying na ""gets ko na""... ay, putangina, i love it.i really hope this movie would serve as an eye opener sa bansang 'to rsgarding abortion, and i also hope that people become more open-minded. sana maging legal na ang abortion. hay, tangina kayo",2025-11-28,negative,0.5379498600959778,-1
Sunshine,"Gets ko na si Sunshine.Sometimes I fail to remember how Philippines such as other countries, do not have the same privilege as first world countries do. Imagine the first thing someone says to you after you almost die from trying to have an abortion “Say sorry to God, be thankful He is forgiving. Be thankful that your child is still here.” Women shouldn’t have to feel guilt or religious pressure to have a baby they didn’t want. It should always be their choice, their right to their own body. I hope one day that the Philippines legalises abortion, it’s healthcare after all.I’m just so glad she didn’t let go of her dreams. ",2025-11-28,positive,0.9704245328903198,-1

Sa buong panonood ko, nainis ako kay Elijah Canlas, sa nanay ni xyril, kay Piolo Pascual, dun sa nagtitinda ng pampalaglag, dun sa doctor na ayaw mag-admit ng batang naghihingalo dahil gumawa daw ng ilegal (mind you, narape yan kaya sya buntis), at sa ospital na hindi kayang i-cater ang pangangalaga sa mga kababaihan. Sana imbes na ijudge si sunshine sa choices nya, sana namulat tayong lahat na we should be free of our choices. Na hindi tayo selfish dahil lang ayaw natin ng anak. And that we are entitled to be taken care of kahit ano pang desisyon natin when it comes to our pregnancy.

Sunshine,"dream or responsibility?Are you anti- or pro-abortion?As this film is created from a very conservative country—Christian—this is such a hot take, especially for those religious people that were also shown in the film with the use of the OB-GYN. But as someone who's pro abortion, this is a chef's kiss and an overwhelming approach but a nightmare to those who oppose it. Abortion must be legalized now, as there were too many rape victims that couldn't escape from their nightmare but a “blessing in disguise” to be treated by those who never experienced it. Actually I really have so many words to say, but I couldn't write it all down. And let's characterize the characters one by one. Maris' acting never disappointed me; she always proved why she deserved all the fame and recognition she's getting, and as for her character, she is such a loud, bold, and brave woman—deciding all things without further hesitation, though I know it may just seem impulsive, but that's what everyone would do when their only dream is at risk.Jennica's character as a sister was the purest that we all need to have; how I would love to have someone like her by my side for the rest of my life.Elijah and Xyriel's characters were under surveillance by their parents, so they feared whenever they made a single mistake.

Sunshine,"here’s me and my thoughts na hindi organized :pfirst of all, habang pinapanood ko ‘to puro ako “shit” kasi shit, ang ganda t—t gets ko na. every second of this film was worth it huhuhu. ang ganda ng cinematography neto and i don’t know a lot about color grading yet and other stuff related to that pero totoo at sang-ayon ako sa other reviews na kuhang-kuha neto talaga yung feeling ng nasa manila ka. i’ve been studying there for almost three years na and hay, ito talaga yun. ganiyan na ganiyan yun. amoy mo lahat eh, dama mo lahatsecond, grabe mulat naman na ako pero yk that feeling when u read something o watch something na mas lalong nagpapamulat ng mata mo sa mga bagay-bagay XD i’m so happy na hindi nag give up si sunshine sa mga pangarap niya. ayaw niya maging nanay kasi ayaw niya maging nanay and this film reminds us na that’s okay and that should be our choice as women, not someone else’s. not what the world thinks that is better for us. sa atin yun. next, yung mga characters dito ang totoo rin. like how yung isang doctor doon sa isang hospital, kung makapagsalita akala mo hindi doctor e, sana nagmadre nalang siya. tapos yung lalaking doctor, oh god i hate men and that doctors screentime was like 15 seconds pero i’m so pissed off kasi mas mahalaga pa talaga sayo yung kalagayan ng licensya mo kesa doon sa buhay ng pasyente mo? like, hindi ba kaya ka nga nag doctor wth. tapos yung si miggy at yung tatay niya (ang pogi mo piolo) tangina mo miggy HAHAHAHAHA i swear this dude, bagay sa pangalan nya kasi alam niyo yon everyone says na yung mga miguel miggy migs are assholes. i don’t know how else to word this pero yung scene na sinasabi nila na sila na bahala doon sa pagsupport in financial ways tapos nung di tinanggap ni sunshine they made it seem like ungrateful lang siya pero ang hindi kasi nila magets eh ayaw niya nga kasi, kasi ayaw niya. HUHUHU ang ganda talaga. and saludo ako sa mga babae, saludo talaga ako sa mga babae na tumutulong din sa kapwa babae kasi tayo-tayo lang din halos nakakagets ng struggles natin. yung scene sa maternity ward :((((( hay. i also love how yung reaction nung ate nya was js so comforting. normally rin kasi diba sa ibang movies o mapa real life pag buntis yung kapatid mo at an early age, magagalit muna sila bago ka tulungan t—tand last yung line talaga that broke me pero expected ay yung “13 lang siya” HUHUHU I HATE MEN “di ko naman jowa yun eh, tito ko yun”  HAYS. and ofc yung bata dito huhuhu hay. di ko na need i-explain yun . “pangarap ko yung mga pangarap niya”  10/10 movie yesfeeling ko may gusto pa ko sabihin pero balikan ko nlng HAJDJAHAH",2025-12-14,positive,0.9136046171188354,8

Sunshine,"this movie is such an eye-opener.it's exactly what Filipinos need to see right now. It goes deep into things like healthcare, religion, politics, and women's rights. I liked that it was mostly women helping Sunshine out, because who else really knows how that feels? The film totally calls out the hypocrisy of people who judge your life without knowing the massive problems and choices you had to weigh. For me, Annika was like Sunshine's conscience or her unborn child, and all that guilt. She was the one who helped Sunshine process everything, showing that she wasn't completely alone through all of it. And Rhed's storyline makes it clear that abortion is also about healthcare, especially when the victim is a child who hasn't even figured out the real world yet. The movie shows just how impossibly hard it is to raise a child in the Philippines, starting with the hospitals. So many are just not taken care of properly, and it really exposes the corruption and terrible state of our healthcare system. We should have the final say over our own bodies, but we still need to be responsible and aware of the consequences.Fave line: “yung pangarap ko kung ano ang pangarap niya” “gets ko na”",2025-12-13,positive,0.9890676140785217,-1

In a patriarchal, religious, conservative country, you are forced to abide by suffocating norms. Women are expected to embody impossible resilience while being treated with astonishing disregard. Pair that with a failing healthcare system and an absence of political accountability, and you’re essentially set up for downfall.",2025-12-12,negative,0.6015979051589966,1

It shows a teenager’s decision and experiences that turns her into an amazing yet still kinda unlikeable character still, more movies Should be like this, not preachy or having too much messages, show don’t fucking tell.Maria racal is probably my favorite Filipina actress of my generation because holy shit she is so good in this movie her emotions feel so real and the environment included with her acting made it so much better! She deserves Awards! The filmmaking is absolutely beautiful! The writing and screenplay is just pure genius and extremely smart The message of this movie is really controversial especially in southeast Asian countries as abortion is mostly silenced but here it’s not I can’t explain how but it really represents it, watch the movie yourself you’ll know what I mean And I will warn you SA is involved like it made me cry when it was involved that is also a huge problem here in Southeast Asia, Overall this is what Filipino cinema and Asian cinema should strive to be!

Sunshine,"“Kung babae ka sa Pilipinas, minsan pakiramdam mo wala kang pag-aari—kahit mismong katawan mo.”Antoinette Jadaone really did something here. Hindi siya takot.

Kung saan ang boses ng babae laging mas mahina kaysa sa bulong ng mga lalaking may kapangyarihan, Sunshine feels like an act of rebellion pero tahimik at marangal.Sunshine is unapologetically feminist. Hindi siya nage-explain, hindi siya humihingi ng sorry. Ipinapakita lang niya na ganito ang katotohanan. Ganito kahirap maging babae dito. Ganito kalakas ang loob na kailangan mo para pumili para sa sarili mo. Kaya ang sakit. Pero ang ganda. Ang daming babae sa Pilipinas na hindi man aminin pero si Sunshine yung kwento nila. She carries the weight of society’s judgment pero nandun pa rin yung tahimik na desire to choose herself. It forces the viewers to confront something many Filipinos avoid na hindi kasalanan ang magdesisyon para sa sarili mong katawan. Na hindi kabastusan ang pumili ng kinabukasan. Na hindi kababaan ang hindi magpapaalipin sa moralidad na ginawa para kontrolin ang babae.Pero sana dumating ang araw na hindi na kailangan ng tapang para lang maging babae.

To the bravery of every woman in the film mula kay Sunshine hanggang kay Direc, saludo talaga.I really liked how the movie focused on Sunshine’s journey, especially the guilt even when you know you’re choosing what’s better for you. The constant hesitation, the konsensya na kahit hindi ka naman talaga attached sa Catholic beliefs, mararamdaman at mararamdaman mo pa rin kahit sabihin pa ng iba na hindi naman ‘yan totoong tao pa (lowk felt validated w this one talaga as someone na nagkakaroon minsan ng contradicting opinions). It showed the cruel, harsh reality of what so many women are still experiencing, hindi lang sa Pilipinas. i also liked na hindi niya niromanticize ang ending. yes, pinili nila ang path na magbibigay sa kanila ng mas malayang future para makapagpatuloy sa mga pangarap nila, and yeah that’s a factor, but the film never made it the “reward.” It respected the nuance of their decisions, hindi pinilit na gawing moral lesson or success story. Instead, it stayed centered on women’s choices. It lets the audience truly feel the hardship and struggle behind those decisions. Her success wasn’t what validated her, and it shouldn’t be. Even if hindi ipakita yung “would’ve been” life, or the “would’ve been” anak, her choice remains valid because we all have our own pacing, our own rights to our own choices in our own lives :)to a better healthcare, esp reproductive health education and to more ph films that boldly challenge toxic filipino cultural norms :<",2025-12-10,positive,0.9939273595809937,1

Sunshine,"“Labag yan sa batas, lalong lalo nang labag na labag yan sa batas ng Diyos. Magpasalamat ka.”“Salamat po… saan?”It fucking pisses me off, these religious people and their mentality about abortion. Abortion is selfcare, it’s a choice, it’s freedom. But most importantly abortion is for someone who have had an unwanted pregnancy, especially most of the times when it’s teens. Not irresponsible ones but those who’s been raped, sexually assaulted or abused, and those who are too young to understand the concept of creating a baby. Lalo na kung wala pa silang kapasidad bumuo ng pamilya dahil nga sobrang bata pa nila at nabuntis sila ng kung sino, ang worst is relative pa nila. I’m glad mulat si Sunshine sa mga ganitong bagay. This is a sensitive topic, and good for Sunshine that she decided early on that she doesn’t want to be a mother and continue that path, no matter how much some people tried to persuade her and talk about how they can support the baby even if she didn’t want to raise it or for it to be born at all. She have dreams, dreams that are bigger than her and her having a child. Mas matured pa sya mag isip kesa sa ibang matatandang nakapaligid sa kanya. And to think na mas may sense pa yung pagpapa abort nya kesa sa buhayin yung bata because for me personally I viewed it as a trap for women like her. This is not talked about enough here in our country. Abroad, yes most of the countries had legalized abortion but for some reason our country instilled that we are not ready to have this kind of law or legalization. We are so behind and our fuckass mentality most specifically the older generation’s thinking is not ready for this kind of topic. That last scene, gets kita Sunshine. Gets na gets. And I hope more women like me and you get the point of this movie. And miraculously, sana ang mga lalaki din. Women like us are bigger than just having a baby, than just being a mother. Maybe some dreamt of it, but women like us have high hopes for our future and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. Abortion is not bad when women choose themselves and prioritize their own wellbeing. Let that sink in. Papa P jumpscare din pala nagulat ako si Piolo yung tatay ni Miggy hays so gwapo pero I’m sick and tired of fathers (pastor pa sya dito ha) who act and control women to only have a child just because they are financially capable of providing for them.",2025-12-09,positive,0.8732495307922363,2

I wish and pray for anyone who will do it. I hope safe sila and i hope na alam nila n its ok, its not their fault and just like what sunshine’s baby said na naiintindihan nya. I am sure and I promise na Maiintindihan nila un. naiintindihan namin. U cant force urself to be a mother if ure not ready. Being a mother and taking care of a baby is not an easy thing to do. U need to prepare urself physically, mentally, spiritually and financially. Hindi lahat kaya. I love u girls.

Sunshine,"“you were this close”that line became her last straw. dun talaga nag sink in sakanya, would she really let this opportunity pass? an opportunity she worked on for years? because of a mistake? the risk of losing your dream and glory is more frightening than losing a baby, and the film didn’t shy away from showing how brutal that truth can feel.specific segment i loved was when sunshine felt the guilt dawn to her when the girl (i forgot her name ariana ata) tried to abort as well and ended up hospitalized in the process. this wouldnt happen if she never gave that money in the first place. that moment hit hard because it couldve been the turning point, the guilt that forces her to keep the baby, but instead she held her ground. she didn’t cave. she stayed with the choice that everyone wanted to shame her for (looking at u doc).i love that she fought for her chance because this is what all women feel and go through. they fight for the things they deserve. they fight for the life they’ve built with their own hands. and it’s unfortunate, exhausting even, that we do. that we fight. always",2025-12-09,positive,0.8967304229736328,-1

Ang simple niya, pero ang bigat ng truth underneath — yung reality of girls growing up, navigating their bodies, their safety, their choices… all while pretending everything is “normal.”Maybe it’s because of my SRHR work, but the whole time I was watching, I kept thinking, “God, ang dami talagang silent battles ng kababaihan.” The kind people don’t talk about unless they absolutely have to. The film captures that so well — that mix of fear, awkwardness, and quiet resilience you only understand if you’ve seen it up close.Ang galing how something so short can feel so lived-in. Walang arte, walang preachiness, just a slice of life that says, “This happens. This is real.” And that’s what makes it sting a bit more.I finished it and just sat there like, “Yeah… this is exactly why SRHR work matters.”Small stories like this don’t feel small when you know millions of girls live them.",2025-12-08,positive,0.8825584650039673,-1

The plot is so interesting and really hooks you to watch the movie. The whole time I was watching I was so invested. There’s so many layers to the movie and symbolism that makes you really look at the Philippines in a different lens. This movie really stresses the importance of the legalization of abortion in the Philippines and how sexed should be really promoted among the youth. Apart from that, the side plot of the young child really pulls on ur heartstrings. It’s crazy that some of the things happening in the film is a reality faced by some people. I really like how the movie is an open ending which will really make you reflect and think. I think the child that sunshine is always with is her unborn child. It was kind of hinted when she had blood all over her when sunshine was rushed in the hospital. Also sunshine performing at the end shows that she did get that abortion so she can reach her dream.

But, I also believe that a woman should have a freedom to decide for her own body and to pursue her own dreams, rather than to own up a boy's mistake or to follow what the society tells her to do with her own body. Here's the thing, there's been a conflict between Biology & Religion. According to biology a fetus is not considered a human until 16 weeks—which is why abortion is legalized in some countries, but it is only allowed if the embryo is not yet 4 months. Now here's the thing with religious people, it's been said in the commandments that ""murder is a sin"", they believe that fetus are considered human by the time it formed in a woman's body. Which results colliding of each and everyones belief. I believe that they just wanna follow the word of God, but bible is open with variety of interpretations as the books are full of metaphors. It's sad that it came to a point that following a word means controlling womens' body that it came to a point na tinanggalan na nila ng karapatan ang mga kababaihan.

Sunshine,"WHAT A FILM!!!! truly one of the best newly released locals i've watched for a while.Manila is a character in this film. within every scene, the city is brought to life in all its flaws and edges; you can hear the passing train in Avenida's motel, the market-market behind Quiapo church, the sellers you pass by in Recto, and the noise of vehicles mixed with the shouts of barkers in Taft as if you were actually there. it was Manila in its rawest sense. amoy na amoy pati polusyon, 'yung ihing natuyo sa kalsada, 'yung usok na buga ng mga pribadong sasakyan—it was the Manila i've come to love and hate at the same time. even upon watching the simple cutscenes of Maris walking along the streets and the hustle and bustle of the city, i realized just how much Manila's gloried failure makes up so much of our identities as Filipinos. the Quiapo scene, however, will be forever etched into my mind. a prayer is a request in hushed tones. see, there will always be a deep-rooted guilt for every Filipino: guilt for knowing what is deemed wrong yet still holding on to it anyway. guilt for the taught sinners. guilt for asking despite being undeserving. guilt for being just feet away from a dark alley filled with frightened women trying to buy black market abortion pills, speaking in small voices to avoid being snitched and arrested. guilt is embedded in the very existence of the people in a country who grew up in God's favor and the Americans' teachings.but fear will always be greater than guilt. and it's what you feel throughout the film from Sunshine, whose greatest fear is letting go of her dream; for Menggay, whose family was the first person who betrayed her; and for all the women who are going through the exact same thing, yet are forced to risk their lives due to underground procedures.what Sunshine portrays is not the twists and turns that are seen within the storyline, nor are there any secrets revealed; rather what it effectively communicates is the complete and utter isolation that young women feel in a society that continually judges them for their decisions and choices, many of which they were forced to make. the weight of cultural expectations, the heavy grip of religious beliefs through the misinterpretation of the Bible, as well as the stigma associated with women who become pregnant, all come together to create an unbearable burden that is carried by the characters in the film. hindi lang 'to tungkol sa babaeng ayaw magkaanak dahil marami pang pangarap. tungkol 'to sa lahat ng babaeng hindi handa, hindi kaya, at ayaw na.",2025-12-08,positive,0.9929531216621399,-1

Kailangan namin harapin ang repercussion ng tinatawag nilang motherhood? Hindi ako against sa beauty na nakikita ng karamihan sa konsepto ng motherhood pero kung titingnan sa pisikal na aspeto talo ang babae. Mag dudusa ang pisikal appearance nila habang at pagkatapos magbuntis, isama mo pa ang PTSD. Hindi lang natatapos doon, kasama rin ang aspetong pang lipunan. Aminin man o hindi, kadalasang kailangang isuko ng mga babae ang pangarap nila or career para sa konsepto ng motherhood. Nagiging kabawasan ito sa mga babae samantalang sa mga kalalakihan ito ay makakadadag sa konsepto nilang, what does it mean to be a man.

Mapapa-aral ba ako?exactly. mapapa-aral ba nila? if not, then why bother? a life of a child is indeed precious. but it is only precious if they get to live. honestly, not having access to safe and legalized abortion is a one-way ticket to poverty, high risks of women getting unsafe medications and treatments, and overall normalizing misogyny. this is why the country remains unprogressive. they run back to familiarity and hide behind religion they do not practice at all when confronted with logic and truth. longtermism? no, they perform. they play saint.",2025-12-08,positive,0.8197741508483887,-1
Sunshine,"BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN THIS DECEMBER. Grabe kuhang kuha ng film na to yung reality ng Teenage Pregnancy at yung mga paghihirap na nararamdam nila, ni Sunshine. Like yung feeling palang ng buntis ka pero ayaw mo at lahat ng tao pati ang gobyerno ayaw ang aborsiyon dahil ""illegal"" daw. Pero hindi nila nakikita yung mga napapagdaanan nila dahil sa isang pagkakamali. I LOVE how they used a character as an unborn child/conscience grabe yung simbolismo at anlaki ng impact ng character ni Annika. THIS LINE STILL HITS ME ""ang pangarap ko ay kung ano ang pangarap niya"" at yung simplent ""naintindihan kita"" where sunshine felt accepted is so heartwarming. Grabe kuhang kuha talaga nila yung totoong Manila, yung ingay pati na rin yung kalagayan ng lipunan like doon sa hospital scene at yung financial status ni Sunshine. Gustong gusto ko yung ending kasi napapaisip ka kung pina-abort ni Sunshine or hindi. Pero nung na gets ko na parang it hits me the way na naintindihan ko lalo yung meaning nung movie at ano yung gusto niyang iparating sa mga tao. NO DOUBT 5/5 FOR ME kasi it depicts a reality where not all the people realize and understand, lalo na yung mga kabataan na hindi nakakaranas ng teenage pregnancy. Grabe rin yung acting ni Maris dito na bigay niya ng hustisya yung role niya. Very natural lang talaga kasi grabe kitang kita yung emotion ni Sunshine. ANG GANDA rin ng cinematography netong film na to, kuhang kuha niya yung ingay ng manila kaya nga diba ""depict the noise"" ARGHHH I LOVE.

Sunshine,"A very daring yet relevant attempt to uncover issues with female body autonomy/consent in a country that still basically gets run by patriarchal beliefs, only beautifully packaged in outdated notions of religious obedience.Time and time again, napakahirap ipatindi sa mga tao (perhaps even more so sa mga lalaki) ang konsepto ng body autonomy ng mga babae. Ang konsepto ng 'choice'. Ang karapatang pumili para sa sarili. Minsan--o madalas kung magiging totoo lang naman tayo, iyung ganitong outdated na pag-iisip ay mapapansin mo sa mga regular na pakikipag-usap. Maliit at 'fleeting' remarks, pero nandoon. May bigat. Kailangan mo lang talagang makinig. Kadalasan siguro sa mga kaibigan mong lalaki na tingin mo mabuti naman talagang tao. O kaya worse, sa ibang mga kakilala mo ring babae. You feel conflicted kung ica-call out mo ba sila at i-risk na masabihang masyado kang 'woke' o hahayaan mo nalang na ganiyan ang way ng pag-iisip na niya habang buhay. Ideally, alam mo iyung tamang gawin. Realistically, maghe-hesitate ka pa rin. Tutal, tao ka lang naman.Naipakita ng pelikula iyung struggle, even iyung kaba. Iyung pagiging high-stakes ng pangyayari. Dinala tayo ng kwento even sa inner monologue ni Shine, sa pamamagitan ng karakter na bata na palaging sumusulpot kapag napapa-isip siya. One thing is for sure, unang-una palang, alam at kita mo na kay Shine kung ano ang desisiyon niya: Ayaw niya. That's it. The only thing na nagpahirap pa sa mahirap na niyang sitwasyon ay ang kawalan ng kakayahang pumili. Therefore resorting to downright dangerous means. Nakita rin natin na lumipas man ang oras, iisa at iisa pa rin ang desisyon niya. Meaning, hindi nagbago. Kung mayroon lang sanang available at safe--recognized na way para matulungan ang mga kababaihan sa mga ganitong sitwasyon hindi ba? Naiyak ako sa ending ng pelikula. Naroon iyung catharsis ni Shine. Iyung pagbitaw niya sa 'guilt'.Ang pagpapatawad sa sarili. Ang pagpili sa sarili. Dahil ang pagiging babae ay hindi dapat isang parusa.",2025-12-08,negative,0.620336651802063,3

Sunshine,"Naiintindihan mo ba 'ko?Gets ko na. Gets ko na. Sunshine (2024) Directed by Antoinette JadaoneRating: 10 / 10 | MasterpieceMay kakaibang katotohanan ang obrang ito na bihirang makita sa pelikulang Pilipino. Hindi ito nagsusumikap para maging isang maganda o maging patok sa takilya; sa halip, pinipili nitong maging isang mensaheng magulo, maingay, nakakainis, at hindi nakakakomportable sa ordinaryong manonood. Na tulad na lamang ng buhay ng kababaihang araw-araw na nilalamon ng patriyarka at sistemang pampolitika na matagal nang bulok ngunit nananatiling banal sa mata ng nakararami. Habang nanonood ako, hindi ko naramdaman na gusto akong aliwin ng pelikula; ramdam ko na gusto akong iharap sa katotohanang matagal nating tinatakasan. Propaganda ang tingin ng iilang sarado ang isip sa pinaka-mensahe ng pelikulang ito. At doon sila nagkakamali. Isa lamang itong salamin sa kung paanong sistematikong inaalisan ng kapangyarihan ang mga babae, lalo na ang mahihirap.Sa loob ng sistemang ito, ang reproduktibong karapatan ay hindi itinuturing na karapatan, kundi kasalanan. Tahasang pumapanig ito sa kababaihan, hindi dahil sa moralidad, kundi dahil sa realidad: may mga babaeng nabubuntis hindi dahil pinili nila, kundi dahil pinili sila ng karahasang hindi nila hiningi. At sa bansang tulad ng Pilipinas—kung saan ang simbahan ay laging mas malakas kaysa sa pagkakaroon ng sentido kumon—ang buntis na biktima ay mas madaling husgahan kaysa sa irresponsableng partner o manggagahasang ama o kapamilya. Sa pelikula, hindi ginawang melodrama ang talakayan ng rape at incest; hindi ito ipinakita para lang sa shock value. Bagkus, ipinakita itong ordinaryong trauma, tila bahagi ng tahimik na kultura ng pamilyang mas pinahahalagahan ang so-called ""delikadeza” kaysa sa hustisya. Mas pinahahalagahan ang pangalan kaysa kaligtasan. Hindi exaggerated ang ganitong representasyon; nakakatakot dahil alam nating totoo.Naging sentro rin sa pelikula ang kabiguan ng sistemang pangkalusugan. Hindi lamang ito inefficient; ito ay moralistic, judgmental, at nakaprograma para parusahan ang mahihirap at mahihina. Ang ospital dito ay hindi naging tahanan ng lunas, kundi naging lungga ng "" pagiging moral"" na kung saan ang mahihirap ay hindi tinutulungan, kundi hinuhusagan. Sino ang karapat-dapat mabuhay? Sino ang dapat magdusa para masabing matuto? Bilang manonood at kahit isang mg lalake sa bansang ito, nakakagigil ang katotohanang ang pagpunta sa ospital ay hindi palaging pagsalba sa sarili kundi pagpasok sa isang tribunal kung saan ikaw, na biktima, ang dapat magpaliwanag.At dito ko mas naranasan ang kakapalan ng pelikula sa pagrepresenta sa Maynila. Hindi ito glamorized poverty porn; hindi rin romanticized chaos. Ito ang Maynilang nakakapagod kahit tumingin ka lang: ingay ng mga lasinggero sa tabi, tunog ng tren na daraan sa tapat ng bahay mo, sermon ng mga matatanda na “mabait ang Diyos, anak, humingi ka ng kapatawaean.” Ito ang lungsod kung saan ang relihiyon ay sobrang pinapalandakan sa bawat isa, kung saan ang pagiging babae ay isang pampublikong dominyo, at kung saan ang morality policing ay kasing regular ng traffic dito. Para sa marami, nakaka-stress panoorin; para sa iba, nakaka-Filipino. Sa akin, nakaka-trigger dahil ito ang araw-araw na karahasan na hindi natin laging tinatawag na karahasan. Nakakasakit na sa mismong kapwa babae pa nanggagaling ang mga karahasan nito laban sa kanila. Sa gitna ng lahat ng ito, si Maris Racal ang pinakanagbuhat ng pelikula. Totoo, marami na siyang napatunayan bilang artista, pero dito naging malinaw na hindi lang siya artista. Mas higit pa siya roon. Hindi niya ginawang martir o heroine ang karakter niya; inangkin niya ang pagiging imperfect, resentful, selfish kung kinakailangan ng kaniyang Sunshine. At sa kulturang pinapaboran ang babaeng martir na tahimik na lumulunok ng sakit, ang pagganap niya ay isang uri ng pag-aalsa. Hindi siya nagtatangkang humingi ng awa, pinapakita niya na kahit sobrang sakit na, sobrang nakakapagod na, kaya ito. Kaya niya. Kakayanin niya laban sa mga putanginang lalaking nagpapahirap, hindi lang sa kaniya, kundi pati sa kaniyang kapuwa. Kung may direktor na may kakayahang magbitiw ng ganitong pahayag, si Antoinette Jadaone lang iyon. Ang direksyon niya ay hindi preachy, hindi sentimental, hindi deperado para maging tawagin ng ilan na isang woke film. May talim ang mga metapora niya, pero lubog na lubog sa reyalidad. Ito ay pang-araw-araw na simbolismo ng mga babaeng kailangang lumaban ang sarili para mabuhay. Katulad ng mga tauhan ni Jennica Garcia, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, Meryll Soriano, Rhed Bustamante, at Angeli Bayani.Walang mali sa pelikula. Ito ang reyalidad. Sa kung sino ang maaapektuhan at tututol, isa na kayo sa problema. Hindi babae ang problema. Ang problema ay lipunang gumagamit at dumidikta sa kanila.• Resonance / Impact:      • Cinematography / Visuals:     • Acting / Performance:     • Direction:     • Soundtrack / Score:     • Plot / Storytelling:     Final Rating:     ",2025-12-07,positive,0.8992036581039429,-1

Bawal isave kahit agaw buhay na kasi illegal? Kailan naging illegal ang pagsagip sa iba, kung ang mga nakakulong nga tinutulungan? I love how they added the kids. Sunshine's treatment towards her shows enough how she's not ready to be a mother. Miggys such an ass. Given his remarks pa? Sunshine trusted him. Sobrang sakit din nung sa batang babae na abused. Walang choice, walang pera kaya halos buong buhay ang kapalit. Fucked up pa pamilya. It's scary to think na it's someone's reality. I hope to have a better system in the future.

It was so raw and sad to watch, seeing her struggling so hard to get rid of it just to make sure she can continue with her dream yung kay mary grace rin, sobrang sakit panoorin. puno ako ng lungkot at galit nun pinapanood ko siya. the fact na nangyayari talaga ito sa mga kababaihan sa pilipinas na walang safe na options, walang legal protection, at walang sistema na naniniwalang deserve nila ng proper care. sobrang nakaka galit. ansakit na di exaggerated yung scene na yon to prove a point kasi it really does happen in real life and reality is really that cruelit pains me that women in our country are pushed into dangerous, improper, and illegal methods para lang may control sila sa kanilang mga katawan. again, sa kanilang katawan, na dapat talagang sila yung may say at control dun. ansaket na kinailangan nilang harapin yung trauma, judgement, physical pain, at emotional isolation dahil di legalized at walang safe abortion sa pinas. no man, no government, no religion, and no stranger should have the right to dictate kung ano dapat gawin ng mga babae sa kanilang mga katawanang galing galing mo direk tonet for having the courage to open eyes of the filipinos, and to maris grabe ang galing mo. thank you for delivering a raw and impactful performanceat gaya ng sinabi ng character ni annika na ""gets ko na,"" sana ma gets na ren ng iba soon",2025-12-07,positive,0.6515607237815857,2

Sunshine,"tangina (don’t say bad words! eme) ang gandahaven’t watched a pinoy film worthy of a perfect rating for a while now and direk tonet had to do something. where do i even start?beginning to end, i was just sat and hooked. i wasn’t even able to finish drinking my matcha while watching. pacing is perfect in my opinion. things became more interesting when the girl appeared. but honestly, there’s a sequence before that which i think is very clever — when sunshine rode a jeepney, she was searching for abortion methods and there’s a warning not to get anything from quiapo and she asked the driver to drop her off “kahit saan” and following up with “hanggang sa dulo” or “kung hanggang saan to” (anywhere along those lines). she was then dropped off at quiapo lmao. ff to the girl’s appearance, bruh i got goosebumps! the first encounter was so unsettling, that i got a feel of how sunshine felt as she started navigating that conundrum. i realized as well that the kid is the apparition of sunshine’s “would’ve been” child, and that concept is nothing less than brilliant. it brings us through the agonizing dilemma of a woman bearing an unwanted pregnancy and having everything on the line. another child was introduced later on, named ariana. ariana, a gay child, appeared after sunshine’s encounter with mary grace, a 13-year old pregnant girl. ariana mysteriously disappeared when mary grace suffered miscarriage after her attempt to get an abortion from a sketchy lady. that further inferred that these child characters who came out of the blue are symbolisms of the unborn. the penultimate scene where sunshine was practicing her routine, and the girl was watching with a smile on her face, is profoundly beautiful and gut-wrenching at the same time. going a few sequences back to the part when ariana disappeared, the girl was furious at sunshine for enabling mary grace to get an abortion. but in the penultimate scene, she looked at sunshine with pride, clapped for her, and ran to her. when sunshine asked, “naiintindihan mo na ba?” the girl answered, “gets ko na. gets ko na.” BRUHHHH i swear i ugly cried so much. what a way to conclude the girl’s mysterious role and sunshine’s resolution in the story’s conflict.i could go on and on about the things i liked about the movie but this review would end up as a narration and analysis of the entire thing so i’ll wrap it up here.",2025-12-07,positive,0.989971399307251,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is a film that sheds light on the harsh realities many women face—realities that are often overlooked or silenced. It’s an eye-opening story that refuses to sugarcoat the truth; instead, it boldly exposes how flawed our system can be. I firmly stand with Sunshine—respectfully, no one, no law, and no religion should ever dictate what a woman chooses to do with her own body.One of the most powerful moments is the ending, with her unborn child’s quiet assurance, “Gets ko na.” That single line hits deeply. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the smallest gestures carry the heaviest weight. I’m grateful the film allowed Sunshine to choose herself.Overall, this movie touched every bit of my soul—I had goosebumps the entire time. Sunshine isn’t just a film; it’s an experience you feel in your chest, something too deep to put into words.Shine, gets na gets kita. ",2025-12-07,positive,0.9879740476608276,1

Sana imbes na ijudge si sunshine sa choices nya, sana namulat tayong lahat na we should be free of our choices. Na hindi tayo selfish dahil lang ayaw natin ng anak. And that we are entitled to be taken care of kahit ano pang desisyon natin when it comes to our pregnancy. Sobrang lupit ng mundo natin, na patuloy na nagtataas ng kilay kapag tungkol sa usapang sex pero wala ring ginagawang hakbang kapag nagkakaroon ng unwanted pregnancy ang mga kababaihan.

Sunshine,"marami akong nabasang theories na si Anika raw yung unborn child ni Sunshine. Pero sa interpretation ko, Anika represents Sunshine’s younger self, the child she used to be...nandoon s'ya sa mga moments na lost si Sunshine, parang comforting presence The film isn’t about Sunshine being pregnant at a young age. Instead, it serves as an eye-opener to the difficult realities in the Philippines, youth forced into responsibilities too early, lack of guidance, and the fear and shame surrounding conversations about teen pregnancy and reproductive health, like, the need for safe, accessible, free reproductive care. Hindi ito tungkol sa pag-encourage ng abortion, but about recognizing that young girls deserve proper education, protection, and safe options. Walang kabataan ang dapat mapahamak dahil sa kakulangan ng tamang impormasyon(edit)Omg, bigla ko lang narealize after everything: nung nakilala ni Anika si Arianna, tapos bigla siyang nawala nung nag-success yung abortion ni Rhed Bustamante… doon ko na nakita yung deeper symbolism. Arianna disappeared the moment the abortion succeeded. Si Anika pala yung magiging anak sana ni Sunshine. The kids represent the unborn child. GETS KO NA",2025-11-28,negative,0.6327915787696838,-1

Sunshine,"i wish for a world where women everywhere are able to have full autonomy over their bodies. one takeaway i got from Sunshine is how unlucky we are as women, and as filipinos, that abortion is still not a legal procedure. there are teen pregnancies in the Philippines that never get reported, especially when the abuser is a family member, something Sunshine portrayed painfully well.because that's what Sunshine is! it tackles harsh truths and realities of what it is like to be a woman (or a girl) in our predominantly conservative country. you can even say that Sunshine has highlighted the ugly parts of the Philippines’ healthcare system. nakakalungkot that the average Filipino has a slim chance to experience high quality healthcare, because good service is often times a luxury—bawal sa mahihirap.i will admit that it's my bad that i often overlook the Filipino movie industry, but this movie allowed for more appreciation. it had brilliant direction and i was sincerely moved by how grounded it felt.i also really loved that Sunshine had a strong support system, her sister. i'm a little sensitive when it comes to siblings, and Jennica Garcia has reminded me of my own sisters. they're sisters who would stand by me in the same way. from my observation, Geleen has gone through a similar path, which is why she stands strongly beside Sunshine.gets na gets kita",2025-11-28,positive,0.9891195297241211,-1

While, gusto kong sabihin na lahat ng films niya maganda (kasi bias ako), this has got to be my favorite.I knew this would be a difficult film to watch personally because of my opposing beliefs, but I’m so glad I still did. Sobrang importante ng mga ganitong pelikula. Films that would make you reflect on your values, remember similar scenarios that evoked the same sentiment, or spark a different approach and a deeper kind of empathy for those going through the same plight.Madami akong babaeng kapamilya na Sunshine, Ate, Thea, Dr. Helena, even yung nanay ni Ariana.As a film watcher na plot driven ang hanap most of the time, I did not expect this to be see through/transparent. Gets mo na agad eh.Ang ganda.Ang sakit.Sa mundong masahol, thank you for Direk Tonet and Maris for giving your all for this movie. ",2025-11-28,positive,0.9807321429252625,8

That kind of situation is the hardest thing to navigate, and the movie didn't shy away from the awkward silences or yung masakit na feeling of having to draw a boundary. Ang ganda.And honestly, this was Maris Racal’s redemption arc, full stop. After all the ridiculous media noise trying to shame her for just being ""normal"" or ""too real,"" this performance was her ultimate, quiet clapback. She showed up as this fully nuanced, complicated character, delivering every fragile, quiet moment with such authenticity. Hindi niya kailangang mag-effort or mag-glam up; she just let us breathe with her.

Sunshine,"First of all, Maris Racal is honestly such an amazing actress. Like, she carried every emotion so freaking well! tThe desperation, the frustration, the confusion, the helplessness... you really feel everything she’s going through. And yeah, even with her recent scandal (which I’m not even getting into lol), you cannot deny how talented she is. The girl can ACT, period.Second, this movie really shows the reality for so many Filipino women. It’s wild how we’re constantly being robbed of our choices. Religion getting shoved down our throats every five seconds, the government acting like women’s health isn’t even part of their job. Sometimes it really feels like the PH is just… anti-women. And it’s honestly so frustrating. I just hope things change soon, because it’s not about religion or “morals” all the time. It’s about actually having the choice, the chance to do what’s right and do it safely. Not end up risking your life because you had no real options.This is lowkey turning into a whole debate, but whatever. I really hope this movie opens people’s eyes. Though let’s be real, some folks will still twist the message or straight up miss the point… or maybe they’re just stupid af.

EVERYTHING was genuinely perfect for me idc.this is something that the majority of the philippines can’t stomach watching and that’s probably partly why i feel glad that it was still publicized / made into a film in the first place. some scenes made me cry so much and i guess it mostly stems from the feeling of finally seeing something of this caliber be embedded in filipino film and showing the culture of our country as accurately as possible. it’s cathartic to watch something good especially when it feels like home.trust that this movie has engraved itself in the corners of both my mind and heart.",2025-11-28,positive,0.9979019165039062,-1

Sunshine,"Entry #2, less of a movie review and more of a rambling on how this movie helped trigger a reflection on how I process my own emotions as a woman haha.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Sidenote, but there's something abt Sunshine's self-restraint that makes me want to cry.When she finally confronts Miggy, she doesn't start beating him up or screaming at him. Instead, she simply says that she's pregnant, as if she should be ashamed that she needs to talk to Miggy about it.And you can see why, the moment her frustrations start bubbling up, Miggy tells her to calm down. Miggy even leaves before he gets a full taste of her wrath.Oh my god. It reassured me so much that people who hold themselves back during confrontation aren't any less brave, or deep, or strong. It's just that we've been societally conditioned to always be the better person. Always consider the emotions of the person you're talking to.And maybe, much like Sunshine, I know it's a hopeless cause.It echoes how I've dealt with family and situations I've felt misunderstood by. Why communicate with someone who can't be communicated with? Why escalate the situation? Why be vulnerable with someone who doesn't know how to handle it? Yung nasa debate team ako, at ang hahaba haba ng letterdbox reviews ko, pero kunting sigaw lang sa akin natatameme na ako. It's especially disappointing when you've already communicated with them in the past and they don't change. Sabay na sa sakit ng concern mo yung kahihiyan ng pag-express mo ng damdamin sa wala. Sabay na yung disappointment na hindi humihigit pag-ibig nila sa bad habits nila. (LUH, SAAN YON NANGGALING COUGH COUGH)And what's left is I leave those situations much like Sunshine, with so many unsaid words and emotions bubbling underneath the surface that I want to smash someone's car. Even my unsaid thoughts get clouded by me almost instinctually trying to put myself in the other person's shoes, or trying to understand where I went wrong and how to do better next time. Then suddenly, even in the privacy of my own headspace, I can't process my own emotions. Suddenly, even long after the moment has passed, I feel less whole and less human.I was raised to never raise my voice. And I have a subtle respect yet envy for women who do. A small, conservative part of my brain goes, ""You know we're not allowed to shout, right? Why can't you be the better person?""But maybe it IS possible to strike a balance between communicating your concerns with someone and still being sensitive with their emotions.Maybe it's not such a hopeless cause.",2025-11-28,positive,0.8666384816169739,1

A reminder that a woman is never selfish for choosing herself, and will never be selfish for choosing herself. Because at the very beginning, her life starts with a choice — and that choice is her.I hope more people watch and reflect on this film, because it shows how the Philippines continues to move backwards when it comes to reproductive health. How many Filipinos still choose to remain blindsided, choosing stigma over understanding, especially on abortion “in the name of religion.” How a patriarchal society still insists on having the final say over a woman’s body — when in truth, they NEVER SHOULD HAVE in the first place. My body, my rules, ika nga.Oh, Sunshine… you may be the first, but I hope you will not be the last. DECRIMINALIZED ABORTION NOW!!!!Direk Tonet, what a film. And Maris??? HANDS. DOWN. BOOTS. MAMA. You gave 10s in the trailer, but after watching? 11s na talaga.Philippine cinema is not dead, guys. It was never dead to begin with. We just kept turning a blind eye and pretending it was.

A perf film that powerfully portrays how abortion is viewed as a serious crime and sin in a deeply religious country like the Philippines, where women, the ones who bear the physical and emotional burden (fuck men!!!) are pushed into life-altering decisions that can change their entire future.

Kasi the whole movie, we saw and witness sunshine's dream and struggles trying to abort the child. The ""gets ko na"" is one of the scene na 'di ko makalimutan. Kasi nung sinabi niya 'yon, we also did—na-gets na rin natin.the implied abortion was symbolic for me kasi aside from sunshine reaching her dreams (to compete), it also shows the contrast of her (sunshine) experience to Rhed's. Kasi deba, Rhed's abortion experience was done illegaly, while hers was a second try pero done by an actual professional. it is implied, but it shows the two endings of getting an abortion. Na kaya naman pala sa maayos at ligtas na paaran para mag pa-abort. This is the result if abortion is legalized here in the Philippines.

Sunshine,"“drown out the noise.” but for sunshine, the noise is impossible to silence. and perhaps that’s the point !!sunshine drops you right into the chaos of manila’s slums—the blaring streets, the pollution you can taste, the constant fight to find your place in a city that refuses to make space for you. it’s loud, messy, heavy, and honestly, so beautifully shot it almost hurts. the film doesn’t sugarcoat what it means to grow up on the poor side of the metro. instead, it immerses you right into the confusion, the grit, and the impossibility of finding your way through everything that tries to block your path.also, one thing that dir. jadaone nails is the film’s cinematography. the visuals don’t just accompany the story—they carry its heartbeat. the way the camera moves, the grime-colored palette, etc.. it all builds an atmosphere that makes you feel like you’re right there with sunshine, breathing the same heavy air. but here’s where my frustration kicks in: sometimes it felt like it was the coach who dreamed of the olympics more than sunshine herself. it is as if her ambitions weren’t fully her own. and then there’s this big question: how is sunshine on her way to becoming an olympian when no one seems to recognize her outside? no hype, no chatter, no community buzz ??? who is she really in the world beyond ??? the film teases her potential but never quite anchors her identity in reality. the movie also strongly exposes how messed up the ph public health system is. watching the overcrowded hospital and the beds practically stacked on top of each other, is just infuriating. women deserve comfort, yet the film shows how even those basic things become luxuries.though, what kept my heart in the film was ate geleen. i hope every sunshine out there has someone like her !!!!! someone steady, warm, and willing to hold space when everything else is collapsing. and on the opposite end of the spectrum: miggy  i hope every miggy rots in hell. women deserve better than being tossed out of the bus like a trash.

Yet we turn a blind eye, because the word “abortion” still sparks shame and judgment — ironically, in a country that lacks basic reproductive healthcare.lastly, putangina nyong mga lalaki kayo.",2025-11-27,negative,0.6630120277404785,-1

Sunshine,"After watching the film (thrice this year), it has become clear that such issues are far more complex than simply being immoral, illegal, or against certain religious beliefs. Some beliefs are held as non-negotiable, no matter how liberal or progressive the world becomes. But the reality for women like Sunshine is that restrictive laws can make life dangerous.Morality, legality, and lived experience are not the same. Laws may make something illegal, but they don’t erase the underlying reality or the demand for care and safety. Sunshine’s story embodies this tension. She had access to a supportive family and a thriving career as gymnast, yet the illegality of abortion forced her into danger. Clearly, a systemic failure.People will always find ways to survive, and without proper regulation, it becomes deadly. The existence of quack clinics, “hilots,” and underground networks is proof of systemic neglect, not moral failure of individuals.I hope many legislators, lawmakers, leaders, or whatever we call them, see this film.",2025-11-27,positive,0.8756769895553589,1

Dare I say the most important film of our generation? And Maris holy shit, that was one of the best performances I’ve seen in the last ten years. Raw, terrifying, and painfully real.I know I’ll never fully understand the complexities of what women go through, and that’s exactly why films like Sunshine hit this hard. They ground us in stories that have always existed, stories that deserve to be acknowledged, stories that some films, especially in the Philippines, hesitate to touch.Sunshine doesn’t just tell a story, it makes you feel it in your chest. It sits with you, heavy and unshakeable. And maybe that’s the point, to leave you changed, even just a little, and to make sure these truths are never brushed aside again. And if cinema has any purpose at all, it's to let us feel the world through someone else's skin, even for just a moment.Philippine healthcare is genuinely fucked. We’ve talked about it for years, we scream it straight into their faces, and still, nothing changes. But good fucking god, when will this finally get better?

Sunshine,"this film felt like getting hit in the chest and then hugged after. sunshine isn’t just a story, it’s a mirror held up to every girl who grew up being told to keep quiet, to behave, to carry consequences that were never ours alone. i swear i felt my throat close up in half the scenes.there’s this painfully ironic moment that won’t leave my brain. sellers of ab0rtifacients literally standing in front of the church like it’s just another day. the hypocrisy is crazy. the shame is pushed on women but the system keeps handing out the same cycles on the sidewalk. the film knew exactly what it was doing there.and maris racal . . . oh my god. she didn’t act like sunshine, she was sunshine. the fear in her eyes, the softness, the way she held her sadness like it might spill. she carried the whole emotional weight of the story so naturally it hurt. this is one of her strongest performances and you can fight me on that.what hit me the most is how the movie never backed down from the truth. that women’s bodies are theirs and they are the ones to decide what to do with it. full stop. no guilt, no shame, just autonomy in its rawest form.sunshine is the kind of film that stays in your chest long after the credits end. it’s heavy but it’s also hope. a reminder that girls like sunshine deserve softness, choices, and safety. always.",2025-11-27,positive,0.9870124459266663,-1

Yung pagod. Yung takot. Yung guilt na hindi naman dapat sa’yo ibinibigay. Yung simpleng hiling na kung ano ang sa akin, akin pa rin dapat ang huling salita.And when Sunshine finally chooses herself — hindi bilang martyr, hindi bilang symbol — kundi bilang isang babae na may karapatang mahalin ang sarili niyang buhay at ang kanyang pangarap na maging gymnast. Grabe. Para akong sinampal nang may lambing.This film isn’t about abortion alone.It’s about agency, dignity, and the quiet power of choosing herself and her aspirations.Antoinette Jadaone gave us a story that doesn’t just ask for empathy — it demands respect for the lives women build, unbuild, and choose.",2025-11-27,positive,0.8043205142021179,-1

Gawin na sana itong isang emergency at medical para na rin sa kaligtasan ng mga babaeng nais pang mabuhay ng malaya. Hindi na dapat tayo mabuhay sa nakasanayan. Kailangan na nating mamulat sa reyalidad na umuusad ang mundo at hindi na sapat ang pagiging makadiyos mo upang maging malaya ka. Mahal kita, Sunshine. Gets ko na.

Sunshine,"one word, powerfullakas ng mensahe ng pelikula nito. it was raw, authentic, and it was worth the wait. even as a man of this patriarchal society, the feeling that the movie left me with was like a scar. context palang, nakikita natin kung gaano kalubha ung sistema natin dito sa Pilipinas. kahit ilang bills pa yan ang naipasa, di parin mawawala ang traditional views natin dahil sa influence ng catholic church. at pati nga ba naman sa sarili natin komunidad, mahirap ito pag-usapan and that’s fucked up. sobrang gold ung acting dito ni Maris Racal, it felt like she was made for that role. i also like that small detail of her ribbon being called as baby. when she performs with it, she was free. away from the problems and away from reality. other actors such as si Annika Co was also great, left with that last scene of the line “Gets mo ba?”. it was at that moment that her character knew why she had to do it. although the ending was for the viewers to interpret, we can already by that scene that she did aborted it.AND GOD THE CINEMATOGRAPHY! sobrang naappreciate ko kung paano ipinakita ang Manila. parang di ka makakahinga sa choice of compositions nila. especially the set designs of the Maternity Ward and Sunshine’s House, it speaks a lot on the character’s lifestyle and what could be the reality for the struggling women out there especially in the Philippines.to conclude my not so “performative” but appreciation on the film. Sunshine left me with lesson to pause, to reflect, and to understand. with this film, this could change how our people would see abortion to some deeper context :)",2025-11-27,positive,0.9717877507209778,8

Tangina niyong lahat.The movie was so powerful and was delivered and portrayed beautifully by Miss Ma'am Maris Racal, sobrang galing umarte, kuhang kuha niya ang puso ko bilang Sunshine. Sana sa palabas na 'to ay mamulat ang mata ng gobyerno at ng sistema to how much and to what extent a woman is willing to do, even at the risk of her own safety, for something she truly doesn't want. Sana sa palabas na 'to, magalit ang mga tao sa sistema na patuloy pinagtutulakan sa'tin mga babae. What if siya ang makakadiscover ng cure ng cancer? Well, fuck you. What if hampasin kita ng bote sa ulo? Sana patuloy tayong magalit at ipaglaban ang mga sarili natin sa mga idelohiya na dinidiin sa'tin, all while completely disregarding our opinions and beliefs. Sana magets niyo na rin.Sobrang galing, direk, and Miss Maris Racal. :( To have this film in this time and age shows na this is a movement and patuloy dapat nating nilalaban para maiwasan ang mga nangyari kila Sunshine.

Sobrang tagal na since umiyak ako sa isang local film (well, I don't really watch a lot, but I'll catch up, pramis ) Maybe the reason why I got so emotional is that I think I already met a Sunshine in my exposure to hospital. Makikita mo yun sa mata nila, that aggravating emptiness that lingers. I am an empath for women like Sunshine and Menggay — is it really justifiable that the corrupt system continues to villainize them despite the much bigger concerns like child neglect and abuse which were very well presented in the film?

Sunshine,"‎A woman is more than a mother and a wife. A woman can have a life, passion and dreams other than giving birth and creating a family. A woman can desire a life of her own without a child in the picture. She has a brain, a heart, and a soul that can yearn for a greater life; she is more than just her womb. And that is fine, if a woman decides to prioritize her own ambitions instead of being chained to traditional norms, then so be it— it's her life. ‎‎We should never push our own values and ideals to someone that is living their own life. If they're not ready for a child, they aren't. A living and breathing woman's choice should speak louder than an unborn, lifeless fetus. Even if their decision is against our principle, at the end of the day, it is healthier to have them choose than seeing them losing it all together. ‎‎Women are already suffering from a lot of judgement, abuse and maltreatment on the daily; the least we need is people dictating our choices and deciding our own lives for us—Let alone having people that know nothing about a woman's body making the rules.‎‎Napaka-imposible mabuhay nang madali bilang babae sa mundong ating ginagalawan ngayon. Ang natatanging tulong na p’wede nating gawin ay ang pagbuo ng ligtas at payapang komunidad para sa ating mga kababaihan.",2025-11-27,positive,0.8878008127212524,3

The absence of support for abortion is front and centre throughout. And Maris Racal BRUHHHHHHH just astounding asf. Her despair and desperation were palpable…such an impressive, intense performance, definitely a career milestone for her! Not to mention how beautifully shot this film was OMG, the colours were so lush. It captured Manila’s imperfections and rough edges so well, and Sunshine’s kindness and determination to find a solution became this quiet metaphor for sunlight breaking through the darkest of places.

Sunshine,"i originally planned to watch this last july but sadly, i had no time to… that’s why when i learned it’d be coming to netflix, i was so fucking happy! i’m glad it didn’t take too long for the film to be digitally streamed after its release here in the ph theaters, but now that i have finished watching it and learning how truly great this film was, i regret not being able to experience watching it in a theater with fellow friends and women…this is exactly how films should spark conversations, and i’m genuinely thankful this exists and will continue to reach a wider audience. this film is brave, raw, and honestly courageous in the way it speaks for women and directly to society. it rawly and flawlessly tackles teenage pregnancy, abortion, and religious guilt without sugarcoating anything. this is one of those films that women will understand on a deeper level, especially filipino women, because it reflects lived realities we rarely see shown this honestly. so huge respect and thanks to ms. antoinette jadaone for creating this masterpiece.the way society treats women here is so unfair, and the film doesn’t shy away from showing that; it was unapologetically real. it’s honestly exhausting how women are judged before they’re even heard, and this film finally pushes back against that! and at its core, it reminds everyone of something so simple but often ignored: women are people first. so it also hurt to watch how much empathy only came from fellow women—doctors, mothers, strangers—women who just ‘knew.’ those scenes in the maternity ward especially, where women help and understand each other without needing explanations, were deeply emotional… i also loved how realistically they showed manila; it’s always busy and full of (ordinary) people, it’s messy, and you would always see the traffic and the smoke and hear how loud the sounds of vehicles are. the cinematography and score were also beautiful, especially during sunshine’s performances, where you can feel her focus and desperation all at once. and maris racal, the actress i never once doubted, delivered a raw, natural, and phenomenal performance as sunshine; she did a very great job bringing this powerful story to life. i just hope more people watch it, talk about it, and sit with the discomfort it brings, because that’s where real understanding truly starts.",2025-11-26,positive,0.9965866804122925,0

Sunshine,"Sobrang hirap maging babae. Lalo na, maging Pilipinong babae.Sunshine is by far my favorite Filipino movie. The casting is phenomenal—Maris is an incredible actress—and the cinematography perfectly captures what it feels like to live in a third-world country where women’s health is treated as one of the least priorities.Growing up, I always knew how hard it was to bear a child. All three of us siblings were delivered through cesarean section, to the point that my mom was in critical condition. My father had to choose who to save between me and my mama. But even with that knowledge, I never fully understood the depth of how difficult it truly is to be a woman—especially in a predominantly Catholic country where family and faith are held above everything else.Being a woman—a Filipina woman—means constantly choosing between survival and expectation. I think now we are so comfortable discussing how a modern Filipina should break molds and create her own path. There is so much manifestation that now, more than ever, these cages should be dismantled. I don't want to say this, pero hindi pwedeng dahan-dahan tibagin ang problemang kumakahon sa kababaihan, because women should not endure when all their lives they are expected to survive.We honor the Church, follow tradition, and protect the image of being a “good woman,” even when those expectations silently hurt us. Even though I am pro-choice, I still feel slightly uncomfortable talking about abortion (because of how I was raised). And this topic is so important. This topic is so necessary, especially since most of our laws are anchored sa Katolisismo. Maging ang moralidad ng buong bansa ay nakabatay sa kung ano ang turo sa Bibliya. The truth is, women are left with no choice. They have no privilege to say “ayaw ko maging nanay,” which leads them to do “illegal procedures” because, again, women’s health care has long failed us. The very system that is supposed to prepare and free us is the one that is caging us. We shouldn’t just look at this problem from a biblical perspective (notice how Sunshine went to the church after knowing she’s pregnant at 19?), not when the Church itself has been one of the loudest forces shaping the silence around women’s bodies. The problem begins when morality is dictated without considering lived realities—when doctrine is treated as absolute while women bleed, struggle, and navigate dangers that society refuses to acknowledge.And that’s the heartbreaking truth: Judgment is more accessible than proper healthcare. We preach compassion from the pulpit yet withhold it from the very women who need it most. I may not be the most religious person in the room, but I know my God. And He will never let me or anyone suffer from a torture.This is why conversations about reproductive rights are not just political—they’re personal, urgent, and life-changing. When a woman, like Sunshine says “ayaw ko maging nanay,” she’s not being irresponsible. She’s being honest. But in this country, that honesty is treated as immorality. Women are pushed into silence, into shame, and into dangerous choices because the system refuses to give them safe ones. Walang point ang socially established morality mo kung selective lang ang application nito.We owe it to women to dismantle these cages not gently, but urgently. Because for generations, they’ve endured quietly. For generations, they’ve survived what they should never have had to face alone.And maybe that’s why Sunshine hurts so deeply. Because it’s not just a story. It’s a mirror of what we still refuse to fix.",2025-11-26,positive,0.9240537285804749,1

Sunshine,"Direk Tonet Jadaone, come get your Baddie chain!Having lived in the City of Manila during my university days has shown me the city after dark [winks]. Seeing the city through Jadaone's lens takes me back to watching the classics of the '70s and '80s where we see Manila as the place where people begin to reach their dreams. We can see that with Sunshine's rehearsals and training routines in Malate's Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. She has become an Asian Games champion here, and she has started dreaming of becoming an Olympian here. That's Manila, the City of Dreams.But, similar to Bernal's Manila By Night (1980) and Brocka's Maynila sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag (1975), we get to explore the dreadful city in its raw, authentic form. We see this as we walk together with Sunshine through the hazy streets of Downtown Manila during the day and the grimy pillars in Morayta's streets where prostitutes wait for clients at night. The film doesn't tackle these aspects of the city and just shows them as they are through guerrilla-esque filmmaking. It's just enough for the viewers to see the situation Sunshine and other Manileños are in. It might also be that, after decades of instability in the Capital, people already know that Manila is no longer what it used to be, so there's no need to explicitly discredit Manila's reputation anymore.And of course, when a young, unmarried Filipina gets pregnant in a movie, it's obvious that the film will touch on Christianity in the Philippines. We see the Catholic guilt Sunshine faces, the hate-filled Christian love that out-of-touch Filipinos have, and the deeply-ingrained consequences of colonialism to the Philippine society. Unfortunately, this isn't something new. This has been going on for centuries already, and has been a topic in Philippine cinema for decades.However, this film offers a more modern take using a sports drama. Maris Racal delivers what is undoubtedly the best performance by a Filipino actor this year so far. We can feel her desperation to fulfill her lifelong dream as an athlete to reach the Olympics. Whether or not you're someone who is against abortion, you will be forced to empathize with her dilemma because of how compelling she is.What I also like about the movie is it's not just some liberal self-help nonsense that just ""wants to raise awareness"" about an important issue. This film also challenges the worldview of religious conservatives. It will force people to ask themselves questions like:To what extent do women have to be forced to give birth to a child they don't want to have?What if she's a victim of incest?What if she's a rape victim?What if a pregnancy puts her life at risk?What if she can't afford to give a decent life for her child?What if she's not yet ready to be a parent?What if she simply doesn't want to be a mother?And, in the end, the film stands firm on what it believes in. It's so rare to see a Filipino movie be so unapologetic in its message and still get this much traction. I hope this opens the door for more movies that will boldly discuss controversial issues head-on because that's what we need.This film is outstanding, a real body of work. This cements my view of Jadaone as a filmmaker you can always trust to make good movies, and of Racal as an actress who will lead the next generation of stars. They're the future of Philippine cinema.",2025-11-26,positive,0.982017457485199,-1

Sunshine,"really loved watching sunshine. everything felt so real the acting, the places, the whole atmosphere. it really showed manila the way people actually see it every day: crowded streets, smoky air, tight alleys, small stalls everywhere, messy and honest.in sunshine, you follow a young gymnast who dreams of joining the national team. but right before her big try-out, she finds out she’s pregnant, and her whole life suddenly shifts. all the things she was working for feel like they’re slipping away.the movie doesn’t hide the harsh parts of her situation. she ends up looking for illegal abortion pills from sketchy vendors near church stalls, which shows how desperate people can get when safe options aren’t available. you also see how people look at her, the judgment, the shaming, the assumptions.one thing that really stood out was the little girl in the film. she felt like a symbol, almost like a reflection of innocence or the childhood the main character is losing too quickly. the little girl also shows how young women are expected to handle things way beyond their age, carrying responsibilities and pain that should never have been theirs in the first place. she represents the younger version of so many girls who grow up in harsh realities, where choices are limited and voices are ignored. the little girl is a reminder of what could’ve been and what gets taken away too soon.through all of this, sunshine makes you think about real issues. what happens to young girls who get pregnant and have no support? what if they’re too young, or not ready, or simply trying to survive? what if they’re judged instead of helped?overall, sunshine felt raw and honest. no sugarcoating, no pretending, just real life, and that’s what makes it hit so hard.",2025-11-26,positive,0.9947414398193359,1
Sunshine,"Naiintindihan mo na?Gets ko na.At first I thought Annika's role was to portray Sunshine's inner child but of course as the movie progressed I realized what actually Annika's character represented. I also noticed how since Mary Grace was carrying her unborn child longer than Sunshine, Ariana already had a name meaning Mary Grace probably already thought & pictured giving birth to him knowing she didn't really have a choice after being sexually harassed at 13 years old by her mom's lover. While Sunshine only called Annikas's character Bata, showing how most probably from the beginning she knew what her choice would be therefore why she never thought of a name.A woman is often judged automatically once she considers abortion, she is often called names, and is labeled. Sunshine represents all the women who has already made up their minds, yet is still conflicted. Throughout her experience, she was consumed with guilt & doubt as she knows the weight that comes with even only thinking of what she's about to do but it's either that or sacrificing her dream, her only dream. People often judge quickly and forget that even when a young woman seems to easily decide to get rid of her baby, it's hers. What I mean to say is that, once a woman has an abortion she's not merely getting rid of a clump of cells, she's sacrificing a part of herself; a possibility, a what could've been.Sunshine was haunted with the thought of her child being angry and dissapointed at her for what she's about to do but as time went on and when she rehearsed her routine as she gave it her all whilst preparing for the Olympics, she is reminded why & from there she knew, that her child would've understood and that she's made peace with herself.This film excellently portrayed the unfortunate reality many young women & even children, are experiencing in our country — all around the globe even. As I continue to write this review, the messages in the film remain present & true as I write this with a bit of doubt & guilt because I'm supposed to agree with the doctor that judged Sunshine right? Because in the bible it is a sin? Is it wrong that if I was with Sunshine I would've supported her decision? Sure, I wouldn't have encouraged her but I would've supported her nonetheless. That alone is proof how behind we are, not only from healthcare services to proper maternity wards but how we, as a Catholic country, continue to enforce our beliefs to individuals who clearly don't share the same belief.It is unfair how men like miggy & that uncle get to continue to live normally after what they did. Sure, they'd be guilty but when the time comes it isn't them who'll be lying on a hospital bed as an attempt fails or as a child is birthed; it isn't them who'll be conflicted to sacrifice their dreams nor is it them who'll be scrutinized and judged by everybody.May Sunshine be a reminder that it isn't selfish to choose yourself. In fact, to birth a child with an irresponsible father whilst being unstable in all aspects of yourself is more selfish of an act than choosing not to give birth.",2025-11-26,positive,0.7541698217391968,-1

Sometimes loyalty is quiet, sometimes it’s all you can offer, and sometimes it’s the only thing that saves someone. I believe God forgives, and I believe He lifts people back up, but He often does it through the hands of those who refuse to leave.What unsettled me was the doctor turning a fragile moment into a moral lecture. A woman’s choice belongs to her — her body, her future, her weight to carry. That’s why I never argue about abortion. I don’t push beliefs. I don’t corner anyone into a “should.” I only guide, gently, and let them choose their own path.In the end, I saw myself in Sunshine or maybe the version of myself who hopes fiercely for others. And I’m genuinely thankful that she reached her dreams, even after walking through so much darkness to get there.",2025-11-26,positive,0.9870391488075256,1

Sunshine,"I just watched Sunshine and honestly, no words can fully capture how exceptional the writing is. The film lays bare how brutally hard it is to be a woman—especially when it comes to unwanted pregnancies. Men ruin everything and walk away untouched, while women are left with all the responsibility, all the judgment, and all the shame. We’re expected to endure, to forget, to move on, while they roam freely without consequence!!!And it makes me fucking furious—furious at men and the religious institutions that still believe they have the right to dictate what a woman can do with her own body. Women deserve choice, autonomy, and proper healthcare. We deserve dignity.

Sunshine,"I love how this movie speaks for today's society!!! The movie literally showed how women in the society suffers because of our culture. I also love how Sunshine fought for what her heart truly desires, that no one was able to stop her from reaching her dreams, not her sister, her boyfriend, her boyfriend's father and everyone around her who judged her for having an unwanted pregnancy. Only people who are pro-choice would be able to understand where Sunshine is coming from. Kudos to Maris, Direk Antoinette and to her team for creating this movie. Sobrang ganda!! Indeed an eye opener hindi lang sa generation today kundi pati sa mga taong nanatiling sarado ang isipan when it comes to these topics.",2025-11-26,positive,0.993051290512085,1

Sunshine,"What my country needs to see right now! Why judge a woman for choosing her dreams when Filipino’s normalize youth reaching for their dreams. They can’t handle a woman who does not need a baby to fulfill her dreams. That is why many suffer from poverty because having a baby was never a blessing it comes from a responsibility. Having a baby is not just having it intentionally, some had it accidentally. Never normalize having a baby when you cannot take care of it both mental and financial. Filipino women did it themselves but the society denies it because they depended on patriarchy. What a sad system to live in.",2025-11-26,negative,0.7141112685203552,-1

Sunshine,"Drown out the noise. You're Sunshine.Sobrang tapang at sobrang totoo ng Pelikulang ito. Ramdam mo yung bawat emosyon na gustong iparamdam nila Direk Tonet at ni Maris. Maraming salamat Direk sa bawat dayalogong nakakapagbukas ng usaping madalas ay hindi napag-uusapan sa bansa. ---Sobrang galing na na portray nila ang Maynila lalo na ang bawat sulok ng Quiapo na lugar na puno ng kwentong ayaw pag-usapan. Quiapo na kahit saan ay may mga gamot at langis na bawal sa ""batas ng Dyos"".Bawat karakter sa Pelikula ay may role para sa kabuuan ng gustong ipakita ng pelikula;Si Sunshine na gagawin ang lahat para sa kanyang pangarap, ang ate niya na mirror kung ano ang hahantungin niya sa magiging desisyon niya sa bata, ang Pastor na personipikasyon ng matinding pananalig ng mga Filipino sa Diyos, si Dr. Helena at ang tindera sa Quiapo na nagbibigay pag-asa, at si Thea sa kung ano ang stigma ng bansa sa isyung ito. Madalas, ang tingin natin sa abortion ay ""kasalanan sa Diyos"" at ang teenage pregnancy naman ay ""kadiri"" pero kung ito man ang tingin ng karamihan sa bansa, bakit wala pa rin tayong ginagawang aksyon para rito? Bakit wala pa ring maayos at komprehensibong sex education lalo na para sa kabataan? Bakit wala pa rin tayong accessible healthcare, lalo na ang mga kababaihan,? at bakit wala pa ring karapatang mamili ang mga kababaihan para sa kanilang katawan? Maaring ang mga bata sa istorya ay ang personipikasyon ng konsensya nila Sunshine at Menggay, pero ang interpretasyon ko, sila ang ""what could have been"", ang mga buhay na maaring umusbong kung hindi sila nagpa abort. Maaring kaya't may pangalan si Ariana dahil sumagi sa isip ni Menggay ang buhayin ang bata, pero kaya't walang pangalan ang batang kasama ni Sunshine ay dahil simula't sapul ay alam niyang hindi pa niya kaya o gugustuhing maging ina (kahit na may mga oras na nagdadalawang isip siya). Kaya't may sariling pangarap si Ariana dahil maari siyang mabuhay. At ang pangarap naman ng bata, ay ang pangarap ni Sunshine, dahil mas malakas ang sigaw ng kanyang puso para tuparin ang mga pangarap na ito kaysa sa pagdadalawang isip niyang ipalaglag ang bata. Sa Bansang konserbatibo katulad ng Pilipinas mahirap pag-usapan at madalas ay iniiwasan natin ang mga taboo topics tulad ng aborsyon, relihiyon, r4pe, at kahit idolism politicians, pero katulad ni Sunshine, kailangan natin itong harapin. At katulad ni Sunshine, tayo ay mangarap, na mabuksan ang isip ng bawat-isa at magkaroon ng maayos na solusyon sa mga ito. Sa mga isyu katulad ng aborsyon, tayo ay may sari-sariling opinyon at ang bawat opinyon na ito ay may mga rasong mula sa mga karanasan, sariling paniniwala, at maski sa takot natin. Si Sunshine, ipinakita niya na hindi natin kailangang hanapin ang kung ano nga ba ang ""tama"" at hindi natin kailangang baguhin ang ating paniniwala. Kundi, Kailangan lamang natin buksan ang mga mata, puso, at utak sa bawat isyung ito at sa mga sitwasyon ng mga taong nakararanas nito.Sa huli, alam nating mas pinili ni Sunshine ang kanyang pangarap. Bago man makamit ito, maraming pagsubok ang kanyang dinanas, at marami rin siyang nalamang kwento na katulad ng sakanya. Hindi lamang nag-iisa si Sunshine!Maaring isang karakter lamang sa isang piksyon na pelikula si Sunshine, ngunit ang bawat eksena rito ay maaring naranasan na rin ng isang tao, at ang istorya ni Sunshine ay istorya ng lahat ng kababaihan. Hindi lamang nag-iisa si Sunshine, maaring mayroon na tayong nakasalamuhang katulad ni Sunshine, maaring tayo rin ay si Sunshine na gagawin ang lahat para sa pangarap.

Tahimik pero kasabay no'n ay maingay na damdamin. Isa iyon sa mga nagustuhan ko sa pelikulang 'to. Hindi niya sinasabi 'yong nararamdaman ng karakter pero pinapakita niya. Mula sa emosyon ng artista, sa mga lugar na nilalakaran niya, at sa mga taong nakakasalamuha niya. Hindi ito katulad no'ng kadalasang pelikula na puro away, iyak, at sigawan. Wala gaanong eksena na ganoon pero makukuha mo pa rin 'yong mensahe, 'yung nararamdaman ni Sunshine at lahat ng pinagdadaanan niya.

Sunshine,"Oh my fucking god, Direk Tonet, you did it! YOU ACTUALLY DID IT!!!Drown out the noise.A film for all women out there. This is definitely an outstanding film that captures the reality of most women in the Philippine society. Sobrang ganda. The color grading? Kuhang kuha yung magulo, maingay at masulasok na lugar ng Maynila, at partikular nito ay sa Quiapo. Ang ironic rin, na yung nagbebenta ng pamparegla or pampalaglag is the same na ale who's selling religious statues and relics. I love how it contradicts the situation. Kitang kita mo yung gustong ipahiwatig ng film throughout that specific scene alone. Ang galing lang talaga. Ang daming nangyari sa Quiapo. I would love to point out na true, sobrang pinoy ng actions ni Sunshine there. Iba yung tama ng bawat hakbang niya papalapit sa simbahan para humingi ng tawad, sa ale na nagbebenta ng pampalaglag, lugar na puno ng relihiyoso ngunit mapanghusgang mga tao, sa pagsira kuno ng kotse ng putanginang ex niya na wala man lang reaksyon nung sinabi niyang buntis siya, sa pagcheck in niya sa avenida inn. Tagos na tagos at damang dama ko yung emosyon ni Sunshine from the screen. Hindi lahat gusto maging nanay at tumayong maging magulang sa mga anak nila. Totoo naman. Iba ang bigat at responsibilidad na dala ng isang pagiging nanay. Kahit ganun saludo pa rin ako sayo, Sunshine. Para sa mga babae at para lamang sa mga babae. I love being a woman.

At one point, I found myself teary, realising how f*cked up the system is — how biases and beliefs can completely derail someone’s life.Sunshine isn’t a perfect film, but its message stings and leaves you gobsmacked.

Kidding aside, I've been in a huge movie slump for a long time and this was the only movie I wanted to watch in the cinema, and I wasn't able to do so. When I found out that it was coming on Netflix, it was the only thing that kept me going for the whole month. I'm so glad that I watched it. This just intensified my political rage because I've always wished that abortion was legal here in the Philippines. I hope for a future that no other woman may go through all the things that Sunshine went through. I hope that no one else would be forced to go through motherhood when they are far from ready. But we could only hope. I love you Antoinette Jaodone, and Maris Racal. Fuck you Miggy, and fuck the men who can't wear condoms.

Sunshine,"This film is a fucking masterpiece. It is a protest—a massive slap in the face to those who deny women of the liberty to choose. That alone is one thing to talk about which this film DEMANDS and I am soooo here for it. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Direk Tonet's range is a blessing to philippine cinema. The way her mind works, and every detail that was put into this film was nothing short of perfection. Hangang-hanga ako sa'yo, Direk, as in. BWELO!!! Also, this is Maris Racal's best performance yet, gets ba? The way it looked as if she really owned the pain, the way it REALLY felt as if everything was against her. Ang galing, sobra. Bwelo part 2!In terms of the film's themes, I just want to say na sobrang timely at perfect niya. EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS. Abortion is healthcare, and to deny abortion means to disregard a person, more specifically, a woman's right to healthcare. Sana sa pamamagitan ng pagsusubaybay kung paano naging impyerno ang buhay ni Sunshine ng napakabilis, mamulat naman tayo kahit kakaunti. Speaking of women and healthcare, WE NEED MORE DOCTORS LIKE DOC HELENA!!!! Tangina imbyerna ako dun sa matandang biglang nag bible sharing, like of all places and of all situations, dun ka talaga?? Sa isang maternity ward?? Gets, Catholicism in the Philippines is widespread, pero that does not excuse the fact na there is a time and place for it jusko. Also, some might not get the little girl's (Annika Co) role sa film, pero the way I view it, She is the personification ng pinapasan nila. The inner saboteur that was born from immense societal pressure. The child they gave birth to, before actually giving birth. For me, sobrang important ng role niya dun, because Sunshine's body language can only tell so much, kaya they were a big help in terms of really navigating Sunshine's individuality. Then we have Miggy. Actually wala akong gustong sabihin sa kanya. Tangina niya. Let's leave it at that nalang. I have soooooo much to say about this film, but I'm going to leave it at that, because I want you and everyone else to watch it kasi sobrang relevant niya AS IN.

Sunshine,"I really really wished i watched this at the cinema pero okay na rin ata na sa kwarto ko lang at mag-isa kong pinanuod ito dahil walang halong biro na iyak ko nang iyak, tsaka yung galit ko, walang mapagsidlan. Nakakagalit kasi sa tuwing napapag-usapan o napupunta sa ganitong topic iyong usapan, bakit kailangan pang ipaliwanag ang abortion nang maingat na para bang may matatapakan? Na sa tuwing pinipilit kong kumbinsihin sinumang kausap ko, palaging naiiyak ako sa sobrang frustration kasi di nila ma-gets iyong pinupunto ko. One time, habang naglalakad kami pa-Recto galing school, may baby na umiiyak sa sidewalk, may katabi siyang tulog na minor de edad na lalaki at babae (di ko alam kung kapatid ba ito nung baby o sila iyong parents). Then, there's also a time during a jeepney commute from Tondo to Quiapo, may nakasabay akong dalawang teenager rin na may dalang baby, one doing her best to hold the baby in her small arms while the other looked out for them. My concern goes out for the baby, but my greatest concern are for those kids, who were children as well. Madami pang beses na may na encounter ako na almost the same situation and even now, I could never know their real stories. At tuwing umuuwi ako sa bahay, isang malaking singhap at galit na naman sa gobyerno ang dala ko. Sabi nila, masyado akong sensitibo para maramdaman yung ganitong malalaking emosyon pero naisip ko, hindi nga ba dapat lang na magalit tayo? Hindi ba empathy ang pinakang kailangan sa mga ganitong pagkakataon at sitwasyon? Kaya gayon na lamang ang pasasalamat ko kay direk tonet sa paglikha ng karakter na kagaya ni Sunshine at pagsulat ng isang storya na totoong sumasalamin sa matagal nang suliranin ng mga kababaihan dito sa Pilipinas. Sobrang galing lamang na naipahayag nya iyong kwento nang may labis na pag-unawa, hindi lamang sa isang indibidwal, kundi sa maraming kababaihan na may parehas na kinatatayuan. Sobrang galing din ng cinematography, editing, at production design, lalo na nung napakinggan ko sa AWKP kung gaano ka meticulous iyong buong staff behind the camera para mai-portray ng pelikulang ito iyong mensahe na gusto nitong iparating. Sobrang galing at sobrang nakaka empower. Nawa'y maunawaan na nila, kung di man ng lahat pero sana ng nakararami lalong lalo na iyong may mga kapangyarihan (parehas sa gobyerno at religion) para maisaayos ang matagal nang kakulangan ng access sa maayos na healthcare dito sa bansa. You all preach for love and care for one another but when it's a girl or a woman just simply wanting ownership for her own body, you simply cannot give her that? Then, maybe your belief and love for God is too narrow-minded and shallow. It's high time we hear the pleas of all Sunshines out there! As for me, gets na gets kita Sunshine.

Sunshine,"“Gets ko na.”The film doesn’t preach, it just lays out the messy truth. Sunshine chooses herself, her future, and her dreams, and the film refuses to guilt-trip her for it. It’s a story that sits right in the tension between “pro-life” in the traditional Filipino sense and the very real reality that a woman’s body is her call. My body, my choice. Hindi siya concept dito—pinapakita siya as lived experience.What makes the movie hit harder is how disruptive it is to the usual script. In our culture, teenage pregnancy is still treated like some moral test the girl has to pass, while the older generation automatically leans into religion, “pro-baby,” and quiet suffering as the noble path. Meanwhile, the guy who should be held accountable often disappears into the background, untouched. Or worse, the film doesn’t shy away from showing how men can also be the source of the violence—rape, exploitation, dynamics twisted by class and power.But the film doesn’t drown in despair. Sunshine’s sister? She’s the heartbeat of the whole thing. The support, the admiration, the way she stands beside Sunshine without making her feel small. And honestly, it’s the kind of love that exposes how warped the traditional expectations are. Some women support women. Some people actually understand that choosing yourself is choosing life.Sunshine isn’t a comfortable watch—and that’s the point. It shakes the old narratives, calls out the hypocrisy, and makes space for a girl to choose her own damn direction without being sanctified or demonized for it. Brave film.

Sunshine,"finally had the courage to write my thoughts about the movie that spoke so much about the struggles of being a woman - especially in a country that favors men.it was such a heavy watch. It perfectly portrayed how women gets blamed and crucified so much. And men could easily get away for something they should have shared or even bigger fault and responsibility with. tangina rin talaga ng mga lalaki for being irresponsible assholes, lalong-lalo na ng mga rapist. Matagal naman nang problema, alam na ng lahat, pero hindi pa rin nasosolusyunan. Sana mayroong Ate Geleen at Thea na masasandalan ang bawat Sunshine, at bawat Menggay ay mayroong Sunshine. Sana mapaingay ng kwento ni Sunshine, ni Menggay - at lahat ng babaeng nanggaling o kasalukuyang nasa ganitong sitwasyon - ang diskusyon sa kakulangan sa karapatan ng mga kababaihan sa kapakanan ng sarili nilang katawan.

Hindi naman natin kailangan na isali pa ang mga paniniwala—kaunting pag-unawa at pagmamalasakit lang sa kahit anong sitwasyon ng iba. Hindi rin naman kailangan na maging sangga sa pinaniniwalaan ng mga tao—sadyang mapapatanong ka lang kung bakit pilit nilang pinipikit ang kanilang mga mata.

Sunshine,"gets ko na.this film looks soft at first, but underneath it’s basically a reminder of how exhausting it actually is to be a woman in a world built by people who never had to fight for basic respect.it doesn’t go on some dramatic rant about misogyny. it just shows it—quiet, casual, constant. the kind of everyday sexism that everyone else seems numb to, the kind you’re expected to ignore unless it becomes too obvious to pretend it isn’t there. women always notice it long before anyone else does.being a woman now means moving through life with your guard halfway up all the time, because experience already taught you that someone is always ready to talk over you, question you, or blame you for something they’d excuse instantly if a man did it.that pressure—be perfect but not intimidating, kind but not “weak,” confident but not “too much”—it’s all over this film. not even in a dramatic way. just… there. like background noise we’ve gotten used to.what hit me the most is how the men in this movie move through the world with zero awareness. no fear. no second thoughts. they get space, leniency, the benefit of the doubt. women get judgment, expectations, consequences.and the crazy part is how normal it all feels. like yep, here we go again. this is just life.sunshine gets that quiet frustration—the tiredness that doesn’t go away. the way women are still somehow the ones expected to bend, adjust, shrink, compromise. the ones apologizing for having boundaries or opinions or basic self-respect.it’s not a movie that tries to “empower” or offer solutions. it doesn’t even try to soften the message. it just holds up a mirror and goes: “see? this is what we deal with.”and honestly… yeah. it is.",2025-11-26,positive,0.9581465125083923,19

It was a thought provoking film done beautifully by direk tonet. It tackled several topics of poverty, corruption, bad governance, and bad healthcare in the Philippines.

Sunshine,"this ""sunshine"" film is a must watch. this will shows people how the society shuts and silenced every women under any circumstances they face. this isn't just an ordinary film, this talks and speaks a lot about womanhood. this film wasn't have so much dialouge, pero damang dama lahat ng emosyon. sobrang realistic. grabe hands down sa'yo Maris Racal, you are so so so so galing. (gusto ko 'yung paghampas ng bote sa ulo ng rapist eh, deserve) dito mo rin makikita na sobrang fucked up ng discrimination sa medical assistance para sa mga babaeng naka-experience nito. like? as someone na pro-choice, bakit ba ang hirap-hirap ipaunawa sa mga tao kung anong reasons bakit ako pro-choice, hindi lang dahil babae ako or ano pero???? nakikita nyo ba??? kung bakit??? kasi 2025 na almost 2026 yet, sobrang ganon pa rin ang mga tao. like how people act like it’s nothing, how can they deny na sobrang crucial at sobrang lalim ng usapin tungkol sa abortion lalo na dito sa bansang 'to. people talk without even trying to understand. they only judge, they only throw words, pero they never stop to think about the pain, the fear, and the trauma, especially those women even child/minors na nabuntis dahil sa sexual assault or rape. let's be real sobrang daming ganitong cases dito sa atin, may ginagawa ba ang government??? wala, they choose to make the victims think na wala silang choice kung 'di tanggapin at ituloy na lang bec of the law? the beliefs? talagang hindi lang batas ang kalaban mo sa usapin na 'to kung hindi ang mga tao (mga religious at nagsisimba tuwing linggo pero mas masahol pa sa demonyo) truth hurts. people should learn and understand that abortion isn’t about irresponsibility. hindi naman lahat ng gumawa nito ginawa bec they don't like it, dumaan sila sa malalim na pag iisip, sa lungkot at bigat na meron sila. it’s about survival. it’s about a woman fighting for herself, for her future, para sa buhay na deserve niya. and yet, they push women to the edge, tapos sila rin ang huhusga kapag nawala. it’s so messed up how society expects women to carry everything, trauma, shame, pain—pero parang wala silang karapatan magdesisyon para sa sarili nilang katawan.people must learn that woman should not go under any circumstance na lampas sa kakayahan nila. hindi mo pwede i-force ang isang tao na mabuhay sa isang bagay dahil lang sa beliefs mo. bakit lagi ang solution ay kontrolin ang babae? sobrang daming paraan ang pwedeng gawin when it comes to this topic. bakit walang ginagawa ang government para dito? bakit hindi mag-invest sa proper sex education, sa preventive healthcare, sa support systems? bakit yung babae lagi ang may kasalanan? women didn’t live to bear a child. hindi yon responsibilidad, it’s a choice. women live to be themselves. to find who they are, to chase their dreams, to build their own life. they are whole human beings, not vessels.and the more people ignore this, the more lives they destroy. the more they push women into corners where silence becomes the only choice. abortion is not a debate piece. it’s not a headline. it’s not something you get to comment on without empathy. it’s about real people. women are not born to suffer. women are not born to carry. women are born to live.ps: PUTANGINA NYONG MGA LALAKI",2025-11-26,positive,0.9040586948394775,1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is the kind of film that quietly earns for your attention. It pulls you into a world that feels overwhelmingly familiar yet rarely portrayed with this level of honesty. At the heart of it is Maris Racal, delivering what may be her most nuanced performance to date.The film’s backdrop, quiapo, is equally compelling. Masikip, Mainit, Maingay, Mabaho — pero buhay. This is a story of sacrifice, particularly the kind expected from women. That they are often asked to endure more than they should. They are expected to adjust, to stay, to carry, to choose responsibility over desire. Sunshine goes deeper, challenging the everyday hypocrisy we tend to overlook. This film will leave you with a question that lingers long after the credits fade: Do we truly have the right to decide what’s “right” for someone else?Sunshine reminds us that empathy begins where judgment ends. And at the core of all this realism and heaviness is a message that lands softly: choose kindness. because behind every decision is a story we do not fully know. behind every face is a storm we did not witness.Sunshine isn’t just the best filipino film i’ve watched this year — it is a brave, intimate, and necessary piece of storytelling. In the end it leaves us with a simple truth: after every storm, we wait for Sunshine to come. ",2025-11-26,positive,0.9728075265884399,1

Sunshine,"“Drown out the noise.” The words from her coach keep echoing in Sunshine’s mind whenever she loses focus during her routine. But in the middle of Manila—the blaring jeepney horns, the chaotic streets of Quiapo, the rumbling trains—there seems to be no escape from sound. Yet the real noise is inside her: voices in her head questioning, doubting, demanding answers. What is right? What should she choose? Should she continue pursuing the dream she started, or embrace the new life quietly growing inside her? Amid the chaos, Sunshine’s heart struggles, searching for peace, for direction, for the courage to decide.This is arguably one of the bravest Pinoy films released in Philippine cinema, even if it didn’t get wide distribution. It tackles women’s autonomy—raising a child, reproductive rights, and the right to choose what’s best for themselves. So bold, it challenges the comfort zone and questions the stereotypical mindset toward women who experience teenage pregnancy.The film is also a stark reminder of how broken our healthcare system is for women, especially in maternal care. Sunshine’s story is just the tip of the iceberg among thousands of women who struggle to keep their children alive or risk their bodies simply because their physiology or age cannot sustain a pregnancy.This is NOT about ABORTION. This film is about how women are crucified for past choices, how society lets one moment define a lifetime. It shows how young girls are often weaponized by circumstances beyond their control—pregnancy, abuse, or rape—without understanding that some are victims of forces they didn’t choose.“Gets ko na.” That line in the third act cemented this as one of the best films I’ve seen this year. It’s not just about understanding—it’s about Sunshine finally realizing what’s best for her. Her missteps never stopped her from becoming an Olympian.This film is powerful, necessary, and unforgettable. A definite must-watch.Lesson learned: Fuck men! hahaha",2025-11-26,positive,0.9782072901725769,-1

Sunshine,"Maraming binukas to na diskurso, pero walang sinara. Ang pinaka-statement ng pelikula patungkol sa teenage/unwanted pregnancy ay: my body, my rules. Na sa kabilang banda ay tama naman, na sa kabilang banda ay hungkag na konseptong liberal. Nakita ng bida ang iba't ibang side ng unwanted pregnancy sa bansa, tulad nung nangyari sa 13 yrs old na side character na lumpen na ginagahasa ng kanyang tito sa tulong ng kanyang mama. Hindi yon unwanted pregnancy dulot ng sarili niyang kapasyahan na makipagtalik ng walang proteksyon. Bunga ito ng sistematikong exploitasyon ng kabataang kababaihan bilang pambayad utang ng kanilang mga magulang. Isa sa mga sanga ng patriyarkal na pananamantala sa sistemang kapital. Ang tanong ngayon ay anong epekto nito sa bida. Ang sagot ay wala. Chase your dreams, choose yourself, my body, my rules.Kahit sa background, walang hudyat ng pagtutol. Ng paglaban para sa abortion. Ng panawagan para sa kapakanan ng mga kabataan at kababaihan. Ng pagtuligsa sa sistemang lumilikha ng uring lumpen. Kaya as much as social commentary ito ng sitwasyon ng kababaihan sa bansa, hungkag at supot ito dahil hindi ito makalahatang panig. Ikumpara halimbawa sa Maynila ni Lino Brocka, kung saan sa kabila ng hindi pagsali ni Julio sa mga protesta, ay nandoon palagi ang mga aktibista, sa likod ng bida, sumisiksik bilang background noise sa panahon ng kanyang mga paglilimi. Ang pakikibaka ay nariyan, ang pelikula ay isang behikulo ng social commentary para ipakita ang lahat ng nariyan.Sa kabila ng husay ng pelikula na buksan ang usapin patungkol sa abortion, kulang na kulang ito sa pagtulak ng kampanya. Pulitikal ang sinusubukan pasukin ng pelikula, pero takot itong pumanig at pinipilit pumagitna. Sumatotal, ang liberalistang posisyon sa abortion e humahantong sa charity para sa mga nasa laylayan na hindi nakakatamasa ng 'my body, my rules' dahil wala sila sa pusisyon para talaga mamili. Nakakaiyak, oo, nakakabagabag damdamin. Nakakagalit, oo, pero ano ngayon? Ang husay ng mga mamemelikula ay bigyan direksyon ang audience sa kung anong dapat gawin pagkatapos -- lalo na social commentary. Ano ang landas palabas ng reyalidad na inilalahad ng kwento? Pano tayo aalpas sa patriyarkal-kapitalistang kuntsabahan na nananamantala sa ating mga kababaihan? Ano ang landas palabas ng pelikula? Dapat marunong mag-imagine ang socially-aware na mamemelikula kung paano babaguhin ang reyalidad na sinasalamin niya sa kanyang pelikula. Sa ganitong pamantayan, palyado ang pelikula sa kanyang agenda. Ang pagpapamulat ay dapat laging tumatagos sa pagpapakilos.",2025-08-02,positive,0.5765274167060852,2

Sunshine,"I had been waiting a long time to watch Sunshine, especially since I never got the chance to see it on the big screen. So, when it finally arrived on Netflix, I was so excited, only for that excitement to fade the longer I watched.The premise is undeniably compelling: a young gymnast discovers she’s pregnant just as her lifelong dream of reaching the Olympics is within reach. It’s a setup filled with emotional stakes and potential for a powerful, character-driven story.But instead of exploring her dedication to the sport, the film shifts almost entirely to her pregnancy and her attempts to deal with it. I kept waiting for scenes that would show her fighting for her dream, intense training, the pressure of competition, the physical and emotional toll of gymnastics, but those moments never really come. The narrative focuses more on side characters and subplots that feel unnecessary and, frankly, uninteresting.I couldn’t help comparing this film to other international athlete biopics that portray the grit, passion, and relentless work behind the journey. Sunshine had all the ingredients to deliver that kind of inspiring story, but it simply doesn’t stick the landing.Overall, I’m disappointed. With a stronger focus on the athletic journey and the challenges of balancing an unexpected pregnancy with Olympic ambitions, this could have been a much more compelling and memorable film",2025-11-27,negative,0.8580448031425476,1

Sadly, there isn’t much to love after watching it (I mostly blame the writing).It started strong, not gonna lie — the pressure and obstacles hindering her chance to become an Olympic gymnast were compelling. Then came that scene — her inner voice? The amalgamation of being a future mother? Or just a little kid guiding her throughout the movie? Okay, neat.After that, more happens around her, but nothing happens with the main character (the gymnast storyline disappears until the ending). The film also tries to touch on the status of abortion in the Philippines, but it falls flat and feels unnecessary.Still, hats off to the director for tackling one of the taboo topics here in the Philippines, even if it could have been executed better.",2025-11-26,positive,0.8879741430282593,-1

The film’s most striking stroke lies in its visualization of fetuses within two pregnant women’s wombs as tangible, living children—these vivid little figures, like walking metaphors of life, infuse the work with poignant symbolic weight. Regrettably, the thin screenplay structure and somewhat lackluster overall execution still cannot mask their flaws; they fail to fully nurture this unique metaphorical expression, nor do they successfully ground the depth of the topic or the emotional resonance of the characters.",2025-09-06,positive,0.6419747471809387,32

It’s an eye-opener for privileged viewers and should make people who have power over these issues think deeply.

Sunshine,"Admirable effort to tackle abortion, a huge taboo in a largely Catholic population. I can commend it for what it tries to speak up about which is how abortion should be an option for the women in this country, which I can definitely agree with. It even brings up the age old question of “If you’re against abortion what about a child that is a victim of rape?” through that one character. However, It’s all very on the nose, and leaves me wanting more about Sunshine’s motivations, more into the psychological unraveling as she grapples with her situation (that isn’t just her seeing those kids), I would’ve loved to have seen more about her dynamics with her sister who is a single mother. I wanted the film to really expound on her emotions, not just kids being a figment of her imagination being used as a way to talk about her feelings without showing it. It all just felt a bit cliche, and the ending was such a cop out for me, I wanted to see her make that choice, grapple with its moral dilemma and watch her claw her way back to be in tip top shape for the nationals and then the Olympics.",2025-11-27,positive,0.9628902077674866,25

Sunshine,"I love that Antoinette Jadaone got to make a film about such an important issue with a big star as its lead. However, depicting Sunshine’s unborn child as the opposite of that—a fully grown child that is even capable of swearing and questioning her mother’s decisions—defeats the purpose of the film. That way of thinking is exactly why we are not making any progress in legalizing abortion. In a truly pro-choice film, the story would only be about how Sunshine deserves to be safe and supported as she pursues her athletic ambitions. For a film that boldly criticizes closed-minded Christians, I found it confusing why it was simultaneously trying to seem neutral by giving the pro-life argument some representation. I thought it was going to be braver than that. On top of the ambiguity of its politics is the underwhelming presentation of what is at stake for Sunshine. Many scenes still felt a little too shallow, quick, and simple. As if the film is telling me a story I’m supposed to already know. For a supposedly hard-hitting film, not much was framed as a revelation. I’m just disappointed because this was heavily marketed as a groundbreaking film, yet with a lack of a clear vision, it seems like it’s not helping us move at all.",2025-11-26,negative,0.755797803401947,-1

But so far, it has a lot of good points jud like give, esp with how it mirrored the reality jud hahaha. Let's not kid ourselves, this is closest to reality jud. Ganahan pud ko adtong scene with piolo like so proud of sunshine! She knew na she's nowhere capable of raising the child and she knew pud na raising the kid with the bullshit father and his family would only do her more harm rhan good, and who knows, this may cost her her life sad kay shit, unsa man pud to na amahan. Kudos to piolo sad kay super maayo kaayo sa pa two faced portryal HAHAHAHAHAHA. so now, i think nagsugod na medyo na engk nako sa movie kay kadtong nisud na sa picture tung kid from showtime? Like? Vey out of the picture, very random, and very redundant..it made everything a lot ackward jud. Maris alone def made the movie good man hys, and sa kadtong gi raped na 13 y.o. Like so? Gibuakan rakag botelya sa ulo?

Sunshine,"THE FILM SUNSHINE (2024), IS REALLY A SUNSHINE? 1000%! YES IT IS!What’s more amazingly beautiful about the screenplay & direction is how the film starts and how it ends. Interestingly, there are moments where she silences the noise and does what she feels and loves. It also acts as a symbolic gesture of how she manages to pull herself out of an unwanted situation: the way she shuts down all the chaos and harsh experiences.The film is a social critique of how, for more than a century, certain laws have undermined reproductive rights, and how 1000s of Filipino women die each year from complications. Although the film is native to the Philippines, its commentary reflects many countries where abortion rights are still completely prohibited.It is not merely directed toward capturing Sunshine's journey (played by Maris Racal) facing psychological and emotional conflict within society; it also explores the dynamics of the families involved, especially her elder sister with a months-old baby, crafted in a way that reflects Sunshine's future & the collapse of her dreams.What I loved most is how director Antoinette creatively puts Sunshine’s moral consciousness as a physical character, played by Annika Co, showing how it never really leaves her. Their conversations are intricately written, sometimes her conscience is angry and argumentative, and sometimes it simply smiles back at her.All in all, it is film that softens & sharpens at the same time. It gives voice to the women who are rarely heard & reveals the emotional truth behind difficult choices. Above all, it reminds us that agency is power, and that every woman deserves the right to define her own future.",2025-12-06,positive,0.9925416707992554,1
Sunshine,"DROWN OUT THE NOISE.Sunshine (2024), directed by Antoinette Jadaone, follows Sunshine (Maris Racal), a young rhythmic gymnast who dreams of making the national team and competing in the Olympics. Her life takes a sudden turn when she discovers she is pregnant right before the final selection. Refusing to give up on her dream or her life, she desperately searches for an illegal way to terminate the pregnancy in a society where abortion is strictly prohibited.Fyi, this is the first Filipino film I’ve ever watched, and surprisingly it’s pretty ok. It feels like a fusion of Posesif (2017) and Dua Garis Biru (2019) combine those two and you basically get Sunshine. Overall I still enjoyed it, but I think the chasing the dream aspect, which should’ve been the core of the film, felt meh. There weren’t really any moments that pushed the conflict harder. For example, revealing Sunshine’s pregnancy during her rhythmic gymnastics training, or showing how exhausting her training was to the point she almost gave up. Little things like that could’ve made the struggle hit much deeper. That’s just my random thought, but I do feel those moments would’ve strengthened the heart of the story, since Sunshine’s core conflict truly lies in chasing her dream as an athlete and the harsh reality she’s forced to face.",2025-12-05,positive,0.9859305620193481,1

Sunshine,"Abortion is such a complicated moral dilemma, and I personally lean toward not agreeing with it, so it was hard for me to empathize with the protagonist. A lot of her suffering felt like the result of her own choices, and the film’s attempt to make me feel sorry for her by surrounding her with awful people sometimes felt manipulative.The imaginary child concept also didn’t always work for me. She’s clearly meant to be a moral compass or a symbol of societal pressure, but without her, the film already shows how judgmental and unforgiving the world around her is. It made her presence feel more forced than meaningful. Sometimes I see her just to connect story and keep the plot moving or a way to feel sorry for her more.However, I connected more with the side character’s story. I can understand why abortion is legal if thats the case. Her pain and the horror that she went through and also affecting how I see Sunshine. nevertheless, I still think it’s worth watching.

And the way Sunshine desperately looked for meds and sketchy ways to make it go away? That’s painfully REAL and something nobody would ever wants to talk about. We’ve all had those intrusive thoughts about abortion, but we don’t go through with it because here in the Philippines, it’s illegal, immoral, and against our faith.Sunshine honestly represents every girl who’s had to go through that kind of fear. I can relate. We all have our own dreams and plans… but the moment a freaking baby suddenly enters the picture, your whole life literally flashes before your eyes. I have so much more to say about this film, but I really wish they just focused on Sunshine being an athlete i guess. The side plots are kinda distracting.

Sunshine,"Sunshine leaned heavily on the acting prowess of Maris Racal, and at times felt more like a montage of stellar performances from its ensemble cast than a cohesive narrative. The story was messy, and the moral dilemma was problematic. Perhaps this was intentional: not to preach, but to spark discourse. Still, I find this approach risky, especially when tackling a sensitive topic in a conservative country like the Philippines.

Sunshine,"Sunshine is undeniably a political film—one that challenges the norms and cultural assumptions of the Filipino psyche. It is the kind of film that is marketed in such a way like an indie local blockbuster. Yung tipong kakagatin ng professors back in senior high or college and ipapa-assignment, and there is no doubt why many would watch it with unquestioning interest.Maris Racal delivers a committed performance, fully inhabiting a character who makes questionable and sometimes erratic choices. Her portrayal is compelling, yet it’s hampered by a script that lacks the gravitas her story deserves. While the film touches on important issues, it never fully dives deep, ultimately limiting the emotional impact.Antoinette Jadaone’s direction, though ambitious, is occasionally overshadowed by comedic moments that dilute the film’s central message about women’s rights. I found myself thinking, “Seryoso ka ba, Direk?”—because the challenges had already been clearly established. As someone who strongly believes in a woman’s autonomy over her body, I appreciate the film’s intentions, but the execution leaves the core message feeling imposed and emotionally flat by the end. Honestly, the audience I was with, mostly magbabarkada—kept asking, “Pinalaglag niya ba? o hindi?” “Open ended nanaman lagi yang director na yan” and it frustrated me, because even if everything was already implied, it signaled that there’s a group of audience that failed to get the message. Which then leads me to the point that the weight of personal choice—the triumph and struggle inherent in it—is never fully realized, which keeps the story from resonating as deeply as it could. Gets ko na, pero sana gets niyo rin.Sunshine is a film with admirable intentions and flashes of brilliance, yet it struggles to fully harness its potential. Actually, it’s a palatable film about that struggle. To say na ang tapang ng pelikula na ‘to is a feat that I don’t think it deserves fully. It is a conversation starter, but one that often feels louder than it is profound, gaya nga ng sabi ni Sunshine sa pagpalit niya ng kanta sa set niya — parang kulang sa heart.",2025-08-06,negative,0.7236083745956421,1

Sunshine,"I’ve been waiting for Sunshine's release ever since its TIFF premiere last September. With limited showings, the wait for a global or streaming release felt even longer. When Netflix announced they had acquired the film, I was excited... only to learn it was geo-blocked to the Philippines. But even with its depressing distribution, I can finally say I’ve watched it!As a woman who cares deeply about reproductive rights, the film’s subject matter resonated with me on a level that’s difficult to articulate. Sunshine arrives in an era where there's endless debate over motherhood, declining birth rates & women’s bodily autonomy at large. We're living in a world where conservative politics are resurging, where five years of Tiktok is undoing decades of feminist work, and where technofascists pour billions in service of a pronatalist agenda. In the midst of all the noise and the pressure placed on women’s bodies, Sunshine truly feels like sunshine. It’s a reminder of the lived reality of pregnancy: the physical toll, the emotional burden, the loss of autonomy, and the ways class determines what choices a woman can or cannot afford.Maris Racal delivers a truly compelling performance – her pain is honest and palpable. I loved the dynamic between Sunshine and Geleen; their relationship grounds the film. The scene where Geleen hugs Sunshine and promises to support her decisions no matter what is one of the movie's most affecting moments – an affirmation of sisterhood untouched by financial instability or the harshness of their circumstances.Could the film have done more? Absolutely. There are ideas that could’ve been explored further but in an era when mainstream studios and streaming services seem determined to churn out utter slop, Sunshine feels like a breath of fresh air. I also learnt the title was changed from Gymnast to Sunshine and I think it was the perfect choice for a movie like this (especially with that ending!). I’m grateful this movie exists and I’m even more grateful I finally got to see it.",2025-12-08,positive,0.9922630786895752,1

Sunshine is truly an icon for all women how we can reach our dreams, no matter the conflict. What upsets me is that sooooo many people don’t get the true meaning of this story, saying things like “sunshine should have made the right choice from the beginning” or something along those lines. People have to open their eyes to the reality that our options are very limited, especially living in a third world country with such a corrupt government, and how Sunshine was only a high-school student born in a lower class family with only her ate taking care of her.

Sunshine,"Sunshine and ShadowsSunshine follows a young gymnast whose Olympic hopes are abruptly derailed by an unplanned pregnancy, with a plot that resonates because it treats her crisis with urgency, clarity, and emotional truth.

Themes of autonomy, pressure, and the weight of expectation run through every scene. Acting is exceptional, with Maris Racal delivering a raw performance that anchors the film while the supporting cast sharpens the emotional stakes. The dialogue stays direct and natural. Cinematography captures Manila with unpolished grit and contrasts it with the rigid discipline of the gym. Editing is tight and controlled. Direction is confident and compassionate, balancing social commentary with intimate storytelling. The “it” factor is the film’s grounded honesty and relevance while framing a life in crisis with empathy instead of judgment.",2025-12-07,positive,0.987404465675354,1

Sunshine,"abortion is a topic i usually avoid because it’s morally, socially, and emotionally heavy. what i loved about this film is how it didn’t shy away from that weight, showing how complicated it really is especially in a conservative, Catholic society like ours where abortion is still illegal and pregnant teens are often judged and shamed. i liked how they showed that harsh reality here. and i also really liked Maris Racal’s performance, i think she brought so much depth and vulnerability to her role.i’m a Christian, so of course i have my own beliefs. but i do believe every woman should have a say over her own body. we shouldn't force someone into a choice they aren't ready for. if she isn't ready to be a mother, she may not be able to provide the care a child deserves. sometimes, the bravest and kindest choice a woman can make is the one who chooses the best for herself, who considers her life and circumstances. at the end of the day, it's not our body, not our life, not our consequences so we shouldn't judge. we're called to love, to show mercy, and to respect the dignity and choice of others. after all... autonomy is a lifeline.",2025-12-02,positive,0.9936519861221313,-1

Sunshine,"Men are in fact, disappointing. And so is the society we live in.One of the biggest reasons why the Philippines’ notion of sex can be described as ‘backwards’ or ‘two-faced’ is because of the fact that it is a predominantly Catholic country that has been culturally conservative and pro-life. Many pro-life institutions and religious affiliations proliferate misinformation on reproductive health. However, the film presents this juxtaposition of vendors selling abortifacients within church grounds, a stark contrast of what Catholicism believes in. I like how this element was woven into the movie. I also like the inclusion of the unnamed girl and ‘Ariana’ into the narrative. Though at first it may be confusing, I’d like to think that those kids were the unborn children of Sunshine and the 13 year-old Mary Grace. The scene where Sunshine was practicing and the unnamed girl cheered for her, and when Sunshine asked if the unnamed girl understands her decision - this almost moved me to tears. The movie hints that the Philippines is still far from being an ideal place for women and children to live in, especially when it comes to rights pertaining to their bodies. It also serves as a haunting reminder that once a seed is planted, whichever path you may go, every path is painful. And there’s no turning back.",2025-11-27,positive,0.6904659867286682,-1

Sunshine,"A Powerful Dive into Dreams and Despair​Antoinette Jadaone's ""Sunshine"" delivers a gut-wrenching, yet profoundly necessary, look at a young Filipino athlete's life derailed. The film centers on Sunshine, a dedicated and promising gymnast on the cusp of national team tryouts—her last shot at Olympic glory.​The narrative brutally shifts when she discovers she is two months pregnant. This sudden realization shatters her dreams, highlighting the devastating conflict between personal ambition and an unexpected life-altering reality.​Set against the backdrop of the Philippines, where abortion is strictly illegal, the film powerfully spotlights the immense social and legal pressures faced by women. It's a sharp social critique that exposes the isolation, judgment, and high risks inherent in navigating reproductive choices in a conservative society. The crushing weight of a lost future, compounded by moral and legal taboos, is palpable.​Ultimately, ""Sunshine"" culminates in a powerful and courageous decision made by the protagonist. This choice serves not only as a personal turning point but also as a stirring statement about resilience and taking control in a system designed to strip away agency. It’s a film that resonates long after the credits roll.",2025-11-26,positive,0.8945425748825073,1

Sunshine,"It's a first step, but a step nonetheless. In a country where abortion is considered legally and morally reprehensible, it's difficult to come to terms that ""abortion = bad"" is the norm, the standard. Women are made to suffer through it and because of it, and this film portrays that perfectly.I tell myself it's a first step towards delivering more biting, more critical, and more experimental works, because while Sunshine does an A+ job of presenting the struggles and suffering women in her position experience, it's only that. A presentation, however biting and cruel and very, very real. While we follow Sunshine's story, Sunshine feels like a mouthpiece than a character. We know her dreams and what she's willing to do to achieve these dreams, and that's about it. I feel like the film tries to deliver an generalization or capsule of why women's healthcare is not prioritized in the Philippines and what the general (conservative) opinion on abortion is, instead of focusing on Sunshine as a character, a nineteen-year-old who is faced with a difficult decision and how she handles it and how she experiences it.But anyway, this isn't a film that screams abortion is no sin and that abortion should be legalized, but it's a film that talks about it and it's better than nothing.I hope we get to see more films that dare challenge the conservative, sexist, and misogynist media landscape in the Philippines.",2025-10-08,positive,0.941016435623169,25

The production and idea was great, using the existence of sounds in movies was just an amazing way to represent her state at the moment and finally a Filipino movie that although it was obvious what her decision was gonna be, it still shocked me and I liked that! This movie caused me so much anxiety tho so will probably rewatch when I’m in a better mental state!And oh the portrayal of the kids was amazing, I got it ever since they had a dialogue but it’s really amazing that the kid not just represented the fetus?idk but also her guilt, conscience?, decisions? Idk like a lot of her emotions and I liked that even the kid knew that sunshine was the one to make the decision and not her and I don’t know I was just glad that she’s ok in the end",2025-08-28,positive,0.9975946545600891,-1

It is poetic that a movie entitled “Sunshine” premiered during a week when the country was between two typhoons while holding its own against two Hollywood superhero movies, “The Fantastic Four: First Steps”, and James Gunn’s “Superman”. Despite the competitive season, “Sunshine” managed to sustain a four-week run through active promotion and viral social media campaigns.

Ms. Jadone is a mainstream filmmaker who became famous for directing “love team” movies catered to the masses. In all honesty, I had little expectation going in.

It’s striking, considering the Catholic Church has been THE staunchest opponent of the Reproductive Health Bill in the country…Maris gave a great performance, though I feel like the unborn kids concept was stretched a bit too far and throwing in another teenage pregnancy subplot made it seem like the film was trying to cram in too many issues at once.",2025-08-19,positive,0.9721428751945496,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine, to its very core, is the type of film we so desperately need in this country. It’s a familiar yet socially relevant narrative that aims to eventually legalise abortion and decriminalise the women facing these circumstances. Props to Jadaone for championing this narrative and actually making a change through screenings with our country’s lawmakers. The film is at its strongest when it remains simplistic. Personally, the incorporation of magical realism through the physical manifestation of these children remain counterproductive and muddied the overall tone.I wish this film had a longer runtime and room for the other repercussions and consequences in the context of being a public figure in the Philippines especially in the pursuit of becoming an Olympian. I feel like then we can truly feel her obsession and the weight of the dilemma she’s facing. My last nitpick is the cinematography. There are so many scenes that I feel needed that extra push when heavy scenes unfolded. Especially during the ribbon dancing sequences. I just wished shot selection felt more intentional in order to make each scene flow together, considering the elegance of the sport itself. Small things like these can further complement Sunshine’s love for the sport.Regardless, powerhouse performances though from the entire cast especially from Maris Racal. Clearly a character that she carefully researched and eventually embodied.",2025-08-18,positive,0.9483101963996887,1

Sunshine,"inhalesunshine, like many teenage Filipina pregnancies, is a product of a failed system rooted in the patriarchal beliefs of a conservative country. it is diabolical yet profound to witness the realities experienced by abused minorities, especially young girls. this film portrayed politics, injustices, gender inequality, religion, passion, beliefs, cultures, and more.direk Tonet was able to encapsulate the imbalances not only in terms of gender, but in social class as well, something we continue to fight against to this day.in the end, it breaks barriers by delivering the truth that women’s bodies are ours. and it is our choice. and how cruel that women need support and rights (yes, how unlawful) to be able to make their choices regarding reproductive health. i believe this film also diminishes the patriarchal belief that being a woman automatically equates to being a mother. no. it will depend on us, not the society we live in.exhale",2025-08-16,positive,0.9491039514541626,9

Sunshine,"glad it's not like those other type of movies where the female lead has no choice but to face motherhood and forced to see the beauty, the silver lining, the usual ito pala purpose ko or na-realize ko 'yung ganda ng buhay because of a child.sunshine effectively embarks you on the same anxious and troubling journey of answering whether or not to do it lalo dahil nakakatakot at illegal sa batas piliin ang sarili at pangarap sa ganitong punto. sobrang on point ng mga lines ng bata sa kanya esp. on the first few scenes nila together. murderer... na isa sa mga usual na argumento ng mga taong nasa kabilang side. it truly is an eye opener for the harsh reality na pasan ng mga kababaihan at ng bawat desisyong ginagawa nila.however, there really are some awkward scenes. i honestly am not a fan of the scenes with the children lalo nung dulo. medyo awkward yung pagkakalapat sa kwento. but i get the point, of showing a different side---'yung realidad lalo para sa mga nasa laylayan ng lipunan. kung gaano ka-normal. kung gaano ka-hayop ang mga tao. kung gaano ka walang pake para sa kinabukasan lalo ng mga bata. even the scene with elijah and his father... it just feels weirdly inserted. and i just... couldn't feel her strong desire.. the childhood dream of succeeding in gymnastics and of being an olympian. her scene with the child --- kung yung bata man na yun talaga ay representation niya nung bata siya could've probably did a better job to unfold that part. it felt underwhelming nearing its end because i felt like marami pang pwede ma explore. medyo hilaw ang ibang parts. i felt like it didn't add anything new to what we already know about this issue. pero this film also has tons of strengths that's still worthy of giving it a try and seeing it.",2025-08-15,positive,0.8588057160377502,-1

Sunshine,"Sucked I had to see this in a theater with poor sound proofing, occasionally overhearing the crashing sound design of Weapons playing in the next cinema. Nevertheless, it's a gripping cinematic experience with convincing performances across the board. But what stood out for me is its provoking use of the locale. Manila is so alive in this film, capturing all its noise and dirt from the restless streets of Quiapo, its sketchy motel rooms, to the crowded and understaffed hospitals. It's as if the city is actively sabotaging Sunshine's Olympic dreams. And it's not just her ambition being stolen away but also her agency as a woman. After all, it's the city that produces uncaring doctors and breeds men like Miggy and Bobot, through its misogynistic and outdated laws overwhelmed by patriarchal and religious pressures. And yet, the film never loses sight of hope. In the same rotting place, Sunshine finds hope and solidarity among other women, from her caring sister and trainer, a role-model coach, a concerned friend, a doctor willing to serve unpaid, a street vendor selling abortion pills for a cheaper price, and even from a hotel owner who does not allow solo bookings in fear they commit suicide. The idea that goodness always prevails is expected for a film like Sunshine. Otherwise, it risks being criticized as another cynical and pessimistic portrayal of our country. Empowerment is the name of the game today. Still, I find that the film's shine dims, ironically, when it avoids bleakness. Which is why I find the tonal shifts off-putting at times. The decision to physicalize Sunshine's conscience – through the inclusion of an imaginary girl who keeps following her – resulted in scenes that felt incompatible with the heavy subject matter. At one point, the guilt-turned-child is seen getting a haircut and performing gymnastics while reprimanding Sunshine. It verges into quirky territory which clashes with the established grittiness of the film that resembled Brocka's social realist drama (I know Jojo Rabbit was an inspiration but Sunshine is not purely satirical for the quirkiness to work). At worst, this plot device unconsciously validates the argument of the pro-life movement that abortion is killing lives, even if unborn. At the end, the unborn girl says she ""gets it now"" as if permitting Sunshine to eliminate her. In reality, an embryo is merely a clump of cells incapable of thinking and feeling. Granted, it's all part of Sunshine internally and subjectively dealing with her own religious trauma, but it still leaves the film with a somewhat undetermined morality. Sunshine is not murdering a kid for the Olympics. And I know the filmmakers – and most audiences – know better than to interpret the film that way, but when even influential celebrities appear to miss its progressive themes even if they were supposedly moved by the picture, perhaps it indicates to, not the incompetence of the viewers, but the film's potential to be more direct, not in an unimaginative way, but directness in political conviction. Sunshine is a bold move, but it can still be bolder. But maybe this sets a precursor for these kinds of dialogue to finally take place in our country, and actually impact policymaking. In that sense, I get it.",2025-08-14,positive,0.8538544178009033,42

Sunshine,"Sunshine is, by far, Jadaone's most daring—steering away from the familiar terrain of romantic drama-comedy and into one charged with grit, hope, and unflinching honesty. At its core, the film follows the uneven arc of a gymnast reclaiming her agency amid the fractures of a rigid system and her own doubts. It is not simply about sports—it is about reclaiming space in a world quick to sideline those who falter.Jadaone's decision to root the narrative in sports is a masterstroke. Athletics here is not mere backdrop but a battlefield for selfhood—a metaphorical and literal arena where gymnastics becomes a language for autonomy. Instead of reducing it to spectacle, Jadaone transforms every stretch and pivot into a political gesture—a critique of structures that discipline bodies, particularly women's, into compliance. The message is not whispered; it is delivered through the tensile beauty of bodies resisting definition.Beneath its sunlit optimism runs a current of protest. It critiques entrenched gender biases and class divides without falling into sermonizing, letting action speak louder than dialogue. When the protagonist stands firm in a world that tells her to shrink, the film achieves something rare: it politicizes persistence. And yet, it never loses its warmth. It believes in ambition as a form of defiance.While the final act feels slightly hurried—resolving arcs with a neatness that undercuts the turbulence that precedes it—the journey there is luminous. Few films manage to be both intimate and insurgent, tender yet tactical. Sunshine does. It is a film about sports, but more than that, it is about refusing to stand still when the world insists you should.",2025-08-12,positive,0.9792556166648865,1
Sunshine,"better late than never, i guess.the fact that i was able to see this film three weeks after it opened in sm cinemas is a testament to the power of storytelling as a means to tackle complex topics, abortion in particular being quite meaningful in a catholic-majority country like the philippines. nearly half of the theater i was in was filled up, most being college students (since i had opted to catch this in an sm along the university belt). but the most memorable reaction i was privvy to was that of two middle-aged ladies seated a few rows behind me. during the film, one of them would occasionally mumble ""hala"" or ""naku"" at the main distressing occurrences in the narrative. given her age bracket, my preconceived notion was that these were noises of disapproval. only as we left the theater did i overhear the true intent - she told her companion ""parang si sunshine din ako dati"" and she said it not with any harrowing emotion, but casually, with a tinge of sheepishness and maybe even regret, as if it was a fact of life that took place long ago in her past and had faded into a memory tucked away in some cabinet in her mind. such is the nature of stigmatized issues like this one. jadaone's film shines when it allows the city and people of manila to reflect the truths that women encounter every day, from the closeness to religion despite its sharp edges, to the alternating concern of some strangers and quick condemnation of others. that's how sunshine breaks away from the sports movie template it begins with.but (and yes, finally, i am getting to the but) there's a certain questionable plot device used here that makes little sense. lots of other friends have said so, and i'd have to agree. personifying unborn children, to the point of dedicating a chunk of what was honestly a promising sideplot about abortion in the worst of circumstances, took away from the narrative rather than served it. there are moments where it made sense, a way to drive home sunshine's inner turmoil, but it overstayed its welcome, barely supported by the film's structure. it was a jarring choice in a story that mainly mimics social realist cinema and the thematic arcs of a sports movie (despite largely brushing over the specifics of a filipino student athlete's struggle - another flaw altogether). tl;dr: this is an ambitious work, and it could have driven home its convictions even more, if only it were not so keen to resort to choices broadly inspired by other filmmakers and sensibilities. sunshine is empowering as it is, but ultimately falls just a bit short in its vision. still, i am so, so glad it exists. maris racal was amazing.my full review(but also, take a look at mac's excellent review that takes an even deeper dive!)",2025-08-12,positive,0.8384261727333069,-1

But I did not anticipate some feedback such as, not having the payoff they wanted off from film. I think wanting a performance at the end for it to end on a high note is a tone deaf and takes away from the message that it frees her to do what she loves. Does it takes away the enjoyment of the film? Perhaps, for some of our moviegoers who came out of their way to pay for transpo, tickets and popcorn to go and asked to be entertained as a finalé.I like to think that we’ve come along way, but compromises are still needed to sell tickets. That did not take away my enjoyment of the film but I wish Jadaone had tempered down the magic-realism aspect of the film. That quiet moment with her elder sister was quiet powerful and I wish more of our local film maker would use quiet moments to create impact on their films.",2025-08-10,positive,0.800217866897583,0

Sunshine,"What a very confronting film. It wasn't afraid to show some of the contradictions and irony of the paternalistic Filipino culture - abortion pills stands near the church, medical doctors of science who are extremely religious, future grandparents (and coach) who only really care for their own image, and so much more.Some of my female friends told me they cried while watching this. I almost did as well, but I think this film just hits different if you are a woman yourself (i blame my cis maleness). I found myself feeling for Sunshine (portrayed so convincingly by Maris) - with all the burden, shame, and guilt she had to endure, for something that she should've been able to do with her own will in the first place.I haven't heard so much swear words from a Filipino film in a while, specially most were said by little kids, but I guess it added to the harsh and cruel nature of the film (and also little kids saying curse words so brazenly are funny I guess). But I really wasn't sure what to feel with that kids plot device (which to be fair I did not fully get until much later). I felt that it takes off a bit from the realism the film was so good at, but it was very compelling for most of the scenes.I saw this here in Sydney, thousands of miles away from home, in a group of fellow Filipino immigrants. I kept thinking how the film's core issue was being received (specially if there were conservative titos and titas) but it was lowkey comforting to be around so much Pinoys again, who I'm sure the majority also watched and supported Sunshine (both the character and the film) with an open mind.",2025-08-09,positive,0.9850524067878723,-1

Sunshine,"I've been looking forward to watch Sunshine because of its hype across social media— especially on Facebook. From other people's posts, the synopsis, and the trailer, I already had an idea what it was about and expected a bit from it.The film depicts the struggle of women— especially women in the Philippines— regarding abortion; including other people's opinions about your own body. What I didn't expect was the ending. Overall, the film was good. What I didn't expect was it revolves literally just around the struggle of getting abortion in the Philippines, and the struggle of being a woman in this society. Personally, I was also expecting more from the ending; it feels shortened.Anyhow, I'd recommend this movie! It was a good watch! :>",2025-08-07,positive,0.9954272508621216,1
Sunshine,"the story is really something that needs to be talked about. Maris is such a great fit for the role of Sunshine, she embodies Sunshine very well. As a man the entire agony in the chaos she is dealing with, opens up my view on how much I should champion more for women. I just like to nitpick a minor detail in the production of the movie, like the color grading in the confrontation scene of Sunshine with Miggy; and the scenes where Sunshine is training, if you have a good eye for small details, you can see that it was being done by her stunt double which I don’t have a problem with, it’s just that it is already going well but there are angles that it makes me wonder was it intentional for them to show us it was another girl who is doing the routine.

Sunshine,"Sunshine is a film of gestures—tender, tremulous, and at times, transcendent. Very few Filipino films dare to tackle the taboo of abortion so openly. But while it proposes itself as a daring reflection on female agency and bodily autonomy, it stops short of critically examining the material and systemic forces that make them, and being a woman in general, so perilous in the first place.The world wages war on women, and in countries like the Philippines, the battlefield is their bodies and nobody can defend them, except themselves. That's the thesis of Sunshine. But instead of grounding its story in the socio-political architecture of the Philippines—where the abortion ban preserves the state-church alliance and renders poor women's reproductive labor both exploitable and punishable—Sunshine chooses to dwell in personal emotion. Nothing inherently wrong about that, as it is just as important as the political. It actually hits very close to home, personally knowing women who have had to make these impossible choices in silence. However, the result then that we get is a film rich in atmosphere and affect but somewhat impoverished in nuance and context. We viewers are asked to infer structural violence from moody silences, bleak backdrops, and ambient dread, but the economic insecurity that shapes Sunshine's world largely remains abstract and unexplored. Her status as a decorated student-gymnast is stripped of its socioeconomic weight: no scheduling conflict, no public adulation and media scrutiny, no evidence of the extremely costly training such an elite athlete would require, no inspection whatsoever of how her athletic pursuit is ultimately tied to her material conditions, etc. We only see hints of these realities in where she lives, where she goes, and how she gets there, but the glaring absence of any meaningful insight into how she and her seemingly lower-middle-class family fund this vocation—or what hopes they've pinned to it—as well as her daily struggles as a teenager, blunt the actual stakes of her journey as a young Olympic aspirant with huge ambitions, now undermined by an unwanted pregnancy. Her abortion is framed as a personal reckoning, but the film somehow fails to convincingly connect it to her material realities. This disconnect is quite frustrating, not because the film avoids these questions entirely, but because there are attempts to address them, only to remain silent when it matters most.Antoinette Jadaone's use of magical realism then feels less like narrative innovation and more like gimmicky deflection. The film toys with the trauma of the Filipina facing an unwanted pregnancy but fully resists naming the forces that dictate it. Refusing to explicitly address even just some of the oppressive forces and structural problems that trap Sunshine—e.g., the Catholic Church's (and other powerful religious groups') political influence, the inferiority and inaccessibility of the Philippine public healthcare system, and the class dimensions of access to reproductive health—leaves its message emotionally resonant but intellectually uncommitted.Still, there are moments that land (especially Maris Racal's emotive, career-defining performance), but these fragments unfortunately can't fully compensate for a film that abstracts real-world oppression into mood, then sells that mood as meaning.In the end, Sunshine is not a failure of craft but a failure of courage. Its reluctance to take big swings is its fatal flaw. It could've been a more powerful, assertive statement. But what we're left with is a lukewarm social commentary that gestures towards discomfort but avoids naming what that discomfort is and where it stems from.I guess the public discourse and the private conversations following the release of this film are (gonna be) much more compelling than the film itself—discussions about choice, dreams, regret, and what it means to be a woman in a pseudo-progressive country like the Philippines. Perhaps this is a film that merely reopens important discussions in our society but never challenges the very status quo it tackles. But maybe that's all we need right now to start inspiring change in this country.Decriminalize abortion, here and everywhere.",2025-08-04,positive,0.6857733726501465,1

Sunshine,"something felt lacking but i couldn’t really pinpoint it, then i saw this review saying how personifying the lump of flesh in the characters’ wombs was such a weirdly pro-life thing to do. it reinforces the guilt that the religious people think we ought to feel if we decide to not give birth to a child. i also felt that this film was too two-dimensional and oversimplified (the same review i read mentioned that it wasn’t shown who earned for sunshine’s family & the repetitive lines of the religious people). it merely tackled sunshine’s ambitions as a gymnast and her unwanted pregnancy, nothing more and less, when in reality, it is much more multifaceted than that. the fact that it also tried to be a bit neutral by not directly criticizng religion as the cause of it all kind of just puts me off? on the brighter side, this has more capability to appeal to the hardheaded conservatives than other sociopolitical films that will shout right at their face. it reminded me of my experience of pregnancy scare where i decided that i will kms if it turned out i rly was pregnant. it really, really captured how lonely and scary it felt, but unlike me, sunshine had the support system and the means to abort by the end. it made me wonder just how much more difficult it could have been for those without a reliable family to get pregnant. it angers me how i could have been in that position—it angers me how as we speak, thousands and thousands of children are experiencing it. all for the sake of a system of beliefs built up for them to cope with the uncertainty of life; that that same system is what was used as a means to control and colonize us which we still perpetuate.cried to this in the cinemas with anhzel, shane and ynah",2025-08-04,positive,0.6008806824684143,-1

However, I felt that the movie missed the opportunity to bring layers of complexity to the plot.

There is so much potential to the film's last act to be more emotional, but the scenes are terminated early—just like the baby(ies).The film shines in the brightest in the acting department. Maris Racal, Jennica Garcia, and Meryll Soriano just lifts (and jumps, and flips). Was not a fan of the acting of the child. Her cursing at first is funny, but it's become a stretch by the end.

Sunshine,"I was going through a study just now for a work-related task I needed to finish, and I read something that made me think of this film again: *95 percent of Filipino youth disapprove of abortion* (how do you italicize text on the browser version? anyway...) Seeing that number shouldn't be surprising to me--I went to a private Catholic school until I was twelve and I grew up in an intensely Catholic household, surrounded by adults whose overflowing devotion often spilled into violent fanaticism; I went to mass every Sunday, made sure I finished my novenas before I went to bed, brought my rosary and prayer booklets with me everyday; Catholic imagery looms throughout every stage of my life and continues to haunt me, still (even in college I had bottles of holy water sitting on the window sills of my dorm room). I *should* know that Catholicism is so deeply entrenched within our culture, and that, of course, most people would disapprove of abortion because Catholic doctrine is so integrated in our epistemological structure that it basically wires the way we think and how we understand the world. I *should* know because up until high school, I couldn't fathom how other people don't consider the fetus as a full human being. That idea was unintelligible to me. Yet the fact that *95 percent* of young Filipinos disapprove of abortion (to be clear, this number varies depending on the given context e.g., if the mother's life were at risk, more people seem to be comfortable with the idea of abortion, although overall the numbers were overwhelmingly anti-abortion) still seems unreal to me, somehow. Maybe because I thought the world has gotten significantly more progressive now than it actually is. I guess this is why the decision to personify Sunshine's fetus and depict it as a fully fleshed-out little girl seemed initially off-putting to me. I just couldn't understand why a film that seems to be pro-abortion in its overall messaging would want to insert a plot device that seems to counter or undo that messaging (not to mention tonally incongruent with the rest of the film, which is mostly gritty drama)? But it does make sense. And I understand the intention behind that choice now. I think the little girl is less of a personification of Sunshine's unborn fetus, but more of a personification of Sunshine's Catholic guilt. Throughout the film, Catholic imagery looms in the background--we see it in her home, on the jeepney, in the streets. The film captures its embeddedness in Filipino culture in a way that isn't overstated. At the same time, it also captures how embedded Catholicism is in the Filipino psyche--and perhaps in a way that is occasionally overstated. Maybe there are better ways of showing how a young Filipino woman grapples with--and eventually overcomes--her Catholic guilt as she struggles for bodily autonomy, but personifying that guilt as a stubborn child and having the woman reason with it--reluctantly, aggressively, lovingly--also works (surprisingly well). I'd also like to emphasize how well-acted this film is! Obviously, Maris is the star here, and she definitely stands out, but all the background characters hold their own, even with such minimal lines and screentime (e.g. the Quiapo vendor, the inn receptionist, Rod). My only main criticism is that the plot point involving Rhed Bustamante seems crammed into the overall story, perhaps just to drive the point further home, especially for people who are still unconvinced that Sunshine's case makes abortion justifiable. And I can understand that, but it makes the film a bit too overstuffed for me, and the addition of Ariana could have been left out completely, since it was already clear what these imaginary children were supposed to represent.

Sunshine,"this is a story that is close to many women’s hearts. a story that we need right now with the rise on conservatism & esp with this issue still being as taboo as it is i think more than its execution, i loved the purpose. i loved how open and real and raw it talked about issues like abortion, catholic hypocrisy, even as far as incest which is an unspoken cause for many young women’s pregnancies in this country. i loved the gritiness it depicted manila. i loved seeing all the raw emotion and thoughts that come through a young woman’s mind when it comes to an unwanted pregnancy and how sunshine navigates a very self righteous manila. i loved seeing it all from the background of a gymnast/athlete who’s stakes are so high and who u can feel this story a little more because of the pregnancy coming at the peak of her athletic career. i loved the small pockets of refuge sunshine found in various women, despite it feeling like the entire world was against her and especially coming from her sister. this movie is not without faults though. i’ll be honest, i dont necessarily know what i feel about the child consciouness/magic realism. while i appreciate annika co’s performance, it also felt jarring in such a grounded narrative. i think the story is powerful enough to stand on its own, and i was made to believe this was solely sunshine’s story but it was more of sunshine + the girl with her presence being so omnipresent. i just felt a bit like it undermines the strength of the narrative when really, the film can move past using these devices. i also think the ending didnt stick the landing as much as i had hoped. i know this film assumes its audience to be smart & im grateful for that but sometimes it felt there was too much ambiguity/left up to interpretation to fully get into the story. there was just so much more to tell here i swear!still, like what i said, im a bigger fan of its purpose than its eventual execution. theres clearly so much grit and heart put into this film that i appreciate. maris’ performance here (& jennica’s!!) is amazing, and i wish for the two to have such a long career ahead. i cried so many times, i felt my chest hurting so many times, i thought back to all the times women in my life have talked about these struggles, i went back to a time i thought i was pregnant & felt like my entire world was collapsing behind me. this is a very important and brave story and the kind that we need right now more than ever",2025-07-31,positive,0.995086133480072,-1

Sunshine,"No pussyfooting. No moral tightropes and softened edges. Just a filmmaker confronting what many still won’t say out loud.SUNSHINE is exactly the kind of film Philippine cinema needs right now—flawed and sometimes didactic, yes; but also fierce, deliberate, and unafraid. Antoinette Jadaone isn’t interested in tiptoeing around which moral ground to stand on. Instead, she charges straight into the discomfort—of female bodily autonomy, of shame and silence, of what choice looks like in a country that rarely allows one.In a society still steeped in religiosity and conditioned to conflate questioning with sin, this is a film that asks: What if we made space for empathy instead?Jadaone may have just delivered her finest hour. And Maris Racal? The performance of her career.

But aside from her, Jennica was great too and I also love her character. The kids stole the show. It was just a shamed that I watched this in theaters full of men instead of women. I don't know it's just that the cinema felt to stagnant that time and maybe if I'm seated with a woman too that time, I would've cried more with them too. But that's another story to tell...

And what i admire it for the most is its bravery to tackle something that is truly taboo in today's society---and even more so in a country that hinges a huge part of its culture in religion. The point of ""Sunshine"" is to show you the reality being faced by women who are forced into motherhood just because the church and the government refuse to budge from their self righteous ground. To show how majority of this country sees the ""unborn child"" as human, but refuse to perceive the humanness in women, especially young ones, who are being stripped of their own rights to their body. Of course, they will feel cornered, and distressed, and forced to just settle it all on their own no matter how shady and dangerous the procedure might be. Because they are deprived of healthcare support and are even shamed for going through this. The film greatly tackles the rawness of that desperation to just...fix everything.You're just sure that so many filipino household that decided to watch this had polarizing opinions about it and may even have triggered an arguement. And I am glad for that, because it means Sunshine opened doors for this taboo discussion to be brought into the table. May there many more to come.",2025-12-12,positive,0.9673508405685425,-1

Salah satu film coming age yang cukup solid di penceritaan.Kisah Gadis muda yg punya masa depan bersinar mendadak mendapatkan musibah terbesar dalam hidupnya.Maris Rascal in the other hands, ngasih performance terbaik di film Sunshine ini.Emosi, gesture hingga rasa bersalah yang terus ada dalam karakter Sunshine ini dipotrait dengan sangat baik.",2025-12-09,negative,0.5963948965072632,-1

But this film bravely challenges those beliefs. I commend the film for questioning societal norms about abortion. Maris Racal once again proves herself as one of today’s great actresses. However, the film’s comedic timing is off. Jadaone’s humor in her romcoms doesn’t fit this kind of genre. She should have continued the tone she used in Fan Girl.

This movie tackles such important topics in a manner that just makes sense to me.For a country that prides itself on its gender equality—the Philippines being part of the Top 20 of the Global Gap Report—it hides myriads of abhorrent secrets that goes against women. This film places a pin on just that: sex being a taboo, ostracizing of teen moms, the weightlessness of men’s actions and faults, the catholic guilt associated with abortions, and the lack of accessible healthcare. Sunshine outwardly tells the viewers that women are allowed to dream, to put theirselves first before the gripes of society. It tells us that our hypocrisy—be it in our ethics or in our religions—creates a harder world for women to live in. You, much like Sunshine’s ability to change and choose her performance’s music for the sole reason that she does not like it, have a choice in what you are and who you want to be.

But surprisingly, my parents and relatives softened a bit — they're not totally against it anymore, which was a huge win.Really hoping more people can open their minds to this.

Sunshine,"“Ayoko maging nanay. Hindi ko ipapanganak ‘to dahil hindi ako ready maging nanay.” / English: I don’t want to be a mother. I won’t give birth to this child because I’m not ready to become a mother.Abortion is illegal in the Philippines, heck even being pro-choice here is looked down upon. Yet, motherhood is an expected life trajectory for many Filipino women, that is if you marry at the “right age” and have more than 1 child at the “right time”. So what choice do women have if they are pregnant under different circumstances? For a country that claims to be collectivist (pakikipagkapwa tao mindset ang dapat pinapairal, etc.), how can this principle become a universal behavior for most when its own government continues to throw its own citizens under the bus? Every dire problem that needs to be addressed can be traced back to how fucked Filipinos are by their government. Whatever rhetoric the Spaniards spread about Filipinos being “lazy” is still used today by the rich and powerful, their basis why the Philippines continues to be poor. Galit na galit ako sa nagtitinda ng mga pekeng “gamot” para sa pagpapalaglag ng bata, the review she showed Sunshine that it was effective could possibly be fake, pero narealize ko na nagbebenta sila ng pekeng solusyon para maka ahon sa buhay (not justification of this behavior). This government continues to fail people in every aspect of life, you’d realize why the crime is so high. But is it such a crime to not want a baby? (It is not).How can Filipinos truly care for the children (whether born or unborn) when elected officials undermine reproductive health in this country, primarily women’s health. The Reproductive Health Law faced a long legislative battle just to get passed, and it still took two years for the law to be fully accessible for the public.

Sunshine,"Reproductive health in the Philippines still has a long way to go. Unsafe abortion practices, severely misinformed women, archaic religious politics; there are so many wrongs in this country that make it harder for women to live. Sunshine is a movie that reflects how people and women in this country view abortion. This is evident in the imaginative character of the kid that Sunshine interacts with, which is her possible daughter in the future if she chooses to proceed with her pregnancy. In the ending, we get an assuring “gets ko na” which might have been what Sunshine needed to hear regardless if the child was real or not. I think this is an example of how we Filipinos view the nature of abortion, needing a verbal agreement from an unborn person before terminating. I’m not saying this is a bad thing, don't get me wrong, but I think it is an interesting portrayal of catharsis that Filipinos would resonate to. And it seems like it did.

The story is simple, sometimes too simple, no room for nuance and reading between the lines - and one device it uses feels overused (until that end scene). But it’s the kind of movie Philippine cinema needs. One that sheds light on a societal issue and gets conversations going. Jadoane’s Manila is tragically beautiful and beautifully tragic at the same time, bleeding with so much color, effervescence, but doesn’t lose its danger and darkness in every street corner. But the heart of Sunshine is Racal’s performance, showing us this is more than just the “abortion” film, but one that empathizes the plight of most Filipino women on what it’s like to grow up and live in a society that doesn’t care about you or your struggle.

Sunshine,"""Naiintindihan mo ba ako?""""Gets ko na.""See Greatest Filipino Films Of All TimeSee Jom’s Greatest Films Of All TimeOnce in a while, movies like this will remind us how great Philippine Cinema could be with proper production and marketing.Let's be honest, there are many films like Sunshine out there, produced and marketed independently. The talent of our Filipino directors, writers, and actors is flourishing; it just needs the right hand managing them. Studios surrounding Sunshine took a huge gamble promoting and marketing this movie, because they know how good it is. And it's that fcking good!Sunshine beautifully captures Sunshine, our protagonist, as she battles her way out of an unwanted pregnancy set in the cold city of Manila. This journey was documented with captivating visuals of Sunshine in the gym, in Quiapo, in a motel, etc. On top of this, this is unlike any other dialogue in mainstream Pinoy. The dialogue often has witty layers, purposeful intentions, and emotional punches.Maris Racal delivered a career-defining performance. This is not the same Maris Racal we often see in teleseryes or some other romcom movie. Her performance is an incredible take on such a complex and relatable character.I could nitpick some off details here and there which really bugged me, but I won't talk about it here as I believe that further magnifying this movie's success is what we should do.Sunshine represents every woman, every female, every girl, every lady of any shape or form. It brings up socially relevant topics and issues worthy of discussion. I am most impressed by its bravery to speak all about these, coming from a conservative country. Sunshine, the protagonist, showed bravery in confronting the stigma and the conservative norms.

Sunshine,"Beautifully written and made. I understand, Sunshine. Oo nga no’, women are always influenced if not forced to continue the pregnancy without asking them what they want just because society views abortion as “illegal” and religiously wrong. What if they don’t want to be a mother yet? People could argue that it’s their fault that they engage in unprotected sex, however, aren’t we bound to make mistakes in general, more so as a teenager? In the case that abortion can be abused, like aborting female-gendered fetuses. That can easily be regulated IDK how yet, but it’s possible.Women are more affected than men. The latter can easily opt out of it simply because they will not be the ones to carry the baby. This becomes an endless toxic cycle for women (especially young girls) to take the brunt for the absent of “choice.” So, they should have a choice now or we’re limiting their potential.",2025-11-28,positive,0.9861959218978882,-1

Sunshine,"I don’t usually leave reviews, but Sunshine stood out to me as such a critically significant piece in filipino cinema especially in a culture rooted in colonialism and christianity. I love how manila is depicted in its rawest form. Maingay, magulo, heck you could even smell it from the screen. It does not romanticize the city nor flatten it into a mere backdrop. The theme of Sunshine is something we rarely see portrayed in filipino cinema. It doesn’t try to force itself into the usual “blockbuster” formula, instead, it exists to open eyes and start conversations. Having a renowned actress like Maris Racal gives the film a real chance to break through and reach the wider audience it deserves.Now let me make a completely different and specific take. We often argue for the legalization of abortion for these reasons: cases of rape or coercion, inaccessibility of contraceptives, the lack of proper sex education, and the health risk that comes with women resorting to unsafe means of abortion. All of these are very very real, but we often oversee a simple fact —that many women are just NOT READY TO BE MOTHERS. Which is why the confrontation between Sunshine and Pastor Jaime struck with me. Simply because sexual desire is natural. Hormones, curiosity, and intimacy are physiologically innate within us. Yet discussions of sexuality are shrouded in taboo. Sex is framed as sacred, premarital sex as sinful, and expression of desire as something to be suppressed. Telling young women “kung ’di pa kasi ready, ’wag nalang makipag-sex” ignores the realities — not only of the youth but women in general — and places a burden of purity and morality solely on girls while the system fails to provide us the education, resources, and safe spaces needed to navigate this issue responsibly and safely. Regardless of reason, no woman should be deprived of rights over her own body. A right that’s still treated like a debate in a country where “godliness” is apparently put above the reproductive autonomy and wellbeing of women.",2025-11-28,positive,0.9916372895240784,1

This movie shows exactly the mindsets of Filipinos towards those two subjects, both are extremely negative.

Furthermore, a lot of people tend to shame these children for bringing more children into the world without even knowing the full story, leading to these children feeling afraid to open up about what happened to them — thus making them use extreme methods in order to rid of the pregnancy due to the fact that abortion is illegal in the country, as well as to avoid the shame that comes with people knowing about their pregnancy.",2025-11-27,positive,0.5076673030853271,9

Filipino women should have access to safe abortion services and we should have accessible reproductive healthcare. Thought-provoking. Intense. Honest. Yet still tender. The addition of the kid sometimes takes me out of the immersion but in the end it makes sense.But as a Manila girlie, the scenes where Sunshine is walking around Quiapo and especially when she is driven to the hospital… I can’t help but scream “Why are they driving her too far?!”Anyway, Maris is a revelation.

Sunshine,"Gets mo ba? Gets ko na. Long vent incoming…This film bro I have never felt something that raw and real and to think that this is what many women even young girls go through and the fact that it’s here in the Philippines is just so hard since everyone here is so deeply rooted in religion and shaming those who want to prioritize themselves and not to be held down by this fucking expectation na “magkaka-anak ka din balang araw” Even at my young age I dreaded the thought that I’d have to bear a kid and raise it someday because my family says so- everyone says so. But then again, why should I tie myself down with that expectation? Why can’t I decide for myself if I do want to have a kid or if I don’t in the future?Even up until now iniisip ko talaga na ayoko magka anak bc IN THIS ECONOMY?? IN THIS FUCKED UP WORLD??And it’s also not even that, I have so many trauma and issues its crazy  I think I’m definitely not in the right state of mind/mental health space to even see myself having kids in the future, and the thought of just repeating the cycle of trauma on my own kid in the future? That’s something I want to spare them from.This movie just HITS that spot. And you know what? Not wanting to have kids or being unsure of it, it’s okay. Because at the end of the day it’s your body, your choice. It’s okay to pursue your dreams and prioritize yourself. I know it might not mean much since hello asa pinas tayo ?? We need more people to be woke/educated and for people to see that not all women can afford to have a kid and some are forced to because of unfortunate circumstances and that scene with doktora in the public hospital and yung tito? KALOKA RAGE BAIT TALAGA but it hurts knowing that actually happens and the other choice you’ll have is dangerous drugs and operations that could very well kill you instead of being able to have a form of healthcare for women that could be much more safer and free from judgement… you’d just want to hope that in these changing times na baka sakali na maintindihan din nila katulad tong pinagdaanan ni Sunshine and many, many more other women, even young girls. And the presence of the kids as mere hallucinations and the personification of their What If’s for the kids, I have those thoughts as well but then again, like they say, I rather regret not having a kid than regret having them.

It's not literal, she's not ill in the head, it's a part of the story the movie wants to show.Most mothers from the previous previous generations have the similar story of giving up their dreams because they got pregnant and started a family at a young age. So Sunshine's story kind of counters that, which is really cool.It's very interesting that it's about a strong topic... abortion by young adults in the Philippines. I mention the country because I've watched other movies about abortion in the U.S., and it's nowhere near as sad as this. (i.e: Unpregnant (2020)).I personally know someone, although not an athlete, but went through this exact thing and upon seeing this, I feel more deeply for her.I hate men who don't use their brains, and do not care enough to wear protection. And I hate that women have to only either keep it against their will, or settle for this dangerous and illegal way to fix their problem. This is why it's really only up to us women to be definitely wise about our bodies. Be smart. Don't rely or entrust yourselves on these good-for-nothing men.Yeah sorry, this movie affected me. It's not perfect, but I liked it.P.S. that scene when sunshine finds out who the uncle was and hit his head with a bottle was absolute cinema. he deserved that.",2025-11-26,positive,0.9857831001281738,-1

Sunshine,"Maris the actress that you are! Sobrang husay! Ang galing kasi sobrang natural at nararamdaman ko lahat ng emosiyon niya. Hindi ako aware na nasa ganitong level na si Maris ng skills niya as an actress kaya sobrang amazed ako kasi ngayon ko lang to napanood. She really gave justice to her character, especially the angst of being an ambitious girl who offered a lot just to suddenly stumble and everyone turned their backs. Hindi biro 'yung ganitong role, lalo na at controversial ang point ng kuwento, knowing that many are still sensitive about abortion. I like that the movie addressed this issue and its conflict sa healthcare and religion. At some point, nabigyan ng platform ang perspective ng bawat isa. I just hope that someday, malinawan tayo na hindi palaging sagot ang pagre-reproduce. GUSTO KO LANG DIN I-COMMEND SI JENNICA!! Inulit ko yung kutsilyo scene dahil THAT WAS SO FILIPINO OF HER!

Like abortion, religion and lqbtqai+ (ariana being the representatio). What I love about this film is they are not scared to talk about abortion and they actually go with it, because we all know that abortion is a big topic in our country its controversial, cause everyone is so conservative and religious. I actually though that the ending will be like sunshine having the baby and did not abort it—but no she aborted it, and thats why i love this film its very open, sunshine is not ready to be a mother and that is a valid reason to begin with, to continue her own life and pursue her dreams.",2025-11-26,positive,0.9853296875953674,39

Perfectly captured the chaotic state of Manila. No filtered yassified version of the PH. Healthcare, the HEAVY ties to Catholism, the iffy streets (even the rats), the noisy cramped inn, typical Filipino houses. Spoilers:- I didn’t like the imaginary ‘children’ like why do they need to add that?? Like gets naman na personification ng conscience. Pero TOO MUCH SCREEN TIME I kinda dgaf about metaphors just say it directly. I guess they are going for a hidden message for the people to talk about her symbolism about her child?? But for me poorly incorporated?? Anyways just me nitpicking.- Doctors?? More like pastors. Hello? Idk if ganon talaga ka ass public hospital doctors but they missed the chance to talk about what the hell did she consume (pamparegla) to abort. Also, someone enlighten me WHY will the other dorctor lose his license for saving someone who attempted to abort her child? Its not as if he will be the one who’ll abort the baby?? Dumbass doctor- Minors getting pregnant through incest IS VERY COMMON IN THE PH. Loved that they add that fact to the film. - Wished they tacked more about their state of living not suitable to raise a child. But ofc another nitpick, her reasoning was VERY valid anyway. - Also, her ate is the MVP. Supported her no matter what im emotional. - Asshole boyfriend. He doesnt even know the pain and suffering she went through. But hear me out guys, imagine if her bf was willing to keep their child and she still wanted to abort the child?

Sunshine,"The film shows that abortion isn’t always the “bad” thing people make it out to be. For some women, it’s a necessary option especially when they’re not ready emotionally, physically, or financially to raise a child. But as much as possible, it’s important to avoid sexual activity at a very young age or when you’re not prepared, because every decision you make will affect the child. I also believe abortion should be legal, because in many situations, carrying a pregnancy to term can be unsafe. We need to stay open-minded and understand that not everyone has the same circumstances.The movie also highlights how close-minded some people can be, and how our local hospitals especially public ones still struggle with safety, hygiene, and proper care. Healthcare should be accessible and free, especially for those who can’t afford it. Decision natin toh pls choose the right thing. Always. Stay safe.",2025-11-26,positive,0.9483069777488708,25

Sunshine,"WOW!!!shet wtf ang ganda!!! teka waittt will edit this para sa review buzy langEDIT: ( so heto na nga mga bading)HI, SUNSHINE!It took me days to figure out how I would write my review for Sunshine. It wasn’t just because I was busy (gosh, I hate having an actual life), but also because I needed time to take this film in. Like I’ve said, IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. I really had to think everything through just to articulate exactly how this film made me feel. And once again, I’m haunted by the regret of not watching another absolute banger in theaters when it was released. I’m so sorry, Direk Tonet!! Sunshine deserves to be seen on the big screen, and I’m forever broken by the fact that I didn’t get to experience it there!!!!But enough of that already, let me finally get on with my actual review.First, I want to say na bilib ako sa tapang ng pelikulang ito, and the same sentiments go to everyone behind Sunshine. To talk about abortion in a country where it’s considered taboo—a very conservative, religious, and deeply judgmental society like ours—is already a risk in itself. Yet this film went there. And that was so, so brave, exactly the kind of bravery people in today’s generation need to see. Same with my co-letterboxd reviewers heree. You guys are awesome for talking about it! It genuinely gladdens me to see that most of the reviews here are filled with positivity and enlightenment. I love that so many viewers agree that what Sunshine did was not only necessary, but the right thing to do. A lot of us now are far more open and accepting, and many finally understand that abortion goes deeper than the knee-jerk ‘masama yan’ mindset many were raised with. You guys rock!Now, the film from beginning to end was—WOW. Grabe! Honestly, it was so beautiful, pero hindi ko pa rin maiwasang kabahan. I still had my fingers crossed because I really thought she might change her mind at the last minute and decide to keep Bata. I was scared that the film would shift from something liberating to something trapped once again in the usual Filipino cultural expectations. But thank goodness I was proven wrong. Also, I’ll admit, I was confused at first kung sino ba si Bata. Akala ko siya si Sunshine as a kid. Mas naging malinaw lang talaga sa akin kung sino siya noong dumating na si Ariana. But, mamaya na natin siya pag-usapan.This film is a powerful example of why legalizing abortion in the Philippines is important. With Sunshine’s story, being just two months away from finally reaching her big dreams—only for everything to be jeopardized by an unwanted pregnancy—is such a heavy and heartbreaking burden. And yes, her reason for not wanting to keep the pregnancy and become a mother is completely valid. I’m genuinely happy that she stood by her decision. Her dream is the Olympics, not becoming a young mother—and choosing herself was the right thing to do. Yes, she made a mistake by engaging in sexual activity at a young age without protection, but this is exactly where proper sex education should come in. If only our education system focused on teaching children about the things that actually matter—their bodies, consent, responsibility, and safe sex—situations like Sunshine’s wouldn’t be treated as moral failures, but as preventable circumstances. If we taught young people the truth instead of scaring them with shame, we wouldn’t have to watch teenagers face life-altering consequences they were never prepared for. Maybe then—if sex education were implemented properly—the chances of needing abortion might be lower (but never zero), and could potentially be prevented if it’s really that strongly considered sinful or unwelcome in this country, ONLY IF we also truly advocate for and implement proper sex education. But again, as a woman, not wanting to legalize abortion for any reason is beyond unacceptable. Legalizing it isn’t an invitation for anyone to engage in sexual activity recklessly, or to encourage others to go do it themselves, or whatever else people think. It isn’t about them—it is about a woman, a person, who needs hope, a chance, and a life that isn’t trapped in a cruel world where she feels neglected.(Shet, ang dami ko pang gustong sabihin! I hope anyone actually reading this can hang in there, I really tend to go on endlessly when I find something this interesting. At nag-explain pa talaga yan sha.)Now, going back to Ariana—’yung dahilan kung bakit siya nabuo is sobrang nakakapanghina. Menggay is only 13 years old. At that age, she should only be worrying about herself, not carrying a child. My heart completely dropped when I heard her age. Her body is only starting puberty, and to make things worse, it was all because of her own uncle. Tangina mo, Bobot! Whether Sunshine will literally hit him in the head with that bottle of Red Horse (?) or not, I’m passing the message telepathically to Sunshine na basagin yung bote sa ulo ng hayop na ‘yon. Kulang pa nga yung inabot niyang iyon sa kahayupan niya. tangina siya, tarantado!LAHAT NG MANYAKIS AT MAPANSAMANTALANG TAO, SANA HINDI KAYO MAMATAY PARA MARANASAN NIYO LAHAT NG HIRAP SA MUNDO, TANGINA JIYO.Now tell me, kung bakit hindi pa rin dapat i-legalize ang abortion sa Pilipinas? Ang story ni Sunshine at Menggay ay iilan lamang sa napakaraming rason kung bakit kailangan ng abortion sa Pilipinas. At ito pa, andito na naman sa pinakaayoko, ang ipapasa-diyos ang nangyari, na parang literal na siya ang bahala sa lahat. At kailangan pa talagang humingi ng sorry sa kaniya? Bakit? Para saan? Kapag tinuloy ba nila, si God ba ang mag-aalaga? Siya ba ang maghihirap for the rest of their lives? Siya ba ang gagastos? Alam niyo na ang sagot. Kaya sobrang bullshit to force Sunshine na magsorry kay papa God dahil sa ginawa niya. Also, just look at what actually happens to women in this country na nagpa‑paabort. Halos ikamatay na nila dahil hindi safe. And honestly, it’s so funny pa to think na sa tabi pa talaga ng simbahan makakahanap ng pampalaglag, diba? At kung ayaw talaga ng Diyos doon, edi sana, ayon sa logic nila, matagal nang nasunog ‘yung mga nagtitinda. Since ayun naman lagi nilang sinasabi, masusunog kapag masama (kaya siguro ang hot q).Now, with Racal’s performance naman. Baks, wala na akong masabi. Ang husay niya! I saw her video post talking about what she did with her script, and she said that after Sunshine found out she was pregnant, she went on autopilot with one goal, to get rid of the baby. And you can clearly see it in her character, present but determined. Galing! Wow k jan!!!Aaaaahhhh, ang dami-dami ko pa talagang gustong sabihin, but I’m pretty sure it would take me a month or so pa to finish. Basta, the bottom line is—Sunshine isn’t just a good movie. It transcends the typical. It breaks boundaries in storytelling, performance, and, most importantly, in social impact. This film makes you think, feel, and confront realities many would rather ignore. Sobrang Pinoy rin ng vibes niya. Have I forgotten to mention how ganda the cinematography is? Legit, walang tapon sa pelikula na ito. Sunshine is not only a breakthrough in Filipino cinema, it’s a bold statement for our society, showing that films can challenge norms, spark conversation, and leave a mark.

With its strong cinematography, blunt yet well-written script, and solid sequencing and storytelling, Sunshine stands out as anything but a typical Filipino film.Maris delivered a performance that truly did justice to the role, and it’s important to separate the art from the artist. The film has its own story to tell, independent of the personal character of the actress portraying the lead.I believe the storytelling could have been strengthened by presenting the sports aspect more clearly, rather than relying heavily on context clues. A more detailed depiction of the sport, and how it reflects the ongoing challenges faced by Filipino athletes, would have added even greater depth to the narrative.",2025-11-26,positive,0.9582492709159851,9

Sunshine,"I, for one, found myself questioning my values. Tanginaaaaaa, sobrang mararamdaman mo yung pagkatao ng film. Na hindi ka lang audience ng pelikula kundi kasama ka rin dahil mamamayan ka. Mamamayan kang nabubuhay sa ganitong sistema at responsibilidad mong isipin ang reyalidad ng marami pang Sunshine sa Pilipinas.Sa tingin ko kasi hindi mali si Sunshine, pero hindi rin siya tama. Kung right and wrong lang ang pag-uusapan, madaling husgahan ang karakter niya. Pero hindi. Maraming aspeto ang nagpapakumplikado ng lahat. Hindi iisa, hindi dadalawa. Hindi lang itim at puti, kundi makulay talaga. Wala ngang tama at mali; ang meron lang e kung anong direksyon ang tatahakin niya kasi either way, mababagabag si Sunshine. Kahit anong maging desisyon niya, talo pa rin siya. Noong eksena ngang naospital siya sa unang attempt niya, I was hoping that she succeeded. It was so heartbreaking kasi to see a young woman go through that painful process without anyone caring for her. With all the thoughts in her head and the pain in her body, it’s mind damning. Mamumulat ka talaga. Maaawa ka. She has a bright future ahead of her pero tao lang din siya. Bata. Walang magulang. Mahirap. Walang kwenta pa naging shota. Pero malaki ang pangarap.Basta ang hirap iexplain. Hahahaha! Marami kasing sides talaga. Iba’t iba ang naratibo. (Hindi ko na lang muna bubuksan yung sa kwento ni Red dahil ibang usapan yung sa kanya. Dapat sa mga nang aabuso talaga kasi . At I’m all for the victims erasing the product of evilness inside their bodies.) Isipin na lang siguro ng mga sensitibo pa rin sa talakaying ito kung gaano kabigat para sa mga taong pinipiling i let go ang mga baby nila kasi gets naman nilang hindi rin nila kayang magpakamagulang sa mundong magulo. Hindi na para dagdagan ang linya ng henerasyong may trauma. Enough na parusa na ang konsensya, hindi na para parusahan din ang magiging bunga. Wala kasing halaga talaga ang makakabili sa pangarap o sa kagustuhang maging ina. Ayun.KUDOS TO MARIS! SOBRANG GALING! SOBRANG RAW! SOBRANG SUNSHINE!!! Siguro may mga parts lang ng film na kaya pang iimprove PERO THE MESSAGE, THE INTENT, WHAT THE FILM TACKLES 10/10!!! KUKWESTYUNIN KA TALAGA!!!

Sunshine,"I was attending Jakarta Film Week and was queueing for Crocodile Tears, tickets sold out and I had to pivot to Sunshine. Going in blind adds another wow factor to this film. I was expecting something moving, empowering and uplifting, like a zero-to-hero movie, defying odds but what I get was pretty dark and bittersweet I suppose. Sunshine is a big surprise that it is very dark, devastating, heartbreaking but also extremely funny and comical. But it is very serious. It is very relevant to the current climate, where women in many countries are not facilitated enough, not enough healthcare for women and young women in general going through the same situation, abortion, and laws that strip away women’s rights and choices. This Philipphine drama really hits close to home as our fellow South-east asia country, that sometimes religion takes precedence over everything. Hiding behind religions and God, condemning others about their decisions, shaming others. Sunshine is very raw and blunt when talking about these issues. Sunshine should be a clear message to many countries how systemic failure causes damage to young women who is going through similar issue. Society fails to provide enough help and accessible healthcare, but also support from society. As we can see, there are only women involved in showing care and compassion throughout them movie. The only man, the pastor, even minimizes and belittles Sunshine’s choice to keep the baby. Sunshine is incredible, but its a hard watch.",2025-10-24,positive,0.9649385213851929,-1

Sunshine,"Jakarta Film Week 2025The existence of this film is simply a miracle. I went into this with only very vague knowledge on what it's about (although I do know that the abortion part does not come with a long-distance travel), and the turn in the last third is wholly unexpected. It's both comforting and harrowing, it speaks to the problems right-on while presenting that yes, there is a future where we will be able to choose.To be able to choose is to shine the light of sunshine. Sunshine and her sisters faces their burdens at night, where every choice they make will affect their tomorrows. But in reality, women are still unable to live with the freedom to decide for their future. If they can't choose to not carry life, then what about their future life?Why is it men who has to be the authority of life? To carry life is a burden that risks the life of people who has the ability to that. Why can't they choose to not carry the burden? Why should their lives be ruined for not wanting to bear the burden?This should be shown to teenagers, it's a shame that this gets slapped with 16+ everywhere (although the number of ""fuck!"" being spoken might be to blame). It's important while being artistically wonderful. There's a lot to adore in this film, from the acting to the humor to the colours, it's chock full of life. Though, some elements (the character of Ariana lacks a proper closure, for example) do avoid this film from being perfect.

Sunshine,"Ang daming kalaban ni Sunshine. ‘Yung sarili niya, si Miggy ang bumuntis sa kanya, Thea ang best friend niya, si Doktora, Coach, Kultura, moral, paniniwala, at higit sa lahat–ang sarili niya, the little Sunshine in her. That fight she took on was for the little girl who dreamt bigger than Manila could ever be. A dream so big and gripped so close to the heart, that it brought her to the stage she shone the brightest in. In the Filipino culture, where an already embedded Catholic belief system among Filipinos insists itself as a dominant value. Religion is the law–both moral and written. The system, therefore, finds itself an enemy to Sunshine. When your whole body rejects a value you’ve held onto as a child, you will take the pain of leaving your morals behind and choosing the path that feels right. ‘Yung labag sa loob mo, pero, kailangan mo–kailangan mong piliin ang sarili mo. In the laws of Religion, masamang bagay ang ginawa ni Sunshine. Disgraced by the OB-GYNE doctor from her abortion attempt, invaded by the Pastor and child to make negotiations for reputation's sake, and the stigma her fellow students held onto her for being pregnant. Hindi ito sakit. However, what stood out to me was hypocrisy. The Ate from which Sunshine brought her pills from in Quiapo reaps the benefits of both Catholic figures and abortion pills. The opposing beliefs and the lack of a moral standpoint are, in themselves, a belief. The birth of different belief systems creates a divide in the basis of faith. As for the Ate, she manages to capitalize on the ideas of both, prioritizing the capitalistic wealth over the spiritual one.",2025-09-08,positive,0.9186874628067017,12

Sunshine,"Raw, urgent, devastating. Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine follows a teen gymnast whose unplanned pregnancy threatens not just her dream, but her sense of safety. The film makes it clear: laws and conservative norms that say they protect often do the opposite, forcing women into danger and silence.Yet, Sunshine also shows the deep solidarity between women—holding each other up when everything else fails. Their strength is real, but it shouldn’t be an excuse for a broken system. Valorizing resilience without demanding accountability lets those in power off the hook.Quiapo wasn’t just a scenery. It’s a lived map of the problem. Crowded streets, devotional stalls, and informal markets where abortifacients appear next to religious items, showing how faith, commerce, and survival collide to leave women with few safe options. More than anything, Sunshine challenges us to face the stories we’d rather not see. Those stories that are real, painful, and demand difficult conversations.ABC Hall, Osaka, Japan • OAFF 2025 Expo",2025-09-03,positive,0.9401395916938782,1

Sunshine,"ON THE PSYCHE OF A TEENAGE GIRL IN A PARADOXICAL CITYI usually step into the cinema with my ears wide open for melodic or even textural cues, so at first, I was disappointed that Sunshine was not narrated by music.Yet, this film is a mirror to reality. What drives it is the noise of the outskirts of Manila. It perfectly captures the city’s paradoxes—how medicines for abortion are sold right outside the church, how even those we look up to in the pulpit sometimes abolish the very values they preach. And we see all of this through the lens of a teenager with big dreams, someone who has always been drowned out by the voices outside her own.I love how her sport, gymnastics, becomes a metaphor for letting go of the noise to hear that determined, resounding music inside her. Even the ribbon she uses in her routines subtly foreshadows the choice she will make by the end of the film.Kudos to Direk Antoinette Jadaone for being brave enough to tackle a taboo topic in a self-proclaimed Christian nation.And while the score isn’t the narrative driving force, the intentionality of using it sparingly only makes those few moments shine even brighter.",2025-08-25,positive,0.9758015871047974,1

Sunshine,"It's unfortunate that films like this aren't getting enough exposure and attention in the Philippines, diving deep on the state of our healthcare and belief.How bold, compassionate, and real this film is. The down side for me, personally, is the children in this film.

Sunshine,"as much as it tries to appease both sides, it succeeds in giving attention to the harmful effects of criminalizing abortion: people will always find a way even if it places them in danger. it’s a call to action to lawmakers to legalize abortion and prioritize sex education, as well as to shed light on sexual assault. what i particularly like is that it tells the audience that regardless of your reason (e.g. SA victim or dahil ayaw lang maging nanay), women should have affordable access to abortion. << another good detail is the subtle women solidarity that helped sunshine and mary grace >> while the movie succeeds in its objective, one striking detail is the inclusion of the “children.” their purpose is to show the guilt and emotional turmoil of the women, however they might also come across as abiding to the belief that unborn fetuses have lives. it pushes women to feel more guilty just because they want to save their lives and futures.still, it was a great and brave movie especially in today’s political climate.",2025-08-23,positive,0.9873784184455872,25

Sunshine,"Propaganda you SHOULD be falling for: Pro-choice and abortion is healthcare. Hands down to Sunshine, it perfectly depicted the many realities of filipino girls and womens who has and still continue to suffer by a long-broken and failing system of healthcare in our country.This film is a great opportunity to spread awareness, not just for everybody but for the higher-ups who have more authority in providing the necessary changes required to solve this issue. It's about time for all of us to listen with our hearts and open our minds to this kind topics that are very relevant to our society today. Another takeaway from Sunshine: Parenthood is not for everybody simply because not everyone is fit to be one (which is okay) and the sooner we accept that the better tbh.At sa huli, iba talaga ang sariling atin kasi grabe yung kalidad na kayang ibigay at ipakita ng pelikulang pilipino sa buong mundo.

Sunshine,"bata pa para magmura pero ‘di bata para pilitin na magdala ng buhay sa sinapupunan? maris racal embodied the cry for help that is screaming in every woman in this country. this is a movie that is made for all filipina, by a filipina, and through a filipina — sunshine. she is every good and bad and all in between this country is. mapapaisip ka na lang talaga na bawat mura valid. hindi natin sinusuportahan ang teenage pregnancy, pero ‘di rin ‘to dahilan para isara ang usapan patungkol sa abortion. dahil hindi sa lahat ng pagkakataon ang pagbubuntis ay bunga ng pagmamahalan, kung kadalasan ay may mga gaya ni menggay — bunga ito ng pangaabuso. regardless, a woman should have the right to decide. paano kung nandiyan na? nagbunga na? the only question we all should be asking is: what are the safe choices available to women when she decided to not continue? with all my heart, i am not ashamed to say that abortion should be one of the options, because it is healthcare.sa gitna ng init at madilim na maynila, ipinakita ni sunshine na hindi siya magpapatalo, kahit pa magdala ito ng panganib sa kaniya. she faced her adversities with grace despite her shaking nerves. and in that moment, i felt like i was there with sunshine, making a space for myself in that tiny filthy room. and i wish i was. i wish i was there to hold sunshine. that sequence alone shows that this country puts women in dangerous position — alone and afraid. when they’re supposed to be supported and cared for in such difficult times, not ridiculed and preyed upon. because a choice should not be dressed as shame, it should be shrouded with pride and dignity. amidst all the pain that is sipping from the story, sunshine saw that even in the roughest edge of life, kindness and sense of community in every filipino will always remain. it’s just that, in reality, the truth is not all women are meant to be mothers. especially not a child. despite the crazy scene between that ob-gyne doctor and sunshine in the maternity ward, i heard her loud and clear: “gising na ang bata”, nagising na siya sa reyalidad.",2025-08-17,positive,0.7767029404640198,-1

Sunshine,"From Jane in Fan Girl, Mace in That Thing Called Tadhana, Joanne in Never Not Love You, and especially Lillia Cuntapay in Six Degrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay, Antoinette Jadaone has never been afraid to push boundaries and champion strong women leads. However with Sunshine, she takes on one of the most urgent and most avoided issues in the Philippines, women’s reproductive rights. It’s a subject that still feels taboo in mainstream conversation, weighed down by religion, politics, and stigma, yet Jadaone dives right in, making a film that’s both brave and necessary.Maris Racal leads the film and delivers what I think is her best performance yet. She carries Sunshine with a mix of quiet strength and raw vulnerability. Every hesitation, every glance, every burst of courage feels lived-in. Alongside her, Jennica Garcia is a standout as Sunshine’s feisty sister, funny, protective, and fiercely loyal.That said, Sunshine isn’t flawless. One recurring element (the little girl who keeps appearing as a symbol) doesn’t always land. It does add emotional weight, but there are moments in the film where it felt like it's trying hard to be poetic which the story didn't need as it's strong enough on its own.However, there is no denying of the film's influence. Sunshine, challenges the taboo around women's choices and their bodies in the country. It shows the limits that society has built against them. It challenges the audience with the harsh reality of women in the Philippines, to empathize, and perhaps even to reconsider beliefs that were thrust upon us.The performances by Racal, Garcia, and the film's women ensemble were bold, the message timely, and incredibly personal. Sunshine, ultimately achieves its purpose of inspiring thought and discourse in the modern day.",2025-08-16,positive,0.9832358956336975,1

The story is somehow not new, teenage pregnancy in a religion dominated country while being torn in pursuing a life-long dream, yet it delivers a profoundly powerful message.

Showcasing the different types of women and the choices they make with the hardships they face. The actors did a stellar job delivering their roles with such depth but in a calm yet strong performances from the lead (Maris Racal) to supporting casts.Sunshine is a wake up call that choosing yourself before anything is not selfish.

Sunshine,"Sunshine glows with a quiet brilliance, weaving through the shadows of its heavy subject matter with the grace of a film that knows precisely when to hold back and when to break you open. The narrative feels unforced yet deeply felt, as though the film is simply breathing alongside its audience, letting the undercurrents of sacrifice, determination, and bittersweet resolve infuse every frame. It’s cinema that neither wallows in its pain nor shies away from it.At the heart of this achievement is Maris Racal, delivering what can only be described as a star-making performance. Racal inhabits her role with a disarming naturalness, navigating the character Sunshine's emotional terrain with nuance and restraint that make every flicker of joy, every crack in her voice, and every moment of silence resonate all the more. She doesn’t perform so much as she exists on screen, making the character’s struggles and small triumphs feel achingly personal. Her chemistry with the ensemble cast only amplifies the film’s emotional pull, but it’s in her solo moments that you realize you’re watching an actor step into her full power.If there’s a stumble, it’s in a sequence that leans heavily into magical realism and heightened sentiment: well-intentioned but a touch uneven compared to the rest of the film’s assured storytelling. Still, Sunshine’s value lies beyond its craft; it opens space for difficult but necessary conversations about the tangled intersections of agency and structure in abortion, religion, and healthcare in the Philippines. It’s a tender, unflinching work, and Racal is its radiant core.",2025-08-14,positive,0.9928773045539856,1

Sunshine,"I'm glad this movie's gaining the traction that it's getting. It makes for a tough conversation, but it's a dialogue that needs to be had. I watched it during its 3rd week here in the Philippines, but the fact that it's about to go on its 5th week is a huge deal! Things are looking bright.With Sunshine herself, I've never seen any of Maris Racal's movies/shows, but she definitely carried this movie. She showed so much vulnerability and grit, and I'm glad this movie didn't hold back with its punches showing the journey she went through. She was definitely in good hands being directed by Antoinette Jadaone.Having seen a good amount of Jadaone's movies, she really does well with writing female characters. She doesn't make a princess out of them in her stories, instead she creates such raw figures that are passionate but flawed. They're put out of their comfort zone, placing them in situations that give them a reality check that changes them. Sunshine, to me, is probably Jadaone's best, pushing those boundaries.Personally, there's a lot of love to give this movie, but the few things I'd complain about with Sunshine are really just nitpicks. First off is the use of code switching. Jadaone's movies aren't great with that, honestly. In this movie, it didn't sound natural and came off more theatrical, taking away from the grounded tone. It didn't make or break the story, but it did pull me out a bit. The other thing would be the use of a celebrity cameo. It happens during such a pivotal scene and I'm not sure if the cameo really had to be in that moment because it felt distracting. Either way, Maris Racal's performance was so strong, she brought the attention back to her.Regarding other things I loved about Sunshine, the kids impacted the movie hard! The way they were used to show conflict towards Sunshine's act of abortion displayed how sensitive of an act it really is. They bring up the conversation of choosing your own life or theirs, the failure of the healthcare system, and the type of pigs people can be. The conversation that struck me a lot was honestly the one regarding religion and how it viewed abortion. Being someone who's grown up with family members who have similar views, the dialogue sounded like an echo. Having seen Sunshine, I'd honestly show it to them in hopes for an understanding that there's more to life than scripture.Sunshine is another one of those movies that prove how good PH Cinema is at displaying the faults of the Philippine society. It has a stance and seeks justice. Hopefully someday, the freedom of choice is given and brings us to a brighter future.",2025-08-13,positive,0.9941816926002502,-1

Sunshine,"Read a lengthy review of this film prior to watching it and I’m genuinely glad I did not let it sway me. This movie’s far from what it is being criticised for; it demands something from the watcher, the whole thing is a call to action.I don’t think this is a film that you could fully grasp unless you’re well versed in the experience; sometimes your own body is the enemy, most of the time it is the patriarchal system that doesn’t grant you autonomy. Being in this body is a horror on its own and seeing those horrors unfold on screen made me emotional. The whole thing is heartbreaking!Tonet is an incredible director and I don’t expect any less from her. This was incredibly beautifully made.ADDITIONAL NOTES:- any movie that is set in manila is a film immediately close to my heart. - ANG GALING NI MARIS. mali ba ko pag sinabi kong i forgive her? not that i was ever mad anyways because she’s simply just too good!",2025-08-13,positive,0.9775955080986023,-1

Sunshine,"I approached this film with a fair amount of skepticism, scared how this film might be twisted into something anti-abortion/pro-life, and there were points in the film that made me question Antoinette Jadaone's true stance on abortion. This film is far from perfect, but it should not bar it from receiving any merit, especially from the local and international scene.Many people wax poetic about Maris Racal (Sunshine)'s and Jennica Garcia (Ate Geleen)'s performances, and I wholeheartedly agree. But, my favorite scene does not even center around the actresses. Maris Racal had very few lines when she walked in the maternity ward: it was framed in such a way that the spotlight was given to the mothers. In that cramped, underequipped ward, how many of them chose to be mothers? How many of them did not have any choice? What kind of socioeconomic condition are they bringing their children into? Is that in any way just or fair for both mother and child? This film is more than just about whether or not you are pro/anti-abortion, but what it means to bring life into this country. I hope people see the material conditions in which mothers are forced to raise their children, and how these conditions work against so many women who are just like Sunshine, Ate Geleen, and Mary Grace.Truly, this is one of Direk Tonet's best work yet.

Good pacing and direction, featuring a Manila that is one of the more realistic portrayals of the city in the movies.The thing that gives me pause in giving this a higher rating is the plot device used in the film. It worked out in the end but it's a bit too much for me at various stretches. That does not take away the wonderful portrayal of Maris Racal as Sunshine, easily the best performance of her career.This deserves to be the Philippines' submission to this year's Oscars.",2025-08-10,positive,0.9903061389923096,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine follows a young woman named Sunshine, an aspiring gymnast on the cusp of joining the national team. However, on her way to the tryouts, she discovers she is pregnant. From that premise alone, you can already sense the film’s intended message. The real question is—did it manage to convey that message effectively, and was it worth watching?Honestly, there were moments when I wished the storytelling had leaned toward subtler messaging. At times, the delivery felt jarring, with certain lines of dialogue seeming out of place against the film’s overall themes. The whole subplot involving the little girl, while clearly meant to be uncanny, didn’t quite land for me. I’m not sure if it was the dialogue, the acting, or both, but the scenes didn’t hit the emotional beats they were aiming for.The storyline with the pregnant child, which could have been deeply moving, failed to evoke much emotion for me. The relationship between Sunshine and the child felt rushed and underdeveloped—lacking the depth and “meat” that could have made it more impactful. And while the film did attempt to portray the pressure Sunshine was under, it felt limited. Aside from her coach and the broader societal judgment, there didn’t seem to be other tangible forces at play. Given her status as a decorated gymnast, surely there would have been more parties invested in her career and personal choices.That said, the film absolutely succeeded in its core objective: to shed light on the struggles young pregnant women face—the emotional turmoil they endure (a burden I would argue no man could fully comprehend) and the necessity of abortion as an option. In a society steeped in religiosity, Sunshine sparked discussions, provoked current beliefs, and opened minds. Was it worth watching? Absolutely—100 percent. Films should provoke thought, and this one certainly did.In terms of performances, I have no complaints about the cast (apart from the awkwardness with the child actors) and some peculiar dialogue choices. Maris Racal, in particular, was phenomenal—truly the anchor of the film. Her range and emotional depth were on full display, and she’s the reason I remained engaged throughout. Honestly, if anyone else had played Sunshine, the impact would have been far less potent. I even found myself shedding a tear by the end, purely because of her performance.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Sunshine in theaters—especially with the guy on the back's funny commentaryoverall 4/5",2025-08-10,positive,0.9572840332984924,1

Halos 1 year na since nagpremiere ito sa TIFF and FINALLYYYY napanood ko na and I’m so happy na it’s living up to its well-deserved hype!!!!!!!,2025-08-08,positive,0.9659871459007263,24

Pero isa sa mga bagay na sa tingin ko na nag pabilib ako lalo kay direk tonette ay yung mga bawat ditalye na nag pabuhay lalo sa pelikula,- Yung jeep na sinakyan at binabaan ni Sunshine na may pangalang “Gift of God” - ang Sto. Niño o ang the Holy Child Jesus na lumalabas tuwing nasa labas ng simbahan siya- si ateng may hawak hawak na sanggol habang nasa labas si sunshine at nadadasal- si Baby na staff ng Avenida InnIilan lang yan sa mga napansin kong very subtle pero may impact sa story.Continue ko to mamaya, pag tapos ko sa work HAHA",2025-08-08,positive,0.991606593132019,33

Sunshine,"On SUNSHINE by Antoinette Jadaone: A film can only get better not with its insistence on a belief but its provocation. When it does provoke, it lays down what triggers a conversation rather than merely playing woke. It tells us to look into the very fabric of our being: challenged, wounded, longing to have the freedom to choose. Not long in the film Sunshine (Maris Racal) gets on and off a classic puj with a huge phrase on its top front: Gift of God. The film uses a tool for contention against its voice, telling us it is aware of the moral indignation it faces.The film lays down everything in clear context: Agitated, confused, and lost Sunshine on the streets of Manila; by and in its proverbial structures (school, church, motel) with her dreams at stake.Jadaone captures Manila as the rightful milieu where Sunshine struggles to walk through cramped, narrow spaces in pursuit of her dreams which are challenged by society's expectations.This is cinema opening up a conversation that does not displace religion. It actually depicts vulnerable humanity, and the conditions that make it hard for people, especially women, to exercise their own agency.The film is especially brilliant in how it captures Sunshine navigating her choice and along the way showing empathy for others. The part where she connects with a young girl expands the film's statement on how women and children are left to suffer without much of a choice. I'm not crazy about the penultimate scene, though.Visualizing Sunshine's internal struggles through that little girl played by Annika Co is a good choice, albeit too much in the end. The statement in the penultimate scene need not be said as the two characters' gestures already speak it.The film should've thrown out such literalism and just allowed us to make sense of it without the words. We could've silently uttered them ourselves.",2025-08-08,positive,0.9640153646469116,1

Sunshine,"[Personal note: Ang cheap lang tingnan nung ending, parang hindi naman world championship, parang pang Purok Dos lang eh]But.. THE MOVIE IS SO GOOD. It talks about abortion in in a more deeper sense, but not that morally god-fearing shit that they usually shove to our months, but rather, it focuses on women, their dreams, and the healthcare that they need. I just wish that the Philippines will consider legalizing abortion and the proper healthcare that women should receive. It’s always been “how about the child?” bro, the kid wasn’t even born yet, but we tend to forget—the mother, who will literally carry the child, and motherhood? that’s not fucking easy. I love the little kids aspect symbolizing their conscience, guilt, and innocence, but I think they are more directly portrayed as the personification of the unborn child. and the scenes of Manila? this is one of the films that really captured the heart of the unfiltered Manila streets. The noise, the pollution, the authenticity, and the familiarity. “Gets ko na, gets na kita”That line in the ending made me smile. I hope regarding this issue that society still actively avoids, I hope sooner or later, ma-gets din nila why it matters.",2025-08-07,positive,0.9525280594825745,9

Kung kailangan na in your face ang atake at bawasan ang any subtlety sa mga pelikula to start any discussions between the church and the state regarding abortion, then so be it. will need to catch up on her work but Jadaone is brillant when characterizing and empowering females. flawed, pero may purpose kung bakit ganon. Annika Co is a revelation. I can't imagine anyone spouting out the lines that she said as someone as eloquent emotionally and intellectually matured as her. Also for some reason Rico Blanco's score sa una reminded me of Challengers (2024) maybe dahil sports and it feels electric. He should score more movies at baka maging katulad siya ng Nine Inch Nails or ni Jonny Greenwood na rock stars pero may ibubuga din sa scoring.Lastly, Maris.

Sunshine,"I went into this movie not knowing what it was about or what to expect. And when I found out that it was a local film about teenage pregnancy, I got vertigo from rolling my eyes because I expected a Ted Talk on abortions disguised as filipino acting (aka “ hysterics and histrionics).In fact I prematurely dismissed this as a hokey afterschool special and joked that they should have just called this ‘Maris Racal: Ate Nadali ‘ Well. Sunshine is the best example that nothing is as delicious as sinking your teeth into a wet, juicy wrongburger with a slice of humble pie for dessert. Let’s start with the performances. The acting was so authentic and so genuine at times it felt like I should apologize for sticking my nose into their conversations. I think the caster should also be given their flowers because I don’t think anyone other than the artists could have played them in the film. I expected Maris Racal to Rachel Berry her role as Sunshine but she played it with such earnest aplomb, she made her struggle so real and visceral, I still didn’t know how to handle it even if I was just a fly on the wall. Then there’s the (I’m doing the air quotes with my fingers) TWIST that Stevie Wonder could see a mile a way… but that really wasn’t the rug pull here. Actually it was pretty smart and meta that the rug pull was the fact that the reveal wasn’t a rug pull. At the end of the film, it wasn’t resolved if abortion is bad or good, or if the Church is unsympathetic or cares genuinely, or if teenage pregnancy is the choice of the mother or the family. And that lack of resolution is the only correct answer.",2025-08-04,positive,0.9297149777412415,-1

Sunshine,"In the 21st-century Filipino cinema, I believe Sunshine is, by far, the most daring. It tackles the struggles most women suffer in a country that suffocates them.It's baffling that to this day, the Philippines still does not legalize abortion, divorce, and same-sex marriage. All of these stem from religionism that was pushed down our throats by one of our colonizers—the Spaniards. And it's funny how all of these are legal in their country now, and we're still stuck and continuously regressing—all because of a belief and an intangible figure.And Sunshine was able to highlight that. The pressure from society and the backward thinking of its people—especially that certain doctor in the film—are among the reasons why basic rights and safer options are still being denied to women, why abortion is still being frowned upon.I hope more upcoming films will dare to challenge the status quo, without the concern of playing it ""safe,"" something that I think persisted somehow in Sunshine.

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone, one of the most interesting and exciting filmmaker working today is a champion of realism, and-or, telling the story as it is. This style compliments humor (Six Degrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay), romance (That Thing Called Tadhana), or drama (Fan Girl). Her latest effort aims to tackle a taboo topic amongst Filipinos, and based on her latest works it's pretty evident that she's the right person for the job.Sunshine is a neatly paced movie with a force of an acting from Maris Racal as the titular character. Jadaone managed to brought the audience into the streets of Metro Manila, effectively making the whole city claustrophobic by the help of sound mixing. However, I find myself not being a fan of some of the writing decision. First, it took me a long time to fully digest the Kid as a narrative device; I would've preferred a raw and natural point of view from our main character. This is more of a preferential complain and I wouldn't fault the movie for it, since I also understood what it's going for. My second issue is a subplot being suddenly introduced in the second act. It's easy to understand why they had to mix in some sort of parallel to make the subtext richer, but it disrupted the movie's cohesiveness and flow.Nevertheless, this movie exists for a reason, it already existed as the lives of many and will continue to be.",2025-08-03,positive,0.9379361271858215,-1
Sunshine,"""Raw"" — I think that’s the best word to describe this film.From the story to the cinematography, walang halong arte. I love how it showed Manila as it is.No filters, no polished sound. Yung kantang malakas sa jeep, videoke ng kapitbahay, pati mga batang sumisigaw ng ""Kuya, isama mo kami!"" all of it made the film feel real and alive.It’s a film starring a woman, made by a woman, and for women. It gives us a glimpse into the life of a Filipina just trying to survive and follow her dreams sa mundong puno ng judgment, lalo na galing sa mga lalaki. Imagine the struggle, for a choice to her body all because of patriarchy, toxic culture, religion, at expectations ng society.Pero ang ganda rin ng message: kahit gaano kahirap, ibang klase yung support ng kapwa babae. Meanwhile, yung mga lalaking wala namang karapatan manghusga, sila pa yung pinaka maingay.I watched this alone, but with a full crowd. Collective reactions were so telling. Tawang tawa lahat sa mga funny scenes, then eerily silent during the heavy scenes. Ang bigat. Sunshine represents so many Filipinas, lalo na yung mga walang privilege. Sobrang tumama sa akin yung take niya on Christian guilt, abortion stigma, at kung paano faith and culture, though well-meaning, can also be oppressive.Hindi ako babae, pero after watching this, kahit papaano, may nakuha akong kaunting understanding.

Sunshine,"I've been curious about Antoinette Jadaone's SUNSHINE ever since I saw the teasers some months back so I am glad to see it in cinemas now, and doing very well at that. First off, it's refreshing to see a Filipino actor commit to a role so fully whether its the physicality required as a rhythmic gymnast or the emotional demands of a complex character going through a tumultuous personal conflict, something Maris Racal did admirably. The movie happens basically over three days but delivers a roller coaster ride of emotions for Maris who is in virtually 95% of the scenes and carries all of the heavy lifting. SUNSHINE is also unlike anything Antoinette has ever written and directed and it is wonderful to watch her evolution as a writer and director, tackling such a sensitive and challenging material with sure handed confidence. Meryll Soriano, Elijah Canlas, Xyriel Manabat, Jennica Garcia, Angeli Bayani and others provide ample support but this truly rested on Maris Racal. This movie doesn't have commercial written all over it so when it succeeds like OPPENHEIMER or HOW TO MAKE MILLIONS BEFORE GRANDMA DIES, the performance is something to cheer about. The theater was packed [sold out], had an enthusiastic audience [a little too chatty with some commenting on everything going on] and the film was well-applauded as the credits rolled. Unlike many Filipino films that screen in cinemas but could just as easily be viewed in streaming, SUNSHINE delivers with full power on the big screen. I came in with little background except for the film's premise but was thoroughly immersed for the next 90 minutes. Aside from the writing and direction, the film boasts solid DP work from Pao Orendain and score by Rico Blanco..

Sunshine,"In an infamous spot near Quiapo church, ""Sunshine"" presents one of the biggest ironies in this Catholic-dominated country. In there, a vendor can be found selling religious figurines and paraphernalia, along with illegal pills and abortifacients tucked in plain sight. What’s more sarcastic is that a poster of ‘Abortion is Murder’ can be sighted on one of the stalls. If you’ve ever been to that place, you know that it’s all true.And so, teen gymnast/aspiring Olympian Sunshine (Maris Racal) searches through the alleyways of the aforementioned Quiapo for a quick solution to her dilemma. How can she terminate her unexpected pregnancy to avoid being disqualified from an upcoming SEA games competition? Director-writer Antoinette Jadaone has always been superb in writing female leads by adding deep empathy to their plight (as seen in “Fan Girl,” “Never Not Love You”). When you have a fully-fleshed character on screenplay, plus an actress who possesses the right amount of emotional depth and range, the resulting portrayal feels genuine and lived in.One of the film’s highlights takes place inside a seedy motel. With only minimal lines, Racal, in a career-defining performance, deftly showcases Sunshine’s internal turmoil and physical pain. Pao Orendain’s sensitive camerawork captures the whole ordeal in an unobtrusive shot. Likewise, his cinematography excellently mirrors the growing anxiety in Sunshine’s head, from the bustling streets of Manila to the crowded wards of public hospitals.Piling up to the metaphorical noise are secondary characters and conservative ideals that dictate what’s best for Sunshine. Admittedly, there are moments where the film could have represented the ‘pro-life’ side more nuanced than an ultra-conservative OB-GYN or a patronizing pastor, as depicted. But the film finds profound intent in the emotional journey that Sunshine goes through, with no sympathy begging that most advocacy films do.Hence, it will be reductive to say that “Sunshine” is just a pro-abortion film. Instead, it is a complex look on womanhood and pregnancy, and how the Philippines’ patriarchal laws fail to prioritize their bodies. It is also an admission of how Catholic guilt shames young women engaging in premarital sex, when young men should also be equally put into check.Elsewhere, Jadaone keeps a keen eye for casting an ensemble of on-point performers. Annika Co exemplifies the right level of abrasiveness required in her ambiguous role. Meryll Soriano brings a calming presence as Sunshine’s steely coach. Elijah Canlas and Xyriel Manabat are also effective in their teenage archetypes. And Rhed Bustamante will probably haunt the viewers the most. But it is Jennica Garcia, as Sunshine’s older sister, who lends the most empathy for our titular heroine. You can tell that there's an entire backstory not explicitly stated in the script. Regardless, Garcia’s performance carries the weight of the unsaid history. “Sunshine” did not win the Crystal Bear for Best Film in the recent BIFF for nothing. Whatever reservations you have in the abortion issue, RH bill or the need for comprehensive sex education in the country, this film is a necessary addition in feminist cinema. It plays a pivotal role in stirring up conversations on women’s reproductive health. By focusing on the human stories of Sunshine and the countless women trapped in outdated laws, the discourse reaches political without any pretensions. It is one of Jadaone’s most incendiary works to date.",2025-07-29,positive,0.8742620944976807,-1

Sunshine,"we really felt sunshine's struggle. the irony is incredible in using quiapo as the setting. in manila's most sacred place, that's where she finds what she needs.the noise in the entire film feels like it's saying sunshine has no time. everything is urgent, chaotic, pressing. there's no moment for her to process, to think, to breathe. even when she's making this decision, the world doesn't stop. it keeps moving, keeps demanding, keeps being loud.our country pretends these problems don't exist, but here's sunshine, a woman who has dreams, in quiapo searching for a solution to a problem that shouldn't be her problem if we had proper support systems.i like how the film shows us the reality with no sermons, no preachy moments—it just shows you what is.",2025-07-28,positive,0.9919021725654602,1

Sunshine,"""Gets ko na. Gets ko na.""Antoinette Jadaone's Sunshine sheds light on a divisive but essential issue regarding women's rights, particularly on access to reproductive healthcare. It may come across as a little heavy-handed for some (not me!) in its handling of an abortion story but it illuminates essential truths on the Filipino female experience in a way that's thoughtful, and beams with poignancy, and sincerity. Maris Racal shines along with a strong cast of supporting actors, especially Jenica Garcia. That Maris and Jenica scene at the last act of the film was very moving, iykyk. I saw the film with my mom (who btw adores Maris) and we were both misty-eyed during that scene.I just love that people are having important conversations about this movie. It's proof of the relevance of this story, and of Sunshine as a character who could be any young woman we may know of. So, sana gets na din ng iba dyan!",2025-07-27,positive,0.9952865242958069,-1

Sunshine,What shocked me the most was the scene where the story finally revealed what happened to the 13-year-old kid who kept following Sunshine. It took me a while to process it. The movie makes you see and feel things that remind you of societal reality. It makes you ask questions.,2025-07-27,positive,0.9101092219352722,1

Sunshine,"Quiapo has always been there for people looking for remedies, whether religious or not. A place of worship and of first and last resorts. A place for answers. Quiapo is central to Sunshine the character and Sunshine the film. The Quiapo in the film is the Quiapo i remember growing up. Gritty and dirty, but welcoming and warm. Sunshine was able to pack so many issues effortlessly without hitting you on the head with it. And i appreciate that it trusts the audience to make their own assessment as well all should. I'll be remiss if i didn't mention Maris and Jennica. Their scene was to me the best. [SM Light]",2025-07-26,positive,0.9941925406455994,-1
