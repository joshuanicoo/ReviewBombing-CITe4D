The Kingmaker,"This is the truth: This documentary perfectly captured the experiences of the Marcos and the exploited people. It showed what it is like to live with extensive wealth and how the Marcos regime used it for political power and their self interests.

This is a must watch film for those who wish to see the Marcos' perspective on Martial Law and their countless political movements.

This documentary shows the truth, through direct interviews with the Marcoses, and it is up to you if you are going to believe it. As John Henry Newman would say: ""We can believe what we choose but we are answerable for what we choose to believe.",2022-05-06,0
The Kingmaker,"Prescient and illuminating: As I write Ferdinand Marcus junior or 'bong bong' has been elected president of the Philippines, so it's a good time to view this documentary about the Marcos dynasty, its rise, its fall in the peoples revolution of 1986, and the gradual and dramatic rise again of its fortunes; in particular this film focuses on the surprisingly influential, some might say malevolent role that Imelda Marcos played. It's a shocking tale of shameless corruption nepotism cronyism and greed, at the end of which one can only feel saddened for the Filipino people, who have been used abused lied to and robbed over decades by their elite, and still are. Half of todays Filipino voters were not alive for the first Marcos era, but I was there in late 1985 and saw the huge disparity between the rich and poor, and just how hated the Marcos regime was at the time. Sadly all of that now seems to have been forgotten. If you want to know something of the true story of the Marcos 'dynasty' see this fine doc.",2022-05-10,0
The Kingmaker,"Privilege matters, Political horror!: Well worth watching. Amazing documentary about privilege and the sociopathic mindset. It's about a narcissistic self serving former first lady abusing her position. The film shines on the ugly politics of the Philippines.",2019-12-05,0
The Kingmaker,"Excellent insight into vile monsters !: I love the Philippines, visited many times and my longterm gf is there. The carnage left behind from this disgusting dynasty is there for all to see today in the form of vastly stunted economic growth down to the billions of dollars embezzled by these creatures !

This documentary is wonderfully put together but leaves me sad to see a country I am so fond of suffering even today from what these two people did ! Her state of mass delusion is clear for all to see in this excellent piece of work !",2021-10-29,0
The Kingmaker,"Real life political horror: Horrifically illustrates how a nation's collective memory can be erased in real time and the true limits of democracy in the social media age.

I liked how it started off making us think it was going to be a lifestyles of the rich and famous and slowly peeled away the facade and leaves you with the punch to the gut. Imelda comes across as a complete psychopath with absolutely no perception of reality. This is what happens to you when you drink your own kool-aid folks!

In a world where social media can be manipulated to create alternate realities, these historical revisionists will find it even easier to get away with murder. God help us all.",2022-06-08,0
The Kingmaker,"Very intersting despite being ruined: It is a story of how corruption enters a nation and stays there forever. The documentary is very intersting in this aspect. The maker of the documentary is very one sided and has little knowledge of the local culture. This is of course very irritating. She paints the obvious corrupt opposition as saints. Anyone wiht any knowledge about that culture should know how stupid the maker of this docu is. Apart from that, a very interesting documentary worth watching.",2020-08-14,0
The Kingmaker,"""Perception is Real and the Truth is NOT"": With the Marcoses' consistent effort to rewrite history, this documentary reminds us that behind the grandeur and elaborate schemes of the Marcoses are the stories of pain and sorrows of the victims, which are not mere perception but the truth. As Greenfield's style is apparent in the documentary, it did not fail to capture the depressing history of the Philippines under the Marcoses and what may be an apparent future if they were put again into position. The contrasting images presented by Greenfield is a great divider between Perception and Reality.",2022-05-05,3
The Kingmaker,"The Kingmaker - Film Review: The Kingmaker is a documentary written and directed by Lauren Greenfield. The film follows the political career of Imelda Marcos from the start of her political career with her husband Ferdinand Marcos, the fall of their power and exhile to Hawaii, and then their resurgence after her husbands death and rise of the political career of her children - especially her son Bongbong Marcos.

This film does a good job of contrasting the story Imelda portrays versus the reality of those under her rule. Imelda will say how great her husbands reign was. Then you have individuals speak about the atrocities of what occurred. I found the film very informative as someone who did not know about the subject matter going in.

I also appreciated how the film showed the current scene of the Philippines with Bongbong running for Vice-President (and who is President as I write this 6 years after the film came out).

Overall, I think this is a worthwhile watch to learn about the history of the Philippines political dynasty from 1965 - 1986, and then again around 2016. - 7/10.",2025-10-04,0
The Kingmaker,Uncovering the Fantasy World of the Marcoses: Brilliant documentary. It shows how much you can do with money; it can turn lies to history.,2020-11-07,0
The Kingmaker,"An eye opener: Highly recommend this. Like her or loathe her you can't deny the blatant pesos for politics. Watching Marcos hand out wads of cash to kids in a hospital ward in front of the cameras was as cynical as it was sickening.

I've never paid much (read: any) attention to Filipino politics but will be following along the 2022 election with interest!",2020-03-02,0
The Kingmaker,"Dark truths are there if your eyes are open: This is an incredibly well put together documentary. Imelda Marcos doesn't exactly shoot herself in the foot - she is too smart to do that, but you nonetheless get to see the realities she so flagrantly ignores whilst living in her self made fantasy world. How many billions has this power crazed matriarch squirreled away in 140 countries across the world. There are only 8 and a bit billion people on the planet and handing each one a single dollar might seem like generosity but this very much hides the manipulations of the Marcos clan. We note other world leaders seem to be in the same exclusive club as this gurning despot. Lord help us all.",2019-12-21,3
The Kingmaker,"Outstanding and riveting documentary: ""The Kingmaker"" (2019 release; 100 min.) is a documentary about the life and times of Imelda Marcos, erstwhile First Lady of the Philippines (1965-1986). As the movie opens, we are in ""Manile, 2014"", and Imelda is visiting the old neighborhood (the Presidential Palace). ""I miss the clout of being First Lady"", she laments, while wondering if her appearance and make-up for the interview is ok. We then go back in time, as we look at her very modest upbringing until she catches the eye of Ferdinand Marcos while in a beauty contest. Before we know it, they marry and Marcos vies to become President of the Philippines... At this point we are 10 min. into the documentary.

Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from writer-director Lauren Greenfield, best known for her 2012 documentary ""The Queen of Versailles"". Here she seemingly gets unfettered access to Imelda and her entourage, and she lets Imelda tell her side of the story, one in which of course Imelda is but a shining bright star in the darkness that is the Filipino sea of poverty. The great thing is that Greenfield doesn't have to ""manufacture"" anything: Imelda does it for her! Greenfield of course give ample screen time to opposing views, including survivirs of the Martial Lawera (1972-1980), during which torturing was rampant, And oh, lest we forget: the Marcoses stole an estimated $8-10 billion (with a ""b"") while in office. And if all of this isn't enough, Greenfield follows the Vice Predential election campaign in 2015-16 of Bongbong Marcos (son of Imelda), which itself becomes as revelating as anyting (just watch!). When confronted with issues of ""ill-gotten wealth"", Imelda simply shrugs it off (as does Bongbong). ""Perception is real, and the truth is not"", she states as a matter of fact. Hmmm, where have we heard this elsewhere in recent times? Bottom line: ""The Kingmaker"" is an oustanding and riveting documentar, period.

""The Kingmaker"" premiered on Showtime in 2019, which I somehow missed, but I recently caught it on Showtime on Demand and it is available on other VOD platforms too. If you have any interest in ""lifestyles of the rich and famous"", or how depots fleece an entire country for decades, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",2021-01-01,0

The Kingmaker,"Marcos Heist: One line that caught me off guard is what Bongbong's son said about his career.

Cause you know he wanted to do Physics, Math, Biology. But my grandfather (the late president) is like ""There's no money in that, switch to Politics""

That explains a lot about their family.

Precise and well-researched documentary.",2021-10-13,-1
The Kingmaker,It's not about shoes!: Loved The Kingmaker! One of those docs that start out one way and slowly reveal another darker side. And also one of those subjects so sure of themselves that they have no problem saying things that are incriminating. Imelda reveals a lot without caring. The correlation between her and Trump are closer than you think!,2019-12-12,-1
The Kingmaker,"It's not a surprise that the marcoses is paving the way for their return to power: This movie's purpose is to reclaim the narrative that the Martial Law is the ""Golden Age"" of the Philippine politics but it sure as hell backfire to them. The movie/documentary is well research, balanced and no biases towards any of the personality featured. Fact checking is evident towards any of the claims by Imelda that none was killed nor tortured that only good things happened during the regime. Personally, growing up I love reading especially history about Philippines so its not a surprise to me that the Marcos regime is bad but this information is inaccessible to everyone unless you specifically look for it and the gov't provided textbooks is riddled with wrong information.

Its now 2022 and the presidential election is coming and the son's dictator is running for the highest position against the same person who beats him during the 2016 vice presidential election. The tide is changing this time because of the emergence of young voters gearing towards the new wave of politicians but its harder to fight for votes knowing that the machinery handling them is leaning towards the Marcoses.

This movie helped me get to know what type of person Imelda and their family. Their tagline Babangon Muli is not for the filipino people suffering for the effects of COVID-19, its for their family to go back to the Malacañan Palace and get back the power and clear their names from all the charges.",2022-03-13,0

The Kingmaker,Marcos Regime the darkest in Philippines history: My opinion: The Marcoses siphoned and plundered the country's fund and Imelda is convicted with graft and corruption but she wasn't jailed because sadly that's how the justice system works for the powerful. Beautiful documentary.,2020-08-23,0
The Kingmaker,"Became president to maximize wealth: Imelda said it herself. Marcos wanted to be president because he wanted to maximize his wealth and talent when a president supposedly gets fewer pesos than a private entity execs.

This documentary offers an interesting take on the Marcoses. It serves as a prelude to the current political landscape in the Philippines. It brings two contrasting narration of events but with a nice treatment where the viewer, no matter how naive, will understand who's telling the truth.

This modern take on story telling is designed for the youtube generation. It quickly moves from one topic to the other so as to keep the audience attention. Didnt waste any minute.

The Kingmaker,"""Perception is real, the truth is not."" - Imelda Marcos in The Kingmaker (2019)This statement right here can sum up the propaganda that the Marcoses is instiling to the people (since the 1990s), the history that they are trying to deny, distort, and dispose, and their service that was never for the Filipinos but for those who are in their exclusive class (most highlighted by Marcos' quote about public service being a chore).Other than the Marcoses' edifice complex, the extravaganza, and their lavish lifestyle, Imelda's quote about giving birth to the world is one of her notable [ambitious] quest in the documentary. The tone during the segment where she [indirectly] states ""love conquers all"" while the extrajudicial killings during the Martial law as well as the contrast between the poor and the rich who uses them as ""props to display performative authenticity"" for their campaign played perfectly juxtaposed Imelda's quest. How can you call someone a mother who thinks that hurting one is a form of love? How can a mother treat those animals who she banished from their homeland and caged them in Calauit Islands to make a sort-like Noah's Ark paradise while she cast away those people who truly lived in the island from the start? How can be a supposedly loving mother be so cruel? Until today, the historical revisionism, distortion, denialism, and misinformation ran rampant. There should be a mandatory course or subject in elementary and in high school that will explain what happened in the 70s and until today. And not just with a paragraph [like in modules/book] that one can overlook and skip but with the details that engaged to the essence of the terror of corruption [checked by professionals in the field of history].The people like you shall not look for the stars through the luxury that was bought with taxpayers' money but through the grounds where you stand, through the land that was invaded, freed, and invaded again by its own people, and through people like you who yearns for a tomorrow where one can exist without worrying for their basic human rights and where the government truly served what it is mandated to be.But before you can look above the stars, you must open your eyes with the real truth initially below your radar. #NeverAgain#NeverForget#JusticeforMartialLawVictims#JusticeforEJKVictims",2025-12-02,3

The Kingmaker,"It’s easy to write about this film, and also extremely difficult. Personally, I’d rather talk about the difficult part. Writing an “easy” review simply means pointing out how the resurgence of authoritarian legacies is happening everywhere, and how films like this serve as warnings to the public. That’s a straightforward approach. But I can’t shake the feeling that if we rely solely on films to revive fear of past atrocities, the effect may actually backfire.

The Kingmaker,"[Nov 2025 edit]Changed my rating to lower it. A political documentary like this cannot be viewed superficially. Regardless how good the production value is, we shouldn't give platform to the Marcoses for them to tell more lies to our faces. Additionally, it doesn't sit well with me how foreigners seem to feature one of the darkest moments in our country's history as just another interesting subject for a documentary especially when this was shot and released during the Marcoses' return to power.Yes, it may have shown Imelda's bullshit and the effects of their corruption. But they were still given a microphone to blast their lies into. I think Philbert Dy said it best in his review:""There are no two sides when telling the story of the Marcoses. They stole from the country, and tortured and killed thousands of people. Somewhere along the way, the film seems to come to the realization that Imelda isn't the harmless old biddy that they thought she was. But it's too late. They talked to her, and gave her yet another chance to say the vile things she's always been saying.""",2020-03-22,0

The Kingmaker,"it deeply frustrates me that people aren’t as angry as they ought to be towards the Marcos family. this includes those who recognise their wrongdoings but simply sit back, because such lenience is what allowed the Marcoses to once again set foot on Philippine soil with no punishment. I hold no remorse when I say that, even at her age, Imelda deserves to bide what time she has left behind bars. literal piles of documents and other forms of evidence, yet nothing has been done? it’s even worse when people say phrases such as “God will judge (the Marcoses) when their time comes” ... I do not say this because of my lack of faith, but no human will ever be certain of what comes after, so how can we trust that they shall face their sins? why can’t we enact justice while they are still around? while there are still living witnesses to their crimes?I appreciate the subtle humor in allowing Imelda to spew lies, then immediately placing true, opposing statements right after (ex. when Imelda claimed that no people lived on Calauit island, followed by residents themselves speaking on how they were displaced). but I feel that this documentary was hesitant in really digging into the nasty details. these are general facts we already know (afterthought: I’ve realised that this documentary serves as an introduction for foreigners. still, it is not as critical as it could be). some may come out of this still having a neutral or even positive opinion on the Marcos family, especially with Imelda posing herself as this elegant peacemaker when she is nothing of the sort. the Marcoses think they are royalty when every bit of high-class society they got to experience was only made possible through the ill-gotten wealth of the masses.",2022-12-31,0

The Kingmaker,"A really really good documentary.I learned a lot about the history of my maternal country which I admittedly only knew surface level before. It didn't go super super deep into every historical aspect as this was more of a character study of Imelda, the charming, manipulative, flamboyant, delusinal first lady behind some of the worst years of philippine dictatorship. But it does go into the present day as well as talk about some of the atrocities of the Marcos dictatorship period. It makes me sad knowing that the country is LITERALLY repeating history because people haven't learned from the mistakes of the past-- because it isn't taught and propaganda is powerful. It also makes me sad to see the parallels between the US and the Philippines in this regard. Also gross to see how the US has its hands in the pies of foreign govts. Like we know that already but yeah it's just gross. This was filmed before bongbong became president and it warns us that it's coming and it's frustrating and infuriating.Anyway. I really think Imelda believes her job is to mother everyone, to mother the country. I think she really believes that is her purpose. But she's an abusive mother. She doesn't care about the needs of her children.Anyway going to high school in the Philippines was crazy bc I've literally been at the same parties as the children of these politicians and dictators.

The Kingmaker,"“Perception is real, the truth is not”I watched this documentary way back on December 25, 2022—the same year when Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the late dictator, won the presidential election. During that time, I was still grieving (and honestly, I still am) over the fact that despite his family’s wickedness, despite their crimes against the Filipino people—his son still managed to win.I was new to these things back then, and English was still a challenge for me. But when I heard Imelda Marcos utter those words, my jaw dropped. Every word that comes out of this woman’s mouth is either a lie, arrogance, delusion, or fabrication. It’s ironic that they gave her the benefit of the doubt, but it turns out to be a reason for us to hate her even more. As the saying goes, you can catch a fish by its mouth—and in this case, her words alone expose how filthy, hideous, and wicked she is.Although I was still new to in-depth politics during that time, I was shocked by how she spoke about some of the worst politicians of her era with such pride and admiration. Not to mention how rich she became, not through hard work or service, but through theft disguised as glamour.She’s delusional. You’re not mothering—Imelda, you’re manipulating.P.S. That Picasso painting cameo? It would send you to a coma. Just imagine how much money they stole, all because she wanted her life to be “Imeldefic.”",2025-10-26,3

The Kingmaker,"What I love the most about Lauren Greenfield’s films is that she lets her subject and the material speak so clearly that you can understand everything that she’s implying. The film opens up with Mrs. Marcos driving through an impoverished street in the Philippines, looking sorrowful covered in designer clothing and pieces of jewelry that could probably remake the entire neighborhood. She takes out her wallet and hands out 50 pesos to each of the residents who clamor to her window once they see who she is and what she has in her hands. Her hands move with the precision of a Coin-o-matic, only dispersing one crisp bill per person. This is all she can manage to provide and all she thinks the deserve. The film documents the atrocities, glamour, abuses, and scandal of the Marcos regime while covering Bong Bong Marcos’s bid for vice president. The parallels to America’s current fascist regime are apparent. The image of Mrs. Marcos that emerges is that she never grew out of the child who was abandoned by her mother and was not taught the true meaning of love. Love to her is money and show, not progress. Those who do not know the meaning of love cannot give it.",2025-09-25,0

This documentary was not just meant to inform the people; it was a warning a warning that the sins of the past would come back to haunt the Filipino people, and they have. In recent months, the Philippines has been marred by controversies involving ghost projects and corrupt officials. Yet, after speaking with many people about this matter, one question always prevails: How? How did the corruption, plunder, and blatant theft from the Filipino people become so severe?Upon watching this, the answer became clear as day: it is because we allowed those who started the problem to get away with it. We, as Filipinos, glorified the rich and powerful, while the poor who fought back were treated as criminals. The rich became gods, the supposed benefactors of the poor, when in truth, what they gave was only a fraction of what they had stolen. The Marcoses became the blueprint of Philippine corruption today. They set the rules on how to plunder the people. To fix this issue, we must first hold accountable those who began it in the first place.Democracy no longer truly exists in the Philippines, for it has long been the government against the people ever since the Marcoses were allowed back into the political landscape. Forgetting the past horrors, terrors, and sins has only allowed history to repeat itself. It may not always be under the same name or family, but it is carried out in the same way. If we want change, we must believe that it is not a question of when but of how. We must commit to a long-term process of change, not fall for empty promises. A nation cannot be built in a day, and solutions to systemic issues will never materialize in just a few years.Despite all this, I remain optimistic that these recent issues of corruption will open the eyes of those who were once blinded by words and false promises. The Filipino people should no longer be bound by biased perceptions; we are slowly beginning to see the truth. We are being played and I hope these events will finally serve as the catalyst for change: a change in governance, a change in mentality, and a change for the betterment of the Philippines.",2025-09-21,3

The Kingmaker,"""Now is what's important, so the past is past. There are so many things in the past that we should forget. In fact, it's no longer there.""The first time I saw this documentary was in early-2020. I was in the living room with my parents, my tita and my lola; they were all alive during Martial Law. I recall how annoyed my family were as Imelda talked about her side of the story and how ""sad"" it was to see the country turn their backs on the Marcoses. Even then, perhaps due in part to my family's influence, I was heavily critical of the Marcoses and their claims, as well as the rhetoric of then-president Rodrigo Duterte.This was months before the pandemic that was poorly addressed by Duterte's administration, three years before Bongbong would be elected straight to the presidential seat, and six years before Duterte would be charged with crimes against humanity by the ICC and sent to the Hague while his followers claimed that he was ""unjustly arrested"".I love the way that this documentary was shot. The juxtaposition of the lavish Marcos spendings with the effects they have had on the lowest sectors of society do a good job at providing insight into the sheer amount of ill-gotten wealth they have procured over the years. The intimate interviews we get from this documentary are also a huge highlight for me. It makes me wonder how the crew were able to get so many high-profile people for this documentary.In retrospect, it is almost horrible foreshadowing to see all this talk of BBM's race to vice presidency when he is currently our president. It's like he got what he wanted and more. What does it say about us as a country that we are willing to let the son of a dictator and kleptocrat, as well as their family, back into power? Or rather, what does it say about our education systems and efforts to retain the facts of the Martial Law era?To still see the Marcos family in power shows that they really did essentially get away almost scot-free. At this point in time, it is more imperative than ever to never forget what their dynasty has done to our country, and to never again repeat the mistakes of the past. I am thankful that from a young age, my family's stories and experiences living under the Marcos regime have been instilled in me. I am thankful that I have people in my life to make sure that I remember our history.",2025-04-19,0

The Kingmaker,"Funny how Imelda continuously presents herself as a mother figure not only to her own children but to the entire nation. She repeatedly emphasizes her desire to be a mother, a role she seemingly cherishes above all else. She claims that her love and devotion to the Filipino people mirror that of a mother’s love for her own children, almost as if to justify her actions and her family's corrupt reign. It is hard to reconcile her vision of herself as a nurturing matriarch with the devastation left behind after years of dictatorial governance. What a shame!",2025-02-25,0

The Kingmaker,"Portrait of one of the most irresponsible politicians you can imagine. Imeldas husband Ferdinand Marcos was democratically elected in 1962 and declared martial law in 1972. Freedom of the press was abolished and all opposition was nipped in the bud. The couple enriched themselves privately from the tax revenue and have been declared as secondary corrupt government by Transparency International at the time. In 1983, unknown killers shot the opposition politician Benigno Aquino at Manila airport, which led to increasing resistance among the population. When Corazon Aquino stood for election in 1986, Marcos had the results manipulated and declared himself the winner. Because of unrest among the population, the Marcos family had to flee - to the USA, where they lived in a palatial house in Hawaii with a good state pension. Imelda continued to claim that her husband was the Philippines' best leader, despite the couple's embezzlement of billions of US dollars (they believed the money belonged to them as leaders of the country!).She returned to the Philippines in 1991 and received a seat in the House of Representatives there. She campaigned (successfully!) for her son, who has been President of the Philippines since 2022. It is just as incomprehensible how it happens that Imelda is repeatedly acquitted in the (Philippine) courts.Imelda was willing to be interviewed for the documentary. The woman clearly lives in a parallel reality in which she was the kind mother of Filipinos and always did everything for the good of her country. At the same time, people who knew her talk about her blatant spending: She bought several houses in NYC and founded a small safari park on a supposedly uninhabited island. The 250 families who lived there were simply expelled. This park still existed in 2019, but has now become quite run down due to a lack of funding. The residents who have since returned are having a hard time dealing with the zebras and giraffes that are eating away at their gardens. boxd.it/bZCw2",2025-02-18,0

Pinaglalantaran pa nila na sila ay ganap na mga elitista. Walang bahid ng pagsisisi para sa nakaraan silang pinapakita. ""Past is past"" ayon nga kay Imelda. The absolute nerve and audacity of this woman to say these words and everything else that she has said are not just wrong but also criminal. Media platforms should really refrain from giving Imelda a chance or a platform to speak. Freedom of speech does not apply to this woman. In fact, she was one of the people who forbid this very right to the masses during the peak of her husband's power. Instead, the opportunity to make their voices heard should be given to the victims of martial law. Bulag at takip tenga na ang karamihan sa mga Pilipino. Nakakalungkot at nakakadismaya.

In fact, it's no longer there.""While I am against giving out-of-touch, manipulative liars platforms, there is something extra damning about hearing Imelda Marcos' version of events directly from her addled memory. She tries to come off as this sad, compassionate, motherly figure who only wanted what was best for the Philippines. But then she slips up on her words and the truth comes out. She admits that her husband wanted to become president to maximize his wealth. She says ""When you lose your money... I mean mother..."" Was that a Freudian slip? They convince themselves that removing people from their homes, stealing and hoarding the wealth of the country, and martial law were all great successes ""for the people"" while they still seek to steal and maintain control of the country that wanted them gone. They stole billions of dollars of the country's wealth from the people, and then she goes around acting sad that parts of the country are so poor ""now,"" as if she weren't directly responsible for it.And, just like the hateful magats in America, they've convinced people that they're what's best. That fascism and stolen wealth is what's best. That murdering your opponents and ignoring the people is what's best.There's a point early in the documentary where Imelda talks about her political contemporaries. She says a lot of people called them monsters, but she didn't think they were monsters. Lady, that makes you one of the monsters.

Now, as I watch this for the first time, he and his family have already comfortably taken over Malacañang. It was almost a lifetime of building themselves up just to arrive at where they are today. The 2022 elections felt like a fever dream, marked by a disorienting mix of nostalgia and revisionism. It’s troubling to witness how easily the collective memory of a nation can be swayed and history be rewritten.

Surely the mountains of crimes she has been complicit in, families destroyed, and lives lost should not get to be overshadowed by her lies and corruption, as it has for many decades.

The Kingmaker,"I generally try to approach documentaries with some degree of neutrality. But how can you do that with Imelda Marcos? In her introduction, she seems like a silly, unassuming old lady sitting in her gilded home and her many shoes, handing out pesos to street children with an air of supreme disinterest. Lauren Greenfield paints a complex portrait, peeling back the layers to reveal a dangerous, intelligent and manipulative figure. Greenfield and her editor keep the film's pulse steady, combatting each of Imelda's increasingly ridiculous lies with evidence to the contrary without feeling sequential. I couldn't believe my ears when she said that martial law was the best time for human rights. I found it difficult to watch. Maybe that's because of my personal histories. Watching Ferdinand Marcos' body be interred at Libingan ng mga Bayani, where my grandfather is buried, left a pit in my stomach. Hearing the testimonies of anti-Marcos activists was devastating. And knowing that I have relatives, including my mother, who remain vocal loyalists and direct victims of the disinformation and whitewashing campaigns that are at the center of this film was another gut punch.The film was completed in 2019 and leaves off on Leni Robredo's victory over BBM in the VP election. It seems that democracy prevailed, and presents like a cautionary tale of the Marcoses; of what can be done when political dynasties are left unchecked with power and influence. As if Greenfield is wagging her finger saying, ""don't do what the Filipinos did!"" But listening to BBM ramble about stolen elections a full four years before Trump sent a chill down my spine. The propaganda and historical revisionism. The cult of personality. The militarization of the police. It's extra-haunting to see this in 2024, knowing that my family's motherland is under the thumb of the Marcoses again.Well-made, prescient and powerful.",2024-06-27,0

The Kingmaker,"[To an assistant in a hospital room full of potentially terminally ill children] ""Give me some money to give away.""Maybe not the best day for me to watch this, but it's one of the last Showtime docs I had queued up before the app goes kaput. The film was captivating, concerning, and strange, but it's also more curious to watch in 2023, after the Marcos family resumed control of the Filipino government last year (via son Bongbong, who appears here)... So much feels telegraphed in hindsight when they get to talking about Bongbong and his then-Vice President campaign... I have no idea if this film gained exposure over there or not, and it looks like the Marcoses had traction there regardless, but I can't help but wonder if putting this lady and her family back in the limelight didn't help gain some eyes, in spite of the film's potential intent. I know it's a different political sphere and culture (though, naturally the US is linked to all of this), but I feel the same way about the exposure of eccentrics like Tr*mp, who never would have made it into office if the media didn't constantly stick a camera on them wondering ""What kooky thing will they say next??"" with total disregard to the fact that a large sum of people will not grasp the irony and fully agree with otherwise outlandish and dangerous views. Fully complicit for the sake of ratings. But here we are... a year away from doing it all over again.

The Kingmaker,"Imelda Marcos continues to charm and astonish well into her eighties. It's easy to see how she wielded so much power during her husband's dictatorship. She's so sure of herself - but her language betrays such a lack of self-awareness and shame. Her story, so important to the modern political reality in the Philippines, was so carefully told to cover both the past and the present and how intricately wound they are. Brilliant to interweave the horrors of martial law in the 1970s with the rise of Bongbong (who really comes across as a doltish, boyish, puppet version of his dad) and Duterte (...yuck).The Philippines has suffered from such rampant corruption with essentially only the Aquinos offering a brief respite during the presidencies of Cory and Noynoy (the latter of which is featured in this documentary and is quite an eloquent dude). Seeing the Marcoses claw their way back to power by financing Duterte's campaign and now, of course, with Bongbong as president, I am very troubled for the future of this much abused, but beautiful and resilient country.",2023-11-07,0

At nakakatakot siya, actually. Kasi nababahiran ng vulnerability at humanity ang pamilyang Marcos, ‘yung parehong pamilyang nanudla, nagnakaw, at nagpahirap sa Pilipinas noong diktaturya ni Marcos Sr. (at patuloy na nagpapahirap sa bansa ngayon sa termino ni Marcos Jr.) Nahuhumanize ‘yung elitist tendencies ni Imelda, najujustify ‘yung paglabag ni Marcos Sr. sa mga karapatang pantao noong Batas Militar, at nacocontextualize ‘yung pagkaganid nila sa kapangyarihan, which, if not viewed critically, ay napakadelikado dahil nakapanlilinlang. Mistulang hindi buo ‘yung pagkukuwento dito sa dokumentaryo kasi halos lahat ng narratives ay galing sa very oppressors na nagpahirap sa Pilipinas. Kulang bilang pambalanse ‘yung critical lens from Martial Law victims na inabuso at tinanggalan ng dignidad ng diktaturyang Marcos. Napakadelikadong uri ng pagsasalaysay muli sa napakasensitibong bahagi ng kasaysayan natin, dahil ang pangunahing mga tagakuwento ay hindi ang mga Pilipino, kundi ‘yung mga nagpapahirap sa mga Pilipino noong panahong iyon.#MarcosNotAHero #MarcosDuterteWalangPinagIba",2023-11-04,1

The Kingmaker,"As a social studies teacher, I help students sharpen their critical thinking skills by presenting them facts and figures to guide them in forming their own conclusions. I don't infiltrate to them my own viewpoints, for it may influence their own views. I want my students to form their own opinions and make sure that they are based on facts and empirical evidence. This is exactly how Lauren Greenfield's The Kingmaker presented one of history's most divisive topic. It is a documentary where you see the camera roll and witness the actions speak for themselves. There is no narration, no reenactments, no script, and no talking heads. The main subjects themselves, the Marcos Family (mostly Imelda Marcos) are the ones narrating the entire story. The camera is basically a fly on the wall. Real footages and records from the exact events are also shown. I've also read that the intended direction of the film depends on how interviews went. This means the film does not intentionally gear towards one side of the story only, as both the Marcoses side, the victims, and the witnesses were evenly presented. The result? A compelling story of a true event that almost feels like fiction due to its shocking and unbelievable accounts. It makes you wonder why the Marcoses agree to be the subject of this documentary and how they feel about this.This educational documentary might be a hard watch for some, and I highly advice that the best way to watch this is to have an open mind, without any pre-conceived notions about what the show is about.

Bongbong’s life story is very typical of that movie of an almost-neglected middle child of a busy, powerful, and rich parents always in his earnest to make them proud and has since poised himself to never disappoint his parents whom he craves one thing and one thing only: parental love3. Bongbong would make a better politician than Imee4. Another Marcos cannot be allowed to hold the presidential seat5. The Filipinos people lack better judgment; they need to be educated more of the atrocities of the Marcos regime6. Imelda has a hold of those ill-gotten wealth and she’s just waiting for any of her children to be in the presidential seat so she can use them those money to redeem her family’s name7.

The Kingmaker,"I am quite ambivalent towards this documentary. It is very well-made however I struggle to see the benefit of giving Imelda Marcos a platform to spout her shameless lies about her husband's totalitarian rule and juxtaposing it with the objective truth of history while somewhat giving off the impression that both outlooks are equal in their merit. Apparently some Marcos apologists enjoyed this movie because of that. Still, I can sort of see the value of this work as an educational resource for the perspective of a foreigner wishing to know more about the history of this corrupt, kleptocratic family. As a Filipino however, the way the documentary presents itself just rubs me the wrong way. Nonetheless, I commend the documentary's objective of educating foreigners about the dire situation here in the Philippines where thieves are worshipped as idols and the corrupt elite manage to evade justice at every turn.",2023-08-02,0

(putanginang isa pa yang si duterte. tas ayon ung anak naging vp fuck)di ko na lang talaga alam kahahantungan ng bansang to. palagi na lang tayong lugmok sa ilalim ng walang sawang korapsyon. the rich will only get richer and the poor will only get poorer. nakakalungkot na nakakagalit.",2023-07-29,2

The Kingmaker,"Watching the documentary, I am simply in disbelief that the side of the Marcos family here was supposed to be painted as if they were actually something good that happened to the Philippines. When in fact, watching this whole documentary, I just learned even more about the atrocious things they have done and thus have manifested even greater anger towards their name and family—naïvely thinking that I already knew enough about their history and was also already angry enough back then. I have to say though that the documentary shows more than simply just the story of the Marcos family and their history. After watching it, I now have realized for sure as well that the Filipino people are too forgiving, too forgetful, and too naïve. And to back that statement up, with no better proof to be given, other than that their family has already been back in power with another Marcos being the president for more than a year now as of the writing of this review. Which is all just really sad to think about—that this is the reality we're living with right now as Filipinos.It was certainly all kinds of emotions that I have felt watching this documentary. With some of it being that of utter disgust towards the Marcos family, our politics, and overall just feeling really bad for our fellow Filipinos. We truly did not deserve any of this or do we deserve yet another Marcos being back in power for that matter. The Marcos family are not even good nor wise politicians in the first place, for they did and were doing much of the atrocious stuff in broad daylight. They were just lucky they were able to prey on the fragility of the Filipino people when it comes to being politically aware. Which is yet another lengthy and very nuanced topic that deserves its separate discussion if I wanted to give it proper justice. But welp, that's the simple gist of it. The Filipino people are naïve, and that naïvety of ours is so easily preyed upon by these people in power. I can only wish and hope that we'll soon know better as a country and as the citizens of it.Anyhow, I do think that this documentary is a must watch, for better or for worse especially for us Filipinos. Just be sure to watch it with an open mind, because you are sure to be taken for quite the ride throughout, and maybe after it—you'll come out with newfound insights regarding this very important and especially relevant point of history in our country.Imelda Marcos said at one point in the documentary that, ""Perception is real, and the truth is not"" but I will argue that no matter how our perception wants to change the truth, or perceive that something is the truth instead of the other—that the truth of this controversial point of our history and the truth of the revolting history of their family—will continue to exist despite efforts of trying to perceive them the other way to bring upon a new narrative. We, the people that do remember and know will never dare to erase and forget it. #NeverForget & #NeverAgain",2023-07-02,0
The Kingmaker,"I understand why some people are morally opposed to Imelda being documented like this. However, I think it clearly shows how she and Ferdinand were able to gain and keep control in the Philippines before martial law and ward off opposition during it, besides just the killing (which is very bad). It also is important because clearly, people bought into her mirage again when Bongbong was elected. So if we can see her in a complete light like this, we can hopefully learn how to recognize players like Imelda and avoid getting roped in ourselves.",2023-06-01,0

The Kingmaker,"This film has more in common with Darren Aronofsky's ""Mother,"" than the director's previous ""Queen of Versailles."" The legacy of the Marcos family is one of plunder and terror, charity (or ""projects"" as Imelda calls it) is merely a tool of reputation laundering. That shows clearly in this film. Imelda Marcos is a narcissistic thieving tyrant who probably should not have been given a nearly unfettered platform in this film. She desperately wants to be seen as a benevolent dowager, the ""Mother of the Country,"" but she is nothing but a ruthless political animal. Imelda's positioning of herself as a Mother of the Country figure is grotesque. ""This government is soulless,"" she laments after robotically handing out money to sick children. (I rewound multiple times to try and see if she actually touched any of the downtrodden or if they exist as just mere props for her.) She is, of course, speaking during the Presidency of Benigno Aquino III: son of former President Cory Aquino and Senator Ninoy Aquinowho's assassination triggered the, first, downfall of the Marcos family. It's bizarre, infruriating even, to watch this in 2023 knowing that the Marcos family has returned to power following her son's election. A disheartening cycle continues, ""Mother"" awakens once more.",2023-06-27,0

The Kingmaker,"The bet of this movie is that giving extensive space for Imelda and Bong Bong to tell their whitewashed version of Filipino history is worth it, if paired with counterpoints from the likes of Noynoy Aquino, Etta Rosales, May Rodriguez, archival footage of Cory and Ninoy, etc. Surely people will watch to the end to hear about the Marcos regime declaring martial law, their various torture methods against dissidents, their rapes of female prisoners, etc. Then Imelda will just look like a ridiculous liar, surely.It brings to mind Truffaut's observation that it's impossible to make a truly antiwar film, because any depiction of war will out of dramatic necessity make war seem compelling. Imelda is a next-level entertaining fabulist and even when she's showing you her Michelangelo and Picasso paintings, which were extremely obviously bought with stolen money, it's hard for her not to suck you in, at least a little bit.You still hear her idealized tales of Ferdinand; you still see her handing out pesos to poor street children. You tell yourself, ""I'm smart enough not to be taken in by this,"" but here we are four years after this film's release, and Bong Bong is president.The choices of what to emphasize from Marcos's crimes are odd. Who gives a shit that he had an ill-advised zebra park? During Marcos's presidency, wages in Manila fell by more than half. The fact that he led the nation to economic ruin and worsened poverty is at most glanced at, not emphasized.I get the logic. I spent the Trump years focusing on the objectively ridiculous and funny aspects of his tenure (the hamburger feast, putting candy on the minion's head) because it was a way to cope. But some crimes are best confronted with a tone other than detached irony.",2023-03-01,0

The Kingmaker,"A stupid doc that I only realised fairly early on that its tone isn't sarcastic. Director Lauren Greenfield genuinely thinks that Imelda Marcos deserves a voice within the oh so rational and objective genre of ""the documentary"" and her position as a this neutral ""white outsider"" looking in. It's a morally dishonest, ahistorical, and pretentious position to take, for one. And second, say what you want about Imelda: shallow, facetious, a victim of those pesky ""subversives"" if you must. It doesn't take a genius to know the crock of bullshit she spouts and the surface level ""ironic"" stance this doc takes by conducting its interviews within the comforts of Imelda's home decked out with stolen riches as she fellates her husband's legacy from the grave, even more so having the movie frame itself within close proximity to her and her daily PR errands as if we're getting an ""inside look"" in the machinations of this elusive first lady. The worst part is Lauren wants to have it both ways: treat Imelda's excuses and regaling of her childhood as worth your pathos in the same breath as its cheap, emotionally exploitative interviews of victims of the Marcos regime.It's the fucking music...The music cues reveal how this film slimily switches sides and manipulates one's lack of knowledge on the history of Imelda and her legacy. The score is triumphant and optimistic as Imelda describes meeting Ferdinand and their path towards political domination. Wow, so inspirational. Uh oh, looks like Ferdinand is having an affair with actor Dovie Beams, gotta play some suspenseful high strings to really show how Imelda really was hurt by his infidelity.Oh my goodness?! Bongbong is cultivated by his mother to become the next heir of his God-given right to rule the Philippines? Alexa, play some royalty free inspirational music once again.And then at some point, Lauren realises how venerating this is all becoming, so she hard cuts to villagers from Calauit where Imelda's put her safari animals shipped directly from Africa in an attempt to spice up the 'beauty' of the Philippines. There's no music playing, so you know this is serious. Lauren strategically places these scenes proceeding Imelda to merely offset the guilt and extravagance you've been shown previously and ""expose"" how much of an oblivious person Imelda is and you are for almost believing in her. It's patronising at best, and borderline manipulative in eliciting your pitiful gasps at worst.I have no problems with interviewing victims of dictatorial regimes, but how does Lauren have the gall to face these victims with a clean conscience when earlier in the film we see her chillin beside Imelda giving out money like candy to the oh so poor and oppressed people the regime claims they didn't oppress by a literal freeway inside a moving vehicle? How does filming Imelda doing piss poor ""philanthropy"" in the present like she's always done benefit anyone? You had access to literal archival footage clearly demonstrating her shady nefariousness on live Philippine television. What point are you trying belabour to your audience besides giving Imelda free media exposure to perpetuate the same old lies she's been repeating for more than half a century? What makes you immune from the consequences of your privilege as a director where you can shift between sympathy for Imelda and empathy for her victims? This is such disgusting moral complicity utilising a veneer of ""poor people footage"" to add a bit of false progressivism for stating a completely obvious fact of what happens when you fuck over a country resulting in poverty.A useless documentary catered towards gullible international western audiences who know zilch about Filipino politics and history made by a grossly ignorant and privileged filmmaker (Harvard graduate my ass) that desperately needs a crash course on Philippine cinema history to be making such flash in the pan, juvenile bad vs good garbage.This shit ain't new to us, so don't treat our history like a Vice article.",2022-11-10,0

Yes, one can intuit that as the wife of a dictator living a grossly opulent life she probably wasn't a great person. But this documentary lets her have it all her own way for far longer than it challenges her.I suspect the intention was to make the final half hour feel like a withering rebuke of all of the lies she has told, but it feels a bit imbalanced.

TLDR still learned/refreshed a lot after this viewing and think its still agitating, and a good entry point for learning some concrete examples of the marcos corruptioni think now that i’ve seen this a few times i can articulate how this film falls into the trap of liberal political documentaries, caricaturing political figures to the point they almost seem silly in their delusion and out of touchness. caricaturing imelda to be a super villain motherboss girlboss can be funny in a ridiculous way, exposing her frivolity and extravagance. i think this gets somewhat into how conniving and strategic she is but in some of the takeaways from this screening, i wonder if its overshadowed by the persona. it seems that her “perception is real and the truth is fake” line is taken as a sign of delusion and not a look into her and the marcoses strategy to rebrand themselves. this is not a foolish silly old woman, this is a conniving fascist who does whatever it takes to cling to her wealth and the perception of her class, even if it means feigning forgetfulness or outright lying. someone said that the delusion is mental illness and i would argue that its a media strategy from a woman who has been in the spotlight for 70+ years…reminds me of how liberals would psychoanalyze donald trump and call him a dumb cheeto instead of getting into how hes a fascist because of his political opinions and decisions. identity politics is the worst thing to come out of liberal media representation politics discoursei feel that the marcoses and other bureaucrat capitalists are given as much (if not more) time onscreen compared to the everyday people who were interviewed, so there isn’t much insight into the impacts of the political corruption on the lives of the people of the philippines. getting into villainization of just the marcos family, and to some extent rodrigo duterte himself often lacks the critique on a systemic level and sets them apart as the few bad apples when its the whole system that’s corrupt! what did cory and ninoy aquino really do for the people? i don’t think it showed what they did other than interviewing them to critique the marcosesshow us more about the power of the people! this would be a good double feature with a rustling of leaves. the power of the people that threatens the very security of the bureaucrat capitalist system!

As are the human and animal rights violations committed under the Marcoses’ rule. But the truth notwithstanding, Imelda views herself as the “mother” of the nation and the world, and really seems to find nothing wrong with her political ploys or wealth.

The Kingmaker,"The Kingmaker is more than a bio-pic of Imelda Marcos and her wretched family. It shares the playbook for how dictators and despots play to follibles of human nature to win control, then rob you blind while beating you and convincing you it is for your own good.This self-acclaimed 'mother' of the Philippines and the world, is the epitome of a snake. This lady plays innocent and ignorant of the crimes of the husband or the odd assassination of their political enemies. She is so politically smart, yet so dumb or uncaring that she removed the inhabitants of an island for African wildlife to run free with no care or insight into how suitable the animals were or could survive and be cared for decades. She performs magic by managing to flaunt her stolen wealth, cry poor and then hide her billions from the authorities. The real insight is seeing how power can be bought, as the Marcos buy their way back into power by bankrolling a ruthless, sexist, murderous autocrat into the presidency. Who then paves the way for the family’s return, removing their enemies and opening the door wide open for them. No doubt Trump and his sons will use the same technique. The more I think about this the more I feel sick that the world has to tolerate and be abused by these political and criminal masters that exist in all countries but just wear different suits.

The Kingmaker,"Philippines history, the history of martial law and the Marcoses and the Aquinos, feels like personal family history as a Filipino immigrant to Canada. And yet, holy shit, it's different to see that corruption, privilege, evil up close like this film.I never knew that the Marcoses literally bought animals from the safari of Kenya, brought them to the Philippines, kicked out a whole island of people, and created a zoo. What the hell?It's different watching this 2019 film in 2022 after the election of Bongbong Marcos to the Presidency and seeing the strategic steps they've taken to secure their political resurgence and climb back into power. What's so frightening is this revisionist history that the Marcos political machinery has careful cultivated and paid for the delusion of Filipinos, both in the homeland and the diaspora. The scene in the school where the kids are saying that martial law was a good and prosperous time for the Philippines is terrifying. For all of the Philippines' obsession with history – with Rizal, Bonifacio, Aquino – that history is being rewritten in real time, through social media, through public speeches, through lies. And this film just shows the brazenness of it all. Behind the ""motherly"" facade and the openly giving out of money, all that Imelda Marcos wants is power for her family and is willing to do whatever it takes.What a film. I get that maybe we shouldn't give the Marcoses a platform to spread their propaganda. But this is still a history lesson, and a valuable one.",2022-08-16,0

I’m angry on how these manipulative people are still not held accountable for their actions and the fact that they still hold a position in politics. I’m also angry and saddened with the fact that so many Filipino believe in the lie that Martial Law was a peaceful time and it was the time where the Philippines was flourishing. I admit that I used to believe in this too because I only gathered information from what I heard. Now I realize how bad it could be if we spread information based only from what we heard. So kababayan please wake the f up. Don’t let yourself be blind just because you think you know the truth. Do your research and have the will to actually see what’s truly going on. Don’t let yourself be fooled by the pretty gestures these politicians make, and instead look at the alignment between their words and actions.

The Kingmaker,"You cannot talk about Ferdinand Marcos’ dictatorship without talking about his wife. American director Lauren Greenfield not only paints a pretty complete picture of Imelda Marcos and her influence but also lays the ground for the future of Philippine politics.It was important that this documentary was an American production because the Marcoses would never have openly bared their stolen wealth to Philippine media. Greenfield and her team had access to one-on-one interviews with the late dictator’s family and their ostentatious households. But with every memory Imelda recalls, and every art piece she shows off, Greenfield counters them with testimonials from Martial Law activists and victims. This results in exposing the delusion the Marcoses live in.The documentary also chose Calauit Island to represent the Marcoses’ effect on the country. The regime initiated many costly projects, but Calauit Island was a fever dream. Indeed, Imelda dreamt of beautifying the country with poached animals from Africa at the cost of the natives of Calauit Island. Today, the island is long forgotten but the animals remain and are neglected. Similarly, the dictatorship had left the country in shambles, with mounds of debt and a fractured political infrastructure.The Kingmaker isn’t just a retelling of the past. The latter half of the film follows Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s bid for the vice presidency in the 2016 elections. While he narrowly lost, a new dictator stepped in and echoed the crimes of his father. Here, Greenfield concludes the film with a warning of history repeating. Looking back, and considering Marcos Jr.’s recent win in the 2022 presidential elections, The Kingmaker is an excellent explanation for how and why we got here.Subscribe to Actually/Certainly’s Newsletter“Media content you should and shouldn’t waste your time on”",2022-07-22,0

The Kingmaker,"From the director of Queen of Versailles, one of my all-time favorite docs, comes another movie about a matriarch proud to show off her family’s sickeningly decadent lifestyle. And Imelda Marcos makes the previous documentary subject look Mother Teresa.There’s simply too much story here for the constraints of a 100 minute documentary. While her other doc had the advantage of focusing on a simple story rooted in events most viewers didn’t need primers on, this one has the challenge of conveying recent Filipino history, Imelda’s nine decades of life, her son’s political trajectory and the election of former President Duterte. What’s here is never less than fascinating (it’d be shocking if it weren’t) but it should’ve had at least double the run time to breathe.",2022-07-14,0
The Kingmaker,"This a great entry point in the history of the Marcoses but denies any further information to paint the whole story—similar to a politician who says the ""right"" things but is still partly lackadaisical in action.

It's a story with missing characters and missing acts.",2022-07-18,0

Not only is THE KINGMAKER a fascinating documentary about Imelda Marcos, but it's also about the Marcos family's rise to power during her husband's reign as the president of the Philippines.I can see why director Lauren Greenfield wanted to tackle Imelda Marcos for this doc. If you know her previous two films, you know that she documents wealthy people, and what is the meaning of being wealthy. Not only does the Kingmaker fit in with those prior films, it also shows how awful Marcos' reign was when Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law in the Philippines. It seemed like the Marcos family cared more about themselves with all the money and wealth they had instead of helping out the people of the Philippines. It's a sad reality that now Imelda's son BongBong is now the current president of the Philippines after the doc ended. Now I understand why a lot of Filipinos are against the Marcos name since they didn't do a lot of good for their country. Still, this is a great documentary about a divisive figure in Imelda Marcos.",2022-07-10,0

Greenfield does an exceptional job of juxtaposing the callousness of their wealth with the dire conditions oligarchical rule has imposed on generations of Filipinos. The interviews with activists, victims of martial law, and the poor who continue to suffer under a newly reformed Marcos regime are telling. The only apt summation of watching her drone for 90 minutes is that she's Machiavellian, the feigned ignorance and cutesy charm are premeditated, and she and her kin will continue to loot in a never-ending cyclical tragedy.",2022-05-20,0

They will remain poor until their very last breath? They don’t give a f*** about poor people, they never did.

The Kingmaker,"""Perception is real, and the truth is not.""One of the first images that come to mind when watching this film is simply of an old woman, clad in Filipino dress, in a gilded room, adorned with paintings by Picasso and Monet, with golden idols strewn across the tables and in a room that harkens back to kings and queens of old, as she tells her story about how bad she had it. It's a lie, of course, as most things that the Marcos family has, have and will say, but it's a lie people believe. Imelda Marcos understands the power the media has, the way she contorts and changes her words to fit the narrative she wants us to believe, but the editing doesn't allow her words to come out unscathed, juxtaposing her picturesque words with words and footage of torture, punishment and other such catastrophes that could make even the most sympathetic follower squirm. But it's not enough.Of course, it's easy to say that putting her in front of the camera is a good or bad idea, but we often forget that words don't exist on their own in film, they come from the interaction between shots, and even the relationship between footage and audio, and placing neutrality and restraint against an obviously inhumane person is immoral. Covering someone like Imelda Marcos, a person who has almost complete control and understanding over her image is tricky to make well, especially as an outsider like Greenfield, but if you want to cover Marcos, and all of their infamy, especially the person who essentially serves, and still does, as right hand man of her family, you have to be unrelenting and unflinching. As the Philippines evolves, technology moves forward, and the way we consume and the way we determine what is just and true gets harder everyday. It is imperative we are aware of this as our history becomes rewritten, crimes of the past become null and dynasties rise back to power. We have to be aware of these things, these ideas that media can be manipulated and used as propaganda, as agents of control because all media exists that way.Triumph of the Will, a 1935 film depicting Hitler and his Third Reich, is notorious for shaping the way we view the Nazi Party, less as an army breaking apart at the seams as they slaughtered one another due to paranoia, and more of an unrelenting force set out to destroy all we know and love. This disconnect from reality and fiction led to our newfound perception of these people, and it is happening to us.By simply giving these people a platform, by giving them full reign on how they are covered, how they are broadcast nationally, we are giving them the power to manipulate, and it is happening all over, as seen within the film. That's why, when we come to critique this family, we have to take them swiftly and dangerously, not leaving shallow cuts, but scathing stab wounds. Ferdinand Marcos is not a hero, he was a fascist. Plain and simple. He embezzled government funds, he tortured, killed and violated his people and he left wounds we are still covering from, and this revisionist history we have now, the way even the lower classes, who were hit hardest, still believe that crimes are to be ignored in favor of worshipping a past that never existed is something to be concerned about.These crimes were never reconciled with, they have no closure and they are still open to this very day. The animals Imelda Marcos released upon Calauit are still hanging there, the stolen jewelry she has is still not returned, and the system that these people manipulated and used is still not fixed, as seen by the blood on our streets and cries in the middle of the night, with politicians who believe that blood of the poor spilled by corrupt cops is valid.The people have every right to be angry, but we should be critical and understand our history, especially after the current context of the son of the late dictator, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., bearing the name of his father, has won the election, along with Rodrigo Duterte's daughter, who has killed people in the name of his ""drug war."" We have a history of revolutions, some won and some lost, and the fight for liberty doesn't stop when someone wins or loses. It is won through continued and watchful progress, through knowledge and the acknowledgement of the past and through wisdom to see through the lies. Anger is in our blood, use it wisely.",2022-05-14,3

The Kingmaker,"The Kingmaker is the story of ruthless and narcissistic Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines, and her family’s attempts to work their way back into power after her husband’s overthrow.Imelda was the wife of the corrupt Ferdinand Marcos, who ruled the country between 1965-1986. In interviews she comes across as caring, generous, and eccentric, but the documentary reveals the more sinister aspects of her and her husband's rule; in particular the theft of billions from the country and a period of brutal dictatorship involving torture, rape and murder.During martial law in the Philippines over 3,000 people were killed and 70,000 imprisoned, some for as little as being at a meeting with five or more people. Activists appear in the film with chilling stories of being tortured and sexually assaulted under the Marcos regime. The reign of terror lasted until Ferdinand was overthrown after trying to rig an election in 1986, ushering in democracy in the country over the protests of some of America’s Cold War hawks.It’s never clear how involved Imelda was in the worst acts of her husband’s government, although there are hints in the film that she helped to mastermind the assassination of an opposition leader. It is obvious that she benefitted from the record-breaking corruption of the Marcos regime; as a result her habit of handing out wads of money to the poor takes on a sinister air.If there is one word to sum up Imelda, it is narcissistic. Throughout the documentary her hunger for popularity goes beyond all reason; she sees nothing wrong with importing giraffes and zebras into a country where there are no vets to take care of them, leaving them suffering from skin diseases. At one point, she seemingly sincerely says that Chairman Mao told her that she could end the Cold War.Her accumulation of wealth goes beyond practical levels and seems compulsive; her family looted a literally record-breaking amount of money and helped to impoverish The Philippines for decades, and on a more petty level she was famous for having a collection of over 3,000 shoes. You could say that Imelda is similar to Trump, or alternatively, that Trump resembles any number of self-deluded dictators throughout history, who tend to be self-obsessed in the worst way.Such characters have an enduring appeal despite their ridiculousness, and as many people in the documentary note, the Philippines has been forgiving to strongmen in the past. With Rodrigo Duterte's brutal rule coming to an end and Imelda's son Bongbong Marcos in power in the Philippines as of May 2022, the country may unfortunately be on a path to repeating its previous mistakes.",2022-05-09,0

So much of this movie's god awful runtime is literally just Imelda Marcos bloviating while her friends and family defend the concept of corruption. By failing to do what it could have done it has poisoned the conversation and inadvertently (or perhaps by commission, don't bother to @ me) damaged democracy just by existing.Surf School on the other hand is a half star movie that will make you want to punch Harland Williams in his punchably sized nose but it won't make you feel dread or come to rue the day he was born.

The Kingmaker,"“i don’t have an answer for why we allow imelda to even open her mouth.” i don’t think any of my followers here are filipino, but i hope non-filos especially could take some time to read this review.the kingmaker follows imelda marcos, the wife of a former dictator of the philippines. ferdinand marcos had declared martial law over the philippines, causing years of terror and corruption and pain for the vast majority of filipinos. in this documentary, imelda marcos discusses her problems during her time as first lady… victimizing her family despite the power they held (still hold) and the money they stole from the country. this documentary does a great job in portraying the vastness of their family’s wealth, going as far as to show imelda’s house full of legal cases against the family. they are the antithesis of freedom and truth. this documentary was filmed during the 2016 presidential election wherein imelda’s son, ferdinant marcos jr., ran for vice presidency and eventually lost. in 2022, he has somehow taken the lead for presidency despite what his family has done. the youth of the country are afraid of what he’ll do. the youth are disappointed that the work done by the activists— who fought fiercely for their freedom during the martial law era— will possibly have their work be undone. with the family’s reputation for historical revisionism, the people are afraid that the truth and the torture endured by activists of that time will be forgotten. i encourage everyone to give this documentary a shot. it’s well made and very relevant to the philippines today. “i will not have my president be named Ferdinand Marcos… AGAIN!”",2022-05-12,0

I am filled with so much anger, rage, heartbreak, and wish nothing but suffering and death to the Marcos family. While I tried to watch this as a means for educating myself, I found it more insulting that it shed light on their belief that they did absolutely no wrong; believing that they are entitled to power for the rest of their days. I wish a large portion of the documentary illuminated the suffering of the Filipino people during Martial Law, yet instead we are forced to listen to a manipulative, spoiled, narcissistic and entitled woman yap about how she wants to be a mother for the country. Maybe it was the director's intention but frankly, I'm tired of seeing this family being given freedom to speak when they are responsible for the imprisonment, torture and deaths of thousands of Filipinos.",2022-05-12,0

The Kingmaker,"""Perception is real, and the truth is not"". These terrifying words come from the delusional Imelda Marcos, whose influence on politics in the Philippines is scary. The Kingmaker interviews Marcos at length, only for it to become clear that she is a greedy liar seeking to play the victim. Her opulent lifestyle and desire to birth a paradise is slowly realised to come from a scary place. As The Kingmaker is mostly a conventional documentary, aside from its lack of chronology, it feels likely to become a neoliberal piece of mild condemnation without the guts to pick apart Filipino politics. Yet The Kingmaker does find a voice, and manages to find fault in the more liberal governments in the Philippines. Their inability to solve the problems are shown by the film's eventual focus on the resurgence of the Marcos family and their proxy candidate, the evil Rodrigo Duterte. It is a sad and scary time for the Philippines and really this story is still breaking. Who knows if The Kingmaker is telling this slice of history at its beginning or end.There's horrifying moments in The Kingmaker, such as the chilling accounts of torture, the children who openly like martial law, and the fact that Rodrigo Duterte has any power. As a documentary this may not be very inspired, but the subject matter is vital for us all to know. The inbreeding nature of politics has allowed one family to have influence, either overtly or covertly, over an entire country for decades. Perhaps Imelda Marcos does have a plan for paradise, but is the path to it justifiable?2019 Ranked",2019-10-06,3

The Kingmaker,"*followed by a Q&A featuring Director Lauren Greenfield*Imelda Marcos isn’t someone I was familiar with at all prior to this documentary but it didn’t take much to see how she is a prime candidate for a film. Her personality is eye catching and confusing while also being headstrong and assertive. The Q&A that took place following the screening helped improved my view of the film as some of the director’s choices made more scene after hearing how they came to be. One issue I had/have is the level of focus early on on Imelda’s bring of animals to an island and running off its prior inhabitants. While this is an interesting and quirky story, it is later followed up with the film’s first deep dive into the era of Marshall Law in the Philippines brought on by her late husband Ferdinand Marcos. This is far more interesting and far more important to the narrative than this island full of giraffes and I had issues with the time allotment of the two, as well as how much of the earlier portion of the doc feels far too casual given the level of information that is conveyed in the later half. While still is problematic for me, it helped to hear that over the process of filming this movie, much of the later events weren’t even in play yet. So at the time the film felt like it was going to be one thing before new storylines emerged. It doesn’t completely remove my issues about it but it make more sense and for me makes it more understandable a choice. It is a documentary worthy of keeping an eye out for as I think much of it will be a welcomed source of information for most about the political issues in the Philippines and how people like Imelda can be so influential to even if from a distance she looks like a comical character of sorts.",2019-10-18,0
The Kingmaker,To a person who only knows the history of the Marcos dynasty from the Wikipedia article this was appropriately terrifying and illuminating. There are some major issues with the film itself; I can't be sure but it feels like Laura Greenfield went in expecting to just do a bio/exposé on Imelda but then got ensnared in the insanity of 2016 national election. The movie struggles with mission creep; the last 30 minutes depicting the results of that surprising election unfold at breakneck speeds that barely hang together and then at the end require a long series of title cards. It feels tacked-on but I'm not sure that there was any other way to convey the insane turn the story was taking.,2019-10-19,0

The Kingmaker,"Lauren Greenfield (""The Queen of Versailles,"" ""Generation Wealth"") has once again proven why she's my favorite documentary filmmaker, and one of my favorite filmmakers, period. She explores new territory in ""The Kingmaker,"" without straying away from her signature ""photographic"" and intimate style; the DNA of her style is felt and serves as a backbone to new elements that elevate it to another level in order to successfully cover the story of Imelda Marcos and politics in The Philippines. Everything I admire about her body of work is present on this one: Metaphors of excess and unbalance and its consequences; glamour and its beauty, but also how comical it can be; the obsession with material things and its demons. However, due to the nature of the subject, it goes a step further, diving into political territory and giving us a cautionary tale about power and greed that is harsh, timely, but hopeful. This project might not have been the culmination of 25 years of work like ""Generation Wealth,"" but it's probably the most challenging one Greenfield has had to make. The challenges of this five-year endeavor are seen and felt on the screen, but they pay off. If Greenfield and her team were able to accomplish this, then I cannot wait to see what's next in store.I highly recommend this documentary: A portrait of a woman in and out of power; of a country in and out of justice; of a political system in and out of the past.

The Kingmaker,"Low 3.Got to go to a special screening followed by a conversation with Director Lauren Greenfield. I sadly have not seen any of her previous work. I also had no idea what this was about. I seriously hate movies like this because it reminds me just how little I know of the world.  I knew nothing about Marcos. Don't know anything about the Philippines even. As I've said before Documentaries aren't my go to genre but I will always be grateful they exist because I love learning about things I never knew about. Pretty crazy all the stuff that was shown here.But I found this to be pretty confusing. I wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel for Imelda Marcos at first. I just mean the way the story was laid out. The audience reaction to certain things was different to mine as well which added to my confusion. Then for me I'm not even sure how people in the Philippines feel about Imelda Marcos? At one point it seems like everyone hates her but then it seems like people now love her? I guess I would have like interviews from people explaining why they love her. I guess it's just something I'll have to look into myself. I don't know for me I just didn't really like the way this was laid out. It painted her as a great lady then out of no where we were supposed to hate this family then they would explain why. I think I would have liked a more linear storyline. BUT during the conversation she did actually speak to that. She said when doing a documentary the audience believes what they are seeing. So what do you do when you have a subject that lies? So I guess that explains the storyline feeling all over the place for me because she would cut to actual facts after Imelda Marcos said something that wasn't true. So that does make sense but it just really had a way of feeling disjointed for me. Also there was a part where they were interviewing someone about something really dark and personal and before they finished talking cut to another interview about the same topic and that really threw me. So it was two people talking about something similar at the same time. I didn't like that I would have preferred to hear one at a time especially about something so sad. But yeah I guess I would have just liked things better explained. I feel as someone who knows nothing about what went down I would have liked to know more about when Martial Law happened and about how they were accused of stealing millions. I just feel like things weren't explained as good as I would have liked. Felt like it just touched the surface. This would focus on different things all at once and like I said just felt all over the place for me. But it was still good and learned a lot. Pretty shocking all that happened and what all is still going on. And seriously Animal Island broke my heart. I'd say check this out if you can, I believe it will be on Showtime. You may enjoy this more than I did and if anything the interviews and the access Greenfield had to Imelda Marcos is very impressive.",2019-10-23,0

While its attempt at weaving the incumbent leadership with the Marcos dynasty can at times be a stretch, as a Filipino, I can see how this might be the image that non-Filipinos have of the Philippines.As with most films and rooms that she inhabits, Imelda Marcos is magnetic. She's a modern-day Rasputin, who can hypnotize people and place them under her spell. Perhaps it is not the filmmaker's intention that when we do not hear from Imelda for a stretch of time, the movie slows down to a halt.In those long stretches, we yearn for more Imelda on screen. Like the Philippines, we are smitten from the first minute to the last.

The Kingmaker,"""The Kingmaker"" begins as an unfettered check-in on the life of one of the 20th century's most notorious figures, Imelda Marcos. Like a visit to the zoo, we're granted the opportunity to observe the seemingly self-delusional Marcos in her current habitat as she dreams of a time and place she no longer occupies. Filmmaker Lauren Greenfield allows Imelda the chance to justify, in her own words, her and her late husband's ruthless and corrupt reign as the authoritarian overlords of the Philippines. Greenfield doesn't assist Imelda in her efforts to rewrite history, but she allows Imelda to state her case even as the film mixes in interviews from former friends and enemies (and victims). There are even moments of humor during the film's early-going, as Imelda's obliviousness to the audience's feeling of disgust toward her wastefully lavish and cartoonish lifestyle, cruel indifference for the rights of her fellow countrymen, and insistence on innocence lands perfectly as a joke at the former Filipino First Lady's expense.However, the film transforms into something far uglier and more frightening as Greenfield transitions from mere case study to political exposé (albeit, one that could be a bit more focused). Like watching a horror film, ""The Kingmaker"" turns the joke around on the Filipino people and the audience. Laugh as you might at Imelda and her seemingly fantastical defenses of the Marcos regime and her pipe dream of seeing her son, BongBong, someday elevated to the presidency, the terrifying and telling reality is that Imelda has not yet been relegated to 20th century has-been. At nearly 90, she's a member of the Filipino House of Representatives, the mother of an influential Filipino senator (her daughter) and a very possible future president (her son), and a behind-the-scenes benefactor of the current authoritarian-leaning president, Rodrigo Dutarte. Delusional though she may be, Imelda is still as cunningly manipulative as ever. Hell, she may be once again controlling the strings of power in the Philippines, more than 30 years after she and her husband were forced into exile. It's the kind of film that sends a chill down your back as the credits roll.",2019-11-20,0

It was a case filled with fraud and speculation on how this couple was making their money yet a lack of solid evidence to support that whatever it was they were doing was unjust. Today, the concern is that Imelda's son, Bongbong is on his way to ruling the Philippines which terrifies many since history is seemingly beginning to repeat itself in the sense that whoever speaks out negatively about the family suddenly disappears or is subject to assassination with a cover up. I just find this so insane and I feel the best thing to do is to spread the word. It's such a controversial case and Lauren Greenfield did an excellent job at showing both perspectives.

The Kingmaker,"Beneath the thick make-up and perfected smile of Imelda Marcos there seems to be something more sinister and unnerving about her appearance. “Perception is real and truth is not,” she says when speaking about accusations of torture and abuse of power, and it's this understanding of how to manipulate her image that has enabled her to remain outside of a prison cell for so long. It’s a warped form of cognitive dissonance that director Lauren Greenfield has captured in her documentary, The Kingmaker, showing the rise, fall and steady rise again of the Marcos clan in the Philippines.Greenfield has spent much of her career documenting the rich and deluded, which made Marcos the perfect subject. She is famous for her lavish lifestyle which included the ownership of thousands of luxury brand shoes and the spending over $2 billion of state money during her time in power. But the longer Greenfield spent with Imelda, the more obvious it became she was an unreliable narrator, locked away in a fantasy bubble refusing to face up to the pain her family has caused the Philippine people for the past half century.Imelda dominates the first half of the film speaking about her journey to government alongside former husband, and now deceased President, Ferdinand Marcos. At the same time she is galvanising support behind her son, Bongbong, while he seeks election as Vice President. Greenfield managed to secure good access to the former First Lady with a one-on-one interview at home, also following her as she travels through the Manila slums (“it never used to be like this” she says with faux incredulity) handing out cash from the huge wad fixed to her side. She makes a good fist of playing the ‘woman of the people’ role, but it is little more than a sham.Review continues over at The Digital Fix",2019-11-07,3

The ending hints at the possibility that Rodrigo Duterte's election as president may have been part of some larger plot to return a scion of the Marcos family to power. While interesting, I'm not sure this theory is fleshed out enough to merit inclusion.",2019-12-12,0
The Kingmaker,"Lauren Greenfield has made films about people with immense wealth before, and both those and her books tend to cover that uncomfortable collision of aspirational wealth and real lived experiences, about little corners of the human psyche (or rather bigger ones in some cases) that desire the glossy fashion spread lifestyle. Imelda Marcos largely fits neatly into that, but with a far bigger and more dangerous political footprint that continues to make itself felt. Ostensibly the title is about her relationship with her husband, the massively corrupt dictator of the Philippines for two decades from the mid-60s to the mid-80s (at which point he was ousted by a 'People Power' revolution via the wife of an assassinated opposition leader, Corazon Aquino), whose power she was said to manipulate for her own ends, most famously for the acquisition of art, designer items and of course shoes. But the film moves quickly on from these trappings to her real and lingering effect on Filipino politics, via her family's dynasty and their support for current dictator-wannabe Rodrigo Duterte. Stylistically it frames Marcos with the opulence of her living spaces, repeatedly showing her handing out money to her loyal supporters crowding around her car or in public appearances (often held and distributed by her staff). She shows off art and photos of her with world leaders (at one point hilariously, but utterly unconcernedly, breaking some of these framed highlights while reaching to show off one, I think with her and Nixon). She is also apparently blithely unaware of how her namedropping comes across, especially when she's talking about aforementioned world leaders or her art collection. She could be a figure of fun, but gradually the film becomes more and more serious about her impact, as it layers on the Marcos's crimes and the real effects of the policies and division they have sowed within the society, paving the way for her and her family's chilling return to power.",2019-12-13,0

Being a Filipino who lives abroad is a blessing as I am away from the violence and disasters back home, but a curse because I cannot be more than an observer. I can only do my part to try and fight the cynical thoughts in my head saying ""we have always been corrupt"" ""there is nothing we can do"", ""that is just how things are done"". I've been apathetic to injustice due to my privilege. I am grateful for the life I have and what has been provided for me but it is that privilege that has made me not care.

The Kingmaker starts from a position of curiosity and sympathy (there's something of The Fog of War in Jocelyn Pook's Philip Glassy score); Imelda Marcos as ridiculous but tragic, and maybe misunderstood. The second half of the film morphs into Act of Killing territory and the testimony of victims of the Marcos dictatorship cause the mask to slip. Her attempts to propel her David Brent-like son to power likewise move from mildly pathetic to deeply troubling. Ultimately a film that speaks to a variety of worrying political trends across the world, and how perception trumps truth at all turns.",2019-12-13,0
The Kingmaker,"Really brilliantly constructed - the film sets up as a cosy, cute, harmless portrait of an eccentric celebrity in her grey years, and allows itself to remain in that framework as the body count grows higher, as Kissinger dances on the screen, as the talking heads, initially brought in to provide sappy reminiscing about Imelda's public life, begin to admit propping up dictators for the US' foreign policy interests or detail their sexual assault at the hands of the Marcos regime, as the gormless Jeb Bush-like son goes from affable mummy's boy to a brutal example of the violence of capital exerting itself, and of course as it ends with the still-unfolding nightmare of Duterte. The usefulness of this for the film is that it provides an aesthetic critique of the influence of capital on society by relating everything back to Marcos, in that we see that all its awful violence, its total control over humanity, its manufacturing of poverty and suffering, don't serve some sort of greater noble cause, but instead simply exist so that an elite can buy shoes and completely bizarre confirmations of their self-image. It's useful sometimes to remember how utterly ugly it all is, and how power has no correlation to either intelligence or beauty, it just exerts itself in service of itself - I'd never immediately disbelieve someone who told me the rich devote their whole lives to worshipping Molloch and doing satanic rituals, because there's no need for these things to be real for the idiotic rich to exploit the world in practicing them, as Marcos' obsessive world-mother fantasy and surreal safari island show. The woozy, nightmarish quality of the film's descent into horror doesn't distract from the reality, and it's a serious documentary that isn't reductive to just pointing at the absurdity of the rich. Instead, it uses these contrasts to make the total dominion of capital in public life and its attendant brutality that protects and asserts the power of the dominant elite all the more vivid, and shows how apparently laughable figures like Duterte can exist as the sinew between capitalism and fascism, artificially creating a need and then fulfilling it with a solution that has no alternative (or, a failed neoliberal alternative), like Marcos literally buying the affection of the poor she helped impoverish. It's that clear critique of capital as a structure and empathy for the oppressed throughout that keeps it from being just liberal aesthetic critique, although mockery of the venal rich still has its place - don't let unfunny US talk show hosts take it away from you completely.",2019-12-14,0

The Kingmaker,"Sly documentary follows an elderly Imelda Marcos as she works to install her feckless son with Ferdinand Marcos, Bongbong, as vice-president of the Philippines. Imelda likes to lie just about as much as Donald Trump, and she likes power just about as much too. This is the story of how Marcos money has thoroughly corrupted the Philippines. It's about the con job the Marcos clan pulled and continue to pull on the people of the Philippines--they even convinced some proles that seven years of martial law were the good old days when the country thrived. Director Greenfield just stays quietly out of the way and lets the facts and Imelda prosecute their own case. One interesting line of thought suggests that the country's current murderous dictator, Rodrigo Duterte, is a Marcos stooge installed to grease Bongbong's path, & who will step aside when it's time for Bongbong to take power. It's all jaw-dropping, and provides a convenient road-map to how dictators establish authoritarian rule. We should be paying close attention.",2019-12-17,0

The Kingmaker,"Portrait of a delusional yet absolutely terrifying persona, a comic-book villain under whose absurdity lies the sinister potential to realise these delusions through the self-justifying mythos of a national narrative. Wish this explored the tumultuous years under Marcos’ martial law at a deeper socio-economic level, and also the country’s political landscape during and post Marcos; make no mistake, the real star of the show is Imelda, a seemingly impossible amalgamation of naïveté and shrewdness, delusion and self-awareness.",2019-12-18,0

Yet the movie leaves us in little doubt that these most performative signs of weakness - as with any suggestion that Imelda might be considered a victim - may in themselves be a show, a form of spin, and that they are as nothing when one sets them against the lifetime of pain and suffering endured by the Filipino poor. Greenfield induces that wary, guarded empathy one might feel in close proximity to a wounded lion or wolf, creatures that, though laid low, may just rally long enough overnight to make a second lunge for your throat or chest.

It starts as a portrait of Imelda Marcos, turns into a broader study of recent Filipino history, then becomes a film about the 2016 vice presidential election. Each could be a great film on its own, but that’s too much for just 100 minutes. It is interesting, but somewhat superficial for this reason. Reading Imelda Marcos’ Wikipedia page or just checking who won the election (if you don’t already know) could cover most of the same ground.

Noynoy Aquino quotes Santayana about how those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it, ironic considering how his administration's neoliberal policies contributed to the conditions that helped put another despot as depraved as Marcos into power. The Marcoses are depicted as deluded oafs buoyed by the current of their unearned wealth, creating optics that somewhat distance the family from the atrocities they're responsible for, especially for those who are only learning about Imelda through this film. In one short scene, public school students casually repeat misinformation about Martial Law, mirrored in a sequence where Imelda makes the same claims to the period's secure and prosperous nature, set against archival images and footage of arrests and accounts of torture at the hands of police employed by the Marcoses. It is chilling, heartbreaking, infuriating, and makes it clear that despite Greenfield's documentary covering well-treaded ground, the message bears repeating.

For that, I’m grateful for The Kingmaker. Thank you to the crew for telling this story.My fingers are crossed that this documentary gets a wide release, that it gets uploaded to a streaming service so more can have access to it, or that it becomes required viewing in schools. The nation needs it. Badly.P.S. I’m writing this to remember: As the credits rolled in the screening I went to, people cried out in the darkness of the theater, chanting what we usually say when we’re protesting in the streets: “Never again, never again.

The Kingmaker,"I think the most important thing that The Kingmaker did was to directly connect the Marcoses to Duterte - the money, the power, the influence, the strategy, the long con - in a way that is easy for people to follow and understand. Infuriating and frustrating to watch how this same story played out twice in our lifetimes.The main takeaway is proper education. Even I don’t remember being taught about the horrors of Martial Law in elementary and high school - I remember only memorizing that Marcos was the president that stayed the longest in power. Which is useless. If not for university, I probably would be as clueless as these kids in the movie, especially with how active the Marcoses are paying people to revise history to their advantage - which as we saw, our unreliable narrator Imelda Marcos has obviously started to believe and claim as historical facts. Also, how was it possible that after EDSA Revolution and TWO Aquino presidencies that there is still no memorial or museum detailing the atrocities of Martial Law?? This is why we always forget. Germany has its Holocaust memorial, and even Cambodia has the same for the Polpot genocides. How do we not have any? Why do we go to theme parks for field trips instead of a Martial Law museum? Sad thing is, it’s too late now. Not going to happen with the current government, after what we’ve seen in The Kingmaker. It is a testament to Greenfield’s dedication and craft that she was able to cover 50 years of Philippine history and show it in a very comprehensive and compelling structure, and managed to connect what has happened in the 70s to what is happening today by following the thread of money and power.",2020-01-29,0

The Kingmaker,"Lauren Greenfield has always had this strange fascination with showing how wealth corrupts people and how excess magnifies eccentricity. I went to an exhibit of hers sometime last year and found it interesting how so many of the portraits were of Imelda Marcos. Imagine my excitement, then, when I found out that the reason behind that was that Greenfield was making a documentary about Imelda. Finally, the wider world would know about the regime that tore our country into pieces. The Kingmaker is mostly successful at that, but it hardly treads new ground. She is portrayed in the documentary like she is portrayed in other international cultural works that feature her: eccentric, charismatic, having led a charmed life, having possessed 3000 shoes. In the end you have to wonder if it's Greenfield who's ""tricking"" Imelda into making this doc, or it's Imelda who's playing Greenfield.Strangely enough, the section that made it most interesting for me is what probably made it a weaker documentary. There is a 30 minute digression where we hardly see Imelda, and instead focus on the 2016 Vice Presidential elections. The family sees it as a chance to regain power and redeem their name, but their delusions of grandeur and desperation are only magnified. And while Bong Bong Marcos lost the elections, it is apparent that their power only grows stronger with the allegiance of Rodrigo Duterte. It feels less cohesive as a documentary as a result, but at least we're seeing something new. So is it good? I feel it is. Is it enough? Hardly. While there was a heartbreaking series of interviews with Martial Law victims, it is only implied that Imelda Marcos has something to do with this. Why was there no coverage of the convictions in international courts? Why was there no definite statement about the guilt of this woman? The Kingmaker is just another piece of cinema that perpetuates Imelda Marcos's legend. What I want to see is an outright condemnation of this woman, because she deserves nothing less. Never forget.",2020-02-02,0

The Kingmaker,"I've never heard so much aghast tutting in my life as from the audience at this screening. Imelda Marcos was the wife of Ferdinand Marcos, dictator of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, when she and her husband fled into exile. But in the early 1990s her family returned to the Philippines and in the 2010s began it's return to the frontline of politics, seeking office for her son Bongbong. This film, with a tone of mounting horror, relates their appallingly successful efforts to return to power, the facts as frequently jaw-dropping as they are terrifying. For 90 minutes we watch this despicable cartoon villain throw herself a pity party while others suffer the consequences of her vomit-inducing luxury. The ripest metaphor at the films centre is the safari park she and her husband built, evicting hundreds of families from their island home to make way for animals poached from Africa. The film doesn't quite sell this as a metaphor for the political inbreeding, but it remains an incisive example of the cruelty and selfishness these vile humans spread. The initial catalogue of corruption, fraud, ignorance, exploitation and negligence gradually gives way to the insidious background whispers of genuine atrocities committed, before, in the final act, the curtain is fully drawn back and the extent and immediacy of the consequences of their unquenched thirst for power are lain bare and we finally grasp how urgent and real the threat these people pose democracy truly is. It is the rising panic of witnessing the wave of populism and post-truth over the last half a decade condensed down into 90 minutes. Initial disbelief mixed with a touch of amused mocking scorn, before the prickling sense of unease and ultimate bone chilling realisation that this is our reality now and these people, the worst of humanity, utterly devoid of self-reflection, empathy, intelligence or decency, really are running the world. It's a stunningly effective, if incomplete, account of our nightmare modern reality.",2020-02-08,0
The Kingmaker,"The Kingmaker: Or The Court's FoolSome people say there shouldn't be any platform anymore that would let Imelda Marcos speak. Anything that seems to come out of her mouth serves no higher purpose than to arouse her narcissism as nothing she says adds any real value to what we already know.Squeezing a reasonable statement from her is futile. This documentary would've worked without her. But the thing is: if given the chance for myself, I would've let it all be and made the documentary all about her relishing in her nonsense.No seriously, let me explain. From the cartoonish first shot of Imelda giving bills to the frenzied poor, The Kingmaker had a sense of a mockumentary in it that aims to highlight Imelda's delusions. For a second, I was suspicious about the prospect of this film hellbent on being pro-Imelda propaganda. But then it went somewhere and I realized: the film is not trolling us, it is trolling the Marcos matriarch herself. And in some moments of brilliant comedy, it seems that even she is trolling herself. It looks like I am watching The Office (2005), even though I never did see an episode of The Office. Or a Taika Waititi political satire akin to What We Do In The Shadows (2014), but tyrants instead of vampires, even though I never did see What We Do In The Shadows.By then you ask, ""Is this reviewer full of himself? This is the Marcoses we are talking about for crying out loud! None of this is a laughing matter.""And so I answer, ""Comedy here is so intentional, you must have been an idiot or a hardcore Marcos fanatic to miss it.""Greenwood's editing in The Kingmaker is so deliberate in making its subject ridiculous. There are times when scenes should've ended, but then she decides to linger into awkward pauses. Some cuts evoke absurd motifs that elicit restrained laughs. Restrained because they are positioned in instances where the situation programmed you to feel something else.I sure wish the documentary went in this direction completely. Relax, it did go into serious territory. And at this point, the film starts to falter. At least in a self-deprecating mockumentary, you would have focus. Greenwood's fault is that she tried to inject a little bit of everything in the narrative of The Kingmaker hence making the documentary boggled and frustratingly on the fence. It is obviously against tyranny, of course. But then again the documentary could've been appropriated and misread as a loving portrait of the old hag by some people. Which did happen for some appalling reason.By then you ask, ""Is a mockumentary more susceptible to misinterpretation?"" And so I stubbornly answer, ""Shut up. I know. At least we had the unapologetic LOLs.""However, as an informative piece that serves as an entry-level lesson to our history, The Kingmaker is highly successful. It even shed light on lesser known controversies that Imelda managed to get her hands on - the Calauit island conversion to an African safari and displacement of its indigenuos people. But you could still accuse the documentary for being pandering to liberals. It portrays the Aquinos as eventual heroes to history, as if the Cory Aquino administration saw significant improvement in the country's atmosphere. Which it didn't, as things arguably went worse.The documentary has an oversimplified black-and-white approach to the subject it tackles that could be a disservice to the complexities of our history, a possible by-product of Greenfield being an outsider.It works for students and foreigners, the latter of which is the real audience of the film. But to people who already made up their minds, there's only so much that this film could do.In a perfect world, The Kingmaker would educate more people on the truth of our history. And it would push loyalists to be more critical of their politics. Hell, in a perfect world, there would've been no need for The Kingmaker. But this isn''t a perfect world. In all seriousness, films like these are noble efforts and should be made more often. Only people should be more critical of what they watch.In lesser seriousness, let me end by cherishing this gem of a scene from the documentary: There's a scene where Imelda recounts how she hid diamonds in diapers to be taken with her as they try to leave Malacañang due to the People Power Revolution. ""Diamonds in diapers,'' jokes Imelda. Then an awkward pause as she hopes for some laughs in the audience. No one laughed. Then I laughed because no one laughed.

More than it having primary sources (in re: Imelda as the main interviewee though quite unreliable) it showed you how our country is still choosing to #NeverForget.

The Kingmaker,"Lauren Greenfield's latest documentary about the Philippines' ex-first lady starts off as a darkly comic portrait of a delusional woman, but later turns into a disgusting tale of a loathsome monster's ambitions & lies.In  , we get a more personal look into the life of former first lady Imelda Marcos, their family's rose to power with her husband, the late Ferdinand Marcos being seated as the country's president. The documentary starts off a bit humorous, with Imelda introducing herself and her life before. The things she tells the camera are quite funny because it makes her look delusional- her actions are mostly eye-rolling (we spend a lot of time watching her give children with banknotes). It's full of spectacle, with archival footage of her hanging out with foreign leaders like Ronald Reagan, Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, and Mao Zedong. But as soon as the interviews with Martial Law survivors enters the picture, you realize that she's an unreliable narrator- the story she's been telling us was leaning towards a certain narrative aiming to cleanse our view towards her, the Marcos family, and Martial Law in general.Imelda is obviously using melodrama to get the poor's sympathy- a strategic story to support their return to power as she & her children, Bongbong & Imee, try to climb the ladder back to the government. What's worse is that they are also trying to revise our country's history, by changing what has transcribed in the past and teaching these fake information to the youth. At one point, some kids were asked what they know about Martial Law. Their answers stupefied me, with all of them saying that it was a 'golden' era for the Philippines. George Santayana was right: those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.: Definitely a must watch for everyone, with its sharp and biting depiction of Marcos' regime and its connection with today's fascist regime of Duterte.",2020-02-27,0
The Kingmaker,"I'm still angry so this might not be as objective. It's uncomfortable and infuriating, knowing that this family who has blantantly abused this country (and still do!) is still not held responsible for their numerous crimes to the state. I find it an interesting direction choice to use Imelda as an unreliable narrator and then juxtaposing that with archival footage and firsthand testimonies of people affected by the 1972 Martial Law, which diametrically opposes what the Marcos family claims. The access Greenfield and her team had with the family is also worth noting because it's quite obvious that they're all putting a show—all part of their scheme to revise history and put themselves back into power. But we know better than that. Greenfield used that access to present something beyond the Marcoses' ""show""—families and villagers displaced from their homes because the Marcoses want their very own island zoo, thousands of victims of human rights abuses, even the people working for them that are treated like pawns instead of human beings. But it's a pity they still tried to play it safe. If you're going to give people like the mythmaker a platform, you need to be clear and firm in your stance instead of staying neutral.It's very important to process the film after watching it. People who saw this film should note that all of this isn't about the Marcos-Aquino family feud or a fight between political parties. It's about how this government continually oppresses its people for the sake of vanity and greed. Philippine Premiere · UPFI Cine Adarna",2020-02-25,0

However as a person who has heard from my mother, and other family and friends from the Philippines how fucked up the Marcos regime was, my skin was crawling the moment I saw Imelda tearing up as she was handing out pesos to poor people on the street.The doc does well in setting us up to root for Imelda and the Marcoses, and then swiftly pull the rug from under the viewers. This is done by lessening interview footage of the Marcoses themselves and favoring the interviews that are anti-Marcos, a very simple way of switching perspective. When it becomes clear that a big portion of the money that they have was stolen, that was basically the final nail in the coffin of the doc’s case against the family. This kind of disillusionment, or whatever refusal to accept the truth that Imelda Marcos displays throughout the film and throughout her campaigning with Bongbong is frightening.

The Kingmaker,"I saw The Kingmaker in UP Film Institute during the 34th EDSA Anniversary, so the milieu made it feel like the movie is preaching to the choir at this point, so I was kind of disappointed that there was little nuance with how it talks about the connections between our current issues and the Marcoses. What's funny, I think, is that in its attempt to show the Marcoses' humanity—or lack thereof—it did not let enough voice from the masses to speak. That's why my favorite parts were when it touched on the Calauit Safari, because it puts the two classes at odds with each other (and how order both in nature and in humans was threatened because of it). Still, I think it's an important film especially for people who are learning about the family's atrocities for the first time. It would not win the conversion of the diehards or the undecided, but it does solidify one fact and one battlecry: #NeverAgain to a Marcos in power.",2020-03-03,0

The Kingmaker,"When people think of Imelda Marcos, usually the first thing that comes to mind is her 3,000 pairs of luxury shoes, her luxury fashion and lavish lifestyle. She was also the first lady of Manila, married to the president Ferdinand. They were in power from 1965 until their removal in 1986. They're widely believed to have illegally amassed a wealth of billions of U.S. dollars, all of which has never been recovered, holding the Guinness World Record for greatest government robbery. She has since been charged with her dealings and corruption, as well as disqualified from holding any public office. But was later cleared of all previous charges on appeal, and still continues to live in Manila.In this documentary, she's very much still living the lavish lifestyle and gladly shows everyone her priceless collection of luxuries, including paintings and sculptures.

The Kingmaker,"So basically Imelda Marcos is the Eva Peron of the Philippines but more sinister and eccentric. Both Eva and Imelda, beautiful women who came from the poor and rose to power beside their dictator husband, are similarly fascinating people who wield such influence that they start to believe they were saviors or ""mothers"" of their people. Plus they have great musicals based on their lives. The interesting thing about Lauren Greenfield's ""The Kingmaker"" is how the tone of the film shifts midway. The first half of the doc shines on the past, presenting us with Imelda's many eccentricities and extravagant lifestyle that were so funny to learn about. But it then shifts into serious politics of the present where we get to learn that Imelda is still wielding power by helping to elect his son into the Vice-Presidency. It's Greenfield's way of forboding how the country is doomed to repeat history.",2020-03-05,0

The Kingmaker,"""Perception is real. The truth is not.""It's Women's History Month. Love her or hate her, Imelda Marcos is definitely a woman who made history.In short time I'm going to work my way backwards through documentarian Lauren Greenfield's filmography, starting with her most recent film, The Kingmaker, profiling Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of The Philippines. Notable for far more than just her epic shoe collection, Marcos held the reigns of power behind-the-scenes during her family's time in office, and now has hopes to return to the presidential mansion.Greenfield's style in this film is to allow Marcos to tell her own history and her own story at first. We follow her in-person as she is interviewed, talking about her family, upbringing, and rise to power in the mid-1960s. For over two decades, her husband Ferdinand ruled with her at his side, a political power broker and key agent in diplomacy, using her striking looks and infectious charm to be as close to other world leaders -- often conservative, often dictatorial -- as her husband ever was. Famously catching Ferdinand cheating on her with tape recorder under the bed, which she used as blackmail to get what she wanted later, she grew in prestige and influence into the 80s as the family lived like extravagant royalty amidst a nation suffering in abject poverty. It was the 1986 People Power revolution (and election of Corazon Aquino) which forced them from office and exiled the family from ever ruling The Philippines again.Of course, the Marcos regime ruled with an iron fist in a military dictatorship, and gradually through The Kingmaker the stories of others -- those affected by the imposition of martial law, the families evicted from their homes to the Marcos family could build and renovate at will, the torture victims and political prisoners of innumerable amounts -- come to the fore, and the real truth is revealed about Imelda. That is, Greenfield allows her to be an unreliable narrator, and brings in members of the Aquino family and other opponents to counter her fabrications and exaggerations, like a form of fact checking. Along with her son Bongbong who Imelda wishes to see back in the presidential palace again -- and who probably likes Parasite exactly twice as much as you do -- the two craft a fantastical tale of their birthright to rule, while everyone else fights against their corruption and misdeeds as the loving Marcos clan cozies up to current sociopathic president Duterte.Now in her late 80s, Imelda appears unrepentant and even in denial of any of her family's actions. And why would she admit them? She still maintains fabulous wealth that was shipped offshore and retained after exile, still flaunting it in the face of today's Filipino people and using it to further Bongbong's campaign. In a bizarre state of denial about the years of horror her family brought to The Philippines, Imelda plays the victim and twists the facts to beg for sympathy; unfortunately it has worked in some ways, stealing billions from the country while many Filipinos suffered.Greenfield has explored themes of wealth, privilege, and bewildering ignorance of power and influence before, and The Kingmaker does that effectively. The doc plays with a linear timeline a little, and the shifting stories can make it difficult to follow if you don't already have knowledge of the era. I imagine anyone not from the Philippines and especially anyone under 30 might need more background information about this history to fully grasp the evil of the Marcos regime and impact for decades more, as well as how it's profoundly affected the current Duterte era. This film though is an excellent start.Added to The Best Documentary Films of 2019.Added to Lauren Greenfield ranked.",2020-03-13,3

The Kingmaker,"Imelda Marcos is delusional. I am not a PolSci student nor have the credibility to speak up properly about politics and I don't know alot about this topic so I'm glad there is a proper documentary about this. This post is very long. If u have the time to read it go ahead. I'd like to start off by saying I absolutely love the camerawork here. I love studying cinematography and hope to be a cinematographer someday and I must say that knowing this is a documentary, where the shots are more spontaneous and thinking of where to point the camera or keep what's in the frame is alot more crucial and I guess more thought is happening whilst operating it. There were 3 parts that I loved the camera work so much. 1. Imelda was at her garden flexing her framed photos and pics one up right in the middle. I guess her arm or dress snagged the other frames in the background that it went crashing down like dominoes. She watched frames crash with NO. FUCKING. EMPATHY. OR SIGN OF CONCERN –– WALA!!!! She just fucking looked at it fall, brushed it off and continued speaking about whoever the fuck she was with. While that was happening (and this is where I talk abt camera work) the cam ZOOOOMS out and shows one of her house help bending down to pick up the shattered pieces of her ""precious framed photos of her """"""""""friends"""""""""""""" Tangina nasugatan ba si Kuya?????? My heart goes for people employed under her, they don't deserve that. 2. Also with Imelda's house help. She was flexing this other HUGEASS picture frame of a newspaper clipping and she asked her househelp to hold it up. She was hiding herself from the camera but had one eye peeping in between the crook of her elbow. I saw her emotions and just felt so sorry for her. Idk what she was actually feeling ah but Idk it just feels wrong. 3. Imelda was again flexing this part of her house with again EXTRAVAGANT paintings and sculptures, the camera was at a medium wide which already was showing enough of the venue. But the cameraperson zoomed out slowly to reveal one of Imelda's house help trying to inch their way out of the frame to hide. But as he tried to inch himself out, the camera kept him in frame. I saw the back and forth and it just goes to show how they feel unworthy???? (for the lack of a better term) ALSO WOW JUST LAUREN GREENFIELD UR MIND I STAN She beautifully crafted this docu to reveal the truth about the Marcoses but not as an IN UR FACE U SUK type of way. But in a way that really digs deep into ur psyche and just makes u feel the anger to ur core. Correct me if I'm wrong, but If u watch this documentary it can be interpreted in 2 main ways. If you're a Marcos supporter you'd watch this and see scenes you agree. You'd agree with Imelda when she'd say she's the Matriarchal Saviour of the Philippines, you'd say Martial Law was a wonderful time for the PH. But if you had common sense, or you know,,,, in the eyes of the well informed, we really know what this docu is about and I will absolutely hate them for it. In the end it states that they're slowly finding their way back into PH Politics and I just cannot stand knowing we've got another batch of them. Greenfield used ""inbreeding"" as a metaphor in a way that speaks to what they did in Calauit Island and the Inbreeding of the Marcoses inching their way back into politics is its own form of of Parasitism.",2020-03-20,0

When I heard that, and I knew he wanted to be president so that he could maximize his wealth and talent, then I said to myself, ""Shame on you, Imelda. Here is the one man who's going to give up everything for you."" It really— it hurt us a lot, especially media-wise, because the problem with the media is, the gun can kill you only up to the grave, but the media can kill you beyond the grave into infinity.  I was only eight years old when I became orphaned. And when you lose your money— your, your mother, you lose everything.  If I'm going to the slum areas, I have to dress up and make myself more beautiful, because the poor always looks for a star in the dark of the night. Martial law, that was the best years of Marcos because that was when he was ale to give the Philippines sovereignty, freedom, justice, human rights.  Perception is real, and the truth is not.  I gave birth to what I dreamt of, and I always got my way. Now is the important thing, and so the past is past. There are so many things in the past that we should forget. In fact, it's no longer there.And finally,You're facing the mightiest sword of justice of the world, and you're alone, widowed, and homeless and countryless and penniless.

That being said, it did reinforce even more how how the Marcoses and Imelda in particular incredibly detached and self-absorbed to the point that they see no faults in themselves and their motivations and actions. They are genuinely the worst and it is saddening to see how quickly they have rose back to prominence. The film does a good job of building up Imelda as someone who at first seems okay only to later destroy her later on, particularly the sequences wherein Imelda would say one thing then would immediately be contradicted afterwards; it might be an effective way of getting the message across for someone who may be unaware of PH politics to not be sympathetic for them. And in the end, they are really the audience of this documentary. It scratches the surface with regards to the history of that time and circumstances of the now, and that's okay if it was intended to be that way.

The Kingmaker,"Very interesting and entertaining documentary on Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines who lived in a lavish lifestyle by plundering her nations wealthy, The Kingmaker is an in depth feature that chronicles her legacy. I found the film to be very good and shows that Marcos was quite deceptive and dishonest. It's quite an interesting film to watch and the way things are presented on-screen makes the viewer form his or hers own opinion on Marcos. The film is quite fascinating in what it does, yet I think more things could have been added to the film too. It's quite in depth, but the film could have been a bit longer too. Regardless the documentary covers enough ground to be a very thorough feature on its subject, and it is a very entertaining movie. The Kingmaker is entertaining from start to finish and the film features very good archival footage as well as interviews with Imelda Marcos and those who know her. We get both sides of the story and it is a well constructed genre film. The Kingmaker is worth watching and if you are interested in the subject, you'll find everything that you want out of this film.

The Kingmaker,"""They found no skeletons. Only beautiful shoes"" is just one of the many striking and unbelievable lines that came from former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos in Laura Greenfield's documentary ""The Kingmaker"". The line exhibits the nonagenarian's lavish perspective despite living in a third world country that suffered from the regime of her late husband and dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Greenfield's documentary shows how ""imeldific (ostentatiously extravagant)"" the mindset of Imelda despite the numerous human rights violations and embezzlement that happened during the Marcos regime. After all of her controversial past, it is beyond belief how Imelda is firm to declare that the Philippines was in its glory during Martial LawGreenfield portrays Imelda as someone who has a savior complex. Imelda believes that being the first lady means being a mother to everyone so she wants nothing but the best for Filipinos. She visits the streets while aboard her car and gives out money to children. She goes to the hospital and distributes huge bucks like its just coins to her. But being a mother is beyond giving money for Imelda. She wants to convert the country into a paradise that will be looked up by other countries. ""The Kingmaker"" gives light to the usually undiscussed Calauit Safari Park in Palawan. Imelda was in awe of Africa's beautiful safaris so she bought giraffes, zebras, monkeys, and more African animals and placed them on a small island. The film shows Imelda's inhumane mind when some residents of Calauit island detailed how the military evicted them in favor of the animals that are not even natives in the Southeast Asian Country. It later revealed that the animals there are not properly taken care of because of the absence of a veterinarian who specializes in safari animals. It's an antithesis to Imelda's own perception of being a mother to everything in the Philippines, showing that she's only obsessed with the aesthetic surfaceImelda has also risen to a new societal power when she was shown leading infrastructure projects and buying expensive New York buildings. At some point, it was also suggested that Imelda was the one running the country as her husband is falling ill. ""The Kingmaker"" shows Imelda as not just a first lady or the ""mother"" of Filipinos. She is also a puppeteer who can control everyone with the strings made out of Php 1,000 bills.Greenfield was able to show Imelda as an out-of-touch personality who still believes that her family has the solution to everything. However, one has got to ask if Greenfield wants to convince pro-Marcos and moderates to pick the other side. If she has that intention, unfortunately, The Kingmaker"" will just serve to them as a ""hate piece"" to the Marcos supporters and those who are in between. In fact, they may have encountered the 2003 documentary about Imelda but they are still firm on what they believe is right. Moreover, getting Marcos' opponents such as Vice President Leni Robredo and former President Noynoy Aquino (son of slain senator and fierce Marcos critic Benigno Sr.) as the opposing voices to Imelda will more likely fail to convince a lot of people. Hence, the discourse between the Pro- and Anti-Marcos will be just filled with tiring justifications of the authorities' actions.""Perception is real and the truth is not,"" Imelda said in the documentary. So, the question now is ""Which perception is Greenfield trying to appeal?"". Because if she's appealing to Marcos supporters, the documentary may lack in showing new information on Imelda's ridiculousness. Maybe except for the Calauit safari. The director could have focused her story on that island and meticulously unravel the fate of the residents and the animals there caused by Imelda's shallow vision of a perfect and paradise-like society.",2020-03-28,-1

The Kingmaker,"The greatest performance of Imelda Marcos. Deserves an award for being the most conniving, manipulative, and self-centered human... or is she even considered one? In her old age she's still convinced that she gave birth to the greatest era of the Philippines. Bong bong looks like a pet more than a son. You can see how he always seeks for his mother's approval. Imee just looks like the cheap dolls you get at divi — purely plastic. She even got her mother's big hair.Director Lauren Greenfield's documentary not only shows the two sides of politics in the Philippines, but also explains how perception is not that easy to deceive. From watching this film, I kept asking questions like ""How do the people not see it?"" or ""How did she get away with it?"". Honestly, Annalise Keating should take a lecture from her. You will see how quick and strategic the mind of the former first lady is which made things always go her way. I guess that's where her fallacious line ""Perception is real, truth is not"" comes in. We often attach ourselves to our beliefs and create layers of lies in order to protect them. There were a few significant events that were missed from the film. However, from what was shown I think it was enough to make you understand and even empathize on behalf of the victims.

And unsurprisingly, she's an ambitious, power-hungry person with delusions she's doing the right thing. This documentary is not trying to make you like her, but just understand her. And what I understand about her is not ... good. I really went into this thinking I was maybe going to end up liking her or at least having some sympathy for her, like she was just misunderstood. My takeaway was absolutely the opposite. She's worse than I thought she was.But as the political situation in the Philippines changed, I think Greenfield wasn't really equipped to keep up. It became more of a news story rather than a people story. And that's not her fault! As much as I think she's good at setting out to make one documentary and then ends up making another, in this case, it didn't quite work.

The Kingmaker,"Before watching this documentary, I was afraid that it will paint the Marcoses and the late dictator’s term in a good light; that it might be another attempt of the Marcoses’ on historical revisionism. During elementary school, the Marcos regime is dubbed as “The Golden Age of the Philippines”. The usual narratives are: the Philippines was one of the richest countries in Asia; when Marcos declared martial law, there was peace and order; and that he ended poverty. A lot of students are growing up thinking that he was the best president the Philippines ever had. Even I, at one point, believed that. Fast forward to high school, the Marcos dictatorship is once again discussed along with martial law. There I learned that media companies are shut down to censor information, and that he imprisoned his political opponents. However, accounts of torture and murder are not discussed. As I grow older, I encounter more documentaries and articles proving that during his term was not “The Golden Age of the Philippines” (though it might be for his cronies). Now that information is more accessible with the help of the internet, more information regarding the crimes of the Marcoses are revealed. I remember watching a video on Facebook wherein young people who grew up believing that Marcos is the best president of the Philippines are sat down with a victim of martial law. After the young ones tell why they thought Marcos was good president, the victims then narrate how they were tortured by Marcos’ men. However, the internet has also given a platform to Marcos apologists to propagate the narrative that the Marcos regime was best because of his infrastructure projects. This documentary has let Imelda tell her story without letting her control the narrative. It changed my perception on her position as a first lady. She was more than a lavish woman who indulges in shoes. She was more than an accessory to her husband. Her image as the muse of Manila has helped Marcos ascend into power, and helped him in connecting with other world leaders. Until now, she’s one of the reasons why her children (even after all they have done to this country) has been elected into government positions.

The Kingmaker,"""I don't have an answer for why we allow Imelda to even open her mouth."" - May Rodriguez, activisti go for busalan na si imelda!!!one of the things that struck me in this documentary is how the director has shone light on imelda's extensive influence on philippine politics. i thought this would be about how she is painted as an extravagant, greedy, narcissist (as is expected from a documentary about her), who is as accountable for all the crimes during the marcos regime as the dictator himself, but this goes way beyond that. until now, decades after the fall of her husband's regime, her family still has philippine politics spinning within its fingers, pulling a few strings to accord things to their own political agendas. the marcoses are not slowly making their way back to power. they never lost it in the first place and it's only because we let them. we let them revise our history, tell our children only their version of the story, and erase our truths. and for years, in a large part of the country, they've been winning. it's time to hold them, their cronies and allies, and everyone like them, accountable.#MarcosNotAHero #NeverAgain #NeverAgainToMartialLaw #OustDuterte #BusalanSiImelda2020",2020-03-29,0

The Kingmaker,"A good introduction to the atrocities made by the Marcoses.

The Kingmaker,"I was 10 or 11 years old in 1986 when the Marcos family fled the Philippines. I knew nothing of martial law or potential human rights atrocities. I got my news like everyone else--from Johnny Carson. Imelda Marcos' shoe collection provided a bevy of fodder for late night comedians of the era. I'm surprised that no clips were inserted into this documentary.I found this film to be fine, but a bit disappointing over all. It was one I was very much looking forward to since it made the rounds at film festivals last year. I never get to go to these festivals, but I try to look at the programming guide and make a schedule as if I was going. I always tried to find room for this film in my make believe schedule. Luckily for me, this film was available as part of a free Showtime weekend on Sling, so my wait wasn't as long as it could have been.I think the film's structure is its biggest obstacle. Not presenting the film mainly in chronological order hurts the storytelling in my opinion. I think that the film would have been better served by showing some present day Imelda then going back to her marriage and really focus on the time of the Marcos presidency/dictatorship. I never really fully grasped the politics of the country based on this documentary. The film kind of jumps around too much to paint a full picture of what was happening to the Filipino people.Perhaps the most egregious part of the film comes at the end titles. There is a lot of interesting information that is thrown up there to read instead of using time to show it on film. We spend a lot of time with Leni Roberdo (who ran against Bongbong Marcos for Vice Presdient), but then learn she suddenly have all of these charges against her by a suspect President! I want to know more about that! Why even bother including it?Despite the, in my opinion, lack of focus the film seems to present, it is compelling to hear the thoughts of Imelda. She remains one of the most infamous people of the late 20th century. But I'm not sure that this film ever allows the viewer to fully know her.",2020-03-30,0

The Kingmaker,"It’s a cliffsnotes version of the last near decade in the Philippines, and I do think this is the type of cultural artifact that Filipino documentarians cannot really package and broadcast - at the very least for now.The docu’s biggest strength is the way it captures Imelda’s twisted way of thinking. It’s very natural for her to downplay a lot of history, and to drive the narrative convincingly. It’s the same power you see in archival footage of “the Conjugal Dictatorship”, and the same power that is insinuated as puppetry- or at least sponsorship- for the currently sitting Duterte. The nugget quote “Perception is real and the truth is not” is the ironic essence of our time, delivered by the patron saint of Filipino boomers herself. It’s a reminder that what seems new and surprising in the valley of fake news, is just what is and what has always been to a certain breed of alligator.It should be noted that the docu scopes out a lot of nuance, atrocities and products of her Edifice complex in favor of an introductory contrast between the Marcos era and their rise back to power today. Yes, it includes heart wrenching testimonies of essential Martial Law era dissenters, and their harrowing experiences are just the tip of the bloody iceberg. But understandably, you can’t package all nuance into a digestible document, and the target audience is composed of non-Filipinos - but letting them know about the basic stuff is still pretty important.But I think the most important thing they gloss over is the corruption and/or callousness of what came after (it is mentioned, but it could’ve used a few more minutes) and why a nostalgic rose colored filter has colored many of those who lived through the toppling of the Marcoses. There’s a lot in the docu that many critics of the Marcoses already put forward, and a lot that his staunch loyalists deny (or recontextualize), and it’s unlikely to change local perceptions. For those who live in the thick of the topic at hand, a different approach to the documentation of this era seems more fitting.In two more years, the Philippines will either experience another political shift, or lead up to this slow burn of a Marcos return. It’s hard to predict what the Imeldific Kingmaker’s strategy is going to be about, but it likely will be the opposite of beautiful.",2020-04-04,0

The Kingmaker,The best thing about this film is that I'm 100% sure that Imelda had no idea how Greenfield was going to fuck her image over.

I'm already sick of Duterte but I guess y'all really had to put him there given recent events. Not surprising but it didn't bring out the intended impact in my opinion. I was hoping the film would only be on Imelda's delusional self because that was entertaining to see.Nice to see Borgy do a cameo as well. Wonder what he's up to now.Would never watch this again.

The Kingmaker,"""Perception is real, the truth is not.""It's a shocking admission, even by Imelda Marcos' standards. But what passes as lazy dialogue from a feature film becomes a damning confession in a documentary. Lauren Greenfield continues her treatise on the corrupting influence of wealth and power. But while Greenfield is retreading familiar territory in The Kingmaker, the sheer size and scope of this semi-biopic dwarfs any of her previous work. Imelda Marcos is a familiar subject for the Filipino people, but Greenfield recontextualizes the delusional former first Lady from within a nation run by President Duterte. The Marcos family is still as narcissistic as ever, and to no one's surprise, is still trying to weasel their way back into power.It's a story the Filipino people should already know by heart, but considering our goldfish memory, it's a story worth retelling until the end of time.As a documentary, The Kingmaker says nothing new.

The Kingmaker,"The documentary tries to present two sides of a coin, but ultimately reveals itself to be slanted in the right direction for humane reasons. It is political, gripping, and deeply personal to the Filipino's struggle for justice. The film becomes even more relevant with a narrative on Duterte and how everything potentially ties to the Marcoses' bid for power again. While I would have preferred there was less of Imelda being given the avenue to try and twist history, I know only the ignorant can be fooled by her delusions. Contrary to Imelda's belief, the truth exists and manifests itself to discerning people so that hopefully, we can truly say #NeverAgain.",2020-04-06,0
The Kingmaker,"Here is my position: we should never put Imelda Marcos in front of a camera. We should never give her access to any platform whatsoever, because it's just another opportunity for her to spout her lies, all shrouded under the guise of her being this doddering old woman with strange philosophies about beauty and mothering. I've been hearing her say the same goddamn things for my entire life, and this movie reveals nothing new in its extended conversations with this immortal tyrant.The film does actively undercut the things that she's saying, but it's an extra step. We do not need to talk to the Marcoses to explore their evil. We do not gain insight by spending time in their palatial homes, with their art and their clothes and all the aspirational bullshit that makes them weird antiheroes in this broken oligarchic society.The best parts of this film are the parts where it talks to victims, where it talks to the poor. The film tries to be clever with its juxtapositions, but the end effect is that it still gives voice to the lies, still allows a truly evil person to revise history. It opens up the possibility of accusations of bias, and letting them play the victim yet again when all they've ever done is victimize the Filipino.There are no two sides when telling the story of the Marcoses. They stole from the country, and tortured and killed thousands of people. Somewhere along the way, the film seems to come to the realization that Imelda isn't the harmless old biddy that they thought she was. But it's too late. They talked to her, and gave her yet another chance to say the vile things she's always been saying.",2020-04-06,0

The Marcoses should never have been given a platform that can make them spread more lies and instill their false ideologies of beauty and justice which always aims to trample on the powerless. Whatever platform that lets the Marcoses speak is a step with their inherent attitude of brainwashing every person into ignorance of the reality behind the aesthetics that Imelda brings with glamour and class. They continue to blind the people of the reality and blur the visions of those who have hope to still see the atrocities of their conjugal dictatorship. Imelda's mouth must be treated like a gas chamber where her words are poison to anybody's mind. It may have shown the two sides of history but it never settled how the Imeldific way of politics makes the poor poorer and the rich richer. It is like a pros and cons table where you always need to see that the Marcoses have done something right when in fact, they never did.

The Kingmaker,"The Kingmaker feels like a double-edged sword.On one hand this documentary exposes Imelda Marcos for the thieving liar and delusional old bitch that she is. Lauren Greenfield, the director, uses a careful juxtaposition of Imelda's outlandish pronouncements with testimonies from people who suffered and continues to suffer under their power to further highlight how ridiculous and unrepentant she is. It also does a good job in exposing how they perpetrated mediocrity and impunity through her children who are now trying to reclaim the political clout that they lost years ago. There is an undercurrent of rage in the entire documentary, as we slowly see this rotten family rebuild their reputation through deceit and political connections. It ends on a terrifying note: she and her family insist that we forget the past and move on to pave the way for their return. Yet on the other hand, it also needs to be said that this documentary also gave another opportunity for the Marcoses to repeat their lies. It humanized them in a way, and made it seem that there is another ""unheard"" side to the narrative of our nation. As one of the activists tortured during Martial Law said, ""I don't have an answer why we allow Imelda to open her mouth."" And that's exactly what this movie did. It allowed her to speak freely. Bad publicity is still publicity for these vultures. I am afraid they can twist this in their favor, knowing how cunning they are and how ruthless their propaganda machine is. I commend it for reminding us of who our enemies are, but it's also a documentary that I wish didn't get made. It's mere existence means we haven't learned our lesson yet.",2020-03-29,0

The Kingmaker,"Greenfield appeared more fascinated in than critical of Imelda as a singular political force. After all, Imelda made her out-of-touch decisions and delusions of grandeur unequivocally on her own terms. So when Imelda is framed as a “kingmaker” (for supporting Duterte, among other reasons), it fails to capture the frustrating circularity of Philippine politics; The Kingmaker disappoints inasmuch as it glosses over the political context Imelda thrives in and one that placed her back in power.This film is paler in comparison to - and most of the time repetitive of - Diaz’s Imelda (2003). For an unrepentant and corrupt political figure that has never been held to account, you can’t go soft; you go all out. When Imelda said, “sometimes it helps that you are not taken too seriously”, Greenfield seemed to agree with her.",2020-04-13,0

The Kingmaker,"“Perception is real, the truth is not.”Well, ain't that a 2010 quote if ever there was one.The Kingmaker is a documentary about the life and times of one Imelda Marcos, famous First Lady of the Philippines for 21 years. I was generally unaware of her history and her influence going into this, though I'm pretty sure I had an inkling about the shoe thing.The Kingmaker begins innocently enough, starting with Imelda herself. She goes through her history, her upbringing, her marriage, and her pride in the political power she had. She proclaims herself to be ""The mother of the nation,"" a symbol of hope to the masses. People love her, she says, and we're given no reason to think otherwise.Regular documentary viewers may know where this is going; we're being lulled into a false sense of security, before the filmmakers blindside us with a right hook and say, ""No, actually, this is how all that really went down.""And how. It becomes clear as The Kingmaker goes on that what we're seeing is a portrait of a raging narcissist, an inconsiderate dictator, and, in all likelihood, a mass-murderer. The film is directed by Lauren Greenfield, and while I've not seen any of her previous documentaries, I can tell looking at their descriptions - The Queen of Versailles in 2012, and Generation Wealth in 2018 - that The Kingmaker falls right into her wheelhouse of examining and deconstructing the insanity of the rich and powerful.Right from the start, Imelda Marcos cuts a fascinating, and infuriating, figure. The first thing we see her do in the film is ride around in her luxury limousine, passing by scenes of abject poverty and complaining, ""This used to be my little paradise. In my time, there were no beggars."" Somehow, I don't believe her. Later, we see her handing out giant wads of money to random passersby. This is something we see her do a bit, and we come to understand it's a regular occurrence; she will frequently walk around, or ride around in busses, handing out money to the impoverished masses, who obviously respond with gratitude. That's how she wins their hearts and minds, see.The film plays a tricky game with Imelda Marcos. Right from the start, we're encouraged to not take her at face value; the film highlights the inherently ridiculous nature of her appeals to mass popularity, and her assurance that she's just as powerful and beloved as she was in her prime, when none of that is clearly true. Basically, she begins the film as a clown, a totally ridiculous figure ripe for mockery. Not knowing the extent of her vileness, I assumed that this was a documentary about how a country was damaged through incompetence.Imelda Marcos begins The Kingmaker as a joke, and ends it as a monster. As the net of the documentary's eye widens, and more and more talking heads emerge to tell their stories of what it was actually like under Marcos dictatorship, the film repeatedly returns to Imelda's silent, resilient gaze, and we're forced to ask: ""Surely, there's no way you didn't know about this, right? After all, you were just bragging about how you were the secret power behind your husband. Surely, you knew?""In many ways, The Kingmaker is the perfect documentary for our time. because Imelda Marcos IS a clown; she's a vain, pompous, egotistical fool who at one point insists to the camera that she could've solved all the world's problems, because all the world leaders just found her so charming. But behind all that, there's this twisted image of a frilly despot, lounging away as her country starves, and her people are tortured. By her.The Kingmaker I think does an excellent job at painting Imelda Marcos into a corner from which she can't escape, using cutaway evidence and cross-testimony, all while keeping her unaware that this ""puff-documentary"" is actually a hit piece. I appreciate that there's never really a moment that The Kingmaker allows her to seem sincere; even when the extent to her monstrosity isn't quite apparent, she comes across as a complete egomaniac, with way too much while her country has way too little.But then things get serious, fast. There are hints as to something darker lurking under the surface early on; how she talks about the period of martial law being a golden age, or how she keeps the body of her husband perfectly preserved behind glass, which is just a horrific image. But then we hear about how she imported all these exotic animals to an island, only to abandon the project after the animals proved to be more trouble than they were worth. Those animals are still there, as cross-breeding catastrophes. We hear about the Tunnel of Love, which was built by Imelda's husband for her, and then became the name of a particularly grisly method of torture. And we follow a series of money trails, the end result of which is that the Marcos family seems to have been robbing their country blind.Even more worryingly, the film will frequently cut to the present, where we see Imelda masterminding her son's campaign to be Vice President of the Philippines (Vice President there is different than in America; it's a separate election than that of the President, and the VP generally has more responsibility than they do here), with the money she seems to have stolen directly from the people. It's here that the film begins to lose me a little; by playing with nonlinear chronology, it sometimes becomes hard to track the exact order of events as they happened. And every once in a while, I did find myself wondering, ""I wonder what was happening in the rest of the world at around this time?"" But the film does succeed at painting a portrait of wealthy insanity, damningly well. The image of Imelda Marcos, now elderly, on the cusp of re-achieving political dominance and still in complete denial about her family's evil legacy, is appropriately chilling.“There are so many things in the past that we should forget. In fact, it’s no longer there.”",2020-04-15,3
The Kingmaker,"After watching Queen of Versailles, I wanted some more documentaries in my life and went on to look at more of director Lauren Greenfield's work. The Kingmaker popped up and had actually been recommended to me before so I decided to watch. I had a VERY surface level understanding of the political world this documentary showcased. I think this is an example of really great, holistic documentary making. I came out of this with a much greater understanding of the topic without it being too bogged down in talking head interviews. The emotions kept hitting and there was just a really powerful storytelling arc put into place here. One of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time.",2020-04-16,0

The Kingmaker,"""Perception is real, and the truth is not.""All I knew about Imelda Marcos was that she was basically the Filipina version of Jackie Kennedy, with her terno sleeves and thousands of pairs of shoes. When the documentary starts, she talks about her role as a First Lady, her husband's infidelities, and her commitment to her country, not as a political official, but as a mother figure. As the film continues, it's clear that Marcos's ""mothering"" of the nation was nothing more than widespread mismanagement of government funds, corruption, and human rights abuses. I think that the documentary could have introduced this ""side"" of her sooner, because the first half an hour leads us to believe that she was a formidable force in Philippine politics who was relegated to the sidelines because of her sex. Maybe that's the editing, but it probably has something to do with Marcos's masterful manipulation skills. She knows what to say and how to spin situations, so the documentary is much more powerful when juxtaposing her propaganda with the testimony of real-life witnesses to her crimes. Crimes which, unfortunately, are not explored with much depth. I wish more time had been spent on martial law and her money laundering. However, the half an hour spent on the Marcos family's attempts to re-infiltrate Philippine politics is incredible. They've worked with the current president to arrest their opposition, jail the VICE PRESIDENT, and rig the Supreme Court, all to make Marcos Jr. the president. Imelda Marcos mentions that the country is full of ""forgiving"" people who love her because she was a ""good mother"" to them. I hope that, despite all their forgiving, the people don't forget.""Now is the important thing, and the past is the past. There are so many things in the past that we should forget. In fact, it's no longer there.""also, shoutout to Jocelyn Pook for an incredible score !!!",2020-04-16,3

The Kingmaker,"Being first generation American Filipino, I always crave any film that has to do with the motherland. Anything Asian really, perhaps because of the lack of representation? ahem ahem. And I notice there really aren’t many documentaries available about the Philippines (MAJOR lack of representation, being that we’re ALL over America and the world AHEM AHEM). But I digress.This documentary is a reflection of Philippines’ political history. It focuses on the reign of the Marcoses. Growing up in Hawaii I would here praises of the Marcoses, so I had a biased opinion of them already. But this documentary sheds some light on that. Any other people and also the opposing party know that the Marcoses ran a dictatorship and hid it under the pretense of democracy. He even enacted martial law and still I heard/and hear people praise him.Is this due to propaganda? Is it fake news? Is this just one side of the story? Many people say that the Aquinos were no different in their corruption. But this documentary does show the facts. Imelda was excessive, the Philippines is an impoverished country, and the citizens are broken.It also hints a stark comparison between the current reigning presidency and America’s current dicta- Ahem AHEM AHEM president. It’s chilling to think that America could one day follow in the dark past of the Philippines. The silver lining was seeing the stories of the survivors. There was a great quote, which I can’t remember of course, but to paraphrase it was something like, the power of democracy elects the president, and revolts ousts them. It shows that you can break the the country and it’s people, but you can not break their spirit. The revolution that ended the regime was a way to move forward. But the fight seems never ending.Alas, as long as there is corruption in government, the power will stay with the rich. I hope this documentary insights people to learn from the past, and learn the importance of reclaiming the reality in truth, and not perception.Oh.

The Kingmaker,"I'm not super familiar with Laura Greenfield's work, but in my limited knowledge of Generation Wealth and The Queen of Versailles, this is the perfect follow-up to those. I took a course about the history of the Phillippines and while it focused heavily on pre-1900s Phillippines, we, of course, discussed the Marcos regime towards the end of the class. Imelda Marcos is a fascinating character. The Marcos Family itself is just full of heinous characters. Ferdinand Marcos, obviously. But throughout the film, we also learn about Imelda and Bongbong, each awful in their own ways. It's a fascinating look in general at a nation that is going through and has gone through a TON of corruption in its recent history. Imelda is a perfect focus on a documentary like this not just because she is arguably one of the most powerful first ladies in all of the world's modern history, but because she is the perfect snapshot of obscene wealth. Imelda has Monet and Picasso paintings and an obscene amount of shoes and clothes. This all happening in a country that is shown to be going through a significant struggle with many of its citizens facing poverty. What puts this film over the top is that it's well-made. The title, The Kingmaker, refers to Imelda, not just with her husband and how she carried so much power especially socially, but we see her trying to build up her son to become that 'king' of the family in the present day. We also see the Marcos Family trying to make the 'king' of Duterte in order to get Bongbong in power quicker. The aspects of a photography shoot just went on to further highlight Imelda's ridiculous wealth. Perhaps most importantly, though, there is the discussion with opponents of the Marcos power that is able to contradict anything that Imelda may be lying about. This is not a film that glorifies Imelda by any means. It doesn't necessarily deal her a vicious takedown, but rather it gives the audience all the tools we need to make the obvious conclusion that Imelda, despite her sob stories and giving out pity-pay to begging children, is neither a good person, nor worthy of our sympathy.There are tons of incredible and sympathetic characters in this film, though. May Rodriguez's story is truly inspiring. Andy Bautista moving to Oklahoma after investigating Imelda out of fear of Duterte and Marcos is harrowing. The residents of the island that the Marcoses used for their private zoo share their story and it's beyond tragic. The zoo animals are the key metaphor for me. It's the tale of the Marcos Family starting something extremely extravagant, funding it well, then dropping it. Now, the animals just linger there, affected by inbreeding and disease. The ignoring of the animals mirrors the ignoring of the people in the Marcos regime and the refusal to own up and help in any real, tangible, way. Money to beggars on the street will not make up for the years of martial law and tactics used to whitewash history in the favor of Marcos.I think there are some occasions where this feels like it can drag, and by the end of the film it almost feels like an entirely different film than the start. I think that was intentional, but at times it almost seems to lose its own train of thought. I'd have rather had more Imelda stuff mixed in rather then leading with her biography -- but it truly wasn't too affecting to me. This is a well-made biographical documentary that is worth a watch because of how incredible it is.",2020-05-09,0

The Kingmaker,"“I don’t have an answer for why we even allow Imelda to open her mouth”The Kingmaker has the potential to be a protest documentary showcasing the Marcos problem before and now. But as the producers are thrown an issue that they can strike and provide a quality documentary exposing the Marcos dirt, they miss and instead give us a mediocre retelling of the dictatorship and a lousy exposition of a rising Marcos-like dictatorship in the county.There’s so much missing from The Kingmaker that irks me, and it’s all because of how reactionary it is.If what the documentary implies is that the Marcoses did so much bad things in the Philippines, then why would the documentary continue to just say “Marcos bad, and marcos continue to be bad”—why not go the extra mile? I was expecting for the documentary to go on a deep dive when they played the Marcos-Dovie Beams sex tape recording, because that recording is very rare. Sadly, the documentary only covers the tip of the iceberg.It also becomes reactionary as the Filipino people also become only extras in this film. Marcoses are the evil ones, Aquinos restored democracy, Duterte is Marcos part II. No, this is not the case and just asserts the status quo of Philippine politics in which someone has to be the face of fascism or the resistance. The film forgets that Marcos had cronies and was backed by the imperialist U.S., the film forgets that the Filipino people and many grassroots activists started the movements against Marcos, the film forgets that the Aquinos also became like Marcos and killed activists and farmers, and the film also skips over the numerous large anti-Marcos burial protests. The film forgets the most essential people: the Filipino people that she oppressed, and the people that ousted her.I know you’re wondering, “This is a documentary about Imelda, why look into a broader perspective?”Because the film implies it. The film implies that the Marcoses did bad things, so why not go deeper and deeper into exposing that. Why not go deeper into the Oplan Tokhang and other human rights violation we continue to face here in the Philippines? This was released in 2019, and there has been so much things skipped over. The documentary tries to be a strong anti-Marcos film, but just becomes a reflection of the political atmosphere of the country: figure-based, glossing over information, and negligent of the actual plight of the masses.MARCOS, DUTERTE, WALANG PINAGIBA!

The Kingmaker,"Si bien es un documental muy clásico en su forma. La directora, Lauren Greenfield, encuentra en la edición, la fórmula narrativa perfecta para contarnos de manera sumamente detallada y comprensible -contraponiendo los puntos de vista de los actores involucrados-, la distorsionada realidad histórica que Imelda Marcos -primera dama de Filipinas durante 21 años- tiene sobre ella misma y de su papel en la política de Filipinas en la década de los sesentas y hasta la actualidad.Un retrato brutal, cruel, terrorífico y sin juicios de valor, sobre un perfil político popular que hoy en día se está reproduciendo de manera acelerada e inimaginable en todo el mundo.",2020-05-12,0
The Kingmaker,"I love how the filmmaker would contrast Imelda's delusional statements with snippets of reality, but I do believe that former first lady shouldn't be allowed to open her mouth in the first place. This is just giving her another platform for historical revisionism and her family's attempts to get back to Malacañang. Can we focus more on the fact that she's officially been convicted guilty of graft and corruption - like where tf was that???",2020-05-16,0
The Kingmaker,"""The Kingmaker"" is woefully short and doesn't really break any new ground when it comes to telling the Marcos story. We've seen and heard this before just with the added ""revelation"" that Duterte is their proxy candidate — which is kinda obvious already back then even without tin foil hats. If the goal is to make their transgressions known more, I doubt it'll work because you can't convince the pro-Marcos/DDS guys to listen to anything that slights their idols. If you want to ""correct"" how the youth perceives Martial Law then that's the institutions fault, not a documentary's job. And the voters that matter (the EFG class) likely wouldn't have access to it and probably wouldn't care anyway since the documentary explicitly shows that you can easily subjugate them by doling out cash (and I don't blame them). The middle class already know them and what they did (and mostly loathe them for it), so you're preaching to the choir.What I wanted to see (and disappointingly didn't) was Miriam Santiago since she was part and parcel of that attempt to consolidate the family's power grab and an unapologetic supporter dating back to her days as their speech writer — yet escaped that entire chapter unscathed and with her public image of this revered meritocratic what-if intact. Hell, she's still clawing her way into our social media feeds despite lying six feet under many years later (e.g. alleged clairvoyant of the pandemic with a bill she filed once but never bothered to follow through). You can at least correct the people who believe that.",2020-05-12,0

The Kingmaker,"""The Kingmaker"" is subtle with how it depicts the cunning and devious ways of Imelda Marcos. Actually, it's up to you as the viewer to decide who to side with - Imelda's words or the stories of those who have been oppressed by her family's decisions in the past. Regardless, ""The Kingmaker"" is a well-balanced documentary that is entertaining as it is cunningly disturbing.It's the 2016 elections and Imelda Marcos is on a mission to make her son Bongbong Marcos the next vice president of the Philippines. Along the way, we get to know the life and the psyche of the woman before she married Ferdinand Marcos, their power during his presidency, and the eventual downfall of their family in 1986 People Power revolution, and their plot to wipe off her family's sinister reputation especially with the younger generation.From its first few minutes, we see Imelda Marcos calm, cool, and collected. Her charm undeniable and even we, as Filipinos, started believing her words. But Lauren Greenfield does amazing work as she subtlety unveils the perceptive reality that Imelda tries to convey against the backdrop of real people who experienced great tragedy through the actions of her and Ferdinand Marcos. The film's tagline uses Imelda's own words that ""Perception is real, and the truth is not."" is the very real horror in this film. If ever she believes her own lies or lies to the heart to get away with guilt, the truth is that almost everything she started failed to prosper in the long run. It's a reflection of both past wrongs that her family did and the present wrongs that Filipinos are experiencing with its modern politicians. Surprisingly, Lauren Greenfield doesn't force much to assassinate the character of Imelda Marcos as Imelda herself unravels herself. The documentary doesn't really side with any party equally portraying the biases of the other camp. Overall, ""The Kingmaker"" is a film that every Filipino should watch. It's a warning sign that we really need to remember the sins of the past and that our forgiving nature as a populace is our own undoing in the long run.Source: www.reeladvice.net/2020/05/the-kingmaker-movie-review.html",2020-05-16,0

Her type of mothering is all sorts of preposterous. The film is mostly neutral, but it presents hard-hitting facts and authentic interviews from the victims. It paints a sordid picture of the Marcoses’ twisted agendas with their political power, as they hold their servants in shackles.When all has been said and done, the film sparks anger towards the perpetrators, pity towards the misinformed, and confidence towards the changemakers.I am scared of where this country is headed with politicians in position now lacking the heart of service and compassion.

The Kingmaker,"‘The Kingmaker’ se enfoca en la Primera Dama de Filipinas, Imelda Marcos (a la cual ubicaba siempre de ese excelente disco conceptual de David Byrne y Fatboy Slim). Aquí, la directora Lauren Greenfield nos adentra no sólo a la historia política de su familia (la cual continua hasta la actualidad entre escándalos de corrupción con el actual presidente y la campaña de vicepresidencia de su hijo, Ferdinand), sino con la opulencia de su estilo de vida. Greenfield siempre ha tenido una fascinación por la decadencia de la clase alta y con Marcos ha encontrado un sujeto perfecto. ‘The Kingmaker’ me parece su mejor trabajo, como una crónica plagada de corrupción y despotismo. Este documental formó parte de la selección de Ambulante en casa. Muy recomendable.",2020-05-20,0
The Kingmaker,"Throughout the film there were various commentaries from people and the fact that they weren't positioned in the same background with the exact same static angle was very interesting- each person that gave a commentary gave it in the comfort of either their own home or office with a full frontal view, giving off a feeling of rawness and vulnerability as they spoke, luring the audience to full believe in what they say. In terms of audio, there was one mellow melancholy tune that would play whenever a devastating/unfortunate event was brought up, which would of course elevate the feeling of loss and damage- these two feelings are important because that's the main goal of the documentary: for the people to feel the loss and damage that has happened to the Philippines and the people because of the abuse of power by the Marcos family.Although the film revolved around Imelda, I deeply appreciated how it did not feel biased at all. The people behind the film didn't just interview and capture people in awe of Imelda, but also brought in people who found the family and their doings unjust. You would expect this documentary to be very one-sided, but instead you get two sides battling each other- although it's subtle in the documentary, it's something that is actually happening in real life in the Philippines even up to today.It was clear that Imelda was trying to paint this picture-perfect image of herself to the audience. She repeatedly states that she lost her mother and that she believes she is the mother of the Philippines and that she ""birthed"" all these great and beautiful things, my only question is: where? Throughout the film I could feel nothing but indecencies coming out of her mouth. I firmly believe in ""actions speak louder than words"" and there's one scene in the whole documentary that really stood out to me- the scene where Imelda picks up the frame and the other frames fall on the floor. She acts as if nothing happened, she does not even acknowledge, and she goes on and talks about the picture frame she's holding as a worker of her shyly cleans up the broken pieces of glass on the floor. This scene is really interesting as she says all these good things about herself and all yet a small act such as recognizing the frames falling and seeing the worker clean up after her she cannot acknowledge and help. This is very reminiscent of her as a first lady and the Marcos Family- they see what they want and they get it without hesitation, complete unaware of the mess they left behind for the Filipinos to clean up. In addition, throughout the film she mentions that throughout her reign as first lady, she was friends with powerful people all across the globe, further proving how unaware she is of her and herhusband’s doings. She states that she is disgusted with how the government and Philippines is now however she is completely delusional as she doesn’t realize that her and her family has contributed to how the Philippines is no longer “paradise”.Lastly, it’s interesting how this film was made by someone that is not a Filipino. I’m not sure why someone who has no close ties to the Philippines would make a documentary about something so notorious, however, perhaps the fact that it’s so notorious is probably the reason why it was made by the director in the first place. I wondered why no one in the Philippines has made something like this- is it because we are scared of the consequences? Is it because it would be full of bias? Whatever the reason is, I think that the fact this film was made by someone looking at the outside in really gives us a non-biased and equal perspective, as well as a clear division on fact and truth.My gripe with this documentary is how it felt that it shifted to Duterte and that it meandered from Imelda and the main topic on hand, however, I can't really rule this out as the documentary was stating facts and the fact about the Marcos' funding Duterte was vital for people to know.This film was a beautiful yet disturbing layout of Philippine History. Everything was presented in a way that would benefit the feeling and mood of the film. It’s definitely not for people who are very sensitive to the Marcos’ as this film obviously dives deep into them and Imelda’s delusions. Imelda may have thought that this film would bring her and her family justice, however personally, it just justified why the Philippines and its people are having hardships today.Cheers to Lauren Greenfield and her team for doing a fantastic job.",2020-05-21,0

One of the main faults is that it only tries to throw bad light at the Marcos family when the entire system is dirty. Someone should make a proper non-biased portrait of the political climate in the country, for it's an absurd observation of lazy corruption and intrigue.

The Kingmaker,"Disclaimer: This is gonna get political due to the fact that I am anti-Marcos and have strong sentiments against dictatorship and media censorship.The Marcos regime has remain to be the most controversial administration in the Philippines. Not only for the numerous allegations and charges that they face, but also for the parade of affluence and wealth of their family. As per the records of anti-corruption agencies, their family has been accused of corruption, violation of human rights, and just recently, perpetration of fake news.Corruption is heavily evident and prevalent in the country. From the local sectors to the national government, it is known to be the root cause of poverty, crime and poor education system. During the Marcos administration, it has been reported that the amount of their so-called ‘ill-gotten wealth’ amount to billions worth of US dollars. In this documentary, they showed some of the acquired properties given to Imelda by his late husband, whom she claimed to be generous for procuring the overseas assets from his hard-earned money. He showered her with innumerable luxurious jewelries and glamorous clothing; All throughout their ruling, Imelda lived like a queen. Hence, the obscene lifestyle and wealth enabled the dictator to extend his presidency and maintain their power that ultimately led to more contentious advances.People power eventually transpired amid chaos fueled by the assassination of Senator Ninoy Aquino; However, it should be noted that it was not the main reason why the resistance emerged. Martial law had been implemented for 8 years – the dark times in Philippine history when human rights and freedom of speech were unheard of - in response to burgeoning hostility that place their throne under threat. Some of the victims, who were mostly activists, spoke of their personal accounts of torture and sexual harassment inflicted onto them by the military/police officials. There were approximately 35,000 Filipinos who went through the same traumatizing experience for speaking out against the misconducts of the government. Opposition groups were silenced, and the media was shutdown. The only voice ever allowed to be heard was from the Conjugal leaders whose reign finally ended after the historic revolution.Until now, the country’s perception of the Marcoses is considerably divided due to the propaganda planted to uphold the legacy of their family name. Despite the charges against them, they still cling onto their false conviction of being trustworthy and country-loving officials as the piles of papers become obsolete edifices. The agencies that are tasked to investigate their family failed to bring them to court and make them admit to their blatant wrongdoings, which is saddening on my end as it’s been ages since the bloody dictatorship took place. Nonetheless, the dark turn of events in the past in relation to the Marcoses’ political careers did not halt the desire to make Malacañang their home once again. In 2016, Bong Bong Marcos, ran for the elections to become Vice President but was greeted by a narrow defeat by Leni Robredo. Since then, he has been attempting to prove that the incumbent VP cheated the elections and thwarted his ascendancy to the position for their contrasting political parties. He had to come up with a plan to gain support from the people and resort to the most accessible propaganda machine: social media. Based on the data gathered from Cambridge Analytica, President Duterte and Bong Bong Marcos are the biggest users of trolls for spreading fake news particularly on Facebook in the Philippines.In my opinion, the administration of Marcos has put the Philippines on the line. Never again to Martial Law. Never again to the dreary cycle of fraudulent conduct, abuse of power, and proliferation of revisionists that are bound to resurface as these unlawful acts are deeply ingrained in their name. Political dynasties ruin the foundation of governance and neglect the needs of the Filipino citizens in favor of their personal interests. Thus, the only way to elude the same fate is to hold the perpetrators accountable and never ever elect them again.",2020-04-30,0

The Kingmaker,"Watched as research for my podcast theatlasbrothers.podbean.com/ for our upcoming episode on The Philippines.The Marcos' reign was clearly a dark period for the nation, although some clearly look back on it with less negativity than others. That's not to say that the country's citizens have been living it up since then - this documentary clearly displays the poverty still experienced by many today.But where Imelda & her family stand out is their mysterious (or maybe not so) riches. And what's worrying about that is the power it gives them to return to politics in The Philippines, whether it's through Bongbong Marcos himself, or through Rodrigo Duterte. More concerning yet is the police brutality the documentary shows has returned in Duterte's presidency. It is sad that the blatant stealing of a nation's wealth has led a family to preventing the social or political evolution of said nation.The documentary itself, is well put-together.

The Kingmaker,"This is a really great documentary. On the surface it is a film about the controversial former first lady of the Philippines Imelda Marcos. In reality, though, this film is about something much deeper, an inside look at the troubling dynastic political landscape of the Southeast Asian country. The Marcos presidency was one marked by scandal, corruption, and crime. The film allows Marcos to provide her version of events, her side of the story, but Lauren Greenfield is too smart a filmmaker to allow Marcos to control the narrative. Greenfield is brilliant in how she sets up her scenes, including moments before and after a given 'take' that showcase and highlight Marcos' narcissism and penchant for self indulgence. Greenfield also provides contrasting points of view, footage that provides context, background, and that conflicts with and juxtaposes the words Imelda Marcos spews. This is a woman whose control and corruption are well known and documented, and Greenfield, a director who makes films about the rich and powerful without glorifying their lifestyles but in fact showcasing everything wrong with them, is the person to tell this story.Eventually the film shifts from being a biodoc on Marcus to the current political landscape in the Philippines, Marcos pushing her son to run for president, and the corrupt state of the Filipino political world and how power is constantly transferred between members of the same few families and how little it has to do with the good of the people, who do not factor in at all with the story, they're not even backdrop for the rich, powerful, and influential, and Greenfield makes this abundantly clear. For the Marcos family, and anyone else running the country, it is all about power, wealth, and notoriety and nothing else. Their aspirations are as vacuous as their sense of taste - they accumulate so much, but ultimately all they have to show for it is a lifetime of horrific behavior, crimes against humanity, and a dark soul and evil heart.

The Kingmaker,"“Perception is real. Truth is not.”I wish this was just a harmless portrait of a larger-than-life woman with delusions of grandeur who owned way too many pairs of shoes. Unfortunately, it’s also about how her family, who has stolen billions that the country is still trying to repay, has slowly returned to power. The Kingmaker never clearly states who is telling the truth. It just shows you Imelda Marcos’ account of events during the Marcos dictatorship, then pits that account against what everyone else is saying. The stories of the experiences of Martial Law victims are particularly heartbreaking, but it doesn’t end there. Just as heartbreaking are scenes where current students in a Metro Manila high school are asked about what happened during Martial Law, and their answers range from “our country’s golden age” to “there was peace and order.” And now Imelda is a member of Congress, Imee is a Senator, and Bongbong was a few hundred thousand votes away from being Vice President. The docu is not without its shortcomings, but more people need to see this. Because they need to know. Because we must never forget.PS.

The Kingmaker,"Documentary filmmaker Lauren Greenfield established with THE QUEEN OF VERSAILLES a talent for digging into and laying bare how the obscenely wealthy will stop at nothing in the pursuit for luxurious, expensive goods that make them feel validated in their gilded bubble of privilege. With THE KINGMAKER, Greenfield extends her fascination with this habitual overindulgence to the realm of politics, where a rich person's gluttonous spending and consuming means that money is being denied to a whole lot of people whose welfare the rich person is ostensibly meant to care for. Former First Lady of the Philippines Imelda Marcos is the focus of Greenfield's probing, involving study of despotic decadence, and when we're given a glimpse of a closet housing Marcos' 1,000+ pairs of nice shoes, it's pretty impossible as an American viewer not to think of how our current President once counted a solid gold toilet as one of his prized possessions.As an interview subject, Marcos is more shrewd at polite evasions and even-tempered rationalizations than Trump ever has been, so Greenfield's interviews with Filipino activists, former political prisoners, and other residents end up being more illuminating than her sit-downs with the woman at the film's center. But while the lack of hugely revealing soundbites from Marcos is a flaw of this solid documentary, it's not one that Greenfield should realistically shoulder the blame for. If non-fiction filmmakers focusing on politics were expected to find and interview only wealth-hoarding rulers who are as rivetingly dumb and vicious as Trump is, it's likely they'd never get any work done.",2020-07-06,0
The Kingmaker,"Lauren Greenfield makes some of the most compelling displays of ego and wealth in documentary cinema. Imelda Marcos is easily the most ambitious target that’s been focused on the opposite end of her camera’s lens. The first couple of minutes, I thought I was essentially watching ‘Queen of Versailles’ again, but set in the Philippines. Especially when we have clips of Marcos handing children dollar bills from the side of her car to the poor citizens of Manilla, and an extended moment of Marcos boast about a photograph in her courtyard while ignoring a bunch of broken picture frames she knocked over getting quietly cleaned up by the Help. But the truth is slowly dripped out, and the film shows a much less “ignorant” and “vain” version of this person, but one that is much more insidious and corrupt.",2020-07-05,0

The Kingmaker,"It's pretty crazy how charisma works on many levels. In The Kingmaker, we see explore this through the Marcos regime and its aftermath (and perhaps future).We see Imelda sitting in her apartment, surrounded by the riches and the beauty she always seems to strive for. Some can probably note the piece behind her as something in the style of Picasso, and yes, it is definitely a Picasso. She even proudly confirms this herself.Imelda has a way with words. She interweaves her personal stories with sentiment, nostalgia, and this whole schtick with maternity (I'll get to that later). It's as sugar-coated as it is convincing, especially if you don't know much about the Marcos family or if your Filipino history game is a bit lacking. Outsiders who are out of the loop may sympathise, and the Filipino viewers -- most of who are tired and weary -- may even be captivated by her through their last shred of hope. But this is where it gets good. I really like how Greenfield lets Imelda talk, then juxtaposes it with accounts from multiple people. The selection was very interesting, with the roster including people who sympathise with -- and fought against --the Marcos regime back in those days. It even includes people who are currently in office (at least during the time of this review). Then suddenly you, the viewer, realise that Imelda's words are like a house of cards. My favourite example of this is Calauit Island, where Greenfield not only tells but shows exactly what exactly it had done to both the animals and people who lived there decades later. This style of show-and-perhaps-contradict repeats throughout the documentary, and Greenfield lets it all speak for itself. You, the viewer, doesn't really have to be told outright that Imelda is a narcissist: it just comes out. She tries to hide it around this whole thing about how she is the, and I loosely quote, ""mother of the world"". That it perfectly justifies the reason why her son should be in power, and how they were actually doing a good thing (this includes her husband's regime). But through the help of the accounts of others, The Kingmaker paints a disturbingly beautiful picture created by the brushstrokes of horror, pain, and struggle that trickles down even in modern Filipino society. While Imelda sits in places of extravagance, and The Kingmaker, does not hesitate in making us remember where exactly all that money came from. A few notes:- Trigger warning on sexual abuse and torture. I was honestly so mad the whole time May Rodriguez was telling her story. I was so mad for her, and mad that she experienced what she did. Sexual abuse is never okay. - @ the guy who had to pick up those glass shards: I see you, and you are valid.- Does require a basic knowledge of who Marcos is and everything. Since this whole doc is mostly focused on Imelda and their lifestyle, it doesn't delve deep into more of the questionable stuff they've done.- I'd say this doc requires a viewer who is open-minded and can look at things objectively. If you are considering to showing this to your nanay, tatay, and other members of the family, I'd say your chances of making them reconsider their stances are 50/50. I found that it's very easy to attach yourself to Imelda + family and ignore everyone else in this doc, especially if your (insert family member here) has an aversion to Leni Robredo -- who shares a decent amount of screen time in this doc.",2020-07-18,0

The Kingmaker,"It's quite suspicious how this film is framed. From the title itself, it has this desire to say that there's a powerful woman behind every king. It got so tied up to that idea that once they discovered that she's nothing but a depthless, condescending woman, it tried to do damage control by interviewing real victims instead. This came out ingenuine. It wants to be colored using the feministic lens that it failed to deliver that there are also women who cultivate and enable murderers. And, who's to say that the Filipino people are incapable of nurturing tyrannical kings too?The Kingmaker fosters the perception that Imelda protects so much. In her words, ""Perception is real, and the truth is not."" Her audacity to say that truth is subjective takes me to my wit's end. Plus, the way she keeps talking about the ultimate goal of her life is to birth a country nourished by her ""motherly"" traits, and, for a while, she's been blessed to be that mother—the Filipino's mother, our mother. If I don't tell you right now ma'am. The only blessing you've received is having a mouth and you've already sinned the moment you opened it. Putangina mo sagad.One thing that I found interesting in this film was the way it illustrated the parallelism of the mini zoo, that the Marcoses have sheltered in Calauit, to the Marcos' clan. Likened to the giraffes and zebras, they're all inbred to create a perilous kingdom—a political dynasty. The one that has been going on for years. They're in a land where they are not welcome, and their inbreeding is almost a tactic to force themselves to remain here—a land that's not theirs to rein. The locals of Calauit gets it. Every day, this mini zoo serves as a reminder that the country is a living circus with power-thirsty freaks. Punyeta hahaI wish the film could have centered more on the victims. They were already there—they interviewed the right people, made them resurface the trauma that stemmed from the injustices during Marcos' regime. It was unfair to give this woman a spotlight. She doesn't deserve to be on-camera at all. We've gone beyond the need for Imelda Marcos to exist. It's time that we burn her along with her 3,000 pair of shoes.",2020-08-01,0

The Kingmaker,"The Kingmaker is a 2019 documentary film written and directed by Lauren Greenfield, featuring the political career of Imelda Marcos with a focus on the Marcos family's efforts to rehabilitate the family's image and to return to political power, including her plans to see her son Bongbong become President of the Philippines, and the alliance that Bongbong and Imee Marcos established with Rodrigo Duterte in his bid to win the 2016 Philippine presidential election.This documentary lays bare the vile nature of the political strategies deployed by the Marcos family. Ferdinand Marcos is deservedly portrayed as a fascist capitalist dictator. But their greed and lust or power does not stop there. After Ferdinand dies and is denied a funeral in the Philippines, they deploy covert secret strategic tactics to regain power, status and regain their former political reign. They abuse social media to spread lies, use smear campaigns to get back their political power, kill power, oust people who intervene in their plans. The list of vile crimes is endless. I was shocked by the fact that the Philippine people still believed in the Marcos family even after Ferdinand Marcos had 30.000 people killed. For some unknown reason they still vote for Imee Marcos, Ferdinand's daughter, and later on even for Bong Bong, Ferdinand's son. Thd most vile betrayal is the political ruse of letting the people believe that Duterte is a better option than Imelda Marcos. In actuality the Marcos family had struck a deal with Duterte, a former minister in Marcos' government, for the mere purpose of letting Duterte become president. Once Duterte becomes president he removes all those who do not agree with Marcos' views. Duterte when inaugurated acts just like his former co-conspirator Ferdinand Marcos. Hence he kills people. and keeps the people in check by oppression. Duterte even abolishes the PCGG, the committee which works towards getting all the money stolen by Marcos. The leader of the PCGG is charged with corruption and fraud. Similar action are taken against the vice president Robredo. At present, Duterte has imprisoned most people who oppose Marcos. Furthermore, Imee has become a senator in the northern region of the Philippines. Duterte, and the Marcos family are now working towards having Bong Bong inaugurated as the new president of the Philippines. So the evil of the Marcos family is about start all over again.",2020-08-02,0
The Kingmaker,"A ridiculously intimate view into the life of Imelda Marcos and the legacy she has left behind. It’s unthinkable how power concentrated in the hands of two people—herself and her husband, back when he was still President—could rip apart the lives of millions, but this documentary leaves no stone unturned in its unflinching exploration of history as shaped by them.The first half of the documentary is laughable, satirical almost, as one listens to Imelda’s own retelling of past events, perfected to a crisp with rehearsed smoothness. But the second half is a punch in the stomach, once Greenfield pieces together various stories regarding the political scene in the Philippines to flesh out a portrait of greed, corruption, lavishness and cruelty that now runs through generations. Not only do the effects of the Marcos regime still reverberate deeply through the country today, it feels almost as if they have never left with their relentless quest to return to power. The photography is straightforward but agile; the editing simple but powerful; the soundtrack eerie but compelling. Put together, there cannot be a title more aptly descriptive about the rise (and fall and rise again) of Imelda than “The Kingmaker”.",2020-08-01,0

The Kingmaker,"In this day and age where corruption is widespread in my own land, it is most disheartening to see these political families achieve the full potential of their own charisma towards the blind masses. Backstabbing is irrelevant in my country as these politicians outrightly plunder from their own people. Filipinos are groaning and moaning since the Spanish rule, but to have this injustice come from your own countrymen is truly disgusting.Although unique from each other, the message is the same with the strong contemporary documentaries released within the first years of President Duterte’s administration such as A Thousand Cuts and Aswang. Compared with the two however, Lauren Greenfield’s film is more well-edited, hinting parallelisms from the past Marcos administration with the current government, making Imelda Marcos as the bridge that kept filling the gap between the two. Grandiose and almost royal in manner, I see Imelda in a two-headed monster having one neck that is filled of delusions of grandeur. The monster’s other head died, and as the head was cut off and laid unfortunately to rest amongst the honorables, one head continues to rise. And with these heads, a neck kept on and keeps on turning these heads to serve their own selfish purpose. This ardent and repugnantly wide neck is Imelda herself. Being true to her brand, Imelda blatantly shows wealth, which is a manifestation of her own understanding of beauty and love. But hidden beneath her clamor were the suffering of many Filipinos: from the residents of Calauit island to the murder and rape victims of Martial Law and to all the Filipinos, to whom the Marcoses are still accountable for. She stood by Ferdinand Marcos dictatorial rule and she’s standing by Bongbong’s political route to power. The rise and fall and their rising again feels like that Filipinos are inside a horror movie wherein it doesn’t matter how many times you kill the monster. Rest assured that after the end credits, a resurrection will be shown, which will birth a series of never-ending sequels. A truly scary state for an already aching country, a disease-stricken country.With our body there are lots of checks and balances that maintain homeostasis. Likened to a well-oiled machine, it is very organized up to a certain point wherein a harmful external factor can damage the whole organism. With my country, it seems that there’s a gradual reversal of this homeostasis. Slowly creeping in in the very own checks and balances of this country’s institutions. And without recognition from its own members, it will persist, continually making the whole country sick and killing its people one by one until there are no more Filipinos worth dying for.As a healer by profession, I tend to the sick. And whenever I encounter patients who I know have a lower chance of survival, wherein limitations of science and the practice of medicine are fully exhausted, it eats me to the core. There is so much that I can do to save a life, but one can’t save them all. The same feeling of hopelessness is what I feel with my country. A dim reflection I know, but by not stating this singular groan from a citizen, societal problems will not be recognized.

The Kingmaker,"A very fascinating snapshot into the history of Filipino politics and the Marcos’ (nasty) dynasty. I’ve heard about Imelda’s crazy excessive extravagant lifestyle, but didn’t realize it was more than just that. As an outsider, I can’t help but feel sad for Filipinos whose lives could have been so much better if not for the corrupt Marcos government.",2020-08-06,0
The Kingmaker,"""If these people [the Marcoses] will be brought to power again, there's a very big chance that the sins of the past will be committed again in the future.""The Kingmaker managed to acclimate the political situation here in the Philippines, both then and now. When I was 8 years old, I remember my father brought a CD of Imelda (2003) when he came home from work in Manila. I had a vague memory of me watching this film on TV, together with my family, when Netflix or any streaming services weren't concepted yet. Little did I know that beyond the tapestry of all Imelda's extravagant furniture and her infamous 3,000 pair of shoe collection shown in the film, is a lady who stood by a tyrant and a dictator, who's ill-gotten wealth is being paid off by the Filipino people up to this very moment.What's even more baffling is the fact that in The Kingmaker, Imelda claims that the era of Martial Law in the Philippines upheld ""sovereignty, freedom, justice, and human rights"" in our country. Excuse me, Ma'am? Last time I checked, the Martial Law era perpetuated exactly the opposites of what you claimed--it was the darkest and most brutal time in the Philippines. Journalists were executed, activists were tortured and arrested, and newspaper outlets were silenced. I am outraged. It saddens me how students here define Marcos' era as being peaceful and disciplined, as per reflected in the documentary. It's as though all extrajudicial killings, arrests, and tortures never even took place. I really hope colleges would mandatorily employ Martial law studies in order to revisit the past, and scrutinize where things have gone wrong. I'm glad how this documentary also pointed out the current Duterte Administration. Vis-a-vis Marcos' era as a point of reference, I could enunciate a number of similarities between their presidencies. It's like reliving the past and the horrors all over again. God bless the Philippines. Catch me on the road to Mars whenever time permits so. #NeverForget#MarcosNotAHero",2020-08-07,0
The Kingmaker,"“I was always criticized for being excessive, but that is the spirit of mothering! You cannot quantify love!”This film does an excellent job capturing Imelda Marcos as both a charismatic, captivating force of nature (still! at ninety!) AND as a batshit crazy tyrant. Greenfield’s interviews with the controversial dictatorial matriarch provide shocking, probably unparalleled access into the views of a woman reflecting with pride upon half a century of corruption. For me, the most insane new understanding gleaned from Marcos’ life-story is that while we like to simplify “evil” as the act of doing wrong for the sake of self-interest, Marcos truly seems to believe that her greed and self-martyrdom and megalomania and family dynasty building is good for the Philippines and the world. And that upside-down vision of morality is far scarier than a complete lack of it. At one point in the film, Marcos declares: “perception is real, and the truth is not.” That belief is likely the single greatest threat to humanity. Holy fuck.",2020-08-06,0

Flaunting her fashion, wealth, life, and motherhood makes me so goddamn angry and cringe at the same time. I just can’t believe she has this platform to talk about her nonsense.I appreciate how Lauren Greenfield, a foreigner, has been so eager to share this story so the wider world can learn about the past horrors in the Philippines under the Marcos regime, which are repeating themselves under the Duterte administration. However, this film felt neutral and detached from the harsh reality faced by the victims of the Marcos regime. Maybe it’s because it’s coming from a filmmaker who didn’t experience martial law firsthand and grew up far from the story, relying only on research.It remains too safe, and the juxtaposition of ideas doesn’t really work for this kind of topic. People in the Philippines who experienced martial law and those who grew up hearing the horrifying stories and studying the history—we know that Ferdinand Marcos is no hero, and we will never forget his evil deeds. There is only one side to the story about the Marcoses: they are monsters. It scares me that this documentary might confuse people who aren’t familiar with the Marcos regime, and worst of all, they might feel sympathy for the Marcos family.",2020-08-08,0

The Kingmaker,"The rise and fall of Imelda Marcos and the Marcos family, and their attempt to rise to power once more.I find Imelda's story tragic in my opinion because I honestly believe that she was a really strong and intelligent woman back in the day for having that charisma meeting and charming the strongest leaders of the world that at that time. Unfortunately, the pressure of politics took a toll on her mental state, the corrosiveness of power got into her, and Ferdinand Marcos's affairs was just the final nail on the coffin of her sanity and overall well-being.Obviously, the insanity and the narrative that she convinced herself was passed down to her children and influenced their whole family for the worse. They are so corrupt and out of touch in humanity that they are beyond salvation by any means, and should not be put in power ever again.""Ever since the new administration has come in, the Marcoses have been able to regain political clout. They have scrubbed clean the sins of the past, and they're trying to protect themselves as the leaders for the future.""— Andy Baustista(Former Chairman of Elections and PCGG)I liked that this documentary doesn't focus only on the past but also dwells on the danger of electing another Marcos in Malacañang (Presidential Palace of the Philippines). I'm just in awe at the nerve of these people trying regain political power after all the atrocity they brought to the Philippines that we are still suffering with until now.Imelda used Ferdinand Marcos as her puppet to get away from all the crimes she committed, and she is trying to attempt the same thing with her son Bong Bong Marcos by pressuring him to run for the position. Bong Bong just made it easy for her because he is desperate to get his mother's and his family's approval besides reviving their political clout and gaining power himself.Duterte revealed himself that his campaign was funded and supported by the Marcoses and his father was a cabinet member of President Marcos during his first term of candidacy. This just gives us a reason to believe that even tho Bong Bong Marcos did not win the elections, the Marcos family still has their foot on the door. One big evidence of this is that Imelda is still on the loose even though she was already found guilty of graft and corruption 2 years ago which is only one of many more examples.I really enjoyed the editing on this documentary, it really showed the true colors of the Marcoses with the supposedly ""behind the scene"" shots. A lot of infuriating moments too like when Imelda hid her painting from the PCGG and the corrupt priest calling her ""the mother of all, our only first lady."" I just wanna make puke in disgust. Kudos to the filmmakers showing those scenes at the right moments which puts the context of Imelda's wickedness on a whole different level.With all said and done, all we can do now is educate the masses, improve our educational system, put the real history in our watered down textbooks/history books, remind the people of the monstrosity that this family brought to the Philippines with anecdotes in hopes that history won't repeat itself. Which is unfortunately slowly happening right now with the Duterte Administration.""What matters now is for them to be informed.""— Etta Rosales (Activist and Former Congresswoman)",2020-06-21,0

The Kingmaker,"""De documentaire ‘The Kingmaker, Imelda Marcos’ van Lauren Greenfield (‘The Queen of Versailles’) draait om de voormalig First Lady van de Filippijnen, Imelda Marcos. Fascinerend en verbijsterend. Over de politieke invloed van een mater familias, Imelda. De ‘Moeder van de Natie’. Een invloed die tot op de dag van vandaag aangewend wordt, ondanks de vele misstappen (corruptie, acht jaar staat van beleg, onmetelijke rijkdom over de ruggen van de eigen arme inwoners, martelingen) in het verleden. Het doel heiligde de middelen bij deze dame. Ze getuigt van weinig realiteitsbesef en verlangt nog steeds terug naar de met overdaad omgeven sprookjeswereld die zij beleefde aan de zijde van haar man, de langstzittende president Ferdinand Marcos, in de periode 1965-1986.

The Kingmaker,"Weathering the storm that is Imelda Marcos is difficult, deadly even. However, Lauren Greenfield's haunting documentary The Kingmaker proves that one can dance with the devil. The film examines the lives of the Marcos clan from their rise to the Philippine government, their downfall, and their eventual return to their current political endeavors. To those unfamiliar with their name, the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos (1965 to 1986) caused some of the worst human rights violations seen in Philippine history, not to mention how the oppressive regime plunged the country's economy. While the film's title is appropriate because of its masterful storytelling, the documentary's main subjects are not worthy of this royal embellishment. Greenfield wastes no time in depicting the dichotomy between Imelda and the everyday Filipino citizen. Its first scene illustrates how emotionless she is when she hands out 50s to the beggars, proceeding to call their area ""depressing"" after reflecting on her loss of power. This opening scene already sets Imelda as someone immaculate, a savior or—in her words—a ""mother"" to those who are in need of her love. But as the film proceeds, we see how the Marcoses were never the loving parents every child wanted; their names continue haunt the people who were tortured and killed during Martial Law. The Kingmaker beautifully interpolates many sides of those who lived during and beyond the Marcos dictatorship. It is this multisectoral approach that helps audiences understand how grave the consequences of Martial Law really are. From Imelda's friends to opposition figures and Martial Law victims and activists, no stone is left unturned in dissecting how Imelda's brain works. What took the cake for me was how these figures were visited a few years after. For example, Vice President Leni Robredo and activist May Rodriguez' thoughts regarding Bongbong Marcos' vice presidential run were cut into two—the time leading up to the 2016 elections and the aftermath of Robredo's win. This follow up emphasizes how the Marcoses' dirt will never be erased from history, despite their numerous attempts to do so. It feels like the country hasn't moved much in terms of progression. What's more haunting is that all the imagery of Marcos running feels familiar, scarily real even. Now that Marcos is vouching for President, it is deeply concerning how far their influence can go. This is what exactly The Kingmaker aims to address: to expose the shoes and skeletons of the Marcos family's closets and to remind Filipinos of their oppressive rule. It demonstrates how far one will go to sustain their wealth, power, and image. Time will tell when the Marcos magic will finally disappear from the country. But for now, let this film be a reminder to never forget the many lives that suffered under their brutal rule.",2022-05-05,0
