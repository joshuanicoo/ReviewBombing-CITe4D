Hello Love Goodbye,"An Inspiring Movie: Hello Love Goodbye, despite being a largely feel-good film, did not shy away from the harsh realities that its OFW audience experiences. Despite being upfront with the struggles of an OFW, it still serves as a gentle, hopeful reminder for our modern day heroes to not forget to choose themselves. To not forget that they can allow themselves to dream, to love, and most of all, to be human. It show that love can wait but our dreams it knock once like opportunity grab it once it came in your or our life.

Kathryn Bernardo portrays Joy's exhaustion, anger and resolution so potently without much words. It all comes out in the way her lids look heavy from a two-hour sleep; how her shoulders slump as she grapples with the thought of her agonizingly routine life. We see it in her quiet moments in the night when she can catch a few minutes just to stare blankly at the wall. The depiction felt authentic and tugs at your heartstrings, Joy is the symbol of women with dream. And also her leading man this is a more mature role for Alden as well, and the material lets him show a deeper side to his acting chops. His character's personal story carried as much weight as the romance, and in Ethan's vulnerable moments, we see Alden as a dramatic actor, and not just a tutti-frutti leading man. That's not to say that he didn't play the charismatic boyfriend role well, though. The kilig factor we as always cranked up to high, thanks also to his and Kathryn's organic chemistry.

The most unforgettable scene in this movie when Ethan and Joy decided to leave each other to continue their dream and when Ethan said ""will you give the rest of your time with me in Hong Kong? "". Those line make me sad and overwhelmed because even they know that they leave each other they choose to understand and make those little time to make memorable, they choose to spent those time to be happy. This movie make us inspired that life is like a photography, we developed from negative.",2019-10-24,positive,0.9490447282791138,9
Hello Love Goodbye,"Love is About Letting Go...Not Sacrifice: I've seen a few of Kathryn Bernardo's films, and I believe she turned in the performance of her life. She stepped away from the typical romantic-comedies (many of which are actually quite good), and challenged herself to take on the role of a much deeper and much more complex character in Joy.

I have always marveled--and not in a good way--of how people tend to use others; even people they love; even members of their own families. Of course, children are usually guilted into it. In short, it's a parent's way of saying, ""I suffered, and so now you must suffer too. Why? Because it's how families work.""

As stated in other reviews, I am an ESL teacher. I've lived and worked in South Korea, China, and Taiwan. I know quite a bit about how Asian parents tend to treat their kids. Of course, it's not all bad. You'll scarcely find parents who are more dedicated to teaching their children about discipline and hard-work. The large contrast between them and western parents, is that western parents tend to allow their kids to do whatever they want. They're spoiled beyond belief. What is needed is a balance.

As the eldest daughter, Joy is in Hong Kong working several jobs in order to keep herself alive as well as sending money back home to her family in the Phillippines. She has a nursing degree. Her dream is to go to Canada to pursue what she loves. Of course, she meets and falls in love with Ethan, a young man who is also from the Phillippines, who is trying to support his family as well, after a disastrous relationship that nearly cost him everything.

Ethan, of course, is hoping that Joy will decide to stay in Hong Kong, and not go to Canada. This is when the film really grabs the viewer to see what Joy will decide to do.

Love is not about sacrifice for someone else. Sacrifice is about losing something, and love is never about loss. It's always about who you are. In all her wisdom, Joy has to explain this to Ethan as well as outlining the consequences of not pursuing her dream. Fortunately, Ethan finally gets it and is able to do what only love can do: let go. As soon as you try to hold onto it, love ceases to be love.

Filmed in Hong Kong, we're giving a stark and not-so-pleasing depiction of life for many immigrants struggling to survive. Some can do it. Some can't. In the end, you can only truly look after yourself and not lose sight of your own dreams. Of course, the world, and even your own family will throw every reason at you to NOT pursue your dreams. If you give in, you have no one to blame but yourself. If you forge ahead, then you have gained more profound wisdom about life than what most people can only dream about.

My only complaint of the film was that the chemistry between Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards was not what it should have been. And because of this, the film loses a bit of its heart and depth. I'd say it was pretty obvious that Kathryn Bernardo did not want to do any kissing scenes with Alden due to her love and respect for her boyfriend, Daniel Padilla. The only kiss we see is one on her forehead in the dark. Can you imagine the lack of depth in a film like Titanic if Jack and Rose only held hands and never shared a kiss? I couldn't help but wonder how much more powerful the film would have been if another actress had performed in the role, or if Padilla himself hadn't turned the role down (which I read that he had).

Still, this is a memorable film that challenges everyone to go after their dreams and let nothing and no one stand in your way.",2021-04-13,positive,0.8473518444941595,-1
Hello Love Goodbye,"What a nice surprise of a movie...: Right, well I didn't really know what I was getting into here when I sat down to watch the 2019 Tagalog movie that was filmed in Hong Kong. Initially I thought it was a Chinese movie, but upon seeing the names of the cast, I looked on IMDb and saw that it was a Tagalog (Philippines) movie and not a Cantonese (Hong Kong) movie. And given my fascination with Asian movie, of course I sat down to watch ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"".

And I must definitely say that writers Carmi Raymundo, Cathy Garcia-Molina and Ronalisa A. Co came up with a rather enthralling storyline; one that definitely provided as much of entertainment and enjoyment, as it was a movie that was very watchable and likeable.

The storyline is one that easily sways away the audience, because it is wholehearted and nicely told storyline. And milling about in the storyline are some nicely detailed and interesting characters. So a big thumbs up to the writers on this accomplishment.

I will say that the acting in the movie was good. Now, I am not overly familiar with Tagalog cinema, but my wife told me that there were some rather famous Tagalog actresses and actors in the movie. Nevertheless, I think the acting performances were spot on.

At the same time, with providing a good story and good entertainment, ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" really brought me back to my four years of living and working in Hong Kong. This movie stoked so many memories and definitely spurred a desire to return to Hong Kong to revisit that fabulous place.

If you like romantic movies, then I strongly believe that the 2019 movie ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" from director Cathy Garcia-Molina is a movie that you will thoroughly enjoy. I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie, and it is a movie that I can warmly recommend you sit down to watch.

My rating of ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",2021-01-21,positive,0.9584756419062614,2
Hello Love Goodbye,"Hello, Love, no Goodbyes.: Being the highest-grossing Philippine movie thus far, I hope you don't mind if I came into watching this with high expectations. Still I was skeptic because the assumption was it will be another one of those formulaic Star Cinema movie starring Kathryn Bernardo, directed by Cathy Molina-Garcia, set in an international location, usual love story but with a twist: we get a new boy this time in the form of Alden Richards. For the most part I was right, it was all you could ever expect from the same group that gave us the highest-grossing movie the year before, 'How's of Us.' Amidst it's shortcomings, 'Hello, Love, Goodbye' is a pleasant surprise for a movie who's theme has been done a million times. Part of it's success can be attributed to showing us the reality of our hardworking domestic helpers in Hong Kong (which the OFW community all over the world related and responded to) and it did not give us the usual ending we are used to, which makes a sequel possible seeing as all three already expressed interest in doing.

The story was well-written for the most part and my favorite was the start of the movie. It was a different approach, fast-paced and intriguing. While at some point it had to slow down to become what it really was meant to be in the first place, a typical Pinoy love story, at least it introduced something new to the audience that can be the new norm in the future. Acting-wise, Kathryn and Alden both delivered but both lacked maturity which I'm hoping can be improved on once the sequel rolls around. There were exchanges that fell flat because either a) it was poorly-written or b) both did not have the capacity to deliver them with the emotions needed. It took a while for their chemistry to kick in, possibly a result of being pigeonholed in their respective love teams for a long time. Kathryn can act, but she has certain mannerisms when she deliver some of her lines that breaks my concentration from her acting. I'm still getting rich girl even though she's supposed to be covered in filth from hiding under a pile of garbage bags. Alden still comes from the John Lloyd Cruz school for acting, but as soon as he develops his own signature he should be destined for greater things. The supporting cast did what was required of them, with Maxine Medina and Jameson Blake as highlights.

There's always the burden of asking whether this is the movie that will propel Philippine cinema back to it's old glory. Obviously this is not it, but delightfully it's not a step back as well. Knowing this specific tandem and formula works, hopefully everyone involved will be more keen on wanting to elevate the viewing experience the second time around. I keep harping on this because I honestly believe it has the potential to become even more special than what they've already done here.",2020-03-22,positive,0.932413915793101,-1
Hello Love Goodbye,"Truly amazing: This is so far, the best Filipino movie of 2019. I really love the story, which shows a lot about the lives of Filipino workers in Hong Kong. It is not like any other of those Filipino rom-com, and drama movies you've seen before. This will make you laugh out loud a lot and cry hard.

For me this is Cathy Garcia-Molina's best movie. Kathryn and Alden really shines in this, great acting by the whole cast. It also has great shots, cinematography and soundtrack so it is a must watch!",2019-07-31,positive,0.9532739434923444,2
Hello Love Goodbye,"Mature and bold love story: The two stars from the two different stations hit it off with good chemistry in this mature love story. Although the story is as typical as any Filipino love/romance movie could be, I like the fact that the writer and director went for the bold path of ending the movie with ""goodbye"", instead of coming up with an epilogue that let the two lovers meet again in some future. The two lead stars are engaging enough for you to care what happens to them in the end but there are some parts where it could drag. Still, I can understand the clamor when this movie came out in 2019.",2020-10-30,positive,0.93583083152771,-1
Hello Love Goodbye,THE BEST FILIPINO MOVIE EVER: This is the best pinoy movie ever. The characters are superb. Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards performance was the best. There is no boring moments in the movie. It's a must watch for everyone. Kathryn Bernardo played the role of Joy a Filipino worker in Hong Kong who is struggling and doing odd jobs to take care of her family. On the other hand Alden Richards played the role of Ethan a funny and unserious bartender who later crossed path with Joy and the story of their undying love begins. The story is not just another pinoy love story. It's a story that shows the struggle of all OFW . I was touched and move by the acting of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards. They made it possible for me to relate with the movie. I'm not a Filipino but I was able to get every piece of the movie because of their wonderful onscreen chemistry. Kudos to the cast and crew. Good job Director Molina. I wouldn't mind to travel again for the part 2 of this movie. It's worth my time and my money. More movies for this duos please. I would always travel with my family to watch their movie onscreen. More movies for Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards please. They've won my heart.,2019-10-23,positive,0.9808003455400467,2
Hello Love Goodbye,"WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!: I was excited to watch the film due to the hype and some of my friends posting about it on social media however, I was very disappointed after watching the film as the acting from the lead actors including supporting cast appeared quite scripted and very awkward. Kathryn & Alden seemed too rehearsed and some of their co-actors were really annoying. The story was predictable and recycled from previous films. Only thing I appreciate was the cinematography and soundtrack. Save your money and just watch this on netflix or cinema one when it airs.",2019-08-10,positive,0.8295061588287354,-1

Hello Love Goodbye," Time Must Start Again  °7.7° °VG ° %: Timing in life is everything; so the adage goes. In Hong Kong, time is GLD. As long as you move you'll live. Once you stop you'll starve. Over 200,000 Filipinos work in Hong Kong. It's most common to have a 2-yr domestic helper contract as Filipinos are not allowed to do anything else - unless they manage to become a citizen. Therefore, when Joy loses her job because her employers can no longer pay her, she takes an illegal waitressing job. The cops, inevitably, will come by to check IDs. When Joy sees them, she busts a move and runs. She ends up running right into the handsome bartender and busts another move. She uses him as camouflage to hide from the po-po. Cops rarely bother a couple snogging in the alleyway, afterall. It's done so often in movies you might think that they would start checking, even if a duo is rounding first and headed for second, but it always seems to work.

The Filipino community in Hong Kong is small. Everyone is within 1° of separation, but it's large enough to support a Filipino radio station. (They have a nifty microeconomic system in place as well.) Joy thinks she got away scott-free only to wake up the next morning to a radio announcement about her! Ethan, the bartender, is looking for Joy so that she can return the kiss that she stole from him! Joy's friends go insane.

HLG is about what decent, but poor, people must do to survive: It is all about hard choices. It is also about the nature of love. Joy & Ethan. Ethan + Joy. She resists him, but she can't for long. The problem is that she's leaving. She's definitely leaving. She has a nursing degree that she can't use in Hong Kong. She's going to be a nurse in Canada. That's her dream, and nthing's going to change her mind. Nt a thing/budkis/pistza/larkaflark/nuffink/jack squat/NATTY. Joy is no wimp. She has a will of iron. She warns Ethan to not get attached. Yet they allow themselves to fall in love. Every day they push the knife in a little deeper.

Their story is sweet and these protags are likable. He says he can handle it and he won't get in her way, but as that  approaches the pressure ratchets up. Because, 'when you love, it's all or nothing. If you hold back, then why love it all?' Ethan has a point. 'There are questions inside of me that only I can answer,' Joy insists. Joy has goals, a mission, and an ironclad agenda. She will not be swayed. Not now.

LVE. What does it look like? To Ethan it's: ""If you loved me enough you would stay.""  To Joy it's: ""If you loved me enough you would want me to go."" Later, Joy asks the universe: ""When a woman gives too much of herself, she's stupid, but when she prioritizes herself, she's bad. Where do we need to place ourselves? Is love only expressed through sacrifice?"" Why so often, indeed, does every option, for women especially, seem irreconcilable? Love can teeter from selfish to selfless. Perhaps love always starts down in the selfish zone, but the more we sincerely love someone, the more selfless we should become. Leaving the shallow end and diving down deeper should elevate our love higher. If not, we must question how much in  we are or how selfish we actually are. A young person should never be expected to throw away h/h future for a relationship, particularly a relatively new one. Talk about creating a debt for regret - No sane person would endorse that. Joy agonizes over this unexpected timeout from the race she's been running. Either option is valid. Her choice is hers alone. HLG tells young girls that their personal development and future is every bit as important as love.

Befitting a modest budget, most of the filming is on the street or in contained spaces. There's a couple of wow shots. They take a day off to go up into the mountains. On a cliff looking down on the city, the buildings are uniformly white. While they look like bad dental work there's also an ethereal beauty to the vista. The effect is otherworldly.

HLG is a 118 minute, 2019 release that is rated 8.2 on MDL. Overall, this is a well put together production. The writing, directing and acting all blend to make a great product with few flaws. This is a Filipino production and I am looking forward to seeing more of their works. I've seen 2 Hong Kong productions, The Defected-8.2 and Hong Kong West Side Stories(7.5). Both of them are good but also dark, edgy, sad, and a display of the worst elements of humanity. The group that is the most downtrodden in Hong Kong seems to have a brighter outlook. Between the 3 productions, one wouldn't think it's the same place. HLG is well worth the time to get a peek at life in Hong Kong from the view of the hard working, overlooked Filipino community. We have alot to be thankful for.

Hello Love Goodbye,"not good not bad: Another Kathryn same ol' tone of character film! I wish that her writers and directors would gave her something different worthy of famas or urian award, she deserves it, it was just the material that always failed her.

Hello Love Goodbye,"Alden Richards' character, Ethan, is pushy, creepy and problematic.: Ethan will continue sending friend requests even if Joy declined several times already. He will make the radio station talk about Joy in public without her permission. He will use another phone to text Joy anonymously. He will act like a police even if Joy is weeping out of fear. He will squeeze through inside a small room knowing that Joy will be uncomfortable. He will continually send ""Need a friend today?"" text messages even if Joy has rejected it so many times. I don't know how a Filipino girl reacts to such moves, but if people consider this as ""nakakakilig,"" there's a problem.

'Hello, Love, Goodbye' is at its best when it tells the story of Kathryn Bernardo's character, Joy. In some ways, the film manages to outdo similar mainstream Filipino romance films because of Kathryn Bernardo's stunning performance and the earnest depiction of OFWs. Bernardo, whose acting holds the film together when it was falling apart, effectively evokes a palpable sense of weariness, discontent, and eagerness to alleviate Joy's situation. Actually, I can do without the 'La La Land' love story if the social commentary was strengthened and expounded more. In a similar vein with 'Sunday Beauty Queen,' the film resonates with Filipinos because of its sensible portrayal of what it is like to work abroad in a job you are overqualified in.

But Cathy Garcia-Molina's picture falls apart as the annoying, melodramatic score continues to play in the background, tackier drone shots are added, and more forced, ""hugot"" dialogues are delivered by the leads. Sure, this is how cliché-ridden mainstream Filipino romance plays out. But how I wish we get movies that transcend this generic romantic stratagem. 'Hello, Love, Goodbye' fails to offer something new to romance movies as an art form, which is disappointing since the OFW story and Joy's arc have so much potential.",2019-08-18,positive,0.8094402381352016,6

Hello Love Goodbye,"The Story Has Potential - The Film Failed to Deliver: As far as the film's story goes, it has so much potential. It depicts a few of the many instances of what OFWs experience while working abroad. But the way Cathy Garcia-Molina presented the story was too mediocre.

Their choice to cast Alden and Kathryn was bad. There isn't any chemistry between them. The chemistry happened between the viewers and Alden/Kathryn, but not between the characters themselves.

Alden's character was unrefined. His acting was subpar. His smile is problematic. Instead of conveying something that relates to being hurt or having a struggle, it becomes out of place and sometimes creepy.

The camera shots were out of place. It felt like the production team were trying to show off their drone shots even when it would have been better to just use a simple wide shot. Close-ups were not utilized properly.

The script contained the typical ""hugot"" lines. At the same time, the film contained at least 30 minutes of pure exposition. It became a film of telling rather than showing.

I haven't talked about the problems with the other casts. But overall, the film was purely a waste of time. I would have felt better if I just watched the film ""Anak"" with the other OFWs in one of the film's scenes.",2019-08-24,negative,0.7953845105673137,10

Hello Love Goodbye,"HONEST Review. Why 5?: Lets start with how great Kathryn's acting is. As expected from her The Hows of Us piece. Alden did OK. Wasn't expecting much but it was a solid performance. However his acting reminds me of John Lloyd. And if you act like someone else's then you should give justice to it or do better. But in this movie it's neither. Then again a solid one. Now, the lines. They are trying to squeeze the ""hugots"" absolutely anywhere they want in the film. And it's absolutely out of timing! The lines are so bad that I can say I can write that. Yeah its that bad. The songs doesnt go well with the scenes which completely ruined the greatness of the song. They could have done it better. Cinematography is so bad, its like you're watching a TV series. Go watch it again, you'll see the same style of focus and switch to subject over and over again. There are many scenes that could've shot with them both in the frame to show their emotions at the same time. It was like Action! And Cut! Next line! The style of shots just changed in about 10-15mins remaining in the film. It looked like they realized it and hired someone else. And my 11 yr old daughter even agreed how bad the shots are. Compare this with Tadhana, 100 na Tula, Kita Kita, The Day After Valentines, Never Not Love You, and #WalangForever. If you havent seen these, go watch them and thank me later. 5 is because of Kathryn.",2019-08-18,positive,0.8659644929262308,10
Hello Love Goodbye,"Wow!!! Just wow!!!: In what may be Cathy Garcia Molina's best movie to date, this movie overcomes the banal and stereotypical nuances pinoy romcoms are known for. In fact the apparent filipino diaspora is the true backdrop of this movie. The dissolution of every OFW workers success or possible demise. The ensuing love story merely serves as extravagance but will eventually turn complimentary to the already palatable storyline of Kathryn Bernardo's plight as a struggling domestic helper torn between the choice of staying in Hongkong to be with the man she loves (Alden Richards) and fulfilling her destiny to be a succesful nurse in Canada. Both characters are vibrant and played to a T by the two lead actors. Not really a fan of Alden Richards, one may surmise that he was directed exceptionally well for this or was incidentally a victim of writing mediocrity in previous films. But that stockroom scene is just plain fun and genius. The chemistry between the two characters made apparent by screams of excitement from my neighboring seat as the pair locked eyes for the first time. Forget about the common adequacy pinoy films are usually associated with. We may suck in action and sci-fi movies but we can definitely make quality films in other genres. Like this one. Baduy na kung baduy, but this is a movie you should watch. Again, this is not a paid ad. Lol!",2019-09-13,positive,0.8164871885226324,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"It's not hollywood, but for a pinoy style movie , this is ver good!: After watching the movie, i just have love everything about it : the feeling of missing the characters after the movie ended . Here's my thought: 1. Goodvibes, inside the cinema, it is so nice to hear people having mixed emotions throughout the entire movie, nakakakilig, nakakatawa, nakakaiyak . It's not heavy , just simple. 2. Kathryn's voice is just perfect for her role. She has a straight face but she managed to give expressions that justifies every line she says, thru her eyes. You will love her more in this movie. 3. Alden has an expressive face, can portray a sad eyes and happy smile at the same time. With that expressive face, I was amazed that he made me smile and laugh with those supposedly cheesy lines of the script. I did not expect that he is this good. He actually can shift from happy to sad to serious without you noticing the transition. Plus he is so manly and handsome. Many women inside the cinema were so 'kilig' everytime his face shows up especially upclose. 3. The supporting cast will give you a break to the story of joy and ethan, they are very funny! I meant, just their presence adds excitement. They are the ones who completed the movie. 4. Good choice of names of the lead actors. Joy is a name that is nice to hear from Alden's voice. Ethan could be alden's alternative name in real life, it suits him well . And Mary dale is maymay's real name, very filipino and youthful name for her character. 5. Great chemistry, Ethan's arms looks so comfy everytime he hugs Joy. When they look at each other in the eyes, it's genuine. Alden's bubbly voice and Joy's serious voice are blending nicely that is why just them sitting and talking brings ""kilig"". 5. You can see hongkong itself, even in just a glimpse you can see the unity of filipinos. Being an ofw is hard but having to see a community of filipino around you brings comfort and home. 6. Some parts are like music videos, maybe because the music is so good to hear in those hongkong buildings in the background. 7. Direk cathy is really exeptional. She will bring out the best in all actors. She choses the best on everything. 7. The movie itself tells different stories in just 2 hours. All stories are true to life, but hopeful . All stories are aspiring to have a better life and chasing happiness. In order to chase happiness, you should make sacrifices, but making sacrifices is not sad at all . It is a challenge and part if the process. The whole movie is not korean or hollywood, but filipino. Like any other movies, it is not perfect. There is always room for improvement. But that improvement, we should make movies more like filipino style. It is very simple actually but filipinos are loving it because it is very light, its for family bonding. You wont feel awkward watching it with your grandparents. I gave it 10 over 10 because i cant get over it.",2019-08-22,positive,0.9221426190399542,-1

Mataas ang pangarap niya pero willing siya mag settle sa kung anong pwede niyang magawa.

Hello Love Goodbye,"Ang pelikulang Hello, Love, Goodbye ay isang nakakaantig na kwento tungkol sa pag-ibig at mga sakripisyong ginawa para sa mga pangarap. Ang paggamit ng Filipino sa mga emosyonal na eksena ay kapansin-pansin sa pelikulang ito, na nagbigay ng mas malalim na koneksyon sa mga manonood. Ang mga linya ay natural at totoo, kaya ang mga emosyon ng mga karakter ay higit na nadarama. Gayunpaman, may ilang bahagi kung saan ang mga diyalogo ay may halong Ingles, na bagama't nagbibigay ng makabagong tono, ay nakakabawas sa lalim ng mensahe sa wikang Filipino. Sa aking palagay, maganda pa rin ang paggamit ng Filipino sa pelikulang ito dahil ito ay nagpapakita ng ating wika na nagpapahayag ng tunay na damdamin at karanasan. Para lalo pang pagbutihin, makabubuting bigyang pansin ang paggamit ng mas malalim at mas masining na mga salita sa Filipino upang mas maipakita ang yaman at kagandahan ng ating sariling wika.",2025-11-06,negative,0.8856074313322703,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"i really love how they’ve shown the lives of the ofws — their sacrifices, silent battles, and the longing that comes with being miles away from home. one of the main reasons why i chose this as the film subject for my discourse analysis in grade 11.but above all, they’ve shown us a story about choosing yourself — and all that you have to go through to do that. and joy was such a great protagonist for this because how can you love someone so much, and still have to let them go to choose yourself? some might take it as a selfish decision, when in reality, it is not. all her life, she had to put others first before herself, giving up and sacrificing things for people. but when the time came that she finally decided to choose herself, she wasn’t being selfish — she was finally being free. i admire her so much for having the courage to leave, to allow herself to grow and dream.and ethan? sometimes, love alone can never be enough. it’s a hard pill to swallow, but it’s the truth — the reality that not all the love in the world can save us. joy was never lacking in reminding him that she’s going to leave. she never made false promises, never painted a forever she couldn’t give. from the beginning, she was clear that she’s not open to commitments, clear that she’s leaving. it was he who pushed himself into her life, even when she kept on pushing him away. i know that ethan just hoped — it’s not a bad thing — but sometimes, hope blinds us from the truth we already know, making her choose between the dream she’s been working hard for and the love she never expected to find.so yup, joy, tama ka sa sinabi mong, “kung mahal mo ’ko, bakit pinapapili mo ako?” dahil ang pag-ibig ay dapat na mapagpalaya, hindi isang pakikibaka. at kailan man ay hindi magiging masama ang piliin ang sarili.at sana, makahanap tayong lahat ng taong hindi tayo papipiliin tulad ni ethan :)",2025-10-29,positive,0.8614844773945055,0

Hello Love Goodbye,"Not the most life altering piece of cinema but definitely the most modern Filipino movie that I'm proud of so far.RIP to kathniel but also not because Kathryn Bernardo (and these other actors) deserve to have their spotlight and be taken srsly as actors instead of being forced into a loveteam from an early age. Still loved their movies together but this was definitely a huge risk in the Filipino entertainment industry and I’m glad they delivered. Obviously still has its fair share of red flag romanticism for the leading man but as ALWAYSSSSSS the Filipina baddie carries. But just knowing how the usual Filipino rom coms go, this was already breaking tradition, while still managing to deliver the kilig factors. I LOVE that the ending is up to interpretation, and Kathryn still pursues her career as a nurse. VERY bold choices against the usual Filipino movie plot lines. It’s a good love story, the chemistry is there, and also love how it mixes in the harsh realities of working abroad and the hard-working Filipino spirit. THEY WERE IN HONG KONG THOUGH,, so the shots could have been way prettier cinematically. But props to the director and the casting, Kathryn Bernardo always has my heart and I can’t wait to see her in more movies. Alden is alright too  ** I’m just pretending the sequel doesn’t exist. **",2025-09-08,positive,0.9527495622634887,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"This movie is literally for every eldest daughter who's ""ate ng bayan sa umaga, breadwinner sa gabi, tapos sa love life...?"" Waley.  Hong Kong never looked this emotionally exhausting. OFW stories are usually soaked in sacrifice, pero this one hits you with that emotional labor type of heartbreak—the kind that doesn't end with ""kami pa rin sa huli,"" but more like, ""minahal kita... at 'yun na 'yun.""Alden Richards? Shocking. As in, shookt ako. He brought soft boy energy with a sprinkle of “gusto kita, pero hindi kita pipilitin.” Kathryn? Ma’am. Ma’am??? She ATE. That breakdown scene? The way she cried like her lungs were collapsing from every missed dream? Oscar-worthy sa puso ng bawat umuwing pagod na ate.Real talk:This isn’t about “will they end up together?” It’s about choosing yourself, even when it hurts like hell.Sometimes love says goodbye.Sometimes goodbye is love.And sometimes… you cry in the tricycle ride home while pretending your eyes are just “napuwing lang.” Para sa mga nagmahal, nasaktan, pero hindi iniwan ang sarili. At para sa mga nagtatrabaho para sa pamilya, kahit pagod na pagod na.You’re the real main character.",2022-01-07,negative,0.7030983832147386,2

Hello Love Goodbye,Realistic. Slow-burning. Melancholic.Maganda yung pagkakaexecute nung story. OFW story siya pero hindi yung typical story. Ang galing ni Kathyrn dito. Buti na lang hindi siya nastuck sa love team niya with Daniel. Mas lumabas yung galing niya sa pagacting and sa pagportray niya sa character. Super natural lang nung acting niya. Ang galing din ni Alden. Pumantay talaga siya sa acting ni Kathryn. Slow paced siya pero hindi yung nakakaboring kasi nabuibuild up yung emotion hanggang climax.Super daming iconic lines. Iba talaga si Direk Cathy. Maganda kasi nahighlight yung hardship ng isang OFW. Pinakita rin kung gaano kalakas and katapang ang isang babae. Nagustuhan ko siya kasi hindi siya yung typical romance movie na happily ever after. Super realistic lang nung ending especially for a person na mas uunahin ang pamilya kaysa sa sariling kaligayahan. Minsan yung tunay na love ay yung handang magparaya. Masakit pero kailangan.,2024-10-27,positive,0.8096958067682054,4

Hello Love Goodbye,"Peak Filipino Hugot-core bittersweet film, or maybe it's because I am so spoiled with Wong Kar-Wai films (or La La Land, or any other romantic movies really) that I am left so underwhelmed in the romance part of the film. The parts that show the struggles of being an overseas Filipino worker are the best parts of the film simply because it hits hard when you know people that have parents being OFWs around the world where you can feel Joy's frustration of balancing between achieving her dreams and providing for her family. Ethan is a mixed bag for me where there are parts that are so endearing you can't help but smile at his line delivery and his love for Joy, and at the same time, I wish that Joy would ignore him or just call the police on him for calling her everyday. The ending felt really realistic as it closes and opens different questions of their relationship. People are mixed on the sequel for some reason, so all the more reason for me to check it out soon!",2025-06-22,positive,0.8904653429985047,2

Kathryn nailed her role—her character felt real and easy to sympathize with. Alden, on the other hand, was weird and unlikeable. Ethan wanted Joy to stay because, for the first time since his breakup with Tanya, he felt like he had purpose again—something he found in helping Joy—and he didn’t want to let that go.",2025-06-20,positive,0.8826448321342468,10

Hello Love Goodbye,"Joy, a hardworking domestic helper, and Ethan, a charming bartender, fall in love while working overseas in Hong Kong. It's a fairly grounded love story that reminds us that sometimes love means letting go. Kathryn Bernardo, as Joy, carried the film for me as she is forced to choose between love and following her dreams, capturing the quiet resilience of countless Filipinos abroad. We also get to see the emotional toll, economic pressures, and social sacrifices OFWs face living in constant hustle while enduring discrimination, homesickness, and uncertain legal standing. A reminder that behind many OFWs are stories of struggle, strength, and dreams deferred.",2025-06-14,positive,0.9161450386047363,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"1. As my movie critic peg Json Javier said in his post "" Who would have thought that the most unlikely pairing will make way for the best Filipino movie of 2019 as of yet? "" Hindi lang ako nag aagree 100%. 100 gazillion times more.2. I intentionally didn't watch this as early as I should have because of Cinemalaya pero the few days I missed made me appreciate the wait. 5 out of 5 stars.3. Malamang marami naka relate na working professionals when Kathryn Bernardo's character Joy said that choices are just for the rich. Umoo ako e. Pati yung mag jowa sa tabi ko. Pati yung yuppies sa likod ko. Totoo naman diba? Kahit anong profession mo makakarelate ka talaga. Kahit mahirap, babangon ka at magtratrabaho. Pero may choice ka din naman na magbago o mag stay. Kung ano ba ang priority mo.4. Kudos sa scriptwriter for involving that famous scene of Anak. Kasi kailangan siya. Kasi epitome yun ng Hongkong stories of our OFWs.5. Think of all the superlative words you can to describe outstanding. Yun lahat ang masasabi sa acting chops nila Kathryn Bernardo at Alden Richards dito. Yung alam mong hindi naman sila aa totoong buhay pero akala mo they are an item in real life.6. Sasamahan ko na lagi ng ice tea kapag kakain ako ng noodles. Saka oo. Pasasaan ba't makakahanap din ako ng taong kasabay kong kumain ng mabilis dahil busy ako at marami pa kaming gagawin.7. This film will make you respect our OFWs more. Kung ano ang sinasakripisyo nila. Kung ano ang kaya nilang ibigay. Kung bakit kailangan nila yung gawin. Iba ibang istorya. Pero sumesentro lang lahat sa pag ibig.8. Iba din talaga tayong mga Pilipino pagdating sa pamilya. Yung ikakain mo na lang ibibigay mo pa sa kanila. Kasi iba ang saya kapag nakita mo silang masaya.9. Two people make a relationship work. Hindi lang isang tao. Kasi nakakapagod yun. Dalawa dapat.10. Hindi ako kuntento sa one film lang for KathDen. This pair deserves one more movie. Or maybe two.

Hello Love Goodbye,"A heartfelt exploration of love, sacrifice, and personal growth set against the backdrop of Hong Kong’s bustling cityscape. The chemistry between Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards is undeniable, their performances grounding the emotional core of the film. The story of Joy, an OFW navigating her dreams and a complicated relationship, is both compelling and heartbreaking. It’s a reflection of the sacrifices many Filipinos make for a better future.However, while the romance is touching, the pacing feels a bit uneven at times, and some plot points seem predictable. The portrayal of the struggles of an OFW could have been explored deeper, as some aspects feel overly simplified for a broader audience.Nonetheless, the film leaves you with a powerful message: ""That sometimes, you have to let go of love in order to truly find yourself and your own happiness."" It’s a bittersweet journey of realizing that love is not always about holding on, but knowing when to let go and move forward. A solid effort with a lot of emotional resonance, even if it occasionally falls into predictable tropes.",2025-02-17,positive,0.9701564411322275,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"Joy, a live-in migrant-cum-domestic helper in Hong Kong, prepares to leave for Canada to pursue her dreams when she unexpectedly meets Ethan, and the two fall in love. However, their relationship comes at the risk of their personal goals and aspirations.While it's probably my third watch, this time with an objective, So here are thoughts: I felt some scenes were mixed with the usual pushy theatrics, overly focused shots, and an excessive number of romantic background songs unnecessarily shoved into the film, occasionally straying from authenticity and realism. Overall, the film manages to maintain authenticity for more than three-fourths of its runtime.Hello, Love, Goodbye offers something for everyone—heartbreaking romance, politically tinged drama, and uniquely scenic locations in Hong Kong, encapsulating both the classic three-night, four-day tourist spots and the lesser-known areas. It effectively captures the realism of Hong Kong’s live-in migrant workers, highlighting their struggles with abuse, poor working conditions, the fight for PR, Sunday gatherings of domestic workers, and the depiction of a city that never sleeps.Bernardo and Richards ignite the screen with natural chemistry, speaking volumes through lingering glances and long silences. Every shared moment crackles with quiet intensity, letting emotions simmer and adding profound depth to their connection, with moments of joyful humor in between. The film is lively and, at times, playfully silly, thanks to its ensemble of supporting characters, which helps create a feel-good vibe for the audience.I personally appreciated the character development approach taken by Cathy Garcia-Sampana; the first ten minutes serve as a synopsis of Joy’s character, unfolding family issues—from the rift between Joy’s mother and father to Ethan’s desire to keep his family together. All in all, the film’s emphasis on character building, assisted by sincere backstories and strong performances from the leads, enhances its authenticity. Additionally, the film’s setting—Hong Kong’s hazy skyline, busy crowd, and colorful, grid-like residential blocks—paints a compelling backdrop for a story that leaves audiences hoping for a sequel.",2025-02-15,positive,0.9461699724197388,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"My Brutally Honest Review of Hello, Love, Goodbye (2019)Directed By: Cathy Garcia-Sampana Score: 76/100 Potato Verdict: An interesting character study of domestic helpers in Hong Kong, and addition to the OFW romance storiesPROS:1. Both Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards carried the film. Kadalasang problems for romance films is meron isa nasasapawan yung isa. Thankfully, they are both treated as seperate characters and people. Hindi yung nakadepende yung isa sa buong film. Iba talaga if non-loveteam film. 2. Alden Richards never disappoints. In fact, he’s perfectly casted as someone charming and funny but kayang makipagsabayan sa drama sa family. One of his finest performances yet kay no wonder he’s one of the best actors of his generation. Kaya I hope more quality films para mas mapakita yung acting. I’m a fan. 3. As a fan ni Kath, I can say that this film will go down as one of Kathryn Bernardo’s best and memorable performances. She’s better in roles na may maturity than the usual rom-com roles. Magaling si Kath magportray ng strong independent female character kasi mas ramdam mo siya and yung authenticity ng characters niya sa mata pa lang. I can really say na Kath is one of the greatest actresses ng generation niya. Sana lang bigyan siya ng mas challenging roles and better scripts. 4. Commendable for a mainstream film to portrayal of OFWs na nagiging TNT din. Naging strength ng film na di ginawang backdrop lang yung pagiging OFW for the sake of a love story. 3. Ang lakas ng chemistry ng #Kathden. Im not a fan of love stories pero nakakakilig sila and at the same time you want to root for them.4. It doesn’t have a forced happy ending because being an OFW means sacrifices. Buti wala na yung hahabulin sa airport then magiging pabebe then kiss with friends na kinikilig. 5. Balances romance and comedy. Pero hindi nakakalimutan na mature yung depiction sa OFWs. 6. Nagwork yung Star cinema cliche na magkaroon ng maraming friends like Kakai and other people kasi justified na meron sense of community yung mga kababayan nating OFW sa Hongkong. Natural for our OFWs to survive. 7. It showed the realities of underemployed OFWs like Maymay who graduated Education pero di makaapply ng job sa HK and ended up as a DH. 8. It also includes yung labor exploitation and taking advantage ng mga kababayan natin physically and emotionally. There’s a part where sinabi kay Joy na “I own half of you”. That’s heartbreaking pero yun yung reality na naririnig ng OFWs. 9. Ang cute ng character ni Mrs. Chung. She’s a natural. 10. Sobrang heartbreaking ng short encounter ni Jerome Ponce and Kathryn about their lives. Ang ganda ng execution and comparison ng lives nila. Dito lumabas yung acting ni Kath. 11. Hongkong as a brilliant metaphor of Alden and Kath’s love story. Unlike Barcelona: A Love Untold, mas justified yung location hindi kagaya ng ibang films na basta nasa ibang bansa. At the same time like Joy, stepping stone ang Hongkong for Canada. 12. Ang galing ni Joross Gamboa. Bentang benta sa akin yung mga lines niya lagi. 13. Maricel Laxa had a short but great portrayal. Great actress sana mas napansin siya ng iba kasi ang galing niya ramdam mo talaga yung struggle ng OFW sa kanya and being an OFW not because may choice pero because it is a need.14. Ang ganda ng cinematography and shots ng film. 15. Kahit nasa hongkong sila, maganda din yung may pa-Pageant knowing how Filipinos are so passionate sa pageantry. It also effectively shows yung comedic side ng characters natin. At least, may temporary escape and they can show sino sila despite yung laban nila sa life. CONS: 1. Very Predictable storyline and character problems. It doesn’t offer anything new sa plight ng OFWs. 2. Masyadong stereotypical yung lead characters. Just like any leading man, toxic and possesive si Ethan. I like how the actor portrayed the character even if overused na yung puro red flag ang male lead (The Hows of Us, Rewind, One More Chance, My Ex, and whys), pero ang creepy ng pagkakasulat kay Ethan sa simula. The stalking? Ang cringe di siya nakakakilig even if his character redeemed himself. Then si Kath she deserved more than umiyak and halos lahat na lang gusto niya maayos na problem. Di siya realistic. They deserved better characters. 3. This film begs the question sa dynamics of the new trend of OFW. Dati kasi yung Nora and Vilma OFWs, parents ang OFW. Now naman may Maymay and Kathryn how did it end up na children are now sacrificing their dreams and even love life. Although mentioned naman sa situation kay Maricel Laxa, but at least di ba sa generation nina Kath? 4. Masyadong forced yung ibang hugot and cheesy lines na malayo sa objective ng film to be realistic.5. Why do Filipino films really don’t invest sa soundtracks???? Umay ako sa Ikaw at Ako playing sa mga specific moments. Nagmumukhang music video. 6. I wish nagpakita sila na nurse si Kath na nagstruggle naghanap ng trabaho sa Hongkong when she arrived. Yung innocent version niya na akala niya basta graduate ng nursing. It would’ve been transformational to see her growth na that kind of promise is not true. That’s the fantasy na after we graduate may job ka na. Ang ganda sana may dialogues about Brain Drain ng nurses natin and grab foreign opportunities dahil sa mababang salary sa PH. Yung scene ni Maymay na nakarating sa Hongkong sana lay Kath yun. 7. Also Joy entering Canada doesn’t seem like a realistic solution we can all root for. Yes it has benefits but…… nasaan yung representation ng Pinay nurses who go to Canada who take exams and assessments. In real life, they still experience a much more complex and competitive process pa.8. There were illogical and avoidable moments in the film (running kahit sinabihan na stop, yung away sa bar) 9. May characters na halatang siksik lang and unnecessary na makasama sila. Maxine Medina and Jameson Blake.",2025-02-15,positive,0.8470126108119362,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"they engaged ethan's (alden richards) character into a playboy-turned-humbled archetype - genuinely falling in love with joy (kathryn bernardo), despite the latter's constant disregard to his actions when initially pursuing her. the film provides a definite picture of the fate of their relationship, though cute and sweet, is quite less interesting, honestly. not to mention the soundtrack of the film (charot). and this is coming from the fact that they also chose to navigate a much essential story: the collective plight of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) in Hong Kong. there have been numerous films capturing the stories of overseas workers. this film specifies the struggles in the eyes of domestic helpers in HK. joy is among those who has made sacrifices in an attempt to experience an economic progress. they have to live in a system that limits them as well, yet, for joy, she continues to live beyond the limited lines and risks her life for arrest and deportation. at the center, we get to immerse in the crowds of workers: 'veteran' workers hyping-up 'fresh' workers saying they will get used to it, workers busily arranging packages to send back home, phone calls of longingness and heartbreak, and we even get a glimpse of the tragic situation of joy's mother.kathryn bernardo potrayed the character like her rent is due. ang daming nangyari sa buhay niya with all the struggles, responsibility, pressures, all that continue to burden her, and she carried it all. and nasa punto siguro ako ng buhay ko na naniniwalang parang display lang talaga kung titingnan si ethan (no hate). but then again, this is direk cathy, and this is a romance-drama film.",2025-01-15,positive,0.9225544929504395,7

Hello Love Goodbye,"Really disappointed with this one. For me this is yet again one of the most highly overrated Filipino film mainly because it stars two very famous young talents of today.The plot was good but it was not amazing or special or different in any other way. There are times when the character's lines were too deep that it doesn't feel normal at all. Maybe they've adapted this deep and hurtful ""hugot"" lines because that's what catches viewer's attention when watching trailers and that's what is used for memes on social media. Alden Richards proved to people that he does know how to act. He has this charm that can make you swoon but it was not enough for me to feel a spark between him and Kathryn Bernardo.Kathryn just keeps getting better and better. Her acting on this film is way more mature than those of her other films. It's sad that her performance and Alden's was not on the same level. You can really feel that gap during the climax when they were throwing overly dramatic lines with each other.Cinematography is good especially during the first part and the climax. I love how the pallette switches from vivid & strong colors in the drama's ""hardworking"" scenes to dark, warm colors for its personal and intimate parts. Not that crazy about the scoring though. Filled with long dialogues,and clichés, Hello Love, Goodbye still did not capture the drama of being an OFW in Hongkong. It tried, and it did on the first half but ultimately it failed because that part was later merely used as a tool to make a different setting for a love story. Being a romantic movie, the film was not something worth remembering. Even though the hard to get scenes and perseverance to woo the woman are there, it remains on the box of a typical romance flick which we have already seen a number of times. It sure adapted a different ending from our most typical Pinoy movie hits back then but the execution of presenting the reason behind it was not that powerful as well.",2019-01-10,positive,0.8055422492325306,2

I hate the he used joys love as a way for her to be selfless because the world forbids a woman actually choosing herself for once instead of following certain stereotypes that a one time love can make u abandon all the hard work you've done. But as much as i hate ethans character, im giving this a big rating because of kathryn bernardo and her character. I love everything about joys character and how it's so different from other movie plots where a girl changes herself for a guy. Kathryn Bernardo honestly killed this entire movie ( both of their performance are awesome ) i just don't like the way they presented ethan and how they're tryna make us believe that he's some "" golden retriever lover boy "" when he was lowkey manipulative. Overall, i think this movie is shot perfectly, and even tho ethan is meh i think all characters has played an important role on this movie n that's why i love it very much. I love how it discussed lots of issues like how migration has become more of a necessity now rather than a choice n other stuff.i love how much this resembles la la land ",2024-12-25,positive,0.8519674624715533,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"I started December with a classic Filipino movie I hadn't watched. Recently, the sequel was released, so my boyfriend and I wanted to watch the first one first!.*Ethan is manipulative, yet his character feels very realistic. He loves Joy and would do anything to make her stay, forcing himself to make suggestions. But I admit it feels creepy.Joy's character, on the other hand, was beautifully written. The hardships of being an OFW were fully shown. I teared up when she said goodbye to Annie. The fact that she declined Ethan's offer was also valid and I applaud her for that.Overall, it would've been a 4 star if Ethan wasn't manipulative. I still enjoyed it and would totally recommend <3",2024-12-01,positive,0.9153215438127518,7

Ang konseptong ""sex lang ito"" ay pinahaba lamang hanggang sa takdang panahon ng pinagsisikapang paglisan. Una ang sarili, ang sikmura, ang ekonomiya ng sariling pamilya, bago ang kaligayahan ng dalawang umiibig.

Hello Love Goodbye,"Hello, Love, Goodbye comes across as the Philippines’ La La Land but grounded in its culture and story. A romance drama that shows the bitter reality of people trying to chase their dreams in tough situations. Actors Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards are sensational and display immaculate chemistry. The realistic story about love/dreams, will touch your heart and soul. As someone who is half Filipino, it was eye opening experience to witness the hardships of my culture. Hello, Love, Goodbye is a great romance drama filled with hard truths and reality. But with added beauty and pain to create a wonderful film. So I saw the sequel to this film Hello, Love, Again currently in theaters first. It was my introduction to Philippines cinema. Once I was informed on twitter that there’s a first film, I decided to check it out. The plot of Hello, Love, Goodbye is pretty clear cut. Set in Hong Kong, a Filipina domestic helper working hard to make the move to Canada meets a Filipino bartender trying to help his family. Even with the truth and circumstances laid out these two are drawn to each other. Leading to a honest portrayal of love, with all the highs and lows that come attached with it. It was refreshing to see a story feature characters who don’t have everything together and are also struggling. Made things feel more genuine and authentic to me. Especially prominent in the brief little joys, no pun intended and adventures they partake in to escape their reality This film did a good job of hitting you hard in the feels. Some might not like how it ended but I did. If you are a dreamer like myself, it made perfect sense. Only gripe is the humor, majority of it, isn’t my cup of tea. I really have to commend actor Kathryn Bernardo for giving us such a gripping performance as Joy. Her character goes through so much that she has to endure to maintain focus on her dream. Luckily Kathryn Bernardo really gave her best to convey the various emotions of Joy’s situation brilliantly. She had the best performance in the movie. Her co-star Alden Richards matched her incredible acting and energy with his character Ethan. Unlike Joy, I was conflicted a lot with his character and at times wasn’t a fan of his actions. But we can all relate to Ethan because love makes you do strange things. However Alden Richards adds a lot of charm and sincerity to Ethan. Hello, Love, Goodbye is an excellent romance drama from the Philippines. Even though it’s ingrained fully into its culture, it can be easily enjoyed by everyone. For we all have been in similar situations when it comes to relationships, dreams and love. I’ve always maintained that the best romance films aren’t the ones that give you the typical happy ending. This is what makes Hello, Love, Goodbye beautiful. As always, go watch this for yourself!",2024-11-25,positive,0.9314606522812563,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"Joy makes the difficult decision to leave Hong Kong for Canada to pursue her dream of becoming a nurse, which puts her and Ethan in a long-distance relationship. As they each live in their respective cities, time and the COVID-19 pandemic take their toll on their relationship. After going their separate ways, fate has again brought them together under different circumstances and as evolved individuals.This is an excellent romantic movie with a good balance of comedy and drama. The story is simple, but the combination of immigration, a global pandemic, and a pinch of cultural humor makes it unique. The story shares how love grows and changes and how individuals must grow and change to survive and thrive. With a runtime of two hours and two minutes, some parts are unnecessary and slow the overall development of the story. This is a great movie to stream for a unique international romance.",2024-11-24,positive,0.9574229206357684,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"almost perfect honestly for a filipino movie and it went beyond my non-existent expectations just because I loved how it wasn't just a romance movie. found myself crying at the intimate family moments and struggles more. from a HK PR (sorry ethan and joy) standpoint, I cried at the simplicity of their big dreams in a small place and finding the beauty in exploring that. their first monthsary made me cry!!! how ""small"" yet special ): all the places and experiences are lived realities which makes it such a good watch because they made it a perfect balance of seriousness and silliness. their conversations in central pier, TST, and cheung chau hit different! personally i'm not super annoyed at ethan because i understand being caught up on your emotions, so i'm happy the ending was bittersweet and he didn't manipulate her (extremely) into staying. let's see if he's an asshole in the second film :p also bakit sila naglalandian sa harap ng Tin Hau Temple HAHAHA wag tularan",2024-11-23,positive,0.9100256487727165,2

But it's also the story of OFWs, of people trying to make it in a country outside their own, as people fighting not only for survival but also trying to hold on to their dreams, to make them come true.

Hello Love Goodbye,ang pagkakaalam ko napanood ko na siya before pero pinanood ko ulit siya last friday bc we r planning to watch hla and mind you i also cried bc of d film. (as a iyakin girly) you will see the kasi the struggles of OFWs na akala ng mga pamilya nils rito sa Pinas ay masarap ang buhay nila roon at sobrang dami nilang pera pero ang hindi nila alam sobra ang pagtitipid kung minsan nga hindi na kumakain para may maipadala lang sa pamilya nila rito at kung minsan napakarami nilang trabaho at sabay sabay yon kaya wala silang maayos na pahinga. I admire joy kasi may pangarap siya and she's so sure na gusto niya makamit lahat yon and nothing will stop her kahit pa nagkaroon sila ng rs ni ethan. ang selfish lang nung una ni ethan bc she's stopping joy na ipursue yung pagcacanada niya when in fact ayon na lang yung time na uunahin naman ni joy yung pangarap niya bc lagi nalang pamilya niya ang priority niya. although sa last part natanggap din ni ethan and sinuportahan niya rin si joy with her decision. i hope na kapag may ganitong love na dumating sa akin i will not question the love of my partner kung aalis siya para sa pangarap niya but i will just support him instead :)) sana mapanood ko today yung hla hoho,2024-11-15,positive,0.971314936876297,5

Hello Love Goodbye,"timeless classic, a beloved filipino movie that made its mark on cinema history. Back in 2019, there was so much chaos in the Philippines, station wars, loveteams flopping, and everything in between. Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards had one shot to save it... and they freaking did!Two of the most influential Filipino celebrities teamed up and broke our hearts. Major kudos to them! Rewatching this movie now, especially with the sequel on air, I have to say it’s been the most heartfelt Pinoy film of the decade. It’s so real and authentic, showing how Filipinos have to live overseas just to earn enough for their families. Joy gave up her dreams for others, it’s so unfair but so true to life, but this guy Ethan had some problem with attachment issues lmao, it's such a perfect way to end it without them being together. Alden Richards, THE MAN YOU ARE! Can we talk about his acting? I’ve never seen him act like that before because GMA keeps giving him mid movies (not to be shady, but fr) . No wonder it became a blockbuster hit.""Joy is Here!"" This first movie is pure nostalgia. Cinematic, leveled-up, and with a soundtrack that was soundtracking. This just made me want to watch Hello, Love, Again even more now that Joy is happier in Canada.",2024-11-16,positive,0.9493149977463943,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"if you love me, why cant you choose?if you love me, why are you making me choose?filipino romance movies always felt really corny to me as a filo american, especially with those low quality cheesy montages and lines. but i always had a soft spot for them, especially due to how skilled filipinos are when it comes to implementing the perfect amount of drama and sentiment into their entertainment.this movie was pretty solid to me when considering how i was never into these type of movies. ive watched a good amount of filo romance movies and like i said, i was never a big fan. which is why i was surprised when i found myself appreciating this movie for different aspects and executions.first of all, reminds me a lot of la la land (2016) except filipino OFW version. as much as it hurts, i like to treasure those bittersweet or “tragic” love stories because its realistic. i live for the realism; the hope and joy whilst feeling that agony and yearning, bc i think it really shows u how things really are for a lot of relationships and couples; the reality. how it was never just about love and trust, but understanding. understanding your significant other, and how even when you guys do, the ending isnt always going to be “happy”. i think its a common plot and ive def seen it before!! i just enjoyed this execution and i liked the mature take on it. this movie felt like an entire leap of maturity for both the characters (esp ethan) and shows the growth of their relationship and of them as people. i also loved their chemistry, alden richards and kathryn bernardo as the main couple. i was honestly surprised bc i grew up watching some of kaths films and thought she never had a romance one without that daniel padilla dude. and i am NOT mad that i was wrong bc i rlly liked alden and kathryn together. they delivered the emotional scenes incredibly and i js loved watching them. i also appreciate another bare minimum feature (that kinda ties into what i was just talking about) but multi dimension. like i said, ive seen the plot been done and its nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary. but this movie specifically also had me looking at both sides, both dimensions, and understanding both. i saw how there wasnt a bad guy nor a good guy, how both were multi dimensional and had their reasons. i just loved how it was very clear and how raw certain scenes were.im giving it only 3 n a half stars tho bc i js still found myself cringing like hell everytime alden richards character was being creepy af and IDK theres js this vibe ab filo movies i cant get over. #lovebeingpinoy tho",2024-11-16,positive,0.9085536690858694,2

Ang perfect lang nung mata-mata acting at background scoring - chef's kiss. Ang galing din ng ibang casts lalo na sina Joross at Kakai - galing ng comedic timing nila. Best part ko yung kwento ni Joy pinakita nila kung gaano kahirap magtrabaho ang isang OFW sa ibang bansa. Talagang lunok pride para lang may maipon at maipadala. Ang galing ng storytelling at cinematography (may pagka- wong kar wai) para ka talagang nasa Hong Kong. So far, ito na pinaka-fave kong movie ni Kath.

Hello Love Goodbye,"What do you get when you mix love, uncompromisable responsibilities, and uncontrollable circumstances? This movie.The title sums it up really well. Three words that encapsulate what every couple in relationships fears -- ""right person, wrong time"". It presented a realistic view on how love can move mountains, but not one's dreams and aspirations. Although many romantic films opt to go for happy endings, I'm glad this one didn't. Ethan and Joy's motivations were so grounded and solid that it would be disloyal to their characters if they went another way.I like how the film also subverts classic romantic movie tropes by beginning with the first kiss and uttering the ""I don't love you""s. It all made sense in the end and it felt earned.Let's see what the sequel has in store.",2024-11-14,positive,0.8963632668767657,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"Hello, Love, Goodbye pulls us into the bustling streets of Hong Kong, where we follow Joy, an OFW working as a domestic helper. Through her story, the film powerfully captures the resilience, sacrifice, and quiet heartbreak of Filipinos abroad. Kathryn Bernardo’s performance is raw and compelling, embodying Joy’s exhaustion, determination, and longing. She dreams of migrating to Canada to create a better life.Alden Richards brings surprising depth as Ethan, Joy’s love interest. His character’s introspective warmth and grounded approach complement Bernardo’s emotional intensity, offering moments of hope and connection amidst the harsh reality they face. While Ethan’s backstory could’ve been explored more, Richards’ growth as an actor shines, lending a layered dynamic to their relationship.The supporting cast enriches the film’s emotional impact, with Maymay Entrata, Kakai Bautista, Joross Gamboa, Jeffrey Tan, and Lovely Abella adding warmth, humor, and camaraderie. Cathy Garcia-Molina delivers her best work yet, handling complex themes with sensitivity. Rewatching it, the film’s painful message resonates even more: love alone, often, cannot make us whole. This is a moving, memorable story of love and sacrifice.",2024-11-15,positive,0.971164709991879,9

MAN FUCK YEWWW!!! that whole scene literally just pissed me off. its so crazy how ethan already has this whole life planned for them but he never even once stopped to ask her what she wants?? or needs??? im just so glad that joy was very firm with her decision to leave tho. we love a woman who knows what she wants and lets no one hinder her from getting it <3 i truly wish they dont end up together on the sequel PLEASEEEEE",2024-11-15,positive,0.8161979134266193,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"At first, I wasn’t sure if Kathryn and Alden would have good chemistry together, but I was wrong. It’s a typical Filipino romantic comedy drama film, with a great cast and some cheesy but unforgettable lines. They look really good together, even better than Kathryn's last on-screen partner. The story is pretty much relatable, especially if you’re an OFW, because Cathy wrote it really well. She really pushed Kathryn and Alden into a whole new level, too. The only part that didn’t feel right to me was Alden’s character, Ethan. It seemed strange and creepythat Joy would let Ethan stalk her around in the beginning of the film, and he does seem a bit creepy at first. I don’t think I’d react like Joy did.

Hello Love Goodbye,"I just watched this to prepare for seeing the sequel with my cousin and I was not expecting much when I started it but already from the beginning, it sets up the story beautifully. It captures life accurately as an OFW with Kathryn’s character Joy balancing the hustle and struggle of living there. When she meets Ethan, it’s charming but not overbearing. The build up of their relationship was so natural. I love the scene choices that were made for the montage type of scenes. Then when they do finally get together it feels like a big sigh of relief. Even when it comes to the time that Joy chooses to take the chance to move in Vancouver, their conversation was honest. No unnecessary yelling involved then coming to the conclusion of letting her go for her dreams while still loving each other. It’s a beautiful message to end on.I also loved all the supporting characters. They had a reason and backstory as to what their motives are. The cinematography and story pacing was so good too.

Hello Love Goodbye,"Gave this movie a rewatch before its upcoming sequel Hello, Love, Again (2024). Same feels pa rin, grabe pa rin yung tama nung ""I love you all pero tangina pa'no naman ako!"" ni Kathryn which is nangyayari talaga, kadalasan sa mga breadwinner ng pamilya. Imagine, putting your family as your top priority is a must na kung saan choosing yourself feels like illegal, ang hirap, na kahit sa love ni-restrict ni Joy yung sarili niya, not until she met someone na tinulungan siyang buhatin lahat. Ethan made the things lighter for Joy and he taught her na wag pigilan yung puso niya na magmahal kahit sa sandaling panahon lang. Gano'n nga naman dapat, sabi nga ni Ethan ""kapag nagmahal ka, all or nothing. Kasi if you hold back, ba't nagmahal ka pa?"" at dahil do'n, naranasan ni Joy na piliin ang kung ano'ng gusto ng puso niya. But in terms of loving someone, hindi naman laging s'ya ang kailangan mong piliin.. ""kung mahal mo 'ko, bakit mo 'ko pinapapili?"" -Joy, ""kung mahal mo 'ko, bakit hindi ako ang piliin mo?"" -Ethan.. this lines reflects the fear of Ethan na baka maulit lang yung nakaraan niya and yung suportang kailangan naman ni Joy from her love ones, to take the different path she want, that leads to her dream. Hindi naman palaging nasusukat ang pagmamahal sa kung anong kaya mong isakripisyo, kasi kung sa sakripisyong 'yon, isa lang sa inyo ang mabubuo, para sa'n pa yung sakripisyong 'yon? Kaya tama lang ang naging desisyon ni Joy ""oo mahal kita, pero mas mahal ko ang sarili ko ngayon"" -Joy. Can't wait to see what will happen to them in Hello, Love, Again 2024.

It makes it more raw and close to reality.Some highlights that stuck with me:• “Ang choice, para lang sa may pera.”• “Ang selfish ba para piliin ko naman ang sarili ko ngayon?”• “Mag tatagpo din ang futures natin balang araw.” “Let’s make that happen.”",2024-11-10,positive,0.9046321988105774,-1

I remember not really expecting much from this film, and I was honestly quite surprised by it. It is a fairly solid film that’s well-directed by Cathy Garcia-Sampana. It feels a lot more mature than some romance drama Filipino films, especially in how it tackles some of its themes. It’s also carried by its two main leads, Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards, who have great chemistry with one another.

But this film definitely made me change my mind. It’s a great film. Kathryn is an amazing actress and Alden wasn’t so bad as well. This film really depicts the sad reality that several Filipinos must go through due to financial instability. The director of this film did an amazing job capturing the real-life struggles of our OFWs. Aside from that, Kathryn’s character Joy definitely breaks the typical female protagonist stereotypes in romance films where the girl gives up everything just to be with the love of her life. In this film, Joy taught us that sometimes it’s okay to be selfish for once. Especially when you’ve been nothing but selfless all your life. In life, we have to make decisions no matter how painful it gets. Some decisions are necessary in order for us to have a brighter future to look forward to. I admire her character because it shows how much of a strong-willed person she is. Despite Ethan’s attempt to make Joy stay, she knew that this wasn’t the life that she wanted and that she could do so much more. Leaving wasn’t easy for her but she knew that she had to in order to achieve her dreams. Overall, this film is so worth watching. You know the film is good when Kathryn Bernardo is starring in it :p",2024-11-02,positive,0.9065532051026821,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"Without a doubt, the film beautifully captures the realities of OFWs, and Bernardo's performance doubles it. I won't question how they weaved her character. I love how Joy chooses her own joy at the end of the movie. It was something that was empowering for me.Just wish they had a different narrative for Richard's character than the typical archetype of a guy who got traumatized by his past relationship, resulting into his playboy maneuvers in life—only to be changed by the female lead. His backstory was such a missed opportunity to utilize as a guiding wisdom for Joy while she navigates the complexities of her situation. Nabaliw sa pag-ibig, na-disappoint ang pamilya, and is now working to redeem himself. They could have stopped there instead of injecting the part where Richard tried to stop Bernardo from pursuing Canada.It could have been a love story that is self-sufficient yet consistently supportive. But oh well. What do you expect. It's a Cathy Molina film wherein stalking someone is apparently nakakakilig.Overall, I still like the film. The cinematography and the acting were superb. Sayang lang talaga character narrative ni Ethan. He could have been that linear supportive and wise love interest.",2024-11-01,positive,0.8738121206943805,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"My biggest gripe with the movie is that Joy's decision to move to Canada is unrelated to her familial dilemma. She was going to leave regardless, and the revelation of the truth to her did not make her decision to leave any harder.I think this movie wanted to be a lot of things. It wanted to be an OFW story, a love story, and a Filipino story. The ending was a story trying to find a grip most of the time.OFW stories have the same formula, one person jaded by reality, and another who yearns for something more. It works wonders if done well, and the authenticity of this one really makes for an engaging world. I left the movie knowing that I understood the Filipino subculture that occurs overseas compared to movies like ""Milan"" and ""Barcelona"". But it gets old, and it gets predictable.I would love to see a version of this movie where Joy doesn't have to leave because she's grown attached to the child and the grandmother. And working hard for them is making up for the love she missed out on. The emotional anchor of the movie just didn't work for me because I know there's no question that she'll leave. But it is an OFW story, and the family she serves will have to have some hostile moment to make us feel sympathetic to her cause. And it's getting old fast.Also, the unrelenting stalker-like behavior really does sour Alden's character. And I find it weird that the script is spear-headed by at least 2 women.Will give it props that it didn't take the safe-ending - where Ethan and Joy meet somewhere and they'll both have it all. Their decisions have consequences, and I like that they accepted it in the end.",2024-10-14,positive,0.9043656450051528,7

LET’S SEEEEHAHAHHAHAHAH very familiar dialogue @ 55:22 remaining timestampJ: So, kailan ulit kita makikitaE: Nami-miss mo na kagad ako? ⁃ Nooooo, gusto ni Ethan mag open ng bar para maipakita kay Joy na di na niya kailangan umalis papunta Canada. MALING MALI!!! Always do it for yourself, not for anyone else. Especially kung para sa pangarap!! Bandang huli, magkakasumbatan pa niyan tamo ⁃ PAKYU SA TATAY NI JOY - ang galing galing mo magsabi na “sabihin ng nanay mo sa mukha ko na di na niya ako mahal” to “kung ayaw ng nanay mo, wala na tayo magagawa” after the truth came out WOW naman. Tangina talaga ng mga tatay. THE AUDACITY *insert PARKOUR meme from the office* ⁃ Tanga Ethan, don’t make it about you please. May pinagdadaanan yung tao. ⁃ TANG INAAAAAAAAAAA MAS SELFISH KA ⁃ OMAYGHAD AYOKO NA TAPUSIN KASI MEDYO PARALLEL TO WHAT HAPPENED TO ME ⁃ I was right!!!! Sumbatan galore sa dulo ⁃ Ethan, ang tawag sayo ay INSECURE ⁃ Buti nagising sa katotohanan ⁃ Good save, ganda ending ⁃ In conclusion: I fear tragic romance will consume me more than my slow burn romance fascination",2024-10-09,positive,0.8944875964751611,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"Star Cinema + Cathy Garcia Molina is always a good watch. You can always expext a well produced, well written film that will captivate you from the start up to the end. One of the things I appreciate the most in this movie is how the supporting characters, specifically their friend groups, brought life and entertainment to the movie. While watching, I can't help but think how challenging to produce a Filipino movie abroad. I always notice the crowd looking or recoginizing the actors in the background. It is also noticable how some scenes seems to be forced or unnatural just to advance the plot. It also ironic how a film shot abroad will make you feel that it is really a small world after all, the characters are always on the same places, casually bumping into each other too much. While budget costraints are completely understandable, there is definitely a room for improvement. Overall, this movie did not fall short on giving you a classic romantic Filipino movie experience, giving you the right amount of ""kilig"" while also touching into social and family issues.",2024-09-29,positive,0.8579496542612711,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"I do not like the romance plot in this movie and thats my biggest gripe with filipino movies. i believe this was interesting enough as a movie about a struggling young filipina in a foreign country. Kathryn can really sell the idea that this is an end all be all situation for her. That she is serious and wants more in life, the average ofw experience and that she convinced me that she is her character here.She has versatility as an actress and i was delighted everytime i got to see more of her acting chops however i do find myself audibly groaning whenever alden was on screen and it makes this movie a chore to get through",2024-09-25,positive,0.9551810423533121,-1

Not only am i thrown off by Ethan coming in too strong, i hated the forced call backs. They’re also just mostly bonded by trauma. So, it would be interesting to see in the next movie if they can bond outside of it. In terms of the main theme about love being present, I think they’re actually onto something and most of the time we put a lot of pressure in relationships by thinking about lasting forever and the future.

Hello Love Goodbye,"I rewatched this recently pero nakalimutan ko lang i-logFilm wise and considering it overall, masasabi kong mahusay ang pagkakabuo ni Direk Cathy, dumudulas siya sa gitna ng 3.5 to a flat 4 stars out of 5 starsSiguro ang mali sa film na ito is more than the film itself but rather ang ating pag-iisip. Napaka-weirdong lalaki ni Ethan sa totoong buhay kung tutuusin. Siya yung lalaking mapilit na hindi kayang tumanggap ng hindi for an answer. Siya yung gaslighter mong boyfriend na lowkey pa-sad boy. Magaling mangmanipula at may paniniwalang siya ang may kakayahang gumawa ng tamang desisyon. Una ko 'tong pinanood grade 9 ako, katorse anyos kami no'n ng mga kaklase ko and majority ng peers namin at the time e kilig na kilig sa mga moments ni Joy at Ethan nung bago maging sila, kahit naman kami, lalo na yung scene nila ro'n sa backroomPero now, in the eyes of someone who has learned and unlearned substantial matters sa ating lipunan at lalo na patungkol sa gender at ang existing system of capitalism and patriarchy e sa totoo lang napaka-uncomfortable panoorin ang character ni ethanFrom the character pipeline on him I mentioned above, nag-progress siya to this man na gustong ikulong si Joy sa bisig niya dahil kaya niya namang ""mag-provide"" at mabigyan ng ""magandang buhay"" si JoyIf Joy wasn't persistent about leaving, she would have been robbed of her identity as a woman, and she would be following the path of a million filipinas, a victim to the hands of a man dahilan sa kakulangan mga kalidad na oportunidad na inilalaan ng ating lipunan sa mga babae. Nakakatuwa na hindi ito ginawang typical love story ni Direk Cathy with the motto na love concurs all type shitTotoo, may pagka-predictable ang flow ng plot pero it doesn't erase the beauty of it anyway. Kailangan natin ng ganitong mga palabas na inilalabas sa masa dahil nagiging impluwensya ang media sa tunay na buhay ng mga tao and vice versa. Kailangang mabura sa isipan ng mga babaeng pilipino ang pagiging martyr at mapagparaya sa mga relasyon. Hindi tayo simpleng alipin ng pag-ibig, at hindi porket nagmamahal tayo nang totoo e isasantabi na natin ang ating mga sarili. Hahaha nagamit ko rin 'to as a reference to one of our discussions sa major subject ko sa kolehiyo dahil maganda ang pagtatalakay nito sa buhay ng ating mga ofw na domestic helper, ang pagkakaisa ng mga pilipino, kung saan e nagagawa nating tahanan ang bawat sulok ng mundo, ahahahah marami pang iba nakalimutan ko na lang xd nasa lec notes ko 'yon hahaha palompalo ako kasi discussion namin and a good reference will hook the students to understand the topic discussed much easily tapos mas mapapalalim mo pa and their interest lingers and boogsh a successful teaching style!",2024-08-03,negative,0.8186301372267983,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"my mum turned on the TV and i fully expected her to put on a stereotypical cheesy filipino romcom where the man and the women have absolutely no flaws whatsover, the gay best friend/2 sassy women pushing her to “step out of her comfort zone” ending with the woman giving up on her hopes and dreams to be with the guy.but i was so so wrong.i was pulled in from the beginning. the story of OFWs in countries like HK and SG has been told in documentaries before, but i always felt so disconnected (?) from it, i dont really know why, until now.this movie really resonated with me having grown up with a filipino immigrant mum and her community of OFW domestic helper friends in singapore. in spite of all the pressure they faced to provide for their families at home, the abuse they may have faced from their employers, they were always so cheerful and somehow had the money to buy me gifts every once in a while??? the love and the culture i experienced growing up have shaped me into the person i am today and i will always be grateful.one of my qualms about this movie is the guy (as all of lifes problems stem from /s) and how he couldnt seem to respect her boundaries and kept harassing her until she agreed to date him??? girl, youre better than him. thats whats stopping me from giving this movie a higher score tbh. another is definitely the cringe cliches that still plague this movie. slightly forgivable given the other things i highly praised about.but i loved the movie’s exploration of women and their responsibilites towards their family. there was once a time i believed that we had fully achieved gender equality only for that idea to be shattered as i grew up. all over the world, women are the ones who leave their families, giving up on their dreams to work in an ass job in hopes of a better life. many women work full time and are yet expected to hold down the fort at home. women are abused every day. paid less than their male counterparts. seen as less than. and my heart breaks for these women, including my mum, who gave up on her dream of being a nurse in canada to be in singapore as a retail worker because she met a guy whom she would marry and have me.mum, i know it is not my fault, but im sorry that you could not make it to canada. one day i'll take you there, i promise.",2024-07-28,positive,0.8704958583997644,0

Hello Love Goodbye,"One thing going for it besides an amazing female lead is its portrayal of Overseas Filipino workers. Many films have done justice for the hardships of OFWs but this film offers a more unsatisfied and discontent perspective. As most OFW stories is heavily backed up by there ""willpower"" to provide for their family therefore giving a more touching and empowering feeling. The film went on another direction that provided a sense of realism and emptiness. It's mostly sad but it's mostly true. Film is a gem hidden under pretty big flaws (sound and just the dynamic of the leads [loved the chemistry though])",2024-07-24,positive,0.8619722227255503,2

Hindi ko naiisip na may iba ring OFW na gumagapang na para lang may maibigay na pera sa kanilang pamilya dito sa Pinas. Ganoon ang realidad ng karamihan pala, lalo na mga Pilipino na tuluyang naghahanap ng trabaho— kahit delikado, para lang maiangat sa kahirapan ang kanilang mga mahal sa buhay. Paano mo na mabibigyan yung sarili mo ng oras kung ang buong pagkatao mo ay inalay mo na para sa buhay ng iba? At sa pagkakataong magiging mas kampante ka na sa kalagayan mo, paano kung ang isa pang taong mahal mo ay pinipigilan ko upang masamahan mo siya sa kanyang paghihirap?

It's not easy being both at the same time. I'm glad she chose herself first, as most women (like her mother) isn't always given the chance. Moreover, I also applaud that the struggles in the movie are what most women (with dreams and aspirations) OFW workers go through.

Hello Love Goodbye,"with the announcement of “hello, love, again”, it’s was time yet again for me to visit this romcom gold mine. and for this second viewing, i have seemed to appreciate it a half-star more. the operatic, dramatized monologues and back-and-forths between joy and ethan have grown in me. i felt their words better than last time, somehow, and though i understand that these types of writing were manufactured to emit such reactions from the audience, i cannot deny the goosebumps-y tingling sensation i felt during such dramatic scenes. the performances i still find amazing, the dramatic scenes punched hard, the romantic scenes were cheesy but sweet, and the funny side characters were wholesome-ly funny. i did say last time that this was problematic, which if looking at it at one side, it is, but i think it was necessary to further enhance the stakes and to give the characters more reason to go or not to go ahead with their decisions. this problematic element is not in any harmful way being glorified, thus its usage increases the dramatic structure of the story and gives justification to the dramatic choices, thus giving layer to the characters and their inner selves. i’ve also come to appreciate some tiny details. the montage-like cutting was very effective in building the world and the budding relationship. maricel laxa played her short appearances amazingly. the final exchange between the leads was greatly implied like their wedding vows. and surprisingly, i didn’t hate the endless “kung ‘di rin lang ikaw” in the background. reading the logline for the sequel, i really hope they don’t fumble it, they have something special here.",2024-05-19,positive,0.9133001474233774,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"You know what? It’s actually pretty good for the most part. I still would’ve preferred a slightly different ending that still retains Joy getting to follow her dreams of moving to Canada, but color me surprised even with the positive reactions, I didn’t hate this. As much as I disliked Alden’s character (and his acting. I’m so sorry), it’s a great decision to actually have him learn rather than have men like him win in the story even if they are actually wrong. Still, I am quite mixed on several aspects of the film. Script-wise, for one, I am aware that this is a romance film but I ended up being more interested in the OFW subplot. I have merely seen the trailer of Sunday Beauty Queen but parts of this instantly reminded me of that film. To bring forward a topic such as that in a mainstream film is a nice change of pace; however, it is instantly forgotten about and left unexplored by the second half. Some may say that the film already needed more time dedicated to the romance plot but I wish it was a little more consequential to tie itself to its OFW subplot. The dialogue is a little too on-the-nose at times as well, which can make some scenes feel a little superficial. Please get rid of full English dialogue between our pure Filipino leads, please, unless absolutely necessary (in which case, it wasn't).In terms of cinematography, I found it to be on and off. There are some good shots with impressive lighting here and there, yet they are never consistent as there are also shots that are too overexposed and poorly lit for my liking. I am aware that the motifs in the score would always be based off of a mainstream song, but having heard Kung 'Di Rin Lang Ikaw even months before this film's initial release (high school tingz), I find it to be a little overplayed at some points. Oh, and louder music doesn't always mean more emotional impact!Still, I guess the film's biggest redeeming point is its direction. Yes, it's a mainstream romance film, but it offers different flavor through its more mature approach. Spotty dialogue aside, the more emotional scenes work well on their own and never feel forced, even if they are a little too on the nose. I did not feel the chemistry of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards at first, but damn it, Kathryn can carry hard. She just knows how to ground her character so well without making it feel superficial. Some people are probably tired of the comedic 'sidekick' best friend(s) of the lead female character but I personally found Kakai Bautista to be hilarious. Not all of her jokes land, but when they do, it's absolutely funny (the Vilma Santos scene probably got the loudest laugh out of me). And holy fuck, I knew that was Jameson Blake playing Peter! Why is he just so good at everything, even in playing an annoying character?Everything said here may have come across as if the negatives outweight the positives but Hello, Love, Goodbye is thankfully saved by Garcia-Sampana's (no longer Garcia-Molina) honest direction and Bernardo's strong acting. Perhaps its approach to showing the OFW life in Hong Kong can be shallow, but it's a good first step to bringing that story tied with its main romance plot into a mainstream Filipino film. Other aspects are quite weak (God, I'm sorry, but I couldn't stand Alden's acting), and perhaps a slightly different ending would have sufficed, yet by the end of it, it didn't feel poorly-made for the sake of profit. By utilizing the appeal of the two leads from their own different loveteams to tell a new romance story, it gets its point across effectively. Once the credits have rolled, I was relieved that I did not hate it, even if it's not quite my thing.P.S. I haven’t heard Ikaw At Ako in so long (high school has officially been very long ago for me) and I had no idea it would play here, nor have I known that I would hear J@$0n M@rv!n’s voice again 2-3 years P.P.S.

But Director Cathy Garcia Molina defecates those usual Star Cinema formulaic SHIT that stinks the middle part of the storyTOO BAD!The first hour of Hello Love Goodbye sets up an interesting & heartening plot & main character.Kathryn Bernardo portrays an empowering existential libertarian take of a Pinay OFW torn between her JOY dreams & obligation.But Director Cathy Garcia Molina poops many formulaic Star Cinema SHIT ruining the film.Hello Love Goodbye reminds me of Kita KitaHello Love Goodbye could've followed the cinematic style and storytelling structure of Kita Kita to be a great film.Kathryn BernardoAlden Richards is comparable with Alessandra De Rossi  Empoy Marquez#Kathden ~= #AlempoyIf only Direk Sigrid Bernardo be the director instead of Cathy Garcia-MolinaHello Love Goodbye could've been a great, well-made and well-treated film.Hello Love Goodbye works only at its first hour and its last 15 minutes of the film.The film lays out an interesting and compelling plot as well as a Kathryn Bernardo main character as Joy that we would all sympathize and root for.The concept of spiritually living in transit in a strange foreign land working hard to make a desired reality happen one day is the film's conceit that really hits hard to all of us. In this modern, demanding and even depriving world we are living in, we are all racing against time to reach our desired goals in life or else we would never achieve it.No time for JOY, no time for LOVE, no time to enjoy our current disposition NOW.This is pretty SMART stuff for a Filipino OFW story.We always watch Filipino films about OFWs where the OFW main character always sacrifices his/her life and personal well-being to fulfill his/her responsibilities to the family he/she left behind in the Philippines.This is a long worn-out story and we had enough of it.Hello Love Goodbye turns the table around.Instead of highlighting the selfless sacrifice of a typical Filipino OFW, the film smartly tackles an examination of a lonely OFW's existence in a foreign land balancing what he/she really likes against what he/she is supposed to do.I believe Hello Love Goodbye opens this paradigm which really hooks my attention and root for the story.Kita Kita almost touches this ingenious examination of OFW but never gets there as Direk Sigrid Bernardo never intends to portray such theme. Direk Cathy Garcia-Molina since ""My Perfect You"", ""The Hows of Us"" and ""Three Words To Forever"" is exploring and digging further her creative mind in coming up with ingeniously joyous Filipino stories while keeping that worn-out and obsolete Star Cinema Filipino family rom-com formula.Hello, Love, Goodbye is Kathryn Bernardo at her BEST so far. Good thing she escapes and breaks off from the tight-bound clutches of her constant leading man, Daniel Padilla. Therefore, Kathryn Bernardo is truly FREE as an actress and as a woman. Without Daniel Padilla at her side, Kathryn Bernardo did not fall down but instead rose higher than what she used to be just as an eye-candy amateur teeny bop damsel of a brute teenage heartthrob debonair.Kathryn Bernardo as Joy in Hello Love Goodbye successfully and convincingly emulates the existential crisis a Filipino OFW has to face as she braves working in transit in a strange foreign land while examining her choices and personal well-being in life. There is a strong libertarian take on Hello Love Goodbye that makes me like the film at first. And Kathryn Bernardo's great acting make that happen loud and bright on the big SM Cinema big screen. Again, this is smart stuff and Kathryn Bernardo as Joy would be one of the most striking Filipino movie characters that I have watched. At least on the film's strong first hour.Alden Richards plays Ethan who is more of a sassy comic relief yet effective MPDG for Kathryn Bernardo as Joy. His character as Ethan started out as a male creep stalking Kathryn Bernardo as Joy in a misogynist distasteful manner that even Senator Risa Hontiveros would never approve of. I guess Direk Cathy Garcia Molina is trying to make a Daniel Padilla out of Alden Richards with Daniel Padilla always bullying or tormenting Kathryn Bernardo for her to love him. Ahem! Direk Cathy. May Safe Spaces Law na tayo thanks to Senator Risa Hontiveros. Any naive sexualized young male Filipino doing a Daniel Padilla or Alden Richards to a Kathryn Bernardo is a crime punishable by fines or at worst, jail time.But I really DO NOT MIND Alden Richards portraying as a sex-crazy playboy luring Kathryn Bernardo into a one-night stand. I believe his flawed character gives merit to the powerful first hour and what Hello Love Goodbye is supposed to be.But I do wonder if Direk Cathy Garcia Molina inject that sex maniac character flaw for the male MPDG to justify that one-night stand motel scene. Seems Direk Cathy and the Filipino masses are really after Kathryn Bernardo shoving her face to Alden Richard's bare muscular chest. OMG! No wonder Daniel Padilla never passionately supports Hello Love Goodbye!  I actually like the unusual pairing of the troubled & serious Kathryn Bernardo with the carefree & hypersexual Alden Richards.This unusual pairing reminds me of Alexandra de Rossi and Empoy Marquez of Kita Kita.The Kathden dynamic in Hello Love Goodbye could have been a more improved, more substantial version of Alempoy in Kita Kita.Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards interacting in Hello Love Goodbye is similar to those sassy Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) teenage romcoms that I get to watch on HBO Red Channel. Only, the Kathden may be something more meaningful than a unusual campy romantic/sexual pairing.Yup! The first half of Hello Love Goodbye really sets us up for a promising story that I am eager to watch.Until the second half came which quickly abandons this great promising story for Direk Cathy Garcia Molina to POOP to us the standard Star Cinema formulaic SHIT that STINKS already!Hello Love Goodbye starts well.The film establishes an interesting, heartfelt OFW story, introduces a charismatic, relatable and empowering female Kathryn Bernardo lead character and builds up an uncanny yet endearing relationship between Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards.Am really expecting the real plot to unravel on the second half.However, I got appalled when Hello Love Goodbye suddenly shifts into your typical standard shitty Star Cinema family romcom formula that is so uncalled for!This really RUINED the movie!Depriving and ROBBING us of a great story to unravel.NABITIN na, NAGOYO pa tayo sa Hello Love Goodbye na ito!From an inspiring, heartfelt and empowering OFW story on the first hour;Hello, Love, Goodbye suddenly drops everything and shifts into a cheesy standard bloated Star Cinema romcom love story with lots of these shit:1. Unnecessary kilig moments, 2. Blatant over exposure of unnecessary supporting charactrers3. Instant falling-in-love that does not feel earned and 4. Speedy resolutions that does not make a big impact to the hearts and minds of the audience.So Cathy Garcia Molina still adopts her standard Star Cinema family romcom formula into the promising Hello Love Goodbye story even when the film does not really need it!Resulting to a big pile of mainstream Star Cinema SHIT taking over the 2nd half of the film.The Star Cinema formulaic SHIT forced upon on the 2nd part of Hello, Love, Goodbye feels like a typical shitty Star Cinema story of its own. Therefore, Hello, Love, Goodbye NEVER continues, NEVER finishes and CUTS SHORT its REAL and promising OFW story that it masterfully sets up at the start.We are DEPRIVED of watching a great story until the end in Hello, Love, Goodbye. The typical Star Cinema family romcom formula that Direk Cathy Garcia Molina is fond to insert is not bad always.This overused family formula does work well for some of the following Cathy Molina's films:1. ""You Changed My Life"" starring Sarah Geronimo and John Lloyd Cruz2. ""My Perfect You"" starring Gerald Anderson and Pia Wurtzbach and 3. ""The Hows of Us"" starring Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla......But NOT ""Hello Love Goodbye""!Instead, this Star Cinema formula injected at the middle part of Hello, Love, Goodbye causes a sudden change of the story, making me feel that I am not watching the continuation of its promising first half.This Star Cinema romcom formula which thrills the Filipino masses, unfortunately causes a big void at the 2nd half of the real promising story of Hello Love Goodbye.Which is TOO BAD and VERY DISAPPOINTING!It is really STUPID for Star Cinema ever since to forcibly insert that singular usual repetitive worn-out family romcom formula on most Star Cinema movies of varying stories.FUCK! SO STUPID INDEED!While this worn-out formula works on some films, it FAILS miserably and RUINS so many Star Cinema films.Including ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" as its latest casualty!The audience never gets to watch the REAL, more heartfelt OFW story of Kathryn Bernardo as Joy and her libertarian existential adventures with Alden Richards as Ethan.Instead, we get to watch another typical Star Cinema formulaic romantic SHIT which should not be part of the real story.Just like any other typical Star Cinema filmsHello Love Goodbye is so BLOATED.1. Maymay Entrata is so underutilized! Although she has a charming potential to have an Pinay HK OFW movie of her own.2. Alden Richards as Ethan's personal existential struggle may not be necessary but should not be emphasized as much as the struggles of Kathryn Bernardo as Joy.3. Alden Richards as Ethan's family should never be one of the main focus of the film.4. Alden and Kathryn's friends should never overstay their welcome to the real story.5. Maxine Medina is a beautiful yet useless distraction to the movie!6. Those kilig scenes are so forced upon Alden Richards and Kathryn Bernardo. The REAL story does not even require for Ethan and Joy to madly fall in love and become sassy sweethearts.7. Finally, the interesting sub-story of Maricel Laxa as Joy's mother who is forced to marry a foreigner to secure a resident's visa is so not explored further. Too bad!These bloated 2nd half of Hello Love Goodbye gives us unnecessary SHIT while DEPRIVING us of the real stakes of the story that really matter.I assume that Cathy Garcia Molina intend to portray the over-glamorized 2nd hour to be Ethan and Joy's existence in the NOW.With this, the film really falters.But Hello, Love, Goodbye redeemed itself on the last 15 minutes of the film.It is actually the real resolution to the existential OFW crisis that both Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards are facing.But it is TOO LATE!A big void is left on the 2nd half of the film which fails to bear fruit the promising OFW story that the film first introduces to us.Hello, Love, Goodbye could have worked if its 2nd hour is a more serious, more composed, yet truly heartfelt & intelligently memorable adventures solely between Kathryn Bernardo as Joy and Alden Richards as Ethan.Both would continue to explore their libertarian existence together either as lovers or bffs. As they continue to work their asses off in Hong Kong, they continue to examine their existence, wants, needs, priorities and obligations.And that is where their prospect about love in the world of constant demands and uncertainties take place.All other supporting characters interact at their minimum as the real Hello Love Goodbye story is soley focused on Alden and Kathryn.This is how the movie should be if it were serious enough to be a great movie.I guess Hello Love Goodbye could've worked if it follows the story and cinematic style of Kita Kita.I do wish Cathy Garcia Molina consulted with Sigrid Bernardo on how to make Hello, Love, Goodbye work.Hello, Love, Goodbye is really a missed opportunity for Star Cinema.Rather than making a great movie which is a worthy follow-up to the great Quezon's Game movie 9/10.Star Cinema chose to inject the usual mainstream formulaic SHIT that really leaves a void on the potentially inspiring OFW story which really shortchanges the audience outright!P.S. As Hello, Love, Goodbye is an exhibition of Kathryn Bernardo at her bestAlden Richards at first plays a convincing & effective uncanny free-spirited character worthy of a companion for Kathryn Bernardo.Too bad Direk Cathy Garcia Molina fails to handle Alden Richards's good talent well in the film as she foolishly swings his character from a free-spirited sex-crazed playboy into a more serious yet passionate romantic.With this, Alden Richards still performs his best in his previous film, ""Imagine You and Me"" as Direk Mike Tuveria really puts Alden's talent to good use to make the ALDUB film work somehow.""The Hows Of Us"" may not be a great film. But its strength is its middle part which Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla exhibits that magical romantic feeling artfully around an old house that is really glamorously teasing our emotions.Some scenes before that mid-scene and the later scenes after are somewhat unnecessary and could be SHIT.But it didn't damage the story for its mid-scene is awesome.""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" is the opposite.The first half and the last 15 minutes of the film are GOLD in the story.However, the middle second half of the film suddenly turns to SHIT which irreversibly DAMAGED the integrity of the entire story and film.Finally, I also complain on how Hello, Love, Goodbye visually depicts the beautiful Hong Kong.The unusually bright lighting on various Hong Kong settings are slightly irritating to the eyes.I can't really determine if Hello, Love, Goodbye has poor cinematography or Direk Cathy Molina intends to have this visual flaw on purpose to support the real theme & message of the film.",2019-07-31,positive,0.8426520285152254,9
Hello Love Goodbye,"You can look past through the sappy by it being filled with palpable OFW stories and heartfelt moments of almost every character (that scene when Joy sees her Nursing classmate having his honeymoon in HK, then is asked what is she doing there, what a tearjerker).It has many subplots about family, self-worth, career, and brief encounters that can stand alone, but their sum is a surprising and refreshing experience.(so much better when rewatched)",2019-08-01,positive,0.995303233464559,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"It's the specificity that I enjoyed the most. There have been many movies about the OFW experience, but this one roots itself in the particulars of the Hong Kong domestic helper. They're women who have made the great sacrifice to be separated from their families for the sake of potential economic prosperity. But they labor under a system that seems intent on limiting them. They are given work, certainly, but they aren't free to seek other work. To do so is illegal. Joy is pursuing a dream, seeking a life beyond being the absent breadwinner for a family that doesn't feel her suffering. And because she wants more, she can't just stay within the very limited lines of her existence, risking arrest and deportation just to scrape together enough money to find a means to a better existence. In the margins, we see the internalized tragedy of a people convinced that this is somehow an acceptable situation: veteran domestic helpers constantly telling a neophyte that she'll get used to this life, a phone call back home that's about having to extend a contract another two years. And at the center, we learn about Joy's mother, whose tragic situation exemplifies the commodification of the Filipino woman, and the trauma that it brings.The relationship stuff is less specific. Ethan fits into the playboy made good archetype: a lothario who develops real feelings for a girl because she initially rejects him, and then seems to tirelessly pursue her despite her consistent pleas for him to stop. That's a lot less interesting, even though there are aspects to Ethan's story that are kind of intriguing as well. The film bends its story around the fate of their relationship, and it isn't quite able to make it feel weighty enough to stand up to the larger issues that the characters are facing. It's cute and stuff, but it feels like a distraction from the genuinely incisive examination of the Hong Kong OFW situation.But none of that erases all the good that the film does. Even as the romance takes the fore, the movie is smart enough to make it all feel burdened by the tragedies inherent to a people who have resigned themselves to the reality of a home that can no longer be their home. Also, Kathryn Bernardo is great in this. Joy is a fully formed character: an industrious young woman who has deferred her dreams under the pretense of a necessary selflessness, struggling under the weight of responsibility all while learning sad truths that will come to shatter her conception of the life she's been pursuing. There's a lot going on there, and Bernardo just takes it all in and makes it work. Good stuff.",2019-07-31,positive,0.8969350708158392,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"This is a film I normally don’t go for. I chickened out of a midnight screening of Midsommar and caught this one instead. (I felt I wasn’t mentally ready for that haha.)But I was surprised because this one wasn’t a walk in the park too—it dropped some heavy emotional bombs. With grace though. I liked it as a whole. Was it cheesy/sometimes overly romantic? Hell yeah. But it was good. Because it was honest. Honest is beautiful. Well-acted, too. I cried lots. And they portrayed the OFW life honorably and respectfully, I think. Never underestimate an OFW’s plight. As an immigrant’s kid, I deeply appreciated how this film didn’t shy away from the messy parts of life away from one’s home country—the ugly parts of choosing to be displaced for some years in hopes of saving enough to build a better life for OTHERS who might not even deserve it. I liked the subtle commentaries. Life is unfair.It also didn’t present perfect characters, which is rare for a Filipino mainstream romance movie. This one had messy people. No hints of self-righteousness. And you can’t help but root for them because of that. I love films that do this. Remind you of the cheesiness and beauty of being human. Of falling in love, of owning pain, of being honest about hurting, of independence and codependency, of giving and dreaming.",2019-08-02,positive,0.8687009215354919,0

Hello Love Goodbye,"Hello, Love, Goodbye starts with Joy (played by Kathryn Bernardo) saying something like, ¨In Hongkong we don´t waste time because every second counts and every second we are payed¨. The film works best when it follows this premise- when Joy acts as the ´kayod lang ng kayod´ breadwinner of the family and when she desperately searches for ways to support her dream of flying to Canada to seek a job and follow her passion. However, when Ethan (played by Alden Richards) comes into the picture, this premise suddenly shatters, bringing back the movie to its commercial origin.A DIFFERENT CATHY GARCIA-MOLINA FILMThis film is envisioned to be like one of the remarkable classic OFW films in the past like ´Dubai´, and ´Milan´. Fortunately, the film doesn´t settle for that vision alone. It raises the story, nuanced to experiences by domestic helpers based in Hong Kong, where it is illegal to take another job aside from being a DH. It also digs deeper, creating a more compelling and informative story about the overseas Filipino workers in Hong Kong. To this end, the film may be given credit for its thorough research.THE MIDDLE STUMBLESIt could have been great if the film lived up to that premise and made that nuanced Hong Kong experience as it`s core, but instead it uses the romantic narrative as a way to effectively communicate with its audience. It is here, in the halfway of the movie, where it fails to function as a compelling narrative piece. Just when Ethan comes into the picture, familiar Filipino movie production processes and cliches come into play. Take for example the Wattpad-ish treatment of Ethan´s character, the way he is perceived as a playboy and later on revealed that he´s not so bad after all because of previous traumas he had encountered, the cringey mix of English and Tagalog to try to create remarkable lines, inserting some product brands into the movie that never really contributes to the story, using some irrelevant sequences and drone shots that make the film look weird and the quality subpar, and most importantly the redundant score that´s being played using different instruments to create a grandiose melodrama just like every Cathy Garcia-Molina film. Truth be told, there´s really nothing that is compelling in the film´s second part. It all looks like a really long pantomime with ¨Kung ´Di Rin Lang Ikaw¨ as background.THE SLIGHT RESURRECTIONThankfully, all the second part craze undos itself in the film´s last few minutes. Here, the struggles of both Joy and Ethan are discussed and are powerfully put together to give the film a compelling touch, grounded to the themes presented in the film´s opening. The last few minutes of the film however still feels like a long music video. Only this time, it´s disguised as a travelogue. Although, it is in this long sequence where the most delightful shots are shown, it kind of feels just like a long compilation of tourist vlogs rather than an essential part of the story. Another resurrection comes at the film´s last minute. It brilliantly presents the resolution, bringing it to a powerful last shot reminiscent to that of Alfonso Cuaron´s `Roma´, but more explicitly told.THE BEST OF KATHRYNI never thought I would say this, but this is definitely Kathryn´s film. Though this is her most daring and demanding role yet, she perfectly portrays Joy´s desperation, desire, and inherent sadness. This performance is her all-time best and I can, with no doubt say that it is something that should seriously be considered by the country´s award-giving bodies. Alden Richard´s Ethan however feels like a character that was written for Kathryn´s on-screen partner, Daniel Padilla. Despite this, Alden Richards still plays the role with heart. Unlike Kathryn´s role, Ethan is not a dramatically demanding character. This is somehow opposite to Richards´ past roles which never fails to use tears and eye acting as tools for storytelling. In the end, it feels like Alden is only a supporting character in this movie. INCONSISTENTLY GOODSometimes, Hello, Love, Goodbye struggles to cope up with it´s promising premise. At one point it proudly flaunts it´s technical excellence, and the next thing you see, a drone is randomly used to show a scene where the main characters are running on a rooftop. Sometimes it also shines as a narrative piece while the next second, it reeks of shit. This film has a lot of potential, in all honesty. However, it does not consistently makes use of that potential, and most of the time it acts like one of those commercial films in the market- settles for the mediocre, and the audience appeal while sacrificing good storytelling. Despite this, it still should be regarded as a cinematic achievement as it presents a raw aspect of the difficult life abroad despite being a studio-made film.",2019-08-02,positive,0.8696116843531209,9

They had definitely given the audience another chemistry and vibe to maybe spice things up and break that notion of having the same couple on screen; however, what really made this movie so good is its plot. Every bit of its scene mirrors the reality of life and through that, true love is depicted in the story. You may bump into some cheesy and corny lines, but you could quite see how the two leads were able to emulate the vibes of Filipinos. If you're not into romantic type of movies, don't worry.

Hello Love Goodbye,"Hello, Love, Goodbye is a film I didn't expect to like. I went to the cinema with a passive indifference to pass the time, yet I was utterly blown away once the opening montage scene started. It reminded me of the claustrophobic isolation and weariness of Chungking Express, which also took place in Hong Kong. I thought to myself that it wasn't a bad start at all and it piqued my interest, hoping it manages to be consistently good throughout. And it did.The portrayal of domestic helpers is realistic. It doesn't go all the way to make it a tragic story, to the point of being depressing, as it manages to be hopeful at times with frequent lighthearted moments. I have a soft spot for stories about OFW struggles. Being a child of an OFW, I've witnessed various injustices prevalent in the OFW community. The movie brings to light several of them, and they hit home.Surprisingly, I didn't find the romance corny at all. Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards both come from different well-established love teams, and I was initially skeptical that a chemistry between them wouldn't work. However, they manage to exceed expectations as they bring the best out of each other. Kathryn portrayed the role of Joy convincingly as a struggling domestic helper trying to make ends meet and realize her dreams. Alden portrayed the role of Ethan as your typical playboy, but he manages to bring out enough nuance to an honestly flawed character escaping the ghosts of his past.The cinematography is decent, providing enough satisfactory camera angles to capture the scenic Hong Kong backdrop. The script is pretty standard for a Cathy Garcia-Molina film but sufficiently witty, sappy, and genuine all at once. The score is average but serviceable. Certain scenes could've had more emotional impact and tension without the dramatic music. The acting of some minor characters needs improvement. Despite that, it's not distracting when you have two lead characters pouring their heart out in their respective roles.To conclude, Hello, Love, Goodbye isn't just a typical straightforward romance film for me. It had enough going on in its story to be engaging while being paced well enough. The chemistry is there, and I must admit that the movie touched me in a way that other of its contemporaries haven't. Ultimately what resonated with me most in this particular film is how it addresses love in the most honest and vulnerable way possible. Every subplot is instrumental and significant to the film's conclusion, making a brutal yet optimistic statement that I rarely see in romance stories in general.",2019-08-02,positive,0.9203540113839236,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"My expectations for this were high because of the praise it has been getting, and it does not disappoint. Beyond the romance blossoming between the two leads, this shows the hardships and difficulties of life while living as an OFW (Oversees Filipino Worker) - the limited choices and the sacrifices the characters have to endure. Kathryn Bernardo gives a stellar performance as Joy - and this is possibly her best performance to date. She is clearly supported by her male co-star who reciprocates her performance though Bernardo is the center of the story. My primary issue with Filipino romance films is the direction the romance will take when the leads are faced with a dilemma. Usually it’s the woman who ends up self-sacrificing for love, or the issues of the man are not addressed while giving the couple their happy ending. Sometimes the ending could be a cop-out, instead of letting it naturally play out. This played out perfectly - it was sensible and realistic. There was no gimmick, and the direction their relationship headed addressed the situation the leads were in. This is one for the books.Also kudos to the cinematographer and the writer.",2019-08-03,positive,0.9188260495662689,-1
Hello Love Goodbye,"Kathryn's performance here was quintessential Kathryn, Kathryn on The Hows of Us was really the best I have seen from her. Akala ko I won't hold on to Alden's character. Parang nung una kasi it didn't match him; But to my surprise, his character grew. The way the film presented his character and how we got to know him better was very effective. (May I just note that Joross Gamboa's performance here was so hilarious? Like, as in sobrang benta ng jokes na kahit ano nalang din siguro lumabas sa bibig niya ay nakakatawa rito)Story wise, what I really did like was it didn't romanticize the hardships of our OFWs, it presented the harsh reality of working outside the country. Kathryn really captured it. The film wasn't really the dark, heavy drama-ish film but it made me reflect on the privileges that I have and shouldn't take for granted.

Hello Love Goodbye,"A young Filipino woman working in Hong Kong meets a young bartender. She's about to complete her contract and go to greener pastures in Canada. Normally, I wouldn't go for this type of film. And it's by Cathy Garcia-Molina, so seeing her name normally makes me go to the opposite direction, having seen a few of her past films. But this one, to her credit, has a bit more substance. There's a compelling drama here about the plight of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW's) but blended with the formulaic romantic-dramedy that is her bread and butter. They do the usual ""hugot"" emotional romantic scene in the end where they telegraph every emotion through overly written emotional speeches each trying to out-romance each other. But it's still a solid drama before that.",2019-08-03,positive,0.8604133501648903,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"If there's one thing the movie can really boast about, it's the strength of the acting between its two leads. Kathryn Bernardo acted her heart out in this. You can literally feel the sweat, desperation and exhaustion her character endures in her stint as a domestic helper in Hong Kong. At this point, she proved that she can carry a movie all by herself. Alden Richards also proved here that he came a long way from his pabebe Aldub days. His acting definitely improved and was pretty solid overall.Although I did have a problem with how the relationship started in the first half (Alden really was a straight up stalker, wasn't he?), the movie redeemed itself after, not just with how the relationship was ultimately executed, but the execution of the film's central message of how loving yourself over everything else is not necessarily a selfish thing. There's definite chemistry between the two of them, and given how successful the movie is critically and financially speaking, I'm looking forward to their next movie together.Another thing that I really like is that (without getting into spoilers) the movie could had easily ended in a traditional happy ending. They could had easily added a certain scene in the end to do that. But they chose not to, instead delving more into an ending that is whilst bittersweet, much more grounded and admirable. It made the movie had so much more of an impact at the end (and I already really dug the last ten minutes so that was something).Hopefully Star Cinema does keep up this surge of quality and care in its films. I mean, it's not a stunning innovation per se, but it's a noticeable improvement in quality (*coughs* Vice Ganda *coughs*). If there's one thing to be learned from this movie, it's that Filipino audiences do are starting to care on the quality of their local mainstream films, and less on cheap laughs and hollow kilig moments.",2019-08-03,positive,0.9457652519146601,-1

Apart from the word play and tongue in cheek banters we've all grown accustomed to most of her films, this one hits different. And looks different as welk. From the trailing shots, the hallucinogenic montages and moody shots Ala WKW, this really is quite the departure from the usual Cathy Garcia Molina.

Hello Love Goodbye,"By far, the best Cathy Garcia-Molina movie in my opinion. Surprisingly, Kathryn and Alden definitely have a chemistry, even if they were in different TV stations. CGM really squeezed these two leads to their boundaries to deliver an outstanding movie that is well loved by the fans, the non-fans and the critics. It's not that over-the-top drama but the supporting actors really did all of that. It's a signature CGM move. The supportive, loud, hilarious friends can be quite an eye and ear sore. I know, it is to balance all the drama and stuff but does it really have to be OA (over-acting). The realism of the story is the selling point of this one aside from the lead actors. And it's perfectly portrayed and captured. You can feel the hardships, the pain, with or without experiencing it, it will hit you very hard.A sequel may or may not be needed.

Hello Love Goodbye,"I'll be the first to admit that I dismiss Kathryn as an actress simply because:(1) she is half of the Kathniel love team and I just find them so cliche and the typical Pinoy media play just doesn't do it for me anymore(2) I gave her (and Daniel) a chance went I watched The Hows of Us with friends last year and I spent the whole time cringing and regretting my decision to be there(3) I prefer JaDine because I feel they are more genuine and, basically, just more real (I don't dismiss the entire Filipino entertainment industry, fyi)Got dragged into this with friends. I had low expectations given my last movie experience with Kathryn, but I gave it a chance because Daniel wasn't in it and I thought maybe it would be a little better somehow. I like Alden, but I didn't really know how his acting chops were. I was pleasantly surprised by how the film turned out - the plot was honestly a bit predictable but it generally somehow felt more real and refreshing than other Filipino rom-coms (I appreciate this very much, given the number of stereotype Filipino films coming out in the last x years). Alden was great, and I look forward to his next projects. I'm sure he'll get more offers after this. His pairing with Kathryn, I'm sure, has done wonders for his career since this came out.I still think she has a lot of growth maturing to do in terms of her acting (my preference, at least), but seeing this film really changed my opinion of her (at least half of it, I suppose).

Hello Love Goodbye,"saw this latest star cinema drama and i wish i could say i loved it. true, it’s a marked improvement from the typical rom-coms the studio is famous for but still, despite its spotlight on a subculture of filipino expatriates living as quasi-citizens/residents of hongkong, it is still saddled by the usual storytelling cliches and harrowing contrivances that makes the film less involving and feels a tad bit manufactured. the movie tells the story of ethan and joy who meets in hongkong at a wrong time in their lives — she is trying to get away from hongkong and live her dream in canada while he is trying to reestablish his roots and his relationship with his family in the island after a failed relationship in the US. it’s a good setup but it was not unfortunately sustained when the narrative decided to give more time on cutesy scenes featuring the usual go-to “best friends” that may be permanently engraved at every screenplay that’s greenlit by star cinema bosses. and i observed one very sad thing about the movie: i understand that the intention is good but this movie seems to be telling us that families, at least in the vision of the filmmakers, are the modern-day representation of “talangka filipino mentality” — in this movie, they seem to get, however unintended, in the way of the dreams, ambitions and happiness of the main protagonists even if the portrayal depicts the age-old child sacrificing all for family. ho-hum.disclosure: i saw the brilliant film “the farewell” one day before this film and i may have been unfairly influenced by it into expecting that all films could be just as good. this movie was a quick wake-up call that not all movies are good no matter how well-intentioned they are.",2019-08-11,positive,0.8437791466712952,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"HELLO, LOVE, GOODBYE REVIEW Hello, Love, Goodbye is a film about a domestic helper in Hong Kong; her name is Joy (Kathryn Bernardo). In her last four months in Hong Kong, she met a guy named Ethan (Alden Richards) and at first, she is making him go away because she is finding money for the paper works to be submitted to the Canadian Embassy and not a friend or a relationship. But Ethan persevered and Joy falls in love with him. In this film, we can see the conflict in choosing between love or dream, their own conflicts as a character and the hard work and sacrifice of an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker). First of all, why are there many films coming out in the Philippines about adult rom com? I don’t know why but all of them is a box office hit! It is well and good that they showed the harsh reality of the life of an OFW; as a family of an OFW, it is sad for us. They are doing the best that they can, but they are still mistreated by their landlords. As big as forgetting to fetch their children at school to as little as forgetting to take the trash out. There are a lot of stories happening at once, but they resolved everything at the end. These stories are a gateway to show the main characters’ internal conflict not just between them. COMEDY IS ON POINT! Just as expected with Joross Gamboa. Not too many and not too few, just the right amount of spice. Also, there are too many cliché moments, but it worked out well without me cringing. This is one of the Filipino’s illness when it comes to films; they are too afraid of just letting the visual tell the story. Lines are too much; they somewhat gave away the story before the climax. They did not let the audience think instead they laid it all out for us. I hope that they overcome this fear and let the visual tell the story. I’m also glad that they used the original artist’s songs and not just cover it. It sets the mood rather than someone covering it. Lastly, cinematography is meh, okay but I can forgive this one because they shot this entirely in Hong Kong with some parts here in the Philippines. Overall, I give this film a 7/10. Film can be improved by deducting some parts, cut down their lines in half and let the visuals tell the story. Although, acting is on point, I think Star Cinema can squeeze more out of Alden Richards. Cinematography can also be improved by using tripods, stabilizers and a professional drone operator (some aerial shots are jittery). This is your typical “love, dream and family” story but they added the hardships of being an OFW.",2019-08-11,positive,0.8568851307586387,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"I specifically love the beginning of the film. It didn't feel like you'll be watching a romantic movie. Instead, it shows Joy's life as a DH and her story is just one of the many untold tales of the Filipino workers in foreign countries. Of course Kathryn Bernardo is a phenomenal actress and she immediately caught the audience's sympathy. A loving daughter and reliable older sister. Ethan, on the other hand, is on the other end of the line. A cute bartender with flings and hook-ups on hand. What happens when he met Joy? His life drastically changed. Although it does have some sappy 'romantic' scenes and lines that I felt like sinking to my seat due to undeniable discomfort, this is indeed a romantic movie for everyone and cliches are not cliches if they never work. Anyway, the movie is good. Both actors have great chemistry but then again, I think Kathryn Bernardo could fit well with anyone. Alden Richards has never been more handsome in my eyes. Of course, the funny bestfriends for mere comic relief. Kakai Bautista is hilarious to no surprise.

Para kasing minsan pilit acting niya, di katulad ni Alden, natural lang. Andun na din yung flaws, tulad ng may mga scenes na alam mong may mas magandang scenario para dun sa gusto nilang mesaage na ipahatid. Also yung mga unrealistic na linyahan. Sana mas ginalingan yung script imbes na cheesy at hindi tagos sa puso. Pero favorite part ko, of course, yung ending, sobrang uncertain ng life.

Hello Love Goodbye,"I didn't expect to like the movie this much, yet here we are— it deserves all the praise it's been getting. Some dialogues felt a bit cliché and that acting direction in one scene felt too calculated but the two leads were still great, nonetheless. Kath and Alden played their characters with endearing wit and charm, as their oddities make their interactions raw and believable. What I really like about HLG is that as it goes along it feels riveting on a simplistic scale, it becomes expressive of our own feelings. The theme is on the idea of love (almost didn’t work for me), but the direction pulls in the audience through its characters— I am every bit of Ethan and Joy. I work overseas but I have so much to be thankful for that I am not a breadwinner, no responsibilities aside from myself and I have a job that I wanted for myself. Movies are indeed powerful. This made me more appreciative of the life I have now— it’s good and a privilege, therefore I should not take it for granted. 6/10",2019-08-15,positive,0.9925600737333298,10

Hello Love Goodbye,"It is a feeling of mixed emotions watching the movie. Once again, we are reminded of the diaspora of Filipinos or OFW's to well off countries such as Hongkong and Canada to look for better paying jobs, no matter what these jobs are . It is sad because of the extreme difficulties encountered by the OFW's. At the same time, I feel thankful that there are jobs and income to support the families back home.Joy's work in Hongkong is hard - her pay is reduced, she gets a part-time job and runs from the Hongkong police because of it. In the middle of this, she sends home money to the Philippines and finds a friend, Ethan. Happiness finds its own source and with Joy, it is in the Central Park where all the ""kababayans"" provide comfort to one another in the middle of a foreign country with an alienating culture. It is also in Ethan whom she fell in love with.The movie is well directed and masterfully portrays the lives of domestic helpers. Salute to Cathy Garcia-Molina! The script is tight and romantic which clicks with the Filipino audience: ""when you talk to strangers, there is no judgement"" and "" I love you"" (witty remark to mean stay away).Finally, Kathryn Bernardo acts very well, she is the next Bea Alonzo.

Hello Love Goodbye,"Letter Grade: A (Masterpiece)This is genuinely the biggest surprise in cinematic history for me... now, this might seem utterly ridiculous, for me to call this film a “Masterpiece”—and of course, it really isn’t—but man do all the positives about this film outshine the very small qualms I have about this surprsing, genuine, and heartfelt Filipino romance. I really don’t know if it’s because I was only very slightly intoxicated, or because I’m a 20 year old gay Filipino in a wonderful relationship with my oh so sweet and loving Brazilian boyfriend, or the chemistry of Alden and Kathryn, or the admittedly cheesy but so emotionally-charged well-weitten dialogue, but this film... this film has made me cry more than any other film I’ve ever seen. More than my ultimate favorites, Lord of the Rings, Cloud Atlas, Spirited Away, Cinema Paradiso, Boy and the World... I literally had to turn away from the screen and bawl on my boyfriend’s shoulder in the cinema when that last conversation in the pier between Ethan and Joy. I really don’t know why this film struck me so hard. Maybe it’s all of the reasons I’ve lifted above. Or maybe this film is also just alright if I revisit it in a while... but wow, I really did not expect this reaction out of me going into this at all. By all means it is definitely not a more technically outstanding film than any of my other favorites, but man I’d be lying if I said this film didn’t touch me to my core. What a solid, beautiful film from Cathy. And such nuanced, magnificent performances from Alden and Kathryn. I’m glad this film exists.

Hello Love Goodbye,"Alden Richards’ character, Ethan, is pushy, creepy and problematic. He will continue sending friend requests even if Joy declined several times already. He will make the radio station talk about Joy in public without her permission. He will use another phone to text Joy anonymously. He will act like a police even if Joy is weeping out of fear. He will squeeze through inside a small room knowing that Joy will be uncomfortable. He will continually send “Need a friend today?” text messages even if Joy has rejected it so many times. I don’t know how a Filipino girl reacts to such moves, but if people consider this as “nakakakilig,” there’s a problem. It almost gave me the same queasy feeling of the stalking problems I saw in Kita Kita and the French film Amélie.Hello, Love, Goodbye is at its best when it tells the story of Kathryn Bernardo’s character, Joy. In some ways, the film manages to outdo similar mainstream Filipino romance films because of Kathryn Bernardo’s stunning performance and the earnest depiction of OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers). Bernardo, whose acting holds the film together when it was falling apart, effectively evokes a palpable sense of weariness, discontent, and eagerness to alleviate Joy’s situation. Actually, I can do without the La La Land love story if the social commentary was strengthened and expounded more. In a similar vein with Sunday Beauty Queen, the film resonates with Filipinos because of its sensible portrayal of what it is like to work abroad in a job you are overqualified in.But Cathy Garcia-Molina’s picture falls apart as the annoying, melodramatic score continues to play in the background, tackier drone shots are added, and more forced, “hugot” dialogues are delivered by the leads. Sure, this is how cliché-ridden mainstream Filipino romance plays out. But how I wish we get movies that transcend this generic romantic stratagem. Hello, Love, Goodbye fails to offer something new to romance movies as an art form, and it is disappointing since the OFW story and Joy’s arc have so much potential.",2019-08-17,positive,0.8179045878350735,6

Hello Love Goodbye,"Your typical “troubled boy falls for a bright young girl”-themed romance— “A Walk to Remember” a.k.a. “Grease” a.k.a. “Say Anything”— Cathy Garcia Molina’s “Hello Love, Goodbye” discovers puppy love in its purest form. It has plot and spiels topped with cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan, cottage, and blue cheese. Pairing Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards is a genius move. This film showcased how good actor each of them is. Of course, we do not forget the supporting cast because they added extra entertainment and drama. The movie never failed to give a sense of claustrophobic feeling of alienation and loneliness in a developed world— the very reason why I think portrayal of Maymay’s character was so realistic. It is a good movie with great acting, average screenplay, and story topped with layers of clichés from the romantic drama genre.",2019-08-17,positive,0.974560626915523,9
Hello Love Goodbye,"MY TWITTER REVIEW:The love story of Hello, Love, Goodbye (2019) couldn’t be more formulaic, although I won’t dismiss its sad factor, but I really couldn’t care less for it after the movie ended. What the movie successfully conveys is the sacrifices people make to have a better life,...to make ends meet, even if it means being away from the people you love. The family aspect of the movie really got me, it’s the subplot that actually made me cry. The plight of OFW’s in this film was executed very well—sensitively, with a lot of heart.It made a good depiction of how families want to be together but can’t, the pain and consequences of being away from them, dreams that have to be put on hold and the resilience of OFWs. I loved the movie because of that aspect. Again, as to the love story, not so much.MY FACEBOOK REVIEW:I have to admit that the love story of Hello, Love, Goodbye (2019) didn’t charm my socks off. It couldn’t be more formulaic and to be quite honest, it bored me. (Please don’t attack me )What I loved about it though, and where the film actually succeeds, is its depiction of the life of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW). It was executed very well—grounded, sensitive, full of heart. It showed how resilient Filipinos are and how we find humor in everything. That in any way that we can, we always find/create families when we’re away from our own.The film conveys how sacrifice can be selfless and also selfish. Selfless in the aspect of going away from your loved ones and braving a new world alone to make ends meet and eventually have a better quality of life. Also, that sacrifice can also be selfish, but not the bad kind (? I hope you get it), when it comes to choosing yourself, choosing your dreams instead of always trying to make the people around you happy.The values of this film resonates, especially in every OFW family, how families always try their best to be together albeit it might not actually happen or whenever it does, it’s going to be a long, long time. That in the end, and this might sound corny, love transcends loneliness, fear or hardship.My favorite scene would be when Kathryn, Kakay and their other friend were watching Vilma Santos’ iconic speech in ‘Anak’ and Kakay sobbingly asks, “Ang pagmamahal ba sa sakripisyo lang naipapakita?” It’s a good question, and my answer is NO. Sacrifices are not requirements in love; we don’t have to sacrifice anything just to show someone we love them but we do it because that’s how we try to make it work with someone we love and it’s necessary.",2019-08-18,positive,0.9254335602124532,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"This movie is beautiful, but it does not shy away from those imperfections. No. 1 is it does not know what it is, is it a movie about the struggles of an OFW or a romance film? When you think about it the romance between the two is like just a segway to give us a tearjerker at the end. No 2 is the transitions of scene to scene, I promise you in every 10 minutes of the film I went from smiling straight into being sad. No 3 is that Joy in this movie is hell about not being allowed to breath in this film, from the first 3 minutes of this film she is already the saddest person i seen on a start of film. Lastly, the supporting characters are floating, they have nothing to do in this film, they are flat and one dimensional, the actors and actresses of those supporting characters disappointed me because none of them stepped out of their comfort zone in acting. BUT I can't take the magic of the story and the power of these two.

LMFAO. fuck. what the fuck @cgm????? also loved how this was all abt self love and letting go and had an openended ending. suuuuuch an improvement from My Exes And Whys. i mean, there was still the reinforcement of misogynistic/patriarchal values, but that’s just a problem w the filipino media/culture as a whole !!!!!!!!! this film was abt how u need to choose urself and love urself before anyone else and i luvd it !!!!!! and not letting a man decide ur life and/or deciding ur life based on a man, and instead letting said man figure his own self out instead of putting his problems on u !!!!!!!!! fuck !!!!!! fucking LUVD IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! finally some good fucking FOOOOOOOOOOD !!!!!!!!!i really hope cgm continues in this direction in the rest of her work. bc. fuck. merely thinking abt My Exes And Whys makes me FURIOUS. more self love and (real) independent women plz !!!!! less misogyny !!!!!! THANKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ALSO, speaking of She’s Dating The Gangster, i was curious to watch this w the lack of daniel padilla. at the beginning i was almost ???!!!!??? at the beginning bc we waited like 6 years or smth ??? for kathniel to kiss ??? and now we got a fucking sex scene of kathryn w alden in their first film together ????? holy fuck !!!!!! but then it didn’t happen and the rest of the film carried on w their non pda ways and i was disappointed again. but SPEAKING OF ALDEN RICHARDS. I’VE NEVER THOUGHT HE WAS CUTE AT ALL. (neither him and daniel are cute. there. i said it. fight me). but HERE ??????? IDK IF IT’S JUST BC HE REMINDED ME OF THE LOVE OF MY LIFE TADASHI HAMADA FROM BIG HERO 6 WHENEVR HE WORE THAT BASEBALL CAP, BUT BIT H ????? I’D DIE FOR HIM NANDNSJJXJSJDJSJS. but i’m 110% sure it was only bc he looked like tadashi w the hat and sweats on and bc of the many kilig moments. in reality, all the dudes who played his best manbun friend and his two brothers were significantly more hot than him. and i luvd it  not that much. but ya kno. i luvd it. ANYWAYSYHSHSHSHSDJSJJSJDHSHSHJJJJJJ ,,,,,,,,,,,, i fucking loved this movie. i fucking love filipino romcoms. i fucking love kilig moments. i fucking love love. i’m fucking back on my bullshit. and i need to fucking calm down. time to watch Blue Valentine (2010) and remember that love isn’t real and doesn’t last. thanks. bye.ps: everyonw in my family always says i look like kathryn bernardo and i deadass do not see it at all like literally 0% like there were a few times furing this film whrnbi thought ??????? do i look like that ?????, maybe i do ??? but the answer is i DON’T !!!!!!!!!!!! if i do look like kathryn bernardo irl and i’m the only one who doesn’t see it, then i’ll just accept it as body/facial dysmorphia ,,,,, but i’m pretty sure that i Don’t and i’m not letting filipinos in the philippines who i’ve nvr actually seen in the flesh tell me differently LMFAOOOOOOOOO ,,,,,,, and /Rest.",2019-08-18,positive,0.8498285521160472,2

Alden's character is unlikable and even his redemption story arc doesn't make up for his witless appearances in the first half. He just shows up, gives some forced cheesy one-liners and smiles. Kathryn's character on the other hand, is smart, well-helmed by Kathryn Bernardo herself, but pairing this workaholic persistent with her dreams and grounded in reality with the carefree Ethan doesn't make for good chemistry between the two lovers nor ultimately, a satisfying romance.",2019-08-19,negative,0.7953877747058868,10

Hello Love Goodbye,"""Hindi naman doon nagtatapos ang buhay. Lahat ng gusto mo sa buhay, puwede pa rin, You can be more.”Hello, Love, Goodbye is one of the great Filipino films I have watched this 2019. I really love the way this movie portraits Filipino values of people working in Hong Kong for their families. Pursuing your own interests/ambitions away from their loved ones while also considering your family's immediate and important needs is one of the most difficult sacrifice everyone can encounter. This movie really thought me how to prioritize yourself more and to support each other's back when it comes to achieving your goals. For Joy and Ethan, distance doesn't matter as long as the roots of their relationship were strong enough.Superb acting performance of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards. Every lines they have delivered really struck me. The drone shots shown in this movie are really amazing. Excellent choice of songs for their soundtracks. Job well done for the people behind this successful movie! Raw rating: 80",2019-08-21,positive,0.9335756626996127,9
Hello Love Goodbye,"The chemistry between Alden and Kathryn is quite surprising. They were a shade of bomb in this film, showcasing their stunning performances. I did like the first half of the film but it sort of lost its flavor on the latter part because of the catapult from one feel to another. The concept of the film is rather generic but it was overpowered by the provoking realities it laid out that OFWs in HK experience.

Of course he's a fuckboy who'll develop genuine feelings for the lady because why wouldn't he?6. IMO, it looked like the film was exploiting handicap people/making actors play handicapped characters to evoke sympathy from the audience. Okay, sure.7. Sponsored by Frontrow Philippines. Fuck off.8.

Effective and engaging kasi everyone ay relate sa existential crisis ni Joy (Kathryn) as a dreamer and a family member.- Grand gestures in films are really alarming.

Hello Love Goodbye,"For the first time I watched a Kathryn Bernardo movie in the cinema, since I'm not a fan, and I must say it did not disappoint me. The movie is a great depiction of the OFWs in Hong Kong, particularly the domestic helpers, through a romance film. Bernardo did great in this movie playing a domestic helper named Joy. Her character was well developed and mature and Bernardo was able to fully portray it with finesse. As you watch the movie and Joy's development you'd feel like you're watching the true pains and hardship that our fellow domestic helpers go through with their work and life in Hong Kong which I think is when the movie is at it's best. As for the romance part of the movie I did enjoy the on screen chemistry of the two leads and how they went through although their story is not as strong as Joy's personal story alone. Richards is fine as the opposite of Bernardo although I do cringe whenever he needs to deliver the cheesy taglish lines which I really don't like in most Cathy Garcia-Molina movies especially that the way those lines was written in the script, it's just that it did not matched with Richard's character Ethan. Overall I did really enjoy this movie from start until the end even though there were some low parts of the movie you can overlook those and find the movie enjoyable and will be happy to recommend it to anyone to see.",2019-08-10,positive,0.9716006964445114,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" is another landmark on Cathy Garcia-Molina's illustrious filmography. While it may not be her best movie, she sprays her piece with hints of realism, grit and realities on the backdrop of being a overseas worker. All the while, she brought it with some weight and optimism that makes it stand out from her recent movies, even though the tone seems derivative from them. It all works because of the performances of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards, who are able to carry the levity of their down-to-earth characters. And their chemistry is surprisingly exquisite and wonderfully executed that their solution pays it off. The rest of the movie is filled with neat cinematography, a good pace and a cinematic feeling. And even if the rest of the cast fall on the usual entrapped cliches, it is Bernardo and Richards' rapport that makes ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" transcend to its audience. It is one of those Filipino romance movies where I do not hear an over-the-top shouting match. That is at least an achievement.",2019-08-26,positive,0.9709587958123949,9

(makes me want a love life jk). but i like the message of how it's really important to find ourselves first and reach for what makes us happy in our own way because self-love is a very important thing that we should all consider. it's not bad to care for ourselves first. it's not bad to be selfish even just once especially when you always give your all to others that you don't even leave some for yourself. Joy has been sacrificing so much for her family even having to work abroad as a Domestic Helper just to help in her family's finances that seeing her finding her happiness, finding her joy and thinking of herself as well is such a great development of character. it helps to inspire each and every one of us to chase our dreams and to chase what makes us happy whatever it may be or no matter how dumb it may sound.p.s.

Hello Love Goodbye,"First of all, Grabe saludo ako sa mga cast and staff for a job well done! Sobrang good job sakin yung pagkakagawa ng movie kasi hindi sya narrative. Hindi sya yung typical na romantic films lang kasi meron syang substance and hindi sya puro landi lang. So yes eto lang naman po yung limang natutunan ko sa movie na to. 1. TIME - Kailangan nating pagkatiwalaan yan hindi lang sa love or career. Kasi TIME is everything. Ako lagi kung sinasabi sa sarili ko na ALWAYS ALWAYS TRUST THE PROCESS kasi lahat ng mga nangyayari satin lahat yan may rason hindi man natin gusto yung outcome pero at the end of the day lahat yan may purpose and something more meaningful will be handed out to you. Pasok ito sa lahat ng aspeto ng buhay. Time can change everything and it gives us the flexibilty to grow. 2. SELF LOVE - Sa panahon ngayon napaka hirap i apply to sa totoo lang kasi aminin natin na bigay lang tayo ng bigay sa mga taong mahal natin. We became selfless and nakakalimutan natin na mas kailangan natin i prioritize yung sarili natin hindi dahil selfish tayo, Kundi mahirap lang talagang ma lose natin yung sarili natin in the process. We should know our worth and value kasi at the end of the day sarili lang natin ang makakasalba satin. 3. PLANS - Hindi porket plinano mo eh yun na yun, Based sa experience ko ayoko na talagang nagplaplano or nasasalita ng tapos kasi hindi ko sya napapanindigan sa totoo lang, And dahil dun natutunan kung maging versatile and flexible sa life. Dapat open tayo sa possibilities and mga pwedeng mangyari mapa negative or positive man yan. 4. FAMILY - is everything, Kahit sino satin walang idea kung kailangan tayo kukunin ni lord. Kaya make the most it and make time for your family. Sobrang on point and usapang family sa movie na to. Nabigyan nya talaga ng emphasis. Na kahit ano at sino kapa pamilya mo lang sasalo sayo at the end of the day. So we should be greatful. 5. LOVE - Para po ito sa mga single at sa mga in a relationship. So hindi naman porket single ka eh katapusan na ng mundo tandaan nyo na masaya i enjoy yang ganyang phase ng buhay. Kasi dyan ka mag grogrow as a person and dyan mo mas makikilala ang sarili mo that will make you the better version of yourself. Don't let society dictate you what to do. Just Relax and Chill! :)",2019-08-09,positive,0.8690329241752625,4

I was surprisingly riveted by the first part but then it lost steam in the middle. I didn't feel the romance between the characters of Alden and Kathryn that much, but I commend their performances.

Hello Love Goodbye,"I was almost ending this year without watching a Filipino film (which is pretty embarrassing because I’m a Filipina). But this one, the highest-grossing Philippine film of all time, was the exception.I'm really glad that I have finally seen this. It was truly heartfelt and emotional. Well, I guess for me. 'Cause when you grew up with overseas working parents and became the guardian of your 4 younger siblings at the age of 14, and now that you're an ofw yourself, you just know. You get to empathize with the plight of the OFWs, and as you get fully immersed with Joy's character, you can no longer stop crying. (I so love Kathryn Bernardo, so Yes!)I actually plan to study for a Master's degree soon, so I'm starting to write a concept paper regarding the situations of the OFWs here. Exploring their social conditions, and the stigmas and prejudices they are being confronted. But if things won't turn out the way I want it to be, at least I get to do something really fulfilling on my part.I love you all, pero 'tangina.

Hello Love Goodbye,"Leave to pursue your dreams, or stay for the love of your life? This is the question that Hello, Love, Goodbye asks us. This latest offering from Cathy Garcia-Molina, best known for her Filipino romantic comedies, is set in Hong Kong. Molina sheds light on the experiences of Filipinos working overseas by following the story of Joy and Ethan, two Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). We see their lives unfold through the eyes of Joy, a hardworking domestic helper who’s trying to save money to move to Canada as a nurse, and Ethan, a bartender trying to find his motivation in life.Hello, Love, Goodbye stars two of the Philippines’ biggest names from the two of the biggest “loveteams”—Kathryn Bernardo (from KathNiel) and Alden Richards (from AlDub). What’s also surprising is that Bernado and Richards are from rival television networks; in the Philippines, it’s common for actors to be signed to one network exclusively. Their performance in Hello, Love, Goodbye proves that once in a while, it doesn’t hurt to break out of your loveteam to grow as an artist. In Hello Love, Goodbye, Bernado graduates from her teen roles and blossoms into a dramatic actress—a total transformation from her child acting days—in a tour de force performance. Richards rises to the challenge and exhibits his versatility as an actor, proving why he’s one of the country’s matinee idols.To get into their roles, Bernardo was separated from the cast to better empathize with Joy’s feelings of isolation; after just a week of filming in Hong Kong, she wanted to go back to the Philippines. Richards, on the other hand, lost almost 25 kg to play Ethan. Molina is notorious for her strictness with the artists that she works with—but it’s paid off as they are all household names, and her films have been blockbuster hits.Hello, Love, Goodbye’s story is not new, yet it provides us with a unique perspective of the realities of being an overseas worker. The film tears away the layers of the OFW experience with sheer intensity. Shifting away from showing the employee-employer relationship found in other films about OFWs, Molina brings her focus to the OFWs themselves, and their families back home.Read the full review here: https://www.cinemaescapist.com/2019/09/review-hello-love-goodbye-movie/",2019-09-01,positive,0.9123755280788128,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"I love the sincere portrayal of the specific OFW experience of domestic helpers in Hong Kong. The romance wasn't new ground, but still relatively mature within Filipino sensibilities. But the nail in the coffin for this film: the emotion wouldn't stop flowing as I thought about my Tita who’s life pretty closely to Joy's where she came to America as a worker to work to send money back to her family and then fell in love. The movie leans in to the “Novela” aspect just enough while keeping its feet on the ground. But the real star here is Kathryn Bernado WHO SOARS IN THIS MOVIE!

You said that their story are like ours, but it will be much better because we can decide the ending. My friend even told me that we should see this because she was reminded about us. Now I get it. To be perfectly honest, what we did was a gamble. I was supposed to transfer my love letter to you in a scented paper. We were supposed to see each other tomorrow. I was about to post a picture about us on Instagram. I was supposed to introduce you to my family and friends. We could have made it work, but we didn't. Ethan of my life, I told you multiple times that I wasn't ready, but you keep on and I let my guards down. I told you many times that we can't, but you made it seem possible. I told you that I am going away and that, you're willing to give up everything for me. I told you that you cannot make me choose about you and my career, but I was going to tell you that maybe I can compromise.However, you didn't. I think we both knew that we are both throwing away our lives to the uncertainty of us. I told you that love alone or our affections and words will never amount to the future of us. You said, let's give it a try and take a risk. Little did you know that I've already given a part of me for you. I'm not mad. I promise. I can't blame your premature promises and affirmations, but I should have known better. I've seen and heard those before. I thought maybe this time, it'll work. Hands down, it didn't. Thank God it didn't. I'm trying to be happy now even though I'm still hurting. I just wish that we shouldn't have made those plans together because it is true when I told you that you make me happy and that everything will make sense with you. I'm sorry if I have ever hurted you. I was inconsiderate at times. If my friends would ask me, I will tell them that I did not regret meeting you because you deserve all the love. I will pray for your happiness and health. I hope you're not skipping meals or burning out too much from work. I also hope you get yourself checked. And lastly, He misses you so much.

Hello Love Goodbye,"10 minutes into the film and I am already teary-eyed.Hello, Love, Goodbye is the film that is sure to be successful. It stars actors that has a huge fan base and the storyline is centered on love. I didn’t think much of it at first and expects it to be just another hugot film. Especially, Cathy Garcia-Molina was directing it. One More Chance 2019, I feel like. But, it’s different.One, the setting was in Hong Kong. The film made sure to maximize their time abroad by shooting in different locations. Also, they highlighted it in a way that the scenes are almost always outside. The team guaranteed that once the movie is seen, the audiences will be transported to Hong Kong as well. Second, aside from love, the movie dwells on the topic of work. How OFW’S work themselves to the bone and how they survive on a day-to-day basis. Kakai Bautista’s role was the most impactful for me as an OFW. She might not have as much lines at Kathryn Bernardo’s but when she says it, it rings true. Lastly, the feministic principles of Joy, the heroine. There might be a trend of feministic heroines on Cinema lately like Nadine Lustre’s on Never Not Love You but it still is special. The way Joy was written was phenomenal. The dialogue was on-point, the justification is there and the way the character grew was understandable. Her decision especially on the Climax point of the movie hurt but it is inevitable. Her line of how the emptiness inside her will never be filled by romantic love alone was poignant. Overall, the movie is great as it arises discussion amongst its viewers.

Hello Love Goodbye,"It's your typical Filipino movie scenario where boy meets girl, they fell in love with each other, at the near end of the movie they have this big fight/misunderstanding, and in the end, they either make amends and be together or they continue on with their single lives. Nothing new, the same old same old, recycled love story that has been told numerous times in the past. Though Kathryn and Alden were good in this movie, its the story itself that lacks a new perspective. I mean it is soooooooooo predictable from the start, this scenario of a love story was already even told from a local TV series but it's a shorter version of it (Hell, I can't even remember the title of that series anymore)!",2019-12-15,positive,0.8687763959169388,2
Hello Love Goodbye,"What I love about Hello, Love, Goodbye is its effective portrayal of the hardships and lives of OFWs. Kathryn Bernardo is really effective in her role as a selfless domestic helper and I'm surprised that she and Alden Richards has chemistry onscreen. I like the montage in the film's opening sequences and Bernardo's opening narration. I still cringe the cheesy lines, the usual family conflicts in Star Cinema's films and the overdone scoring. Nevertheless, this film is still good. But nothing still beats Milan when it comes to showcasing OFW hardships and trials abroad. Claudine was excellent there and I think that it's a masterpiece.",2019-12-17,positive,0.9729851228850228,9
Hello Love Goodbye,"""I don't love you.""What could've been a typical Star Cinema rom-com turns out as a less-typical one. There are cheesy tropes that are in the same realm and this is far from an indie rom-com spectacle. However, what made this different is how the story revolves around on dreams and choosing to grow together even when apart from each other.At first, I found the Alden and Kathryn team-up quite odd and don't fit well but as the film progress, their chemistry blossoms and the dialogues between grow on you. Kathryn definitely carried the film and it felt as if Alden is the support that completes the film with her.The overall heart of the film is pretty much there and makes this stand out from the rest of the Star Cinema rom-coms in the 2010s.",2019-12-17,negative,0.9265372604131699,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"Hello, Love, Goodbye catapulted itself as not only the highest grossing Filipino film of 2019, but also of all-time. Unlike previous title-holders, this acclaim is well-deserved because the film is actually good. Two overseas Filipino workers (OFW), Joy and Ethan, meet in Hong Kong and fall in love. However, Joy is planning to leave the city soon to pursue her dreams elsewhere. Meanwhile, Ethan is about to become a permanent resident and is at the cusp of building a long-term life there. What’s most notable about Hello, Love, Goodbye is how it immerses us into the OFW experience — the daily hustle, the homesickness, and the impermanence of it all. Not that the story is any different from Anak or Sunday Beauty Queen, but the film managed to go deep into the lives of domestic helpers and Hong Kong residents with so much authenticity and breadth. And then there’s the pairing of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards, which propels the film’s dramatic stakes to even greater heights. Both are completely believable not only as lovers, but also as people trying to make their families proud. The film’s overarching theme of “chasing after your own ambition” will surely resonate with everyone — that being in a relationship doesn’t mean that you have the same goals in life and that ambition is a personal thing. Every once in a while, we get a Star Cinema film that breaks out of the rom-com mold and superficial happy endings. I am absolutely floored with how the film ended. Even more so that they didn’t attempt to reverse the “goodbye” with an “after 10 years” epilogue.",2020-01-01,positive,0.953194104708158,9
Hello Love Goodbye,"Being a Filipino working overseas feels suffocating, which this film manages to execute that feeling perfectly thanks to the performances of Kathryn Bernando and Alden Richards.The reason why people love this film wasn't because of the romantic moments between Bernando and Richards, but because of how the film depicted the unglamorous life of an OFW.",2019-08-13,positive,0.9802384972572327,2
Hello Love Goodbye,"After bringing more misses than hits, it's safe to say that HELLO, LOVE, GOODBYE is the film that finally gets Cathy Garcia-Molina back on her feet to once again captivate the Pinoy cinephile's attention thoroughly. As a celebrated contributor to modern Philippine cinema with her iconic Star Cinema features from previous years, she seems to have lost her touch with her being inclined on quantity-over-quality style of releasing films. 2018's 'The How's of Us' which starred Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo may have worked for some, but to others, it all still felt trite and stale as that still felt like a star vehicle than a supposedly enthralling story-centric piece about young romance.Molina must've listened to the critics because her 2019 offering is quite special for a lot of things ––– all of which make it a solid venture into new horizons for the filmmaker that hopefully, she'll continue to explore to continue an exciting streak of films potentially started by this one. If one were to take it a step further, it's also a bold film, really for what it shows and tells to the audience as a mainstream release that makes it slightly unconventional and powerful. What makes it so is the strength of the discourse that astonishingly, marvelously overpowers that of the Star Cinema rom-drama formula that Molina has always gripped onto. It seems to have came at an opportune time, too, considering the state of Hong Kong during the time of its release which makes it a film of considerable significance that brings enlightenment to a wide audience about the OFW experience overseas. The film can work and be enjoyed both ways, and that's really where the magic can be found, tasted, and adored. As a social commentary piece about the lives of OFWs in Hong Kong, it's fascinating and moving specially because of how the characters of Joy and Ethan are written with specificity where the drama is stressed and is made impactful. And so, that brings us to the other side of the film that makes the romance that they try to invigorate worth buying into knowing their stories that can pretty much be anyone's. Looking deeper into those two facets of the film, it seems like everything here works fine and well, and indeed it does that it feels like a charm so unbelievable in how it is conceived.Though the film may still fall under the trappings of Cathy Garcia-Molina's films, such as the sappiness of the romance or the movie-like dialogue that takes away an amount of authenticity, they aren't huge hindrances to the film being well-formed. Molina doesn't merely make it all feel like a star vehicle for Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards after all since there's meat given to the characters they play courtesy of co-writers, Carmi Raymundo and Rona Co. It may be unexpected, but believe it or not, the screenplay of the film is astonishingly rich even if the direction isn't as masterful as one would like it to be. The actors really work from that, bringing great stuff for us to commend, absorb, and feel; almost Even with the flaws resting in it, there's no way for one to not be won over by what this film packs. A love letter to OFWs not only in Hong Kong, but all over the world who sacrifice themselves for love in different ways, it rightfully deserves to be seen and embraced as a new classic for the memorability of how it converses, which shows its profound dedication and respect to those it represent onscreen with immense accuracy. It's honestly the kind of Star Cinema film that you'd hope to be made more often; tempered, substantial, and resonant ––– a film that knows how to reach its audience in ways that don't feel too compromised and feeble in their attempts.",2020-01-04,positive,0.9855072966643742,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"""Ang choice para lang sa may pera"" (Choice is only for those who have money)It makes me so happy this rom-com is the highest grossing Filipino film of all time. Cathy Garcia-Molina obviously knows how to make a rom-com filled with the genre's tropes & make it sing. Turning it into a love story between two intergenerational Overseas Filipino Workers in Hong Kong who are bound by the struggle to survive under late capitalism & the sacrifice they made to leave their families for another country to give them better life gives Ethan & Joy's love story more weight & poignancy. The fact that it mostly shows the usual places Filipino domestic workers would go to in Hong Kong, trying to cram as much details & stories about the OFW experience in without torpedoing the plot, & holding off on the country's tourist spots until it mattered speaks to its priorities. And goddamn this might be Alden Richard's finest performance yet & Kathryn Bernardo is fucking fantastic.Someone in the Third World Cinema Club podcast mentioned that it's fascinating to watch this now, since it was shot before the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. It's like a time capsule from the point of view of Filipinos with the typical Star Cinema sheen.",2020-01-18,positive,0.980148603518804,2

The story focuses on OFW, filipinos working abroad, here Hong Kong, and the tough situation they face a they try and build a better life for themselves and their families, and how romance help ease the desperate situation.

Isa pang kapansin-pansin sa pelikula ay ang supporting actors tulad na lang ni Jameson Blake. (Matatandaang naging kontrobersyal si Jameson dahil sa ""shout-out"" statement na work of art sa Twitter.) Napatunayan naman ni Jameson ang galing niya sa 2 Cool 2 Be 4gotten.

It's something that the viewers can relate to. The only problem is with me cause I kept on comparing it to The Hows of Us which is not really necessary. Dunno what's wrong with me lol.

Hello Love Goodbye,"I cried laughing at some of the cheesiest lines here, they were just too much. But I was surprised at how moving this story is! Their love story feels like a La La Land imitation, but it’s given extra layers in its relation to family and immigration. It’s more complex than the average tearjerker. Alden’s performance is hammy as fuck but it saves the movie from insufferable melodrama. Kathryn Bernardo really makes this movie. I watched this to laugh but I ended up caring.My only major issue is a lot of scenes repeat the same story beats. It’s arguably comical for characters to have the same arguments over and over, but it stagnated portions of the story. I’d say if it were 10-15 min shorter, it would’ve felt more efficient with its time. Gorgeous film though, and worthy of its title as the highest-grossing Filipino film.",2020-05-27,positive,0.8772027611732482,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"Is it wrong if this movie‘s spotlight on Hong Kong makes me romanticise Hong Kong more from the view of a foreigner?The movie poster caught me but the synopsis made me watch it as I am interested in discovering more narratives of domestic helpers. As an Indonesian, I learned a lot more of Filipino words which are surprisingly similar to my language, such as ‘bangon’ and ‘utang’, so that was interesting and made me curious to learn the language. As a woman, I hate the fact that body-shaming was absorbed into a couple of jokes during some scenes, notably Miss Central 2019. As a nobody who is not qualified to give any critics on film but will do it anyway, I would say that this movie centres around the life of one domestic helper which is pretty illustrative but not of the domestic work itself. It disentangles a bunch of issues which may probably be central to some women foreign domestic helpers. If there is anything that I would like to underline is that Joy helps Ethan and not the other way round. If you cannot see something as simple as that then I do not know what else to say except to recommend you watch the movie again. This kind of movies that reinforces the idea that men are allowed to force the love out of a responsible, ambitious, and bright young lady just because that lady is too arrogant to love is just... disgusting. We need to stop praising men for doing the bare minimum and stop romanticising creepy, forced love-lines.",2020-06-14,positive,0.830714225769043,21

I never thought of my mom leaving me in the Philippines when i was younger as something easy. I knew it was hard, i just didn’t know HOW hard. I respect and love my mom so much and knew she did a lot for me but this film made me see things differently. That respect and love blinded me, it never crossed my mind to really think about what she went through and now to think that she did all of that for me fills me with emotions i can’t even begin to explain.

Hello Love Goodbye,"I read somewhere once that flying makes you more prone to crying but I think that even at ground-level, this movie would have made me cry. On the surface, it looks like your typical Filipino romcom. Guy meets girl, one of them dislikes the other initially, the other person is interested and tries to win their affection by being both pabebe yet persistent, a montage ensues, and as much as one party tries to fight it, they eventually fall in love (chAr).I remember seeing the trailer for this sometime last year and wanting to watch it because it looked promising. While the movie does fall trap to some of the cheesiness and tropes (read: Ethan's backstory) that make the aforementioned typical local romcom weak, it manages to bring a depth to its characters, including l Hong Kong itself, that usually escapes mainstream blockbusters.This is exemplified in Joy's character. I've been a Kathryn Bernardo fan since grade school (hello Mara Clara) but this is probably her best performance to date. We are thrown headfirst into the demands of Joy's life and her routine, the pacing of which I really enjoyed. Duty to family, the dichotomy between practicality and passion, and the price of following your dreams take on a new meaning in her situation. You can't help but root for her and (if you're like me) want to throw a shoe at Ethan. The movie never outright asks you for sympathy. Instead, it paints an honest picture of things as they are for so many OFWs in Hong Kong. It leaves the viewer instead to decide how they feel about not just the characters' situations, but also the very systems that birth and perpetuate them. Glad I was finally able to catch it! I didn't manage to finish the whole thing but am hoping to during quarantine",2020-07-05,positive,0.8642724752426147,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"Hmm, sounds like ""Three Words from Forever"". Straightforward as this title is, whatever the complications and heartbreak in Cathy Garcia-Molina's latest romantic tragedy, they can't be any heavier than the story that has to be behind Kathryn Bernardo not playing opposite Daniel Padilla. No, I'm sure their marriage is as annoyingly adorable as ever, especially since this film doesn't set a good tone for them seeing other people, onscreen alone. Bernardo plays a free-spirited domestic worker in Hong Kong, with a diverse network of friends that - don't worry, Filipino conservatives upset about an onscreen couple not being married offscreen - isn't too diverse. She naturally hits it off with a handsome fellow Philippines expat, an ambitious bartender looking to lay some roots down in the city our woman can't wait to get the heck out of. As the two begin to look to their seemingly temporary friendship to help them weather the Hong Kong hustle, it becomes clearer that they have ideas to spend their lives together, and extremely different ideas about how to. As the title plainly tells you, this story won't work out, but it is charming, way to a fault.I mean, this is clearly just another trite and sappy romantic-comedy-drama, of little consequence and even less surprise, with a runtime of two hours. This doesn't want to be ""just another"", as it lives up to its title by methodically examining the process of a potentially doomed romance with the intimacy and draw of a prestige love story. There's more potential on paper than you'd think, but of course it's all hijacked by overwrought rom-com sensibilities, especially with bouncy pacing and gratingly corny, relentless music. Jessie Q. Lasaten's score sucks, and it's just about omnipresent throughout an authentically paced drama to bring out the inauthenticity of its melodramatic situations, frilly farce and general genericism. The script doesn't help with its quirky sense of humor and hearty or histrionic breakthroughs, all cheapening substance that is just full enough to water down that punch-up. That script may only feel obligated to pander to the lowest common denominator, but it sits between the tritest of romantic melodramedies and the most cloying of aesthetics. The average rom-com viewer may also get bored with the runtime, so of course I find more compelling than the average rom-com.There's certainly a unique enough romance in the gorgeous, ever-bustling backdrop of Hong Kong explored extensively as its own character. This scope is more than enough to liven up this intimate love story... but just to be safe, let's overshoot the environment, overwork the editors, and overplay an oppressively corny score. There's nothing refreshing or challenging about this shameless fluff piece, but its themes are a little more grown-up than usual, more frank about the chore of reconciling romantic interests with personal ones. Histories of failures and potentials for success are heavily debated and approached in this two-hour dual-character study, at a methodical clip that may bore certain viewers without the fallback of zanily colorful supporting characters. They bring some laughs, and texture the personalities of lead characters who are spoiled by their own, more mundane humor and quite a few humiliatingly cheesy bearings of soul. Besides that, their motivations and relationship turns are thoroughly, even complexly drawn, and tightened under the solid chops and crisp chemistry of the beautiful Kathryn Bernardo and the handsome Alden Richards. This takes the time to build a genuine human drama, but it's squandered on meager fluff.Between the ready-made claptrap and the meanderingly thoughtful romantic dual-character study, the former pretty much prevails on grating music, style, comedy and melodrama, with enough entertaining sprawl in the lavish Hong Kong setting, more colorful characters and endearing flair, and enough real nuance in the characters, their relationship and the performances, to make Cathy Garcia-Molina's ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" a touchingly heartfelt, just as abrasively disingenuous romantic melodramedy.2.75/5 - Fair",2020-07-12,positive,0.848890063009764,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"Meh. The only thing new about this Star Cinema romance is the ending — it opens the story up to a sequel. Movies of this kind from the movie giant would always end with a definite closure. Perhaps they’re looking forward to another partnership with the actor who was loaned from another network for this movie.The movie was mostly noisy. It had the most noisy and annoying sidekicks ever. They all follow the typical formula of sidekick friends telling the main protagonists what and how to feel. I especially dislike one of the lady friends - the one with the thick Visayan accent. The accent was obviously put on as some form of comedic relief. But it was not funny; it was extremely annoying. No real Visayan talks like that. Alden Richards - it’s my first time watching him in a full-length anything. He works in a TV network that I hate, so I’ve never really seen him act that much. Anyway, I’ve been trying to figure out what’s different about his face. He’s handsome, for sure; but I just couldn’t put a finger on that one thing that’s different until I saw him in this movie. I know it now — he has a very shallow, barely there philtrum! Maybe from the years of wearing braces, his upper lip flattened out?Anyway, Kathryn was good. Almost made me cry again in one scene. But then Alden spoke, so there. Don’t get me wrong; I don’t hate the boy. I was just really so intent in observing him in his every scene, trying to figure out his face situation.What I would change about this movie: Get rid of all those annoying sidekicks.

She does those kinds of scenes really well in any film.Ethan, on the other hand, was a bad character and Richards was not able to make it any better.I hated how they had to used “Anak” to emphasize the struggles of OFWs. Maganda na sana. I thought for a moment that it was a good take on the lives of DH. It just went a little overboard.Overall, I wish I just watched it the first time I thought of doing so.

Hello Love Goodbye,"With unrelenting chemistry and superb acting from its two leads, ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" turns out to be an outstanding romance drama film experience. Against the backdrop and introspective of our country's modern day heroes, the OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers) specifically domestic helpers in Hong Kong, the film was able to bank on even more emotions than expected.Life in Hong Kong is not easy more so for the domestic helpers who are unable to improve their lives even if they wanted to. One of these domestic helpers is Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) who has wants to leave Hong Kong and find a better life in Canada as a nurse. But unfortunate circumstances have prevented her from attaining this life-long dream. Ethan (Alden Richards) is a bartender and has a few years left before he can be a permanent resident in Hong Kong. Both meet one fateful night and while they do not fall instantly in love, Ethan's persistence eventually wins Joy's heart. But their polar opposite circumstances and dreams will make the decision to continue with their relationship a difficult one to make.""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" does enough to make it one of the better romance drama films we have seen. How it accomplishes this is by pretty much making outstanding work on the basics. First and foremost, the central characters of Ethan and Joy were well-written and well-scripted. Both characters had deep-seeded personal issues that were not only central to the film's main conflict but grounded and believable. The script was mostly great having its fair share of emotional one-liners and witty banters but we have to admit, it went a little too cheesy in some scenes. Beyond that, both characters had great actors and performances behind them that gave these characters much life and much justice. Additionally, the main narrative was well-written. It felt fresh and had a lot of unexpected twists, turns, and surprises along the way. The ending was satisfying without spoiling much. It also presented a basic look into the stark reality of the OFW domestic helpers in Hong Kong. However, we felt that the film failed to establish more emotions on this introspective. While it had some unnerving revelations about the domestic helper life, most of these have been tackled better in other films previously. What surprised us most though if the film's cinematography. It's a given that Hong Kong is a beautiful city to begin with but the camera work here impressed us. Overall, ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" is a great romance drama film worth your time and one heck of a dramatic film at its core.Source: www.reeladvice.net/2019/09/hello-love-goodbye-movie-review.html",2019-09-01,positive,0.9228571710132417,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"The film had a lot of technical flaws and passé comedy injected into it (fat jokes in 2019? really cathy?). It would have worked better if it hadn't been for the half-baked (arguably unnecessary) romance plot but who are we kidding? This is Star Cinema.However, very un-Star Cinema-esque is its approach to the struggle of our OFWs and I respect it for that. Joy's character is solid and human, the driving force of the film despite the cringey corniness of her ""romance"". Kathryn deserves all the praise and her chemistry with Alden was surprising, especially in the early days of their ~love story~. The only real gripe I have against this film is how severely underdeveloped Ethan's character was. He didn't deserve the quotation markable dialogue in the end, because he learned so little even when the lesson was staring right at him.Overall, I loved Joy's story. It separates itself from the usual martyrdom leading ladies in romantic films usually take on.",2020-12-25,positive,0.8462315574288368,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"It's the bothering solitude of my Christmas eve evening that led me to watch this. Kathryn surely deserved that acting award for this film because she single-handedly carried it. Alden too carried for some parts but then again I can't say that much for a character I didn't like. The plot about OFWs hurts because it's honest but the way it's written is loose especially Ethan's backstory. Cannot pity a guy like him. They had a chance na rin naman to showcase Hong Kong as a place na shithole for domestic helpers or a tourist area pero parang di ko naman masyado nakita sa film. Screw the drone shots as well.Also the script, god, the script! I speak in Taglish rin naman but their dialogues are really fictional because if you talk like that in real life then I am actually judging you. Scoring bothered me too because I like the silence of films especially kapag mabigat na yung batuhan. Sorry to the music director but I will not feel anything kapag nilapatan niyo ng overplayed song yan; why can't we just compose new soundtracks for new films? In summary, I give licenses to Kathryn & Alden's fans by presenting this film as proof for their acting calibre then I will snatch it back once they start speaking how good it was.",2020-12-24,negative,0.796860088001598,-1

Buti okay bumato ng linya si Kathryn but not even that can hide the fact na hindi maganda yung script. 5. Yung character ni Alden only works in movies. That's a creep irl.6. Uhh wala akong nakuhang value sa mga eksena kasama ng mga kaibigan niya (Kakai, Maymay, etc.). Or baka di lang kasi maganda yung script at yung OA na acting nila. 7.

Hello Love Goodbye,"For a Star Cinema fare, the best thing this film does is to finally not force a happy ending to please its target audience. That was my biggest issue with Cathy-Grace Molina’s previous film, The Hows of Us — resolving all conflicts in order to reach a happy ending that feels fake.Make no mistake, this film is also boggled down by the same trite and cheesy writing (Making Kath’s and Alden’s character an official couple is so forced), overblown musical score, and emotionally manipulative sequences that have plagued the quality of Star Cinema films for the past few years.However, this film is effective as a drama that talks about Filipino Diaspora. It even takes away the usually bright gloss aesthetic of a Star Cinema film; which I loved. There’s a sense of realism at play.It shines at moments when it doesn’t delve on the romance, but on the struggles faced by Filipinos working abroad. When we are shown how these Filipinos find ways to cope up and form a stronger bond as a community of overseas workers — the film is at its most human.Past its flaws, the film is something I appreciated. It’s a semi-fresh take that is just a bit uneven.",2020-12-26,positive,0.910510371128718,0

Hello Love Goodbye,"**Watched this for class, and we talked about the rift between mainstream and independent cinema in the Philippines.**The opening sequence of Hello, Love, Goodbye (2019) is almost exactly the same as the first few minutes of Sid & Aya: Not a Love Story (2018), as it makes use of a montage of the scenes to come, all while Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) describes Hong Kong, and her life, and how she perceives love. Again, similarly with Sid & Aya, the first part only follows Joy as she lives her life as a domestic helper, then it pulls the ""then it all changed"" cliché when Ethan (Alden Richards) comes in and pulls out some weird and cringe-y pick up lines to woo her (And funny enough, just like Sid & Aya, the woman has little to no interest in the man). This film almost masquerades as the usual mainstream Filipino romance, with its structure and overall production. It has invisible editing, clear visuals, and an upfront and chronological structure (with exception to the first flash forward montage and a few flashbacks). But where Hello, Love, Goodbye diverts from the ""usual"" is in the complexity of its characters' struggles as its plot progresses. Joy is ""lost potential,"" with the film implying that she was an excellent college graduate. She is almost drowning in responsibilities as a domestic helper, but continues to hustle harder and harder to provide for her family, and to keep her fading dreams alive. Ethan is a hotshot bartender who is secretly full of regret, as he previously left his whole life behind just to chase a girl he desperately loved. Joy and Ethan's dynamic starts out weird, but their love reluctantly grows as Joy comes closer to her dreams and as Ethan slowly comes to terms with his past. Towards the end, as Joy and Ethan are arguing about their future, and what love means to them. Alden Richards and Kathryn Bernardo's performances are strong and passionate in the later acts (despite some very mushy lines here and there), and perhaps this is where the artistry of the independent film lies. Their performances and their lines are the things I pondered about long after the credits rolled.This film definitely leans more towards the mainstream cinema. The mainstream elements significantly outweigh its ""indie"" elements. But, it has a certain depth and profoundness in the messages it delivers to its audience thanks to its good writing and performances. It's far from a perfect film, or a film that I would consider a modern classic, but I can definitely see this being enjoyed by a lot of different filmgoers with different tastes, as it does have a little something for everyone. And because of all these, it's clear to see why this is currently the highest grossing film produced in the Philippines.",2021-01-04,positive,0.9038332663476467,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"""The time stops when you don't use it."" There's a single aspect in Hello, Love, Goodbye that makes it truly worth watching—its fairly authentic portrayal of the collective plights of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW). As a former OFW's kid, this one definitely hits home, and it's pretty much the same feeling I had when I watched Sunday Beauty Queen. I have heard a lot of stories about their struggles abroad including from my mom and dad. The moment Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) shouted ""I love you all pero 'tangina, pa'no naman ako?"" was pretty reminiscent to that of my mom's sentiments about her experience when she was feeling down while at work. It's really sad, and this one spoke so much to me. And so, I'm gonna give this film a point for that. However, other than the things mentioned earlier, everything ranges from being dull to borderline decent. I have to commend Bernardo's very emotional portrayal of a very emotional character. She eventually ended up carrying the entire film, while Alden Richards, despite being constantly labeled among fans and critics for slightly stepping up his game, seemed a little stale. The chemistry was there, but it didn't really hold up in the long run. I also have to acknowledge how problematic the start of their romance was. See it for yourself then. Moreover, the film still succumbs to clichéd tropes we usually encounter in Filipino romantic films, not to mention the terrible use of music just to evoke emotions that would only work for, dare I say it, wild fans. It's nothing new, so I had to endure it.Hello, Love, Goodbye would have been a huge knockout had it been focusing on Joy's story arc. It's the only thing in the film that I was fully invested in. How it treated the romance aspect was decent at best, but its establishment damaged the film tremendously. Gosh, it could have been so much better, really.",2021-01-12,positive,0.8612428938641268,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"This is the highest-grossing Filipino film ever made, and I literally can't believe it. It’s impossible. Not because it's a bad movie, but because it's so depressing. It’d be like if Terms of Endearment were America's.Like on one level it makes some sense: it’s about two attractive young people who meet and fall in love in an exotic locale, and they’re played by two huge movie stars. Pretty easy to see how that gets butts in the seat! But....It’s so bleak. Their lives are so unpleasant. Both are Overseas Filipino Workers stuck in immigration traps in Hong Kong, forced to submit to exploitation in order to retain proper status (one especially tragic scene has a Filipino who's working as a nanny beg her employer to keep her on at half pay because losing the job means getting deported back to the Philippines....and this is a college-educated worker with dreams of being a nurse). Our heroine’s mother gets beaten by her (foreign) husband whom she despises, but has to stay with him for another few months to become a resident (and then the rest of her family--who were left behind in the Philippines--can join her).The driving force of the movie is essentially how these punitive immigration rules ruin their chance at true love and happiness. It’s a necessary (and timely) topic, and it’s handled with great care, but...highest-grossing film ever? Ahead of The Avengers?!?!?",2021-01-25,negative,0.7901969497854059,2

Tama bang 'bilin' ng lalake yung oras niya, para maguilt-trip siya na sumama dito?

She did the best she could with that script, with that roller coaster showcase of emotion she had to show as her character. I really didn’t like anyone else’s acting. Kathryn with the unrealistic, too corny words that’s given to her is at the very least didn’t feel like she played her character, she IS her character, it feels like i’m watching a person even if the things she says are too cliché for a person’s mouth. Everyone else’s acting felt like acting, it feels like i’m watching someone who’s PLAYING a person, trying to show a person, exaggerated, corny adding to the unrealism.

Hello Love Goodbye,"A surprisingly affecting romantic drama about the large community of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong. This is something that has been recently explored as a more heart warming drama with Oliver Siu Kuen Chan and Anthony Wong's excellent Still Human, however here we have a similar situation but shown almost entirely from the Filipino workers perspective and with a significant romantic plot.Through central character Joy, who wants to be a nurse, but is forced into the domestic helper lifestyle like her mother, it looks at the difficulties and exploitation inherent in these worker's arrangements. Paid a pittance, and treated appallingly by their employers and the state, this film examines how they can be trapped into this existence and life, allowing them to send a bit of money home to family in the Philippines that they only speak to via video calls, promising a reunion that will never happen.There's an excellent movie in here, but the film stumbles significantly when introducing Joy's love interest, barman Ethan. While it may appear like this film is going to be a standard romantic comedy, it's not really, and Ethan's initial characterisation is straight out of a lunatic American rom-com. After being introduced by pretending to be immigration police and arresting Joy, he's harassing and calling her constantly, that even within the constraints of a romantic comedy (which this isn't!), he's basically a stalker.It's a shame that the film goes down this initial cliched route, after introducing Ethan's character for the next twenty minutes, because at it's core, and once Ethan stops behaving like a lunatic, it's a genuinely tender and quite tragic film about a doomed romance, and about how Filipino immigrants to Hong Kong are never made to feel part of society. The films portrayal of both Ethan's father and Joy's parents is well done, and very sympathetic, which makes it more frustrating that they wasted so much time with Ethan's initial character, when they could have skipped that and presented him as he appears for the last hour of the film.It's filmed on the streets and alleys of Hong Kong, and all extremely recognisable and vivid, clearly made by someone who understands the areas, full of classic ""oh yeah, I know where they are"" moments.Surprisingly bittersweet ending too. This is mostly an excellent film, that's dragged down unnecessarily by the initial appearance of Ethan - made even more frustrating that they roll that characterisation back. Still, definitely worth my time, and a lot better than I expected (but it could have been just that bit better).",2021-04-16,positive,0.8941831663250923,2

It made me angry how a lot of our Filipino people are struggling to find means of income, often juggling 2-3 jobs that cause them to overwork themselves.

Hello Love Goodbye,"5.5/10For me, it’s a very typical Pinoy romance you’d expect from Star Cinema, so I won’t really go into the quality and narrative of the film. What always fascinated me was how this stands as the highest grossing film of all time in the Philippines. Having an OFW-centred story would definitely play a huge role in this benchmark, since the OFW struggle is a very real experience among working class Filipinos. There’s a whole history behind OFW films that I’d love to look into further while I’m still studying Honours.It was also jarring to have watched this after seeing two Wong Kar Wai films these past few days — I say this because this film is set in Hong Kong. So for me, it felt like an interesting exercise in comparing both localised and transcultural portrayals of a country. I don’t really have a right to comment on the way Cathy portrays Hong Kong people, or whether or not this captures an “authentic” Hong Kong experience outside the OFW life, but this is also something I’d like to scrutinise more closely.I think I can get behind why people would see this as above average, and despite it being an average experience for me, I appreciate the film for what it is. I would love to write further about the film’s OFW narrative and transcultural elements, as they are both integral to shaping Philippine cinema as a globalised medium.(PS: watching Kathryn Bernardo sing badly has been the most cathartic thing I’ve seen all year)",2021-06-13,positive,0.899589615208762,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"Cathy Garcia-Molina departs from rom-coms in a touching tale of sacrifice and love in a city far from home.Leave to pursue your dreams, or stay for the love of your life? This is the question that Hello, Love, Goodbye asks us. This latest offering from Cathy Garcia-Molina, best known for her Filipino romantic comedies, is set in Hong Kong. Molina sheds light on the experiences of Filipinos working overseas by following the story of Joy and Ethan, two Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). We see their lives unfold through the eyes of Joy, a hardworking domestic helper who’s trying to save money to move to Canada as a nurse, and Ethan, a bartender trying to find his motivation in life.Hello, Love, Goodbye stars two of the Philippines’ biggest names from the two of the biggest “loveteams”—Kathryn Bernardo (from KathNiel) and Alden Richards (from AlDub). What’s also surprising is that Bernado and Richards are from rival television networks; in the Philippines, it’s common for actors to be signed to one network exclusively. Their performance in Hello, Love, Goodbye proves that once in a while, it doesn’t hurt to break out of your loveteam to grow as an artist. An Empathetic, Authentic PerformanceIn Hello Love, Goodbye, Bernado graduates from her teen roles and blossoms into a dramatic actress—a total transformation from her child acting days—in a tour de force performance. Richards rises to the challenge and exhibits his versatility as an actor, proving why he’s one of the country’s matinee idols.To get into their roles, Bernardo was separated from the cast to better empathize with Joy’s feelings of isolation; after just a week of filming in Hong Kong, she wanted to go back to the Philippines. Richards, on the other hand, lost almost 25 kg to play Ethan. Molina is notorious for her strictness with the artists that she works with—but it’s paid off as they are all household names, and her films have been blockbuster hits.Hello, Love, Goodbye’s love story is not new, yet it provides us with a unique perspective of the realities of being an overseas worker. The film tears away the layers of the OFW experience with sheer intensity. Shifting away from showing the employee-employer relationship found in other films about OFWs, Molina brings her focus to the OFWs themselves, and their families back home.The film strips down the glamor of Hong Kong, as we follow Joy waking up at 5am every day, hustling through the crowded streets of Hong Kong—away from her family, never catching a dream. She sits down on top of cardboard boxes on Sundays in Central and juggles taking care of her employer’s daughter and grandmother while selling power banks as a side job (which is actually illegal). Molina blends drama and clarity in portraying these hardships, and most importantly, tells the “whys.”The Burden of Responsibility“If you stop, you’ll starve”—that’s the reason why.Joy, and thousands of other OFWs, endure these hardships to provide for their family back home—a message that the film strongly reinforces. We watch as Joy’s friend reminds her cousin to be smart with her money so she can have enough to send back to the Philippines, as the same friend tells her father that she’ll stay two more years because they need the money.Domestic helpers only earn as little as HK$4,520 (US$576) per month, while working long hours. In Joy’s words, if you stop working, your family will starve. Making sacrifices is almost always a given—a harsh reality if you’re an OFW because you have a responsibility to your family back home. This responsibility that Joy carries is one that resonates with many other OFWs.But OFWs carry out this responsibility at what expense?Similar to Still Human, which also featured a Filipino domestic helper, Joy has a degree in nursing. In fact, nursing is a common degree among Filipinos with the hope of working overseas for better pay than what they can get back home. As it turns out, nursing is actually the dream that Joy wants to pursue, and being a domestic helper is just a stepping stone to that goal.Then Ethan comes into the picture. While a movie following the plight of domestic helpers and OFWs doesn’t really need a romance story, the love story still has a purpose. Ethan’s character contrasts with Joy’s. While Joy is hardworking, determined, and knows what she wants in life, Ethan is a happy-go-lucky guy who jumps from one relationship to the next and doesn’t know what he wants in life. But his character’s free-wheeling life also echoes Joy’s self-questioning of whether choosing ourselves over our family makes us a disappointment, or selfish.Joy laments the lack of choice she has in life. As the family’s breadwinner, her family doesn’t know what she has to endure on a daily basis. A nursing graduate that cleans the toilet and eats leftover food—“I’m more than this job, I’m more, and I want to be more,” Joy says.Surely, this sentiment reflects the many dreams of other overseas Filipino workers. They have dreams but they also have responsibilities that hold them back. Joy and Ethan’s romance show the heavy burdens and choices OFWs face on a daily basis. Even something as minor as buying a snack or not is difficult, because every dollar spent is a dollar you could have saved to give back to your family.Dreams vs. LoveA common Filipino phrase, “libre lang mangarap,” tells us “it’s free to dream”. But Joy and Ethan realize, as they try to make their love work, that dreams aren’t free. When you make a choice, you give up something.Joy and Ethan’s mutual romance story mirrors the same sentiments that their individual stories have: choices, responsibilities, and dreams. Perhaps that’s the reason why the romance element works against the backdrop of an OFW story. In this sense, Hello, Love, Goodbye isn’t just a love story, nor is it just an OFW story—it’s a story about finding yourself, and loving yourself in the process. This universal message is something that will strike a chord with audiences.Hello, Love, Goodbye‘s message is simple: give yourself the chance to do what you want, get back up from disappointments, be courageous enough to love and choose whether you want to leave or stay. The film doesn’t portray Bernardo and Alden as people to pity—it portrays them as human beings, with stories and experiences that empower them to ultimately choose how to pave their own way for their futures—with or without each other.",2021-06-27,positive,0.9032546507345663,9

I like da storyline, da acting, direction, ewan ko ano pa ba inaanalyze pero sa mga aspect na may pake ako ok naman.

Even then, I felt most of the time we were being kept at arms’ length from the characters; close, intimate shots were so rarely used. I like its very mature approach to relationships, though, and by echoing the ending of the sparer, more eloquent Endo, it illuminated the ending of that movie for me, showing that by not pursuing his love before she’s ready, the guy is showing commitment and hope, a willingness to wait. It showed his character had grown, also it’s something anyone who wants to get somewhere in life needs these days, so it’s good that Filipino films are promoting this value!",2021-09-10,positive,0.9390064179897308,0

With the new pairing I took some time to get into the mood. All my Filipino friends confirmed to me that the portrayal OFWs is indeed a very accurate one. It was indeed frustrating to watch the everyday struggle and hard work of educated young people in minor jobs to support their family. Nowadays it belongs to the normality to support their families through migration. It’s indeed a very depressing atmosphere and all the problems and concerns were well portrayed by Katheryn Bernardo in this movie. She did an amazing job as usual. But this time the melodramatic vibe really flashed me. Same for Alden Richards. I have to admit that I had my doubts to see Katheryn in a movie without Daniel but all my concerns were for nothing. The whole superstar casting and the successful capture of the OFWs situation makes this movie captivating. I really enjoyed the realistic view and the reality that hits the viewer in every scene. The survival and emotional struggle is detailed pictured and I really loved it that the characters stay true to themselves, no matter how hard is life.To be honest, the depressing reality clash were indeed very much needed and an eye opener for a foreign audience.

Like if you go out on the streets and ask an ordinary Pinoy any director they know, high chance that you’ll hear Cathy Garcia-Molina, Joyce Bernal, Antoinette Jadaone, which is the exact opposite in the international scene where names like Lav Diaz (deserved tho), Brillante Mendoza, or Erik Matti are more recognized (well Isabel Sandoval too but just referring to the ones based in PH).Well, at least female directors are popular amongst the locals haha (unlike in other countries where the local and international scene are still heavily dominated by male directors). Anyways, overall I still enjoyed this but istg we really need tighter storylines and perhaps bigger budget for these mainstream movies lmao.",2021-12-11,positive,0.8966205499388955,5

Hello Love Goodbye,"Sorry talaga, direk Cathy kasi I first watched this on my laptop thru a Google Drive link. Now I saw this on TV. Ganda pa rin. Kathryn Bernardo has really improved, her performance here aged well. You can feel her heartache, longing, and regret through her eyes and body language. She really did well in portraying the struggle of our Filipina DHs.Hong Kong, so close yet so far. It's a colonial outpost that serves as a microcosm of global labor relations: tired, underpaid, overworked, yet cheerful, patient Third World women on its busy shopping streets facing their haughty, cruel, and privileged Cantonese bosses who pride themselves in their neocolonial, Anglo-Saxon upbringing. The story is really familiar to me. I saw how many women in my family worked abroad (and some in HK) and faced such hardships to provide for their own families here. I hate how Filipinos are conditioned and trained to be machines for labor export. I hope the Philippine Revolution finally succeeds soon.",2021-12-26,positive,0.8705747344277122,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"This is one of the best films of Modern FIlipino cinema I would say especially in the field of mainstream media. It's no surprise that the film is the highest grossing in the Philippines. I like how Joy's character and how she narrates the film through her eyes. I like how she's not ashamed to tell her job to one of her friends. I like how she's so candid in trying to keep herself whole amidst the things that try to crumble her into broken pieces. I like how she well portrays how awful and difficult it is for people like her to be steps closer in attaining her goals. This is one of Kath's best roles to date. I also like how Ethan made it a bit difficult for her to leave Hong Kong after falling into each other's intentions and vulnerabilities. What's a bit problematic though is Ethan's character especially in the beginning. It could be a little offsetting if it were to be done to girls in real life with him being a bit pushy when a girl you like is already gate keeping herself from you. But it's good that there was some character development from him going halfway through the film. It's nice he understand Joy has big plans to fulfill and he trusts they'll be together in time.Love is really the most complicated thing. It makes you question if your own dreams are really worth giving up if you can have another one with the person you love. It makes you question what road God has paved to you. But in the end you'll realize that your destiny is what your freewill desires anyway. If dreams are worth fighting for, love can find a way to be a part of it in the end.",2022-01-19,positive,0.9250954017043114,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"""Isn't that how its supposed to be? When you love, all or nothing. If you hold back, then why love at all?""Hello, Love, Goodbye is my first Filipino film! I've been looking forward to this one for a while. I gotta say though, I think I prefer Wong Kar Wai's portrayal of Hong Kong to Cathy Garcia-Molina's. Hello, Love, Goodbye tells a very standard love story that's been done numerous times before, and better. A couple meets for a short amount of time in a foreign country, and then are parted by time. This film is incredibly soap-opera esque, and there are a lot of scenes with heavy over-acting and some delicious scenery chewing. The audio mixing is also all over the place. The actors can usually be heard fine, but sometimes the music drowns out what they are saying during important scenes. Some of the dialogue is also really unintentionally hilarious, like the scene where a character is berated for opening a bar instead of becoming a doctor or store manager. No offense to anyone out there, but I would probably be more impressed with someone who opened their own restaurant than someone who manages a Walgreens The pacing is also all over the place, and the film is way too long for what its trying to accomplish. There are some genuinely sweet moments hidden amidst the saccharine sea that is Hello, Love, Goodbye, but I couldn't help but feel that this movie is frighteningly similar to those ""inspirational/romantic"" YouTube videos that get roasted from time to time.If you're looking for a light, modern-pop romance film, you could do a lot worse than Hello, Love, Goodbye. It's silly, but sincere. I personally struggled to care about this movie strongly, but I promise there are some really nice moments scattered throughout. I think there is a really good movie buried in here, but it'll take some work to unearth it.",2022-01-31,positive,0.8868002071976662,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"March Around The World 2022 (7/30)I, for some reason, thought this was a bog standard cheesy rom-com, and I put it on my potential watch list for this challenge because I knew I had some others with kind of heavy subject matter and wanted a few lighter options in the mix too. Cut to 20 minutes from the end and I am sobbing, SOBBING! Not what I was expecting at all. I'll be honest, Ethan's initial pursuit of Joy is maybe questionable, and judging by the most popular review for this film, a lot of people could not see past that, which is a shame, I think. Once the characters actually connect properly this is a really sweet and lovely romance. And as much time as that romance does take up, it's not at the expense of Joy as a character. She is always at the centre of this story, which is about so much more than a really quite cute love story. I wasn't familiar at all with the cultural setting here, but I think there's enough context for everything that it's very easy to understand the employment situations, as well as the family commitments, and all the stress and pressure that comes with that. Joy and Ethan's situations are different but they're a result of the same social, economic and familial restrictions/obligations, and these things hang over their romance the whole time, which adds a layer of urgency and also sadness to them both. There's a scene pretty early on with Joy on a bus, and she bumps into an old college friend, there on his honeymoon, and it's just devastating. I knew at that point this wasn't the film I was expecting it to be. Kathryn Bernardo is quietly heartbreaking in that scene, and she really does centre this entire film. And later when she realises that she's been working towards an unattainable goal for her family, and now she finally gets to have a choice of what happens to her but it's not as simple as she hoped it might be, I was so invested in her that my heart was simultaneously soaring for her, while also breaking. There's one or two little things in here that keep it from being 5 stars, but if you can see past Ethan's somewhat questionable initial pursuit of Joy then there's a really beautiful film here.",2022-03-12,positive,0.9344150977475303,-1

I didn’t feel a single shred of compatibility between Alden Richards and Kathryn Bernardo, despite Bernardo being a memorable actress.

Hello Love Goodbye,"I think ito na ang extent ng pagiging experimental ng Star Cinema, lol.First and foremost, Kathryn Bernardo proved once again that she can evoke whatever emotion she wants from her audience. She acts with her eyes, body language, speech tone, just overflowing with passion! Nakakadala ang performance niya!I don't quite get why every single major family in the film had a member who had some sory of disability. It didn't really contribute anything to the story's development nor was it even explored through dialogue. It felt like an easy excuse to elicit sympathy from the viewers, which is problematic as PWDs have been forever subject to being accessorized in films and tv.Wasn't a fan of Alden's character. Too shallow imo. However, Alden himself did a great job in matching Kathryn's splendid acting! He was decent enough to keep me engaged.Played it safe on the ending. Of course, it had to have even a tinge of a happy ending because it is a mainstream film and lots of Filipinos consider a film bad if it doesn't have a light or a positive-leaning ending. It was building up nicely to an emotional climax but the moment Joy and Ethan had that confrontation scene, everything that followed felt like an attempt to repair the sad atmosphere that it produced. I wish the film maximized that misery and took a full-on drama end. Maybe then it would have more impact.Technicalities were subpar. The film did not look aesthetically pleasing most of the time. Perhaps it wanted to portray the gritty experience of living as a DH in HK, but it could have been better. Score utterly sucked. The audience does not need to hear a full track while the scenes transpire. This is not a music video.Tolerable, for sure. Kathryn carried it.",2022-06-02,positive,0.8559714555740356,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"""The time stops when you don't use it.""A heartfelt romantic comedy drama set in Hong Kong following the story of Joy and Ethan, two filipino immigrants. Its not a new story, but it blends the hardships, sacrifice, dreams, love & realities of a overseas domestic worker quite empathetically. The pairing of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards was so charming & sweet.Hello, Love, Goodbye‘s message is simple: give yourself the chance to do what you want, get back up from disappointments, be courageous enough to love and choose whether you want to leave or stay. The film doesn’t portray Bernardo and Alden as some people who need your pity—but rather portrays the characters humanely, with stories and experiences that empower them to ultimately choose how to pave their own way for their futures—with or without each other. A warm satisfying drama.(ending made me ugly cry lol)Alden Richards<333333333333",2022-06-26,positive,0.9870941638946533,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"I think I've watched this in cinema. Got sad how Kathryn's willing to give everything for her family ay sarili na niyang present at future ang nag suffer. Wala namang masama doon pero somehow kasi naging abusive na 'yung siblings niya and it's bold of them to request unnecessary expensive things knowing na mahirap trabaho ng ate nila abroad at alam nilang nag-iipon siya. Also, duh college students na sila, marunong na 'yan mag-isip. This film portrayed how difficult to be an OFW. You wake up, work, sleep, give money to relatives, repeat. ""Sinisikmura para sa pangarap"". I think this film would have a better ending if it's just focused on Kathryn, no Alden lol.

Hello Love Goodbye,"This film emanates comfort, uncertainty, and self-worth. And that is what Philippine cinema should put out not hundreds of generic cringy-ass rom-com films. Joy, a struggling Filipino DH, who has specific dreams for herself and her family meets Ethan who doesn't exactly know what he wants. A literal manifestation of the 'Grumpy x Sunshine' trope, and I'm here for it. Joy finds comfort in Ethan, even if she isn't exactly looking for a relationship.Amid their emerging relationship, Ethan finds himself filled with uncertainty as his time with Joy comes close to its end. He deeply hopes that Joy will change her mind as he planned everything out for their future. But this is where it gets tricky, Joy has already made up her mind, from the start. She knows what she wants, even Ethan can't change her mind. And I support and understand her. All her life, she has put her family first, and this time she needs to prioritize herself. Ethan does not deserve Joy's half-self if she even chooses to stay, cause she will always have 'what ifs' and that would also be unfair for Ethan.In simple terms, Joy needs to find herself. To feel that she is her own person. Only then will she be able to give herself committedly to Ethan, and he understood that in the end.This is when two persons respect each other's dreams and are both willing to let go of each other to grow individually and come back when they're both ready.Alden & Kath > Kathniel, I still stand by this.",2022-07-30,positive,0.9331707954406738,7

Seenggaknya menurutku.Kathryn Bernardo di sini bener-bener mirip Ayu Ting-Ting. Eh, nggak. Yang bener Kathryn Bernardo di sini bener-bener berpenampilan cewek biasa-biasa aja, yang masuk ke karakternya. Di sini dia berperan jadi Joy, lulusan S1 yang kesulitan dapat kerja. Dia ngerantau ke Hongkong, berpikiran mau kerja apa aja yang penting dapat uang. Karena mau hijrah ke Kanada jadi perawat dan ngeboyong keluarganya hidup sejahtera di sana. Dia nggak ada waktu buat senang-senang, termasuk buat cinta-cintaan. Kerja kerja kerja mulu. Sampai akhirnya ada cowok datang ke dalam hidupnya, pengen deketin dia tapi dia nggak mau nggak mau nggak mau. Nggak bermaksud jual mahal, tapi dia memang nggak punya waktu buat pacaran.Aku suka film ini. Aku tau rasanya jadi Joy, terutama pas dia yang kerja sama orang Hongkong. Aku pernah kerja sama orang Chinese dan keras sih dunia kerjanya. Simple-nya mereka ngomong kayak marah-marah padahal sebenarnya ngomong biasa aja. Ketika ngelakuin kesalahan kecil, mereka bisa marahnya gedeeeeee banget. Aku nggak bermaksud rasis lho ini ya.Interaksinya Joy dan si cowok di mana si cowok nggak gentar deketin. Disuruh pergi ajaaaa nggak pengen pacaran ya bebal tetap aja dekat, ngingatin aku sama ayangku. Dulu dia juga gitu ke aku, ketika aku malasssss banget buat pacaran karena nggak mau sakit hati lagi buang-buang waktu bikin aku selama ini nggak produktif, dia tetap aja maju.Aku mau fokus kerja aja, karena ketika aku galau karena pacar ya bisa ambyar kerjaanku.

I think I found my most favorite Cathy Garcia Molina movie. This is her best work. And Kathryn, wow! I think I found a new respect to you as an actor.Some of my favorites:1. Cinematography - grabe ang ganda ng pag capture sa Hong Kong and how it tells the story of our domestic helpers2. The setting helped in the storytelling, hindi lang siya background. 3. JOY AND HER CHOICE AS A WOMAN - galit talaga ako sa mga babaeng character sa pelikula ni CGM but Joy gave me so much joy. How she insisted that she needs to decide for herself and her happiness. This is cinema! Chos. Add the scene where the character of Cacai asked the question about women being selfish when she choose herself!Mga not so favorite:- Fat jokes! Talaga ba?- The neverending family struggle. I guess it will not be a star cinema movie if there's no conflict with the family. Kaya nga hindi na resolve na domestic abuse victim ang nanay ni Joy. Because there's too many family drama!!! - Medyo makulit si Ethan when he courted JoyOverall, this was really a great movie.

Hello Love Goodbye,"Cathy Garcia-Molina has setback my generation of Filipinos as well as our cinema  A few notes I took during the movie:- Off-putting editing, too many random cuts, does not allow shots to breathe as well as having unnecessary ones.- Random foreigner actors? Lousy English dialogue.- Suspense was ruined in one scene that was the same as shown in beginning. Legit ruined the character reveal.- Kathryn Bernardo’s acting performance was respectable and well done. First half of the movie made me lose my mind and would have end up giving this film a 2 star or below if it continued. Second half made up for it, it kind of got me in my feels.Overall, I can understand why people enjoy this film, but if it’s the dominating genre in my country, we are doomed.+ highest-grossing local film of all-time in the Philippines?!FALSE IMAGERY OF LOVE WILL RUIN MY GENERATION!*note: I am half-serious.",2022-11-16,negative,0.7569602608680726,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"A story in two layers. The first is with Joy and her experiences as a Filipino overseas domestic helper living in Hong Kong. We not only delve into her journey of wanting a better life for her and her family, but we also get a glimpse of this particular subculture of Filipinos living in Hong Kong, who have carved out a little community for themselves away from their home. Between poor pay, long hours of work, and shuffling through countless jobs and hustles to make ends meet, seeing these workers come together to host their own makeshift beauty pageant, or weeping together as they're watching Filipino dramas on someone's phone while they're in the middle of illegally peddling retail, it's those small moments of solidarity that adds a charming touch. It adds an extra dimension to this life that isn't just all doom, gloom, and abuse (and sadly there's a lot of it) to make you sympathize with their struggle.The second layer is a Wattpad fueled, Twilight charged romance full of the same toxic tropes with the weird stalking and complete disregard for boundaries. They made sure to make Ethan seem like such a bad boy who can get any woman he wants (and they display this by his friends joking around about how all his flings are named after a day in the week), yet he drops them all for Joy because...I don't know actually. Maybe it's at this crucible where a bachelor--who has no reason to like a woman who doesn't come from money--suddenly becoming obsessed with her that people find truly romantic, but then he admits to later gaslighting and manipulating her the entire time towards the end (but he did it for love!).That cute montage of them taking selfies all over iconic landmarks in Hong Kong while a Filipino ballad lulls in the background, is supposed to ignite lots of warm feelings in the belly, but for those who didn't buy into this relationship, can feel misplaced. The only part of the romance I liked were Joy and Ethan's friends cheering their relationship on. Others may see them as one dimensional who act as nothing but cheerleaders, but these Filipino romances know how to make really damn great cheerleading supporting characters that makes you wish you had them in your life. Now if only these male leads can actually be decent guys for once.",2023-02-15,positive,0.9047067999839783,2
Hello Love Goodbye,"There's something deeply depressing about stumbling across a boy you loved in the past inside a crowded train, who's there with his pregnant wife. And having to tell him ""I ended up like my mother after all.""This movie started out so strong, but as it began to focus on their love story I just couldn't bring myself to be invested in it. The male lead was honestly immature and did not carry as much depth as the female MC. And I kept wanting to explore more of her history and depth. I honestly wish the movie was longer, enough that we could see her family, friends and their stories more. They clearly have their own stories that are reminiscent of all the Non-chinese hongkongers who sacrifice everything to suffer in a foreign nation for money. The opening montage is so good and reminded of Kimi No Nawa's.And I loved that I could trace the geography of my country in this movie.

Like yung buong film, sa Hong Kong. Mapwera lang dun sa scenes sa bahay nila Kathryn which is sobrang minimal. Third, naramdaman ko. Mas madaling hanapan ng simpatya yung mga characters ni Joy at Ethan. Mga nagsusumikap para sa pamilya, mga nagpupursiging matupad pangarap nila, mga nagmamahal pero may tamang limitations.

Hello Love Goodbye,"In all honesty, this could have been better if the film focused more on the struggles and reality of becoming a domestic helper in HongKong rather than the romance of the two characters. Ethan, the male lead, was so infuriating at times during the movie. He only had his redemption arc at the last 14 minutes of the movie. Joy, on the other hand, literally carried this movie. Her acting was really great and I could really feel her emotions during the scenes. As I said before, this would be better without the romance. I couldn’t root for the guy because he border-lined harassed the girl and manipulated/gaslighted her for choosing herself this time. Not to mention the cheesy liners that was out of place since it looked like he was invalidating her problems. I am genuinely happy with the ending and I am glad that this became a hit in the Philippines because I am tired of the culture that romanticizes struggles as long as you are together.",2023-06-29,negative,0.8337486783663431,7

Hello Love Goodbye,"ang choice para sa mayayaman. Hello, Love, Goodbye perfectly portrayed the stories of OFWs in Hong Kong. Working as an OFW wasn't a choice. They had to, at the cost of their dreams. At the cost of what they could have been. Cheating. Marriage of convenience. Leaving your family behind. These have now become a norm in the OFW culture and society when it shouldn't be. It's a bitter reality of what you would do for your loved ones just to bring them up a level higher on the economic ladder. Being selfish is okay. Choosing to chase for your dreams and to find yourself is okay. Because love alone cannot solely support two people. Can love feed you when you're broke? NO. How could you add one more person in your life when you can barely take care of yourself, right?Anyway, highest respect for all the Joy Marie Fabregas out there. I aspire to be as strong as her.",2023-07-04,positive,0.7792363127072652,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"Hello, Love, Goodbye revolves around the lives of Joy and Ethan; both are Filipino workers based in Hong Kong. Joy is a domestic helper who dreams of working as a nurse in Canada while Ethan is a bartender who is waiting out his permanent residency. Just like how most romantic films go, these two characters meet, fall in love, then… life happens.Hello, Love, Goodbye not just a love story, it’s a life story. About making a choice between love and chasing after your dream. Joy, as the breadwinner, works hard to give herself and her family a better life. She also actively engages in her buy-and-sell business every sunday, and even takes on a second job at night as a waitress. She desperately needs funds not only to send back home, but also to finance her dream of flying off to Canada to practice nursing, her original course. Ethan, on the other hand, is on the road to redemption after letting down his own family. He was supposed to have gained Hong Kong residency already but he left and went to the US to pursue a girl he loved. They broke up and he had to go back to zero in Hong Kong. One is burdened by her family while also committed to her dreams, the other tethered to the idea of making amends to the people closest to him, and a relationship is the last thing they need in their lives.Point of the story was about making choices, no matter how difficult they may be. Joy said “choice is only for the rich.” And she is partly correct. Choice is a luxury only the privileged can afford. It is true that not all of us can have a fair opportunity in life, that’s why when we had a chance we should make sure to grab it and used it. Joy, in the end, realized that she also has to think of herself first and made her own choices for herself, even if it means that she can’t be with Ethan. And it’s not selfish to choose your priorities first, since no one can fully understand your decisions even they say so. Choosing yourself is not an act of “selfishness”. No matter how many reasons you may have to stay and give up on your dreams—even if these include people you love the most—in the end, choosing yourself is still the most fulfilling decision you can do. Of course, if I am in the position of Ethan, I will also do everything for Joy to stay, but we can’t control everything. Sometimes loving someone also means giving them wings to explore horizons of growth.",2023-07-24,positive,0.9072603195905685,9

""I love you.""""Sorry, I don't love you.""""Kung mahal mo ako, bakit pinapapili mo ako?"" Ethan's character is so annoying. The way that his flawed character was written perfectly. He's a lovesick man, who's afraid to be left behind. Therefore, he's willing to do anything just to make Joy stay.Joy's authenticity shines through remarkably. I must confess, I'm absolutely enamored by Miss Kathryn Bernardo! This realm is hers to dominate. There's something exceptionally appealing about this version of Kathryn, one not confined within the bounds of a love team. She undeniably excels as an actress. Joy, remember, there's no error in prioritizing yourself. Your courage is remarkable, evident in the way you shoulder your burdens, entirely on your own.GRABE KA NA RIN MOIRA SA OST ""May mga lugar na pangmatagalan. May mga lugar na dinadaanan lang. Parang Hong Kong. Tulad din ng tao. May mga dumadaan lang... meron din pangmatagalan, na babaguhin ka habang buhay. Ikaw 'yon, Ethan. Salamat.""Ngayon alam ko na kung bakit gusto ko dati ng sequel nito. Pero sa true lang, hindi na need. This is so beautiful that it doesn't need a sequel. Let's just end their story that way.

Hello Love Goodbye,"A romance different enough from the formula to make it interesting yet close enough to keep it undeniably familiar.The first third of the film was filled with much promise, dipping its toes on social commentary by exploring the world of Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong. In the film’s first conflict, we see Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) deftly running away from police — even hiding in the garbage. This must not be her first time.Was this film going to have something to say about the Filipino diaspora?Once it begins to introduce the romance, though, it left that promise to immerse deeply in the tried-and-tested formula. Which is not such a bad thing.What’s refreshing about it is its confident departure from two-dimensional, well-defined fantasy. An attempt to re-define the ‘Star Cinema romantic film’, as it were. I once read about the ‘Star Cinema audience’ ’s rigid expectation of their movies, that they enter the theater fully expecting their ‘happily-ever-after’s and their convenient closures.* While I disagree with this sense of non-adventure, it is naïve to discount this insight significant enough to define the film-watching market for generations. Garcia-Molina’s cache is exactly in catering to this sensibility.The scene of Ethan’s (Alden Richards) introduction is as jarring to Joy as Ethan’s character is to the film. To be honest, I kept on expecting him to revert to some sort of savior trope in Joy’s life all throughout the film, even in his turn as a toxic Nice Guy in a pivotal moment further in the story. To her credit, Garcia-Molina gave Ethan the room to decide realistically and bear the weight of these choices‘ consequences.It was surprising how natural Richards was able to play Ethan. The writers forced his character to say some purely cheesy lines for the sake of saying them — as lip service to this Twitter generation — but Richards was somehow able to pull it off. And Bernardo did well enough in her turn as the headstrong Joy that I merely had to stop comparing her to Nadine Lustre and start appreciating what she was giving to the film.The chemistry was there, too, in that I could see them pulling off a dialogue-heavy romance à la THAT THING CALLED TADHANA, which is in no way easy to do. Those scenes where they were wasting time beside each other were gold.If our mainstream romance is really shaping up to this mold — influenced by the efforts of Antoinette Jadaone, Dan Villegas, Sigrid Bernardo, and others from the independent scene — then I’m definitely looking forward to more pleasantly-surprising, insightful entertainment.—*Don Jaucian, “How Black Sheep is trying to ‘disrupt’ Philippine cinema,” https://www.cnnphilippines.com/life/entertainment/Film/2019/6/4/black-sheep-films-interview.html",2019-08-18,positive,0.9121453513701757,2

Can plots please have another personality besides relishing in xenocentrism? Our country has so much to offer, not to say that filming abroad is outright worthy of condemnation. At least work hard and present matters about that country that people already know off the top of their heads.It has the sincerity of people in a photo-booth posing against a green screen. Sayang. I enjoyed how they showed the plight of domestic helpers in Hong Kong, but the machismo of Alden’s character and the dry jokes rendered it an unenjoyable watch.Women shouldn’t have to sacrifice their progress for a man, any man, whether it be her father, a billionaire, or a misogynist deadbeat who professes his undying love for her.The score was incredibly tacky.We need more films about the Filipino diaspora.",2023-11-26,positive,0.8105586171150208,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"I appreciate the premise and how it's been told. The realities of being an OFW and how specific it is in the context of the Filipino community in Hong Kong.What bothered me were two things:1. Is a preference thing, but Alden and Kathryn held their own, but apparently doesn't work together for me? Chemistry is lackluster, I hate to admit it but I don't feel for them as a couple here. And it is a romance so it's kind of fundamental.2. Is a technical thing - But I was bothered how this was filmed all throughout in 16:9 ratio. I feel like it diminished the scenic appreciation for the location which is Hong Kong. It could be beautifully picturesque in a theater screen, but with the ratio it felt very TV show. This is basically me nitpicking but I would appreciate a noticeable difference with TV and movie.But overall, not a bad watch. Did it waste my time? Not really. Will I consciously choose to watch this again? To kill time, maybe. Does it deserve to be the highest grossing Filipino film? Debatable.

Hello Love Goodbye,"There have been a number of films about the life of an overseas Filipino worker, as our country is unique to have a very significant population pursuing this route. Among these films, there are gems that stood the test of time, and probably influenced real life and further films, as we see in a scene in this film.What makes Hello, Love, Goodbye enjoyable is how effortless it presents the culture, the active and passive decisions, that OFWs take, to fulfill their purpose. While there is a wide cast of characters with their corresponding side stories, nothing feels misplaced. Maybe a few were quite less filling, the different facets and permutation of circumstances of Filipinos living abroad, provides a peek to a rich tapestry for wider stories of these characters.More than how these stories are told, as enhanced by the shot choices and camera movement that let you fall in love with the cityscapes, is the courage to not shy away from the route of the socially desired, mainstream choice.Until when though do Filipinos need to be pressured to make these choices, to enter these circumstances?",2023-12-08,positive,0.9620403498411179,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"God, when will the Philippines retire the overly persistent dude wearing down the uninterested girl with his charms? This film kind of makes up for it with the sheer support radiating off both the characters later in the movie, but it, along with other well-worn cliches, threaten to wear the movie down. Thankfully, though, it doesn't. It's still very much typical Pinoy romcom, but it's also one of the best examples of the genre. There is poignancy, clear-set goals from each character, and most of all, a lack of certainty in the end of their love story. Most other films bend over backwards to provide easy answers, but this movie doesn't. Joy's young cousin doesn't overcome the hardships she faces as a newly-minted domestic helper, but she does tap out and get out of them. Joy and Ethan come together at a time in Joy's life when she is just about to leave to Canada in search of greener pastures. Discontentment and resentment fester in each of the lead's personal lives in ways that don't always go away so easily. And yet...not all solutions come clean. Hello, Love, Goodbye gets that. It as a movie has experienced true life, and despite being cornier than most, it's got its finger on the pulse of the way people love and laugh, especially when time is so fleeting. This is the best acting work on either of the two sides, Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards. A change of pace brings out the best in you, I think.",2023-12-17,positive,0.8250869725431714,2

Hello Love Goodbye,tbh i had some reservations about watching the film at first because i thought the duo's dynamic wouldn't work but so far they did pretty great. there are some pacing issues at the second half but overall it's a pretty solid film. the film unfailingly showcased kath's acting prowess and versatility. alden is so charming too and proved that he can go toe to toe with kath. i wouldn't mind seeing this pair in future projects if the opportunity where to arise.,2023-12-03,positive,0.9921839594841003,10

Hello Love Goodbye,"somehow combines all movie + character tropes possible in the typical pinoy cinema fashion but still had me balling my eyes outthis is truly peak pinoy cinema.. beyond the portrayal of a healthy relationship (finally), i truly enjoyed the portrayal of DH workers in HK in full transparency and rawness.. especially with sending remittance back home as Kathryn also to save money (pag-ipunan) for her nursing agency to fly to Canada .. domestic labor is one of the main sources of income for many Filipino women both at home and abroad. even the opening seen, of her running away from authorities because she took an under the table job exposes the difficult reality of DH workers as they strive to make ends meet for their families back home. joy's situation is very lucky compared to other experiences I've heard of DH being abused and exploited by their bosses. other than being a film starring Kathryn Bernado and surprisingly NOT Daniel Padilla, i wonder what power this film could've had on shedding light on the exploitation, rights, and working conditions of DH workers and the ""outsourcing"" image we have as Filipinosanother line that truly resonated with me was when joy's ama reprimanded joy for abandoning her disabled daughter, annie, on the street.. she unable to pick her up on time.. joy's amma exclaimed, ""how could you do this to her, i thought u loved her"" this made me think about the complexity of love DH workers face.. in ur job description, you must love other peoples children, u care for them daily, watch them grow up, and essentially fill in this role of a parent to these children all while being miles away from your own family and often times unable to spend quality time with them for years until your contract expires.. to what extent to DH workers feel love towards the children they care for while simultaneously feeling guilt that they cannot be there for their own family or children? one possible answer in resolving these complex feelings of love, guilt, and regret is by reminding yourself your sense of purpose in which most of these DH workers find purpose in their love for their family willing to sacrifice to put food on the table and support the education of their loved ones.. YAYA is fantastic documentary that follows the life of a DH worker who in the director's, justin cheung's, words, ""helped build a family at the expense of her own""",2023-12-23,positive,0.9946118593215942,-1

Hello Love Goodbye,"this is Cathy Garcia's redemption after a disappointing film, The Hows of Us. I was very impressed on how they showed the struggle and working conditions of Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong. it even question the problems of labor export policy and the lack of opportunities and failed social services in the country. the storyline might be predictable yet it is straight to the point, and effective to touch the audiences. Star Cinema might repeatedly used their formula for a romantic-drama/comedy film but they handled it properly. the side story of Kathryn's and Alden's family are justified to be part of the story for us to understand their present decisions. the friends from both sides are only present for comedic purposes but it can be problematic as it serves distraction to the real issue. though, i appreciate the presence of Kathryn's companions who are also domestic helpers. Alden's role fell short from the very beginning and we are left with no assurance of his character development. as well, Alden's pick-up lines are so irritating and I am happy Kathryn was not doing it.above all, this is a breakthrough performance of Kathryn Bernardo as she matured to handle a strong female character and let go from her previous fragile roles. this film proves that Kathryn does not need Daniel to be recognized as a great actress.",2024-01-07,positive,0.95403191447258,2

It has its problems in regards with the character Ethan (he's pushy and a bit creepy especially in the first part) but regardless, I appreciate that it is realistic to the struggles and situations of being an OFW and the relationship between the couple and the character's family dynamics as well. Thank god that Joy still chose herself in the end (regardless whether or not what happens to the two of them in the said future).

Hello Love Goodbye,"I watched this film for my thesis, and I loved it!! It’s more than just a typical romance film because it also explored the struggles and plights that OFWs experience. Plus, it delivered a beautiful message about dreams and why we shouldn’t give up on them despite the setbacks we encounter. Ramdam na ramdam ko yung emotions ng story, and ang galing nina Kathryn at Alden dito! They gave such moving performances.However, as much as I love this film, there are some things I didn’t like:-Too many subplots, and not all of them were done well. As the film focused on Joy and Ethan’s love story, many subplots got overshadowed and lost their emotional impact. The one with Joy’s mother towards the end wasn’t even built up properly.-That fatphobic joke from Joross Gamboa’s character… seriously, was that really necessary??-There are so many disabled characters. I appreciate the representation but these disabled characters were just… there. They didn’t serve any crucial purpose apart from highlighting the difficulties in Joy and Ethan’s lives. And why is it that both of Joy and Ethan’s fathers were disabled? I get that the director may have wanted to portray them as weakened, but frankly, having both of them disabled felt forced. Also, the portrayal of Annie’s disability is stereotypical.-As other reviewers have said, Alden’s character (Ethan) is a big red flag. I feel like they could’ve written the conflict without making Ethan a red flag character — without making him disregard Joy’s dream. Also, he was creepy in the beginning. He gave off stalker vibes…-While many of the dialogues were well-written, some felt stiff and forced.-Mary Dale’s disappearance subplot was unnecessary. It came out of nowhere and lasted only for a while, which undercut the emotions. If they spent more time on it, it would’ve hit harder and would’ve really highlighted Mary Dale’s plight as an OFW.Nevertheless, despite these criticisms of mine, I really love this film! It made me smile a lot today.",2024-02-11,positive,0.7873735262287987,0

Hello Love Goodbye,"Sorry, I DON'T LOVE 'Hello, Love, Goodbye' because of: (1) The story. MA... MAKATOTOHANAN. It's like the romance drama version of the 2016 MMFF Best Picture 'Sunday Beauty Queen'. So much respect for our hardworking OFWs not just in Hongkong but all over the world. You appreciate all the sacrifices they make and feel the longing and suffering they endure just to send money to their loved ones back home. (2) The cast. I've always been a fan of Alden Richards' acting skills and he certainly didn't disappoint. I initially thought the role didn't suit him based on the trailer but he just proved that he's one of the best young actors around. Talagang ramdam mo at maiiyak ka pag ginamit na nang Pambansang Bae ang mga mata niya. The supporting cast were all great from Joross Gamboa, Cacai Bautista and Lovely Abella (these 2 were riotous), MaiMai Entrata, Jeffrey Tam, Jameson Blake to veterans Lito Pimentel, Maricel Laxa-Pangilinan and William Lorenzo to even the local Hongkong actors. But it was Kathryn Bernardo who surprised me the most. She really has grown as an actress from her teleserye days. Since I choose not to see her movies with Daniel Padilla, I never expected her to be so effective and sympathetic as the young woman torn between following her own dreams over love. I thought this was more of her movie than Alden's. (3) The soundtrack. Moira, Moira, Moira. Just hearing her voice in 'Kung 'Di Rin Lang Ikaw' and 'Ikaw At Ako' gave me goosebumps. And these 2 songs were the perfect soundtrack to Ethan and Joy's love story. (4) The setting. Who would've thought that the busy streets of urban Hongkong would look beautiful on the big screen. Kudos to the cinematographer.But if I were to nitpick, it would be that the hugot lines were too many. Joy and Ethan mouthing them all off sometimes felt forced just for the viewers to remember and quote them when they talk about the movie. Nonetheless, ang pelikulang ito ay MA... MASAKIT SA PUSO pero MA... MAGANDANG-MAGANDA. So sorry, I don't love this movie because... I REALLY LOVED it.",2024-02-13,positive,0.9038848256071409,9

Hello Love Goodbye,"It's kind of easy to see why Hello, Love, Goodbye was one of the Philippine's highest grossing films until very recently. It's a romance. The movie it dethroned for highest grossing was also a romance movie, and the one that took its place is also largely a romance (with some time travel thrown in). People love love, but they also love the drama and everything else that comes with it. —And boy does Hello, Love, Goodbye have a lot going on. Overwrought emotions, situations with dire circumstances played to dramatic background music, a reluctant at first romance, and so on. Some of this works, I think a romance needs some high stakes and emotionality, some of it falls flat however and doesn't work. I never felt too compelled by the relationship between Joy and Ethan, so the fact that it could've ended at any time was never really upsetting to me.

Hello Love Goodbye,"As the once highest grossing film in all of Philippine history, I was genuinely surprised that HLG interacted with the overseas foreign worker (OFW) problem that has become an omnipresent yet taboo subject. However, HLG’s pitfall is ironically the subject it tries to interact with. HLG portrays a tragic, Shakespearian romance as a result of the OFW problem instead of holding up a mirror to its audience and asking why have we let it become the norm in Filo culture that our children must sacrifice their own autonomy to provide for their family? Also (I can’t believe I’m advocating for men) but Ethan is so creepy in this movie, can we please have some non-asshole Filipino male representation on-screen for once pls <3",2024-03-23,positive,0.7462539225816727,2

Despite being privileged with a good life provided by my parents, I still encounter similar struggles, even in minor ways. This makes me ponder how people who have endured worse or comparable experiences truly feel.I believe this film isn't among the highest-grossing due to its love story, but because it resonated deeply with Filipinos. It's challenging to find representations of Filipino struggles in mainstream cinema; most Filipino movies lack such depictions as they primarily focus on love or ""kilig.""

Kathryn and Alden's superb performances matched with their palpable chemistry were enough to convince me that this film is worth loving. Plus, I admire the depth the actors gave to their characters and I really felt that they were truly immersed and embodied their characters very well. Also, HLG gave me a peek into the lives of our kababayans, especially of Domestic Helpers in Hongkong. Re-watching it today with my mom made me appreciate the movie even more.

Hello Love Goodbye,"I like how they used the camera shot type para mapakita ang closeness ng characters. Yung first encounter nina Joy Marie and Ethan eh separate ang shots sa kanila. Then, they have a long talk but since di pa sila close, wide shot ang ginamit. Noong nagkadevelopan na sila, unti-unti na silang may close-up frames.Ok sana yung screenplay kaso may times kasi na nagiging dragging kapag nagdadramahan na at may unnatural blockings like yung nakayakap si Kath sa likod ni Alden. Weird kasi sana me onting PDA man sila prior.

When HLG came out, very intrigued talaga ako kasi new pairing tapos from 2 rival networks pa, and may reputation naman sila both na magaling umarte. o diba, macu-curious ka talaga, and IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT- kathryn carried the film, bukod sa magaling siya umarte, maganda ang character ni Joy, madaming pinaghuhugutan. Alden gave the right amount of effort in what was required from his character.- nakakakilig sila  lalo na ung piggyback ride scene, idk ang cute nila don- napansin ko ngayon, na-bother ako slight sa mga ayos-sombrero acting ni pareng Alden, mejo naparami- as usual dapat may mga side characters na friends na fun, fun lang. sisingit ng mga light, corny lines in support to main characters haha pero tamang cast naman ung side characters nila dito",2024-04-16,positive,0.9144185185432434,4

Pero yung line na mahirap maging babae kase pag pinili naten sarili natin gago tayo tapos pag pinili natin mag mahal bobo tayo.

Hello Love Goodbye,"watched this the first time and i didnt really like it. but now that i watched it again, i understood why this is the highest grossing filipino film. it captured the hardships and realities of what DH Filipinos experience on a subtly deep level. the longing for ‘more’ but you have to remain in that level just because there is a need to provide. tbh, ethan and joy’s love story was not the main point of this movie; it was more of a side story that helped resurface joy’s character of resilience and strength. those characteristics were used by ethan as a stepping stool not to use it against her but to help her. yes, there were some misdirects esp when ethan didnt want joy to leave and didnt understand her situation at first. it was extremely notable how he didnt force her even though he knows he soon can provide and actually just gave her the best possible 3D2N ‘tour’ joy could bring as a memory before she departs. i love that he didnt stray her away from her independence. it couldve went to a whole diff direction where they built a life in HK but, direk cathy made it a point to make sure that the viewers heard and saw what she wanted the movie to focus on. not ur typical love story, so impactful and so realistic esp to filipinos.",2024-04-27,positive,0.9411764470013705,2

Hello Love Goodbye,"Unexpectedly a success film in every aspect! The story was superb and well-written! It is so relatable by giving highlight to the plight of our Filipino OFWs in Hong Kong with a twist of romance that is far from montage of chessy lines and scenes. Given with this plot about OFW, it is so relevant and relatable already to the audiences. The lead characters shone on their own equally in the story the same as the lead casts justified their roles in giving a compelling performances that exceeds expectations. This is a proof that you don't need love team tandems to produce a great movie! Even the supporting casts, they gave so much life to the story of this movie. And they gave intermittent breaks from the seriousness of the main story. Hong Kong chosen as a backdrop setting for the entire film was promoted fully here and went beyond by showing to us the OFW daily life of Filipinos there. This is a certified travel movie as well! The shots in Hong Kong and its places were flawless and stunning! I love that they promoted it not just a ""transit"" place which Hong Kong is used to be known but also a place to stay. Cinematography was commendable. This film was actually close to masterpiece if it weren't for a open-ended ending that I felt and the rest of the audiences were left wanting more.
