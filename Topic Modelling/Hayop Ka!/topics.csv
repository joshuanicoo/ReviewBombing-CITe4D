Hayop Ka,"Good animation but story writing needs improvement: The animation was fun to watch specially that you don't see that much Filipino animation online.

The thing that I don't like about this movie is that it has too many dirty jokes that aren't that funny, and I think it would've been done better if the jokes were timed right. The story flow was messy, some parts were fast, some parts were slow. I actually found myself watching this movie with a straight face, i guess i was expecting too much since the teasers hyped me up?

Guess the way the story was written isn't my cup of tea. Kudos to those people who worked on this animation! hope to see more animation projects in the future",2
Hayop Ka,"Good Overall: I set my expectations low, when I saw the mainstream local actors were the voice of the characters. Its premise as typical cheap romantic comedy gives me a bad vibes because of reputation of poorly-made-overused plot lines that plagues Filipino mainstream cinema. But I still give it a chance because Filipino animations are not common. I like the cultural references and the catch of the story. I think making it as adult, dark comedy animation film is a great move. In short ""Hayop Ka!"" Exceeds my expectations, 7/10.",2
Hayop Ka,"IT'S CLICHED, FUN AND QUITE TOUCHING: During the first half of ""Hayop Ka,"" tons of cliches from filipino teleseryes and movies were shown, including some funny jokes and references. But after an argument scene that features Robin Padilla's terrific voice acting, the film actually got better. Despite being quite annoying during the first half, the character of Nymfa won me over due to her journey and the ending wherein I realized that a lot of Filipinas end up with the same situation.",-1
Hayop Ka,"A suprise from SEA: Well the animation is good also VA and character design, but storyline need some improvement i was just get disappointed when how the ending comes like that i just kinda hoping that after credits there is some sort epilogue will explain how Nimfa's life foward. But this movie also need some more audience to watch the movie it's a good movie so tell people to watch this movie.",-1
Hayop Ka,"Funny and enjoyable...: When I stumbled upon the 2020 Tagalog animated movie ""Hayop Ka!"", I had no idea what I was getting myself into here. But I read the synopsis for it, and have to say that I was somewhat intrigued, as ""Hayop Ka!"" sounded like something definitely aimed at a more mature audience.

And I will say that writers Manny Angeles, Avid Liongoren and Paulle Olivenza definitely managed to put together a story and plot that was every bit as entertaining as it was enjoyable. So yeah, ""Hayop Ka!"" was a wholesome animated feature for a mature audience. And when I say mature audience I don't mean that it is XXX-rated, but merely that there were references and hits towards lewd nature.

The art style in ""Hayop Ka!"" was strange, but enjoyably so. Initially I was a bit taken aback by the art style, but it quickly grew on me and I came to enjoy the art style that they used here because it was definitely complimenting the story and the message of the movie.

With ""Hayop Ka!"" being an animated movie, a proper voice cast ensemble is a must. And luckily they did have that here. While I am not familiar with Tagalog cinema, then I wasn't familiar with a single voice here. But I will say that the voice acting was good and definitely gave the characters life on the screen.

I found ""Hayop Ka!"" to be an enjoyable surprise of a movie, and definitely is an animated movie that I would recommend for a mature audience that enjoys light-hearted and funny stories. The fact that ""Hayop Ka!"" was told as an animation wasn't really a hindrance in any way.

My rating of director Avid Liongoren's ""Hayop Ka!"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",5
Hayop Ka,"You Filthy Animal, Nimfa XD: Hayop Ka - About the female cat known as Nimfa, who has to decide if she wants to be with her macho boyfriend who she's been with for years or a rich gentlemen guy. The movie has it's ups and downs

Pros:

Character Designs and Animations - Let's go ahead and point this out. I thought the designs for the characters were unique. To the point where I can easily identify where these characters came from. Not only that, but the animation was beautiful!! I enjoyed the movement of these characters!

Repeating Premise with a Surprise - It has been done to death Yes. A female that's tired of her broke life so she wants a chance at the richness and luxury. That's pretty much what Nimfa does in this movie. She leaves her ex to join the rich and luxurious life. Except instead of realizing she was better off with her old life, she doesnt get neither men. Her Ex was now taken and she caught her Rich boyfriend cheating. So the premise is repetitive but there was a nice twist for me!

Roger - If I had to say which character stood out to me more, it was definitely Roger. He was the best character to me in the movie. Because he was trying his best to provide for his girl while staying loyal to her. While admittingly, he is at fault for giving her the same repetitive lifestyle she grown tired of, I felt like he didnt deserve to be lied and cheated on. Plus, his design is pretty hot owo Strong Muscular Dog

Radio Host - I forgot his name but the radio show host straight up tells Nimfa all the wrong things she did. It was the best moment because somebody needed to set things straight with her

Cons -

Third Act/Final Act - The film was going pretty solid so far. That was until the third act or the part where Roger was bailed out of jail for destruction to somebody's car and putting someone in the hospital. After that part, I personally felt like the story kind of fell apart. Nimfa does have a guilty mind for the decisions she made, which is understandable. But here is one that I felt like fell apart: Nimfa getting pregnant with Roger's baby. This was when literally Nimfa and Iningo finished having sex on the beach. She was pregnant next day and it was Roger's baby. I was confused because they havent had sex in a while! She was pretty much banging Iningo. Plus, I felt like this was a bit out of place for something like a pregnancy to happen. There are more to it but watch the film. You'll understand why I felt like the third act of the film kind of just fell apart. Not only that but the ending felt so unsatisfying. Since the third act pretty much broke apart, the ending felt unsatisfying

Overall, A solid movie at best. Of course the story is pretty much basic but with a neat rwist. I just felt like the movie was dragged down by the third act of the film",5
Hayop Ka,"It's a good start!: It's a good start! In fact, I can call the whole thing a masterpiece from a creative standpoint. Surprisingly, it was entertaining despite the usual Pinoy the-other-woman trope surrounding the plot (but come on... Filipinos are more than just a Telenovela audience). I have to commend the team behind this project, though, for being bold and for choosing an unconventional direction-we don't get to see a 2D-animated anthropomorphic characters featured in an adult infidelity-driven storyline everyday, do we? Overall, kudos to Rocketsheep Studio for a very fine job! The Philippine animation industry has really come a long way. Keep on!",2
Hayop Ka,Awesome visuals; weak story: Really impressed w/ the visuals and animation. Story could work a bit better tho.,0
Hayop Ka,Coolest slice of life comedy!!!: This is the funniest and coolest slice of life comedy that I've ever seen. This is the reality of life. I really loved every details of it. It's a sad and happy story. I laughed a lot with this film and the part where empoy sang almost brought me to tears. Thank you for the filipinos who did this. I hope you continue doing more of this amazing comedy film. That was very entertaining and honest. Great characters. Thank you very much. ,2
Hayop Ka,The Nutshack is better than this: This is just a furry cartoon with a Philippine teleserye cliche.,1
Hayop Ka,"A Must Watch for me: The Movie is pretty good, the dialogue is very witty, and very Filipino. Some or most of the Jokes I'm not sure Foreigners will appreciate as much, like when Nimfa said, ""sa Pares pa talaga nag propose"", LOL.

The Characterizations were also pretty good by everybody in the Cast. The Plot is also very Filipino, like Nimfa supporting her Sister's Education, etc. and it is not as predictable as you might think, there are some surprising twists in the Story also.

Stick around for the Credits, the rest of Nimfa's Story is also shown in Story Board format. And I also loved Empoy's rendition (I think it was Empoy) of Jose Mari Chan's ""Beautiful Girl"" at the end. Overall it is a Must Watch for me.",2
Hayop Ka,"A strong story but a weak ending: Although the visuals looked so good, the story doesn't reach the Steven Spielberg storyline, but it could have some improvements",0
Hayop Ka,"Past the Vulgar Theme is a Message: The Theme: Past the dirty jokes and the sex theme of this movie is a filipino masterpiece, no doubt about that. Congratulations to the makers of this film. It's not usual that Filipinos brave an animated movie production like this, so kudos to you guys for that.

The Production: Angelica, Sam and Empoy are personalities fit for their roles. The dubbing could have been improved though. This caveat for me is that there are some scenes where the emotions and interaction of the characters seem so disconnected with each other. Did they record separately? Together? It's not majority of the movie but there are just some scenes that felt like they aren't talking to each other but are just speaking in character by themselves.

But the character design, the vulgarity of the screenplay, I agree that these are great creative routes for marketing purposes. They worked for me.

And I like that this movie was able to feature a pinoy world in a not so cliche way... the saleslady, the pares house, papa george.. seeing filipino icons in an animation is so funny itself. I love these.

The Story: The ending is definitely THE conversation starter. Why did she 'happily' come back to that pares house with jerry? Isn't that place what she's trying to leave for so long? Or was it really roger she's been tired already?

Is the ending a picture of failure? As in going back to square one or zero?

Or is it a depiction of a second chance at love at the same start?

I don't know the answers but I'm happy to be intrigued.

Good job and again congratulations to the team behind this. :)",2
Hayop Ka,"Visually pleasant, rather disappointing story-wise: All that is good in this title is it's eye-catching art. Granted, I watched the English dub, so I could have missed a lot of untranslatable jokes throughout the movie, but it seemed that most of them are toilet humour and jokes for 12-year-olds anyway. The whole plot revolves around such trivial and beaten tropes that nothing in the movie strikes me as exciting or unexpected. This title could have tried to be anything else but the cheesy and unoriginal romcom that it is, and with the beautiful art direction it could be more mature and bring more to the table in terms of story and characters. The main plot doesn't grab any stars from the sky, nor does it even try to be original. My takeaway: I would love to see more projects by the animation team behind this movie, but in a title that will actually make me feel something.",0
Hayop Ka,PLEASE MAKE MORE FILMS LIKE THIS.: Totally love it! Hope they make more . Laughter all the wayy plus the animation style is superb.,0
Hayop Ka,"Nice graphics and amusing characters, but terrible message: The movie has been a pleasant eye candy visually, the characters somewhat enjoyable,though a bit insipid and cliché. But what is the moral of the story? Its OK to cheat? Its OK to laugh and be angry on somebody because he is poor and you want more than that, that you just like him for sex, and insult him for loving you and wanting to be with you? Not saying he was the greatest but the main character was angry at him and laughing at him for unreasonable motives.

Also throwing a fit over something she herself ends up doing, having unprotected sex resulting in a baby?

And happy in the end because..what, she made a new friend? Almost instantly after a rage fuelled cat fight with the rich guy and his""friend""

What is the reason of this movie? I feel sorry for the animators that had to put up with such a dull content. They made me give it 3 stars rating and one more star for some amusing scenes. But it's not saving the movie at all.",0
Hayop Ka,Love it!: A whole lot of pun and the animation is superb! A punny take on classic Pinoy radionovelas brought to life!,6
Hayop Ka,"New Cover Same Book: Same story line as what other rom-com filipino film already has. A girl torn between a dust poor and extremely rich lover. With animation, you can show more of your imagination that is difficult to perform with live actors but unfortunately they stuck with the usual filipino content.",2
Hayop Ka,"Philippine Animation at its best: I loved every single bit of it. From the animation, to the witty dialogue, to the story (you'll like it better once you're aware that it's supposed to be a parody of Filipino teleserye romcom tropes), and even the music. As contrary to what some might have said about it, I actually find it to be pretty woke and progressive, with its not-so-subtle nods to current social issues such as contractualization, police brutality, etc. Like, there was even a scene in the film where you can find a poster with Duterte's face on it depicted as a literal dog; how can you be more woke than that? Politics aside, I really enjoyed the film overall. I hope Hayop Ka! manages to inspire more Filipino creatives to express the wonder of Filipino culture more and to be able to show to the world how amazing Filipino talent can be.",2
Hayop Ka,"A visual feast: A visual feast. I have to pause the scenes every once in a while to appreciate every details. Imagine our chaotic metropolis interpreted by impressionist artist exploding with colors and lights. Dark scenes highlighted with glimmering lights inbetween and daytime landscapes so detailed that even captured the tangled electric cables, bumper to bumper traffic, rusty rooftops and most realities in the city we live in and yet somehow so mesmerizing to see in their own way. The same studio that created Saving Sally, you can easily tell their signature style that separates them from other animation studios here and globally. Much like Cartoon Saloon, an animation studio based in Ireland (Song of the Sea, Bread Winner to name a few of their movies) focus on their unique styles of visuals in their story telling. Each cells worthy to be printed, framed and hanged in your living room. Kudos to the talented creatives and artists. You are making a difference indeed.",0
Hayop Ka,"A Rocketsheep exceptional: As what reviewer Artsmart stated. Hayop Ka! (You Animal!) is exactly stands out as a note worthy ""visual feast"". and in addition to this, I would like to sincerely congratulate the makers of this animation. It is truly a great work of art, following ""Saving Sally"". Who would have thought they'd actually release yet, another amazing show. Not to mention, The casting and dubbing for the voices of this was truly exceptional. Although, it is not an animation that can be for all ages. It is a true treat for both Film and animation enthusiast of legal age. If our entertainment could release shows in such feat, I am looking forward to more of these. Please watch Hayop Ka! and support our local art industry.",4
Hayop Ka,Great movie but ruined by a voice actor: Great animation. Good story. The VA's were mostly okay but it was Robin Padilla's voice who ruined the entire mood of the movie. It's creepy and cringey. Hoping they will re-release it with a new VA replacing Binoy's part.,7
Hayop Ka,Greatest Filipino Animation: I love everything about this movie! From story to the animation itself! There's more to it than you saw.,2
Hayop Ka,"Delightful: A Cat meets and falls in love with the handsome and rich Wolf of her dreams, despite having an ordinary Dog boyfriend. This is a loving send-up of Filipino soap operas, with a touch of raunch and a lot of charm. The film ends with Nimfa getting pregnant with Roger's child, having broken up with both Roger, her dog boyfriend, and Inigo, her wolf boyfriend. She actually has a hinted at romantic relationship with Jerry, the Frog.

What a delightful and funny film. You feel the loving sendup of Filipino soap operas, all carried along with its charming and adorable art style. The film dips into hilarious raunch for a few moments, just enough to spice things up, but is still pretty elevated. A wonderful film. Personally, I don't think of this as a ""dirty"" film.",5
Hayop Ka,"It's a first, so I'll give this one a try and pretend that I didn't know someone, who is a pathetic excuse for a human being, have voiced one of the characters here. The film's title fits him.",0
Hayop Ka,:/,1
Hayop Ka,"Ang cute ng pelikulang ‘to! Aliw ako sa mga pun jokes sa mga background—Jolibog, unang kagat, tinapay lahat.",3
Hayop Ka,"I was pretty much on the bandwagon with this movie, mostly because of the devoted effort that the animators have worked on from Rocketsheep Studio's last film from 2016, Saving Sally, a beautifully made film mixing animated and live-action elements in a seamless polish, only to be pulled down with a standard plot and intolerable characters. So even with my skewed expectations for this film, I still do hope that this would fare better, and...It does, but it does not at the same time. So I may as well start out with the cons before the pros, and these have to do with the story and themes itself and how the tone can clash with the animation. Given that it's rated 18, the themes that it tackles do fit well, but how they are executed is in poor taste, which does remind me of how Saving Sally executes its own mature themes, but at least this film gives these themes a bit more room for discussion, even if it's dealt with in a sour, and sometimes questionable manner. The story is simple yet dramatic and can hit some good moments. I just wished it was a bit longer and does not cut through dramatic scene to dramatic scene so quickly, which made the resolution and ending so spotty, unsatisfying, and utterly rushed. The overall tone can clash with the animation in a consistent way, as some scenes do not mesh well with the hyperbolic nature of the animation, which can make some of the melodramatic scenes to be unfit and oddly uncomfortable with the cinematic and energetic flow of the animation.Pushing the flaws aside, I will say that the animation is excellent all throughout. Smooth, expressive, and gives the characters a lot of personality. The backgrounds are detailed with anthro versions of real-life brands, mottos, and references which gives more attention to detail to the movie. And the performances for the most part are also in their A-game as well, especially Angelica Panganiban.Even despite my mixed feelings for this movie, I still do want to convince everyone to watch the film, because if the film managed to succeed in its streaming sales, then that would determine how many animated films would go down the line in the years to come. And hey, with the animation this good, who wouldn't be excited for more locally animated films such as this one?",0
Hayop Ka,"Plotwise, it's cliche. The characters are horrible and even the titular role isn't really admirable nor rootable at the very least. The puns are enjoyable every once in a while, though.Still it's good to see that the country is progressing when it comes to making animated films like this.",-1
Hayop Ka,feel ko magkakasundo si elsa (jowable) tsaka si nimfa kung sakaling magkakilala sila. masyadong uhaw na uhaw sa etits???? ¿?,1
Hayop Ka,"-super funny like,, i haven't laughed at a movie like this recently!!-shows how you can never escape toxicity in terms of love and friendship-being too ambitious will get you nothing tsk tsk",8
Hayop Ka,"I think it’s pretty good. It’s fun to watch, has strong voice acting, and has a well-detailed world. The only problem I have is that the story is a bit basic and that one of the voice actors is R**in P**illa",0
Hayop Ka,"Commendable for its animation, however, the story is as usual deals with kabit kabit which we’ve already seen so many times in Philippine Cinema. Don’t get me started with that scene with the radio DJ. Ugh.It has its political easter eggs but it was too safe.",5
Hayop Ka,"I honestly hate the voice acting and the typical love trope in this movie. The animation however was enjoyable and entertaining, fun and unique to watch and would like to see more from the philippine animation industry.",2
Hayop Ka,"Low expectations because Saving Sally is disappointing af lolEntertaining at best, questionable morals at worst. The animation is very good though. Lots of funny sight gags and admirable attention to detail.My namesake can choke on his Jolibog.",0
Hayop Ka,Honestly not bad when it comes to the execution and look of the whole film. It's a reflection of a story that actually happens in this age. It's aytt,0
Hayop Ka,Distinctly Pinoy story (and I mean Pinoy with problematic tropes and questionable decisions lol) and AMAZING animation. Pretty much it for me.,0
Hayop Ka,"Yeah, I hate this. I guess the film deserves credit for its look, which is genuinely appealing and clearly the work of artists who put a lot of thought into the details of this animal version of the Philippines. The animation is constrained, certainly, but it manages to create a strong sense of movement and action when it needs to. But yeah, I hate it. This story seems to have been inspired by that completely reprehensible call-in radio show where…",2
Hayop Ka,"It's THE CLIMB.Again and again, hiwalayan niyo nalang muna kung hindi niyo na gusto bago kayo humanap ng iba. Please lang gyod.P.S Mga animal gyod diay sila. Literally and figuratively.P.S (2) It's the puns and humor for me.",1

Hayop Ka,4 stars for the animation,4
Hayop Ka,loved the art!!! but man that plot needed some work,0
Hayop Ka,"Thought I'd support this film as it's a first in the PH. I saw people's dislike for the story and I can definitely see why, but aside from that, the attention to detail is amazing.",0
Hayop Ka,"Lol the wasted potential on the story and the use of animation as more than a comedic medium. Would've wanted to see more of it as a unique and cohesive story rather than problematic and stereotypical. Other than that the animation is great, props to all the artists who worked on this. Hoping to see more local animation films in the near future.",0
Hayop Ka,"Nagka mali man tayo sa buhay, maraming tukso at pagsubok man ang dumaan at hindi napag tagumpayan, ito yung mag bibigay sa atin ng mga aral at ng tamang taong mag bibigay ng kasiyahan at kakontentohan natin sa buhay.Sobrang warm and nostalgic ng feeling nitong palabas na ito.

Hayop Ka,Oks ung animation but Darryl Yap ghost wrote this.Same vibes as Jowable pero di siya magkamayaw sa jowa niya.,3
Hayop Ka,"2/5I’m giving this score for what its animation is though the story isn’t really anything (if so, it’s like a more or less a rewrite of Jowable). The jokes are fun but stales over time, the references over the animation are fun to look at and get a quick laugh.",0

Hayop Ka,"""The animation is great, really...""",0
Hayop Ka,I can look past all its flaws because of how fresh and exciting the animation was. We don’t get to see this much in Philippine cinema so this is a feat in itself no matter how overused the story is. I like to think that the film succeeded in showing the class struggles too and that’s enough for me today after a long day at work.,2
Hayop Ka,At least Saving Sally is cute.,0
Hayop Ka,rating the animation only. plot sucks lmao,0
Hayop Ka,"Even with all the controversy behind it recently, we want ""Hayop Ka!"" (""You Animal!"") to succeed. The film is a technical marvel with its animation and is truly a showcase on what our local artists can do. But nothing can save it from its very simple and one-sided characters and narrative - that have no redeeming values or whatsoever. Nimfa Dimaano (Angelica Panganiban) is a pretty cat who works as a perfume sales lady at a department store. Her boyfriend is Roger (Robin Padilla) who works as a janitor and already happy and satisfied with his standing in life. But Nimfa wants more and when she meets Iñigo Villanueva (Sam Milby), a super rich business dog, their chemistry ignites. Who will Nimfa choose? Roger’s unending love or Iñigo’s unending riches?Taking years to make, it seemed like much of the effort in creating ""Hayop Ka!"" was put into crafting its world of parody. If you're a Filipino viewer then every scene will be oozing with inside jokes that it was actually as amusing as the animation itself. Speaking of the animation, this is the strongest asset for ""Hayop Ka!"". The colorful and vibrant environments and palette make every scene stand out and the 2D animation had the perfect mix of feeling nostalgic and modern at the same time. The voice acting was good but not great. While the voice actors themselves handled the script well, there's just this feeling that the visuals and audio didn't match up 100%. Unfortunately, the film had poorly-written characters and narrative. It was too simple to the point that the characters themselves were one-sided and extremely flawed. The characters do ""bad things"" and there's little chance for them to redeem themselves given the film's running time of 98 minutes. We understand that this is a raunchy comedy but putting non-redeemable characters just for the sake of being in tone with its theme was a bad decision in our opinion. Overall though, ""Hayop Ka!"" at least had excellent comedy and visuals that will make you laugh - just don't expect to get anything else from the experience.

Hayop Ka,i don't want to invalidate the hard work of the filmmakers behind this movie but i'm disappointed. i stopped watching filipino tv dramas because of their constant misogynistic and classist storylines and it makes me sad that this promising pinoy-made animation film followed that toxic path. sayang tbh.,2

Hayop Ka,"I’m not really going to write a review longer than a sentence, as I think that this film is undeserving of my time and effort, but here are my thoughts: the animation is splendid, but at the same time also felt overly controlled, and the plot is an amalgamation of garbage topics that the mainstream Philippine entertainment industry likes to peddle, such as adultery, misogyny, and classism, but I really hope the animators are well paid because, frankly, I think that they’re the only people who deserve to get any sort of monetary compensation for this embarrassment of a film. Also, yes, I know it’s a satire film and my point still stands.",2
Hayop Ka,"Story and writing: 2.5/5Animation: 4/5Characters and voice acting: 3.5/5Overall score: 10/15Rating: Decent (3.33/5)Song: ""Love Me Like You Do"" by Ellie Goulding (from ""50 Shades of Grey"") - youtu.be/AJtDXIazrMoBeing Singaporean, it's such a pleasant surprise that Southeast Asian animation is getting better and better each year given that it's a very small industry in the region, even in 2020. I got to be honest, 2020 is the year where the small and low-budget animated movies managed to be at times on par with the mainstream giants. Hayop Ka (or You Animal), from the Philippines' Rocketsheep Studios (who also produced the unique hybrid movie ""Saving Sally"") should be included on that list.The story parodies on classic Filippino soap oprea tropes, in that it's a love triangle between a saleslady, her janitor boyfriend and a rich businessman whom she feel in love with the first time they encountered each other. One of the best things about the story is that it's one of the funniest animated movies of the year. The amount of animal-related puns, innuendos and sexual tensions justify the M18 rating there, but it also sacrificed the cohesion and flow of the love triangle, an absolute shame given that it's the writing that mainly let the whole movie down (also, a little bit too many storylines to cover in such a short frame). Still, for their first animated movie attempt, the story is still enjoyable to a certain extent.But, let's talk about the most surprising element of the movie: the animation. This is easily well animated. I know I prefer 2D animation to 3D CGI, but for an animated movie made in the Philippines, this is a solid attempt! There are moments where the colours are a little bit flat, but when the animation gets dynamic, it shows the full potential of its animation and we rarely get this type of animation anymore. Kudos to the guys at Rocketsheep for such great animation.As for characters, most of the main cast are full realised, although given its 73-minute runtime, some of the development felt rushed. I feel for the main character Nimfa (voiced by Angelica Panganiban) as she struggled to keep her affection with the rich businessman a secret as well as the two main male leads. If the story is a letdown, the entertaining characters did not.I will give Hayop Ka credit for one thing: they should not be underestimated when it comes to low budget animated movies that came out in 2020, especially when it's easily one of the most entertaining low budget animated movies of 2020. It's currently available in most Asian countries that has Netflix, so if you can't wait to support Filippino animation but you are outside Asia, do keep a lookout for its release in other countries on Netflix. Trust me, Hayop Ka is a great surprise, but I truly wish for 10 to 15 more minutes of this great animated and furry parody of typical Filippino soap opreas.",2
Hayop Ka,"sabi ko na pangit eh, tanginang yan parang mainstream teleserye lang pero kingkoy ampota",1
Hayop Ka,"i support local animators, pero nawbwesit talaga ako sa tema nito, sayang yung effort nung animators, bat ba kasi about adultery, misogyny, and classism yung storya nakuuusabi ko nga parang mainstream teleserye lang ampota pero kingkoy",3
Hayop Ka,"From the creators of ""Saving Sally"" comes this Filipino adult-animated film that is a visual marvel on its own right. Animation vendor Rocketsheep Studios created a visually stunning animation with a consistent style that explodes onscreen. Plus, the visual gags and colorful sequences make it stand out.Where it falls is on its story that manages to be frustratingly unoriginal and unconsciously misogynistic. While the core narrative was inspired from an actual caller story, it just rings of the flaws of typical Filipino rom-coms. And it only made the character of Nimfa Dimaano really stale.Speaking of, while she did a decent job, Angelica Panganiban is no voice actor when doing Nimfa. The only ones to stand out in the voiceover department are Empoy Marquez as Inigo's jolly chauffeur Larry/Jerry (insert stolen ""Parks & Rec"" joke here), Arci Munoz as Nimfa's best friend Jherelyn and Piolo Pascual as a radio DJ. But they cannot get over the fact that they play stock characters.Overall, ""Hayop Ka!"" excels in the animation department but settles that with a generic and flawed story. Other than criticizing Robon Padilla, naysayers can at least acknowledge its animation potential.",2
Hayop Ka,"Very beautifully animated, but very bad. In fact, it really hurts how bad it is. The star is for the animation team and the animation team alone.",0
Hayop Ka,"the only reason i'm giving it more than 1 1/2 stars is because of the animation. the story was so messy and most characters are pretty shitty so who am i supposed to root for?? also, let professional voice actors take voice roles",7

Hayop Ka,ang ganda ng animation sobra!!! ganda ng frame bawat minuto huhu yung story lang talaga  sayang aaaaaa :( pero sobrang sobrang ganda talaga ng animation :( <3 hoping for more fil animated films in the future !,3
Hayop Ka,"Magbibigay ako ng 3 stars for the animation kasi deserve niya ma-praise kasi maganda naman talaga pagkakagawa. Also, it’s a collaboration effort of animators. The people behind this animated film deserve the praise. Not including of course, the you know who. And yung nawawalang 2 stars to complete the 5 stars ay yung sayang na plot. Sayang eh. I enjoyed the film though, but there are times na nagccringe ako sa lines or sa gustong iparating ng particular scenes.",4
Hayop Ka,"It’s always extra disappointing to see good work wasted by mediocre writing and direction.The animation is a lovely step forward for the local industry, but the story? Geez. Can’t polish a turd and expect something beautiful to come out of it.It’s really odd to see how the people who worked on the visuals have pushing certain standards in mind; while the people on the other side have a script that takes it many steps backward. Horrible.",0

Hayop Ka,"Looking at it with a positive note, I really hope ""Hayop Ka!"" shows everyone the potential greatness of Filipino animation. The hardwork put into this visually appealing film is enough for me to give this medium support, even if everything else fell flat.There really is nothing new to the plot, though I commend Avid Liongoren for throwing it back to the FM stories while blending it with today's culture. I could really see how better the story could have gone, but I guess they went for safety instead. Baby steps, I suppose.Filipino animation has a long way to go, and with that voice acting (I'd say Sam Milby was the best of this bunch). I just really hope this sparks interest, because the creativity of this film is really admirable. Let's make sure it gets the right support, and it gets done well.",5
Hayop Ka,Great animation wouldn't blind me with the fact that this is so backward conservative and misogynistic.,0
Hayop Ka,"After so many years we got an another animated film here in the Philippines!!! Very nice artstyle and animation i would say. Didn't know Filipinos have inner furries inside of them. Also I didn't expect this to have a fricking sex scene. Oh also, my god this film will remind you every second that this is an adult film. Every second there's a dirty joke scattered throughout the film. It's like the screenwriters bottled up all of the sex jokes they can think off and bursting them all out at once. Most of them don't really land, and i don't find really funny. While few of it make me chuckle. Now about the voice actings. It's still kinda weird for me. Some of it sounds off to me, like it doesn't fit or something. The story and the script are kinda bad tho. All in all, You can skip this film.",2
Hayop Ka,This film missed the chance to use ‘MEOWther Fvcker’ as a translation to Pusang Ina. Animation is on a hundred! Super love the visuals! Most of the jokes landed and it’s actually really funny. Even the little details like Nimfa tried pushing the automatics sliding door. The story is a little bit...................lacking. And not the one coming from The boobs of Nimfa’s mom.,-1

Hayop Ka,It makes for an entertaining half-told story. But that's it. It's half a story.,0
Hayop Ka,my stars are only for the animators! they did well! ...don't like the story but it is funny.,-1
Hayop Ka,"one and a half  for the animation. unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to save the film. the artists who worked hard to bring this to life deserve a better narrative to productively waste their time on the next time.an additional half  for the poorly executed attempt to squeeze the plethora of social issues in the country (contractualization, sex education, to name a few) and other glorified constructs we should never even have in the first place (i’d like to think their characters as satire, most especially Inigo’s. tangina, El*n M*sk?).",0
Hayop Ka,ok sige sobrang ganda ng animation pero basura talaga yung kwento tapos sana voice actors na lang kinuha nila yun lang,3
Hayop Ka,"the art is really really pretty, i appreciate the jokes here and there and the hard work the studio put behind this. i'd also probably rewatch to read all the witty background signs but i wish there was more to the story than just that.... the misogyny truly jumped out.",0
Hayop Ka,kwentong kalye at its finest. all the stars are for the super pleasing animation. could’ve been a great chance to tell a meaningful story so sayang.,4
Hayop Ka,"Beautiful animation and an enjoyable performance from Sam Milby, though I must agree na parang sayang nga. Entertaining to some extent, lalo na sa jokes and puns, but I think writing and development could’ve been better, and I think it’s more obvious as you go along. Gets na satire etc etc pero pwede pa rin naman i-push yun eh. Also would’ve been interesting to see professional voice actors star in this, but ayun. Cute ng character ni Jerry and lol?!? Moira de la Torre and Papa P in this???",-1

Hayop Ka,at least na feel kong gusto ko ng hotdog dahil sa palabas na to....,1
Hayop Ka,wtf is this shit,1
Hayop Ka,can’t believe this is the shit storyline they decided to go with,-1
Hayop Ka,"Genuinely liked this a lot cause it felt more like a satirical perspective on the usual Filipino mainstream movies (adultery, class issues, you get it). Story really was just meh tho the plot could have been more fleshed out, dialogue was pretty witty tho plus the voice acting was surprisingly well done too (fuck u pa din Robin P.) But what really takes the bait is the animation my god it really sucks you in and reminded me of how bojack horseman (who makes a silent guest appearance at the end) used to do that too. So yeah heavy 3 to light 4 (out of 5) on thisFun time if you're drunk, or even if you're not",2
Hayop Ka,"Amazed with the attention to detail, context, setting, THE ANIMATIONS. First time to see an animated film that I can understand its local language (didn't need subs for this one!) Though ngl there’s so much to improve on especially in terms of plot and casting. Either way, it was an enjoyable watch.",0
Hayop Ka,Sobrang ganda kasama na rin ang produksyon at pag-arte! Panalo para sa unang animasyon na pelikula sa ating bansa!,1
Hayop Ka,"SPOILERS all the way1) Since I watched the film with friends (through Netflix Party/Teleparty), there was entertainment in its crude dialogue and spotting out several puns, even the corny ones like in the police station: ""We Serve and Protecc"" but it became apparent, around halfway through the run time, the film has nothing else to offer.2) Inconsistent characterization with ML (Huskie). At first, he was portrayed as an arrogant rich snob by buying a whole restaurant for failing to honor his reservation. Then, for the most part, he was actually kind. Not only to the FL but to everyone. His character came back near the end where he says ""Girls no need to fight. You can share me"". But at that point it was already a hopeless case. 3) There are some potential dramatic scenes but somewhat downplayed by execution. Example near the end where the FL finds that her sister is already a parent . There is no apparent build-up. It escalated quickly, in this case, to a cat fight, which to be honest lost its effectiveness. A sample of a proper build-up is that classic ""Wag Mo Akong Ma Terry Terry"" scene. In this scene, there was also a beat of the sister returning a money FL sent through the years. I like this beat. It gives the sister a bit more depth that she is not solely living off FL's allowance and is actually serious about earning her keep. But it was just downplayed, as if it didn't happen. Like FL didn't even recognize this. It would have been nice if sister put up a fight with FL. It was all too one-sided. Also in this scene, I'm 50/50 on this. They made a joke after the dramatic scene. Can't recall it properly but it includes FL saying you are too young. You don't have breast. I might even have to breast feed your baby. Then FL's mother rebuts, don't worry I can still breastfeed while she massages her breast. Like whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut I mean per se its funny, it's just a bit out of place.4) At its current state, the writing is just an excuse to make the film rather than the basis of the film. This is a shame because the script has a potential dramatic core. I'm referring to FL discovering she is (A) pregnant not with her current BF but with her recent ex, (B) who happens to now be with her best friend and all the while (C) her sister is also pregnant. The way I would see it is her sister represents hope so seeing that hope broken also affects her. Another depth is the FL is now being a hypocrite by not practicing what she preach which is use contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancy . As you can see, there are a lot of events that carry the film. If only that drama happened much earlier and they tackled it properly with proper thought process, it would have be a concrete film. What happened in the film is FL goes to radio station and asks for advice. I mean how lazy can you be? I can't wholeheartedly recommend Jowables but at least that film did justice to unwanted pregnancy plot point5) So, for the most part of the film, our FL is the ""bad character"" for intentionally cheating. One way or another, the film will eventually redeem her. Apart from having unwanted pregnancy which audience pity, the film ""redeems"" FL by having FL's ex hook up with FL's best friend . I actually don't mind this per se. What I mind is the ex instantly became an asshole and the FL's best friend a bitch. Oh if you're wondering how does this redeem the FL, it's the case of ""I am bad, but other people do more bad to me. So I'm not that bad"" kind of narrative. It's subtle but, since at this point, the FL is now a total underdog, the audience will naturally root for her, to some degree.6) Part of #4. If only we get the side of FL's ex and FL's best friend after hearing about the pregnancy. Would have been a proper film. 7) The music, both the BGM, fx, foleys etc, are somewhat shabby choices. Can't really support this one since I'm not a music/audio person but it's the type not quite for film-material. 8) I also don't get why the characters need to be animals. In Zootopia or Beastars, it makes sense because it's part of their discrimation plot point (i.e. prey vs predator). The only reference I can is in the title ""Hayop Ka"" where the FL obeys her survival or pleasure instinct like an animal. They could have been just human characters and it wouldn't make much difference. 9) The FL's love problem is somewhat resolve by hooking up with the driver character, the frog. I'm not sure what to feel about that. 10) I like the ending montage sequence.",0
Hayop Ka,2 stars for the animations ONLY. typical philippine cinema trope YUCK. this made me laugh nonetheless.,2
Hayop Ka,hayop bat ko ba to pinanood,1
Hayop Ka,"I watched this for the animation and bore through the cringe-worthy voice acting and unlike-able characters. There was no character development whatsoever and the story is borderline problematic to say the very least, but what refreshing visuals! Let's support Filipino animators so that they won't have to bring to life stories like this again.",2

Hayop Ka,ampanget ng story and script pero in fairness nice yung animation,-1
Hayop Ka,"The animation is great but yes, there are times it can be a bit constrained. The story is mainstream (typical Filipino mainstream movies) but the script has its moments--it has a bit of witty dialogues here and there. The ending though, is problematic. You don't portray female characters with that kind of perspective. It's not just women who are to blame for their relationship problems.",2
Hayop Ka,"Despite the obvious problems with the films topics, I felt like the writers could have pushed the story towards a deeper ""bojack-finding-himself"" approach instead of the typical nice guys finish last trope because we all know that its just way overused.But kudos to the people who worked on the film! Totally enjoyed the subtle bastos jokes and the beautiful art. This film might seem like a setback but I do hope the production learns from their mistakes and keep making films!",0
Hayop Ka,Ito yung hinintay ko ng dalawang (?) taon?Congrats na lang po sa animation team at kay Angelica.,6
Hayop Ka,Underdeveloped story but the animation and the voice performances of Angelica Panganiban and Piolo Pascual were enough to salvage this.,-1
Hayop Ka,"pros include the animation, details & angelica panganibancons include bakit si robin padilla yung si roger :((( dami ngang dds sa voice actors huhuhu and i guess the plot too",3
Hayop Ka,"Yes support local but it has to be good local or else we'll be complacent with bad local and keep making bad local. This movie's saving grace is really its animation and it's sad to know that the artists got underpaid. However, the form isn't always what a movie is and it also needs substance. Literally Nimfa did not learn anything at the end of the movie as he hooks up with the frog. A lot of things in…",2
Hayop Ka,Nakakatuwa yung art style at animation!,6
Hayop Ka,"this is getting 3 stars solely because of the animationI just finished this and I swear this may be another huge step for Filipino animation. The animation is gorgeous here! I love it so much! One would see all the references of the local places here and that just made me so excited. Gosh, Filipino animation definitely needs more support.In line with that need for support,major oof for the narrative. Nimfa isn't a character you would actually root for, sadly. I'm really sad how the plot is constructed and how it ended. I was really annoyed at the part wherein Nimfa was being dragged down even more for her ""human choices"" like oof, she was legit called out in a really terrible way on live radio. Gosh that was really an oof. PLUS, THAT WAS A CLIMAX MAN HHHHH. This film pretty much used a lot of stereotypes commonly seen in Filipino media hhhhhhh. Love triangles, the romanticization of pregnancy, cinderella stories, misogyny, rich families, and kinda a lot more, just oof, really. There's kinda a lot of romanticization hhhhh. Nimfa tries to be a redeeming character who's slightly politically and socially aware but that's not enough to redeem herself as a protagonist. I enjoyed a lot of the animation and references mostly. The fight scenes and change of animation styles throughout the story is what honestly allowed me to stay hooked in this film. This Filipino animation film is another huge step for animation in the country, but it is also a wake-up call for Filipino storytellers to change the landscape of storytelling. Yes, we should serve the masses and let them relate. but the more we maintain those tropes and stereotypes, the more we are to promote them in actual society which SHOULD NOT be the norm. We need more progressive stories to influence both the youth and adults. The voice acting though needs a bit of work. Also, well oof for some of the voice actors hhhhhhhh. Anyway, I'd only recommend you to watch this film for the sake of supporting Filipino animators.",2
Hayop Ka,napangiti naman aq neto pinupuri ko yung mga animators ang gagaling pero nakakaumay na kasi na puro ganto nagiging takbo ng storya sa pilipinas,3

Hayop Ka,"The animation in itself is already a huge feat for this film (and , consequently, Philippine cinema) but the story doesn’t seem fully fleshed out. There were scenes where the voice acting fell short, particularly the confrontation scene between Nimfa and Roger— I couldn’t quite call it dialogue because it really just felt like they were alternating aggressive monologues (there is a difference I swear)Anyway, I think the film is suffering from such tedious reviews given the anticipation it garnered before its release. Everyone’s got their eyes on it and we want it to be good. It was entertaining.",2
Hayop Ka,"Really impressive voice acting performances and funny animal puns. Also pretty interesting animation choices and styles. Other than that, everything else is meh. How I wish the story is more solid and has something bigger to say as the credits rolled",0
Hayop Ka,"The art is STUNNING. Saturated kung saturated sa puns at visual gags. I feel like alam naman nating lahat na wala dapat tularang character sa movie na to (except si Jerry at si manong sa Batangas!), plus the script of the movie itself. It's in the same vein as the ""nawawalang anak"" stereoype ng mga palabas. It's not meant to be taken seriously and I'm tired of Letterboxd's ""cancel dito cancel doon"" culture. It's a sakto lang movie for me.Edit: docking a half-star kasi sana mas naghanap sila ng mas bagay na voice actors. May certain voice para sa askal at sa poodle pero it ain't Robin and that girl.",6

Hayop Ka,"I can't take Hayop Ka! seriously because the main character has the same name as my mom (and me, kind of) and it's just pretty disturbing when they say her name during the sex scenes. But then, this film shouldn't be taken seriously in the first place. It's satirical and beyond raunchy. In short, the film is meant to be offensive. Nevertheless, the story and writing was very mediocre. They could've incorporated a better storyline. Also, the dialogue annoyed me so much that I kept cringing and making faces. The characters were dumb with no redeeming qualities. I'm kind of bummed because this had so much potential to be good. I actually wanted to give this a 2-star but changed my mind because the animation was incredible. Kudos to the Filipino animators! Overall, Hayop Ka! is pretty much an average film. I was so excited for this, but my expectations fell short. It's not that bad and it made me a laugh a bit, but there were several corny/cringey moments that I wanted to skip through. Even so, Filipino animation is looking really good so far!",5
Hayop Ka,ganda ng animation T________T walang palya hng,0
Hayop Ka,"Oh boy, here we go. Mostly a thought vomit, so be warned.The visuals and animation are world-class, hands down. But holy shit I wish they had a different script.The writing in itself is thematically flawed which would have been okay if it wasn't for the portrayal in itself. I appreciate the efforts of the film for tackling certain issues such as the woes of the working class, contractualization, and such. But who is this story for?Is it simply trying to portray the struggles of a modern working-class woman? Is this supposed to be a commentary for something bigger? Why does this film feel like it's an MMK episode with a high production value?I discussed this film with my boyfriend, and we both agreed that perhaps the target audience of this film is the masses and the working class. This is quite ironic because the film was released on Netflix (which caters to mostly the privileged people).Direction wise, boy I wish they hired professional VOs instead. The film would have been more bearable. The surprising delight for me is Sam Milby's performance as a VO. He's the only competent performance in the film for me.My main beef with the film is that it’s a very well made film with an awful story that perpetuates the system it wants to critique in the first place.Cheers, nonetheless to the hardworking artists behind this film. And may they invest in better writers instead.",0

The plot is representative of a good majority of Filipino films - classist, shallow, peddling mediocre mindsets all for the sake of comedy. If you look back on the story and how it was executed, none of the characters have any redeeming character traits. None. Not even in the main character. And that's so fucking sad to me that they were all painted to be some shallow mockery of a person, without any thoughts or feelings for other people. I love the Philippines but sometimes Philippine movies really suck. If someone, a better director or screenwriter, can hire these artists again to produce work that's meaningful and amusing and interesting, I would absolutely support the shit out of it.",2
Hayop Ka,"Pusang ina tong pelikulang to! (lol)If you look past the outdated story (that doesn't really aim to give substance, I feel), this gets really hilariously Pinoy with in all its raunchy kasabawan, though I wish it could have been about something else instead. The animation and sound are just top-notch, I'd watch it all over again just for that alone. And plus points for all the genius animal puns scattered all throughout the story.",6
Hayop Ka,i wouldn't have finished this if the animation wasn't nice .. it had a really messy plot (+ furry porn??),0
Hayop Ka,"Nice animations; unecessarily sexulized every single aspect of the story into a cheesy, sexist, and misogynistic clusterfuck. Embarrassing.",0
Hayop Ka,"Story and the characters were a mess. But still, the animation is still something to admire about this movie. So much attention to detail with the backgrounds too that in almost every scene, I wanted to read the animalised brand and establishment names. Btw, anyone catch what animal Jose Rizal was in this universe during the PetmaLuneta scene?",-1
Hayop Ka,Hilarious. I was laughing the whole time. Fun watch. Only complaint I have is I wish it were longer.,8
Hayop Ka,"all of these stars are for the animators because they deserve everything. every single scene i was in awe of how detailed it is. how they captured ph culture, the puns, the exaggeration lack of 1 star because of misogynistic tones and the overly sexual scenes. i must admit there were jokes that made me laugh, there were scenes that i liked but i feel like i can excuse the stereotypical love triangle plot for how great the animation is. i feel like they had to do something the masses are familiar with to attract them to watching pinoy animation films",4
Hayop Ka,props to the animators. that’s all i’ve got to say,0
Hayop Ka,"Even if this was probably intended to be satire, it wasn’t a very good one. Instead of critiquing, it seemed to embrace misogyny, abuse, classism, and other societal ills that it tried to touch upon. Similar to Rocket Sheep’s earlier production Saving Sally, the animation was just bogged down by....everything else.",0
Hayop Ka,1 star for animation,4
Hayop Ka,my 1 star rating is for the animation :(((( taena ang ganda kasi ng animation ang ganda ng animation oh my god ang ganda ng animation LANGsobrang cringe sa charscters pls lalo kay roger macho na in makes sense kasi si robin padilla nagboboses  di rin ako makapaniwala na ganun yung storyline lolZ what a waste... just support the movie for the animators,4
Hayop Ka,"Frankly, the visuals is impressive and enjoyable. BUT progress on the animation department should not have the story as trade-off. Always, the story should be the driving force.Not losing faith we're going to see a balanced local animated film in the future.",0
Hayop Ka,"This was so much fun to watch! From the art style, to the jokes, to all the punny Easter Eggs, a triumph for Philippine Animation!",2
Hayop Ka,"i am only disappointed with the fact that this could've been much more class conscious with how many tongue-in-cheek moments it had regarding labor unions, class antagonisms, etc which surprised me coming from something on netflix. seemed to be socially aware enough of telenovela tropes it tried to play off but not enough to subvert them to say something more meaningful, and i was definitely more invested in the world than any of the characters.",-1
Hayop Ka,Hayop ka is definitely offensive and vulgar but the lack of enthusiastic profanity and sustained laugh-to-gag ratio made the film flat and blasé. The film has too mature content to be enjoyed by the youth and too immature to be enjoyed by adult audience. It feels like it was written by a group of high school students and produced by their rich parents. The animators did a splendid job.,5
Hayop Ka,"except for the animation, i rlly can't say anything good about this movie",0
Hayop Ka,nasayang yung ganda ng animation dahil sa kwento,1
Hayop Ka,Five stars for the animation. Support the animators. Don't support the DDS.,4
Hayop Ka,Ang ganda ng art!!! Korny ng story lmaooo pati yung voice acting medyo awkward... pero ang ganda ng animation! Sana magkaroon pa ng mas madaming pelikulang lokal na animated tapos maganda na din story line at writing hehe  kudos din sa mga animators who worked hard on this!!! Nice one!,3
Hayop Ka,"better than Cats, I think",-1
Hayop Ka,the 2 stars are for the animation.,4
Hayop Ka,animators this star is for yall!!!,4
Hayop Ka,"As much as the visuals aim to impress, this is a film that is boggled down by a lack of substance and sensitivity. It could have tackled important issues (as it was trying to do), but it fails and in doing so, becomes another forgettable film that feels like it only exists in order to show that Philippine animation is improving. Sadly, this film might have just pulled down those hopes instead.",2
Hayop Ka,Im not a Furry but-,1
Hayop Ka,"Ayos 'yong animation ah. Overall, basura. Sobra-sobra pa 2 stars. Parang ito 'yong cartoons ng mga matatandang nanonood ng ika-anim na utos sa GMA 7.",3
Hayop Ka,"Rocketsheep Studios needs to stop hiring shitty writers. This is not going to convince a lot of people to support animation, if the thing that they're animating is crude, disgusting and reminiscent of the problems plaguing local entertainment.This movie is an amalgamation of everything familiar and stereotypical of an afternoon at a local TV channel: homewreckers, cheaters, exaggerated rich-poor conversations, and all the things regular viewers across the country seem to swoon over on the daily. The folks over at Rocketsheep seem to think that this makes for a passable idea in the animation department. Did it work? Yes. Do I like it? FUCK NO.If the goal of this cartoonish re-imagining of a soap opera is to drown it in cutely-drawn pastel-style animation interspersed with clear homages to GMA-7's Astig Authority (afternoon segments where international anime series are dubbed in Tagalog for local audiences), then congratulations, they're going to successfully hook in the support. But to explicitly juxtapose this advocacy of creative animation with the morally replete narratives of your average Philippine soap is just deplorable. What they're doing here, is making a statement that the only way to somehow succeed and get more support from everyone is to just get what already works for the masses. This isn't something I look forward to if the future of the industry is really dictated by the preposterous concept that is this movie.Put it this way, the story can just as easily be inserted as a real-life adaptation in the hands of grubby network executives. If independent studios like Rocketsheep are already behaving in the same manner when it comes to advocating the #SupportLocal mentality, then we have a big problem here.And for the love of god, DO NOT TELL ME THIS BULLSHIT IS SATIRE. Where is the humor? The dialogue is supposed to be funny? Jesus christ, none of the writers here can write for shit. The only way I found myself laughing here was when the animation took center stage over the story itself... which only happens when the film approaches the lewd and sleazy story developments that they're relying on. Everything else was just an entire cringe-fest left and right.",0
Hayop Ka,"the controversy.the plot per se is very wattpad-ish, telenovela-ish, and full of cliches. i detest as well how they sexualized the anthromorphic characters. the aspirations of this film are somewhat questionable—hoping they're aiming to really critique the depicted themes tho by satirical means. also don't get me started at the problematic cast; i prefer professional voice actors more than them. in spite all of these, this film's good animation doesn't genuinely deserve this problematic plot. cinematography was also greatttt. filipino animators and philippine creative industry truly deserve way better.",0
Hayop Ka,"Ganda ng kwenta, ang pangit ng kwento.",1
Hayop Ka,Ang ganda nung animation!!! Reminds me of Steven Universe at times.But the storyline (and yung dds na voice actor)? Basura. The puns were funny though.,-1
Hayop Ka,"Genuinely enjoyed the animation and the references that made in-universe Philippines vibrant and accurate. Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, my enjoyment ends there.Hayop Ka! tries to channel a bomba Zootopia, but bombs (heh) spectacularly. Terrible dialogue and story, and thematically reeks of Duterte's macho bullshit. So many missed opportunities for an actual animated bomba film that channels the hardships and miserable daily life under the current regime... What can you expect from a cast that leads Robin Padilla though? ",5
Hayop Ka,Ang landi nila lahat.,1
Hayop Ka,"Visually pleasing! Jokes and puns were nice, though sometimes dialogue felt forced and could be developed. This film could be more refined overall but I appreciate the effort and time to make this film.",0
Hayop Ka,I actually liked this. di magets ng iba na it was supposed to be a parody of pinoy bomba cliché plots. ano ba ineexpect niyo disney writing? tangina haters di naman gets.,6
Hayop Ka,"pretty, pretty animation and, in fair, several attempts to hint at our very real social issues were made. but as much as i would like to praise them for attempting to convey in Hayop Ka! what few other filipino filmmakers do these days, their failure to truly commit to becoming a satirical comedy makes me wish they never tried in the first place. 'yan hanap pa ng grant pero gusto lang talaga ""magpatawa"". nothing wrong with wanting to make people laugh, don't get me wrong, pero para pilitin mo na lang na magkabigat ang storya mo (without even making sure to properly represent the people you want to represent) para lang magka-grant at makagawa ng pelikula? dangerous and foolish.",-1
Hayop Ka,stars for the animation,4
Hayop Ka,"Can't say I didn't love the almost-seamless animation. It did show the somewhat grim reality of Filipino internalized misogynism and patriarchy, as well as the melodrama of being the unwilling breadwinner of the family, but there are some things in there (i.e. chastising a woman for wanting a better life for herself and her family) that did not quite sit well with me. Nevertheless, it was a good watch. Crude Filipino green jokes were made and though some of them a bit tasteless, they did make me laugh.",2
Hayop Ka,Bad storytelling. Outstanding visuals.,0
Hayop Ka,"Thoroughly enjoyed the puns as a member of a wordplay-loving nation but you didn't have to gloss over the toxic aspects (gossip, teenage pregnancy, misogyny) of our culture like that; it's getting such a bad rapNetflix",-1
Hayop Ka,hindi ko alam anong maf-feel sa plot tbh..... parang hindi kasi naempower yung female character tas.... ewan basta malabo yung plot kasi parang i found it hard to emphathize w any of the characters. PERO ANG GANDA NG ANIMATION YUN TALAGA I GUESS sayang lang kasi kulang yung kwento eh :(,3
Hayop Ka,1 star para sa creators. Half star kasi natawa ako ng unti. Kung gusto ko lang naman maging furry uulitin ko nalang Zootopia. Okay naman animation pero yung story pang teleserye na hindi mahohook ang nanay ko.,3
Hayop Ka,"You know all those Filipino children's books we've all read during grade school? Hayop Ka! perfectly captures the warm aesthetic they hold. It really rewards you for speaking Tagalog with its jokes and Easter Eggs, I watched it with English subtitles (I'm not that good in Tagalog) and it's blatant that the translations weren't that good to me, it didn't really capture the full essence of the original dialogue and weakens any non-speaking viewer's experience. I can't blame them though, Tagalog isn't the easiest thing to translate, especially with the contextual jokes used. I'm not fond of the story at all, could've been a lot better. I wanted a lot more awareness to it outside of just a few second scenes on the side. Still, it's a big step for Philippine Animation and I hope we get better things more out of it.",-1
Hayop Ka,"This is the biggest ""What the Fuck"" movie I have ever seen. Cat woman faces the consequences of her terrible actions. Like the damn main character is such a ... that it makes me laugh every time she burns a bridge. This is so fucking wild. Is this what soap operas are like? Holy shit. I *genuinely* enjoy this trainwreck. This was so captivating I found it hard to look away. A part of me can't believe this movie is even real. What am I? Hoooly shit.",0
Hayop Ka,i expected more but that's as far as netflix can give,-1
Hayop Ka,Must be my first Filipino film. Didn’t know it at first and I was quite surprised it is,2
Hayop Ka,"What the. I don’t know kung paano pinipitch yung mga ganitong films.Fifty Shades of Grey, but with a children’s cartoon aesthetic? Complete with an ultra rich attractive man who took his lady to his mansion and flew around in a helicopter? Sad to say that it’s hard to be proud of what my fellow Filipino artists have accomplished when they come up with stories like these.But I am not going to entirely sh!t on the film because this film really did carve out a unique art style, and I really have to commend that. It looked notably distinct- it’s not Japanese nor western. What I really like about Makoto Shinkai’s animated films is that he tries to emulate real world Tokyo; and that is also what I felt like they tried to do in this film with Metro Manila.The storyline, on its very core, is just really pointless. Again, I don’t know how you pitch these films to producers. On top of its ridiculous story, the dialogues are just childish. The way they try to sexualize everything; it’s not even worth a single chuckle, but a facepalm. To complement the annoying childish sexual jokes, we also have the annoying voice acting; even with a cast of well known celebrities.Cheating. Misogyny. Gold Digging. Sex. Sex and sex lahat. Hays. I very much respect the animation and their effort to do something unique; and for that it’s not completely zero.",2
Hayop Ka,a) Plot/Storyb) Charactersc) Screenplayd) Cinematography - e) Genre/Theme - The animation is nice and fun.,0
Hayop Ka,the only reason i’ll add this to my fave is because my friends are part of this production HAHAHA,-1
Hayop Ka,"I feel bad for the animators, the writers ruined this visually appealing cartoon.",0
Hayop Ka,"Really enjoyed the animation style, designs, background details, even the randomly hilarious fighting and sex scenes. Did not enjoy any of the main characters or care about what they did. They did not have any redeeming qualities about them. Rich guy is a privileged cheating bastard who is against unions, Roger can be sweet but also lazy/irresponsible, and careless when it comes to his partner. Nimfa is exactly what the radio host said, an extremely flawed and guilty person. She…",-1
Hayop Ka,"WTF?! sayang yung animation, ang ganda. Pero sobrang trashy nung story. 1 star for animation. Is it Satire? I don't think so.",6
Hayop Ka,"Great animation, poor plot and script. The great animation cannot cover the fact that the plot is bland and have already been portrayed in hundreds of Pinoy mainstream movies. Filipinos can do better than this.",2
Hayop Ka,the art and animation is A++ im really happy a lot of independent artists got to work on it. its a win for a rise in local animated films. but its the way this film's plot and script tried to hit so many marks and missed all of them for me. how do you throw 5000 knives and stab everything but the apple. gives you a feeling of 'so what was the point' by the ending. also that part where piolo pascual was like alam mo kung bat nimfa pangalan mo??? kasi nyMPHOMANIAC KA >>>:(((((((((( GRRRR i wanted to die,6
Hayop Ka,Ganda ng animation pero ang kalat ng kwento.,0
Hayop Ka,"Bad writing. Problematic and cringey, naiinis lang ako everytime naririnig ko boses ni Robin. 1 star for the animation, It was splendid but the story was meh. Cute den yung spoof sa local brands, tawang-tawa ako sa Jolibog.",6

Hayop Ka,"Let me get this straight first. I haven't watched this movie, and the only way you'll make me see this movie is if my viewing of the movie will not support the movie in any way.I'm writing this review right now to post my stance regarding this movie.I am all for supporting local animation studios, but my support will never come in the form of blind support. We've already heard the stories and news everywhere of Robin Padilla being casted as a character in the movie and while I do not support Robin Padilla in any way, his casting isn't what doesn't sit right with me.What doesn't sit right with me is the fact that Joyce Bernal is one of the producers of the film. For the ill informed, Joyce Bernal is a D/D/S director who is the director behind all of D/utert/e's SONAs (among some other terrible movies that she's also directed). Not only that, but Piolo Pascual is also a producer. While Piolo Pascual hasn't directly come out as a supporter of D/utert/e, he has previously worked with Joyce Bernal on a project in support of D/utert/e, and that makes him an enabler. So, we now have three D/D/S supporters/enablers involved with the movie. THAT'S what doesn't sit right with me. Surely there are other producers or actors they could've approached?I will never support the art or the creative works created by or produced/financed by supporters of this horrible administration and nor bootlickers who try to act ""apolitical"" despite being enablers themselves.Again, I am for the support of the works of local animation studios, but should that support come blindly all in the name of ""support lokal""?",-1
Hayop Ka,"Después de haber aprendido acerca de su controversial estreno en Tailandia además de ser su primer gran largometraje animado me corroía el morbo de verla. Admito que azota temas delicados por lo que a muchos no congeniarán en su totalidad, su trama es sencilla, predecible y básicamente no existe algo de empatía para su protagonista; vaya incluso los amoríos tienen mejor desarrollo... o por lo menos hasta el final.Aún se puede beneficiar de su gran calidad en su dibujo y arte, espero nos den más proyectos por delante. Pese a momentos de sobredramatismo opacando su lado serio, tengo que admitir que fue una agradable hora y once minutos en donde su mundo, uno que otro buen chiste y un maravilloso grupo de actores de voz salvan dicho proyecto.Pero si... ella es una completa Perra!!... ... en el sentido figurado.",2
Hayop Ka,please....rocketsheep.......hire better writers,6
Hayop Ka,"This raunchy exotica adult animation perfectly embodies the street-smart cadence of a Pinoy conversation and generously sprinkles it with humor and absurdity. Colloquialism at its finest - the script is relatable and funny, the narrative truly Filipino, and the visuals reminds us that this is made in our own country. I was about to comment on the cliché plot of adultery but decided not to ponder on it and just support this local product.",2
Hayop Ka,"I wasn’t planning on writing reviews when i made a letterboxd account. I just wanted to lurk, read reviews, check out people’s lists, stalk user profiles and yes, read every single review to every movie I directed because i like crying myself to sleep at night. But after watching hayop ka and reading the reviews here, i was compelled to write something. Because i don’t get why people hate it so much. For me, it’s a dark comedy that tackles realities of class and socio-economic disparity in the Philippines. Nimfa’s problem is simple: she’s poor. She has to break her back working as a saleslady to pay for her sister’s tuition and pay rent, she has pares to look forward to during special occasions because that’s all she and her boyfriend could afford, she can’t even go to a motel for some sexy time. This isn’t necessary a problem except for one thing: Nimfa is dissatisfied. She is not happy with her situation. She wants more. But what can she do? She didn’t graduate and it’s very likely that she’ll be a saleslady forever. So can you really blame her when she “falls” for Iñigo? A handsome rich guy who showers her with attention? If you were in her situation, wouldn’t you? I would. So she makes one bad choice after another. Should we hate her for it? What would we rather see? Tanggapin nalang niya yung buhay niyang ganun? Ok lang yang pares ghorl masarap naman. Beauty in poverty ganun? She sees a way out, and she grabs it. I am not entirely happy with her choice but i understand why she did it. Eh sa sawa nang maging mahirap ’yung tao e. The bad choices that Nimfa makes are greatly influenced by her circumstances, circumstances that are forced upon her because she is poor. Yes cliche. Yes lagi nalang mahirap/mayaman storyline but maybe there’s a reason why the boss-katulong trope(the powerful loving the powerless) works so well in our country. Maybe it’s because most of us Filipinos still see that as the only means of escape.And hayop ka lays bare that truth: If you’re poor, falling in love out of economic need is very much a reality. This truth is prevalent in our narratives, even if they aren’t explicitly stated. Some top of mind examples are Laida Magtalas falling in love with sir Miggy(A very special love) or Maya with Sir Chief(be careful with my heart). Fuck i’m old The difference in hayop ka is that it does away with romantics and explicitly states, with ice cold pragmatism: I am in love with you because I am poor, because you are my best option to escape this life. It’s tragic how in the world presented in hayop ka, genuine romantic love is a privilege for the rich.And another note, can i just say that the art direction is fucking gorgeous. Making drawings move is an expensive and time-consuming affair and you have to find ways to get your point across in as few frames as possible. Hayop ka borrows some techniques from Japanese animation which it uses brilliantly and comically. Future animations will surely use this film as a reference.-1 half star lang pala for too much sexual jokes. Not that im offended or anything and i’m totally fine with women exhibiting the same sexual libido and desire as men, it’s just that there were too many and most of them weren’t funny. -1 half star ulit for the ending with empoy the frog. I get that the film had to end on a somewhat lighthearted note, after it literally kicked rich prince charming out the window, mejo corny lang yung promo ng walang ka paris and laughter laughter. Other than that, methinks this is a solid film that illustrates the relationship that exist between class and love. Aesthetically, this is an important milestone in local animation and will surely be used as a peg by future similar project.Tang ina 5 na amf. Dami ko sinabi wala namang babasa.

Hayop Ka,"Liongoren's Hayop Ka! is a tongue-in-cheek and provocative 2D animated film seen from the perspective of proletariat catwoman Nimfa Dimaano, as she finds herself slowly loosening her morals in desperate exchange of economic indemnity. The film is deceptively simple, but functions intelligently to provide a scathing representation of the cyclical, problematic lives of the working class Filipino: their desensitisation to the methods they cling onto for their own economic benefit, the internalized sexist and especially misogynistic paradigm that remains hegemonic among both Filipino men and women, and how all this disturbingly becomes the mundanity of everyday life in a third-world country. Moreover, although the narrative might simply appear as an animated rehash of what has plagued local TV for years, it cleverly utilizes these teleserye tropes to construct a sociological examination on capitalism's destruction to society; more specifically, to the Filipinos that belong to the lower end of the social strata. Past the painfully realistic reconstruction of the plight of the working class in film, the portrayal on the bourgeoisie is also excellently handled; they're cruel and selfish, despite the already comfortable lives that they live. Hence, the anthropomorphism of these animals becomes a clever display of how capitalism has made literal animals out of us— easily succumbing to carnal desires and almost devoid of empathy.Aside from the thematic complexity of Hayop Ka!, the meticulously beautiful animation is extremely noteworthy as well. Sadly, this film has been misread by most of its viewers— its intelligent writing and thematic complexity ignored due to its vulgar, yet realistically absurd humor. Needless to say, Hayop Ka! is up there thematically, and can even suffice to be the lovechild of two classics that eloquently critique capitalism: last year's Parasite, and 1962 Mexican film The Exterminating Angel. Definitely one of the year's best!",5
Hayop Ka,animation was really cool :// kaso yun nga ://,-1
Hayop Ka,"i liked this better than saving sally, but as much as i wanted to believe that the writers were self-aware enough to make a story that seems to poke fun at typical love triangle/adultery tropes in philippine cinema/telenovelas... the pay-off of this film really broke that optimistic belief in me.the animation is better than saving sally though, so there's that.",2
Hayop Ka,"the credits sequence was more interesting than the actual movie :[ if this is meant to be satirical, man i really did NOT get that from the way this was written. as with many of the reviews on here i think the animation saved this, but it seems a little wasted on a script prioritizes punchlines over story.",0

Hayop Ka,this movie is so horny it's not even funny,9
Hayop Ka,"Typical story (which isn't bad by itself) but the jokes seems too far apart for me to enjoy the campiness of the movie. Or maybe it's just because of Robin Padilla's voice which annoyed me. In paper, he's a good pick (if you ignore his political views) since he's a good fit for the common macho Filipino. But I just can't help to shake the vibe that it's not coming from a place of humor when you hear his voice call a woman a pokpok because she slept with another man. Overall experience is not really good but animation and the visual jokes gives it an extra star.",2

Hayop Ka,Plus points for the well rendered animation and unique art style...but that script though. Half the entire thing were sex jokes. Story and characters lacked any kind of depth besides being horny all the time. Angelica Panginiban is a good voice actress.,-1
Hayop Ka,Parang trip lang nila maghasa ng animation skills.,3
Hayop Ka,Watch Aggretsuko S2 it's pretty much the same but better,-1
Hayop Ka,i expected a lot from this movie (much like saving sally) but i think it's time for me to accept that rocketsheep studio only knows how to make movies *look* pretty,0
Hayop Ka,"2019 gave us DEAD KIDS. 2020 gave us HAYOP KA. And funnily enough just like last year, I find myself in the minority who enjoyed this.There have been polarizing opinions surrounding the film's true colors: Is it a satire on the Philippines' kitsch, recycled plotlines for film and TV? Or is it just a complete piece of trash poorly dressing up as a story? I'm inclined towards the former, but I hear the latter's argument.Like DEAD KIDS, I think it's important (if you want an enjoyable watch) to see the film for what it is: Pure entertainment. It doesn't have to be deep unless you want it to. Personally, Nimfa Dimaano's story ain't that deep. It truly felt like I was just listening to an anon's juicy anecdote on some love advice radio segment, which the film was loosely based on and have the faintest clue of.The animation more than makes up for the storyline as it offsets the trashiness with charming visuals. Good job for local animators!And the voice actors were really good and well-cast. They brought out the personalities of the characters that they were portraying especially Angelica Panganiban's Nimfa.Overall, I think some people need to chill out a bit though I understand the frustration. It's not the history-making Filipino animated film that a lot of us wanted, but be glad that it's there and the doors it can open.",2
Hayop Ka,2.0 Stars,4
Hayop Ka,OKAY HEAR ME OUT!!! It’s actually better than I expected,-1
Hayop Ka,"'Hayop Ka' very clearly has a wide display of talented artists and designers at the helm of it and it is an admirable attempt at pushing Filipino animation, but the end result is an uncomfortable, bitter story that I am not in the target demographic for. Before I actually go into this narrative I do want to say that even though I don't like the movie as a whole, there is very clearly a lot of talent being put…",5
Hayop Ka,two stars for the animation alone. ang basura ng kwento nakaka-sayang.,4
Hayop Ka,"For all its faults, the animation and Angelica Panganiban's charm shines through in this movie. The story is typical for a Filipino romcom but seeing it as animated raunchy animals just brings a novelty that helps you get past those frames. There are also a lot of cute/funny easter eggs, reminiscent of the 2nd Shrek movie, that makes you want to catch all of them. Plus I do appreciate the blasé inclusion of sex in the adult relationships instead of the Filipino penchant of dancing around.",-1
Hayop Ka,"Don't get me wrong, the animation, music, and sound of this film are phenomenal. But the story tho is where it gets me. First, the story could be stretched out for another 20 mins to further flesh out the story; for me, it is too short. Next, Roger wasn't held responsible for their child in the end. Lastly, the nice-guy-finish-last idea that is implied at the end of the film is so unnecessary; it came out of nowhere with only…",0
Hayop Ka,"Pusang ina.I see the filmmaker's passion for this project. this type of animation is a breath of fresh air in the Philippine cinema industry. While the animation excels, the writing and story fall flat.We get a cliche storyline, filled with mediocre dialogue and writing. I did enjoy some jokes here and there, but those are just one-liners. We did feel for the main character's struggles and place in the film's world. But again, the depiction feels a bit off. Everyone around her aren't accountable and paints Nimfa as the antagonist.",2
Hayop Ka,"I’ve probably just got put on some blacklist just for watching this. Let me tell you, if that’s the case, then it was not worth it.",-1
Hayop Ka,"They should have cast real voice actors. Still kudos to the animators, and the team behind this production.",7
Hayop Ka,"I could've written a longer review for this, but I'll save it for some time. While it is a big step for local animation, it is a misstep when it comes to storyline.",0
Hayop Ka,"ang ganda sana, kaso hindi. tbh, maganda animation. the art style is gr8t pero the plot and all, wala",-1
Hayop Ka,"I didn't recognize the voices of Piolo, Moira, Arci. Such a star studded cast.",-1
Hayop Ka,"Telenovelas desensitized me to the point I enjoyed this film. Great Animation and background art, but the characters are just telenovela characters all over again, but this time it’s interesting cuz’ they’re FURRIES.",-1
Hayop Ka,"Despite the bad reviews I really enjoyed watching this film. It brings nostalgia from my childhood years. Most people don't like the way it's satirical and say the plot was pretty bad but I guess if you grew up in the lower class life (like me) with Filipino telenovelas as a part of your everyday life and environment, everything about this film is actually really fucking funny. I love the dialogues and the way the voice fit the personality of the characters so well. I laughed a lot of times in this film and besides that the animation was really good as well. I'd say people might have not enjoyed the way it's satirical and funny because they might have not really experienced growing up in an environment where filipino telenovelas were the only tv shows you could watch. I appreciate the film a lot.",2
Hayop Ka,"the animation style of this film reigns superior >>> (please make more films that look like this)(but please make less films if they’re gonna sound the way this film did) Even if I saw a post talking about how “this film was clearly a very self-aware satire that doesn’t deserve the hate it’s getting for it’s misogynistic screenplay”, I don’t think they were able to make that distinction clear enough for most audiences to understand, which I’d say is a pretty bad move. And sad too. I’m not saying it sucked. But it could’ve been way better. This film, and everything about it had so much potential, especially with the amount of people who were excited to watch it, before it was released. Welp! Back to watching animated animal short films on Vimeo instead!",0
Hayop Ka,Huge fan of animation and the animation for this film is super nice. I love the jokes/details hidden in the background. Story is typical. It’s not a groundbreaking story but I think there are worse things out there. I enjoy watching films that I really don’t need to think too hard for me to enjoy it. The movie is pretty okay for me at first but is kind of like a train wreck by the end of it there and I don’t know whether I am satisfied or not.Do I want to know more about what happens next? No. Maybe next time there is a big shot animation film it would be better.,-1
Hayop Ka,"when nimfa threw the plates at her sister and their mom said ""kakahugas ko lang niyan"" :-( </3",1
Hayop Ka,"Okay, I don't get why people shit on this movie as if it has no merit at all. Its humor is impeccably Filipino. The animation is a great leap from earlier PH animated films. The sound overlay is crisp and clear as well. And holy fuck, there's action!The themes, while questionable, were rousing in their own right. The ingrained stiffness of social mobility, how shaming of women persists and perpetuates, how children are perceived as living investments. Also, interesting denouement and resolution.",-1
Hayop Ka,"i enjoyed the animation, the details in the art, the references, the puns, and…that’s it.",0
Hayop Ka,"While the animation is great and the animators deserve recognition, the film itself was a weird flipflop between plots and was a bit too fast or slow in some scenes. Despite being Filipino myself, I never cared for the telenovelas that were constantly on TV, so this film doesn’t really stick to me. However, this could be the potential start of more original Filipino animations being produced, as well as animation as a whole being taken more seriously here in the Philippines. That being said, the film was still “meh” to me....But there was a hot anthropomorphic bunny so I’ll give it that.",2
Hayop Ka,"Gorgeous animation and interesting commentaries on the hypocrisies and two-faced-ness of Filipino society. Had a lot of fun watching this one as I knew what to expect from the trailer. And can I just say, whoever did the backgrounds...Kudos to you guys, whew.Character development is where this film falls terribly short. I get that the whole thing was a satire on the Filipino teleserye, but eventually, you need to create characters we can root for. ""Hayop Ka"" has no one to root for and everyone to despise. The goals of each character were incredibly shallow and in the end you just hope they all get what's coming to them. The ""happy"" ending was definitely forced and undeserved.In spite of my criticisms, I do not think this film deserves the backlash it's getting. It's a very admirable effort and it can serve as an important stepping stone for future, superior animated films in this country. So no, don't boycott this film just because you disagree with its morals (it's not supposed to be for kids in the first place) or because it features a voice actor whose politics are against yours. Animation in this country is still trying to get back on its feet and while there's a lot of story improvement that could be done in this film, it's a good start, nonetheless.In short, eye candy with plot that could be way better.",2
Hayop Ka,"I don't understand why some people here on Letterboxd hated this movie. Honestly, I thought it was really funny. Loved the cool animation, the colorful art style, the clever dialogue, the anime-inspired fight scenes, and the numerous cultural references that only true Filipinos will get. Sure, Robin Padilla (who plays Roger in the movie) is an asshole for supporting our very controversial president, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't watch it just because he's in it. Gotta show some love and respect to the animators and to the people who worked very hard to make this movie possible. They truly deserve it. Really love seeing animated movies from my home country, the Philippines.",2
Hayop Ka,Sayang lang yung animation and puns sa basurang narrative.,3
Hayop Ka,this has a special place in my heart for reasons i don't have the luxury to explore just yet,1
Hayop Ka,this movie is literally the fucking “ i will survive “ zootopia comic meme that happened like 4 years ago,9
Hayop Ka,nimfa literally didnt deserve anything good to her shes such a bitch she didnt deserve a happy ending,-1
Hayop Ka,"liked the art style, not the (very generic) storyempoy saved the film for me. give him lead roles!!",-1
Hayop Ka,"So, I was watching this movie; Hayop Ka! (in translation 'You Are an Animal!', a profanity meaning of ""you son of a bitch!"") or simply 'You Animal!' that I've recently heard about with sum peeps on a friend's Discord server and gotta say, it's pretty alright as far as it being an animated movie of furs that's adult-oriented, especially one that is of the fairly typical two-sided romance story of a everyday common girl and guy are happy together until the slick handsome millionaire comes and steals the limelight from him, she becomes induced to her, they hook up for a bit, he isn't as crackup to what she thought he was, he leaves her, she mourns, both her and the former boyfriend meet up and try to patch things of forming feelings for each other once more, they both work together of opening up a family business and everything's all lovey-dovey in the end, plotline; you know, something that's supposedly common in the Philippine movie industry. As what one of my friends said it the best on his Twitter, think of it as a movie adaption of the 'I Will Survive' Zootopia fan comic. The story may not be the best but I do gotta give huge props to the people of the Filipino-based 'Rocketsheep Studio' for embracing a bright and colorful, yet smooth cartoony look that ultimately works well with what it's given to work with.",5
Hayop Ka,"Congrats, Netflix... I don’t hate you... As much",-1
Hayop Ka,"Hayop Ka! es una película animada para adultos de Filipinas, cuyo título vendría a ser un insulto, algo así como ""eres un animal"" o ""eres un hijo de puta"". Este es el primer filme animado para adultos que ha creado este país, por lo que eso de por sí merece un reconocimiento. La película trata de un trío amoroso entre una gata, nuestra protagonista, y dos perros, uno pobre y otro millonario. Dicho sea desde ya que, a mi parecer, la historia es el punto débil de la película, suele caer en territorios clichés melodramáticos que se han visto miles de veces; sin embargo, aún así tiene un buen ritmo y sus personajes son expresivos y cómicos y logran sacar adelante la trama.Donde Hayop Ka! se luce por completo es en su trabajo de animación. La película es hermosa visualmente, en especial los diseños de los fondos, los cuales son coloridos y llenos de detalles. También hay momentos donde la animación cambia repentinamente y esto le aporta un estilo particular y buen humor. Eso sí, claramente hay algunos guiños presentes que sólo un filipino podrá entender.En términos generales, estoy más o menos en la mitad con esta película. Desearía que su historia hubiera tenido un poco más de peso, pero me encantó su visualidad, su humor, y las interacciones entre sus personajes, hay un buen trabajo de voces aquí. Por lo que al final yo inclino mi balanza para el lado positivo.",5
Hayop Ka,"You know...I love me some furry shit. Like, BEASTARS, Aggretsuko, Brand New Animal, Zootopia, etc etc (but that doesn’t mean I’m a furry...ok ?) . But my thoughts for this movie, it was...not good ? But not bad either. I mean The story was ok and pretty adult (talking bout sex, relationships, lower class and upper class stuff, betrayal, and uhh...pregnancy). The characters were alright, nothing that stand out too much. The ending was kinda rushed, weird, and not satisfying enough. But Despite all of these, I thought the animation looks very good! . Overall it wasn’t a good furry movie but it’s not fully bad.",0
Hayop Ka,bakit don umikot yung istorya ,1
Hayop Ka,The animation was good. The story was a cliche though,0
Hayop Ka,"The animation was really good (sans some awkward movement in some scenes), love the work when it comes to the character designs and especially the backgrounds as it really makes the movie's world shine I also got some cheap laughs from the random sexual jokes all throughout (sorry not sorry)thing is, none of the main cast of characters aren't good people by any means (except for the frog who tells corny jokes), and as a result, the story is just yikessI get it's a satire but u got to at least have brains and a heart either way, this movie's just meh, but I applaud the animators for pouring their hearts out, so 90% of the rating is bc of it[available in Netflix PH]",0
Hayop Ka,"this animation film might set a boundary to the Philippine animation industry. each scene is greatly animated; it does resonate a huge sarcasm on the ""normal-soap-opera-ish"" story that keeps on repeating on the Philippine cinema. I do hope we get more animated films made locally!",2
Hayop Ka,"Have waited for this film since one of its earliest teasers were out. Got around to watch it this day with adjusted expectations considering the political climate (not only of the country but also the stance of the attached producers and a lead actor) and my personal view of the studio's previous effort Saving Sally (2016).It plays out as a telenovela/teleserye/soap opera with themes of infidelity. The greatest standout is the animation and design even with a vague story in the background that is a lot more interesting than the main story (endo, abortion, labor strikes, etc.) Which is kind of expected as the Philippines is one of the major places of outsourcing in a lot of known animated projects (film, video games, visual effects).The voice acting is fine but could be better either with a good voice cast director or hiring the professional dubbers (which is also a rising industry here but lack of support and recognition over popular celebrities).The decision to make the cast anthropomorphic animals is likely to avoid an uncanny valley feeling. Though I also saw it as playing with their strengths as one of the strengths of Saving Sally was its monster/creature designs. Though it doesn't make a difference here if they did it with human figures anyway. Anyway, I still would recommend to anyone to give this a chance especially for the work of the animators and other just as essential crew.",0
Hayop Ka,It's a fun film but it has so many awkward moments,0
Hayop Ka,"Simple, charming, and funny. Support Filipino media!",2
Hayop Ka,"As always, pretty and commendable animation could never be saved by horrible storytelling, subpar voice acting and horrendous/tasteless jokes. What was the point of making this film anyway? To prove that a romance between two cheaters could make an intriguing concept?The narrative itself was already borderline predictable and it still managed to shit on itself, causing everything to go further downhill by the third act. Also, fuck whoever thought of making this film another misogynistic, classist, love-triangle adultery-is-a-must type of bullshit. I am genuinely SICK of these kinds of Filipino movies. Kailangan talaga puro kabalbalan, kabastusan, kalandian, at pandaraya ang laman ng kwento para bumenta sa Pinoy? Tanginang mga ‘to. Kayo ang patuloy na nagpapabobo sa Pilipinong manonood.Add to that, this film has no proper conclusion. Nothing happens to any of the characters by the end of this trainwreck. Hopeless and infuriating.1 full star goes to all the animators, editors and sound designers who put in the REAL WORK for this film.",0
Hayop Ka,the artists who made this deserve a lot and they really deserve a story worth telling,-1
Hayop Ka,I really wanted to come out of this heaping praises on the film for its incisive social commentary and for its hilarious satire of the Filipino telenovela industry but instead I‘ve been left with the sinking feeling that I should have just read a book to bed instead.I wasn’t a fan of Saving Sally either so maybe Avid Liongoren’s films are just not for me. In fact I just re-read my Saving Sally review from 4 years ago and realized that almost all my issues (and even what I enjoyed) with that one persist quite strongly for Hayop Ka! as well so I’ll just link that review here.,0
Hayop Ka,"Gorgeous animation doesn't necessarily have to come with mostly unsympathetic characters, but... well, it does here.",0
Hayop Ka,"Hahahaha, wala, inenjoy ko lang yun kacornyhan. Mababaw lang naman kaligayahan ko. Tsaka syempre, nakainom ako nung pinanuod ko to.",1

Hayop Ka,Full of libido,1

Hayop Ka,this one star belongs to angelica panganiban and angelica panganiban only,4
Hayop Ka,"i'm a sucker for 2d animation, so i was very impressed how this one turned out. it's the story and the characters that don't sit right with me. like i don't get that Iñigo (Nimfa's sugar daddy) get sooo shallow at the end. when at first his mom said that she wants grand kids and he was all 'ok sure' he even took Nimfa to meet her, and to him to just casually agree to have like a threesome realationship…",-1
Hayop Ka,pang mmk yung story pero oks na. this movie proves that the local industry is more than capable of making a name for itself rather than just being outsourced by bigger international sharks in the industry,-1
Hayop Ka,"ang galing ng animation bwakanang shet kaso sayang yung narrative - nag-empower lang ito ng patriarchy. satire daw? ang nakita ko lang nasatire dito ay yung name play ng mga extra characters, ads, at yung title sana pero hindi nagamit ng maayos ang satirical value ng title at yung ""satirical"" element ""daw"" ng film. hayop",3

Hayop Ka,bro wtf was that i was so uncomfortable the whole time,-1
Hayop Ka,"Wtf did I just watch....?I was going to go with a 1-star rating for this because in my personal system, that means the piece is ""a waste of my time."" But good thing I was multi-tasking and getting some work done while this was playing in the background so I really didn't feel like I wasted any time. So, yeah, because of my never-ending workload, this got bumped up to 1 1/2 stars, which just means ""very bad"". Lol.This is all just to say––DON'T WATCH IT. It is disgusting. The beautiful animations maaaay be worth it (?) but I was jumping from feeling nauseous and horrified and, yeah, I have no energy to be eloquent for this. Just skip it.",-1

Hayop Ka,"  ,    3    .",1
Hayop Ka,"I love the idea of this animation but other than that, there was nothing redeeming factor out of this film. While it is certainly entertaining, it was out of the expense of proliferating the idea that women should be good at choosing their partners. Nothing good can come out of passionate love life and good guys are around if you look hard enough. The jokes and the puns found around the environment was funny at first but soon gets tiresome as they are unoriginal.It does look like a kind of film that some fans of the supreme leader would love.",0
Hayop Ka,"quite amusing to watch although may mga scenes na nawiwindang ako kasi nagbabanggit sila ng ""tao"" referring to themselves hahaha",3

Di ko tuloy ma-align nang tama feelings ko abt dun sa infidelity dahil di ko masymphatize yung character lol tsaka bat parang ginangster yung ending, na mema na lang at minadali... anlabo menang ganda na sana and promising, gusto ko yung premise kaso problematic yung portrayal",3
Hayop Ka,"this is concrete proof that once the Philippines' film industry starts taking artists and writers seriously (and paying them right!) that good movies like this are possible. as a Filipino, i've only been blown away by a few local animations in my whole existence and that's because most of it are either poorly created or have stories that lack depth. this is not the creators' faults though, because there is little to none moral and financial support from production companies enough to bring out the full potential of local filmmakers. major props to the creators behind the scenes whose efforts have been visibly seen throughout the film. obviously, the animation for this is the movie's strongest suit and the attention to detail whilst incorporating humor is purely amazing! the story on the other hand, is molded from the current Filipino culture thus there is a familiarity towards it and it appeals to its targeted audience. if you're a foreigner, you won't be able to understand all the inside jokes but you'll be able to comprehend enough of what the country and the people are like, even if it's portrayed as an anthropomorphic society.",-1
Hayop Ka,"It was quite good and the animation is great. The movie tackles the current social issue today. It also has a moral lesson that can apply to everyone. I was also amazed when the Filipino voice actors did a great job and also, to their jokes in their dialogues.",2

Hayop Ka,Would be 5 stars if the frog had more screen time,4

Hayop Ka,"i honestly just watched this to support local artists and animators, but i never expected more from its plot considering what happened with the plot of saving sally lol. plot's so bad, but it was portrayed humorously. the way Philippines could produce more local animated movie with good content, if only there is enough support and funding for local animators. the stars are for the animators.",2
Hayop Ka,it's everything i expected and didn't expect at the same time,0
Hayop Ka,"I honestly think Filipino movies need more animated films, we really have a lot of talented Filipino animators that are up to par with Hollywood animators, you know. The animation is truly beautiful. This film is raunchy and oozing with sexiness. Who knew animals could be so sexy? And most importantly, it is extremely hilarious. I was totally entertained watching this.",2
Hayop Ka,Redeeming factor lang nito yung animation tsaka yung shigidi shigidi shapopo. Natatawa na lang ako sa ubod ng misogyny nito.,3
Hayop Ka,the only things that kept me watching were the visuals and animal puns. had to watch with the english dub because i couldn't stand r****'s voice. the animation was great. everything else was ehhh,0
Hayop Ka,animation is superbbbb! I don't get the hate about this film. The plot may be the usual Pinoy drama plot but Nimfa got what she deserved in the ending.,-1
Hayop Ka,"it had some funny lines, but overall, it’s eh. the plot is kinda messy. liked the animation tho.",0
Hayop Ka,"This was a weird one. Who is the target audience of this? It’s supposed to be adult, but that’s mostly in the form of a bunch of dick jokes. The romantic love triangle made me think the target audience was women, but it gets awfully preachy near the end. But the setting is novel and its short, so it has that going for it.",0
Hayop Ka,the animation and art style the plot and the voice acting ,-1
Hayop Ka,im giving it 4 stars for the animation bc the artists dont deserve this 2.5-star average ,4
Hayop Ka,"You have no idea the effort I put in to actually watch this, and I can't really recommend it to anybody else - an animated film with spot-on Cartoon Network aesthetics, relentless sex jokes, and a setting (Metro Manila) where I spent a lot of my formative years. Clearly, this work was calling me.So let me make this plain: this film's sexual and gender politics are - put charitably - regressive. The humor is largely juvenile, with not a single innuendo left unsaid. And the story is propelled by thoroughly unlikable characters.But... I was ultimately entertained. A large part of that was just pure nostalgia for the Phillipines, getting to see all signifiers I remembered (The Supermall! Jeepnies!) and several I forgot (the wire mesh displays for drinks, holy shit!) The animation and design are lovely, but are helped by some truly genius visual comedy and meme references. And for as selfish as our protagonists are, I thought their motives made sense. The story may go full soap opera, but at least it's never boring.From what I've seen on Letterboxd, most of the reviews compliment the film's look but criticize it for perpetuating tropes of clasism and misogyny that are apparently well-represented in Filipino media. For all the time I spent living there, I never really watched much that was locally made, and am only vaguely familiar with the craziness that has been going on with the current government.As a piece of satire, I thought this worked. But, I'm also not the smartest guy I know.",0
Hayop Ka,The animation and voice acting (tho I hate robin in this he does an ok job ig) is a very good one but the plot is written very poorly. I was expecting something good Kasi the visuals are really fine ://.,0

Hayop Ka,y’all r so mean,1
Hayop Ka,Letterboxd and Twitter people hate this so much haha but this is a work of art - from the animation down to the simple and obviously satirical story. Loved every minute of it!,0
Hayop Ka,I was really drawn to it as soon as it entered the first scene. A typical dilemma that was interpreted with an unusual style. I would understand that animation may not be one of those we see from Disney and Pixar. But the cinematography and the humor was fantastic. I really love it!I will give this 9.2/10,0
Hayop Ka,My love for Angelica is probably the reason why I watched this in the first place. She’s her usual self which I admire and the animation was promising. But the story is such a mess. Just no.,-1
Hayop Ka,"the animation is good, the story is not. lame, typical, unrealistic. it was typically for adults because of sensitive scenes but storywise, can't find its relevance.",0

Hayop Ka,watch it for the visual ok?,0
Hayop Ka,"Funny siya. May times na medyo unrealistic yung reaction characters pero di naman ako nabother kasi may pagkasatire din yung film. Flawed yung characters at may times na di sila tama pero naiintindihan ko na may ganun talagang mga tao na mag-isipGusto ko yung naging ending kaso kung ako yung nasa posisyon ni Nimfa, sasagarin ko na yung pagiging social climber ko. Mabait naman at di mapagmata nanay ni Inigo eh. Sam and Piolo best voice performers for me. Di ko akalain na si Piolo yun!",3

Hayop Ka,Great animation and overall illustrations. Hate the cheating plotline.,0
Hayop Ka,"looking forward to more Filipino animated movies, hopefully with better plots",2
Hayop Ka,"Admittedly, there was avoidance on my end to support this movie because of the Duterte enablers that the producers are. But i had to watch it to catch up on some Filipino films. And it turns out to be one the funniest comedies i have seen coming from this side of Asia. Reminded me a bit of Booba. After reading a lot of the reviews calling the film misogynystic, i had to reassess my own reading, and although i understand where people are coming from, i disagree. Nimfa was a strong woman in touch with her femininity and her own sexuality, she has ambitions and the choices she made was for herself. Although that radio DJ was really spouting chauvinistic things, i thought it was established by the movie that the radio program was misogynystic. (As a person who had to endure THAT radio program during my cab rides, i agree with that sentiment.) Besides, she was awarded her own agency at the end. They didn't make her settle (for money) or beg (forgiveness). She didn't need saving.",2
Hayop Ka,Gorgeous animation that shows the ugliness of Philippine culture,2
Hayop Ka,I'd choose Sam Milby over Robin Padilla anyday duh.. chz,7
Hayop Ka,"these stars are just for the animation which was really good, but as soon as i heard robin padilla's voice, i started to doubt...bc why hire the guy lol. then the rest of the story unfolded :(",7

Hayop Ka,Why am I not shocked with Netflix catering to furries now?,-1

Hayop Ka,"Getting back to the r/letterboxd Film Raffle after my 6 month hiatus with this wild recommendation from Antoine! I also get to add one more country to My Cinematic TravelsI actually really liked this and even if I hadn’t I would still appreciate how the film raffle gave me the chance to see it. I can guarantee I would have never seeked out a Filipino adult animated furry film on my own.... The animation is fantastic. I absolutely loved the style, effects and great attention to detail and really appreciate the effort that must have gone into making it. This is even more impressive considering it’s from a country that isn’t known for its animated works or even live-action film industry really. I enjoyed the humour a lot, both the dark comedy and the immature dirty jokes. Comedy is universal, but I’m sure it would have been funnier to people who speak the language and can relate to the culture. Or they could have hated it much more judging by all the very low ratings on Letterboxd. They seem to be judging this for the presence of some questionable names in the cast/crew and for being misogynist and encouraging toxic behaviour. I obviously can’t speak for the former, but to me this very much seemed like a satire poking fun at toxic masculinity rather than trying to encourage it. It also seemed to have some surface level commentary on class and how love is sometimes a luxury only the rich can afford. I didn’t feel like it had something whether the actions of Nimfa, Roger and Inago were justified nor did they seem to want the audience to make up their mind. This is obviously much less concerned with sending a message than with making a funny piece of entertainment, and I was certainly very entertained. The ending was the only part I didn’t enjoy and it seemed totally inconsistent with the rest. I don’t have much more to say other than warn everyone about Netflix’s evil furry agenda. Furries are degenerates that must be combatted at all costs (/s... I think) and yet Netflix continues to promote the likes of this and shows like Beastars... and they even have the audacity to be pretty good. It’s interesting how the language spoken is a mixture of English and Tagalog which does happen in certain segments of Egyptian society but not to this extent. Is this how the average person from the Philippines speaks or is it another level of satire?",2
Hayop Ka,I don't care much for the story/plot but only giving it 3 stars for the quality of the animation. Gotta give it to our local animators!,-1
Hayop Ka,hmMMmMmmmmMm,1
Hayop Ka,The animations are very lovely but the message isn't delivered thoroughly for me.,0
Hayop Ka,i liked the animation. just the animation though. the fact that it's a satire film doesn't work for me.,0
Hayop Ka,"Although the story lacked anything of subtext and the plot was overdramatic, the film is elevated with great animation and nice character designs. I like the film's aesthetic, but the comedy didn't do much for me. The film also had the right amount of raunch; it's horny in a fun way and not a gross way.",0
Hayop Ka,It's like a flower vase; beautiful and elegant on the outside but hollow and devoid of content on the inside.,-1
Hayop Ka,"I apologize for hyping this film up the way I did. As much as I am a huge fan of Direk Avid, I felt like the animation was wasted on a regressive storyline that literally said ""fuck women, all they do is cheat and get knocked up.""also, TW// Robin Padilla",0
Hayop Ka,Sobrang ganda ng animation! Sobrang daming details na nakakatuwa! The story is surprisingly empowering but at the same time bittersweet.,6
Hayop Ka,"there are witty little details and the animation is excellent, but i had to turn it off halfway, sorry",0
Hayop Ka,"This movie is so much fun! The pacing was weird in some places but it was still enjoyable. The designs are really cute too!! Also this movie is like,,, RIDDLED with memes in the backgrounds. I saw loss, pepe, and dickbutt. Amazing",0
Hayop Ka,The story is just average. The animation is great showcase of what pinoy animation prod can do.,0
Hayop Ka,"This wasn't really for me. The plot and characters were unlikeable (especially Nimfa). The animation style was excellent however, I only wish the Filipino animators get a chance to use their skill on a better screenplay in the future.",2
Hayop Ka,kudos to the animators for creating a visual treat! i just wish the same level of care was given to the story,0
Hayop Ka,"While the overall design of the film is consistently engaging, colorful, and surprisingly textured, the film is let-down severely by an awkward, unfunny script. Much like most ""adult animation"" where adult actually translates to ""immature,"" the film is beside itself with forced, silly sex puns that land with a thud in conversations between barely developed characters. Our protagonist pursues an affair for some reason (unfulfilled life with her loving long-term boyfriend, impulsivity, take your pick) and because she is so underwritten and flat we never know nor care when her decisions come back to hurt her. And besides, her entire arc is only an excuse to force in some bland titillation and more high school level sex jokes into this already barren narrative.",0
Hayop Ka,"Es como una comedia romántica estúpida, algo más sexual, con los clichés del triángulo amoroso, el tema de la diferencia de clases, y una protagonista insufrible y odiosa, que se porta mal con todo el mundo. Lo único que reivindico es la animación, para ser de Filipinas han hecho un buen trabajo, y el tema de los cambios entre el inglés y el filipino es cuanto menos curioso. Pero la película es malísima, y bastante tóxica y cliché.",2

Hayop Ka,"I mean, it’s not that explicit as most mature cartoons in America. This is more so like a tame and less depressing Bojack Horseman made in the Philippines.",2
Hayop Ka,"great animation, meh themes and plot. this one is mostly for the furries",0
Hayop Ka,"Disappointed but what can you expect? Only thing that kept me going are the animation, effort of the whole cast and crew, and hope that the ending would be somewhat decent. It is, kind of.",0
Hayop Ka,2 stars for the beautiful animation. Story has more potential than dogs cheating on each other xD,4
Hayop Ka,"Good animation, hit-or-miss humor, mediocre characters, and a baaad story.It’s a movie.",0
Hayop Ka,Animation deserved better than this story.,0
Hayop Ka,"Yep, an animated comedy for adults released straight to Filipino Netflix.This was roughly equal in quality to that SING movie Illumination made a few years ago. They don't do anything clever with the animals! It's like each character was assigned to a different animal *at random*! I hate that!Oh yeah, and also none of the jokes are funny, but, ya know, that's to be expected.",2
Hayop Ka,Amazing! Perfect talaga si Angge dito.,1
Hayop Ka,"It's a Filipino animated film, I think one of the first feature length animated film from the Philippines? And my god is this film sexually charged. Like, I knew going in that it was a soap opera-esque love triangle type thing that very much took advantage of appealing to adults, but man I didn't expect it to go like it did. The pacing is alllllllll over the place, and a lot of tensions in the film don't get resolved. Despite that though? It's actually kind of nice. I dunno if I'd watch it again, but overall, I'm glad I watched it. Nimfa, the main character, is a bit unlikable at times -- she's unfaithful as hell and has some priorities a bit mixed, and can be somewhat hypocritical at times -- but the entire cast is flawed in some form. It's very grounded in that sense, and she's not above growing. Her two love interests are similar. Roger, he's rough around the edges, but overall is a nice dude... albeit with a temper, and real poor money management skills. Iñigo is the other -- a tried and true stereotypical businessman type, slinging deals and reveling in his riches. Overall a nice dude, though very much enjoys all the whims his life offers. If you don't like soapy drama or heavily sexually charged energy (my god), it wouldn't be for you, but it is BEAUTIFULLY animated. The style is distinct and very nice to look at, and it has gorgeous fight scenes, of all things. If interest is relatively piqued, I'd say find a way to watch it, it's worth at the very least it's runtime.",2
Hayop Ka,Imma bring this movie’s ratings UP with my 5. Enjoyable!,-1
Hayop Ka,"This is a hard one. I obviously love the animation but found the story insufferable. Everybody is a terrible person in this movie. Strangely they're not terrible people in a villainous bad guy movie kinda way but in a normal regular people making bad decisions kinda way. The conflict is driven by the characters indulging in their worst instincts that they know will not turn out well but they do so anyway because of the thrill and it is very much not fun to watch. Then you have the animation that makes all this tolerable.The animation isn't always a good thing. A special mention must be made of the first sex scene between Nimfa and Inigo where they're drawn super detailed but they still keep their geometric cartoon shapes, it was so unsexy that I think my penis shrunk.",0
Hayop Ka,sayang (37),1
Hayop Ka,this sure was a movie.i liked jerry and all the background/scenery art,-1
Hayop Ka,"Have to say that I really like the design of this, especially with the scene settings and the cute ass animations like stars when there was a fight. But c'mon, this was a crusty-poo wattpad-traditional storyline... It is in line with the typical pinoy drama— poor girl + rich man, sexism and adultery. Had me cringing half the time but it makes sense with the cast of this film. overall a painful experience and I should have known better.",0
Hayop Ka,"woah, loved the animation like wala akong masabi! mabuhay ang mga malilikhaing Pilipino!  pero bakit masyadong problematic yung story? :<",6
Hayop Ka,We need more Filipino Animated movies with visuals on this level! Pero sana okay yung story sa next time na yun.,2
Hayop Ka,"Actually enjoyed this movie a lot. Not something to take very seriously at all, just be there for humour and ridiculousness. Characters are all flawed in some way or another (‘cept for Larry!) Was in a blue funk for a while and this brought me right out of it. Great daytime movie over lunch. Story could have done with some work, especially with character development and themes, but still felt enjoyable. Not a perfect movie, but a enjoyable one I’d say.",0
Hayop Ka,"i really wanted to like this film, but i was only left with disappointment. hire better writers! sayang!",0
Hayop Ka,funny but wtf,8
Hayop Ka,"Zootopia but make it wasak.The rating is for the animation alone. 'Yun lang talaga nagdala.The jokes are very Pinoy, the story could've been better pero too much to ask for na siguro lalo kung may hayop sa cast sa totoong buhay.",6
Hayop Ka,"This movie stinks. First off, the animation is goddamn gorgeous. It’s really good and it’s something I honestly didn’t expect going into this movie. It’s clear to me that everyone in the animation department for this movie just let loose and went bananas with charm and colors that pop. It creatively welcomes the audience and allows them to find delight in a world where people are, in essence, human-animal hybrids without them reeling back and thinking “wtf are these human-animal hybrids”I didn’t think about this until the very end of the movie, but secondly, the voice acting was also surprisingly decent in my opinion. Something I also did not expect. The dialogue felt organic because of that, and because the lines were never dry nor dull. Unfortunately, that’s everything good about this movie. I see this film as another dished-out entry in the Filipino film industry, as nothing sets it apart from other films of said industry (apart from the animation). It doesn’t bring anything new to the table plot-wise, since everything that’s been done here feels like, no wait, IS something that’s been done by so many other goddamn movies (albeit in a lighter tone) I can’t even begin to count. I just think this: if we strip this movie of the obviously gorgeous animation, if we take out the witty/funny lines, the voice acting, the editing, if we just leave the plot all on its own, will it still be able to stand all by itself? To me, the answer is a big fat no. It isn’t a very good story in my opinion, and as I’ve said, this is in essence a movie with themes and elements that are in many other Filipino movies, executed and presented almost exactly the same way most of the time. You don’t have to look or try very hard to find hit-or-miss jokes, cheesy lines, and bad writing along with classism, misogyny, and adultery among other things as themes in other Filipino films/series. Also there are times when, weirdly, the movie kind of asks the audience to take a certain scene or moment seriously, but then it wusses out and overshadows said moments with *funny action scene!*, stopping anyone from caring about our protagonist’s worries, doubts, and hurt. It could not commit to a pause just a while to let us feel and instead convinces itself that *funny action scene!* is necessary to maintain attention. Now if you find this movie enjoyable, if you were able to whole-heartedly enjoy it the whole time, all the way, I would not diss or condemn you for it. If anything, I actually envy that you were able to get something out of the time you spent with this movie. I just find it odd how some people who did enjoy this movie go out of their way and say “Oh yeah? Well, you just didn’t get it! It’s actually satire dummy and well, what did you expect? Disney? Pixar???” to people who disliked the movie. When….okay let’s talk about this for a bit. Firstly, in my opinion, if it was really satire then it still didn’t do a very good job. At no point did the movie mock the themes and elements it was said to make fun of, nor did it make a point that it was indeed satirical, subtle or otherwise, like a satire would do. It was just doing it’s own thing without…….satire. If that’s the case, then it’s just a regular Filipino screenplay with a “satire” sticker slapped onto it. Secondly, I find it weird when people say “What did you expect? Disney? Pixar???” as if it’s okay to stay in a box contented, conforming to the usual formula without experimenting, venturing out or aspiring to have as strong an emotional connection and impact with the audience as Disney/Pixar movies. This is not to say it SHOULD BE Disney/Pixar. I’m just saying any piece of art isn’t worth much if it isn’t the best it could be, if it never went the distance, if it never evolves and adapts. That’s my two cents. Great animation, lackluster story. My stars go to the animators and the few jokes and moments that actually made me laugh.",0
Hayop Ka,"watched it for the animation and to appreciate the art lang talaga. Kudos to the illustrators na nagdrawing and naganimate! I love the art style!! The voice-over is actually decent but the story, meh.anw, hoping for more projects sa mga animators and illustrators (na may maayos na story,,) <3",6

The Nimfa Dimaano Story (coming to Netflix later this year under the translated title, You Animal!) could not have been a better table-setter.

Hayop Ka,2 stars para sa mga animators ng pelikulang ‘to. Sila lang deserve mabigyan ng recognition.,4
Hayop Ka,"I have a theory that adult animation is a nebulous holy grail for animation fans, because animation fans don't actually want adult animation. What they want, is animation to be allowed to have a multitude of emotions in a western context. Really, adult animation is about finding juvenile ways to shoehorn in bad sex puns into your strange little ""Zootopia, but it's a sexy Filipino furry-bait melodrama” concoction. As a connoisseur of terrible puns, I deeply groaned every time they mentioned sausages and buns.",0

I'm sure that's part of the style of these shows but aside from adding in a few fun anime style quirks to the proceedings it doesn't do anything to really satirise the genre enough and comes off like a frat boys take on rom-coms, which doesn't work as a rom com or a satire. If you can get past all the slut shaming it's an okay watch but won't be too memorable.",-1
Hayop Ka,"Hayop Ka! is this unusual yet entertaining animated film driven by a sexual frenzy with an insatiable appetite. Its absurd humor is complimented by its homage to anime and video games with throwbacks to Street Fighter II, Dragon Ball Z, and even Food Wars.

Hayop Ka,ANIMAL VERSION OF FIFTY SHADES OF GREY WTFFF WAS THIS MOVIE ,9
Hayop Ka,"There are a couple of things one needs to know prior to delving into a satire like Hayop Ka! The Nimfa Dimaano Story. First: the film is inspired by popular Filipino telenovelas. These beloved soap operas usually feature characters who scream “Hayop Ka!,” which translate to “You Animal!” or “You Son of a B****”, in the height of conflict.The fact that the central figures in director Avid Liongoren’s cheeky animated comedy are, in fact, animals should tell you what type of film you are watching.The second thing to note is that shock jock radio hosts have increasingly become surrogate therapists for those who lack the funds to get professional advice. This is a double-edged sword though as the hosts usually turn the caller’s personal hardships into humiliating spectacles for ratings. While this unfair trial by public opinion appears in the later sections of the film, Hayop Ka! The Nimfa Dimaano Story keeps its feet firmly in the soapy waters of melodrama throughout.Read Courtney Small's full review: thatshelf.com/fantasia-2021-hayop-ka-the-nimfa-dimaano-story/",5

Hayop Ka,"The animation is impressive, but the rest is messy at best, misogynist at its worst, though I am not very familiar with Phillipines film so I don't know if that is more a cultural thing or the director not quite sticking the landing on the telenovela vibe they were pursuing.",0
Hayop Ka,This was so much fun!,8
Hayop Ka,"the animation was the best part of this film. it was beautifully done and the attention to detail and lil mocks of the popular brands so funny n amazing. the plot is ehh, its fine ig. its a typical filipino teleserye vibe plot. its couldve been better. some moments were definitely very iffy to me. but it is kinda satirical ???? the fight action scenes, i enjoyed, cuz it was fun n absurd. jhermelyn was such a snakey bitch  and also c robin talaga ? rlly.... yuck overall entertaining mainly bc of the incredible animation.",2
Hayop Ka,"Fantasia #50Days of Our Lives × Bojack HorsemanI absolutely understand the many and all valid criticisms of this film. However, the animation was lovely and this made me miss living in Vancouver and the large Filipino community there. The script is definitely rough, but I laughed a few times and thought the satire of all the soap tropes was solid.",2
Hayop Ka,"The film is overwhelmingly full of witty puns and sexy jokes. The type of film I'm uncertain to dive in- but here we are. The animated flick is definitely new and fresh for Filipino viewers but the themes and plot are very familiar. This is a staple contribution to the animation industry here in the country since it's the first animated film to be launched in Netflix worldwide.Rocketsheep Studio did their homework and polished their art. The world is very well done and with closer inspection, it's full of easter eggs inspired from different films. Additionally, the animation was solid like it came off from a western film. The film itself is good and definitely worth checking out. I can't wait for more animated films to be recognized in the platform made by Filipinos.",2

Hayop Ka,"Review by Sean Boelman.Hayop Ka! The Nimfa Dimaano Story is an excellent reminder of the tremendous potential that independent adult animation has. A hilarious soap opera parody, the film doesn’t aim for the low-hanging fruit in poking fun at one of the lowest art forms there is. But the real success of the film is the way in which it creates a genuine emotional connection to these characters. Even though it’s obviously melodramatic (on purpose), the genuine heart in the film is absolutely charming and unexpected.MORE FANTASIA THOUGHTS HERE",5

Hayop Ka,"Beautifully animated and hilariously raunchy. It’s charming in its own way but its morals are very eschewed, which is I guess a good reflection of the society it’s borne out of. (I’m filipino and raised there, so I know what I’m talking about) It’s always toeing the line between misogyny and feminism which is just a really odd thing to behold. It would’ve been awesome if the movie had something real to say about women in modern day Manila, but coming from the point of view of male writers and directors who are enamored with the idea of this being a pastiche of the old bold-star era of Philippine cinema, it was never gonna go down that route. Which, it is a shame because it had all the ingredients to do so. That being said, it works well as a glimpse into life within modern day Philippines, with its matter-of-fact way of showing social and class divides and the strange double standards on gender that are the result of colonial patriarchy being thrust into an inherently matriarchal society. The humor is also quintessentially filipino with its focus on puns (jokes that are so lost in translation that the subtitles are basically a whole different screenplay).",2

Hayop Ka,"i love this, nagulat ako sa mababang rating huhu at wala akong pakialam kung hindi niyo gusto.ang animation???? pinoy vibes at pinoy pride at its finest!!!! ang story???? sobrang cliche pinoy storytelling!!!!nakaka relate si nimfa dahil mataas ako mangarap at nakaka galit si roger at iñigo totoong kahit ano man ang estado sa buhay ng lalaki ay redflag pa rin! ang ganda ng mga mid-credit scene ni nimfa!i don't hate the plot, ang ganda ng pagpapakita ng buhay ng mga normal na pilipino. atsaka as a communication student gusto ko yung pagpapakita ng malaking aspeto na ginagampanan ng mga radyo sa buhay ng mga pilipino.",3
Hayop Ka,"daming funny moments, and gusto ko yung spin niya regarding nag-aagawan-plot na nangyayari sa mga romance movie.Mabuting tao si Jerry and inexpect ko na magkakasomething sila sa dulo HAHAHA tho such a shame na yung development ni Nimfa bilang isang babae, manggagawa, anak at kapatid ay nangyari sa ending credits. The movie was also clear about class contradictions with Inigo’s character (hated that nothing happened to him in the end). Generally nothing really happens in the end, but i get it. Its a take on love stories so i didnt expect much. so still a nice film",6
Hayop Ka,enjoyed the graphics not the plot over sa misogyny ha,-1
Hayop Ka,jerry my goat,1
Hayop Ka,"first, animation is good! napansin ko talga yon kasi ganon sya kaayos. but then, sometimes na-overshadow na rin nya yung scenes no? i feel like if this movie really would have a good last stretch baka tumaas ratings neto.. im just saying that this movie really had the POTENTIAL just needed a new way to explain what happened to nimfa with all the shitty men she had! SHE’S REALLY IS NOT THE PROBLEM HERE its the misogyny that eats us all, classism and many more. HAY!!! nimfa ang bagong misunderstood posikat",-1
Hayop Ka,ganda ng art at animation pero kebs lang story. ang labo ng sinasabi niya about gender at social class? medyo misogynistic pa rin??? pero support ko pa rin rocket sheep! siguro kailangan lang nila ng magandang script!!,3

Hayop Ka,"ТГ каналБуквально анимационная версия Materialists. Приятная визуально анимация, кроме момента секса, это холый неприкрытый кринж. (в тг канал скинул пару картиночек). Сюжет прост и поверхностен. Нимфа приходит к чему-то положительному, для себя как личности, только в конце титров. Этот момент стоило раскрыть подробнее, а не вставлять в виде мельком показанной картинки. Надеюсь у аниматоров будет еще работа, с более достойным сюжетом. - Animation Week Challenge 2025 -",-1

Hayop Ka,"I love the art style, the animation, humor, visual gags, and the Filipino-specific easter eggs peppered throughout the film. It’s clear the animators had fun making Hayop Ka!My only problem is the romanticization of cheating in a relationship. Sure, Nimfa, the titular character, received a verbal lashing after confessing her mistake on air (spoofing a famous, self-righteous love guru radio DJ). And she ended up facing the consequences of that mistake alone. But I don’t think punishing the woman should be the lesson here. Anyway, cheating and adultery stories in the context of Filipino pop culture is such a tired idea. I’m sick of it.Hopefully we see more Filipino, adult, animated films. As long as it’s not about cheating.",5

Hayop Ka,"Hindi ko rin alam kung bakit ko pinanood 'tong Hayop Ka! ni Avid Liongoren, siguro dahil curious ako sa ""unang Pinoy adult animation"" sa Netflix. Pero matapos ang isang oras at labinlimang minuto, isa lang ang masasabi ko: hindi benta ang kalibugan ng mga hayop.Yes, maganda ang animation. Hindi maitatangging pulido, colorful, at may effort ang mga animators. Halatang pinag-isipan nila yung detalye ng ""animal version ng Pilipinas."" Witty yung names ng lugar, makulay ang background, at minsan may mga visual gags na effective. Pero sayang, kasi lahat ng ganda, tinabunan ng isang script na parang binunot sa pinakababa ng basura ng Philippine showbiz.Nakakabwisit yung sobrang sexualization ng mga karakter. Oo, satire daw. Oo, gusto raw magpatawa gamit ang bold jokes. Pero ang kinalabasan, parang hyper-sexualized telenovela na hindi malaman kung seryoso ba siyang commentary sa class divide o gusto lang niyang gawing ""bomba cartoon"" si Nimfa. May mga lewd puns na hindi nakakatawa, may mga eksena na parang lowbrow radio drama, at may ending pa na pinilit gawing redemption arc gamit ang ""nice guy"" trope. Ang suffocating din ng casual misogyny na parang diniktahan kang kamuhian si Nimfa for making choices na, in reality, rooted sa kahirapan niya.Ang daming Pinoy teleserye clichés dito. Mayaman vs. mahirap, kabit-kabit, pangarap makaahon sa hirap, tapos puro moralizing sa dulo. Kung satire nga talaga, bakit parang mas kinampihan pa ang mga luma at problematikong values? Parang instead of poking fun at them, nire-recycle lang nila.Props lang sa animators! Sila lang talaga yung nagdala ng pelikula. Hindi nila kasalanan na yung script ay puno ng infidelity, sexism, at macho bullshit na hindi na dapat sinusubo pa sa audience. Sa totoo lang, mas deserve nilang bigyan ng proyekto na mas meaningful at hindi ganitong caricature ng lahat ng maling bagay sa local entertainment industry.TLDR: Kung gusto mong makita kung ano ang hitsura ng Zootopia kung ginawa siyang panghapon na teleserye na puno ng sabaw na kabitan, eto na 'yon. Pero kung meaningful satire ang hanap mo, huwag ka na mag-aksaya ng oras.",3
Hayop Ka,,1
Hayop Ka,"it’s a local philippine adult animation, SOMETHING THAT IS NOT VERY COMMON. y’all are such a hater lol",2
Hayop Ka,what materialists (2025) wanted to be,-1
Hayop Ka,"The first time I watched Hayop Ka!, I honestly just saw it as a bastos movie, parang puro kabastusan lang HAHA. But upon rewatching it, I realized the concept is actually liberating and surprisingly close to reality. Its vibrancy and exaggerated humor felt more like satire—a playful but biting critique of how consumerism shapes the world we live in.Through a realist lens, the film mirrors the everyday struggles of many Filipinos, though wrapped in an animated, comedic package. The stark contrast between the rich and the poor was a constant theme. How privilege dictates not only opportunities but also relationships. Even love in the film is framed by class and material wealth, showing how affection is often entangled with survival and status.From a Marxist perspective, Nimfa’s relationships expose how capitalism and consumerism seep into our most intimate desires. Her dissatisfaction with her current boyfriend and her attraction to a wealthier partner may seem superficial at first, but it reflects how the system conditions people to equate love with upward mobility and financial security. The film satirizes how consumer culture commodifies even emotions and human connection, turning them into transactions rather than purely personal bonds.Looking at it through feminist theory naman, my initial impression of Nimfa as ""malandi"" for wanting more felt unfair. On rewatch, I realized this judgment reflects how women are often shamed for pursuing their desires, especially if those desires break away from traditional expectations. The film suggests that Nimfa’s choices are not purely personal flaws but rather shaped by the larger forces of patriarchy and capitalism, where women are pressured to chase an “ideal” version of love, security, and femininity. It questions why women are criticized for seeking better lives, while men who fail to provide are rarely scrutinized in the same way.In the end, Hayop Ka! may seem chaotic and shallow at first glance, but digging deeper, it becomes a satirical mirror of our society; where class, consumerism, and gender roles intersect to shape even the most personal aspects of life like love and relationships.",5
Hayop Ka,"Nimfa should’ve gotten an abortion, just sayinSurprisingly enjoyed this silly anthro telenovella. Pacing is pretty off and nobody is truly likeable here, but the animation is wonderful, I quite like how they drew backgrounds and cityscapes. But holy shit we spent the whole movie wanting to end the cycle of poverty, and it ends with her raising her baby as a single mom…? And despite its pretty neutral portrayal of female sexuality in the beginning, she gets shamed for having sex by that weirdo radio jockey, gross. We should be past this “children are a punishment for having sex” type of plotline already. Not surprised that the billionaire boyfriend thing didn’t work out, not just because he’s had a history of cheating but because Nimfa had shitty communication skills and kept pushing away Inigo so…But honestly these half star reviews are a bit harsh. I’d love to see more from this studio and encourage Southeast Asian animation, even if the output isn’t always appealing.",-1
Hayop Ka,"mid, love the art style though",-1
Hayop Ka,Krush na Tigas ,1
Hayop Ka,"I remember all the hype about this back in 2020! Shame it took a course in my fourth/last year of college before I pressed play on this…Anyway, I thought this was effective and authentic. Your way of life and finances really do dictate how you live your life tbh… the resentment towards each other (Nimfa, a saleslady, belittling his janitor boyfriend) is real; you resent each other because you both cannot lift each other up, yet the system is unfortunately devised in a way that keeps you both down. While it very much feels like something so inspired by films from the late 2010s, its themes held up really well. Five years after its release, I’ve never seen class resentment be so pervasive all over. Watching this in 2025 made me realize that wow, this has been a dilemma for ages. Nimfa resorts to participating as a caller in a radio program, whose misogynist host attacks her for her decisions. However, Nimfa’s actions were dictated so by her circumstances; you cannot blame someone for doing what they do if they’re in the margins of society. I really liked how Raffy Tulfo was satirized here. Its ending was a bit too far-fetched, if you watched in 2020. But in a time that is currently very much intent on ‘eating the rich,’ and after Luigi Mangione did what he did, it’s not far-fetched anymore. Maybe this film was ahead of its time tbh… Anyway, I was cracking up over several jokes. I particularly liked the scene where Nimfa’s workmate was revealed to be fucking Nimfa’s boyfriend  just insane throughout.I just didn’t really like the abundance of sexual jokes… it felt incredibly juvenile. If you get off on making animals freaky, then please go all the way, instead of showing them moaning so sexually and then revealing they’re just having a foodgasm. This was hailed as a boundary-pushing film, but all I got was a work that felt too afraid to be unabashedly themselves. You’d get the respect you crave if you own the furry freak in you. Nonetheless though, I think it’s a good critique on the system that pits the poor against each other! It aged well.",-1
Hayop Ka,love the art style and the animation and totoong hayop silang lahat <3,-1
Hayop Ka,"I'm so torn about this film; on one hand, the plot reeked of played-out Filipino movie tropes, and on the other, the animation was just breathtaking. The opening scenes showing the animated version of a furry alternate universe of Manila was both amusing and astounding, as they were able to capture the essence of the urban streets, not to the countless nods to certain Filipino customs. However, from the get-go, I was also able to predict more than half of the plot... GAH! HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO LOVE AND HATE SOMETHING AT THE SAME TIME!",2
Hayop Ka,"i finally watched this after putting it off for so long, and i actually liked it! though the story is a typical filipino story, it wouldn’t be as good if it wasn’t for the animation. the animation itself gave the story its charm for how ordinary it is, yet done extraordinarily because of the animation. all i wish is for more filipino animated movies because this one was really great! this wouldn’t have paid off if this was a movie with actual people. cheers to filipino animators and i hope for more opportunities for them!

Hayop Ka,"Well, this was meant to be a comedy, right? A supposedly realistic depiction of a poor, ambitious woman's stroke of bad luck, where her morality be tried when a hand that promised everything she'd ever wished for extended to her, through comedy?... but unfortunately poorly executed.Filipinos usually have great humor. Where was that great humor when it mattered? The animation can be enjoyable, but I scarcely enjoyed everything else. Sam Milby's was the only voice over that sounded right... and yeah that's really Robin Padilla there, I bet everything he spat felt natural.This could've had a huge potential to be enioyabe and successful, even just locally.I think sex jokes can only be enjoyable when exchanged quietly, between two people who actually have bussiness being all over each other. I think it's about time they stop using sex jokes/sexual comedy to sell whatever they're trying to sell or fill a gap they couldn't pull together just because they can't think of anything funny.",0

Hayop Ka,"Unang una, animation-wise, ang ganda. Ang effort ng mga animator may detail, style, at fluidity. Pero doon na nagkaproblema sa kwento. Sadly, the plot just didn’t hold up. Kahit gaano pa kaganda ang animation, kung paulit-ulit pa rin ang narrative themes, walang bago at walang depth hindi na rin kayang isalba ng visuals even though I'm a sucker for visuals, masarap sa mata kaso ang hirap i-ignore 'yung nilalangaw na plot.I'm not expecting some Pixar story plotline pero it doesn't hurt to criticize kung paano nila in-execute.Usual tropes na naman: cheating, class divide, misogyny, poverty porn, and outdated character stereotypes. Nakakapagod na panoorin kasi parang wala ng bagong sinasabi. Instead of elevating the story with the animation, parang mas lalo lang na-highlight kung gaano kababaw at problematic ‘yung plot. Even the dialogues felt off awkward, minsan cringey, minsan tone-deaf. Imbes na ma-immerse ka sa kwento, nadidistract ka sa kung gaano ka unnatural pakinggan ng mga linya. Sayang. Ang ganda ng animation, pero nasayang sa isang plot na hindi masyadong pinag-isipan or nag-stick sa classic tropes ng Philippine media. Still, major kudos to the animators, sana well-compensated at recognized sila with the artistry they've shown.",6

I really liked how they casted my favorite anime dub voice actors in this. the frog character Jerry might be my favorite character in the whole film.

Although admittedly, for a local production, the animation is surprisingly solid, and the art is visually nice, especially in how it captures the country’s landscape. Unfortunately, the story captures another aspect, specifically how trashy this country can be, from the awful dialogue to the unlikeable characters who, unfortunately, without a doubt, exist in real life.TL;DR: Filipino dubbing + unlikeable characters + trash dialogue + furry corn – solid animation = terrible",2

Hayop Ka,"I’m bumping up my rating mainly because of the exceptional art quality. The attention to detail, the vibrant colors, and the overall vibe really stand out—definitely the most commendable aspect of the film.The plot? Classic Filipino movie stuff—infidelity, sexism, social inequality—nothing surprising there. But I didn’t expect the ending to go the way it did. I thought it would follow the usual formula of the characters getting back together and whatnot as if nothing happened, but the film took a different turn. So, it wasn’t entirely bad in that regard.Also, the casting of voice actors. If they had the budget, they could’ve definitely used some actual voice actors instead of just hearing Robin Padilla every time a character spoke. Kinda threw me off.But overall, the movie has potential! Fingers crossed we get more Filipino animated films like this one!",2
Hayop Ka,its actually not bad! give this film a chance,0
Hayop Ka,this gets too much hate chillaxx,1
Hayop Ka,The strength of this film is the local color. The art quality and the attention to details is something that every watcher should pay attention to. Almost every moment is filled with references that every Filo watcher would love. Good work to the creative team!,2
Hayop Ka,"The animation style deserves five stars, but the story can be better. Please hire professional voice actors for animated movies too.",7
Hayop Ka,"I really wish I could figure out just why this is rated so low on Letterboxd. If ever there was a movie I wanted to have a conversation about, this is it, because I fail to see why this really fun, slightly dramatic, but overall interesting slice of life is so universally panned. I think it goes without saying to praise the animation in Hayop-ka - it’s smooth and moves fluidly, it leaves itself open for some really impressive expressions and powerful images in scenes. The backgrounds are picturesque, and create a very vivid feeling of what this version of the Philippines is like: lively, energetic, maybe a little crowded but full of interesting characters. I think it’s worth mentioning, too, how good these backgrounds are at communicating different regions: the scenic beach near the luxury cabin, the quiet village that’s contrasted by its tight knit sense of community, both contrasted against the usual setting of the city. And while I’ve seen in other reviews that people find the innuendos in the background jokes to be tacky or in poor taste, I actually found that not only were a lot of them funny, but I think it creates a tangible sense of a world populated by Anthro animals more than other media tends to. I think sex is a pretty natural human experience, and a lot of real life marketing sells sex very transparently, and lots of mainstream Anthro animation doesn’t address that. It’s outside the ratings for films like Zootopia and Sing, and sexuality is so central a focus of a story like Beastars that normalizing it would kind of destroy its themes. And I think that perhaps Hayop-Ka’s depiction of sexuality in this world is one of its greatest strengths. Which, I guess, is interesting, because it seems like part of the negative backlash to Hayop-Ka is the accusation that is perverse or obscene for its sexual nature. Which seems… weird to me. The sex isn’t explicit in it, and Nimpha is only pictured having sex in the film once. The films setting is steeped in sexuality: sexuality is marketed on every sign on every street, and Nimpha’s motivation is mostly based around sex,But it doesn’t feel that weird I guess? It’s a story about an adult woman making adult choices, and the use of sexuality is only out of place because it’s animation - but there’s a lot of animated stories that are a lot more sexual than this. And like I said, I think the sexuality makes the plot kind of interesting. By the third act, the novelty of animal-sex-world kinda dies off, and the film isn’t really about that, as it becomes a series of Nimpha making increasingly more destructive decisions with basically everyone involved in her life. But by that point in the film, I had already been hooked in, and I was interested in what would happen to Nimpha. The positive sexual expression was a great hook for the first act, and moving into the second and third, I cared enough about the established characters enough to weigh the morality of their decisions in my head. Nimpha does something objectively bad to Roger, but it is understandable that she wants to better herself, and Roger’s tendency towards violence make him seem like a less dependable partner. But Inigo’s a literal villain, and if him talking about partnering with Elon musk didn’t telegraph that enough, he is a character who openly talks about working with the Filipino president to keep wages down. When Nimpha confronts her family in the third act, she’s objectively wrong, but I can’t really be mad at her, because it’s a realistic emotional outburst. I’ve watched a lot of stories about bad people who misuse sexuality in their lives. And I’ll never claim that Hayop-Ka - an animated parody of soap operas meant to poke fun at infidelity - is even half as weighty as Tár or Bojack Horseman - heavy commentary about how celebrity is used to leverage power. But, I do file this movie in a similar place in my head. Watching a not great person try to be better and trying to figure out why things are so messy. And frankly!!! I actually adore the ending for that. Because Nimfa does fuck up, she does do bad things, but people in her life do bad things back to her. And in the end the best thing Nimfa can do is just… walk away. Start a new life. And she does and I think that’s beautiful. I do think it’s worth mentioning the sexist overtones in the climax of the movie - when Nimfa calls the radio station. A reference to an unfortunately very real trend of men berating women for doing anything other than serving whatever man is already present in her life. I feel like part of the negative reception of Hayop Ka is that people read this as him being right but like… no?? He’s just not? Maybe it’s my prior knowledge making me biased against a man in a recording booth telling a woman how to live her life, but in that moment I think it’s Nimfa’s last attempt to rely on men, and her faith in it is shattered when she talks to Inigo again. Because yeah - don’t know if you notice - she can’t even try to follow that bull’s advice, because she never gets a chance to come clean to Inigo if she wanted to. And I think that Nimfa marching for maternity leave and raising her child on her own with her family shows that Nimfa’s life isn’t going to revolve around the approval of men anymore. It’s possible that’s cope: that this is a sexist message I’m jumping through hoops to spin in a way that empowers the protagonist in the end. But I dunno, I kinda constructed that reading without thinking about it. I don’t think it’s that much of a stretch.I’m going to be coming back to Hayop-Ka at some point, for sure. It’s filed in my brain alongside a lot of my favorite depictions of every day life in an animal world. It’s a little melodramatic, but I do think that the depiction of Nimfa, and how her story ends, does tell a good, grounded story. I think I, a bunny, am always going to be happy with a film that I start and whose title very loudly says to me,“You’re an animal”",5
Hayop Ka,the ending is actually cute but its painfully boring,0
Hayop Ka,Couldve casted John Arcilla instead of wanderpul tonayt,-1
Hayop Ka,"furry na nga, cheater pa",1

Hayop Ka,this is so,1
Hayop Ka,"the animation is good and its funny, but I feel like I missed out on some of the jokes coz it's a Filipino film and some of the jokes did not translate well. Anyway it was good watch and story was naiseu",2
Hayop Ka,I wish Pinoys analyzed this film as much as they did Arcane. The animation and details are amazing! But the plot was snubbed. This is the BoJack Horseman of the Philippines.,2
Hayop Ka,may laban ang animation pero bakit parang nakita ko na story nito?,3
Hayop Ka,made me giggle fart a little from how stupid it was,8
Hayop Ka,masyadong mabilis,1

Hayop Ka,This really is just how life be sometimes,1

Hayop Ka,"+1 star for the animation, the art style, the nice backdropsthe plot however... idk. I appreciate that it's telenovela-esque relationship shenanigans and not that serious. its just that sometimes it felt like the sexism was intentionally going to go somewhere, but overall it didn't really succeed at that in the end for me.",0
Hayop Ka,Jerry najlepiej wyszedł w tej kuriozalnej furasowej telenoweli,-1
Hayop Ka,parang gago lang yung ending ahahahahaha,1
Hayop Ka,"ganyan dapat robin dapat ayan nalang trabaho mo wag ka na mag senador atleast dito magaling ka pa! angelica panganiban one of my FAVES!!!

Hayop Ka,"was in the mood to watch filipino adult animation after thoroughly enjoying the marvelous iti mapukpukaw (2023) and remembered that my first foray into the genre was this good find and that it was available to stream on netflix. rewatching this film now just reaffirms how this is just simple, pure, good fun !! sure, the story is very cliched and telenovela-esque but it's told very funnily, engagingly, and unabashedly revels in all its silly glory without feeling the need…",2
Hayop Ka,"First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to the Filipino animators for creating such a film. It was beautifully crafted, and I eagerly anticipate watching thought-provoking movies in the future. The film centers around a young woman who is dissatisfied with her current partner until she meets a wealthy and handsome man. They engage in a brief fling before transitioning into a romantic relationship. In essence, the film explores the themes of infidelity and cheating. The film…",2
Hayop Ka,"this was really good, got a good chuckle. ang haharot hahahahaha",8
Hayop Ka,"don't tell me filipinos filmmakers are not capable of making quality animations because i am inlove with the animation of this film. with that said, i get what the film tries to say but the way it gets there is so flawed. however, the execution of this is actually really good. it just have too much sex jokes.",2
Hayop Ka,sobrang cliche pinoy drama cjkwkfne giving stars for the animators !!,4
Hayop Ka,watched for my filipino film class,2
Hayop Ka,"what bembang does to a person lmaooo but seriously tho, filipino animators are stepping up! now, let's have a good plot too pls and maybe less mainstream voice actors and give these projects to deserving people.",2
Hayop Ka,cliche plot pero masaya naman,1
Hayop Ka,"I love supporting animation, even more for locally developed ones!Hayop Ka! is the story of Nimfa Dimaano's topsy-turvy love life. The story isn't anything new, but I enjoyed watching it nontheless because of its art style that was super well-done.",5
Hayop Ka,ang weird ng animation style very commercial yung feel,-1
Hayop Ka,"Despite the majority saying that this has a bad and problematic plot, it is merely a depiction of reality here in the Philippines. It just shows na kaya may ganitong script kasi ito ang nangyayari. It is supposed to challenge the viewers. Sayang lang sana nasingitan ng something more para hindi puro katatawanan at conflict pinapakita. Kudos to the animators!",2
Hayop Ka,About what you'd expect.,-1
Hayop Ka,the things i watch for ms uge,-1

Hayop Ka,"Alt Title: KalibuganI was glad that Filipino animation had broken through the surface at Netflix but not with this  Parang natakot ang production na animation project siya, which are sadly not seen with much success and respect in the Philippines. Their solution? Make it a story line that we've seen countless of times from 2000s Filipino romcom movies. I mean, it did have a few laughs from me pero we could've produced a better story line than this  Medj campy naman siya so bonus ng +1 star.",2

Hayop Ka,"wonderful animation, trashy plot. i really applaud the animation team behind this for their efforts because it really was fun watching all the little details that perfectly captures the philippine setting like the witty signages in the background and basta! the details were perfect! kudos to the art team! but i just do not like the story. such a waste! i understand that it is satire but it doesn’t make it any less shitty. siguro the humor is not for me.",2
Hayop Ka,"watched for filipino animation and damn na-enjoy ko naman, we need more animated films ???",2
Hayop Ka,i feel bad for the effort of the artists for this film,-1
Hayop Ka,"This movie is much more enjoyable when you acknowledge that ALL of them are red flagsAlso, I'd rather have Robin Padilla continue voice acting terribly than him having a seat in politics. Please just voice another horndog.Side note: I know this is supposed to be satire, pero 'yung end credits part of her taking part in the rallies na kagagawan ni Iñigo could've been explored more. The animation is amazing too, sayang lang na dito sila napunta huhu. I hope they got paid well",-1
Hayop Ka,ang witty! ang galing nung satire HAHAHA,8
Hayop Ka,it's a quirky spin on your classic filipino trope.also robin padilla as roger checks out,1

Hayop Ka,"NO idea what this was but afaik it's the 1st adult animation Filipino film & the plot is very stereotypical Filipino soap opera but tbh I enjoyed it lol, a crazy but self-aware (& lowkey h*rny) story with great characters & REALLY SUPERB ANIMATION & interesting insight into living",2

Hayop Ka,stars for insanely good animation,4
Hayop Ka,"it's like zootopia meets 50 shades but make it a typical cringy filipino romcom with a cliche wattpad plot and cute animations. it's entertaining and funny tho specially puns of names of famous personalities and shops amidst some classist jokes and romanticizing cheating. anyways, it shows real struggles focusing on of a breadwinner being taken for granted and also the social issues. a bit touching in the end. the dj slayed.",-1
Hayop Ka,"this is like, most things that are wrong with filipino rom-coms and it definitely does not deserve this really nice animationm",2
Hayop Ka,I don’t know tagolog and there were no subtitles but they draw the anthropomorphic animals so sexy #pilippines,-1
Hayop Ka,"Well, this is not good film in my opinion. I’m not really going to write a review longer than a sentence, as I think that this film is undeserving of my time and effort, but here are my thoughts: the animation is splendid, but at the same time also felt overly controlled, and the plot is an amalgamation of garbage topics that the mainstream Philippine entertainment industry likes to peddle, such as adultery, misogyny, and classism, but I really hope the animators are well paid because, frankly, I think that they’re the only people who deserve to get any sort of monetary compensation for this embarrassment of a film. Also, yes, I know it’s a satire film and my point still stands.",2
Hayop Ka,Thanks Empoy,1
Hayop Ka,Hahahahahhaahha keri naman pala mag kanalan humor eh,8
Hayop Ka,"It was actually good. It has good lines and definitely, the characters have their own amazing plotlines. This is the first animated movie that I have seen in Filipino, I was just hoping that next time they are able to depict it as it is. Not just animals, but it was good this time --- and I hope next time it will be better.",2

Hayop Ka," cuidado cuando vean un top de estilos de animación en películas Solo me gustó la animación.

Hayop Ka,"I didn't expect to enjoy what's basically a shitty soap opera with furries as much as I did, but weirder things have happened. Honestly, this film is kind of a ball if you don't take it super seriously and are fully willing to accept its absurdity in stride.",0
Hayop Ka,"great animation, shit plot.",0
Hayop Ka,I couldn't bear watching it alone so I shared the burden of cringe with my friends and it improved the experience LOL. Honestly not that good or bad of a movie but the ending was satisfying and fitting for how terrible each character was as persons,0
Hayop Ka,"Obviously a film with fresh story because this film tells about a topic who not many people talk about, A trans-economic relationship and sexual problems in Philippines.Good at first, but unfortunately this film has not a good ending. Ninfa kicked both of 'em, and the film's end. That's it? The ending didn't really satisfied me.I'm not sure either are this film are getting a sequel or not.But besides that, I appreciate the Philippines studio who can makes film with those topic.",2
Hayop Ka,"I was expecting a horny furry teledrama and to my delight I got a horny furry teledrama! Solid sex jokes that hit the right spots (heh) mixed in with animal puns and the pastiche corny drama are all wrapped up in an endearing art direction and animation style. As irreverent as its story is and characters are, the moments of sincerity that shine through, especially in its layered visual dramedy, shows the care that went into Hayop Ka! Filipino animation is sorely underrated (despite how much the Philippines contributes to global animation industries), and I want to see it boom internationally just as other Asian animation like anime and donghua have. Hayop Ka! is a good introduction to the world of Filipino animation for those interested in immersing thrmselves into Filipino contemporary culture and society — a special shoutout to my mutual Dante for presenting this movie and discussing about the cultural nuances!

Hayop Ka,"Look at that, Netflix did an anime furry adaptation of 365 Days.",-1
Hayop Ka,"the animation and artstyle is so good and I didn't expect to have badass fight scenes, the plot was kind of bland. also i kind of feel annoyed that inigo never knew, cus she got distracted when she saw him with marie or whatever her name is. and the sex jokes were just so redundant. i feel like the only people who'll really enjoy this are furries",0
Hayop Ka,"So.. hindi ako masyado mahilig sa Filipino animation.Love your own dapat, pero, minsan kasi talaga hindi kaya.Don't get me wrong, talented ang animators natin. May potential, bigyan lang ng chance.And it's obvious din dito sa movie na ito na may patutunguhan ang animations natin....Hopefully, with a better story than this lang.Well, for the first adult animation in the Philippines, why not? Use the same tried and tested storyline na patok sa madla para sure na papanoorin. If it works in live action, it's a fair shot to use them in animation.I mean, if we could sit through numerous iterations of the same cliches in telenovelas, well... there's your market right there.3 stars for the effort and work and time everyone put in.

Hayop Ka,"Even if I would say this isn't a perfect movie I was pretty much intrigued what this movie is trying to tell from Filipino life to toxic relationships it's pretty much an interesting insight of one slice of life story. Plus, you gotta give it to the animation it looks pretty resonant. This feels like your daily dramedy soap opera crammed into a one hour animation fest which I actually had a pleasant time with, plus it's pretty cool to get an adult animated movie once in a while other than 'Sausage Party'.Also, thank you Saberspark for intriguing me to watch this.",2
Hayop Ka,"While the animation is great, the screenplay is still quite lacking. I get it's a satire but it doesn't really excuse how cliche it is nor how it doesn't really satorize anything about the genre outside of participating in it. The voice acting was better than I expected it to be, especially Angelica Panganiban as Nimfa. As an animator I still support it though, because getting this made is still a massive win and a big step for Philippine animation",2
Hayop Ka,i like the animation (but not the plot),0
Hayop Ka,"""Yung wala ng halaga para sayo, in-na-in pa rin para sa akin.""GRRR HINDI NILA NAGEGETS Hayop ka! is a perfect balance of social critique, clever referencing and camp. It feels refreshing, given stark animated form and fleshing out the female character's side. For once, we get an answer as to why the rich play boy is so alluring. It's not because of who he is, but rather Nimfa's background coming from a poor family.",1
Hayop Ka,"Wild Philippine adult animated movie. It’s very telenovela with really good animation. Crazy chauvinistic, classist …. Just wildly unlikable when we hit the third actIt has great commentary on issues of class and how when you’re so poor, there’s a degree to which money does matter in relationships — but then it punishes it’s lead for trying to get out of her situation in a way she maybe knows how?",2

Hayop Ka,first off the animation was super nice!!!! it was very beautiful all throughout the film!i just didnt like how at the end they made it seem like roger was the good guy and nimfa should have settled with him when in fact that guy is abusive and jobless and a Plain ass Loser. and the fact that papa jose (?) guy made it seem like it was nimfa's fault that she got pregnant and called her names was also so stewpid and misogynistic. the men in this film were shit. nimfa defender all the way tho <333 didnt really like the ending but even still i really enjoyed the film it was clearly satire but also realistic.,-1
Hayop Ka,I’m so fucking embarrassed that I watched this piece of shit movie,-1

Hayop Ka,"I fucking hate romance movies. However, this was a fun watch, primarily thanks to the animation and voice actors. This is my first Philippine movie and it was positive so I'll be coming back to this country to watch another film.",2

Hayop Ka,"overly sexual as it is, paired with the overused poor girl falls for rich ceo trope, hayop ka is extremely important in the filipino animation and art industry along with saving sally. in general, filipino animation and art itself is degraded especially if cartoony because it is seen as for children. there isn't much for aspiring artists and animators to look up to in the philippines. let us have this.",2
Hayop Ka,always so hilarious tbh kung wala lang si *toot*,1
Hayop Ka,ganda ng animation pangit ng script,0
Hayop Ka,furries would eat this shit up pero I have to say may mga linyahan na funny,1
Hayop Ka,"The elements that made it Filipino, in its passing depictions of social issues in the background and sometimes not so subtle references, elevate this film, but it still as melodramatic and cheesy like Filipino soap dramas, which I guess makes it even feel Filipino which I just enjoy than I hate. It's definitely not the most satisfying ending but it was alright, I liked how they didn't forgive Nimfa for her infidelity by getting back with her ex…",2
Hayop Ka,jerry was too good for this movie,-1
Hayop Ka,idc I love it,-1
Hayop Ka,putangina ano toooo! HAHAHAHAHA! Real furry shit! and Robin Padilla's voice acting was wack! the only good thing about this mess was its animation... I don't know what kind of drugs they are on for deciding to go with this script... cause that was a real mess...,7
Hayop Ka,"always love this movie, filipino animation should be more appreciated and done in the movie scene. not the biggest fan of the voice actors but still such a fun watch",2

Hayop Ka,gagalet. men ain't shit pero di ba kau natakam sa sinigang ng asawa ni mang ding. at need ko rin ng mga jolibog discount na yan. frog rights,1
Hayop Ka,"It's such a shame when movies with stellar animations are brought down by literally everything else. There are very cute puns all around the world, and that made the movie much more bearable, but the actual script is horrible trash and I really have nothing good to say about it. Iñigo is your average Elon Musk-loving capitalist asshole and Nimfa is a cheating, manipulative asshole that constantly tries to (and successfully) cheat on her boyfriend. I would've respected her if she just outright tried to do it just to swindle Iñigo's money. The weird thing is, they seem to be aware of all this. It obviously wants to be a satire of all the shitty and problematic romance movies in the Philippines, but it doesn't really have much to say. The movie just doesn't work.",-1
Hayop Ka,pogi ng boses ni sam milby,1
Hayop Ka,Mannnn this is bullshit I've seen the animation is wasted because of this script,0
Hayop Ka,originally gave this 4 stars pero si robin padilla pala yung voice so 3 na lang pala... stellar animation though,4
Hayop Ka,"Never thought that this animated cartoon has something so special to explain serious relationship matters. Not only we're introduced to the character brilliantly pictured and as convincing in real life, the dialogues presented flow naturally. For adults who might want to be reminded about being happy and understand choices in life, be sure not to misa this.",0
Hayop Ka,trash fury wattpad. soul simply for existing.,1
Hayop Ka,"If I were to simply rate the animation alone, I would give it a perfect score. Sadly, the misogyny in this film was too sickening to ignore. I get that they tried to depict this 80s-action-film-esque plot as something to laugh about but it could have been executed better. Sayang.",0

Hayop Ka,"I picked it up out of boredom and I’m glad I did because I really find the art style and Angelica Panganiban endearing! It also had a promising start, sure and yet I still don’t know what to exactly feel about the film overall.",0
Hayop Ka,A very well done animated piece on the Filipino woman.,2
Hayop Ka,Justice for my boy Jerry!!!! Don't date Nimfa!!,1
Hayop Ka,“why so pang masa ang taste kuya?” HAHAHAHA,1
Hayop Ka,"Before I start being critical I have to say, this movie being the first that the Philippines didn't outsource for animation and was made in the country is really neat, along with the fact the animation just looks good, It is very good at comedy and changing art styles for effect, I got some good laughs out of it becoming hyper realistic during the sexy time parts, also the character designs are nice, Jerry objectively being my favorite because...well I love frogs and he's stylized really good, a perfect little guy design.Anyways, the plot was uh...well it was okay I guess? I found it to be a bit too melodramatic for my taste, and while I suppose you can say it is because of it being a satire on the way the tropes in Filipino media act, but even then I feel like it missed the ball sometimes. Sometimes it does good, I like the end credits of our main character learning to not be as much of a piece of shit, but something about it urks me, you know? Another person had mentioned how sort of misogynistic this movie is, and how while sometimes it does good in relation to satirizing the concepts shown, sometimes it just uh...doesn't I guess? It sort of goes well, we were satirizing this but now we mean it genuinely I suppose. This isn't me being against characters who are shitty people like the way it is in this movie, I love bad people doing awful things to each other, maybe its the cheating aspect or the over exaggeration but it comes off as more of a smear against women who want more in life. I can't blame our main character to want to be living comfortably, she works a dead end job and wants to be happy, I'm not defending her, by any stretch of the imagination, fuck her, but I feel this aura of sinister intentions. As a whole this movie is beautiful when it comes to animation, but the story is overly dramatic to the point of it being more stupid than anything else, and while the fact it is a satire saves it sometimes, other times it really isn't satirical and just dumb. Go watch it though just for the animation and some of the jokes. Maybe just once if you can't stand stupidity in your movies, but it is worth the watch.",2
Hayop Ka,"It made no sense. It's a novella type film, it's an anime and it's a soap opera, I'm genuinely wondering what I just watched.",0
Hayop Ka,"stars for the animators and, yes. hayop ang lahat ng characters.",4
Hayop Ka,"artstyle saur good i hope this won’t be the end of these type of local animated films cause we definitely hav a lot of talented artists/va’si know it’s hard to translate the nuances of tagalog but oml the english sub seems so far fetched (but that’s probably netflix translator’s fault)i didn’t even considered at how bad the story was until i came here to log it LOL (apparently it’s satire?? i kinda can see that,, kaya siguro hindi ko rin talaga pinansin yung plot lol) since it’s already ingrained sm to me that that’s jus how filipino writers work atp (but why does it keep being green lit? hindi pa ba sapat yung wantusawang teleserye plots emz) but yea that ending sucked i wanted more resolve(?) tbh so much for oversharing your love problems at an unqualified dj for thousands of people to hear amirite",6

Hayop Ka,the glory that is the animation not the writing nuh-uh,0
Hayop Ka,"So surreal to see familiar faces in the credits. It may not have a strong story but seeing the studio giving proper credits to it's animators, artists and even it's interns from different art schools in the Philippines makes the film's craft a bit more meaningful. (unlike a certain big animation studio who hasn't been crediting their crew very well...)",2
Hayop Ka,"i support local animators, pero nawbwesit talaga ako sa tema nito, sayang yung effort nung animators, bat ba kasi about adultery, misogyny, and classism yung storya nakuuusabi ko nga parang mainstream teleserye lang ampota pero kingkoy",3

Hayop Ka,"My God. Visually, this is one of the most beautifully animated pieces I've ever seen. The animation and the backgrounds are just stunning. Those textures! Animated Manila is such a treat to the eyes. Almost brought me back home. Not to mention those visual gags which you can't help but snicker as they're stupidly funny.Plotwise, the story left me wanting more. It's definitely a step-up from Avid Liongoren's previous work, Saving Sally which left me disappointed. Nevertheless, I still find it entertaining as a casual enjoyer of adult animation. This just gets me more excited for what's to come for Philippine animation!Edit: *after reading some reviews"" Yeah, I wished this film truly has something genuine and thought-provoking to say.",2

Hayop Ka,I'm giving this one star for the animation team. but this was bad. just bad.,4
Hayop Ka,naww coz the animation gives SO MUCH potential but why is the plot line just like every other filo movies/teleserye huhu,0
Hayop Ka,"Love the animation! I wish they worked more on the story though. It didn't feel right, or maybe I expected something different. Maybe it's a way to make it appealing to more people, like those who love afternoon drama shows in local TV and think cartoons are just for children? Maybe I'm reaching. haha The animators did so well!! I'm glad I finally watched this. Still enjoyed it. Made me look forward to seeing more Filipino cartoons!",2
Hayop Ka,"Great animation, bad story. It's funny and entertaining enough. But the crass language and Robin Padilla's voice were major turn-offs. Not suitable for kids.",7
Hayop Ka,2 stars for the animation and the witty signages.,4
Hayop Ka,Empoy my spirit animal,1
Hayop Ka,"The plot starts off strong but gets messy from the middle to the end. Aside from that, the tagalog dialogue is actually pretty witty at times with its innuendos. And goddamn the visuals are detailed as hell with every little thing having a reference to something like a meme or an anime. I enjoyed this a lot.",0
Hayop Ka,Filipinler yapımı olan Hayop Ka! tam bir yetişkin animasyonu. Sevgilisini zengin bir erkekle aldatan Nymph'in hikayesini izliyoruz filmde. Alışılmadık olan ise Nymph bir dişi kedi ve sevdiği erkekler de iri birer köpekler. Filmde cinsel göndermeler bir hayli fazla.Bizim pembe dizi dediğimiz telenovelalar Filipinler'de çok popülermiş ve bu film de bir nevi onların parodisi gibiymiş. İzleyenler görecektir filmde yaşananların tamamına yakınını bizim dizlerimizde de görmek mümkün.Daha önce Filipinler yapımı bir animasyon film izlememiştim. Ben filmden çok keyif aldım. Sıkmadan kendini izleten bir yapım olmuş.,5

Hayop Ka,Honestly entertained by the art style and animation even if the plot is meh,0
Hayop Ka,Fun Filipino movie! Typical Filipino trope but make it cartoonish and extra!,2
Hayop Ka,"this pinoy-furry r18 animated film could have potentially been one of the long-awaited breakthrough the philippine animation industry could have had ! though it may not be appropriate for the general audience because of its explicit language and/or sexually suggestive behavior, i do appreciate the utmost quality of the animation itself. the animation obviously takes place in the streets of manila—not only this but i love how the scenes depicted in the movie were surprisingly accurate as to what you actually see in real life IN the philippines that it’s pretty easy to identify the places the movie was set in like EDSA or Makati! the cultural similarities, the food, famous destinations, and even malls were cute to see in the film because it’s easy to relate it to what you see in real life. you would know how much effort and detail was put into animating right when you watch it and personally im a sucker for cute and vibrant art styles so !!!!aside from this, what makes the movie fun were the evident filipino mannerisms that the animators were able to show perfectly. the plot isn’t extravagant but it’s funny, it’s relatable, and it’s vulgar. although aside from this being a comedy, i think there’s a much deeper meaning to it than just the mc cheating on her boyfriend. rather to me, at least, it’s about toxic elitist culture, traditional filipino values, growing up, class differences and how capitalism and poverty affects people comes into play as seen in the movie. it was a short movie with a running time of 1 hour 13 minutes, but it was surely enjoyable! i wish more people could patronize and support filipino art and animation more :(",2

Hayop Ka,"I'm utterly disappointed by this screenplay. The animation is frankly very good, and is a step up from the already impressive Saving Sally. However, the writing just doesn't back the excellent animation. The casual misogyny everyone has been pointing out doesn't sit right with me. Many argue the story's parody status, but that satire just doesn't hold much weight or meaning. It's supposed to be a commentary on class or maybe hypocrisy, I guess. But ultimately, I was just left cold and empty by this movie.",0

Hayop Ka,"sayang,,,,",1
Hayop Ka,"I myst say I appreciated the animators in this film. The animation is bright and pleasing to the eyes and as for the voice acting... the voice acting fine... not the best but not the worst...Everything in this film is good except the storyline. I know that they to satarize the cliche plots of filipino dramas, well... for some parts they satarize it well but the rest are pretty bad especially the ending of the story. The ending of the story is so horrible and one the worst endings I see, like all I can say is nothing like it's so terrible.",-1

Hayop Ka,"An adult animated Filipino comedy, You Animal! The Nimfa Dimaano Story is cute, funny and has a delightful art style. Unfortunately, I must detract a half-star for some undeniably misogynistic attitudes in the film, specifically a climactic scene in which our protagonist is shamed and degraded by a man who the movie frames as speaking the truth. Despite her moral failings, Nimfa is charming and lovable, so there is no pleasure in watching her get eviscerated. Other than that considerable flaw, I had a very fun time watching You Animal!, which vastly exceeded my expectations given the low Letterboxd score.",5

Hayop Ka,"This was so great. The drama alone was incredible; it had that true, Filipino charm to it. But the unique art styles utilized in the film really got to me—they were perfectly timed, too!

What really stands out in this though is the animation that actually has a really cool style to it and moves pretty fluidly. There are even some well animated Dragon Ball parodies that I wasn't expecting. I would love to see this same animation crew takes on a better script. This wasn't anything great, but I don't regret watching at least for the animation alone. I",0
Hayop Ka,"Ralph Bakshi’s cult feature debut ‘Fritz the Cat’ gets a sort of a spiritual successor in romantic satire ‘You Animal!’ – a tongue-in-cheek parody of Pinoy telenovelas in which characters reportedly scream the titular phrase at each other in the heat of an argument. Deliciously saucy and irreverently melodramatic, it revolves around a love triangle between a saleslady or rather, salescat, Nimfa, her macho mongrel boyfriend, Roger, who works as a janitor, and a purebred (husky?) playboy industrialist, Iñigo Villanueva, with whom she fulfills her fantasy of climbing up the social ladder. (Did I mention that the story is actually prophesized by an octopus fortune teller?)The colorfully mesmerizing artwork may look cute, with all protagonists being talking animals, but this is by no means a kids cartoon, given its rampant sex jokes and lines such as “my bun is quite content with your hot dog”, not to mention a highly stylized (read: deliberately kitschy) intercourse scene. However, it is not to be taken too seriously either, which Liongoren and his team of artists constantly emphasize through visual gags such as witty inscriptions hanging all around ‘Zootopia-fied’ Manila, some literal catfight or a rage-fueled scene inspired by the ‘Street Fighter’ car-crashing bonus game. The social commentary is there, but it is the animators’ wild and free imagination that comes first, reflected in a wonderful world building, and full control of the medium.",5
