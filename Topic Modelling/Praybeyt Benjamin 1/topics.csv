Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"Waste of everything watching this movie.: I never expect this movie to be good and one thing in mind, surely it is WORST. And wow! yes! yes! I did the right expectation on this movie.

There's no story at all its all time wasting moment,

i prefer to read the oldest newspaper than sitting in front of TV watching this crap.

But I cannot deny and I can't still imagine and can't still find the answer why this movie became the top grosser of all time.

Waste of everything watching this movie. Only kids can enjoy for those with have a very low humor.

I hope foreign people missed to see this garbage",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"Good Comedy Movie: First of all, I would like to congratulate Star Cinema/ABS-CBN Film Productions and Viva Films for having Praybeyt Benjamin as one of the highest grossing Filipino film of all time.

The movie was quite hilarious and the storyline of having a gay soldier is a good idea, though not anymore unique. Nevertheless, what made it different from any other films with gay soldiers is that they mixed genres. They added a touch of science fiction (SciFi) and drama (Family Rivalry). And, thankfully, the romance they have put was only for the sake of comedy, and not being focused on the romance alone because if they did, it would appear mainstream which the Filipino taste is already burn of.

The camera rolling techniques that have been used was on average, and the CGIs appeared to be similar to that of old Filipino films (which I have to admit devastated me).

Heavy screen portrayal got no place in this kind of movie because it does not showcase heavy drama. However, I believe that some of the actors underacted making some scenes awkward and unnatural.

Overall, it reached 7/10.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"Actual Kino: Certified Vice Ganda Kinoplex moment. This movie is peak fiction, if I could rate this 100,000,000/10 I would've. This movie is a must see in the next white boy summer.",0

Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"We have to admit — at the time this film was groundbreaking. Vice Ganda was paving the way for more LGBTQIA+ Films with an actual LGBTQIA+ representation in Philippine Cinema. This film, which now many may not always appreciate, is still a feel-good movie for many Filipinos. Regardless of the shallow comedy, its magic in connecting with trends at its time, as well as heralding the Pinoy humor, makes this a staple film in every Filipino household.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"i love it when an ensemble cast has their own agendas like thats my band of misfits coming together to serve (in the military).i dont really get why people say this is a bad film when it really is a family friendly comedy film about outsiders wanting to people to be proud of them, and at the end of the day, that is just every filipino.i think that's why near the beginning of the film benjamin reiterates that someday people will be proud of him! and he suceeds this not by fitting in with the hypermasculine standard but the authentic him. this is not a stupid film, instead, it's well written!booing everyone that hates a film just because it's a comedy at the forefront!",0

With their 9 to 5s and responsibilities. I would love to see more films & tv shows that will make people happy :)) , forget about their troubles, all while being relatable & uplifting. The good thing about creating art is how u don’t really have to invent anymore. With everything that’s happening in the world. We do not have the luxury of creating art that is not a reflection of our society",0

Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"a classic. (word vomit ahead)i mean gets na some plot might be problematic in today's generation but still it's iconic.it shows how society views queer people— as a queer myself in a country where you're treated as plague it's hard to express yourself. it might be normalized now in ph, but i still think it's not totally accepted, we're just tolerated. queer people has to prove themselves by achieving something just to fill in their ""flaws"" because for them to accept you—you have to be this successful individual or else you're nothing but labeled as ""salot sa lipunan"". it's hard when what you only want is respect as a human being :)",1

Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"With the announcement of Vice Ganda's new project with Jun Lana in the works, I thought I would revisit some of the films in his filmography and I gotta say, while Praybeyt Benjamin didn't exactly age all that well, it became the better Mulan live action we deserve lmao. I mean, imagine that. It has all of Wenn V. Deramas' stylings and add to that a fresh out of the gates of his success as a noontime host and celebrated comedian, getting the chance to helm his own movie, Vice Ganda shows up here with his signature comedic style. The only thing is, and my Dad has said this before and I agree, there's a Vice who gets directed to say jokes and there's a Vice who does adlibs and jokes impromptu that somehow shows a completely polarizing way you experience his comedy. Here, the gags and style were fresh for that time. His command of the camera feels special but it wore out at some point because I feel like Vice does well in situations in the moment not exactly prepared for him. I do have to say, in the moments that allow him to show vulnerability, I don't hate it, especially with the theme of ""a gay man having to play up being a brusque man in order to serve in the military"". Yes, the theme of why should it be any different for him to serve his country as a gay man than being the stereotypical cishet with big muscles? Sure, this feels like a propaganda film but if you're gonna serve your country , SERVE CUNT lmaoooooAnyway, it's still a shame that they didn't get Jimmy Santos in the second movie to play Benji's dad.

Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"2/5First ViewingIt's so weird to watch a film empowering baklas but also being a slight to baklas as well... there's too much to unpack: the criticism on misogyny in armed forces (but also using tokenistic characters to show masculinity), the essence of family pride encompassing gender, or even love (though with a huge statement that ""real"" girls are ""better"")... it's a lot.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"Vice Ganda's comedy in 2011 doesn't age well, but I still laughed at this one. This is the best of Wenn Deramas' collaborations with Vice Ganda, tied only by Beauty and the Bestie.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,it's these types of movies with low-quality humor founded on stereotypes and bigoted thinking that cause people to see filipino cinema as nothing but subpar to hollywood (understandably so),0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,It didn't age well but it's very fascinating to see Vice Ganda in his first starring feature and his previous comedic style in its prime.,0

Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities. Directed by Wenn V. Deramas who pretty much pumps out films year after year of the same quality. To make everything clear, this is not a good movie but is enjoyable enough that its watchable at least. Vice Ganda who is funny in his Pinoy variety show ""Its Showtime"", is not as funny here, which I expected since the reason he's funny in his show is because its improv, but here it feels forced and plain corny. The thing about these movies that you know its bad but it has a sense that the people making it were just having the time of their lives. There are way more jokes that miss than hit but you can laugh at how bad a joke really is.Overall, This is regular pinoy fare that everyone gobbles up because 1.) its a comedy, 2.) Its all good vibes, and 3.) Vice Ganda is in it. Fun Fact: When this came out it was the highest grossing film of the Philippines, which really tells you a lot about the state of films in the Philippines.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"Thanks to Vice Ganda & NikkiValdez's performances, the movie was saved from its bad plot, bad special effects and bad action scenes",0

Praybeyt Benjamin 1,A Filipino spoof of Mulan with a laughing twist.,-1
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"A movie loosely based on Disney's Mulan wherein the main protagonist takes his father's place in the army (but, instead of being a woman, a male homosexual in the movie). As a piece of Story-telling material it is honestly a pretty abhorrent film - with the entire premise of the film focusing only on Comedy and purely comedy with the expense of the story.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,Watching grass grow would've made me laugh more than watching this film. I am really confused how this became a box office hit.,0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,I really don't find this movie very funny. So that is why I am confused on to how it became the top grosser in Filipino Movies.,0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"A funny and comedy movie that will surely tickle your laughter side up to the end of the movie with all the comedy antics and hilarious punchlines of Vice Ganda in his second topbill movie after Petrang Kabayo. Though, I find Petra funnier than Praybeyt Benjamin, this movie stands on its own for having unique story, casts, theme and of course comedy scenes! Though some say the comedic punchlines of Vice is predictable and very ""Showtime"", this movie is still good for anyone who wants to cheer up and of course to have a good loud laugh!",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"If I were to choose between watching this film and buying a cheeseburger at the same price, there's no doubt, I'd go cheeseburger .",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"This movie was such a laugh-out-loud experience the first time I watched it; not so much the second time. Still, itâ(TM)s a movie I would easily choose to re-watch over most local comedies today if ever I should need a pick-me-up movie in the future.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"Not as great as it was made out to be by the media. It had its funny moments, but not the rolling on the floor type of laughter reviews I read about it made it out to be.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,Another time killer film from Star Cinema.,0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"It's the funniest Filipino film of 2011. The lack of realism is a factor, however, and too much promotion of homosexuality is not much of a liking.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"The funniest Filipino movie of the year, Vice Ganda proved that sheâ(TM)s/heâ(TM)s/itâ(TM)s even â~unkabogableâ(TM) in box office industry. But giggles are accompanied by overacting performances, unnecessary things and cornier-than-popcorn scenes (especially scenes that make you cover your faces!). The story is new to the Filipino screens but not to â~Mulanâ(TM) (Disney) herself.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"This movie don't make sense, Really Stupid. Definitely will not recommend it SUCKS! .",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,sobrang kulet lang =),0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"There is nothing spectacular about this movie but you will surely have a good laugh that's for sure. Aside from the comedy angle, the movie tries to be socially relevant by tackling the issue of gays in the family and in the military however, they just introduced it but had no follow through, the issue was kinda left hanging and was overshadowed by the jokes and killer lines of Vice Ganda. 3 stars for touching the funny side in me.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,Value for money. The usual problem I experience with pinoy comedy movies is they tend to sacrifice the story flow just to make people. It sucks when rhey do the traditional ''tanga'' character co it aint funny. But with this movie things are way different. There is no dull time and the moral lesson was clearly stated. SEXUAL PREFERENCE IS NOT A HINDRANCE TO SUCESS.,0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"Riding on the coattails of Vice Ganda's popularity and comedic antics, the movie is nothing but a two-hour display of comedy: punch line after punch line, with slapstick inserted every now and then. Forget the chance of a story, logic, or far-flung reality; just hold on for the fun hoping it wouldn't crash.",0
Praybeyt Benjamin 1,"Surprisingly funny, Filipinos know how to do comedy.",0
