Sunshine,"""I wanted to be brave for these girls"": Sunshine is on the verge of joining the national gymnastics team and going to the Olympics, when she loses focus, careens off balance, and falters. Dreams nearly in her grasp shift to distant phantoms as she realizes she is pregnant. Shaken, fearful, desperate, and determined not to lose her rightful place on the national team, Sunshine searches the underground of the city for abortifacients. Abortion and even divorce are illegal in the Philippines, so Sunshine has few options and few people she can trust. Just then a mysterious young girl appears in the darkness and crowded streets with knowledge of Sunshine's heart that surprises her and touches her deeply.

""I wanted to be brave for these girls,"" said Maris Racal (Sunshine) ""who have no one else to turn to."" Racal is intrinsically believable in her role. In the conservative religious culture of the Philippines and with the lack of access to reproductive support, many girls are in crisis. The issue is relatable and timely not just in the Philippines, but in many other countries including, unfortunately, our own.

At this world premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, director Antoinette Jadaone said she got the idea for an imaginary friend from the film Jojo Rabbit. As part of her film research Jadaone interviewed girls who had abortions. She hopes the film sparks conversations and change, that it is part of the solution for the country, and helps girls in such situations make their own decisions.",17
Sunshine,"An honest, genuine and raw moving story!: I've seen this movie at the cinema alone last night and truly I can say that this is absolutely a genuine heartfelt cinematic experience movie. The story is really an eye opening for everyone especially for the young teenage women out there. It was really sad and heartbreaking story for a young athlete who had a dream to do good in gymnastics in the olympics but struggled in the process because of getting pregnant and doing an abortion in order to do so. One of the best part in the movie wherein I cried and felt bad for the main lead actress was her motel scene, where there is quietness of being alone but all you can hear is the noise of the train running in the background. This scene was very raw and sad to watch especially the time when she struggled so hard to abort her baby just to make sure that she can continue with her dream in the gymnastics. Overall this movie, definitely can be a great contender at the Oscars International Film Feature especially by how cinematic, and compelling the story was. I love how the movie tackled a controversial topic that everyone needs to hear and be open about. Maris Racal and her eyes in this movie is seriously a gem, such an amazing and effective best actress of this generation.",5
Sunshine,"This is the sunshine the country needs in today's climate.: This is the sunshine the country needs in today's climate.

It was Jadaone's courage that popped in my head when the title card flashed, a very Filipina name that connotes brightness and warmth - two things the film was not intended for, two things the titular character deprived of.

Sunshine is a story of every Sunshine, a Filipino woman vulnerable to systemic injustice and oppression; a story no one could have been told better than a Filipino woman herself - and a fearless and intelligent one at that. From reproductive health and general health care system to conservatism, Jadaone's care and spirit championed. Her personification of one's conscience was beautifully done. I sobbed through the last 15 minutes.

True-to-life darkness in the country executed from the literal streets to the contexts of quality of life through Orendain's realism. There's a harrowing frame in the movie that ticked all my boxes as a fan of dark cinematography. I bled in the dark with Sunshine right there.

This film boasts a talented bundle of actresses: Meryll Soriano, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, Jennica Garcia, with Maris Racal tying the ribbon, flexing her acting muscles across different tones and needs. Well-written and well-directed performances with standouts coming from Garcia, Co, and Racal. Ah, women.

Malalim. Matapang. Mahalaga. Hindi ako babae pero gets na gets kita, Sunshine.",12
Sunshine,"Nice movie.: It follows a young gymnast who discovers she is pregnant on the week of the national team tryouts. On her way to a seller of illegal abortion drugs, she meets a mysterious girl who eerily talks and thinks like her.

Dude the cinematography and camera angles in this trailer is what I have been wishing Philippine Cinema would have already been by now. Not the disappointing films they keep hyping and giving fake accolade.

Finally, a realistic story, not about kabit, poor/rich love story, badings. This is a realistic struggle of teen pregnancy in the Phil.

Sobrang deserve ni Maris makakuha ng maraming awards sa acting! Ang ganda! Ang galing!",-1
Sunshine,"Perfect execution: Directed by: Antoinette Jadaone Written by: Antoinette Jadaone

SUMMARY

A teenage gymnast, training to compete in the Olympics, is derailed when she discovers she's pregnant. In the Philipppines, where abortion is illegal, she risks everything to end the pregnancy. After surviving a near-fatal scam abortion pill, she finally succeeds and finds closure in a vision of her future child giving her her blessing.

RATING

S

Sunshine is absolutely perfect filmmaking. A simple plot - so simple that it risks being stale, but isn't! - that is executed with perfection and nuance. Sometimes the hardest things to get right are those that are the simplest. Superb casting.",17
Sunshine,"A Powerful 10/10 Film That Tells the Truth: This 2024 Filipino film follows a teenage gymnast, Sunshine, whose Olympic dreams are suddenly derailed when she finds out she's pregnant. What unfolds is a raw, deeply emotional journey through shame, societal pressure, and the painful reality of having no legal access to abortion-something many women across Asia still face today.

The film doesn't sugarcoat anything. It shows exactly what's wrong with restrictive abortion laws in many Asian countries-how they silence girls, punish ambition, and force life-changing decisions on those who are still children themselves.

The movie itself is honest, hard-hitting, and emotionally devastating in the best way.

Maris Racal's performance was absolutely stunning. She carries the entire film with a performance that is real, raw, and unforgettable.

Sunshine should be shown in classrooms, government offices, and households. It's that important. It sparks urgent conversations about women's rights, bodily autonomy, and the price of silence.

Sunshine is one of the most courageous and necessary films to come out of Southeast Asia in recent years. It holds up a mirror to society and forces viewers to face uncomfortable truths. Anyone who thinks film can't change minds hasn't seen this one yet.

This is not just a good movie-this is essential cinema.

10/10. A masterpiece.",-1
Sunshine,"One of the most important Filipino films: ""Sunshine"" is not just the greatest Filipino movie I've seen but one of the most important Filipino films of all-time! This film deals with controversial topics in our society, abortion and teen pregnancy.

A week of national tryout for the gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal) finds out that she's pregnant. Conflicts arise as she has to decide what to do next. In between life and dreams, what's the most significant between the two?

The film is unconventional at best. This is not your usual and average Filipino drama you'll see. It's a character study about a teenager who is on the down side of her life. We follow her journey through this life and see a glimpse of her life dealing with her problem.

Maris Racal defines this film as Sunshine. Her acting here is brilliant. She's perfect for this role. Jennica Garcia surprised me. Her character as Sunshine's sister marks! What she said to Sunshine near the ending, though it's common, is like a punch to tears! I ended up loving her character. Jennica Garcia deserves an award for being the best supporting actress for this role. Another cast that standout is Rhed Bustamante and Xyriel Manabat both deserve a recognition for their role.

Blurring between reality and fantasy, mostly this film is realistic in portraying the whole theme thanks to Direk Antoinette Jadaone directions. Also, the cinematography is the best!

Overall, ""Sunshine"" is a women's movie. It's timely, affecting and brave to its theme. It doesn't spoon feed. It will make you immersed and think. It's worth an experience. This is a rare Filipino movie I've seen! I'm glad and proud watching this in cinema. After watching ""Sunshine"", it leaves me with a question, ""Is abortion a choice if your greatest dream will compromise?""",12
Sunshine,"Sunshine is the collective experience of many Filipina: We watched Sunshine yesterday, July 24, during the block screening at SM Megamall. I had seen the trailer beforehand, so I knew we were in for something bold, something necessary. But I wasn't prepared for how deeply it would sit with me long after the credits rolled.

I didn't cry while watching the film, but once it ended, I found myself overwhelmed. The weight of Sunshine doesn't hit all at once - it lingers, it settles. And it stays.

At its core, Sunshine is the story of a woman taking control of her body in a society that keeps telling her she isn't allowed to. It's not simply about one choice, one moment, or one woman. It's about the collective experience of many Filipinas who navigate a system that consistently fails to hear them.

Antoinette Jadaone's direction doesn't shy away from discomfort. She faces it head-on, inviting the audience to confront the silences we've learned to live with - about abortion, reproductive rights, the stigma around sexuality, and the lack of access to informed sex education in the Philippines.

Sunshine is timely, urgent, and painfully real. It gives voice to the cry of our generation, echoing the need for progressive reforms that protect women and children. The film challenges its viewers not just to empathize, but to act.

As a viewer, I left the cinema not only moved, but also awakened. Sunshine isn't here to entertain. It's here to disturb, to provoke, and to push us into uncomfortable yet necessary conversations.

To my fellow Filipinos: let's not turn away. Let's create spaces where women can speak freely, where choices about their bodies are met with compassion, not judgment. Let's demand that our lawmakers stop treating reproductive health as taboo.

To filmmakers and storytellers: keep telling these stories. We need more films like Sunshine-bold, unapologetic, and grounded in truth. The personal is political, and cinema has the power to move both heart and policy.

Let Sunshine be a beginning. Let it be a spark. And let's keep the conversation going.",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine - A Raw and Eye-Opening Film: Sunshine is truly an eye-opener. It bravely tackles real issues that so many young adults-and even kids who are just stepping into their teenage years-are silently going through. The film dives deep into the realities of early pregnancy, abortion, and the emotional and social weight that comes with them.

What I really hope is that parents take the time to watch this film. Not just to be aware, but to feel that urgency-the need to guide and talk to their children about these sensitive but important topics. It's a conversation that can't be delayed anymore.

What stood out to me the most was how real and raw everything felt. I didn't leave the cinema feeling happy, but I did feel relieved. I felt the pain, the heartache, and the struggle that Sunshine went through-but I also saw the strength in her journey. The story is complete. It gives you everything from beginning to end, no shortcuts, no sugar-coating.

I loved the film. I honestly want to watch it again-not just for the story, but for the emotions it stirred up and the awareness it brings. This film matters.",20
Sunshine,"Perfect, Very Relevant: Will keep this short, but I can't due to the minimum characters. It perfectly captures and delivers the message it intends to relay. Just beautiful! Loved it!

Very, very relevant. Moves you even if you yourself cannot directly relate, and that is where the magic proves itself!

Great acting as well by almost everyone in the cast!",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine: The performances are outstanding, with the lead actress delivering a raw and emotional portrayal of Sunshine's struggles. The supporting cast adds depth to the story, particularly the little girl, who brings a sense of wonder and curiosity to the film.

One of the most striking aspects of ""Sunshine"" is its refusal to provide easy answers. The film presents a realistic portrayal of the complexities surrounding reproductive choices, leaving viewers to ponder the moral implications.",20
Sunshine,"Still processing. This film stays with you.: Maris Racal delivers an incredibly raw and grounded performance. You feel her tension, her fear, her hope and the heartbreak that comes from making an impossible decision. She doesn't ask you to agree with her character. She just asks you to understand. And that's powerful.

Direk Tonet Jadaone has once again proven her gift for telling stories that cut deep. This film doesn't shout, but it lingers. It haunts you in the quiet moments. It reflects a reality many would rather not see one where shame is louder than support, and judgment comes faster than help.",25
Sunshine,"Responsibility is Also a Choice: The film Sunshine, directed by Antoinette Jadaone, presents a deeply emotional and socially relevant story that challenges how Filipinos view teenage pregnancy, abortion, and womanhood. It is a complex and sensitive topic, especially in a country that is deeply rooted in religion and traditional values. As a viewer and as someone who is pro-abortion, I strongly believe that abortion should be legalized-not to promote recklessness, but to ensure safe healthcare for women who are placed in impossible situations.

What makes Sunshine powerful is how quietly but painfully it reflects reality. The film does not exaggerate emotions; instead, it shows how fear, confusion, and pressure from society weigh heavily on young women. It highlights how judgment often speaks louder than understanding. In many cases, the girl is seen as the only one responsible for what happened, while the systems meant to protect her fail.

In the Philippines, many people argue that illegalizing abortion teaches responsibility. But isn't choosing abortion also a form of responsibility? Knowing that you are not ready-emotionally, financially, or mentally-to raise a child can already be an act of maturity. We openly preach safe sex, yet we deny women access to safe abortion. This contradiction puts women's lives at risk.

For me, this issue is not about the rights of a fetus alone-it is also about the rights of a living woman. In my own view, if my mother had gotten pregnant in her teenage years while still chasing her dreams, I would rather not be born than be the reason her future was taken away. I would not remember it, I would not suffer from that decision-but at least she would have lived the life she wanted. That, too, is a form of love and sacrifice.

Another harsh reality the film touches on is how society treats teenagers who experience early pregnancy. Many say, ""They enjoyed it,"" or ""They wanted it."" But a child or a teenager needs guidance from responsible adults, not condemnation. Blaming them does not fix the problem. This is not about tolerating impulsive behavior-it is about educating both girls and boys, teaching accountability, protection, and respect.

Sunshine makes you realize that judgment is easy, but compassion is rare. The film reminds us that behind every controversial situation is a scared, confused young girl who still deserves empathy and protection.

Overall, Sunshine is a brave and emotionally heavy film that forces us to confront one of the most uncomfortable issues in Filipino society. It does not give easy answers, but it asks the right questions. For me, the film strengthens the belief that abortion should be legalized-not to promote irresponsibility, but to protect women, save lives, and give them the freedom to choose their own future. True responsibility does not come from punishment and shame, but from understanding, education, and safe choices. Sunshine is not just a movie-it is a mirror of our society and a challenge to our beliefs.",-1
Sunshine,"A Missed Opportunity to Stick the Landing: I had been waiting a long time to watch Sunshine, especially since I never got the chance to see it on the big screen. So, when it finally arrived on Netflix, I was so excited, only for that excitement to fade the longer I watched.

The premise is undeniably compelling: a young gymnast discovers she's pregnant just as her lifelong dream of reaching the Olympics is within reach. It's a setup filled with emotional stakes and potential for a powerful, character-driven story.

But instead of exploring her dedication to the sport, the film shifts almost entirely to her pregnancy and her attempts to deal with it. I kept waiting for scenes that would show her fighting for her dream, intense training, the pressure of competition, the physical and emotional toll of gymnastics, but those moments never really come. The narrative focuses more on side characters and subplots that feel unnecessary and, frankly, uninteresting.

I couldn't help comparing this film to other international athlete biopics that portray the grit, passion, and relentless work behind the journey. Sunshine had all the ingredients to deliver that kind of inspiring story, but it simply doesn't stick the landing.

Overall, I'm disappointed. With a stronger focus on the athletic journey and the challenges of balancing an unexpected pregnancy with Olympic ambitions, this could have been a much more compelling and memorable film.",17
Sunshine,"This film truly highlights how anti abortion is violence against women: While the subject is powerful and brave and the acting excellent, the execution and cinematography are weak, marring what could have been an excellent film.

What it does well is highlight how anti abortion is violence against women. It shows how the anti abortion crowd destroys the lives of young women through lack of sex education and lack of health care combined with horrid anti women propaganda.

The hospital scene where the evil ""Jesus"" Dr. Berates the propagandist for attempting an abortion absolutely enraged me because it is so accurate as to how women are treated.

I think the film would have been better if it has put more emphasis on Sunshine's sister who supported and helped her. I wanted more of that.

All that said, this is a powerful and timely film about an important subject. I applaud all those involved for having the courage to show the evil at the heart of Filipino culture, and for daring to stand up against the ""pro life"" machine.",5
Sunshine,"TIFF 2024 #41: Centrepiece (World Premiere)Gripping, distressing - among many things that can be said to describe the experience of a woman who could just as easily lose everything she ever knew with as much as a single unplanned pregnancy. But perhaps the added stress to watching Sunshine is only exacerbated by the environment in which our title character is inhabiting, where the conservative religious and social norms of the Philippines are infringing on her own rights as a human being too.Really liked this one a whole lot.",-1
Sunshine,So was that girl a personified version of her fetus or was she literally just stalking her?,-1
Sunshine,"World Premiere at TIFF 2024! Maris is magnetic. She makes the movie. I also wanna commend Jennica Garcia! I was deeply moved by her. The storytelling I wanna say is quite…unexpected. It added to the layers of the movie and I just know this will totally ruffle feathers when it finally gets shown in the Philippines. Even on the Q&A Director Antoinette Jadaone mentioned she wanted to spark the conversation on this, to which I hope people don’t take for granted. Also, the cameos! I live for them.",-1
Sunshine,TIFF 2024 - World Premiere. I really enjoyed this one—happy to see more creative and bold films being made in the Philippines.  Protect our women. ,-1
Sunshine,"TIFF film #2 (World Premiere) I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but damn, what a pleasant surprise. I felt so hard for the lead character, with an solid performance from Maris Racal. She carried the movie, alone, brilliantly. It really show how decisions made by men (that doesn't have a lot of screen time in this movie) can impact the lives of women and girls. This movie really opened up conversations after the screening (for my friends and I) and I hope it will do the same after it open in the Philippines. I'm glad I saw that movie and I learned a lot, still processing things.",-1
Sunshine,"TIFF film #4 – a simple, straightforward piece about women's sexual and reproductive health and rights in the Philippines, and a portrait into the country's politics, faith, societal pressures and expectations, and gender roles. the film is carried both by its message and by Maris Racal's great performance (there is also very few supporting characters – honorable mention to Sunshine's ate). i enjoyed the cinematography and the boldness in the telling of this story. looking forward to the conversations + reception of this film, especially within the Filipinx diaspora.",-1
Sunshine,TIFF Film #14: Well received in Toronto but I expect this to be divisive in PH and will spark conversations. Probably the film by which the audiences are too eager to attend the Q&A (as handfuls only left after the credits of the world premiere screening). A very important film which is very timely to be told and the Jojo Rabbit inspired reference gives lighter touch to the dark subject. The Piolo Pascual cameo is noteworthy and unsettling (I Am aloof to any forms of pastors lol).,-1
Sunshine,"i watched the world premiere for this film for tiff 2024. maris racal’s performance in this film is ABSOLUTELY amazing. she embodies the character so well and its a lot of pressure to carry being that her screen time is 90% of the film.the pacing of the film was pretty good in the 2nd half. I found the first part to be repetitive and didnt contribute to the characters development nor the storyline.overall, since the directors main intention is to spark a conversation, i will be looking forward to the reception of this movie once it is released to a wider audience. the subject matter is a very sensitive topic especially in the ph. different religious, political, and cultural perspectives regarding abortion are depicted in the movie and i have no doubt that it will receive strong criticism but perhaps thats only the start.",25

Sunshine,"tiff 24 maris racal was so so great as sunshine. this film did a great job portraying the horrors a woman has to go through without access to safe abortions. it’ll definitely spark a conversation as intended by direk jadaone, which i think is necessary for the development of women’s reproductive rights in the philippines",-1

Sunshine,"a very important film with such a precise and well thought out look into the real conditions of young filipina women in PH.honestly what i rlly loved about the movie, besides the themes and messages it portrays, is its efficient uses of every single scene in the movie. there's no unnecessary scene in this movie that doesn't forward the character's arc, the pace of the movie and it's messages. everyone's performances are top notch and every beat hits very hard emotionally. nd it rlly is such a realistic portrayal of what folks go through in the philippines when it comes to reproduction rights. i love how this movie covers every part of this issue without it feeling hamfisted and blatant, such as not only the stigmatization, but also the economic conditions of every day filipinos (u can argue the kids might be that, but honestly it was a good narrative tool in what otherwise be on insight we might not be able to obtain). i sincerely hope this movie gets distributed widely nd ESPECIALLY in the philippines.great way to end tiff 2024!!!",-1

Sunshine,"sunshine: ma, buntis akomama niya: padayon ",2
Sunshine,"This is a film of two parts. This film is part compelling drama, with a strong lead performance from the young actor and a powerful examination of the treatment of women in the Phillipines. This film is also part surrealist, but in a way that I feel undermines the strengths of the film. There is a young girl who appears at various points throughout the film; her identity is left to interpretation. However I feel that this apparition weakens every scene she's in. You'll have this powerful understated drama and then this wise-cracking girl appears to swear at you. It is clear that they couldn't even make her fit throughout the film because she disappears for at least half an hour in the middle. The filmmaker said this was the original core concept of the film and I understand that, but I feel that the film moved beyond the need for this character. I will say that I found the final interaction between the girl and our protagonist quite touching. Maybe if the girl was more understated it could have worked better. I do want to mention that it was really lovely to be in the TIFF audience for this one; the Filipino community was so passionate about this film and it was the longest and most involved Q&A I'd ever seen. It's really inspiring to see how beloved it was.",-1
Sunshine,"Switching between goofy magic realism, teenage coming-of-age clichés and a gritty look at the reality of trying to get an abortion in the Philippines — which is prohibited in the constitution itself — Sunshine is a heartfelt story with an angry edge. Maris Racal stars as the wonderfully-named Sunshine Francisco, an aspiring gymnast whose potential tryouts at the Olympics are derailed by an unexpected pregnancy. With no officials to turn to, she is forced to search the black market, where she is followed by a strange young girl (Annika Co) who appears to be a figment of her imagination (it’s obvious when no one else interacts!). While the film certainly draws awareness to this issue of women’s rights in the Philippines, Jadaone’s cornier tendencies overwhelm the message.Part of our Berlinale Generation coverage",17

Entre en haut à gauche un groupe de racistes qui se moquent ouvertement du film en imitant les personnages et en haut à droite un autre groupe qui n’a pas arrêté de discuter littéralement pendant plus de la moitié du film ?? Les profs par pitié servez à quelque chose et contenez vous élèves ?Bref le film est important, tellement important qu’il n’a pas encore été montré en Philippines à cause du contexte politique là-bas. Tout le monde joue bien c’est sûr. Maintenant au niveau de la réalisation askip la réal a plutôt l’habitude tourner des rom-com et ça se sent ? Mais ce qui m’a le plus gênée et qui me gêne tout le temps anyway c’est la personification d’unborn child. Le film est 10000% pro avortement mais je sais pas, je suis toujours embêtée qu’on personnifie des personnes qui n’existent pas et n’existeront jamais ? Pour nous faire ressentir quoi exactement ? Parce que ok, dans le contexte de ce film ça donne une autre dimension et une sorte de profondeur au sujet mais still ? Je comprends pas trop.",-1

Sunshine,"if you’re EU citizen, sign this petition: citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000004_eni hoped that annoying kid was just like her inner child/conscience not an actual imagined child/fetus. all of the arguments against abortion are that „you’re killing the baby” so why would you choose to portray it as such? again, no real consequences for men as always in these kind of films. just women helping women, men getting on with their lives.from the upside, i get the sentiment and the portrayal of female solidarity, nice touch.can’t not compare it to situation in Poland, where similarly in the largely catholic country (on paper) women die each year less from the complications, more because doctors refuse to abort even wanted pregnancies turn miscarriage. there were many cases where miscarriages would lead to sepsis and doctors would just wait for „natural birth” not to be prosecuted. people behind the largest Polish pro-abortion organisation face prosecutions.",4

Dabei ist es bemerkenswert, wie umfassend die Thematik in den gesellschaftlichen Kontext eingebettet wird. Auch die Darstellung der Gedanken von Sunshine, wie sie verzweifelt und nicht weiter weiß, ist äußerst gelungen. Lediglich der Rahmen des Films - das Turnen für Olympia - ist nicht nach meinem Geschmack.PS: Im Q&A berichteten die Filmemacher, dass die Philippinen neben dem Vatikan das einzige Land sind, in welchem Scheidungen illegal sind.

Sunshine,"Tiff Catchup cause I'm racing to log 2024 movies watched #5This and Queer are not just the best movies I saw at TIFF, but both are experiences that have stuck with me throughout the last year. Just like how Queer paved an honest way of portraying gay men, Sunshine isn't like an abortion movie I've seen before. I'm always excited to watch a Filipino movie that breaks out into a critically praised festival run. As a Filipino who grew up in a family that owned a lot of Filipino movies, I was never a fan to be quite real with you. Filipino movies ranged from Hallmark style romances, repetitive action movies and cheesy low budget horror (although Shake, Rattle and Roll did slap). But every once in a blue moon there comes an ambitious director who tells an honest Filipino story that is both intimate in its narrative and expansive in its political themes. Sunshine doesn't hold your hand the way mainstream Filipino cinema does. It takes you on this journey of this ambitious woman who has to make the toughest choice of her life in order to determine her future. Surreal manifestations of her consciousness is brought out by imaginary characters in a way I never saw in abortion centred stories. Its so powerful. Want to watch this again with my parents. I met the director at Tiff too! :D the only person I met at the festival. While everyone else I knew wanted to get into the big films I patiently waited with my friend to see this hidden gem.",-1

Sunshine,"In the Philippines, Catholicism is the predominant religion comprising around 80% of the population. Because of the church’s influence, the country’s policy is restrictive and conservative, especially regarding family planning. Considering the social context, Jadaone’s attempt to address the topic of abortion is certainly admirable, but the simplistic and tear-jerking way it is done leaves much to be desired.asianmoviepulse.com/2025/02/film-review-sunshine-2024-by-antoinette-jadaone/",11
Sunshine,"Very moving. Very emotional. Sunshine's story is probably one of many young women in the Philippines and it is important that every single one counts. The film shows more than clearly the difficulties and impossibilities that are placed in the way of young women (or far too often children) and that sometimes there is no way out when everyone really is against you. The film shows that you can be strong on your own, but that your environment is also so essential. A really important film!",12
Sunshine,"Switching between goofy magic realism, teenage coming-of-age clichés and a gritty look at the reality of trying to get an abortion in the Philippines — which is prohibited in the constitution itself — Sunshine is a heartfelt story with an angry edge. Maris Racal stars as the wonderfully-named Sunshine Francisco, an aspiring gymnast whose potential tryouts at the Olympics are derailed by an unexpected pregnancy. With no officials to turn to, she is forced to search the black market, where she is followed by a strange young girl (Annika Co) who appears to be a figment of her imagination (it’s obvious when no one else interacts!). While the film certainly draws awareness to this issue of women’s rights in the Philippines, Jadaone’s cornier tendencies overwhelm the message.Reviewed as part of our Berlinale Generation coverage",17
Sunshine,"Antes que nada he de decir que la la cinematografía de Pao Orendain en Sunshine es un deleite: sus planos capturan la ciudad de manera natural, con un lenguaje de cámara preciso que da vida a la historia con una sencillez bella y efectiva. A través de una mirada profundamente realista, Antoinette Jadaone narra la historia de una adolescente atrapada en una sociedad que niega la libertad de la mujer sobre su cuerpo.La película muestra de manera sutil pero poderosa el conflicto interno de la protagonista, atrapada entre sus deseos, su futuro y las estrictas normas y creencias impuestas por su entorno.El guion, que entrelaza la historia con la presencia de una misteriosa niña pequeña que persigue a Sunshine, ofrece una reflexión sobre cómo las cargas y creencias sociales se transmiten de generación en generación; subrayando la continuidad de esas presiones a lo largo del tiempo.",-1

Sunshine,very timely,1
Sunshine,"What sets ‘Sunshine’ apart is how writer-director Antoinette Jadaone roots the film in the Philippines’ conservative culture, shaped by Catholicism and its influence on public policies. While some moments may feel a bit heavy-handed, Jadaone delivers an earnest take on the tension between religious values and societal realities, while occasionally poking fun at certain hypocrisies. Another unique aspect of ‘Sunshine’ is how it weaves in magic realism. This creative approach, which is like a mix of Taika Waititi’s ‘Jojo Rabbit’ and Celine Sciamma’s ‘Petite Maman’, might not be for everyone; nevertheless, it enriches the discourse and keeps the narrative from feeling simplistic.

Sunshine,"I was at an exclusive screening for this film, and there was a girl dressed in all-pink, and I thought to myself ""Why is she dressed like Glinda from Wicked?""... I later learned this was Xyriel Manabat.",-1
Sunshine,"Early in this coming-of-age sports drama from Antoinette Jadaone, we see Maris Racal as the titular character, twisting and turning her body gracefully like a professional who's been doing this routine all her life. Right there and then, I told myself silently that this is going to be the best and most unforgettable performance of her career. In the film, she plays Sunshine, a dedicated young gymnast preparing for her team’s upcoming tryouts for the Olympics. But days before their tryouts, she discovers that she is pregnant. Now she must embark on a desperate and risky journey to fight for her dream.Penned and directed by Antoinette Jadaone, this is definitely one of her strongest works and one that truly stands out amongst all the films in her sprawling filmography, thanks to its solid script paired with equally confident direction. Her works, which are reminiscent of the late Marilou Diaz-Abaya, albeit with a more modern flair, are always centered around fully fleshed-out female characters who, while at times flawed, go through a transformative journey (case in point: directing That Thing Called Tadhana, Beauty in a Bottle (2014), Never Not Love You (2018), Alone/Together (2019), and Fan Girl (2020)). And this latest one is no different. Here, we follow a young woman faced with the burden of her unplanned pregnancy in a country like the Philippines, where abortion is illegal under all circumstances and has no exceptions, even in cases of rape, incest, or when the woman's life is at risk.It's honestly a pretty daunting task to write a story like this given its themes, let alone actually make one and release it in a highly conservative, mostly Catholic country like the Philippines. Yet Jadaone successfully completed the film without sacrificing her vision. The film manages to bravely portray the burden brought by unwanted pregnancies to women while men get a free pass in this patriarchal society designed by and controlled by men. It also paints how religious people can't help but keep shoving their beliefs on others instead of minding their own business. Most importantly, the film discusses the importance of a proper health care system in a third-world country like ours, which is run by capitalism and corrupt government officials. Instead of providing safe and accessible procedures like safe abortion for women, we have a country forcing them to find unsafe means on their own, endangering their lives in the process.Performance-wise, the film is packed with numerous talents, so not a single shot in the film is put to waste. Both Meryll Soriano as Sunshine's coach, Eden, and Xyriel Manabat as her best friend, Thea, are effective. Elijah Canlas nails the gaslighting asshole of a boyfriend, Miggy, while Jennica Garcia is simply brilliant as Sunshine's sister, Geleen. Other noteworthy turns include Rhed Bustamante, Juan Miguel Garcia, Angeli Bayani, and Piolo Pascual in a cameo role as Miggy's father. A young Annika Co also shines with her role as the young girl constantly nagging Sunshine.But the film will definitely not work if not for the career-best portrayal from its lead, Maris Racal, who delivers a tour-de-force performance as Sunshine herself. One can really feel and see the dedication she had for such a demanding role, physically and emotionally. Her performance really pulls you into the film and won't let go until the emotionally charged third act, making it one of the best local female performances I've seen this year so far.The film also boasts some great visuals thanks to Pao Orendain's slick camerawork and incredible music courtesy of Rico Blanco—a first for the singer-songwriter.Overall, this latest film from Antoinette Jadaone is one rollercoaster of emotions that is buoyed by a daring and electrifying performance from Maris Racal. It's a poignant, gripping and thought-provoking journey of a woman coming to terms with her own inner conflicts. It's already halfway through the year, but this is already the best Filipino film of 2025 in my opinion.Trust me, you will not be prepared for how powerful this film is.",-1
Sunshine,"This is the best Filipino film I've seen so far. It follows a gymnast whose dreams are challenged by an unexpected pregnancy. Because the Philippines are incredibly Catholic, abortion is illegal and hard to execute. Will she give in to the pressure of keeping the child, will she seek medically unadvised procedures, or will she get help from others who understand her situation?The film explores the pressures that religion and misogyny place on young women - pressures that unfortunately appear to still be widespread in today's world.",13
Sunshine,Watched as a representative of UP Cinema. It's a brave take on one of the most controversial issues in Philippine society ever. Maris Racal is soooo good. Direk Tonet is on Fan Girl mode: things get quite tense and harrowing.,-1
Sunshine,"Claustrophobic, not just in how the frame is composed in several scenes, but in how it shows the extent in which the malignant structure of self-righteous patriarchal conservatism has done palpable harm to women and children everywhere. The film uses its central plotline to weave a rich tapestry of people and places that paint a picture of how this corrupted structure affects the titular protagonist, as well as the people around her. The tone possesses a gradually ratcheting anger at the oppressive status quo, going for the throats of its targets with at times bleak satire, or crushing nightmarish realities. This indignation, however, is ultimately fueled out of immense compassion. The film never really downs itself in hopelessness as it actively claws for hope, and never loses sight of Sunshine's agency through it all. Maris Racal's humane, scrappy performance is the total anchor of this film, carrying the heaviness with determination impressively.Although the breadth of the screenplay's scope is the film's biggest strength, there is some messiness in terms of scene-by-scene progression, and the more metaphorical/allegorical stuff doesn't fully coalesce with the film's more tangible arcs. Still, its willingness to take an approach both upfront and delicate to its central topic proves to be a burning, driving core towards a cathartic final endpoint. Meaningful, impassionate stuff.",-1
Sunshine,"I am averse to making comparisons to Brocka, but here we are. You see it in this film's Manila, a hysterically cruel city that somehow maintains its kindness in its edges. Here we are, at the claws of light, a sliver of sunshine cutting through the darkness. Sunshine makes a lot of bad decisions, but that's all she has. This is a nation of bad decisions, especially when it comes to the plight of young women. And she has to weave through these apathetic streets to find the kindness that exists in spite of the cruelty.The film uses a device that I found tenuous at points, though I do think it works out in the end. It's just that the film is so good at depicting the casual reality of these characters and the city that surrounds them that I found the break from it a little distracting. The film is transcendent when it just shows us what this city is: a place where a churchyard is where you go to find abortion drugs, a city where a motel is hesitant to give you a room if you're alone, a place where a person charged with caring for you might also take it as an opportunity to shame you for your choices.At the heart of this is Maris Racal, who delivers what might be the performance of a lifetime. A lot is asked of the young actress, who is made to mask the rage of generations of women and put on the facade of someone who is pretending that all this will pass without incident. It is sadness and worry, but also the prevailing need to show the world that everything is okay. She gets ample support from the rest of the cast, with Jennica Garcia in particular embodying the spirit of this film in its most crucial moments.There were several moments watching Sunshine where I find myself saying, ""yes."" Yes, because I was agreeing with what the movie was saying. Yes, because it was showing me a Manila that felt right. Yes, because Racal was really nailing something. Yes, because the music just swelled at just the right moment. There will be much talk about what the movie says, what it argues in the face of a society that often feels immovable. But here we are. Here it is. All I can say is yes.",-1
Sunshine,"“Mahirap maging babae, mas lalo na babae sa Pilipinas.”No matter how matriarchal, modern, or progressive we claim to be, women here are still shackled by outdated norms, patriarchal laws, and the belief that their bodies and their choices are not truly their own.Sunshine confronts these hard truths with unflinching honesty. The quiet desperation of having limited options. The shame bred by religious and societal expectations. The resilience women are forced to summon simply to survive.Maris Racal delivers a tour-de-force performance. I’ve loved her since Marupok AF, but here, she transcends. She carries the film with depth and vulnerability, her portrayal of Sunshine equal parts fragile and fierce.She’s matched beautifully by Jennica Garcia, whose turn as her older sister is quietly powerful. In her hands, sisterhood becomes a form of motherhood, a reminder that parenting can come from places we least expect.Sunshine hopes to be a catalyst for reproductive rights, choice, and change. And at its core, it’s a love letter to every Filipina who has ever had to fight for her rights and a light in the dark.Go see it.",7

Sunshine,"Cinemaster FJ Calvario says:In 2022, the government of Cuba had undertaken a bold move. It ratified a revision of its Family Code which redefined the “family”. It was no longer defined by only biological ties but also by relationships based on love and mutual support. This revised code is a radical piece of legislation, expanding the rights of women and children and recognizing same-sex marriages and adoption. It is a watershed moment for a country once colonized by Catholic Spain whose religious policies defined what was and wasn't allowed in society. In another corner of the world, the government of the Philippines continues to enforce the same religious norms set by Spain. Unlike Cuba, the Philippines has a long road ahead of itself in dismantling colonial legacy. A road perhaps may be paved by radical films such as Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine. A pioneer of the dialogue-driven hugot films of the 2010s, Jadaone is best known for her screenplays that blended comedy and romance. However, beginning with 2020’s haunting thriller Fan Girl which tackled male idolatry in the Duterte era, she seems to be on a sociopolitical streak in her directorial efforts. Her latest drama Sunshine now examines a woman’s decision to abort her pregnancy in a country where it is illegal and heavily stigmatized by the influential Catholic Church. At the heart of the film is the eponymous protagonist Sunshine (played by Maris Racal), a gymnast who dreams to compete for the Olympics. We first see Sunshine practice her routine in a stunningly directed scene showcasing well-paced editing and choreography. The pulsating electronic score by Rico Blanco is the cherry on top. He embodies his inner Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who coincidentally scored another sports film released the same year as this one. Her character’s Olympic ambitions remind me of the great women athletes in our country who have been making waves for their international achievements. I see in her the Olympic gold-winning weightlifter Hidlyn Diaz and the Wimbledon-competing tennis player Alexa Eala. But this dream of Olympic glory and national pride may not be realized if Sunshine decides to continue her pregnancy. We spend much of the film following her as she navigates through her personal relationships with her family and friends, her boyfriend, her gymnastics coach, and a mysterious girl who questions her decision to abort. It’s quite a cast really. Maris Racal makes the film as Sunshine; she plays her with steadfast determination. Bubbling behind Racal's eyes is great fear and tragedy. Xyriel Manabat does a lot with silent glances as Sunshine’s best friend Thea who begins to distance herself from her pregnant friend. Elijah Canlas epitomizes the upper class douchebag as Miggy the boyfriend, frequently speaking in straight English and hilariously offloading responsibility to his girlfriend. Annika Co as the mysterious nagging girl manages to be cute, annoying, and threatening in the same scene (although her character’s inclusion in the film is questionable and counter-intuitive, well intentioned as it is).Jadaone’s dense screenplay is riveting in its timeliness, empathy and boldness. The struggle of Sunshine in choosing between her career and an unwanted pregnancy recalls last year’s controversy around another athlete the Olympic gold winner Carlos Yulo who feuded with his mother over the latter’s misappropriation of his hard earned money. The discourse around the Yulo issue saw the clashing of cultures, the divide between conservatives (who viewed the athlete as an ungrateful son) and progressives (who championed Carlos’s autonomy). I expect the same discourse around Sunshine’s decision in choosing herself to unfold in Facebook comments sections once the film gets widely released in the country. It takes a cold heart not to be moved by Sunshine’s struggle for bodily autonomy. Jadaone situates her protagonist in the working class environs of Manila. It is a landscape defined by neglect and economic difficulties. Sunshine’s mother and father are nowhere to be seen, leaving only Sunshine and her siblings to fend for themselves. Sunshine meets a young girl who is also in need of money for her own abortion, having been raped by her own family member. Miggy refuses to share the burden of Sunshine’s pregnancy and keeps his distance. Beyond her words, Jadaone’s images (courtesy of cinematographer Pao Orendain) strikingly capture urban oppression. There is a great shot of Sunshine praying behind the grills of a church, visualizing the struggle between Catholic faith and personal freedom. There’s another great shot where a lone Sunshine is again framed behind a window of a motel beside a train line, highlighting how isolating her struggle can be. Who would want to give birth to a child into a world of constant struggle amidst economic hardship and social stigma? The screenplay brilliantly reimagines what a family and society could be. In the place of a mother and a father, Sunshine has two mother figures: her sister Geleen (played by Jennica Garcia) and her coach Eden (played by Meryll Soriano). Where other films would fixate on the familial tension between a parent and a child, this film is refreshingly optimistic in envisioning a family that supports and respects each other in their decisions, even with a decision as controversial as abortion. Sunshine’s supportive, orphaned family challenges the dominant Filipino imagination of the family (a father, a mother, and children). There is a wryly funny dialogue exchange in a Catholic hospital scene between Geleen and a conservative doctor where the former defends Sunshine by pointing out the doctor’s religious hypocrisy. Jadaone’s screenplay beautifully emphasizes the solidarity between women. Beyond interactions within her family, we see Sunshine helped by a kind doctor (played by Angeli Bayani) and, in turn, she helps a young pregnant girl (played by Rhed Bustamante). Even in an unjust male-dominated world, the film shows hope in the kindness among women. I have read reviews comparing this film to works of Lino Brocka and Marilou Diaz-Abaya. Perhaps, they are not far off. What Jadaone achieves in this film is the start of an honest conversation about women’s bodily autonomy in our society, much like what Brocka and Abaya have done in their social dramas during the Second Golden Age of Philippine Cinema. Time will tell how impactful Sunshine will be on legislation regarding abortion and other aspects of women’s rights. The Philippines, society and state, has a long way ahead to embrace progressive ideas, unlike for our fellow ex-Spanish colony Cuba. I suspect this film will trigger backlash among conservative audiences. God, imagine the online discourse and private message chains from concerned parents. But I do hope that close minded people would be moved by a film as empathetic as Sunshine.Watch Sunshine exclusively in SM Cinemas starting July 23",4
Sunshine,"Very backlogged review but hey, to have a star such as Maris (who is great in this film) lead in a controversial topic in this day and age is a breath of fresh air. Antoinette Jadaone steps out of her comfort zone yet again to bring out one of her bolder works. I am happy that something like this is out there, don't get me wrong, but there is something so off and odd about representing their struggles with hallucinatory unborn children. Feels almost counterproductive. In the talkback, direk says that she was inspired by Jojo Rabbit with this style of narrative and I wish she went deeper in explaining her reasoning. Edit: I strongly urge everyone to read my friend Mac’s review on this here. Perfectly captures the qualms with the film.Watched the premiere in SM Aura.Thanks for the opportunity UP Cinema!",25
Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is a powerful, intimate portrait of a young gymnast who discovers she’s pregnant just days before her Olympic tryouts. Rather than using the pregnancy as a dramatic twist, the film treats it as a deeply human moment—one that forces Sunshine to confront her identity, future, and agency as a young woman. Jadaone’s direction is sensitive and grounded, allowing the story to unfold with quiet urgency and emotional truth.The film bravely highlights the invisible struggles women face when ambition and reality collide. Through layered characters and subtle symbolism, Sunshine reveals how choices—especially for women—are rarely simple, often shaped by expectations and silent pressures.Maris Racal delivers a standout performance, capturing Sunshine’s vulnerability and strength with nuance. The final scene is restrained yet powerful, offering a deeply satisfying end. Sunshine is a brave, necessary film that speaks volumes about the difficult choices women must make in a world that rarely makes space for them.",17
Sunshine,Di ko pa napapanuod pero si maris na yan kaya 5 stars agad i love u forever maris racal,0
Sunshine,"What do you mean Sunshine walked from Quiapo Church to Siena College? I’d recognize that street corner anywhere. As in Fan Girl, the best thing about Jadaone’s filmmaking here is how she leverages unreality to create an immersive, tactile, and real subjective experience. The film is not just set in Manila, but Sunshine’s Manila, at times hypocritically prim and tragically seedy, both just different modes of alienation borne from the conservative milieu that devalues and abandons the marginalized among us, here particularly young women. It’s a potent text not because it presents clear answers—although its allegiance to its protagonist is never uncertain—but because it paints the sort of full and rich portrait of a woman’s life that the society it portrays cannot seem to imagine for the women in it. Very good.",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is a powerful, empathetic, and important film that bravely confronts a topic still considered taboo in the Philippines. As someone born and raised in the country, I found it both courageous and deeply resonant. It’s not just what the film is trying to say, but how it says it and, that stands out. They did it with care, nuance, and emotional clarity rarely seen in local cinema.Premiering internationally was also a smart and strategic move. It speaks to how difficult it still is to have open conversations around abortion back home. The truth is, stories that challenge long-held cultural or moral beliefs often need recognition from abroad before they’re embraced locally, a reflection of our lingering colonial mindset and deeply rooted conservatism.I truly hope Sunshine finds its audience in the Philippines. It deserves to, it needs to. Until we confront the systems that silence stories like these. Film this bold will remain the exception, not the norm. And for that alone, I commend Jadaone. We need films like Sunshine—not just to provoke, but to create space for real change.",12

Sunshine,introduced by antoinette jadaone and maris racalTHAT scene was brutal,25
Sunshine,"Gets na gets ko na. During the film's duration, I felt like I was drowning. I was drowning with Sunshine in the chaos of Manila's unsafe milieu. As she traverse the limited and unfair choices, the feeling of helplessness associated with the ticking time bomb inside her is tactile. I felt restrained from the very beginning until the penultimate scene because every obstacle she goes through, she can't show weakness; she has to show up with a brave face because of the programmed noise in her head; which was generated by the years of social norms put upon every woman's shoulder.One of the most profound and sensitive moments I found deeply moving was when Sunshine said, ""Hindi po ako buntis, coach"", yet her eyes was swelling with tears. She can't believe that this is the only truth she is forced to deal with, that everything she has worked for will end in a whim, and that the choice wasn't even deliberately made by her; mirroring the many women in the Philippines who undergo teenage pregnancy, who also don't have a safe choice for their bodies, and for their dreams. As I sit and bask in her story in the cinema, my tears kept falling even in the most simplistic emotions. Maybe that's what happens when you feel like you've already lost the battle even if you haven't started to face it it yet. Maybe that's how it feels to be in the losing end of the decisions made by the very society that should be protecting you. Maybe this is how it is to step in the shoes of every woman in the Philippines, and at the very least, it's only a feeling I can imagine.Honestly hought this film wouldn't make a willful statement. But it takes a stand, and at the core of it is Maris Racal; supported by a riveting ensemble just as honest as her. Direk Antoinette Jadaone weaved the story with compassion through the lens of real stories of real women. She made a deliberate choice to conceive this film, and this time, it was made by her.",-1

Sunshine,"It's been a decade since I saw a movie in theater, and Sunshine was well worth it. This is Jadaone's most important work to date. I hope this film sparks conversations about real issues we've dismissed as not worth discussing—simply because we believed we already had the answers.Update: One of my favorite movie of 2025",-1

Sunshine,"A major triumph for Philippine cinema. Antoinette Jadaone just gets it. You have those who preach God, yet fail in exhibiting compassion. You have those who can’t help but conform to societal norms.The movie understands how taboo abortion is in the Philippines, and I really liked how Manila, in its realest self, was portrayed. The sound mixing also elevates the film to greater heights.Maris Racal is a revelation. Jennica Garcia also stands out. I really liked how most of the women here were very compassionate to each other. When faced with men who can’t act like men, you can really only rely on women tbh. Jadaone gets it.The film portrays a very pressing matter with such careful handling, I am convinced it’s going to succeed in starting a conversation that must be had. Very, very important movie. Congratulations to everyone involved!",-1

Sunshine,"Made me quiet on the way home. No music, no earphones, no scrolling. Just listening to the sounds of a rainy EDSA in the afternoon.

Sunshine,"[partial spoiler]Sunshine effectively navigates a controversial choice that leaves the decision making to its audience. The film navigates both choices, but makes a realistic approach nonetheless.At the beating heart of the film is Maris Racal, who exudes the fragility and innocence of someone who struggles to balance big responsibilities. She is the guiding light of the film. This is indeed her second chance. Let us give her that.",-1
Sunshine,thank GOD it’s not a pro-life film! got scared for a second brrrrr! fuck them kids!,-1

Pareho kong naramdaman ang “pagmamalaki” at “hiya” bilang isang Pilipino. Mahusay ang pagganap ni Maris. Ang galing ng casting lalo na kay Jennica Garcia. Maraming na tackle na social issues pero nailahad sa simpleng istorya. Nanood akong nakasuporta lang sa lahat ng desisyon na gagawin ni Sunshine - “tama man o mali”",3

Sunshine,"a young gymnast, days away from national team tryouts, finds out she's pregnant - a truth that threatens everything she's trained for. in search of a way to undo it, she crosses paths with a strange girl who mirrors her fears, thoughts, and silence. what follows is a quiet unraveling of control, shame, and choice.maris racal is exceptional. every look, every movement feels lived-in. you can tell how much she trained - not just physically, but emotionally - to bring sunshine to life. it’s a performance that doesn't ask for attention but demands it anyway. jennica garcia also delivers a quiet but aching presence that stays with you.the film isn’t without its flaws. some parts felt rushed, others too drawn out. and the mysterious girl character, while symbolic, didn’t fully land. but still, this is jadaone’s boldest and most important film. raw, intimate, and unafraid to touch topics we’ve long kept in the dark.akala ko sapat na ang pagiging pro-women ko but this film reminded me how far we still have to go. i'll never fully know the weight women carry - lalo na sa bansa nating punong-puno ng limitasyon. and that’s the power of this film. it doesn’t lecture, it just quietly shows you the truth.mahirap maging babae. mas lalo sa pilipinas. and this film makes that heartbreakingly clear.",17
Sunshine,GANDA AMPOTA LEGALIZE SAFE ABORTIONS NOW PLEASE,4
Sunshine,"Philippines is still a conservative country and, honestly, I'm shocked that this got a wide release thanks to SM Cinemas. I don't know how hard it must've been to make this release work given how abortion is still illegal in this country and the stigma surrounding it. Such an empathetic film that's filled with so much heart despite how other people make it seem like an immoral decision. As Direk Tonet said in the Q and A screening I went to, as a writer, she sides with her characters whether people think the decisions that her character makes is right or wrong. In other words, she doesn't give a fuck what other people thinks about abortion. As for Maris, damn, what a performance. She's known to be more expressive and she admits as well that the hardest thing for her is leveling that down that she has to unlearn even the small nuances that she does. Such a vulnerable performance. Give her the recognition she deserves.We have been behind as a country when it comes to talking about reproductive health and women's rights but I hope given how widely this film is being seen right now that it sparks the necessary conversation not only in our society but also in our government that at the very least, decriminalize abortion.Side note: what a complete 180 when I saw this after watching Fantastic Four",13
Sunshine,It is corny when it's soap opera-ish.It is effective when it's simplistic.,1
Sunshine,"sunshine perfectly encapsulates every facet of what abortion looks like in the Philippines: how women resort to dangerous means because of its inaccessibility, the conservatives who set that system up, and the inutile men who exacerbate the plight of women. a lot of the scenes had me leaning over. the cast is incredible, and maris racal is at her peak!i was expecting the movie to fail at delivering a perfect ending but it didn’t! definitely direk tonet’s magnum opus.",-1
Sunshine,“sana naiintindihan mo na”“gets ko na”that last scene of maris and annika  ang hirap maging babae pero mas lalong mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas. this film is a must watch. itong film yung dapat gumagawa ng ingay sa madla eh lalo na in our country where women (especially the young ones) have limited choices. definitely a must watch! ang ganda and this is not me being biased just because I like direk tonet as a ka-eme. ang…,6

Sunshine,"Sa Pilipinas, ang mga tulad ni Sunshine ay pinipilit habulin ang liwanag kahit paulit-ulit silang nilulunod sa dilim.Alam naman nating lahat: illegal ang aborsyon sa bansang ito. Pero kailanman, hindi ito makakapigil sa aborsyon. Ang nagagawa lang nito ay itulak ang mga babae sa delikado, hindi ligtas, at hindi kontroladong paraan. At ipinakita sa atin ng pelikulang ito kung gaano ka-mapanganib iyon. Mula sa pagbebenta ng pamparegla sa mga black market hanggang sa mga hilot na hindi naman ginagawa ng propesyonal—lahat ‘yan ay repleksyon ng desperasyong hindi nila ginusto, kundi bunga ng sistemang patuloy silang pinapabayaan.Pero hindi lang aborsyon ang laman ng pelikulang ito. Binuksan nito ang mas malawak na usapin—bulok na healthcare system, paniniwalang relihiyoso na ginagamit panlaban sa kababaihan, incest, rape, teenage pregnancy, pressure bilang atleta, takot sa kahihiyan, at moralidad na tila laging nakasandal sa pananakit ng babae. Pinakita ng pelikula ang buong paligid ni Sunshine—pamilya, paaralan, simbahan, coach, kaibigan, doktor—at kung paano sila naging bahagi ng problema o ng solusyon.At sobrang tamang-tama lang na sa Maynila ito kinunan. Sa Morayta, Recto, at Quiapo—mga lugar na malapit sa University Belt, kung saan maraming estudyante ang nakakaranas ng hindi planadong pagbubuntis. Mga lugar rin ito na kilala sa underground na kalakaran—mula sa pekeng dokumento hanggang sa black market na pampalaglag. Realidad ito ng maraming kabataan, at pinili ng pelikula na hindi ito pagtakpan.Wala itong pa-plot twist. Walang engrandeng eksena. Pero ramdam mo ang bigat. At naipaabot niya ang mensahe nang malinaw sa masa, sa bawat Pilipinong kailangang mamulat. Hindi para mangumbinsi, kundi para magpasimula ng pag-uusap. Pag-uusap na maaaring maging tulay tungo sa legalisasyon—o kahit dekriminalisasyon—ng aborsyon sa bansa natin.Sobrang husay ni Maris Racal. Para siyang talagang gymnast. Lahat ng galaw may kahulugan. Lahat ng tahimik na sandali, may sigaw. Kudos sa choreographers—dahil bawat routine, may sariling kwento.Si Sunshine ay isa lang. Pero napakarami pang katulad niya. Iba-iba man ang dahilan, iisa ang dapat malinaw: ang desisyon ay dapat laging nasa babae. Sa katawan nila. Sa buhay nila.Hindi kailangan ng pelikula ng sagot. Pero may lakas ito para magtanong. At sa isang bansang takot harapin ang tanong, sapat na iyon para tawaging rebolusyonaryo.Sana ang Sunshine na ito, maging sinag ng panibagong simula. #LegalizeAbortion",3

Sunshine,"there is no confirmation in this film. characters didn’t speak too much. but their emotions were louder than the noise of the streets in Manila. seeing a girl with so much rage, full of power, and confidence, is something uncommon in this country. women are usually being told to do things and let others decide for their own sake. yet, we are evolving. women today can make their own decisions and dreams. they have freedom to pursue their desires. women are now independent.societal issues can be very serious and difficult to talk about today. but we must be as brave as sunshine. because sometimes, a problem being just a problem can cause your life. I can’t handle that one scene of a 13 year old girl. these stories are familiarly hilarious to watch but we don’t do a single shit about it. we call ourselves a religious country yet we forbid women to have a choice in those situations.not everything is a blessing. not everything we receive is from god. not everything we produce is made by love. we accept anything we think that is right. and that is how you make a choice.this is beautiful.

Sunshine,Very strong point of view. A film Filipinos can be proud of. Strong performances from the cast. Very very convincing and grounded. Just wow.,9
Sunshine,"wow .a gripping and gritty story about a harsh reality lived by women, told meticulously by direk tonet and matched by a career-high performance from maris. brought me to tears multiple times. i truly hope this opens up more meaningful conversations about abortion, women's rights and reproductive health, and the repressive legislations in our country. please go watch sunshine !!!!!",-1
Sunshine,Ito na ata ang isa sa pinaka importanteng pelikula na ipinalabas ngayong taon. Salamat direk tonet at sa lahat ng bumubuo ng Sunshine!!!!,-1
Sunshine,"POLIDO.SENSITIBO. PINAG-ISIPANGanito inihain ni Direk Tonet ang Sunshine. Isa itong tahimik pero matapang na pelikula na tumatalakay sa mga usaping matagal nang tinatabunan. Maris Racal's performance is raw, honest and deeply moving. Hindi siya umarte; naging siya ang karakter. Isa ito sa kanyang pinakamagagandang pagganap.Sunshine is not just a film. It is something we all need to talk about.""GETS KO NA!"" sana ma gets niyo rin.",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is Direk Tonet Jadaone’s softest scream yet. A quietly radical film that says: women shouldn’t have to bleed in silence to be forgiven.We need more films like this. More filmmakers like Direk Tonet who aren’t afraid to tell stories that actually matter. Stories that sit in the grey area. That show the truth without sugarcoating it.Maris Racal delivers a performance that’s tender, haunted, and furious beneath the surface. The film doesn’t beg for sympathy—it demands dignity.This isn’t about regret.It’s about agency.It’s about how in this country, your body is never really yours.And still—she tries to heal.",-1
Sunshine,PUTANG INA,1
Sunshine,i wasnt aware of your game elijah canlas,1
Sunshine,"Hindi ko gets kung bakit ang dami pa ring hindi nakaka-gets.Sunshine is a film about noise— ingay ng Maynila, ingay ng judgement ng iba, ingay ng kaguluhan, ingay ng mga maling desisyon. At sa gitna ng lahat ng ingay, ay isang babaeng may pangarap— tumatakbo, lumalaban.I have so many to say about the political nature of this film but I think at its core, Sunshine is about understanding. Hindi natin kailangan baguhin ang paniniwala natin, kailangan lang natin matutong umintindi sa kalagayan at sitwasyon ng iba.If you don’t believe in abortion, don’t get one. Same goes with the idea of divorce and same sex unions. Why limit the choices of others? The screenplay works so well along with its perfect casting. Lahat bagay na bagay sa role lalo na si Maris as Sunshine. I also love the cinematography lalo na sa Quiapo scenes. I felt the chaos through that. We know our country is fucked up when women can’t make choices for themselves. We know we’re fucked up when we’ don’t have safe and accessible abortions. We know we’re fucked up when we can’t pass laws like the divorce bill and the sogie bill. So what do we do after this? Hindi sapat ang isang pelikula upang baguhin ang sistema. Hindi dapat ganito— pero madami pa tayong kailangan paliwanagan upang maka-gets. Kailangan ng kolektibong aksyon upang i-push ang progressive bills into legislation. Malayo pa tayo.",3
Sunshine,"gets ko na.favorite scenes: nagbasag ng windshield, nagbasag ng bote sa ulosorry 'di na gumagana utak ko to review properly hahwhsha all i can say is more people should see this film",6
Sunshine,"MAKE ABORTION SAFE AND LEGALThis is easily a career highlight for both Direk Tonet and MarisNung una nainis ako kasi naguusap yung mga nasa paligid ko, pero nung narinig ko na ‘bakit ganon yung doktor’ at ‘nakakaawa naman to’ dun ko narealize na ito yung point nung movie—na pagusapan natin yung mga ganitong taboo topics sa Pinas. Kasama ko mga nasa senior citizen age na, pero naoopen sila sa ganitong side ng argument re: abortionAside from the obvious beautiful cinematography and script, the highlight for me was the score and sound editing. The silences were both solemn and intimidating, while the Challengers-esque score built the well needed tensionSo good!!!!",4
Sunshine,"You are Sunshine— Olympian.Gets ko na. Gets ko na.Ang pangarap ko ay yung pangarap niya.Sunshine hits close to home because of how raw, natural and necessary it is.It's the kind of film that is disturbing and would make you uncomfortable, in sense that it would make you do something— it should make you do something. It will leave you with a lot of questions, isa na doon ay kung kailan nga ba nagiging tama ang hindi dapat, at kailan ba hindi tama ang dapat? One thing’s for sure, it will leave you with a heavy heart— sapat para kuwestyunin ang sistema kung bakit hanggang ngayon, ipinagkakait pa rin ang reproductive rights sa mga kababaihan.Hindi man ikaw si sunshine, wala ka mang kaibigan o kakilalang sunshine, pero alam mo na totoong totoo siya and she exists somewhere out there.Isa siyang babaeng pilit hinaharap ang mapanghusgang lente at konserbatibong pananaw ng lipunan kung saan hindi nila nakikita ang paghubog sa kaniya ng isang sitwasyon na iniwan siyang walang ibang pagpipilian.At the end of the day, it’s really just empathy and compassion. Sana unawain ang mga kababaihang tulad ni sunshine. Sana mailaganap ang diskursong ito upang makalampag ang dapat makalampag.nakakagalit, dapat talaga karapatang pantao ang abortion. huwag sana itong ipagkait sa mga nangangailangan.mahigpit na akap sa lahat ng sunshine. gets ko kayo, gets na gets namin kayo.ps. Direk Antoinette Jadaone, i will always be your number one fan. Salamat sa tapang, dedikasyon, at pagbibigay boses. Salamat sa pelikula mo.pps. MARIS FREAKING RACAL + husay rin nung jennica, meryll, annika, ANGELI BAYANI, gelo, xy (what a cast!!)ppps. Pao Orendain and BenTol made the experience so much better + yung sound design????",-1
Sunshine,"Sarap maging si Sunshine.Dahil bida siya, hindi siya nakasuhan ng destruction of property or slight physical injury. Galing! Ngayon lang ako nakakita ng pelikulang walang matinong resolution o motivation ang lahat ng major characters.But in fairness, perfect ang casting. Kahit cameo markado, maging si Kitsi Pagaspas na nag-abot lang ng bata o si Angel Raymundo lang na iisa lang ang linya.As it stands now, parang mas magaling pang director na si Dan Villegas kesa ke Antoinette Jadaone. Hannah Espia should have awoken from her artistic slumber and directed this. Sayang eh. Klaro at matapang sana yung stand ng pelikula.",-1
Sunshine,hahahahaha tangina mo tito bobot,19
Sunshine,It's so liberating to see a Filipino film where women actually get to hold their narrative. I often found myself nodding throughout the screening—everything just felt correct.,26
Sunshine,"Maris, you are such a phenomenal actress!",10
Sunshine,"The best Filipino film I’ve seen so far this year.Raw, relevant, and worth talking about.Set in Manila: masikip, mainit, mabaho. The film captures it so well that you can almost smell and feel it. Beneath that heat and heaviness is a quiet story of sacrifice. It powerfully portrays the struggles of women in a deeply patriarchal society. Young women are expected to give way, to carry the weight, to make the harder choice. While men are often free to walk away, women are left at the crossroads, torn between duty and ambition, between what they want and what they are told they should become. Its honest portrayal of everyday hardship, mixed with strong feminist themes, feels like it is channeling both Lino Brocka and Marilou Diaz-Abaya.The film also reflects the quiet hypocrisy we see in everyday life. No one is truly exempt. People speak of values, yet live with contradictions. The film shows us these double standards in a way that makes you reflect.Maris Racal is so, so good as Sunshine. The rest of the cast is just as strong. Jennica Garcia, Meryll Soriano, Annika Co, Elijah Canlas, Rhed Bustamante and the rest of the casts are all remarkable. I also appreciate how even the crowd and background extras were credited at the end. It speaks volumes about how everyone involved was valued.And what a story it is. Raw, relevant, and worth talking about. Sunshine is not just the best Filipino film I have seen this year. It is one that dares to ask difficult questions and sit with uncomfortable truths. Brave and thought-provoking, it will likely spark conversation after the ending credits. Some of the choices in the film may feel morally difficult, and not everyone will agree with them. But the real question is, who are we to decide what is right for someone else? Are we even in their place to judge?More than anything, Sunshine reminds us to be kind. To live with empathy. To listen, to pause, and to try to understand before we judge.Just like these past few days, the rain has not stopped. For some, it is a blessing. For others, it feels like a never-ending trial. But in the middle of it all, we wait for the same thing: Sunshine.Sunshine that reminds us that after the storm, healing begins. And slowly, we rise. ",-1
Sunshine,the best contraceptive out there is an unexpected pregnancy film… gets kita ma,5
Sunshine,"“Drown out the noise. You’re Sunshine.”Napakatapang ng pelikulang ito. “Thought-provoking” might be an understatement. Eto ang buhay ng ibang Sunshines. What I like about this movie is wala siyang inimpose sa’yo na prinsipyo, na dapat ganito o ganyan ka, pero may binuksan siyang perspectibong hindi mo madalas kino-consider on a daily basis. Kailangan natin siyang magets kasi realidad ‘to ng ibang kababaihan na madalas ay pinipiling manahimik na lang pero isinabuhay ito ni Sunshine. She represented the quiet ones, the “no choice eh” ones, the helpless ones. Sa lahat ng mga “Nanay ni Mary Grace” o “Tito Bobot” sa mundo, may mga araw rin kayo!",6
Sunshine,"this proves how badly we need laws that protect our reproductive rights, tangina ang sakit sakit sa puso makita ang sitwasyon ng mga kababaihang kabataan who are neglected by the society while it continuously pampers incompetent men we need more movies this raw to get our point across for a safe and legal right to abort at nang ""gets ko na"" rin ang namumutawi sa bibig ng mga tao",-1
Sunshine,Simple pero grabe yung ganun,1
Sunshine,this film left me staring into nothingness!,-1
Sunshine,MASTERFUL!,1
Sunshine,"ChoicesSunshine makes mistakes and will make mistakes. People will question why she is pregnant at a very young age. And it was clearly hers and her boyfriend’s choice to be unprotected. And when she decided to tell him she was pregnant, both of them had to make choices. But when legal options run out for Sunshine and the only choice she can make is to abort through illegal means, she puts her own life at risk. But it is also in making a choice that Sunshine finds herself.God’s Gift Sunshine leaves a jeepney with the words God’s Gift. She walks towards Quiapo church and asks for forgiveness, and outside the church there is a market selling religious things, but also potions that “induce menstruation”. A medical professional preaches God at Sunshine’s bedside after her “medicine” fails her. And it says a lot about the structures surrounding young women with unwanted pregnancies. Later on in the film, we see the impact of these structures on them. They are forced to make decisions that risk their lives.Full of GraceMaris Racal is perfect at portraying Sunshine’s physicality and character. Her performance will make you believe she’s an Olympian who can take the spotlight and get everyone’s attention, a sister who learns how important it is to make her family proud, but most importantly, a dreamer who understands her young age is the right opportunity to change the world around her. I will never feel the exact same way as Sunshine experienced, but as a male audience, the film still allows me to put myself in Sunshine’s hard and difficult situation. The film is able to open eyes, and hopefully the audience willingly opens their eyes to Sunshine.",-1
Sunshine,I love how they portray the the two sides why abortion is needed in the ph,5
Sunshine,straightforward film pero shet ang ganda!,-1
Sunshine,WOMEN ARE SO FUCKING STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL PERIOD!!!!!,7
Sunshine,"""Naiintindihan mo ba 'ko?""Has the grit and guts of showing how women haven't had it easy when it comes to body agency in this patriarchal and faith-bound country. The part where the kid was used as a metaphor just seemed self-defeating to the movie for me. But as far as performances go, Maris sticks her landing here.",-1
Sunshine,"It’s so odd to see Jadaone out of her box—or perhaps returning to her old form. If Fan Girl leaned into the dark, Sunshine veers into the gritty. The clever use of environment makes Maris Racal’s performance feel grounded and central, without overly commenting on political allegories like in Jadaone’s previous work. Orendain’s shots don’t try to elevate the story—they move hand-in-hand with it, gripping tightly to the isolation of being a young woman in the Philippines.I haven’t seen any Filipino film tackle abortion quite like this. The nuance of setting it in a deeply religious country is compelling. It opens the conversation, but perhaps plays a little too safe—maybe to appeal to a broader audience. I was hoping for a stronger push, but it chooses to be understated: a film beaming with quiet urgency and an accurate reflection of the current climate surrounding women’s reproductive rights.",25

Sunshine,"This movie screams “your body, your rules!” Grabe ang empowerment sa kababaihan sa pelikulang ito na mahusay na binigyang-buhay ni Maris Racal. Mapag-iisip ang mga manonood sa mga pagpapasya ng pangunahing tauhan, susuportahan ba o hindi? Sasang-ayunan ba o hindi? Tagos ang emosyong ipinakita ng mga karakter. Ang husay ni Maris, ang husay ni Jennica, ang husay ni Annika. Lahat ay epektibo sa kani-kanilang mga ginampanan. May mga bahagi sa pelikula na napatulo ang luha ko dahil sa lalim ng pagbigkas ng mga dayalogo.Habang tumatakbo ang kwento, mapagtatanto nating this country deserves better healthcare system especially for women, dapat ay may reproductive freedom din sila dahil sa mga kalagayang kagaya ng kay Sunshine, kabataang kababaihan ang talo at napeperwisyo.",6
Sunshine,"There’s a lot to unpack in Sunshine, but let me begin by saying this: Maris Racal owns this character. There’s no other actress who could have pulled off Sunshine the way she did. She embodied every bit of the character so completely that Maris disappears—you’re not watching Maris as Sunshine; you’re watching Sunshine herself. Her performance is quietly powerful and emotionally charged, grounded in rawness and empathy.But this film isn't just carried by Maris alone. Alongside her are Annika Co, Jennica Garcia,and Rhed Bustamante, who play pivotal roles in deepening Sunshine’s story. In many ways, their characters are Sunshine—reflected through different lenses. Through themes of mental health and teen pregnancy, the film constructs a layered portrait of girlhood under pressure. It's raw, empathetic, bold, and unafraid. It doesn’t flinch from the truth, nor does it romanticize the pain.What Sunshine does best is handle a very sensitive subject in our country with sincerity and urgency: the ongoing struggle for bodily autonomy. It quietly and firmly illustrates the emotional toll of being a young woman in a society that refuses to let her decide for herself. And worse, how these conversations remain taboo.Every silence in the film is so loud. The pauses, the stillness, the unspoken—Sunshine knows that some of the loudest screams come from what isn’t said. The film allows space for emotion to breathe, for truths to sink in, and for viewers to truly feel the weight these girls carry.The producers behind Sunshine had to fight to get this film seen—not for profit, but because these are stories that matter. They pushed forward to open a much-needed conversation on bodily autonomy and reproductive rights. And it’s 2025—yet these issues are still being dismissed, invalidated, or worse, treated like they’re myths. In truth, they are not up for debate. They are basic rights that every woman deserves.I only hope that in the years to come, we won’t need another Sunshine just to get people to listen.Panoorin ang Sunshine, hindi lang dahil gusto n'yo, kundi dahil kailangan. Napapanahon, mahalaga, at dapat pag-usapan.Gets ko na.",25

Sunshine,"napakagaling na aktres ni maris!i was satisfied with the ending, especially with sunshine finding inner peace, standing her ground for her dreams, and being supported by geleen till the end. nakaka-sad yung arc nung 13 years old na nabuntis huhu very alarming cuz it rlly depicts how abortion is viewed sa pilipinas :((",-1
Sunshine,"We're in the Philippines, so I'm pretty sure that some people will raise an eyebrow. Is this film suitable for conservative ones? I think it can be, as long as you are not closed-minded. If you were to ask me my takeaway from this movie in one word, it would be... Understanding. This is something the audience needs. Sunshine needs it! I was honestly surprised at how easily Geleen was able to give it to her. I expected a 'typical…",12
Sunshine,"When I was in grade school, I wrote a feature editorial piece about abortion. I took the point-of-view of an unborn child narrating all his aspirations and would have been's in life had he had the chance to live, but I did not give voice to his mother, or at least I chose not to. 16 years later and here comes Sunshine.In the middle of this storming weather in the metro, Sunshine is haunting. It brings you to the darkest alleys of Manila where hope feels nowhere to be found, especially in a political climate where a woman is at a disadvantage, for the lack of a better term.Sunshine is disturbing in such a way that a woman, in this modern age, is still left with limited options, or the lack thereof, and has no autonomy in doing informed decisions on her own body amidst retribution of a patriarchal society.Sunshine is moving. It kicks. It punches. Five months after its Berlinale win, Sunshine comes home, and it needs traction. It is high time to make the conversation going until, for some divine intervention, it reaches the people that should be of utmost concerned about the plight of women.Sigh. Going back to the essay I wrote years ago, I guess I no longer need to rewrite nor revise that piece, kasi ngayon, mas gets ko na ang buong kwento.",-1

Sunshine,"2:30pm AWKP Screening @ SM North with Direk Tonet Jadaone & Maris Racal We live in a nation of choices & contradictions where women are the ones who are burdened with most of its unwanted consequences. Abortion? Illegal. Teenage pregnancy? Immoral. Contraceptives? Taboo. Elders look down on women who have pre-marital sex, unwanted pregnancy, and even an ounce of body autonomy.Beneath clouds of apathy & judgment, SUNSHINE reminds us to choose empathy & compassion.Nora Aunor was Bona. Hilda Koronel was Insiang. Today, Maris Racal is SUNSHINE.To bring up Lino Brocka is a heavy statement itself, but the Crystal Bear winning-SUNSHINE has also memorized Manila, and all its aches and decays. In her background are the familiar veins of Avenida & Quiapo. The heaviness of everyday life, religion and culture all add to her already buzzing headspace. She tries and must drown out the noise.With this award-worthy role, Maris might just have earned her place among the revered women in Philippine cinema who have embodied the honesty and rawness of the Filipina experience—in their respective era, each still under the same problematic patriarchal society.There's an all-timer hospital scene that stayed with me the most. As a medical student, what we're taught often align with Catholic teachings, even if our personal beliefs say otherwise. Our hope is that the next generation of health professionals will be provided with aligned legislation and protection that will help them become more compassionate, empathetic, and sensitive to women's autonomy over their bodies. These conversations should start not just in household discussions but in our social institutions as well.Elijah Canlas nails the recklessness of a young boy scared to man up. Xyriel Manabat's eyes speak for themselves. Jennica Garcia is simply luminous and embodies the 'Ate' in our lives. Her tough love exterior melts whenever Sunshine needs her genuine guidance. Meryll Soriano's presence is calming and reassuring. Piolo Pascual delivers friction and captures the high and mighty men in our society who assume to know all about everything and everyone, especially women’s needs. This is Direk Antoinette Jadaone's career-best work, yet. And at the heart of it all is Maris Racal, delivering a thrilling performance that will catapult her to superstardom.",4

Sunshine,"How can you drown out the noise when even the silence starts to echo your doubts?Direk @tonetjadaone’s pragmatic approach to storytelling moves the soul.Although far from being perfect, the film delivered where it mattered most - clarity in messaging and a vision compelling enough to leave emotional resonance to spectators.",-1
Sunshine,"This film on female reproductive health boldly centers the female gaze, offering a fresh and unflinching take on the realities that many Filipinas face. It attempts to break the glass ceiling of deeply rooted Filipino norms and challenges the culture shaped by religion, stigma, and silence around topics like abortion, sex education, and women’s health.Direk Tonet Jadaone masterfully captures the struggles of the protagonist, whose aspirations are put on hold after she discovers she’s pregnant. The film follows her journey, portraying how a woman navigates the weight of societal expectations in a culture that often leaves little room for personal agency.Cinematically, it’s far from your typical Filipino cliché. The pacing is tight, the cinematography is visually compelling, and each scene is deliberate, drawing the viewer into the emotional and social turmoil the character endures. The film allows us to witness how Sunshine finds resilience amidst adversity, all while shedding light on the layers of deprivation and injustice a Filipina can experience in a patriarchal society.More than just a narrative, the film leaves an impact. It sparks important conversations about our broken systems—the stigma surrounding reproductive health, the taboo nature of sex education, the inaccessibility of contraceptives, and the criminalization of abortion. It confronts how society often reduces women to objects of pleasure or vessels of reproduction, without regard for their mental or physical well-being.Ultimately, this is a film about empowerment. It’s a powerful reminder that women can dream for themselves, stand their ground, and rise above a system designed to keep them down. Thought-provoking and timely, it’s a testament to Direk Tonet Jadaone’s bold storytelling and her commitment to stories that matter.",-1

Sunshine,"since it’s a filipino film, i was honestly expecting it to go the usual filipino route with a reductive take: pregnancy, unsuccessful abortion, realization & regrets, then continuing the pregnancy despite it all because abortion is murder. but as the story went on, i was surprised it took a more progressive approach yet still left room for familiar cultural and religious themes without pushing a moral agenda. i honestly had a nice watching experience and liked how it handled the topic.",13

Sunshine,"This movie is arguably one of the best films of the year. It feels incredibly real because it reflects life in the Philippines, where women's rights are acknowledged but often support a male-dominated system and the patriarchy.""Sunshine"" tells the story of many women living in the Philippines. In this country, discussions about sex and sex education are frequently considered taboo. Many people talk about sex negatively, treating it as something sinful rather than educational. As a result, issues like teenage pregnancy are primarily viewed as public health problems. Furthermore, while there is a law aimed at protecting women from violence, it forces victims of sexual abuse to carry any resulting pregnancy to term, even in tragic circumstances such as r4p3.With abortion being illegal in the Philippines, many women find themselves in difficult situations. Those facing unplanned and unwanted pregnancies may have to consider unsafe options, which can threaten their lives.Women's rights must prioritize the well-being and choices of women, not men. The self-righteousness and views of certain religious groups should not dictate whether abortion is legalized. Women must have the power to make choices about their bodies.""Sunshine"" is a story of hope, second chances, and pursuing dreams. It hopes for a better society where women are not scrutinized for claiming rights over their bodies. This movie is a bold and significant step for film in the Philippines, as it represents the experiences of many women in the country. We must continue the conversation and let this film be a part of the movement advocating for better women's rights.Without a doubt, Maris Racal brought life to her character, Sunshine. Her outstanding performance solidifies her status as one of the best actresses of this generation.",13
Sunshine,"“gets ko na”the physical representation of sunshine making peace, letting go of her guilt, and getting complete reassurance in her decision, all in the form of the child she once detested, but in the end, loved, was honestly beautiful. there is so much love and strength with the child in understanding sunshine’s dreams and circumstances, and how society was truly set against them; two females who were young girls at the end of the day. in a way, it reminded me of the popular thought prompt, “if my mother didn’t have me, what kind of life would she have had?” it’s a bittersweet thought at first, but there is such genuine love and understanding in seeing your mother past her caregiving responsibilities and wanting to witness her thrive as an independent woman with goals and ambitions, even if it meant losing your existence. however, there is also so much love and strength with sunshine deciding what would be best for both her and for the child, even if it hurt. sunshine loved the child enough to recognize that she didn’t deserve to be brought into such a cruel world, not when her own mother was still navigating through it, barely managing to survive the horrors she was dealt with. she knew she wasn’t ready at all and she didn’t want her child to bear the brunt of it, given what she herself has went through. there is love and strength in choosing yourself, recognizing your weaknesses, and acknowledging that both you and your child deserve the best version of yourself; one that has wholeheartedly lived her dreams and life despite societal expectations and harsh realities and one that is ready to help her child to do just the same.despite all odds, naintindihan nila yung isa’t isa. and out of love, for both themselves and for each other, they both let go.",-1
Sunshine,"every time sunshine makes a decision, i just find myself nodding, quietly saying, “gets ko.” because i do. i was shaped by the streets of metro manila, grew up near churches where pampalaglag or pamparegla are sold right outside. i've had my own sunshines— close friends, a relative, a classmate — people i care about who’ve gone through the same thing. and watching this film, i saw myself in geleen, thea, the kid, and ariana. you just want your sunshine…",-1
Sunshine,FAVORITE ANTOINETEE JADAONE FILM SO FAR,8
Sunshine,"Pagkalabas ko ng sinehan, narinig ko na may bumulong na sekyu sa kasamang clerk, “Ano kaya ang kapupulutang aral niyan sa mga kabataan?” The moment I heard it, agad ko siyang tinignan ng masama for asking such a silly question…But then I realized—this is what Direk Antoinette Jadaone’s intention of making this film: to spark conversation and address the long-unspoken truths. From the lack of support for public hospitals to teenage pregnancy, our country has always been advocates for procreation, pro-union but consistently fails to address the root causes of these issues.Indeed, this film is not a fantasy movie that conservatives, like manong guard, might feel comfortable watching. Sunshine is a bold statement that transcends the drowning noise into a dissent against the systemic issues we have as a nation. Hats off to the powerful cast of this film, especially to Maris Racal’s promising performance. “Gets na kita.”",-1

Sunshine,"“Gets ko na.”And I hope this country does, too.Director Tonet Jadaone takes us into a journey of a short story about this uncomfortable yet important subject with Maris Racal’s on-point performance as the titular character Sunshine. From the direction, to the acting, to the perfect casting, the script, the cinematography, and even the sound design, this film near-perfectly incapsulates the struggle of someone who is given no choice but to succumb to secrecy in a world that wants to make choices for her.Such a heavy film, but it’s a film that is overdue. The conversations about this film and its subject matter is overdue. And with Sunshine, I hope we can finally get the conversation going. Overall, Sunshine delivers a subtle gut punch that leaves a lasting impression, especially of Racal’s performance.SM North Edsa Cinema",-1

Kinakabahan ako sa magiging takbo ng storya, knowing how abortion is usually tackled in Filipino cinema. Pero grabe ka DIREK TONET!!!!

Sunshine,"Sunshine is an aspiring Olympian. She is two weeks away from performing in the qualifying round. She has won numerous gold medals in local and Asian competitions, making her an ideal candidate for an Olympic gold. But everything changes when she discovers an unwanted pregnancy. In a male-dominated, conservative, church-leaning country, who can help Sunshine achieve her dreams?Jadaone's latest picture is a gritty coming-of-age sports drama that tackles a sensitive yet realistic portrayal of the struggles women face when the government and society turn their backs on them. It is a claustrophobic journey that dims the shine of its lead character even before she sees the end of the tunnel. The film offers a timely and relevant discussion on gender roles, sex education, the health care system, body autonomy, female rage, and empowerment.At its center is Maris Racal, who plays the titular character with grace, bareness, and nuance. She embodies the sunshine amidst a dirty, hypocritical, careless, and immovable society that becomes a character of its own. This is supported by the film’s striking eye for cinematic framing of the ragged city of Manila.I love how the film handles the core of its subject: should Sunshine get an abortion and continue chasing her dreams, or take the baby and live a life she is not prepared for? I love how the women characters come together to help each other against the oppressive weight of our patriarchal society.And when Sunshine finally makes a decision, I don’t think the film wants you to agree or disagree with her. It wants you to ask why she had to be in this position in the first place. It wants us to notice the shoulder-to-shoulder crowding in public maternity wards. It wants us to see the hypocrisy of a society where black markets for abortion operate in the shadows of churches, and why a woman still cannot make a decision about her own body without judgment from everyone around her.Pero gets kita, Sunshine.

Kitang kita kung paanong ang gintong bola ng pag-asa sa loob niya ay patuloy na kuminang sa kabila ng kadiliman ng Maynila. Sa kabila ng lipunang hindi handa sa isang babaeng may paninindigan at pangarap sa sarili niya. Gets ko na.Ito ay sulat para sa akin. Hindi dahil isa rin akong gymnast na gustong maging Olympian. Ito ay sulat para sa akin at sa munting “iha” na ang tanging kakampi lang sa kadiliman ng mundo ay ang tingkad ng pangarap niya. Gets na gets ko na. Gets na gets ko na kung bakit kahit hindi ako buntis, hindi ako gymnast, o kahit hindi ko pangarap maging olympian, ako si Sunshine. Dahil kahit anumang magyari, sigurado akong patuloy na mananaig at pipiliin kong yakapin ang pangarap at pagmamahal ng munting “iha” sa akin.",3
Sunshine,"Sunshine is a statement. Raw, delicate, and bold. It presents a social commentary on themes rarely explored yet deeply prevalent in the Philippine context. It dares to be radical. It dares to draw the line. When does the sun finally shine in a morally gray cloud of social disapproval?As linear and straightforward as the film appears, beneath it lies a complex character study — fearlessly told, thematically sharp, and emotionally unsettling. Antoinette Jadaone writes for women, and in a cinematic landscape like ours, we need more voices like hers. I was initially worried about where the story would go, but it was brave enough to take the harder path.This is Maris Racal's best performance yet — nuanced and quietly powerful. But it was Jennica Garcia who stole every scene she was in. She was the emotional anchor, the tearjerker. Some casting choices outside the leads, however, fell short. Certain scenes and narrative decisions could have landed harder with stronger performances or more fitting direction.That said, the editing needs work. The presence of a stunt double in certain scenes is obvious, breaking immersion. While the film’s visuals hauntingly capture a side of Manila we rarely see on screen, the sound design lacks polish. These flaws are noticeable but not deal-breaking.Still, this film succeeds in doing what few others do: it makes you ask what is ethical and what is not. It invites reflection. And when a film draws that line clearly for society to see, perhaps that’s when the sun truly begins to shine.",-1

Sunshine,"Sa bawat eksena ng pelikula ni Antoinette Jadaone, iisa ang tinig na umaalingawngaw — tinig ng babae. Hindi lang basta karakter ang mga babae, gaya ni Coach Eden mapa hanggang kay Doc Helena; sila’y haligi, saksi, at sandigan. Maging ang mga ina sa maternal ward, tahimik man o may tinig, ay larawan ng kababaihang nagtutulungan, nagkakapit-bisig sa gitna ng unos.Sa mundong kinahon ng patriyarka, binubuksan ng pelikula ang mata natin sa lakas ng kababaihan — lakas na hindi lang para sa tahanan o pamayanan, kundi para sa paghubog ng mas makatarungan at pantay na lipunan. Sa mata ng kamera, dama ang panawagan: bigyang saysay ang katawan at karapatan ng kababaihan.Dahil sa mundong nararapat, walang Sunshine, walang Menggay, ang kailangang manahimik sa sakit. Walang babaeng kailangang dumaan sa dilim ng unsafe practices para lamang maramdaman ang kontrol sa sariling buhay.

Sunshine,"Obviously im not a woman so I will never fully understand the lived experience of a woman but just like sunshine, I am someone who made regrettable decisions in the past. Someone who’s also eager to make it right. At least for me. But sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing when you have so many people telling you what to do, or when you don’t have the resources to do so. It’s hard to drown out the noise in your head when everything around you is so loud. Sometimes you don’t even need someone to tell you what to do at all, because you already know. Sometimes all you need is someone to be by your side. Something to make you feel like youre not alone. A text message from a friend. A hug from a sister. A pair of compassionate eyes of a stranger. Despite feeling alone in her whole ordeal, Sunshine was held together by the women she encounters. From the child, her sister, the cashier at the motel, the doctor at the hospital.I was lucky enough to have my own community lift me up at a time when I thought i was done for. It’s because of them that I’m still here, and that I still keep going. “Mahalin mo si sunshine, kahit ano pa siya, kahit ano pang nagawa niya”, said my friend. Indeed, we are all just people in need of community to get us through. In need of compassion. In need of empathy. Someone to say “kakampi mo ko dito”. Sometimes having someone sit through it with you is enough. And yes, gets kita, Sunshine.",7
Sunshine,"The film has a sense of urgency about it, presenting the drama with so much eagerness, firm convictions, and intense sentiments nearly to the point where it devolves into cheap propaganda for a cause with which I happen to agree ideologically. It was too on the nose and constantly going for shock value that it was draining to follow, brazenly provoking the audience to feel for a horrible social reality but instead of pointing it out with a nod and a commentary, it was trying so hard to make them feel bad about those situations. Not in a good way because it is one of those things that breeds frustration rather than empathy for the protagonist. At some point, Sunshine simply disappeared, becoming a vessel for the audience to put their shoes on since she is subjected to so much oppression, losing any semblance of agency as it is all about how messed up her social reality has become. It's the same problem I had with war films and other poverty porn, where it ignores developing the protagonist in favor of escalating the situations in front of her and throwing every miserable conflicts imaginable at her. To be fair, the protagonist as a vessel had an aspiration, a threatened dream that was about to be broken, and the idea of her interacting with all these women, smoothly transitioning from the one who needed help to the one who provided help, clearly distinguished the film from those with a typical point-of-view character. Those moments of empowerment and camaraderie with other women may have eased the tension and made it feel more hopeful than the premise implies, but it also falls into the trap of caricaturing other characters for the sake of cheap sensationalism. It also felt betraying that so many things transpired that the gymnastics was set aside for so long, and I would hope that it was more of an escape than a hardship because no joy was displayed during those routines except for the last act. I would say that the sport was not seamlessly wedded to the character, since it could have been any sport or dream, and the film would still be effective. The magical realism element is essentially what I detest about the film, because it could have lingered in the loneliness and allowed the audience to connect with the character through subtlety, but it had to be filled with hypothetical conversation that hits the audience on the head to explain the themes and demonstrate the unspoken dilemmas in the present predicament. It could be interpreted as a mean to communicate guilt, a process of forgiving oneself and empathizing with other women, or as humanizing the fetus inside the body, which I'm not sure how to feel about that ideologically. It's also tonally odd, which is a Philippine cinema branding at this point, but it's always convenient to use a child for humor, and it reduces the overall tone of what's happening to the main character. It was just too telegraphed at times, and I was hoping to let the sequences play out and use more silence because those are the scenes I enjoy when the protagonist is alone and burdened by her situation. The upward momentum of a film that begins bleakly will always impede any form of storytelling because it must outdo itself, building emotions that are overwhelming every ten minutes to the point of monotony. In fact, I can't recall the chronology of the film even though I saw it yesterday, but I do remember every segments and the emotions it was going for. It actually came to the point of absurdity in the third act, when one character emerged, followed by a terrible circumstances, followed by even more bleak information and an unsettling confrontation, which would undoubtedly disturb anyone. And then there was a cameo in which the small theater collectively whisper and giggle a bit as a result of being taken off guard, which again felt awkward because it always has to make a joke after every other miserably effective scene. Not letting the moments breathe for a while. It can even be tonally confusing at times, with scenes that is either attempting to be comical or unsettling as some of the dialogue was just satirical and they incorporate some triggering monologue ala Vincentiments, but they also made the film lighthearted, which I am not sure is a good thing. I suppose I want my abortion movies to be more thought-provoking and full of sociological nuances rather than funny and emotional, because it can be too loose for its sensitive subject matter, but it was heartfelt and that was good. I'm making it seem like I hate this film when than I don't because it was terrific and entertaining, but it's just that I'm not sure if those are the things I want to take away from this film. I have to say though that it had a very good filmmaking mechanics. I heard they tried to hide the camera in public scenes to make the setting appear more authentic, and I was expecting long takes because it was another Filipino film about a protagonist wandering around which they did not employ at all, but I kind of like what they did here, from the shot composition and coverages to the way they were edited together. The only criticism I had regarding the filmmaking was the noticeable stunt double in the gymnastic routines, as well as how the emotions in the close-ups did not match those in the wide shots whenever they intercut them together. I suspect no one grins when doing gymnastics since it is a serious performance by meticulous athletes rather than by an exuberant victorious person, as the film claims at the conclusion. It's just a little quibble, but I commend the filmmaking overall and even the rough cuts were fantastic. Definitely the best-directed Filipino film I've seen in quite some time, I can say that with confidence.",23

From wide shots symbolizing that her mind is still free, to tight composure, symbolizing that her world is closing in.Yes, abortion is not ideal, and the film shows Sunshine's struggle to decide what to do with the pregnancy.

Sunshine,"this film is close to my heart…i really believe that women should be given a choice when it comes to their body and reproductive health. bringing life into this world should also not be disguised as a “blessing”, especially when the means to raise the child is little to none. maawa kayo sa mga batang walang makain, walang matinong tirahan, hindi makapag-aral, at hindi masulit ang pagiging bata. ang pagiging magulang ay hindi natatapos sa pagluwal sa bata at hindi dapat iasa sa iba ang responsibilidad mo bilang magulang.tangina rin ng mga mapang-abusong lalaki sa loob at labas ng bahay. pati na rin ang gobyernong patuloy na pinipigilan ang pagkakaroon ng access to better healthcare, hindi lang para sa mga babae, ngunit para rin sa lahat ng pilipinong may kailangan nito.maraming salamat direk tonet para sa pelikulang ito. maraming salamat sa napakahusay na pagganap nina maris, jennica, rhed, at xyriel. nawa’y mas marami pang pelikula gaya nito ang maibahagi sa masa at nawa’y maraming makapanood nito.",-1

Sunshine,"“Start strong, stay strong. You can do this.” But what happens when life throws you off balance? Sunshine is a powerful, no-frills story set in the gritty, chaotic streets of Manila. It follows a young gymnast whose future gets shaken when she finds out she’s pregnant. Antoinette Jadaone tells this story the way she does best—letting silence, glances, and small gestures speak louder than words. No drama for drama’s sake. Just raw, real moments. Maris Racal delivers a stunning performance.…",-1
Sunshine,"This film tackles numerous points that need to be discussed. It provides a comprehensive overview of the different systemic issues that our country is not addressing, ranging from the double standards imposed on women to the societal barriers that make it difficult for women to meet these standards. It is an irony between what society wants for women and how society sets up women to fail to meet these standards.That's where the ""bullsht-ery"" comes in, as this film successfully sends it to its audience. I want to say a lot of things about this film, on how it provides a good argument, on how it provides a good piece of reality that is not glorified nor romanticized and on how it gave us something that will not just be left on the cinema, but to be talked about in the streets and on the media.I really understand the fear of the production of showing this in the Philippines, but I believe that strong and brave films like this are what we need, to not just start conversations but to challenge the views we have as individuals and as a collective. This is the kind of film that everyone needs to watch, as it will definitely afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted. No words, but pure awe of everything about this film. Definitely the best work of both director Antoinette Jadaone and actress Maris Racal. And it's weird for me to have a good rewatch feeling on these kinds of movies, but I believe I will be rewatching this film again (once the storm settles and subsides).Mabuhay ang pelikulang Pilipino!",-1

Sunshine,"Sa wakas, may nakadiskubre at nakagawa na rin kung paano gamitin nang maayos si Racal. Sa labas ng maliliit (at ilang malalaking mga) na mga butas sa detalye, at naratibong pagpili na hindi ko masakyan, maayos ang pelikulang 'to. Matino ang mga pangalawang aktor, may tamang balanse ng kritikang panlipunan—ng mga gagong biktima ng sistema (at sadyang gago lang) at mga gustong maging mabuti sa gitna nito—at may gustong sabihin, ipaunawa. Nakakapag-isip ka, nakakapili. Ito si Jadaone kapag nasa labas ng dikta ng studio, kapag malaya—tulad noong bago pa siya gumawa (o kapag hindi gumagawa) ng mga nakakautang romcom na ginawa nang hubugan ng mga sumunod sa kaniya.",3
Sunshine,"I have no words, but this film really moved me. Nakakagalit. Matapang ang pelikula not because of the topic, naging matapang ang pelikula nang dahil sa kung paano ito kinuwento.

Ang tanging gusto ay makapunta sa langit at hindi maging sandalan ng kapwa niyang umiiyak sa hinagpis.Nakokontrol na nga ba tayo ng relihiyon at kultura kung saan ang mga lalaki ang palaging namumuno? Katulad ng conclave na puro lalaki ang bumoboto, nagtatalaga ng pinakamakapangyarihang lider ng simbahan.

Kaya siguro, hanggang ngayon, narito pa rin tayo. Bansang walang pinagbago.Sex. Reproductive Health. Abortion. Teenage/Child Pregnancy. Mental Health. Iilan lang yan sa taboo topics na ayaw pag-usapan ng gobyerno at simbahan. Laging sinasabi na sumunod na lang sa “kung ano ang batas ng Diyos.” Pero hanggang kailan natin patatahimikin ang mga kwento ng kababaihan, kabataan, at mga taong naghihirap sa katahimikan? Hanggang kailan ikukubli ang realidad sa likod ng doktrina?Na may mga taong humihingi ng tulong: hindi ng dasal lang, kundi ng konkretong solusyon.Ang pananahimik ay hindi kabanalan.Ang pagtugon sa tunay na pangangailangan : iyan ang may malasakit.Panahon na para pag-usapan ang mga ayaw nilang pag-usapan.",3

Sunshine,"Powerful. Authentic. Bold.Ang ganda ng film. Ang gustong ipakita ng pelikula? Ang realidad ng mga kabataang babae na hindi madalas marinig. Ang galing ni Maris. Kahit na wala siyang binabanggit na mga linya, damang dama ko yung emotion. Ramdam ko yung sakit, guilty and takot ni Shine. Yung simpleng pagtitig, paghinga, and pagbitaw ng mga linya niya ay napakasolid. Hindi pang-arte lang. Totoo. Ito na yung pinakamahusay na role ni Maris. Yung kwento, well narrated. Kakaiba siya and kailangan talaga siyang pagusapan. Ineexpose ng film na ito yung real life issues tulad ng abortion, teenage pregnancy, and stigma. Hindi pinilit ang morality, pinakita ang reality and hinayan ako na makapagdecide kung anong mafefeel ko. Ang ganda ganda ng cinematography. Super totoong totoo bawat eksena. Yung color grading, grabe ang galing. Bawat kulay saktong sakto sa bawat eksena.Super galing ni Jennica. Bilang ate hindi niya pinagalitan si Shine. Kinampihan niya kasi alam niya yung nararamdaman ng kapatid niya. Ang galing din ni Elijah. Kuha niya gigil ko. Aside from Maris, ang galing ni Annika and yung isa pang bata. Speechless lang sa performance ni Annika. Si Annika ang manifestation ng konsensiya, guilt and innocence. Nasasabi niya ang lahat ng ayaw aminin ni Sunshine sa sarili niya.Grabe yung eksena sa motel. Ang powerful. Pero grabe ang ending. Walang dramatic confrontation, walang resolution, at walang solusyon sa mga problema ni Sunshine.

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone has always been one of the few Filipino filmmakers I deeply admire, not just for her craft, but for the way she tells women’s stories with empathy and nuance. Her work has always felt personal, films like Alone/Together, Fan Girl and now Sunshine, might just be my favorite Filipino film released this year so far.I remember seeing the trailer last year and wondering if it would even get a proper release here. It tackles such a taboo topic, one that many in this country still refuse to even speak about. That’s why I admire Jadaone so much. She’s chosen to talk about what others won’t. In a predominantly Catholic nation where abortion is criminalized, even in cases of rape or incest, Sunshine feels like an act of courage.I’ve always been pro-choice. I grew up surrounded by the whole “abortion is murder” narrative, from relatives, from my old Catholic school run by nuns. But even as a kid, it never sat right with me. I never saw it as a sin. And now that I’m studying to become a doctor, that belief matters even more to me, because women deserve healthcare that doesn’t judge or shame them. Sunshine affected me on a personal level because of that. It reminded me why I want to do this.It’s not a perfect film. Some might find the pacing fast or feel like it didn’t say enough. But to me, the point isn’t perfection. What matters is that it exists. It dares. It’s a film that opens doors, uncomfortable ones, sure, but necessary. I really hope it’s not the last of its kind.",-1
Sunshine,Gets ko na.,21
Sunshine,"Maris plays Sunshine with so much empathy that it permeates outside the screen, her win is our win, her disappointment is our disappointment. Through the streets of Manila to the corners of her room, we get to hold hands with her and be a confidant. I like how it positions the audience as part of this journey, not as the usual bystander. One sequence that stood out is the one from the inn to the hospital - Maris lets herself be consumed by Sunshine, almost as if the creeping is part of the routine itself. The messaging gets confusing in the middle but ultimately ends in a tender moment of acceptance and determination. I’m just happy films like this finally exist in our country.",25

Sunshine,shuta ang galing ni Maris,-1
Sunshine,"I knew Sunshine was a good film even before watching it because Antoinette Jadaone has consistently delivered satisfying work throughout her career. I had the chance to watch it in a cinema in Cebu, surrounded by fellow film enthusiasts, including Maris Racal and Antoinette Jadaone in the audience. I teared up multiple times.This is a woman’s story, one that powerfully captures her control over her body and her choices. The film's use of magical realism elevated the narrative, turning what could have been dull internal monologues into vibrant, engaging character portrayals by the actors.It’s no surprise the film has already received international recognition. It absolutely deserves it, and even more.",-1
Sunshine,"Hindi ako nahihiya. Ayokong maging nanay Needless to say dahil expected na, pero ang galing ni Maris at Jennica. That leaning-on-shoulder scene nila sa taxi ang fave kong ganung moment in Asian cinema.Natuwa ako na nandito si Angeli Bayani, bilang isang compassionate na doctor.",35

Sunshine,"for as many times as we sit and talk about unwanted pregnancies and abortion, there is a woman out there na katulad ni sunshine na dala-dala ang bigat ng desisyong siya lang ang pwedeng gumawa. conversations regarding this matter often talk about the cause and consequences, but never once did we talk about the process women have to endure— the grief, the confusion, the isolation. it was never just in black and white. hindi lang siya basta nabuntis at mas lalong hindi lang siya basta nagdesisyon. this film showed everything in between. it was an honest attempt to potray the realities women go through, a reminder that we are free to dream and we are free to live life the way we choose to.",-1
Sunshine,"In a Q&A with writer-director Antoinette Jadaone that I was lucky to attend, she was asked how she braced for the potential backlash of this film from Filipino audiences given our mostly conservative background. Her answer resonated with me deeply: As a writer, Jadaone believes her primary duty is to stay loyal to her characters. If her character's arc demands visiting unnerving and controversial depths, she is not afraid to take the plunge - regardless of how viewers might perceive it. Her earlier work, Fan Girl (2020), already painted a similar picture, albeit a bit spottily.Jadaone takes her boldest steps yet in her latest work, Sunshine (2024), by tackling abortion, a highly contentious subject in the country, with both sensitivity and grit. This entry is unflinching in its commentary, taking us to the most harrowing places women can be in a nation where sexual abuse is prevalent, abortion is illegal, and healthcare fails the underprivileged . Sunshine, our protagonist, is a skilled gymnast, but even she can't leap over patriarchy, tumble past outdated laws, or cartwheel her way out of the conservative society and system. In one scene, Sunshine waits along a street choked with tricycles, behind the railing of a pharmacy counter - she is jailed in and by this wretched city, made a criminal for wanting to make a choice that should be her right. But this film's Manila is more than just Sunshine's prison. It's a breathing character, trailing her around from scene to scene. Always in the backdrop but never invisible. Never speaking but always loud. A passing MRT train rattles the windows of a shabby motel. A crammed jeepney bounces to the bass of a local rap song. Grimy streets teem with hustling vendors and weary residents. Sunshine makes her choices, but her choices are only as good as this bleak, brutal city allows . Maris Racal delivers a phenomenal performance, portraying our protagonist with nuance and raw intensity. She is backed by a stellar ensemble - Jennica Garcia, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, and Elijah Canlas - each breathing life into characters that are authentic and vital to the film's message. The sequences are daring, the story beats sometimes violent, but always necessary. The music elevates it all, with a standout Challengers-esque score underscoring the gymnastic scenes. This film is not without its faults though, with excessive cursing (seriously, again in a Project 8 work?), somewhat awkward acting, and some unpolished plot points, but these are forgivable given how effective the complete work is.Sunshine may very well be Direk Tonet's finest work yet - and rightly so. It stands as one of the most important Filipino films in the modern times.",-1
Sunshine,"first time watching a screening at a cinema with the star herself (ANG GANDA MO SA PERSONAL MARIS WTF)! such a great film with brilliant creative choices all throughout. so emotional and so so real. only a female director could masterfully tell this story!edit: after the second watch, i realized how empowering and important it was to portray this story using sports as a metaphor to her bodily autonomy. everybody loves her when she uses her body to look beautiful for the world, but when mishap occurs, she is shamed for it. yet, in the end, i noticed that the last thing she declares about her pregnancy is a statement that is so bold and firm: “Ayoko maging nanay.” right in front of the men who tried to control her decisions. which maybe leaves the audience to think: “what happened after that?” but the point is that her decision, her body, and her passion, are all unshakably hers until the end. and we see that because after that scene with miggy and his dad, she practices her routine again. and then it was so perfect-had tears in my eyes the whole time. in that gymnasium, Sunshine “drowns out the noise.” what remains is her unwavering bond with her body, both as a woman and as a gymnast.",36
Sunshine,Let women do what they want to do with their bodies!,7
Sunshine,"i was deeply moved and inspired by sunshine. what a gem of philippine cinema. you know a film is good when it makes you want to create again. however, while undeniable in its prowess and relevance, its potency and impact dwindles in its struggle to pinpoint with conviction who its target audience is. it seems to want to pander to both liberal and conservative audiences, but this muddles its message. who is this film really for? who is it in dialogue with? i thought that the choice to portray the unborn fetus as a grown, conscious being was counterintuitive at first, but then i realized the film was only trying to meet its conservative audiences halfway in their beliefs. then i thought it was a stroke of genius: of course, the only way to convince someone to change their mind is by explaining it in the terms they understand, through their perspective of the world. but then it also alienates this very audience by demonizing them in the film. while it successfully empathizes with the horrors of being a woman in the philippines, there is a lack of nuance, a dichotomy of good vs. evil, that might be more harmful than helpful in the grander scheme of things.(there are also so many scenes where maris racal’s quiet yet powerful performance should have been enough, but the beauty of the moment is ruined by the “child” voicing out sunshine’s thoughts, spoon-feeding the audience.)only particularly critical because i think sunshine is an exciting step in the right direction for ph cinema. i loved it and i think everyone should still watch it in spite of its flaws.",12
Sunshine,"As someone who is always online, I often encounter issues that are difficult to discuss, to the point where I sometimes become desensitized and think, 'ahh shit, eh ganyan talaga that's life.' I knew that the main topic of this movie is abortion, and after watching the movie as a woman and a Filipino, I was reminded na hindi kasi abortion 'lang', there are so many layers to it, may it be sexual education, healthcare, and the patriarchal society we…",-1
Sunshine,"The tone set by Sunshine over Jadaone's previous film, Fangirl, is way different. The urgency of survival is apparent and how it clashes with the film's thematic journey, like Paul Soriano's Thelma. Though Sunshine tends to get the feel of guerrilla direction, it is a combination of the director's experiences in mainstream and her indie roots. Meaning, we get to see well-lighted scenes and less usage of shake cam.Sunshine unpacks a lot of society's ills and inequalities. Patriarchy, discrimination in the medical field, inhumane laws, and glaring social class issues that don't benefit those without that much. In a country where religion reigns, or so they say, the film easily relays problems with well-made sequences and heartbreaking results. Jadaone knows the voices of her characters, and it tells a distinct topic with passion and wit, giving the audiences a rollercoaster of emotions.One thing that makes this film unique is the inclusion of a fantastic element. It somehow references, or a styling of, what they had in Death Note anime or Big Mouth to make it more accurate. And such symbolism as Sunshine's conscience made it relatively easier to tell the film's narrative. It was smartly added, and it didn't make the audience unintelligent.The technical are overwhelmingly great. The use of lighting in urban areas, especially those scenes shot at night, is worthy of a picturesque view of the marginalized reality. We rarely see such strong shots in film. The options to use close-ups for intensity of emotions and certain decisions to make the scenes with Mariz Racal's gymnastic performance were made with careful efficiency. And the sound editing was just on point. It is technically the protagonist's in-ear audio being shared with the viewers.Jadaone's casting is really one for the books. An appreciation to Mariz Racal's graceful bookend performance. The representation is exactly what we need to see from young adults, especially in the situation of what is happening to her character. The conflict-bearers really made the sequences memorable, and it made you think of the situations presented. These aren't farfetched ideas shown in the film. Most of them are realistically sound and Piolo Pascual's short stint really is just something for us to gasp about. And we also get to see Jennica Garcia and Elijah Canlas' supporting roles to complete the ensemble.Les we forget Annika Co's strong personality. I guess we have another star made by the director. And regarding Meryll Soriano being part of the film. It made me remember how she did a similar role back in 2010, as Lizette in the Mark Meily film, Donor.Sunshine displays what needs to be said in a society when abortion is considered a taboo topic. A possible eye-opener to the current status quo. .:smcityeastortigas>>",17

Sunshine,"Sunshine Francisco played by Maris Racal, is a teenage gymnast dreaming of getting in the Olympics, got pregnant by accident, and must face the moral dilemma of choosing between her dreams and keeping the baby.Maris Racal carried the film to pitch perfection and rawness. She takes you in and makes you feel her struggles. Her facial nuances and physical vigor makes her the right choice to play the titular role, in what could be a role of a lifetime. Director Antoinette Jadaone's never been more sure and absolute of her vision here. The film stands as an audacious statement in a country full of naysayers when it comes to the sensitive and controversial subject matter: abortion. The ending really made me shed a tear, in response to understanding why women do what they do. Though the film is not without its flaws. I sometimes felt the script and characters could have been more seamlessly sewn, and not just coming out of nowhere, making it feel a bit unnatural. Nevertheless, this is an essential film that needs to be seen by a wide audience. It didn't provide the answers, but this is what a filmmaker does best: to start conversations, to challenge the status quo and make us reflect our own beliefs and morals.ps. support local films, local music, local products, and local boys. eme",-1

Sunshine,"This was honestly just a sad movie. Even though you should be at least happy for Racal's character at the end. She went through hell and back just for the sake of her dream. It was a poignant (POIGNANT?!) commentary on a person's instinct to pursue one's dream and how it can lead to decisions and sacrifices to avoid compromise or delay. The other commentary is definitely about teen pregnancy/sex education/family planning in the Philippines. Despite having dramatized scenes, the burden that tolls on the characters is easily felt. Direk Tonet's writing, cinematography, directing, and overall vision really had a strong impact with this movie. Grabe talaga, its one of those films na babalikan mo in the future.

Sunshine,"I was really hoping this movie wouldn't end in a tragedy the way so much media in the Philippines has portrayed abortion in the past. I was hoping Sunshine would live a good life and thankfully, Antoinette Jadaone did just that. Sunshine shows an important and timely message. That scene when Sunshine speaks up against her pathetic boyfriend Miggy and his pastor dad that she is not ready to be a mother means so much to me. To be able to say no, I choose when this will happen to me and it is not going to happen today. Jennica Garcia's character as Sunshine's older sister is also a powerful performance. The fact that Sunshine had women helping her in her struggles gave hope that in the midst of a very religious and conservative society in the Philippines, there are women who believe that we should have the freedom and power to choose what happens to our bodies.",-1

She was fierce and she cared deeply, pero that doesn't mean that she was ready to be one. I was honestly scared that the film might take a turn…",-1
Sunshine,"Every time I visit Quiapo Church, I’m always amused by the chaos outside its gates. Right beside vendors selling rosaries, crucifixes, candles, and bottles of holy water, there are stalls hawking pamparegla and other herbal concoctions said to “regulate” missed periods. The juxtaposition is striking. Sacred and taboo, salvation and cycle, side by side like it’s the most natural thing in the world. It’s absurd, hilarious, and deeply Filipino. I always find myself thinking, someone should write a story, play, or movie out of this contradiction. With Sunshine, it finally feels like someone did. Fearlessly and with heart.It’s not exactly about Quiapo, but it carries the same beautiful mess of contradictions. Faith and survival, morality and body, dream and disappointment. It dares to talk about reproductive health care in the Philippines without flinching, but it’s also about more than that. It’s about the right to choose. Not just over one’s body, but over one’s future. It’s about women tired of being told to wait, to settle, to stay silent. And finally daring to want more. What makes it powerful is its quiet grace. It doesn’t preach. It listens. To the unspoken shame carried by women. To the whispers exchanged in tricycle/jeepney rides and neighborhood clinics. To the dreams that keep getting deferred by the weight of economy, expectation, and morality. Sunshine is a film that sees women. Not as symbols or martyrs, but as people.Technically, it’s a marvel. The cinematography captures the real Manila. Not the sepia-toned or shadow-drenched “poverty porn” we’re so used to. No extra lighting or artificial grime smeared on walls for the sake of grittiness. No “designing poverty.” The production design feels lived in, never overworked. Every detail feels honest. If I have only one criticism, it's that the magical realism elements could have been woven in more seamlessly. But even that doesn’t take away from the film’s quiet power.Then there’s the acting. Maris Racal delivers the role of a lifetime. Raw, honest, and quietly devastating. Jennica Garcia, whenever she’s on screen, shines. Her presence is magnetic, and together, their chemistry feels lived-in and true.In every sense, Sunshine is a landmark film. It should be our Oscar submission for next year. And if there’s any justice, it should sweep every local award. It’s not just a movie. It’s a mirror. One we’ve long needed in a country as patriarchal and hypocritical as ours. The kind of mirror that’s often hard for Filipinos to look into, but impossible to ignore.",28

As if we had all just witnessed something painfully true and didn’t quite know what to do with ourselves.Because Sunshine isn’t just a movie. It’s a question. A confrontation. Directed with clarity and deep compassion by Direk Tonet Jadaone, Sunshine doesn’t soften its message or try to make it more palatable.. It’s brave. It’s loud in its honesty. It doesn’t ask for permission to be angry or tired or vulnerable. It simply is, and that’s why it hits the way it does. And yet, somehow, even with all its emotional weight, Direk Tonet’s signature humor still finds its way through. There are moments—unexpected but perfectly timed—when the entire cinema bursts into laughter. It’s sharp, it’s honest, and it never feels out of place. Maybe Direk Tonet makes us laugh because she knows we’ll cry eventually. Or maybe that’s just how we are as Filipinos, finding humor even in the heaviest moments, because sometimes, it’s the only way we know how to carry the pain.What makes this film even more powerful is how it gives voice to things we often overlook. As someone who isn’t a woman, I know I can’t fully grasp the weight of that experience. But this film opened a window for me. A clear, honest glimpse into a reality I will never live, but need to see. Much of that power comes from the performances. Maris Racal, as Sunshine, delivers the most vulnerable and grounded work of her career. Her pain is quiet, but it radiates. You feel it in the way she holds her breath between words, in the weight behind her gaze. Jennica Garcia, as her sister, is just as affecting. Her stillness, her softness, the way she listens. She becomes a reflection of what the film asks of us: to pause, to witness, to respond with care. There’s a moment near the end that stuck with me. Sunshine asks, “Gets mo na ba ako?”And while it’s said to the person in the room, it felt like she was looking straight through the screen, asking us, the viewers. And like that person beside her, I hope we all have the courage to say: Yes. We see you. We understand.Please, Direk Tonet, keep making films like this (inutusan pa nga). Keep telling stories that hold space for women to be everything—loud and quiet, strong and hurting, tired and brave. Stories that make people feel seen.Gets kita, Sunshine.",20

Sunshine,"“Gets mo na ba?””Gets ko na.”sulit ang pagsugod sa bagyo bc I get to watch this brave, thought-provoking (that’ll definitely challenge your thinking and perspective) film. the way it throws to people this sensitive but very relevant topic is very straightforward. as it should! because IT IS very important to talk about, especially since people tend to not gaf—or rather think that such a topic is forbidden, but nope, this film will leave you with no choice but to raise discussions with someonesobrang nakakadurog ng puso isipin na dahil walang suporta ng kahit ano at sino at dahil hindi legalized ang abortion sa Pilipinas, many pregnant women—especially those who didn’t even choose to get pregnant—would resort to alternative ways that’ll put their lives on the line. (yung 13-yr-old girl) :( it’s really a very powerful film that delivers a very powerful message. pero aside from that, I love how it was filmed. ang laki talaga ng difference ng cinematography kapag it was also directed by Antoinette kesa kapag siya lang ang nagsulat ‘no? and the supporting cast?? wtf chef’s kiss talaga! sobrang huhusay lalo na ng mga bata at ni Jennica Garcia. galing galing. anyway crush na crush na ulit kita Maris kahit anong mangyari hehehhe",-1

Sunshine,"what does it mean to want something just for yourself, when everyone else thinks they know better?sunshine is about what happens when a girl becomes a symbol— of shame, of failure, of something to fix. it’s about how the world will rally for gold medals but stay silent when a young woman says, i’m not ready.this isn’t just a film about abortion or teenage pregnancy. it’s about the grief of losing the life you fought for before you ever got to live it.all throughout the film i kept thinking: would i have chosen differently if i were in her place?well, that's the point. the choice should be mine. even if it haunts me. even if no one else understands what that could mean.and sunshine, with all her fears and defiance, she reminds us: there is no right way to fight for your life.only your way.",-1
Sunshine,"Gets ko na. I am studying MA Women and Development. I always mention yan dahil di naman ako pinanganak na babae. Pero I feel feminine enough to be a woman. Sa tanan ng pagaaral ko ng kurso ko, andami ko na ring mga babaeng nakasalamuha. Yung feeling ko dito sa pelikulang to ay parang nakausap at nakaharap ko na si Sunshine. Sa mga babaeng nakausap ko, nakadaupang palad ko, natulungan ko, andun si Sunshine. Sa mga babaeng nagtuturo sa akin kung paano maging mas mabuting tao at mas mabuting babae o binabae, andun yung ate ni Sunshine, andun si Mary Grace, andun yung tricycle driver, andun yung hotel receptionist, nasa atin lang silang lahat. Sa buong sinehan sa Sta. Mesa, ako lang ata ang mugto ang mata na lumabas sa sinehan, di ko alam dahil siguro ramdam ko ang danas nila, dahil siguro yung mga nababasa ko sa klase ay totoo nga, at dahil siguro, yung pagkabigo ko sa bawat hakbang or lecture or recitation na naranasan ko sa loob ng dalawang taong pagbabagong hubog ko ay nagkaroon na ng isang imahe. Siguro yung iyak ko dahil sa tapang rin na sana meron ako, na sana meron tayong lahat, kasi yung laban natin, maraming maraming pagsubok pa na dadanasin, taong kukutya, at mga lalaking gagapi, pero sa kabilang dako, alam nating tayo tayo lang rin ang magkakakampi.

Sunshine,"Filipino cinema is so back!the film narrated the struggles of Sunshine with complexity but so much empathy. it's a simple story, but it reflected the things that are very wrong in our sexual and reproductive health system, as well as our societal norms.maris racal, the star that u are! you did not just portray Sunshine, you are Sunshine! you owned the character!every move of your body, every word, and every look of your eyes. the last few minutes of the film brought me to tears.gets ko na!",-1

Sunshine,Gets ko na!P.S. Ang perfect ng casting. Lahat walang tapon but I must commend Jennica Garcia and Redd Bustamante. Jennica is just phenomenal and undeniably the best pick for the role. All her scenes made me cry. Her story arc is just subtle but  present. Redd on the other hand is not a shocker. She’s been one remarkable actress eversince. So happy to see her act again.#PassTheBill #MyBodyMyChoice,10

Sunshine,"I always have a soft spot for movies that depicts Manila in its realest form: hindi romanticized, hindi poverty porn-ish. I think first time kong makita ang Quiapo depicted at night sa pelikula. Manila could be very very dark, parang ang pinagdadaanan ni Sunshine. My favorite part of the movie ay yung nasa motel si Sunshine. You can feel her loneliness, her pain sa loob ng seedy motel room. You are with her that time. How it was shot was phenomenal.Maris! Maris! Sobrang galing ni Maris! It's a role of a lifetime that will definitely lift her up to the ranks of our great actresses. I cannot imagine anyone in this role but her. Yung, again, the motel scene? Napakahusay!Sobrang sensitibo ang abortion as a topic sa Pilipinas bilang isang Katolikong bansa. Sana gawing mandatory viewing ito sa ating lawmakers para makita ang realidad ng kababaihan, lalo na ang kabataan.",-1

Sunshine,"Ang ganda ng film na ‘to. Ang ganda ng cinematography—ramdam mo kung gaano kagulo sa Metro Manila. Ang galing ni Maris. I think she solidified her place as one of, if not the best, Filipina actress in her age group right now (wag nyo lang panoorin ang Sosyal Climbers). Solid ng range niya sa pag-arte. May mga eksena ditong ramdam na randam mo talaga yung sakit na pinapasan nya (emotionally at physically).Gayunpaman, may mga detalye pa ring medyo di nag-klik para sa’kin. May mga creative choices sa plot na questionable depende sa kung saang spectrum ka sa abortion debate. If pro-abortion ka tulad ko, magigets mo ‘to.Overall, a very timely film considering na sobrang conservative nga ng Pilipinas pagdating sa issue na ‘to. Brings to light the unfair challenges women must face just to have autonomy over their own bodies.Feeling great. Andami kong napanood na Filipino films lately!",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine (2024) would be a perfect double feature with Eliza Hittman's Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) as they both tackle similar topics but with a stark difference in privilege and access.where the latter becomes a story of sisterhood and compassion, as two girls cross state lines to get access to healthcare, Sunshine offers no such respite to our eponymous protagonist.in here, what Sunshine wants is not even a matter of choice, it is something that she is forced to bear. all alone as her confidants succumb to the stigma of her dilemma, Sunshine takes to the streets of Manila in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy.the plot moves along while the audience is served scenes of what i believe to be one of the better cinematic depictions of modern Manila. the first few minutes almost feel like an entirely different film (one i would have particularly liked more) until the plot takes a peculiar detour.in all of its realism and poignancy i found a particular element in its storytelling very out of place and oftentimes distracting. while the ending made me understand why those choices were made i just don't think a semblance of Magical Realism is the perfect vehicle for a message as heavy as this one.while i think the point that: ""an entire generation of Filipino women being forced to reckon with their unborn children as if the choice of abortion is something that has to be explained, and in turn, be understood."" is a step in the right direction for this nation's pro-choice discourse, the delivery just felt like it was bordering into Diary of an Unborn Child territory. with that being said, i still thoroughly enjoyed Sunshine and i would still highly recommend it. despite some of my grievances with the film, the unblemished ray of sunshine known as Maris Racal delivers a stellar performance in the titular role. perhaps even a mariesteller one. *wink* *wink*",20

Sunshine,"a powerful film everyone should see. ang dami kong naramdaman habang nanonood. Sunshine sheds light on how pregnancy can profoundly impact a woman's ambition and future. it shows what women, especially the youth, endure when defying the harshly conservative norms of filipino culture — the pressure, the judgement, the weight of it all. ang husay ni maris for delivering the pain and struggle. kudos to miss antoinette jadaone for capturing the reality of our country with raw honesty, even calling out how our healthcare system fails women.",-1
Sunshine,"It is not as moving as I thought it could be, but remains an important film for the conversations it can inspire. For a film that tackles such an important and sensitive theme, I just wished it had stronger sense of conviction. 3 1/2 star but the extra half star is for the performances (we love you Jennica and Maris) and some good shots that reminded me of Brocka— grounded and very telling of the realities of life in Manila.",-1

Sunshine,"This film encapsulates what it means to be a woman. A woman should be free, supported, and empowered to choose who and what she wants to be. Women deserve freedom.",34
Sunshine,"This is my first film in FOUR months?! It’s horrible for my cinephile ass out here…This is the Happening of Filipino cinema, except it’s less thrilling and more aligned with the traditional storytelling of Filipino drama.Perhaps my favorite element of this new project from Antoinette Jadaone is the contrast between morality and sin as personified by the hawker who sells abortion pills behind figures of saints beside Quiapo Church, which is arguably the most popular place of veneration among Catholic Filipinos throughout the country.Beyond that, I’m struggling to seek nuance and proper closure. What sets this work, aside from the palpable gentleness toward the female main character, apart from the many stories about abortion out there?It’s worth noting, however, that stories about women are told by women, just like what Jadaone manages to deliver here. I believe (cis) male filmmakers, no matter how genuine their intent is, cannot tell stories about women because women’s danas, the distinct Filipino word for experience, is not men’s danas.[Watched at SM Mall of Asia Cinema 1]",-1

Sunshine,maris racal you will aways be famous!!! one of the best actresses of this generation!!!,10
Sunshine,"Sunshine is going to be an eye-opener for a lot of people here in the Philippines. It doesn't just raise awareness, it confronts the daily injustices Filipino women face just for being women. This should kickstart long-overdue conversations about reproductive rights, no matter how uncomfortable they may be.Maris Racal gives a career-defining performance as Sunshine. She fully captures the vulnerability, resilience, and quiet strength of her character. She feels heartbreakingly real. The supporting cast also pulls its weight, with Jennica Garcia standing out in a big way.What I really appreciated is how the film frames everything through the lens of a deeply Catholic country. The Sto. Niño statues being sold next to illegal abortion pills and the Christmas lights in the maternity ward stick with you. They are not just background details, they feel like commentary. Birth and suffering are made sacred here, even when they come with pain, even when they are not wanted.Sometimes it feels like the film is about to lean into pro-life messaging, with ""what if"" hypotheticals and future-president guilt trips. But instead of reinforcing those ideas, it pulls them apart. I didn't expect it to handle such a taboo subject with this much care. Subtlety is completely thrown out the window at times, with some characters written like Facebook comment sections come to life. They are loud, caricature-like, and clearly meant to provoke. But the sad truth is that people like that exist.Without getting into spoilers, the film isn’t trying to decide what’s right or wrong. It’s more interested in what it means to be understood.Heavy-handed? Sometimes. Necessary? Absolutely.So with that, we thank God for Sunshine.",12
Sunshine,“gets ko na.”,-1
Sunshine,GETS KO NA,33
Sunshine,"A brave storytelling that tackles hard-hitting truths about our policies, social norms, and the patriarchal system that continue to let women suffer in the Philippines. There’s nothing new in what it wants to say, but maybe that’s the point. Jadaone was able to discuss a topic no one dares to talk about. Sunshine tells the story of so many young women in my country: painful, and far from over. Cried a little bit at the end because... gets na gets kita bhie.",-1

Sunshine,"The moments when our titular character, Sunshine, was hopeless and lost, the first thought that came to mind was: Thank God I’m not a woman. And as soon as I thought it, I recognized how privileged it was to even have such a thought. How easy it is to be a cis man. And because of that, I’ll never truly understand how a woman feels.But this is precisely what the film accomplished—it made me feel.Direk Tonet’s writing and direction are potent and hard-hitting, while Maris’ performance is just as powerful. For a film that exudes a seemingly hopeless atmosphere, with no end in sight to the world’s harshness, Maris’ Sunshine shone like a light at the end of the tunnel.I hope the future is kinder to women, and I hope I get to contribute to paving the way for that future to become a reality.",-1

Sunshine,"No filters. No lies. An honest, no-holds-barred glimpse of women's societal struggles.‎Pro-woman movie. Sunshine is a bold and timely film that opens up vital conversations around abortion and a woman's right to choose. It challenges traditional views by asserting that motherhood is a decision, not a duty—and that bringing a child into the world should be an intentional, compassionate act.‎The film’s message is powerfully delivered through impeccable cinematography and emotionally grounded storytelling. Sunshine which was played by Maris Racal gives a standout performance, capturing the complexities of her role with sincerity and strength. The ensemble cast also deserves praise for their nuanced portrayals, collectively bringing depth to a narrative that is both personal and political.",-1

Sunshine,"I still remember when Direk Tonet shared the concept of Sunshine back in 2021 at a workshop I attended. Everyone knew it was risky, yet the story had to be told. It wasn’t a question of “how” but “when?”Fast forward to today, Sunshine finally lives and receives its well-deserved spotlight. It’s easy for some to dismiss it as “just a film about abortion”. When in reality, it’s a gritty portrayal of thousands of Filipinas—all the dreams and lives lost, the could haves and what ifs. The fact that this film exists (in this political and social climate) is already a miracle. It being one of Direk Tonet’s masterpieces is just a bonus.",-1
Sunshine,Sorry po papa god,16
Sunshine,"My experience with this film didn’t end when the credits started rolling. Walking out of the cinema and into the crowded floors of a large mall, I began to watch people with a weighted heart. The children playing. The mothers of different ages. It left me reeling and in silence for quite a bit, to the point I felt a little sorry to the company I watched the film with. That was the moment I knew this film would leave an impact for a lot of people, and could even be divisive among most of its Filipino audiences.Sunshine leaves a mark. A film that paints a very real, raw, uncomfortable, and deeply moving picture on what it is like to be a Filipino woman with a dream, a mistake, and an agency that is being challenged by those around her—even by herself. It does this through depicting scenes all pointing towards the state of reproductive healthcare in the Philippines, and all those who are affected by it.Its characters are what makes the film so moving. Of course, Maris Racal does a stunning job portraying Sunshine and the character’s emotional complexity. Every character, though, has a purpose and reflects Filipino realities accurately. Perhaps the most special characters are what the film uses as a device to move the story along. At first, I felt unsure of it, but by the end of the film, it was very effective.This is a type of story that I feel, and hope, most Filipinos get to see. It is highly relevant as much as it is good. The narrative, linear structure of the film lends to the experience of the casual spectator; it builds up and comes crashing down. The scene of Sunshine being alone in the gymnasium.. is one that will stick with me for a while.I love this film. Go see it. It is so worth the ₱270.",-1
Sunshine,"Smart, funny, emotional, and heartbreakingly raw and real in showing the state of women's access to, or lack thereof, reproductive healthcare options in the Philippines.MARIS RACAL, THE ACTRESS THAT YOU ARE!! Also, much flowers to the incredibly talented supporting cast!",-1
Sunshine,i fully support this campaign to push safe abortion rights.,4
Sunshine,"Sunshine is the kind of film that lingers in your chest long after the credits roll. It’s raw, urgent, and quietly devastating. Maris Racal gives such a gripping performance—her portrayal of a young gymnast grappling with an impossible choice feels painfully real. The way the film contrasts the clean, structured world of gymnastics with the chaos of Manila's underground makes everything hit harder. There’s so much weight in the silence, the stares, the quiet desperation. It doesn’t hold your hand or tie things up neatly, but that’s what makes it so powerful. Antoinette Jadaone tells Sunshine’s story with empathy and fire, shedding light on the terrifying realities young girls face in a country that offers them no choices. Unflinching and necessary.",-1

Sunshine,"Really a sucker for films where the protagonist chose themselves, a recurring theme in Antoinette Jadaone films and Sunshine might be her best one yet. Being a girl is hard, but being a girl in the Philippines is something else. At the end of the day, it’s our decisions in life that make us. And Sunshine gets to decide. Not some doctor she just met. Not some random pharmacist. And definitely not Miggy. Heck, what’s Miggy gonna do, call his Papa?Dear reader, please go see Sunshine. It’s an important film. PS.

Kinailangan kong makapag-release ng emotions kaya kahit never ko pa naman ginawa, pinush ko magpa-interview to release my thoughts HAHA. Yung kapatid ko na-2nd hand embarrassment na sakin eh pero na-overwhelm kasi talaga ako after the screening. Bahala na kung sobra akong kabado at nag-stutter haha mahalaga nalabas ko yung mga nasa isip ko. Mahal na mahal ko sina Direk Tonet at Maris!! Syempre buong Sunshine team for this gem.",3
Sunshine,"07.24.25braved the storm (eme) to watch this! loved the writing and execution of sunshine's character. the collective catholic guilt is so insane the whole theater is going through it WITH sunshine  the ""sorry po papa god, thank you po papa god"" sequence is both funny and depressing. great film to open up conversations on regressive policies in the PH. women (& unfortunately young girls) need safe and legal access to medical procedures!",28
Sunshine,"For a couple of years, I've lived and roamed in the kind of Manila Tonet has painted for us: busy and dirty streets of Recto and Carriedo overflowing with people trying to make ends meet, the filthy motels of Avenida filled with horny, exploitative men who need them, and the whispering neighborhood all around the tight grid-like system such as Tondo, Blumentritt, San Lazaro, Laon-Laan or Dapitan watching, staring, looking for something to make time pass.Under the watchful eyes of this condemnatory city stands a rather bright-eyed Sunshine, a young female student-gymnast trying to secure her spot in athletic competitions such as the Olympics and SEA Games. Her hard work and dedication have reflected in her routine, and her coach is confident in her skill in making it to the national team. But all of her dreams of soaring global recognition have been put to risk when one day, she discovers she is with child.What's heartbreaking about this piece is that this film is about a young woman working day and night fighting for a country who doesn't fight for her. This is a country where a woman needs to make unnecessarily drastic measures just to live a life she works hard on achieving. This is a country built on guilt and shame, yet a country proudly branded for its resilience. This is a country that veiled its dirt and its scum with the cloak of catholic morals and self-righteousness. This is no place for a sun to shine on.It's easy for me to believe in this film, because it is a true story. This is a biography, not of Sunshine and not of Tonet. This is a biography of Philippines in modern day, and for decades this has been told time and time again from the works of Lino Brocka, Ishmael Bernal, and Brillante Mendoza, to works of Kip Oebanda, Ramona Diaz, and now Antoinette Jadaone. For years filmmakers like them have hoped for a brighter future, hoped for people to open their eyes and unveil what is hidden in plain sight, and Tonet, in this incredible feat, making the movie ticket as cheap and as accessible as it can be, is reaching out to us saying ""This is my country. Look and see.""",-1
Sunshine,"The moment Sunshine opened, I felt like I was already there in her world. That’s one of the things I’ve always admired about Direk Tonet Jadaone: how she builds these quiet, lived-in spaces that don’t just exist for her characters, but completely pull you in. You don’t just watch the story unfold, you feel it with Sunshine.What stuck with me the most is the way the film builds this deeply uncomfortable paradox: a country that loudly declares abortion is murder, yet leaves no room for safe options, quietly allowing dangerous pills to be sold under the table. The contradiction isn’t even subtle, it’s the whole point. Being a Filipino is already hard, but being a woman in the Philippines? It's brutal. The film doesn’t sugarcoat anything, it throws you straight into the brokenness of it all, from healthcare to shame culture to just… surviving.As the story unfolds, you’re taken on this intense ride with Sunshine, a girl trying to make sense of what she’s going through while the world around her offers no real answers. It forces you to confront your own biases. You start to ask yourself: what would I do in her place? What’s the “right” choice, really, when you’re trapped in a society that only ever gives you wrong ones?Menggay’s story hit like a gut punch. It’s the kind of pain that’s so real, but we never talk about because we’re scared to. Menggay isn't just another casualty, at the end of it all -- she's still a kid.What I love most about the storytelling is that it doesn’t preach. It makes you think, it makes you question -- but in the end, it reminds you that it should all boil down to what Sunshine feels is right. What she knows is best. It gives her that agency, that voice, something this world so often tries to take from girls like her.I've always been a fan of Maris Racal, and I agree that this is her best project yet. She didn’t need to go big; her silence already said everything. And I loved how the film used gymnastics as this quiet metaphor of control, performance, and discipline all while her personal life spirals into uncertainty. It’s so smart.And I have to say: the cinematography? Stunning. Of course, the gym scenes were beautifully shot, we all expected that - but it was the motel scenes that floored me. There was something about how those moments were framed that just hit harder. Like everything was raw, exposed, still. And what really stayed with me, long after the credits rolled, was this one feeling: at the end of it all, our dreams, they’re always for the younger versions of ourselves. We fight, we keep going, because we hope they’d understand. That if we ever had to explain why we chose what we chose, they’d look at us and say, “gets kita.”But the question that lingers is: are we, is this world ready for a story as brave as Sunshine?",17
Sunshine,"i love how sunshine stood her ground and said she didn’t want to be a mother, even when her boyfriend’s dad offered help and support. it really showed how sure she was about what she wanted for her life. abortion should be legalized not because people are being careless, but because women should have the right to decide for themselves.and let’s not ignore the elephant in the room: the philippine healthcare system is so messed up. women like sunshine don’t get the care they need. and for what? so the budget can go to another pointless msproject or billboardsized face of some politician? like, please… put the money into actual healthcare. PRIORITIZE PEOPLE, NOT CLOUTsunshine’s is reality for so many. and it’s about time na we listened. amen? AMEN!",-1
Sunshine,"I think the best way to describe this film is that it’s truly a slice of life.Sunshine may be a fictional character, but it’s not impossible to see someone like her in real life. Maybe with a different name but sharing the same story or situation. The film beautifully portrays the strength of a woman as a sister, a friend, an athlete, and most importantly, as herself.I was also really impressed with how balanced the characters were. Even the supporting roles had their moments to shine.And Annika, what a star! I didn’t expect her character to unfold the way it did, but she delivered an outstanding performance, along with another child actor you absolutely need to see!",-1
Sunshine,must watch!!ang galing at gandang-ganda ako sa pagkakasulat ,0
Sunshine,"NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN DYING IN SECRET AND LIVING IN SHAME. I cried because it’s painfully relateable and also bc I know women like her. I’ve been that friend who hears the secret. The details are so specific and real. From the moment she bought the pregnancy kit with shame in her eyes and afraid of judgement — to checking that test in a cramped public restroom where two cubicles exist but only one works. The fear of opening up to even one person and hiding it from her family. Sneaking into a motel for something you shouldn’t be ashamed of,,, all because abortion is illegal. This is a reality for SO MANY women in the Philippines. Women are forced in silence, danger, and in killing our dreams. Abortion should be legal. Thank you to the whole Sunshine team. Lalo kay Maris at Sunshine sa pagdala ng kwento at pagbitbit ng bigat na totoo sa buhay ng maraming kababaihan.",5
Sunshine,that was so heavy,1
Sunshine,"gets na gets, sunshine!!!! ",2
Sunshine,"There’s no denying Sunshine matters - it speaks to harsh truths and tackles its themes with care and emotional honesty. The film had a timely subject, sincere writing, and phenomenal acting - Maris Racal was stellar, while Jennica Garcia delivered with quiet power. But I struggled with certain elements, particularly its attempt at magical realism. The presence of the imaginary child felt clunky, tonally jarring, and out of sync with the otherwise grounded narrative. Frankly, the character felt unnecessary - the film had already evolved past the need for her. The story had power, and I wish it had trusted its own strength without the added flourish. Ultimately, I admired its purpose more than loving its execution.",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine sheds light on a topic many still avoid, the abortion and women's choices. It's not just a Philippine issue, but a global one. Sensitive as it is, this film proves it's a conversation worth having, especially with the youth. Sex education needs attention, lalo na mula sa mga nasa pwesto. The government should support this by pushing for proper education and open dialogue.Kudos to the whole Sunshine team for bringing a story like this to light, something we should be openly discussing in this day and age.",-1
Sunshine,"i'm at a loss for words. a much-needed film in this messed up country. mahal kita, Sunshine, at sa lahat ng mga totoong Sunshine sa buong Pilipinas. sa buong mundo.",6

Sunshine,ANG PERFECT TANGINA,1
Sunshine,"Napakabigat pero isa 'to sa mga napakahalagang pelikula ngayong taon. Unang eksena pa lang ramdam mo na kung sino si sunshine, mga pangarap na bitbit. Ang problemang inilatag ay sistematikong hinahadlangan ang mga karapatan ng mga kababaihan. Tahimik man ang mga eksena pero maririnig mo ang panghuhusga at galit. Matapang ang mensahe. So much heart poured in this film and I found myself nodding throughout with empathy. gets na gets kita Sunshine.Grabe yung iyak, saya at relief hanggang dulo dahil napanindigan ang gustong ipahiwatig ng istoryang ito. Performance of a lifetime ang binigay ni Maris, napakahusay. Malinaw na ang pagiging babae sa lipunang relihiyoso at patriyarkal ay iniipit lamang ang mga walang kakampi. kaya maging isa ka para sa mga nangangailangan.Panoorin. Pag-usapan. Dahil hindi ito natatapos sa sinehan.Gets ko na.",6
Sunshine,"sana mas open pa yung Pilipinas sa mga ganitong issues.Na sa may safe abortion na available sa mga babaeng nangangailangan. Na ang teenage pregnancy ay dahil sa kakulangan sa sex education. Hindi dapat nakakahiyang bumili ng condom at PT. Hindi dapat ipilit lagi ang relihiyon. and tbh di ko gets bat R16 eto, dapat mas open pa sa mas batang teens especially liberated na tayo ngayon.",3
Sunshine,"Puyat ako at almost 24 hours nang gising pero hindi ako inantok kahit isang segundo sa pelikulang 'to. Nakakarindi ang ingay ng emosyon sa sobrang katahimikan. Bibingihin ka sa sigaw ng damdaming matagal nang nagpupumiglas makalabas ng iyong katauhan.Mabigat. Totoo. Malalim.Hindi madaling harapin ang mga problema nang mag-isa, ngunit minsan, kailangan. Nakakatakot, malungkot, at kung minsan gusto mo ng karamay. Ngunit sa lakas ng sarili mong boses na bumubulong, sumisigaw, humihikbi at nagmamakaawa, mahirap humingi ng tulong kung maging ikaw hindi sigurado kung anong tulong ang kailangan mo. Napakaraming salita, emosyon na hindi ko maipaliwanag ang naiparamdam sa akin ng pelikulang 'to. Pero isa lang ang masasabi ko.Maris, ang hirap mong hindi mahalin–at salamat sa kwentong ikinwento mo mula sa puso. Ramdam kita. Sobra.",3
Sunshine,"my first solo movie to watch in the cinema! def worth watching ang galing ni maris dito ebarggg and also learned so much from this film. kudos also to direk tonet ilysm wehehe. made me realize, yet again, how phil needs to fcking wake up and issues like teenage pregnancy, rape, and abortion exist in our society; that we should be more open about these and help those ppl have more options and support rather than just letting them think that abortion is the only choice in order for women to get our dreams. Laban para sa babae!also, loved the last scene sm much where maris was dancing her heart out and annika was watching her with her saying in the end, “gets ko na”. A MASTERPIECE! SUNSHINE GETS KITA. GETS NA GETS KITA!",5
Sunshine,"The premise was simple but the message was hard. It did not just amplify a young girl's struggle with how to handle a life-changing conflict, but it also showed how the external actors play a huge role on how things must go. The film aimed to magnify how conservative the culture of the Philippines is, in which in this modern age, some of it could be considered obsolete.Coming from someone with a short attention span, I found myself staring at the cinema screen for the whole time, even after the film ended. There were no dull parts of the film, all scenes were necessary to how the story flows.Maris Racal's portrayal was exemplary. It was a different flavor from what she was known for, and this might be the turning point to her career. I would also have to give some flowers to Jennica Garcia, even with minimal participation in the scenes, her eyes and her minimal actions spoke volumes.",-1
Sunshine,"such a heavy movie  i think this hit me deep because very relatable struggles as a woman, but im happy a topic like this is being brought to light   movie wise something was missing !!! idk what it is but still worth a watch ! ̈",36

Favorite scenes- Motel scene- Mag-ate scene (Jennica at Maris) - ALL of Annika's scenes- All of Maris Racal's ribbon scenes (specifically last-putangina hagulgol talaga) Most importantly, it shed light on the extreme, harsh circumstances wherein mostly it is caused by rape (yung kaso nung isang…",-1

Sunshine,"What stung most was how her “best friend” turned away just when her presence would’ve meant everything. The scene where their eyes met, she was there, but only halfway. And in the quiet exchange of glances, there was pain, there was care, and there was a silence that said everything.",-1
Sunshine,nabibilang pa ba sa kamay nabuntis ni Elijah Canlas sa pelikula,-1
Sunshine,"In a deep personal level, saying that I like this film is an understatement. This is a well crafted story that follows a gymnast enroute of becoming an Olympian. Antoinette Jadaone is really clever in tackling a stigma with boldness and sensitivity at the same time. I really appreciate that the movie also depicts the reality and scenarios of living in Manila on a daily basis. I also appreciate the shots where the busy streets of Manila is in the backdrop. This may be an overstatement but Lino Brocka will be proud. I do not want to compare but when I was watching this movie, I remembered the late Gil Portes' classic High School Scandal starring Gina Alajar and Sandy Andolong. Its a proof that we need movies like this to be informed and educated.Maris Racal, the entire heart of the movie, humbly carried the story in her back - a teenager who got pregnant in a very religious and conservative country. This is her best one yet - humble, raw and precise. The supporting cast are great, too. Jennica Garcia's eyes are really captivating on those crucial moments. And Anika? Bruuuh, we really need to watch for that little one in the years to come.One of the best Filipino films in recent memory, Sunshine is bold, thought-provoking and relevant. Sunshine deserved all the hype and that f*cking Crystal Bear award. I am waiting for the movie's release since last year and finally, Sunshine is home! And hopefully, this will be a strong contender for the Oscars next year!Mabuhay ang pelikulang Pilipino!",-1

Sunshine,SOBRANG BIGAT. SOBRANG HUSAY. SOBRANG TAPANG.Nakakalungkot isipin na ito ang reality ng mga kababaihan sa isang bansang puno ng hipocrisy. Masakit na walang choice ang mga kababaihan para tapusin ang isang bagay na hindi naman nila ginusto. Sana marami pa ang makapanood ng pelikulang ‘to para mag-open ng maraming conversation at para magkaroon tayo ng progress as a society na kung saan hindi na kinakailangan isugal ng mga kababaihan ang mga buhay nila para lang magkaroon sila ng choice.,3
Sunshine,"Play ""Perpektong Tao"" by Maris Racal.Oh Diyos ko po, mapapatawad N’yo pa ba ako!!!I walked into the cinema with so much expectation—and Sunshine delivered more than my expectations. This is a landmark film. A humanizing, soul-stirring, and bold piece of cinema that dares to speak truth in a country that often prefers silence and compliance.In a nation as conservative and deeply religious as the Philippines, Sunshine dives headfirst into the conversations we often whisper about, especially around the elderly and religious individuals—abortion, reproductive health, sexual abuse (WITHIN the family), and the religious hypocrisy that surrounds them. One of the most powerful moments for me was when she prays to God in the middle of an abortion attempt: “Lord, tanggalin Mo lang ’to, babawi ako sa lahat-lahat.” That line alone—honest and devastating—is a statement that cuts deep into the Filipino moral paradox.Napakagaling. Maris Racal carried this film on her own, brilliantly. No awkward or cringey moments—just pure, intentional acting that hits you right in the gut. This is easily her most brilliant and mature performance to date, and I am hungry for more.Also, just to share my theory: I don’t think the kids she sees represent a “mother figure” version of herself. To me, they were the babies’ little angels, quietly watching over their mothers, protecting them, forgiving them.I laughed, I wept, I cursed out loud inside the cinema. PUTANGINANG PILIPINAS TO. We need to see this. Sunshine deserves every bit of international acclaim it’s been getting—and more. And most of all: the Philippines is ready. Filipinos are ready for this conversation, for this kind of truth-telling, for this kind of art. More than a film, it’s also a wake-up call. Never doubted you, Maris Racal.",-1
Sunshine,"""gets mo na ba?""""gets ko na.""what an important piece of cinema. to think that this is the reality of women in this country is truly heartbreaking...",-1
Sunshine,"bilib na bilib ako sa inyo maris at direk tonet grabe, both their best work to date!a very bold/brave film made and released in a very conservative, highly religious country. ang tapang mo sobra, direk tonet! i knew not to doubt you!official review of sunshine",-1
Sunshine,gusto ko rin ng ate pls,-1
Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is a powerful and unflinching examination of the ongoing issue of teenage pregnancy in the Philippines, anchored by a stunning breakout performance from Maris Racal. The film transcends a simple narrative, offering a poignant and necessary critique of a society grappling with deeply entrenched religious and political views that often leave young women isolated and without agency. Through its raw and unapologetic storytelling, Sunshine doesn’t just present a problem. It takes a stand and demands that we, the viewers, confront it alongside its protagonist.Where the film truly excels is in its unflinching depiction of the societal and systemic failures that trap young women like Sunshine. The Philippines has the second-highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Southeast Asia, and a 2023 survey by Save the Children Philippines revealed that more than 500 adolescents become mothers each day, some as young as ten years old. Sunshine masterfully illustrates the intense personal isolation behind these numbers by using the accessible medium of sports. Read my full review here.",-1
Sunshine,gets,-1
Sunshine,"in the middle of this film is a filipino woman's heart. emotionally charged and swelling over its edges with grit and passion. isang importanteng karagdagan sa talaan ng pelikulang pilipino. every scene is deliberately pieced together to linger. ang galing ng performances dito. kung paano nila binigkas lahat ng linya, kung paano nila binigyang buhay ang kanikanilang karakter, it felt they all wanted to drive the message home. and the score did such an excellent job, not only making the film whole but paralleling the importance of rhythm in the sport it was showcasing. ang ganda talaga.you can say this is a universal message for women's health but you cannot deny its specific context of being filipino. hindi lang sa credits natatapos ang storya ni sunshine. sa iba pang singit ng maynila, there are other sunshines at menggay. sana hindi natin sila biguin.gets ka namin sunshine. sa lahat ng sunshine at menggay, naiintindihan namin kayo. we're proud of you. patuloy nating ilaban ang kalayaan ng bawat kababaihan.",-1

Sunshine,"Everyone should watch 'Sunshine.''Sunshine' presents a highly complex issue that deserves a discussion, at a national level. It's a test that will attempt to reveal your own truth. Its discomfort puts forth a poignant depiction of women-- of Filipino women. I understand Sunshine's decision. But if I were put in the same situation, would I do the same? I'm not even sure. Should you watch it on a big screen? YES! The use of the word 'should' is for a reason. It's mandatory.",12
Sunshine,"this is an easy five. sunshine is a perfect conversation starter on issues like teenage pregnancy, SRHR, and abortion most especially in a conservative country like the philippines. matapang pero may puso. maris gave her all in this film. and the perfect ensemble of cast brought the story life with an intimate, emotional depth. walang kabig sabihin sa aktingan, serve after serve! if the PH has a best casting award, sunshine would most definitely bag it. if you liked zig dulay’s green bones, you would love to watch tonet jadaone’s sunshine! raw, provocative, lapat sa masa. <3",12
Sunshine,"It’s not about dreams versus reality, it’s about the harsh truths that some women face on a daily basis. In a world where society dictates what a woman should or shouldn’t do with her body, Sunshine becomes more than just a story or a character. She’s an act of defiance. Sunshine is the kind of film that whispers until it screams. It’s meant to be uncomfortable, to form ugly conversations we avoid but really need especially in a conservative country where topics about abortion, life choices, and autonomy is still taboo. The way I stare deep into the void after watching.",-1
Sunshine,Kakampi mo ako Sunshine.,2
Sunshine,"Sunshine strips away at any illusion of progress women, cruelly bound by patriarchal laws and the myth their bodies aren’t their own, remain. Raw, unflinching, necessary.Maris Racal exceeds everything she has done before since she bears the film with acute vulnerability. Jennica Garcia is a match to her beautifully. The sister's love becomes as a form of motherhood itself too.Each Filipina forced for fighting for all of her rights deserves such love. This Filipino film is quite vital and a must see.Kudos to our mother ka-eme, Direk Tonet! P.S. Thank you Direk for including Rhed Bustamante :(",-1

Sunshine,"I have a love-hate relationship with the Philippines.My country has it all, a strong historical background and culture, beautiful agricultural sights. The Philippines shines in so many ways. This country is easy to love, but it’s also easy to hate. On the other side of the spectrum, the Philippines is plagued with corruption, deeply oppressive religious standards, and many more hateful traditions and mindsets that continue to affect the Filipino people. The bare minimum is oftentimes glorified as the best that society could do for itself in the Philippines, but is to settle for less to settle for enough? This is the question that Sunshine raises. In a country that struggles to stand for its women, Sunshine did what many movies could not, it fearlessly depicted what was real and happening in our country. It showed the pure, unfiltered realities of a young, adolescent woman facing an unwanted pregnancy. The film doesn’t hold back. From the infamous ‘motel scene’ to the different women we follow in the film, direk Antoinette Jadaone fearlessly portrays the dangers a woman has to go through just to gain autonomy over their body, hopes, and dreams.Upon a second watch (this time with my mom and my cousin), I noticed something about the way Sunshine (Maris Racal) progresses in the film. She starts off as quiet. When she finds out she is pregnant, she only tells her boyfriend and her best friend. When she’s worried or angry, she conceals her emotions. She is held back. She is chained. As the film progresses, she slowly finds her footing, first through the infamous ‘basag windshield’ scene, and then through the numerous situations she finds herself stuck in. There is a scene near the end of the film. Sunshine is practicing her routine. She is emotional, and she’s made up her mind. As she ends her routine, the ribbon falls around her body, chaining her. She has a heartfelt conversation with ‘bata’ and she breaks free from her chains, which directly leads to the ending. Nothing is holding her back, she won’t settle for less, she has had enough.There is a scene in the film between Thea (Xyriel Manabat) and Sunshine. They are at a school canteen, eating separately from each other, but through their eyes, through the way they are looking at each other, you know that they are in support of one another. In a country that fails its women, they are forced to support each other in silence.Listening to my mom’s thoughts and reaction to Sunshine was the best part of my experience with this film. A woman who is somewhat religious, understanding why someone would want an abortion. An emphatic moment between my mom, me, and all the Sunshines in our country. The irony of watching a film entitled Sunshine during tag-ulan season is an irony that’s hard to look past, but I think this film couldn’t have come at a better time. We are settling for less. The streets are flooding, and the women in our country struggle to find the healthcare they deserve. We are chained and we are held back. When will we break free? When will we have enough? For all the Sunshines out theregets kita Sunshine, kakampi mo ako palagi.",-1
Sunshine,"ang dami kong gustong sabihin ang dami kong gusto isigaw, pero sige i-sasantabi ko muna, mahal kita sunshine!!!makaka 4 pages ka sa journal ko",0
Sunshine,"wow. just wow. this movie means so much to me and it holds such deep importance in the current filipino movie canon. we need more movies like sunshine and more conversations about reproductive rights. we need better sex education. we women need to stand together. for all the other sunshines who weren't gifted the best hand in life. direk tonet, i trust you with my life!!!!!",26
Sunshine,"With directorial precision and unflinching clarity, Antoinette Jadaone's Sunshine (2024) makes the claim that being a young woman in the Philippines means navigating systems that deny one's agency on a continual basis. Sunshine (Maris Racal), the main character, gets into a moral quagmire that is influenced by institutional neglect, patriarchal authority, religious orthodoxy, and cultural silence. The film exposes the moral violence meted out to women who dare to choose not to become mothers at all, in addition to the…",12
Sunshine,"I often find it so difficult to be proud of my country. How can I when this is what it's like here?Why do people here cling too hard onto religious beliefs? Why does every opinion of theirs have to be based on religion? Why do women get harshly punished for the actions of men, while they can just go on with their lives like it's nothing? What about not wanting to be a mother yet is so hard to understand?A woman who has been intimate with others is not a whore or ""malandi.""Religion should never be the basis of what is legal and illegal. Abortion is healthcare.Rather than shaming teen mothers, why can't we support their decisions instead?Being a woman in the Philippines is not for the weak.",-1
Sunshine,"“Do it for yourself. Not for the judges, not for the audience. For yourself” was such a definitive line",-1

Sunshine,"Plenty of ironies exposed here, but Quiapo Church being one of the most influential, if not the most influential, religious institutions in the Philippines whilst being a known hotspot for illegal abortion medication doesn’t only feel brave, it is necessary. And truly beyond “no uterus, no opinion,” a woman’s body is solely a woman’s choice. Access to safe abortion NOW.",11
Sunshine,"""Sunshine"" is one of the most important Filipino films of all time as it sheds light on the struggles of women in a conservative country that shames them for not embracing motherhood in any circumstance. It's a powerful story that teaches viewers about empathy, bravely tackling a sensitive topic about women's rights and the dangers women like Sunshine face when a country punishes them for making choices about their future instead of giving them the proper care and support they need.Director Antoinette Jadaone is a creative genius. She masterfully tells the story of ""Sunshine"" in a manner that opens hearts and minds. Hopefully, this movie achieves its dual purpose: To spark healthy conversations about women's health & rights and to encourage people to show kindness and understanding to the ""Sunshines"" of the world. Sana pagkatapos ng pelikula, mas marami ang magsasabi ng mga salitang: ""gets ko na.""Meanwhile, this outstanding story comes alive beautifully on screen also because of Maris Racal's strong performance. Maris slays as Sunshine especially in the quiet times she tries to mask her anxiety and appear calm when her reality is chaotic.Manifesting that this movie becomes the Philippines' entry to the 2026 Oscars.",12

Sunshine,"Such an eye-opener film to conservative filipino audience. Glad they fought for this. Depicts the state of how limited the bodily autonomy of filipinas are, and how conversations about women's reproductive health and rights must persist. A sad reality for the Sunshines we have in the country, all the more reason to be engaged in such conversations and in this fight. Sunshine deserves all its flowers.  Maris was exceptional.",26
Sunshine,"I really admire Direk Tonet’s bravery. Sunshine was not just about the system failing women and their needs, but also tackles the sad reality that Filipinos are still entangled with the conservative and traditional principles they hold. It wasn’t just Sunshine who was being forced to adapt to the system, it was most of the women in Sunshine’s life. I love how the film was almost depicted like it was a horror movie. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a coincidence that I noticed this detail. It was meant to be like that—Manila being a horrible and disgusting place to live, day or night. With that being said, you couldn’t blame those who would draw parallels with Lino Brocka’s Maynila.I feel like each character was written purposely for each actor. The way Direk Tonet writes each character in her stories is always in detail and intentional. Lemme add this film to the ‘Haggard Maris Racal motion-picture’MARIS RACAL TRUTHER SINCE DAY 1!!!",12

Sunshine,“gets ko na”  also can we talk about jennica garcia’s performance?!,-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine overflows with strong political commentary, dissecting how a society steeped in flawed systems, conservatism, and the double standards of religion and morality profoundly impacts our personal and rational choices.While some abrupt jumps between sequences occasionally pulled me out of the experience, the film was largely immersive. The casting is perfect, from Maris Racal as the titular lead, up to the pastor, whose towering arrogance embodies a patriarchal mindset, believing women are inherently reliant on men.The film allows us to fully realize the power of having a choice and making one in a world we wish were kind and harmonious. Antoinette Jadaone's best film to date, Sunshine is thought-provoking, yearning for a time when we can fully embrace and realize our choices once they're made.",-1
Sunshine,such a hard pill to swallow…,1
Sunshine,"A story about women, created and portrayed by women.Galit at takot ang emosyong bitbit ko mula sa simula ng pelikula hanggang sa paglabas ng sinehan.Sunshine is Direk Tonet's bravest film to date. Sulit na sulit ang bawat frame! Halatang hindi minadali. Ramdam mong pinag-aralan ng mabuti ang bawat eksena. Walang tapon in short!This film is a social commentary about women's autonomy and affordable access to healthcare. Exploring these issues (abortion, domestic violence, reproductive health) may seem ""off limits"" to some, but that is precisely why we should continue opening discussions about it. Direk Tonet at sa lahat ng bumubuo ng Project 8 Projects, salamat sa mga pelikula na swak sa masa pero may lalim at tapang.Para lahat ng Sunshine, kailanman ay hindi pagiging makasarili ang pagpili sa sarili.

Sunshine,"sana magrebolusyon si sunshine ahahhahahahaha we need that lino brocka-fication of sunshinepero ang galing!!! ang ganda, ang tapang!!! may alaga yung paghandle sa story. hindi lang siya basta trying hard maging progressive. naalala ko yung sinabi ng isang kasama: hindi nila ayaw sa abortion. ayaw nila sa abortion ng mahihirap. at dahil ayaw ng estado sa abortion ng mahihirap, maraming katulad ni sunshine na dinudugo ang ari at uri. natupad ni sunshine ang pangarap niya. sana matupad din yung pangarap natin para sa bayan. to that we say, decriminalize abortion now! ANNDDDD ALSSOOO dont you just love films where women look after one another? THAT IS SO GIRLHOOD !",3
Sunshine,"The film doesn’t try to impress, it just tells the truth, and that’s what makes it hit. Sunshine had real depth, and her portrayal felt raw and grounded. The supporting characters did what they were meant to - help tell her story without stealing the spotlight.What stood out to me visually was how natural everything felt. The cinematography wasn’t overly stylized, but it matched the tone and mood perfectly. Set against the harsh backdrop of Manila, the film captured that mix of grit, morality, and religion in a way that felt all too real. It opens up an important conversation about sex education, teenage pregnancy, and abortion - topics we often shy away from, but ones that need to be talked about.More than anything, Sunshine shows how hard it is to be a woman in a world that’s stuck and unforgiving. It doesn’t scream its message, but it stays with you. If there really is such a thing as a “best,” this might just be one of Jadaone’s strongest works and definitely Maris Racal’s best performance yet.",-1
Sunshine,"Unflinchingly raw and emotional, the film captures the quiet defiance and inner turmoil of women who dare to pursue their dreams in a society that remains indifferent, or even hostile, to those who choose ambition over expectation and personal truth over misplaced morality.",-1

Sunshine,"Loved this.  Thank you for such a brave film, Direk Tonet and Maris. I’m considering a path in sexual health medicine after I finish fellowship and someday when I go into the academe, sana magamit ko itong film as something to teach my (med) students.We have to learn to be more empathetic as a country. We deserve to make our own choices in life and we should grant the same grace to others. We also have to educate ourselves and others (libre ang condoms and HIV testing in LGU centers and some clinics like Likhaan also offer free contraceptive implant!) instead of outright judgment.I’m very glad this film is reaching a lot of people; may it be more successful in the coming days. ",5
Sunshine,"WHAT A FILM FROM A GREAT DIRECTOR AND A GREAT LEAD! Its as if the main role was really predestined for maris racal. Made me emotional sa maternity ward, women really has so much empathy especially towards their own. I think thats what make women really powerful.",36
Sunshine,"We are in a limbo. So much of Philippine cinema, especially that which makes the rounds in local and international film festivals, is stuck churning out “groundbreaking” firsts. Because our cultural discourse is so behind, our filmmakers are tasked not only with telling stories, but also with inventing the stories to be told. They’re required to stake out new thematic ground, not in service of aesthetic evolution, but simply to keep up with the global conversation. The cost of this is a cinema that often feels overburdened with didactic intent and undernourished in emotional and formal rigor.In a particularly polarizing gesture, Jadaone introduces a hallucinated child character, a device that indirectly echoes Jojo Rabbit (2019). But this choice results in jarring tonal shifts that muddle the film’s emotional center. What was perhaps intended as farce to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour. It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility. In fact, by personifying an unborn child as a character which speaks and thinks, then Sunshine unintentionally reinforces the very moral framing that anti-abortion rhetoric thrives on. It circles back into the age-old “when does life begin?” debate—a question that continues to paralyze policymaking in the country, even when the conversation should be about autonomy, access, and proper healthcare. The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, literalizes it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics. What’s more revealing than the film itself is the discourse surrounding it: a ubiquity of gender-essentialist and bioessentialist defenses, as if any critique of any form is automatically a threat to representation. That instinct: to guard a film’s cause rather than evaluate its craft just proves how far behind we are as a nation in talking about gender politics in filmmaking. The refusal to embrace genuinely revolutionary tactics, whether in politics or art, has kept us coasting on the optics of progress ever since.Full review for the Kinoise Substack published here",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is the product of the environment that failed her. It's an excellent movie that's blatantly shows how women are being boxed with limited rights and decisions in their lives with her being a young gymnast who is forced to weigh her personal dreams against societal expectations. What makes the film compelling is how honest and raw it is which made it difficult and easy to digest at the same time. It's difficult to digest since the film doesn't sugarcoat nor romanticize, it confronts. It slaps us with the reality that our system is really crooked when it comes to having the options such as abortion which draws you into Sunshine’s emotional turmoil. It's also easy to sort out as well as the film itself utilized a lot of symbolism and metaphor that's very comprehensible to the young audience since it was depicted in way of being simple and straightforward.This is the kind of film that should have been made long ago. Its themes were not only relevant, but urgent not only within the country but the world. Sunshine deserves to be shown in schools, especially for young women who are still learning to navigate their autonomy and choices in a culture that often denies them both.All I can say is that Sunshine is not just a film, it's a conversation starter, a one we desperately need.P. S. That LRT scene at the motel as well as that quiapo side profile scene !! Kudos Sir Pao!! P. P. S. Totoo nga 'yung tweet tungkol kay direk, babae ang bida sa mga pelikula ni direk tonet. Go Greta Gerwig we have at home! Char!",20

Sunshine,"feeling overwhelmed so let me write a short cluster of thoughts. it's about time for a film like this and I couldn't be happier to witness it. I don't think I have words in either english or tagalog that can express how much this moved me. but this movie is so important. and it can mean so much to women who navigate this kind of society. whether you're going through or went through the same challenges sunshine did, it wasn't hard at all to relate to her and I can only hope that everyone who sees this film, specially now that it's released to the general filipino audience, will emphatize with her. there were elements of the story that I wish had been woven in better but I couldn't hate them for it.I also have to praise the cinematography. people were saying how the it gives off lino brocka's maynila and insiang and wow were they right. more filipino cinematographers should fall for this propaganda. basta grabe kayo maris at direk tonet (wow tropa), husay niyo po opo pinaiyak niyo ko. gets na gets ko na!!!",-1

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone's latest cinematic offering, Sunshine, is not merely a film; it's a mirror held up to society, reflecting uncomfortable truths that many would rather ignore. While the narrative might feel familiar to some, its power lies in its unflinching, raw depiction of a story deeply grounded in the realities of the Philippines. Jadaone takes a universally understood plight and fills it with a distinctly Filipino soul, making it resonate with profound authenticity. At the heart of this poignant drama…",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine and Mary Grace’s story hits hard. Not all of us are athletes, but their pain is painfully familiar to many women. It’s the kind of injustice that breaks your heart and makes your blood boil.After watching, my mom simply said, “That was meaningful.” And she’s right. This film isn’t just a story. It’s a wake-up call. Here’s to hoping for a world where women can live without fear, without judgment, and with full control over their own bodies.",-1
Sunshine,isang mahigpit na yakap sunshine. sobrang bigat ng pelikula na 'to at sobrang TAPANG! sana mas pag usapan pa ang ganitong klaseng sensitibong topic at mas marami pa ang maka-gets.,-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine isn't afraid to show what it truly means to be a woman in the modern world. In a society where your choices are often shamed, imposed, or forced into the very core of your identity, Sunshine remains steadfast in her decisions. We are too unforgiving towards women—too critical, too much of everything. And for a 19-year-old girl simply wanted to chase her dream, who are we to shame her for the choices she takes pride in?The film is heavy, filled with thrilling sequences and beautiful picturesque cinema that adds an insightful edge to its narrative. It doesn't shy away from the realities of living in Manila, where everything is muddy, dreary, and dried in irony. It reminded me at different tangents of Black Swan and Manila in the Claws of Light—a woman haunted by the consequences of her actions while navigating Manila's streets with weary kindness and understanding.All I can say is, ""Gets ko na."" Sobrang gets ko. Each of our choices is valid and every human experience is nuanced. Puno't dulo ng pelikula ay kababaihan, at sana mas marami pa makapanood nito.",-1
Sunshine,Ang tunay na pelikula ay matapang.,-1
Sunshine,"In a country where a uterus can feel like a prison, Sunshine breaks through the silence with a scream.This is not just a film—it’s a rebellion against a system that punishes Filipinas for daring to survive.What a fearless and necessary filmz Sunshine dares to confront a brutal reality in a country where abortion remains illegal and where women’s rights are often reduced to whispers—silenced by false morality and systemic neglect.Antoinette Jadaone’s storytelling isn’t just intimate; it is a searing indictment of how the state and even the healthcare system fail Filipinas. This film reminds us that every choice a woman makes is shaped by power structures that shame her, control her body, and turn compassion into judgment. Through Sunshine’s journey, we see how being a woman in the Philippines means living in a constant struggle for autonomy—ang hirap maging babae, pero mas triple ang hirap ng mga babae dito sa Pilipinas.Sunshine is not just a movie; it is a mirror held up to a society that polices women’s bodies while abandoning them in their most vulnerable moments. It’s a rallying cry for the Sunshines, Theas, Helenas, Geleens, and Edens of this country—voices we must hear, stories we must protect.May this film be the turning point for our generation: progressive, pro-women, and unapologetically pro-choice.Thank you to the entire Sunshine team and SM Cinemas for making this powerful narrative accessible by lowering ticket prices. This is cinema with a purpose.",-1

Sunshine,"The anti-abortion people will always counter the pro-abortion with “Think about the child!” without even thinking that the hypothetical child they protect would obviously side with their mother. That’s probably my favorite part of the film, when the apparition-ed child, slowly revealed to be the baby in Sunshine’s womb, yet to be born, but who already became her conscience and shadow, finally understood why Sunshine had to make the decision. This is Antoinette Jadaone making a courageous case as to…",5
Sunshine,Definitely Maris Racal’s breakout performance.,-1
Sunshine,no notes it’s been an hour and i’m still speechless,1
Sunshine,"Maris Racal is astonishing as she gives a star-making performance in Antoinette Jadaone's finest film yet. Sunshine takes us by the hand in a bustling Quiapo that's full of hypocrisy, contradiction, and a brutal system on women and their bodies. It's a random odyssey of a woman trying to take back what is her's in an unforgiving conservative society. In the film's opening moments, we see an ambitious athlete confused and paralyzed with the news of her untimely pregnancy. She's scared and she's prolonging the agony of confronting the inevitable. One thing that some people may ask is, why doesn't she immediately ask anyone for help? Doesn't she have a family? Why is she trying to deal with such a serious problem on her own? Is this the society that we've grown into? Where a young woman is so afraid and paralyzed to get any help that she risks her life trying to deal with it on her own? The answer is a resounding YES. We are living in a country where dominant beliefs and religion are shoved down in women's throats even if it means giving up their dreams. Where young women are scorned and defined by their mistakes instead of being educated and getting a strong support system. Most egregiously, we live in a society that stigmatizes and punishes women but tolerates the very system, and actions that led to their unwanted pregnancies. That is the society that Jadaone perfectly paints in this harrowing film. Jadaone uses Quiapo as the backdrop to tell this story as she blends elements of neorealism and magic realism. This film has a great sense of place as Sunshine roams around a Quiapo that hides hypocrisy underneath its Catholic cathedral. Jadaone goes full Brocka mode through these scenes as she showcases different communities and people through a neorealist lens. That's why I found the film's surrealist tendencies to be a little bit jarring. Sunshine encounters a kid that appears only through her consciousness and it really makes you wonder if this type of storytelling fits the themes that Jadaone is exploring. It just runs the risk of making it too melodramatic and undercutting its authenticity. But what keeps it from going off the rails is her unwavering compassion and understanding of Sunshine's plight. Direk Tonet did mention in the Q&A session after that she swore that she was gonna hold Sunshine's hands and be by her side through every turbulence she'll face while writing this movie. In the film's third act, the neorealist and magic realist narratives just blend into a powerful, poignant, and profound moment while Sunshine practices her routine one last time. I think this is a film that our country desperately needs right now. It's bound to spark debates and fruitful discussions about abortion, reproductive health, and women's right. Some may disagree with what Sunshine ended up doing, but at least this is a film that ignites a discussion for these taboo topics. I will never know how it feels to be a woman in an unfairly conservative country. But this film rings with so much vitality, bravery, and honesty that I just cried by the end of it. This is so damn close to being a masterpiece. Gets ko na!",25

Sunshine,"not rating this kasi sabi nga ni rachel green, ""no uterus, no opinion""",0

Sunshine,"Maybe most ingenious about Sunshine is its willingness to accept the decision to abort likely also involves a negotiation with the unborn child, maybe even a plea for forgiveness—less from God, because getting that would be easy, and in fact Sunshine gets it out of the way early on, but more from who the child would have been. For the film indeed that is the longer battle, and it affords Sunshine a long array of events that could make the explaining easier. She sees her dilemma reflected in the city's decay, her choice—which she readily makes—put into perspective, rounded out, by another girl's inaccess to that choice. Very carefully, and backed by research, Jadaone dissects what that choice may mean for women like Sunshine in a developing city like Manila, where dreams are scarce and their fulfillment even rarer. Sunshine's choice is an act of self-determination, in a world where that's seen as vulgar, irreverent: that is clear. But to what should reverence be owed, in any case? Sunshine argues it's simply a matter of priority. When Sunshine chooses her dream—which she's been carrying in her womb longer than she's known her unborn child's ghost—we empathize with her, as does the ghost. That shows the film’s executed its heavy work.",20

Sunshine,"a lot of things were going on in my mind after watching this. mimicking what my friends say about this, it is indeed an important movie which hopefully, can open the doors for discussing the decriminalization of abortion and better, making the state strive toward a world that would not need it in the first place. quoting from one of my eye-opening reads this year, which greatly sums up my thoughts about abortion:“…focusing solely on the ‘right’ to have an abortion obscured the many other determining factors around childbirth, child-rearing and family. It absolved the state of its responsibilities to create the support mechanisms for raising families. If the decision to have a child is simply a woman’s choice, the responsibility for the well-being of children is shifted onto mothers instead of the society in which children are raised.”feminism, interrupted: disrupting power by lola olufemiinterestingly, what struck me the most was the portrayal of manila and the people living in it. kaya kahit alam kong marumi, masikip, at mausok ang maynila, it feels alive and weirdly enough, i get comfort from it as it highlights how much of it stems from our collectivist culture.random pero napansin ko rin na whenever kids swear in this movie, medyo pilit at nagiging borderline darryl-yap-style of filmmaking for me lmao  anyways dami kong ebas (na puro disconnected ideas) pero i feel like the movie needs a little more push and it would be harsh to confine it into a rating kasi importanteng movie siya so di ko na lang talaga lagyan hahahaha but overall it’s a nice watch. star-studded sha jshdhdjshs",5

Sunshine,"If there’s anything that is uniquely Filipino in terms of interior design, it’s the green walls. It generally evokes feelings of tranquility and harmony, but Jadaone’s latest film flips it around to signify chaos and dysfunction. The color is almost everywhere, it’s inescapable: the walls of the protagonist’s home, the sterile and hostile clinic spaces, even the motel where the film’s lead almost died, comparable to the grip Catholicism has on the Philippines. While they say there’s a separation between the church and the state, it’s barely upheld in practice, as they hinder human rights that could save thousands of lives. And yes, I am talking about abortion laws, or the lack thereof here in my country. Jadaone’s Sunshine addresses the huge elephant in the senate, as it depicts the life of its titular lead (Maris Racal), whose life is turned upside down due to a sudden news of her own pregnancy. It’s easy to blame women like Sunshine for getting pregnant. After all, she’s presented as a domineering figure in her sport, even bound to compete in the Olympics, and she technically practiced unsafe sex, but not every case of unwanted pregnancy is like that.There are multiple shots where Sunshine is physically separated by a fence-like barrier: be it the metal gates in the church, the ever-stretching horizontal jeepney rails, or the cold and black window frames, that subtly signal how Filipinas are imprisoned by their surroundings. Almost every gratingly infuriating, thought-provoking, and ludicrous dialogue circles back to one simple question: why is it that women are the ones penalized and restricted on matters that could jeopardize their own health and safety, especially in pregnancies caused by rape and incest?While watching, I was constantly reminded of a film with similar thematic points, that of Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, and how women need to be discreet, travel thousands of miles, and suffer in silence over matters that should be openly discussed and not considered taboo or immoral. If anything, I think this film is being highly censored in the Philippines, as the movie review board slapped an R-16 rating on a film that should be watched by teenagers. How can we avoid teenage pregnancies when our government avoids talking about practicing safe sex to the right demographic? Not everyone gets a happy conclusion like Sunshine did, so I hope that this film sparks a necessary conversation about women’s rights outside of the walls of movie theaters. Jadaone’s Sunshine is truly one of the Philippines’ best releases of the year so far, in both its themes and execution, and a must-watch for all types, especially men and the religious-alike.

Sunshine,"the movie represents feminist literature while being deeply empowering, and i think empowering is understatement, it’s more than that. it talks about women’s bodily autonomy and choice, and maka question ka how system so broke and dysfunctional because grabe ka oppressive and controling sa society, throughout the film it will ignite a meaningful and healthy discourse, especially sa mga feminist. the film opens for interpretation, sunshine could possibly did not make it to the olympics due to the lack of access and proper reproductive healthcare diri sa pinas. as the story unfolds, you can attest that taking unsafe abortion pills may have led to a tragic complication, putting her life at risk, for a fact that she did not received medical guidance or safety assessment during her most vulnerable moments—much like what happened to menggay.and its a call for action actually, just in time, to encourage everyone to watch this especially to cultural conservatives and traditionalist, they need to watch and consume this type of media to try to understand and empathesize more kung gaano ka importante sa mga babae ang magkaroon ng choice.mas ni nindut ang experience sa pag watch ani sa big screen ky naa sila derik ug maris!!!!(the only disappointing about the experience is how the first movie time slot was compromised, supposedly in our time slot sila dapat mo join mag watch, but they added another time slot so they only had to make a pre-screening remarks zozo sad)",36
Sunshine,"2nd watch.Sunshine (2024) is not an easy film to rewatch, with its unflinching portrayal of its heavy subjects. At times it moves like a horror film, which it may as well be, as it shows the terrifying reality women like Sunshine face in the Philippines - a nation that fails its women with its conservative beliefs seeping through judging eyes and remarks, outdated legal structures, and a broken healthcare system.Added a half star this time: A central plot device that didn't work a lot for me the first time around managed to move me better this time.",12

Maris Racal's portrayal of Sunshine was incredibly raw and natural. her story shows the strength of women and the courage to stand up for what's right, even when it goes against the law, challenges personal beliefs and faith, or unfolds in an oppressive, male- dominated world.TRULY A GEM!!!",20

Sunshine,"We watched Sunshine yesterday, July 24, during the block screening at SM Megamall. I had seen the trailer beforehand, so I knew we were in for something bold, something necessary. But I wasn’t prepared for how deeply it would sit with me long after the credits rolled.I didn’t cry while watching the film, but once it ended, I found myself overwhelmed. The weight of Sunshine doesn’t hit all at once — it lingers, it settles. And it stays.At its core, Sunshine is the story of a woman taking control of her body in a society that keeps telling her she isn’t allowed to. It’s not simply about one choice, one moment, or one woman. It’s about the collective experience of many Filipinas who navigate a system that consistently fails to hear them.Antoinette Jadaone’s direction doesn’t shy away from discomfort. She faces it head-on, inviting the audience to confront the silences we’ve learned to live with - about abortion, reproductive rights, the stigma around sexuality, and the lack of access to informed sex education in the Philippines.Sunshine is timely, urgent, and painfully real. It gives voice to the cry of our generation, echoing the need for progressive reforms that protect women and children. The film challenges its viewers not just to empathize, but to act.As a viewer, I left the cinema not only moved, but also awakened. Sunshine isn’t here to entertain. It’s here to disturb, to provoke, and to push us into uncomfortable yet necessary conversations.To my fellow Filipinos: let’s not turn away. Let’s create spaces where women can speak freely, where choices about their bodies are met with compassion, not judgment. Let’s demand that our lawmakers stop treating reproductive health as taboo.To filmmakers and storytellers: keep telling these stories. We need more films like Sunshine—bold, unapologetic, and grounded in truth. The personal is political, and cinema has the power to move both heart and policy.Let Sunshine be a beginning. Let it be a spark. And let’s keep the conversation going.",-1

Sunshine,"Walang Sunshine sa mundong patas.Hindi ko mapigilang ihalintulad ang Maynilang ipinapakita ng Sunshine sa Maynila na kung saan nakilala si Lino Brocka. Amoy mo ang malamayang usok ng mga sasakyan at hindi mo na ito kailanman malabas sa iyong sistema. Mahapdi ang tirik ng araw sa balat. Ramdam mo ang pawis sa balikat ng bawat kasalubong na para bang ramdam mo na rin ang bitbit nilang bigat. Rinig mo ang ingay ng mga umiiyak na sanggol sa kapitbahay at pati ang nakabibinging busina ng tren na dumadaan sa Avenida. In a Quiapo churchyard, abortion pills are sold right across the “abortion is a sin” signages. In a cramped hospital, the doctor who preaches their kind and merciful God is the same one who will shame you until you are forced to say I’m sorry, God, repenting a thousand times not to a benevolent being, but to a woman in a coat. Four women, round bellies squeezing against each other, share only two small hospital beds. Hundreds more in that one tiny room, some whose dreams never saw the light of day. I’ve had two girls already. You’re so lucky that your child is a boy. The horrifying realization that 13 isn’t even the youngest of them.Hindi mabait ang mundo, at mas lalong hindi sayo mabait ang mundo kung babae ka. But sometimes, it takes just a sliver of warmth to remind you that you are not alone. The kind that comes from the ate sa botika who hands you a pregnancy test without judgement. The kind that comes from your best friend texting they love you right when you don’t know if you’re making the right choice. Or the kind that comes from the gentle caress of a young girl bleeding out, telling you she does not want to die in the back of a police car. How you can sense that the fear in her voice is also the one that crept up on you days before, as the motel lady put you in tricycle telling the driver to hurry to the hospital. I’ve always found the word “ate” to be a strong signifier of the tight the bonds between Filipina women. We may not know each other, but we know that we carry similar burdens. Call a woman ate and their heads turn with instinct. The film does not only show you the grim, unrelenting, cruel Manila that takes (and claws) more than it gives. Nor does it exclusively show you the girlhood that was stolen from you by the capitalistic and patriarchal structures so deeply embedded in society.Yes, it shows you that. It does not hold back from showing you how tiresome it is to clean the poo of a newborn or how much more easy it is to find empathy in illegal markets than it is in public institutions. Yet, what it also shows you is that whenever you feel like a lone speck of light in the dark, just call an ate. Ask them for help. Rest on their shoulders. You are all each of you has. The film itself does its job of telling an important story beautifully. One of the key narrative devices may be a bit too on the nose for some viewers, but I find that it adds a sort of tangibility and gravity to the story that otherwise would have been missing some heart and soul without it. Tonet’s directing is sharp and focused on such visceral and visual contradictions. Racal is bursting with passion and rage…vulnerable…and stellar. Everyone from her coach and older sister down to the younger kids our titular character meets held so much weight in their portrayals. Noong pinapanood ko, ang nasa isip ko, tunay na tao ‘tong mga pinapanood ko. Walang Sunshine sa mundong patas. Ngunit, hindi patas ang mundo natin. Kaya mabuti nalang at may pelikulang ganito (in a country where abortion is illegal, at that). Mabuti nalang na sa bawat lalaking kagaya ni Miggy at Bobot na nagdidesisyon para sa buhay ng kababaihan, may mga katulad ni Sunshine na hindi takot i-reclaim ang kababaihan niya.

Sunshine,"Sinugod and Bagyo at Baha Para Kay #SunshineMovie May mga pelikulang tumatagos hindi lang sa mata, kundi pati sa kaluluwa. At sa mga pelikula ni Direk @tonetjadaone, ramdam na ramdam ko 'yan!I’ve recently been staying in Manila for a few months now. I've walked through Quiapo and the surrounding areas, felt the pulse of the city, and Sunshine just nailed it – physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Ang gulo mo, Manila, pero grabe ang vibrancy mo! Para akong nasa loob mismo ng pelikula, bawat sulok, bawat ingay, bawat damdamin, kumakapit.Gano'n din ang naramdaman ko sa That Thing Called Tadhana. Amats na amats ko 'to! Hindi lang dahil sa hugot story, kundi dahil sa pagkakalarawan nito sa Baguio at Sagada. In fact, I've been frequenting Baguio because of its impact – hindi lang dahil sa kuwento, kundi sa kung paano nito ipinakita ang Baguio at Sagada sa audience.Both movies made me cry! There's something so raw and real in how Direk Jadaone captures the essence of these places and the human emotions within them. It's more than just a story; it's an experience.I watched Sunshine on the same day as Fantastic Four, and while I enjoyed both, there's no question for me: this movie, Sunshine, should be watched in cinemas, as a community. It's a communal experience, something that sparks conversations and shared emotions. 'Yung Fantastic Four, pwede na 'yan sa Disney Plus kung tight ang budget. But Sunshine? It deserves the big screen, the collective gasps, and the shared tears.I genuinely hope this movie reaches everyone's radar. SANA MA GETS NYO NA RIN. It's a beautiful, messy, vibrant love letter to Manila, to our values and religion as a nation, and to the stories that shape us.Ang galing nyo @MissMarisRacal @planetjennica Annika @project8proj",31
Sunshine,"Gets ka namin, Sunshine",2
Sunshine,from singing sunshine ng davao to aborting sunshine ng maynilaILY MARIS AND DIREK TONET,2
Sunshine,"Bakit? Nanay ba kita? Gut-wrenching and brave, Sunshine speaks truth with honesty and feminine rage in a heartbreaking story of womanhood, a character study that puts a young woman, an aspiring Olympian in the most harrowing ordeal — pursue her dreams or let go of it, continue her pregnancy or terminate it. In a country where traditions and conservatism plague our sociopolitical landscape, and at a time where the world at large is being corrupted by right-wing fundamentalists, Sunshine stands with a strong pro-choice message; that women should have the rights to bodily autonomy despite the patriarchal structures that harp on religious preachings in which our women have to pay social costs or worse, their own lives and safety. At the center of it is Sunshine, played by the brilliant Maris Racal whose tenacious yet delicate character work put so much layers to a heartfelt protagonist. In the first 10 minutes alone, Racal delivered a string of unbridled emotions, from being flushed with regret, anger and desperation, she grew with intensity, defiance and vulnerability. Her resolve is one of strength and a moving emotional core that’s unshakeable while being present in every turn in Sunshine’s dilemma in which we met the most colorful and textured cast of unusual characters. Even with Racal’s stellar lead performance, every supporting actor also put on a remarkable stamp that not only served their scenes but also the entire story. From Jennica Garcia to Annika Co to Elijah Canlas to Meryl Soriano to Xyriel Manabat to Angeli Bayani to Rhed Bustamante to Piolo Pascual, it’s perfectly casted and Jadaone made sure that they deliver a well-calibrated turn for Sunshine’s story. A chilling and entrancing dissection of womanhood, the film shifts gears as a sports movie to a melodrama injected with some satire, absurdity, and a mystical element, it’s full of inspired creative choices that are in full concerto. With its spectacular cinematography and production design from drab and somber interiors with a hint of natural light or sometimes depressing fluorescent light, to neon-tinged urban areas where chaos lingers just around the corner while also capturing Sunshine’s extraordinary close-ups behind window railings that cage her or framed by her vibrant pink ribbon; its outstanding sound design that puts Sunshine’s inner turmoil at the center of a noisy Manila and blends a surrealist element to its heart; and a formidable original music that juxtaposes Sunshine’s personality from her life as an gymnast to her personal life. Sunshine is an urgent film that needs to be seen and heard, there’s power in its universality and Tonet Jadaone’s feminist voice soars with an elevated storytelling. Beaming with Filipino sensibilities and humour, its melodrama is used with beautiful intent while being grounded and playing with raw emotional reactions from the cast, and levity and grit in its screenplay. And as cliche as it sounds, it’s a totally different Jadaone that made this movie. There’s maturity that put her titular character at the center of a well-crafted film but there’s this restraint we haven’t seen before that refined the story’s message without ever being didactic. Undoubtedly, her best film yet, an opus that cements her place as an important voice in Philippine cinema but also a landmark film that tackles subject matters that only a handful of Filipino filmmakers have touched on. An absolute achievement in today’s climate of Filipino cinema, there’s power in its tone and its themes — a protest that exposes controlling hypocritical men and medical professionals, and an interrogation of a systemic inequality full of government’s shortcomings in giving proper care and support for unwanted pregnancies, in a place where poverty and overpopulation have been a decade-long problem. But also in Sunshine, we found hope and her light in confronting her reality while finding women who helped and listened to her, a kind of feminism that celebrates sisterhood even in the most horrifying circumstance in a woman’s life. With high hopes, this should spark a conversation about women’s struggles and rights. In light of the overturning of Roe v Wade in the US, akin to Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Sunshine’s story is real and rampant in the PH, and as disturbing as it sounds, unsafe abortion have been killing 1 in 3 Filipinas each day. —————This reminded me of a podcast conversation I once listened to about a woman talking to her mother at a time she’s getting to know her more as an adult. She’s learning about her mom’s history and asked her if her mother ever wondered about living that life instead of having her. Of course the mother responded that she’s happy that she’s born and she’s her child. To which she replied with, “if I didn’t happen, YOU would have been born.”I think motherhood is beautiful but do you ever wonder what kind of woman your mother would have been if society gave them the rights to choose or their religion didn’t make them to aspire to fit into a mold of a woman? Maybe she could have been a president or she could have invented the cure to HIV/AIDS? Who knows?",-1
Sunshine,that inn room scene ... SHET,-1
Sunshine,"Too often, films about abortion fall into the trap of emotional manipulation, when they push a specific agenda, reducing a complex issue to a simplistic, black-and-white narrative. But Sunshine rises above that pattern.Instead, the film offers a nuanced portrayal of the struggles (and even rage) experienced by women who are denied access to reproductive healthcare - told with such compassion and delicacy that you cannot help but empathize with and root for Sunshine because the conservative society has failed her. I hope many people get to watch the film because it is both a deeply personal and universal story that casts a light on one of the most pressing crises in the country: teenage pregnancy. And I also hope Sunshine ushers in a healthy and open conversation because women deserve the right to make decisions for themselves. This is the kind of film I’ll be thinking for days kasi ang bigat pero napaka-cathartic panoorin. And it features a talented (and reliable) ensemble of actors - napakahuhusay ng lahat, lalo na ng mga kababaihan.",5
Sunshine,"I knew this would be important, but I did not think writer/director Antoinette Jadaone would go this hard! I truly, truly appreciate the commitment.This is a perspective that has long since needed to be shared. These are the stories that need to be told! It sent out a message, not by preaching, but by showing different realities faced by many, and trusted the audience to come to their own conclusions.If the reactions in the cinema were any indication, this has already started a conversation. I'm seeing posts on Reddit from people who have been through some of the same or similar situations. I hope it keeps people talking until the things that need changing finally change for the better.Beautiful work. Powerful message.Thank you for telling these stories.",-1
Sunshine,"Direk Tonet Jadaone holds a mirror up in the middle of Quiapo and asks the question: what is the proper protocol to take control of your life? Does the prayer come before or after the abortifacient? Does the boyfriend have to take it too? Sunshine, as a film and as a character, is bold and unwavering. She doesn't preach or ask for pity. She doesn't beg for the forgiveness of her boyfriend or the religious. The story is clear all through out -- Sunshine has made her decision, and while she seeks understanding, she seeks it only from those who matter, not from the audience and definitely not from the holier-than-thou.While Sunshine embarks on her journey to find answers, we never forget what she is -- a young girl in the Philippines, left to deal with the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy alone. It is so easy to put the blame on women or on impulsive, lustful teenagers, but the film reminds us that in a country where religious biases trump teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality rates, pointing fingers helps no one. The film reminds us that for women and other marginalized sectors, the first line of defense against systemic neglect is community.Brave and unfiltered, I can easily see Sunshine becoming a Filipino classic. What a beautifully written, directed, and acted film. This is Direk Tonet's best so far, and definitely a career-defining performance for Maris Racal. Gets ko na. Gets na gets.",17

Sunshine,yuh ,1
Sunshine,"Heavy raindrops were like meteorites landing on the pockmarked pavements of Manila when we braved two storms to catch the screening of Sunshine. Our tuktuk carried only three passengers: me, my partner, and another man—seven people short of the usual full ride as it had been a week of rain with flooding which meant classes and government work were cancelled. When it rained harder, our driver couldn’t help but mutter Tama na. Gutom na kami.It’s hunger borne out of poverty that limits, if not entirely removes, the access of ordinary Filipinos to watch important films such as Sunshine. Like any other works of art attempting to feature parts and parcels of Philippine society, etched on its tapestry is the signature Manila mayhem: masikip, mabaho, maingay and magulo.But the structure of the film is far from chaotic despite the complicated and challenging subject Direk Antoinette Jadaone took upon herself to flesh out. The stakes were high and indeed pushed the protagonist to do what she thought needs to be done. Her point was clear and warranted no further elaboration. Maris Racal was stellar in her portrayal of an aspiring Olympian who got pregnant at the blossoming of her career as a young athlete. The same can be said about the equally astounding young actress Annika Co who was a perfect foil to Racal’s character.The film, with its shorter than usual run time of barely an hour and a half minutes, didn’t hold back in driving its message, leaving nothing open for interpretation. Towards the end where Sunshine was performing her routine, I thought for a moment that her beaming towards the camera with her majestic ribbon would be the final shot of the film. But when the young Annika was shown watching Sunshine finish gracefully finishing her performance and embracing her when it ended, that was when I realized, gets ko na, that in this narrative, she would have a choice, one that's entirely her own.Direk Tonet has managed to make such a compact film about choice. While choice for women is such a privilege in a conservative country like ours, there’s something powerful in showing that Sunshine made a choice, one that goes against the conventional. While other films of the same topic would leave it to the audience to ponder whether or not the protagonist would choose the controversial choice, Sunshine showed us that yes, she did that!After the end credits have rolled, we were left staring at the black screen, perhaps, feeling fulfilled, weighed upon, or hungrier than ever for films of the same caliber. Sunshine is so monumental for Philippine cinema that it reaffirms one of my aspirations, that one day, Filipinos can have the choice about what films to watch in the cinema every weekend, not choose just either one—satisfying their physiological hunger or fulfilling the hunger of the soul.",-1

Sunshine,"perfectly articulated in the film ‘yung thoughts and feelings ng isang taong dala-dala ang pangarap hindi lang ng sarili pati na rin ng buong pamilya niya kapag nalaman nilang nagdadalang tao sila at a time na hindi sila handa. tulad nga ng sinabi ko sa partner ko, kung ano nararamdaman ni sunshine, gano’n at gano’n mararamdaman mo kapag babae ka. ang babae ‘di tulad ng lalaki na basta-basta lang makakawala sa gano’ng responsibilidad—mabigat siya, at nakakapagpabago talaga ng buhay. kakaiba ang sunshine. easily one of my most favorite films of all time.",6
Sunshine,"mabigat, nakakagalit, pero higit sa lahat, punong puno pa rin ng pag-asa. simple lang intindihin si sunshine hindi na kailangan ng matinding backstory para magets mo kung gaano siya kapursigido para sa pangarap niya, kahit sino naman siguro sa atin. nakakagalit dahil tao rin siyang binigo ng sistema. nakakainis na hanggang ngayon ay inaantay pa rin ng mga kababaihan ang araw na hahayaan tayong magpasya sa kung anong gusto nating gawin sa ating katawan. it’s our basic human right; bodily autonomy yet sobrang hirap ipaintindi sa mga hipokrito at konserbatibo. sobrang bigat sa pakiramdam na kakapit sa patalim ang mga babae para lamang magkaroon ng choice. choice na dapat malaya kaming pag-isipan at piliin. choice na hindi magiging kutya. choice na hindi namin ikakukulong. malayang pagpapasya. sa kabila ng sakit at galit sa sistema at sa ingay sa paligid niya, nanaig ang determinasyon ni sunshine. pinatunayan niyang hindi kailanman nakakabawas sa pagkababae ng isang tao ang pagpili.",3
Sunshine,"metro manila chaos, the good and the bad, and what the working class makes out of it, sunshine is about filipino womanhood and their grasp on bodily autonomy. pinaka naenjoy ko yung soundscapes into moments of silences that make the main character's stakes so much more hitting. god i love this film",12

Sunshine,"Can I just commend how great the cast’s performances were? Perhaps the best Filipino film of the year so far, and an important one at that.",9
Sunshine,"“GETS KO NA.”First things first, thank you Direk Antoinette Jadaone for being so brave. Our country badly needs films that dare to confront the cries and injustices our society (esp women) continue to face. Sunshine is a soft, aching plea for change. It’s a quiet but urgent cry for body autonomy, for choice, for justice. And it’s not just about one woman’s pain — it’s rooted in something deeper: a system that has long failed us, most esp women, in this country.",-1
Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine begins with control. With poise, with the perfect arabesque, and with the precision of a gymnast that is ready for the next move. But as the film moves along, the tension in the stillness builds up and begins to show. Behind the clean flow and rhythm of theribbon, the rehearsed elegance of the body is still pushed to their limit. Sunshine feels like a cruel misdirection, but the contrast is exactly the point that womanhood needs.In a country where abortion is still illegal without exceptions, Sunshine doesn’t just tell the story of a young woman’s crisis. It captures a quiet violence of expectation, the pressure to remain graceful even when they are under a system that does not allow women to fail, to choose, or even to speak freely. In the Philippines, the Revised Penal Code punishes abortion with imprisonment, while access to safe and legal procedures remains out of reach for most women, especially those who are young and unfortunate. Punishment because of abortion with imprisonment, and this legal stance is reinforced by deeply rooted religious conservatism. It is not just illegal—it is unthinkable. The stigma runs deep, and the silence surrounding it is even deeper.According to the Center for Reproductive Rights (2023), thousands of women are forced into this silence every year. Estimated around 1.1 million Filipino women induce abortion annually. About 1,000 of Filipinas die each year from abortion-related complications, and over 100,000are hospitalized due to unsafe procedures. These numbers are not just statistics, they are lives of the young, scared, and the unheard. Sunshine puts that reality front and center, but does so without shouting. It doesn’t force emotion, it lets it build naturally. This film follows Sunshine as she navigates through the aftermath of a missed period, a distracted boyfriend, and a society that offers no legal, safe, or accessible options. She’s left to carry the weight of a decision she didn’t choose, in a system that treats her body like public property.Sunshine (played by Maris Racal) is a kind character with stillness that feels like a resistance. Her performance is tight, contained, and filled with the kind of fear that is quiet and does not seek and beg for sympathy. A character with a facade that represents many generations of women where they mask all of their feelings and hold on to the thought that “this too shall pass”.She is not trying to explain herself, she is simply trying to breathe and move in a world that keeps on closing in. Racal does not rely on big breakdowns or dramatic lines. She holds her ground even when that ground is crumbling beneath her. Every look, every breath, feels calibrated. Like someone preparing for a landing they know they might not even survive. What makes the performance even more powerful is how familiar Sunshine feels. She is notwritten as an extraordinary character. She is a regular young woman, navigating school, relationships, and the uncertainty of early adulthood. She could be any girl from any province, any city, any university. That ordinariness is important. Because it reminds us that this story isnot rare. It is not fiction. It is the quiet, constant reality of so many young women in this country who are forced to navigate the consequences of a decision they didn’t even get to make.Jadaone doesn’t push for spectacle. The film sits with silence and discomfort. No overdramatization and overexplanation. Her braveness has a place in Philippine Cinema as this take and storytelling of hers about abortion in a world where systems and institutions are fallingshort, the quiet resistance of Sunshine speaks volume. Instead of turning the film into a message movie, Jadaone chooses to linger. She doesn’t try to solve anything. She doesn’t pretend that resolution is possible. And that’s what makes Sunshine hit even harder. The film doesn’t just show the problem, it lets us sit in it. It allows discomfort to stretch across the screen without rushing to ease it. That discomfort mirrors what many women feel in real life. The shame. The fear. The confusion. The silence that comes not from peace, but from pressure.It also explores the feelings through visuals. Pao Orendain, the Cinematographer of the film captures the feel of the City of Manila. How it is familiar inside the streets, but also how suffocating it is. The noise pollution that is made by the vehicles, the streets filled with conversations, and the trains rattling as it passes by. The way they captured it, Manila is just another place where it forces the characters to move carefully, just like any other people who lives, visits, and goes to Manila to reclaim life. The streets hum with life, but not always with warmth. The camera observes from a distance, never forcing perspective but always aware of the space Sunshine must navigate.What makes Sunshine stand out is that it never asks permission to tell this story. It does not frame abortion as a debate, or as an issue that needs to be justified. It centers the experience without apology. In doing so, it offers a kind of cinematic resistance that feels rare in Philippine cinema. Jadaone’s choice to tell this story without moralizing, without preaching, without forcing catharsis, gives it more weight than any dramatic scene ever could.And in a country that still debates whether women should have that right, Sunshine lands, not perfectly, but with all the force of someone who has had enough. Someone who knows she deserves more. And that is enough to shake the ground beneath her, even if no one else is watching. Like a gymnast mid-tumble, it shows how much strength it takes just to survive a fall.And sometimes, survival is the bravest routine of all.Gets na gets kita, Sunshine.",17
Sunshine,"This review features some spoilers.In local cinema, as with mainstream media, there’s a dearth of films tackling abortion. 12 Weeks, Anna Isabelle Matutina’s Cinemalaya feature debut, was the latest attempt I could recall, or at least one that had something useful to say. At the same time, a comprehensive sexuality education integrated at all education levels (separate from the education department’s sex ed order), as proposed in the anti-teenage pregnancy bill, has been under fire from the country’s conservative population.Into this frantic context emerges Sunshine, the latest indie darling from writer-director Antoinette Jadaone. The sole Philippine entry in the Centrepiece section of the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, the film finally comes home. It’s making its local premiere exclusively at SM cinemas, after touring the international film fest circuit to critical renown, including the Crystal Bear for Best Film at this year’s Berlin International Film Festival.But make no mistake, as the picture refuses to be singled out as an “abortion film,” a descriptor so sweeping and limiting that it is seen only vis-à-vis morality. Jadaone finds new ammo with which to make sense of the polarizing topic: gymnastics. (The film’s TIFF world premiere, in fact, came at the heels of gymnast Carlos Yulo’s double Olympic gold in Paris.)The sports drama unfolds through the title character, played by Maris Racal, a young gymnast whose preparation for national tryouts is upended after discovering she’s pregnant. Refusing to compromise her shot at Olympic glory, with her useless boyfriend (Elijah Canlas) almost instantly ditching her, Sunshine resorts to illegal abortifacients offered by Manila’s underbelly, where she runs into an enigmatic young girl (Annika Go) bent on tracking her every move and policing her every decision. Soon, she internalizes biblical shame.Sunshine follows Jadaone’s feminist inclinations. Her directorial debut Six Degrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay (2011), is a raw mockumentary that doubles as a compelling paean to the titular screen bit actress, whose name is nearly synonymous with Philippine horror but has largely remained underappreciated. In Never Not Love You (2018), Nadine Lustre’s Joanne is a breadwinner who trades a long-awaited job promotion in Manila for a fraught chance to begin anew and dream together with her privileged boyfriend in London, only to wrestle with the punishing economics of romance. Fan Girl (2020) explores the dark side of being a superfan through a female character who’s a proxy for the film’s articulation about the psychology of idle worship in a nation forever beholden to it.Shortcomings of these movies aside, Jadaone insists on narratives that do not treat and present the female gaze as though it’s self-explanatory. The director often edges toward gray areas and destabilizing standpoints, whether or not they wind up humorous, fascinating, schmaltzy, or troubling.Whereas Jadaone’s previous movies are attuned to the conventions of their respective genres, Sunshine offers something new to the director’s dramaturgical defaults. The film is an intersection of neorealism and magical realism. It trains the camera on Manila’s grime, decay, and nonstop noise, embracing its outcasts and harsh truths (the Lino Brocka comparisons are inevitable), just as it punctuates the gritty reality with a magical invocation via the imaginary friend that trails Sunshine.“Media literacy” would tell you that the spectral presence is a representation of the internal-external friction the heroine deals with; fetus in the flesh and the body that refuses to carry it; the back-and-forth between morality and pragmatism. (Jadaone, in an interview with Filmmaker Magazine, revealed she was inspired by the imaginary character in Taika Waititi’s 2019 satirical drama Jojo Rabbit.) But beyond this, the make-believe figure is a surrogate for the conservative, pro-life fraction of the audience, with the director opting to engage in the subject matter’s complexity instead of comfortably locating the film in an echo chamber. While the narrative device could prove as an apparent play at sympathy, indulging in a “will she, won’t she” kind of thinking (surface-level reading could also suggest that women seeking abortion are deluded, ridiculous as that implication might sound), it also offers access to the broader violence disguised as “conscience” that puts women, regardless of gender identities, at a disadvantage.If anything, Sunshine is less about the act of abortion itself than about the systems that encourage women to settle for dehumanizing rights already decided for them by a patriarchal few, systems that prohibit them from dreaming, and tell them that to dream only means more labor, nothing more.Sunshine, like Petersen Vargas’ Some Nights I Feel Like Walking (which made its Philippine premiere in June), harnesses the metropolis as a character of its own, instead of reducing it to a mere symbolic backdrop. Whereas Some Nights steeps its urban tale in neon erotica, completely absent of daylight, Sunshine shifts between the city’s diurnal and nocturnal environments.Pao Orendain’s camerawork here chiefly reaps magic from close-ups and interior shots, often framed from the window and dotted by a shaft of light (hence the Brocka sentiments), locating the viewer into the heroine’s intimate yet anxious state. The self-induced abortion scene in the sketchy motel, a sight casually interrupted by frantic railway noise, is particularly visceral that you can almost feel the texture of the image.The camera also draws focus to the irony that permeates Manila’s streets, particularly around the vicinity of Quiapo Church, where makeshift stalls selling figurines, scapulars, and all sorts of religious paraphernalia also offer abortion drugs and quack treatments, just as banners declaring “abortion is murder” remain a typical sighting. In other scenes where Sunshine traverses the cityscape, the visuals are more straightforward. Accompanying the images is a soundscape that immersively mirrors the congestion, exhaustion, and urban din that form part of the DNA of the country’s capital.Jadaone’s script nearly leans on the miserablist. When Sunshine finds an opportunity to pull herself out of the vexing situation, poverty immediately gets in the way, leaving her with no choice but to ask her boyfriend for a meager P5,000 to secure the abortion drug and a cheap motel room to perform the deed herself. Yet even in Manila’s hospitals, the conditions are dire; patients are forced to share beds, and hallways are turned into makeshift wards, crowded by people in need of attention beyond the medical. Rape and casual prostitution also get in the way, as in the case of Menggay (Rhed Bustamante), the pregnant 13-year-old Sunshine comes across in Quiapo.In a highlight moment, Sunshine, livid upon meeting her friend’s abuser, suddenly picks up a beer bottle and whacks it over the man’s head, before sprinting to escape the scene. (Curiously, Jadaone plumbs the politics of self-determination by contrasting Sunshine’s ability to decide for herself with Menggay’s distance from that very sense of agency.) Even the Quiapo vendors selling abortifacients, who some might think merely exploit the desperation of their customers, are also victims who simply don’t earn enough.Unflattering as these depictions are, it’s hard to deny that these aren’t routine realities in the social inferno that is the Philippines. Still, there is humor, whether in a scene that involves a knife interrupting a silly argument, or in another that sees a self-righteous doctor preaching the goodness of the divine.As Sunshine, Racal delivers a performance that would be a disservice to reduce to neat superlatives. It’s a physical portrayal that required the actor to undergo training with national gymnastics coaches for nearly a year. It’s a role that might put her in the center of another controversy after barely surviving the previous one. But just as Sunshine is asked to “drown out the noise” whenever she steps on the mat, Racal distills every layer and emotion into a character that’s simply life-like, almost free from the veil of performance-making. Jadaone once told me that her ideal lead performance is one that “is part of something bigger than herself.” There has not been a more worthy portrayal in local cinema this year.At the same time, the movie functions as a reintroduction to the boundless talent of Jennica Garcia, who plays Sunshine’s elder sister, a single mother trying to keep everything intact. Her portrayal expertly captures what a supporting performance should be—one that has enough screentime to be an emotional anchor for the lead but also generates her own moment. There’s a kind of invisible labor informing the character that Garcia encapsulates with an onscreen presence that always feels grounded and never incidental.Sunshine is hardly a social exposé. What ripples throughout this partly winding urban tale is a ready, fatal fact about the place of women in this eternally eroded nation that we’d rather dismiss as “controversial” or “divisive” because we refuse to listen. The film’s visuals might be artful, but they don’t always convey a pretty picture. It’s no coincidence that the movie’s narrative throughline is the community that Sunshine finds in the women around her: her elder sister, her best friend (Xyriel Manabat), despite her initial inhibitions, her coach (Meryll Soriano), the young Menggay, the compassionate doctor (Angeli Bayani), and even the imaginary friend. Though this sense of solidarity comes at varying degrees, it keeps Sunshine afloat and does not let her think of herself as a monster for terminating an unwanted pregnancy.Once Sunshine nears its final shot, I keep thinking of Fan Girl’s insular ending that succeeds its heroine’s already exhausting journey. I’m glad to learn that our heroine this time does not succumb to sheer epiphany. Here, hope actually feels like a tangible possibility instead of an unwarranted emotional wallop.Sunshine is perhaps not Jadaone’s most definitive work; That Thing Called Tadhana (2014) or Never Not Love You might claim that distinction. But it is her sharpest creation yet. It took a whole lot of research and lived experiences to put this story on the screen. It took a bit of time for the film to make its way back to where it started. It’s a miracle that it even got the go signal to be screened publicly. I can already sense all the hot takes and thinkpieces it will generate. And I can only hope that it will be as meaningful as this.This review appears on PhilSTAR Life in a slightly different version.",5
Sunshine,maris i have never doubted you !!!!!!!! also need to see jennica garcia in a lead role,10
Sunshine,"Last year, I saw High School Scandal. Both films share the same throughline that Philippine health care sucks when it comes to pregnancy and sex education. High School Scandal was made in the 80s. The difference being is that Sunshine made me feel hopeful, while High School Scandal made me feel depressed.Here's the thing. Sunshine is a very heavy film, but what makes Sunshine such a heartlifting film to watch is that she had the proper support system whether she decides to keep the child or not. She gets to choose if she wants to carry the baby or not. She has a sister that cares about her well being, a best friend who will do everything for her, and strangely enough, a manifestation of what her child will be. The film shows that women should at the end of the day, have the final choice in matters related to childbirth.Oh and with heavy topic such as this, let women be the major voice in the storytelling. Maris Racal is a powerhouse actress. Antoinette Jadoane is a great writer and director and deserves all the praise in handling such a tough topic.",12

Sunshine,"very tearjerker sya ma!!!ANYWAY ang galing ni maris huhu commendable acting also from rhed bustamante sobrang cry talaga ako sa scenes nya  i love how direk tonet emphasized na not all teenage pregnancies ay dahil sa raging hormones at lack of education nila, but that they also exist because they were raped, no less than by their relatives!!! kaya sobrang importante ang pelikulang to para isulong na madecriminalize ang abortion also!!! loveee ung scene nung kinakausap si sunshine ng doktor after unang attempt niya, hindi natin maikakaila talaga na no matter how educated a person is, minsan talaga hindi umuusad ung mga belief nila sa mga comtroversial na bagay. kaya shoutout kay jennica garcia nung binara nya si doc ang galing nya don maaa",3
Sunshine,"“Gets ko na.”In this film, we follow Sunshine, a rhythmic gymnast and an Olympic hopeful, as she travels through Manila’s dark, narrow, grimy, and crowded streets and alleys in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy in a country where abortion is illegal. There are few parts of this film that really stood out to me because they made elevated the movie and made it more compelling.The first part that I really liked is how the city became a living representation of this country’s oppressive stance against anything pro-abortion. The city allowed us to have something tangible, to be able to relate to Sunshine’s struggles even more. Second, the magical realism aspect is also a highlight for me. Once it finally clicked what Ariana and Annika Co’s characters represented, I was blown away. One common argument of those against abortion is that you are going to kill someone who’s probably gonna be a very important person. And yet, we get Annika Co’s character. Through a very powerful performance we end up caring for this kid. But once you start to realize who she us and who she represents, you start to realize that she’s not just an extension of Sunshine but a representative of all babies born to mothers forced to carry a child. She and these babies are vessels forced to carry the unfulfilled dreams of their mothers. She said something like, “Ang pangarap niya ay ang pangarap ko.” And that line broke me. The argument is always, “We are not fulfilling someone’s potential if we abort them.” but there’s always a failure to acknowledge that forcing someone to bear a child is also not allowing them to fulfill their potential.The last part that stood out to me is Maris Racal’s great performance. She is the movie. Without that performance, this film will fall apart and she delivers. What this film did is humanize a debate that’s usually so contentious it ends up being too one dimensional. It made the debate more accessible to every one. The movie is unflinching and raw. A harsh criticism of a society and culture who despite being always proud of their women, continues to fail them by continuing to enabling oppressive systems that mostly targets women. A big middle finger to a society that still strongly reeks of misogyny. It also an exploration of the country’s broken healthcare system. This film is a celebration of female friendships and sisterhood. The people who helped Sunshine in her journey are women. It forces you to be uncomfortable. It forces you to think and have empathy. This film is highly relevant and should be a required watching for everyone. Probably one of the most important Filipino films ever made. Hope it gets an even wider release.",-1

Sunshine,"A narrative that explores personal choices and bodily autonomy against the backdrop of a deeply conservative Philippine culture. Sidenote. I like how the film draws an ironic parallel between the fate of Rhed Bustamante’s character and Sunshine’s, especially regarding their situations, available support, resources, and freedom to choose.”: Cinema 1, SM Mall of Asia",12
Sunshine,"we meet sunshine through her battle of being an olympian. armored by her well-worn asian games shirt and her head held high, she shines the brightest among her peers who also look up to her and what more she can become. her coach knows this too, along with her family and lifelong friend, who would all do everything to make sure she achieves them.perhaps its in the nuance of a story that is deeply feminist and human, but antoinette's jadaone's sunshine is the strongest in its ability to capture the realities of adolescent pregnancy with both gentleness and fierce. portraying (albeit sometimes preaching about, but deservingly so) the world of a filipina girl navigating the weight of expectations and the silence surrounding sexual and reproductive health, the story unfolds as a reflection of what we lack and suffer from. this flaw persists in the lesson of consent that was never taught, contraception never offered, the judgment of clinical service providers, the terrifying possibility of dying alone, and the unbearable strength it takes to push forward anyway, not because you’re fearless, but because you must. as a youth. as a woman. as a human with dreams and rights.the reality today is rough: the philippine government failed to pass its version of the adolescent pregnancy prevention bill in the recent senate, the current curriculum and implementation of the comprehensive sexuality education is in question, and more and more right-wing (ish) groups are mobilizing their funds to hinder the fight even more. but hopefully, with these kind of films made accessible to the public, we will be reminded that abortion happens not just because teenagers are risky or that they have been abuse hence it's justified, but because they have the right to decide for themselves.after all, sunshine's every step and every twirl, carries not just her own hope, but the collective dreams of those who raised her, and fought for her to have this. and in watching her take the mat, we are reminded of every girl who dreams of olympic gold, of becoming president, of curing AIDS, and how urgent it is that we believe in them first before some blob of blood. that we talk to them about things that matter. that we care.because when we do, they shine.",17

Sunshine,"A film full of images of ironies: The jeepney with God’s Gift sign, the abortifacients sold next to religious figures, sunshine being named one when her life seemed to be dark, and words of encouragement that made the burden heavier. In a country that is driven by morals, Sunshine begs to question and reassess our morales. What is moral? What is acceptable? Are we accountable? Aside from ourselves, who are accountable?Strong performances and storytelling, Jadaone and Racal hits a homerun.",20
Sunshine,"In a country where abortion remains criminalized, Sunshine is both a risk and a revelation. It speaks directly to the young women whose stories are erased, stigmatized, or left in the shadows. It exposes the hypocrisy of a system that forces women to choose between their futures and their autonomy, between silence and survival.This film does not simply ask whether abortion is right or wrong, it asks us why we’ve made it so dangerous to even ask the question.Decriminalize abortion now!!!!!!!",-1
Sunshine,"Time and time again watching films and sharing my appreciation for the art form always felt one-dimensional. But there was a gut feeling that Sunshine was gonna be different.Watching this with my religious mom, laughing through the hypocrisies of it all and finally tearing up toward its third act felt intriguing. As we walked down to a nearby coffee shop, she shared her miscarriage story; she was just as scared as Sunshine, a story on what-ifs and what could’ve been, a thought they both pondered on.This time my mom didn’t.She went for her thirdAnd gave birth to whomshe’s sharing the story to.The comparisons with Brocka aren’t an exaggeration. Sunshine is arguably direk Tonet’s best and most important piece, bar none.Watch in theaters while it’s out.",20

Applause din for Annika for being a very great addition to the story. Kakaiba din talaga yung paghabi ng istorya dito hindi ko inexpect yung simbolismo niya. Honestly, this is such a strong ensemble as they really made you feel every single emotion that is being evoked in every scene. Idk if mabilis lang ako umiyak pero grabe tulo ng luha ko sa pelikulang ito.Kudos to Direk Tonet for being brave to tackle topics like this.

Sunshine,"Sunshine was... something. A brave film that dives deep into choices and morals. It also sheds light on the realities of healthcare. As one fellow moviegoer said, we’ve probably met a “Sunshine” at some point. Maybe a friend, a neighbor, a classmate, or even someone you just passed by. And “Sunshine” reminds us that women are the light and fire that keep things going. P.S. Got to meet Direk Tonet for a quick debrief and Q&A right after the screening! Of course I grabbed the chance to take a photo with her haha (hello na rin sa mga ka-eme!)",20
Sunshine,not the point but i would kill to have an ate ,1
Sunshine,"short: na-motivate ako mag cardio para i can also wreck cars and hit pigs in the head and run away. long: what the film has perfectly executed are the harshest and best parts of Manila, strangers, families, and friends. You could see that sometimes the ‘worst’ places are where you could see empathy and kindness—from motel/inn keepers, faith healers, and potions sellers, albeit pseudo-empathy. You could see that not all doctors have compassion. And that you could not always rely…",-1
Sunshine,"More than abortion, Sunshine is a film about a girl with a dream and passion - and her journey to get there. This film is emphatetic. It makes you feel, and incites you to think. I hope every woman in the world (especially in the Philippines) would have a Geleen (Jennica’s character) in their lives - a kakampi, in a world that dictates what women should do, a world where there’s always black & white. “Kahit anong desisyon mo, kahit anong mangyari - kakampi mo ‘ko”",-1

Sunshine,"sobrang totoo at #danas yung pagganap ng mga aktor at lente ni jadaone rito. lapat sa reyalidad ng pagiging babaeng pilipinong maralita yung pelikula at pinaka nagustuhan ko na hindi lang ito nagmitsa ng simula ng diskurso tungkol sa reproductive health ng kababaihan at usapin ng legalidad at moralidad ng aborsyon sa bansa, tumindig ito— sa katauhan ng bata, ni menggay, ni dra. helen, ni geleen, at ni sunshine.para sa'kin, doon mo lang makikita yung pananda na nagtagumpay yung layunin ng ganitong uri ng pelukula e. hindi sapat na ibato mo lang yung tanong o ilatag sa mga manonood yung hamon na bumoses sa isyung tikom ang karamihan. gustong gusto ko na sa huli, pinili ni sunshine yung pangarap niya at nang maabot niya yung buo at perpektong routine para sa qualifiers, tahimik at walang script yung eksena pero doon ko pinaka rinig na rinig yung puso ni niya. takot, ngunit buo ang loob, at napaka tapang ni sunshine hanggang sa huling segundo ng pelikula. para sa'kin, sobrang halaga na ipakita kung gaano kalaking bahagi ng buhay ng kababaihan yung nakasugal sa tuwing nalalagay sa panganib ng unwanted pregnancy. at yung suporta mula, unang una, sa pamilya, at higit, mula sa gobyerno— upang matamasa ng mga menggay at sunshine ng bansa yung kaligtasan at pagkakataon na mabuhay nang para sa sarili at pangarap—ay hindi dapat ipanawagan kundi ipagkaloob nang kusa at maging mandato.kitang kita ko yung paglago ni maris racal bilang aktor dito. iba rin ang kinang ni jennica garcia at annica co, sobrang deserve na makita pa sa mas maraming proyekto.",3
Sunshine,"A film dedicated for the Philippine women and their reproductive rights, a raw and realistic storytelling of what a pregnant teenager is going through. Some scenes were insignificant and I perceive it as pointless with what the film is trying to convey, but I think that these were necessary since it's not just Sunshine's world that was shown in the whole duration. Through this film, it dauntlessly opened up the existing act of incest in our country. I was initially…",-1
Sunshine,"Uhhh... medyo weird lang, mas okay sana kung wala na lang yung imaginary child... wala namang magandang ambag parang pinalabas mo na rin na murder nga ang pag-abort. Ang counterproductive lang",0
Sunshine,a very well-made film regarding the struggles of women’s reproductive health in the Philippines especially with the context of religion and culture. Ioved the subtext of women supporting women even with however little they have (fave depiction of this was the 2nd hospital ward scene). having a physical representation of the characters’ conscience was also very interesting since it provided insights on the internal struggles sunshine was experiencing. beautiful cinematography and color grading. stellar performances from the cast. vfx…,26
Sunshine,"this is, by far, the best film of Direk Antoinette Jadaone. i just hope this film gets the exposure it deserves. ily, sunshine. ",-1
Sunshine,What I liked about the film is the liberty of the viewer to pick their own stand on the issue at hand with them laying out how the character arrived on the decision she chose for herself. Worth a second watch or even more.,-1

Sunshine,"“drown out the noise”and yet, no matter how hard Sunshine tries to ignore these noises, what she endures is a different kind of restraint, pain, and mess—the kind she can’t forcibly silence, even if she tries.hindi ako babae, pero gets ko si Sunshine. it’s been so long since a film has impacted and triggered something in me. to a point where a line gets stuck in your head. kumbaga sa kanta, na-lss ako sa linyang ‘to ni Coach Eden.without a doubt, Sunshine holds a special place in my heart. maybe it’s because of how timely and relevant its message is, or because of Maris Racal’s powerful performance, or how it portrays the real noise and mess of Manila. i don’t know. but, what i do know is that i am deeply in love with this film, and i’ll never get tired of talking about it. imagine, from the moment i first saw the trailer last year, to the moment i’m writing this review, i’ve loved sunshine. i’ve loved all the people in charge of making it. and i’ve loved Direk Tonet even more.Ang Husay Husay Husay.",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is a victim of her poor choice. She is a victim to the patriarchal system of the country. It perfectly encapsulates the intersectionality of being impoverished and a woman in the predominantly catholic setting. It is a bold statement to the cruel realities women face, especially the ones at the bottom. She is caged by the system. Jadaone has given justice in telling the plight women face.Sunshine’s character is imperfect and flawed, but real which makes you root for her character. This was emphasized by the camerawork which maintains a certain intimacy with the character that makes you see Sunshine’s vulnerability. Racal portrayal of Sunshine makes you want to empathize with the character because amidst of all the imperfections, there is this young dreamer. Her poor decisions are the consequence of the society she exists in, wherein there is no other choice— leaving her to opt for desperate methods.This film is so personal bilang isang babae.",20
Sunshine,"galing mo, maris",1
Sunshine,"Mama, ang bigat! Kaso naiihi na ung kapatid ko kaya nagmamadali kaming lumabas sa sinehan right after ending. Nakakatawa kasi habang naglalakad palabas, tumutulo pa rin luha ko. Iyak-inis-tawa na lang ako dahil di man lang ako binigyan ng kapatid ko ng time ma-process ang mga pangyayari.Anyway… ganon sya. Kailangan i-proces. Kailangang upuan at pag-usapan. Pakiramdam na gusto kong yakapin si Sunshine. Gusto ko syang damayan. Babae sa babae. Na-appreciate kong babae rin ang pinaka-makakaunawa sa babae. Aaaah! Gusto ko pa ring umiyak.",3
Sunshine,Will add review later haha,1

Sunshine,damn right Maris,10
Sunshine,"Wow. Galing. Pinagisipan. It reminds me, yet again, of the society we live in. In this film, just like any other woman, Sunshine is a sunshine of her own—a woman with dreams, goals and stories to tell. A story that is too scary to talk, yet need to be heard and seen. I hope this film will not just become a story of its own, but a way for us to be strong enough to discuss these kinds of issues.",20
Sunshine,"Sunshine Is Every Woman Who Dreams Beyond Her CircumstancesSunshine was not created for the sake of making a statement, nor just triggering a conversation; it was meant to make people feel and understand why abortion happens and how our current system makes them dangerous for women. Sunshine did not need to be pitied or root for, she needed to be understood.The film opens and immediately solidifies Sunshine’s ambition. It is anchored on Sunshine’s eagerness to excel, to achieve, to succeed, to be the best, to be an Olympian. And this ambition is not going anywhere. With every tiptoe that Sunshine stands on—as she throws her pink ribbons and gives in to impulse—she stands tall again, catching the ribbons as if they were always meant to fall in the right places… until they don't. Sunshine’s perfect harmony gets disturbed by her sudden realization that she is pregnant. Antoinette Jadaone’s intentional direction on making some scenes too loud, too chaotic, and far too overwhelming added to the personification of Sunshine’s mind; scrambling, panicking, terrored. It was not just Quiapo’s busy streets, it was also Sunshine’s trembling heart. But in between the anxiety and fear, Sunshine gathers the courage to try making a choice—even amidst the confusion. Sunshine finds out in the harshest way possible that a choice is not an option. She is put in a situation where the only way out is to give in to ‘sinful’ acts, dangerous pills, and death-defying abortion attempts. For a young teenager whose dreams seem too far from where she is, this is the only way. While many expect this decision to become the climax of the movie, Sunshine’s story is far from over. In my understanding, the film explored her conscience through Annika Co’s beautifully done character. It reminded the audience that while women consent to abortion, they are still carrying its moral burden. Annika’s character became an instrument to make women who seek abortion feel human, with human conscience and sensibilities. But it was done with such care, careful enough not to make it counterproductive but rather stuck in the ideology of the system that she grew up in.However, Annika’s character is only a personification of Sunshine’s chaotic mind, making Sunshine her own companion to her dawning journey. This character becomes Sunshine’s comfort in the dangers of her abortion attempts, showing the deeply awful and tragic realities many women face; alone in rotting walls of the city, drowning out the noise, and daring to dream bigger than the spaces they are subjected in.But what makes this movie even more special is that it did not let Sunshine go through it alone. While the movie was an avenue for telling the reality, it also became a source of hope for many women, especially for young ones who will watch it. There will be other women supporting them in their decision, other women who will not judge them for their choices, and other women who will create a safe space for them—at least in ways that they can, in the rotting system we have. Finally, Sunshine does not just urge the system to give women the rights to their own body; it explicitly explains what women go through in the struggles that we speak of. It does not undermine the calls for a systemic change, but it brings you the stories behind why a choice is necessary. It opens you to a narrative that does not just agree to progressive actions, but puts the heart in it. And in between those narratives, the movie reminds us that women are more, that they deserve to take up more space. Women are dreamers, they have ambition, they are complex, cohesive, and compassionate. Women are more than their mistakes, their stories go beyond. And that is the essence of a choice; to let them dream. To free them from the shackles of an already oppressing society. To not dim their light and let them shine, like Sunshine herself.To all the Sunshines out there, you are not alone. Be steadfast on your ambition and dare to dream big. And you take up space even bigger.",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is a brave and powerful film—one that confronts a deeply taboo subject with grace, nuance, and emotional weight, especially within the context of the Philippines’ heavily religious culture. Tonet Jadaone doesn’t pull punches, but she doesn’t sensationalize either. It’s an honest, grounded portrayal of something often swept under the rug.Maris Racal shines in a career-defining performance—raw, vulnerable, and fully committed. This isn’t an easy watch, but it’s a necessary one. And for those who stay with it, it’s deeply rewarding.Easily one of the best local films I’ve seen this year.",-1

Sunshine,the choice is indeed a heavy one. every woman should have this choice and be given avenues for safe procedures and they should be protected by the law,7
Sunshine,"In many known movies, abortion is commonly narrated as a quest with so much comedic acts, plus some forced shallow arguments to inject drama.But for Sunshine — How the movie depicted purchasing a pregnancy test kit in the Philippines = an act to get humiliated. Sunshine, a teenage Filipina athlete forged to be an Olympian who had an unwanted pregnancy, was the sacrificial being for a story to be told.Sunshine happened in the Philippines, where access to reproductive health services is way harder to have compared to other countries, like in the US and Europe. The country has been enclosed with regressive conservatism, causing talks about sex to still be taboos. Abortion is still illegal as well. The movie happened right smack in the heart of Manila City — Quiapo. It is an area known for a well-known Catholic Church and the surrounding kubols or booths of herbal medicines and potions for all uses — from seducing someone, cursing someone, to inducing abortion (or in Filipino, “pampawala ng kapit ng bata.”) The story, its darkness, and some women’s resort to the said harmful options would not have happened if only proper education and healthcare are available, to be honest.Sunshine was very telling of the struggles of Filipinas. But I think it’s globally reflective as well because it told the following things:1.) Unfair treatment on female athletes: Remember Venus Williams’ pregnancy? She almost died after giving birth, and she was kicked out of the top ranks because she cannot play during recovery. The WNBA players? They just wore shirts last All-Star weekend saying “Pay Us What You Owe Us.” And here, Sunshine, an aspiring Olympian, unintentionally risking her passion and potential bread and butter just because proper help is nowhere in sight.2.) Violence against women and children: Catcalling, predatory stares, and rape were parts of this movie. The movie did as much as it could to raise awareness that these actions are still apparent and are unfortunate enablers of all things that went downhill for the female characters. Sunshine mirrored reality, especially for us, Filipinas. I hate writing that sentence, but, it’s the truth. ————————Technical items I liked:• Rico Blanco’s Challengers-esque film score! The music was so immersive. • Rhetorical characters (which are pretty difficult to execute and usually come out as trying-hard, but they weren’t)• Piolo Pascual and his presence. The audience just gasped as soon as he entered the frame!• Most of all — Maris Racal. Her future is so bright. Pain, so much pain, was expressed by her character. And she did more than enough that the audience would want to stop whatever’s causing her agony.• Gusto Ko Sakin Ka Lang is a banger in a tugstugs jeep ↕If you’re in the Philippines, watch this in any SM Cinema. If you’re outside the Philippines, watch out for more future film festivals. Sunshine has been shown in the Toronto International Film Festival, Berlin International Film Festival, Palm Springs International Film Festival, and many more.",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is more than a film about a teenage gymnast reaching for her olympic dreams. it reflects the struggles, hopes, and quiet battles of countless young girls trying to find light in a world that often dims their shine. Sunshine isn’t just an athlete wearing an asian games shirt holding a pink crane—she is a woman, a sister, a student, a friend, and someone younger girls look up to. set in the noisy, smoggy, and congested streets of Manila, the film doesn’t shy away from the uncomfortable realities many Filipino girls face: teenage pregnancy, poverty, lack of access to healthcare and education, judgment from professionals, and the systemic neglect of women’s rights. it's not just Sunshine's story—it’s the story of so many young women who are silenced, dismissed, and left to figure things out on their own. Antoinette Jadaone once again directed a story that is not meant to be questioned, but understood. it's in movies like this that we uncomfortably see how and why women resort to abortion-simply because they are forced by circumstances. pregnant teens do not need to be told how reckless they were; they already know it, and they're already bearing the consequences of their actions. what they actually need is someone they can seek help from, someone who can give them the support they need.lest we forget it's the government that continuously denies women their right to a safe society free from the shackles of abuse and neglect.Maris Racal, you are one hell of an artist—and seeing you and Jennica Garcia in an Antoinette Jadaone film was something i didn't know i needed.",17
Sunshine,"another breathtaking film from direk tonet... the love and care put into the creation of this film truly pours out of the screen with every sequence.i enjoyed the way it lulls you into a false sense of security with how it makes you think that you know where this is going–before it completely flips your world upside down by the end of the second act. such clever and gripping storytelling and honestly, i expected nothing less from its director :')it's the subtle illustration of solidarity between women that really brought it home for me. it's what made my heart ache the most too. so glad i got to catch this in the cinema, it's definitely one for the books",-1

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine starts strong and hits hard. Maris Racal kills it (debatable lol) as a gymnast chasing the Olympics, only to find out she’s knocked up. Next thing you know, she’s in Quiapo buying abortion pills tucked between Santo Niño statues. Literal na religious trauma meets reproductive rights. Sunshine’s haunted—literally—by a bata na obvious namang it’s her unborn child or either manifestation ng internalized Catholic guilt. But damn, it works. Jennica Garcia shows up as her ate and low-key steals…",-1

Sunshine,"isa ito sa mga halimbawa ng mga lokal na pelikula na masarap suportahan kasi alam mong may gustong iparating, ipadama, at sabihin.habang pinapanood ko, inaasahan ko na kung anong mga susunod na mangyayari pero mas nakakainis at nakakagalit kung iisipin na alam na natin yung mangyayari pero wala pa rin tayong nagagawa sa mga bagay na pinabayaan nalang maging “normal” kahit hindi dapat.masakit sa puso panoorin bilang babae pero mas masakit sa pakiramdam pagkatapos manood. mapapaisip at mapapaisip ka. ang hirap kapag wala kang magawa kasi wala kang kapangyarihan.pero yung mga ganitong palabas ang isa sa mga dahilan kaya nabibigyan ng boses yung mga ganitong isyu sa lipunan.direk tonet, maraming salamat!!!magpatuloy ka lang.ika nga ni sunshine, “gets ko na.”medyo parang bitin lalo na nung hindi nagpunta kay doc helena (pero sabi ni direk hindi pala sinama sa final cut haha mas maganda siguro kung naisali, pero gets naman)",3

Sunshine,"SUNSHINE: THE REVOLUTION!Lost for words after watching tbh, like fr!!Usa sa ni tatak jud nako ani na film kay ang thought na I HAVE NEVER, AS IN NEVER SEEN MS. MERYLL SORIANO THIS RAW, LOUD AND CLEAR EVEN WITH NO-ACTING ACTING STYLE WITH POIGNANT ROLE AS SEEN IN THIS MOVIE. Grabeee, kuhang kuha kaayo niya ang no-acting acting na pinakagusto nako with independent films. If wala lang jud ko kaila niya, i could say na siya gyud ang trainer ni Sunshine like ana siya kamaayo na wala nako nakita iyaang pagka Mama Meme or any other characters she portrayed but THE COACH OF SUNSHINE. Hands up Ms. Meryll! Inay Maria must be proud of you! I hope you'll bag an acting award on this film, you deserve it!Second, gets man na nakafocus pud ang ending sa role ni Ms. Jennica Garcia cause siya nga lang naman nagtiwala at nakakaintindi kay Sunshine, but I would have love to see the change of tone on Ms. Meryll Soriano's character (kulang po yung exposure emz) — she has been one of the dynamic characters in this film and I want to see her sa ending more, now that Sunshine has done what she really loves to do, and parte rin naman siya ng success ni Sunshine. She, in the first place, confronted Sunshine about the ""rumors"" but in the end, in her quiet strength, sinuportahan man pud niya.Third, TAYO ANG CHARACTER NI ANNIKA CO. Ang character ni Annika Co reminds me of the character ni Joven sa Goyo: Batang Heneral. Annika Co doesn't just represent ""Sunshine's child"", she represents how Pinoy see and interpret in their own narratives ang mga personal decisions ni Sunshine. Kumbaga ing-ana ang most judgments sa mga tawo sa mga personal decisions ni Sunshine. She was taken lightly kay ang character naglalaro thru a child actor pero katong part sa falling action na ni ana si Annika ug ""ngayon gets ko na..."" with full of love and a hint of conviction. That's the cue, mao na ang gusto ni Sunshine mahitabo sa nation na magets siya na women should always have the right with their bodies, and what to do with their bodies. I was ugly crying sa whole falling action-resolution because of that freaking satisfaction makita sa nawong ni Sunshine while gracefully performing sa iyaang practice. Ing-ana ang gusto nato makita sa mga babaye if they choose themselves and could become as selfish as these men or even more. Basta gahilak rako ani na part kay heartfelt kaayo ang whole scene with Annika plus giatay dalang dala kaayo ko sa musical scoring ani na scene even without dialogues, just pure execution.Andami ko pang gustong sabihin, but mao ra sa ni ang nitatak sa ako while watching.This is not just a reflection of what's happening sa mga kababaihan, cause this is also a call for action na kailangan na mulihok ang mga lawmakers na ma-Decriminalize ang Abortion sa Pinas to give chance to all women who are not ready to become mothers kasi may mga pangarap pa na mas dapat unahin. Let women be selfish for once. Hindi lahat pwede maging ina; hindi lahat gustong maging isang ina.",6

Sunshine,It only takes empathy and kindness to understand. This film gives me hope that one day women won't have to feel so alone in this cruel world. I long for the day that stories like Sunshine won't have to be so out of reach at hindi lang sana ito maging pangarap lamang.,-1
Sunshine,"someone seated next to me remarked to their companion, “di man lang natin nakita kung na-keep yung baby” perhaps that's precisely jadaone's point: she avoids depicting the obvious while still overtly tackling the pressing issues at eto ang bulok na healthcare system para sa mga babae. and she did so brilliantly. some scenes, particularly the ob-gyn’s ""thank you God"" moment, felt a bit preachy. for comedic effect ba yun? kasi nagtawanan yung audience lol for me sapat na yung amang pastor ni miggy if they wanted to inject a religious aspect to the issue. also isa sa mga script consultant pala si richard bolisay haha",35

Sunshine,"In a deeply religious country, I understand why Director Jadaone found it necessary to use symbolism through the characters of the child and Ariana in order to present the film Sunshine in a way that would allow it to be shown and appreciated by a wider Filipino audience.",-1
Sunshine,Gets ko na.A brave yet genuine film that tackles a lot of social issues in the Philippines. The depiction of the Manila slums and the protagonist’s struggles make this movie impactful. Being a woman in this country is another level of challenge that this movie accurately showed.I love you so much direk Tonet and Maris!,-1
Sunshine,"The film conveys a strong message and opens discussion on a pressing (yet not widely discussed) issue in the Philippines: teenage pregnancy.There were scenes that made me cry, but that’s because it’s where it really makes me empathize with Sunshine. I felt so many emotions while watching. I felt anger, felt the unfairness of society to women, felt the remaining hope and rooted for Sunshine. I loved the cinematography and the score, especially when Sunshine locks in for performance. Maris Racal and Jennica Garcia were powerful on screen together and individually. Maris does not just play Sunshine. Maris is Sunshine. I love that for her.",-1

Sunshine,Ang tapang nung mas pinili ni Sunshine ang mga pangarap niya over sa anak niya in this religious country. Pero at the same time nakakagalit na ang hirap talaga maging babae dito.

Sunshine,"Jennica Garcia, best supporting actress! Grabe. Iyaq na naman si ako, naalala ko na naman iyong “Sunshiiine” nya. Grabe. Andame kong thoughts sa movie! I can’t! Direk Tonet, kung nababasa mo to, yis galeng tai nah!!!! Woooooooh!!!!!!ADDENDUM CHAR (i just can’t stop thinking about this movie after like a week) Sunshine is a story of hope entangled in reality’s shadow.I’ve seen this film before—many times. As a student, learning the theoretical aspects of medicine. As an intern, having actual encounters through interviews with women like Sunshine. And as a practicing physician, who trained to become an OB-GYN, completing many incomplete miscarriages—induced or not—removing what’s left of what we call products of conception. Sometimes people call it products of misconception when they’re trying to be funny.This movie didn’t just slap us with the sensitive issue of abortion. It dissected so many layers of issues we need to talk about more often—and pondering them in reality is a mental and moral gymnastics at play.I would love to discuss all of them one by one, but this is a movie review after all, not an essay on the dangers of lacking a solid law to protect our young women from the societal pressures of patriarchy and religion—pressures that push them into life-threatening situations, only to be blamed for doing something they had no real choice about. In short, fuck the system.It’s always been a mental gymnastics for me to decide how to approach situations like this. And this movie is telling me exactly how. Jennica Garcia’s character deeply resonated with me—from the way she calls Sunshine’s name so tenderly, to the way she assures her that she’ll be there no matter what. She reminds us that we all need at least one ate around us who looks after us despite everything. (She literally said, shouted even, BE KIND!)Another character who lingered in my mind was the 14-year-old teenage mother. Shoutout to the team for dressing her in something colorful—a subtle clue to her identity, only revealed later. She was one small character representing thousands of teenage mothers, who are becoming younger as the years go by. She also represented the vulnerable group prone to sexual abuse—the group we have somehow failed to protect.I’d love to dissect each of the characters, but I’ll leave that to you. Instead, I’ll talk about Sunshine (last na, promise). Maris Racal’s portrayal was a masterclass in character acting. Sunshine is a fearless dreamer, full of dedication and passion to make that dream come true. She perseveres despite her family’s circumstances. She’s also a believer, kind, and someone who truly cares. You see it in the small things—like the way she makes the sign of the cross before her performance, or when she prays fervently in Quiapo Church to ask for guidance or forgiveness on the thing she’s about to do or not to do. And that’s the beauty of this film—it tells you so many things without saying so much. It urges its viewers to talk about them because these are urgent matters. Maybe we’re still far from legalizing abortion, but this movie isn’t just about that. It’s telling us we have so many other issues to tackle.In short, we need to protect the Sunshines—or this world will become darker than it already is.",-1
Sunshine,sobrang oa na naiyak ako feeling ko may kipay din ako,0
Sunshine,"I’m fairly easy to please when it comes to films. Give me a solid plot, a bit of laughter, a love story I can root for, and a strong ensemble, and I’m happy. Sunshine delivers all of these, but more importantly, it delivers a quiet, aching kind of truth. The trailer already sets up the premise: an aspiring Olympic gymnast finds herself two months away from the qualifiers, and pregnant. What unfolds is not a cautionary tale, but a necessary, grounded story about the private cost of dreams and the impossible decisions women are often forced to make.This is not a conventional film. At several moments, I found myself crying with Sunshine—because I know there are many women like her. Women who have been in the same position, or still are. In a country where laws continue to deny women the right to make choices about their own bodies, Sunshine handles its subject matter with a kind of restraint and realism that does not demand pity, but insists on empathy. Even if you haven’t experienced what she has, you feel it—because you are human, and perhaps more deeply, because you are a woman. When the credits rolled, it took a while before anyone in the cinema, including myself to get up and leave. There was a heaviness in the room. Everyone sat in silence, letting the weight of the film settle in.Some have described the film as Brocka-esque, and I find that comparison apt. This is Tonette Jadaone’s most powerful work to date. A film that is necessary, timely, and deserving of all our support. I hope more people watch Sunshine and understand this side of womanhood, one that is constantly sidelined in the name of morality and ethics. There is truth, and power, in giving women the right to choose. In letting them take ownership of their own bodies. Always.",17

Sunshine,"In 50 years, people will talk about Sunshine in the same breath as Lino Brocka’s, Ishmael Bernal’s, and Marilou Diaz-Abaya’s works. It’s a modern classic - rich in details and symbolism, but sparse and no-nonsense in its storytelling. Perhaps Direk Tonet’s best work to date!Those tight, gray shots of Maris wandering around gritty Quiapo streets must really what it’s like to feel so choked, so condemned by a society that’s unwilling to let a woman maker her own choices. Props also to Jennica Garcia - proof that no role is ever too small for great actors!",-1

Sunshine,"As a Filipino woman, this movie hits so close to home. So many moments in this movie that made me realize that I might have been too jaded to comprehend just how common unwanted and taboo pregnancies are. I feel a sense of pride over the protagonist’s choices, for being “kontra-agos” in a society and industry that perpetuates ownership over a woman’s body and future. Maris shined, but Jennica Garcia’s performance as the firm yet nurturing older sister really stuck with me. Lastly, this movie brought to light just how much we need progressive reproductive health policies in the country, and just how much we have to fight for it. I would have wished for the movie to be straightforward about what happened after Maris’ decision, but there’s a certain charm about it being sort of open-ended.",13

Sunshine,"There’s a quiet power in Sunshine, one that doesn’t shout its message but lets it settle in your bones. This film is many things: a coming-of-age story, a critique of a broken system, a glimpse into the intimate pain of being a girl in a country where your choices are limited before you’re even allowed to make them.It focuses on the deeply human moments of fear, frustration, and quiet strength as Sunshine navigates an impossible decision in a society that offers her no safe options. Maris Racal delivers her best performance yet, as there’s a stillness to it that makes it all the more heartbreaking.What I really loved is how it doesn’t feel like it’s trying to explain itself and it just presents the reality where religion, poverty, and patriarchy intersect in deeply personal ways. It’s a whole world closing in on a girl who’s just trying to breathe, fighting for her freedom to choose and a right to dream.Seen at SM City Dasmariñas",20

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine listens. It listens to the silence of shame, the dissonance of faith, and the quiet, aching resolve of a girl who simply wants to choose. It’s the kind of film that our deeply Catholic country isn’t ready for, but desperately needs. That it’s showing in nationwide cinemas—not just tucked in the corners of a progressive film festival—feels like a small act of rebellion in itself.Like Eliza Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, a film I often return to when thinking about stories of quiet resistance, Sunshine unfolds with restraint and tenderness, never sensationalizing what is already unbearable. But where Hittman’s film relies on cold urban detachment, Jadaone’s world breathes with a Filipino kind of chaos: loud horns, dim chapels, vendors selling herbal “solutions” beside icons of the Virgin Mary. It’s all there. The hypocrisy, the hush-hush remedies, the weight of sin pressed upon young women’s shoulders before they even understand the language of their own bodies.Maris Racal is astonishing. She carries the film with a performance so grounded, so lived-in, that she often feels less like a character and more like someone we know. A friend. A cousin. A girl on the jeep beside us, clutching a bag, hiding her fear behind a tight grip and a brave face. Her Sunshine is not loud, but she is brave. And perhaps bravery today looks exactly like this: choosing to take control of your life, even when the world tries to stop you.Jadaone’s direction is both intimate and distant, borrowing from the gaze of Brocka but infused with a distinctly feminine grief. We see Sunshine from behind glass, from across alleys, as if we too are complicit in watching but not speaking up. Yet the film never loses its tenderness, even in its political anger.Sunshine is not an easy watch. But it is essential. In a country where reproductive rights are still cloaked in rosaries and stigma, this film asks us not just to look, but to sit, to stay, to listen. It doesn’t beg for permission. It asserts presence. And sometimes, in a nation deafened by doctrine, that’s more than enough.",-1

Sunshine,"i’ve already seen so many pro-choice films that greatly explore the difficulties of going through an abortion (never rarely something always, happening, etc) but i must say that it feels really different to watch a film like it made in your country.. because in the pro-choice films i’ve watched before, they’re usually either set in the old times where abortion was still illegal in their countries or set in a modern setting whereas the female lead needs to travel in other places/states to undergo abortion legally… but in sunshine, it’s set in the modern times or the living conditions of filipino people right now yet there’s still no place to go where abortion is accepted… which speaks a lot about the real life situation for women in our country. women anywhere have to go through a lot to apply *the choice* that they’ve decided on.. however, it is much much worse in the philippines as it’s a complete taboo and sometimes it feels like we’ll never see in our lifetime where abortion will finally be legal in the country…… so, it truly is a remarkable feat that we got a pro-choice filipino film now. not only that because it’s directed by one of the most well-known directors, released nationwide, and promoted in mainstream shows and platforms. this film shedded some light to everyone and it was very much needed for every filipino woman out there.thank you direk antoinette, maris racal, and all the amazing women here for sharing the story of sunshine.

Sunshine,"Unflinching and soo affront—almost to a fault, but perhaps that's exactly what's needed for the Filipino audience. Still torn with how the film physicalized the unborn, especially that the film positions itself as pro-choice. But surely, Jadaone delivers with heart, soul and, crucially, angst. Racal carries the film, the plight and everything else in between. Still a much-needed film!",-1

Sunshine,"This film is, at its core, a well-intentioned and emotionally resonant film. It tackles difficult subject matter with sincerity, and for the most part, it does so with grace. However, I found that the inclusion of fantastical or imaginary elements occasionally detracted from the weight of its core issues. While I understand the metaphorical ambition behind these stylistic choices as well as their function in softening the emotional blows with humor or levity, I believe the film is at its most powerful when it forgoes embellishment and leans fully into the raw intensity of its subject matter. In those moments, when it embraces the chaos, the pain, and the emotional urgency it really becomes something far more affecting and memorable, allowing the simplicity it strives for to emerge, though it’s often overshadowed. At times, the dialogue veers into overtly inspirational or didactic terrain, feeling more like affirmations meant to uplift than naturalistic exchanges between characters. It’s clear that the film doesn’t only aim to tell a story, it wants to educate, to empower, to stir social consciousness. Yet in doing so, it sometimes edges closer to the tone of an educational TV movie than a fully realized work of cinema. That’s not a critique of its moral imperative, it’s a film that should be shown in schools but rather an observation about its limitations as a piece of narrative storytelling. The emotional and ideological weight it seeks to carry isn’t always supported by the nuance or complexity that cinematic storytelling demands.What grounds the film and gives it its most enduring power is its emotional core. Maris Racal delivers a performance of quiet strength and vulnerability, anchoring the film with remarkable consistency. Especially compelling is the subplot involving Rhed Bustamante’s character. Without revealing too much, her arc resonated with me more deeply than the central storyline. It was heartbreakingly authentic, subtle, restrained, and profoundly human. In that thread, the film touches something honest and unflinching.I also admired Antoinette Jadaone’s formal restraint in certain key scenes, particularly her choice to mute the sound. In a film so concerned with voice and expression, those pockets of silence carried tremendous weight. They allowed the viewer a moment of stillness, a space for reflection and imbued the film with a haunting quietude that deepened the emotional stakes.That said, the film’s message doesn’t always land with clarity. After a pivotal hospital scene, I overheard two audience members blame the protagonist for her choices, siding with the doctor who confronts her. That reaction, while anecdotal, reveals a significant shortcoming: the narrative may not have sufficiently challenged ingrained prejudices or prompted the kind of empathy it aspired to cultivate. It bravely addresses urgent topics- reproductive rights, bodily autonomy, the realities of being a young woman navigating unjust systems but the film doesn’t always sharpen these into a coherent or persuasive argument. In trying to reach everyone, it occasionally loses the sharpness needed to truly confront.Still, “Sunshine” is a valuable film, one with earnestness, compassion, and purpose. Its flaws are born of ambition: the desire to inspire, to uplift, and to inform all at once. But perhaps empowerment doesn’t always need to be accompanied by joy. Sometimes, it is in the unvarnished confrontation of pain without fantasy, without consolation that we discover our deepest strength. I don’t mean to suggest the film ought to have ended in despair, but rather that its final act, which shifts into metaphor and closes with a success story, might have benefitted from something more grounded, more unresolved or ambiguous . Real life rarely provides a clean arc, and in a film so rooted in truth, the ending felt almost too easy, too neat.",23
Sunshine,mahalaga na may mga ganitong pelikula. ang dami pa talagang kailangan baguhin/iusad ng pilipinas sa healthcare at perception ng lipunan sa kababaihan.this is the main reason why i love watching films. im given the chance to step into someone else's life and truly empathize with their experiences.husay ni maris!me after makita pangalan ni rico blanco sa credits: ah kaya pala gusto niya palitan music eme,6

Sunshine,"A random review ***it may contain spoilers*** I was in awe after seeing the first 10mins or more of this film. How perfectly shot, how each Sunshine’s flow, movement and forms were perfectly calculated in graceful manner, it may translate to her goals as a national athlete. I like the raw and realistic on the situation where she had an idea if she might be pregnant, from the varsity clinic, how she react, getting a pregnancy kit to a local pharmacy, how she search online on how to get rid or literally “mawala sa sarili” in the moment she found out, i may say if i were in that age I probably be acting the same thing Sunshine did.It very direct, light and eye opening to different perspectives in abortion, from the pro life views, to views of men who is not ready fathered or accept responsibilities, to the views of her friends and colleagues/societal norms, in the perspectives of her coach and to her lifelong dream, to the views of some unwanted pregnant women who dealt from complicated situations, to view of her own family, for Sunshine and to her unborn child. We all have out own biases when it comes to this topic; abortion but at the end it still in the capacity of the woman, the beholder to take choice on what choices she want to take… I was too happy how her family especially her eldest sister Geleen support Sunshine in what decision she may lead to. Its a gemIn silver screen seeing that moment, that scene that is so comforting, q moment that most of us longing in a situation like this. It’s not about taking responsibilities but owning and accepting mistakes and making peace to yourself. We know what is good and what's right but in the end of the day we are the not the right one to decide for someone else fate and choices especially we are not in that situation, where they are coming from.I want to commend Maris Racal for casting as Sunshine. I can’t think anyone else to portray for the role of Sunshine. Flawless acting, she really Sunshine. Also Jennica Garcia too and Meryl Soriano, superb performance. *i love the Aryanna scene. Speaks reality!*the scene with Angeli Bayani /Dr. Helena. After Mary Grace rushed to the hospital and Dr. Helena offer her service after a male doctor rejected Mary grace and Sunshine, only women understands women… period say it all. God, it’s life and death situation, would you still judge a person of her crime that saving her life?*the Tito Bobot scene- Sunshine gives Justice, p*tang-ina nya. Hayop!",-1

Sunshine,"yung number 1 reason kung bakit nagustuhan ko ang sunshine ay dahil si sunshine ang bida. that was a conscious and bold choice for the film. kasi ang mindset ng mga tao, okay lang ang abortion kapag nabuntis ang babae dahil sa rape.pero malinaw ang gustong ipa-realize satin ng pelikula, na si menggay ka man o si sunshine, na-rape ka man o hindi, may option at access ka dapat sa safe abortion. kwento ito ng maraming kababaihan sa bansa, ang iba’y mga ina tulad ni susan (The Barber’s Tales).dapat i-decriminalize ang abortion sa pilipinas and discussions about it must be more about the social reality than morality. naalala ko ang statement noon ng gabriela women’s party:“Whether we see abortion as a moral decision or not, we cannot turn a blind eye to the reality that poor women resort to unsafe abortion as they do not have the resources to raise a child amid the economic crisis, aside from the alarming cases of pregnancies arising from rape.”",-1

Sunshine,"ang iniisip ko lang talaga while watching ay, who would have thought na isang pbb housemate ang magiging one of the best actresses of her generation? no shade, pero hindi kasi talaga talent search ang pbb for me, pero shet, maybe ok lang pala dahil kung hindi walang maris racal?! performance of a lifetime. ilalagay ko sya sa roster of actresses na sasalagan ko ng bala kung sakaling may mamaril sa kanila. ganda ng trajectory ng karera ni bakla! multimedia ang atake! I’m so sorry pero hindi ko mapigilan i-compare si maris kay angelica panganiban. equally talented. it was uphill for angelica after santa santita, and this is maris’ santa santita. an actress na kayang-kaya tumawid between mainstream and profound roles. at sobrang powerful ‘nun kasi konting-konti lang ang nakakagawa ‘nun na kinakagat ng mga tao. husay din nung chuwariwap sunshine. si annika, meryll soriano, and lalong-lalo na si jennica garcia. sa konting eksena nya, para bang binigay nya yung buong pagkatao nya? kung papanoorin nyo palang, abangan nyo yung scenes ni jennica. pag hindi kayo napukaw, kakain ako ng tae!tell me something about mothering without being a mother ang atake ni tonet at sunshine. gets na gets ko ang mensahe na gustong iparating kahit wala akong uterus. at yung pagpapadala ng mensahe, sing-graceful ng rhythmic gymnastics ni sunshine.who was she talking to? her younger self? her dream? her baby? or her conscience? kanya-kanyang interpreration nalang, pero dun ako sa latter. yung tipong, ito yung societal standards na kinalakihan mo, to the point na naging konsensya mo. ang konsensya ba, napapalaglag? that is the question.nung 2020 after ko mapanood ang fangirl, nasabi ko talaga na this is the new age of tonet jadaone. after sunshine, indeed totoo nga. ganda rin talaga ng mga bond nya sa actresses nya for them to spill this hard.this film is not glorifying abortion; it glorifies the women’s choices, because their body, their choice. pinakita ang struggle, the weighing in, and most importantly, the strength on making a firm stand for yourself.",-1
Sunshine,"What I truly admired about this film is how Sunshine stayed committed to her decision from the very beginning. There are moments where you think she might waver, that she might choose differently, but she doesn’t. And I’m so glad direk Tonet stayed firm in writing it that way. As a Filipino film that bravely tackles the topic of abortion (a subject still considered taboo in our country), I really appreciated the way Sunshine and Mary Grace’s stories were presented.…",-1
Sunshine,Maiiyak na sana ako kaso biglang lumabas si piolo… (edi sabay kami ni soph na nagsabi na ang pogi),1
Sunshine,"“1000 Filipino women die each year from post-abortion complications. Unsafe abortion contributes significantly to preventable maternal mortality in the country yet remains the sole option for many young, low-income, and rural women, as 75% of Filipino women seeking abortions are financially unable to raise another child.“",11
Sunshine,"I’ll be honest. I came in 20 mins late and was a bit distracted watching it in some parts but I still could tell how important this filmis.Bit off at some parts especially at how the main kid characters were used but it somehow made sense at the end.Jennica Garcia plays well significant portions of the film, so raw and honest in her depiction. When i think about it, this speaks volumes about women’s health and the longstanding problem on who makes a choice in their bodies, but ultimately it’s about striving for your dreams in a world that otherwise allows you to reach them, to find sunshine amid the storm. So real and so right in your face.",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is a film that proves time and time again that art matters. This is unrelated to the film but Ethan Hawke best explains it when he said that human art is a sustenance that lets us make sense of the things that we have no understanding of. And Sunshine exceeds in that very criteria because of how delicate the plot is yet it puts so much faith on its viewers by challenging them into understanding the struggles explored in the film, and it cleverly succeeds in such a way that does not make it intrusive. The viewer is allowed to draw their own opinions without the film ever forcing them to side with it. Sunshine is Antoinette Jadaone's magnum opus, and the film further shines as Maris Racal delivers a performance of a lifetime. I cannot stress enough how important this film is to the Philippines, and how it is a step forward to everything it stands for. Manila is unforgiving, relentless, and dark, but even the streets can feel like home with even just a little light.",20

Sunshine,"Gets na gets ko na.To be honest, Sunshine may follow the story of a gymnast, but it's really about the quiet, impossible contortions many women are forced to make just to keep going—physically, emotionally, morally. It’s about the weight of carrying something you didn’t choose, in a world that offers you no real way out.It asks the kind of questions that linger long after the credits roll: How do you hold on to your dreams when your body no longer feels like your own? How do you choose anything at all when every choice comes with shame, fear, or punishment?In a country where abortion is completely outlawed—even in cases of rape or danger to the mother—and where women are taught to suffer silently for the sake of appearances or faith, Sunshine hits differently. It doesn't shout. It doesn't try to shock. It simply tells the truth as it is lived: with quiet pain, with small acts of defiance, and with the kind of strength that often goes unnoticed.This film doesn’t just resist—it listens, it aches, and above all, it stays with you.July 26, 2025SM Mall of Asia",17
Sunshine,"in a country where abortion is still criminalized & still buried deeply beneath shame and fear, im glad that this film dares to say what so many are too afraid to: that we simply need to talk about this and that this silence is not a safety but just a mere violence in a very very slow motion.upon watching, i just noticed such apparent layers: desperation, love, pain, and so frustratingly impossible choices. and such never fit neatly into laws written without compassion. im really just so glad that they made a film about care, about womens autonomy, and about the dignity of choosing what to do with ones body, especially in a country like ours, where so many are denied that choice, where morality is frustratingly weaponized and healthcare is gatekept. im really hoping this sparks more than the praise. rage, conversation, and ofc solidarity. and im sure this is already starting to become one of those local films that are not afraid at all to confront our truths no matter how this disturbs the comfortable. we need to legalize abortion. not only simply bc of efficiency, but bc of necessity. bc everyone deserves the right to choose, to be safe, and to be seen.",5

Sobrang ganda.I'm not sure if I am right, but among Direk Tonet's heroines, Sunshine seems to have the least lines.Pero kahit 'yun ang kaso, her story is clear without her having to say much. Maris's acting brought Sunshine to life, in moments when she calms herself and says ""Tiwala lang."" In moments na napapamura siya sa galit. But most especially in moments na mag-isa lang siya at tahimik (that motel scene ). Some people say that it is a happy ending. Nakakatuwa naman talagang nakarating si Sunshine sa SEA Games. Pero nung natapos 'yung pelikula, may bigat pa rin sa puso bilang babae. Why aren't safe choices available to us? Bakit kinailangan pagdaanan ni Sunshine lahat ng 'yun?

Sunshine,"To hell with these topics being taboo in the Philippines - Jadaone says LET’S TALK ABOUT IT and this film did that. Definitely a film that will start conversations and something that will linger in thought even hours after watching it.This film - for starters, was really well-shot and well-edited. That was my first takeaway. Second, well-scored. And when that credits rolled and I saw that Rico Blanco did it? The dots were connecting and with Maris Racal as the protagonist? Wow that was definitely personal maybe that’s why it was done so good.As a man, who actually didn’t know anything about this topic - THIS WAS EYE-OPENING EDUCATIONAL FOR ME. I didn’t know how self-abortion works, I didn’t know how much it cost, I didn’t know what it looks like, I didn’t know how treatment is done after, I didn’t even know that doctors refused service for this! Imagine my fuming anger when that scene happened. For me, this was information overload.I appreciate how this was not Maris Racal anymore. This was Sunshine. Sunshine was a real person. It borderline made me forget that this was a film, it felt like reenactment of something, or maybe unintentionally, it was.Also, scriptwriting and editing masterclass - How you make people laugh with subtle punchlines with great timing, but not cutting off the momentum and emotion you feel for the scene, and also not lightening off the topic at hand. The way that that were balanced? Hats off to Jadaone and the editor, Ben Tolentino (THE GOAT)Performances were topnotch as well! I love that you feel the cast, from lead to support, not one-upping each other. You felt them read the script and read the room and operate on that energy. They were supporting each others’ performances and maybe that’s why it became more effective as a script. The execution was phenomenal.Personally, I would have loved some bit more fleshing out by the third act, because I feel like the un-accustomed or laymen movie audience may not get it immediately with the execution of it and it would’ve been better with the topic at hand to be spoonfed a bit more (but not too much). But yeah this is more of a personal nitpick at this point.Either way - BEAUTIFUL FILM! Is this my favorite Jadaone? I’m not sure yet. But is this objectively the best Maris Racal? TO DATE YES!",-1
Sunshine,"this is a film that demands to be seen, a film unafraid and ready to be at the frontlines of every conversation it confronts. i wish the turning point of it had more execution, but i also thought that's the point of it— to not dwell and move forward.""gets ko na."" and i hope everyone does too.",23

Sunshine,"Sunshine isn’t just a film—it’s a quiet cry from someone who feels stuck, trying to move forward in a world that keeps pulling her back. Tonet Jadaone tells the story with gentle honesty, never shouting, but always making you feel.Maris Racal plays a young gymnast chasing her dream. But life throws her a twist: an unexpected pregnancy. Suddenly, her body—once her source of power—feels like it no longer belongs to her. She’s scared, tired, and unsure what choice feels right.The setting isn’t just Manila—it’s its soul. Busy, sacred, messy. In one scene, she’s buying abortion pills from a street stall, while church bells ring nearby. The contrast is sharp, but real. Sunshine doesn’t tell you what’s right or wrong. It just shows you what’s true.What stayed with me most is how the film feels personal. Like every time I’ve had to choose myself, even when others didn’t understand. It reminded me that courage isn’t loud—it’s the quiet strength to keep going.If you’ve ever felt like you were drowning in expectations, Sunshine reminds you that even in the darkest alleys, there’s a sliver of light. Not because the world is kind—but because you choose to keep walking.",17

Sunshine,"Yesterday, I stumbled upon a Twitter post pointing out parallelisms between Jadaone's Sunshine and Brocka's Insiang with how both films' main characters, in at least one scene, were framed behind bars, mirroring their metaphorical imprisonment within gendered norms of their respective social milieus. Indeed, although almost 50 years have passed between the two films, it's an unfortunate reality that women's rights in the Philippines still have a long way to go, with conservative Catholic values hindering its advancement. Both Jadaone and Brocka present us with their titular characters' fractured psyches, trying everything within their limited power to achieve some kind of self-emancipation. Another Twitter post, however, posits that while Jadaone echoes Brocka in some ways, she ultimately diverges from him by virtue of her ""woman's instinct"" that also augments her narratives with an ""added layer."" Obvious gender essentialism and identity politics aside, this is a sentiment that I'm keen on interrogating: what does it actually mean to have a female directorial sensibility, particularly in the vein of Antoinette Jadaone?An easy answer would be to look at the central conflict of Sunshine, that is, unwanted pregnancy, and that Jadaone opts for a female teenager as its main focalizer. I'm pointing this out because trans men and intersex people can also get pregnant hence a pregnancy plot point would not inherently be women-specific (although there would surely be many overlaps), so it's Jadaone's directorial decision to create a female protagonist that imbues the film with intricacies of the female experience---how proceeding with motherhood would be career suicide for an athlete aiming for the Olympics, how Sunshine is constantly berated by self-righteous people she encounters, how society itself was built against female self-determination, and despite all these, how Sunshine finds small pockets of refuge in other women---a friend, a mentor, an inn receptionist, a doctor, an abused prepubescent, a sister---who are empathetic enough to understand her pain and conviction, and to whom she's equally compelled to reciprocate kindness whenever the situation permits.Further, Jadaone digs deeper and finds the Catholic religious institution, itself a remnant of feudalism, as an underlying hegemonic force against women empowerment, so culturally embedded in Philippine society that Sunshine finds it wherever she goes, be it in the drugstore, in the hospital, in the university, in the sport that she loves, even in the man who got her pregnant. Unfortunately, here is also where Jadaone's supposed female sensibility loses steam: religious guilt is so ubiquitous that even she is not aware that it limits her perspective, that instead of finding multiple angles of inquiry she instead chooses to hammer in the same anti-religious (therefore anti-patriarchal) talking point over and over and over again, even to the point of physicalizing the unborn children, a weirdly pro-life creative decision in a film that self-categorizes as pro-choice. Heck, the film just assumes that the audience already knows about the economic facets of being a Filipino athlete so it makes no effort in examining it, nor is it concerned with how Sunshine and her family earn their money (nobody seems to be working!). No, those aren't important; just focus on the fact that Sunshine is a woman and that she's oppressed because of it. ""Drown out the noise,"" her coach tells her, but is it really necessary to drown it out if the noise is as repetitively monotonous (albeit still imminently threatening) as Jadaone presented it?My argument is that uncritical admiration for ""female sensibility"" is as dangerous as the patriarchy it contends with, and that it's the same liberal narrow-sightedness that applauds Jadaone's bravery for tackling taboo gender topics and turns a blind eye to her cowardice in heeding the pro-Palestine boycott of the Berlinale film festival in the same breath; what's the point of female sensibility if it is devoid of anti-fascist solidarity? Perhaps Sunshine is actually a self-surrogate for the lengths Jadaone is willing to go through in pursuit of her career, and we're all just supposed to root for her because it's great that Philippine cinema is acknowledged and praised internationally, everything else be damned.And maybe I'm expecting too much from Jadaone, that I should just accept that her films are self-contained texts that will never reach the same kind of radicalism and depth as Brocka's (which is admittedly a high standard to reach), but deep inside I want to believe that she's capable of bolder, stronger filmic statements.",-1

Sunshine,"Ganito pala sa Maynila—maingay, mausok, at puno ng pangarap. Sunshine holds up a mirror to Manila's contradictions. There is a sketchy motel that asks for your ID before handing over the keys, as if the system needs to know if you are old enough to make your own decisions. A crowded hospital where pregnant women share beds in the maternity ward, almost as if they are only given a small space in a world they live in. A religious landmark for those seeking miracles, but just outside are street markets selling religious paraphernalia and illegal abortion pills.Maris Racal gives an outstanding performance as Sunshine, a young rhythmic gymnast whose Olympic aspirations are upended by unexpected pregnancy during tryouts. One of the film's striking choices is the inclusion of this magical presence played by Annika Co. To me this character felt like a reflection of the conservative audience inserted into the narrative, a constant presence, watching, whispering, and trying to make sense of Sunshine's decisions.The film closes with the hope that Sunshine, and others like her, might still get the chance to finish their routine and maybe, even become champions of their own lives.",-1

Sunshine,"Set against the relentless rhythm of Manila, the film captures how the world keeps moving—often without mercy—especially for those society has pushed to the margins. Yet, in the middle of all the noise and indifference, it reminds us that even the smallest act of empathy can mean everything to someone, not only for Sunshines out there but also to Mary Graces alike. There should be a choice. Always.",12
Sunshine,"""Naiintindihan mo ba 'ko?""""Gets ko na.""Aside from the usapan between Jennica and Maris, dito talaga ako naiyak. Naisip ko tuloy bigla 'yung lyrics sa Indak na ""makikinig nga ba sa isipan na alam ang wasto, ngunit pipigilan ang pag-ibig niya na totoo."" Kudos to Sunshine for choosing what she feels right for her. Kung sa kwento at paraan ng pagkwento nitong pelikula, sa totoo lang. Kung ano talaga nangyayari sa lipunan. Walang labis, hindi nagkulang, kaya malakas ang impact. For me, iba talaga ang gawa ng direktor na nagmula sa Indie then pinapasok ang mundo ng mainstream. May pag-asa ang Pelikulang Pilipino.",3
Sunshine,"Sunshine is a charming film. Beautifully directed, well-acted, and elevated by a great score and gorgeous cinematography (ang ganda ng Maynila kahit gritty). The pacing is tight and purposeful (walang fillers, or at least I didn't feel it), and honestly, I loved every minute of it. It’s the best Filipino film I’ve seen this year.What stood out most was how it tackled the lack of body autonomy that women face in this country. We reaaaalllyyy need a legal avenue for abortion, and I hope this film helps spark that conversation. Ang hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas!I also liked that it showcased the real Manila without falling into poverty porn (great shots of Quiapo). It celebrated female friendships and relationships without centering men, and it showed the complexities of family without resorting to toxic tropes(supportive ate yes! Jennica Garcia was amaaaazing). I loved the inclusion of sports too; we definitely need more athlete-centered films.Pero, at the heart of it all is a strong, well-developed main character — flawed, impulsive, but deeply likeable and easy to root for (even during her chaotic, violent outbursts!!! I loved those moments, geh girl go lang!!!).Maris Racal was phenomenal. She captured Sunshine’s stress and anxiety with so much nuance — it never felt overacted. Grabe, I really felt her frustration, and by the end, I felt her relief too.I don’t usually write movie reviews, but this film was so phenomenaaaaal I couldn’t help but put my thoughts into words. Ayan tuloy, nakapagsulat ako ng ilang paragraphs! I really hope it gets the support it deserves and that more people catch it in cinemas before Tuesday so that it gets extended and marinig ni Direk yung now on it's 3rd week — ganern!Thank you, Papa God para sa movie na to!!!",12
Sunshine,"Ang tapang!Not only is this Jadaone's bravest and best film yet, it's also arguably the most important local film in recent years. And the fact that it got past the Movie and Television Review and Christians Board and is now showing in the most mainstream cinemas in the country, is already a big win in itself.Sunshine joins Joanne and Jane as Jadaone's women trapped but still dreaming, living, and surviving in a world by and of weak men.And much like what she was able to get out of then-up-and-comers Nadine Lustre and Charlie Dizon, Jadaone gives birth to another star in Maris Racal. And like her big sisters, she SHINES.Jennica Garcia MOTHERED;Maris Racal MURDERED! (oops!)[SM Marikina] < Ang Ranking: Antoinette Jadaone >",-1

Sunshine,"Seconds after the credits started rolling, I blankly stared at the ceiling, pondering a lot of questions. Ganitong-ganito yung mga film na gustong-gusto ko may talkback not because I want to know the process but rather I want to learn more about the topic. As they say, “Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable” at sa tingin ko matagumpay na nagawa yun ng Sunshine. And that “Gets kita” scene crumpled my heart so bad (kahit hindi ako babae).From Maris to the supporting actors, everyone truly gave their all. They genuinely breathed life into their characters. My Direk Tonet’s fave alongside with That Thing Called Tadhana and Never Not Love You. Sana marami pa ang makapanood nito at maging paraan upang mas magkaroon pa ng nga diskusyon patungkol dito.",-1

Sunshine,"GETS NA GETS KITA, SUNSHINE!Isa sa mga pelikulang masasabi kong deserve talaga ang puri. More than just the technicalites, this film have truly depicted something that people in the community should watch, learn and confront kasi putang ina, masakit na katotohanan lang naman ang binibigay na mensahe ng pelikulang to. Nakakaiyak. Nakakalungkot. Nakakagalit.Malinaw ang direksyong binigay ni Direk Tonet para sa tinahak na journey ni Sunshine. Talagang sinubok lahat ng karakter, at binigyang hustisya naman ito ng lahat ng aktres at aktor— lalo na si Maris Racal. Hindi rin naman tayo binigo ni Direk Pao sa magandang execution ng cinematography. Sana, marami pang katototohan ang pwede pang maibabahagi sa pamamagitan ng pelikula tulad ng Sunshine. At sana, walang takot itong papanoorin ng mga tao at harapin ang katotohanang dala ng pelikulang ito. Katotohanan sa sarili, at sa komunidad na kinabibilangan.GUSTO KONG MAG-REWATCH! ",6
Sunshine,"5 out of 5 stars. First I wanna say that the cinematography is superb. The shots especially of Sunshine as she traverses the streets of Manila are fantastically immersive.Ang ganda ng musical score! Favorite scenes: Motel scene and yung 13 years old scenes x Ariana up to the hospital scene. Ramdam ko yung pagiging helpless ni Sunshine! Tagos!Grabe nakakaalog ng pagkatao!The most powerful scene was when she was practicing in solitude - Gets ko na!Excellent storytelling - eto ang pantapat sa Hollywood films talaga. Your body, your choice.",-1
Sunshine,"So moved by this film not just by the story itself but also by how it was told---so much so that it snapped me out of a personal slump. It depicted the most raw parts of Manila life without making it feel like poverty porn, tackled sensitive issues without just adding it for shock value, and ultimately gave more depth to the main character's dilemma---plights that women (especially in the third world) struggle with daily. Needless to say, the performances and soundtrack really brought the story to life in a way that will leave you thinking about the film for a while. Beautiful, beautiful.",-1
Sunshine,Maris Racal is brilliant.,-1
Sunshine,"maris, this is the reason why you're my favorite. i really love how the story went. i am really glad how it ended. i am happy for you, sunshine. i was literally crying na para bang may matres ako!",39
Sunshine,"Usually, when a film claims to challenge a societal norm, it ends up being either too preachy or barely scratching the surface. But sometimes, a film like Sunshine comes along and delivers on its promise—clear, direct, and most importantly, brave.Not only is this Jadaone’s best film to date, but it’s also her most important. It’s a feminist masterclass in storytelling, evident in how every significant character in the film that supports Sunshine is a woman. And to top it all off, the ending was written to give the character what she truly deserves—even if the harsh realities of our country don't always allow a woman to have that.Even the casting was perfect and clearly intentional—from Maris’s embodiment of Sunshine to Elijah’s portrayal of the privileged Miggy (perfect choice of name, by the way). Setting the story against the raw backdrop of Manila adds just the right weight to the film’s intention.Minsan lang dumating ang isang pelikulang pwedeng magbukas ng mata ng mas marami pang tao. Sana dumating ang araw na hindi na mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas. Sana maintindihan ng kung sino man ang nasa taas. Sana masabi nilang, “Gets ko na.""",20
Sunshine,"[SPOILERS!]Ang pinakapaborito kong detalye sa movie nato ay ang fact na “wala lang ang pera sa buhay ni Miggy”.Binasag ni Sunshine ang windshield ng kotse nya? No problem, sa sunod na shot with the car, intentionally mag-ga-glide ang shot sa harap at makikitang napalitan na ang windshield at wala nang confrontation about it. It is just fixed.Kailangan ni Sunshine ng pera para magpalaglag ng bata? Walang intro-intro, dumukot sa bulsa si Miggy, binigyan nya si Sunshine ng 5k. 5000 pesos!Nalaman ng tatay ni Miggy na nakabuntis sya? Edi sige, sasagutin nila lahat ng hospital bills nya. Susustentuhan nila ang magiging bata until mag-18 ito. Pag-aaralin nila sa Ateneo, La Salle, you name it.Money is not an issue for them.The runners up are:2. Gift of God ang pangalan ng jeep na sinakyan ni Sunshine papunta sa Quiapo for the first time.3. I think (and maybe this is a reach), deliberate ang decision na pink and yellow ang official colors ng movie nato.I am a mark for this film. I have no distance from it. It is a match between Jun Robles Lana and Direk Tonet as my favorite active Filipino filmmaker right now tapos crush ko na si Maris PBB days nya pa lang. Of course I’m gonna love it.",35
Sunshine,"Sunshine (Maris Racal) is a record-breaking national athlete, but the film fails to show the weight of that achievement.She wears a tank top marked “Asian Games 2018,” and her coach (Meryll Soriano) warns her against complacency: “Balewala lahat ng gold mo sa Asian Games.”Since the Asian Games are held every four years, and Sunshine is about 19 or 20, this suggests she won multiple golds in 2018 — a rare feat. She would be gymnastics royalty, a media darling, likely the most successful Filipina rhythmic gymnast in history.Yet the film doesn’t show her as a public figure. No news clippings, no media buzz, no crowds—just a few kids asking for a selfie. It also focuses mostly on her ribbon routine, barely showing the hoop, ball, or clubs—all key to establishing her as Olympic-level.Sunshine’s decision to abort is quick, and her fears and ambitions are underexplored. The Olympics, in fact, feel more like her coach’s dream—the film tells us this but doesn’t show it.There’s no pressure from a country rooting for her, nor from sponsors who presumably funded her expensive training (which we’re left to assume, since rhythmic gymnastics is an elite sport). No rival gymnast, no sense of competition, no major stakes, and no real glimpse into the demanding world of elite sport.All this undercuts the tension around her unwanted pregnancy.Jadaone instead spends a chunk of screen time on soapy magical realism. An imaginary, foul-mouthed child follows Sunshine around, mocking her decisions. But instead of adding insight, this character becomes repetitive and irritating.Rhed Bustamante plays another pregnant teen, awkwardly inserted into the plot in an effort to cover too many sides of the abortion debate. But Rhed’s more serious situation makes Sunshine’s dilemma feel shallow—like a story about a girl careless with sex and unwilling to face the consequences.Some visuals in Sunshine hit hard: abortifacients sold beside religious icons outside Quiapo Church—a jab at how the Catholic Church, in practice, is more ritual than moral compass. There’s also a grim motel scene. But these moments can’t save the film.Set in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, where abortion is illegal, Sunshine tries to raise issues around teen pregnancy and reproductive rights, like overcrowded maternity wards. True enough, the Philippines has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Southeast Asia, especially among the poor.But if a film brings this up, it must give some context. The Reproductive Health Law, passed only in 2012, was meant to help—but the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) continues to fight tooth and nail against sex education and birth control.The film ignores all this. Instead, it gives us a cartoonish, Bible-thumping doctor and a patriarchal pastor—villains standing in for real problems. We don’t expect to be spoon-fed, but when a film enters controversial ground and hints at bigger issues, it has a duty to avoid shallow symbols.In the end, Sunshine parrots Western slogans like “My body, my choice” without anchoring its stance in the Philippine context. The message feels imported and emotionally flat.READ FULL REVIEW (DAILY TRIBUNE): https://tribune.net.ph/2025/07/26/sunshine-review-abortion-tale-misses-the-mark",17
Sunshine,"In a world full of questions like “Naiintindihan mo ba ako?”, dare to be the one who says, “Gets ko na.”The social relevance of this film lies in its powerful commentary on how women should be given the right to own their bodies. I’m in awe of how socially conscious the film is, and how realistically it depicts the struggles of women living in a conservative and non-progressive world.I truly hope people will be moved by this film and realize that it’s not just about faith and beliefs—it’s about giving women an equal chance at life by listening to them, understanding where they come from, and supporting where they want to go.This film should be seen, heard, and felt.At dahil diyan, oo sunshine—naiintindihan na kita.P.S. This film is not just about abortion. It’s deeper than that. It’s also about our healthcare system, and so much more. I won’t spoil anything else—just go watch it.",30

Sunshine,"Ang lungkot.The credits started rolling and I sat there, dazed and tear-stained. I wanted to sing my praises to the movie (and I do!) pero mas nangibabaw sa akin ang sakit.Marami akong gustong punahin. Mga detalyeng mas lalong binigyan ng laman ang buhay ni Sunshine. Like how she was always framed between rails. Clearly an artistic choice, but to me, she was caged throughout the film. By judgment. By society's cruelty. By this country's refusal to grant women autonomy over their own bodies.Wherever she goes, the spaces are as narrow as her choices. Masikip sa bahay kung saan nakikita mo kung paano natapos ang pangarap ng ate niya. Masikip sa paaralan kung saan mag-isa niyang nilalabanan ang mga mapangmatang titig at pandidiri. Masikip sa Quiapo kung saan siya laging tumatakbo at naghahanap ng paraan para makalaya.Masikip sa ospital—ospital kung saan nilalarawan ang kakulangan sa magandang serbisyo. Ospital kung saan nahuhusgahan ang maraming kababaihan.The only time Sunshine's world seems to widen and glow is when she's inside the training center. Doon lang siya malaya. Doon lang may ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. At sana doon din natin maintindihan kung anong pinaglalaban ng pelikula. Sana gets mo na.Masaya akong may pelikulang ganito. Pero nangingibabaw ang lungkot. What if this is another film on the big screen that will be forgotten soon? I remember watching Brocka's Manila sa Kuko nang Liwanag and saw how many of its harsh truths are still prevalent today. Walang pagbabago. Walang usad. Mahirap pa rin.The real pain of the movie is when we watch it years later and the truth remains: women still have to bleed to fight for their rights.Sana hindi.",-1

Sunshine,"Layunin ng Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) na magkaroon ng kamalayan ang kabataan sa mga isyu ng seksuwalidad lalo pa na nasa yugto sila na tinutuklas ito. Sa kabilang banda, kontrobersiyal ito sa ating bansang Katolisismo ang pinakalaganap na relihiyon. Gayundin ang usapin ng aborsiyon. Sa panulat at direksiyon ni Antoinette Jadaone, isa itong pelikulang sports drama na umiikot kay Sunshine (Maris Racal) na kailangan magpasiya kung ipagpapatuloy o hindi ang pagbubuntis habang papalapit ang kaniyang paglahok sa pambansang paligsahan sa rhythmic gymnastics. Walang tapon sa bawat kuha ng mga eksena, kahit na sa mga background audio nito, sapagkat sumisimbolo ito sa kalagayan ng Pilipina sa ating patriyarkal na lipunan. Nagustuhan ko ang panulat at direksiyon nito dahil sang-ayon sa sinabi ng aking kaibigan, naiparanas nito ang pakiramdam na may isa kang kakilala na kahalintulad ni Sunshine. Bukod dito, naiparamdam nito na kasama ka sa pelikula. Iyong tipong sinubaybayan mo rin ang paglalakbay ni Sunshine sa saanmang sulok ng Maynila. Kaya, makakaugnay at mailalagay mo ang sarili sa kalagayan ng pangunahing tauhan o sa sinuman. Malinis din ang pagkaka-edit ng pelikula sapagkat malinaw sa direktor kung ano ang nais niyang mangyari kay Sunshine. Piling-pili ang mga eksena kaya ang hirap pumili ng pinakamaganda o pinakanagustuhan. Hangang-hanga rin ako disenyong pamproduksyon nito dahil bukod sa ginalugad talaga ang madidilim na espasyo ng Maynila, iniisip ko kung paano sila nakapag-shooting sa ganoong karaming tao. Grabeng blockings niyon. Karapat-dapat talaga na papurihan si Racal sa kaniyang pagganap dito. Tama lamang ang timpla ng iba't ibang emosyon ang ipinamalas niya rito. Ngunit ang pinakanakabibilib sa lahat, magaling din ang mga pantulong na tauhan kaya napalitaw nito ang husay ng pangunahing artista. Ang tinginan nila ni Thea (Xyriel Manabat). Ang coach na tila pangalawang nanay na si Eden (Meryll Soriano). Ang misterysong batang babae (Annika Co). Ang kakampi na si Geleen (Jennica Garcia). Kahit na ang lokong si Miguel (Elijah Canlas). May ambag silang lahat upang mapagtibay ang karakterisasyon ni Sunshine at ang husay ni Racal. Ang ganitong pelikula ang nagbibigay ng dahilan kung bakit mahalaga na mayroong CSE at kung bakit kailangan mapag-usapan at mapag-isipan muli ang legal at siyentipikong pagpapalaglag. Babae man o lalaki, kahit na ang LGBTQIA+, binibigyan tayo nito ng awtoridad sa ating katawan. Sa kabuuan, nagustuhan ko ang ""Fangirl"" (2020) ni Direk Tonet na naglarawan ng estado ng babae sa rehimeng Duterte. Higit pa sa debate ng aborsiyon, napaibig ako sa ""Sunshine"" dahil sa pagpapakita nito ng tunay na ideya ng feminismo - ang pagkakaroon ng kalayaang pumili at ng kakampi.",3

Sunshine,"If I’m being honest, Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine floored me. There is something in this film that’s raw and authentic. It’s devastatingly human. Sunshine addresses the women’s act of choosing (their dilemma) and the outcome of that act. Jadaone’s direction was fearless for depicting women’s struggles, reproductive rights and vulnerability, especially in the context of abortion (which is considered taboo here in the Philippines), while focusing on the titular character’s dream—was commendable. Its narrative structure, themes, relevance and layers were handled…",17

Sunshine,"i rarely rave about indie films that tackle societal issues because the ones i've watched either sound too preachy or abstract that it's difficult to grasp. but sunshine proved to be different and that's why i loved it so much. it never tells you whether abortion is right or wrong. instead, it shows you a genuine depiction of the lived realities of girls like sunshine and mary grace and gets you thinking about the many other girls/women like them long after you leave the theater. ang hirap maging babae sa mundo, lalo na rito sa pilipinas pero pinaalala sa akin ni sunshine na kailangan kong tapangan at lumaban di lang para sa akin kundi para sa iba pang kababaihang kasama ko sa araw-araw na laban.",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine presents a two-pronged takeoff on putting forth a controversial subject it aims to transfigure into a discourse. It’s gritty yet poignant, a dichotomy facilitated by careful restraint in its direction, intricate cinematography, and Maris Racal’s stellar performance.The film deflects clichés observed in Filipino melodramas that often rely on overly oppressive emotional tropes and techniques. Most notably, it veers away from positioning religion or the Church as a central source of female agency. Instead, it presents it as an androcentric institution where permission for a woman’s reproductive health decisions must be sought, implying a strong assertion of control and dominance over women’s bodies.Set against the backdrop of bustling, grunge-textured Manila, the camera takes a remarkable grasp on the parallelisms and minutiae of everyday life in the cruel city: a crowded train moving across the metro juxtaposed against a dreary room in Avenida; an abortifacient vendor sitting by a display of Mary Magdalene busts she sells in Quiapo; a tight-knit community devoid of love and empathy for a child.The film refuses to paint the gaps and seams of a faulty society in broad strokes. Sunshine is delicately crafted and measured. It deeply delves into the nuances and detailed complexities of living in a Christian society that has, ironically and deliberately, chosen to position women’s rights on the periphery.It taps into female solidarity as a form of agency and collective resistance, offering both an idealistic and pragmatic antithesis to the marginalization they have long been experiencing.Reminiscent of Antoinette Jadaone’s pre-studio works such as Plano (2004) and Saling Pusa (2006), Sunshine feels like a beautiful work of personal musings. It is honest, outrageous, yet tender—marking one of her greatest directorial masterpieces.",-1

Sunshine,Perfect casting. Beautifully written. Relevant.,-1
Sunshine,"I think it's safe to say by now that Antoinette Jadaone is one of the greats of Philippine Cinema. And not just of now, but of all time. The still-young filmmaker, who cut her teeth on quirky indie comedies ( Six Degrees of Lilya Cuntapay, Beauty in a Bottle) soon became the new queen of Pinoy Romantic Comedies, resulting in an 8-films-in-5-years streak that included classics like That Thing Called Tadhana, Never Not Love You and Alone/Together. Then in 2020, something changed. At the height of the pandemic, Tonet released Fan Girl -- an unflinching, searing commentary on celebrity worship, toxic masculinity and patriarchal oppression in the Philippines. It not only won all the major awards during that year's MMFF, but was also the highest-grossing film for that year. This makes Tonet somewhat of a unicorn: a writer/director who can make socially relevant, intelligent cinema but at the same time kill it at the box office. This feat is especially astounding in a year when zero films have actually made money. And so that six-year streak turned into a five-year absence, and wisely so. Tonet channeled her creative juices towards other roles and mediums: television, streaming, producing. I'm a big believer in taking care of one's filmography, and she's doing just that. And as fans we have finally been rewarded. Hello, Sunshine. Sunshine follows a slew of, and there's no non-blunt way to put it, abortion movies that have come to the fore in the 2020s. You have the US's Never Rarely Sometimes Always and France's L'Événement. All films follow the internal struggle and loneliness that women face when going through the abortion process. Of the three, Sunshine is the most powerful for one simple reason: it's set in the Philippines. And while it hits home because it is home, the oppression, hypocrisy and outright strangeness of the system makes this abortion story unique. It's a country where you can find ads for abortives just buy typing in ""abortion"" in your instagram search terms, where a vendor of Catholic paraphernalia situated outside a church will also peddle Cytotec, where a doctor who saves your life will also give you a 5-minute telling-to once you're well enough to listen. It's a country where self-righteous sanctimonium has endangered millions of young women's lives. Sunshine is pro-choice, but it's also pro-life. It never tries to turn away from the consequences and the trauma women go through when making this decision. And it shows us what could have been, never cheapening the lives that were lost. These layers, the emotional depth with which Tonet imbues Sunshine, are what sets it apart. It's a very thought provoking film, but it aims straight for the heart. I've spent all this time singing Tonet's praises, but of course Sunshine wouldn't be Sunshine without the brilliant Maris Racal. I meant it when I said that Maris is a generational talent: a true actress with genuine love for the craft who just also happens to be incredibly popular. She breathes so much life and attitude into Sunshine that she really feels like a friend. Someone you're rooting for, someone whose pain you understand.It's a very important film, but don't let its importance weigh you down. End of the day, like all of Tonet's films, it's a story well told with characters you genuinely care about. Sunshine is now showing in all SM Malls. Please do go out and catch it right away.",-1

NOT GONNA LIE! akala ko she was gonna die… because in a setting na criminalized yung abortion and na there’s almost no choice except sketchy folk potions or DIY “accidents”, it’s not exactly a formula for a happy ending  naghahanap ako ng clarity on what she really did (kaya i didn’t know what to rate this) but when i read later na the…",5
Sunshine,"WOMEN INDEED HAVE THE MOST AUTONOMY OVER THEIR BODIES! PERIOD! Malinaw ang mensahe ng pelikula at napakaganda ng pagkakahabi ng istorya at kung paano ang repleksyon nito sa lipunan. Progresibo ang atake and it has the power to spark meaningful conversation and eventually i-glorify ang karapatan ng mga kababaihan sa kanilang sariling desisyon sa napakaraming bagay kabilang na ang kanilang katawan.The moment I heard about Sunshine, alam kong hindi ito basta-bastang pelikula. Worth it ang paghihintay. Para kay Maris ang film na ‘to. Walang ibang artista na dapat gumanap kundi si Maris lang, she perfectly owned this film. Grabe braincells ni Direk Tonet, napakahusay! Technicality speaking, grabe iba ang Pao Orendain walang tapon na cinematography shots grabe ang pulido. Screenplay, grabe sobrang husay ni Direk Tonet nangungusap ang bawat salita sa masa — malinaw ang mensahe at may pinaglalaban.Isa lamang to sad and painful reality ng mga kababaihan. Yung film na ‘to hindi lang siya kwento ng aborsyon, kwento rin ito ng mga taong handang sumuporta sa desisyon ng mga kababaihan — ate, kaibagan, coach etc. Grabe yung scene ni Jennica and Maris sa kama, it hit me so bad! Ultimately, these stories are real. These realities exist. Kaya ang isyu ng aborsyon ay importanteng pag-usapan, unawain, at huwag ipagsawalang bahala lamang. Totoo ang dinaranas ng napakaraming Sunshines sa Pilipinas. Salamat sa buhay at istorya mo, Sunshine! Gets ko na! Kuhang-kuha mo ang respeto at pagmamahal ko sa mga kababaihan, Sunshine!

Sunshine,"grabe iyak ko :"""""""""""""""")OK SO going into this movie i didnt expect much, i mean, its a movie about aborting a child and how its connected to a person who also wants to continue their dream. pero after watching it, it really is so much moreuna sa lahat, ang galing ni maris!!!! sobrang nagmelt sha sa role na to, as in i thought of her as sunshine herself talaga and almost forgot i was still watching a movie kasi sobrang galing!!!!! the supporting actors as well na kahit onti lng scenes nila e talagang ginawa nila lahat to make this movie feel so real so props to themthe message is something i didnt expect din na magststick saakin. growing up catholic and now studying in a catholic univ din sa manila, sobrang daming messages na abortion is wrong and you are killing the baby, the movie ofc didnt shy away from this message, even portraying it sa doctor na magsorry daw kay papa God. that scene was so uncomfortable btw sobrang UGH but its clear. Gets ko na. and i hope so much more people get it ngayon lang din mas naging clear saakin yung meaning ng prochoice. how sunshine chose to Not have it. how firm she was to continue her dreams. how she knows and chose na hindi pa siya handa maging nanay. that's what being prochoice is. and so many people, lalo na teens, who go through such painful procedures and even risking their life kasi they didnt have the choice to have a safe procedure done. ok dami ko na sinasabi basa na kili-kili ko! this is such an important film and sana everyone gets to watch this movie. i hope it becomes more accessible. i hope this doesnt become a weapon for schools to scare teens to not have sex. i hope this becomes the reason why sex education and the concept of being prochoice isnt a taboo topic in the ph anymore OK YUN LANG THANK YOU ANG GALING NI MARIS RACAL SOBRANG HANGA AKO",6
Sunshine,"thank you for showing the real colors of Manila, Sunshine. gets ko na",2
Sunshine,"Sunshine explores the balance beam of morality, tipping between the push to reclaim bodily autonomy and the pull of Catholic guilt. It’s interesting how the film’s key scenes are set in the dark, sketchy streets of Quiapo — a reflection of how young Filipinas navigate the lifelong, generational burden of taking control of our own bodies, while still trying to stay in line with the same dark and sketchy standards set by the very society that claims to protect us from it.",12
Sunshine,"I really do love this film. Napapasabay ako sa mura ni Sunshine dahil sa frustration. I love how this film shows the struggle of a woman and how fucked up the system is here in the Philippines.Society forbids a girl from having a dream and from not wanting to become a mother.

Sunshine,"one of the very few women centered filipino films that talks about a taboo topic in our country and it did a great job at showing the realities and effects of us not having the right to choose a safer option because of it being illegal. I really like how this film didnt shy away from showing the different people we encounter in our society and how they view what should be a basic right of women as criminal and how badly they shame them for choosing themselves and their dreams instead of an unborn fetus. yung line na ""gets ko na"" is so powerful ksi it came after numerous prejudices and it shows that coming from a place of understanding is much more important than just blindly enforcing your beliets unto others especially when you dont know their entire situation. one thing Ing na nagkulang ako is the dialogue and breaking point tiga ni sunshine.

Sunshine,sucha brave take on abortion in a country that condemns it :”)) a must watch indeed !,4
Sunshine,"This is the sunshine the country needs in today’s climate.It was Jadaone’s courage that popped in my head when the title card flashed, a very Filipina name that connotes brightness and warmth — two things the film was not intended for, two things the titular character was deprived of. Sunshine is a story of every Sunshine, a Filipino woman vulnerable to systemic injustice and oppression; a story no one could have been told better than a Filipino woman herself — and a fearless and intelligent one at that. From reproductive health and general health care system to conservatism, Jadaone’s care and spirit championed. Her personification of one’s conscience was beautifully done. I sobbed through the last 15 minutes.True-to-life darkness in the country executed from the literal streets to the contexts of quality of life through Orendain’s realism. There’s a harrowing frame in the movie that ticked all my boxes as a fan of dark cinematography. I bled in the dark with Sunshine right there.This film boasts a talented bundle of actresses: Meryll Soriano, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, Jennica Garcia, with Maris Racal tying the ribbon, flexing her acting muscles across different tones and needs. Well-written and well-directed performances with standouts coming from Garcia, Co, and Racal. Ah, women.Malalim. Matapang. Mahalaga. Hindi ako babae pero gets na gets kita, Sunshine.",12

Ramdam mo ang hinanakit, takot, at lungkot ni Sunshine dahil sa acting ni Maris. Ibigay na ang FAMAS at URIAN sa kanya.Sa mga supporting casts, especially Jennica Garcia, ang galing nilang lahat.

Sunshine,"Another masterpiece by Antoinette Jadaone.Sunshine is more than just a sports story. It's more than just an abortion as a movie subject. Sunshine is a long-overdue conversation, especially in the Philippines. A message that conveys abortion as health care, women's rights, and autonomy over their bodies and their lives. Sana gets niyo na—because in a system and a society with a twisted and blinded morals, kapwa mga babae lamang ang nag-sa-sakripisyo para protektahan ang isa't isa.Sunshine, mahirap man sa ngayon, pero gets kita. Gets ka namin. We got your back.",12

Sunshine,i dragged my conservative mom to watch this with me lol,-1
Sunshine,"This movie encourages the discussion about reproductive health and how it harms more than it protects those who are directly involved the longer this societal taboo regarding topics like abortion and sex education gets ignored.Sobrang gets ko si Sunshine, magmula doon sa guilt, sa despair, hanggang sa acceptance niya na may karapatan siyang pumili ng nararapat para sa sarili niya. She did it not for anyone else but for herself. Sana mas dumami pa ang makaintindi hindi lang sa naging sitwasyon niya, sa sitwasyon ni Menggay, pero maging sa marami pang kwento ng bawat babae sa mundo.Movie wise, para sa akin, maganda ang pacing. Maayos na naihayag ang kwento ni Sunshine na hindi minadali. Sakto lang para maintindihan pero bibigyan ka pa rin ng karapatan bilang manonood na mag isip. Patawa-tawa lang madalas si Direk Tonet sa AWKP pero ang bawat kwento na inihahayag niya sa mga pelikula niya ay may kirot, may substance, may relevance. Talk about versatility, eme!",-1
Sunshine,"Painful, precise, and so Filipino, it hurts.",15
Sunshine,"There is much to commend about the film and it could have been even more impactful had it fully leaned into its intention of confronting the realities surrounding abortion and calling out institutions to respond with compassion and accountability. While it could have been stronger had it fully explored the idea of safe abortion and pushed institutions to respond, the film’s restraint is understandable given the legal and cultural context. It opens the door for more Filipino films that reflect the lived experiences of many, especially women whose struggles have long been sidelined. Sunshine is deeply human, and in that honesty lies its strength.",13
Sunshine,"Gets kita, Sunshine.",2
Sunshine,"Within the streets live the busiest minds of pain and anguish that are continuously being punished by a conservative system. Totoong tapang, totoong kuwento, totoong bigat, at totoong pagpapakasakit na sana ay tumawid sa lakas na bumago sa kakulangan. This film vividly speaks that Sunshine's story of courage should not be romanticized or praised, but her womanhood and choice must be liberated.",20

Sunshine,"“Bakit ka ba takbo nang takbo? Mahirap yan. Tumatakbo tapos di alam kung saan pupunta.”i faintly remember this video explaining the absence of young prodigies in the film industry. because unlike athletes, the field doesn’t merely rely on one’s prime to succeed. instead, it honors the individual’s maturity, discernment, and time spent in understanding life. this is what i felt in Direk Tonet’s recent slew of films. since Fan Girl (2020), it feels like she’s found her voice¹. informed, empowered, and deeply understanding. with her latest offering, Sunshine, i have to applaud her for having the guts to tell such a delicate story, a sensitive subject matter—in a predominantly Catholic country where abortion is illegal, no less.Sunshine’s charm lies in showing the grim reality of the city, the sheer obliviousness of the night, the secret alliance of the system and culture continually perpetuating harsh conditions for women and their bodies. it’s an incisive picture for us to empathize with the Sunshines of this world, with their dreams at the palm of their hands but their backs against the wall—deprived of freedom, options, and utmost support. and don’t you find it endearing that the ensemble that helped Sunshine’s reckoning are all women? from her gymnastics coach, the motel receptionist, her estranged bestfriend, the healthcare professional, and, of course, her loving sister².watching Sunshine is important to open the discussion and continue the conversation on women’s bodily autonomy. and maybe it all starts with an understanding, a mutual agreement, and someone who will say “Gets kita.” like a heartfelt acknowledgment.___¹ one could argue it’s already burgeoning since Never Not Love You (2018)² Jennica Garcia the artist that you are",6

Sunshine,"""Sunshine"" is not just the greatest Filipino movie I've seen but one of the most important Filipino films of all-time! This film deals with controversial topics in our society, abortion and teen pregnancy. A week of national tryout for the gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal) finds out that she's pregnant. Conflicts arise as she has to decide what to do next. In between life and dreams, what's the most significant between the two?The film is unconventional at best. This is not your usual and average Filipino drama you'll see. It's a character study about a teenager who is on the down side of her life. We follow her journey through this life and see a glimpse of her life dealing with her problem. Maris Racal defines this film as Sunshine. Her acting here is brilliant. She's perfect for this role. Jennica Garcia surprised me. Her character as Sunshine 's sister marks! What she said to Sunshine near the ending, though it's common, is like a punch to tears! I ended up loving her character. Jennica Garcia deserves an award for being the best supporting actress for this role. Another cast that standout is Rhed Bustamante and Xyriel Manabat both deserve a recognition for their role.Blurring between reality and fantasy, mostly this film is realistic in portraying the whole theme thanks to Direk Antoinette Jadaone directions. Also, the cinematography is the best! Overall, ""Sunshine"" is a women's movie. It's timely, affecting and brave to its theme. It doesn't spoon feed. It will make you immersed and think. It's worth an experience. This is a rare Filipino movie I've seen! I'm glad and proud watching this in cinema. After watching ""Sunshine"", it leaves me with a question, ""Is abortion a choice if your greatest dream will compromise?""",12
Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone's most polished work yet since NEVER NOT LOVE YOU. With a very strong social commentary on unwanted pregnancy and abortion, Jadaone navigates the pain and heartbreak of a woman in the person of Maris Racal as SUNSHINE. A gymnast aiming for Olympics but the conflict arise when she got pregnant. With her electrifying performance a shoo-in already for the next award derby Maris is deserving of all the future trophies that will be bestowed to her.Maris Racal and Annika Co are both fantastic!SUNSHINE is what we need during bad times.",-1

Sunshine,"“gusto ko maging presidente!”“pano ka magiging presidente?”“magaartista muna ko” gets ko na, gets ko na gotta be one of the best, if not the best Filipino film I’ve ever seen! it tackled a taboo topic very well. they successfully showed different reactions to abortion—the supportive pro-choicers to the people who stigmatize it (even medical practitioners). in the context of the Filipino society and religion, throughout the film, religion has been prominent. from sunshine’s rituals when she performs, the quiapo setting, the hospital scene, and the scene with Miggy’s dad… it all had religious dialogue which makes it so realistic, so Filipino. The film successfully captured the nuances of a teenage girl in a college setting. Walang moments na napa-huh? ako because it was so well made (or maybe I’m just used to Filipino films [that i’ve seen] making me huh) Maris was phenomenal. Jennica was outstanding. Rhed Bustamante’s role was a wake up call, a disgusting wake up call about the reality some Filipino women and children live in.",-1

Sunshine,"Interesting na rhythmic gymnastics ang sports ni Sunshine (Maris Racal). Hindi ito kilala sa ating bansa pero kitang-kita sa sports na ito na kailangan ng marinading determinasyon at disiplina hindi lamang sa larangan ng sports dito sa Pilipinas pati na rin sa paghahanda sa paglaban sa Olympics. Kaya naman ng mabuntis si Sunshine ay naharap siya sa isang desisyong babago sa kanyang buhay at sa mga tao sa paligid niya. Ilan sa mga isyu na nilatag ng pelikula ay ang kakulangan ng sex education at accessibility ng legal abortion sa Pilipinas dahil na rin sa konserbatibong paniniwala. Idagdag pa ang kulang na suporta ng gobyerno pagdating sa ating atleta tulad na lamang sa eksenang sila pa mismo ng pamilya niya ang naghanda ng kanyang isusuot sa Olympics. Religious hypocrisy din ang kinokompronta ng pelikula tulad sa eksenang giniguilt trip ng isang sarado Katoliko na OB GYNE at muli ring pang-guilt trip sa kanya ng pastor na ama ni Miggy kay Sunshine. Si Miggy ay pastor kid na nakabuntis sa dalaga. Hindi na rin naman bago ang pagtalakay ng abortion sa Pilipinas sa pelikulang Pilipino dahil nariyan ang ""High School Scandal"" (1982) sa direksyon ni Gil Portes at ""Hinugot sa Langit"" (1985) na pinagbidahan ni Maricel Soriano at dinirek ni Ishmael Bernal. Ang kagandahan ng pelikula ay babaeng filmmaker ang lumikha at alam niya ang nadarama at pinagdadaanan mapa-pisikal, emosyonal at sikolohikal ng kapwa babae. Napakahusay ni Maris Racal sa pelikulang ito. Ang laking tulong ng cinematog kasi 'yun ang nag-set ng tone at mood ng pelikula over-all. Somewhat reminded of ""Gusto kita with all my hypothalamus"" pagdating sa cinematog. Regarding sa discussion of abortion, medyo closer sa controversial indie film na ""Call Jane"".",3

Sunshine,"sunshine enlightened me on so many aspects of my womanhood that i feel like i haven't been able to sit down and reflect on yet. sunshine and i are different but i felt her struggle with not knowing what to do with what was going on in her body, and not wanting to disappoint the women and family who have built her up to reach her dream that is now at risk. i knew how it felt to have female friendships i turned to for support and strength, and how heartbreaking it is to lose them. so many scenes made me tear up because of how much it felt like it could really happen and how much it does happen. there are relatives that talk like that and there are doctors that have to risk their license to do exactly what a doctor should do. each theme and character was so intentionally and realistically portrayed that it all made sense, even to the part of my mind that plays devil's advocate when it comes to films like this.sunshine really is a must-watch for everyone para ma-gets mo na.ang galing tlga ng cast bruh",-1

Sunshine,"Some people are just born to be filmmakers—with the eye, the voice, and the sophistication to tell a story. And Antoinette Jadaone is definitely one of them.I really loved how Manila was portrayed here. It perfectly captures what it feels like to be an adolescent navigating this chaotic city. As someone who spent their coming-of-age years in Manila, it hit so close to home. I could smell and feel every shot—sobrang kuha.",-1

Sunshine,"“How do women fight for body autonomy in a society where belief dictates decision and patriarchy gets the final say?”Reproductive health is an underseen issue in this country and I hope this film furthers the advocacy of its importance. A career-best performances by Racal and Garcia; siblings whom were failed by the system but perseveres from their own empowerment.My theatre went dead silent when the credits rolled and thats when you know when a film hits too close to home, whether by own experience or a witness to anothers.",34
Sunshine,"Easily one of my favorite Filipino films of all time. Beautiful cinematography (iniisip ko pa lang pano nila shinoot yung Quiapo scenes sumasakit na ulo ko), and masterfully-produced. Maris was amazing. That was the type of performance that gets people to forget na cheater ka sa totoong buhay kasi mas malaking issue yung tinatackle dito—and mas important tbh",9

Sunshine,"SUNSHINE (2024)3.8/5 SAME, ARIANA… She’s a main biàtch!! HAHAHAHA GETS KO NA!! Isa sa mga pinakapulidong gawa ni Direk Tonet. Ka-EME represent, alongside “Never Not Love You” & the iconic “Beauty In A Bottle” and “That Thing Called Tadhana.” Maris Racal literally emanated Sunshine!! She’s a ray of sunshine. This film is really for her. I didn’t know who else can bring Sunshine to life than her. & ANNIKA CO & JENNICA GARCIA…. ACTING MASTERCLASS!! MY FAVES IN ONE FRAME!! THE Xyriel Manabat could’ve been maximized more kasi halimaw sa actingan masterclass, but I think she had a proper exit. It is a delight to see Ms. Angeli Bayani’s presence contrary to her former portrayals. Her character only appeared for how many seconds, BUT THE IMPACT OF HER EXPOSURE IS OVER THE TOP!! Ang nagpalaylay sa storyline is not the open ending, but a rushed conclusion of the problem. Nasagot nga ba ang problema? Anong nangyari kina Miggy at Sunshine? Is ‘Ari-yun-uh’ also a personification that Sunshine only imagine, like Annika’s character? Hindi ko maramdaman ang father and son dynamic nina Elijah Canlas and Mr. Piolo Pascual. However, Piolo’s character, as Pastor Jaime could’ve been explained and discovered more, and not pressed in a few minute exposure. What stood out in the film were Maris, Jennica, Annika, and “Ariana”‘s portrayal. Also, Sunshine, due to her juvenile age, can be prone to misconception and misinformation. In a predominantly Catholic country wherein proper sex education and proper healthcare system are nowhere to be found, and practices are dictated by religion and morality, relying on social media platforms as search engines would mean that she’s susceptible to wrong notions of her reality, which may lead her to resort to the sudden decisions that she make. The debate between religion and choice is long-going in the Philippine context. If the international audiences accepted this film with open arms, it’s about time that the Philippines does the same, and the film’s message would transgress to those without an open mind and for those who are unawakened with the harsh realities that most “Sunshine” faces.",-1
Sunshine,"Manila in its rawest form. I was teary eyed through the whole movie but something in the scenes always felt lacking. And then I remembered some actual close friends who were once in the same situation, who once asked for my help and company. That what they actually needed was people who would understand and hear them and not who would feel bad for them. This did not intend to resolve anything, cos we have been seeing this in real life and in the news. But this was a good reminder that after all these headlines, after all the movies that tackled the same story, and after all the social media awareness, IS IT’S STILL A PERSISTING PROBLEM FOR MANY FILIPINO CHILDREN AND WOMEN. That we have still yet to save these women, that our authorities still don’t care, and these women are still in danger. MALALA ANG HEALTHCARE, MALALA RIN ANG JUDGMENT! I’m pro-choice because I advocate for a world where children could be children and play freely and grow old and love the life that’s ahead of them. I LOVE YOU SUNSHINE FRIENDS! Your reasons will die with me <3",-1

Sunshine,"Recently, I’ve been craving for a film with a film fest vibe and this was exactly it. It tackles a deeply serious issue often handled delicately in PH mainstream.

Did not mothered. And sobrang nacomfort ako ng character ni Jennica Garcia: we all deserve someone like her.Story-wise, okay siya sakin and I appreciate yung plot driver na pinili nila. More importantly, nahighlight sa international community kung anong klaseng healthcare meron tayo dito sa Pinas and yung belief ng general Filipino public when it comes to healthcare, women’s right to their bodies, and abortion.WOMEN DESERVE TO FUCKING CHOOSE WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR BODIES.

Sunshine,"Ito ang ibig kong sabihin kapag sinasabi kong may problematic pattern sa ilang pelikula. Layunin nito ay marahil ipakita ang pinakamasalimuot na kalagayan ng ating lipunan, subalit nauuwi lagi sa paggamit ng trauma at karahasan bilang device lamang. Sa paraang ito, yumuyugto ang kawalan ng respeto sa lived experiences ng mga biktima. Sunshine, however, is not that kind of film.Sa halip na pagsamantalahan ang lunan ng karanasan ng mga kababaihan, pinili ng pelikula na maging mapanagot. It is a story about women, in a world that constantly tries to pin them and to deny them full autonomy and diginity for themselves. Naging maingat at makatao si Direk Tonet sa treatment niya rito sa Sunshine. Hindi niya sinensationalize ang karahasan, bagkus ginawa ito nang may paggalang. Inilantad ang katotohanan pero hindi iniwan sa dulo ang mga biktima at maging ang mga manonood. In this film, we see a woman who is brave. A woman who insists on choosing for herself. A woman who, despite everything, claims her shine. To Sunshine, and to many sunshines out there: ang sinag ninyo ay magmumula sa inyo lamang. Hindi ito hinihiram, hindi ito ibinibigay, sa inyo ito at sa inyo lamang. Kasi gaano man kadilim ang lipunan sa atin, women will always be the brightest. ",6
Sunshine,"Film got me walking around deep in thought after. That was raw, painful, and beautiful. Just like being a mother and also choosing not to be one.",-1
Sunshine,"Sometimes, a film that can make you happy isn't a light one, but a film that can make you feel a lot of things, make you cry than 5x while watching it, then leave you feel satisfied and hopeful near the end.

Magkakaiba ng kwento pero pinagkapareho nila ay babae ang laging talo sa kwento. Higit sa pasanin nila sa buhay dahil sa pagbubuntis. Dala rin nila yung panghuhusga ng mga tao. Lalabas na malaki ang tyan e, masasabihan ng malandi, mapusok o disgrayada. Dala rin ng babae yung hirap na pisikal, mental at pinansyal ng pagbubuntis. Habang ang nakabuntis sa kanila - madalas buhay binata na. Walang dalang kahit anong bakas ng kahihiyan. Isa rin sa pinaka nalulungkot ako, ay pansamatalang hihinto ang buhay ng mga pangarap ng batang ito para magbigay daan sa dinadala niya. Hindi lahat ng babae ay may privilege na makapag aral muli o mapursige ang pangarap nila pagkatapos magkaanak.Hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas. Hirap maging babae.Laging talo sa mundo di tayo kinakampihan.Sana mapanuod pa ng mas madami. Safe and accessible option for abortion sa Pinas isulong na.",3

Sunshine,"Nauso na sa mga Pinoy viewers na hihintayin na lang nila sa Netflix yung mga pelikulang Pilipino. Para raw makatipid. Pero karamihan sa kanila, willing gumastos kapag Western superhero movie ang papanoorin. Gets naman din kasi nga may escapism kapag sinasalba ni Superman o ng Fantastic Four ang New York City kumpara sa mga realist stories sa Pilipinas. Bat nga naman kailangan ng malaking screen para lang makitang nag-aaway si Dingdong Dantes at Charo Santos?Pero please, panoorin niyo ang mga pelikulang Pilipino sa big screen, lalo na yung may magandang istorya na maaaring magbigay-linaw pa sa mga isyu. Tulad na lang ng Sunshine ni Antoinette Jadaone. Tungkol ito kay Sunshine (Maris Racal) na naghahanap ng paaran na magpa-abort dahil sa napakaraming rason: hindi planado ang kanyang pagbubuntis, ayaw siyang panagutan ng nakabuntis sa kanya, ayaw na siyang samahan ng kanyang kaibigan, pagtsi-tsismisan siya, at mauudlot ang kanyang pangarap na maging Olympian. Sa dami ng kanyang rason, simple lang naman ang kanyang dahilan: ayaw pa niya maging nanay.Ito ang unang Pinoy film na napanood ko na talagang sinusulong ang karapatan ng babae para sa kanyang katawan. At sa dami ng pinagdaanan ni Sunshine, kahit na may reservations ka sa isyu ng abortion, gugustuhin mong matupad ang gusto ng ating bida. Ramdam na ramdam ko kay Maris ang mga dinadalang problema ni Sunshine hindi lamang bilang isang aspiring Olympian kundi ang isang pagiging babae sa Pilipinas kung saan malakas ang impluwensya ng Catholic values sa ating mga batas.Intersectional din ang pagtalakay ni Jadaone sa isyu ng abortion sa Sunshine. Hindi ito basta-bastang women's rights na nakita natin sa Western media tulad ng Barbie (2024) at Sex Education (2019-2023). Hindi itinanggi o dinemonize ng pelikula ang Catholic guilt pero hinimay ito sa pamamagitan ng pag-humanize nito sa anyo ng batang babae na sumusunod kay Sunshine (Annika Co). Ang ganda ng chemistry nina Maris at Annika at ramdam mong iisa lang talaga sila.So, bakit nga ba dapat panoorin ang Sunshine sa sinehan imbes na hintayin sa Netflix o ano mang streaming service? Napakalalim ng isyu ng aborsyon at women's rights na dapat bigyan ito ng full attention. Pag naman nanonood tayo sa streaming service, may tendency tayong mag-check ng phone. Pero hindi dapat tayo ma-distract habang pinapanood natin si Sunshine. Pag naman sobrang intimidating yung scene, pwede nating i-pause. Pero sa mga ganitong storya, dapat hindi ito pina-pause. Ma-disturb dapat tayo sa ganitong kwento.",6

Hindi ko naman gustong agawin sa kanila 'yong kalayaan nilang maniwala sa diyos, gusto ko lang maintindihan nilang nakakapahamak ng katauhan ang pagtatanggi ng nararapat na serbisyong medikal sa ngalan ng relihiyon. Gusto ko maintindihan kung saan ako nanggagaling, kung bakit ganito na lamang ang kalampag ng kabataan patungkol sa sex education at hindi lamang dahil gusto naming lumandi.Napakaraming layers. Gustong-gusto ko yung irony na sa ospital pa rin tayo tumatakbo kahit na alam nating ikakapahamak nating gawin 'yon. Dahil iyon naman talaga ang tungkulin ng ospital--- ang pagalingin ka, ang alagaan ka, ang pagtuunan ng pansin ang iyong awtonomiya at pangangailangan.

I literally got chills and cried when she entered the Inn.What struck me the most is how the film doesn’t romanticize pain it shows the truth as it is. Sunshine’s journey feels real and vulnerable and it makes you think about how every decision carries weight and responsibility. The use of her future child as a reminder of her choices was powerful and emotional.The film speaks about rights, life and the struggles of women how society pressures them while they’re just trying to survive and live freely. It’s a story that stays with you long after the credits roll. The best ka, Maris Racal!",-1
Sunshine,"salamat sa pelikula mo, direk tonet!! may dahilan na naman ako para magpabaga pa ng galit sa pagiging patriarchal ng pilipinas, at sa mga walang kwentang lalaki!!!",0
Sunshine,"Grabe, Maris and Direk Tonet were amazing! Sunshine is such a brave film—it really shows the struggle of not having a choice. And to have this kind of story shown here in the Philippines? Tapang!",12
Sunshine,"Sobrang tapang ni Direk Tonet for this masterpiece This is a strong script and one of my fav Filipino movie this year, I truly love this. Hardwork = Heartwork talaga, proud na proud ako as an aries woman. I watched this alone and muntikan na kami mag share ng tissue ng katabi ko na di ko naman kilala. ‘Sunshine’ glows even brighter in a country that dims women’s light. ",-1
Sunshine,teh di ako makahinga buong film,-1
Sunshine,shared pinay experience na magbreakdown sa jeep,-1
Sunshine,"This film touched me in ways I could never have imagined.It truly reflected the struggles of women seeking to abort their unborn children. In a country where Catholicism dominates, even in law, abortion is viewed as taboo and a sin against the Lord Almighty, rather than as a procedure that can preserve someone's mental health and offer a way to escape the endless economic hardships we face.It’s heartbreaking how inaccessible abortion is here. So many people end up resorting to dangerous methods just to find the peace they desperately need.The plot twists kept me on the edge of my seat—I absolutely loved this film.",5
Sunshine,Wow! Just caught myself staring at awe in the cinema after the film.,8
Sunshine,wait lang hinga muna ko,0
Sunshine,"the first half of this movie is the most stressed i have EVER been in a cinema. the portrayal of how loud, crowded, and messy manila is, is perfect for enhancing sunshine's emotions. because of that, everything feels so REAL. when they revealed that the little kids were the kids that would've been born, i thought for a second, ""oh no they might keep the baby."" and ofc, it's great to see that they didn't. but the way they did…",-1
Sunshine,“gets ko na.”,-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is Antoinette Jadaone’s best work to date, with Maris Racal’s incredible acting chops as a cherry on top on an already well-written script, emotionally gripping plot, and beautiful cinematography. The film does not shy away from talking about a lot of pertinent topics on womanhood, abuse, neglect, access to healthcare, and self-determination without overloading the audience with information. I particularly liked how the film utilized a young child as Sunshine’s consciousness in the flesh, reflecting whether or not to…",-1
Sunshine,"Never doubt this movie when I first watched the trailer last yr!!! Indie films are indeed the best films. About the movie and story itself, grabe sobrang totoo at sobrang galing ng pagkakagawa, well Antoinette Jadaone lang naman diba?? But also Maris Racal????? gurllllll she's giving sa movie na 'to!! Sobrang deserve nito na mapanood ng maraming pilipino at magkaroon ng recognition!!",8
Sunshine,Yayanigin ka ng pelikulang ito ni Jadaone. Imposibleng hindi mo bisitahin at kuwestiyunin ang pananaw ng marami tungkol sa konsepto ng aborsyon matapos mong mapanood ang mga eksenang salamin ng itinatangging riyalidad sa bansa.,3
Sunshine,gets ko na. tangina maris galing mo!!,0
Sunshine,brave movie(watch kayooo!! only 3 cinemas na lang by july 30),6
Sunshine,"unsettling, uncomfortable, and necessary. I appreciate that Sunshine was a little hard to watch; it goes to show that a country heavily influenced by religion, handled with corruption and obsolete data and methods, women are often left with no safe choices. The storytelling included no gloss, no overdramatizing—just harsh realities of what women in the Philippines face. Acting of the whole ensemble was solid and effective, but at the center of it is, Maria Racal, delivered an impressive performance across the board.Also, FUCK MEN!! Men are really pigs!!",-1
Sunshine,MARIS RACAL. ANTONETTE JADAONE. that's it. that's the review!,10
Sunshine,maria racal ate pero i have to ask na if sunshine is literally a gold medalist why isnt she treated like royalty or with all the benefits like yulo?? or ample media coverage? like thatd be a big deal i would be glazing tf out of her if she was my classmate,17
Sunshine,MARIS RACAL YOU ARE TAKING THE OSCAR!!! ,1
Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone, gets ko na. Took me a minute to pause, reflect, and absorb the film with all of it. The power of the film is the way it presents and tackles about womanhood and abortion. How Jadaone, shows, and you get it without needing the tell part.Every woman in the film is amazingly presented. From the coach, doctor, sister, and teenager. I’m giving injustice and lackluster narrative of how powerful, impactful, and lustrous the film is. Each frame is enthralling, given Maris’ powerful performance and how raw Manila is portrayed. You take it as it is. The mess, powering through the noise, and living it all every single day.The film also presents a huge middle finger to the hypocrisy of abortion and religion and how the only time Sunshine (Maris) felt free from her prison, which I must say is visually and creatively presented in the film is through her passion as a gymnast. Will try and revise this to write a cohesive review, but definitely glad I got the opportunity to watch this at the cinema.",-1
Sunshine,relevant and real,1
Sunshine,"either may kakilala kang parang si sunshine, or muntik nang maging si sunshine, or baka muntik ka nang maging si sunshine, or ikaw mismo si sunshine. or, you know, nanood ka lang at may naramdaman. at okay lang rin yun.yung gusto ko na ginawa ng pelikula ay na-explore niya yung delusyon ng unborn child ng isang babae. para sa akin ay innate feminine thing ito-- nagpapakita sila minsan sa panaginip. nagpakita yung akin sa isang panaginip. natakot ako. to have that fear manifest itself as this metaphysical, illusionary child that follows you around when faced with an unwanted pregnancy is so poignant and sickening. pasan talaga ng babae ang mundo dahil ang sarili niyang pag-iisip ay kinakalaban ng katawan niya. ng utak niya. and maybe that's why na-appreciate ko yung approach ng pelikula at ng writer-director na gamitin yung speaking-unborn-child motif na favorite ng mga pro-lyfers because to make someone see or understand something, you have to speak their language. may constant negotiation ang pelikula with its audience. take me seriously, pls, hear me out. wag mong tatanggalin ang mata mo sa screen. umiyak ka. sabing umiyak ka! and you know what, it closed the deal come the final show. i just wish it didn't end with that ""gets ko na"" line. nitpicky lang ako pero feel ko talaga mas maganda kung sa isang tanong siya nag end tapos final bow niya. wala naman kasi talagang makakaintindi sa buong sitwasyon mo, sunshine. matapang ka. nahihirapan ka. nararamdaman namin yun. but no one will ever understand how it feels until you are in that position.",3
Sunshine,"that motel scene is a horror movie in itself. loved the movie, loved the message. though as someone who gets easily distracted by bad acting, they could’ve chosen kid actors who can actually act.",-1
Sunshine,gets mo ba ‘ko?,38
Sunshine,I literally watched Sunshine on a cloudy day. Love it.,2
Sunshine,"for once there's no film that quite match what Sunshine did to me, emotionally. an absolute knockout in terms of its concept of bringing controversial topics about abortion and the struggle women face in search for accessible healthcare in the philippines on screen. it's rare to find films that touch most of the pressing issues in our culture, society, politics, and even in reproductive health. this was by far the most distressing and deeply harrowing depiction of teenage pregnancy i've watched since never rarely sometimes always. i'm on the edge of my seat the whole time. sobrang ganda na halos ako nakilabutan at napaiyak sa sudden escalation of events. must watch huhu.Ang tunay na sining ay nagsasalamin sa totoong pangyayari sa buhay, at ang pelikulang ito, ang pelikulang Sunshine, ay nagsisilbing patunay na buhay na buhay ang sining nating mga Pilipino.",-1
Sunshine,"A HORROR FILM FOR FILIPINAS AS WE WATCH THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR HELPLESSNESS AND LACK OF CHOICES REGARDING OUR BODIES, OUR LIVES!!!",-1
Sunshine,"Women are frequently placed in situations where they feel they have no choices due to the regressive and harsh judgment of society regarding our rights, particularly our right to safe healthcare. Sunshine, as a whole, has stood firm in its mission, showing why such story is important, as women continue to endure the repercussions of societal choices that place us in jeopardy. This film is undoubtedly one of those that was treated with so much care, showing little to no romanticization of the anger and struggles the characters faced, and most importantly, it did not conform to conservative ideologies.Maris Racal is definitely an actress to keep an eye on; her artistry and commitment to her craft shine through in this film. She certainly delivered one of the most valiant depictions of women in cinema, and it felt just right for her to bring the character of Sunshine to life.And of course, Antoinette Jadaone, who consistently brings depth and authenticity to her female characters, has done it again. As many have said, while anyone can create sociopolitical films, having women write and direct them adds a special touch that connects us to our shared struggles. Jadaone knows exactly how to write her female characters, and there’s nothing more beautiful than a woman who values the lives, journeys, successes, and struggles of her fellow women. Ultimately, as the film shows, it’s women who always end up caring for one another. May we live in a lifetime where abortion is decriminalized and seen as a fundamental aspect of healthcare for every woman, ensuring that no woman ever has to confront death or risk her life due to circumstances that leave her with no choice.",-1
Sunshine,ABANTE BABAE!,1
Sunshine,"it feels like watching social media debates on abortion come to life. it covers familiar arguments, from “what if the baby could be a future president” to real situations like abuse, unplanned pregnancies, and women not ready for motherhood. seeing it unfold makes the issue hit harder than words alone.it also calls out how both religion and close minded people can push views that ignore lived experiences. i loved how the possible future children were portrayed, like the little girl who acts just like sunshine, or the “tomboy’s” child being gay. the scenes felt real yet creative, and maris’s acting was excellent.",-1
Sunshine,"took me some time to process that a filipino movie about a stigmatized issue was watched by a full theater (that included gen x/boomers!) even when 2 big hollywood films were screening too. this almost never happens to our indie films. props to the team for carefully crafting this. it won’t easily change people’s minds, sure, but it opens up conversations about long-hidden stories of struggle. that’s better than nothing.",9
Sunshine,"Wala akong sapat na karanasan para makipagdiskusyon ukol sa screenplay, sa directing, sa musical scoring, o sa writing ng pelikulang 'to. Pero dahil matapang na inilahad ni Direk Tonet ang kwento ng sangkababaihan, naiparamdam niya sa akin na sapat ang kaalaman ko para maintindihan ang gusto niyang iparating. Nasaksihan ko ang pelikulang isinulat hindi para mamilit, ngunit para magkwento.Para ito sa lahat ng naging ate, coach, menggay, doc helen, at iba pang kababaihan sa pelikula na nagpapatatag ng isang pagkatao sa mapanghusgang mundo. Mga babaeng nagpapadali sa mga karanasan ng kapwa kababaihan. Higit sa lahat, para ito sa iba pang mga Sunshine na piniling makawala sa pinaghalo-halong boses ng prinsipyo, moralidad, paniniwala, at kristiyanismo, para piliin ang pangarap niya.Kung iisipin, iisang Maynila ang nilalakaran, nasasaksihan, dinarasalan, at pinupuntahan natin. Pero iba’t-ibang buhay at konsepto ang pinaniniwalaan ng bawat kaluluwang minsan nang nanatili dito.Sa pagkilala ng mga babaeng piniling ialis ang kapit niya sa limitado at panandaliang kalayaan na ibinibigay ng sistemang ito, at sa panonood ng pelikula kahit hindi ikaw si Sunshine, sana maintindihan mo.",3
Sunshine,"Tumatak sakin yung laging sinasabi ni coach kay sunshine, drown out the noise.Kaya sa tuwing may scene na tumatahimik, walang music, walang background noise, walang dialogue, di ko mapigilan maging emotional.Pati yung mga ibang cast, si jennica, xyriel, meryll, si doc elena. Di makakaya ni sunshine pag wala sila, kapwa babae lang makakaintindi sa problema niya.And si Maris? Gago tangina ang galing.",-1
Sunshine,"this movie is just so sad. ang lungkot kasi ang dali lang sabihin na mali ang ganito ganyan pero they never look at the one who will carry it, yung ""maiistuck"" habang buhay doon. sabi pa ng pinsan ko after movie, dapat panindigan nya yon kase ginusto naman nya yon tsaka inofferen naman sya nung *SPOILER ALERT* father nung guy na sila ng family nya magpoprovide para doon sa kid hanggang sa mag-18 tapos ipagpatuloy na lang ni sunshine yung gusto nyang gawin sa buhay pero girl ??! hindi naman after mailabas yung baby pwede nya na iwan yon, its a lifetime responsibility and we dont know na after ba ng lahat ng to she would get the same opportunities that she have now, na 2 months na lang makukuha nya na yung winork nya all her life? ang hirap lang kase iaccept at intindihin na ang daling magblame ng society sa mga babae, husgahan sila, pakialaman yung buhay nila, ang dali lang na ilagay sila sa isang kahon kung saan hanggang doon lang dapat sila kasi kapag hindi parang sobrang sama nila pero pag lalaki kahit ano na lang e no.ps. lalaki rin nagsabi nyang pinsan ko pati mga lalaki sa movie na to nakakasura magsama sama mga lalaking ang liliit ng utak",6

Sunshine,"oh Maris MOTHAFUCKIN Racal !!!!!this is not the first time direk tonet explored this kind of raw, intimate storytelling—and tbh, i wasn't fully convinced then, but sunshine got thru to me. the women of this film gave such gut-wrenching performances that it's impossible not to feel their pain (and strength). what a painful reminder that women deserve so much, yet get so little. i hope more people see this film para ma-gets na rin nila.",-1
Sunshine,"Dreams carry a powerful force—one that can drive people beyond the bounds of their morals. In the film Sunshine, this force is embodied by a young gymnast, whose ambition, fueled by society’s expectations of fame, pushes her to the edge—physically, psychologically, and morally—as she struggles with the weight of success and an unplanned pregnancy. Surrounding her are characters who reflect and intensify this tension: a doctor torn between personal ethics and the responsibility of helping an abortion patient; a street vendor selling both faith and death, caught in her own contradictions; a friend navigating the rift between her parents’ choices and her own agency; and a coach who, in relentlessly pushing her to break physical limits, unknowingly drives her toward moral collapse. The film offers a counterpoint through the voice of a child—a quiet yet powerful presence that serves as both an echo of the gymnast’s inner conscience and a projection of the expectations society imposes on her. This voice becomes a haunting reminder of who she is and who she is expected to be, grounding her in an innate moral compass even as she’s pulled deeper into chaos, anxiety, and confusion.Sunshine presents a world where the pursuit of dreams comes at a cost, and where ambition blurs the lines between resilience and ruin.",17

Sunshine,"        Usually, yung mga movie reviews ko nasa FB/IG stories ko lang but this movie deserves space on my feed.Relevant. Truthful. Brave.Simply the best Pinoy film of 2025 so far. To think na Marvel's Fantastic Four ang kasabay na pelikula nito sa sinehan, nagulat ako na puno yung sinehan na pinanuoran namin sa SM City North EDSA. Buti nalang, wala sya nung classic ""Pinoy 3rd act curse"" like Kathryn Bernardo's A Very Good Girl. Actually, the last act pa nga ang strongest part of the film.This is the kind of conversation na kailangan talaga natin pag usapan -- reproductive rights, lack of access to quality healthcare, and so much more.I hope mas marami pa ang makapanuod nitong movie na 'to.

Sunshine,Important and beautiful. Sobrang galing mo Maris! This is Jadaone’s best work to date.,-1
Sunshine,Mga kabataan ngayon di makapagpigil.Sabi ng bantay sa botika na buntis.I like any movie that utilizes metaphors to emphasize the severity of a situation. I think Annika's character was such an important part of the movie—despite others saying it downplayed the severity of the situation since it was a whimsical concept—since it brought contrast as well as a different but important point of view in such a controversial topic.,23
Sunshine,"4.5/5I think this is one of those films that I will not just 100% get—not because it was badly written or executed—rather, it is such a lived experience (even phenomenological) that is scathing, intense, and too real.But Jadaone & Maris Racal (and the whole ensemble!) made this film so empathetic, bold, and brave to actually tackle and make you realize what the social reality is. The collective Filipino religious trauma, poverty, crime, the lack of accessible healthcare—it's all encompassing with Sunshine's experience (and to all Filipinas as well).Gets kita, Sunshine. Ang pangarap mo ay pangarap ko rin.",-1

Sunshine,"i find it hard to explain the experience of watching Sunshine it left me with a heavy heart, a quiet kind of ache, and a deep reflection. pero isang bagay ang malinaw, mahirap maging babae lalo na sa mundong paulit-ulit kinukuwestyon ang iyong mga desisyon, ang iyong halaga, at ang iyong tinig.kaya i have so much admiration for Direk Tonet and the entire team behind Sunshine for their boldness and honesty. it takes real courage to create a film that confronts the silences, the shame, and the societal fears around topics we often push aside especially in a country like ours where conservatism still tries to drown out stories like these. despite the progress we’ve made as a society, there are still so many walls around conversations that women desperately need to have.as a woman, i felt seen. i felt understood. and more importantly, i felt less alone. Sunshine gives voice to the quiet suffering that many Filipinas carry stories of pain, confusion, guilt, and survival. it doesn’t offer simple answers, but it offers empathy. and that’s powerful.i hope more Filipinos get to watch this film, not just to be entertained, but to really listen. to open their hearts and minds to the struggles of women they may not fully understand. i hope it challenges them to reflect, to unlearn, and to care more deeply about the rights and realities of women.sana magets niyo rin",-1

Sunshine,"How does a young woman endure a life filled with “faithfuls” who feel morally superior to judge and ridicule her choices in a society riddled with antiquated beliefs, further magnified by patriarchal politics where men can walk away without responsibilities and consequences? How do you thrive when institutions that are supposed to protect you are trying to pin you down? Maris Racal shines as the titular character Sunshine, hindi sumosobra o kinukulang, raw, honest, perfectly capturing a young woman in turmoil while trying to show a facade that everything is okay. She is supported by an amazing cast: Annika Co, Elijah Canlas, Xyrel Manabat, Piolo Pascual, Rhed Bustamante, and the most affecting performance of Jennica Garcia.This film captures the gritty essence of Manila without being patronizing or didactic. Each frame is filled with ironies: abortion drugs sold beside a church, a repeated shot of split windows showing dreams, chaos, judgement, and slivers of kindness. One shot in particular shows Sunshine rehearsing at home, on the split side are young people probably coming home from a fun night, kasi bata lang naman si Sunshine and she is willing to sacrifice everything for her dreams, at napakarami pang tulad niya, lahat sila hindi napapakinggan. Listen, read, learn, resist until every woman has autonomy over her body.Drown out the noises, lift your head, close your eyes, and let your light pull you through.",7
Sunshine,"“gets mo na ‘ko?” id like to believe that the kid was a depiction of sunshine’s conscience and its such a powerful statement to put out there — that sunshine didnt have anyone to convince but herself. that its okay as long as the choice was hers and not anyone else’s, especially in a society that often robs women the decision to make a choice in the first place.and despite the loud and often guilt-ridden noises that paralleled the packed and polluted streets of manila, it contested the catholic and cis-heteropatriarchal belief that the sole purpose of womanhood is motherhood and to choose to become someone else is to sin. but sunshine wouldn’t have come through all odds if it weren’t also for the women in her life that chose to show up for her. the only thing more powerful than the dangers that women are constantly subjected to, are the embrace of fellow women who just understand it. sunshine didn’t even have to utter a single word, her silence, both in her vulnerable and fearless moments, was heard. the quiet glances between her and thea, reassuring her that she is seen. her sister’s arms reaching out to her in bed, making her presence known and reminding sunshine that she’d never be alone, the gentle squeeze of menggay’s hands to let her know she’s safe. they all heard and seen each other, and having someone who’s willing to carry and share your burden with is enough for everything else to be bearable. gets na gets kita Sunshine, at sana mas marami pang mga pilipino ang makarinig at makaintindi sa’yo at sa kuwento mo.",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine tells the story of a 19-year-old gymnast pursuing her dream of making it to the national team to compete in the SEA Games and eventually, the Olympics until a life-altering event changes everything.Ito marahil ang isa sa pinakamahalagang pelikulang Pilipino ngayong taon, o baka pati na rin sa buong dekada. Hindi ito nagpaligoy-ligoy sa layunin nitong maglahad ng katotohanan masakit man ito o hindi.Unang tumatak sa akin ang pangalang Antonette Jadaone noong napanood ko ang That Thing Called Tadhana. Mula noon, sinusubaybayan ko na ang kanyang mga pelikula maging ito man ay romcom, crime, psychological, o political. Siya at si Direk Dan Villegas ay palaging may tatak: may kirot, may kurot, at higit sa lahat, may lalim.Ang Sunshine ay isang napapanahong pelikula na nagsisilbing mitsa para sa mahahalagang diskusyon: ang kalagayan ng mga atleta sa bansa, ang sistemang pangkalusugan at pang-edukasyon, pananampalataya, gender roles, at higit sa lahat, ang karapatan ng kababaihan sa sariling katawan.Madalas nating marinig: “Ang anak ay biyaya.” Pero kailan nga ba ito nagiging biyaya? Kailan naman ito nagiging pasanin? Ang isang pagbubuntis ba sa murang edad ay dapat tawaging biyaya, lalo na kung ito ay dumating sa panahong hindi pa handa ang isang babae? O isa itong uri ng sumpa, bunga ng sistemang mapanghusga?Hindi laging pisikal ang pang-aabuso sa kababaihan. Minsan, ito ay nasa anyo ng mga ideolohiyang pinipilit ipalunok sa kanila. Kapag inagaw mo ang kakayahan nilang magdesisyon para sa sarili nilang katawan, para sa kinabukasan nila, para sa mga pangarap nila, iyon ay anyo ng pang-aabuso.Wala nang mas akmang gumanap bilang Sunshine kundi si Maris Racal. Ang kanyang pagganap ay puno ng puso’t tapang mula sa kanyang mga sulyap, bawat paghinga, hanggang sa mga katahimikan niya sa ilang eksena. Nararamdaman mo ang kanyang sakit, pangarap, at takot. Isa ito sa mga pinakamahusay na performance ng isang aktres sa kasalukuyang panahon.Ang buong ensemble cast ay maingat na pinili mula kina Elijah Canlas, Meryll Soriano, Jennica Garcia, Annika Co, Rhed Bustamante, Xyriel Manabat hanggang sa mga may limitadong eksena ngunit tumatak: Juan Miguel Garcia, Madeleine Nicolas, Angeli Bayani, at Piolo Pascual. Bawat karakter ay may silbi sa masalimuot ngunit malinaw na salaysay ni Sunshine.Ang pelikulang ito ay malakas, matapang, at mapanghamon. Hindi ito madaling kalimutan. Hindi kami agad nakatayo matapos ang closing credits hindi dahil baka may post-credit scene kundi dahil ninanamnam pa namin ang bigat ng mensahe nito.Sa huli, isang malaking saludo kay Direk Tonet Jadaone. Maraming salamat sa liwanag at lakas ng Sunshine. Sa panahong maraming gustong manahimik, pinili mong magsalita. Mabuhay ka, Direk!Rating:  (5/5 - unanimous)",17
Sunshine,Men are trash,22
Sunshine,"God forbid a woman chooses herself.Sunshine is a film I recommend every woman in my life to see—yes, also those who belong to the earlier generations. How I wish a film like this existed when I was around Sunshine's age. This film isn't just about teenage pregnancy and women's reproductive rights. It's also about courage and knowing oneself better than anyone can. I wish any girl who's forced to choose between herself and other people's plans for her—no matter how more reasonable they are—gets to realize it's not a sin to pick the former, especially if it leads to a more purposeful life for her. And with this, I also hope that the girls who do so, gets to have the same support system Sunshine has. I am a woman.I get to choose the life I want for me.I am not a baby-making machine.I am more than my womanly traits.Mahal kita, Sunshine, at gets kita.",-1
Sunshine,first filipino movie watched in tje cinema,9
Sunshine,about time :)RRL: pls watch 12 weeks,24
Sunshine,"FOR THE ANTI’S:ABORTION IS NOT A FUCKING ACT OF MURDER. IT’S THE SOCIETY WHO CONTINUOUSLY LET THE WOMEN SUFFER FROM ABUSE, CONTROL AND MANIPULATION FROM THESE FUCKING MEN WHO KNOWS DAMN NOTHING ABOUT A FEMALE’S REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND SEES IT AS HIS TOY! MEN ARE THE FUCKING MURDERER. YOU ARE THE MURDERER.",4
Sunshine,"This movie is really brave, especially in a country where abortion is illegal. It’s not trying to glorify anything. It simply shows how brave women’s choices are. This is how real filmmaking should be, honest and unafraid to tell life’s difficult stories.",5

Sunshine,"Sunshine (2025, Project 8 Projects)I acknowledge that there are a lot of things in life I take for granted as a cisgender man. In Antoinette Jadaone’s new film, Sunshine, she presents a flawed yet heartbreaking tale on the female cost of pregnancy.In the film, we follow nineteen-year-old Sunshine, who has dedicated most of her life, along with the support of her sister who was also a former gymnast, in rhythmic gymnastics and her pursuit to enter the Philippine team for the Olympics. However, several weeks before the National tryouts, Sunshine discovers that she got pregnant after a recent sexual encounter with her boyfriend.Stepping out of the theater, I realized how it’s so hard to be a woman, not just in the Philippines but in general. And pregnancy, one of the human experiences that only a cisgender woman can experience, and how much it impacts on their health, emotions, and even their dreams or aspirations - especially when it happens completely unplanned. All of these are further amplified in the situation here in the Philippines where sexual education is still not a priority, access to quality maternal care is expensive, and role of religion to beset unfair expectations towards women.Despite having a strong message, there are things in Sunshine that I wish had been improved on. I must admit I felt a bit cheated out because the movie was initially hyped as a sports movie focusing on gymnastics - the same way Rookie did for volleyball, but in the end was more of a character drama that whose lead character is a gymnast. I wish that Jadaone delved deeper on Sunshine’s motivations on why gymnastics is important to her because at how the story was written, Sunshine could’ve played any sport and the story would remain the same. Before I get called out, I know the movie’s true intention is a commentary on the state of female reproductive health in the Philippines, but I felt like it was just a missed opportunity to highlight the state of female sports in the Philippines, particularly gymnastics because Filipino sports movies are so rare. I also felt like that the script could’ve been tightened up a bit as the elements of magical realism introduced in the story (without going too much in spoiler territory) didn’t land as much in terms of story logic.As a follow-up to her lead starring role in 2023 movie Marupok AF, Maris Racal continues to be one of the promising actresses of her generation. And in Sunshine, she delivers one of her career best performances so far, especially at lengths her character goes through and in the dedication to train of the gymnastics segments of the story.Overall, Sunshine is not an easy watch because it doesn’t mince the hard truths of how it is living as a woman in the Philippines. And now with with the ongoing female reproductive health and sexual education discussion in the Philippines, Antoinette Jadaone offers a strong message on why it is imperative that protections for women’s health should be passed, and why the movie Sunshine deserves your time and your attention.However, irony that this movie can only be seen by a limited number of people because of its R16 rating as well as the unfair cinema practices in the Philippines, makes this even more frustrating.",17

Sunshine,gets na gets na gets na gets ko sunshine!!! sana pati ng gobyerno!!! sana pati ng mga taong sarado ang isip!!!,-1
Sunshine,"first, i’m so happy of the featured sport. since the achievements of carlos yulo, gymnastics has been rising in the country. i think we need explorations of the fields in which we actually excel, even much more from the perspective of a woman.second, this film has a scent of lino brocka’s—the journey, the road, the streets, the jeep, the buildings, the motel, the church, the stalls and stores, the hospital, the government, the people—the social realism of it all. but different to his, sunshine has its own rhythm—a never-ending going back and forth, a push and pull, a dilemma that only athletes know, only pregnants know, only women know—a jadaone rhythm.third, everything about this film is brave. sunshine is brave. women in this film are brave. the writer is brave. the director is brave. it carefully touches a taboo topic that a lot of filipinos tend to talk about in shallow means, or even a lot also do avoidance of it. but this film just keeps on going and it’s not even apologizing for it. unapologetic but with care. and that is why THIS FILM IS IMPORTANT.maris, you are indeed a sunshine.",-1

This is Maris Racal’s best project yet. She redeemed herself big time. This might be her most important role. And this IS a Jennica Garcia stan account!!! Ang galing mo te!“Gets ko na.”",-1

Sunshine,i love women! mahal na mahal ko ang pelikulang ito!,35
Sunshine,sobrang #gets,-1
Sunshine,"This film was grounded and felt real with every relatable action and reaction. I felt the pain and the fear, the uncertainty and the anxiety, the fervor and doubt. At no point did I feel the scene overstayed its welcome, it lasted just right amount of time to cause discomfort for the comfortable and comfort the uncomfortable. Sunshine stands to be a symbol for what is wrong with Philippine society (healthcare, religion, etc.) and what is right (truly loving and caring family) and could be a source of courage for the many who undergo similar situations but whose voices are drowned out and left unheard. Personally, I was moved to guilt for the parts I played in perpetuating the same problems the film emphasized.",-1
Sunshine,"sobrang galing ni maris racal, kung paano niya ginampanan ang karakter ni sunshine. sobrang tapang at husay! masasabi ko lang, salamat sa pelikulang ito.",0
Sunshine,"Grabe, ganito ang pelikula! Matapang, makabuluhan, at bumabangga sa baluktot na realidad.We need more women-centric, women-starring, and women-directed movies! Ang galing nina Maris, Direk Tonet, Jennica, Annika, Meryl Streep (eme) at ng buong cast/production.",-1
Sunshine,"""gets ko na"" and i do (godamn it) hope others would understand too....the writing, yung deliberately paglalagay ng minimal scores kasi the sound of life is its musical score (til the last act) AND..... there's no better word to say it but maris is really THAT GIRL!!!!! sobrang galing ni bakla ang LALA but gets!",0

PERO GRABHEE MS MARIS AT MADAM JENICA LITERAL NA PERFORMANCE OF A LIFETIME ANG BINIGAY!!! RESPETO SA LAHAT NGA MGA TAONG GUMAWA NG PELIKULANG ITO ESPECIALLY KAY DIREK TONET!!,6
Sunshine,"CRIMINALIZING  ABORTION  DOESN’T  MAKE  IT  GO  AWAY  IT  ONLY  MAKES  IT  UNSAFE The ph has a long way to go in terms of decriminalizing abortion and accepting it as an actual health issue but this film offers a brave and fresh perspective that needs to be seen and heard. I liked how the subject matter was tackled delicately and with intention. Very raw yung emotions and ang galing ng pag portray ni maris sa character ni sunshine. I also liked how, despite struggling alone, like most women in sunshine and mary grace’s situation, other women can still come through and support each other. Female solidarity or whatttt Also interesting take on religion and how sunshine was also religious and even repenting on her thoughts of aborting her child pero the people around her kept saying na makasalanan at mamamatay tao siya. HMMMAnd the ending !! Very satisfying and gave justice to the main character na despite her circumstances, she still achieved her dream. Thank god hindi ito yung typical na poverty porn na ang sad na nga ng nangyayari, ang sad pa ng kahahantungan. LOVED THISSSS except sayo miggy putangina mong gago ka",5

Sunshine,***,1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is emotionally raw—Sunshine bears the perspective of a dreamer that is stuck in a crossroad of choices, while proving that hope may only come with the acceptance of what’s within.Brilliance of Direk Jadaone combined with the stellar performance of a lifetime by THE Maris Racal. Jennica Garcia got that spotlight for sure.Elijah’s appearance made me realize that this is Maris’ Kalel, 15 the same way Kalel, 15 is Elijah’s Sunshine.",17
Sunshine,i’ll boldly say: one of the best Filipino films to ever exist. Run to your nearest cinema now!,9
Sunshine,"PAKSHET ANG GALING MO MARIS RACAL!sobrang makabuluhan ang gustong iparating ng pelikula. maayos ang pagkasulat, magaling din ang paglahad nito. matapang ang pelikula na talakayin ang mga bagay na hati ang opinyon ng masa, kudos to them dahil talaga namang mapupukaw ang damdamin nating mga manonood sa paraan ng kanilang pagkwento.napaka ganda rin ng mga simbolismo na naipakita sa pelikula, medyo late ko nagets yung mga bata, pero GETS KO NA! iba rin ang ipinakitang husay ng mga aktor, mula kay Maris, hanggang sa mga child actors, ramdam mo ang halaga nila. sana dumami pa ang gantong klase ng pelikula sa Pilipinas. kaya naman pala natin, sana maipagpatuloy lang.",3
Sunshine,"ANIMA ceased to exist last July 31, 2024, and this film is the last project that was ever produced by the company to be released.I’ve spent the past year trying to find meaning in such a swift demise — after all, most people prefer to go out with a bang; and I felt like we went out with the most sad, unceremonious accordion noise. But I’m glad that, a year later, Sunshine came out, a film that all things considered, is so bold and so loud and so strong in what it wants to say. Leave it to Antoinette Jadaone and Maris Racal not only to craft such a severe, yet truthful and empathetic tale, but also to rally a community to see this film. It makes me feel like we went out with a bellow, and all of our pains, struggles, and heartache with our sudden departure was heard somewhere, somehow.ANIMA was where I really grew into my own as a marketer, a coworker, and as a person. I’ll miss it dearly, but will cherish the memories forever. I’m happy Sunshine is shining brightly for us.",-1
Sunshine,super love!,-1

Sunshine,"this movie is sooo Filipino- everything from the story and the circumstances, to the taboos that need to be talked about, to the subtle sprinkle of humor. they really pulled out all the stops for this one!",9
Sunshine,This film touched many aspects in the society that could have sensitive topics which has been maximized in a span of roughly 1 1/2 hr. Deep emotions that lingers within my mind which has caused me to feel cold and feel my heart pounding due to the issues faced by some Filipinos which where held silent within their day-to-day life. Tha director has somehow lured and hypnotized me to the concept of the harsh reality that in order for the silent voices to be heard and be given solution.The metaphor of the movie was used to create a spectrum or creativity without losing its reality. One of the best movie created by a Filipino and I am one who can say that this is a masterpiece.,-1
Sunshine,gets ko na. at gets nating lahat dito sa letterboxd. sana magets din ng mga taong hindi pro-abortion.,4
Sunshine," Maris Racal delivers her most visceral performance to date — raw, quiet, devastating, Annika Co brings subtle intensity as Sunshine’s confidante, brimming with quiet guilt and Jennica Garcia anchors the story with maternal grit and emotional weight. Courage bleeds through every performance; this film demands to be seen a brutal, unflinching portrayal of abortion, rape, and systemic neglect in Philippine society every silence in the film speaks louder than dialogue; breath and ambient sound shape the mood Jadaone’s direction refuses easy comfort — every frame dares you to feel gritty visuals and handheld camera work ground the story in realism Sunshine isn’t just a movie — it’s a mirror, a gut-punch, a reckoningfavorite scene: the ""mata-mata"" scene of xyril and maris.. soundless but full of emotionsleast-liked: this is like a hard pill toswallow, theme is very heavy, but needs tobe seen to spark the conversationverdict: highly recommended, a very important film",25
Sunshine,"A gripping and sensitive depiction of the struggles faced by many young Filipino women, Sunshine portrays the reality in the Philippines regarding women's bodily autonomy, a reality marked by irony, hypocrisy, and misplaced conservatism. Maris Racal and Jennica Garcia delivered strong performances. The film is disturbing, and rightfully so.",-1

Sunshine,"Katahimikan at pagkatulala. Napakaingay ng utak ko kanina, pero walang namutawi sa aking bibig pagkatapos kong masaksihan ang pelikulang ‘to. Kulang ang isang oras para magbalik-tanaw sa kwento mo, Sunshine.Isa lamang ang tiyak kong masasabi: Ang hirap maging babae. Ang hirap galawan ng isang lipunang ikinukulong ka sa ideya na ang puwang mo sa mundo ay nakabase sa iyong sinapupunan—sa pagluluwal mo ng bata.Kapag babae ka, hindi ka pwede mangarap nang mataas. Hindi ka pwede maghangad ng magandang career. Kapag babae ka, hindi mo pwedeng piliin ang sarili mo. Kailangan ang timeline ng buhay mo ay nakaangkla sa pagbubuo ng pamilya.Hindi lahat handang maging nanay. Hindi lahat kayang maging nanay. Hindi lahat ng babae ay pipiliin maging nanay.Balang araw, nawa’y makita ng lipunang ito ang kababaihan bilang isang pwersa, bilang isang lakas. Bigyan sana ng lipunang ito ang mga kababaihan ng kalayaang lumipad at kumawala sa mga rehas na pumipigil sa pamumukadkad ng kanyang pakpak.Maraming salamat, Sunshine, sa matapang at mahusay na pagbabahagi ng iyong danas. Isa ka mang kathang-isip, ang buhay mo ay hindi nalalayo sa kasalukuyang tinatahak ng isang babae sa bansang ito.Hindi rito nagtatapos ang kwento mo. Magpapatuloy tayo, at bitbit ka ng bawat kababaihang kagaya ko—saksi sa paraan mo ng pakikibaka sa mapang-aping lipunan.Papaburan din tayo ng mundo.",3
Sunshine,"This is not just a film; this is a work of love!I love how this film came with no frills! Some social issue stories get lost in a preachy flow or oversimplication of things, but Sunshine takes us with her journey, helping each viewer understand every woman’s struggle! I am glad the film ended that way, a wonderful show of individual agency and power Congrats to the whole team!",-1

Sunshine,"Nakapanganak si Sunshine ng mga mugtong mata hindi dahil sa lungkot, pighati, o panghihinayang, ngunit dahil sa galit sa nakapanlulumong sistemang tumatalikod sa mga kababaihan. Hindi ko ito kailanman maiintindihan, pero malinaw ang mga bagaheng hindi kayang bitawan, o bitbitin ni Sunshine.Pinakapagpapasalamat kay Direk Tonet sa matapang na pagkukuwento, hindi natatakot at hindi kumakabig. Isang pelikulang isinulat mula sa puso at pakikiramay. Pati kay Maris, Annika, Jennica, Elijah, at Meryll, sa pagbibigay-buhay ng mga karakter na salamin ng marami. At sa pelikulang ito na ngayong nailabas na, hindi na natin puwedeng talikuran pa.Dahil nakapagsalita na ang Sunshine, nasa atin na ang pagtugon. Tayo naman ang magsasalita at magtatanong.",3
Sunshine,putol titi to all rapists and irresponsible dicks,-1
Sunshine,"An eye-opening look into the realities of the Philippines, this film delivers a powerful narrative with clarity and conviction. The storytelling is straightforward yet impactful, shedding light on the truths many Filipinos face every day. I now understand why the director chose Maris Racal — not because she is a seasoned actress, but because her raw, unfiltered talent brings a striking authenticity to the role.",-1
Sunshine,You know that a film is good when you see a lot of twitter gays in the cinema watching it with you.,8
Sunshine,"babae ka, hindi babae lang.napakatapang. napakahusay. napakaganda.maraming bagay ang pinaramdam sa akin ng sunshine. isa rito ang pinaalala niyang isa rin akong babae na may pangarap, na ako rin ay si sunshine. it made me go back to my purpose— kung sino ako at kung bakit ako nandito. hindi lang ito kwento ni sunshine, kwento ito ng bawat babae na alam kung ano ang gusto niya at ang karapatan niya bilang babae.",3
Sunshine,"The fact this got to even show in SM nationwide makes me amazed and is a testament to what this film symbolizes and argues for in our society. Even if I didn’t really care for a certain plot device used in the movie and in fact took my enjoyment at certain points from a very grounded and compelling story, the highs of this film is extraordinary and something I will always praise. The way the camera and direction paints the complex feelings of Sunshine, the usage of Manila as both familiar yet alienating in its loudness and chaos, the rage and social commentary that is extremely brave in our current societyGiving tons of flowers for this film, I would even say that taking away the campier/comedic aspects of the film would have made this a masterpiece in my eyes! Maybe in another rewatch, this would get a higher score!If you liked the direction Direk Tonet took in Fangirl and wanted to see it taken to a different level, this film will be for you!",-1
Sunshine,maganda. matapang. babae.makabuluhan. napapanahon.isang reyalidad. dapat pag-usapan.ang galing ni maris racal.ang ganda ng karakter ni jennica garcia.‘GETS KO NA’,0
Sunshine,"big fan of the filmmaking when it gets naturally gritty, captures very well the unwelcome conditions of living in a treacherous city as a woman automatically bound to persevere to survive; not so much of the magical realism/ abstract element that deems itself clever and subtle. also not sure if the baby characters help the cause when they are painted as quirky fun little angels.",5
Sunshine,"Throughout sunshine’s tumultuous journey it was always women who helped her out: the shady lady with the abortion pills, doctora helena, her coach, her sister, her best friend, even the ladies at the motel’s reception. The film was a love letter to the bonds of mutual understanding between women navigating through a world run by men.And also, queen ariana. ",-1
Sunshine,wish that abortion of grown men is legal!,4
Sunshine,"Really nice. Brava  Nakakatunaw ng puso. Also shot in Manila, My Manila. So you know how I feel about it haha. What can I say man. Tonette Jadaone. Napakalinis magkwento. Really nice placemaking; finally for a long time, an honest-feeling Manila. A motel in Avenida you could hear the banging of rail tracks? Gusto ko rin yan mapuntuhan! Haha. Favorite ko rito yung little transgressions. Madalas ang pekilula tungkol sa shame, kumporme sa shame. That is to say parang laging uphill battle. Pero dito ni minsan hindi ako kinabahan para kay Sunshine. Panatag na panatag ako, nakakatuwang panoorin ang deliryo ng biyahe niya mula Quiapo-Avenida-Paco. Wala akong awa, naluluha lang ako sa lungkot. Bitin na bitin lang ako sa last sequence which looking back looked like an Aronofsky reference but contrivedHere is Maris Racal, who I’ve told my friends has a Mona Lisa face. Minsan 'di ko mawari kung anong nararamdaman niya, but with her command on-screen you could tell what she wants. Desperado. That is an actor you want to play Sunshine.Because Sunshine only has her mistakes to prop her up to dreams, which is a tricky proposition in the city, but nonetheless possible. And is often the case. Kailangang gustong-gustong-gustuhin mo lang talaga. Some kneel for a quarter-mile in Quiapo. Ang iba, pumapatay. Nevermind if your conscience is (literally) following you, you just have to make it work. Ito ang ibig sabihin kung mabingit ka sa mga kuko ng liwanag. To be a woman…. to be a mother. Gets mo na?",31
Sunshine,"A beautiful masterpiece from direk Tonet that defines what Philippine cinema is. The story that didn't hold back. The crucial conflict that truly transcends beyond this film. We need to be bitten by that reality. Maris as Sunshine was truly outstanding partnered by Jennica's high-caliber of acting. Let's also not forget the kids that really left their mark - Girl, Ariana, and Mary Grace with their brave portrayal.I hope this will be shown nationwide and be extended because this is an essential film. A staple for everyone.",-1
Sunshine,"The film tackled its theme in a clear and balanced manner that the audience could understand morally and ethically. Maris Racal plays her role excellently. She delivers every scene and gives the truth in every line and nuances on the screen. The supporting cast perfectly blended and joined Maris’ character, Sunshine on her journey. From the young girl to Menggay, it is truly a chef’s kiss. It was no surprise that this female-centered film from Antoinette Jadaone was made. The characters represent how women are revolutionary and show their fangs when the patriarchy tries to eat them alive.",25

Sunshine,Gets ko na ,33
Sunshine,"BABAE ANG BIDA SA KWENTO NA ’TO!This is something fresh from what I’ve seen in our local films…na may lakas maghain ng ibang perspektibo sa nakararami, lalo na sa Pilipinas? Maaring maraming binangga ang pelikulang ’to, lalo’t alam naman natin na sagradong Katoliko ang bansa. Testing on a wild sea? To me, it’s a brave move. Ang sining ay aktibismo. Napakadali lang naman eh. You can be pro-life for yourself and pro-choice to others.Mahirap ang buhay para kay Sunshine… sa mga kababaihan. Mahirap maging babae sa bansang hindi kumikilala sa mga karapatan ng mga kababaihan. Maraming kagaya ni Doc Helena ang isinasakripisyo ang lahat para ipaglaban ang katulad nina Menggay at Sunshine na biktima ng abuso at ng sistema. Pasikreto. Pailalim. Patago. Nakakalungkot ang reyalidad. Pero hindi pa tapos ang laban. May this be an eye opener to many and may we be advocates of safer and more accessible reproductive health. Nawa’y marami pa ang makapanood ng pelikulang ito. Excellent delivery from Maris, the cast, crews and of course, Direk Tonet! PS:PUTANGINA MO MIGGY! WALA KANG BAYAG! ",-1

Sunshine,her best so far,-1
Sunshine,"ang tagal ko bago isulat yung review ko sa SUNSHINE. sa pangkalahatan, walang duda—maganda at matapang ang pelikula. hindi lang maganda sa produksyon, kundi nakakanginig din ng laman. ang galing ng mga aktor, mula sa mga beteranong sina meryll soriano, xyriel manabat, elijah canlas, hanggang sa mga mas batang bituin na sina annika at julius. at higit sa lahat, si maris, na may malalim at matalim na hugot. simple pero malinaw ang paraan niya ng paghahatid ng mensahe: ang mga babae ang gulugod ng lipunan. nag-iiwan ‘to ng tanong na bakit sa kabila ng bigat ng responsibilidad na iyon, mailap pa rin ang mundo sa kanila? representasyon ang pelikulang ito na kulang pa ang mga diskusyon patungkol sa mga karapatan ng mga babae sa pilipinas. sa pelikulang ito, hindi ko kayang maging kritikal dahil alam kong hindi ko hawak ang karapatang humusga sa kwento ni sunshine. HINDI KO ITO KWENTO, at siguro iyon ang pinakamahalagang bagay na kailangang kong maunawaan. ako ay taganood lamang, at bilang manonood, ang tanging sigurado ako ay kung paano pinaigting ng pelikulang ito ang pagmamahal ko para sa kababaihan.habang pinapanood ko, parang unti-unting lumalalim ang pagkakaunawa ko na hindi pa rin patas ang batas sa mga kababaihan. mas nagkaroon ako ng lakas na sumandig sa tabi nila, sa pakikibaka para sa maayos, pantay, at respetadong pagtrato. hindi ko kailanman lubos mauunawaan ang bawat sakit, takot, at pag-aalinlangan na kaakibat ng pagiging babae pero dahil sa pelikulang ito, mas malinaw na sa akin: sila ang sentro ng komunidad. at kung may dapat magbago, hindi sila iyon ngunit ang sistema, paniniwala, at pagtingin ng komunidad sa kanila.",3
Sunshine,"The scene that stuck with me the most was the one with Sunshine (Maris) and Bata (Annica). That “Gets mo naman ako di ba?”, “Gets ko na.” exchange sent a whirlwind of emotions, it was the acceptance, assurance, the understanding.I loved everything about this film, especially how it tackled sociopolitical issues surrounding women’s rights and reproductive health. With Sunshine navigating these struggles against the gritty backdrop of Manila, it powerfully captures the harsh realities faced by many young women today.",-1
Sunshine,"You are a star, Maris Racal. I also see you, Ms Jennica. And wow, Elijah Canlas… playing a str… straight?!Best film from Direk Tonet yet! I personally felt like the metaphor of the kids was a bit overdone, but incredible writing still. Music score from Rico Blanco was also great and I hope I get to hear more from him in films.",-1
Sunshine,Husay!!,1

Sunshine,"Story / Plot:  Acting / Performance: Dialogue & Script: Direction: Production: Cinematography: Editing / Pacing: Sound & Music: Theme / Message: Overall Impact / Enjoyment: To quote Ate Klang in PBB, “OA!”. From creating the plot of this film and bringing the story into life, i found no flaws. Watched it twice and it just got better — the first time i was focused with everything about Sunshine, her dreams, her feelings, her frustrations, her struggles; the second time I was more immersed with all the other characters in Sunshine’s life (including and especially the Kid) and how they perfectly represented the different faces of judgment or support or even her own thoughts and contemplations.Nothing more to add kasi wala talaga ako nakitang mali sa film.

Sunshine,"Philippine cinema is very much alive, and a woman is our flag-bearer. As a cisgender male who calls himself a feminist, I'll never fully understand what it's like to be a woman in this country. This film, however, gave me the feeling of walking in their shoes. Every step was a courageous move toward something that could later become a matter of life and death. The story was written in a very deliberate manner, with the cinematography strengthening the narrative…",26
Sunshine,"an underrated beauty of cinema is how it can invite one into a suspended state of reality. for a brief and borrowed hour or two, our story pauses to make space for someone else’s. sunshine (2024) is one of those rare films that honors the lending of time not with surprise and spectacle, but with empathy as its goal and medium for exploration.and the language of empathy in sunshine settles in slowly, almost bodily. aptly named, the movie seeps through the senses like the quiet force of nature: it casts a harsh light on the grayed and shadowed alleys of manila, where sins and prayers blur into one cruel cacophony. it burns with familiarity when we recognize sunshine, the girl, in our own world.she sits beside us in overcrowded jeepneys, gets scolded like us in hospital beds, walks among us on streets of quiapo that shame and steal a strip of dignity. with the same light, the film reaches for the sunshine within us - the ones who dream and persist, who dare hold our potential as promises. there are sunshines among us held tightly by sisters, while some sunshines are held up only as stubborns who flicker through the dark. yet herein lands the most transcendent part of the film: it peddles no moral lesson or pedantic sermon. all that it offers is an invitation to bear witness to sunshine, as she moves to the rhythm of a music only she can hear and pushes against the gravity of choices forced upon her. the film doesn’t seek answers; it simply asks for understanding. in its own sober way, it holds out hope that when the borrowed time is up, may we not only remember every sunshine who flies and rises, but also the ones who fall and return, until we see how every ground that meets her, holds her, or traps her, as she labors to birth her becoming, is also the same one we own.",20
Sunshine,"Your body, Your choice. PERIODT.Raw, passionate, and heartfelt. I loved how the story progressed and how everything flowed naturally.

Sunshine,"Was crashing out with Sunshine as she navigates this godforsaken country's stubborn refusal to acknowledge that abortion is healthcare. I fully support how this film is solidly building a case for women's reproductive health, and at the same time I love how it's a forthright depiction of Manila, too. RSC! Quiapo! Avenida! If anything, nahawa ako slight sa pagmumura nila nang malutong by the end of it",-1
Sunshine,"goated performance by maris racal! one of the best actresses of her generation imo. this is antonette jadaone's magnum opus.can't write a full review yet!!! but wow. open the schools and put this film in every syllabus!!edit: oki i've let my thoughts simmer enough.this film, dare i say, is one of the most important pieces of media we have right now. yung storya ni sunshine, kung tutuusin, pangkaraniwan naman siya. we hear of teenage pregnancies in schools, priests or churches condemning pre-marital intercourse in their readings during mass, parents warning you about the dangers of engaging in sex, etc. there is a lot of built up fear and guilt about abortion. bilang babae, ang dami mong kalaban. relihiyon, lipunan, at ang sarili mo.",-1
Sunshine,"Si Sunshine ay ako.Hindi man ako rhythmic gymnast, pero may pangarap din ako. Gaya ng maraming babae at dalaga na dumaan sa unwanted pregnancy o pregnancy scare, ramdam ko ang takot ni Sunshine. Yung pagkabalisa at pag-ukit ng konsensya kapag nakahiga sa kama. Yung konsensyang lalong lumalalim kapag may mahinang katok sa pinto. Ito na siguro ang pelikula na kung ang younger self ko ang makakapanood, hindi niya magugustuhan na nakakarelate ako kay Sunshine. Pero ganito talaga, personal na ito sa akin. Naiintindihan ko si Sunshine. Damang dama ko yung galit. Yung takot. Yung tapang, na bahala na nga basta wag lang mapurnada ang mga plano. Ramdam ko at alam ko kung saan hinugot ni Sunshine yung tapang na 'yon. Ang karakter ni Sunshine ay nakaangkla sa batang pasulpot-sulpot. Para sa akin, inner child niya ‘yon. Pero may kasama akong nanood na nagsabing baka konsensya niya raw 'yon. Pwede rin.Tingin ko inner child niya 'yon, dahil sa tricycle scene, duguan rin ang hita ng bata. Na para bang sinasabi na kung iniinda ni Sunshine ang sakit at pilipit ng puson, dama rin yon ng inner child niya. Nasasaktan. Naaawa. Maliban doon, gusto ko rin i-emphasize kung gaano ka poetic ng eksena. Naka higa sa hita ng bata si Sunshine na nag-aagaw-buhay. Hinihinging lumaban siya. Hindi ba't magandang pagnilayan na sa lowest points ng buhay, ang boses na naririnig mo ay ang boses ng munting ikaw? Maliit, oo, pero may bigat, may bagahe.Ang rason naman kung bakit daw konsensya ni Sunshine ang bata, ay dahil sa eksena sa ospital. Galit na galit ang bata kay Sunshine at hinahanap niya si Ariana, isa ring batang pasulpot-sulpot. Ineexplain ni Sunshine na okay na si Mary Grace pero ang importante para sa kanya ay si Ariana, na nawawala. Nawala na ba si Ariana dahil nawala na rin ang dinadala ni Mary Grace?Pero sa kabila ng lahat, matapang si Sunshine. Doon sa unang hospital scene, kita mong may hiyang nararamdaman si Sunshine. Pero dahil sa trauma at pagkalito, sunod lang siya sa pinagsasabi ng overly righteous na doktora. Hanggang sa napuno si Sunshine. Isa sa pinaka-paborito kong linya niya ay nang tanungin niya ang doktora: ""Para saan?"" Na para bang may panghuhusga rin si Sunshine sa kanya. Ang daming layers ng pelikulang ‘to. Hindi lang siya tungkol sa isang babae. Kwento ito ng pinagdadaanan ng isang babae sa isang bansa na binigo at binibigo ang mga kababaihan na magkaroon ng karapatan na magdesisyon para sa katawan nila. Nagbabago na ang panahon. Hindi na dapat taboo ang usapin ng sex at sex education. Higit sa lahat, ang mga batang gaya ni Mary Grace ang pinaka bulnerable sa lahat. Ramdam ko rin si Mary Grace. Ano ang laban ng isang 13-year-old sa isang Uncle Bobot? Alam nating maraming Uncle Bobot. At dapat lang na basagan ng bote sa ulo ang mga kagaya nila. Maraming kagaya ni Mary Grace, nananahimik lang, natatakot. Kaya nga ang pelikula at kwentong ito ay magandang halimbawa ng quote na:“Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.” Mahusay. Napakahusay. Truly a landmark film.",3
Sunshine,"We are introduced to Sunshine through her warming up with other student-athletes and performing her routine for the upcoming Olympic team tryouts. Viewers can tell that her prowess and national team member status is a mix of talent and hard work, that even when she messes up halfway through, it doesn't make her any less of a great gymnast.When she first finds out that she is pregnant, the camera focuses on her hands tremble. But she immediately acts on it – searching for suspicious dealers for pills, telling the boy that knocked her up, and going to church to pray that the Lord takes away the being forming in her womb – even when we see glimpses of her trying not to lose her composure in the humid streets of Manila.The film shows and justifies Sunshine's reasons for wanting an abortion, even if the means available in the Philippines will harm her. She has dreams that can't be put on hold, and she clearly is a young girl with mannerisms and tendencies deemed ""immature"" – factors that do not make her fit to be a mother.But in a scene wherein she talks to a pastor (played by Piolo Pascual, who made everyone in my cinema gasp) that promises financial support throughout her pregnancy and motherhood, she rejects it. ""Ayoko maging nanay,"" she says, plain and simple.That was my favorite part of the film, because it felt cathartic to hear it. Although Sunshine had good reasons for the choices she makes, we must not need to have justified, valid, and layered reasons for wanting an abortion. Some of us do not want to be mothers and undergo the medical complications that come with carrying a child, just because.I hope that it has more time to stay in cinemas. I hope that more people see it, and by the time the credits roll, sana ma-gets niyo na kami.",17

This just hit the spot i cried a lot watching it esp the hospital scene, seeing how neglected the system is and how guilt tripped a woman is trying to get rid of the baby using the only way she knows which is the illegal way. I pray everyday that we as a country progress passing these laws so no more women and children have to suffer unwanted pregnancies. ALSO FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLS DO NOT EVER TRUST A MAN THAT HE WILL PUT IT OUT‼LASTLY I LOVE WOMEN! We deserve everything good in the world and beyond! Mabuhay Filipina!",5

Sunshine,"The body of the story may be about Sunshine, but its soul revolves around Menggay.From the moment the official trailer dropped, Sunshine instantly captured my interest. I’ve been waiting ever since for the chance to see it and after months of anticipation, I finally did. And now, I can say this without hesitation: I have nothing but praises for the film.More than just well-made, Sunshine is a brave and necessary work. It’s a film that demands to be seen — not only because of Maris Racal’s powerful performance, but because of how urgent and relevant its message is in today’s world.Unlike other films that leave you in feel-good state when the credits roll, Sunshine leaves you with questions — difficult, uncomfortable questions that deserve to be brought into the open.What if women had better options?What if men received the same public scrutiny when it comes to unwanted pregnancies?What if we had a healthcare and justice system that actually protects girls like Menggay?What if we dared to talk about abortion in a way that invites honest, compassionate, and informed discussion?This is where the film finds its power. When Menggay’s story arc unfolds, that’s when Sunshine cements its message, it stops being just a film and starts becoming a mirror to reality.Because this is for the countless Menggays out there — young girls with no real choices. Mga batang gaya niya. Isang 13-anyos na tinanggalan ng karapatan ng mismong sariling pamilya.And the painful truth is: there are far too many Menggays in our country. Uneducated. Deprived of opportunities. Denied the chance to choose a safer path forward.Watching this film taught me to become more open-minded. It urged me to weigh both the pros and cons of abortion more critically, and to consider how we can use art as a tool for education and awareness.In the end, Sunshine is not just a film — it’s a challenge. A challenge to our government to craft better, more inclusive campaigns. Ones that don’t just resonate with the intellectuals but reach the grassroots, where change is most needed. #Sunshine",-1
Sunshine,"After two decades in the industry, Antoinette Jadaone has cemented her capacity to bend, direct, and write with different genres — the deconstruction of ekstras with Lilia Cuntapay, the ironic and hilarious takedown of cosmetic surgery industry with Belo-approved meta-comedy “Beauty in a Bottle,” and the dialogue-driven romantic hugot dramas with ‘Tadhana.” Without a doubt, Jadaone stands as one of the most vital voices in Philippine filmmaking today, consistently challenging conventions and pushing Filipino Cinema forward. In all her films, one thing that’s notable she's put women's voices at the forefront. She has since taken a pandemic pause after Fan Girl, but this has also led to her researching and diving deep into her most recent film, Sunshine. The film follows a student gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal), who discovers she’s pregnant just as she’s about to compete for the SEA Games. The film takes a surreal turn when she encounters a kid/ alter ego appears in crisis moments, reflecting her inner turmoil as she faces societal judgment.Throughout the film, Sunshine’s emotional arc—marked by anguish, desperation, and vulnerability—lays bare the reality where women’s access to safe choices is morally questioned and legally denied. This taboo isolates her: abandoned by friends and her partner, judged by doctors, and pressured by her coach to give up her dreams. Social stigma is one, but the films also highlights how poverty and consequently, sexual miseducation put into question the dignity of women. To be able to choose freely, is too high of a cost for Sunshine who has to deal with its social, financial, and legal repercussions. The film understands how for women in the fringes there’s little to no choice.The film is not without hope. Her sister, who’s a single mother, grounds Sunshine. Her alter ego serves as emotional salve during her many crises. And she also chances upon an underaged girl months into her pregnancy who reflects and echoes her experiences. In each of them, Jadaone realizes Sunshine’s future: to be a single mother, carry her pregnancy to term, and have a daughter. The film effectively wrestles with the nuances of her situation: to choose her dreams or be with a child. Ironically, Sunshine occasionally stumbles under the weight of its many themes: its surreal elements and side characters threaten to overshadow Sunshine’s emotional arc. It makes one wonder how better the film would have been had it just been, as the film title suggested, about Sunshine. Nevertheless, the film is a showcase of Jadaone’s confident vision.There’s this wonderful scene in the film of a maternity ward that just for brief moment became a community for pregnant women and mothers helping and supporting one another. It epitomizes the warmth that carries Sunshine forward: from isolation to solidarity, and from uncertainty to self-understanding. Parting with her past, she talks to her alter ego hoping she’d understand. They hug. To be understood that’s just what Sunshine needed.",-1

There’s no need for deep analysis or interpretation, no hidden meanings or figurative scenes that require thorough discourse. It’s direct, like a slap in the face, exposing the reality of teenage pregnancy, women’s health and rights, and the importance of abortion, especially in the Philippines. The right approach in a conservative country that refuses to acknowledge such societal problems and chooses to remain ignorant for the sake of religion.",11
Sunshine,"Ang galing ng casting at sa lahat ng bumuo ng pelikulang ito. Maraming salamat sa pelikulang tamang timpla ng tapang at awareness (Manabat 2025) dahil alam naman nating sobrang sensitibo ng usapin na ganito sa bansa pero naipakita at naipaliwanag nang maayos ng materyal na to na ang desisyon ay dapat naka- base sa mga babae at hindi galing sa ibang tao. Hindi lang naipakita kundi naiparamdam din nito ang tunay na pinagdaraanan ng bawat babaeng biktima sa mga ganitong sitwasyon. Ang reyalidad ng mga babae na piniling magpatuloy at maging matapang. Mapa- main character man or support character, lahat sila umangat sa istorya, dahil lahat sila may koneksyon kay sunshine at may factor din sa mga naging desisyon nya. Lahat magaling! Walang Tapon! Ito ang pelikulang pang - masa. Pelikulang pinipilahan kahit na maraming kasabayang foreign films. Pelikulang sold out ang tickets kahit na hindi December/ MMFF ngayon or hindi love team. At higit sa lahat, pelikulang kailangan mapanuod ng lahat. Para sa akin, masasabi ko na ito ang magandang pelikula. May paliwanag, may wakas at solusyon yung problemang tinalakay sa pelikula. kaya akmang - akma rin talaga yung iconic nung line na “Gets ko na.” tangjna pa rin ng mga gagong lalaki!",3

Isa itong pelikulang hindi lang mananakit sa’yo—bubuksan ka rin nito, itutulak kang tanungin: sa mundong ito, sino ba talaga ang may karapatang humusga sa pangarap ng isang babae?MAHUSAY! SIYANG TUNAY!",3

It’s no surprise that it took a while for a film with this theme to make it into the mainstream. Still, from beginning to end, I stood by Sunshine, even when she made mistakes. That’s what made me root for her, especially in the final scenes. Kudos to the entire cast, but aside from Maris, I was especially…",-1

Sunshine,"Alam kong napakahalaga ng pelikulang ito sa kababaihan pero ang hiling ko ay sana mas maraming kalalakihan ang makapanood nito.Ang misogyny at patriyarka ay mga problemang dulot naming mga lalaki. Matibay ang paniniwala kong kami ang dapat may pinakamalaking ambag sa pagbubuwag ng mga ito. Dapat kami ang nagpepenitensya. Pero hindi ganito ang realidad. Mga babae tulad ni Sunshine, Menggay, at ang maraming babae sa pelikulang ito ang bumabaka at nagdurusa sa ilalim ng huwad na sistema. Tila habambuhay silang nagpepenitensya para sa isang kasalanang hindi matubos-tubos kahit pa anong gawin nila—ang kasalanan ng pagiging babae.Mahusay ang pagpapakita ng Sunshine sa iba't ibang impyernong dinaranas ng kababaihan: personal, panlipunan, pisikal, mental, pinansyal, sekswal, at, higit sa lahat, pulitikal. Ramdam ito sa bawat eksena kung saan galit, pag-aalala, at pagod ang namamayagpag sa mga linya, ekspresyon, imahe, at tunog. Pati nga mismo ang kalagayan nito bilang pelikula ay isang impyerno rin: ang masalimuot na danas nina Direk Tonet sa paghahanap ng distributor, ang katotohanang madalang abutin ng mga ganitong pelikula ang mainstream consciousness ng mga Pilipno, ang mabilis na pagliit ng bilang ng mga sinehan na nagpapalabas nito, at ang nagbabadyang diskurso na tiyak na magiging mapaghati. Samakatuwid, ang pelikula mismo ay dumaan at patuloy na dadaan sa impyernong ginawa ng patriyarka.Ipinapakita ng Sunshine na mula noon hanggang ngayon, kababaihan ang umaako sa responsibilidad na hamunin at buwagin ang patriyarka. Kaya sana mapanood ito ng mas marami pang lalaki, lalo na kung hindi pa sila mulat sa realidad ng kababaihan, mga batang ina, at mga biktima ng sekswal na karahasan. Tayong mga lalaki ang nag-imbento at nakikinabang sa patriyarka. Tayo ang may kasalanan, tayo ang dapat magpenitensya.",3

She smiled.Film ended.Lights came on.Overheard a dude say, ""Dapat kasi dumiretso agad siya sa Doctor.""Lahat ng bigat at sama ng loob ko, napalitan ng bwisit. Men will always miss the damn point.Para sa’yo, simple ang point ng pelikula: as long as the system is patriarchal, it will continue to fail women.Takot tayo sa mga bagay na hindi natin naiintindihan.

Sunshine,"i knew i had to watch this before this film disappears off the face of the earth like gitling did. no regrets because this might be antoinette jadaone’s magnum opus yet. sunshine (2025) had no metaphors and subtle parallelisms: it screams that a woman’s autonomy is her own. a very straight-forward, well-thought of, and a passionate piece about how a woman was made to struggle the moment she was born by the system and how it’s designed to take away her ownnes. this is true for everywhere else in the world; but much more significant in the context of a third world country such as the philippines. abortion is a controversial topic in the country, to say the least. it is seen as a violation to the sanctity of life—a sin to remove a clump of cell in a human body. swayed by the biblical texts and the catholic church, abortion is illegal in the country. but for women like sunshine and mary grace, the law does little to stop the reality: it only pushes them to do the act in shadows, where the only option is unsafe and risky. the religious references throughout the film were palpable: from the jeepney that sunshine rode to quiapo bearing the sign that says “gift of God” to sunshine’s physical manifestation of her conscience in the form of her would-be child—which shows an inner conflict between her faith and survival. these references do not seem disrespectful but rather an emphasis on how deeply stitched sunshine’s struggle to catholicism is. it’s a critique on how the bible is weaponized to police a woman’s choices and her bodily autonomy. i want to make a point on the healthcare system too which the film really did a good job criticizing: with all its faults, the healthcare system is biased against women. the lack of access to safe procedures, institutional neglect, and moral policing (made by professionals, mind you) leave women like sunshine and mary grace with nowhere to turn. the lack of quality healthcare in the country is so normalized that it leaves everyone no dignified options to address even their basic needs. a perfect film that paints intersectionality so well: women from different sectors, despite having the same oppressor, face different realities. it did not sensationalize abortion but it gave the audience another angle to look at it from; in a perspective that’s raw and honest. i was crying at the end (#that scene) because in spite all this, she prevailed. a woman, in a system that set her up to fail, survived and lived to achieve her dreams.overall, sunshine (2025) was hopeful, important, and full of courage. an important film that must be seen by everyone (and more importantly, by women). maris racal, you are a generational talent, you deserve all the flowers AND jennica garcia, this piece’s hidden gem, you have mothered on a scale no one has ever had before.",-1

But in the end, what prevailed was her dream, and how its actually okay . The idea of giving a Jojo rabbit persona to the unborn children worked well for me. It gave those children a voice. Kasi in our culture lagi nating sinasabi na kahit fetus palang yan, may buhay…",-1
Sunshine,"Few films manage to hold intensity, tenderness, and truth all at once-but Sunshine does.It was a brave story of strength, love, and kindness. Yet it was also sharp, honest in its portrayal of the harsh realities young Filipina women often endure: the limits imposed on their bodies, their choices, their futures.And still, it was warm. It never allowed you to drown in despair. Instead, it held you with care, gently reminding you that even in the most shadowed and uncertain places, light still finds its way in.Just like its title, Sunshine felt like light breaking through, like a quiet kind of hope that chooses to stay.",20
Sunshine,"Sunshine’s strength lies on its strong messaging. It confronts the audience— yes, what you heard was right. Maternity wards are in terrible conditions. A lot of R*pe and incest victims are of that age. Bigotry and victim-blaming play a huge part in our society. Antoinette Jadaone doesn’t tiptoe or walk around with her message: she is loud, angry, and knows where she stands. Her direction is both observational and sympathetic, allowing the audience to feel for Sunshine and feel helpless in situations out of our control. Despite all of these, it’s an incredibly hopeful movie about choice. Maris Racal is radiant and fantastic, and Jennica Garcia is the heart of the film.",-1
Sunshine,ito ang klase ng sining na di lang masarap sa mata kundi masarap din sa kaluluwa at sa puso. Makikita mo dito sa pelikulang ito ang bitbit na takot na mahusgahan at masabihan disgrasyada.

Sunshine,"I would say that the film truly brings you to the experience on how hard it is to be a woman in the Philippines. From how the scenes were shot, to how the environment felt raw, how the catcalls, noise, and the crowd sounded so real. I think the film perfectly captures the Filipino experience in tackling the issue of abortion, and handled it in a way that gives an insight to both sides while still ultimately leading to a decision in the end.I would argue that this is Jadaone and Racal's magnum opus to date.",26
Sunshine,"Biggest fear ko when I see films that are “too woke” (like ones about reproductive autonomy) is that they only end up sparking discourse in echo chambers — na tayo-tayo nanaman ang magjajakulan over our left-leaning beliefs.It’s a good thing Sunshine (2024) strays from that kind of narrative. It just tells a story and somehow, that hits even harder.Malaman ang pagkakahabi, maingat ang paglalahad, pero ramdam mo ang tapang at puso ",-1

Sunshine,galing ni maris at ni jennica garcia shet huhu,-1
Sunshine,Two takeaways from this movie:1. Extra hard mode ang buhay ng babae pag nasa Pilipinas ka. 2. Napakahusay ni Jennica Garcia ,6
Sunshine,sobrang hirap maging babae.this is my BARBIE movie.,6
Sunshine,"Sabi nila, kapag ang isang pelikula ay tumatak sa damdamin at isipan ng manonood, naiparating nito ang mensahe nais ipaabot. Kapag dala mo pa rin ito hanggang sa pagtulog mo, ibig sabihin ay maganda ang pagkakagawa. At kung pagising mo'y ito pa rin ang laman ng isip mo, isa itong tunay na obra maestra.Naalala ko pa noong una kong mapanood ang That Thing Called Tadhana. Alam kong iba si Direk Tonet. Para niyang binago ang pormula ng mga pelikulang Pilipino. Simula noon, naging tagahanga na ako ng kaniyang mga gawa. Walang tapon sa kaniyang filmography. May lalim ang bawat karakter na nililikha niya. Naiipakita niya ang mga struggle at kahinaan naming mga babae, pero kasabay nito, naipapakita rin niya kung paanong buong tapang naming niyayakap ang aming pagkababae.At sa pelikulang ito, mas lalo niyang pinatunayan kung gaano siya kagaling bilang direktor. Alam ko nang magiging maganda ito, mula pa lang sa premise at trailer, kuhang-kuha na niya ako. Pero nang mapanood ko na ito nang buo, mas lalo akong humanga. Panahon na, sa tingin ko, para kilalanin si Direk Tonet bilang isa sa mga haligi ng pelikulang Pilipino. Ang pelikulang ito ang magbubukas ng daan para mas mapansin siya hindi lang bilang direktor ng rom-com, kundi bilang isang seryoso at malalim na haligi ng sining at dakilang manunulat.Bawat shot, pinag-isipan. Hindi lang basta kinuha para lang sa aesthetic. Bawat karakter, may saysay at mahalagang ambag sa buhay ni Sunshine, hindi lang basta comic relief o pandagdag lang sa cast. Mahusay ang bawat isa, lalong-lalo na si Jennica Garcia, kada eksena niya, tagos sa puso. Napakahusay rin ng batang si Annika Co, kaya niyang makipagsabayan sa mga beterano. Siya ang nagmistulang liwanag, ang ""sunshine"" sa kabuuan ng pelikula.At si Maris Racal—kung hindi siya mananalo ng mga acting awards, ewan ko na lang. Para siyang isinilang para sa papel na ito. Bitbit niya ako sa bawat eksena. Bawat ngiti, bawat pikit ng mata, bawat hinga, ramdam na ramdam ko si Sunshine. Ang lalim ng koneksiyon ko sa kaniya. Wala akong ibang hiniling kundi matapos na ang paghihirap niya. Dahil 'yon sa galing ng pag-arte ni Maris. Nagawa niyang kumonekta sa kaluluwa ng mga manonood hanggang magroll ang credits.Hindi na kinailangang i-detalye pa ang mahabang backstory para makilala si Sunshine. Ang galing ng pagkakasulat. Walang patay na eksena, lahat mahalaga, lahat may emosyon. Mararamdaman mo ang lahat: awa, inis, galit, tawa, lungkot, takot, pag-asa, at saya.Ito ay nagsilbing tinig ng mga kababaihan. GETS NA GETS tayo ng pelikulang ito. Hindi lang nito binunyag ang mapait na realidad ng mga kababaihan, pero ipinakita rin nito kung paanong ang mga babae ay kayang maging unapologetically passionate sa mga gusto namin sa buhay, sa mga pangarap namin. Dagdag na rin ang pasilip kung gaano kahirap na itinatawid ng mga atletang Pilipino ang buhay sa loob at labas ng pagsasanay.Hindi perpekto si Sunshine, pero kahanga-hanga ang pagkakabuo ng kaniyang pagkatao. Ang ganda ng paghubog sa kaniyang karakter. Lagi na lang nagtatanong ang kalalakihan: “Bakit ang mga babae na lang ang laging maingay? Bakit sila ang laging humihingi ng karapatan?” Para bang pakiramdam nila’y binabalewala na sila sa modernong panahon. Sana mapanood nila ito. Sana makita nila kung gaano unfair ang mundo para sa kababaihan. Sa aspetong pisikal pa lang, talo na kami. Kaya kung maaari, bigyan man lang sana ng puwang ang aming mga karapatan na matagal na namin hinihiling na pagbigyan. Ang dali-daling talikuran ng lalaki ang responsibilidad, pero sa babae? Kami ang nagdadala ng lahat ng iniwan na pinsala mapa-mental, pinansyal, emosyonal, sosyal, at lalong lalo na sa pisikal.Ang pelikulang ito ay isang mahigpit na yakap para sa kababaihan, at isang mata na bumubulaga sa mga nananatiling bulag sa mga hinaing at karapatang matagal na naming ipinaglalaban. Ito ang klase ng mga pelikulang minsan lang dumating sa ating buhay at siguradong mananatiling relevant sa mga susunod pang taon.",3
Sunshine,Loved it. The opening set how heavy the premise will be but for me personally I would've liked it better if they made different choices on how they portrayed the other kid and both of the kids language and I felt like the opening was quite contradicting with the humor.,-1

Sunshine,Ang hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas.,0
Sunshine,"WHAT A BOLD AND EYE OPENER FILM. The representation of these women from Sunshine to Doctor Helena. It shows the truth about women vulnerable to systematic injustice and oppression. Every characters did their part. Cinematography is high tier. It’s timely, raw, and brave to its theme. Mahalaga. Matapang. Malalim. Sunshine.",36
Sunshine,"I was so relieved she got the abortion I thought the film would make her give up everything for the pregnancy. Motherhood is valid, but so is choosing yourself. It’s rare to see a Filipino film be this honest and pro-choice — and it meant so much.",-1
Sunshine,This is Direk Tonet’s greatest work.,1
Sunshine,this movie sparked a conversation with my family and ang ending ay papa-attend-in nila ako ng isang catholic seminar ,-1
Sunshine,oo!!!! napakahirap maging isang babae sa isang lipunang hindi marunong makinig!!!!,3
Sunshine,"cant seem to find the words (yet) to articulate my emotions about this film ↕ sobrang galing and im happy stories like these are being told in ph cinemai could feel the emotion and depth of each woman that represented different walks of life sa sunshine. i empathize with their choices, their struggles, and their dreams. gets ko sila. and as simple as it is, women should not be shamed for making decisions for themselves. so bakit ang hirap intindihin nian para sa iba  these stories are real and filipino women continue to suffer kasi sobrang stigmatized pa rin ang ganitong conversations. ang hirap maging babae sa pilipinas ",30
Sunshine,everyone at the cinema was left speechless when the credits rolled in.,-1
Sunshine,"matapang.hope the lessons of the film go beyond the end credits.sa lahat ng Sunshines, gets ko kayo.",6
Sunshine,I hated how my stomach dropped in the earlier part of the film and stayed like that until the end. 5 stars ka sakin,-1
Sunshine,"very Lino Brocka nga sya it just that it tends to be a bit melodramatic at times, otherwise, it would have been perfectsana gumawa pa si Direk Tonet ng mga ganitong klaseng pelikula. this should be screened in schools. kaso nasa Pilipinas tayo so medyo malabo.",-1
Sunshine,slayyy,1
Sunshine,women deserve everything and men deserve way worse than what they got in this movie,34
Sunshine,"i watched this spontaneously  and i am glad that my guts led me herei really like the scenes sa quiapo church and the continuous scenery of the city where its chaos and noise would subside and coexist with the problems of sunshine. honestly, she is a strong and a resilient girl. maris played the character really well, that you could feel her problems' weight and her emotions stacking all together, plus the pressure of being a national player for the olympics. the scene in the film that tied a really tight knot in my stomach is the chase scene with sunshine and the 13 year old girl near lrt recto, that is where the problem would shift not only for sunshine but in a general manner, that this happens, everyday, and everywhere, as long as there are men with lustful power and bad intentions. LEGALIZE ABORTION, MAKE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE, and PRIORITIZE WOMEN'S HEALTHCARE !!tnginah ng mga lalaki !!",-1
Sunshine,gets ko na,14
Sunshine,"Sunshine Hindi ako madalas mag-share ng thoughts ko tungkol sa mga pelikula — kasi naniniwala ako na iba-iba ang tama ng kwento sa bawat tao.Pero iba si Sunshine. Isang pelikulang binigyang kulay ang isang usapin na matagal nang pinapadilim — ang karapatan ng kababaihan. Hindi ito pag-romanticize ng abortion. Ito ay pagtindig sa matagal nang pinapatay na diskurso tungkol sa maling ideolohiya, diskriminasyon, at ang paulit-ulit na pagkundena sa kakayahan ng babae na magdesisyon para sa sarili.Ang bigat ng mga eksena, pero ang galing — kasi ang gaan nitong naipaintindi. Gets ko na.Salamat, Direk Antonette, sa tapang at galing mong magkwento. Kay Maris, na sa loob ng higit isang oras at kalahati, ay naging si Sunshine — at naging kaibigan ko. Sa buong cast, salamat sa pagbuo ng mundong hindi namin kayang talikuran, dahil ito ang totoo.Kung may oras ka, panoorin mo Sunshine. Alam kong kasabay nito ang Fantastic Four at iba pang malalaking pelikula — at okay lang naman ’yon. Pero sana, bigyan mo ng pagkakataon si Sunshine. Pramis, walang sisihan.",3
Sunshine,,32
Sunshine,"gets ko... at sana'y ma-gets din ng karamihan, lalo na ng mga mambabatas natin.",0
Sunshine,"Maris Racal turned into a drama actress in this movie. She played the role so well, from the gymnast to an early teen, pregnant, soon-to-be mother, not ready yet for the responsibility. She gave it all for this. The movie is full of different emotions. You will laugh, become angry, and be inspired. It is a story of a struggling athlete and the reality of different social issues in the country. The cinematography was superb, showing the different scenes in a way that made you get hooked and feel the emotion. The dialogue was natural and sublime and not filtered to show the actuality of what would happen. WHAT I LOVE THE MOST IS THE TWIST ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF ANNIKA AS “BATA”. It sealed the deal. The last scene with her and Maris made me cry. This is a movie that you should watch.",25
Sunshine,my god miss tonet jadaone you’ve never failed me! i feel so strongly for this film and i’m glad it captured a woman’s feelings so accurately in these issues huhuhuhu,-1
Sunshine,legalize abortion!,4
Sunshine,"five stars bc i can't believe they let her do it. i mean, it's kinda ~vague~ still but the audacity... maris racal, we love yew!other random thoughts: the papa p jumpscare  i didn't know he was in it! i think a braver film would focus on mary grace's story but maybe too much trauma p*rn?",-1
Sunshine,tangina ng lahat ng bobot sa mundo.,0
Sunshine,eto yung tipo ng pelikulang matutulala ka pagtapos..,24
Sunshine,"It’s a bold film and I respect what it’s trying to say, especially with how real the issue is here in the Philippines. But I feel like the reviews it’s getting are more for what it stands for than how it was actually executed. The story and the lead felt a bit weak. I wanted more. Still, it’s worth watching for the conversation it starts.",-1
Sunshine,"A film about abortion that is so beautiful that it makes me proud to recommend this film to anyone regardless of their stance in abortion, most especially in a very catholic-dominated society. It spoke so loudly to me of how a woman's life could change from bearing a child in your womb. it could shatter your dreams, make your life critical, or give you a life you have always wanted- to become a mother. Annika, the bata, as a narrative device to signify conscience of Sunshine was Jadaone's wonderful choice to gently discuss a sensitive topic such as abortion without deafening the fetus inside of a pregnant woman. Sunshine was a cinematic storytelling of coming to a decision, with never-ending to contradictions with your conscience and peeking through jalousies of other people's similar but different narratives, to come to a choice for yourself, as a woman.",5
Sunshine,putanginaaa,1
Sunshine,"a film about special people who live a rather normal life, amidst the chaotic yet beautiful, neon-lit street life of manila, filled with a heartwarming sense of humanity. having only seen 'six degrees of separation from lilia cuntapay', i think i can say that direk tonet gets it, she treats her characters in a way that makes us care and relate with them in one way or another; i may not be pregnant like sunshine, but i very much live in the same society as her. the director doesn't glorify or romanticize the world in which sunshine, and we, live in—it is depicted in an achingly honest way, and therefore brutal. and maris racal is able to assimilate (?) in this world built around her character, she was phenomenal in portraying this character in such a manner that is raw and tender; most notable in scenes depending on non-verbal dialogue. although, said scenes are probably my favorite among the entire film, most of them fall short on an emotional level—just as the emotions are about to hit a gut punch, the scene is cut off. by all means, this is not a perfect film. still, it doesn't take away from the very real and grounded moving story that is sunshine.",12
Sunshine,"watched this through the lens of the gay friend who's walked beside many sunshines in his life. it breaks my heart how familiar everything feels. how hard it is for sunshines to go through something like this in a country where it's still illegal, unsafe, and almost impossible to talk about.this is a movie for the masses. for the women who are left with no choice but to carry the burden quietly. for the world that needs to stop looking away.(fuck men)i hope one day we wake up in a philippines where no one has to suffer just to survive. where people are given real choices, not pushed to desperate corners.the film makes you feel it; how sunshine's world gets smaller the longer she hides her truth. you see it in the tight streets of manila, where every corner feels like it's closing in on her. her fear and panic so loud even when she says nothing. then you see her walk through the chaotic streets of quiapo, where she disappears into the crowd, holding onto the little control she has left. she's not sure if what she's doing is right, but she does it anyway, because no one's there to guide her. she does it alone, hoping that somehow it works. that somehow it saves her.this is a film that deserves to be seen for generations. and i hope that when they do, they can say, ""ay, ganito pala noon"" because by then, we’ve already made things better.to all the sunshines: you are not alone. ps: this is now my top fave antoinete jadaone film!!! also, they can never make me hate you maris racal!",26
Sunshine,sa pilipinas isusumpa ka pag nagpa-abort ka ng bata dahil nga sobrang relihiyoso at conservative ng mga tao rito. pero sa pilipinas ka lang din makakakita ng mga nagbebenta ng abortion pills sa labas mismo ng simbahan. imbis na paganon eh paganon talaga.sobrang bigat nitong pelikulang to lalo na para sa mga kababaihan. putangina ninyong lahat.,3
Sunshine,all my homies love dr helena,-1
Sunshine,"didn’t fully realize what I was getting into when I stepped inside the theater.All i can say is, this hit way too close to home to any women who have experienced what Sunshine had: you’re strong, i believe you and gets na gets na super gets ko kayo ",-1
Sunshine,"The female solidarity all over this film love itIt really showed us that not legalizing abortion won't stop women from getting it, so might as well make it safe for them",5
Sunshine,sobrang hirap maging babae especially (!!!!) sa bansang napaka-pukinangina ng health care system,3

Sunshine,finally a thought-provoking pinoy film done right. t’was just kinda hard to ignore the score & some editing mishaps but hey we’re heading in the right direction. more political films like this pls?ps maris racal shines the titular role but jennica garcia outshines as a supporting,25
Sunshine,they could never make me hate you maris racal ,2
Sunshine,"The chaotic rhythm of life.Spoilers ahead.Bold and controversial, writer-director Antoinette Jadaone continues her non-romantic-comedy streak with another compelling and dark subject matter through ""SUNSHINE"". Gracing the screen is the titular character, played by Maris Racal in her career-best performance, who finds out she's pregnant while she prepares for her Olympic-qualifying event. Trouble ensues, dream and ambition crash.Teenage pregnancy and women conditions take front and center as the film gives voice to the usual silenced of the society. Jadaone may have placed rhythmic gymnastics in the background but it excellently serves as a metaphorical tool to describe the ebb and flow of Sunshine's life. We see her struggles pitted against conservativism and arguable morality in a country where religion and patriarchy rule and shackle. Through magic realism where we are introduced to two young players who abruptly show up mid-scenes, the film gets a rich layer on how our lead navigates her perilous journey. They channel the moral compass though at times their appearances and comedic flair tend to be uneven and out of timing. Racal, with her sharp strength and vulnerability, is utterly commendable but so is her supporting cast - Jennica Garcia and Meryl Soriano as her strong-willed yet nurturing older sister and coach respectively, Annika Co as her unborn child manifestation (an unpredictable plot twist that eventually made sense), and even the cameos from Madeleine Nicolas, Angeli Bayani, Angie Castrence, Elijah Canlas, and Piolo Pascual fulfill their impressive character actor repertoire. Some arcs and scenes could have been fleshed out because it's got a premise worth exploring but the Philippine censorship may have played its upper hand to prevent the film's full bloom. In the same vein of ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days"", ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"", and ""Happening"", it may not be everyone's cup of tea due to its hefty topic and open-endedness but it's a delight to see an important Filipino film that fearlessly opens the conversation to empower women more on making their own reproductive choices, even with the deafening noise and outdated discourse.Quiapo. Geleen. Ribbon. 4.5/5, folks!Winner of The Crystal Bear Award in the Generation 14plus category at the 75th Berlinale - Berlin International Film Festival, ""SUNSHINE"" is now exclusively playing in SM Cinemas, rated R-16 without cuts.Tangkilikin natin ang makabuluhang Pelikulang Pilipino!#MovieMadness #PinoyIndieSpirit#TheRoadToTheOscars2026 ",17

Sunshine,"“Naiintindihan mo ba ako?” “Gets ko na.” A quiet yet powerful scene that perfectly serves as catharsis for Sunshine, after being repeatedly slapped in the face by catholic guilt and shame up to that moment.I hope this film will influence people to have more discussions surrounding the struggles that filipino women face in terms of bodily autonomy, especially those who cannot afford to have a safe abortion.",-1
Sunshine,"of promised glamor and presented grime, manila boundlessly teems with ironies and contradictions—and such is a reality that constantly manifests in sunshine. throughout the narrative, sunshine traverses between significant juxtapositions: of what is deemed ""sacred"" and ""sinful,"" of noise and silence, and of the boundaries of life and death. the film's grounding into the grittiness of its locale gives depth not just to the narrative, but to the characters. particularly resonant to the philippines, agency is very much the central…",-1

Sunshine,"Been eyeing this film since last year. Fortunately enough, I was able to watch this yesterday with my Mom. In the midst of darkness and rain, we looked for Sunshine.It adds surrealism without sacrificing its groundedness. Remember crying in a few scenes just because of how real it felt and then that sudden realization hits me, and I remember — nangyayari talaga siya sa totoong buhay yet it's inadequately addressed. Alienated, discriminated, and hidden behind idols and symbols stained with shame like the Sunshines and Menggays who are forced to comply with the rules set by a patriarchal, hypocritical, conservative society. I think this film won't force you to agree with its message but it challenges our morals and belief system. Above all, it only asks to be understood. There's multiple shades of womanhood that's not confined within a black and white backdrop. And it's good that we start and continue to talk about it. Overall, this film isn't just about abortion — it's a critique on society, politics, and feminism. As well as a call for women's accessible reproductive healthcare.Ps. Dahil sobrang lakas ng ulan pagpunta namin ng nanay ko sa sinehan, halos basa na likod namin, especially likod niya. I had to buy her a blanket (which she had in her back while watching the film). She chose this pinkish? Almost corally one. Overall, napaka-unforgettable experience 'tong pinagdaanan namin just to watch the film that she named her blanket 'Sunshine'.",-1

Incredible screenplay i love that the director didn't need to spoonfeed us on what us happening, the way the director and DP was able to convey what they want visually was well done. The quiapo and tondo scenes just feels something out of a Lino Brocka film. Overall a great movie and definitely one of my favorites this year.",-1

Sunshine,"lord please take maris racal’s pain, triple it, then give it to bongbong marcos & all the evil MALES in this world",1
Sunshine,"Grabe gets ko na bat sya award winning.Before I even entered the cinema, prepared na aq mag cry cry. I saw the trailer, the interviews, and the podcasts so I was bracing myself for emotional confrontations and intense family drama pero wala so what really made me cry was how real everything felt. The way Sunshine just tried to carry on, the way Jennica quietly supported her, and the way the story showed how painfully human this situation is. There was so much honesty in how it was told. Pogi din ni Papa P.As a woman who has experienced a teen pregnancy scare before, I saw parts of myself in Sunshine. That helpless feeling, the fear of not knowing what to do, the shame, and the silence around it… It was all too familiar. I also have friends who’ve gone through it for real. They shared their stories, and as I watched the film, I could see their experiences mirrored by Sunshine.Maris Racal is amazing as Sunshine. Everything about her performance was convincing, from the way she moved to the way she spoke (pero direk kita yung face ng double ni Sunshine ha ). She really looked like a young athlete from a struggling family, someone whose life revolved around discipline and dreams until it all came crashing down. I’ve seen Maris in different roles before, like in Incognito, where she played this aircon ex-military girly na mukhang ginagawang pangbahay ang gucci, it’s rlly impressive how she completely transforms into Kanal Sunshine bc she doesn’t just act the part, she becomes it.Jennica also stood out for me. As Sunshine’s Ate, her presence was comforting throughout the film. She had this motherly vibe that felt very natural. I liked how the film gave her character depth without spelling everything out. You could tell that her love for Sunshine came from a place of experience, like she had her own quiet struggles too. Galing din ni Annika.Even the supporting casts delivered. The manghihilot, the abortion pill seller, the doctors and the people Sunshine met along the way weren’t just fillers. Their performances felt soooooo real, and they matched the tone of the film so well. I didn’t feel like I was watching actors, I felt like I was watching people actually living through these moments.Sa ibang indie films, I cringe when I hear characters cursing because it feels like the writers are just slapping random tangina words trying too hard to sound edgy or cool. But here, everything made sense. The dialogue flowed naturally. The curse words weren’t just for shock, they felt earned u know. One of the scenes that stayed with me was in the motel. It was quiet, then the sound of a train passing by filled the background. That sound stuck with me. It gave the scene so much weight. It felt like the world outside was moving forward, while Sunshine was stuck in a moment where everything felt uncertain. That kind of sound detail is the kind of thing I really appreciate.As someone na working din sa field, I couldn’t help but notice the small design details. Sunshine’s costumes were on point, from her jerseys na may ibat ibang year (aminin, pambahay natin mga intrams shirt ) to the athletic tapes on her body, to her bag full of pins and cute hair clips. Those little choices made feel convincing talaga. She looked like an actual teen athlete, not just someone pretending to be one.The scene in the church was another standout. She didn’t even go inside. She stayed outside and prayed, and that choice said so much. It was symbolic. It showed how distant she probably felt from her faith or how unworthy she thought she was in that moment. That kind of framing really hit me.I also appreciated the sound design. Instead of dramatic bg music, they focused ambient sounds. It gave everything a grounded feeling. It was like I was right there with her, experiencing everything in real time.The pacing was perfect. There were no awkward pauses, no scenes that felt unnecessary. Sa ibang movies, may moments na napapa-phone lang ako hahahah Every second mattered. Every moment added layers to the story. Even the locations were smartly chosen. They weren’t overly stylized. They felt like real places people actually live in and go through things in.Award ka talaga Sunshine. ",-1
Sunshine,"we shouldn’t have any doc helena in this philippines because abortion should be free, and above all, legal. it is an absolute right that should be promulgated in the constitution.maris is a star. direk tonet cemented herself as my fave director and writer. she crafts her films like what i envision my life will unfold if the situation happens to me. there’s the rawness and authenticity that cannot be replicated.the film really is a must-watch. and im so glad it’s blessed with a nationwide theatrical release.[SM Manila Cinema 3]",13
Sunshine,"Sunshine is probably one of the most important film philippine cinema has to offer. beautifully poignant, heart-warming, tragic, and is just fully human. simplicity is it's beauty. if you think that this film is just about abortion, then you're wrong. it highlights how messed up the philippine society is when dealing with such. abortion is never a black and white morally right or wrong thing. there is a whole gray area that you need to understand about it and this film perfectly showcases that.plus a piolo pascual jumpscare.plus plus, despite me wanting to watch movies alone, i was happy to see a packed cinema today.",12
Sunshine,"""gets ko na""no bad words daw pero putangina ang ganda. it showed what it's like for a woman to get pregnant in the philippines in different ways. i mean kahit saan ka man. men will never have to change their live if they get someone pregnant. but a woman? she has to think of soooo many things. i love sunshine's ate and the symbolism of the kid. the support and the realization, ""gets na gets na"" WAS JUST WOW GRABE LUHA KOOOOO",-1

WAG NA ILAGAY SA ALANGANIN BUHAY NG MGA BABAE PARA LANG MAGPA ABORT!!!!!!!!!,3
Sunshine,"Sobrang fitting na sunshine ang title ng pelikulang ito dahil katulad ni sunshine, may tapang, puso, at pagkakakilanlan ang pelikula. Matapang dahil bilang predominantly catholic country na sobrang na ka-angkla ang paniniwala, mga desisyon, at disposisyon sa buhay sa kung ano ang tama at mali sa bibliya, isang malaking hakbang ang ipakitang tumaliwas sa nakaugalian at kinalakihang ideya ng kung ano ang “tama”. Matapang dahil sa mundo at sa bansang sobrang patriyarkal na nag c-cater lamang sa kalalakihan, walang pag-uubling pinakita na wala dapat may ibang may karapatan sa katawan at kapakanan ng isang babae kung hindi sila lamang. Matapang kasi ilegal ang aborsyon sa pilipinas at imoral ang tingin sa mga taong gustong gawin ‘to pero walang tako’t na ipinakita na katulad ni sunshine, may mga babeng hindi ginusto at gustong maging ina at dapat ay may karapatan silang mamili. May puso kasi naguumapaw sa pagmamahal ang pelikula. Pagmamahal ng kapatid, kaibigan, mentor. At higit sa lahat ang pagmamahal sa kapwa babae. Ang pagmamahal na ipinakita ni sunshine kay menggay, ang pagmamahal na pinakita ni doctora helena sa kanilang dalawa. Masakit in a way pero sobrang gandang isipin na women will always have each other’s back at the end of the day. Walang titindig para sa isang babae nang lubos kung hindi babae lamang rin. Ngunit ang nangibabaw rito ay ang pagmamahal ni sunshine sa sarili niya at sa kanyang mga pangarap. May doubts si sunshine bilang isang babae, bilang isang katoliko. Kaya nga ilang beses natin siya nakitang nagdasal eh at kaya na rin nag e-exist ang karakter ni annika co. Siya yung nagsilbing physical form ng nagsalong upbringing at inhibitions ni sunshine pero at the end of the day, nanaig pa rin ang pagmamahal niya sa pangarap niya. Ang ganda, sobrang ganda. May pagkakakilanlan kasi sobrang pinoy na pinoy ‘tong pelikulang ito. Mula sa kung paano pinakita yung ingay at gulo ng maynila, hanggang sa dynamics ng magkakapatid sa pamilyang pilipino. Pati kung paano nabubuhay ang mga babae sa bansang bulok ang reproductive health system at hindi tanggap ang pagiging sexual nila. Sunshine is now my favorite maris racal performance which was previously held by peachy of Pamilya Ko. I know it’s the bare minimum and literally the point of acting but you can really tell she’s a good actress kasi walang bahid ng kung sino si maris racal sa totoong buhay sa mga karakter na ginagampanan niya. Sobrang believable niya as an actress. In my opinion, this is direk tonet’s best work to date. Her magnum opus so far. Also, jennica garcia is truly a fucking star. She owned every scene she had. P.S. tangina mo miggs at bobot i hope you both rot in hell!!!",3

Sunshine,"THISSS IS CINEMAAAA U GUYS (YAS, edited w/ a short commentary)what i love about sunshine is it never tries to sell the idea that motherhood is innate, pure, or noble. instead, it asks the real question paano kung ayaw talaga? and it’s so bold to center that lalo na sa context ng pilipinas where everything about being a woman is reduced to sacrifice.we’re raised to believe na ang katawan natin ay para sa pamilya, para sa pananampalataya, para sa kinabukasan ng iba. never para sa sarili. kaya sobrang rare and sobrang radical makakita ng pelikula na nagsasabing ""hindi mo kailangang gustuhin. hindi mo kailangang magpaka-martir.”sunshine understands na abortion is not some abstract “debate” about morality. it’s lived. it’s embodied. it’s desperate. and it doesn’t look away from that. it shows us what women are actually left with when they’re denied safe and legal options. instructions sa papel, gamot na walang label, pangambang baka mamatay ka sa proseso. it doesn’t sensationalize it, but it doesn’t sanitize it either. and that’s where the power lies.the film knows the violence doesn’t start when a woman decides to abort. it starts when the state tells her she can’t. when even in the face of trauma, poverty, or kahit simpleng “hindi ko kaya"" o ""ayoko,"" the answer is always “wala tayong magagawa."" sunshine sits with that anger. nire-recognize niya na ang lack of choice ay isa lang sa napakaraming anyo o mukha ng systemic violence. patunay ito of how the law protects an imagined morality while punishing the actual living woman.and yes, this film is very aware that class makes all the difference. hindi lahat may access to private clinics or doctors willing to take the risk. karamihan, kung hindi lahat, gaya sa pelikula ay sa quiapo ang bagsak. o kaya naman hilot. 'yung iba wala talagang means & are forced to be victims of the way laws, culture, and religion collude to trap women into roles they never asked for. and that matters. because the way we talk about abortion in this country is always so detached from those realities. laging hypothetical. laging abstract. laging nakadikit sa spiritual na paniniwala. but sunshine shows that for many women, hindi lang siya tungkol sa pagkakaroon ng choice o sa moralidad kundi buhay at kaligtasan din nila mismo. literal na tinatanggalan sila ng basic human rights. ang sarap himayin ng pelikulaaa especially 'yung subplot tungkol doon sa 13-yr old girl tapos isampal 'yun sa mukha ng mga taong hindi magawang ilabas ang sarili nila sa personal nilang mga baluktot na paninindigan.ig the best part for me is how sunshine never tries to justify. likeee it doesn’t go “look, she had no choice,” or “she’s a victim, kaya understandable.” no. it says na kahit may support ka, kahit privilege ka, kahit hindi ka biktima, may karapatan kang pumili. and that, for me, is what makes it a GREAT feminist film. hindi siya nakikiusap sa audience na intindihin si sunshine. it tells you, plainly, na she owes you nothing.and maybe the most haunting part of this film is how it visualizes the weight of that decision. hindi bilang guilt or punishment but as memory. the film doesn’t erase the what-if. it shows you that even when a choice is right, it doesn’t come clean or easy. and that doesn’t make it wrong.FKK SOBRANG GALING LANG !!",-1

Sunshine,"A sunshine of hope in the dark, conservative alleys of Manila.This is a film that tackles what we Filipinos mostly shame women for: abortion. In this film, we see how the patriarchal society has a chokehold on our women. Men continue to crush the dreams of women, whether through abandoning them (ehem Miggy), ruining them (ehem Bobot), and deciding for their future (ehem Pastor Jaime).But not Sunshine.Despite everything, she persisted. She never gave up. Her trials and eventual triumphs gave a nice contrast to the setting: the dark alleyways of Quiapo. In the desolate streets, there she is continuing to shine. And can I just say, sobrang galing ni Maris! She really did justice in portraying the character. Additionally, I’d also like to commend Annika Co in her portrayal of the bata. Superb, she has potential! Her character is like an annoying voice of reason for Sunshine. Pero grabe, naluha ako in the end sa scene nilang dalawa.And Rhed Bustamante too as Mary Grace. Despite a short screen time, I felt that she was the soul of the movie. Through her, we saw how Sunshine comes to realize her fight for her dreams. Mary Grace was the bridge that Sunshine crossed to eventually come to her decision of persisting with her goals. I also liked how the women in the film supported each other. Thea, despite her mother not allowing her to hang out with Sunshine, showed up in the end. Coach Eden, who helped Sunshine realize her dreams. Her sister Geleen, who strongly supported her in every way. This film is an ode to women, and tackles an issue that should really be talked about more.",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine tried to open a discussion about a topic rarely talked about in the Philippines -- and in that aspect, I think it was already a success.For it to be played in Philippine cinemas is already a win for the film, on top of the other awards it has received abroad. In terms of the technical aspects, I liked how the film showed the beauty of Manila despite its flaws, how graceful rhythmic gymnastics look like despite being a tough sport, and how the venues mostly used in the film had enough space needed despite being cramped.Story-wise, I like how it tackled the problems of the Philippines in terms of reproductive health, but also showed the pro of being a mother -- or at least having a mother figure by your side. However, while I understand why Sunshine made that decision, I think it somehow lacked that oomph on why she was eventually convinced to do IT. What happened after THE TALK? Still, I believe Sunshine should be watched by many. Sunshine shows that one may be in a dark situation, but if you stand your ground and believe in what's best for you, then you know how or where to find the light.",12

Gago solid. Unang-una kong nanotice yung husay ng scriptwriters, ang wi-witty! Bawat kuda ng mga aktres at aktor, hahagalpak ka talaga ng tawa, at sa mga times man ng seriousness, ramdam mo ang bigat at poot all from those lines and words alone! Hindi cringe, kundi effortless at natural!But it would've not been that good if it weren't for the actress/actors, of course. Ang huhusay! Lalong lalo na si Maris, the dedication, the talent?! Mga bitawan ng lines, grabe sapul na sapul ka. Manilang-manila, pinoy na pinoy, along with its cinematography!Now, sa totoo lang, I thought this film would end in a cliché and pro-life way. Yung tipong sa huli she will choose to raise the child nalang and give up her dreams? God knows how I was sooo relieved when it did not end like that! I think and I hope this would be the start of the normalization of pro-choice Pinoy films! This is revolutionary in Philippine film landscape! It's something new and look where this movie went? T'was excellent overall, goosebumps ka for sure in some scenes. In our cinema, halos lahat parang nagcontemplate right after the film.

Sunshine,"A lot has already been said about this film—timely, important, brave. Sunshine is not great just because it tackles abortion, it welcomely invites us to be with its titular character. Every scene we are with her, and no scene is wasted. We know she got big dreams, and it's all she's ever known. We feel her despair, anger, and the facade through her smile. We see her make bad choices, but we understand why.I've seen a similar film in 2020, US's Never Rarely Sometimes Always. What sets Sunshine apart is it is set in the Philippines, a predominantly Catholic country. From the moment Sunshines wants to know about her status, judgment has already been cast upon her. People around her treat her as if she's some sort of contagious disease. Institutions, who are supposed to provide help, condemns her and gives a long-ass speech as if they're god. Yet, she finds a glimpse of hope in the most unlikely of places.Direk Tonet has proven to be one of the most versatile and essential modern directors in the Philippines. From her indie roots to her modern take of romcoms, she consistently has made semi-blockbuster memorable Filipino films. In her shift to sociopolitical drama, which already started in Fan Girl (2020), her voice as a female writer-director is clearer than ever. Hearing the germ of idea for this film got me intrigued, inspired from Jojo Rabbit (2019). At first, I was skeptical of this borrowed plot device, but it completely won me over and elevated the film in the end. Manila is captured as pure as it is. The score is played at the right moments, and so did pure silence.And of course, Maris Racal, the heart of this film. A year of training and research for the character paid off. She is Sunshine through and through! Her in that motel scene is raw and chilling to say the least. All the supporting actors and bit roles are just as great and gives life to Sunshine's world. Jennica Garcia may have a few lines, but her performance especially in that scene with Maris is one to be remembered for, especially for teenage mothers. A surprising yet worthy appearance comes from Rhed Bustamante, whose minor role made a huge impact on me—I cried!Sunshine is such a lightning in a bottle kind of Filipino film. Who would have thought that a great indie pinoy film about abortion is getting this high amount of traction and success? One's hope is for this to create discussion among us and to move the needle systemically for girls like Sunshine. (And as a cinephile, I hope more films like this get produced and be seen by Filipinos, because Philippine Cinema has always been alive!)",20
Sunshine,"teka, saka ko na lagyan review pero i love this film",6
Sunshine,"Nagpapasalamat ako kay papa God dahil binigyan niya ng talento at tapang ang lahat ng bumuo ng pelikulang ‘to. There was just so much heart in this film. Sunshine somehow feels like very raw but very poise. Ang ganda ganda. Salamat po, direk. Ang husay ng lahat.",-1
Sunshine,decriminalize abortion!,4
Sunshine,i really admire how direk tonet writes women characters!ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE!,-1
Sunshine,"“drown out the noise”what a line from a film that quite possibly will shake the current landscape of conversation on abortion. literally still stunned, but for now make noise!",5
Sunshine,Gets ko na,33
Sunshine,everything in that motel sequence was perfection !! jadaone's best hands down ↕,-1
Sunshine,"Hopefully, this movie sparks the much-needed conversation. Time for the Filipinos to open their minds. Your beliefs are your own, but they shouldn’t hinder others from exercising their rights. Making abortion illegal doesn’t make it go away — it only puts women’s lives at greater risk.Also, of course, hands down to Maris Racal. She portrayed her character really well.And kudos to Direk Tonet for creating such a brave film in a country as close minded as the Philippines. Really hoping this movie would open up some minds.",13
Sunshine,"my heart sank. ang hirap maging babae tbh :-(( this could be someone’s reality rn.ang daming leksyon at issues na ipinakita at ipinadama. powerful. ang galing ng acting, film prod, and ofc direk 5/5!!! YES TO CHOOSING YOU. YES TO CHOOSING YOUR SUPPORT SYSTEM.YES TO CHOOSING TO FIGHT FOR OTHERS.GETS NA GETS.",-1
Sunshine,Don’t say bad words daw pero tang ina iyak lang ako nang iyak ,0
Sunshine,"at kung pinanganak kang babae sa Pilipinas, gets mo na agad kahit hindi ka tanungin dahil ikaw si Sunshine. ako si Sunshine. tayo si Sunshine.(never felt so deeply connected to a film until today. grabe yung iyak ko sa sinehan and even after it habang kumakain. this hits so deeply with me as someone who comes from a family that expects that every woman in it have to have their own children someday and as someone who is in the field of healthcare & hoping to practice medicine as an OB-GYN in the PH.)",-1
Sunshine,"despite all odds, there are people who are willing to help. your family, your friends and strangers, even in the most simplest ways.",-1
Sunshine,"grabe ang galing lang ilang beses akong umiyak. bukod sa advocacy nito para sa abortion, pinapakita rin dito kung gaano kahalaga magkaron ng autonomy sa sariling buhay. such an important film!!!",6
Sunshine,"Courageous. This is how I would describe the film. The way it speaks to and for society, portrays women's experiences, and challenges the pre-existing notions— the societal pressures, religious guilt, patriarchal norms—all were executed perfectly.One thing that I can't seem to stop thinking about is the personification of Sunshine's troubles. Some said it could be her conscience, maybe her guilt, maybe it's also the pressures society had brought upon women experiencing the same struggle, but I personally saw it as the personification of the child inside her. Kasi as a pregnant woman, one of the top things that she's probably considering the most would be the child (since it has been embeded into us that the child has a life as soon as it's formed). Ang galing lang kasi talaga ng portrayal na 'to and it keeps my mind gears churning. And that 'gets ko na'… I BAWLED.Sunshine is also one of the movies na mayroong ibang level of understanding yung mga babae, e no? A man could watch this and empathize, pero iba yung dating ng pelikulang ito lalo na sa mga babae sa Pilipinas. I would really only trust movies about women to women. Props to DIrek Tonet for this, really.Listing the things I love abt the movie here too!- Sunshine and the women she encountered…- Ang galing nung mga bata at ni Rhed tangina!!!???? - basagin ang ulo ng mga rapist >>>> magbasag ng bote sa ulo ng rapist- I have a lot more kaso my short term memory can't write it now because I'm logging this days late UGH.But It feels really freeing to see this kind of story sa theater, with a broader audience. Salamat sa matapang na pagbitaw ng mga salitang ""Ayaw kong maging nanay"" at ""Hindi pa ako handang maging nanay"" sa harap ng bansang ang tingin ay ito lang dapat ang kahihinatnan ng kababaihan. Oo, motherhood is great, but it's not for all of us— especially for ones who are forced into it.Para sa pangarap, buhay, at kaligtasan— Isulong natin ang karapatan ng kabataan at kababaihan! No to Abuse, Harassment, and Teenage Pregnancy!Yes to Reproductive Health Awareness! Decriminalize abortion!Hayaan nating magdesisyon ang bawat babae para sa kanilang katawan dahil ito ay kanila, at kanila lamang. #ProChoice :)",-1
Sunshine,"gets ko na. keep on shining, my little sunshine. ",2
Sunshine,"Maris Racal's best work to date. Her range was out on full display for the entire film. The script was great, it felt real and relatable; Laugh out loud funny in some parts and heart-wrenching in others. The amount of swearing was slightly concerning but understandable considering the setting. This was a much-needed film to start proper conversations on this matter.",-1
Sunshine,"""Pagtapos ng pelikula, hindi lang si Sunshine ang magegets mo kundi ang iba pang mga kababaihan.""Only a day had passed since I've seen the film at the theaters. Tears were shed, thoughts were running through my head, frozen in my seat as I was left in awe during the credits not only because of the impeccable performance of the casts, but how it hits close to home for those women who have gone through the same hell as Sunshine especially in this country.I may never experience the same thing nor find myself in the same situation, but I totally understood her. Gets ko si Sunshine. God forbid a young girl who has dreams for her future, and none of them yet is bringing an unwanted offspring to this messed up world with an inequitable and dysfunctional system.",-1

Sunshine,"It is refreshing to see such a brave filmmaker like Antoinette Jadaone take on such a taboo topic as this, and despite its obvious flaws, there is so much to be celebrated about ""Sunshine"". Her depiction of realist Manila within a predominantly Catholic albeit judgmental Philippines is strikingly affecting, and the first half of this in particular is a worthy showcase of great filmmaking. The plot device did take me out of the film from time to time, and I do not think it was necessary nor was it effective. Yet, what more can you ask for when you have such a riveting turn from Maris Racal, who puts forward a performance for the ages. Those around her are also excellent, particularly Jennica Garcia, who embodies so much heart and emotion in the little scenes that she is in. Could this have been a better film? Yes. But is it one that is worth seeing? Absolutely.[Watched at SM Mall of Asia cinemas]",-1
Sunshine,"“drown out the noise.”easier said than done when the noise is everything.the streets of Maynila. the train. the coach. the prayers. the stares. the guilt.Sunshine isn’t just a film about a girl with Olympic dreams and an unplanned pregnancy. it’s about how loud the world gets when you’re no longer allowed to dream. the kind of noise that follows you into cramped maternity wards, judgmental glances, and conversations that aren’t even about you, but your body.it’s claustrophobic — not just visually, but emotionally. the tight shots mimic how it feels to be backed into a corner: by family, religion, institutions, and the echo of “what will people say?” that never stops ringing. there’s no space to move. no time to think. just pressure.this is a strong film. one that dares to confront the Philippines’ obsession with purity, shame, and control. it pulls back the curtain on a country where reproductive health is taboo. it also shows the quiet fear around abortion — how it’s never really said out loud, but always there, hiding under the surface. a real choice that girls are never allowed to make. where the system will preach “life is sacred,” but give you a plastic chair in an overcrowded ward and leave you to figure it out alone.sure, it plays it safe sometimes — there are parts where you wish it pushed a little more. but it still says a lot, even in quiet moments.Sunshine doesn’t claim to have all the answers. but it knows the questions that need to be asked.about bodily autonomy. about access to care. about what it really means to grow up in a place that punishes girls for being girls.APAKAHUSAY NYO MS TONET AT MARIS!",-1

Sunshine,"sunshine gets me SO BAD. apart from being a woman– but also as a dancer, a sister, and ultimately a dreamerthe roles she acted out were fairly distributed, mainly siguro of the mental dilemmas that came with making her decisions. like the peptalks before dancing a routine, the eye contact with her sister ensuring her support, the firmness of getting rid of the baby. LEGIT CRAZYY seeing the rawness of it all. to think that these experiences aren't even new– just ones that are drowned out cuz it's easier to advise people to follow societal norms, when life is realllyyyy really much more complexhands down on how this film amplifies the woman experience without shouting all over your face. i'm all for dealing with the consequences of our actions– but there's really so so many ways to be responsible for it",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine.I watched last Saturday pero andun pa rin kaluluwa ko sa sinehan.Andami ko gusto kong sabihin pero hanggang ngayon speechless pa rin ako.Pero ito sure ako, dadalhin kita na para bang pagtindig natin para sa pag-asa nung 2022 election. Mahirap maging babae pero parang mas mahirap manatiling tahimik.",3
Sunshine,"choosing motherhood is noble, but so is pursuing your dream",-1
Sunshine,"the world is unforgiving to womenlike the corners of manila that bore witness to sunshine and her quiet struggle, like the santo niños in quiapo that hide fatality, a risk to escape a life that was never theirs to carry. like the church that stands in the midst of relentless shame.the world is unforgiving to women, where desire is almost always consequence for who were born to bear its fruit yet never a sliver of guilt from those who took part in it.the world is unforgiving to women yet it expects so much. so much burden to carry. so much life to spend carrying. with only sisters, other women, to carry it with, to lighten the load.rarely has a film induced so much crying from me. it’s not perfect, but it hit a part of me that mourns for our women, for the lives that have forever been altered by the lack of knowledge and autonomy and conversation. and still, everywhere there are quiet ways that we hold each other through it all.",7

PERO SOBRANG GALING. sobrang tapang ng pagkakagawa at sana yung mensahe ng pelikulang ito ay makaabot sa mga taong hindi pa bukas sa ganitong topic. hindi pa naman huli ang lahat. sunshine, gets ka namin. para sa sarili mo. para sa pangarap mo.",6

Sunshine,"Log ko lang pero maris racal best actress of the year!-So ito na nga,Bitch i thought rurok na ni direk tonette yung fan girl. Who would’ve thought that she would write and direct a film again that focuses on societal issue and systemic oppression. Also, Maris! Grabe. She’s so good that I want to hug Sunshine from the screen. I just hope na mapanood ‘to ng mas maraming tao.Pero yung totoong rurok dito? ‘Yung pagiging hipokrito’t pagiging self-righteous ng bansang ‘to.The government would call for anything progression but would never do anything for progression.",-1
Sunshine,"Ang husay ni Maris!!! that's a movie star right there! Dama ko yung bigat, takot, at sakit na dinadala niya. Mula simula hanggang huli niruroot ko ang tagumpay ni Sunshine at pagpili niya sa kanyang pangarap. Buti na lang nakahanap siya nang ligtas na makatutulong sakanya at mayroon siyang magandang support system. Yung iyak ko sa scene nila ng ate niya!Ang lakas din maka catholic guilt nung doktora jusko po! pero sobrang makatotohanan sa disposisyon ng maraming pilipino sa usaping abortion. at TANGINA NI MIGGY WALA KANG KWENTA! nung nag ""i love you"" siya gusto ko nang pumasok sa eksena at hambalusin siya ng upuan.Ang sakit sa puso na may mga babae lalo na mga kabataan ang dumadaan sa delikadong paraan para magpalaglag. Nawa'y magsilbing eye opener ang Sunshine para ma-decriminalize ang abortion sa Pilipinas. It's high time na makapanood naman ng ibang pananaw ukol sa abortion hindi yung nakagawiang inaantagonize ito sa mga palabas.Sobrang tumatak sakin yung final scene ni Sunshine at bata habang pinapractice niya yung routine niya tapos nagyakapan sila at sinabi ni bata, ""gets ko na"". Ang ganda nung pagkakabuo sa eksena kuhang kuha hagulgol ko. Sunshine movie of the year!!!",6
Sunshine,"not to be overdramatic but i would die for the women in my life. i love them so much. it brings me to tears to think that these are our realities—sometimes much worse. but, we will always have each other and that has to mean a whole lot. i would be empty without them.",7
Sunshine,"this, to me, was a case of loving the purpose more than the execution. i really had a lot of expectations having been waiting to see this since about a year ago. nevertheless, a must watch. magthank you tayo kay papa god at mayroon tayo ng pelikulang ito! sidenote: i want to eat this poster",-1
Sunshine,"Watching Sunshine wasn’t just watching a movie. Parang I was sitting beside a woman, listening to her story ng tahimik lang, pero sobrang bigat. It’s not easy to watch, but that’s exactly why it felt so real. What hit me the most was how the film didn’t try to be loud or preachy. The film doesn’t try to romanticize or a free promotion for abortion. It just let the silence do the work. Minsan iyak lang, minsan wala talagang salita. That makes it more powerful. Hindi ito simpleng kwento. It’s about pain, dreams, and mga choices na hindi talaga madaling pagpilian.Pero I have to say, may parts na medyo kulang for me. Sana mas dark yung cinematography, like Khalel 15 — gritty and raw. Lastly, hindi ito movie para sa lahat. But still, Sunshine gives us something real. And if you’re willing to sit with it and really listen, then you’ll see a side of womanhood na madalas tinatago.",-1

Sunshine,Nanganak din pala si Sassa,1
Sunshine,":)) wala akong matres pero sobra akong naka relate sa pelikulang ito. bakit?nakita ko ang sarili ko kay annika (yung bata). :))malinaw ang ipinaglalaban ng pelikula. maganda ang script. hindi ko alam kung medyo napa OA sa pagkadilim yung pelikula or sadyang pangit lang ang quality ng sinehan dito sa atin. maganda sana siguro kung maayos yung projection. ngunit ang storya ng pelikula ang pinaka mahalagang aspeto neto at sa pagkakataon ito, dahil sa nakamamanghang storya na ipinakita sa pelikulang ito, kaya kong isantabi ang mga teknikal na mga bagay na ito.sa mga artista...i am personally a fan of maris, annika, and jennica before this film. maris delivered. may something sa kaniya na i cannot still put a finger at but anw, i hope she get to act more on the big screen.i think the role of that young girl was made for annika.i also want to see jennica in a lead role on the big screen.all in all, silang tatlo was the best choice for their roles. i cannot see other actresses that can replace them. kay direk jadaone...idk pero kitang kita mo yung artistry sa mga pelikula niya. ewan ko pero ramdam na ramdam ko yung respeto niya sa film industry sa mga pelikula niya. na para bang bawats scrne, bawat anggulo, may dahilan.i hope to watch more films by her. :))yun lang hehe",3
Sunshine,"Mula pa lang sa trailer, alam ko na—hindi ko puwedeng palampasin ang pelikulang ito. Direk Tonet ‘yan, eh. May tiwala ako sa kakayahan niyang gawing matula ang trahedya, at gawing tahimik pero mabigat ang mga sigaw ng kababaihan sa lipunang laging inuuna ang hiya kaysa sa hustisya.Isa sa mga personal na dahilan kung bakit ako nanood ay dahil gusto kong unawain—hindi man buo, pero kahit konti—kung ano ang dinadala ng isang babaeng katulad ni Sunshine. Bilang isang assigned male at birth, pero hindi ganap na komportable sa label na iyon, alam kong may distansya sa pagitan namin ni Sunshine. Pero iyon mismo ang dahilan kung bakit ako nanahimik sa sinehan. Tumigil akong mag-analisa, at hayaan ang pelikula na magsalita para sa sarili nito. Hindi ko kailangang maging babae para makiramay. Pero gusto kong makiramdam. At dito, sa pelikulang ito, nagtagumpay akong maramdaman si Sunshine—ang kanyang pagkalito, galit, at takot—na para bang sarili kong laman-loob ang kinikiskis ng eksena.At sa prosesong iyon, nadama ko si Sunshine—ang pagkalito niya na hindi simpleng pagkaligaw, kundi paglalakad sa isang landas na sinabihan siyang bawal. Ang galit niyang hindi mapagsigawan, at ang takot niyang hindi inamin, pero nandoon sa bawat kumpas ng katawan niya. Maris Racal didn’t just play Sunshine—she inhabited her. She carried her, as if every scene weighed heavily on her spine, even when she stood upright. May mga eksena na walang dialogue pero mas mabigat pa sa sigawan. At doon ko nakita ang mastery ni Maris bilang aktres: ang kakayahang magsalita gamit ang pananahimik.Nakakatawang may nagsabi raw sa likod ng kamera na “haggard” siya habang nagsu-shoot. I laughed—not because it’s funny, but because it’s too real. Ganito talaga ang hitsura ng kabataang babae na araw-araw tinatanggihan ang mundo, pero hindi puwedeng mapagod. May mga Sunshine sa Quiapo, sa mga post sa Reddit, sa mga comments na deleted, sa mga babae sa jeep na tahimik lang pero may bitbit na kwento. And it takes a film like Sunshine to remind us: they are not voiceless. We just haven’t been listening.Unang tingin kay Annika, iisipin mong comic relief siya. Isang batang gumugulo sa eksena, parang pang-balanse sa bigat ng naratibo. Pero habang tumatagal, na-realize kong siya pala ang pinakamatining sa lahat. Hindi siya ordinaryong karakter—siya ang konsensya ni Sunshine. Hindi ang moralistic kind, but the invasive kind. Yung konsensyang hindi laging tama o mali, kundi nagtatanong: “Nasaan ka na?” “Handa ka ba?” “Ito ba ang gusto mong piliin?” At dahil hindi laging consistent ang paglitaw niya—minsan parang guni-guni, minsan parang totoo—mas naging epektibo siya. Kasi hindi ba ganoon din ang konsensya? It creeps in when you're alone. It arrives uninvited. In a country where abortion is taboo, Annika becomes more than a person—she’s a presence. A question. A symbol of possibility and loss, but not in a way that condemns. She’s not there to judge Sunshine, but to make us feel what it means to carry a choice you can’t share with anyone. Sa isang bansang ang moralidad ay naka-template mula sa pulpito, ang pagkakaroon ng karakter tulad ni Annika is radical. Hindi siya plot device. Isa siyang reimaginasyon ng konsensya—hindi para ipahiya ang babae, kundi ipaalala kung gaano kabigat ang dalahin sa lipunang pilit silang pinatatahimik..Ang Sunshine ay hindi pelikulang pro-choice dahil gusto nitong makipagtalo. Hindi rin ito pelikula tungkol sa abortion dahil gusto nitong mag-skandalo. Ito ay pelikula tungkol sa karapatan. Sa kakayahang pumili, kahit pa masakit ang pagpiling iyon. Sunshine doesn’t celebrate abortion—it honors the courage to face it. Sa lipunang ang kababaihan ay kailangang laging malinis, laging mabait, laging matino, heto ang isang pelikulang nagsasabing: ang katawan mo ay hindi kasalanan. Ang pagpili mo ay hindi dapat katumbas ng pagkapako.Maraming salamat, Direk Tonet. Salamat sa hindi pag-ikot sa ligtas na naratibo. Salamat sa pagbibigay ng boses sa katahimikan. Salamat sa paghubog ng pelikulang hindi lang para sa kababaihan, kundi para sa lahat ng gustong matutong makinig.Bilang isang lalaki na walang MATRES, pero may malasakit sa mga may isa, ramdam ko ang urgency ng kwento. Sunshine is not a perfect film—but it is a vital one. And in a country that rarely gives women room to speak, a film like this doesn’t just feel brave. It feels necessary.",3
Sunshine,""" Drown out the noise.""This line in the Sunshine struck me after watching the film. Noise is considered as a plot device in the film literally and figuratively. I like how the background music or the noise from the background is used to set the tone and mood of the film especially in scenes where Sunshine is walking or riding a jeep home. Noise in the film can also represent the doubts that fill her while practicing and self-righteous religious people who judge her actions throughout the film.The film is about a gymnast who plans to join the tryouts for the Olympics. However, she receives a result that is unexpectedly pregnant which can hinder her chances in getting in. Maris Racal is great in her role as Sunshine and I think that she embodies the role of a gymnast especially since she tried gymnastics to prepare for her role. There were scenes that were remarkable for me such as when she tries to hit a the mirror of a car after her boyfriend (played by Elijah Canlas) doesn't take responsibility for her pregnancy. I also loved the supporting characters as well. Despite their small roles, they made a mark for me. For instance, Jennica Garcia was impressive in her scenes with Maris Racal as her older sister. You can feel that she defends and protects her sister and stay by her side especially during her revelation that she is pregnant. Xyriel Manabat is no surprise for me since I admire her acting skills since she was a child actress. She is great as Sunshine's best friend. Annika Co, an upcoming child actress, is a scene stealer where she acts as a conscience to Sunshine. She is charming and witty in her role and I think the twist made sense to me in one scene.In addition to it being a sports drama, this film also tackled the themes of women's choice and abortion. These topics are considered sensitive and taboo in a dominant Catholic and conservative society. As a man, this film moved me and realize how hard it is to be a woman in a society wherethey are judged for having an autonomy in their body. In a third world country, healthcare is considered a privilege especially for the poor. Because of abortion being considered illegal and immoral, women are forced to resort to unsafe practices which can endanger them. It is shown in the film and I think it's interesting that it depicted two doctors: one which discriminates women because of her religious bias and one which tried to understand and helped another character in the film who turned to abortion. It's a sad reality, but I'm glad that this film will open conversations about themes like these.Overall, I find Sunshine an impressive film. I think this is Antonette Jadaone's best film so far. It's my second film that I've seen in cinemas and I'm grateful to witness it in the big screen because it is worth the watch there with its immersive experience. I was definitely looking forward to it since it's rare to watch a sports film which centers around gymnastics and it has been shown in film festivals abroad. I was worried that it won't be shown here because of how controversial it would be because of the stand of the Catholic Church and other religious sectors regarding abortion. I guess more people are more open-minded towards the topics unlike before. Aside from the acting, what I found compelling in the film is the cinematography and scoring which adds tension and mood to the it. Despite its limited release and pitted against two superhero films during its premiere, I really hope more people will get a chance to watch this movie. Even if it shows the harsh realities of life and in sports, I agree with other film critics that it also shows hope. There is Sunshine after the rain.",-1

Sunshine,"Suporta ang kailangan ng kababaihan. Sa palakasan, sa pagbubuntis, sa aborsyon, sa desisyon sa sarili nilang katawan. Nakita sa pelikula ang kawalan ng suporta ng gobyerno sa sports, maternal care at access sa safe abortion. Nakakaantig itong masaksihan mula sa pananaw ng isang atletang di inaasahang nabuntis. ""Gets ko na""sana ma-gets din ng ibaALSO THEY CAN NEVER MAKE ME HATE YOU MARIS RACAL!",3
Sunshine,"dili ako umiyak pag nanonood ng mga pelikula pero kakaiba talaga to. grabe. tiwala lang, sunshine. sa kabila ng mga lalaking mapagsamantala't walang kwenta at mga ipokritong nagpapanggap na doktor, madadatnan mo rin ang kabutihan na kailangan mo.putangina nga pala ni miggy. isteryotipikong lalaking nasa titi yung utak. kung ako lang yung nagbasag ng kotse niya binasag ko na rin mukha niya.",3
Sunshine,"No doubt my favorite Jadaone film, Sunshine is not only an important work of art in a cultural context, but an objectively beautiful, clean and concise narrative work. What I mean is not a single frame is wasted, or given up for style points - every decision of performance, framing and pace is made to serve the story, to make us empathize with Sunshine, to feel what she feels.Woman vs the institution - the clarity of this theme is just so powerful, yet we’re brought into Sunshine’s world through masterful camerawork that just feels honest. There’s a shot I love, where Sunshine is framed inside a window (in her room then in a motel), and the chaos of the city goes on about her, uncaring and apathetic to her situation. That’s the whole movie - the slow-burning horror that she is being shunned by society, cramped into tiny spaces trying to survive. It made me cringe to hear the chants of “Pilipinas” by the crowd in her performance at the end (the sad reality of Filipino athletes, unsupported in training yet celebrated in victory)Maris Racal’s best performance. The care and dedication she brought to the role should be applauded. Everyone else in the movie is so dialed in too, a subtle superpower of Direk Tonet’s ear for relatable acting and dialogue. Also love the Pastor P appearance, who brings such an important discussion into the public consciousness. The ultimate boss level: God & practicality vs the woman’s decision.Instant classic!",17
Sunshine,"“Sunshine” gripped my soul and left me hollow with unease. the first ten minutes we follow Sunshine as she drifts aimlessly through the restless streets of Manila, and that’s how the entire film feels. yes, it’s sending a message, but watching her spiral felt almost voyeuristic, as if we were witnessing something intimate and illegal. no propaganda, just raw, heartbreaking truth.and as much as i hate comparing directors, the rawness of each frame felt deeply “Brocka” but captured through the tenderness and gaze of a woman. at the film’s core is Maris Racal, exceptional in her quiet nuance, supported beautifully by Jennica Garcia.this film will linger with me for days. it’s about the cruelty of the world, the ache of aspirations, the fragile hope for a better life, and, ultimately, a woman’s choice.And at the center of it all, I love when a woman chooses herself.",-1
Sunshine,OMEYAK LANG AKO,1
Sunshine,"sobrang halaga sa akin ng sunshine dahil hindi lang karapatan ng kababaihan ang buhat nitong adbokasiya, kung hindi pati na rin ang karapatan ng kabataan na madalas isinasantabi lang sa usapin ng reproductive health. kung ang tema ay tungkol sa pagiging pro-choice lang, magwowork pa rin naman yung kwento kung young adult o di kaya’y isang full grown woman si sunshine. pero siya ay isang teenager—bata sa mata ng batas at babae sa mata ng lipunan. eventually, titignan na rin siya bilang isang babae na lang dulot ng kanyang pagkabuntis, na para bang nawawala agad ang pagkabata porket may dinadalang bata.doble ang pasan ng teenage pregnancy, dahil bilang bata o babae man, wala silang say sa sarili nilang katawan. kulang pa ang impormasyon at rekurso kapag kailangan na nila, making them even more vulnerable sa panganib. tulad ni sunshine, marami ang natutukso sa mga ilegal at nakamamatay na paraan para lang ipaglaban ang karapatan nila sa sariling katawan, dahil wala silang natatanggap na anumang uri ng suporta. mas pinahahalagahan ng lipunan ang buhay na namumuo pa lang sa sinapupunan kesa ang buhay na nariyan na. kaya bukod sa panawagan para sa legal na proteksyon sa autonomy ng kababaihan at dekalidad na healthcare system, lumilitaw rin sa pelikula ang agarang pangangailangan natin para sa comprehensive sex education na siyang magpoprovide ng necessary and appropriate resources sa mga bata tungkol sa sex, contraception, consent, at iba pang mga kaugnay na bagay na gagabay sa kanila para tahakin ito nang ligtas at malay.sana ipalabas pa ito sa mas malawak na audience huhu kelangan to ipakilala at idiin sa consciousness ng mga pilipino ngayon din!!!",3
Sunshine,"Solid pa rin sa pangalawang nood. Mas nag-focus ako sa details this time. At mas kasama ko si Sunshine this time, sa buong pagtakbo niya at sa lahat ng ingay.my FIRST rewatch of Sunshine at the cinemas. with my friends + pa-talkback din with direk Tonet and Inah. what a day! ",2
Sunshine,"""gets ko na""a moment in this film that really struck me was the last scene with sunshine and her almost child — that could've been me to my mom. my parents were teenagers when they had me, and my mom told me na she tried buying pamparegla from quiapo before, but her parents stopped her saying it was a horrendous sin kay Lord. if she had chosen to live her life without me existing, i would thank her for it. gets na gets ko siya. i hope this film will successfully convey its message to the viewers, and serve as an eye-opener for those who believe that a woman doesn't have a choice.rhed bustamante's character as a 13-year old who was sa'd by her tito reflects the reality of a lot of women — girls even, cause she's not even an adult yet. abortion being illegal in the philippines doesn't stop people from doing it, hence it leads them to doing it in a horrifying and deadly way. pamparegla pills and hilot are ways people resort to because of abortion being inaccessible here in our country. tapos nung na-ospital siya hindi pa ginamot? tangina talaga ng mga lalaki! thank you dra. helena for your life!to all anti-abortion out there, i hope this film reaches you. if it's not convenient for you, then okay, but at least think about those who really need it. overall, this film is such a great commentary on how women aren't always meant to be mothers, and that one failure won't ever stop you from reaching your dreams. to all sunshine's out there, kapit lang :))",-1
Sunshine,"salamat sa buhay mo, direk tonet!",0
Sunshine,"“Sunshine” is more than a film, it is a visceral, unflinching portrait of womanhood in the Philippines. It gives voice not only to the silenced narratives about teenage pregnancy and abortion, but also to the layered realities of how Filipinas live, dream, suffer, and survive amid the relentless chaos of urban life. It dares to confront uncomfortable truths.The cinematography is superb! Every shot is meticulously composed to convey the oppressive density of Manila. The stress is not just seen, it is felt. Salamat, direk Tonet! This is a big contribution to the success of Philippine cinema.",12
Sunshine,"many reasons why i absolutely loved this movie: 1) watched it w someone who is very dear to me (hi angel if you’re seeing this)2) the actors3) the story it tells 4) what this film means for the future of abortion and RH in the PHok now lets go point by point starting at no. 2. hoping the people reading this dont think im intellectualizing my review or whatever bc i just have a lot of thoughts and i couldnt sleep so im writing this now…2) actorsits lined up with amazing, talented actors so it’s absolutely a no-brainer that they would all deliver their lines stunningly. however, each character brought out such vivid emotions that i believe only their respective actor/actress could bring out. props to the casting director and direk jadaone for this. i first give my flowers to elijah canlas and piolo pascual. honestly believe that no other pair of actors could portray this father-son, catholic tandem better. elijah weirdly embodies the annoying, conyo, gago actor really well, while piolo is no stranger to playing a overt Catholic. i also am all praise for xyriel, meryll, and jennica. the women in the film who, in a world that is cruel, chose to be kind, especially to Sunshine. i praise jennica especially because with every line recited, you can feel her character’s exhaustion of having to give up their dreams and forcing themselves to accept their reality in an unforgiving society, as if she had a choice. of course, annika co is also a standout star here. though a rookie in the industry, i loved seeing her on the big screen. lastly, maris. no one can play Sunshine but Maris Racal. i fear i have to make a separate review on her solely. i hope she bags many, many awards because she deserves it. 3) the story it tellsthe story of Sunshine is one that I, as a woman, have encountered many times. while post-debrief, i recounted the amount of times i was told a former schoolmate of mine became a teenage mother, and i thought about all of the dreams they had to give up simply because they had no choice. even in this film, Sunshine’s reality painted her to have little to no choice at all. while it’s not a new narrative, it’s a narrative that’s stuck in the past—in traditional, old, conservative Philippine society, which is why movies like Sunshine feel so refreshing. it strives to go beyond what society is now. 4) what this film means for the future of abortion and RH in the PHthe fact that a film like this was produced and is being shown during a time where, globally, conservatism is on the rise and the Philippines is nowhere close to even considering the decriminalization of abortion, is already something revolutionary in itself. hopefully, this movie opens more doors to more discussions on abortion and bodily autonomy. i really have lots of respect for direk tonette and Maris for being at the forefront of what could be the beginning of the creation of a bigger platform for many women across the country to speak about autonomy and choice.",5

Sunshine,"it’s worth mentioning that other than the discussion of women’s bodily autonomy, there is also solidarity observed with the female characters within the story. and i like how it is handled not in a romanticized or villainized manner, but of compassion and empathy. i like that. i hope this movie opens the minds of those who wish or are curious to watch the film. :)",36
Sunshine,teka lang!!! let me process my thoughts!,0
Sunshine,"manila in its barest, philippine societal system in its most oppressive on women, patriarchy in its sharpest teeth clenched tightly on women leaving them bloody (literally and figuratively), long held religious beliefs in its firmest grip leaving many more regressive, and most of all love and support system in its purest and most tender. i keep wondering by the end about the women who weren’t given the privilege to choose, those like mary grace, those who never had the support they needed when faced with the same dilemma, those who’ve braved the use of unconventional means of abortion and may have almost died or indeed died. i wonder of their dreams, of their autonomy, of the life they have to face. and this is a reality lived by many women in the philippines, that despite the film leaving on a positive note, i just cant help but think: this world isn’t built for women to thrive, instead it’s a world where they have to fight tooth and nail just to survive, and in the film, to just get the basic need of a choice over their body. a world crafted where men’s needs and wants are at the forefront, and where women would have to beg to even be considered.",-1
Sunshine,"first ever review!! new lang sa letterboxd xDD i enjoy being here! AND it really calls me to put some review sa film:_)truly every movie we watched leaves a mark but this cut deeper. mahirap maging babae sa sistemang dini-dismiss ka. hirap. sobrang ganda ng lahat, pati personality ng quiapo, na kahit gabi sa maynila, maingay pa rin. sa public hospital na halos tabi-tabi at yung mga pasyente na lang din nag tutulungan. ito kasi yung realidad na hindi alam ng karamihan, na hindi maintindihan ng ilan na walang ginawa kundi magsimba at maging komportable sa buhay.and i was wishing that it reaches those people, i hope they sit with the same uncomfortable feeling that the characters had. i hope it twisted their minds, to make them think. i hope it bleeds them just as how their ""beliefs"" put women in danger by denying abortion.lahat ng bida sa pelikula ay babae :'DD i have no intention to romanticize their circumstances, and it aches and comfort that there is warmth against all of it, na assurance na kasama pa rin ng mga kababaihan, natin, yung isa't isa.",6
Sunshine,"the very experience of breaking down on public transportation while hev abi blasts through the speakers lol. kidding aside—hay, grabe. this film feels like being punched in the gut, only to be offered a warm hug right after.growing up as a woman means being taught to feel shame about everything. liking sex. not liking sex.getting pregnant too early. getting pregnant too late.being too submissive to men. not being submissive enough.getting married. not getting married.prioritizing your career. choosing to be a stay-at-home mom.and the list goes on. just full of contradictions.that's why i cannot emphasize enough how much i love the film's concept: a woman saving a woman saving another woman. sunshine’s sister standing up for her. her saving mary grace. her friend. her coach. the doctor. even the pregnant women na nagpapaypay sa kanya while she’s unconscious. just women looking out for each other.i watched this in the cinema, and when i went to the ladies' comfort room after the credits rolled, lahat kami mugto ang mata. i think we had all seen parts of ourselves reflected back at us. and it hurt. but it also healed.i hope more stories like this are told. i hope more women continue to take up space, hold each other close, and do whatever the hell they want. without apology, without SHAME.p.s. it couldn't have been anyone else but maris <33",5
Sunshine,"beautifully acted and well written. there’s a sharp, dark humor threaded in its dialogues on sex, childbirth, & dreams, an unflinching tone that never really leaves u, and a quiet reality of sunshine that mirrors so much of what we rarely say out loud. a combination that truly amplifies the much needed conversation that this film advocates—one that gently but firmly questions our sense of life, morality, and the cost of it all. also, i’m a big fan of the jadaone-racal duo like shet ang galing potaena sana gets niyo! #marisracalapologist",-1
Sunshine,"a powerful statement regarding womens body autonomy, “show, dont tell” tasteful undertones of the controlling patriarch as shown by Pastor Jaime (Piolo Pascual) assumed on Sunshines unborn child, the girl following Sunshine around condemning her every decision is the perfect representation of catholic guilt, and how limiting/dangerous abortion laws in the philippines are for the impoverished that result in life-threatening “end of the road” solutions. not a stretch to say that this is one of the best filipino movies i…",-1
Sunshine,"This film deserves all its flowers!! Atmospheric enough to make the viewer feel they are INSIDE the Philippines. All those shots of the streets in Quiapo?? 10/10. I loved the beauty and the ugly - the choice of Sunshine being a gymnast is such a great metaphor for being a woman in this world. The use of the noise of the LRT and the contrast of taking the sound away, literally makes me feel like I'm in Sunshine's head! And…",12
Sunshine,it felt like watching a documentary film at a point (positive) and i loved the consistent storytelling and how each scene were weaved together. also the lines being reused multiple times but in different contexts? peak writingsunshine being able to make a choice for herself made me so proud. her knowing what she truly wants and achieving it - i hope every woman gets to do the same. ps. the actor for the preachy doctor was so good i almost wanted to fight her ,36
Sunshine,"""Abortion is a sin but i want to follow my dreams"" ABORTION IS NOT A MURDER NOR A SIN, OKAY?? FUCK THEM KIDS AND FUCK MIGGY, BOBOT AND ALL THE MEN LIKE THEM!",4
Sunshine,"“drown out the noise.”sunshine tramples on both internal and external noises—judgment, fear, catholic guilt, and desperate prayers; the chaos that quietly unfolds in the dark streets of manila, and the ironies existing at the heart of folk-catholicism as underground, unsafe abortion exists steps away from a sacred ground. it’s impossible for sunshine—for women—to drown out the noise. My favorite detail in this movie is the portrayal of different women, each with her own turmoil, resources, and stage in life, struggling in a deeply patriarchal and faith-bound society, while still finding the strength to stand for each other. wala nang ibang makakaunawa at dadamay sa paghihirap ng pagiging babae kundi kapwa mga babae.this film is dark, heavy, and uncomfortable to watch (as it should) but necessary. it shatters your core and makes you question how far can religious ideas go in a hostile and punishing society.

Sunshine,"we need to open up a conversation. stat.about manila. about how quiapo has its own pulse.about commuting. about the air in your ponytail in the jeepney.about motel rooms. about pleasure in the darkness, for cheap, coerced, manipulative f*cks.about the repercussions of said f*cks. about how shameful it is to live with it in a place with ever-pointing fingers and watchful eyes.about motherhood. about how it isn't as glam when you're not as ready for it.about sports. about how athletes stand on their own two feet, sans government support.about the sunshines in our own circle. about the decisions you never really made but lived with anyway. about the dreams you chased with a sprained ankle.the ribbons you twirled and ripped.the jerseys you wore until they were worn out.the maternity clothes in your shopping cart.but what choice do you have?the answer is none.because how do you live in a country that is against you?in a system that is made for you to break, slowly, agonizingly?in places of pity and shame, how do you rise?in breaking glass windows and cages, who cheers you on?in places where the sun is scarce and the skies are dark, who forges your shine?",-1
Sunshine,"I love my mother so much. For me, she’s the best woman in the world - the only woman I love with all my heart. I enjoy Filipino films because of her influence - she loved classic Filipino films. She loved Sharon Cuneta. She loved Aldub. But I recently learned that she once dreamed of becoming a flight stewardess - a dream I never knew she had.I only learned about this and other stories of the woman I thought I knew when her sister shared them with us during a visit this year. That’s when the realization sank in, I knew my mom, but not the little girl she used to be - the one with so many dreams. A probinsyana with this dream of going around the world. But she had me (I'm the eldest) when she was eighteen. Unplanned. She said she never regretted itBut I remember when I was young, she drowned herself with alcohol almost every day. Now, I understand. She never had a choice. I'm happy that she is my mother. But it also hurts me to know that she could be in a better place -pursuing her dreams, seeing the world - if not because of me. This film got me because I hope my mom had a choice at that time. I loved her so much, but I hope in her next life, she chooses her dreams.",-1
Sunshine,"SUNSHINE advances itself as a film about bodily autonomy in a nation that denies its very terminology, yet it does so through the insulated idiom of psychological realism rather than the concretised mapping of the material conditions that make autonomy, abortion, and girlhood existentially precarious. We are immersed in affect, but the structure underpinning these sensations is left either ambient or altogether unrendered. Yes, the pharmacy exists as a moral space and the hospital as carceral, but where is the livelihood? Who funds the training? What does it mean, materially, to be a 19-year-old athlete—and an international one, at that—with no visible labouring parent and no bread line to back it up?Abortion is outlawed in the Philippines because it preserves state-church power and results in the reproductive labour of the poor as exploitable and their agency criminal, but to bracket class from the narrative—in a context where economic vulnerability is the foremost determinant of reproductive injustice—is consequential. Instead, the endless deferral into mood, while expressive, is in itself a seductive alibi for political disengagement. I understand that this is a film of interiority—that the point is to reflect Sunshine’s constrained perceptual field—but her interiority is a response to economic realities that the film chooses to elude, and when the audience is asked to interpolate systemic weight from ambience without any clear depiction of how deprivation functions, what we get is an abstraction that parades as empathy, and from that abstraction, other evasions proliferate: the neoliberal myth of the meritocratic athlete, whose suffering must be understood as psychological strain rather than as infrastructural abandonment; the convenient fiction that ambition alone propels a body through state-sponsored regimes without subsidy or the material realities the film forgoes. To abstract oppression into psychic distress then, while refusing its logistical origins, is to risk reproducing the same symbolic economy the Church relies upon: one in which the body is meaningful only as a metaphor and a vessel onto which morality is projected.This aesthetic disposition of interiority is of course obviously a structure inherited from the exportable idiom of European festival realism where the trauma of the Filipina is depicted legibly for the global North. From this perspective, it would make sense that the institutions that manufacture her precarity are rendered as emotional rather than historical, inviting the audience to feel with her but never to account—but by doing so, what emerges is not so much a Filipino film but a Filipino offering: an artefact of pain rendered in tones familiar to jurors abroad, a choice that aligns seamlessly with both (1) Jadaone’s career pivot into the international circuit, having premiered the film at Berlinale and TIFF, and (2) the film’s own final sequence: Sunshine performing her routine at the SEA games before a panel of foreign adjudicators, body taut and calibrated for approval by those who will never understand the weight of what she forfeited to arrive there. By naming these two parallels do we metabolise the rage of a system into something palatable and interpretable, and since both Jadaone and Sunshine must contort to be seen, in being seen, they are asked to become less what they mean. Perhaps the question is not whether SUNSHINE fails as a film or recedes as an offering, but whether it was ever permitted the autonomy to be anything else—whether within the landscape of Philippine cinema, where funding is precarious, distribution systems anaemic, and state culture support present only for the films that do not threaten it, a film like SUNSHINE must already enter the frame pre-legibilised and pre-digested, its rage ironed out for export. This is, after all, by the admission of its own producer Bianca Balbuena, a film that delayed its domestic release in order ‘to premiere in top festivals [around] the world to create noise and curiosity’, with the implication that only through international approval could the film attain enough value to justify its own existence at home. Thus, to resist the very circuit that enables its existence is impossible, but recognising this sharpens our understanding of the conditions under which those evasions occur. What we must ask, then, is what kind of complicity we are willing to forgive in a nation that punishes truth so severely that even its cinema must contort just to be heard.",-1

Sunshine,"Quiapo has always felt like a contradiction. It's a district that thrives on both holiness and hustle, tradition and survival, all crammed into claustrophobic, identical alleyways. At its heart stands a towering church, surrounded by vendors selling everything: street food, religious images, herbal medicines, fake documents, sex toys, and abortion kits – pamparegla. The irony writes itself. And yet, that's where people are forced to go when they're desperate. Like Sunshine.Sunshine (Maris Racal) is a gymnast on the rise who discovers she's pregnant before a major competition – just as her future starts to tighten around her. The plot is simple, but never small. What unfolds is a slow, steady panic of a young woman trying to figure things out in a country that offers her no real choices. You feel the weight that she's carrying, not just in her silence, but in her body. She's holding so much in, almost willing it all to be a fever dream. But beneath that restraint is a quiet rage — in her posture, in her breath, in the way she fights to keep it all together.The movie doesn't try to frame anything as heroic or tragic, and that's what makes it powerful. What stood out most to me was how angry, how fearless, it allows itself to be. It simmers. Controlled, but with crushing intensity. This is Direk Tonet's best work to date. It's her most honest and her most focused. And you can tell she did this with immense care. The love is in the details.",28

Sunshine,"DI AKO NANGHINAYANG SA BINAYAD KO.Sobrang napukaw ng atensyon ko kung gaano ka realistic ang bawat eksena, ang ingay at lagkitan sa maynila, ang mga deboto ng quiapo church, ang mga ale na nagtitinda ng pamparegla at pampalaglag sa harap ng simbahan, ang kahirapan, ang unwanted pregnancy, ang krisis sa healthcare system, ang aborsyon at ang konsensya ni sunshine na hinahabol sya bawat minuto ng kanyang araw. it really captured every struggles ng pagiging babae sa bansang to. Sobrang raw, sobrang totoo at sobrang tapang ni direk tonet sa paggawa ng gantong pelikula na sana marami pa ang makapanood. Also, the performance of THE Maris Racal. Dalang dala nya ang emosyon ng manonood, the rage, pain, and bravery of Sunshine. Isa sa talagang nagpa agos ng luha ko ay ang eksena na sumasayaw sya, nakangiti pero ramdam mo ang bawat emosyon. Grabe ang scene na yun, walang dialogue pero tagos sa puso!! It was really indeed the best performance of her. And that ending, i love how direk tonet didnt show what happens to the unborn child, and pinakita na lang na nakaabot sya sa competition, it just shows na ang pagkakaroon ng choice ay magsasalba sa mga pangarap na minsan ng kinain ng sistema ng bansang ito. Gets na gets kita, Sunshine bago ko pa ito panoorin at sana magets ka na rin nila.Ginawa ang pelikula na to hindi lang para sa mga babae, ginawa ito para ipakita sa mga taong hindi nakakaintindi ang reyalidad ni Sunshine. Mahal kita direk tonet sobra!!!",3
Sunshine,"This film gives you the opportunity to judge Sunshine & her decision-making as she deals with the consequences of an act she did not commit alone yet had to face entirely by herself. Dahil sa sistema at mga paniniwalang hindi pabor sa mga kababaihan.After watching, you might say “gets ko na” as you start to understand how they feel & where they’re coming from. Unfortunately, that’s only the tip of the iceberg. You must also imagine the lives of all other Sunshines out there whose stories remain unheard and unseen. In the real world setting, you no longer have access to every woman’s story. But through Sunshine, you gain something just as important: empathy and understanding. And maybe— just maybe— hindi naman matatapakan ang pagkatao mo if you simply allow women the freedom to decide for their own lives. Kudos to Maris Racal for beautifully executing the role of Sunshine and to Direk Jadaone for passionately pushing this brave and controversial work of art!",-1
Sunshine,"It takes a village, but that village needs to be better, especially for women. Whether that’s here in the Philippines or in the rest of the world. I hope people from all facets of our society can watch this movie and leave with a more compassionate attitude towards women with unwanted pregnancies. I can only hope the message of this can resonate and make us consider more material support for them, beyond the compassion we ought to show them. Oh, and legalize abortion now. #prochoice",13

Sunshine,"It speaks about womanhood, choices, and silence. It shows the grief, the doubt, and the quiet power of a woman choosing herself in a world that rarely lets her.At sa isang bansang tulad ng Pilipinas kung saan kriminal pa rin ang abortion, pelikulang kagaya nito ay hindi lang mahalaga-KAILANGAN. This is why stories like Sunshine matter. They don't just tell— they challenge. They peel back the shame, the fear, the silence.Kaya habang nanonood ako, ang tanong ko na hindi ko na matiis:Hanggang kailan magiging krimen ang pagpili para sa sariling katawan?Hanggang kailan natin ipagkakait ang dignidad ng babae sa gitna ng pagdurusa?",-1

Sunshine,"One of the strongest films I’ve seen in a while when it comes to making a statement. I went through something that felt like a pregnancy scare not long ago, and those days after finding out were chaotic—existential-crising to the core. Sunshine captured that experience so accurately and beautifully. The desperation, the attempts at proper reasoning.. it was all there. It all made sense. The compositions were intentional and looked damn good too.Nandito kami para sayo, Sunshine.",-1
Sunshine,"Grabe, akala ko chill solo date lang yung panonood ko neto pero halo-halong emosyon naramdaman ko habang palabas ako sa sinehan.Grabe, ang galing ni Maris. Damang dama ko yung kaba, hirap, at takot nya. Hindi mahirap mag empathize kay Sunshine dahil sobrang galing ng pagkakaportray sa character nya.Mahigpit na yakap sa mga Sunshine at Menggay, at malakas na sapak kay Miggy at Bobot. Napakaunfair talaga na babae lang ang sumasalo ng hirap at nasa lalaki lahat ng sarap lol.-1 star lang dahil medyo nacornyhan ako dun sa bata. Di ko gets kung guardian angel ba sya, unborn child, or hallucination lang HAHA",3

I think of corporeality and how lovely it is to see Maris kove with such grace. The birdshot of Sunshine’s routine on the floor was beyond moving (angas ng score sa first and last!).

Sunshine,"why are women called selfish for wanting to be able to make their own choices? sunshine is a film about abortion that is so uniquely filipino. a beautiful and realistic depiction of being a woman in a very religious country. one thing i really loved is how sunshine’s faith was not diminished. her religion might have taught her that abortion is bad, but if her god is truly an all-loving and forgiving god, wouldn’t he understand why sunshine is making…",12

Sunshine,"mahal kita, sunshine! at mahal na mahal ko kayo, direk tonet, maris racal, at lahat ng mga babaeng naging parte ng kwentong ito! [4:46AM] iba yung alam mo lang, sa naiintindihan mo talaga. staying informed is one thing, but feeling it? letting it crack something open in you? ibang usapan ‘yon.alam kong masama ang aborsyon sa mata ng simbahan. lumaki akong alam 'yon; itinuro, inulit, pinaniwalaan. alam ko rin kung paano siya tinitignan ng lipunan, ng batas, ng sistemang matagal nang hindi pumapanig sa kababaihan. isang sistemang feudal, patriyarkal, mapanghusga. pinalaki tayo rito, pinalo, pinatahimik.pero alam ko rin ito: may karapatan ang babae. sa sarili niyang katawan. sa sarili niyang desisyon. at sa healthcare na hindi dapat ipinagmamakaawa, kundi kusang ibinibigay. alam ko rin na hindi dapat tinitingnan ang aborsyon sa lente ng kasalanan o krimen, na para bang awtomatikong mali ang pagpili, at masama ang pumipili. pero ang hindi ko alam, ang hindi ko kailanman mararanasan sa ganap na paraan, ay kung ano ang pakiramdam. ang bumangon araw-araw dala ang bigat ng isang desisyong walang tama sa paningin ng lahat. ang labanan hindi lang ang sarili mong konsensya, kundi ang mundong hindi kailanman kinilala ang pinagdadaanan mo, ang takot mo, ang dahilan mo.yun ang hindi ko alam. at yun ang pinaramdam sa akin ng Sunshine.and i think that's where Sunshine really succeeds. it doesn’t glorify. it doesn’t argue. it simply shows. it gives us a glimpse. into a life of a young woman, into her choice, into her pain, and the kind of quiet strength we rarely talk about. gusto lang talaga ng pelikula magkuwento tungkol sa isang babae. ang dami kong gustong himayin. but if there’s one thing that stayed with me, it’s this: Sunshine gives voice to stories we rarely hear. and maybe we avoid them kasi nga masakit. mabigat. kasi hindi tanggap ng kultura at sistemang kinalakihan natin. uncomfortable. but that’s exactly why they need to be told.what makes the film powerful is how intentional it is. every frame, every silence, every turn it didn’t take. lahat may dahilan. it could’ve been more clever. it could’ve been more dramatic. pero hindi siya nagpakitang gilas. instead, ginamit niya ‘yung simplicity para tumama. para magpa-reflect. para magpa-isip.what i appreciated most was that it didn’t force me to take a side. it didn’t try to tell me which choice was right, no matter what sunshine ended up deciding. it just asked me to listen. to sit with sunshine. to be there with her. even when things were loud & messy, even when she herself didn’t know what to do. and sometimes, that’s all people need. not answers. just space. and empathy. maraming empathy. Sunshine moved me to empathize in ways i didn’t expect i could.gusto ko rin pala i-highlight kung paano naging karakter ang maynila rito. magulo ang maynila. marumi. maingay. minsan bitag, pero minsan daan palabas. minsan parang impyerno, pero minsan parang tanging lugar na may pag-asa. sunshine moved through its chaos looking for clarity, and somehow the city mirrored her confusion. klaustro ang mga eskinita pero may mga puwang. noisy yet full of silences. manila is hysterically cruel, yes. brutal sa babae, sa mahirap, sa pagod. pero sa likod ng lahat ng ‘yon, may mga sulok na mabait. tahimik. marunong makinig. may tenderness na hindi nagpapakita, pero nandiyan; in the people who care quietly, in the moments of stillness in between the noise.and god, maris. maris fucking racal. this is hers. this is every woman’s story. she is a woman in every way that matters. alam kong magaling na siya dati pa. nakita ko na rin naman ang ibang trabaho niya. but this time, iba. masarap sa pakiramdam na makita ang isang magaling na babae na hindi nakakabit sa loveteam, walang lalaking bitbit sa screen para lang matawag na lead. walang kilig, walang branding. sakanya lang talaga ito. and that felt right. that felt important.the way she portrayed sunshine’s pain and stillness and quiet strength, it just hit. hindi siya umaarte. she wasn’t trying to convince anyone. she just was. may mga eksena na wala siyang sinasabi, pero ramdam mo lahat. nakakaiyak siya, pero hindi dahil may music o linyang mabigat. nakakaiyak kasi totoo. kasi hindi mo alam kung saan ka huhugot ng ginhawa sa pinagdadaanan niya.totoong haggard nga siya buong palabas hahaha, and it just made so much sense. ganun talaga ang itsura ng babae na napagod na. sa sarili. sa mundo. sa kakaisip ng tama. sa sistema na walang binibigay na sagot. and yet she kept going. and yet she was still trying. that look—the mess, the confusion, the exhaustion, that’s what a woman in the middle of a fight looks like. not dramatic. just human.maris, sa’yo talaga ito. no one else could’ve done it this way. no one can take this away from you. and i hope alam mo kung gaano kahalaga ang binigay mo sa pelikulang ‘to.and the women around sunshine, sila rin ang puso ng kwento. sa mata pa lang ng bawat isa, kita mo agad. hindi sila filler. hindi sila background. si jennica garcia, si annika co, si xyriel manabat, atbp. pati yung mga sandaling lumitaw lang, ang doktor, ang bantay sa motel, yung pharmacist sa botika, yung babae sa quiapo, maski yung mga babae sa maternity ward. lahat sila may dala. lahat sila may pinanggagalingan. and they all stood with sunshine in one way or another. iba-iba sila, pero iisa ng tinig. kababaihan ang nagdala ng pelikula. kababaihan ang gumising sa kwento.Sunshine isn’t easy to watch, especially if you're a woman in this country— but maybe it’s not meant to be. kasi tunay na kwento siya. and real stories don’t always comfort. they challenge. they disturb. they demand something from you. and that’s what this film did. it made me feel. it made me think.sobrang ganda napasulat tlg ako ng review. i had to sit with it for an hour or two. ang husay mo direk tonet!",3
Sunshine,"May nag-uusap kanina sa likod ko habang nanonood ako pero hinayaan ko nalang kasi nasanay na ako, tapos sakto yung scene na sumunod is yung sinabihan si Sunshine na “drown out the noise”. Okay lang sana eh kasi may libreng commentary ako, pero nung nalaman na ni Sunshine na buntis na siya, yung lalaki sa likod ko sinabi na “tatanga-tanga” siya. Medyo nawalan ako ng focus sa panonood dahil sa narinig ko kaya lumipat nalang ako ng pwesto maya-maya.Sobrang ganda ng paghandle ng movie na ‘to sa topic niya, lalo na sa bansang ‘to na sobrang sensitibo ng mga ganitong usapan kahit na hindi na naman sa ibang bansa, kaya malakas yung respeto ko sa lahat ng involved sa paggawa nito, lalo na si direk Jadaone, kasi kailangan natin ng mga pelikula katulad nito para makasimula ng pag-uusap at pagbabago sa bansang ‘to. Ang daming taong tumutol at humamon sa konsensya ni Sunshine sa iba’t ibang paraan, pagkontra sa kanya gamit ang relihiyon, ang batas, ang pera, ang kalalakihan, at iba pa. Kada sulok ng Pilipinas may matatamaan, kasama na yung nakaupo sa likod ko, at dapat lang.",-1
Sunshine,"Ang pelikulang ito ay tunay na isang sikat ng araw. Nakakasilaw. Tumatagos ang sinag. Totoo siya sa pakiramdam.Dahil totoo nga siya. Totoo si Sunshine.Matatanaw mo lang siya kapag binigyan mo ng oras ang sarili mong huminto at pansinin ang paligid. Saka mo mapagtatanto: kasama natin siya sa bawat hakbang ng kasalukuyan. Kahit sa gabi. Kahit pa sa gitna ng unos.Isa siyang payak na reyalidad—nararamdaman sa dulo ng mga daliri. Parang singaw sa paligid; halos masamyo mo sa hangin. Ganyan siya kasinsid. Ganyan siya humihingi ng pansin. Patuloy siyang lumulusot kahit sa pinakamasisikip at pinakatahimik na puwang ng kaingayan. Siya ang bumabati sa bawat umaga. At kahit sa gabi’t hapon, may iniwang peklat—mga bakas na, sa paglaon, bumubuo ng mas malaking larawan. Larawang pumupukaw sa atin tungkol sa mga madalas itinatanggi, pinatatahimik, isinasantabi. Mga bagay na totoo, at tunay namang nangyayari—ngunit ikinukubli. Tila bawal. Tila tabu. Ngunit sila pala ang tunay na bumubuo sa bilog, ngunit nananatiling hindi kinikilala sa tatsulok ng lipunan.At ang tanging hangarin ni Sunshine: na maging isa ka sa “atin.”Ako? Gets ko si Sunshine. Gets namin siya.Sana, gets din siya ng iba.",3
Sunshine,"this movie is one of the many stories of women that are failed to be heard, and one of the many reasons why i will always be for women's rights and choices.",34
Sunshine,"As a pro-choice person in the healthcare field, this is a harsh and brave storytelling of the reality in the PH. Maris is a star and the whole cast carried.",10
Sunshine,"“My body, my choice.” But is it really when your options of what you can do with it is stuck in a country overtaken by religion and politics stuck in the medieval times? Sunshine falls under one of my most favorite genres: social commentary by simply showing girls just trying to live. You can see throughout the film that she’s just a girl. Asking Miggy for money, asking for help when she needs, acts on her impulse, has dreams and goals, using twitter and Reddit for research (#real), etc. She knows she can’t take care of a whole ass child right now, all she can (and she should) do is to chase her dreams and make a career out of it.Though you can also see that Sunshine doesn’t really hate the kid. She takes care of her the way she can– giving her money to get home, looking for her when she’s lost, protects her from adult themes (drinking, abortion, etc). So her decision at the end, it’s not because she hates the kid, it’s because she loves herself. With the limited choices she had, she made the most out of her youth And what’s so wrong with that? With being just a girl?",-1
Sunshine,"ganda ng pelikula. ganda ng tema. kuhang-kuha ang gulo ng maynila at ng masalimuot na mundo. bilang babae, mapapa-essay ka na lang talaga pagkatapos mo panoorin.ang dami ko gusto sabihin haha pero sana mas maging open ang usapan ng aborsyon sa pinas. yun lang.",3

Sunshine,"sunshine tackled various polarizing topics that are still on the table for discussion in a predominantly catholic country like the philippines. the story handled it very delicately without imposing on its audiences, without forcing them to change their opinions. it became an eye-opener instead, starting conversations and making everyone reflect on their own as well.the film rendered everyone speechless. we all clapped after sunshine ended. a must-watch film indeed. maris and jennica were phenomenal actresses. this is direk tonet's magnum opus. gets na gets ko ang pelikulang ito.fuck the patriarchy. decriminalize abortion. abortion is healthcare.sm north edsa, cinema 6",-1

Sunshine,long live ph cinema!!! the arts will continue to be one of the best forms of protest. much love to to dir. tonet <3,8
Sunshine,"women carries the weight of the world the moment they were born 'no? a woman that chooses herself has a lot of implications that makes them look selfish.this film is consistently tight, not making moments linger a second longer than it should be. it places urgency to sunshine's situation and i just love how sunshine has full autonomy and gets right to it the moment that she knew. admittedly, a certain plot device employed here might've become a burden in the long run, there's a moment where it felt like the film doesn't know what to do with it, but in the end it still landed pretty well. jadaone throws a lot of anger in this film. an exasperation to the tito bubots of this world, to the judgmental people who's supposed to make you feel safe, to the system that prohibits women to have safer options, but never to sunshine. what might this film's great achievement is that you feel it too, the film carefully takes you on a walk to make you understand and feel its anger, to understand sunshine, just how much important her dreams are and how she doesn't aspire to be a mother in this time of her life. women carries the weight of the world the moment they were born, but people like sunshine makes it feel that choosing themselves is an act to be truly selfless and for once be free",-1

Sunshine,"Para akong naglalakad sa bubog habang pinapanood ‘to, damang-dama ang esensya ng isang sining: nambubulahaw ng mga komportable. Sa madaling salita, sobrang epektibo ng pag-arte, sobrang authentic ng bawat eksena. Lumabas ako ng sinehan nang ikinakahiya ang pagiging lalaki. Hindi ko masisisi ang mga nagsasabing may kulang sa mensahe, pero para sa akin ay isang malaking hakbang na ang paglikha ng ganitong uri ng pelikula para mapag-usapan at maipaglaban pa lalo ang reproduktibong karapatan ng mga kababaihan. Idagdag mo pa ang kahusayan nina Maris Racal at Jennica Garcia, doon pa lámang ay deserve nang maipagmalaki ang pelikulang ito.",3
Sunshine,"Direk Tonet knows exactly when to let silence speak, when to drown out the noise, and when to let emotions simmer. In Sunshine, she invites us into Sunshine’s mental and bodily struggles, but leaves just enough space for the character’s autonomy and our own. While some films impose what should or shouldn’t be, Sunshine deliberately resists the impulse to moralize— and does so with intention. Instead, it evokes. It urges us to feel and think through its subtlety. Jadaone’s placement of Sunshine’s body within the harshness of Manila is a political act. To know Sunshine, then, is to know the spaces that both suffocate and shelter her.The film doesn’t offer easy answers (or any at all), but that’s precisely what makes it resonate and linger.",-1
Sunshine,LEGALIZE ABORTION NOW!!!,4
Sunshine,"“gets mo na?”“gets ko na.”matagal ko nang gets, pero mas gets ko na. it is such a privilege to witness this film on the big screen, i wouldn’t watch it in any other way. sobrang tapang, apaka tapang ng pelikulang 'to. dahil hanggang ngayon, kontrobersyal pa rin ang usaping reproductive system at abortion sa pilipinas.tangina. ang hirap maging babae. i cried, everyone in the cinema cried. this film is an open letter for everyone, to understand women on a much deeper level, their struggles.higit sa lahat, mahigpit na yakap sa lahat ng babae who had to bleed in silence. at isang palakpak para sa mga babae at sa pelikulang pilipino.narinig ko yung katabi kong matanda kanina, noong scene ni menggay. sabi niya, “dapat kasi tinuturuan ang mga babae.” sana pagkatapos niya panoorin, gets na rin niya, katulad kung paano nagets ng batang sunshine si sunshine.",-1
Sunshine,"Ten minutes in and I was already on the verge of crying. Ang heavy. The Avenida-Quiapo setting was so realistic, I felt like I was right there. The pacing felt rushed, i just wished there was enough time for us to sit with the weight of her decision, to have space to grieve sa pinagdadaanan niya. Then suddenly we’re thrown into an incest teen pregnancy subplot, and the focus shifts. Still 5 star kasi ang galing ng cinematography and acting ng lahat! Thank you for shedding light on the unseen reality teens face. If abortion is made illegal, it doesn’t stop abortions—it only stops safe ones.sana dumami pa mga pelikulang ganito ka-ganda at katapang!",-1

Sunshine,hard watch... i should have watched it alone :((,24
Sunshine,"A damning portrait of a misogynistic society and how the smallest acts of kindness become beacons of hope. Antoinette Jadaone's empathetic direction and writing is precise, harrowing, and sensitive, capturing its protagonist's defiant spirit against all odds.Maris Racal is flawless as the titular character, portraying Sunshine's turmoil - both internal and external - with stirring rawness. Jennica Garcia is likewise deeply moving as Sunshine's ally and compass, a performance rich with history and life. Shout-out to Paolo Orendain's austere cinematography, Eero Yves Francisco's oppressive production design, Benjamin Tolentino's laser-sharp editing, and Vincent Villa's absorbing sound design. This film is fully realized from top to bottom and you feel it in every moment.P.S. This better be the Philippines' official submission for Best International Feature Film at the #Oscars.",25

Sunshine,"GETS KO NA.sunshine is full of light and resilience, stands against the grim, decaying backdrop of manila drowned in chaos and darkness. as her journey unfolds, it becomes clear how personal this film is, especially for filipino women. sunshine set in a country under a deeply patriarchal system, while she embodies the struggle of being a woman. as we all know, abortion remains taboo in the philippines and can be criminalized under the revised penal code of 1930. yup, laws written nearly a century ago still control our bodies as this outdated system should be reformed, as it reflects on deeply rooted cultural norms that often affect the struggles faced by the majority of women. AND THE PERFORMANCE?? BITCH, I’M GOOPED AND GAGGED. maris racal devoured this role (kumbaga kinain at walang itinira na mumo!! GOD ATAKE NIYAH!)",12
Sunshine,"Napapanahon. Sana makapanuod nito ang mga teenagers kahit 16 and up. Mas ok rin sana kung maging open rin yung mga may pwesto. Ang hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas.

Sunshine,"The film confronts the harsh realities of teenage pregnancy, abortion, and even the challenges faced by athletes in the Philippines. With abortion being illegal here in the Philippines, many women resort to dangerous methods that put their lives at risk. The movie also highlights how men often evade accountability for such situations, leaving women to bear the heavy burden alone. It sheds light on the prevalent issue of unwanted pregnancies, a reality that is sadly common here. The film emphasizes the powerful influence of religion in shaping societal norms. Overall, it’s a bold and honest portrayal of women's struggles, particularly in a country deeply shaped by religion and patriarchal values. Kudos to Maris Racal and Antoinette Jadaone! Truly a well-deserved win. ",13
Sunshine,"Hindi lamang ito pag-uusapan dahil sa kontrobersyal nitong paksa—humihikayat din siyang mapag-usapan. Nasa isang lipunan tayo na sobrang layo pa sa usaping abortion, at ang isang pelikulang katulad ng Sunshine (2025) ay paniguradong magbibigay liwanag—hindi lang sa usaping abortion—kundi sa usapin din kung paano gamitin ng lipunan ang relihiyon at pulitika para diktahan kung ano ang dapat at hindi dapat gawin ng kababaihan sa sari-sarili nilang mga katawan. Baka maging susunod na presidente ng pilipinas o baka makahanap ng gamot sa aids, oo. Pero paano naman si Sunshine, na isinasang tabi ang karapatan, na para bang pinuputulan niyo ng pakpak makalipad. Paano naman si Sunshine, na mas mataas ang potensyal—National teams, SEA Games, kahit maging sa Olympics pa.Lumabas ako sa sinehan at naririnig ko ang kanya-kanyang diskurso ng mga nanood. Positibo at negatibo. Kesyo gino-glorify ang abortion, kesyo sumusuporta sa mga desisyon ni Sunshine. Ano man ang reaksyon at opinyon nila patungkol sa pelikulang ito, malaking hakbang pa rin yung mailagay siya sa lamesa para mapag-usapan. Hindi na dapat natin ito pinag-uusapan ng patago, na para bang malaking kasalanan. Buhay at kinabukasan ng babae ang nakasalalay.Kaunting spoiler: sobrang halaga sa akin nung eksena na dumaan muna si Sunshine sa simbahan para humingi ng tawad sa mga desisyong gagawin niya pa lamang. Pinapahalagahan ng pelikula ang usaping abortion pero hindi nito binubura ang aspetong moral ng ganoong gawain. Saka, mahalagang detalye rin sa akin yung naroon lamang siya sa labas ng simbahan at hindi siya pumasok—dahil sa tingin niya ay hindi siya karapat-dapat, dahil iba ang catholic guilt ng bagay na gagawin niya.",4

Sunshine,"I was lucky enough to be an extra for this film prior to knowing what it was about, upon seeing the trailer, I knew this was going to be special.Maris Racal truly gives one of the best performances I’ve seen in a long time. She is able to express pain (both physical and internal) in ways that make me writhe with her. I don’t think I’ve wanted to hug a woman through my screen like this in a while.And wow!!! Annika is a star in the making. She impressed me so much in this, especially in the scene where they head to the hospital. It’s definitely a scene that will stick with me for a long time. Jennica’s performance also stuck with me (as a panganay~)Manila is presented so cruel, yet so kind in those moments where Sunshine finds help. I’ve seen a couple of other films talking about abortion in the Philippines (Hinugot sa Langit and 12 Weeks specifically), but I think this one struck me the most. I found this to be extremely nuanced, the presence of the kids and their roles in Sunshine’s life really made me think. I’m still not a hundred percent sure how I feel about their presence, but I appreciate that it made Sunshine’s plight something to really think about.I also appreciated the ending, I think we often see a remorseful side post-abortion for female characters here. But I’m glad we get to see someone who gets to move on and continue to dream, to live.I also thought about the other women I’ve heard about going through similar situations. With how much the world seems to be going backwards, I really hope this piece makes people think about women’s right more here. No one should have to suffer.",-1

Sunshine,"Not gonna lie, when I first saw the trailer I wasn't sure how this would tackle the topic of teenage pregnancy and abortion, knowing how hard it is to talk about the latter outside of hushed circles without getting a stern lecturing or some weird looks. For most of the movie I was thinking about how in the world this got past MTRCB, CBCP, and literally every old-headed person out there; I'm so glad it did, btw, because it's an important story to tell, and so bravely told at that. Im not sure of the other devices used in this movie but I'm glad we have media that bravely shows a side society tries to push aside. Ang hirap maging babae!!!! We should have better legislation that supports women and children's health and welfare. Whether you choose to be a mom or not, you should be able to carry that out freely and safely. You should be able to be a girl freely. (Such a sorry state of public health honestly hay!!!!!!) Also reminds me of Happening by Annie Ernaux, one of my first brushes with this topic.",5

Sunshine,"watched this movie at a new cinema. new environment & new everything. no connection to the movie at all but i really felt the need to watch this masterpiece asap! so i got out, alone & motivated to push through everything i had set out for the day.my expectations were not disappointed as the movie delivers such a strong message towards the harsh audience which is the Filipino society. everything about the Philippines' secular practices to its contradictions that are laid by the patriarchal nature of the country—it was cruelly portrayed in the movie transparently. that's what i loved about everything that had transpired in the hour and hour-half time i sat in my seat. everything was in color too—something our country is quite known for; though maris racal had played the role of Sunshine, her character had pretty much went through the storms of what seemed to be an unplanned pregnancy that would become her hindrance in achieving her dreams. dreams. something women would always give up once motherhood would grip them by the toes. sad but true, tragic but a reality. yet this film assures women all around that carrying a child—or not, should not be something that would hinder us from reaching for the stars. every scene reminds us, the audience, how motherhood is a gift (unplanned or not), and its something we should carefully discern of before accepting such a blessing. sunshine knows this, she knows it too well to give her baby the life she does not deserve, if they was born with a mother not mature enough to handle the challenges of maternity. moreover, sunshine knew her dreams. her lifetime dream. God knows how much she desired the big stage. as said by Doc Helena, our God is a forgiving god; the statement echoes towards the ending as sunshine weighed out her choices. it was not a matter of letting something go, it was a matter of reaching for something that was always there. ika nga, talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not; and for sunshine, she grabbed the chance. gripped it hard. never letting it out of her touch. and ceased it like it was her last chance—it was. i loved this movie too much. social class, reproductive rights, healthcare, religion, mixed with the right amount of comedy all married into one thought-provoking film. mabuhay ang pelikulang pilipino!",9
Sunshine,"fuck the patriarchy fuck the government and (i would) fuck piolo pascualbut jokes aside, the movie really showed the harsh realities women have to face in this god forsaken country,, with our deeply embedded religious roots to how society is geared towards men, leaving women to fend for themselves. naramdaman ko yung lungkot pero mas lalo na ang galit mula sa pelikulang ito. direk tonet and maris completely deserve their flowers.",-1

Sunshine,"mamaya ka sakin may gagawin lang ako saglet Most likely born from Carlos Yulo's gold win in the olympics and the emergence of recent abortion films such as Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Jadaone presents how teenage pregnancies ruins lives and dreams and how the lack of freedom for women in a religion oppressed third world country is a problem as alarming as any other. Although clearly being influenced by recent films tackling similar subject matter 'Sunshine' separates itself from the pack simply because it's set in a country where abortion is illegal. With no abortion clinics and only shady abortion pills how is a teenage woman chasing her dreams let alone a 13 yr old girl raped by her own uncle supposed to reclaim the life that was supposed to be ahead of them. Portraying Manila as a neverending,never resting street filled with people desperate to find whatever they are looking for. How it is a city filled with the kindest people stuck in the most cruel of circumstances. Contradictory to its title the film never shows us a sun that is shining but rather a moon desperate to try and shine on its own despite the world telling her she can never do so alone.",5

Her artistry made me feel uncomfortable—that is how good she is! 2. Maris Racal is the perfect artist for this. More than her physique, she is 100% THE SUNSHINE. She is made to portray this role. 3. PUTANGIN—— mo Bobot, at lahat ng taong nire-represent niya. It's about time we talk about the ""FAMILY/FRIEND/ATE/KUYA/TEACHER"" rape culture that is happening in the country. 4. This is socially and politically timed. More than the abortion per se, it is about time we talk about women and everything they go through. 5. Ang sarap magkaroon ng Ate, yung mahal ka lang kahit ano pa ang mangyari (i know this for sure )6. Be kind. Not everything should be relevant to you. You do not have to comprehend or understand everything. People go through stuff you do not understand. Just be kind.",-1
Sunshine,likes:- made use of scenes very efficiently which meant i didn’t notice that the movie was pretty short because it was packed with necessary ones - made me think of its relevance towards gymnastics in the middle only to bring me back to it once i did- gave the audience enough time for the characters to grow on them without it feeling forced - stuck to it its message with conviction and without diversion unlike other films trying to include as much social commentary as they could - muntik na ako pumalakpak sa gymnastics ni maris- magaling ramdam na ramdam at amoy na amoy ko yung baho at dugyot ng maynila dislikes:- sobrang dilim medyo masakit sa mataremarks:- it was amusing to see the similarity in cinematography of the quiapo scenes of maris and the ones taken of yas in our film for ethics with the same theme ,-1

A few directors can only pull off a film about social justice, names like Lino Brocka and Lav Diaz come to my mindAlso handsdown to Maris Racal and Rhed Bustamante. MVPSunshine doesn’t just focus on Reproductive Justice, it also exposes the hypocrisy of religious people, the poor healthcare system in the philippines, how men can be trash.

SOBRANG TALINO! kitang kita sa mata niya yung guilt of even thinking of doing her plans !!! hirap siya to decide between doing what society thinks is right and doing what she thinks is right for herself. her choosing to do the latter does not mean the guilt felt lighter,,, kaya sobrang importante ng personification ni bata dito. for us to see how she’s conflicted with the decision she’s about to make!!! na kahit alam niya what she wans to do, she’s still hindered by the views and beliefs she grew up with!!!ang ganda ng last few minutes ng film. sobrang makatao. sobrang “ahh gets na gets ko siya.” i love na nalet go niya yung guilt, and she chose herself. gets ko si sunshine kasi hindi ko rin kayang ilet go yung pangarap ko, lalo na if pinanghawakan ko na siya simula nung bata ako. yung smile niya nung nilelet go na niya yung guilt felt so heartwarming! kaya sana we’re not too quick to judge other people who is (or has been) in the same situation!!",-1

Sunshine,hirap maging babae tapos nasa pinas ka pa,1
Sunshine,"It's decent to say the least, it's a Jadaone movie for Jadaone fans. But that's the thing, it's myopic that it themes and logic of the narrative presented is as only limited as the filmmaker's worldview to say the least, or rather it is limited to how Jadaone sees the subject matter in regards to abortion and having an agency which is told in such a simplistic way, lacking that empathy and how objective it is. However, I commend the script to call out against the prejudiced perception but that's how it is, it did not hold accountable to it, and while Sunshine had conviction to make her decision in the end, and matters in her own hands, it didn't feel unearned to be honest. Like who is Sunshine to the audience, as a main character? Why do the audience should root for her, I think the screenplay failed to make its audience care and thank god Maris Racal made it somehow work because she did put effort to act in those dramatic scenes and it shows she's into that role, kudos for putting an extra work on gymnastic scenes.But in some light hearted scenes, it felt like she didn't convey those emotions that at times it felt monotone. She could've shown a more human and relatable side of Sunshine.It didn't helped that the runtime could've expanded or improve some things that were lacking, but overall the film did ok. Lastly, I have a message to those who are invoking Brocka's name or likening it to the film or the filmmaker: ""keep his name out of your mouth.""",-1

Sunshine,Me: I really do not want to be pregnant as a teenagerMe: *a 26 year old*,-1
Sunshine,"I love this film. It delivers a powerful message about why the legalization of abortion is important. People get pregnant due to many reasons; not just because they wanted to have sex.If abortion is illegal, then abandoning women after impregnating them or raping them should carry serious legal consequences as well. (oo may serious consequences ang rape pero hindi naman kasi ito binibigyan pansin masyado kaya nga takot mag sumbong ang mga victims meaning HINDI SIYA ENOUGH to scare the rapists)This is a must-watch. An eye-opener for people who prioritize their beliefs over understanding the bigger picture of why women choose illegal abortion despite the risks.Hindi illegal abortion ang sagot. Tamang sex education at ang karapatan ng babae sa sarili nilang katawan ang dapat unahin.",5

I honestly get what the other’s say when they said na parang nakukulangan sila sa story but to me it is complete and a great starter conversation for why sex education is really needed for teenagers. Cause let’s be honest most of the teenagers don’t really know what to do, they just mostly learn from what they watch like pornography that will lead up to a lot of teenage pregnancy.And i also like the symbolism doon sa jeep na sinakyan ni sunshine may nakalagay na “Gift of God” while sunshine is thinking of aborting the baby inside her. wala lang its the small details the really make the shotSobrang effective talaga ng pag arte ni Maris Racal like give ko talaga kay ate and also to Jennica Garcia as ate ni Sunshine sobrang.. dalang dala nya talaga ang galing.

Niño, an image of the Child Jesus who was born from an unplanned pregnancy (albeit God-willed and wholeheartedly accepted by Mary if you’re Catholic). because much like this visual, i do believe that devotion to God and the right to choose for yourself are not mutually exclusive. if you’re using your belief to shun others instead of understanding them, then you’re not living up to your faith.i’ve said it before in past movie reviews—to me, unsafe abortions are the most horrific thing you can show your audience and i’ve seen two other films before, one more vivid than the other. but this one in sunshine is the most painful and depressing. hihilingin mo talaga na sana walang babae sa mundo ang makaranas nito. how can something regarded as the source of life drain the life out of a woman? ang pinakamahirap lunukin na katotohanan ay mayroon at mayroong mga babaeng makakaranas nito kung hindi magkakaroon ng maayos na sex education sa ating mga paaralan at hanggat walang access ang lahat sa reproductive health at safe abortions sa bansa. saludo ako sa tapang mo, direk tonet, to show something no other director of today is not afraid to do so.naniniwala akong ang kababaihan ang pinagmulan ng mundo. quite literally, babae ang nagdala at nagluwal sa ating lahat. kaya maraming salamat sa pelikulang ito dahil nabigyan ng spotlight hindi lang ang mga babaeng tulad ni sunshine at ni mary grace, pero pati na rin ang mga babaeng tulad ng ate ni sunshine, kaibigan niyang si thea, ang kanyang coach eden, si doctor helena, at pati na rin ang babaeng bantay sa avenida inn na walang pag-aatubiling tumulong sa kanya. this is womanhood, ika nga. marahil para sa’yo, ang mga babaeng ito ay iyong ina, ate, kapatid, pinsan, kaibigan o kasintahan. pero isa lang ang sigurado, may mga babae sa buhay nating nagsisilbing kakampi natin sa araw-araw at dapat lang silang bigyang-pugay at pasalamatan.(please stop reading at this point if you don’t want spoilers for the ending!)at first, i thought annika’s character is sunshine’s manifestation of her younger self or her inner child that serves as her conscience in every decision she makes. but when we’re introduced to ariana, it’s finally clear to me that they were sunshine’s manifestation of the unborn babies from her and mary grace’s unwanted pregnancies. this is why that “gets ko na” scene is so powerful! because after relentlessly asking for forgiveness from God for reasons she couldn’t fully understand, she finally forgives herself for choosing herself and her dreams. minsan ay may ni-repost si direk sa twitter and it is all about the paths our mothers did not take when they chose to love us instead. when i read that, i just cried. obviously, i am thankful my mama chose me but honestly, i would’ve understood if she didn’t.i am glad i chose to watch this spontaneously on a work night (thank you, biancake, sa biglaang aya!) kahit nakipagsapalaran ako mula makati hanggang sta. mesa, tumakbo sa extension sa pagitan ng estasyon ng doroteo jose at recto para mahabol ang simula, at naglakad sa madilim at mataong lugar sa harap ng isetann para sumakay sa jeep pa-españa. dama ko ang maynila sa hangin sa daan at nasisilayan ko ang buhay nito sa mga taong nagsisiuwian. hiling ko lang na sa bawat tahanang nalalagpasan ng aking sinasakyan, may mga babaeng naaabot ang pangarap nang hindi nahihirapan.thank you, Papa God. thank you, para sa Sunshine.",-1
Sunshine,what the fuck.,27
Sunshine,"unsa sa lahat, putang*na ng mga lalaki talaga! kung ayaw niyo naman palang panagutan yung babae, mag condom kayo o di kaya putulin niyo na lang itet niyo. pero on a serious note, this film is truly a masterpiece, capturing the horrors of unsafe abortion in the philippines. maris’ role reflects the struggles of women’s access to genuine healthcare! kaya sana ipasa na ang abortion bill! it’s a woman’s body and all the things they do about it, abay labas na tayo don (lalo na kapag lalaki ka). finally, ang pogi ni papa p ha. thanks sa special appearance or something blabla!",-1
Sunshine,"gets ko na, gets na gets ko. I LOVE YOU SUNSHINE. ABANTE BABAE. I LOVE WOMEN.",2
Sunshine,"puno ng pangarap, puno ng paghihirap",1
Sunshine,napakahirap maging babae lalo na't kung ikaw ay nakatira sa pinas. i've been waiting for this film to be launched since last year and it did not disappoint. pinakita ng pelikulang ito kung gaano kahirap ang pinagdadaanan ng mga kababaihan sa mata ng mapanghusgang lipunan. tears were shed nung scene na ni sunshine at ate geleen. napakasarap siguro sa pakiramdam na kahit anong mangyari ay may kakampi ka sa buhay. na hindi ka huhusgahan at buong pusong tatanggapin kung ano…,6
Sunshine,gets,-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is more than a story of a promising teenager, it is an illustration of how women traverse a situation of compromise in which each option is seen as greed and demise. Nonetheless, it was always Sunshine’s choice to choose Sunshine.",-1
Sunshine,"i cried silently in my seat a few times. i mean how can you not when you remember you’re a filipino woman living in this hell hole? always failed by men, by society, by the government and even by your own religion.i had been anticipating this film’s release for so long as i’m hoping it will somehow finally get people talking about something as controversial as abortion. so stigmatized and taboo, i literally even took a while to decide whether or not i should write that word down.i’m relieved that this film went where i hoped it would go. i might write a longer review soon but for now i’m just going to say antoinette jadaone was so brave for this.",13
Sunshine,ramdam ko ang mga binibitbit na emosyon ni sunshine sa bawat unat ng kaniyang katawan at sa pag kumpas ng kaniyang laso mula sa umpisa hanggang sa dulo ng pelikula. madaming sinira o binasag ang pelikula na ito sa kung anong sistema na mayroon ngayon sa bansa.medyo nakaka ano lang parang may scene na di dapat tawanan pero tinatawanan nung nasa likod namin likee ,3
Sunshine,gets ko na. ang galing.,1
Sunshine,"gets ko na.tangina napakaganda, napakahusay, nakakaiyak, nakakagigil, nakakainis kasi sobrang totoo ng lahat ng nangyayari. thank you so much direk tonet and team for this film, holy fuck, easily the best filipino film of the year! please, panoorin sana ng lahat sa sinehan hanggat may chance pa, it's such a wonderful experience. all aspects of this film are soooo good!! what a film. i don't have enough words to properly review this because it did left me speechless. this is so painfully real to many women—young and not. i got out of that cinema still in dazed because it's that beautifully raw and brave. i can't help but to think of my mom and her internal struggle with herself getting pregnant as a young woman when at that time, she was also dreaming the life she wanted just as much Sunshine did in this film. we all dreamed and are still dreaming. this film gives me so much hope in everything good, despite the unfortunate events. what a film indeed.",9
Sunshine,"I can already imagine the discourse once marelease to sa VOD. First of all, I think it is so bold of Jadaone to come up with a concept that is so simplistic yet so real and full of grit despite the subject’s thematic weight. Abortion remains to be a debatable matter in the Philippines and opinions are always highly polarized among liberals and conservatives. Despite the country’s right-wing political ideologies, there are still calls from progressive groups urging the government to legislate better constitutions on health and reproductive rights for the benefit of those who need it most. Sunshine happens to be one of these people.Sunshine is a dedicated gymnast and an aspiring Olympian. With only a few weeks left to polish and brush up on her routine, she suddenly found herself in a bind that put her faith, morals, and self-worth to the test. The film doesn’t let us stay in a hopeful frame of mind; rather, it propels us to empathize with the character and question whatever is wrong and fucked up with the system. When Sunshine found out she was pregnant, her first instinct was to get rid of it. Pray it away. End it even if it means drowning in a cycle of self-destructive behaviors. It was clear from the very start she didn’t want to push through and she held onto that. I guess that’s as far as I can go for now so as to not give away too much of the plot.I watched this alone sa sinehan kanina and as soon as the credits rolled, i overheard someone sa likod ko saying na ‘bitin’ daw, and i totally get the sentiment that maybe for some people medyo half-baked or kulang ang storya. But sometimes, films don’t have to be loud in order to hit the right spots. With its very straightforward premise and message, I think Sunshine deserves the amount of hype it’s getting.The sports industry is already overwhelmingly taxing and having to face added burdens brought about by unwanted pregnancy can be way more damaging than one can fathom. Sunshine is not a film that will convince you to change your moral and political convictions; rather, it clings to the little hope of making the audience understand that the dilemma Sunshine had to face isn’t something that exists only in the reel world, but something that is very much present in the real world—in a society where bodily autonomy often comes at a social cost.Above all else, one thing’s clear is we really need better and safer reproductive laws in the Philippines so women wouldn’t have to go through under-the-table practices that put their lives on the brink of death. However, with the current political climate, i guess it’s realistic to assume we’re still a little far off. But with films like Sunshine, I’d like to think there’s still an ounce of hope for our country to perhaps embrace ideals that give primacy to women’s autonomy and rights, at the very least.",11
Sunshine,"“Gets ko na.”I think Sunshine is Direk Tonet’s best work yet. It is simplistic, raw, and bothering but it is wrapped in a cute pink ribbons that seeks to hide the harsh truths women in our society face. The bits of humor at times give audiences a space to laugh and forget how heavy the message of the film is and then it just hits you with its narrative and the core message behind it. My favorite scene was the conversation between Ariana and Bata, it was both pro life and pro choice which may be a hard thing to pull off but the team did it effortlessly. I loved how raw and unfiltered it is and how it became a eureka moment for the other audiences. I am in no way fit to write a long ass review about the them of the film because stories like these are rooted in everyday struggles of women in such violent and patriarchal society. I loved the film but I would love more hearing how women react and talk about this film, sila ang tanging nararapat na magexpound lalo nito at naka supporta lang ako.",-1
Sunshine,This movie surprised on how well-made it is from start to finish. I rarely watch local movies (I know I should be more active) but this very much convinced me it’s a 5/5 movie.Everyone from this movie pulled their weight jnto making this masterpiece! From story to acting to cinematography to the grueling face of Manila. This is a movie that’s worthy of millions.,-1
Sunshine,"subverts all kinds of toxicity of Filipinos. i love how direk antoinette promotes safe sex and shows the consequences of irresponsible sex but at the same time challenges the norm of ideologies and beliefs of the Philippines’ stance on pro-choice and pro-life.i think i believe when people say that, this is the best antoinette jadaone film. sorry fangirl ",13
Sunshine,"Habang nasa kalagitnaan ng pelikula, nasabi ko na lamang sa sarili ko, “Para saan ba talaga ‘tong pelikula na ‘to? Ano bang point nito?” Yun pala, ako lang ang hindi agad naka-gets.Ang fucked up lang kasi isipin kung yung bata ay literal na physical manifestation ng nasa tiyan ni Sunshine, parang anim na taong gulang na anyo ng dapat sana’y magiging anak. Mas fucked up pa kasi kinokonsensya niya si Sunshine (tinawag siyang murderer). Pero later on na-realize ko: hindi siya totoong bata, kundi visual representation lang ng internal conflict ni Sunshine. Siya yung konsensya. Siya yung maliit na boses sa loob. Siya rin si Sunshine.Kaya hindi talaga tungkol sa journey ni Sunshine sa pag-abot ng mga pangarap niya ang pelikula. Mas tungkol ito sa batang karakter—na hindi rin pala talaga bata—at sa mas malawak na karanasang pangkababaihan. Kasi sa totoo lang, ang kwento ng abortion ay hindi tungkol sa bata. Ito ay tungkol kay Sunshine. Sa mga babae. Sa mga may katawan. Sa mga may kakayahang magdesisyon para sa sarili nila.Maganda naman ang ending. Medyo parang Modess commercial nga lang (charot). Pero kung tatanungin ako, feeling ko may kulang. Bilang manonood, hindi ko gaanong naramdaman ang bigat ng emosyon. Kulang sa lalim. Kulang sa hugot. Pero nabawi naman sa pagganap ng mga aktor—walang tapon, mahusay ang lahat.Isang halimbawa ng kakulangan sa emotional connection para sa akin ay yung eksenang umiiyak si Sunshine sa loob ng inn habang isinasagawa ang abortion. Malapit na akong bumigay nun, ramdam na ramdam ko na, pero biglang nag-cut to a shot from outside the window of her emoting and yung maingay na traffic. Aesthetic, oo. Maganda, pero di ko gusto. Parang sinampal ako pabalik sa reyalidad na, “Hoy, hindi ka kasama sa kwento.” Saksi ka lang. I don’t know about you guys, but I don’t like that.Favorite scene ko siguro ay yung early scene sa pelikula, yung umiiyak si Sunshine sa jeep. Maingay sa simula, tapos unti-unting tumahimik habang nakatutok lang ang lente sa kanya. Ang galing nun. Ang ganda. In addition, siksik sa intensyon ang mga detalye—katulad ng painting sa unahan ng jeep na may nakasulat na “Gift from God.” Hala siya, eh di ikaw na ang tumanggap. (charot)Anyways, ang dami kong nasabi. Pero ngayon na lang naman ‘to. Ang galing ni Maris. At isang malaking middle finger sa mga mahilig makialam sa buhay ng iba—lalo na’t hindi naman hinihingi ang opinyon nila. Wala rin namang ambag. Oo, may ambagan!+0.5 star kasi super ganda ng official poster!!",3

Sunshine,"Beyond how brilliant Sunshine is, this film reminded me once again why cinema matters in shaping and inspiring a better society. It has the power to connect, to spark meaningful conversations, and to heal.The film doesn't ask you to take a side or change your stance, instead it offers perspective. It doesn't scream any agenda on you, instead it quietly holds your hand and asks you to listen. This film made me realize just how unfair this world can be to women. It is hard enough to be a woman, even more so to be a woman in the Philippines. As a man, it opened my eyes around struggles I'm privileged not to face, but must learn to understand.Sunshine champions women with deep care and honesty, and Tonet Jadaone continues to be one of the most important voices in Philippine cinema today. I can't wait to see what she creates next.Maris Racal portrayed Sunshine with such precision and depth. Her fears and pain simmer just beneath the surface, yet she keeps moving-focused, trying to hold herself together-trying to drown out the noise as she fights to choose what's best for her.Top 3 scenes that stirred the audience at our local theater:1. The preachy doctor scene 2. Rhed Bustamante’s pregnancy reveal 3. The “Ate” scene between Jennica and Maris",20
Sunshine,I love it when directors and writers put certain meanings into their works!!!,8
Sunshine,"gets ko na.isang mahigpit na yakap sa lahat ng sunshine! hindi lang ito basta pelikula—ito'y pag-amin na ang sistema ay hindi para sa mga kababaihan. matapang pero may puso. sensitibo ngunit madaling unawain. at sana, mapanood pa ito nang mas nakararami.we need more films like this! mabuhay ang pelikulang pilipino!",6
Sunshine,"A perspective from a young woman's struggle towards her dreams in Urban Manila. Handle delicate and sensitive timely issues-abortion and #ProChoice. The juxtaposition of society and women's struggle. How each scenes will straight out of reality. Your social support will vary and how public space are intermingle of ideas. Each realities matter yet beliefs they hurt-from a Conservative Christian Obgyne female doctor who cannot fathom how a young woman would not want to give birth, to a female Quiapo vendor selling abortifacients in front of a Church, to a dear sister who raised her both siblings who will love her no matter what (Jennica's performance here is so superb, I almost cry), to a 13 year old girl who been raped because by a family member, and finally Maris Racal's Sunshine who undergo making a decision, a choice--that is so hard and required ethics, but understandably absorbed into her role, how every woman in the Philippines simply existing is so exhausting. But also how the patriarchy compels women as their biggest supporter draping the country's public health that hurt and judge women for their choice, to the point of penalizing them as criminals.Sunshine is realism, carefully managed and lay out how women needs always to advocate for their own choice and bodily autonomy.",11
Sunshine,Maris Racal I never doubted you my cancelled sister! YOU ATE THIS AWP!,10
Sunshine,being a woman is a DAILY struggle!!,7
Sunshine,"after months of waiting, i was finally able to watch sunshine! and the waiting game was worth it :)sunshine delivers a strong message while keeping things concise. with its 92-minute runtime, the film strongly conveyed a clangorous noise which could spark discussions regarding women's reproductive health as well as the overall state of healthcare in the country. the jokes are so subtle it made the whole cinema burst out laughing except the two boomers in our row. sobrang nabadtrip sila dun sa joke ni jennica garcia sa ospital hahahaha. the film connected so well with its audience, and with this i meant CONNECT! ramdam na ramdam ko yung pain ni sunshine sa isang eksena na 'yon, grabe. at bawat eksena ay tear-inducing dahil grabe 'yung pamumuo ng luha sa mata ko sa halos kalahati ng dulong part ng film. the hospital scenes were so painful to watch in a way that it reflects reality so much. nakalulungkot isipin na ganito ang estado ng public hospitals sa bansa, hindi matamasa kung ano ba ang dapat mayroon tayo. more than that, this film also shows how women do not have a safer option to terminate pregnancy when they choose to do so. kailangan bang mag agaw-buhay ang isang babae para lang maalis sa kanya ang 'buhay' na hindi naman niya hiniling?sobrang kirot sa puso panoorin tangina. pero napakaganda rin talaga jusko. but yeahhh! beautiful shots by pau orendain andddd jadaone has outdone herself here after fan girl (2020)! halimaw! gusto ko magtrabaho sa project8 projects pagka-graduate ko.

Sunshine,"This kind of film is what the whole Philippines has to watch. It is an eye-opener that sparks significant discussion in terms of how Filipinos perceive situations in a traditional and conservative way.I definitely loved how it tackled this controversy while focusing on Sunshine’s dream, which represents many teenage girls that suffered from unwanted pregnancies. In this hour-and-a-half film, it did highlight the majority belief yet also countered it in different narratives. Despite being so interested in pre-watching the film, I still didn’t expect how the film has featured many symbols and situations that Filipinos have to realize. I get so emotional about how the storyline has approached this issue, and I hope to see more of this in our country.Maris Racal is the right actress for the role. The way she played Sunshine was so natural and raw. Her delivery of lines, the body language, the expressions—everything was on point. She made Sunshine as the character that many can easily relate to. The casting was amazing, as were the cinematography, color grading, music scoring, and the flow.Definitely Direk Antoinette Jadaone’s best.",-1
Sunshine,"when imagining her unborn daughter wasn't enough, sunshine began to imagine another teenager's unborn child. justice for mary grace... she didn't get any...",-1
Sunshine,"sobrang aktres mo, Maris, at napakahusay mo, direkTonet!hindi lang basta pelikulang pinangunahan ng mga babae ito; ang tapang. ang tapang ng pelikulang humugot sa mga paksa na matagal nang itinuturing na bawal pag-usapan. lahat ng matagal nang tinitiis at pinapasan ng kababaihan, inilatag sa liwanag para mapag-usapan, maintindihan, at matanggap.grabe.mula sa pagtutok ng lente sa malayo, hanggang sa marahang paglapit ng kamera sa mga mata ni Maris Racal— ramdam mo lahat. hindi pilit, hindi sobra pero tama. parang gusto mo siyang yakapin, buhatin ang bigat nya sabihing hindi siya nag-iisa.lahat ng karakter may kinakatawan. may girls' girl, may tradisyonal, lalong mas may hipokrito. lahat sila, totoo. kilala natin sila sa totoong buhay, pero minsan ay (baka) tayo sila.pinakapaborito kong eksena siguro yong parte na nalaman na ng ate ni Sunshine ang kalagayan niya. walang sigawan, walang sumbat, kundi yakap, pag-unawa, at respeto sa desisyong mahirap man ay personal dahil galing na rin siya mismo doon. proof ito na hindi nagkulang si Jennica Garcia sa pagbibigay-lalim sa karakter niya— tahimik man ang portrayal, pero talagang mabigat ang tama.gets na gets kita, Sunshine :)",3
Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone unleashes a kind of ferocity in this film that's very much needed from a mainstream voice in our sociopolitical age. The choices made throughout the narrative leave a powerful message that stay with you long after you walk out of the theater. It demands your attention, and it demands that you listen. Sunshine feels like a film that will define a new age in Philippine cinema, not for its technical marvel, but for ushering in a bravery in writing that may just be what's missing from our industry's identity. I might even reckon it to the likes of the Brockas, Bernals, de Leons, or the Diaz-Abayas of the world.Please, catch it in cinemas if you can.",-1

Sunshine,"i am angry at the church for instilling deep-seated catholic guilt that permeates thru all levels of our society, at the government for blatantly anti-women policies that lead to unsafe abortions, at medical professionals that push shame on patients, and unfortunately at my parents for not teaching me about contraceptives when i was younger. the film rly captures the loneliness and desperation of googling options for sexual health, not knowing who to turn to, calculating probabilities for pregnancy, mitigating risk of judgment and humiliation. hay naq even the experience of getting an iud made me feel some type of way about my womb. when will women be able to feel like their bodies belong to them w/o guilt or shame???",28
Sunshine,"this one hit hard. no dramatic twists, just simple on the surfaceprops to jadaone for threading so many social issues fit into one story. poverty, reproductive rights, and our shitty healthcare system.i’d say that this movie is an eyeopener to the urgent need to legalize abortion in our country. sunshine deserved a much more viable choice, and so do the girls out there!",5
Sunshine,"Nung unang mga minuto parang ang bilis naman ng mga nangyayari parang lahat na to napanuod ko na sa mga trailers. Iniisip ko sooo I think alam ko na ata yung mangyayari. Mali ako. Naguguluhan din ako sa character nung bata, pero aahh yun pala sya. Damn tumindi galit ko sa mga lalaki. Pagkanakakakita ako ng lalaki sa frame tas magsasalita, matik AAAAA nakakairita. (Sorry Papa P, kasama ka dyan. Pero ang pogi mo. Ang pogi rin ni Elijah helowww) Pero baliktad naman nito pag mga babae yung nagsasalita at may ganap huhhuhuhu I LOVE WOMEN (except sa nanay ni Mary Grace at sa unang doktora!!!)AAAAAA ang ganda ng movie na to.

Sunshine,"I have faith in this film's capacity for becoming a beloved classic in Filipino cinema given enough time. An unmelodramatic (if you found it melodramatic, I personally feel that may say more about you than the film!) and unflinching portrayal of the Hell that the Philippines is for girls and women. Somehow, even in all its white-hot rage, Sunshine approaches its controversial topic most of all with kindness, empathy, and understanding. I am overcome by an urge to watch every other previous Antoinette Jadaone film ASAP.Maris Racal, with this single performance, cements herself as our most talented actor from her generation. She's seriously in her FAMAS, Cannes Best Actress, Volpi Cup bag here!",12

Sunshine,HANDS DOWN TALAGA MARIS RACAL,0
Sunshine,"if only i was able to document how i looked when i realized what kind of roles annika and ariyuhna were trying to portray. i was.. blown away. conflicted. i felt sorry, but i genuinely understand. i also just want to commend ms jennica garcia’s performance!!!!!!! as an Ate myself, i feel like despite the <intense> reactions that people around me think i’ll be like if in any case i end up being in that same position, i think i would react like sunshine’s Ate. it’s already a cruel reality, people like sunshine just needs a pair of understanding ears, a heart, and a warm embrace. i feel like i really broke down when jennica repeatedly said ‘i love you.’ with the most sincere and most genuine tone. i really really loved how sunshine’s performance for the competition ended with a face shot or whatever you call it. i like how it ended without seeing how the competition she worked and sacrificed so much went. for me, her actual performance was the one with annika watching it. that “gets ko na” carried so much SO MUCH emotions in it that you really just have to agree na oo, gets mo rin.it has been a magical experience to be able to watch this film on the big screen. i can’t believe i only paid 230 pesos to feel THAT much. thank you, sunshine. i offer you so much love and respect.",-1
Sunshine,"so much has been said about the bravery to tackle an important but still quite taboo issue in the country but it just cannot be overstated!!! i left the cinema today with a lot of heavy thoughts and feelings that i cant perfectly explain but i think a lot of that is rooted in sadness and anger.sadness over the realization that as a woman i see myself in more ways than one in sunshine. i may not have gone through a similarly tumultuous experience but there are bits and pieces of her character that i see myself in. at times it felt jarring to recognize those. as a healthcare worker myself, i can say that a lot of the scenes in this movie arent far from reality. they’re sometimes even worse. and it’s just. idk. this film heightened the anger i have… directed at.. i dont know. the society? the government? myself?my emotions about this are still all over the place really.what i do know is that this film will stick with me for years.",36
Sunshine,"i love how this film showed na nasa babae lagi ang bigat when it comes to unplanned pregnancies—walang proper support; lahat ay tutol sa desisyon na gustuhin magka abortion ang babae, walang proper sex education para maiwasan ito at higit sa lahat, walang proper healthcare for it",-1

Sunshine,SAY IT WITH ME ABORTION SHOULD BE LEGALIZED,4
Sunshine,"""don't say bad words""but damn, just damn ",-1
Sunshine,Sending compliments to the sound designer for allowing silence to bear meaning and for the din of the world to swell at the right moment.,-1
Sunshine,"After this movie, i had to confirm to my brother that he would stay by my side if ever i ever get an abortion. Almost forgot i was a lesbian",5
Sunshine,I was a wreck,15
Sunshine,"This movie is brave in tackling a very delicate issue, but at times, it tries too hard to deliver its message. It needed more grit and heart, and less aesthetics and preachiness. The bit with the pregnant teenage girl felt like a random device, which is unfortunate given the weight it carried on the film's plot.Still, I like how it tried to take on subjects like incest, poor maternal health, Catholic guilt. It works well when it shows its heart -- the tender moments between sisters, the heartbreaking text message to a friend before a risky decision. Maris Racal is good, and the supporting cast also deserves a lot of praise (the Quiapo vendor was great).",5
Sunshine,make abortion safe and available to all filipino women !!!,11
Sunshine,"criminalizing abortion does not stop abortions, it just makes abortion less safe.gets ko na, sunshine. gets na gets.",4
Sunshine,very raw. very true. very real.,1
Sunshine,Marahas ang mundo. Pero mas brutal ang Pilipinas. At ang pagiging isang maralitang babae sa kamaynilaan ay isang parusa.Also pucha ang galing ni Maris...,0
Sunshine,direk tonet’s best yet!!!,1
Sunshine,"Ang bigat wow.Paborito kong parte dito si annika. Sabi ng iba konsensya nya si annika, o way to cope, o di kaya ung unborn child nya.Buong buo ung loob ni sunshine na ayaw nya pa maging nanay, hindi nya pa kaya, tuwing hihingi ng pera sakanya si annika, “Umalis ka nga wala akong pera”. Pero nagaalala pa rin sya, pero binigyan nya ng pang tricyle, 100 para special, para ligtas si annika. Pero hindi sumagi sa isip nya buhayin nalang ung bata. ayaw pa ni sunshine, buhay nya yung gymnastics. Ang gandang representation nito sa bawat babaeng pinili ang abortion. Kahit gaano ka-desidido, kahit piliin mo yung sarili mo, hindj mawawala ung guilt, ung takot, ung sakit. Kasi tao lang si sunshine, napapaligiran ng mapanghusga, ng mga taong tinuturing na krimen ang abortion. Ang gandang representation na bukod sa physical pain na pagdadaanan ng babae sakin unsafe abortion choices, meron pa syang internal battle sa guilt at konsensya nya.. Nung nawala si Annika, takot na takot si sunshine, nakakapagtaka kasi e ayaw nya naman talaga si Annika in the first place. Pero parte parin sya ni annika. Something in me healed sa last part nung sinabi nya na “Gets ko na”. Ang perfect ng scene na to. I interpret is as making peace, and forgiving herself, na she chooses this and this is what she knows is best.",3
Sunshine,The silence in Sunshine is so loud. Deafening even. A masterful play on choices.,-1
Sunshine,"This movie does an excellent job of shedding light on the social issues that our country continues to face and urgently needs to address, especially in a society where ignorance still prevails. The story also bravely tackles the sensitive issue of abortion—something our country is still not ready to openly discuss.To Maris Racal, you truly did an outstanding job with this project. Hats off to you for delivering such an amazing performance! Despite the challenges you may face, you have proven that you’re an incredible actress.To Direk Tonet Jadaone, you did a phenomenal job exploring these pressing issues—abortion, public health, teenage pregnancy, Catholic guilt, patriarchy, and even sports. You’ve once again proven why you are truly “THE Tonet Jadaone.”PLS PUTA PAKI-LEGALIZED NA ANG ABORTION AT DIVORCE MGA PUTANGINA!!OO MAKA-DIYOS KA NGA PERO HINDI MO NAMAN ISINABUBUHAY ANG TOTOONG IBIG SABIHIN NG PAGIGING MAKA-DIYOS, WAG MAGING HIPOKRITOTSAKA KAHIT PAPAANO NAISINGIT ANG NANGYAYARE SA GOBYERNO THANK YOU.

Sunshine,GUUUUUYS ANG GALING!!!!!!! MARENG MARIS I SEE YOU GIRL!!!!,0
Sunshine,1st watch,24
Sunshine,"i have so many thoughts and feelings for this film. but it’s just a great film, hands down. throughout, we see sunshine behind and through bars and whenever we see her beyond it, her choices feel cathartic (like dasurv masiraan ng kotse! dasurv mabasagan ng beer sa ulo!) i found the hospital scenes to be the hard-hitting ones since there are so much to unpack. like either way, you’re trapped—trapped alongside the many other women who are forced to share hospital beds in public health centers/clinics/hospitals or either, you end up fighting for your life when the abortifacients don’t work. given the structures around us, the choices we are given do not serve us nor empower us, which then make these other options more enticing. despite this dreary reality, i found myself being emotional during the final sequence. sunshine finds herself free in gymnastics and that’s what she gets to do and she gets to drown out the noise. and that’s all what we’re advocating for, for women to have the choice. GOD i love this film sm. i do think it’s a good first step in addressing abortion in contemporary PH cinema. we are doing this film a disservice if we expect it to fully encompass the extent of nuances of this experience. what we can hope for, perhaps, is the exploration of more nuanced stories like sunshine’s to be seen and heard.",-1
Sunshine,the movie was very raw and what saddens me the most is this is someone’s experience and it’s not impossible because in society lalo na sa ph na very religious centered instilled w/ such shame and discrimination among other ppl — women & abortion should not sit on the same table that’s why it’s very stigmatized kaya ive always been a pro-choice and never did and never will shame women who went through that — i embrace them with so compassion and empathy ,5
Sunshine,"ang hirap lang talaga maging babae... kasi hindi ka babae lang - kapatid, kaibigan, anak, at bata ka rin. dami-daming inaasahan satin at papel na ginagampanan pero sa patriyarkal na lipunan natin nagiging balewala lahat nang yan dahil ang halaga ng buhay at karapantang pantao natin e binabase nila sa pagiging tagapagluwal natin. TANGA INYO NA YAN!also binook ko lang to bigla sa sm north imagine my surefries nung biglang may nagpakitang tao habang rumoroll credits at lumabas si direk antoinette jadaone?!",3
Sunshine,ganda pa rin on second watch,24
Sunshine,such a great film,8
Sunshine,gets ko na,14
Sunshine,"The movie that will haunt you after watching. Sunshine isn’t loud, but it leaves a lasting echo. Her silence feel heavier than words. As she searches the streets of Manila for a way out, we feel every step, the desperation, the shame, the unbearable weight of decisions no one should face alone.What haunts you isn’t what’s said, but what isn’t. The film never preaches, but it unsettles. You don’t just watch it, you carry it with you. Sunshine doesn’t end with answers. It ends with a breath held in your chest.",-1
Sunshine,"gets ko na. sunshine sheds light on the complexities yet unity within the different relationships that girls have with other women. sobrang daming expectations na hinihingi sa atin at iba rin ang pagod dahil dito. maris perfectly embodies the character of sunshine, who stayed true to her dreams until the end, despite the multiple challenges she faced to get there. this film was very, very raw and the execution perfectly delivered the message it wanted to reach the audience. it will forever be in my heart!!! i love you sunshine <3",-1
Sunshine,"the irony of the super christian ob-gyne treating sunshine like a child (say thank you papa jesus) while also expecting her to carry a child full term.there are lots of ironies in this movie, especially in how sunshine—a girl, barely a woman herself—is treated. “what if the child you’re carrying is the next president of the philippines?” but what about sunshine’s dreams? must those dreams end when motherhood begins? whose dreams and potential are more important? sunshine the movie doesn’t answer these questions outright, leaving you to chew on them instead and come to your own conclusions. at the start, i found the narrative device of the child as a manifestation of sunshine’s guilt a little too on-the-nose, but the pay-off in the ending made it worth it. as the ending says: gets ko nabut the best parts of sunshine are when it dwells on the almost fantastical ridiculousness of manila—not just the place, but also the people. details like the abortifacient vendor using the money sunshine gave her to “bless” her holy figurines or the santo niños looming over their whole transaction or dangerous illegal abortions followed by scenes of overflowing maternity wards. the movie passes no judgement on these scenes but merely offers them up for observation: here is manila in all it’s messy glory. it’s the perfect backdrop for sunshine’s series of bad choices. (and also reminiscent of lino brocka’s film style which i absolutely ate up)",-1
Sunshine,"ABSOLUTE CINEMAwhat i love abt this movie is its soooo honest. it tackles abortion, a topic thats still seen as taboo in a conservative country. this movie DOESNT glorify abortion. what it does is offer a different perspective into the lives of women who go through this experience.i love how determined and full sunshine is. full of dreams, full of courage. she is the kind of woman who chooses her own path and fights for it, kahit gaano kahirap. her story is not just about abortion, its about freedom, choice, and dignity.women should have the right to decide for their own bodies. after all, kami ang makakaranas ng lahat, physically, emotionally, mentally. mo one else should dictate what we can or cannot do with our own life.i love how the film doesnt try to force an opinion on the viewers. instead, it invites you to listen and understand. it shows us why some women make this choice, not because they want to, but because sometimes, they have to. kudos!!!! sobrang ganda",5
Sunshine,"10/10 tangina napakaganda! napakahusay mo maris racal! as usual, direk tonet did not disappoint! putangina nyong mga sexual abusers at anti abortion! let women decide on their own bodies. no vagina, no comment!!!",4
Sunshine,"Siguro nasabi na ang halos lahat ng magagandang aspeto ng pelikulang Sunshine, pero may isang bagay talaga ang tumatak sa akin: ang ilaw.Hindi ko alam kung sinadya man ito, pero napansin ko kung paanong ginagamit ang ilaw upang i-spot si Sunshine. Sa bawat eksenang naggi-gymnastics siya, ramdam mo ang goals at motivation ng karakter niya. Tunay nga na siya si Sunshine, siya ang liwanag. Ang bawat eksena sa loob ng training court ay nagmistulang higaan ng dilaw na liwanag, puno ng pangarap, dedikasyon, at pag-asa.Pero sa tuwing lalabas siya ng gym, sa tuwing aalis siya sa mundo ng gymnastics, unti-unting dumidilim ang paligid. Ang bahay nila, na nasa gitna ng nakakasulasok na usok ng Maynila. Ang pampublikong ospital na kalunos-lunos ang itsura. Ang mga kalsada ay madilim, makulimlim, nakakalunod ang ilaw. Habang bumabalot ang dilim, makikita sa mukha ni Sunshine, lalo na sa kanyang mga mata, ang pagnanais niyang kumawala. Parang sinasabi ng mga mata niya, ayaw ko ng ganito. Ayaw niya ng dilim. Ayaw niyang masakal ng mundong nasa labas ng kanyang pangarap.Siguro ang pelikulang ito ay hindi lang tungkol sa abortion. Isa rin itong kwento ng mga batang babaeng may pangarap. Kung paanong nililimitahan ng lipunan ang kakayahan nilang abutin ang mga pangarap nila. Kung paanong pinangungunahan at dinidiktahan ang mga desisyon nila kung ano ang “tama” o “mali” habang sabay na pinipigilan silang lumipad nang malaya.Ang dami ko nang nasabi, pero grabe, wala talaga akong masabi sa galing mo, Maris. Ang husay mo, sobra. At ikaw naman, Direk Tonet, ang tindi mo. Dati, pinapakinggan ko lang yung opinyion mo tungkol sa abortion sa AWKP, tapos ngayon, pelikula na siya. Kwento na siya. At hindi lang basta kwento, kwentong siguradong magpapasimula ng usapan, diskurso, at ingay.",3
Sunshine,gets ko na. gets ko na.,38
Sunshine,"gets ko na.just watched sunshine and all I can say is this is one of the most beautiful and one of the best filipino film I’ve ever seen. I didn’t feel like I was watching maris racal I felt like I was watchingsSunshine herself.  sobrang husay mo, maris. you didn’t just play sunshine, you became her. you didn’t just portray her, you gave her life. you owned that role!!to direk tonet AAAAA thank you for giving us this amazing film. you absolutely made the right choice in casting Maris. The overall casting was just perfect. annica Co grabe, even as a new and young artist, she delivered such a powerful performance. ms jennica  that one scene nung magkatabi sila ni sunshine sobrang sakit in the most beautiful way.  kudos din to xyrille manabat character, we deserve a bestfriend like her  and galing din ni elijah kuhang-kuha mo inis ko kayong dalawa nung doctorthis is not just a film, this is a wake up call. It shows us something real, something painful, and something that many woman go through but too afraid to talk about. there’s sunshine everywhere, not only gymnast or to other sports. sunshine is a woman who has a dream but is facing struggles before achieving it. sunshine doesn’t just tell a story, it opens your eyes. it makes you feel :)",-1
Sunshine,"Really happy that I was able to watch this in the cinema. Very strong performances all-around; I was surprised that aside from one performance (sorry Piolo Pascual, him appearing out of nowhere just kind of took me out of the movie; maybe on a rewatch it won't bother me as much), every one else did a fantastic job. Aside from Maris Racal, Jennica Garcia who plays her sister was a stand-out for me. The tightrope balance of comedy and drama…",-1
Sunshine,UTTERLY MOVING.,1
Sunshine,Simpleng storytelling lang. Hindi kinailangan maging high art para bumenta which is what exactly the audience needs.,-1
Sunshine,watched this with a bunch of friends last week. So many moments I’ve wanted to cry cuz it felt so real. It’s like seeing how fucked up religion can influence actual laws. Doctors that are too religious to not have actual empathy. The genuine hypocrisy from our society. It’s all too real. I hope this film changes the narrative of our country. I’ll definitely watch this again and cry alone.,5
Sunshine,"Sarap yakapin ni Sunshine nung nasa Avenida Inn sya.Interesting din that they got ""Sunshine"" from the name of the doctor that helped them develop the story.Husay ni direk tonet!!",2
Sunshine,"had this been a light hearted movie, my review wouldve probably just left it at ""its aria-NUH, slay slay slay slay"" but i dont really think that this movie deserves that. i saw the trailer sometime last year. from that, i knew that there was something special about it after just hearing ""drown out the noise, you're sunshine, olympian"" and knowing the under-covered struggle, mental battles that Sunshine goes through in this film. it felt heavy, but familiar. i…",-1
Sunshine,Antapang ng movie na ito. Likha ng kababaihan para sa kapwa kababaihan. ,35
Sunshine,"Sa dami ng opinyon ng mga tao lalo na kapag tungkol sa katawan ng babae, iba ang ginawa ng Sunshine. Hindi ito dumaan sa maingay na diskusyon o pakikipagtalo. Tahimik lang siya, dala dala ang katotohanang hindi kayang ipaliwanag ng statistics, relihiyon o moralidad. Hindi siya ginawa para kumbinsihin ka o pasayahin ka. Ginawa siya para ipakita kung ano talaga ang nangyayari, at maramdaman mo kung gaano ito kabigat.Kwento sya ng libo-libong babae na tahimik lang, pero araw-araw may dalang mabigat na desisyon. Yung tipong kahit gusto mong may makausap, mas nauuna pa rin yung kaba kasi madalas, ang sumasalubong hindi pag-unawa kundi panghuhusga.Ang Sunshine ay paalala na hindi lahat ng sakit ay may eksenang iyakan.. minsan, nasa katahimikan ng paglalakad pauwi, sa paghawak sa tiyan, sa pag-iwas ng tingin, sa pagbitbit ng bigat na hindi mo pwedeng ibahagi kahit kanino.Hindi ito pelikulang dapat lang mapanood, pelikula ito na dapat pakinggan. Dahil sa mundo kung saan ang babae’y madalas pinagdidiskitahan, ang Sunshine ay isang matapang na bulong: ‘Pakinggan mo naman kami.'",3
Sunshine,"probably the epitome of the contemporary 2020s philippine cinema; gorgeously shot (an understatement in itself), amazing performances (also, an understatement to maris racal and jennica garcia's acting chops), grounded yet careful writing that walks in eggshells around controversial topics... however it's not afraid to step on some and make crack noises megamall; ayan, izih, gian, santi",9
Sunshine,one of the films I would watch over and over again and still hurt. few minutes in the film and all i can say is this is a very different maris i am watching. and direk tonet!!! GRABE!buhay na buhay ang pelikulang pilipino!,6
Sunshine,"I LOVE THIS SO MUCH  two things: (1) you already know my gripe with movies nowadays being too self-aware, esp when making commentary on social issues (e.g. through infodump dialogues and/or in-your-face monologues). given the themes of this movie, i was initially scared that this'll end up having the same issue— but THANK GOD that wasn't the case here. this one actually took the effort to situate us in Sunshine's shoes. it knew how to convey Sunshine's story by fleshing out the world that she lives in, by showing how she relates to others, by showing us the things she does not do and does not say. this movie knows how to practice restraint! that's how it managed to really make Sunshine shine :D(2) i love that this movie makes a very decisive stance on abortion, without having uhhhh such a cold attitude towards children. like, never once did Sunshine change her mind about having an abortion, and this movie also made several strong cases about how motherhood disadvantages/endangers women— but it also makes it clear that the problem is not... the babies/children? in fact the children are also victims here, as shown in Ariana's case. instead of being shown as ~the problem~ pa nga, this movie instead shows us that children may symbolize hope and companionship and possibilities. the unwanted pregnancy made life difficult for both Menggay and Ariana— but wasn't it Ariana, still, who stood up for Menggay? what Sunshine went through throughout the entire film was difficult and isolating— but she wasn't exactly alone, was she? hindi man niya gusto 'yung bata, there was a part of her that sought comfort from the possibility of the child's companionship. i think it's just human nature, yenno, to seek connections from others when going through a difficult time. and when you live in a society where you can't disclose all these troubles to anyone, not even to those closest to you— whose companionship can you seek, if not your own flesh that's taking shape into another life? sino pa ba ang mas makakaintindi sa 'yo kundi ang sarili mong laman at dugo? yeah in practice that may not be true LOL kaya nga ipinaabort pa rin ni Sunshine eh xD kahit anong ""romantic"" ng notion na susuportahan ka ng anak mo anuman ang pangarap mo, that's practically impossible when its very existence is what could hinder you from reaching them lol. pero ayun nga, it's the difficulty of the situation and our human vulnerabilities that add nuance to these discussions.—some pro-choice people (and i know they mean well naman) like to claim that abortion is ok because it's just getting rid of some soulless clumps of tissue anyway. and i guess that's scientifically true... but if fetuses are rly just soulless clumps of tissue then why are we so afraid of pregnancy at all...? why do we want to do abortions as early as possible...? I MEAN LIKE, it's silly to keep dismissing the possibility of actual growing life when discussing these things. and the fact that Sunshine Did Not Do That makes this movie good and relevant and real and special and a must-must-must-must watch. i love this movie <33 i hope more people get to see it",-1
Sunshine,"in a world where girls are called disgrasyada for carrying the consequences of what boys get to laugh of, where religion teaches you guilt before it teaches you choice, Sunshine makes you sit in that reality.this film should hurt and make you uncomfortable because it’s real. this is what is happening to us women and children. imagine ah the first thing she did when she found out na buntis siya is bumisita sa simbahan para mag sorry. we are raised in a country to fear God more than to trust our own body. it just feels like we are destined to bleed. this film didn’t try to redeem anyone. it didn’t even ask for forgiveness. it just told the truth and maybe that’s the bravest thing it could doSunshine you are so loved by me!!!! best film i’ve watched so far that is just so raw & vulnerable. i teared up watching this, especially the part na tinabihan siya ng ate nya :,)",-1
Sunshine,"Round of applause to Maris Racal and Direk Tonet!!!!Mabuhay ang pelikulang pilipino I guess??? because wtf this was so goood. makes me think about the rawness that Pamilya Ordinaryo served to us. Pwede nang gawan ng List to: “Mga pelikulang kuha ang lagkit ng Maynila” along with Third World Romance, atbp.Ive really been waiting for so long to rate a new filipino film high and rave about it??? Hahaha. Liekkk wow we could deliver. Yung editing, kayang kaya naman pala na hindi mukhang fake na parang hd vlog o glossy commercial like every other netflix cheapflix? That’s my irk talaga. Gets ba? Hindi rin sya overly desaturated para lang maachieve yung indie-ness. Ito, may grit sya, may saktong texture, may angas. Sabihin na nating pretentious pero it’s really a big part of making “cinema” happen hahahaMARIS RACAL mahal kita and it never waivered! ang galing galing mo. Youre really one of the best actresses of our generation. Flowers also to Jennica Garcia at adun sa bunsong lalakeAnyway. GETS. Yes to giving women the choice! Make abortion legal. Women’s rights, particularly reproductive health rights, are basic human rights! Tangina tama ba papa god? Thank you papa god.",-1
Sunshine,Magpapa essay ako after ko maka recover. Still in shock.,0
Sunshine,"“Drown out the noise. You’re Sunshine.” i know that everyone already said it, but this is one of the best filipino films this year! sobrang tapang and opens a lot of conversations about abortion, healthcare, sex education, lahat na! sobrang galing ni Maris, di ko siya nakita as Maris Racal in this film ramdam ko na siya talaga si Sunshine. it was a performance of a lifetime and her best film to date. this film depicts kung gaano nagpagiiwanan and close-minded yung mga pinoy with topics about abortion lalo na at taliwas ito sa religion natin, it also shows how unfair our healthcare and justice system is. the fact na halos walang kakampi karamihan nang mga nakaka-experience nang unwanted pregnancy, sobrang nakaka-lungkot na kahit mga hospital hindi ka matutulungan dahil hindi legal ang abortion sa bansa. i hope that more filipinos watch this and be open on why abortion has to be legal in the philippines. sobrang ganda talaga, wala na akong masabi!",-1
Sunshine,"mula palang sa pagbili ng pregnancy test, hanggang sa paglalahad ni sunshine na ayaw niyang maging ina, kapansin-pansin ang paulit-ulit na pagsumbat sa kanyang pagiging bata. ipinagdidiinan na hindi pa raw niya kayang mag-isip para sa sarili.habang nanonood, hindi ko maiwasang mapaisip: ano kaya ang gagawin ko kung ang nasa posisyon ni sunshine ay isang babaeng malapit sa akin? at ano naman kaya ang magiging trato ng mga taong malapit sa akin kung ako naman ang nasa posisyon ni sunshine? sa ngayon, siguro hindi ko pa alam ang mga sagot diyan. pero nakakatakot isipin na ang problemang 'to ay napakalapit sa akin, at alam kong kahit minsan sa buong buhay ko, makakakilala ako ng isang babaeng nasa katulad na sitwasyon ni sunshine na magigipit sa isang sistemang lugi na lugi sila.malinaw na ipinakita ng pelikula kung gaano kaatrasado ang usaping reproductive rights sa ating bansa. sa halip na matuunan ang mga kasong ganito at mabigyan ng suporta, kinakailangan pa ng mga babae na maghanap ng mga alternatibong mas delikado para sa kanilang sarili at sa kanilang dinadala.ang ganda ng pelikulang ito dahil wala nang ibang makapag-unawa at makapagkuwento nito nang buong-buo kundi isang babae lang din.hayyyy.., maris racal, i am your #1 defender. direk tonete, i am your #1 truther. at salamat Papa God for Piolo Pascual! #needthat",3

Sunshine,"The first movie for 2025 that i'm giving my precious 5 stars. And although I would never change my stance on abortion, I always believe that my personal beliefs should never discredit or deny an excellent film-the credit where credit is due. Antoinette Jadaone's best film to date since Never Not Love You. The performance by Maris Racal is a career-defining one, she is so damn good, she can even give Natalie Portman a run for her money. Her subtleties in her emotions are so raw, her transformation into a gymnast is so believable and displayed such bravura, for a moment there she became the character, she was Sunshine—a flawed character that warrants empathy and compassion instead of judgment. So deserving of my 230 pesos. If I could watch this again on the big screen I would.",5

Sunshine,"Hindi lang basta coming-of-age film ang Sunshine. Isa itong kwentong maraming pinanghahawakang realidad, at inilalagay ka sa posisyon ng isang babaeng lumalaban para sa katawan niya, kinabukasan niya, at boses niya.Ang husay ng pagkakalahad ng Sunshine sa mabibigat na isyu tulad ng abortion, Catholic guilt, patriyarka, kahirapan, kakulangan sa public healthcare, reproductive health, teenage pregnancy, at kababaihan sa sports—pero ni minsan, hindi siya naging pilit o nangaral. Ramdam mong may tiwala siya sa manonood. Si Sunshine ang pumili para sa sarili niya, pero ikaw, binibigyan ka ng espasyong pag-isipan 'yon sa sarili mong paraan.Malinaw kung ano ang tinutumbok ng pelikula, at 'yon ang isa sa pinakamalakas nitong punto. Alam niya kung anong gusto niyang sabihin, pero hindi ka niya dinidiktahan kung paano mo ito tatanggapin. Binibigyan ka ng sapat na puwang para makaramdam, magtanong, at magnilay.

Sunshine,Mahal ko ang pelikula na ‘to. Mahal kita Sunshine. Kakampi mo ako Sunshine. Thank you Papa God sa pelikula na ‘to. Thank you Papa God kay Direk Tonet. Thank you Papa God sa lahat ng bumubuo ng pelikulang ito. Sana maraming maka-gets ba,16

Sunshine,"Sunshine offers something refreshing and different in Philippine cinema—and honestly, we need more stories like this. It’s bold, necessary, and deserves to be talked about. Kailangan natin ng mga kwentong totoo—‘yung nagpapakita ng realidad ng pamumuhay sa bansa natin.Under the direction of Antoinette Jadaone, Sunshine goes beyond being just a story about sports or dreams. It’s a story about womanhood in the Philippines—isang bansang deeply rooted sa religion, conservatism, at kung saan ang mga usaping tulad ng abortion ay nananatiling taboo. But the film’s message resonates far beyond our borders. It reflects the reality of so many women around the world. The film speaks so much truth about the lived experiences of countless women, and saludo talaga ako sa tapang ng mga gumawa nito. In these times, it takes guts to tell a story like this.Sunshine, as a character, represents those who dare to dream, and more importantly, those who dare to choose for themselves. The film is a powerful reminder that you have the right to carve your own path. Lalo na sa isang bansa na madalas i-demonize ang mga choices ng kababaihan, ng LGBTQ+ community, o kahit sinong pumipili para sa sarili nila.The entire film is gripping, emotional, and tense in the best way. Sa bawat eksena, may bigat, may puso, may katotohanan. I genuinely believe Sunshine will be remembered as a modern classic in Philippine cinema. Isa itong pelikulang hindi lang dapat panoorin, kundi pag-usapan.Maris Racal gave the performance of a lifetime. And bilib ako sa tapang mo, Direk Tonet. Salamat sa kwento. Gets ko na.",12
Sunshine,"An important story, that highlights a very important reality in the country. I don’t think I completely agree with giving physical form to the child, but I understand the choice. I do think the boyfriend was too much of a caricature, and the narrative would have benefitted from a little nuance, to add more texture and reality. loved the underlying web of support from most of the women on screen, probably the best part of the whole film.",-1
Sunshine,"Napakarelevant ng mga ganitong movie lalo na sa panahon natin ngayon. Totoong totoo, hindi minadali, and ramdam mo yung alaga ng filmmakers sa paggawa ng pelikula. Pinaalala and pinakita sa akin in a raw way yung reality na hinaharap ng maraming babae sa Pilipinas. I can honestly say na lumalim yung understanding and empathy ko, especially towards young Filipino women. Sobrang galing ni Maris Racal, ramdam na ramdam from the screen lahat ng emotions na dala dala ni Sunshine. First time ko lang din mapanuod si Jennica Garcia and omg napakahusay !!! Siya ata paborito ko dito sa movie heheh very touching and nakakaiyak sobra yung relationship nilang mag ate. I watched this with my younger sister which made it more memorable, and natutuwa ako na naging malalim and maganda yung kwentuhan namin pagkatapos manuod.",-1
Sunshine,struggles of being a woman in the ph,7
Sunshine,an eye-opener  it really let you feel what sunshine was going through and how hard it was to face her dilemma especially that her lifelong dream is at risk. stellar performance from maris but i also loved jennica's!!,-1
Sunshine,potangina gawin niyo na lahat sakin wag lang kumantot ng lalaki at mabuntis,0
Sunshine,gets :’),-1
Sunshine,grabe wala pa isang linggo naka 2nd watch na ako HAHAHAH w glyka this time na for the past 6 years kasama ko nanonood ng mga direk tonet films LOL,35
Sunshine,Simple yet raw.,1
Sunshine,Felt like I had been run over by a car.,15
Sunshine,"Direk tonet and the rest of the Sunshine crew are so brave for tackling such a sensitive yet prevalent issue in this patriarchal and catholic society. I liked how they showed both sides of the debate, sparking conflict in me as well as a viewer. And even though I am a catholic who grew up in an all-girls school, I found myself saying “gets ko si Sunshine”, kasi ‘yun yung realidad. Not everyone has access to the same resources, nor the privilege to live comfortably. Dito ko rin natutunan na wala akong karapatang manghusga.Maris Racal, tangina napakahusay mo!!! She portrayed Sunshine’s desperation, anxiety, and grit in such a raw manner that it was so beautiful. Fan na fan mo rin ako Jennica Garcia! I think everyone should see this film at least once in their lifetime. It shows the reality of Manila and forces you to face the truths of young Filipino women. Dahil din dito ay mas nahikayat akong pag-usapan ang aborsyon, at sana ganun din ang mangyari sa lahat ng manonood nito. Kasi dapat talaga siyang pag-usapan! A very beautiful and thought-provoking film! Salamat sa sining, direk tonet at maris racal! This is what filmmaking is all about!",28
Sunshine,"Ilang minuto pa lang sa panonood, malinaw na agad sa akin ang mensahe ng pelikula. Hindi gusto ni Sunshine na ipagpatuloy ang isang bagay na hindi niya piniling simulan, at nauunawaan ko siya.Nauunawaan kita Sunshine. Gayundin ang ibang kababaihang nasa parehong katayuan mo. Hindi madaling maging babae, lalo na sa Pilipinas kung saan walang batas na magbibigay-karapatan sa ating awtonomiya sa katawan at reproduktibong kalusugan. Sa madaling salita, walang batas para sa ligal at ligtas na aborsyon.Katulad ni Sunshine, may tapang, puso, at paninindigan ang pelikula. At hindi ito magiging posible kung hindi dahil sa maingat na direksiyon ni Direk Tonet at mahusay na pagganap ni Maris Racal. Sa loob ng mahigit isang oras, inilagay ko ang posisyon ko kay Sunshine. Bawat emosyon at sakit na naramdaman ni Sunshine ay tila parang naramdaman ko rin. Totoo nga, na mas iba ang karanasan sa panonood sa sinehan. Dahil doon, makikita mong iisa ang reaksiyon ng bawat tao sa bawat eksena. Mayroong kolektibong karanasan. At para sa akin, isa itong tagumpay na layunin ng pelikula. Maaaring hindi kami pare-pareho ng paninindigan, pero iisa ang aming nararamdaman habang sinusundan ang kuwento ni Sunshine.At sana, marami pa ang maabot ng pelikulang ito. Sana, marami pa ang maging bukas ang kanilang kaisipan sa ganitong kahalagang naratibo. Sana, maging tulay ang pelikulang ito upang magkaroon ng diskurso mula sa mga nakaupo. Dahil ang kuwento ni Sunshine ay tunay na nangyayari, si Sunshine ay isang tunay na tao.",3
Sunshine,"it reflects the real lives of many Filipinos, the struggles, the pain, and just doing whatever you can to get by.it’s brave of the director to tackle abortion, especially in a country where it’s still illegal. u really see the different perspectives people have about it. all in all, the movie was good… no judgment, just raw, real stories.ty.d",13
Sunshine,GETS KO NA ,33

Sunshine,that one frame at avenida inn!!!!!!,1
Sunshine,"Such a powerful story to tell. Women in the Philppines deserve better and more accessible reproductive rights!!!! The layers to the story, the journey we went through, and the messaging was so deep and meaningful. The added narrative tool with the children aiding the pregnant teens––inspiring! It grounded the entire story. I am so grateful this film exists.",-1
Sunshine,Balikan kitang review,1
Sunshine,"— gets na gets kita sunshine (rant bc i need to take out sum shit that people my age cannot understand +medj spoilers)although I’ve always supported pro-choice, i still grew up in an environment and society of toxic, judgemental, religious people na sobrang diri sa idea ng topics na pinapakita ng movie nato… i have to admit that i am not perfect and have either stayed silent or have been partially agreeing w/ them to stay out of judgement,,,, that’s the issue here. Maraming tao na nagsasabi lang ng,,, “Bat ba hindi kayo nag-iisip?” or “Sinisira nyo lang future nyo”  I’m not here to normalize teenage pregnancy at all pero nakakakalungkot talaga how other people view the WOMEN in the situation. Ang dali dali nyo manghusga ng ating mga kapwa babae dhil di sila nagiintay for marriage, or minamadali nila ung “paglandi”, but it’s never on the guy. Its normal for us humans to feel lust and think about sexuality but I do not want to glorify it okay,, Sunshine as a person is not perfect, shes human. And so are all the other sunshines in the world. I have debated about the topic of teenage pregnancy a few times now and all i wish for is a better system in our country, and more support for the girls who have no choice, wether from strangers, family, loved ones, non-governmental organizations, or governmental ones,, even just that is rare haha. Abortion is not murder, it’s saving your life; and aswell as your child’s life from being put into an environment that isn’t meant for them. Adoption after labor isn't always the right choice. Imagine if u actually gave birth to it and put it up for adoption that ends the baby up in a worse household noh!!?!?!? If a girl isn’t ready to give birth, and has an independent choice, there shouldn’t be people to stop her at that point. One thing i dislike hearing is people bringing religious “morality” into the topic. It’s honestly super disrespectful, don't want to elaborate it anymore.Everything else aside, well no,, i just wanted to finally say how beautiful and educational this film was, the message was loud, raw, and clear, and is such an eye-opener to people who are unfamiliar with the topic; to see the authenticity of what teenage victims in the philippines go through, we see two perspectives, (Arianna) a little girl in a toxic household r’ed by her uncle, (Sunshine) and a young adult going through pregnancy, not being able to bare seeing another girl torturing her body— both suffering through the judgements of their fellow filipinos. This shows that we can never truly understand what somebody is going through unless we experience it in our own hands. But i wont forget about Annika Co in this movie ofc. Her part of being here shows na nde masama turuan ang mga kabataan tungkol sa mga gantong sensitibo na topic, and that Sunshine was never alone in her journey, Annika’s character was there to guide Sunshine on her journey, even though they had hardships with their relationship together, in the conclusion, the kid understood how Sunshine felt, and supported her throughout the end and that is more than enough.Basta i love u sunshine  this was not just a review of the movie, but also my personal rant feeling the reality beyond this fictional movie. Absolute cinemahay kingina tlg ni miggy and bubot !! I do not glorify teenage pregnancy/abortion but we should not disregard our rights as women to be able to make our own decisions for our future",-1
Sunshine,PERIOD (pun intended),1
Sunshine,"no one tells you how alone it feels. to carry something you didnt ask for. to suffer in silence because your pain is inconvenient, because your choices are not yours. sunshine didnt just show that. it made me remember it. it made me feel it again.i watched it twice. and both times, it hurt in the same places. but it also touched something soft in me.a reminder im not the only one whos ever felt this way. her name was sunshine. but nothing about her story was light. and maybe thats the point—women are expected to shine, even when everything inside is collapsing. she made bad choices. yes. but what choices do we really have, when the world makes decisions for our bodies before we even know how they work? what choice does a girl have when the world punishes her for not being ready, and punishes her again for trying to survive it? when the system has failed us already when they have decided that bearing a baby is a demand and not a choice?and i felt seen. in all the things i was too scared to say out loud. the hiding. the pain you cant tell your mother about. the googling. the not knowing where to get pills, or how to afford them. the fear of your own body, and the shame of not understanding it. putangina. ang hirap maging babae. lalo na sa bansang pilit kang pinatatahimik.and still—there was warmth. there was sunshine. because somehow, this film made me feel less alone. because stories like this remind us that we are not alone. that our pain is not isolated. that someone out there is watching too, and feeling seen. that is what sunshine gave me. a relieving and painful kind of light. that not everything has to be healed, sometimes it just has to be shared.",-1
Sunshine,"Gutsy. Had a few elements that were pretty clunky but the razor-edge, frayed rawness sold the everyday dream of a coming-of-age Filipina coming of age in a country where the very same notion is downright dangerous. Maris Racal might just be the finest young actress amongst her contemporaries.",25
Sunshine,"Kakampi mo ako.I think what felt most important to me about this film is that the sensitivities considered in writing this story ensured that reality was still being shown. It showed respect for the people direk was able to interview, and it showed disdain for the culture we perpetuate in the guise of religion and culture.It calls for the audience to see the effects of the choices they ask of others. It calls for empathy for the victims and what they have to go through and give up — their dreams, their childhood, their life. And it calls for disgust for the old ways of thinking, and possibly our skewed views on morality.And in these hard times, how proper support from the people around you can allow you to make decisions for yourself and not because of what others will think. Something that most people do not readily have in our society.Every moment of this film has emphasized a deep-rooted societal problem that was asking to be seen. And kudos to direk Tonet for doing so beautifully.",-1
Sunshine,"peak philippine cinema! gets na gets kita, sunshine.",9
Sunshine,"sana mabuksan pa lalo ang usapin about abortion sa pilipinas at sana mas lalo pa tayong maging matapang na ipaglaban ang karapatan natin. i cannot stress enough how banning abortion doesn't stop women from getting it, it only put their lives at risk. mahal kita sunshine!",4
Sunshine,"MAHAL NA MAHAL KITA SUNSHINE, MARY GRACE AT SA LAHAT NG MGA BABAE NA PATULOY NA BINIBIGO NG SISTEMASa daming babae na napapahamak dahil sa unsafe abortion, masasabi pa ba nating gumagana ang mga kasalukuyang batas at religious teachings to actually protect life? Sana mapanood ‘to ng mga taong hindi pa naiintindihan nang lubusan ang buong konsepto o yung mga pinipiling hindi buksan ang kanilang mga mata. Sana pagkalabas na sinehan ay masasabayan din nila si bata na bumulong ng “Gets ko na.”",3
Sunshine,"Cried four times lol.While I don’t think this movie is going to convert any pinoy pro-lifers, I also don’t think that’s the movie’s purpose anyway. This movie is so pinoy, or at least in the Manila sense. The city noise, the sweltering heat, all radiating in the background of Sunshine’s journey to get an abortion. I wouldn’t say the movie’s perfect—I have some issues with the use of Sunshine’s motivations as a student athlete being a little flat—but the movie resonates in the parts where it matters.",-1
Sunshine,"Although Sunshine (2024) advanced the conversation about abortion and body autonomy, one treatment of the film sets the conversation back.Don't get me wrong tho', it effectively presented difficult conversations within an already difficult subject. It doesn't just talk about abortion in the moral sense, but also its nuances—such as abuse and inaccessibility of healthcare, including both financial and policymaking aspects that rob women of the right to appropriate medical procedures.It also gave face to the concept of guilt through the personification of the unborn, embodied by the characters of the unnamed child and Ariana.But that very personification is where exactly the issue starts.The argument for the pro-choice position is the fact that life does not start at conception, but upon delivery. To personify unborn fetuses strengthens the narrative that abortion is murder. ""Murderer,"" as the unnamed child called Sunshine the moment abortion crossed her mind upon knowing that she's pregnant.But how much does this set the conversation back? Not a lot, really.The film did not fail in doing its job. By tackling abortion itself, it already succeeded in sparking conversations such as this one. And that's already a huge step in advancing women's right to accessible healthcare.Let's just hope that we'll get to see more ""woke indie films"" like Sunshine (2024). Art, after all, is not solely for its own sake.",-1
Sunshine,nabwisit ako kay ej canlas pero sana buntisin nya rin ako,1
Sunshine,ang saya ang daming theater peeps,-1
Sunshine,"i am sunshine, i was once sunshine. the dreams i thought i wouldn't reach because of one incident made everyday a living hell for me. the pain i had to endure alone every night, playing the waiting game, taking in all the harsh words everyone would say. this film just brings back the pain i suffered through but it also encapsulated how the people around me supported and stayed with me through it. may this film be a comfort to the other sunshines out there. this is the reality that needs to be depicted, it might receive criticisms but this film captures the whole of the essence of being a woman. i cried throughout the movie, i know how bad the pain is. gets kita sunshine, gets na gets kita.",-1
Sunshine,Mas napansin ko in this viewing yung tunggalian at mga kontradiksyong dulot ng statistically-proven na internal misogyny.,7
Sunshine,"Gets ko na.This line had me in tears. One of the most heartwarming scenes for me in the film. It was like an understanding between Sunshiner and herself, and Sunshine and her unborn child na okay lang. Okay lang minsan sundin yung pangarap mo.Also, the scene between Jennica Garcia and Maris Racal near the end. Jennica saying na..Andito lang si Ate.This shows how a safe space and support should always start at home. :(The film clearly depicts how it is so hard for women, especially in a country where everything does not support the women's rights, to be acknowledged. How women needed to work extra hard. Be perfect. Bawal magkamali. Bawal mahina. At laging nag-aadjust sa society na mga lalaki ang pinapaburan.Acting wise and the direction are good as well.",-1
Sunshine,"Gets ko na Sobrang totoo. So real. I really loved the scenes that made you feel the weight of each decision she had to do, it makes you breathe and immerses you inside the world. Minsan napapatanong rin ako kung ano gagawin ko sa ganyan situation kahit wala akong ano. It's definitely brave and a step up for filipino cinema knowing that these kind of topics are still taboo in this country. Pamilyar ako sa mga pinuntahan nya kung kaya't…",9
Sunshine,wow.(eto muna for now pero follow up ko soon mahabang review ko),35
Sunshine,"A wise philosopher once said,JUST FINISHED WATCHING SUNSHINE. A MUST-WATCH MOVIE! CONGRATS PO DIREK @tonetjadaone AND THANK YOU PO FOR SHARING THIS MOVIE TO EVERYONE.

Sunshine,"“AriaNUH slay slay slayyy” absolute legend LMAO I went into this movie not knowing anything about it and absolutely exceeded my expectations. Very emotional and honest watch, an eye opener to subjects that aren’t given much light. I hate how there is the depiction that ‘dreams have to end when motherhood starts’ ABSOLUTELY NO! What tore me apart is that this is real and could/ probably be happening today. Sunshine’s spiral when it came to dealing with the world was…",-1
Sunshine,"5 stars k saken edit: after days, i still think about this film. i will probably think about this film for life. direk tonet, you have definitely outdone yourself with this one. your mind!!!!! the way you just get it… because Gets. bilang direktor at bilang tao, sigurado ako na pag-uusapan ka at ang mga pelikula mo kahit na ilang taon pa ang lumipas. your movies will linger. and we will yearn for . thank you for making this film!!!!…",6
Sunshine,"Madaming bawal sa mundo, pero mas madaming bawal sa Pilipinas basta’t babae ka.",0
Sunshine,"The story didn't go the direction I thought it would, and I’m glad it didn’t. An intersectional approach to abortion is exactly the film this country needs, depicting internal and external conflict is a realistic but still emotionally charged way.My only gripe with this film is that I’m not a fan of how this film looks and sounds — a sentiment I share across the current Filipino cinematic landscape. This film is a landmark, which is exactly why I hoped it would give more in terms of cinematography and music.But nitpicking aside, this film is perfect as it is.",13
Sunshine,"Hindi ako si sunshine at wala rin akong matres. Pero gets ko siya. At sana sa pag lipas ng panahon, mas dumami ang mga taong makaka-gets sa kanya. At bilang isang future healthcare worker, sana dumami pa ang mga taong katulad ni Doc Helena, na matapang na nilalabanan ang sistemang hindi mapagpalaya.All things said, this film is undoubtedly one of the important Filipino films of the decade. It encapsulates the growing debate on whether a woman should have the right to HER OWN body. More Filipino films should be bolder like this.At para sa mga sunshine, laban lang. May mga taong kagaya ko na gets kayo. Sana dumating na rin ang araw kung saan masisinagan na ang inyong karapatan na matagal na ninyong inaasam.",-1
Sunshine,"That is the kind of mix of realism and surrealism that I want to achieve. Nakaka-inspire sakin ito bilang manlilikha because it's not pretentious and it shouldn't be pero napaka lakas ng mensahe, isa yan sa mga gusto kong mamaster bilang manunulat. Pacing, composition and all gave me hope with my obscure ideas na kakayanin ko din maging direktor. Ang husay ni Maris Racal dito heck I think lahat ng aktor dito gave it their all lalong lalo na yung mga child actors. And even if this film with the themes that it tackles, I think this is the first time in a LONG while na napatawa ako ng malakas sa movie theater. Legit.What can I say, its just that good",6
Sunshine,hell yeah,-1
Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine doesn’t waste time. Within ten minutes, we already know what the titular character wants: she doesn’t want this pregnancy. What follows isn’t a mystery or a coming-of-age arc- it’s a fight.We meet Sunshine as she trains for the Olympic gymnastics qualifiers. She’s 19- focused, disciplined, and carrying a dream she’s had and has trained for since she was 10. Then she discovers she’s pregnant. From that moment on, the film never strays from what Sunshine wants: will she be able to get an abortion?Sound design is a big part in every movie and in Sunshine, the sound feels like another character. Before her routines, her coach tells her to “drown out the noise.” But what if you can’t? Sunshine lives by a noisy street. She trains in a chaotic gym. There’s a baby in the house that cries at all hours. Even in a church- where she prays not for guidance, but for forgiveness before attempting to buy an abortion pill- there is no peace. Sound, in this film, becomes symbolic of the constant interference she endures. The noise of judgment, of religion, of expectations- it’s relentless.That judgment bleeds into nearly every interaction she has. The pharmacist gives unsolicited opinions when she buys a pregnancy test. Her best friend’s mother condemned her. In a country where over 90% of the population identifies as Christian and Catholicism dominates public life, the supposed separation of church and state is functionally meaningless. Religion makes the rules. And when Sunshine is rushed to the hospital after complications from taking an abortion pill purchased from a street vendor, the doctor shames her in front of other patients, calling her actions “a sin in the eyes of the Lord.”Sunshine carries everything alone. Her future, once so certain, is now uncertain. If she continues the pregnancy, the nine years she spent training will be for nothing. Her body is already changing. Her coach notices. She can’t train like she used to. Her dream is slipping.And then we meet Mary Grace, a quiet but devastating side character whose story lingers. Their first encounter happens at the same place where Sunshine tries to buy an abortion pill. The second time they meet, Mary Grace tells her she thought her bloated belly was just worms- a line so innocent it crushes you. In that moment, we are reminded: she’s a child. A victim of incestuous rape and we later learn she’s just 13, after she was taken to the hospital for complications when she attempted to get rid of her pregnancy.In a country where sex is taboo and sex education is frowned upon by religious leaders, what hope do girls like Mary Grace-or Sunshine-really have?Maris Racal is outstanding. Her physicality, her posture, her tension even in the quite moments makes her character feel very real. She carries the film with a maturity and vulnerability and it’s undeniably Racal’s best work to date.At just 90 minutes, Sunshine is lean and direct. It doesn’t meander. Just a young girl fighting again and again for her dreams.Sunshine is a masterful depiction of what it means to grow up in a country where women and girls lack the right to choose. Where “I don’t want to be a mother” isn’t considered a valid reason. The film drives this home in its final minutes: the guy responsible for Sunshine’s pregnancy shows up at her house with his pastor father. They assure her they’ll support the baby “every step of the way” until the child turns 18. Sunshine listens, then finally says what she’s been saying all along: she doesn’t want to be a mother.We already know this. We’ve known it since the first ten minutes. But her ex and his father don't, or rather, can't understand it. “That’s not the point!” she yells, and she’s right. The moment others found out she was pregnant, it stopped being about her, but about the baby. They had no regard for her dreams, for her aspirations, and how pregnancy will affect her well-being. It was never about if she'll be supported, it was about whether she's still ""allowed"" to have what she wants. And in a country that denies girls and women a choice, the cost is often their dreams, their futures, and sometimes, their lives.Sunshine is just one story, but it’s shared by thousands. And unless the law changes, there will always be more Sunshines. Jadaone’s film dares to say that-loudly-even when the world tells her to drown out the noise.",-1
Sunshine,"can’t count kung gano karami ang pigil iyak ko sa movie na to tangina sobrang laking sampal sa pinas talaga na bakit pa rin ilegal ang abortion when yung character ni rhed bustamante is nabuntis as early as 13??? all of the decisions that sunshine did was valid talaga like you’re willing to take risk para lang sa pangarap mo, pangarap ng pamilya moi really really really love the sisters love tangina grabe yung character ni jennica garcia to the point na i was literally immersing myself into her GETS BA like u can’t compare a sister and a mother’s love talaga. di lang talaga siya like super focused sa abortion yung topic but also it tackles about how fucked up yung pinas sa ganitong sitwasyon like for example, yung sa hospital na scene, GETS naman na u can’t risk ur license pero if u really care and value ur patients well being, atleast u could’ve done something. also, kung paano nammeasure yung safety ng tao talaga is naguumpisa sa bahay like how dafuc u can’t be a proper mother to sustain your child’s needs tapos i-llet go mo lang siya sa ibang tao to get predated??? it was so nice to experience sa cinema ng ganto like so fucking much. i love u direk tonet and maris racal for this movie talaga",-1
Sunshine,you really won't catch a break in manila,-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine does not go the way of those brutish Brillante Mendoza social commentary flicks where the end goal is to suffer, and suffer, and suffer... instead it opts to project its demons as an internal problem. That, which works quite splendidly if not for the fact that this is a film supported by a very tepid and uncharacteristic score from Maris Racal's own ex-partner.That being said, the best things about Sunshine actually emanate from its night sequences. It captures wholly the distress, illegality, and dismay of everything to do with abortion, the black market, and whatever Sunshine's problems are adjacent to in reality. Those night scenes seemed straight out of Abbas Kiarostami’s Like Someone in Love.It's actually so apparent by the film's end that everything that does come out of this leads to the most reasonable one: a film that doesn't explicitly preach what to do, save for what its problem is tied to in context.But yeah, that score really does this thing a disservice. Tom Cruise was right.Anyway, WHAT IS MY HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL DOING IN THIS MOVIE? (siya yung binasagan ng bote nga pala)",17

Sunshine,"Kung hindi ngayon, kailan? Kung hindi ako ang magiging boses ng aking mga batang babae, sino? Mahalagang pakinggan, bigyang halaga, pagtuunan ng pansin, at kilalanin ang boses natin, ng mga kababaihan.Ang usapin na ito ay hindi “bastos” at “nakakahiya”. Ito ay usapin ng karapatan at pagtatanggol sa karapatan ng mga babae. Ang pagiging kaisa sa abortion ay hindi ibigsabihing hinahatak natin ang mga kabataan sa mga gawaing imoral. It is about having choices especially sa mga kababaihanh biktima ng karahasan, kahirapan, at pagsasamtala sa kamusmusan. Not having a choice is actually a choice but sadly, that choice is not what us women need. We want to be heard. We want to have a choice that is pro women. Bilang guro, tungkulin ko ang ituro ang karapatang pantao at kasama sa tubgkulin na yon ang pagbabahagi ng karapatan na dapat ay malayang ibinibigay sakanila.Hindi ako makapikit sa mga isyung direktang nakaaapekto sa kanila.

I just knew this tandem would deliver something special, and they absolutely did, it truly is something. Maris did a great performance, and this film truly deserves everyone’s attention. Well-deserved ang Crystal Bear. But to be honest, I was a bit hesitant lang sa character ni Annika at first, don’t get me wrong, she’s good, but hindi ko alam during the film if necessary ba sya? and I feel like naging unrealistic yung palabas bigla but eventually natanggap ko din naman and yes, “gets na gets.”I’ve been a supporter of Maris ever since her PBB days and I know that many, including myself, won’t forget her issue, but I hope this film and her talent alone will open more doors for her in the film industry.

Sunshine,"direk tonet, i am (and will forever be) in awe of you.i have always been hooked on to this film even before its philippine premiere, due to its striking plot and of course the leading star attached to it, maris racal. watching this film on the big screen, i felt so uneasy knowing that this is pretty much a reality for filipino women and women overall.sunshine is more than just a story of a girl tortured by the thoughts of bearing a child at such a young age; it is a grounded story surrounded by problems caused by societal pressure towards women and questionable christian morals and beliefs, which also opens up the current state of the country in terms of healthcare and its views on abortion. art has always been meant to provoke, and direk tonet did it so gracefully—like how sunshine performed her routines, but still so raw with scenes depicting medically unsafe abortions during the second half.the cinematography was very pleasing for the eyes. most of the shots used were very effective in laying out the emotional impact of this film, most especially its exterior and tight shots with sunshine being the subject. another directorial choice that caught my attention was its symbolism. notably, the use of bata and ariana as figments of sunshine's imaginations. despite those major choices, i personally liked the subtle and unnoticeable details more because i truly believe that it was those that helped keep the film coherent with its vision. details like added sound bites from the television and radio or the production design of sunshine's house.overall, i love it. yun lang HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",12
Sunshine,"watching this movie took me back and reminded me that pagbabae ka, magisa ka lang. they were able to encapsulate that with sunshine navigating everything on her own. having to hide because there is no other choice. the moment she tells anyone, she wont get help, it means surrendering her dreams even if she doesnt want to. to have a movie discuss the sensitive topics of this country such as abortion, child pregnancy, premarital pregnancy, and the negative side of religion is so brave. to be able to show it in a story so compelling and very filipino is so important imo. sobrang ganda ng cinematography, using manila’s lights and noise while also highlighting the darkness within its shadows. everyone’s performance in this film adds so much to the already great backdrop and dialogues. there was so many scenes that went so hard, too. when sunshine was on the jeep, when she was alone in that motel, when she performed, even when she was just walking. every scene felt so important because maris embodied and delivered sunshine so well. ramdam ko yung galit, yung desperasyon, yung sikip sa dibdib ng walang magawa. especially when she woke up in the hospital, the doctora started making her ask god for forgiveness. my blood boiled and i may have cried angry tears ngl. we are so used to religious guilt tripping in this country, its not even helping anyone. anyway, Sunshine deserves her flowers. Gets na gets ko siya. she’s the reflection of the filipina of our time. Full of hopes and dreams, yet pulled down by the country that does not care about the health and safety of its people.",-1

Sunshine,lesson learned: putangina,1
Sunshine,"“kahit anong mangyari, kakampi kita.”first of all, this movie is so refreshing. it shows the struggles of our main character, sunshine, and goes into depth how unwanted pregnancy can lead to mental and physical problems, the desperation of having limited options and resources, the shame encoded into our heads at birth by religious and societal expectations, and most importantly, it shows the resilience women are forced to do just to simply survive.second of all—i love, love, LOVE how this story is not your typical filipino pro-life propaganda warning. it’s honestly so upsetting how conservative and unprogressive our county is with abortion, but hopefully with this movie, older generations can sympathize with not just sunshine, but also mary grace’s situation.i’m actually so glad sunshine doesn’t force its main character to attach herself to the stigma of “abortion is murder” mindset; but rather, being able to be firm and push through with her decision—knowing that she’s not ready to be a mother—and doing what’s right for her (and the baby), without the influence of her boyfriend’s opinion, as well as the boyfriend’s father who offered to take care of financial expenses, which is quite rare.another beautiful moment in this movie that i personally love is the sisterhood between sunshine and geleen. geleen’s understanding nature is powerful in itself—that having one person who will love you and guide you despite everything you’re facing can make your way in life a little easier. knowing that you have someone to lean on in times like this is so fortunate, cause not many filipinas can have that kind of support system.and dr. helena’s help? as someone pursuing medicine, i understand the male doctor’s perspective on how he doesn’t want to loose his license, but with just dr. helena stepping in discreetly, she is incredibly brave. she’s risking her entire life on the line for someone she doesn’t even know, and for me, that’s such a great example of camaraderie between women.although the first doctor that “helped” sunshine was unnecessarily rude. i’m glad geleen stepped in and defended her sister. as a doctor, don’t you have to leave religious talk outside work? what an asshole.overall, i’m so glad that philippine cinema is slowly stepping out of its comfort zone to talk about sensitive topics like these despite half (or even the majority) of the country being against abortion. i hope this movie spreads like wildfire—a wake-up call to break free from patriarchal laws, and the belief that women’s bodies and choices are truly their own.",-1
Sunshine,simple premise told in a very raw and creative way,1
Sunshine,"This. This is the movie I will recommend to international friends if they want to know the Philippines.The characters, the culture, the psyche, how far and behind we are in women's rights and sex education is rolled into this beautiful, heart wrenching movie. We may venerate a baby (Sto. Nino) and the virgin (Mary), but the way women and children are treated is ironically (if not disgustingly) far apart from our devotion to the Catholic faith. And we are reminded of it from the set and location. Even the jeepney's signage. The writing is clever in its use of language. Its use of [insert -ism] was gently introduced and when you realized what it is, it hits hard. I can't describe it any other way how confidently gentle this was tackled.It reminded me of 70's-80's era of Filipino films. This is the highest praise in the canon of Philippine cinema. I can't praise this enough. Watch it, if you have the time and money, in theaters. It is very much worth it.",13

Sunshine,"been a few days since i watched the film as of writing this but i still can’t find the proper words to describe the experience of watching sunshine in the cinemas with all the people around me. first of all, it really is a different feeling to enjoy a movie in the cinema and see how other viewers will react to scenes as the film progresses. may dagdag factor talaga sya na napapaganda lalo yung film and mas nakaka-engross talaga sha for me grabe!!!!! hands down lang talaga sa performance ni maris. her character wasn’t merely a persona shaped by the script or the vision of the writer, SHE IS SUNSHINE. PERIOD. sobrang natural yung expressions, parang nandun talaga ako sa tabi nya for the entire journey to sea games (and in my head, pati sa olympics na pinapangarap nya ) and it’s mindblowing how i never really felt na movie yung pinapanood ko— everything felt so real because what’s portrayed is the reality. sa totoong buhay, kahit na ang laki na ng pagbabagong naganap tungo sa pagkakaroon ng lugar ng babae sa lipunan, ang realidad ay marami pa rin ang ipinagkakait sa kanila. marami pa ring hakbang ang maaaring gawin at mga pagbabago na dapat isulong dahil hindi sapat na ang mga filipinong babae ay naikakahon sa imahe na hinubog ng daang-taong impluwensiya ng katolisismo sa naging kultura natin. ANG MGA KABABAIHANG PINOY AY MATAPANG! MAABILIDAD! MAHUSAY! AT HIGIT SA LAHAT, SILA AY PUNO NG PANGARAP. nakakalungkot na hanggang sa kasalukuyan, ang mga desisyon na dapat sila ang gumagawa ay patuloy pa rin na hinahadlangan hindi lamang ng batas kundi pati ng kapwa-tao mismo. the symbolisms in the movie are subtle yet soooo impactful. the color choices sa outfit ni maris at annika, the choices of angles sa mga eksena na parang nanliliit sya o kaya ay triumphant, maging sa mga shot na sinusuntok ni sunshine yung tiyan nya— these details make the movie worth rewatching just to dig deeper into the creative choices sa movie. hands down to direk tonet and everyone who shaped the film to become what it is today<33until now, hindi pa rin ako sigurado kung sapat ba yung mga naisulat ko para maipahayag kung ano ang tunay na naramdaman ko upon watching this movie. pero ang mahalaga, GETS KO NA.",-1

Sunshine,"There are films that entertain, and then there are films that hold up a mirror—brutal, honest, and impossible to look away from.Sunshine did that to me. It stripped me raw and left me in quiet reflection long after the screen went black. I saw in Sunshine’s story not just a character, but the collective ache of countless women who’ve had to choose between self-preservation and duty.The central challenge of Sunshine—a young gymnast discovering her pregnancy at the cusp of her Olympic dream—hit me in a visceral way. Not because I’ve ever been pregnant, or aspired to the Olympics, but because I know what it’s like to carry something heavy in silence, to want something for yourself while the world insists you exist for others.Sunshine’s fear, defiance, and quiet longing mirrored the emotional territory I navigate daily: trying to live on my terms in a world that insists I don’t get to choose.My full review here: inthewakeofthings.wordpress.com/2025/07/30/sunshine-2024-on-choice-compassion-and-the-weight-of-expectations/",-1
Sunshine,nasaan si ari-yuh-nuh?!,-1
Sunshine,"What I like about Sunshine is this film fully embraced Antoinette Jadaone's artistry as a filmmaker, similar to her magnum opus ""Fan Girl"".The luscious colors and shades at the backdrop of a failing city. The grounded surrealism. And Jadaone's honesty in what she wanted to convey in the film. Much like her previous romance films Alone/Together and Never Not Love You, this film grappled with social and economic uncertainty but this time it highlighted Maris Racal's character's struggle to love her passion in gymnastics. It's no surprise Racal acted the hell out of her role, but my flowers are for Jennica Garcia who encapsulated the ghost of Sunshine's what-could-have-been. Sunshine further proves Jadaone is in her prime, and there's so much more she can make in the next years.",-1

Sunshine,"marami akong nakikitang western reviews calling this so-so. if titingnan mo nga from their pov, oo nga? ano bang bago dito, it's literally about a high school student getting an abortion to focus on her olympian gymnast dreams. but this is where context matters. films like sunshine are so important as a conversation-starter in countries like the philippines where abortion and reproductive health is deemed not as important by a male-dominated government and a religious culture. ang dami pa ring pro-life kaya sobrang hirap para sa mga kababaihan tulad ni sunshine at mary grace magkaroon ng access sa safe ways for abortion. sobrang nakakadala makita sila na irisk ang buhay nila para magpatuloy pa mabuhay. mahirap magbuntis pero di hamak na mas mahirap magpa-abort.at lalo itong pinapahirap ng isang patriyarkal na lipunan, katulad ng doktor na unang nilapitan ni sunshine para tulungan si mary grace. tumatak siya sakin kasi siya ang salamin ng mga kalalakihan sa ating legislation chambers na walang pakialam sa karapatan ng mga kababaihan at galit na galit sa mga plataporma na nagsusulong ng kanilang welfare. isa pa yang si miggy at ang tatay niya. mga barumbado. kaya oo, importante ang paggawa at pagpapalabas ng mga pelikula tulad ng sunshine. nagulat nga ako pinondohan to ng fdcp? at pinayagan ilabas sa maraming sinehan. sana marami pang mamulat sa importansya ng pagbibigay ng choice sa mga kababaihan. choice mabuhay, at hindi lang bilang tagadala ng buhay.",-1
Sunshine,"Late diary entry. It really is true that employment screws the cinephile in us. This is Jadaone's Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) mixed with the magical realism of Jojo Rabbit (2020), and Brocka's depiction of Maynila as a harsh, predatory city that traps and exploits the marginalized. There's a night scene that was basically taken from a Brocka handbook, framing, camera movements, dialogue. I love Jadaone's growth as a filmmaker and this project shows how she matured in multiple filmic aspects, but more so on the commendable screenplay. The conversations felt realistic– something a Gen-Z would say in the present context. There's a clever and subtle critiquing done by adding the English-speaking scenes as well. As if they poke fun at the other contradictions in our postcolonial, patriarchal society now.Multiple ironies and contradictions lie in this film—the titular character's name doesn't coincide with her lived experiences, the vendor selling the religious images of Nazareno and Sto Niño also sells the abortion pills, how the people who claim to care for us are so quick to judge if situations do not align with their perspective or morality. Sunshine to me was a thought-provoking way of presenting a very evident issue in our Philippine society, and Jadaone made it brutally honest without lacking the compassion and clarity to bring about this story.I love how hopeful the ending was tbh. I know that this country has been so steeped in religious conservatism that even acknowledging how hopeful that ending was would raise flak—but this movie has done a great deal to create awareness and productive discussions on unwanted pregnancies. Sunshine was a confrontation of our modern maladies, something that very clearly threatens the health and future of women. That's another contradiction in itself, having a government by the people, for the people and yet it chooses to ignore the evident crises of its people. I digress. Gets kita, Shine.

Sunshine,"throughout the film, the people surrounding sunshine kept telling her what to do with her pregnancy.abort it. keep it. do this and do that. we can have all these conversations about pro-life and pro-choice, of whether we agree with her actions or not and that’s fine and all. but that is not the point this film makes.regardless of what your thoughts on abortion are, this film forces you to meet sunshine where she’s at. to feel her pain, her struggle, her desperation, her hopes and dreams. this film tells you to look at her, understand her first. no one in this film except her sister and that kind doctor was able to do that. the people surrounding her were coursing plans of action for the future without actually asking her how she’s doing. it was painful to watch her go through challenge after challenge and yet no one really saw her.

Sunshine,ILY DIREK TONET,1
Sunshine,"My favorite part of the film is how Sunshine simply does not have any maternal figure in her life.Her mother is literally nowhere! Numerous characters try to act in this woman's place, but all fail in being the figure Sunshine needs.I believe this is why the coach remains a flat character for the entire duration of the plot. Even if she refers to Sunshine as ""anak,"" we never get to see her be a mother to her. The coach is at the center of the conflict, the one person who must never know that she's pregnant. Thus, Sunshine refuses to open up to her coach, refusing to be cared for knowing the consequences. When her coach hears rumors of her pregnancy, there is no comfort in her words when she confronts Sunshine. Instead, all the secretly pregnant teenager receives is a reminder of what is at stake, that she won't get to be on the team. This pushes Sunshine to go back for a stronger round 2 of the pamparegla.Not even Thea's mom can give comfort to the friend of her daughter. She literally does the opposite, ordering Thea to stay away from Sunshine. Even when Sunshine asks the motelkeeper for help, and they reluctantly do so. The elder women place her on a tricycle and leave her to bleed out as the tricycle rushes to the hospital.Then there's the doctor. Sunshine's sister perfectly criticizes her demeanor towards Sunshine. Her sister asks the doctor if she's a relative of theirs or possibly their mother because she's acting like one. Though this might seem like a counter, when you take into account how the doctor cares more about Sunshine apologizing to the Lord and thanking Him rather than Sunshine's well-being, the case falters. Also, her character felt more like a voice of how religion greatly affects the medical field and in turn, women's bodies.The same goes even for the case of Mary Grace, who has been impregnated by her own uncle. While her mother is alive, their relationship is complicated to say the least. Her mother enables the abusive relationship between the uncle and child for money, so that someone else can ""take care"" of Mary Grace, essentially removing herself from the role of being a mom.I think all this is why her sister is highlighted as a light in her life. She is the closest thing to being a mother in Sunshine's life, caring about her health, whether she goes to school or not, and so on. However, they are sisters at heart. They can only hold each other's hands through life. Her sister does not order her what to do with the baby, instead defends her from the doctor, pays for the bill, and gets her home. They are sisters through and through.",20

Sunshine,alam ko na ayaw niyang maging ina pero SHE MOTHERED.maraming cases katulad ni Sunshine na galing sa hirap tapos magkakaroon ng once in a lifetime opportunity pero laging nahaharangan ng mga responsibilidad dahil sa mahirap na access sa reproductive health. sana magkaroon ng safe abortion laws. if the unborn child can be the next president so hindi ba pwede yung nanay ung maging presidente???!! GO SUNSHINE ILABAN MO!Galing ni Maris and Jennica Garcia. Also the cinematography is CHEF’S KISS! Perfect!,4
Sunshine,lots of amazing thoughts to take away from the movie i’m rooting for you sunshine and mary grace.,-1

Sunshine,"sm taytay cinema 3 with bossing (xyriel manabat taytay represent! Haha) I cried three times because (in no particular order) 1) it reminded me of how I winced as I read a paper by my Soc Sci 1 prof that contained anonymous abortion testimonies of women During the pandemic who had to contend with the Difficulties of living in the Philippines (siksikan mga transpo, scant financials), on top of how abortion is illegal and taboo, on top of the Difficulties…",13

Sunshine,"""Sana magets mo""quite a sight in ph cinema to see a young woman not villainized for making choices that may not have been the best for her, but portrayed as a victim of a system that endangers her by significantly limiting her options.",30
Sunshine,"“gets ko na.” those were my exact words standing up from that cinema chair. and honestly, i still don’t get how so many people didn’t get it. this film blew my mind and cracked my heart and opened my mind at the same time. it dares to touch what most won’t even glance at, what they label as immoral, illegal, taboo. but it does so with so much clarity, care, and courage. this isn’t just a film, it’s a mirror of the trials of femininity and womanhood. napakagaling mo, direk antoinette jadaone. and flowers for you, my sunshine, maris racal.",30
Sunshine,"tangina 2 days akong bumalik sa sinehan para mapanuod 'tong film na 'to 'cause i know that it is something and indeed, it was. this film is real and made me reflect on how still the world treats women.this film truly shows how it is so hard to be a woman in this country wherein you cannot decide about your own body and life because people will always have something to say about you. i hope it's an eye opener to everyone of us that if women wants an abortion, we shouldn't judge them right away, instead, we should take a pause and learn to understand that each and everyone of them has their own reason on why it ended that way. to all the Sunshine out there, if there's a chance that you can choose yourself, please do so.",-1
Sunshine,"there is something so enigmatic about the second night sequence of sunshine. not only is this the deciding night for her, but it’s also the night where everything comes together: a night to finally reclaim her agency, an answer to her worry, and the contradictions in between spaces—the institutions that reinstate the cisheteropatriarchal system and the city that allows everything against all odds.sunshine, sa ‘yo ang mundo at ang kayhabang gabi, habangbuhay.",17

Sunshine,"""men will never understand/feel emotions the way women do“what do you mean minorities can't buy a pregnancy test without an ID? Philippines is wayy behind with this kind of conversation, being brushed off easily, especially when it matters the most.Grief here isn’t a dramatic monologue; it’s a quiet dinner, an unanswered message of being alone and suffering. A literal MANCHILD was portrayed, showing the father being petty and emotionally unavailable when it comes to taking responsibility for the mistake he made.people are not ready to see and face the truth that this film delivered.in the end, it really depends on the people to say “gets ko na”.",11
Sunshine,"Siguro nga’t kailangan lang din naman talaga nating ilagay ang ating sarili sa kanilang mga paa sa para maintindihan ang daing ng bawat isa. Si Sunshine ay isang perspektibong pilit paring tinatalikuran ng nakararami. Hindi sa lahat ng bagay kaya ng mga babaeng lunorin ang mga ingay. Maski ang bata’y kayang intindihin na tao lang din si Sunshine, at kahit babae siya; dapat at karapat-dapat siyang magkaroon ng karapatang mamili.",3
Sunshine,"Mahal na mahal kita, Sunshine. Literal na absolute cinema.",-1
Sunshine,"Manila is rich with history, and within its walls are cracks that harbors scandalous yet important narrative we are too ashamed to tell. And unfortunately, Sunshine, in essence, represents the face of this cruel fate — the very victim of society's refusal to address issues that are relevant yet alarming.And through the film's course, we see Quiapo as this undeniable haven of hypocrisy, a place of contradicting morals, the very product of poverty and its people trying to survive and make ends meet.Jadaone somehow manages to tap into the very surface of these stories rather creatively, without missing a beat and has a stark vision of what the film should be about. At times I feel like the film is a literal outcry for help. Every character here is a representation of that and is the result of what's wrong with the system in general. This paired with Racal's impressive performance strengthens the film's core message. Simply put, Jadaone's work is not a prententious flick that uses sensitive subject matter for mere views but rather an impactful affair that successfully champions itself as a vessel for awareness. Overall, the film is resonating with me, a powerful testament that the film transcends genders and in itself is a beautiful feat because it lets you see and viscerally feel Sunshine, and witness her journey to self-forgiveness and inner peace.",12

Sunshine,"While the cast delivered brave and committed performances, I personally found the overall story didn't hit me as hard as I hoped.It’s not due to a lack of relevance, on the contrary, the film captured the complexities and ironies of abortion culture in the Philippines with striking accuracy.I just wished the storytelling felt a bit tighter and more cohesive, so the impact matched the subject's weight given that it's a taboo subject in the PH context.",13

Kasi nakakulong sa isipang mali ang magpalaglag, mali dahil pumapatay ng inosenteng sanggol sa sinapupunan. Hindi naiisip ang sitwasyon ng ina, at ng magiging anak kung sakali mang ipanganak. Sinasawalang kakayahan na magdesisyon ang bawat babae para sakanilang katawan, kung ano ang gusto nila, kung ano ang satinging tama. Ipinakita rito na hindi madali ang desisyon. Ipinakita rin dito ang mga matitibay na rason para hindi ituloy ang panganganak— pangarap.Sana lahat ay ma-gets ang desisyon ni Sunshine, katulad ng pag-intindi ng bata sakanya... ""Gets ko na.""",3
Sunshine,"The entire time I was watching, I felt like I couldn't breathe. It's claustrophobic and suffocating, just like how Sunshine herself feels. You feel her world slowly closing in on her, invisible walls tightening around her in every frame. The camera doesn't let you breathe, and neither does the sound. Manila's noise is constant, overwhelming, and disorienting, especially for a gymnast who needs focus and silence to thrive. Sunshine is literally and figuratively trapped in tight spaces, cramped jeepneys, crowded streets, the overbearing sound of trains passing by, judgmental stares, and high expectations. Visually and sonically, it captures how isolating and terrifying it is to carry a burden like hers in a society that is less than kind toward women. (Btw, just to put it out there, the cinematography and colors in this film are GORGEOUS.) In almost every film that tackles women's issues in the Philippines, you'll find this line repeated in many reviews here in Letterboxd: ""Ang hirap maging babae. At lalong mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas."" It's because it's true. Every day, women here continue to fight for autonomy, for safety, for the right to choose themselves. We live in a deeply patriarchal and religious society that expects women to always put others first—especially family, be it their parents, siblings, or children—and shames them whenever something bad happens to them as if they brought it upon themselves. Society never asks the men who take advantage of women simply existing to change, rather it expects women to quietly endure. Bakit kailangang babae ang palaging mag-adjust? I appreciated how the film showed moments of solidarity between women, but it's sad how that's not always the case in real life.Exceptional performances from the entire cast, especially Maris Racal, who is tremendous in the titular role. From the start, she's completely convincing as an elite athlete and future Olympian: disciplined, focused, and has no room for error, as both her dreams and the dreams of others rest heavily on her shoulders. But it's in moments where Sunshine wrestles with fear, guilt, and inner conflict that Maris truly shines. She captures and presents the character's vulnerability so well. Also, as someone who always adored Jennica Garcia since her GMA days, I absolutely loved watching her quiet and subtle acting as Sunshine's sister.I said in my first review of Fan Girl that I hoped Direk Tonet would make an even braver film, and she did. Sunshine focuses and dives deep into the themes it introduces and stands firm in its critique—something that I felt was somehow lacking in Fan Girl. While some moments didn't always work for me and the magical realism elements sometimes took me out, I understand the choice. Part of me wishes it stayed more grounded and direct, but the “Gets ko na” scene near the end hit so hard that I stopped minding altogether. It's a great, important film and I hope it helps open up more discourse on women's reproductive rights in the country.Go see it in cinemas when you can.  SM City North EDSA Cinema 6",-1
Sunshine,"Mag-isa kong pinanood sa sinehan. Mabigat ang pelikula, sensitibo, ngunit matapang at maingat nitong ipinakita ang iba’t-ibang reyalidad sa Pilipinas; it talked about important topics that are often regarded as taboo: teenage pregancy, broken healthcare system, domestic sexual harrassment, religious conservatism, and body autonomy.More than anything, pinaalala sakin nito na hindi pwedeng diktahan ng sinuman, mas lalo na ng kalalakihan, ang katawan ng babae.",3

Sunshine,"The cinematography is on top! And also the camera angles. The motel scene gives me goosebumps, the struggles and danger that a woman could experience is too much to bear. To think that we are now in a very modern world this topic is still a taboo in our country. This film showed me the realistic perspective of abortion through the lens of a young woman fighting for her dreams. No woman should be forced to give birth and have child especially when they are not capable to sustain emotionally/financially and abused by someone. I am too stunned to speak after I finished it, I am just so happy that we can actually create this kind of film raw, and brave.",5
Sunshine,"what i love most about this movie is how it tackles different issues in this country, from teenage pregnancy and beyond, in a way that gradually builds and is tied together beautifully. this movie doesn’t aim to solve the problems, but it does broaden people’s perspectives on the real issues and real experiences of women in the philippines (even other filipinas themselves who aren’t aware of the details that go into teenage pregnancy!)",13

Sunshine,"After making waves at the Toronto Film Festival last year and winning a Crystal Bear at the Berlin Film Festival early this year, #SunshineMovie finally comes home to the Philippines. Starring Maris Racal in a powerful lead performance, the film follows Sunshine Francisco, a decorated gymnast whose Olympic dreams are threatened when she unexpectedly becomes pregnant. She must choose between her ambitions and the responsibilities suddenly placed on her — all while navigating a society that dictates what women should and shouldn’t do with their bodies.Directed by Antoinette Jadaone, the film doesn’t shy away from the hard questions — ones that should be answered by the Church, the government, the educational system, and most crucially, parents. Why is premarital sex and reproductive health still taboo in 2025? Why does society police women’s choices about their bodies? Why can’t we provide options for victims of abuse? These questions linger long after the credits roll.Maris Racal gives a career-defining performance — fragile yet defiant — as a young woman trying to stay strong while breaking under immense pressure. Aside from her acting, her gymnastics scenes are highly commendable, a testament to her dedication to the role. Jennica Garcia gives a quietly affecting turn as her older sister, shining in key emotional scenes. Child actor Annika Co, making her debut, is a revelation — a true scene-stealer with star potential. Former child star Rhed Bustamante will touch your heart & churn your stomach. Piolo Pascual also appears in a poignant special role. Manila, chaotic and contradictory, plays more than just a backdrop — it becomes an extension of Sunshine’s journey. From historic churches to narrow alleyways, she searches for clarity, strength, and hope, beautifully captured & lighted by ace cinematographer Pao Orendain.Sunshine is bold, relevant, and deeply moving. It’s a call to conversation, to empathy, and to change. Super highly recommended!!! Now showing exclusively at SM Cinemas nationwide — don’t miss it.",-1
Sunshine,"This movie is so satisfying to watch because it empathizes with its main character, sunshine, a young gymnast training for the olympics who happened to have an unwanted pregnancy. Young women like her are figures often shunned in popular philippine media and well, society so it’s refreshing to see someone like her in a sympathetic light. Abortion is such a taboo topic in this country so i very much appreciate the relentless uncovering of the different failures of the government and society with regards to women’s reproductive health and rights. Props to Maris for fearlessly embodying the role. Abortion is healthcare. It should be a choice accessible to anyone that wants it. It doesn’t have to be earned which is why I do find the imaginary kid representing sunshine’s conscience or the possible “kid” she might bear in the future unnecessary and redundant in the face of all the other oppressive opinions surrounding her. If the goal was to voice her inner worries, it wasn’t needed, it was already felt and would’ve been better shown some other way. If the goal was to voice the external conservative audience’s thoughts, then it wasn’t needed as well because they’re already thinking it, the film should’ve been secure with putting its faith on Sunshine alone. She’s a woman and she has dreams and having a baby is not part of that. She has value still for just the fact of being a person. I guess it just rubbed me the wrong way. It’s a very beautiful film nonetheless, shining best in its moments of truth and courage.",-1
Sunshine,we need more films likes ds,-1
Sunshine,"I couldn’t stop crying at the end of the movie. It made me feel so many things. I laughed, I cried, but most of all, I got angry. The system here in the Philippines is broken. Abortion is heavily stigmatized, and this movie only shows a glimpse of what so many women go through in this country. Abortion is not murder. Women should have the right to make decisions for their own bodies if they have the capacity to do…",13

Isa pa, ang pelikulang ito at sapat na para maunawaan mo na dapat natin protektahan ang mga bata sa kanilang sarili, at mga bagay na nakapaligid sa kanila. Salamat direk tonet.",3
Sunshine,"""gets ko na""",18
Sunshine,Hindi ako ang target audience ng pelikulang ito dahil isa na akong pro-choice at feminist before I entered the cinema. Ang tunay na target audience nito ay ang mga conservative nating parents or mga kakilala. What I like about the movie is it doesn't convince its audience to be pro-abortion but it wants them to sympathize with Sunshine and all the Sunshines and Mary Grace in this world.,5
Sunshine,"this is such an important piece of art—for women, from women, as women—especially in the context of the reality of being a filipina living in the philippines. the whole runtime genuinely felt like i was watching a piece of philippine cinema history unfold. i’ve never been so emotionally compelled, invested, and moved over a piece of (ph) film (for quite some time now). this is what real cinema should be. the weight and power it bears in emphasizing the ills of society, directing empathy, progressing toward solutions.from the opening sequence of the routine, the editing and cinematography of this movie shines. quickly pacing up to the story’s compelling conflict, maris’ gripping performance hooks you into a spiraling anxiety. that immediate catholic guilt was just perfect in its timing and execution, you can’t help but greatly appreciate how well thought-out this specifically was. as she walks through the streets of metro manila aimlessly and frantically all throughout in different parts of the story, it mirrors a striking resemblance of a guarded uneasiness that we women all fear that something bad might happen to us in the streets; it’s a fight for our lives everyday. it’s also so bold of a creative decision to figuratively humanize the unborn that at first, suspiciously could have gone wrong in one mishandling of the story but eventually paid off in working favorably by ticking the (filipinos’) tendency for sentimentality—especially with an even darker subplot. the casual inhumane reality the common filipino endures.only by memory, my only issue with the whole cinematic experience is that piolo pascual as a character actor is too damn iconic and too damn handsome that there was literally a collective gasp in the theater when he came out on that one scene. di mapugngan ang kilig sa mga tao and were taken aback and away from the story with his perfect sir marco lewk. yes, my only complaint in the whole film is that gwapo ra kay ka SIR piolo pascual. this is balanced by how good of a casting choice miggy is—unrecognizable character actor (complimentary), looks like your typical spoiled teen with a face people can easily hate (complimentary), with his acting adequately matching up to his scene partners.pretty sure it was by choice that all the men are the direct a(holes)ntagonists of this story. fuck the patriarchy. fuck the system. in contrast, the relationship with the women around her significantly holds her. to nurture and to care for one another. it’s the gentlest part. knowing you’re never alone in the struggle.who knew a simple routine could bring so much emotion to a crowd. a fitting ending that serves justice to the character and story.stellar performances. cinematography, editing, and scoring is divine. thank god this is one of those filipino films paced intentionally. the writing coupled with its humorous takes in such a bleak setting was done so tastefully and appropriately that it never felt out of place. optimistic for the progressive turnout of the story’s message to the general public. art shapes culture, culture shapes people, and people shape the world. please papa god let this work in our country’s favor.i’ve only just seen this once and would love to see this a couple of times more in appreciation of the mastery of craftsmanship everyone involved in this production. as i always believe that movies can save lives, and can change lives. it’s one of those pieces that makes you hopeful of what great cinema (and future) lies ahead for our country.p.s.lahi ra sad gyud ang igo sa clear reflection of a society you currently live in",-1
Sunshine,I LOVE U MARIS RACAL THEY WILL NEVER MAKE ME HATE U#nilokonirico #whoevenisricoblanco,2
Sunshine,"Ang iniluha ko naman talaga kasi sobrang bigat sa puso knowing how raw and authentic this has been, especially with the fact that a lot of women, even girls, actually experience this, na this just goes way beyond the screen but is a sad reality of some.Being a woman will always be both a blessing and a curse, most likely when it comes to fertility, because often it will always be tied down to a woman's worth. Being a mom takes a lot of courage, for it requires a lot of sacrifices, dedicating your whole life to a child you've conceived for 9 months. It makes you appreciate motherhood and admire the women who dream to be a mother who is capable of giving unconditional love and a good life in a sense na they are willing to do everything for their child... But the truth is not everyone wants to be a mother, and society must learn to respect this kasi it is genuinely for the betterment of everyone, most likely for the child itself. Kasi being a mom is such a huge responsibility that most aren't even ready for, and a lot of other factors, such as teenage and unwanted pregnancy and being a victim of sexual abuse, contribute to the decision of termination of the child. People often tend to overlook it and deem it as something so negative, but what they fail to see is how this decision will always come from the place of love and care for themselves as well as the baby kasi genuinely I think it is more cruel to continue things you don't even want in the first place 'cause both the child and the parent would only suffer physically, emotionally, and psychologically. Also, I hate how women are expected to sacrifice their own dreams, aspirations, and life itself like it's so unfair how men could easily get away with anything, while the the women will be the ones to suffer, be condemned, and be villainized for things that they both did naman. Kaya sex education shouldn't really be a taboo topic, especially safe sex kasi it would really be a huge help in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Aside from it, grabe ang ganda ng cinematography ng film and sobrang galing ng mga gumanap kasi isinabuhay talaga nila 'yung characters nila to the point na 'you wouldn't even think na this is acting kasi it feels so real. Ewan ko but I really loved the fact na they kept the background noises kasi it makes you feel like you are really there with them at that moment, tapos 'yung overall vibes na sobrang Filipino coded.",-1
Sunshine,"As a Jadaone fan who has watched every one of her films since Tadhana, I can definitely say that this is her best work to date. And of course, this is Maris Racal’s magnum opus in terms of acting. It’s her time to shine.",25
Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone <3 the director that you are. Sunshine and her other film Fan Girl proves that she has an eye for slightly underrated yet incredibly powerful actors and it proves that she is able shed light onto themes that are dark, taboo and real. I love seeing Maris Racal in roles like this and this was perfect! She’s talented, funny and v pretty The fantastical way the characters were introduced made me cringe a little bit, but it reminded me of college theatre days. It’s uniquely Filipino in a way that I can’t describe. There were a few rough edges here and there. At one point, I got worried whether or not this film was just overhyped, but the ending powered through to be a film with a lot of heart, yet gripping. Intense! Great work!",25
Sunshine,"Direktang naipahayag ni Direk Tonet sa pelikula ang problema at pangangailangan ng mga kababaihan gaya ni Sunshine. Ang pagbukas ng diskusyong aborsyon sa relihiyosong bansa kagaya natin ay napakatapang. Malinaw na naipakita sa pelikula kung bakit may mga pagkakataong kailangan ito. Hindi lang dahil ayaw ng babae ang magbuntis, kundi dahil unang una sa lahat, hindi niya ito ginusto. Hindi rin niya kaya o hindi siya handa. At malaki ang magiging epekto nito sa buhay at kalusugan ng isang babae.",3
Sunshine,"Sa wakas napanood ko na din ang Sunshine. Ang ganda ng pelikula at ng acting ni Maris dito, sana magkaroon pa ng ibang pelikula na nagttrigger sa topics na kadalasan ay considered as taboo sa bansa dahil taliwas ito sa nakalakihan na paniniwala ng ibang henerasyon. Hindi madali ang usapan na to pero KAILANGAN gawin dahil dumadami ang kabataan na nalalagay sa gantong sitwasyon. Wala man ako sa posisyon na sinapit ni Sunshine at Mary Grace, pero alam ko na sila dapat ay may CHOICE sa kapalaran nila dahil buhay at kinabukasan din nila ang nakataya.",3
Sunshine,"This film left me in awe after watching. A brave and bold take from Direk Antoinette Jadaone, Maris Racal graced us with her best performance yet. This film does not just tackle the taboo, it allows you to think otherwise— that there’s a world out there where options and autonomy matter, that speaking up and standing for what you want is ideal.This is a film that shows the world the great craftsmanship of Filipino filmmakers, and hopefully more people gets to see this wonderful work of art.",-1
Sunshine,"I waited to see this last year pa. Finally its here!!! Its like im watching a real story. Sadly, right here right now this is exactly what is happening to many women and little girls. Sunshine's last moments wth the little girl felt like a warm hug. I cried so much. I also really liked how they used real background noises of quiapo.

Sunshine,"Accidental pregnancy — are women in our country truly given a choice? Fear, dread, societal pressure, and the struggle for autonomy — Sunshine tells the story of a young woman full of dreams, now standing at a crossroads because of an unplanned teenage pregnancy.What is the right choice for her?Should she listen to the voices urging her to preserve a life she does not want, even at the cost of her dreams?Or should she listen to herself — to her ambitions, her desires, and her right to choose her own future?Motherhood or success?Why must women be forced to choose?PS: Solid ang mga child actors and the lingering scenes that would force you to feel the emotion of the character added so much to the experience.",4

Sunshine,"This movie might raise a lot of eyebrows here in a predominantly Catholic country like ours, and it might even stir a few uncomfortable conversations. But I think that’s why it matters. What resonates with me most as a woman is how Sunshine powerfully captures a young Filipina’s agency. Despite growing up in a harsh world, she refuses to let her circumstances define her or dictate her future, thanks to the strength and support of the women around her.It speaks volumes about the kind of society we’ve built, the choices we’re forced to make, and how survival, especially for women like me, is not just a quiet resistance, but a brave act of believing in and shaping the future in our own terms.Still showing in SM cinemas nationwide.#SupportLocalFilms",20

Sunshine,giving a voice and half the narrative to unborn children rather than keeping the main focus to the women this is happening to barred me from connecting with this film like i wanted to. even the “gets ko na” part felt like settling because from the very start her being unprepared or not wanting to be a mother shouldve been enough. i will concede though the justification for the subject treatment is that we live in a very conservative country and this may hopefully sway people to be more considerate but i was hoping for more. i hope for more films to come emboldened by sunshine’s example.,5

Sunshine,"We’ve always known that the custom of films is that they should be written from the heart,but with ‘Sunshine,’ the beating organ was not a place, it had gained limbs, put on a leotard, then graced the stage itself—that heart is Maris. The film mirrors how a good-for-nothing man only reaps a fleeting pleasure from an intercourse while pain is all that is left of and might be rooted in a woman forever and how a female that chooses and decides for her own body are condemned by her very own sex. I also appreciate how film celebrates the innate wisdom of children :’))Tribulations don’t kindly pick a certain period in our lives, we will be found unarmed in them any time. It is also vague how long its adversities will delay our dreams—but what is sure is that they can never end them. I encourage everyone to see ‘Sunshine.’ It is undebatable that we expose ourselves to brutally honest discourses about womanhood, safe sex, and reproductive health in the Philippines, dahil sa pagmamalasakit nag-uumpisa ang ating laban na mabuo ang isang mapagpalaya at ligtas na mundo para sa kababaihan—para sa lahat ",-1
Sunshine,"Everything in and about this film is ON POINT. Honestly comes as no surprise given the process and heart poured into this by Direk Antoinette Jadaone and Maris Racal :"") Wala na ako nasabi pag labas ng sinehan kundi ""on point. sobrang on point ng lahat.""pwede magbrain fart na lang??? ang dami ko gusto sabihin, next time na iconstruct nang maayos :)lagi't lagi kong sinasabi na kakaiba talaga ang naratibong taglay at buhat ng isang atleta. at kapag ginagamit ito sa isang pelikula bilang daluyan ng mensahe at aral, mas lalo itong gumaganda at lumalalim. hindi sa inuundermine ko ang storya at halaga ng mga hindi atletang karakter... sadyang mas marami ang at stake para sa mga atleta natin, all the more para kay Sunshine na aspiring Olympian. kaya sa pelikulang ito, hindi ko mapigilang hindi hawakan at damdamin ang puso ko sa sakit—hindi lang dahil sa malupit na sistema o sa kabagsikan ng relihiyon o sa mga storya ng kababaihang binigyang-buhay ng kwento, kundi para sa mga pangarap ni Sunshine na nadedehado. mga pangarap na maski buhay niya, handa siyang ilagay sa panganib. napakahusay ng pelikulang ito. maris racal... grabe ka na. walang ibang makakagawa ng ginawa niya kundi siya lamang. she really drew me in as Sunshine. si annika co ibang klase rin! kuhang-kuha niya yung innocence ng isang bata, kasabay ng subtleties ni Sunshine at ng mundong ginagalawan nila. si direk... syempre magnus opus. all my praises go to the cast and everyone behind this film. mula pagestablish ng setting, pagdepict sa gulo, sulasok, at sikip ng paligid ni Sunshine, yung mga eksena sa kalsada, sa palengke, sa jeep, at ultimately juxtaposition ng Quiapo??? ang lala. on point yet again. not to mention yung pagutilize ng sounds? on point na naman. dialogue? you bet it's perfect. last ko na siguro 'to pero gusto ko pasalamatan 'tong film na 'to. gusto ko pasalamatan si Sunshine. ang tingkad at importante ng diskursong dala ng pelikulang ito. tila isang diskursong matagal ng nilalaban ngunit ipinapasawalang-bahala lamang. isang diskursong pinapatatag ang katayuan ng kababaihan sa sistema at lipunan natin sa Pilipinas. isang diskursong taliwas sa nakasanayang asal at relihiyosong prinsipyo nating mga pilipino. pero again, isang diskursong napakahalaga at kinakailangan. thank you, Sunshine, kasi sobrang tapang mo shet ka. bago ka pa man maintindihan ng nakararami, gets na kita. gets na kita agad. gets ka namin :"") <3",6

Sunshine,"Watching it with my brother and my grandmother was really interesting for me because I knew all three of us had different knowledge and takes when it comes to pro-choice and pro-life concepts. We had different perspectives about the topics discussed in Sunshine, which is exactly what makes the movie relevant. And why so many people need to watch it. Every detail and line seemed to be carefully crafted. Every scene had an important message. From men failing to take accountability and leaving all the burden on the woman, the religious and conservative opinions, the reality of the healthcare system, to the harsh truth that criminalizing abortion does more harm than good. Annika Co's role was such an amazing addition to the entire story. Without her, I feel like it would be incomplete. She was a representation of a young girl's heart. I would say I felt like the ending was lacking in impact and power, hence my rating. I feel like there could have been more to show Sunshine's decision and outcome. But regardless, it was a beautifully crafted movie worth the hype and support!",-1

Sunshine,"babae at isang agham ang puso ng pelikula. sa maynila: kung saan masikip, mabaho, hindi makakilos ng maayos, at maraming mga tao ang huhusga sa iyo. the movie shows how women even in this modern society, still carry the burden of the spectrum. we, women, are expected to act like it. na laging piliin ang practical at hindi bigyang pansin ang pangarap. “mahirap maging babae, mas lalo na sa Pilipinas.” Sunshine confronts these social issues. the patriarchal conflicts of societal and religious issues. Maris Racal, carries her character with potential and determination. Ang daloy ng mensahe ng pelikula ay nararapat mapag-usapan. sana sa darating na panahon, people will choose to ignore the religious beliefs of the system- sana makabuo tayo ng empathetic, understanding, and compassionate individuals. kudos!",-1

Ang dali kasi natin sisihin yung bata na di ginusto ang naging outcome, madalas, ano mang galing nila sa ibang bagay, kapag nabuntis sila, automatic, ang tanga na nila pero di natin lagi iniisip na ang naging outcome ng problema ay galing sa negligence mismo ng nagpapatakbo ng sistema. this film is important kasi dito pinakita yung rason kung gaano kabigat yung kahalaghan to have access to safe and legal abortion for women and in a developing country. hindi sinubo sayo pelikula, hahayaan ka niyang i-digest yung mga nangyayari on your own pace, hahayaan ka niyang intindihin, magkaroon ng opinyon, sumalungat, mag-agree, at higit sa lahat, after mo panoorin to, baka sakaling alam mo na ang gagawin kung may makikilala kang sunshine sa totoong buhay.kasabay ng ingay at bilis ng buhay sa maynila ay ang maaring bilang ng babaeng nalalagay sa alanganin ang buhay dahil wala pa ring access sa ligtas na abortion.Boses ng babae at kabataan yung asa pelikula, ang tagal na neto, bakit ba ang bagal nating ma-gets? skl,,, favorite scenes ko ay yung motel scene yung may lrt, yung nagppractice si sunshine bago yung competition yung may malalim siyang hinga, at yung dinudugo siya habang asa tuktuk/tric na pati yung batang babae dinudugo.again, watch this film kasi makakahanap ka ng kakampi at mas maiintindihan mo ang mga bakit. ugh thanks direk tonet, maliwanag ang future ng ph cinemaaa!",6

Sunshine,"“The unborn” are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don’t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don’t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don’t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don’t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.– David Barnhart",-1

Sunshine,"napakahusay. sobrang hirap maging babae. yun lang ang natakbo sa isip ko as i watch sunshine (and the other women in this story) face the shame, guilt, and judgement of everyone around her. you are shameful, guilty, but at the same time you think to yourself that you deserve to live the life that you want. and you have to fight for that. as you fight for your own freedom, you can't help but look at those around you trying to do the same. just like sunshine, you look at mary grace with pity and do what you can. bata ka palang. not only were you stolen of your innocence but by your own flesh and blood. sobrang bigat sa pakiramdam kasi tunay to. nangyayari to. her story probably had the biggest impact on me.. this movie gives you the experience of what it feels like to be a woman. more so, a woman in the philippines. na walang maasahan kundi sarili niya. na basta tumutol ka sa sinasabi o paniniwala ng mas nakakatanda sayo, ipapahiya ka. wala kang ibang kakampi kundi kapwa babae mo. the women in this film are flawed but you feel the warmth and support they give each other. because that's all we have. i'm rarely moved by filipino movies but this hit hard... so beautifully written and executed. di ka babae lang, babae ka!!!!!!!!!!",-1

Sunshine,tanong niyo si bini jhoanna kung ano review niya EMEEEEE,0
Sunshine,"First of all, hands down to Maris Racal’s acting. She absolutely delivered.Sunshine powerfully reflects how difficult it is to be a young woman in the Philippines. The film highlights how this country has continuously failed and disregarded its women, trapped in an unprogressive system blinded by religion and outdated norms. It chooses not to see the real dangers and struggles they face every day.Our government should focus more on this long-standing issue because protecting women is not just necessary, it is crucial. Women are the only ones who hold the right to their own bodies, and we need to give them the full chance to live freely, safely, and with dignity.This film does not just tell a story. It demands awareness. It is a wake-up call.",-1

Sunshine,"sunshine is a film by Tonet Jadaone. context is very important because if you have seen jadaone’s films (That Thing Called Tadhana, Fangirl, Alone Together among others) then you will know this is HER film. you feel it in every frame. the writing. the direction & performances. there’s no voyeurism here. no moralizing. just truth. honest, specific, sometimes messy truth about what it’s like to be a woman in this country. not in the headlines, not in theory, but in the streets, in health centers, in quiet conversations with friends who are too afraid to say what they really need.maris racal delivers the performance of her life. she holds back when she needs to. she breaks in silence. she carries every scene with restraint, sensitivity & precision. she becomes sunshine. and it’s the kind of performance that demands to be remembered.the ensemble is just as grounded. jennica garcia, thea, the kid: each one brings something real to the table. nothing is forced. they don’t play characters. they play people you’ve probably met. maybe they remind you of someone you know. maybe they remind you of you.what makes sunshine work is not the acting or the direction but the refusal to look away. the film doesnt hide behind a metaphor. it gives us a manila that feels exactly like the one we move through. where pamparegla is sold outside churches. where motels won’t let you in if you’re alone. where grieving teenagers are all around but they have kept it in because no one has dared say “you’re safe here.” from my POV, the film takes a narrative risk. there’s a device that briefly pulls you out of the realism it builds so well. but it sticks the landing. because what matters is that you never stop feeling for these women. and that you leave the theater asking why stories like theirs still feel unsafe to tell.i’ve had my own sunshines, close friends, a relative, a classmate. women who needed care, not judgment. watching this film felt like watching them again. and all i could think was, “please, let her be safe.”this film deserves a seat in our national conversations. not just in cinema panels, but in health committees, in policy rooms, in the offices of people who still think there is a valid excuse to deny access to care.one of the most necessary films of the year.",17

Maris Racal gives a raw, powerful performance as Sunshine, a young gymnast whose dreams are at risk, leading her to desperate, illegal options. The movie smartly uses Quiapo's setting, showing its mix of strong religious faith and hidden illicit acts, highlighting the difficult truth about women's reproductive freedom and how religion and judgment impact their lives. It's an honest look at a situation often ignored, pushing viewers to understand the hard choices women face when personal control over their bodies conflicts with strong beliefs",-1

Sunshine,so many thoughts abt this movie• the most important thing abt this movie is the way it sparks conversations abt womens reproductive rights in the ph. bahalag langas akong katupad sa sinehan idgaf i literally witnessed a character development arc bruh• this probably happened bc daghan ug angles sa abortion in the ph ang pinakita. women as a community n all... even with the constraints of ph society they try to help... thats so• i probably did the wojak face everytime i recognized a manila scenery / diva actress like woagggg... thats quiapo... thats rhed bustamante• bwiset ung doctor n pakialamera (n it happens irl too) like ouhhhh the state of PH healthcare?• i kinda did not vibe with the bata plot device but tbh i also would not know how to make it better so.• GETS KO NA... ang hype. its gewd i crode,-1

Andami ring elements and technicalities na gusto kong irave about. Ngunit hindi na para ispoil HAHAHA. Sana nalang ay marami pang makapanood at mas lalo pang mapagusapan ang pelikula mismo, at ang mga isyung tinatalakay nito lalo na about women's reproductive rights. Bukod pa sa pagsalamin sa umiiral na isyung panlipunan, ultimately, kwento ito ni Sunshine. Si Sunshine ang may hawak at kontrol sa kaniyang kwento, naratibo, karanasan, at katawan. Si Sunshine ang magdedesisyon.At panghuli na gusto ko lang din sabihin,Sunshine for your consideration!",3
Sunshine,"this one hit omg here r my thoughts - jadaone just gave us a visual storytelling masterclass brah. The amount of meaning etched into every single frame was so tastefully done and was especially satisfying to watch as a young filipina- they could never make me hate you maris racal omg what a star  sobrang halimaw umarte taena!- i felt like that gif of leonardo dicaprio pointing at the screen whenever i recognized a filming loc LMAOAOOA like omg thats morayta?- i really loved the subliminal messages scattered throughout the film.. all the little moments when you see mothers who clearly did not want to be mothers, the moments when you see children who were born into families unplanned, the moments when the male characters refused to provide assistance when needed.. they made up such little parts of the plot but they added so much volume to the message- i also really liked the choice of making the aborted children their own characters in the story. it may be a double-edged sword kind of thing but i think addressing the ""buhay pa rin yan!"" argument by giving the kids their own autonomy and still concluding that despite fear, they truly just want the best for their mothers was just spot onnn- lowk felt too short LOL like feel ko there was potential for more.. pero the film is enjoyable as it is- somebody else said this already but this was one of those social commentary films that critique today's society simply by showing a woman living a regular week in her life. Like this is the reality of thousands of filipino women. The reason this hit so hard for me and for my sister and all the young filipino women in the cinema with us was because sunshine could easily be usi'm really glad this received critical acclaim because its narratives like these that filipinos need to hear. surviving in the conservative catholic philippines as a woman is nawt for the weak  and its about time that progressive, proudly pro-choice films like sunshine make it big",6

Sunshine,"“Sorry. Gagawin ko ang lahat. Babawi ako, Lord, basta alisin mo lang ‘to.” not a verbatim quote, but i remember the part where sunshine went outside the church to apologize. oh god, that part really, really struck me. as someone who is religious yet pro-abortion, and open to beliefs and choices that the catholic church doesn't traditionally approve of, i often carry a persistent guilt. but, like sunshine, if something doesn't feel right for me, i won't force it.responsibility is a choice. it has always been a choice.and if i or someone choose not to take on certain burdens, i trust that He is compassionate enough to understand. i will always stand with the pro-choice movement, cause no one should be denied the right to make deeply personal decisions about their own body and future.after watching the movie, yes, MAS na-gets ko na. at mas iintindihin ko pa. :) five stars!",28

Sunshine,"alam niyo yung feeling na pagkatapos manood ng pelikula tungkol sa struggles ng modern women, o ng kababaihan in general, parang may nagaalab na galit sa loob mo? ganon na ganon ako. tipong hindi lang galit na umiiyak sa tahimik, kundi galit na kumakabog, galit na gusto mong isigaw, gusto mong may baguhin.galit ako sa sistema. galit ako sa kung paano itrato ang mga babae — na parang katawan lang, na parang obligasyon nilang tiisin, magparaya, manahimik. galit ako sa mga bulok na paniniwala na tinuro sa atin at patuloy pa ring pinaniniwalaan. galit ako sa tradisyon na sinasanto kahit matagal nang nakakasakit. galit ako sa mga mata na mapanghusga, sa mga bibig na laging may masasabi pag babae ang gumagalaw. galit ako sa mundo nyeta!pero itong galit na 'to, hindi to galit na mauupos lang. hindi to galit na lilipas pagkauwi. ito yung klase ng galit na may pinaghuhugutan — may direksyon, may laman, may pagmamahal. galit na gustong ipaglaban ang kapwa. galit na may layuning itama ang mali. ganito yung pinaramdam sakin ni direk tonet ngayon. ramdam mo na hindi lang siya nagdidirect eh. nagsisisigaw siya sa pamamagitan ng pelikula. pero sa halip na sumakit ang tenga mo, sa puso siya tumatama.at si maris, grabe. ibang klase, walang duda. sobrang galing niya mag-embody ng role, ang effortless pero ang lalim. habang pinapanood ko siya, hindi ko na siya nakita bilang artista eh. she felt like someone i knew. a friend. a neighbor. a stranger na napadaan pero dala ang bigat ng buong mundo sa katawan niya. dama mo sa kanya yung lapot, yung pagod, yung hagard, pero higit sa lahat — yung dignidad. yung tahimik pero matapang na dignidad.at ang mas masakit, 21st century na, pero kailan ba talaga matatapos ang pag-ccrucify sa mga babae? bakit pag babae ang may choice — sa katawan niya, sa sex, sa pagiging ina — bigla tayong nagiging moral police? gets ko, some people will say, ""eh pinili niya makipag-sex."" oo, pero bakit sa panahong ito, ang pagbili ng condom, ang pag-access sa contraception, ang simpleng pagtanong tungkol sa pts, ay parang kasalanan? bakit parang kahit anong piliin ng babae, mali pa rin?at sa kaso ni red, bakit parang hindi pa rin siya pinapayagang mamili kung anong gagawin niya sa sarili niyang katawan? bakit parang laging may kapalit, laging may parusa, laging may kapwa babae pa nga na una sa paghusga?ang ironic, diba? ang daming takot sa sex education, sa reproductive rights, pero hindi takot manghusga. the more we condemn, the more we isolate women. at kapag nagiisa na sila, dun nagsisimula ang desperation — dun sila mapipilitang hanapin ang mga opsyon na mas delikado, mas tahimik, mas mapanganib.sana makita ng mga tao na hindi lahat ng babae na nabubuntis ay handang maging ina. hindi lahat ng katawan ay handang magdala. hindi lahat ng buhay ay handang isuko ang sariling pangarap para lang maging ina. at hindi ito dahil masama silang tao — kundi dahil may sarili silang timeline.sana yung mga taong galit na galit sa konsepto ng ""choice"" ay matutong makinig. choice is not evil. choice is freedom. and freedom is humanity.sana maging wake-up call itong pelikula na ang kababaihan ay hindi lang tagapagdala ng buhay — may mga buhay din silang gustong buuin para sa sarili nila. at kung alam nila sa puso nila na hindi pa sila handa, hindi natin sila dapat pilitin. hindi natin sila dapat husgahan. hindi natin sila dapat ipako sa krus.punyeta talaga ang sistema, pero hindi ibig sabihin wala na tayong magagawa.",3

Sunshine,"parang ang tagal na noong huli akong nanood sa sinehan na maraming tao, puno pa. went to watch this with my friends expecting na kaunti lang kami since nasa outside metro manila kami, pero hindi… puno siya. nakita pa namin yung iba naming friends pero ‘di sila nakaabot at sa next showing time na sila makakanood. medyo tmi siya but i just shared how jampacked the cinemas are for this film… and sobrang worth it niya. best film i have watched this year (minsan lang manood). no but seriously, what this film has ay mahirap pantayan. i love it na kahit na it has an obvious subject na tina-tackle eh hindi niya sinasampal sayo kung anong side yung dapat mong piliin. it even showed both sides of the issue.and the irony… OH MY GOD THE IRONY… mapa visual symbolisms o lines, ang daming irony. at sobrang nakakaappreciate yung magsisingit sila ng patama kahit one line lang, ang galing pa rin. from main characters, supporting, to cameos, importante silang lahat. ang ganda ng pasok ng mga subplots at kung paano siya na-connect sa main plot. tapos yung mga nangyayaring sa huli mo lang mage-gets… NAKAKA-MINDBLOWN FOR REAL. lalo na yung sa dulo… yung gotcha moment doon napaluha pa ‘ko. galing. so angas. amazing. extraordinary. life-changing. siguro kung may masasabi akong negative sa film na ‘to, siguro yung kapag nagtetext or chat si sunshine tapos di accurate yung tinatype niya doon sa lumalabas sa phone niya, hehe….",6

Napakagaling ng pelikula sa pagiging rason para mapag usapan ang mga usaping taboo kagaya ng aborsyon.Hindi man ako relihiyoso pero dama ko ang Catholic guilt na bumubulong, naglilinger sa kalooblooban ko. Pero bali-baliktarin man ang pelikula at realidad, ang katotohanan ni Sunshine ay katotohanan din ng maraming kababaihan sa bansa.Nawa’y mas mapag-usapan pa ang usapin ng reproductive health, at magkaroon ng ligtas at makataong paraan upang hindi masira ang kinabukasan ng kababaihan na nangangailangan ng tulong kasi hindi pa sila handa.",-1
Sunshine,"what a fucking experience it was. I was praying, begging na ma abort yung fetus istg, anyway this film so good and promising, everything is on point and relatable. Ang galing din ng scriptwriting hindi siya cringe and ang ganda ng chemistry ni jennica and maris.The movie shows the repercussions of illegal abortion and how it endangers women's life just because we do not have safe access to it, our country truly lacks knowledge on health reproduction and safe sex. I love how it didn’t shy away on exposing a doctor’s aversion with involvement because it threatens their license. Huhu pero ang daming na capture nitong movie about unwanted pregnancy and Sunshine’s dream just added depth to it.",5
Sunshine,"ang sunshine ay kwento ng libo-libong babae na nakikipagsapalaran sa patago at delikadong kalakaran ng quiapo, at ng iba pang lugar sa pilipinas. habang patuloy na tatangkilikin ng mga pilipino ang makitid na ideyang ang moralidad ay nahahati lang sa dalawa —mabuti o masama, itim o puti- dadami ng dadami ang mga babaeng ilalagay sa alanganin ang sarili maibalik lang ang kalayaan nilang piliin angsariling buhay.and no, hindi lang ito tungkol sa mental health. tungkol ito sa kawalan ng choices, sa pagiging biktima ng patriarkal na sistema, sa kawalan ng suporta sa mga atleta, sa paulit-ulit na pang-abuso sa kababaihan at pagtingin na sapat na maging nanay ka na lang. hindi dapat tinatapos sa mental health lang ang talakayan sa pelikula na to dahil may higit pa sa usapin na yon ang hain ni antoinette jadaone rito.at bago niyo sabihing isip muna bago buka, paano naman ang mga biktima ng rape? ang mga may problema sa pag-iisip na napagsamantalahan? ang mga batang ni hindi alam ang salitang ""puke"" o ""titi""natutuwa rin ako na bumabalik na ang mga temang ganito sa pelikulang pilipino. mula sa pagpapakita ng epekto ng blind fanaticism (fangirl,2019) hanggang sa kwento ng mga pdl (green bones, 2024) kitang kita na umay na umay na tayo sa kultura ng love teams at comedies na di naman nakakatawa.kung may oras at kakayahan kayo, sana panoorin niyo ang pelikula na to. at sana may maiwang bago paglabas niyo sa mga sinehan.",3
Sunshine,"Hindi tahimik ang Maynila, punong-puno ito ng mga ingay at usok. Dinig ang dumaraang tren, bulungan ng mga tao sa daan, kakaibang tugtugan sa tricycle, nakakasulasok na paligid, at marami pang iba. Mula Avenida hanggang Quiapo, ramdam ko ang nag-aalab na pangarap ni Sunshine. Pursigido. Desidido. Hindi siya nagpatinag sa ingay ng paligid. Mula umpisa hanggang dulo, buo ang kaniyang loob para sa kaniyang sarili at pangarap. Walang halong pag-aalinlangan. Mahusay ang pagkakahabi ng pelikula, mula cinematography hanggang linya ng mga karakter. Mahusay ang pagkakaarte. Madaling maunawaan. Hindi ko naramdaman na halos isang oras na ang nakalipas. Hindi nakababagot. Punong-puno ng pangarap at serye ng kawalan ng akses sa sektor ng pangkalusugan. Dinala tayo ni Sunshine sa kaniyang buhay at pangarap. Isa sa tumatak sa akin na eksena ay ang huling tagpo. Ginawa niya ang kaniyang stunts, nag-gymnastics siya, sumayaw nang walang pag-aalinlangan at pangamba. Sumabay sa indayog ng musika habang dinadama ang bawat hampas ng kaniyang ribbon. Doon pa lang, alam mo na. Tahimik ang eksena matapos ang pagsayaw, ang higpit ng yakap ay ramdam mo. Para bang ikaw ang niyayapos at pinapakalma nito. Salamat sa mahigpit na yakap. Sa malalim na aspekto, nakalulungkot isipin na hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa rin tanggap ang abortion sa ating bansa. Nakalulungkot isipin na nawawalan ng karapatan ang mga kababaihan na mamili— na piliin ang sarili at pangarap. Mapagmulat at mapagpalaya ang pelikula. Pinamulat sa atin ng bawat eksena ang isang isyung nangyayari sa ating bansa sa kasalukuyan. At pinalaya tayo ng pelikula mula sa tanikala ng tradisyunal na paniniwala at pananaw ng karamihan. Hindi maglalaon, unti-unti na rin matatanggap ng mga tao ang katotohan na bahagi ng ating karapatan ito bilang kababaihan. Sa huli, isa lang ang sigurado, nanaig ang kaniyang pangarap. Pinili niya ang kaniyang sarili ng walang halong pag-aalinlangan. Kaya para sa lahat ng Sunshine, nawa'y lagi ninyong piliin ang sarili at pangarap. Gaya ni Sunshine, ang pangarap niya ay pangarap ko rin. PS. Thanks sa crush ko, pinanood namin 'to together ^__^",3

Sunshine,"“the filipino women and the curse of catholic guilt” despite popular western belief where early stages of pregnancy are just lump of cells and does not count as a human being, this is where pro-choice comes in and protest women’s autonomy through the lens of science. in our nation this is not a strong argument as this doesn’t penetrate the teachings of the catholic/christian church where flesh is flesh and the act of aborting a lump of cells is murder. now this is where sunshine and the jojo rabbitesque kid brave depiction contradicts with the filipino pro-life argument “future president” and the what ifs of the future child, despite some view this representation as counter productive it actually stands for how much catholic guilt and patriarchal values is imbued from the moment we are born, that’s why no matter how we view ourselves as progressive, modern, and forward, the filipino women still struggle with their autonomy over their body and choices where they face at the mercy of unwanted consequences. that’s why i admire how brave “sunshine” depict the lump of cells as a hallucinatory unborn child where it grounds how filipino culture views it and turns it as a film creative force to show how women no matter the circumstance should have complete autonomy over their body, not in an overly liberal way where everything is muddled in the gray area but as an acceptance that we live in a society where women are still tied to patriarchal reproductive roles and system wherein we disguise feminist liberalism as matriarchal.with abortion still illegal in our country, teenage and unplanned pregnancy a national problem, and contraceptives a taboo subject. this is a film that offers understanding, empathy, and compassion to sunshines out there that are resorting to unsafe, life threatening, and “illegal” ways that society calls bad choices but what is “bad” when it is the only choice they have. lastly i cannot complete this write up without mentioning the lino brocka, i love how it shows manila as a character with its noise, chaos, and decay through the familiar seams of avenida and quiapo with its religious interplay of choice (accessibility to unsafe preganancy pills) and solace of a religious power it holds.maris racal stellar performance will forever hold her in the filipino cinema history as sunshine, as how nora aunor is bona, and hilda koronel is insiang.i really really hope more people watch this and be a strong catalyst of change for reproductive rights as it is core a healthcare and human rights.",-1
Sunshine,Ang dami kong iyak direk tonet ang galing mo!! Ibang iba to sa mga usually na ginagawa mo and ito ang pinaka gusto ko because it tackles our societal issues on women’s bodies and reproductive health. kaylangan tong mapanood ng mga tao!! I LOVE THIS FILM SO MUCH ,-1
Sunshine,"Promise, 'di siya overhype.We’re halfway through 2025 and far from its denouement but I must say that SUNSHINE, if not the best, is one of the best and one of the most important films of the year. I’m so sorry, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION FROM LILIA CUNTAPAY, but I believe I now have my new favorite Antoinette Jadaone’s work. They said during the promotion that this is the last day this will be shown here sa provinces and then starting tomorrow, sadly, it will only be shown to 3 cinemas na lang so I felt the substantial need to watch it tonight. Mind you, sobrang bigat pa rin ng pakiramdam ko, tapos na lahat, at ngayon na tina-type ko lahat ng to.Sunshine heavily tackled significantly sensitive issues here in the country - rape, teenage pregnancy, poor healthcare, and machismo. At habang ina-absorb ko lahat kanina inside the movie theatre, I couldn’t help but think about my two sisters who are the same age as the protagonist. Ang bigat. Ang lala. Ang hapdi. Give me a span of time to write an essay about this and I will take that challenge without a doubt. That’s how it affected me big time. It hits home.Now let’s talk about the performances. First sequence pa lang, it’s apparent that Maris Racal studied the role. Inakap niya at binigyan niya ng kaluluwa yung karakter. Hindi siya bumitaw hanggang final sequence. She had a lot of silent moments in the film and those were the most powerful. Nakakabingi yung katahimikan na halos hinahabol ko na rin yung hininga ko minsan. Jennica Garcia’s character, on the other hand, though it’s just a supporting role, is one of the main highlights throughout. Yung kahit minimal lang yung dialogues niya, tignan mo lang siya sa mga mata niya, maiintindihan mo sya. I love her here. She’s too authentic. May eksena silang dalawa ni Maris dito and that was when I lost it. Iyak ako eh. GRABE YUN. Grabe yun!!!!As for the direction, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, direk Tonet. Iba pa rin talaga kapag ang kwento ng babae ay gawa rin ng babae. Maselan, matapang, at may puso. Salamat sa buhay mo. Nag-uumapaw sa social realism ang pelikula mo. Lino Brocka would’ve been so proud!! Sunshine knows Manila and all its aches and decays. May problema ka? Okay, pero hindi titigil ang mundo. Hindi titigil ang buhay ng mga naka-paligid sa‘yo. Dagdag mo pa na nasa Maynila ka kung saan life is always on survival mode. The film captured those perfectly.Lastly, Sunshine doesn't preach or impose. She makes her decisions but doesn't force you to change your opinion either. Your role as an audience member is to listen. The rest is for you to reflect upon on your own.Gets ko na.",-1

Sunshine,72nd Watch Party w/ Sints,24
Sunshine,"a beautiful and important film :"")i spent most of it crying and whispering curses at the screen. matagal ko nang alam kung gaano kahirap maging babae sa pilipinas—but watching it unfold onscreen hits differently. ang hirap kasi lahat ng sakit, galit, at poot makikita mo. you’re forced to face the things we’ve been taught to bury, forget, or avoid.by the last ten minutes, i was inconsolable.ang hirap harapin ng katotohanan na whatever happened in the film—our reality is even worse. sunshine may be fictional, but her story is the story of all filipinas. it speaks the raw and painful truth about how limited our choices are.lahat tayo si sunshine.lahat tayo, kailangan pang ipaglaban ang karapatan natin sa sarili nating katawan.lahat tayo, pinalaki ng hiya at takot, forced upon us by society’s expectations.we’re all just trying to survive the cruelty of our country’s outdated norms and catholic guilt.as the credits rolled and the lights came on, i looked around at the people seated there with us. there were women my age, some younger, some older. there were men. there were lolos, lolas, nanays, tatays. so many different lives and experiences. and all i could think was: “sana lahat ng nandito gets na rin si sunshine.”and if they don’t yet, i hope they find it in their hearts to have empathy—for her, and for all the sunshines out there.i hope this film reaches more people. but more than that, i hope it urges those in power to finally take a closer look at the very real struggles filipinas face and make the long overdue changes we’ve been fighting for.",-1
Sunshine,"pinatunayan lang ng pelikulang ‘to na marami talagang gamit ang salitang “putangina”. putangina, ang galing. putangina, nakakagalit. putangina, gets na gets ko.putangina, sana magets na rin ng iba!!! criminalizing abortion doesn’t stop it from happening; it just fosters more unsafe methods and practices. ang panawagan ng taumbayan, legalize abortion now!",4
Sunshine,"I agree that Sunshine is a great film that every Filipino should watch. It tackles a big and debatable topic that many people would either agree or disagree on. This film helps people understand what abortion is and why we need sex education. Hands down, Direk Tonet! Sobrang galing ng pagkakagawa ng pelikula, hindi siya mahirap intindihin. Maris Racal, outstanding performance! You delivered excellent acting and truly gave life to the character of Sunshine.",12

Sunshine,"i just saw my irl Miggy share his review on this movie and fuck you, tangina mo!anyway-growing up mostly surrounded by women, this movie was riveting and relevant. pinanood ko to mag-isa sa mall guys nagulat ako may katabi ko pero wala akong pake, iyak ako nang iyak!!! naalala ko, i had a friend before who went through (not entirely the same) wanting to get rid of what’s inside her. she told me everything at the time and the only help i could offer her was to just listen to her and be there for her. she told me how painful it was and even though I wasn’t there physically, the movie depicted how painful it was and i felt it.i also remembered the time how shitty my irl Miggy was although we were never really together and it was only a scare, still, i felt the female rage through Sunshine- nakiki “tangina mo gago” rin ako sakanya kasi tangina talaga sa pakiramdam.at yung eksena nilang mag-ate, naisip ko kung paano din pinagdaanan ng nanay ko yung balita nung malaman niyang buntis siya sa akin. inisip ko na maswerte siyang may kapatid siyang babae, may kakampi siya. tinuloy din ng nanay ko ang pag-aabogasya habang dinadala ako at maswerte talaga siya. pero paano yung mga Sunshine na walang kakampi at hindi pa alam kung anong mga pangarap nila?yun lang naman gusto kong sabihin hahaha hindi man ito ang unang pelikulang nagrepresenta ng mga ganitong isyu o talakayan sa pelikulang pilipino pero sana mapanood ng karamihan para gets din nila sana.palaisipan din sakin kung ano ang nararamdaman o naiisip ng iba na wala sa minority pagkatapos mapanood to kasi bilang isang babae, grabe yung dating sakin ng pelikulang ito.salamat sa sumulat at sa lahat ng bumuo ng pelikulang ito!",-1

They can never make me hate you.",26

Sunshine,"this is peak progressive philippine cinema for me.its so needed. its so necessary. in this current state in the philippines, this film needs to be here. its always been here. but to be on a big screen all over philippines; yes. it should be here. filipinos needs to know this is happening in our country. i have so much to say about this film to the point it needs to be a discussion among people who actually gets this film. all i can say is thank you direk antoinette. thank you for all the people behind this film from technical to creative. this truly moved for me. these type of films are the reason why i genuinely love films and cinema.",9
Sunshine,***TW: SA***Long review ahead!!! Honestly having a difficult time writing down my reflections. First–it was so important to me that Sunshine got pregnant because of consensual premarital sex instead of rape. For years I have heard people say that the only valid reason for even considering abortion is if the pregnancy is a product of assault. This conservative mentality is harmful because it insinuates that women have a choice over our bodies only if it has been violated first.…,4
Sunshine,"Necessary film. An hour and a half of me feeling a phantom ache for the childhood fear I didn’t know I still had (as in literal, the hotel scene had my stomach churning). Refreshing conceit at first but found it muddling at times towards the end. Jumpscare sir ron, jumpscare that Sunshine’s house is two streets away from mine. This is the Manila I know.",-1
Sunshine,"The technicals was so clean as we want to call it “pulido”Love the sound design and the edit. Maris was so different in this film, she’s really a sunshine.The cinematography was so spot on.Antonette’s writing was so solid that I really feel like watching a 20 years old struggle with this. And I’m a little bit bitin and was looking for something that I don’t know because it didn't felt like an hour and forty+ minutes film. It was really a fast pace.",-1
Sunshine,"five stars— what bravery to present the reality of the struggles and to have done it very thoughtfully. hirap maging babae sa lipunan na to, crazy. -.5 cause i wish that little girl were likeable HAHAHA (Side note that does not affect how i view the film: personally thought it was interesting that there wasnt a definitive moment highlighting the moral dilemma about it, but i understand it was really about how the people around sunshine treated her…",-1
Sunshine,"“gets ko na.” — tears. almost immediately. a lot of issues were tackled so gracefully and with sensitivity in this film, whilst not necessarily favoring any particular side. the scene where sunshine asks for forgiveness at quiapo church, the same church where she was desperate to find abortion methods, shows how two conflicting views on abortion can be felt at once. also liked how it depicted the pressure of being an athlete, of maintaining your weight, and of the unrelenting need to train despite your life pretty much falling apart. if there’s anything i want to praise, it’s the way the film portrayed the role of women supporting one another, from the protagonist, her sister, her coach, the doctor, down to the innkeeper that rushed her to the hospital. the worst takes in this film were from men (no surprise there) who didn’t even bother asking sunshine how she felt (because in our incredibly conservative & patriarchal society, women are nothing more than their childbearing abilities lmao). ultimately, the only valid opinions on a woman’s body & whether or not she should undergo abortion should be hers & hers alone ! ! !",-1
Sunshine,"Top tier storytelling!!! Kada umiiyak si maris, umiiyak din ako Super dami kong thoughts and i love how the movie DID NOT disappoint!! We love movies that make a clear stand  I just wanna add na super dami kong emotions talaga na nafeel pero nagstand out yung galit, tangina, I js hate how easy it is for men and how women always have to be the one to suffer dahil sa mga gagoPs. I'll probably edit pag clearer na utak ko but for now, fuck men, I love women, I love love this film super ganda !!!",-1

Sunshine,"“Naiintindihan mo na ba ‘ko?”“Gets ko na.”i grew up in a somehow conservative and very religious household. i was taught by my elders that abortion is murder. period. full stop — that no reason could ever justify the taking of a “human life.”i never questioned this belief. until i grew up and learned about the social conditions that surround my imperfect — almost dysfunctional — family. dumating na sa punto na palagi ko nang tinatanong kung bakit nga ba pinili pa akong ipanganak ng nanay ko. tinawag ko ang sarili ko na isang kasalanan. isang aksidente, hindi sinasadya.eventually, i started to question my own views. my mother didn’t have a choice. but what if she did? what if her religion did not instill fear onto her — did not make her choose between her dream of living in the US and…me? what if she was given the right to make autonomous decisions for her own body and for herself?the importance of the sanctity of life has long been asserted in, what seems to be, an unending discussion on the controversial topic of abortion. these endless queries led me to enlightening myself to a greater picture of things. THAT criminalizing abortion is a NEGLECT to women’s rights. up until this day, women’s health and bodies have been continuously politicized by society. bago natin ituring na isang krimen ang abortion, we first need to view this on a sociopolitical lens. bakit nga ba maraming mga babae ang nagpapalaglag?what i loved about this film is how it portrayed Sunshine’s story in the most raw and harshest way possible. direk jadaone, a WOMAN director (yes kailangan iempahsize to), saw Sunshine as a human being — a young woman who FEELS, who DREAMS big for herself. not as a criminal but as a real woman with real human flesh with the right to her own life. even Manila didn’t feel like a foreign place as a Batangueña. the entire film was real, we were all living in the same society as Sunshine’s.hindi ito pawang fiction lang. totoo si Sunshine. she is every young woman who had to choose between herself and a life she does not want for herself. she is also every young mom who had to choose between the same things. she is every young woman who is held back by what today’s society deems as morally upright based on outdated religious doctrines. she is every young woman who was denied proper healthcare, every young woman who was denied their choices and rights.she is every young woman who was neglected by a corrupt system that politicizes on women’s health and bodies.thank you, direk jadaone for introducing us to Sunshine. and to my mother, i hope you know that i would’ve understood you the same way Bata understood Sunshine.",4

Sunshine,"i sat at the best seat in the cinema (in the middle!) and love how tastefully beautiful it is visually and sound wisethe visuals remind me of lino brocka + tsai ming liang meets in quiapo, manila. the place itself becomes a character, those shots of sunshine wandering through the urban chaos tell us so much.. especially that scene in the cheap hotel near morayta, when the train passes by and it’s like the city is holding her pain, witnessing everything, maybe even screaming alongside her. the way they use sound here is incredible, and almost throughout the film too, like the noise (and sunshine trying to ‘drown’ them out) becomes part of her headspace, you know? the city breathes with her loneliness. the city is even ‘her’though i find the jojo rabbit inspiration kinda out of place with what the movie already has going for it, maybe it’s just jadaone’s style of directing, trying to move away from brocka’s straight realism into something more surreal, but it doesn’t really work for me since this story needs that grounded feel. still, i appreciate that they didn’t just simplify everything. i personally think films should capture the messy (nuance!) when dealing with complex topic like thisbut overall i think this is really tight and visually gorgeous. my favorite part is when sunshine just whacks that creep with the suitcase. what an improvement from her previous film where the character just called the police lol. this is how you try to attempt a feminist lens in a movie, especially this one, the character arc trying to ‘break’ from the ‘setup’ of the reality they are set in.. like them trying to pull a fourth wall break, but internally, if that makes sense",-1

Sunshine,LEGALIZE ABORTION!,4
Sunshine,"as it was an eye-opener for most—napakalaking bagay nito—it wasn’t the same case with mine, as ive been aware (tho not fully naman) of the state of abortion in the country. Rather, para siyang naging sigh of relief that finally, FINALLY this issue is being talked about and represented on the big screen for the masses. diba? ang pagbubuntis, lalo na ng mga dalaga ay hindi lahat pinlano at ginusto. karamihan, pawang mga biktima lang din ng kakulangan sa edukasyon ukol sa kahalagang ng safe s*x practices. ‘yung iba, biktima ng kasahulan.although i cannot fully say that this representation of such an issue was able to encompass all its accompanying factors, however, it indeed delved into some of its facets: how abortion is a healthcare and a socioeconomic issue due to it being constitutionally prohibited in the country, and much more. sobrang bigat ng mensahe, ng mga salita, at ng tinatalakay ng palabas. pero kahit ayaw man natin no’n, that’s really how it is in real life. this movie isn’t fiction; it’s inspired by true events, particularly of the young, pregnant women in the philippines. many do resort in unsafe practices leaving them at more risk, so bakit kailangang mag agaw-buhay muna ang tao para sa desisyong iyon? abortion is a choice, abortion is healthcare.",4

Sunshine,Ang galing ni Maris! ,-1
Sunshine,"bago matulog, gusto ko lang sabihin na para sa akin, pinakamahusay na pelikula ni direk tonet ito so far! exceptional dito si maris as sunshine; perfect casting! tinatangka ng pelikula hindi lamang putulin kundi baklasin ang sala-salabid na mga isyung patuloy na sumasakal sa kababaihan sa pilipinas—kabilang ang patriyarkal, sexual at physical abuse, diskriminasyon, societal pressure, at ang patuloy na pagkakait sa karapatang magpasya para sa sariling katawan at kalusugan; lalo sa usapin ng pregnancy at abortion! katawan nila, pasya nila dapat! hinahamon din tayo ng pelikula na pag-usapan ang mga isyung ito, at kalampagin ang bawat isa na lumikha ng mga kongkreto’t makataong solusyon dahil ang bawat babae ay dapat may totoong laya, tinig at tindig para sa kanyang katawan, sarili’t mga pangarap. periodt at abante babae always! ",3
Sunshine,"Isang pelikulang magpapamulat sa ‘yo sa katotohanan. If this ain’t the best film of the year then idk what is this. Lahat ng emosyon naramdaman ko while watching the film. Nagalit ako, nainis ako, naiyak ako at lalong lalo na NASAKTAN AKO. Nasaktan ako na dahil sobrang makatotohanan yung mga nangyayari sa pelikulan sa totoong buhay. Lalong lalo na sa kalagayan ni Mary Grace, doon ako napamura. Damang dama ko rin yung silent battles ni Sunshine throughout the film.Hindi pa handa ang ibang tao sa ganitong usapin lalong lalo na sa aborsyon. PERO VALID SIYA AT SANA MAGETS ITO NG MGA TAO.Mahirap maging pro-life lalong lalo na kapag ang bata o ang babae ay katulad sa sitwasyon ni Mary Grace at ni SUNSHINE.Ang dami ko na sinabi pero ito ay realidad na dapat aware ang lahat.PS: Sana mas matindi pa ginawa ni Sunshine sa tito ni Mary Grace because DASURB.",6
Sunshine,Sana may ate din akong Jennica Garcia huhu,-1
Sunshine,"Much has been said about Maris Racal's brilliant performance, but Jennica Garcia's character was so passionately acted and well-written that she compellingly represents the comfort of a loving home, the nurture of a sibling who took on a parental role proving birth is not the only way motherhood can manifest through, and the sacrifice it really takes to be a mother. Yes, ""gets ko na"", but there's something in the way she calls out ""Sunshiiiine"" with so much love that it makes me tear up each time I hear it in my head.",10
Sunshine,"grabe!!! ang galing mo direk tonet!! maris and jennica’s acting was sooo good. sunshine’s ate as a character stood out to me the most, grabe sana lahat may ate or figure sa buhay na katulad niya.yung chaos, yung ingay at gulo ng quiapo/manila was a character of its own. kapag affected ako emotionally from watching a film, iniisip ko nalang na fictional lang naman siya pero this time, ang bigat talaga kasi kahit fiction ‘to, reflection talaga ‘to ng realidad kung gaano kahirap maging babae sa pilipinas. sana ‘di talaga totoo, pero hindi eh, shared experience ‘to ng maraming sunshine at mary grace; ng maraming kababaihan. gets na gets kita, sunshine.",-1
Sunshine,"Worth the watch!! It's so frustrating to a point na i hurt for women. Let's be real, abortion still happens even if it's ""illegal"" in our country. it just escalate to women endangering their lives with unsafe procedures. grabe yon pero that's the reality. As we're watching my friend an i were discussing briefly if nag hahallucinate na ba si sunshine, but when the scene where ariana came, at first, I thought they both might be metaphors of their ""baby"", but then when the 'gets ko na' scene happened, i realized na that's really litte sunshine, which adds up to the 'parehas kami ng pangarap'.",4

Sunshine,"watched with naomi. what a film,,,",-1
Sunshine,"Aspiring Olympian Sunshine's (Maris Racal) world suddenly turned upside down after she realizes that she is pregnant. This is by far the most beautiful and bravest Filipino film I've watched. There is an important topic that needs to be discussed after watching the film. And we need to sit down and talk about it. Loved the whole technical aspect of the show. Cinematography was on point (go Pao!). The gritty Quiapo was a whole character in itself. The bustling city echoes the fear and confusion in Sunshine's mind, yet amidst all the chaos - she is alone. Rico Blanco's music radiated organically throughout the film. Both silent and scored scenes touched feelings and intensified emotions.Maris Racal cemented her status as one of the great actors of her generation. No need to look pretty as long as she delivers the right emotions that her character calls for. And damn, Jennica Garcia! She fuckin' deserves an award! Take it, take it!!! Especially that last scene (spoiler ahead!) where she's the only one who's crying among the cheering crowd? My heart tore to pieces. Special mention to Annika Co who amused me with her natural acting chops. For a kid to deliver that, she's definitely a hot talent to watch out for! And of course, Direk Tonet. Been a fan of Antoinette Jadaone since That Thing Called Tadhana (and yeah, as a ka-eme, AWKP) and damn she really is one strong voice in this industry. Her writing, strengthened by her directing, sends out a clear message to her audience. Sunshine is an example - subtle yet painfully direct in one.After the 7pm screening in SM North last Monday, she came to answer a few questions and what struck me the most is her sharing about her most favorite part of writing - REVISING. For a professional writer like her, it is very humbling and inspiring to hear that. And her body of work definitely shows how great they are due to the notes, lessons and heart she puts to her stories.Favorite scene in the whole series of course was the last routine of Sunshine where she hugged the little girl. Just found myself crying. I literally wanted to jump to the screen and hug both of them just to say, ""it's okay"". ""Naiintindihan mo na ba ako?""

Sunshine,"drown out the noise.sisimulan ko ’tong review sa paraan kung paano nailantad ang pelikula sa mga manonood— sa ingay. sa unang parte, maliban sa naging pagsasanay ni sunshine, ay dadalhin ka nito sa marumi at maingay na sulok ng quiapo kung saan nakabudbod ang mga relihiyosong karatula tulad ng “gift of god,” at “in god we trust.” hindi ka nito lulubayan subalit halos nakaukit na ito sa bawat ugat natin— para bang isa itong palantandaang isa kang pilipino. sobrang bigat nung isang scene na umiiyak si sunshine sa labas ng simbahan, nagmamakaawa na tanggalin lang ang sanggol sa loob niya at babawi rin siya sa Diyos. dahil iyon naman talaga ang itinuro sa atin tungkol sa relihiyon sa simula palang; ang pagiging kondisiyonal nito. dito rin na-introduce ang batang karakter na hindi natin nalaman kung ano ang pangalan at kung bakit ba siya sunod nang sunod kay sunshine na parang nakatali sila sa isa’t-isa. hindi ko alam if napansin din ng iba na hindi totoo/hindi naman nag-e-exist yung bata at isa siyang talinghaga ng magiging anak ni sunshine. ineencapsulate niya yung pagkakasala, kahihiyan, at trauma sa relihiyon ni sunshine. sinusundan siya nito sa bawat balak niya, sinisigawan siya gilid, at pinagdududa ang sarili. higit pa diyan, suportado rin naman siya nito. ika nga niya, kung ano ang pangarap ni sunshine ay pangarap niya rin. kung ano ang nakabubuti kay sunshine ay makabubuti rin para sa kaniya. sa usapin ng abortion, lingat sa mga tao na bigyan ng kaluluwa ang nagdadala ng bata. na para bang isa lamang itong karwahe at hindi taong may puso at pangarap. na sa sandaling nagkaroon na ng buhay sa tiyan mo ay doon na rin nagsimula ang pagkamatay mo. dagdag ko lang sa parte ng mga bata bilang representasyon/metaporya ng mga anak na hindi pa naisisilang ay si ariana. natuwa ako kasi example nga siya ng mga sinasabi ng tao o di kaya nung doktor kay sunshine na, “paano kung maging presidente siya ng pilipinas? mag-imbento ng gamot sa aids?” dahil binahagi niya rin na pangarap niyang mag-artista o di kaya maging unang beking presidente ng pilipinas. at hindi naman din natin isinasantaboy yung mga posibilidad na ‘yon, pero sa sitwasyon na tulad ng nagdadala sa kanya na si menggay na isang biktima ng incestual at corrective rape bilang isang tomboy, maiintindihan natin kung bakit kinailangan maglaho ni ariana. pinabulaanan din ng pelikula ang mga kuro-kuro na aabusuhin ng mga kababaihan ang legalisasyon ng abortion— na baka maging isang gawi na nilang magpalaglag. naipakita na ang abortion ay hindi madaling piliin. na kahit sigurado ang isang tao na ayaw niya maging ina ay isa pa rin itong mabigat na pagpasya. madugo sa puso, madugo sa katawan. hangga’t mananatiling walang pagpasya ang mga kababaihan sa kanilang katawan, mananatili rin ang iligal na pagsasagawa nito.walang lugar ang mga kababaihan sa ganitong sistema at bansa. napatunayan ito sa pelikula— mula sa ospital, sa lansangan, pati sa karapatan mamili. kahit hindi pa nalalaman ang kasarian ng nasa sinapupunan ni sunshine ay hinalaang lalaki na agad ito, isa na namang tanda na hindi kailanman iniisip ang posibilidad ng isang babae. sana sa mga nakapanood nito dahil lang gusto nila si maris, o di kaya’y na-curious sila sa kwento. sa mga hindi sigurado sa kinatatayuan nila sa usaping abortion. sana, tulad nung bata, ay masasabi niyo na ringgets ko na.",-1

Sunshine,"maingay. mausok. magulo.the noise around sunshine gets overwhelming, but she keeps walking toward her dreams, knowing that her steps matter more than the chaos trying to drown her out.this film shows one of the most important and painful truths that women still go through — being shamed for having control over their own bodies. it captures what it feels like to be a woman in a country where your choices are questioned, your body is politicized, and your autonomy is treated like a threat, when it shouldn’t be. there’s nothing wrong with wanting to choose for yourself.",-1
Sunshine,"you’re sunshine, olympian.sunshine’s journey within the whole film was just me rooting for her.. well maybe because i am the same age with her right now and that makes me feel how shaken up she is when she found out she’s pregnant (literally experienced the same heavy feeling and cry uncontrollably during that jeepney scene) i know exactly how deeply sunshine feels (pero hindi po ako buntis).it was just really such a heavy film and gets na gets ko ang buhay ni sunshine bilang taga-maynila, kung gaano hindi ka-fair ang mundo esp with unprivileged ones and it really captures how it is being a woman in a place like this. awa nalang talaga.one detail i love about this film on how it exactly captivates manila. the white noise from the crowd and the sound of vehicles and trains that passes by. it somehow mirrors how sunshine feels, the city is with her.that’s why she’s a different person once she collides with ballet, she really drowns out the noise once she picks her ribbon and live by the meaning of her name, sunshine. the rehearsal scene at the end really got me bawled my eyes out as getting rid of it was the right thing to do, sunshine will forever be haunted of the child she could have had. she’ll certainly thinks about it from time to time and u can’t blame her as we grow up to a catholic country that gives importance to a word ‘family’how i wish the ending could be longer but with technicality, i get it. i’m still grateful that we have a film like this, it’s brave, transparent and very realistic with the world we live by everyday.",-1

Sunshine,"Seen @SM North EDSA Cinema 6 w/Post-Show Q&A and Pagpag Session w/Direk Antoinette Jadaone FANTASTIC SUNSHINE 2/2“Gets ko na.” I still recall that time back in high school when we were taught the morality of abortion in Religion class. I was a scholar at a conservative Catholic all-boys school, and although I wasn’t religious (nor did I ever practice Catholicism on paper), its discussions almost shaped my beliefs on the subject matter. What I did not know was that those beliefs were tied with several factors besides religion such as patriarchy and conservatism. That was before the pandemic, and since then, my viewpoints have stirred away from every close-minded and male-led influence those so-called teachings had. Yet, I still find it unfair that I don’t have to go through those experiences that women go through in this patriarchal society, including that of Sunshine. Critics were not kidding about the Lino Brocka comparisons to Sunshine, yet this has that unique female perspective that elevates its authenticity. The film is straight-forward, and in doing so, it is raw, visceral, and brutally honest. It takes its viewers through an experience rather than dictate or spoonfeed, and it rarely shies away from its reality. From the milieu alone — from the shitty healthcare system, to the sheer lack of contraceptives (if you could find them, they’re very expensive), ignorant, privileged boyfriend, and to the conservative religious doctors and rapist relatives — we are already shown that this is not a world suitable for Sunshine and for women like her who are struck with unwanted pregnancies. Because that’s the truth of our nation. Because this is not a country that favors the oppressed. As the famous saying goes, “Mahirap maging babae, pero mas mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas,” (“It’s impossible to be a woman, but it’s more impossible to be a woman living in the Philippines,”) and that couldn’t be reflected better in this film. Sunshine seeks to reclaim autonomy over her own body, which every woman deserves so but is seldom granted that right. Despite the latter being true, we still see Sunshine do everything she could to get that abortion, even if it means having to spend an unreasonable amount of money just to do so. Some may say that her story is inspiring, but it’s tragic how inspiration is confused with disturbance. This is a story that’s supposed to shed light on the fact of the matter because this is one of many issues in the country that have to be addressed, especially within our own government. Even its production design and cinematography that go hand-in-hand highlight how constrictive this place is for those who are forced to go through such uncomfortable, unasked experiences. Much of the film’s raw emotions would not have been as impactful without Maris Racal. Her acting and performance here are simply generational and incomparable. She may be known for her more comedic roles (and pure wit and vibes in interviews), but her role of Sunshine brings out her more vulnerable side that is just as raw as the attitude of the film itself. Among the more underrated performances is Jennica Garcia, who levels up with Maris Racal’s natural performance but brings a distinct, yet supportive dynamic. Child actor Annika is also great and is secretly the one who makes some of the more emotional scenes, especially those towards the end, work so well. In addition, Meryll Soriano stands out, as do Elijah Canlas, Rhed Bustamante, Xyriel Manabat, Piolo Pascual, and Angeli Bayani – even if the latter two only show up in one scene each. Some ongoing debate had sparked since its release here with regards to the weaving of the children subplot into the story, and while it did have its risks, for better or worse, it still cannot be disregarded how brave Antoinette Jadaone and Maris Racal are for telling this kind of story. Perhaps it could have been subtler, but in a country like ours, it was necessary to have been told through a more straightforward direction without being too preachy. There have been a handful of films out there that tackle abortion and unwanted pregnancies, but what makes Sunshine stand out is the mere fact that it is set in the Philippines. We are one of the last few countries to have abortion illegal as we are rooted in traditions influenced by the patriarchy and religion that treat it as an immoral, evil doing and as a taboo simply because, to them, the youth are “being irresponsible.” Sunshine never puts the blame on its titular character for its consequential catalyst, and through its depiction of such a life in this country, instead, asks us to question our reality: Did the youth fail us for exploring a natural part of ourselves, or did the adults fail them by placing and enabling all these barriers as mere punishment substituted by the words of “a lesson” or “a teaching”? That’s what makes Sunshine scary: The simple fact that it’s set in the Philippines; that women with unwanted pregnancies have to navigate through these stupid barriers, but it also ends with hope for a better future where women are allowed to make choices for their own body. In fact, we must also be reminded of this saying: “No uterus, no opinion.” Such a timely film that is raw and honest with its sensitive topic that must be talked about because so many women have had experiences like that of Sunshine. P.S. Seeing this at one of the many screenings with Q&A and audience sharing truly added to its communal experience. Direk Tonet always mentions how the film is no longer hers but ours now that we have seen it, and you could clearly see and feel it as the credits rolled, with some women opening up about once being a Sunshine or their parents giving birth to them at such an early age. It reminds you that those experiences are real and are still happening to other women underground up to now. It’s also amazing to see an eye-opening drama such as this fill up the theaters more than it did for Fantastic Four (which made for such a whiplash of a double-feature for me because it tackles the opposite theme to Sunshine).P.P.S. It goes without saying that those who say that Philippine Cinema is nothing compared to Hollywood films should shut up and watch this in cinemas. Cool to see my prof work on this. Ang gwapo rin nina Elijah Canlas at Cris Cao (luh). Oh, and legalize and decriminalize abortion in the Philippines now!Most-Anticipated Films of 20252025 Ranked2025 In Theaters",28

Sunshine,"""gets mo na? gets ko na.""This film could've ended there! since it already foreshadows the choice she made. But no, instead it got better and gave the audience a satisfaction of how Sunshine became successful despite her hurdles.I really loved the color grading in this film! at the first scenes it gave me a feeling of uneasiness, and worry for Sunshine — maybe that's because of the constant dark grading along with the green or teal background. The film's color grading gradually changed as the story progresses, when Sunshine gained hope, and courage for her decision the film got brighter.Fuck I have a lot to say in this movie. I also loved how they showed a taboo topic in the Philippines as well which is the incest among minors because of the so-called ""utang na loob"". I really loved how Sunshine stood up to tito bobot — that fuckin' asshole. By showing and portraying this taboo topic in this film I hope the viewers gained a light that this is wrong. A minor, pregnant by his tito, is not normal and is wrong. Many people chooses to turn a blind eye on this matter kasi.I also loved how women support women in this film, okay not that first doctor but the second doctor who offered Sunshine a checkup on her private clinic.This movie showed that being a woman doesn't mean being a mom only. Being a woman could mean so many things, being a woman could make being an olympian possible.Rooting for you Sunshine, you are not just a mom-to-be. You're more than among all those people say to you. As coach says to sunshine, drown the noise out. Deadma sa comments ng iba tungkol sayo.",-1

Sunshine,"I have always disliked how people compare other Filipino cities to Metro Manila, specifically Cebu City. Because they always go for the most shallow differences and often time the most hypocritical. Every city in the Philippines, and for the most part the world, has traffic, hot weather, trashy streets, muggers, and poor air quality, not just Metro Manila. This frustrates me because there IS a tangible difference between Manila and other cities, it's just that a city's identity is more spiritual in essence. The churches in Cebu City won't have vendors selling abortion pills, nor will doctors in Davao City berate you moments after caring for you after you nearly died from an attempted abortion, but in Manila they do. It's a city of people getting by, it's why you go to Manila, and a deep understanding among everyone that that's what they're all trying to do, just get by.Every year my favorite Filipino movie to come out pass by me until the next year, I think this is the first time that's changed.",-1

Sunshine,"the film hits too close to home for me. sunshine is suffocating, and maybe that's a directorial choice. it hits in the most uncomfortable and painful parts of me at times. it resonates with every woman who has to determine a better choice out of two shitty choices: one that might shackle her freedom or one that may free her but haunt her at the same time. it makes you feel rage at systemic failures which birth a backward society that villifies women for their lapses of judgment--damned if they do, damned if they don't. sunshine is linear in its plot. it never really takes you out of sunshine's head, so you see how raw everything is, how immature she is, how she's desperate and breaking apart but trying to keep it together, and how she's just a kid who fucked up. the film works because of this approach, albeit some plot devices are too on the nose--making them iffy and questionable, and may have muddled the film's stance. there are obvious plot holes, little details that could have enriched the world-building were overlooked. some subplots lack depth, but the performances made me look past on these things, in a sense that it was pleasant enough to watch for me. not for everyone, but everyone should be part of the discussion. jadaone's films are usually hits-or-misses for me, but sunshine is one of her better ones. the message may be clear and hopeful, but real life presents a much darker truth: for most women, there are no olympics and dreams to hold on to. in reality, we still have a long way to go in paving for a more humane society for filipino women.here's to working towards a future where women are not shamed for reclaiming their agency, and where their indiscretions are not berated and ridiculed, but treated with proper education and compassion.",-1

It wasn't resentment but rather understanding as she realized that she was never part of the dream and she let Sunshine go.…",17
Sunshine,"""sunshine"" delves deeply into prevalent social realities and dares to question long-standing traditional systems. but what struck me most was how it thoughtfully explored women’s bodily autonomy, weaving it into a narrative that felt both natural and unforced.the lead's inner turmoil exists in the gray areas—a subtle moral dilemma, especially when prioritizing autonomy challenges societal expectations.this raises critical questions: how does sunshine’s obligation to herself impact the broader community? and what roles do the people around her play in shaping or reinforcing these expectations?i honestly wished there was more screen time, yet in the moments it was given, it still managed to leave a profound message about women's reproductive rights—one that lingers and quietly settles in your mind.",-1

Sunshine,"Superb portrayal of religious elements and realism in the Philippines. Kung ipagpalagay mo sarili mo na maagang na buntis at nag gagalugad sa quiapo na tila bawat sulok naka tingin sayo ang panginoon, para ka talagang sinasaksak ng liwanag. E wala kang magagawa, saan ba dapat humihingi ng tulong? Sa doctor na sasabihan kang mag sorry kay lord o kay manang na tiga benta ng abortion pills sa quiapo tas sobrang mahal pa? Ang hirap maging babae dito, yung nakabuntis nakakatakas at yung nabuntis kailangan maging mabuting ina kahit mag-isa na't lahat. Yung scene na nag uusap sila nina Miggy at tatay niya, arghh sorry pastor pero pakyu. Kadalasan sa totoong buhay, o sige nabuntis na nga buti papanagutan EH KASO anong kapalit? Bawal na mag-aral yung babae, yung pangarap na maging propesyonal wala na, dito na lang sa bahay tiga alaga hanggang magkaroon na sapot ng gagamba. Pag babae ang daming kailangang isakripisyo, pangarap ko o yung fetus na to e.Also want to point out how well written lahat ng side characters. Si Dr. Helena!! As someone who belongs sa healthcare forces, ang hirap kung yung sistema natin hindi sinusuportahan yung nga katulad nilang maagang nabuntis, lalo na mga below 13yrs old. Myghod naiyak talaga ako dun sa ateng nabuntis ng tito niya. Marami nakong nabasa na irl stories na kinukutya daw sa hospital mga ganyan. Yung lalaking doctor sa sunshine arghh isa pang pakyu. Bakit tatanggihan ang buhay ng isang biktima dahil lamang sinubukan nilang ipalaglag yung batang nabuo in an illegal way din? Puta doctor ka sa lagay na yan, bakit ko hahayaan mamatay parehas kung kaya ko naman buhayin yung isa? Dahil sa sistema na pumipigil sa atin at sa mga paniniwala na matagal na tayong binabalot. UGHH PAANO MAGIGING PROGRESIBO ANG HEALTHCARE SA PILIPINAS KUNG PURO NA LANG SOCIAL BIASES AT DISKRIMINASYON. Nag breakdown talga aq hays knowing na may mga kabatch din akong sobrang pikit sa problema ng lipunan, paano pa kaya kung nag tatrabaho na sila.""Bakit di ka manghingi ng pera sa bf mo""""Di ko yun bf, tito ko""Para sa mga biktima ng sexual abuse, isang mahigpit na yakap. Dapat pa bang hintayin na maging biktima (rape, sa, etc) ang isang babae para lang masabi na may karapatan siyang mag pa abort? Lalo na sa mga kabataan, mygod tanginang mga matatandang mahilig sa mga walang kaalam-alam na bata. Kung sino pa may mas alam, sila pa maninira. Last na, yung scene na magkatabi si sunshine at ate niya rinig mo yung ulan habang binbanggit nung ate niya pangalan ni sunshine. nice symbolism na idk how to explainOverall, sulit yung gutom ko simula 5am to 4pm at nahabol ko oras sa sm masinag pagkauwi eheheGanda talaga ni Maris.

Sunshine,"another progressive local film ! we love to see it ! we’ve been milked by Vice Ganda and Vic Sotto movies for way too longoverall, this was a good call-out on the Philippines’ outdated laws and cultural perspectives. what made this even more depressing is that all of it is still rampant irl, especially among the country’s lower sectors. sex ed remains taboo, God knows how many cases of violence against women and children go unreported - and to this day, we continue to entrap women with misogyny and religious conservatism in a system that offers them almost no safe way out",13

Sunshine,"“Sunshine” tackles urgent and relevant issues that are at the core of the current public health system in the Philippines. The film confronts the alarming rise in teenage pregnancies, a problem often worsen by a lack of sex education. It bravely addresses women's rights to choose, challenging the patriarchy that continues to influence societal norms in the country.The film's powerful message is that women have the right to be anything they want to be. They should have the final say over their bodies, their dreams, their choices, and their lives. No one should ever dictate who they are or what they can become. ""Sunshine"" makes a compelling case that a woman's decisions are her own, and outside opinions, particularly from men, are irrelevant. It is a story that empowers women, giving them a VOICE to be HEARD and a presence to be SEEN.""Sunshine"" is raw, relevant, and a catalyst for important conversations. It is not just a film; it is a reflection of the struggles faced by countless women. The movie fearlessly asks difficult questions and forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths. It's a story that deserves to be discussed by everyone, because Sunshine is more than just a character—she is a symbol of HOPE and COURAGE. Maris Racal's portrayal of Sunshine is the best. She perfectly captures the reality of a woman's struggle and the immense difficulty of navigating life in this world. The supporting cast is equally remarkable. Jennica Garcia and Annika Co deliver powerful performances that are essential to the film's impact. Every cast in this film was remarkable.A big big thank you to Direk Tonet Jadaone for her bravery and boldness in telling this story. Your work is consistently admirable because you don't just make films; you spark meaningful conversations that resonate long after the credits roll.Hindi mahirap maging babae sa mundo kung sa umpisa pa lang ang BABAE ay merong sariling desisyon para sa sarili nila at di dinidiktahan ng kung sino man.",12
Sunshine,"Everything is political when you're a woman! Our healthcare, our lives, our choices... It is all political...These are the reasons why I am a feminist. Filipino women deserve better healthcare!!! Filipino women deserve to have a choice!!! Filipino women are more than being mothers— they are nurses, doctors, teachers, engineers, artists, gymnasts, and so much more. Kaya gustong gusto ko yung confrontation scene na iginiit ni Sunshine kayna Miggy na ayaw niyang maging nanay. WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR THEMSELVES.Living in a really conservative religious country is hell for women nga naman. We are bound to be shamed kahit anong gawin natin. Nakakaiyak na tinitiis na lang naming mga babae ang sistemang hindi naman ginawa para saamin. Kapag nabuntis, sasabihan na malandi. Kapag gustong magpalaglag, immoral. Kapag ayaw maging nanay, makasarili. Saan na lang kami lulugar sa bansang ito???? Kahit ang simpleng karapatan sa quality healthcare ipinagdadamot pa! Maraming salamat direk tonet sa paggawa ng napakagandang pelikula na to. From the cinematoraphy to the sounds to the script! Napakahusay. Yung shots don sa hotel scene and yung ingay ng LRT grabe i think that sums up the whole movie. Kuhang-kuha ang ingay at gulo ng Maynila. Ang Maynila na puno ng gulo at pangarap.

Sunshine,"galit. lungkot. awa.ito ang mga emosyon na aking naramdaman pagkatapos panuorin ito--kahit nung una kong panuod. napakabigat.simple at matimbang. this film lingers. isang linggo na nakalipas pero iniisip ko pa rin ang pelikula. ganun ka-impactful ang storya--ang buhay ni sunshine.i commend direk tonnet for this. napakatapang. at hanggang ngayon ay namamangha pa rin ako na nagkaroon tayo ng tyansa na mapanuod ito sa sinehan... na walang cuts!!!! knowing ang pinas ay catholic-centric..... madaming conservatives.... :/ pasalamat na lang sa Panginoon () at hindi ito naharang ng mtrcb..at kailangan ko pa bang i-mention si maris racal? napakagaling umarte jusko. ung confrontation scene niya with her coach... oh god.... napakahusay. best actress yan shang tunay!!!!!!!!wala na akong masasabi pa dahil nasabi na ng karamihan. ang gusto ko lang ipaalala ulit ay sana magkaroon na ng tunay na batas na nagproprotekta sa mga kababaihang pilipino. decriminalize abortion. legalize abortion even. panagutin ang mga lalaking nagsasamantala sa ating mga kababaihan. bigyan din ng atensyon ang ating mga atleta. at higit sa lahat, pagbutihin pa sana ang healthcare system ng bansa...si sunshine ay hindi lamang natin makikita sa malaking screen sa loob ng sinehan; siya rin ay namumuhay sa labas. sa loob ng bahay, sa eskwelahan, sa simbahan, sa ospital, sa kulungan, at sa kalsada.it hits hard sa second watch......... :( gets ko naaa.....",6
Sunshine,the emotional whiplash i got from watching superman to watching this omg  but this was such a good film! and the acting was great i teared up a few times  and the fact that this happens to a lot of women in real life hurts my heart so bad  but i still hope and pray abortion gets legalized in this godforsaken country in the near future,5

Sunshine,"overheard a girl in the restroom saying “at least mabait si [yung character] piolo” and maybe thats what makes this film effective and horrifying. patriarchalism masks itself in kindness, in family values, religious salvation, in medicine, in the thought of care. we are so deeply entangled in its edifice we cannot decipher care from control. against the backdrop of the sticky, restless, and noisy streets of manila, Sunshine becomes a suffocating experience. a formidable display of how patriarchy is insidious. even the reactions of the women around sunshine are outcomes of its thinking, sometimes its intentional, sometimes unaware. the judgement and unsolicited advice are concealed as concern and even sunshine herself isn’t free from it. it is literally manifested as an imaginary child that echoes her guilt, pressure, and the moral burden thats placed upon her. There are moments where its subtexts are parallel to Ernaux’s memoir Happening, which is visceral in its honesty about seeking abortion in 60s France, a time where it was illegal there. But Sunshine is dangerously current. Abortion remains illegal in the country because religion and patriarchy is deeply etched that it is indistinguishable from moral law (yet pamparegla pills in quiapo sit on the same shelves as statues of the infant jesus and still our agency must somehow exist in conflict with holiness.) in the final act, Sunshine’s choice is physically expressed through a routine. her movements make it seem her body is being wrapped in ribbons, constricted and suffocating, but as she continues, the bindings are loosened and ultimately released. the film’s profundity lies in its portrayal of abortion not as something easy nor devoid of consequences. it is contradicting: physically and emotionally excruciating but undeniably life saving.",-1
Sunshine,"I cried three times while watching Sunshine, and I cried the hardest during this particular scene. It’s when Pastor Jaime and Miggy visit Sunshine’s house to discuss her future. Instead of asking how Sunshine is feeling in that moment, Pastor Jaime immediately begins outlining plans like offering maternal and healthcare coverage for her and the baby, and even proposing an educational fund up to college for the child.This scene highlights another tragedy that women face in a patriarchal society.…",-1

The story has such high value and it speaks volumes for women and society itself. I just feel like the story has more to tell, and the ending fell short. I wanted to see more of the story with the doctor and how everything happened before the ending came to place.Overall, more films like this please!

Sunshine,"this film is similar sa ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020)"" both films show how society, laws, and silence put all the pressure sa girl, and none on the system that failed her. so this film is not just about being strong or making better choices. it's abt how society fails women. it forces them to carry shame, to stay silent, and to face consequences alone. while the systems and laws that claim to ""protect"" them do the opposite. i appreciate this film sm, it's the kind of film that doesn't ask for applause, it asks for reflection.",-1

Sunshine,"she fought tooth and nail for her dream, yung buong journey nya parang pagpasok sa butas ng karayom — gets na gets ko. there's two specific scenes in this that i find so horrifying. is there really no hope for women? etong tanong lang to nasa isip ko in every fucken thing she had to endure. sunshine's own manifestation of her inner child as her conscience was an interesting part of the movie. sobrang devastating nung scene sa simula ng movie na nilalayuan nya yung batang version nya; i think the person i would fear to face now is also the child that i once was. i had a thought before that everyone on earth was once a child, and not many people can afford to continue being one. the scenes with the children in this movie breaks my heart. yung 'fetus' pinangakuan ng magandang kinabukasan pero yung mga ganap na bata na sa movie ay mga biktima. while waiting for our rides home, my friend and i kept thinking how a lot of people are going to misconstrue the point of this movie. im nervous na baka gawin tong movie na to as a cautionary tale about abortion imbis na maging enlightenment on how the system fails us in every fucken way of our being. but i love to think that, like her name, the sun will shine. the light will pass through the darkness. the final scene with her inner child was so important to me. gets ko na. sana magets nyo rin.",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is an important film—one that Filipinos shouldn’t miss. It’s not the strongest film, but it’s certainly worth discussing.In fact, it currently tops my list of Filipino movies this year. And that’s precisely why I feel a sense of disappointment. At the very least, I wish it had resonated more deeply. It had the potential to delve further into its realism, but instead, it chose to spoon-feed every emotional beat, leaving little room for quiet reflection. While I understand why Jadaone took this direction, I can’t say it worked for me.Personally, I wasn’t fully sold on the use of children as a narrative device. The way the film delivers its message too overtly makes the subplot involving the 13-year-old feel disconnected and distracting. The child character might have been more effective as a symbolic presence, her inner voice, her conscience. Had it stayed that way, rather than taking the more problematic route of literally giving life to unborn children, as in Ariana’s case, the film might have delivered a far more powerful impact.Still, there was a moment near the end, a line that marked a turning point of understanding and acceptance, where freedom was finally felt from guilt. That scene alone earned the film a 9 out of 10 from me.",12
Sunshine,"Tangina mo miggy, bat d ka nag pull out.",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine is definitely a must-watch. More than just the brilliant performances, especially by Maris, who portrayed her role with such raw honesty, the film strikes deep because of the story it tells. It dares to talk about what many still shy away from: the state of our healthcare system, the stigma around reproductive rights, and how these deeply affect the lives of women every day. It powerfully shows how abortion is healthcare, and how denying safe, legal options doesn’t stop…",20
Sunshine,"maris racal really showed up and showed out for this. amazing that this is even showing here, on this 3rd week as of writing (!!!!) and i wish more people would watch this in theaters, especially young women and men. it sparks uncomfortable discussions and really highlights as much as we want to have a black and white and sometimes gray world, it's really not how it works because we deserve the basic right to our Self. the background of manila in all this, the religious imagery, the complex family dynamics seen in the everyday....it might not seem much to most, but its a loud and important start to having conversations that can shape change for this damned country",20
Sunshine,"The OB admitting section was, and still is, one of the busiest parts of the hospital I worked in as an intern. It had been renovated prior to my first duty there, and it would be renovated once again after I'd left. Both of those renovations were done in part to address a persistent issue: that the place never runs out of patients. Every day, and especially on Mondays and Fridays, the admitting section would take in a significant number of expectant mothers with all sorts of conditions. Some would be giving birth for the first time. Some were veterans who were familiar to the staff working there, giving birth like clockwork every year. Some had serious conditions alongside their pregnancies that made giving birth extremely complicated, to the point where their current state posed a significant risk for death while giving birth. Nevertheless, they would slowly fill up the adjacent labor and delivery room, often two to three mothers to a stretcher. On very busy days the stretchers would run out, and the labor room would be filled with mothers settling down wherever they could, mostly on the cold, tiled floor.I remembered those days in the admitting section when I saw Antoinette Jadaone's latest film, Sunshine, about a young gymnast (Maris Racal) who gets pregnant right before a very important event that might lead to the SEA games and eventually the Olympics. Sunshine doesn't have any qualms about making the decision as she immediately gets to work trying to find an abortifacient to terminate the unwanted pregnancy. This process is not made easy. Miggy (Elijah Canlas), the man who impregnated Sunshine, wants nothing to do with her after learning of her pregnancy. He doesn't even tell her to have an abortion directly, only saying that 'she knows what to do.' Getting medical help is equally difficult, and intersects gender with class: medical treatment is expensive (despite the fact that state sponsored healthcare should be financially accessible) and as abortion is still illegal in the Philippines, people resort to black markets to seek the care they need.Once in a while, the OB admitting section will receive a patient who has lost her child. Miscarriages are common, and often they are spontaneous. Once, a mother of a stillborn child asked me if the cries in the next room were her child's, when I knew the infant was lying in a box, ready to be given to back to their parents. Then there are the other kinds of patients, ones who made a choice like Sunshine. They all had their reasons; this was a conscious and informed decision. After a while you know it when they come in. Sometimes the doctor would come in and tell them that what they did was illegal, some would even threaten to call the police. Nothing ever came of it; they were empty threats - often to 'scare' them into not making that decision again. It always made me uncomfortable.To be born a woman is to be born into violence, into a world where the odds are stacked against you. Sunshine is not the first film to depict this violence - films like Rae Red's Babae at Baril (2019) and Jadaone's own Fan Girl (2020) are two examples. They show what a deeply patriarchal society creates: people like Miggy and a certain other character near the end, people who I interpreted as not exactly archetypal or allegorical towards the structures that created them, but as the inevitable products of it. But unlike those two films that I mentioned earlier, Sunshine feels far more indignant, full of anger that Fan Girl lacked, and drawing towards a different conclusion compared to Babae at Baril.Quiapo has been a backdrop for many a Filipino film, and here it is a sanctuary of sorts. It is here where Sunshine goes to find the solution to her problems. Ironically draped in religious imagery, it both embodies the faith it represents (as a source of refuge for those who are in need) and as something that stands against its tenets.Sunshine is a film about choices: the choice to live one's own dream, the choice to live freely as the best person you can be. Sunshine's sister Geleen (Jennica Garcia) coaches Sunshine as she practices in their shared home. Certain background elements (thanks to the film's excellent production design) hint that Geleen, too, was once an aspiring gymnast, whose dreams ended with a baby. If she had the choice, would she have lived a different life? It shows as well in Geleen's character, and Garcia gives a standout performance as her.Finally, that idea of ""refuge"" may not refer to Quiapo, but something else entirely. Throughout the film there are many people, both seen and unseen, who help Sunshine in her quest. ""Ipagdadasal ko kayo,"" a hilot tells Sunshine after they bring a child to the hospital who made the same choice. ""Mag-ingat ka,"" another one tells Sunshine as she sets off. A sympathetic medical professional gives a knowing look. Every doctor has a story like it: in one of my last rotations at the labor room, a patient walked in nervously in the robe the hospital supplied her. It was a very busy day, and pregnant women overflowed on the stretchers and sat on the floor. She had no business being here: she looked no older than 14, and she should be going to school and playing with friends, not in the last stages of giving birth. Suffice it to say, this pregnancy was not her choice. If she had the choice like Sunshine did, would she be here? On the other hand, the point of the film for me is not whether one makes one choice over the other, but that people like Sunshine and that kid has the ability to choose in the first place.Because the labor and delivery room should be semi-sterile, companions (in this case, the kid's very worried mother) are not allowed in. But the rest of the mothers in that labor room heard us taking the medical history and heard her story. The other expectant mothers gave the kid their blankets, talked to and comforted her, up until she gave birth. Everyone was that kid's mother that day. In a world where you are denied agency, where one is subjected to violence from birth, the least women can do is find refuge in each other.",-1
Sunshine,FUCK FUCK FUCK THE SYSTEM,27
Sunshine,"my first film for the month AND IT’S THIS GOOD. no notes, honestly. it sent THE message as clear as day. it got its point across without any !!overbearing moralizing!! or shoving anything down your throat or at least, i hope so!!!maris racal and the whole cast were so good. it was an honor to watch them portray these characters, esp maris. every time i see her play a character, she is the character. SHE IS ALWAYS GOING THROUGH IT. she goes beyond her past roles all the time.may this film truly help and get the message through when it comes to the real-world necessities our women need. when it comes to reproductive health, nothing is just for convenience. and it’s not only about the ending—it’s ALSO about how important it is to equip the youth with the actual, necessary knowledge about the topic. it’s not something that should be hushed. let our women know what they can do for themselves, and what they should never allow men—or anyone else—to decide for them!!! at higit sa lahat, itigil ang ipokrisya!!! bilang katoliko at pilipino, how do we manage to continue in shaming other people? there SHOULD always be room for conversations pero laging pinapangunahan ng pamamahiya, ng pagtawag ng mga pangalan when kindness should always be the one upfront ?!!! dahil sa wrong order of priority, hindi nakikita ng tao yung tunay na pinagdadaanan ng ibang bumoboses at humihingi ng tulong.",-1
Sunshine,"bring all misogynist, conservatives, and the self-centered politicians to actually watch this film. We really need safe and legal abortion here in the Philippines. Women's body autonomy should never depend under patriarchy. p.s. Annika, the child that you are!",13
Sunshine,"Maris and the rest of the cast were perfectly chosen for the film, with each character making a meaningful contribution to the plot. Maliban sa acting and galing galing din ni maris sa mismong mga gymnast performances niya!!To be honest, I initially found Sunshine disturbing and lacking in many parts. It felt like the film held back, especially in its screenplay and pacing. But as I reflected more on it, I realized that might have been the point—although many of the scenes were commendably filmed, the film wasn’t trying to entertain; it was trying to confront. Maliban sa mismong tema ng storya, sobrang daming iba pang paghihirap na danas ng lipunan natin na mismo ako ay hindi aware ang naipakita sa pelikula.The rawness and silence I initially perceived as weaknesses were actually reflections of Sunshine herself—caught between the pressures of gymnastics and the weight of her misfortunes. In that light, I came to see that her quietness was powerful and already served as the message.The film was created not just to tell Sunshine’s story, but to help us recognize the many ""Sunshines"" around us—especially in the Philippines, where abortion remains heavily stigmatized due to political control and religious conservatism. Sunshine challenges us to understand their pain and see their urgent need for help.I truly hope that someday, those in power will recognize that safe and legal abortion is not just a debate—it’s a right every Filipina deserves to have.",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine fue una experiencia bastante sorprendente dentro del contexto del cine mainstream filipino moderno. Saliéndose del margen seguro y cómodo que tiene acostumbradas a las masas a la complacencia social retratada en un romanticismo casi cínico de la pobreza y la glorificación del poder y la influencia, además de la necesidad por rectitud religiosa. La cinta, desarrollándose sin teatralidad ni grandes despliegues telenoveleros de drama, entiende perfectamente que la sobriedad y sequedad de la realidad filipina de la clase baja no necesita endulzantes para trabajar de manera efectiva y cortante en pantalla. La cinematografía es excelente, el ritmo es perfecto y las tomas se toman todo el tiempo necesario para declarar visualmente sus ideas, además de que la dirección si bien denota algunos rastros y pequeños momentos de la desconexión farandulera moderna del voyerismo cínico que nos fuerza a sentir lastima por la pobreza, no cae totalmente en ello, demostrando mucha fuerza y entendimiento la gran parte del tiempo.",12
Sunshine,"sunshine explored important and sensitive topics that are not only necessary for filipino audience to see but also essential to open dialogues and conversations, to shed light on and ultimately to spark change especially on things that are often labeled as taboo in a conservative and retrogressive country like the philippines.the film does not impose, it only depicts the struggles of the character. it shows her grit, resilience and her power to decide for herself. sunshine is a beautiful portrayal of a woman’s ability to choose and her autonomy to determine her fate. despite the living ironies she’s confronted with, she remains hopeful, that she could still follow her dreams and that she could rule over her life against all odds. she doesn’t have to conform. no one else could dictate how her story goes but her.sunshine does not necessarily promote pre-marital sex or abortion. it goes beyond issues of healthcare and reproductive health. it advocates empathy and compassion to the sunshines of the world. it allows us to understand the complexities and the silent pains and plights women go through and why there’s a need for them to have access to safe and equitable options.",12
Sunshine,"gets ko na.A chilling and wonderful movie. I can feel how much thought and love were poured into making this. Super stellar ng pagkagawa, down to the acting, cinematography, and details.

Sunshine,"set the scene. modern-day manila, a city equally bound by the abundance of opportunity as it is bound by the abundance of consequence. sunshine is a dreamer tied to the goal of becoming an olympian. she is told to drown out the noise while she lives a life enclosed by it. she gets pregnant by a good for nothing conyo elijah canlas and is told that her poverty-stricken ass should carry the burden of aborting the baby. and of all places, she finds herself in quiapo, manila’s catholic landmark, praying to Jesus as she repeatedly journeys through the downtown in her search for the most effective pills while surrounded by statues of Mary, her conscience carrying the loudest whispers that deem her a murderer, echoed by the church she sought forgiveness in—and the very God she prays to.there exists an assumption about the matriarchal philippines, a country that holds its female sensibilities to the highest regard in the same way it adores Mary. yet as we are exposed to our society’s deepest cancers, the mask of matriarchy only rings true for as long as it submits to the role of patriarchy and as a result, we are a nation of contradictions because of this reality. only in the philippines you can see a catholic girl pocketing abortion pills in a church. sunshine is no Mary, and manila is no matriarchy. her conscience rides through a push and pull with the conservative ideals she was brought upon. her best friend briefly ditches her out of familial pressure. her ex’s family (hi papa p) barges in their house to own up to the mistake. sunshine’s life is filled to the brim with contradiction. in spite of this, even with her lack of maturity and the ever-so demanding backdrop of a patriarchal manila, there remains glimmers of hope, her own thriving matriarchy within the small space she can truly call her own. an environment not bound by fluctuating contradiction, but by the permanence of choice.",-1

Sunshine,"recently read the translation of farrokhzad’s review/justification for golestan’s the brick and the mirror where she said the film is a movement in a stagnant environment which should be in motion. i think that also applies to sunshine. philippine cinema (and even jadaone herself) has a tendency of producing movies that expand the capital. after all, you only get to have a second movie if your first one is profitable enough. from a moral perspective, sunshine is a dare to move something in philippine cinema. it’s not the first stroke, of course, and not the boldest either, but this film occupying the same space that other safe bet family dramas and love team romcom is a shift we rarely see these days. it’s a small ripple but it keeps the momentum (or at least rattle the conscience) in an environment that refuses to progress with time. i wish it was bolder, but it is angry, at least.",12
Sunshine,"This has the conviction needed to show the reality of having to live as a woman. It tells a story of having your life bound to the socially constructed roles— no agency over your choices, body, and womanhood as a whole.I just love how Sunshine is unapologetic about its message. Despite it being from a country that is critically conservative, it did not care. Rather, it tried to deliver its essence in a way that makes people understand it. I am not going to take that plot-wise, it might have lacked. But it did manage to start and end strong. Maris killed it— so to speak.",-1

Sunshine,"wait uwi muna q sa bahayedit: pinanood ko yung film nung august 2 ngayon lang ako maglalagay ng review wowang laban ni sunshine ay laban ng mga kababaihan.grabe, it feels surreal na makita yung totoong buhay quiapo sa sinehan lalo na when you also lived that in real life. tuwing nadadaan ako ng quiapo tuwing papauwi galing ng pup, andami kong nadadaanang nagbebenta ng herbal na pamparegla, sa panonood ng sunshine ko na narealize na itong mga tao pala na 'to na nasa bangketa ay iyong nakakasaksi sa pinaka-totoo at pinaka-vulnerable na estado ng iilang babae sa atin — kumbaga, ang dami nilang kwento, ang dami nilang danas, at higit sa lahat, sila iyong nakakaintindi sa nararamdaman ng mga babaeng lumalapit sa kanila, sila iyong walang pangmamata.sana katulad ng mga nagbebenta ng mga pamparegla sa quiapo, maintindihan din ng ibang tao na ang abortion ay hindi isang kasalanan, hindi isang taboo topic, at hindi isang desisyon na nakasalalay sa iba ang sagot. siguro kung binubuksan lang yung mga diskusyon na katulad nito sa mainstream media, mas lalawak pa yung kaalaman ng mga tao sa abortion at women's rights, pero dahil nga kristiyano at patriyarkal na bansa ang pilipinas, wala tayong napapala. nanatiling mangmang ang karamihan ng mga pilipino rito dahil hindi binibigyan ng pagkakataon na mapag-aralan at malaman ito.singit ko lang din yung role na ginampanan ni annika rito, SOBRANG GALING???? like how could you expect that performance from a novice child actress who's not even fluent in filipino tapos gaganap sa isang pelikula na sobrang pinoy??? sobrang galing lang ni annika at nag-iisang batang aktres na nakapag-paiyak sa akin dahil lang sa isang linya niya. THE 'GETS KO NA' SCENEEE FUCCCCKKK ANG LUHA KOOOHH :(( and its even more beautiful kasi that also reflects to annika in real life because she fully understood the role she played in the film :( na para bang mas open-minded pa siya sa karamihan ng mga matatanda sa atin. sobrang dami kong luhang binuhos sa sunshine at sobrang dami ko ring natutunan. sobrang raw at sobrang vulnerable — kinda ironic pero ayun yung naging strength ng pelikulang ito. mahal na mahal ko mga likha ni direk tonet. grabe. one of the best directors of her time.

Sunshine,"sorry po, papa god",16
Sunshine,"""Ang pangarap ko ay pangarap niya."" This line, spoken by the child, sums up the entire film. It’s simple, heartfelt, and my favorite line. People may have their own interpretations, but this is how I personally understood it.Sunshine has an older sister, Ate Geleen, played by Jennica Garcia. Ate Geleen was once a gymnast, just like Sunshine. But now, she takes care of her child. The film doesn’t say it outright, but it’s clear that Ate Geleen gave up her dreams and career to raise her baby. Why did she give it all up? We don't know. But maybe it’s because she’s the eldest daughter — the one expected to take care of her siblings, the one who is supposed to work harder, sacrifice more, and carry the heaviest weight.Mahirap maging babae, lalo na kung ikaw ang panganay na anak ng pamilya.Maybe that’s also the very reason why she’s so supportive of Sunshine’s decision — to have an abortion, to chase her dreams, and to not follow in her footsteps. Ate Geleen knows exactly what it’s like to give up everything, and she doesn’t want her younger sister to carry the same burden she did.The movie ended with Ate Geleen proudly looking at Sunshine while holding her baby. Dahil ang pangarap ni Sunshine ay siya ring pangarap ni Ate Geleen na hindi niya natupad.",-1

Sunshine,SOAFFER GANDA OA,-1
Sunshine,"Natawa ako sa simula. Like I love how Sunshine visited QUIAPO Church first, then went to Miggy's school ALL THE WAY in DEL MONTE AVE, QUEZON CITY (Sha Tin in the background and I recognize Miggy's school), smashed his car in his school's parking spot, then ran TO RECTO AVE, MANILA to avoid being caught  Never skipped leg day si Sunshine.On a serious note, I love how it is way much more than a pro-choice/pro-abortion movie. It champions compassion and understanding first through the many hardships that pregnancy poses in a country where abortion is very much illegal. It's uncomfortable at times, heartbreaking at others, but in spite of the pain and desperation, it's also empathetic at times too, like with Thea and Sunshine's siblings. Love her sister especially.The only reason why I gave it a 4.5 stars is because there are some... SOME moments where nabitin ako, like I wish the runtime could be a little longer so we could flesh out some aspects of the film, like Doc Helena, Migs and his dad, and the ending, to name some.Overall, I'm SOO GLAD I saw this film. God PH do the smart move and PLEASE submit this for best international feature at the Oscars.",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine was an entity of her own. As consistent as the celestial body her name was derived from, she was stern on her decision up until the end of the film. The rawness of the film venturing into the the ""sketchy"" streets of Quiapo, digs into shady transactions covered under the mountains of skyways clouded with ignorance over what minorities have to deal with. How does our devotion and concept of purity outweigh the dangers underlying in pregnancy or becoming a mother when one isn't ready to give everything up for a child they bore out of guilt? Or is this just something they choose to turn a blind eye to when the higher-ups knowingly have put women's lives in the gravest situations yet again?Releasing this film in the midst of a conservative country was a bold critique of the proper healthcare we're deprived of, but it was also a cry from all women who deserve better.",20

Sunshine,"DEFINITELY WORTH TALKING ABOUT! Galing ng mga cast, walang tapon.",-1
Sunshine,"let me just say na MARIS RACAL IS SUCH AN AMAZING ACTRESS. totoong haggard nga siya (lol), pero ‘yung haggardness niya, that actually added to everything. you can see the pain, the exhaustion, and the heaviness in every scene—it all felt so real.. grabe, nakakamangha talaga siyang panoorin. sobrang husay niya, and because of that, sunshine didn’t feel like a film at all—it felt like someone letting you into her world. it felt like sunshine was sitting beside me, telling her story, and all i could do was listen and feel everything.from the very beginning, klaro na kay sunshine kung ano ang gusto niya. hindi ang maging nanay, kundi ang makasali sa Philippines' national gymnastics team. but the world she lives in kept pushing her into a corner. this film tackled more than just abortion—it exposed how cruel the system is to women, lalo na sa pilipinas. it showed the weight of religious beliefs forced onto our bodies, the cycle of abuse, and the daily injustices women face just for existing. napakahirap maging babae sa pilipinas tangina.lahat ng lalaki sa pelikula—si miggy, 'yung tito ni menggay, si tatay ni miggy, pati ‘yung doktor—lahat sila, galit na galit ako. bakit babae lagi ang kailangang mag-sakripisyo? bakit babae ang kailangang mag-adjust, magpatawad, magtiis? putangina talaga. and yet, these characters weren’t exaggerated. they were too real. which makes it even more terrifying—kasi alam nating totoo ‘to. it happens. it’s still happening.what haunted me most were menggay’s scenes. dun talaga ako tuluyang naiyak. ang sakit sakit. gusto ko siyang yakapin, gusto ko siyang ipagtanggol. bata pa lang siya pero pasan na niya 'yung bigat ng mundong hindi naman niya kasalanan. sana sa lahat ng menggay, may sunshine sa buhay nila. and then there was anikka. nung una, akala ko multo siya o guni-guni lang. pero habang tumatagal, i realized—she was sunshine’s imaginary child. or maybe her younger self. or both. she represents so much: a lost dream, a piece of sunshine. kaya ‘yung eksena sa dulo, when anikka said “gets ko na,” it wasn’t just her talking—it was also sunshine finally accepting her own decision. grabe ‘yung iyak ko dun. that should be enough. a woman’s choice should be enough.the film also showed that women, at our best, are each other’s safe space. si coach, si doktora, yung kaibigan, most especially ‘yung ate niya—lahat sila, may dalang simpatya. yung presence nila nagsasabing “nandito ako.” yung scene na tumabi yung ate niya sa higaan sobrang nakakalungkot panoorin. it reminded me that the first place we should feel supported is at home. buti na lang at nandiyan ang ate ni sunshine dahil minsan sapat na ‘yung maramdaman mong hindi ka nag-iisasunshine isn’t just a movie. it’s a wake-up call. it asks us to reflect—bakit tayo mabilis humusga? bakit kulang ang pag-unawa? and most of all, bakit kailangang maging matatag ang babae para lang mabuhay nang payapa? sunshine is a beautiful, heartbreaking, and necessary film. hindi lang siya basta panoorin. kailangan mo siyang damdamin. hindi ka niya pipilitin, pero hahayaan ka niyang mag-reflect, in your own time and your own way.huge congratulations to everyone who worked on this film. sana mas maraming makapanood. sana mas maraming makaintindi",-1

Sunshine,"gets kita, sunshine! hindi ko ma-put into words ‘yung naramdaman ko after manood nito. that was just around 5 hours ago, pero hanggang ngayon, nakatulala pa rin ako. parang may mabigat na bumalot sa ‘kin nung lumabas ako sa sinehan. sobrang bigat niya sa pakiramdam all throughout. akala ko hindi ako iiyak. naluluha lang ako kasi kahit ramdom ko ‘yung bigat na dinadala ng mga characters, parang hindi bumabagsak ‘yung luha ko. pero nung tinabihan saka kinausap na siya ng ate niya, doon na bumuhos lahat. tuloy-tuloy hanggang matapos ‘yung pelikula. sobrang maiiyak ka talaga to hear those words from your own family. sunshine needed that support and her ate gave it to her in the most comforting and tender way. feeling ko hindi coherent ‘to. word vomit lang talaga pero kailangan kong ilabas na. hands down sa cinematography. grabeng storytelling. ramdam mo ‘yung lugar sa bawat eksena. rinig mo ‘yung ingay ng paligid, kung paano talaga ang maynila. ‘yung sitsit ng mga matambay na katatakutan mo bilang isang babae. ‘yung masangsang na amoy ng kalsada. bawat shot, pasan mo rin ‘yung bigat na dinadala ng mga karakter. sobrang immersive. sobrang effective ni maris as sunshine. ramdam mo ‘yung desperation niya. na hindi niya gustong maging nanay. na gusto niya lang makamit ‘yung pangarap niya. ang sakit panoorin na alam mong hindi siya masama pero wala siyang choice kung hindi piliin ‘yung pangarap niya. isa sa mga paborito kong elements ng film ay kung paano ito sobrang women-centered. puro babae ‘yung nakapaligid at nakaintindi sa kanya. i love it when women help each other. pero ang sakit din isipin na mga babae lang ang nakaiintindi sa mga pasakit na bitbit ng mga babae. men could never understand the struggle we go through everyday. they don’t understand the pressure society puts on us. tangina nung doctor but that’s another point. the philippines is predominantly a catholic country. sobrang makapamilya. sobrang maka-diyos. kaya ‘yung unang ginawa ni sunshine matapos niyang malaman na buntis siya—pumunta sa simbahan—sobrang telling kung saan siya lumaki. it says so much about how deeply ingrained religion is in our lives. sobrang taboo pa rin talaga ng usapin ng abortion. kesyo hindi makapamilya lalong hindi maka-diyos. pero sana maging legal na ang abortion. sana manaig ang pagiging pro-choice. kung hindi man, don’t demonize those who do. sana wala nang babae ang maghirap nang ganito dahil lang walang legal at ligtas na paraan para magpa-abort sa pilipinas. sana maging komportable na ang masa na pag-usapan ang bagay na ‘to.ngayon pa ata ako maiiyak habang sinusulat ‘to (wow, may feelings!) this is art and art should disturb the masses. salamat, direk tonet. salamat, maris. at salamat sa mga batang nagbigay buhay sa pelikulang ito. ang galing ni annika! sobrang dami ko pang gustong sabihin tungkol sa kanya.

Sunshine,"gets ko naSo many still don’t understand, but it’s enough that some do.This film is brave—fearlessly made, carefully thought out, and clearly crafted from the heart.When I watched it, all I wanted to do was hold Sunshine—hold every Sunshine out there who I know is carrying the weight of this harsh, terrifying society.I still can’t get over the fact that this was shown in Philippine cinemas because, finally, it got the visibility it truly deserves. This is the kind of film the world should see. When I finished watching it, I already knew the state and how our society would portray abortion and how it was always deemed evil and inhumane but after seeing this film, I felt a sense of relief that finally, a film about women, about abortion, about its effects, not just mentally but physically, and how sometimes, we really just have to understand, for who are we to judge someone who really is just fighting to live through and view women in a way that they should be, respected.Even the supporting characters—especially Jennica Garcia—were brilliant. I felt her love for her sister so deeply. Even when Sunshine thought the world had turned its back on her, her sister’s presence was a constant reminder that someone was still there, always beside her, fully aware of the struggles she faced—struggles made heavier because she’s a woman.Also a huge role that was portrayed by Rhed Bustamante. Just, wow. It was a story meant to be told and written. It isn't just fiction it's currently happening today and that's why it should be a story that needed to be shed light on. It was tragic, painful to look at but it was real, all of it, and that's what makes it a story worth telling.And Maris Racal—what a phenomenal actress. Her cries pierce right through you. Her frustration, her courage, her strength as a woman—all of it shines through. In Sunshine, I saw her desperation, her bravery, her womanhood, and her relentless grasp on her dreams, refusing to let them slip away.Maris and Direk Tonet knew exactly what they wanted to tell their audience, and I’m so glad they did it with such courage. They gave voice to women like Sunshine—women who are still too afraid to scream their truths.I hope this film becomes a beacon for people like Sunshine, the way she brings life to every twirl of her ribbon and every movement of her body to the rhythm. There are so many like her still hidden in the shadows of fear and guilt. And yes, we all know that in the Philippines, some mindsets are hard to change—but does it have to stop there? Will we allow people like Sunshine to remain caged by a judgmental society?Maybe for now, it’s hard. But because of this film, women like Sunshine can finally catch a glimpse of hope.:’)",12

Sunshine,Start of my love for Philippine cinema this 2025.,9
Sunshine,"Honestly, 3.5 stars for the movie overall, but here's extra 0.5 star for the super random cameo that was also somehow super on the nose. It's such a good bit that amuses me to no end. I'd rate the movie higher if not for a plot device that felt completely unnecessary and at times distracting. Take it away, and it won't even change anything about the movie. Every time they employed this plot device, it was just so unnecessary and distracting. The movie also squeezed in too many ""unwanted pregnancy"" tropes that it risked being too bloated story-wise. Think of an ""unwanted pregancy"" trope, it's there. They stop short of it being too bloated at the expense of the story (and you have to give it to Antoinette Jadaone for this balancing act), though I still spent a good chunk of the movie wondering how many more tropes were coming. Still the movie is brave, and is made so much better for its bravery. It does not shy away from the realities faced by so many women in this country when it comes to maternal health. It tackled head-on the heavily religious overtones that tends to dominate the conversations around this topic. It shows the ironic juxtaposition of abortion pills being sold next to religious artifacts. But most importantly, it does not get preachy. It does not feel like it is patronizing the audience about what should be in each scene that squeezes your heart, it just shows it. But also Jennica Garcia steals the show in every scene is in. Maris Racal deserves the accolades she's getting for carrying the movie so steadily as its lead and with everything asked of her for the character. But Jennica Garcia just commands every scene even she doesn't say a word. And every scene these two have together was really gold-medal worthy.",-1

Sunshine,"sana marami pa ang makanood nito. tunay nga na ang sining ang sumasalamin sa buhay ng mga tao. eto ang pelikulang kailangan natin ngayon: totoo, mahalaga, may puso, at kailangan pag-usapan. gusto ko lang talaga icommend si maris. tangina, powerhouse performance, sobrang husay. dalang dala nya ang emosyon, karakter, at kwento ng bawat babae—matanda man o bata—na naghahanap ng solusyon sa bansa o komunidad na taliwas dito. yung jeepney scene? grabe. sabi nga nila, masarap maglabas ng nararamdaman tuwing nasa byahe tayo. at saan ba bumabyahe ang mga pangkaraniwang pilipino? sa jeep.ganda ng cinematography. kuhang kuha ang essence ng maynila. bawat eksena ng pelikula ay may laman at kontrobisyon sa karakter at flow ng istorya. sa dinami-dami ng pelikulang pilipino na napanood ko, iisipin ko na napagusapan na lahat ng paksa na maaaring ipakita sa midya. pero, totoong taboo pa rin ang usaping aborsyon dito sa atin dahil tayo ay “religious country”. sana ay maging daan ang pelikulang ito upang mas maging bukas tayong mga pilipino sa pinagdadaanan ng mga kababaihan, at bigyan sila ng karapatan na magdesisyon para sa kanilang sarili at kapakanan. sobrang daming kababaihan ang nakaranas ng naranasan ng karakter ni rhed. kailangan pa ba na mag-agaw buhay para magkaroon ng panibagong pag-asa sa buhay?sobra rin ako naging emosyonal sa last scene ni maris at annika. para sa akin, eto (at ang scene ni maris at jennica) ang nagpakita ng mensahe ng pelikula: pag-unawa. gets ko na is such a short, simple, yet heavy statement for someone who feels hopeless, directionless, and who is going through something that will dictate her whole future. kudos sayo, mom tonet at sa buong produksyon ng pelikula. mabuhay ang pilipinong sining!",-1
Sunshine,"healthcare sa pinas: bulok/10bedside manner nung mga doctor: -1000/10routine ni sunshine francisco: 10s across the boardsacting ni maris: perfect ok seryoso na watching this was such an experience, filipinas deserve better healthcare forreal </3 ok next time na essay ko, makapag aral na nga ko para one day makatulong na ko sa lahat ng sunshine at mary grace ng pelepens TT",3
Sunshine,"syempre maganda, kelan ba ako gumawa ng panget charez",1
Sunshine,"after the movie was done, my younger sister asked me if that ever happens to her, what would i (her older sister) do?""beh gawin mo gusto mo. kahit samahan pa kita""the acting is so so good, the depiction of reality... loud and gritty, and after quite some time seeing movies i can finally fucking hear everything. the sound in this film played a huge huge role so im just rly glad i could hear them properly.but, the fantasy element. i kinda get it but it's sort of corny.anyway it's a brave and beautiful film. it's firm with its stance and i think everyone should see it.",-1
Sunshine,the quiet desperation of being inches away from your dream makes this even more heartbreaking because this kind of story is far from fiction. left the theater in tears!!! grabe please go watch this if you can,-1
Sunshine,"gets na gets, sunshine! nakakalungkot!! nakakagalit!! ang hirap talaga maging babae sa pilipinas kung saan mismong sistema ang humahadlang sa ating desisyon, potensiyal at pangarap. napakahusay mo maris racal and direk antonet jadaone thank you for creating not just a film, but a piece of art that tells the truth—one that filipinos need to see, hear, and reckon with. ika nga ni rachel green “no uterus, no opinion” ",-1
Sunshine,if u didn’t like this film ure misogynistic idk,-1
Sunshine,"if this shares anything with films from ph cinema's golden age, it is a strong thesis statement about manila. a lot has changed since we have moved from one marcos to another, but the power sunshine holds is to choose the one thing that has endured -- belief.driven by ambition, comforted but oppressed by religion, and deceived by folk medicine, sunshine's situation is a product of the convictions of those around her. fact and fiction are difficult to distinguish from her perspective. whether the effectivity of unregulated medication or the potential of an unborn child, a pregnant woman has to deal with the gradient of reality that is muddled by a conservative environment. importantly, sunshine is not a product of circumstance, but an active agent in negotiating her place amid all of it. i have my gripes with the main plot device of her possible unborn children, but i also feel open to interpretations that explain them. this is going to be an important filipino film and its artistry is probably secondary to how it might change views.",-1
Sunshine,"“hindi sapat na ang babae ay maging ina lamang; dapat din siyang maging aktibong bahagi ng pagbabago ng lipunan.”Lualhati Bautistaas a huge believer in “only make art if you have something to say,” jadaone really has something to say. this movie is probably one of the most important filipino films ever made. the sad truth is, it does not exaggerate any details, this is simply the reality of our patriarchal society.but the film’s strength lies not only in its message but also in how it perfectly captures its setting.the movie itself is something that the majority of filipino filmmakers should study, a lino brocka-esque portrayal of the grit of manila: the familiar filipino home interiors, the choice of clothes, the 300 pesos motels, the guilt-tripping sermon from conservative boomers, the religious imagery. every detail, even the smalles rings true and is authentically filipino. this is something that elevates it far above many other modern filipino films.also,  ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE!!!",9
Sunshine,"“gets ko na.”This film clearly shows that it’s usually women who suffer the most and face judgment when it comes to issues like this, especially in countries where it is considered taboo. It also shows the serious and deadly consequences of unsafe abortions in places where legal and safe options are not available na sana gets niyo rin.",-1
Sunshine,Grabe. Teka lang,1
Sunshine,"sincerely, wala akong pakialam sa opinyon ng isang celebrity pero if you somehow walk out of the cinema thinking this film is about ""mental health"", how unfortunate (very reductionist of me to put her point that way pero still, how unfortunate); managed to talk about a topic so difficult to navigate in a predominantly roman catholic country that continually insists that misunderstood scriptures, dated laws, and sexist norms should dictate the choice of a woman over her OWN body; ganda ng visuals and line delivery for the most part",-1
Sunshine,It’s hard being a woman—and this film knows it,-1
Sunshine,"Mahirap tanggapin na ito ang pasanin ng bawat babae sa Pilipinas. Punong-puno ng kontradiksyon ang pundasyon ng pagka-Pilipino natin—mula relihiyon, mga tradisyon at paniniwala, at moralidad. Mapapaisip ka na lang talaga kung ilang Sunshine at Menggay ang nagmumulto sa madidilim, maiingay, at mauusok na mga eskinita sa Maynila.",3
Sunshine,Ang piyesang ito ay para sa mga batang jina,0
Sunshine,tangina niyo talagang mga lalake !!!!!!,-1
Sunshine,"sana naman ma-gets na—or at least mag-start na ng usapan sa topic na to—ng taumbayan kung bakit sobrang mahalaga ang abortion. it’s not a black and white issue kung saan mali na agad siya kasi labag siya sa batas ng diyos. i really loved how the movie was directed; kuhang-kuha talaga yung emosyon ng mga characters pati na rin yung sobrang pagkagulo ng manila. i loved how maris portrayed sunshine. sobrang raw and authentic ng pag-act niya lalo na yung kaba niyang tatanggalin na siya sa roster na nagdulot ng pagkadesperada niyang makaalis sa sitwasyong iyon para makamit yung mga pangarap niya. to all the sunshines out there, i see you. gets ko kayo, at sana maging tulay ang sunshine sa pagsimula ng diskusyon sa topic ng abortion para tuluyan ninyong makamit ang inyong mga pangarap.",6
Sunshine,gave Fil movies a chance again and wow!!! that ending was NOT disappointing peroidt,-1
Sunshine,"ok naman i might edit this review on a later date if i ever change my mind there are some parts that are iffy, especially that one scene where i can hear confusion among other audiences: what's happening is obvious, i clocked it at the first instance, but the execution is a bit ""??"" and yes yes manila masulasok masikip maingay whatever. the highlight of this film is its ending, which i thought is the only possible ending for the…",-1
Sunshine,i wanna hug sunshine so bad :(( this is my barbie,2
Sunshine,"this just supported and strengthened my stance as a pro-choice. i believe a woman must have the freedom to choose what to do with their own body as we're not the one experiencing what they're going through bearing that unborn child of them. kudos to maris for portraying her role so well, and to sunshine for being so brave to choose herself and pursue her dreams first despite knowing she might be judged by other people for what she did.definitely an eye opening film especially for close minded ppl here in PH ",34
Sunshine,salamat sa matapang na pagkwento direk!! gets na gets ko na,0
Sunshine,get u someone that looks at you the same way antoinette jadaone's camera looks at female characters,1
Sunshine,no words. basta umiyak lang ako sa gilid literally,0
Sunshine,the choices that we have is we have no choice,-1
Sunshine,"pinakamalaking plot twist ay makita na si rico blanco ang scorer ng pelikula,, thank you for this movie, papa god",-1
Sunshine,"tama na sa conservative at patriarchal na pag-iisip, give the women access to quality healthcare.",4
Sunshine,"incredibly well acted and the story is so important :,) loved it",-1
Sunshine,don't say bad words... putangina ang ganda!!,-1
Sunshine,"Gets ko na.OH my god, my tears!!!  Thank universe for giving us Direk Toñet!!!Bilang isang lalaking lumaki sa paligid ng mga kababaihan, mahalaga sa akin na makapanuod ng pelikulang sentro sila bilang mas naiintindihan ko ang mga danas & pinagdadaanan nila.Maris & Direk Tonet, we're getting you that oscars awow hahahaPS. Sobrang naappreciate ko ang Sunshine bilang napanuod ko ang episode ng AWKP na guest si Maris. I recommend that you watch it too.",-1
Sunshine,Tangina mo rin,19
Sunshine,makatwiran,1
Sunshine,We're so lucky that we have someone like Antoinette Jadaone who's unafraid to depict something so raw and important. A step towards the right direction and a beacon of light to the discourse. Hoping for women to finally have the safe abortion choices they deserve. <3,5
Sunshine,"The best Filipino film of the year so far. Perhaps also the best locally made sports drama in recent memory. No glitz and glamor and just plainly focused on the realities and internal struggles of athletes. The vision and the photography of the film is on point. Pinoy na pinoy ang atake, lalo na 'yung mga shots sa Quiapo at Avenida. Hindi rin 'to natakot talakayin ang issues ng teenage pregnancy, abortion, toxic religiosity, incest, matinding kahirapan at kabulukan ng sistema ng health care sa bansa.The best part of the film? Maris Racal! Grabe! Give her a role, enough time, and she can do anything! That performance towards the end shows how she worked hard to emulate a rhythmic gymnast, to perform the craft assigned to her. Obviously, the most dedicated, if not the best, actress of this generation. 'Di masyadong sikat, walang masyadong top billing pero wala kang masasabi pagdating sa galing at puso sa bawat role na binibigay sa kanya.",9
Sunshine,"the most relevant filipino film this 2025!everything about this film felt raw, honest, and real. from the acting to the cinematography, every scene felt intentional. the desperation, fear, and guilt in that one jeepney scene really sums up the struggle, shame, and mistreatment that many young women have to face due to the carelessness of men. this film is also proof on how growing up in a country with predominantly very catholic christian views affects the way that we feel about certain choices that we make; kahit na kinakailangan talaga nating gawin. kaya bago bumili si Sunshine ng kailangan niyang bilhin sa quiapo, humingi muna siya ng patawad kay Lord. overall, a film that caters to many young women—like Sunshine, who just wants to reach the dream she has been working on her whole life in spite of systemic barriers and cultural expectations imposed by a country that values religious beliefs over a woman’s right to autonomy. gets ko na, Sunshine.",-1
Sunshine,"from her wardrobe colors down to each and every vital experience that sunshine went through, this film bled womanhood. hindi lang tungkol sa sensitibong tema na tinatalakay; tungkol mismo sa choice. choice na magpatuloy, choice na sumuporta, choice na magalit. ng mga karakter at maging ng manonood. una pa lang, nasabi kong extension ng identity ni sunshine ‘yung bata. her unborn child. hindi nito hangad mangumbinsi. hangad nitong magpaunawa. sana sa pamamagitan ng mga ekstensibong diskusyon, mapukaw tayong umaksyon tungkol…",30
Sunshine,good for her!,-1
Sunshine,"Gets ba bakit ang hirap hirap maging babae sa mundong to? Like men get to enjoy the pleasures of life without a single care kasi una, wala silang iniintindihing consequences. Hindi naman sila mabubuntis, hindi naman nila kailangan pagdaanan ang grueling 9 months ng pagdadalang tao at dahil don, hindi rin nila kailangang isuko or isantabi ang mga opportunities in life. They can go and live their normal lives as usual. Tapos pangalawa, kapag babae ang nabuntis, lahat ng sisi, kahihiyan, at pressure sa kanya agad. Hindi nila mararamdaman yung guilt, yung takot, yung burden kasi hindi naman sila shinashame ng lipunan gaya ng pagshame sa kababaihan.ewan puro galit at sakit naramdaman ko sa film na to bukod sa walang proper healthcare for women at napakalalang religious influences sa pilipinas, parang awang awa ako saming mga kababaihan na para bang hindi talaga magegets ng mga lalaki yung danas at hirap magiging babae sa lipunang to.",3
Sunshine, hirap maging gurlie in da pilipins,-1
Sunshine,post upcat breakdown pala to,1
Sunshine,"i didn’t know na the simple “gets ko na” line will have me almost crying sa sinehan. oa na kung oa pero GETS NA GETS KO. it lands because the whole film builds up to it, this idea that women are constantly being misunderstood, questioned, doubted. and then one woman looks at another, sees her pain, and simply says, “gets ko na.” that’s the most powerful kind of solidarity. not saving someone. not preaching to them. just understanding them. the female relationships were the heart of it. hindi romantic love ang source of salvation dito. women helping women, women understanding women, yun ang lifeline ni sunshine. and that, to me, is what makes the movie not just brave, but also beautiful.one of the boldest things sunshine did was not moralize. a lesser film might’ve gone down the typical route— punishing the character for her sins, forcing her into regret, or ending with her back in the cycle of poverty because she “deserved” it. sunshine rejects that. it gives her space to want more, unapologetically. that is, in itself, revolutionary kasi sanay tayong makita ang kababaihan na laging martyr, laging nagpapaubaya, laging umiiyak sa ending habang umaandar ang jeep, but here? we get a girl who simply chooses her self. and that should never have to be a radical act but in our context, it is. because we glorify mothers, “ilaw ng tahanan,” “walang katulad ang pagmamahal ng ina”, pero the moment a woman says that she's not ready for the role, she’s shamed. our culture wants motherhood without giving women the right to choose it.",30
Sunshine,Omg super ganda! Galing din ni Maris! Tho nakakainis yung crowd sa sine lol shoutout sainyo SM San Lazaro ka weird niyo like wtf tumatawa kapag pinapangaralan si Maris like wtf (doctor & piolo scene) anong nakakatawa don?,0
Sunshine,"“oo, gets ko na.”",18
Sunshine,"and when a system of laws, religion, and society plays repression towards women at its core, they are left optionless but to reach the edges—even the roughest ones. this is starkly and assertively depicted in sunshine as it alludes to the fact that although customs and policies are purposed to save, they may also be they very waters that drown us.and that sequence with the pastor? very nuanced. so good. goes to show how the patriarchy and the church always find ways, direct or indirect, to monopolize women's choices and liberty. in one way or another, we are sunshine.",28
Sunshine,"omg this is the kind of film i want every filipino girl and woman to watch even just once in their lifetime. was it heavy-handed? yes! but the kind that needs to be for our pseudo-conservative society. maris racal is truly a gem, and omg jennica garcia slayy.besides the messaging and theme, god i love how alive the setting is! i’m so partial to it as a manila girlie - like this is how the normal filipina lives.: Cinema 7, SM City North Edsa: Quezon City, Metro Manila: with little sister",9
Sunshine,"it was an experience. it was a protest for every ""Sunshine"" in this society. a must-watch film!",-1
Sunshine,gets na gets,-1
Sunshine,"""gets ko na"" – who would've thought na yung halos araw-araw kong binibitawang mga salita without much weight would lift so much heaviness off my chest? it was so simple pero sobrang gandang line to conclude it, especially after nung scene niya with her ate. kasi throughout the movie, it felt like she only had herself to deal with her unwanted pregnancy. na parang walang makakagets sa kanya if she chooses to abort it. naghahanap din ako ng kakampi niya.…",-1
Sunshine,wait tulala pa ako,1
Sunshine,"i dont fucking know kung ano ba gusto patunayan ng bansang 'to at ayaw pa gawing legal ang aborsyon. y does it insist on controlling womens bodies while failing to provide the systems that actually support life?? hello sex edu? hello accessible healthcare?? ang tapang ng pelikulang to, it captures the reality face by so many women in the ph.abortion should be an option. motherhood should be a choice, not an obligation, not a punishment. lahat ng babae deserves the right to decide what happens to her body, her future, her life. i love you sunshine.",4
Sunshine,Ganda parin. That scene with Jennica is still so beautiful.,10
Sunshine,very women empowering,7
Sunshine,"first, maris racal—- amazing acting!!i love how the movie is not explicitly pro choice or pro life, but more of a mirror to show the ugly reality of abortion in the countryi just wish that the metaphor in the film landed better— felt like the emotional arc was a bit underdeveloped and lacked some sort of catharsis (huh)",5
Sunshine,"Simple ang kwento ni sunshine pero masalimuot ang pinanggagalingan, it takes courage and compassion to share such a tormenting issue about womanhood. Ito ang tunay na pemenistang pelikula",7
Sunshine,"ok ito na ang review ko na hindi naman ganun ka-relevant (???) CHARpero kailangan ko lang ‘to ilabas before anything else: maris racal is THE doja cat of the philippines, controversial-wise. bakit? GIRL… kasi kahit anong gawin ni maris na “cancellable”, hindi talaga siya ma-cancel because she’s just THAT good. GETS BA!!! pruweba lang ‘to na ang cancel culture ay hindi totoo… chrue?OK ITO NA TALAGA. this is it.mula sa pinanood ko, hindi lang basta-bastang pelikula ang sunshine. given na ‘yung magandang konsepto, storyline, casting, at setting ng pelikula pero gusto ko lang mas i-highlight ‘yung fact na kahit ba sobrang taboo ng “abortion” topic sa pilipinas, direk tonet did what NEEDS to be done and i mean, talk about IT. sa malawak na masang pilipino, kailangan nilang maintindihan na hindi pwedeng tanggapin na lamang ng bawat babaeng maagang nabuntis na dadalhin nila ito hanggang sa mabuhay ang sanggol. hindi. kasi may mas malawak pang diskusyon labas sa pagbubuntis at ito ang kapalpakan ng sistemang kinagisnan ng karamihan.kung maglalaan ng oras ang administrasyon sa pag-aaral hinggil sa kahalagahan ng abortion sa pilipinas, mas gagaan ang buhay ng bawat pilipinang maagang nabuntis. gaya ni sunshine, hindi na nila kailangan pang dumaan sa peligrosong proseso upang ipalaglag ang pagdadalang-tao nila dahil aksisable, at ligal na ito. pero sa lagay ng bansa natin ngayon, mukhang wala pa tayo sa kalingkingan ng pagsasabatas nito dahil tila mangmang ang mga mambabatas na iniluklok sa pwesto. malayo pa ang tatahakin ng bawat pilipino sa lipunang patuloy na binubura ang mga progresibo pero ang mga pelikula gaya ng sunshine, ay isa lamang sa maraming paraan upang manghamig, magmulat, at pakilusin ang masang patuloy na inaapi laban sa mapanamantalang sistema na kinalakihan natin.suportahan natin ang mga lokal na pelikula. suportahan natin ang larangan ng sining. suportahan natin ang sariling atin.#MakeAbortionLegal #AbortionIsNotMurder",0
Sunshine,Life changing & still speechless,-1
Sunshine,"It’s been a while since I last watched a movie alone. I actually asked my partner first if it was okay to watch Sunshine without him—he’s not really into Filipino films, and I totally respect that. But something about this movie pulled me in.And I’m glad I watched it. Sunshine shook me. It’s not just a film—it’s a mirror of what’s really happening around us. It hit hard, especially thinking about those who’ve gone through abuse—women, children, even the ones who never had the courage to speak up.Sure, there were a few funny scenes—maybe to ease the weight of the story—but the truth behind it stays. It’s heavy, it’s real, and it’s heartbreaking.We can’t just look away anymore. These kids and young women who’ve lived through this kind of nightmare… they need to be seen, heard, and protected. Because maybe—we are their last hope. And that means something.",12
Sunshine,galing tangina,19
Sunshine,"This film truly moved me—it powerfully portrays the harsh reality of the Philippines’ current stance on abortion. The line “gets ko na” struck me deeply; it’s both empowering and eye-opening. Every woman in the country should see this, as it sheds light on the difficult experiences many go through. The story is raw, relevant and it is worth talking about. It’s a bold feminist film that reminds us we all sunshine in our own unique ways and we continue to wait for sunshine. Every woman has the right to make decisions about her body and her future. Thank you so much, Direk Tonet, for creating this important piece.",-1
Sunshine,"Ang husay!!!That was my first thought after the credits rolled. Every cast member acted so well, but Maris really carried it. Nothing felt performed. She was just there, fully present in every scene. Manila looked exactly how we know it. Crowded, humid, alive, and heavy.Sceeenplay wise, it was honest and not trying hard. A lot of those lines I’ve heard in real conversations. It just shows you what it’s like to be a woman in this country with no access to reproductive rights and safe and legal abortion. I hope Sunshine helps start more open and honest conversations. Reproductive health is still treated like something dirty in the PH. Women suffer quietly, and most people pretend not to see.The story is simple, but the path it takes is so clear. From beginning to end, it doesn’t stray. I was honestly scared it would compromise somewhere along the way, but it didn’t. It stayed brave.Antoinette Jadaone, you are so brave!!! Seriously. It takes guts to make something like this here. Thank you for telling this story, and for telling it without fear. ",-1
Sunshine,So much better on second viewing.,24
Sunshine,"Sunshine sa Kuko ng MaynilaKasama ng mga pelikulang may “maynila” sa titulo na kamakailan ko lang napanood, bukod sa pagpupunit ng bandila ng konserbatibong paniniwala na nagmula sa kristiyanismo, pinapakita din ng Sunshine ang siyudad ng Maynila sa gabi—kung saan imbes na pag-asa, sumpa ang pangunahing kaluluwa na hinihinga’t tinitiis ng mga mamamayan. Sa labas ng simbahan makikita ang mga illegal na medesinang pampalaglag na nagsisilbi bilang pagasa para sa maraming kababaihan marahil ang institusyon sa harapan ng mga tindahang ito, ang simbahan, ang may kapangyarihan kahit na sabihing progresibo na ang mga paniniwala ng tao. Sa isang eksena, si Sunshine ay nagbuwis buhay sa isang masikip na motel sa Avenida, dala dala ang boteng pampalaglag, nagdudugo, nanghihingalo palabas habang patuloy ang pagtakbo ng LRT, at nagising nalang sa ospital, puno ng mga babaeng tinitiis ang hindi makataong pampublikong pasilidad.Halos 500 teenager ang nagiging ina araw araw. Kung legal lamang ang pagpapalaglag, ang mga numerong ito’y mababawasan. Isa sa may pinaka mabigat na istorya ay ang karakter ni Rhed Bustamante na si Menggay, isang 13 taong gulang na binuntis ng kaniyang tito. Kaniyang sinusundan si Sunshine at ibang mga babae, upang humingi ng pampalaglag. Nililibot niya ang Maynila na may tiyang di nararapat para sa isang dalaga. Tulad ni Sunshine, si Menggay ay pinadala rin sa ospital. Ngunit di natin siyang nakitang gumising. Ang pelikula ni Jadaone ay paniguradong titignan ng mga iskolar bilang “classic” makalipas ang ilang taon, tulad ng Manila by Night at Maynila Sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag. Isa sa mga susi ng pagtatagumpay ng storyang ito ay naiintindihan nito ang mga karakter na kinekwento bilang mga tao at hindi lamang teksto. Madaling tapusin ang mga pelikulang may realismo sa trahedya ngunit hindi pinili ni Jadaone ang direksyong iyon. Ang titulong “Sunshine” ay sumisimbolo rin sa diwa ng Pilipino—madalas masiyahin at nakakahanap pa rin ng ilaw sa madidilim na eskenita, matatatag (o resilient). Dahil tayo’y kilala sa ganitong paraan, madali tayong abusuhin ng ating gobyerno. Labag raw sa batas ng diyos ang pagpapalaglag ng bata ngunit sa ganitong pagiisip, sa pagproprotekta ng mga hindi pa naisisilang, pinapatay ang ating mga kababaihan. Ngunit isa sa mga ipinakita sa pelikulang ito ay ang mga babae na nakikiramay kay Sunshine, kahit man ito’y makulit na bata, o kapatid na nagsilbing nanay, o kahit mga babae sa post maternal ward na nakakaintindi ng sakit na nadarama ng karakter ni Maris Racal at ang mga Sunshine sa Pilipinas. Mahaba pa ang magiging lakbay patungo sa bansang kayang tumanggap na isang karapatan ng babae ang awtonomiya ng kaniyang katawan, ngunit sa pelikulang ito, at sa pagdami ng mga manonood, nagkakaroon ng espayo upang magbukas ang mga usaping tinuturing “taboo”.",3
Sunshine,"tight hugs, for all of the sunshines out there.",2
Sunshine,"This is the kind of film I want to see.I had huge expectations for this movie before I came to the theater to watch it, and it did not at all disappoint. It didn’t, in any way, fall short of anything I hoped for. From the direction to the casting, sobrang ganda… and I wish I were exaggerating.Una, Antoinette Jadaone, what a director you are. Throughout the movie, the words “Ang galing” kept escaping my mouth. The camera angles were beautiful, the timing of the sound production was marvelous, the screenplay was solid—everything was on point. Sunshine satisfied my standards for aesthetics when it comes to film.Pangalawa, Maris. Hands down—sobrang talentadong babae talaga. Setting her issue aside, she’s a versatile actress. She embodied Sunshine so well that I felt myself completely absorbed in the story. Dagdag pa riyan si Jennica Garcia, another golden star. I knew her through Saving Grace, and doon pa lang, sobrang namangha na ako sa kakayahan niya. I need to see her in more films. Halos lahat naman kung tutuusin—they have done a tremendous job with their performances. Everything felt so real.Pangatlo, the script? Hello? Ang natural. It wasn’t like her other directed movie, Uninvited, na puro mura. This time, it was profanity with purpose. (haha) The lines were written and delivered so well that it made me stop and think how observing plays such a vital role in every profession. Lalo na rito. Kaya tagos sa puso, kasi totoo. Nangyayari ‘to.At panghuli, the hidden message. In every movie, I like to believe that there’s at least a little advocacy screaming through every minute. In this case, it’s the consideration of legalizing abortion in the Philippines. Maraming mga hindi kayang bumuhay ng anak, mga hindi kayang sustentahan ang isang tao, at mga taong sinamantala lamang. Even with these reasons, is it still not right to consider abortion? One might counter, “Pwede mo namang ipaalaga sa kamag-anak o sa mga magulang.” But the truth is: life is much more complex than that. It is so much more complicated because there are cases like this in real life, where the only family they have is their siblings... Some only have themselves.…Hays, basta abstinence talaga dapat guys!I love everything about this movie. I love how it depicts the reality some pregnant teenagers go through—even those who have dreams. I believe I have more to say, but I’d like to reflect on that myself. Just keep a bit of Sunshine all to me.That's how deeply it hit me.",-1

Sunshine,"late na review kasi putangina ang tagal nitong nasa isip ko pagkatapos naming panoorin.ngayon lang ulit ako nakakita ng ganito ka-grounded at ka-totoong portrayal ng totoong maynila sa contemporary philippine cinema. madalas kasi sa mapapanood mo ngayon ay kung hindi pinapaganda, nagiging palamuti lang o para bang wala lang talagang papel yung maynilang ginagalawan ng mga karakter ng pelikula.pero dito sa maynila ni tonet jadaone, kita, at rinig mo lahat. siguro isa pang dahilan kung bakit malakas tama sa'kin nito kasi ito yung mga naririnig ko araw-araw: yung napakaingay na tunog ng lrt, yung mga jeep na sasabog na sa lakas ng tugtog (kahit music taste ko naman yung mga kanta xD), at yung samu't-saring mga usapan ng mga taong kagaya mo na naglalakad sa maynila.sobrang ingat din ng pagkaka-handle sa isyu ng abortion at women's healthcare in general. walang pananaw na nilagay sa ""bad light,"" pero may reyalidad na ipinakita at ipinaintindi, ang reyalidad ng mga babaeng katulad ni sunshine. ang ganda rin na hindi lang reaktib si sunshine sa mga nangyayari sa kanya, meron siyang sariling pangarap, meron siyang sariling desisyon, at meron siyang gagawin sa mga problema niya kahit na para bang lahat ng nakapalibot sa kanya ay pursigidong kontrolin ang buhay niya o diktahan ito nang naaayon sa kagustuhan nila.maganda yung pelikula, oo, pero para sa'kin, mas may bigat ang kahalagahan nito: sobrang laki ng magiging (at nagiging) papel nito upang magpatuloy ang diskurso sa isyu ng women's rights, abortion, at women's bodily autonomy sa lahat ng lebel ng lipunan. hindi man ito ang puno't-dulo ng usapin, masasabi kong isa ito sa mga may kakayahang magtulak ng lipunan natin sa tamang landas. salamat, direk tonet at salamat, sunshine. sana magets na nilang lahat.",-1

Sunshine,i was so happy to have both of the girls alive and child free at the end of the movie,-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine.Akala mo pabebe title. Pero nope.Pinasabog ako emotionally. Walang pasintabi.At this point, masasabi ko na isa ito sa mga pinakamagandang pelikulang Pilipinong napanood ko. Walang pilit na patawa. Walang palamig. May saysay, may sipa, at may kirot na hindi mo pwedeng balewalain. May mga eksenang uncomfortable pero kailangan.Kasi minsan, ang totoong kwento, hindi masarap panoorin.Pero dapat.The storytelling?Putcha. Tahimik pero mabangis. Hindi ito yung tipo ng pelikula na sasabihin sa’yo kung ano ang tama o mali. Ipapakita lang niya tapos bahala ka sa internal crisis mo after. May bits na parang sinaksak ka sa puso pero may ngiti ka pa rin sa labi. Kasi ganon katalino ang pagkakasulat. Simple lang ang galaw ng camera, pero lahat ng eksena may laman. Lahat ng katahimikan, may sigaw.Maris Racal bilang Sunshine?Grabe. Ang natural. Parang hindi umaarte, pero ramdam mo bawat pikit, bawat buntong-hininga, bawat patak ng luha.And for the rest of the cast?Jennica, Meryll, Elijah, Annika, Rhed. Kung may acting Olympics, podium lahat ‘to.And the themes?Feminism na hindi lecture. Commentary na hindi sermon. May mga eksenang tatahimik ka after. Yung tipong mapapaisip ka: “Shit. Ako ba ‘yung pinatatamaan?” Oo, bes. Tayong lahat. Kasi lahat tayo may ambag sa double standards na tinotolerate natin araw-araw.Hindi ito ‘yung tipong pelikulang minadali. Sunshine is crafted, not just created.Hindi lang siya ginawa para may mapanood. Sunshine is a film that meant something and moved with purpose.Hindi siya sumisigaw ng “tignan mo ako.” Pero hindi mo rin siya kayang i-ignore. It sits with you. Stays with you. Makes you ask things you usually avoid.At sa ending, walang fireworks. Walang dramatic breakdown, walang moral lesson na pilit. Pero andun yung bigat. Yung linaw. Yung paninindigan.Sunshine made a choice: tahimik, matatag, at alam niyang hindi lahat makakaintindi. Pero hindi rin niya kailangang ipaliwanag. Katawan niya ’yon. Buhay niya ’yon.At sa pagpili niya, may kirot, oo. Pero may ginhawa rin. May lungkot, pero may pag-asa. Kasi for once, isang babaeng Pilipina ang pinayagang pumili para sa sarili niya, at hindi siya pinarusahan.Hindi siya ginawang trahedya.Ginawa siyang posibilidad.At sana mas dumami pa ang ganitong kwento, yung mga kwentong hindi sinusukat sa sakripisyo kundi sa kalayaan. Yung mga babaeng hindi inaasahang sumunod, kundi tinuturuang magtanong ng: “Ano ba talaga ang gusto ko? At handa ba akong ipaglaban ito?”Because at the end of the day, whether it’s about your career, your body, or your future, ikaw dapat ang may final say. Hindi ang mundo. Hindi ang ingay. Hindi ang kahon na kung saan gusto nilang ipagsiksikan ka.Kung saan ka masaya, kung saan ka buo, doon ka tama.",3

Sunshine,An eye-opener! This is Maris’ best! Mahusay!,10
Sunshine,"to live in a society where your most personal decisions are controlled by external forces and outdated structures… it’s exhausting.after watching the film today, i found myself deep in thought as i left the cinema. it was so real and raw. like, genuinely, an eye-opener. the film just beautifully, but also painfully, shows how interconnected everything is. your sex education, or lack thereof, impacts your healthcare system access, your personal moral compass, and of course, your dreams and your passion. it really hit home how incredibly hard it is to be a woman especially here in the philippines, with all our deeply ingrained religious beliefs, particularly around topics like abortion. it’s just so disheartening to hear all the harsh opinions and these strong pushes for anti-abortion laws, especially when they come from people who aren't personally dealing with those difficult, life-altering situations. it’s so easy for some to just state an anti-abortion stance, but the reality for a woman wrestling with such a complex decision is so much more nuanced and personal.you hear it all the time: choosing to terminate a pregnancy is selfish. but then i genuinely wonder, isn't it also selfish to bring a child into the world if you're not fully ready, or if you're uncertain about the future that motherhood brings? in a country that can be so conservative, we really, really need a broader, more compassionate discussion. we need to figure out how to support women and their choices, whatever they may be. not all women want to be mothers. not all women want to be impregnated. even i, personally, don't want to be a mother. and that's okay. it’s time we should be open to talking about these topics, really opening up our minds, and stop letting our religious beliefs completely go into our way of empathy and understanding. this movie just amplified that for me. ang galing galing mo, maris.",-1
Sunshine,"an anecdote that nobody asked for: i vividly remember my sixth grade homeroom class, sinabihan kami ng adviser namin na mali magpalaglag, kasi “hindi mo matatama ang isang pagkakamali sa paggawa ng isa pang pagkakamali”. it’s been engrained in our heads and taught to us that abortion is wrong. i didn’t even have the time back then to question it kasi ‘yun yung sinasabi ng lahat ng adults around me, and eto na yung tinuturo sa atin even at a young age. having a film like Sunshine is so important, it sparks a conversation that we couldn’t have before because it was such a taboo topic.separate na character ang maynila sa pelikulang ‘to. ramdam ko kasama ko rin si sunshine na naglalakad pa-quiapo also te sobrang affected talaga ako sa scenes with maris and jennica like GRABE LANG… the scene sa taxi when sunshine was leaning on her big sister, wala pa silang sinasabi tumutulo na luha ko. pati nung tinabihan ni jennica si maris sa kama, the sisterly bond was something i didn’t see coming kuhang kuha talaga ako watched this in cinemas with my tita, who’s like a mother to me. it meant a lot that i got to experience it with her :)",4
Sunshine,"at dahil diyan, eto ang score mo ",21
Sunshine,"wait walang tumatayo sa sinehan lahat umiiyak alas onse na ng hating gabi edit: ok so nakauwi na ko and here’s my mantra throughout the film: MARIS YOURE A STAR, YOURE A STAR MARIS YOURE A STAR!hindi ko inexpect na ganon kalala yung effect sa akin nung pelikula. grabeng emosyon. kuhang kuha mo ko direk, kuhang kuha mo ‘ko! kuhang kuha ni direk yung repleksyon mula sa lipunang kung saan ang kababaihan ay walang pasya sa kanilang buhay. kuhang kuha ni elijah canlas (at ni papa p putangina lahat kami nagulat ANG GUWAPO TALAGA, tsaka yung lecheng doctor) ang pika ko, hipocrisy ng mga kristyano. at syempre si maris. masyadong ginalingan ni maris.

Sunshine,such an immersive experience that i too was stressed the whole time while watching  and when i tell you the collective gasp in the cinema when papa p came on  i think that was the only time i got to catch my breath but that also did not last long  such an important story to tell that was handled with so much care. im so glad this film exists.,-1
Sunshine,"I was speechless after the film... I was actually nervous as I watched this together with my mom and aunt knowing their religious stance, but was amazed that I got a positive outlook on the movie from them. First off, Maris Racal's portrayal of Sunshine is so good. Everything was perfect — the set, the cast, and the story itself. The film did not just tackle teenage pregnancy; it also bravely portrayed the two sides of the story of women…",-1
Sunshine,"Ang pinakanagustuhan ko sa Sunshine ay yung tapat na kwinento ang karanasan ng mga kababaihan, lalo na ng mga batang babae, sa bulok na healthcare dito sa Pilipinas na hindi tayo binibigyan ng kalayaan para makapili. Hindi ito paligoy-ligoy, at ang galing ni Maris sa kanyang ginampanan na papel bilang bida - na mas lalo ko pang naappreciate dahil sa pagparticipate nya sa pagkausap ng mga babaeng nakaranas nito sa realidad.Sana marami pang makanood nito. Sana, balang araw, may kalayaan na ang mga Sunshine sa Pilipinas para makapili at maalagaan ng sistemang may pakialam.",3
Sunshine,a real horror film for every filipina who starts to have their period,-1
Sunshine,"This movie hunts me in every way, I hope I was there for my sister when she was sunshine, THE GUILT!",-1
Sunshine,"although i already knew what the premise of the movie was, sobrang emotional pa rin nung dating nung intro sakin. it opened with Sunshine performing her gymnastics routine almost flawlessly tapos maya-maya, it was immediately revealed that she was pregnant. knowing all this beforehand didn't lessen the impact of the intro scene for me - my heart broke for her all the same. living in an extremely conservative country with an extremely poor healthcare system is a nightmare especially for people like Sunshine. where the only choices are to carry on with the pregnancy or risk going through an unsafe abortion - she will get judged either way.another thing that i liked was the kid's character. she can be interpreted in many ways - some say she is Sunshine's what if but i interpreted her as Sunshine's conscience. in the early parts of the movie, she was discouraging Sunshine from going through with her plan but eventually came at peace with Sunshine's decisions by the end of the movie. for me, she was also a manifestation of Catholic guilt - something that most of us carry since we grew up in a religious country. the things she says to Sunshine is exactly the kind of thoughts you would think of when deciding on something that is against the principles you grew up with.surely, this movie will become something that starts a discussion on the sensitive topics it tackled - para sa mga taong nagdadawang-isip pa sa pagiging pro-choice, sa mga taong sinsubukang intindihin yung mga pro-choice, at para sa mga taong katulad ni Sunshine.i just hope that people with more conservative views can watch this para naman maintindihan nila yung point ng mga nasa kabilang side ng diskursong ito.",-1
Sunshine,they should hang this in the louvre,1

Sunshine,"like can we talk about the political and economic state of our world? what and amazing performance from maris racal, one might say redeeming.. but wow she really made me feel all the feels. sunshine is emotionally poignant, it's silly moments are all-too familiar yet so are its scenes of desperation and sadness (and looking to tiktok for [redacted] lol). sobbed all the way through that ending man, what a movie.",-1
Sunshine,"In a nutshell, this film reflects how us, as a nation, often fail to protect our own people, because of deeply rooted religious beliefs that act like invisible strings pulling us away from real progress. It exposes the irony of our society, which openly profess religiosity, yet we secretly tolerate and practice things that contradict those beliefs. Using Quiapo, Manila as the backdrop of the movie is really perfect, because the place embodies the chaos, contradictions, and disorganization that mirror…",-1
Sunshine,"Brave and beautiful. May paninindigan at may puso.Gets ko, matagal na. Sana, sa kwento ni Sunshine, magets na rin ng iba.",0
Sunshine,"it was fast paced, pero i think that’s just enough to deliver the message of the movie. tangina talaga sa mga lalaki na tumatakbo sa responsibilidad dahil ‘di naman sa tiyan nila. deserve ‘yung nabasagan ng red horse sa ulo!!‘yung scene na ginagawa niya na ‘yung full routine, nakapaganda.",6

Sunshine,"i had high(er) hopes for the film, but i'm glad we're finally giving issues like these spaces for us to discuss them. i'm really glad that we're taking this seriously in philippine media, lalo na't tinatakot tayo ng mga religious groups. also, incredible acting from maris and jenica! nanghinayang lang ako sa paggamit ng dalawang imaginary na bata to spoonfeed the audience. mas nabigyan ng emphasis yung buhay nung dalawa kaysa kay maris at sa kaibigan niya. feeling ko rin…",-1

Sunshine,Ang fucked up ng buhay ng character ni rhed #LegalizeAbortionNOW,-1

Sunshine,pangarap ko na rin ang mga pangarap mo sunshine!!!,0
Sunshine,"“Saan ka pupunta?”—Di ko alam.“Mahirap ’yan. Tumatakbo at hindi alam kung saan ang pupuntahan.”These words pierce through the screen because they echo the confusion and helplessness felt by so many young women who were never taught what to do, only what not to become.The film refuses to sensationalize and instead, it exposes how a girl’s so-called mistake (often rooted not in her choices but in a partner’s negligence or acts of abuse) can lead to an avalanche of lost dreams, happiness, and possibility. Sunshine becomes every girl who was failed by sex education, every young woman silenced by stigma, and every teenager blamed instead of held.Running beneath the narrative is a critique of the Philippine healthcare system. Sunshine does not receive proper maternal support. She is not offered structured care, options, or safe counseling. Instead, she moves through her pregnancy in silence guided only by whispered advice, black market pills, and the cold gaze of people. Clinics do not offer refuge, hospitals feel clinical in the worst way. Rushed. Underfunded. Emotionally vacant. Healthcare here is not healing but a trauma repackaged as procedure.What I find striking is how the film threads the idea of stigma into the structure itself. It’s the system. How fear, silence, and judgment strip away any chance for recovery, much less dignity. And this is where Sunshine dares to challenge its viewers. The existence of this movie forces a confrontation. Sunshine doesn’t preach, but it demands to be seen. It tells the story of a girl who chose herself. In a world that expected her to stop, she kept going, and that choice changed everything.“Naiintindihan mo na ba ako?”—Gets ko na.",-1
Sunshine,"high school pregnancy, big dreams, and a whole future ahead. melo: 3/5 rating kasi parang kulang ng something??? hindi masyadong napag usapan yung sitwasyon. No great emotions were portrayed [pertaining to the issue itself not sa actress, but on another note, Maris Racal could’ve done a bit more with the acting, I think. Super galing with the ribbon routines tho!]. big deal sya but she chose not to address the issue.me: she didn’t address the issue bc she is NOT ALLOWED to. That’s the whole point. Abortion is stigmatized, which doesn’t give girls much of a choice but to stay silent and afraid and ashamed. The church condemns it, and the government couldn’t care less.*long discussion ensued* agreed with him sa part ng kids tho, pwede pa pigain yung moral guilt and inner conscience entity to spark bigger debate. lol.pero ang gandaa overall! v v poignant film. so happy I got to watch this in the cinemas ",-1
Sunshine,mga miggy/miguel nga naman,-1
Sunshine,- ABANTE BABAE- sobrang galing ni maris grabe- salot talaga sa lipunan mga lalake- i really appreciate na na-touch on din ng sunshine yung malaking cases ng pedophilia sa pilipinas- patay*n na yang mga lalake na yan,3
Sunshine,"this film is so real—nakita ko sa bawat lugar na pinupuntahan ni Sunshine kung gaano kahirap maghanap ng pag-asa sa bawat masisikip at maiingay na busina ng mga sasakyan, sa bawat bigat ng hakbang, luha, at layo ng nilalakad niya sa kahabaan ng maynila, at sa unang pag-apak niya ng quiapo; ang una niyang ginawa ay humingi ng tawad kahit wala naman siyang kasalanan. what i love the most in this film, it highlights how your choices always matter. Kaya Sunshine, gets na gets kita :'').",6
Sunshine,Galing ni Maris Racal. She deserves a Gawad Urian for Best Actress category.,10
Sunshine,"“Naiintindihan mo na ba ako?”That's how she basically ended that chapter. She’s aware sa ginawa niya, hindi niya kailangan pagsabihan pa siya na yung mga ginawa niya was wrong, illegal, or malaking kasalanan etc. And she doesn’t even deny that in the film. There were enough reasons laid out throughout the film validates her choice, and you see the life that she leads. The hallucination of her own child is her own manifestation of the guilt that haunts her — which tells you she still has hesitations and ramdam niya yung kahihiyan ng mga desisyon niya. You can mourn all you want about the potential of these unborn fetuses that “could’ve” changed our world. Pero paano naman yung mga Sunshine na buhay at may pangarap? What if they’re the ones capable of changing the world? May mga pangarap naman din sila diba?Not everyone may agree with her decision — but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t deserve to reach those dreams.",-1
Sunshine,"I'm never too late to watch a great film, and Sunshine is exactly that. The storyline is easy to follow, but what truly captured me from the beginning was the character of Sunshine, played by Maris. She brings a natural charm that immediately connects with the audience, and I was genuinely impressed by the depth and nuance of her performance.What makes Sunshine even compelling is its brave exploration of abortion, a topic that’s still heavily stigmatized in the Philippines. The film doesn’t…",12
Sunshine,"The script tackles a lot of issues that share deep commentary about our social reality. It's a social realism film with metaphysical personification of guilt and morality as I would call it. No matter what your political stance is, you can't deny how the script threaded with care and empathy towards women and women's health.I'm glad they went for an ambiguous ending because if not, it would've been too preachy and they would alienate or estrange a large group of people, but instead its rhetoric opened up an important topic to debate on. I actually agree that it's one of the most important Filipino films of modern times and it's Jadaone's strongest work yet.",5
Sunshine,"Para sa isang lipunan kung saan nalilimitihan pa rin ang karapatan ng kababaihan, dadako at dadako ang mga ito sa 'illegal' na paraan para mabawasan ang pasan. How couldnt they?Sa loob ng pelikulang 'Sunshine,' binubuksan nito ang mahirap at hindi napaguusapang diskurso ukol sa karapatan ng kababaihan ayon sa kanilang katawan, aborsyon, guilt, morals, pati na rin ang Sexual abuse/harassment partikular sa mga kabataan o menor de edad. At sa kabilang banda naman, napoportray dito yung bond na nabubuo ng mga kababaihan sa loob ng pyudal na lipunan. Ilang beses akong naiyak habang nanonood, especially nung scene na ni Maris na nagtake siya ng pampalaglag. Ang bigat panoorin nito actually, kasi what do you mean na para mabawi ko yung buhay na mayroon ako before, kailangan kong pumunta ng Quiapo para bumili ng pampalaglag at pagdaanan yung sakit para lang duguin ako ulit? Sunod pa ay yung dinala si Rhed sa hospital dahil binuntis siya ng tito niya. 13 lang siya. Ang mga ganitong klaseng halimbawa ay pinapakita kung gaano ka-devastating yung fact na walang tulong ang narereceive ng mga kababaihan with this kind of situation. Meron naman siguro, pero mahirap at hindi lahat ay may kakayahang makakuha nitong ""tulong"" na ito dahil halos lahat ay kailangan ng pera.Nakaka-mind fuck yung situation ni Rhed (kahit short amount of time lang sha ron s film) kasi sa lipunan natin ngayon, ang daming batang babae ang nabubuntis, at bawat taon, pababa nang pababa ang edad ng mga ito. Ngunit, sino ba ang bumubuntis sakanila?Ang abortion ay hindi isang paraan upang mag-promote ng sarap sa sex sa mga kabataan;And with films like this, maganda yung na-aacknowledge na may ganitong klaseng pangyayari sa lipunan. Pero kagaya ng iba pang pelikula that tackles issues like this ay tulad ng 'Uninvited,' bakit hanggang acknowledge lang?Sa role ni Maris bilang Sunshine, pinapakita nito ang journey niya sa loob ng mundong nangguguiltrip and self-devoted Christians, matatanda, etc etc (at napepersonify itong guilt na to through the character of Bata (played by annika)), nakita niya na may mga batang nabubuntis, nakita niya na may judgement agad yung mga tao sa tulad niya, nakita niya na hindi madaling nakakatanggap at nakakahingi ng tulong yung mga nasa sitwasyon niya—pero even after all these, walang self-reflection or closure yung film or yung character ni Sunshine mismo (since first-hand niyang nawitness and naexperience lahat) sa lahat ng issue na naipakita. Parang ""bahala ka na kung ano gusto mo isipin, basta eto yung pinapakita namin."" Solid 6-7/10.",3
Sunshine,"It's a rather decent take on the current status of the Philippine status quo on women's health and the healthcare system in general. Rather a hit and miss for me with the kids being a figure of speech so to speak and that the little kid's dream is also Sunshine's dream being the same but should have been clear that both won't be able to meet as per the dialogues. Story-wise, everything somehow fell into place in such a way that all the things that could have been possible in terms of occurrences akin to a deus ex machina of sorts, giving the sense that everything was too good to be true - still, point stands; it's a great film to talk about and amazingly delivers points that we should discuss more of a society, especially when it concerns the lives of women, children, and the difficulties of being a woman in a third world country.<<Objectively, story continuity could have been better which could have convinced me of giving it a higher score.>>",-1
Sunshine,solid ensemble. gripping storyline/storytelling. ang bothersome ng cgi version ni maris... cgi ba yun? + best performance to ni maris. fave scene: maris and rhed bustamante's ER scenePS. JENICA GARCIA IS UNDERRATED.,-1
Sunshine,Definitely one of the most important Filipino films of this generation.,9
Sunshine,"Sunshine is a bold and compelling story about when passion collides with unforeseen circumstances. Delivering a powerful performance, Maris Racal gives light to Sunshine, a bright and hopeful teen gymnast whose Olympic dreams come crashing down after an unplanned pregnancy. While the film is beautiful aesthetically, it’s also dark and grim as it not only deals with a controversial subject matter, but is also an accurate reflection of Philippine culture and society.I love stories that involve moral dillemas — stories that make the character choose between two conflicting moral values. This is the case for Sunshine, whose choice is either to abort her baby to reach her Olympic dream, a goal she’s dreamt of in years; or keep the baby as this is deemed the morally right thing to do. Set in the Philippine context, one of the most religious countries in the world, that is one of the hardest dilemmas to have, and I thought the film gave justice to what Maris’ character had to go through.Maris deserves her props for this as well. She was an acting powerhouse, delivering and making the audience feel everything she was going through right out of the screen. It seemed like she trained legitimately for all the stunts, too. All these efforts made the film much more impactful and grounded.Visually, this is what I imagined the City of Manila is like on film. The city, while beautiful to look at, lying beneath it feels like a sense of grime and moral corruption, which blended well with the film’s theme.But aside from a couple of narrative choices made, I really liked this film. Sunshine, while beautiful, is also a haunting reminder of the everyday struggle of the common Filipino. A Filipino who has goals and dreams but is blindsided by forces beyond their control but chooses to push through. It’s an empowering film that I think will leave its mark for years to come.",17
Sunshine,"Every choice in cinematography, production, writing, etc. feels all so delicately planned together to build itself into a single cohesive message on the state of reproductive health in the Philippines. Even just the choice of Sunshine being a gymnast- a sport that is known to affect women's menstrual cycles, which explains why Sunshine didn't consider pregnancy in the first place- proves the care and attention direk Tonet placed on every aspect of the film.The ending however, did leave me to wish more in terms of understanding the aftermath of Sunshine's abortion. Filipino society's marites culture and religious evangelism no less is bound to have an effect on Sunshine's life and that was something I wished to see her persevere through post-abortion...but I do also respect the need to end Sunshine's story on a more hopeful note, as that message of sheer hope and optimism is probably more important than portraying an already familiar reality.",12
Sunshine,"maris racal didn’t mother (literally)anyway i really like how sunshine knows what she wants to do with the child because of her dreams. ang daming nadiscuss na societal issues dito pero pinaka tumatak sakin na subtopic ay yung catholic guilt. kailan ba tayo maging progressive, pilipinas? AYAW KO MAGING NANAY!!!",-1
Sunshine,"""If you carry your dream for so long, it becomes your spine — you cannot let it go, even when the world seems to bend you."" ""Sunshine"" made me ugly cry throughout the film, it opened my eyes on how stigmatized the topic of ""abortion"" and the lack of proper healthcare for us women na pinagkaitan ng karapatan sa katawan, on how men can easily get away with basically anything and leave the burden to the women, and the touch…",-1
Sunshine,thank you po papa god sa pelikulang ito,16
Sunshine,"Gets ko na. Ang galing galing magsulat ni Antoinette Jadaone. Naalala ko ‘yung “Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.” I was so disturbed by the reality faced by women. Maraming Sunshine at maraming Menggay sa mundo, hanga ako na isinulat ito ni Jadaone para masampal sa masa ang mga nararanasan nila. Mahirap maging babae, paano pa kaya kapag naging nanay pa? Mabuti at firm si Sunshine na ayaw niya talaga maging ina because I was rooting for her…",30
Sunshine,"For Every Woman (Para sa bawat Babae) It’s hard to fully grasp what women go through in our society, what more if you’re living in a country like the Philippines, where there aren’t enough laws to protect women’s rights. This movie is a wake-up call, an eye-opener, a voice for the voiceless women. It sheds light on major issues we often sweep under the rug like, sexual assault, teenage pregnancy, public healthcare, poverty, child abuse, and most especially, abortion. These are real, painful realities in the Philippines and we need to talk about them. We need tangible solutions. We need action from our government.As for the cast, whoever handled the casting, hats off. Every single actor in this film delivered. No weak links. Maris Racal completely embodied Sunshine. It wasn’t Maris I saw on screen, it was Sunshine. I know she’s getting a lot of praise for her impeccable, flawless acting here, and she absolutely deserves it.But let me also talk about Annika Co and Jennica Garcia. Annika was incredible in this film. From funny to irritating to heartbreaking, she nailed every single scene. She held her own alongside veteran actors, and that’s not easy dude. And Jennica Garcia? Her eyes, that “mata-mata acting” . In one confrontation scene where she barely had lines, her eyes told the whole story, you could feel out of the screen that she’d do anything for Sunshine. She’s the older sister we all deserve.And the rest of the cast, Elijah Canlas, Xyriel Manabat, Meryll Soriano, Ar-Yuh-Nuh (JM), Rhed Bustamante and the others...damn, perfection! They ate and left no crumbs, mothered!!!This film serves rawness. It’s honest (the Quiapo, to searching from Reddit, X, FB) . It almost feels like a documentary film type. From the gritty shots of Manila’s streets to the realness of the lines, these are the same things we hear in actual situations like this. The script cuts deep. The weight of each line… it’s crushing, full of heavy emotions. Major kudos to Direk Antoinette Jadaone for creating films that reflect the harsh realities of life in the Philippines, especially the realities that women face, the never-ending battle against a society that dictates what a woman should do with her body, the shame, the guilt, and the silence they’re forced to carry. I hope more films like this are made, films like Pamilya Ordinaryo, Birdshot, and now, this. This film deserves AWARDS. I’m also amazed by the cinematography, the color grading, the symbolism of the two children, the sound (especially the NATSOT from Manila, ang lala beh, it really adds so much depth to every scene). This movie will make you laugh, cry, and feel pain. But above all, it stirs the mind and hits the heart, also it carries a message that matters. Message that needs to be heard, seen, and acted upon.The story arc is solidddd. The ending? Not abrupt, not lacking, it was just right. Perfectly right! To every Sunshine out there “gets na namin kayo.” Compassion shouldn’t depend on religion, gender, or social status. These aren’t just stories. This is real life. And we need bold, brave storytellers to bring these realities to light. Highly recommended. Another title could be ""HALA PASALAMAT KA""",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is often considered a drama film by many who have seen it. However, I see it as a lowkey dystopian body horror film. Being a film about the effects of the Philippine's abortion ban, it displays the nation as a dystopian society that cares very little for the women living in it. The Philippine State callously disregards women's human rights and bodily autonomy with an overwhelming religious zeal, combined with a deadly dose of patriarchal rule. Posters proclaim abortion…",12

Sunshine,being pro-choice is not an act of selfishness like what pro lifers make it out to be—it is a plea to be heard by the system and acknowledge the realities of the stigma building more restrictions for women’s freedom. tangina ultimo healthcare we are still confined to less opportunities kaya gets na gets tangina nyo lahat sobrang gago ng buhay,4

Sunshine,"Sunshine tells a simple yet powerful story of women’s struggles—navigating sexual abuse, the lack of knowledge and guidance around relationships, and the absence of accessible, safe medical resources. What makes the film striking is its subtle handling of sensitive issues. Rather than aggressively challenging religious beliefs about life and birth, it approaches them with quiet respect and nuance. One of the most impactful aspects of the film is how it portrays the internal conflict of Sunshine, the mother. Instead of…",20
Sunshine,"first of all, maris racal ate. you could never make me hate her, ever. she brings so much nuance and truth to this role. one of the most compelling actresses of this generation, hands down. you just feel everything she feels, no effort.also, annicka’s performance really surprised me. the contrast from her mini miss u days to this role? ang layo. she fully disappeared into the character (literally). and jennica garcia, wow. her portrayal of the older sister felt so grounded and real, like someone you actually know. there’s comfort in the way she carries herself. gusto mo na lang yakapin ka niya at sabihan ka ng, “kaya mo ‘yan.”there’s something about the way the film is made that feels like a quiet throwback. may brocka feels pero hindi pilit. very grounded in truth. the quiapo scene especially hit hard. ganun talaga ang sitwasyon dun. like direk tonet said, quiapo is one big irony. magsisimba ka with so much faith, then paglabas mo, you’re faced with desperation and survival. it's painful how real that is.the film doesn't try to be loud, and i think that’s what makes it more powerful. it reflects the harshness of our society, especially for women who are constantly judged for the choices they make. sunshine isn’t just timely, it’s necessary.in a country that prides itself in morality but refuses to give women full control over their own bodies, this film hits different. it makes you ask, sino ba talaga ang may karapatang pumili?sunshine is not just a character. she’s a reality too many are still afraid to look at. and this time, gets ko na.",10
Sunshine,"ang tapang. mahal ko na walang pagdududa kay sunshine. sa oras na nalaman niyang buntis sya, alam nya na ang gusto nyang gawin. hindi sya nagdalawang isip kung dapat o hindi niya ba dapat gawin. buo ang desisyon nya. hindi siya nahihiya. ayaw nya maging nanay.nililihis nito ang conflict ng pelikula. hindi si sunshine ang problema. ang problema ay ang kawalan ng karapatan nya sa pagpili, kawalan nya ng ahensya sa sariling katawan. dahil sa gobyernong hindi kayang tugunan ang karapatan ng mga kababaihan, sa relihiyong dumidikta sa pasya ng mga tagasunod, at sa lipunang mapanghusga.mahal ko ang kababaihan ng pelikula. si sunshine, si mary grace, si geleen, si coach eden, si thea, si dra. helena, si manang na nangtitinda ng pamparegla sa quiapo, si ateng receptionist sa motel. malayo-layo pa para sabihing nakuha ng mga lalaki (miggy at bobot) ang parusang karapat-dapat sa kanila, pero pipiliin kong isipin na kumatok din iyon sa pintuan nila.mahal ko ang bata at si ariana. mahal kong ""nabuhay"" sila mula kay sunshine at mary grace. mahal kong nabuhay sina sunshine at mary grace mula sa kanila.mahal ko rin si direk tonet. thank you papa god, at may direk tonet jadaone.",3

(let’s be real, we can’t deny that this girl is one of the best artists of her generation). every actor in this film did so well too. whenever jennica’s character cried, i shed a tear as well.“drown out the noise” – a line from the film where it simultaneously shows the loud and chaotic streets of manila. it was so raw and real. a perfect snapshot of womanhood in a society that demands resilience from women, yet often judges and shames them for their choices – if they’re even given the choice, to begin with.this is a film that every woman (especially those living in the philippines) needs to watch.mahigpit na yakap para kay sunshine at sa lahat ng kababaihan.

Sunshine,"This was handled with so much care that I was crying cause I was so inspired by it. You can tell the director and the whole crew wanted to show the movie in a way that the story would be upfront but respecting the message it was trying to give.The story hits in a way that it really shows you how these events happen in real life that you can look around, and there's people living through it. The question now is when will we be addressing it cause it's been happening for so long. How many more lives will suffer from this?GIVE WOMEN THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR BODIES.",23

Sunshine,"“Babae siya, hindi bayani. At hindi niya kailangang maging isa para maging totoo.”Sunshine is not here to baby you. It assumes you can handle the discomfort—because you should. Quiet, raw, and unapologetic. Hindi ito comfort film. Hindi rin ito film na may malinis na aral sa dulo. Sa halip, isa itong tahimik pero galit na sigaw sa bansang patuloy na tinuturing ang kababaihan bilang incubator, atleta, o anak—pero hindi bilang ganap na tao. It’s not even a loud film. Antoinette didn’t spoon-feed, and that’s exactly why it hurts.She frames Maris not as a victim, but as a girl with agency. Sa kamay ng ibang director, baka naging sermon to. Pero sakanya, naging tanong. At ang sagot: hindi mo kailangan sumagot.PS:This film turned into a full-blown debate night with my boyfriend. Loved it! Solid talk! Ang dami namin insights. Lol",3

Sunshine,"Jadaone perfectly illustrated a quiet revolution here. Sunshine is fierce in its intent, yet grounded in the small, heartbreaking realities of a woman in a conservative country. Maris Racal is just purely exceptional, and calling it now her best work so far. She impeccably portrayed a woman layered with so many frustrations and aspirations, but also burdened by judgment. Jennica Garcia on a supporting role surely knows how to elevate every scene she’s in, too. Sunshine’s narrative is such a…",25

Sunshine,"i had to sleep on this film first to really process my feelings and emotions after seeing it. and i really can’t say anything else pero napaka husay at napaka tapang nito. ito lang ulit yung pelikula na ganito naging epekto sakin.it’s about time to have a film like this in this country. ito yung sigaw ng mga babae na matagal ng nagiingay pero hindi magawang intindihin at pakinggan nitong bansang nababalot pa rin ng patriyarkiya. kuhang kuha yung reality ng paghihirap sa gitna ng Manila. no matter how much a country claims to be progressing, some mindset still set it back by so much.as an Ate, di ko kinaya kung paano nila sinulat yung character ni Jennica Garcia. di ko na napigilan yung luha ko sa room scene nung kinausap na niya si Sunshine. i think more than the kid, siya yung support character na tumulong kay Sunshine makapagdesisyon without her even knowing it. ang galing ng pag-arte. parang nabalot din ako ng love at protection nung pinapanood ko siya sa screen.lastly, wala ako masabi kay Maris Racal. the woman that you are. napaka ganda. go watch it.",6

Sunshine,"You know, I was a child of unwanted pregnancy too. So are my siblings. Like Sunshine, my mom had dreams. Like Sunshine, my mom was striving for better living. Like Miggy, my father was the more financially capable. Like Miggy, my father was useless about it [pregnancy]. Though, my mother couldn't do anything. She still had me— and my ate; and my younger 2 siblings. I wish she had a choice, or even knew that there are options more than just acceptance. Maybe, she could have lived her dreams. It hurts me that I lived on and carried on in my father's care (and even my dad lived unbothered); meanwhile, my mother still suffers in poverty. She is always dead worried about us, and about how she can even carry herself at the age of 40.I hope this film helps people realize Sunshine humanizes all Filipino women who endure such a heavy living— heavy dreams, heavy hearts, and heavy standards. I hope Sunshine becomes the gateway to opening discussions which let women choose and live, especially against how we had been dictated. I hope every Sunshine is given their flowers, and given the warmest hugs. Sunshine, oh Sunshine.",-1

Sunshine,ang ganda!!!,1
Sunshine,"Ang tapang mo Direk Antoinette!! Hard topic to tackle but I LOVE how the reality and rawness of it was portrayed in the movie. Being a woman in a culture shaped by Catholic values often means silencing your own needs to conform and that reality was portrayed so powerfully. But what I loved most is how the story pushes back against that. I loved how Sunshine embraced her truth and only her unique relationship with God. ANG TAPANG MO, SUNSHINE! My take as a Catholic: If God is truly forgiving, wouldn’t He also forgive Sunshine for choosing herself?",28

Sunshine,"watched this around lunchtime at sm bf. i had old folks as company. they were quiet.i cried for the what could have been. i wept with sunshine. rooted for her as she continues to pursue her dreams, regardless of the noise.maybe, it's okay to try for that dream one more time.such a good movie. amen.",-1
Sunshine,"""Drown out the noise!""I watched this film just hours before I turned twenty (teenage graduate). After a year of waiting for it to be released here in the Philippines, I can say—it was absolutely worth it.What makes it so powerful is its courage to open the conversation about abortion and reproductive health in a deeply religious country like ours. It doesn't hold back. As a society, we need to be more open to the realities women face, and ask ourselves what we can do collectively, especially what the government can and should do. ""Mahirap maging babae, lalo na dito sa Pinas"".The film is raw and relevant. Sunshine is real. Her character struck a chord, and I saw glimpses of my past classmates and friends in the struggles of Maris Racal and Rhed Bustamante’s roles. The film tackles poor awareness and lack of access to health facilities, while also confronting religious beliefs and cultural norms head-on.It really centers on abortion—not to promote it, but to open the conversation, especially for conservative audiences. It is still a taboo and personally, I hold a progressive stand on abortion, and seeing it presented this way felt affirming.I also loved the use of symbolism—from the “Gift of God” jeepney that Sunshine rides on her way to Quiapo, to her choosing not to enter the church even while seeking God’s guidance. Those subtle moments say so much.I admire how it ends with the strong message that women own their bodies and have the right to choose and decide—whether or not it goes against religious or cultural expectations.This film is more than a story, it’s a tool. A voice. A reflection of many who share the same experiences as Sunshine. And I truly hope the government will soon shed light on this issue and give women access to safe and free abortion procedures.",13
Sunshine,"Sabi nga natin diba, masakit 'pag totoo.at sa pelikulang ito, hindi mapagkakaila na totoo si sunshine, na may katulad ni sunshine, na pwedeng ngayon, ikaw si sunshine...This film doesn’t just replicate or mirror a version of society’s reality.

But while the film builds its emotional core around that choice, it also gestures at larger social issues that it never fully grapples with. The unborn child becomes…",12
Sunshine,"First time ko bumili ng movie ticket na mag-isa akong manonood. I’m glad this was the film I chose to watch for that kind of first time because this film felt like a personal conversation.Alam ng mga taong close sa akin how I dislike children, at kung paanong ayoko mag-anak. It’s not that I hate children; it’s just that what I see in them are the responsibilities and the lifetime commitment. I see them more as a burden than a blessing. I can’t be a parent with that kind of perspective—at least, not now or in the near future. My greatest fear has always been unexpected pregnancy and this film materialized the why behind that fear. I bawled my eyes out in a lot of scenes because this film felt validating and liberating. It made me feel seen and understood as a woman. Paglabas ko ng sinehan, kahit mugto mga mata ko, I felt free. Ang gaan-gaan ng loob ko. Siguro dahil sa thought na finally someone putted it out there. Sobrang husay ni Maris; she represented and embodied the struggles of a woman through her character, Sunshine. And to Direk Tonet, thank you for sparking conversations about this. It was bold and powerful. You will always have my respect and admiration.",-1

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is an absolute cinematic gut-punch. Sunshine, the titular character played by Maris Racal, is on her way to Olympic glory, her dreams already in the bag. It takes a missed period and a couple of pink lines to veer her off-course. And just like that, she crashes headlong into a society that’s dead set on denying women their bodily autonomy. Racal’s performance is where the film’s soul resides. She embodies Sunshine with a physicality and emotional depth that’s fully felt from start to finish. Her sobs are painful to watch, but she’s given some respite she can hold onto: the comradeship among women. Jennica Garcia’s Geleen, Sunshine’s older sister, is a particular standout.Fittingly, Jadaone is not soft around the edges, and the film is unflinching in its message. Yet Sunshine never feels preachy or didactic. Because, to be fair, there’s really no neat, easy, and one-size-fits-all resolution for women like Sunshine. But ultimately, it does pull back the curtain and invites you into a conversation, rather than passing judgment.",17
Sunshine,"sabi ng coach ni Sunshine, “yung iniisip mo, ilang araw lang yan. weeks, or months. pero ito, ang tagal na nito sayo.” pertaining to her dream of representing her country in the olympics. not knowing na yung problema ni Sunshine will long outlive her dream, and will likely stay with her for the rest of her life. hindi humingi si Sunshine ng opinyon sa mga tao sa paligid niya. bago pa niya sabihin sa iba, alam na niya yung desisyon niya. she didn’t need anyone to ‘talk her out of it’, she only asked for their understanding. yun lang naman talaga hinihiling ng mga babaeng katulad ni Sunshine. hindi naman nila sinasabing gawin mo, gusto lang nilang maintindihan mo kung bakit nila ‘to ginagawa. kasi wala naman silang choice, at hindi sila binibigyan ng choice ng bansang ‘to, at ng mga outdated beliefs nito. nakakalungkot isipin kung ilang babae na ang dumaan sa paghihirap at sakit na pinagdaanan din ni Sunshine dahil lang kinicriminalize ng batas at simbahan ang abortion, kaya ito nagiging unsafe. at mas lalong nakakalungkot isipin kung ilang babae na rin yung nakaranas ng paghihirap na pinagdadaanan ng mga nanay, kahit hindi naman nila ‘to ginusto. ewan wala na ‘ko masabi basta naiyak ako sa kwento ni Sunshine at sobrang nag eempathize ako sakanya kasi nakikita ko sakanya yung kaibigan ko.

Sunshine,"that shot of sunshine and her sister in the taxi? inject that shit in my VEINSthis was so beautifully lit, the night scenes were so captivating. probably my favorite scenes aesthetically because it sets the mood of an isolating society for women but a mix with the light of hope. the addition of the “future” children was pretty clever and adds a witty touch of when people say what if your aborted child becomes this!!! it’s truly a women-centric film that we barely had a few seconds without the titular sunshine. i love the grit mixed with wittiness— which i think are the quintessential qualities of filipino films. maybe im greedy but i wish we could’ve gotten more of how sunshine overcame the pregnancy and not just a “girl who is going to be okay” scene. if they were gonna represent the struggles of women, possibly be the face of a movement, and be “gritty,” they should’ve went all the way. it just felt incomplete and leaves an unsatisfying feeling that we are still stuck (which is true but i wanted more!!).",-1

Sunshine,"Really important film about abortion in the Philippines. Super empowering and really opens up the discussion on the shit state of women’s healthcare in this country. Would have given it a higher rating if the delineation of “Bata” being imaginary was made clearer to the audience. My mother, who is a senior, didnt catch that part.

Sunshine,Ok sia,1
Sunshine,i have such a deep appreciation for the film since it stuck with its core message. women should have a safe choice and not be forced to sacrifice their life and career to fulfill their role as a parent. the sooner that people understand that legalizing abortion is the most humanistic route is the day we'll be free. rooting for sunshine and for all women that find themselves in a similar situation.,5

Sunshine,"No coz wtf is up with it trying to be like Challengers in the exhibition scene?I don’t think it’s worth the hype that it’s getting, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s not a good movie. It doesn’t have a resolution nor does the message really sticks it landing. It is however, simply a story told that is based on the bits and pieces of reality that we can only conceive. It’s a conversation starter, but its certainly does not explore much of the topic that its centered on. So much so that the film doesn’t really let you grow to care about the Protagonist’s support system, thus their presence, their wisdom and their comfort, falls flat in terms of having and relevance to you. There are moments wherein I enjoyed the humor, but you can only do so much with curse words in dialogues that it starts to sound like Daryl Yap’s films, the only difference here is that it handled a topic that’s taboo and has managed to deliver its point across, however at the expense of being safe enough to be told, but less poignant and thought provoking to be considered as something to be discussed in depth. I think it did its job though, to tell a story.",23
Sunshine,funniest line ever: amen,16
Sunshine,"Ang galing ni Maris! She mothered that role. No pun intended.I'm not really fond of Filipino films as they always fail to peek my interest when it comes to filmmaking. However, if the movie talks about social and political issues like it has in SUNSHINE, I can tune and lock in.SUNSHINE is straightforward to its message. It's about dealing with abortion in a country where not only is illegal but also discriminated hardly. A sensitive topic portrayed with a really good script by Jadaone. What a complete package in terms of writing. The story is justified.Even though I may have found the climactic moments not explosive enough, I'm sure the average Filipino conservative does. Personally, I am pro-abortion and I believe women have the rights to their own bodies. I'm glad the movie went in the direction I wanted. As someone who has seen a lot of abortion films in Holywood, this is the first Filipino. And I just applaud everyone in this project for the risk and making a statement through SUNSHINE. For that, it's already a big win for independent Filipino cinema as theaters flock and raise the demand. Because at the end of the day, a movie is not only good if it's good, but also if it sparks conversation. Hundreds of essays and reviews are out there for this film. It makes the whole movie going experience worth it even more.#Sunshine 4/5",12
Sunshine,"as a Filipina woman, this truly broke my heart knowing that this is the sort of reality that many Filipinas are currently living through. every single actress gave a phenomenal performance. maris racal, jennica garcia, annika co and rhed bustamante especially. ms tonet jadaone giving out another film with women at it's core and for that she is queen!!! wishing that this movie opens up more conversation regarding women's reproductive health in the Philippines.",26

Sunshine,"Hindi nagmintis ang “Sunshine,” sa direksyon ni Antoinette Jadaone, sa pagsuong sa panganib na kaakibat ng paggiit ng kababaihan sa kanilang autonomiya sa sariling katawan at kalayaan mula sa pananamantala. Batid ng pelikula na ang karapatan sa aborsyon ang tanging daan ng bidang si Sunshine Francisco tungo sa kanyang pangarap na makalundag sa Olympics.Ngunit sa paglalarawan sa paghihirap ni Sunshine bilang isang abstraksiyong siya lamang ang humaharap, naisantabi ang pagkakataong maging paanyaya ang pelikula upang bulatlatin ang panlipunang estruktura sa likod ng kanyang pagdurusa.Hindi rin tuluyang tumagos palabas ng sinehan ang tindig na itinanghal nito para sa kababaihan. Sa kabila ng panawagang boykot bilang pagtutol sa henosidyo ng Israel sa Gaza, lumahok ang pelikula sa Berlin International Film Festival 2025 at indirektang nakisangkot sa panlulupig ng kababaihan kapalit ng Kanluraning balidasyon.Sa tulak ng lokal na suporta, na-extend ang pagpapalabas ng “Sunshine” sa mga sinehan—patunay na posible ang tagumpay ng pelikula nang hindi kinakalakal ang sarili sa mga institusyong may kamay sa karahasan.Basahin ang buong rebyu dito.",3

Sunshine,"basta pag walang matres, walang opinyon",21
Sunshine,"[will edit later, for now this is my initial thoughts]Gets kita, Sunshine!Abortion is not just a decision—it's a process. It's never easy. We saw how sunshine depicted guilt, anxiety, and contemplation throughout the film, which mirrors many women's lived experiences. The more we don't talk about this kind of topic and deny women's bodily autonomy, the more women to seek unsafe alternatives—like hilot at pamaparegla sa quiapo—which can lead to death and complications. ""Baka next president yang dinadala mo pero ipapalaglag mo lang"" pano magiging next president ang isang baby kung yung nanay nya walang mapakain sa kanya at walang pera para mapaaral sya? Pro-life lang kayo kapag nasa tyan ng nanay, pero wala na kayong pake after that. Sunshine is just one of many women who also have a dreams for themselves. If giving birth is for you, good for you and it's a valid choice. But for some, it was never an option because they have big dream to fulfill and personal stories as to why they want to make that decision. I love it when Dir. Toñet Jadaone creates characters who are goal-driven and ambitious— Christine(Alone/Together), Vilma(Beauty in a bottle), and now Sunshine. Throughout the film, it felt like Sunshine already had a decision and she's firm with it. She's going to do it regardless of what will happen. I hope in the future, there will be legal medical practices that provides safe abortions, because there's an urgent need for them.",-1

Sunshine,"Mahal kita, Sunshine. I did not stop crying until we arrived home. Bukod sa ang bigat ng pelikula at damang-dama ko ang bawat eksena, I also couldn’t stop thinking about my Sunshine. My Sunshine, a friend, who also had the same experience few months before our college graduation. Para akong ibinalik sa mga oras na iyon. ‘Di ko mapigilang mag-isip kung nagawa ko bang maging katulad ni Geleen. Kung nakapag-offer ba ako ng enough understanding at compassion kagaya ni Geleen. Surface-level lang pala ang alam ko sa struggles niya noon, dahil hanggang doon lang naman ang kaya kong malaman at maintindihan even as a gay guy and a feminist. There is so much more struggles to abortion than just making a decision— it inevitably comes with guilt, shame, and fear to which the film portrayed effectively.One thing is for sure, ang hirap na nga maging babae— mas lalo pa sa Pilipinas. Poverty, bulok na public health system, lack of access to reproductive rights— all were tackled with so much bravery, honesty, and rawness. Ang husay ng lahat ng bumuo ng pelikulang ito, on and off cam. Thank you Direk Jada One at Maris na haggard. Thank you Papa God sa buhay nila eme.Catch the film. Isama niyo ang tito’t tita niyong relihiyoso dahil dalwa lang iyan, either kukumbulsyunin sila sa sama ng loob o magbabago ang pananaw nila. Either way, Thank you Papa God eme. Dahil tama si Jennica sa pagpag episode sa AWKP na minsan iyong panghihimasok ng ibang tao sa ganitong usapin isn’t always coming from a place of concern and genuine care rather from a place of self-righteousness and it’s high time we silence these regressive and harmful voices.Time!",2

Sunshine,"More thoughts in the next few days but for now I just wanna say, proud Maris fan and defender since her PBB days ",10
Sunshine,"""Gets ko na."" It’s so hard being a woman. This film? A masterpiece. It powerfully shows how deeply abortion needs to be addressed in the Philippines. “Mawawalan ako ng lisensya, Miss.” That line hit so hard—because this is real. This happens. And it’s not about protection. It’s about control. Fuck the system. Fuck the doctors who speak so loudly about God but stay silent about compassion.To anyone out there who feels like Sunshine—or has ever felt like her—you’re not alone. I hope you find your own Dr. Helena someday. I hope you find safety. I hope you find peace. Balang araw. Balang araw. :)",13
Sunshine,"“naiintindihan mo na ba ako””gets ko na.”raw, simple, poignant, brave is how i would describe this film. its a film that has something to say and my god they delivered it so well. its direct to the point, its bold, its in your face, it shows you the reality of what the women in this country go through when it comes to reproductive health. nakakaiyak, nakakalungkot isipin na our women has to depend on unsafe abortion just because the men violated their body — mary grace’s tito raped her and miggy not pulling out when he said he will — and just because abortion is illegal.i don’t think my mind has fully processed the film in a way that my thoughts are still all over the place and dont know where to start even if 2 hours has passed since i watched the movie. there are so many key moments in the movie and i want to talk abt it all, but let me stick to at least 3. one, sunshine and geleen’s (jennica) relationship, specifically yung part na tinabihan niya si sunshine sa kama para sabihin na sinusuportahan niya si sunshine sa kung ano mang desisyon niya, CRIED HARDDDD!!! kasi ramdam mo na conflicted siya in terms of abortion pero si sunshine ang priority niya at kung ano magpapasaya at magpapalaya kay sunshine iyon ang lagi niyang pipiliin. im glad that sunshine has an ate like her, i wish i had one too and i’m hoping to be a good of an ate like geleen. two, the whole sequence between mary grace and sunshine, it was sooo heartbreaking and so shattering to think na ito ang reyalidad ng napakaraming kabataan hindi lang sa pilipinas kundi sa buong mundo. our children deserves better. lastly, when sunshine finally perfected her routine, she looks so free, so happy, so contented, you just know she already made her decision. it was such a beautiful scene, its just her and her routine and the kid — her kid — watching her and finally understanding her. sobrang nakakaiyak. “gets ko na” such a simple statement but made me cry so hard wow. gets na gets talaga. great performances all around din talaga especially to maris racal grabe napakagaling, literal na wala talaga ako ibang masabi kundi sobrang sobrang galing wow. jennica garcia na hindi rin talaga maipagkakaila ang galing, ang onti lang ng scenes niya pero lahat may impact. and siyempre who would forget rhed bustamante na napakagaling din. sound design and cinematography are on point din talaga, i especially love those parts when sunshine drowns out the noise. writing this made me realize that the whole film, the ones who made the most impact are women. oh women, i hope one day the world will be kinder to us. i think i have said enought but i really hope that this film would be a way for people to be more open minded when it comes to the discussion of abortion and sana itong pelikulang ito ay maging daan rin para mas lalong maraming pang tao ang sumama sa laban na gawing legal ang safe abortion practices sa bansa. and to direk tonet thank you for sharing us your craft and for meticulously creating this film. you delivered its message very well! kudos to you direk and to everyone involved!",5

Sunshine,"Fear and self-interest. The two powerful drives of men according to Napoleon.But Sunshine is a woman— a gymnast, one of the few sports considered most feminine—one of those burning out athletes who lives by flexibility, by bending yourself in all possible corners to become this perfect beautiful being. So yes, maybe she was driven by fear and love for gymnastics, but why not?Her panic walks bending through eskinitas, the close ups on Maris’ expressive eyes unyielding despite the fear, and the overwhelming passionate Filipino noise shiver through the gritty scene of Manila and it feeds us, the audience, a rhythmic choreography of the most tender experience of a woman. Manila succumbs her, a fragile thin young girl on the verge of losing it all. And I fucking loved and consumed it.I love it too much I felt the giddiness through the tips of my fingers when the first scene at Quiapo entered, Sunshine in panic crying inside the jeep, and the first thing I thought was, “putangina si Julio ng Maynila sa Kuko ng Liwanag.”Yes maybe Sunshine enjoyed doing it with Miggy, and maybe seen the near death process of getting rid of it through Mary Grace, felt the catholic guilt, and that maybe her drive to success is to disregard what could be (motherhood) but still, ultimately still, tender is the flesh of a woman who wants to be in life. Like Julio (my shayla), tender is the flesh that holds all possibilities in life. The difference is, the tragedy of Brocka’s Julio is the absence of grounded support systems. Sunshine became her own because of the people and the women in her life who understood and grieved with her.Ito ang kasagutan sa katanungang paano naging kapantay Lino Brocka, Ishmael, Mario O’Hara si Dir. Tonet Jadaone; pusong pilipino ang lente. Sining ang pangangalampag.",17

Sunshine,"long ass word dump bc wow. it’s been a long time since i’ve felt so much for a film. hindi ko alam paano simulan, pero grabe kabog ng puso ko the entire time.the frustration of knowing that this happens in real life. that every girl, in a sense, was once sunshine. isang batang babaeng puno ng potensyal, mga pangarap, at may mga plano para sa sarili. isang batang babaeng takot na takot at walang magawa kundi tumungo sa online spaces (twitter, reddit, google, tiktok, etc.) para humanap ng paraan para makawala sa sitwasyong hindi niya inakalang mangyayari sakanya; saklap pa na isang lalaking walang kwenta ang naglagay sakanya sa posisyon na iyon.actually, isang buong bansa (with its strictly religious ideals, nonsensical government, and fucked up healthcare system) ang naglagay sakanya sa posisyon na iyon. from the beginning until the end of the movie sobrang emphasized nito. from the small comments (yung pharmacist) to the loud barking of unsolicited remarks (yung doktora na sinabihan pa si sunshine na magpasalamat kay Lord na hindi nalaglag yung bata, grabe rage bait 10000).pero makikita mo parin na grabe talaga ang chokehold ng religion sa ating mga pinoy. the way sunshine’s first instinct was to go to church and pray that it all goes away? prays that He takes the baby? an ironic reality.the film encapsulates manila and its complexities, completely. walang sugarcoat. manila up close? horrid. konti nalang parang maaamoy mo na yung baho sa may avenida at quiapo in the movie… but somehow, antionette jadaone makes it beautiful. the scene of maris contemplating and hesitating inside her room in avenida inn? the darkness that is only lit up by the train rushing by? cinematography at its finest. ultimo yung background noice, to a T. prayers and church bells, clinking bottles, vendors yelling, random cursing— it was so authentic i genuinely felt like i was in manila. the representation of a lot of things in the movie were also beautiful. the “bata” (which i assume is younger sunshine) was my favorite. telling the older sunshine that abortion was wrong at the start, then hugging her at the end whispering “gets ko na.” after the older sunshine performs her piece ??? HEART CRUSHED. TEARS WERE SHED!!!! although may questions ako left unanswered, hindi ako unsatisfied. this film opened my eyes to so much more. i truly loved this film. tangina buong cast walang tapon. ang gagaling. hats off to maris!!!!!!

Some think it's just a cell (you will forget about it). But for someone who carried it, even for a short time, you know it's there--- the heartbeat, the suffocation. You find yourself dreaming of their face, of their future. But they will never be engraved in your soul. You just know that, for a brief moment, something existed inside you.

Sunshine,"i absolutely love how nuanced this is. how it took into consideration filipino contexts in discussing such a sensitive topic. i love the cinematography, absolutely stunning. captured the vibe of living in the busy and harmful streets of manila.discussed this with my gf but i find the heavy incorporation of religion in this quite integral to the story. while westerners may be able to discuss about abortion more openly, filipinos whose lives revolve around religion, are not at all the same. we were taught at an early age that religion is the absolute law, and we must follow every rule made in the name of religion. and so, the guilt sunshine carries throughout the film is heavier than ever, because not only was she dealing with the judgment of others, she was also dealing with the judgment of God, “The Father.” And, surprisingly enough, I find the presence of the child important. At first, she bothered me a bit, how she accused shine of being a murderer, stopped shine from her attempts at abortion. She’s the superego, the guilt that follows shine everywhere. But also, she’s a part of sunshine, hence her line “Pangarap ko ang pangarap niya.” (non verbatim) and so, she too, wishes to see sunshine succeed. Her running to sunshine after her final performance and saying “gets ko na” was her way of easing shine’s guilt. After all, as people love to give life to everyone’s unborn child, then I guess this once, I too, shall make use of that. Viewing sunshine’s life through the eyes of her “unborn child” must have been painful, yet every child I know has questioned (at least once) how good of a life their mother would’ve had, had they never been born. And just like every living child, the kid too, understood how much gymnastics meant to shine. And she was willing to trade the loss of her life for sunshine’s happiness, because she will always be a part of sunshine.",-1

Sunshine,"listen to me, women are the only ones who will understand fellow women. men are trash and will always be trash, conceited and people who think of women as stuff they can just discard after using. this film sheds light on why abortion is something that is shouldn’t be labeled as “sinful” or “illegal”. it’s for women who has dreams they still want to achieve, for women who has more important obligations and is not ready to be a mother, for women who are abused by self-centered men.",-1
Sunshine,"Movie felt slightly rushed, I love how they portrayed religious trauma and the forced actions and stereotypes. It really spreads awareness about a woman having to choose a life changing decision.",36
Sunshine,this was so black swan,1
Sunshine,"hayyyy i love this one with my wholeee chest (i will come back with a better review, hopefully)",1
Sunshine,"tangina ng mga religious hypocrite leaders, tangina ng mga rapists, tangina niyo, tangina ng mundo sa pilipinas, tangina niyo. ibigay niyo ang kalayaan sa'min pumili kung anong gusto namin mangyari sa katawan namin. tangina kayo.",3
Sunshine,"pro choice always. abortion is a human right, and for anyone who disagrees abt this and mentions the right to be born, hiniling ba ng fetus na ipanganak siya????",4
Sunshine,"late review, but the tears that i have shed were an overwhelming amount — tears for the women who felt so alone, with a cruel world that seems to surround them from all sides, forcing to navigate these hardships on their own while combating bigotry, misogyny, and prejudice in modern society. yung scene kung saan humingi ng tulong si rhed bustamante kay sunshine hanggang sa hospital, iyak ako nang iyak, na parang naghilamos ako. konting-konti lang yung nakakagets pero karamihan hindi, kasi nasa bansa tayo na traditionalist, maka-diyos (thus sunshine’s plea for forgiveness, that familiar catholic guilt), at mapili pa sa morality. kaya kahit anong galaw mo bilang isang babae, feeling mo ang daming mata nakatutok sayo, ang bilis nila manghusga at sila pa yung gumagawa ng mga desisyon mo, binubuo pa yung buhay mo kahit hindi mo pa nga naaabot o nakakabuo ng pangarap mo. mahirap maging babae sa pilipinas, and the film portrays the harsh reality so honestly. “drown out the noise” a line that rises above judgement, criticism, and societal pressure. sana mapaunlad ang sistema natin sa healthcare at para sa kababaihan, at sana mas marami sa atin ang maka-gets.",-1

Sunshine,GOD i love that they used the kids as their conscience  great movie putanginaaaaaa,-1
Sunshine,oh i love woman with big heart,7
Sunshine,"Sunshine affected me deeply. The film explored women’s autonomy with so much honesty, and the characters’ struggles and victories felt incredibly real. I loved how it showed the layered challenges that come with unwanted pregnancies and the emotional, physical, and social weight women carry. The story treated its themes with grace and intelligence, and I truly believe it deserves a wide audience.One of the most powerful elements came from Sunshine’s relationship with her sister. Watching the difficulty of her sister’s life, especially the reality of raising a child, shaped her own decision. It felt like she saw her future in that picture, a future filled with sacrifices and dreams placed on hold. That glimpse alone said so much about choice, survival, and the pressure placed on women.The film also opened an entire landscape of conversations. Misogyny, women’s choices, abortion, body autonomy, laws, healthcare, and the quiet burdens carried by women in this country. These are everyday truths, yet they rarely reach the screen with this level of sincerity. I crave more stories with this courage, stories that explore mature themes with depth and curiosity. This film touched many important ideas and left me eager for even richer layers. Symbolism filled the entire narrative, and I loved how each detail carried emotional weight. I could spend an entire afternoon unpacking everything.One scene stays with me the most. The motel sequence. The stillness, the rumble of the train, her actions, and the aftermath created a breathtaking moment. That scene captured the danger of doing something unfamiliar to one’s body and the immense pressure created by law and religion. It felt intense, raw, and beautifully crafted.And the presence of the kid as her guilty conscience completed the emotional arc in such a striking way. It felt like a final haunting reminder of everything she carried.",-1
Sunshine,"What I love the most of this film is the face-on paradoxes that unfortunately reflects the reality. You see a doctor, who is supposed to save lives regardless, ignore a teenager because she took pills. You see the main character fully knowing the consequences of her actions but most people around her thinks she should do this or that. And you see pro-life always insisting that the aborted children could be someone great, but never giving a glance to those…",5
Sunshine,"the amount of pain a woman is forced to endure simply for wanting to live her own life is insane. it's difficult enough to choose between your dreams and your own body, and society makes that choice even harder. women are constantly penalized for seeking freedom and wanting to build their own future; nothing we do is truly allowed to be for ourselves. such an incredible performance from maris racal, i genuinely think she conveys the very soul of the film just with her eyes. so so good, definitely something everyone needs to watch and absorbside note: my sister and her girlfriend watched this in theaters and met maris racal LMAO",-1

Sunshine,reviewhan kta pagkatapos ng finalsgets na gets ko na,33
Sunshine,"Its quite a good movie, an eye-opener to this kind of issue, especially in a conservative country. There are some dragging scenes lang, particularly the running scenes, which took up too much time instead of giving more depth to the plot. But overall, its still a good one.",8
Sunshine,"this is a film that shows several harsh realities that many young women face every day. it tackles sensitive yet crucial issues such as unplanned pregnancy, illegal abortion, sexual assault committed by a family member, the heavy influence of religion on decision-making, and how one snap can completely shatter a young person’s future. these themes are not exaggerated; they are painful and real. “Mahirap maging babae, mas lalo na babae sa Pilipinas.”the film drop a reality line about women especially here in the philippines. this resonates the lived experiences of countless young women who grew up navigating a society that often blames them first before offering help.the movie also embodied the noises—the noise of judgment from society, the noise of broken dreams, and the noise coming from people who desperately need help but have nowhere to turn. it speaks out that the loudest sound isn’t the chaos of Manila’s streets, but the silent cries of countless helpless women. the film exposes the flaws in our cultural, social, and institutional systems, making it easy to see where we are lacking the most.the scene showing the overcrowded OB department in a public hospital was somehow alarming. it’s chaotic, understaffed, and overcrowded—yet this reflects reality. it reveals how instead of creating long-term solutions, government tend to simply acknowledge the issue or, worse, disregard it. the systems remain weak and unresponsive.beyond all of these social issues, the film also shows how dreams can easily collapse under the weight of societal pressure. this makes the film more than just a film—it becomes a moviefied reflection of the everyday struggles of filipino youth, especially young women who are forced to grow up too fast.overall, the movie sunshine is a wake-up call. it’s a call for empathy, understanding, and meaningful change.",-1

Sunshine,"PH GOV, PASS THE FUCKING BILL U HYPOCRITES",27
Sunshine,"Hindi ako magaling sa pag kritiko ng mga bagay-bagay, lalo na sa mga pelikula. Pero sinusubukan ko. Ang pelikulang ""Sunshine"" idinirekta ni Antoinette Jadaone sobrang danas at isyu sa bansang Pilipinas. Ang ganda ng set sa manila, ang raw, rinig at ramdam mo ang init, sikip, usok, baho, at gulo. Noong tatapatin pa lang niya yung nakabuntis sa kanya itong salita agad ang pumasok sa isip kong sasabihin ng lalaki e,""Sigurado ka bang sa akin 'yan?"" Ito talaga ang una mong maririnig sa isang lalaki kapag sinabi ng isang babae na ""buntis ako"". Walang hiyang linya 'yan imbes na pagsuporta kay Sunshine pagdududa ang ibibigay para ikaila yung responsibilidad, lalaki nga. hahahahaha, sorry kung may pagka discriminate sa parteng ito pero iyan ang reyalidad. Sunod naman yung batang si Anika, noong una hindi ko gets bakit bigla siyang susulpot at mawawala. Para sa akin para siyang inner child ni Sunshine kung susuriin yung pelikula sa bandang dulo nang tinuloy ni Sunshine na gamitin yung nabiling gamot sa Ale sa quiapo, basta fast-forward sa tricycle, makikita na yung legs ni Anika ay may dugo rin which is sign na ganon ang epekto ng nabili niyang gamot o pag abort, hindi ko ma explain pero gets na yan, at kung paano huminga si Sunshine ganoon din siya noong isinusugod na siya sa hospital. Tapos parang noong una hindi pa gets ni Anika yung mga desisyon ni Sunshine sa kagustuhang magpa abort pero yung sa huli nakita niya kung paano mahal at gusto ni Sunshine yung pangrap niya kaya I love the part na sinabi niya na ""gets ko na"" ika niya nga. Tapos if you think yung pagintindi ay hindi nanggaling sa iba kundi sa sarili niya diba????? So, ito na nga dahil binanggit ko na ang quiapo, gusto ko rin yung scene na matapos niyang malaman na buntis siya dumiretso agad siya sa simbahan para mag dasal. why? kasi may guilt siya part niya sana gets niyo ako, staka super religious o predominant catholic itong bansa natin, sana gets hahahaha...tapos diba yung binilhan ni Sunshine ng pangpa abort parang katabi o malapit sa simbahan parang na pinipilit ng relihiyon at batas ang mga babae sa isang krisis, ngunit ang parehong lugar din ang kanilang takbuhan para maghanap ng bawal na solusyon. Sobrang konserbatibong bansa. At sunod ulit yung pag bili niya ng illegal na pangpa abort, no choice e, walang health care sa mga katulad niyang may ganoong problem. diba? ang lala ng sistema, walang program na pwedeng lapitan right away. Kasi ano ang unang nangyayari o ginagawa ng mga tao pag ang isang babae ay buntis, ang gagawin ng ibang tao manghusga ngunit hindi naman handang magbigay ng practical na tulong. Kaya ang katuwang lang ng babae ay sino? Sarili, dignidad, at pangrap. Kaya, gets ko si Sunshine sa mga desisyon niya, it's a relief for her kung gagawin niya yung illegal. At huli, sobrang galing ni Maris Racal, hanga ako, dalang-dala niya talaga yung bigat ng karakter. Mata-mata acting at yung pag perform niya galing. Huli na talaga, gustong-gusto ko ang mura ng batang si Anika, galing! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",3

Sunshine,Wonderful movie with an exceptional meaning thay I think coming from a very conservative country is very important to talk about. It is not the most visually stunning movie but it had some incredible shots. It is a well-made film and the heart of it is what really made it an even better one. I love it when movies really present a story that challenges their audience to think about and start a conversation for. It is so enticing and deeply original in a way that it tried to tackle a story that is morally frowned upon in the Philippines so having a brave set of creative to present is just impressive. The performances of the entire cast is truly memorable and that scene from Maris and Jennica will be an important one that would heal so many hearts. It is an important story to talk about and I am glad that they did with so much care for the people who might get involved with it while teaching thise that needs to understand it better.,-1

Sunshine,"gets ko naHabang tumatakbo ang pelikula, ramdam ko ‘yung bigat ng lahat, pero mas naiyak ako nung sandaling pinili niyang unahin ang pangarap niya—kasi yun naman ang nararapat. Mahirap pala talaga maging babae, lalo na sa mundong mabilis humusga pero ang bagal umunawa. Sana dumating ‘yung panahon na ang isang babae puwede ng mamili ng landas niya nang walang mata na sumusunod at walang bibig na nagbibitaw ng panghusga.",-1

Sunshine,"gets na gets kita, sunshine. this film shows how every women struggles due to pregnancy; and how abortion is only the solution they'd think of— to save their dream, for them to have a better future for themselves.i'm just so amazed how every scene on this movie portrays how filipinos act towards women who gets pregnant at the very young age— and how religious people have always something to say on that. putangina rin kasi napakita rito kung paano na 'yong lalaki, kayang makatakas sa responsibilidad pero 'yong babae, buhat-buhat lahat ng bigat at problema na mayroon sa mundo. it's just so frustrating yet painful to watch, and i despise that this scenario can happen to everyone in real life.if a woman doesn't want a child, then so be it.",-1
Sunshine,"Sunshine itu film yang keliatannya lembut, tapi makin lama ditonton makin kerasa nyentil. Ceritanya ngikutin seorang remaja yang harus menghadapi tekanan dari lingkungan, keluarga, sampai norma sosial yang bikin hidupnya seolah bukan miliknya sendiri. Film ini juga pake simbol dan momen hening buat nunjukkin betapa sempitnya ruang gerak yang dia punya.Yang aku suka, filmnya nggak pernah maksa penonton buat mikir searah. Banyak hal dibiarkan ambigu, tapi justru itu yang bikin interpretasinya hidup. Kita diajak ngikutin proses dia ngambil kembali kendali atas tubuh dan masa depannya, pelan-pelan, tanpa drama berlebihan. Aku merasa ada satu titik di mana semuanya terasa klik. Bukan karena dijelasin, tapi karena apa ya bisa pahamlah gitu dari caranya bersikap dan bertindak.Akhirnya juga bukan yang gimana-gimana, tapi ya kerasa personal dan melegakan. Intinya sih, ini sebuah film tentang betapa susahnya perempuan punya pilihan di tempat yang konservatif, dan gimana tetap bisa berdiri di atas kaki sendiri meski nggak ada yang dukung.",20
Sunshine,excellent casting and metaphors,-1
Sunshine,"why do people feel qualified to make life decisions for a woman whose struggles they’ve never lived? if filipinos spent half as much time listening as they do lecturing, maybe fewer women would be forced to suffer in silence. and just to be clear, you don’t get authority over a body you’ll never have to carry.",11

Sunshine,"BAKIT PINAKITA UNG ANO NUNG BABY?!Nonetheless, movie was good and Maris’ acting was good din. Ngl, it made me cry kasi it reflected how often mothers had to choose between their career, their future or keeping the life growing inside of them.Very optimistic how the movie ends pero most of the time a lot of women dies dahil lang sa illegal abortion sa bansa natin. Fuck up how they portray what happened to that 13 years old girl and how some people enables those who took advantage of the vulnerable.",-1
Sunshine,"f men nd religious mindset talaga. bakit kayo ba makakaramdam ng hirap na mararamdaman ng nag dadalang tao? bakit niyo pinipilit ang babae na magbuntis even though they know to themselves na hindi pa sila ready to be a mother? it does not make sense how abortion is “murder” IT IS A FETUS. let the women decide what they want to their body. let them choose their dream first. f people who does not get this movie, kase ako gets ko na.",4

And ig I truly am a recto girly cause wdym I walk those streets and recognized them right awayAmazing film to watch right after compre,6
Sunshine,"Where do I even begin? It’s heart wrecking to realise that still there’s a country with total ban on “Abortion” irrespective of the way got the girl pregnant (even rape) or the condition of the pregnant woman.It’s cruelty!Scenes were so raw depicting the hard to digest reality. Unimaginable curse of being a child bearing gender in this stupid stupid world. How much inequality have we imposed on them in different ways and names.Where she just keeps hitting her stomach with bare hand hoping it’d kill the baby or the approach of bringing in surrealism (or mythology) to show the unborn kids’ connection and interactions with their yet to give birth Mom had made it much more harder for us to come over it. Hypothetically speaking, “If I ever get a girl child I’d call her Sunshine” Coming from rural India, I guess without much realisation I had recently developed a more liking towards Asian cinemas. It makes me feel more connected and more personal. Not just with the main characters but each and every moving and non-moving, told and untold, shown and hidden subjects in every single frame.",4
Sunshine,slayyy,1
Sunshine,"What is worse than living in a country that has outdated laws/systems/infrastructure? Having no one to share your suffering with.Sunshine only gained clarity when she felt supported by her older sister - that at the end of the day, she gets to have control and the final say to whatever her decision is. Giving agency to the people whose decisions will only affect them anyway sounds so simple since you can apply it to almost anything, but once abortion is mentioned, suddenly some people want to control the decisions of other people.Religion is obviously at the forefront of this topic. People forget that their religion is based on faith, not objective truth. It is still crazy to me that we live in an age where you could educate yourself, yet some of us still blindly choose to follow a random book that was written by a random person thousands of years ago.Kudos to Jadaone and team for making this important and (unfortunately) still relevant film.",4
Sunshine,the religious ppl will hate this one but bro this is so good it made me cry....... there's so so many young women who must be going thru this rn and yet there's no way to help themselves bc what should be accessible is illegal,37
Sunshine,"teh...di ko alam...kung ano sasabihin...kala ko di ako maiiyak kumikirot puso koso many thoughts pero to keep it short, we needed this film to existbalikan ko toh kapag maayos na ang thoughts",6
Sunshine,damn everything is just... good,-1
Sunshine,"All I can say is that this film is undeniably brave—brave enough to tackle a timely and controversial issue within a country shaped by religious beliefs, societal judgment, and limited access to healthcare. For Sunshine, the act of making a decision carries extraordinary weight, as she becomes fully aware of the consequences that she will have to faceI appreciate that the filmmakers not only showed how Sunshine arrived at her decision, but also place emphasis on why she makes it. The narrative thoughtfully explores the influences, pressures, and circumstances that frame her choices, allowing the audience to understand her on a deeper level.The film effectively captures the bleak realities and unfiltered rawness of Manila, which it is easy for me to say “gets ko na”—to agree with certain moments and empathize with Sunshine’s actions, precisely because the film enables us to feel the gravity of her experiences.This work is a feat for Filipino cinema. I hope more Filipino filmmakers continue to produce films that spark meaningful conversation and illuminate social realities capable of influencing society. Kudos to the cast, director, producers, and entire crew for this compelling piece of storytelling.",20
Sunshine,"ang ganda! loved the cinematography, the symbols, the dialogue, everything! sorry medyo nacornyhan ako nung una sa role nung bata na sumusunod kay sunshine pero it works naman. naiparating yung message na gusto iparating",6
Sunshine,"This is different from the genres I usually go for but I’m glad I watched it. Acting is good and the script is wow.I love her dialogue when she firmly said she did not want to be a mother in front of her man-child ex. The guy was looked like the apology was forced out of him. He always looked at his dad as if may ambag ang papa niya sa kasalanan. Loved the 2nd to the last clip of her practicing. She is so passionate about her craft. I’m not sure cause I skilled some of her routine but in the whole movie, I think this is the part where she got her routine right. She did apply what her coach said, to leave her problems aside and just embrace the moment. The side characters are so carefully placed to further progress the story. This movie should be seen by more people just cause it highlights a sensitive topic people don’t really want to address.",-1
Sunshine,"naiyak ako puta hindi naman ako buntis, basta tangina ng mga religious people and especially MEN. kairita yung tito ni menggay sana mabulok sa impyerno ganong mga tao. hindi valid opinion pagdating sa abortion kapag walang puke ah, pati mga taong sumasamba sa Diyos pero masahol ugali. sunshine, hindi mo ako kilala pero proud ako sayo : )",3
Sunshine,"This is movie is trying to balance being athletic and having a baby on the way, the bad part is you get pregnant and ur boyfriend leave you to deal with and don’t even helped, she had little her in her mind, and tried to buy multiple pills to kill her baby because she isn’t ready ,love this movie I have someone to relate to this!",5
Sunshine,"NAPAKAGANDA. nakakagalit, nakakaiyak at nakakatuwa. humagulgol ako lalo na sa sitwasyon ng batang edad trese anyos lang. nakita rin dito kung gaano kabulok ang sistema ng healthcare sa pinas at kung gaano kalala ang stigma para mga ayaw maging ina. karapatan ng mga babae ang gawin kung ano gusto nila sa katawan nila.GETS NA GETS KITA SUNSHINEang dami kong gusto sabihin pero eto nalang, walang sinumang babae ang dapat nakararanas ng ganito. marami ang dapat pag-usapan tungkol dito pero hindi pa handa ang pilipinas para sa diskusyong ito",3
Sunshine,tangina pagtapos ko panoorin pakiramdam ko ang dungis ko na e. dama ko yung polusyon ng maynila at frustration ni sunshine paikot ikot sa quiapo. sana kung gaano kadali bitawan ng lalaki ang responsibilidad ay gano'n din kadali mawala ang bigat sa babae. medyo pwede na sya. di ko lang maiwasan isipin kung ilang sunshine kaya ang pinili na lang tahakin ang buhay ng isang ina kesa piliin ang pangarap nila. gets?,3

Sunshine,"- very realistic and grounded film - i really like the portrayal of the secret and illegal pampalaglag na mga gamot in the shadows of the quiapo church. very contrasting- i also like how the ending is ""show not tell"". majority of the filipino films always tend to over explain the plot by ""telling"" which leaves little to no space for meaningful analysis from the audience- unexpected piolo pascual cameo lol- overall this movie delivers a strong…",-1
Sunshine,"nice sya, super raw kaya kitang kita yung reality ng system sa ph lol. Glad she chose what would make her happier. TAS UNG ENDING ALSO THATS WHEN I REALIZED",-1
Sunshine,"The cinematography, the composition, the colours, and the character were all absolutely stunning. This was obviously handled with so much care and love, as it should be, you can tell that the director has a clear vision of exactly what she wants the film to feel and look like which was executed flawlessly. I will never know what it’s like to be a woman with child but this film made me feel all the conflicted, complicated, and crushing emotions of what it’s like to make that oh so difficult decision. Yes it’s incredibly sad yet she has to make the choice that’s best for her even though it literally breaks every inch of her soul. It accurately portrays Filipino society’s perception around abortion and how religion and gender roles play an integral part in the whole ordeal when it absolutely should not. It should be between the woman and her doctor alone, the outsiders opinion only makes this life altering decision so much harder than it already is. It’s so wonderfully nuanced and so so beautiful, thank you for keeping Filipino cinema alive Sunshine. I also loved that her kid had a rainbow shirt on which comes after a sunshine.",-1
Sunshine,this hits too close to home,21
Sunshine,hayy,1
Sunshine,"wow, kuhang kuha ng pelikulang ito ang mga karanasan, karahasan, at kasuklaman na nararanasan ng mga kababaihan. sa itsura palang ni maris, kuhang-kuha yung danas ng mga babaeng may pinagdaraanan at may pangarap na pinaglalaban. ang talino lang din ng concept sa batang si annika, “the daughter she could have had”. pati yung constant na pagsulpot ni annika, representation ng guilt na nararamdaman ni sunshine, considering na philippines is a conservative country. kuhang kuha rin ng mga lalaking characters sa…",3
Sunshine,"watched with my mom on netflix. we never talked about abortion, pero nung narinig niya sinabi ni sunshine na ayaw niya pa maging ina, nag comment siya, “ayaw niya pa maging nanay kasi may pangarap siya.”",4
Sunshine,"""gets ko na.""sana gets nyo rin, tangina.",0
Sunshine,Isang yakap sa lahat ng Sunshine,2
Sunshine,"Hindi lang tungkol sa kung ano ang pinipili mo, kundi kung bakit mo kailangang pumili.The film reminds us that while we argue about what's right and wrong, may mga taong bitbit ang bigat ng mundong hindi natin kailanman mararamdaman. And those people have to make decisions that sometimes are not acceptable to norms or beliefs. But Maris Racal delivers a story of a girl na hindi humihingi ng sympathy kundi karapatan. Karapatan na mamili. Karapatan na magpatuloy. Karapatan na mangarap. For me, it's not just a simple talk tungkol sa abortion; it’s about access, fairness, and acknowledging na hindi tayo pare-pareho ng laban.We don’t have to personally want what Sunshine wants. Pero we must understand why she has to fight for it. Kung bakit may mga oportunidad na dapat bukas para sa lahat kahit na hindi natin ito kailangan. Kung hindi mo gets kung bakit may kailangang pumili, maybe you are privileged enough na hindi mo pa kailangan mamili.And that’s exactly why we must always choose compassion.",-1

Sunshine,infairnessss,1
Sunshine,"this is an important movie in the Philippines. this kind of theme is controversial due to being hidebound by our culture, and i know the ending is a bit vague, but i love how a woman chooses herself, her dreams, and her passion. this movie is a hug from every woman, especially Filipino women. mabuhay kayo.",26
Sunshine,"“Pangarap ko din mga pangarap mo, Sunshine”This movie was so beautifully written, directed and acted. Grabe, hands down kay maris kasi ramdam na ramdam mo yung emosyon niya and struggle throughout the whole movie. This literally depicts women around the philippines—-no matter what economic class they may be— when it comes to teenage pregnancy. Whether or not we care to admit it, no teenage pregnancy is planned and the toll that has on a developing woman will never ever ne experienced by ANY man. So miggy, pakyu.Pero grabe, you can feel the internal battle Sunshine was going through and I think that every single woman who has a dream, a goal in life perhaps, if situated the same, would go through the same lengths. Maybe not through all of that extent, but this is such an eye opening movie to those who still feel like abortion in the philippines is taboo. You would literally rather have all these women dying instead of getting and giving them the right medical treatment? These are children, btw. Yes, they did adult things but bear in mind that there is no such thing as a consenting child in the eyes of the law.Oh Antoinette Jadona, the woman that you are. Thanks for showing us a movie that says na we can choose ourselves. We can decide our future and no amount of guilt trip—whether it be from the church or from any ball-lacking man—can stop us from persuing that.",-1
Sunshine,"It’s always “labag yan sa batas ng Diyos” but never “naiintindihan mo ba ako?” This film carefully define failures of this country. Ang ironic lang for me na kalat sa labas ng Quiapo ang bentahan ng mga gamot pampalaglag, habang ang sistema natin ay patuloy na tutol sa ganitong paraan. Goosebumps when my friends and I noticed the sign sa jeep saying “Gift of God”, we came up with only one assumption of what that sign is trying to tell the viewers. Simply, babies are a blessing. And that’s what they’ll always say whenever abortion comes up in a conversation.The symbolism of the Kid who has been following Sunshine all throughout the film. My first assumption was— she was the conscience of the latter. Obviously, lumalabas siya every time na may gagawin si Sunshine sa pagbubuntis niya. Siya ang constant reminder na lahat nang gagawin niya ay mali. Second, it was Sunshine’s younger version. Trying to tell her something. Pero bandang dulo ng film it was revealed na it was the baby. I would like to believe na malaki ang naging parte niya sa naging desisyon ni Sunshine. Because Sunshine was the happiest when she’s doing what she love. Walang karapatan ang kahit sino man sa magiging desisyon ng babae para sa katawan niya.Super dami kong pang gustong sabihin sa film na ‘to kasi super pleased ako sa mga details and symbolisms. Right, decision din to watch it with my friends hahaha. Ayun lang! Maris Racal is a really really remarkable artist. And also, Direk Antoinette Jadaone always timely and relevant ng mga films. Super galing!",6
Sunshine,"wow, maris… kakaiba ka. read smth on twitter that said, maris may have her faults but you can’t deny that she is a really great actress… And i agree wholeheartedly. i watched this with my dad, not knowing what the plot is (i was never spoiled either). kala ko tungkol sa gymnastics lang pero ito ung mga topic na hindi talaga pinag-uusapan, lalong-lalo na sa pamilya. i’m glad that he got to see women’s pov when it comes to these topics cos where else would he ever hear about them? this is what the purpose of movies are. ung talagang gagawa ka ng plataporma para sa lahat ng manonood na makita ung pananaw ng mga tao sa lipunan, lalong-lalo na ung mga hindi naman talaga pinakikinggan at pinaniniwalaan. nakita ko rin ung kahit na kala ng mga tao wala lang ung mga nagtitinda sa gilid, pero isang malaking tulong na un sa iba. sobrang ganda ng pagkakagawa ng pelikulang ito. ganda ng cinematography, screenplay, tsaka ng mismong kuwento. talagang hindi kulang eh. walang kulang, walang sobra. direct to the point. hindi ko alam ano pa hindi maiintindihan ng ibang tao rito. empathy talaga kailangan natin sa mundong ‘to.",-1

WE ALL SHOULD FUCKING CUT ALL OF THEIR DICKS.i may not be a women but i am human enough to understand and to sympathize with the movie. i rlly can't believe and phantom how fucking unfair the society is to women. they have been experiencing millions of years of oppression and deprivation of basic health care. how long do we normalize it? how fucking long do women have to fucking sacrifice. LEGALIZE ABORTION NOW.,34
Sunshine,“break the stigma” we all say in unison,-1
Sunshine,"i have so many thoughts about this movie so i might just make edits. also i only got to watch it now kasi kakarelease lang sa netflix first i just wanted to applaud the use of background noises. i think im so used to movies relying on ‘noise cancellation’ that the background sounds were so instantly noticeable for me, and i understood it as something integral to the plot na ‘sunshine’s story is just one sound among many’, and thinking about how noisy these public spaces are (quiapo, avenida) parang ang liit tignan ng buhay ni sunshine tuloy. and it’s so real that society tends to overlook the lives of these women where they’re commonly diminished into statistics or cautionary talesi can even argue that in some instances, like sunshine praying outside the quiapo church or secretly talking to the pamparegla seller, is a ‘background noise’ in itself. naingayan ako sa mga scenes na yun to the point where the dialogue was just blending with the background noise. it really says a lot about how these stories are just among us, and it’s so devastating to think that something as serious as this matter (something hindering of one’s ambitions and with the capacity of changing the direction of one’s life) blends so well with noise we consider every-day and mundanesecond, this movie really touched my pathos  given my positionality as a woman. the scrolling on reddit, silently looking for online communities or help..ugh i understood the frustration of being a woman in a catholic country so well. i obviously have never been pregnant, but when im at the BIOLOGICAL age for it, ang scary to think na we don’t have that option at all, na our bodily autonomies are immediately disregarded by others just because of personal beliefs. ang daming instances when i was watching na iniisip ko nalang ‘what if that were me?’ SYEMPRE WAG NAMAN SANA PERO that’s the point diba? for the movie to put us in the shoes of sunshine and make us FEEL that we don’t want to be in her shoes. that way we’ll think of challenging the system that we currently have but i really love how despite the circumstances, sunshine was still adamant about being true to her autonomy and GANUN talaga dapat. i heard the ending was supposed to be different, but im so glad they changed it to this",-1
Sunshine,"got surpised when the film ended, a “hala tapos na?” na-bitin moment. but maybe it felt that way because there’s no complete ending to the struggle of sunshine. whether she chose herself or her kid, habang buhay niyang dadalhin ito because people will shame her regardless.i hope the world becomes a little bit kinder to women like sunshine.",-1
Sunshine,good intention but extremely bad execution,1
Sunshine,"this wouldve been a 1.5 if it weren’t for the importance of this movie and its effectiveness regardless of cinematic quality. idc if characters make bad/weird decisions, just make it have a glimpse of logical reasoning (which includes logical illogicality) i would support it. an absurd amount of suspension of belief is required for this movie which doesn’t make sense to me in a movie where most of the situations are so grounded in reality anyway. It tries to do too much for its own good. The sequence of events make no sense, relationships with people have no emotional weight aside from Sunshine and her sister, ang gulo. The whole Ariana thing suddenly having a That’s so Raven moment. Giving a stranger you just met 5 minutes ago 1K. Calling your unborn kid with no name “bata”. Wait Sunshine can see others’ unborn children too? Just sloppy rough writing overall. If there rest of the movie were like the last 10 minutes (the confrontation with the dad is the highlight of this movie for me) maybe this would’ve been great!EDIT: okay so nagka That’s so Raven moment sya kasi nafeel nya sa katawan ng nanay nya ok gets ko na",23
Sunshine,"some bits I especially liked: - sunshine praying just outside the church, feeling unworthy to enter for what she's about to do- her sister helping her stretch her shoulders, trying to motivate her by saying ""SEA games"" ""olympics"" and so on, accidentally doing what is opposite her intention and instead adding a burden to sunshine's shoulders. - the focus on rape-incest cases. it happens so much in our country but its been kept under wraps for way too long. im glad a film that has gained this much traction helped put it, and the many ways that it's the mothers and maternal figures that facilitate such violations of their own children has been put to light. i felt conflicted watching what is supposed to be these imaginary consciousnesses of unborn children running about and acting as, what i initially thought to be, a device for invoking guilt in these young and unwilling kids and anger in its audience. but perhaps they were an avenue for the world to understand that while they have a future too, so does sunshine. so does the thirteen year old. what are these pastors and doctors planning for /their/ future? anyways im glad the movie stuck by its pro-abortion stances and did not pull back any punches. women's and children's healthcare has been on a serious decline in this country. its high time we see changes that put women as priority not some hypothetical individual.",-1
Sunshine,“Sunshine” hit me way too real. It made me think about my mom and all the dreams she had before life rushed her. Sometimes I wish I could go back and tell her she could skip my part for a moment and chase everything she wanted.,-1

Sunshine,first thing i said was i hated the exposition. i don't need to be explicitly bombarded with information about the character in the first 3 minutes if they're gonna keep mentioning it throughout the whole movie! like fuck i get it she's going to the olympics i don't need all of the side characters to mention it. the cinematography is nice. the emotional continuity feels off at times and i wish they had better child actors. the kid having blood on her inner thighs doesn't make sense. this could've been sooooo good if it was a proper serious film but they did get their point across,-1

Sunshine,"I had the chance to watch this at JAFF 2025. The plot twist is simple, but the message is powerful. The film highlights issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence involving minors. At JAFF, the director shared a little about how sexual issues are still considered taboo in the Philippines, and how the film also touches on the topic of abortion.Listening to the director speak at JAFF about the impact of this film, several discussions regarding cases of sexual harassment and violence in the Philippines have begun to open up, even if only slightly. According to him, this film has helped pave the way for filmmakers there to create similar works, which are still relatively rare.",-1

I was absolutely hurt when that one girl was ra*ed by her own uncle... and mind you she was only 13 years old. It also shows how stupid boys can be when it comes to getting a girl pregnant, how come they're so scared to take responsibility of what they've done. I also REALLY…",-1

Sunshine,"Gets kita Sunshine, gets ka namin.Grabe, napakahusay. I didn’t expect how emotional this film would make me feel — to the point that it got me all teary-eyed. ""Sunshine"" is one of those films that stirs something inside: It makes you see, it makes you feel, it makes you realize, and it makes you understand.Itong ""Sunshine"" ay hindi lang basta-bastang pelikula gaya ng iba, dahil sa malalim at mabigat nitong mensahe. Sunshine, the girl with big dreams who got pregnant too early. Mary Grace, a child neglected by her own Mother, and was raped and impregnated by her Uncle — these characters aren’t purely fictional; they reflect real-life problems that many have faced. Iilan lamang ang sitwasyon nina Sunshine at Mary Grace sa maraming dahilan kung bakit sang-ayon ako sa Abortion o Pro-choice.Abortion isn’t murder; it’s healthcare — this is a strong and profound message in the film. ""Sunshine"" is a film that goes beyond entertainment; it also functions as an eye-opener. I hope na mas marami pa ang manood ng movie na ‘to. Para ma-realize nila kung gaano kahalaga na i-legalize ang aborsyon sa bansa. Kasi, sa totoo lang, napakaraming problema na puwedeng ma-solve kapag na-legalize na ang aborsyon (e.g., poverty, suicide cases, unemployment, uneducated people, etc.).Ang solid talaga nito, pati ‘yung mga bwisit na chismosa at religious people na nagpapaka-saint kuhang-kuha. But joke aside, nakakainis talaga ‘yung mga nagmamagaling na ‘yan, ta’s gagamitin pa ang Bible para i-justify ang pagiging ignorante nila. Like please, can’t they learn to set aside their religious beliefs and think about what truly matters?! They disagree, solely because the bible says it’s a sin. But what about those who have (and will) suffer? All they care about is that the baby gets delivered, but what comes after that? They don’t care. They really know how to be a pain in the ass.",-1
Sunshine,"mahal na mahal kita Sunshine!!! bigla kong na-gets yung sinabi ng mama ko na tumatak talaga sa’kin. she once told me, during a fight, na sana hindi niya na lang ako binuhay. i know it’s an inappropriate thing to say to your child, pero now i kinda understand where it came from.hindi ko siya kayang i-hate. alam ko na she was once a “Sunshine” too na punong-puno ng pangarap, at nawala ang lahat ng ’yon nung nabuntis siya sa’kin. maybe we can use the quote “rejection is redirection,” pero masakit isipin na she could’ve done better. i can’t blame her for having the what-ifs of her past. hindi niya kasalanan na she grew up in a conservative, religious country. systemic talaga ang lahat. alam ko na mahal na mahala ako ng nanay ko pero hindi ko rin siya masisi kung may regret pa rin siya about the dreams she never got to chase.this movie helped me understand her side a bit more, and somehow, it helped me forgive her for saying that thing.sana maging legal na ang abortion sa Pilipinas. at sana mas maraming kababaihan ang maging katulad ni Sunshine na patuloy na pipiliin ang sarili at pangarap.",-1
Sunshine,"aside from being a tad bit short for my liking, i have no notes. this movie perfectly encapsulated the reality most women experience. women are deprived of choices when it comes to this because of the possibility of being persecuted. and I'm glad Sunshine made a decision solely for herself and her dreams. women should never be scared nor be subjected to subjugation by beliefs such as religion for a decision made for herself. i will always support women who knows what they want and what they don't. until it's your life, you have no right to decide. standing ovation for Maris for being so natural. she nailed this role. and shout out to Ms. Antonette for this masterpiece.

Sunshine,"Gets kita.Wala pang kalahating oras nang ipakita ang eksena kung saan humingi ng tawad si Sunshine sa harap ng simbahan—Tagos. Ramdam agad ang emosyon at ang mensahe. Sabay na nakakalungkot at nakakagalit kung iyong iisipin na sa bawat tagpi ng eksena ay ipinapamukha ng pelikulang ito ang tunay na representasyon at kalagayan ng mga kababaihin patungkol sa aborsyon at 'reproductive health' sa Pilpinas: mahirap at nakakasuka. Importante ang bawat sulok ng pelikulang ito lalung lalo na ang pananalamin sa estado at kasuluksulukan ng Quiapo. Sa bawat busina at usok ng mga jeep, sa bawat ingay ng mga tao, sa bawat lakad ng mga kababaihan na may sabay na bitbit na pangarap at problema, hinding hindi maikukumpara kung gaano kasalimuot ang kanilang mga nararanasan. Kaya kung napanood mo ito at hindi ka pa sumasang-ayon, naway isipin mo ang mahabaging desisyon na bitbit ni Sunshine (hindi man ito aayon sa kultura at relihiyon ng ating bansa), sapagkat ito ay mahalagang proposal na dapat isaalang-alang ng nakararami.",3
Sunshine,"First of all, hands down kay Maris. Knowing na inaral niya talaga yung gymnastics, grabe yung dedication. Kudos din to Direk Antoinette—this film shows how women are so easily labeled, judged, and stereotyped by society. Malaking isyu pa rin talaga ang aborsyon sa Pilipinas.This film shows kung paano napipilitan ang mga babae bumili ng illegal abortion pills kahit alam nilang delikado, dahil banned pa rin ang abortion sa’tin.

Sunshine,"BOW DOWNDirek Antonette Jadaone NEVER MISSES!! Sobrang gandang representation ng mga kababaihang desperadong lumaban para sa mga pangarap nila. I like how this movie showed how we, women, help each other lalo na yung mga nakakatanda na sobrang lawak ng pag-iisip at talagang iniintindi yung sitwasyon ng kaharap nila, syempre hindi maiiwasan ang judgement lalo na sa bansang paurong ang usad. Maybe for me may ups and downs lang yung role ni anikka co and ariana kasi I feel like they’re the representation of unbord child of Rhed Bustamante and Sunshine. I like their overall role pero kasi sumagi lang sa isip ko na what if may nakakanood ngayon na nasa same position ni sunshine and magmukhang giniguilt trip sila nung movie (sana gets nyo). That’s my not even a cent worth thought lang naman. And my message to those who are experiencing the same situation as Sunshine:Laban lang sa buhay bes. Laban lang (Insert tiktok audio) emeIt’s okay to feel scared and have regrets but I’m sure that you’ll make the right decision for yourself, not for anyone, not even for the clump of cells growing in your body. YOU will decide for your own body!",-1

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone did a great job again!Super satisfying sa decision ni Maris ""Sunshine"" rito. AYAW NYA MAGING INA PERIOD. Fuck the society na mas pipiliing maging bulag sa sitwasyon ng isang babae para lang masabing sumusunod sila sa utos ng diyos. Ang nakakainis pa rito, makikita mo sa mga reviews esp sa socmed na super sarado pa rin sila sa isyung ganito. Ano na? Hindi pa rin ba kayo ready sa usaping aborsyo? Paano tayo uunlad kung utak kalawang pa rin kayo?Hindi purke illegal ito sa bansa natin, doesn't mean na walang gumagawa nito.Which is FAXX. I will never judge a girl doing such thing no matter what her reason. Kahit makipag sex sya with consent or without her consent at may nabuo, it is her fucking choice kung ipapaabort nya or hindi. Super nakaka amaze yung ginawa ni sunshine, it is not easy to do such thing lalo na at health nya rin ang nakasalalay dito dahil walang safe na paraan kaya kailangan nyang sumugal. And i love her strong character, i know na deep inside she felt guilty but she know nmn na hindi sya ready and nasa peak na sya ng achieving her dreams e.To that guy na nakabuntis sa kanya at i know na maraming ganito actually irl, isa lang masasabi ko sa inyo, TANGINA NYO. Bakit kailangan isisi sa mga kababaihan at iguilt trip sila when in the first place mga lalaki nmn itong mga duwag at walng bayag? When a man is not ready to be a father, it's ok. But a woman who's not ready to be a mother, considered a sin. What kind of thinking is that?",3

Sunshine,"This movie unveiled how every unexpected pregnancy burdens solely the women. The men who always attempt to get away with their responsibility after learning the byproduct of their act. More significantly, the relevance of the depiction of the child on how the story and the plot progresses gives an emphasis on the acceptance of the sentiment of not wanting to conceive a child. How Maris' character dedicated most of her life doing something she loves: gymnastics, which can be taken away from considering her pregnancy--- she literally did everything and sacrificed everything to reach her dreams. The movie has conveyed the weight of abortion and how motherhood is a choice which is not tailored for all women.",5

IF YOU HAVE TIME PLEASE WATCH IT, VERY EYE-OPENER.Sa castings pa lang panalo, walang tapon, lahat ng characters nabigyan nila yung mga role nila ng hustisya, lahat ng emosyon tumatagos sa screen, nakakarating sa manunuod ng klaro. Kada umiiyak si Maris, umiiyak din ako.Direk Tonet, sobrang ganda ng pelikula mo, and super grateful ako na nakarating din to sa PH cinemas. I really think kailangan pa natin ng mga ganitong pelikula na nagtatackle ng mga controversial or taboo topics dito sa Pinas. It's a great medium to let people know kung anong realidad ang meron tayo. GANITO DAPAT ANG MGA PELIKULANG LUMALABAS SA SINEHAN.Lumabas ako ng sinehan na mapula ang mata at ilong, at di mapakali, gusto ko agad pag-usapan kung anong nangyari sa movie. Since I watched it alone, wala akong kasamang mapagdiskusyunan 'to. Now, I just decided to let out everything here. Up to you if babasahin mo to lolGusto ko pa sanang pagusapan yung main topic ng pelikula which is  abortion. Pero I guess, pagusapan na lang natin yan over coffee or beer xdend of yap. ”",6

But a woman’s life is ALSO A FUCKING LIFE. Hindi ko alam kung bakit ang hirap nitong intindihin para sa iba.This movie doesn’t just show the reality of unplanned pregnancy, it exposes why good quality and ACCESSIBLE healthcare is crucial and why fucking abortion needs to be legalized. It makes you realize how a corrupt, underfunded healthcare system, shaped by decades of neglect, ends up deciding the choices and safety of women. A country with no real healthcare access, outdated religious stigma, and a government that would rather shame women than help them traps women into choices they never truly want, and pushes them to resort to illegal and unsafe ways just to be able na mapalaglag na lang yung bata para makapagpatuloy sa kanilang buhay.

Sunshine,"The movie was very good. A bleak, reality-grounded conversation-starter on women’s reproductive rights in a conservative, third-world country like the Philippines. Maris and Jennica’s performances made the movie. Both the kids’ acting could’ve been better but not a dealbreaker at all. I hope this movie nudges Filipino public opinion to, at the very least, question their deep-seated perceptions on abortion. After all, it is in the dominant will of the public that reforms in policies occur. (Also, my first ever Letterboxd entry! Glad I started with this.)",13

Sunshine,"Very timely, thought-provoking, and polarizing at best. The Philippines is not ready for this film, and Jadaone's bravery in tackling this is truly commendable. Legalizing abortion is not just a moral dilemma anymore, but a systemic solution to the thousand more problems that exist before it. Systemic failure kills.",13

Also love how they portrayed the REAL-life situation of living in Manila—gulo, ingay, mga tarantado, atbp.Anyway, I just don't really get the random appearances of the Bata, IDK if it's supposed to be an actual ghost / hallucinations of Sunshine, or just really a random kid who actually follows her everywhere.",13

Sunshine,"“Naiintindihan mo bako?”“Gets ko na.”Gets ko na/naiintindihan ko are the words na lagi kong sinasabi sa mama ko but in so many different situations, the child and sunshine’s similarity to us is that, laging nabibring up sa usapan naming mag-ina yung mga what ifs ko for her as her daughter, what she could’ve been if she chose herself years ago. Hindi ko naiintindihan, are the words na lagi kong sagot kada ang response niya sakin ay “kasi ikaw ang buhay ko”, kasi ang kapalit nun sakin ay yung mga responsibilidad na maging mas matalino, mas magaling, na hindi option ang pumalpak, especially when it comes to decisions.Sabi ko, hindi ko naiintindihan kasi sayang. Lahat ng kung ano ako ngayon, lahat ng mga narating ko ngayon, dapat siya na yun, o mas higit pa kung nilakasan niya lang loob niya. Ika nga, in this world we can’t always get all that we want, kaya sa kabila ng bawa’t hindi ko maintindihan, siya ring may katapat na naiintindihan ko. Gets ko na, hindi pala na sayang, dahil siya din naman ang lahat ng kung ano ako ngayon, dahil dun palang sa pinili niya ako para maging anak niya, kahit pa na may kapalit iyong mga responsibilidad hindi lang para sakin kundi para din sa kaniya, dun palang sa araw na yun, isang matapang na pagpasya din ang ginawa niya para piliin na kaming dalawa ang magkakampi sa bawat laban na haharapin namin. Gets ko na, na hindi lang sakin to mahirap, na masyado ring mahirap itong mundong ito para sa kaniya, kaya’t ano pa’t para dumagdag pa ako sa mga kalaban niya.I feel like most daughters shares this same sentiments and dreams for their mothers of wanting them to choose themselves even if it means not having the chance to be born in this world, and that’s what makes me love this movie. It comforted me to have the perception of making that dream come true for my own mom. It showed the depth of the understanding between the mother and their child especially their daughters. Just when we thought it’s already deep, it could get more deeper.Gets ko na. Sabi ng anak ni sunshine sa kaniya, whom I still and highly believe na kakampi niya (bukod sa ate niya) on every step of her way dahil lahat ng pangarap na meron sila, lahat ng bawat sumunod na tagumpay ay para padin sa kanilang dalawa.",0

Sunshine,"My debut here on letterboxd inkigayo (chareng) and I wanted it to be about Sunshine because this is my movie of the YEAR! As a man na lumaki sa very conservative and religious na family, I’ve always been socially aware. I am pro abortion but I never really know kung gaano kalalim yung pinaglalaban natin, well atleast not until I saw this film.Bilang lalaki na manonood, I can only empathize & be compassionate towards sunshine because I feel like nobody can understand her better than women themselves. Highlight ng film for me is yung scene ni Maris sa motel, besides feeling a sense of dread, it also fills me with anger dahil babae pa din talaga ang sasalo sa lahat ng hirap. Anong ginawa ng nakabuntis? binigyan lang ng pera si sunshine, that’s it. Si sunshine yung naghirap, nasaktan, at napahiya. Kaya ang galing ng pelikula kasi nakuha niya gaano pa rin ka pabor ang mundo sa mga kalalakihan.Ang ganda ng casting, sobrang buhay nila na pwede ko lang silang makita sa labas ng bahay namin. Favorite performance ko ay si Maris at Jennica, hayop sa galing! (Grabe yung iyak ko sa kwarto scene nila) Ganda ng cinematography, editing, at music. Sa AWKP ko lang nakilala si Direk Tonet and I was NOT familiar with her game! Basta ang ganda at mabuhay pa ang mga gantong klaseng pelikula ",-1
Sunshine,"not every woman wants to be a mother.so, so, soooo refreshing to see an ambitious woman choose her own dreams over society’s forced motherhood. sabi nga ni bata (or Annika), “pangarap ko ang pangarap niya.” i really hope this film opens up better laws for reproductive and maternal health. sobrang nakakairita lang talaga na kung sino pa yung mga OB-GYN, sila pa yung mga taong madiin sa pananampalataya. motherhood is already troubling in itself, teenage pregnancy faced with a hateful doctor? that’s fucking worse.this is an incredible film that gave space for abortion and illegal abortions to be discussed in the philippines. it’ll definitely leave a bad taste in conservative filipinos’ mouths, but that’s the point. teenage mothers live their lives in discomfort everyday, so showing their realities and humanizing them is more than enough to make people realize that their own personhood should always come first before an embryo. hugs with consent to every girl or woman who’s going through a similar struggle. nawa’y mahanap niyo ang lakas na kinakailangan ninyo para malagpasan ang mga problema niyo. i just hope you all remember that what’s best for you, will also be what’s best for the child. and if what’s best is not having the child, then that’s the painful reality and you shouldn’t be ashamed for putting your wellbeing first. in the end, the best sign of motherhood is to never enter it in the first place. you can’t pour love into another cup if your own cup is empty. so, forge your own path and dance to your own beat—you will always be the master of your own ship. kudos, sunshine! congratulations on your gold.",5

Sunshine,"Can’t process my thoughts after watching this but one thing’s for sure: I love the path this movie took. Despite the offers of Miggy’s family and their guilt-driven grace, I’m so glad Sunshine rejected that because the point is that ayaw nga ni Sunshine maging nanay, hindi siya handa, hindi pa siya tapos sa mga pangarap niya. And that’s enough reason not to have a child. Sobrang hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas and I know every woman relates, or sympathizes, to Sunshine, one way or another.",-1

Sunshine,“drown out the noise”real.,-1
Sunshine,"This is a really controversial topic especially in the Philippines where abortion is not accepted both legally and as normal norm. Anyways, the movie did great in relying why sometimes some reasons do weigh more in terms of accepting an unwanted child birth, but well I do not actively support it but I respect it. I am not to judge to what they do, because sometimes when you think about it, like for instance that 13 girl who was raped by her mother's boyfriend(What an absolute ahole btw and also the mother??? which brings me that some women is not fit to be a mother. So if you do not want a child please don't be stupid and use protection like always.) is such a nightmare and to think that girl probably do not fully grasp the whole situation she is in, I understand why she also did what she did. Also to end this, if abortion is not allowed, why is contraceptive allowed? Like isn't like almost the same? You are not giving the reproductive cells do well some reproduction. The only difference is that abortion is the baby is already alive but the reproductive cells is prevented to be much more(a new life).",13

Sunshine,"Worth the year long wait, brilliant film and really cements Antoinette Jadaone as an Auteur of Philippine Cinema. I think what I found so strikingly sad about this is that, fourteen years removed from the Philippines (more than half of my life!); I try to tread carefully when I talk about Manila, the people and their struggles. I don't think that my incredibly sheltered memory of the place would hold as much cultural weight than that of a local, and yet fourteen years later Manila is still...Manila. And if I am brought to tears by this, I wonder about the grief carried by generations of young women failed by a dated system. In all her films, what Jadaone ultimately wants, or rather demands for her female protagonists, is Space. Space to exist safely and choose freely.To break women out of crowded public maternity wards with shared beds, obsolete facilities, abject doctors (with their religious biases), and to bring them into the clearing of their dreams, the main-stage gymnasium, the Olympics.",9
Sunshine,mahirap talaga umiyak pag may kasama,0
Sunshine,"“Ayoko maging nanay. Hindi ko ipapanganak ‘to dahil hindi ako ready maging nanay.” / English: I don’t want to be a mother. I won’t give birth to this child because I’m not ready to become a mother.Abortion is illegal in the Philippines, heck even being pro-choice here is looked down upon. Yet, motherhood is an expected life trajectory for many Filipino women, that is if you marry at the “right age” and have more than 1 child at the “right time”. So what choice do women have if they are pregnant under different circumstances? For a country that claims to be collectivist (pakikipagkapwa tao mindset ang dapat pinapairal, etc.), how can this principle become a universal behavior for most when its own government continues to throw its own citizens under the bus? Every dire problem that needs to be addressed can be traced back to how fucked Filipinos are by their government. Whatever rhetoric the Spaniards spread about Filipinos being “lazy” is still used today by the rich and powerful, their basis why the Philippines continues to be poor. Galit na galit ako sa nagtitinda ng mga pekeng “gamot” para sa pagpapalaglag ng bata, the review she showed Sunshine that it was effective could possibly be fake, pero narealize ko na nagbebenta sila ng pekeng solusyon para sa maka ahon sa buhay (not justification of this behavior). This government continues to fail people in every aspect of life, you’d realize why the crime is so high. But is it such a crime to not want a baby? (It is not).How can Filipinos truly care for the children (whether born or unborn) when elected officials undermine reproductive health in this country, primarily women’s health. The Reproductive Health Law faced a long legislative battle just to get passed, and it still took two years for the law to be fully accessible for the public. When your prospects are so thin, people will do anything to get what they want, even if it costs their life. That is a hard pill to swallow for a lot of Filipinos. At the end of the day, Filipinos are treated as just mere statistics in politics.",11

Sunshine,"Sunshine (2024) looks soft, warm, almost gentle on the surface. the colors cradle you, the scenes feel tender, and at first, you think it is comforting. but beneath all of that warmth carries a weight that is impossible to ignore. it is about abortion in the Philippines, where it is illegal, and labeled as “blasphemous,” “disgraceful,” and judged above the lives it affects. the film does not shy away from showing how cruel reality can be. people, even doctors, prioritize morality over humanity, ignoring the pain, the fear, and the uncertainty of the woman at the center. it shows a woman whose future and potential clash with society’s judgment.the unknown girl who follows Sunshine feels like a younger version of herself. she is the part of Sunshine that believes abortion is wrong, the part that cannot yet grasp the weight of a life lived on someone else’s terms. and yet, by the end, she mutters, “gets ko na.” she sees that Sunshine’s life is not a simple question of right and wrong. she feels the burden Sunshine carries, the life she cannot give without losing herself. she recognizes how much was left for Sunshine to live, how much potential to burn bright, and how pregnancy would have dimmed it. she senses the life that should have belonged to Sunshine alone.the realization does not absolve, it recognizes the choices forced upon someone who should have been free to live her life on her own terms. that recognition shatters you more than any argument, any moral lesson ever could.watching this film, you feel everything at once. the warmth of the colors, the softness of the scenes, the love in small gestures, and then the ache, the rage, the grief that lingers because the world can be cruel, unfair, unfeeling. Sunshine is about life that is too heavy for the judgment of others. it is about the potential snuffed out when morality is chosen over empathy. it is about understanding, even when the world cannot. it is gentle, devastating, and necessary. it will stay with you long after the credits roll.Sunshine is soft to watch, hard to forget, and brutally honest about the ways society fails those who need understanding the most.it will make you feel what it is to live, to choose, to survive, and to understand when understanding is all that remains.",12

Sunshine,"I wrote this review while waiting for my Mie Ayam to be ready, I don't know why the Mie Ayam stall is so cozy to contemplate:)In my opinion, Sunshine here is an evil character, she chose not to give birth to her child who she has seen for herself how excited and smart her child is.Sunshine is a portrayal of an evil pubescent girl, who is not responsible for her own lust. Indirectly, the filmmaker supports having an abortion for the sake of her dreams and future life.Imagine what if mom chooses not to give birth to me in order to achieve her dreams of her youth. of course I won't mind, I will gladly support mom to get the life she longs forRemembered the conversation that night, about mom's childhood dreams. we all felt guilty hearing her dreams, but mom didn't blame it, she was ready to be a mother, she said her future was her child. ""what is the future? All I know is that my future is to be your mother""",20
Sunshine,"as a woman, this film truly made me feel seen; gets niya ako, at gets ko rin si sunshine.beyond its excellent cinematography and moving score, sunshine strikingly captures women’s painful yet persistent struggle to gain agency over their own bodies, especially within the context of a predominantly catholic country—kaya mas dama mo rin yung sakit ng katotohanan niya. hands down to direk tonet for yet another meaningful film that centers women, and to maris for a performance that expresses what even a thousand words could not convey.",-1

Sunshine,"“kasalanan sa mata ng diyos”is abortion a sin? people will answer this differently because morality in the philippines is rarely personal. it is inherited by religion, tradition, and the weight of everyone watching. for many, the word “abortion” automatically activates the label of sin, as if life were a simple moral equation and suffering didn’t count as part of the formula. for others, it is a decision carved out of fear, pressure, and survival, made in the middle of circumstances that no outsider fully understands. kung ginahasa ka, kasalanan pa rin ba ang pagpapalaglag sa bata? if your answer is yes, then your moral compass is calibrated more by dogma than empathy, and your worldview is as rigid as the doctrine you inherited without questioning.conservatism in the philippines is not subtle. it is soaked into daily life, in families, in pulpits, reinforced by laws that pretend neutrality but are shaped by centuries of religious influence. sa bansa natin, halos lahat ng desisyon ng babae ay may kasamang mata ng lipunan na handang humusga, tama? abortion becomes more than a medical choice; it becomes a cultural crime, a symbol that people weaponize even when they know nothing about the life behind the decision. the environment itself—manila’s density, poverty, inequality, survivalism—creates conditions where choices are never purely “moral.” what do you expect from a city where half the population is just trying to get through the day?when you strip away the labels, the question of sin becomes less religious and more philosophical. sin implies intent, malice, or moral wrongdoing. abortion, for many, is none of these. if you’d ask me i’d say that, it is not an act of cruelty. it is a response to reality, a calculated survival decision shaped by pressure that most people never experience. kung hindi mo kailanman naramdaman ang desperasyon ng isang taong walang mapuntahan, anong karapatan mong magsabing mali ang pinili niya? reducing abortion to “sin” ignores everything: economic instability, trauma, lack of support systems, inaccessible healthcare, fear of judgment, and the sheer brutality of living in a country that demands endurance but offers nothing in return.the real discussion is not about moral purity but about environment. what context shaped the choice? what access to resources existed? what physical, emotional, and social risks will the woman face? people prefer judgment over understanding because judgment feels easier. introspection requires effort, and compassion requires complexity—two things society often avoids.if morality is measured by harm done, abortion may not be a sin at all. it may be a reflection of a society that fails its people so deeply that they must make decisions the world refuses to understand. sa totoo lang, mas madali para sa lipunan na manisi kaysa kumilala ng sistematikong pagkukulang. we condemn individuals because it distracts us from confronting the bigger failure—the environment that gave them no safe path.the real sin might not be in the act of abortion but in the society that makes someone carry the weight alone. a society that romanticizes suffering, worships conformity, and punishes anyone who chooses survival over tradition. a society that has the audacity to moralize while refusing to provide support, empathy, or alternatives.",11

Sunshine,"""Do you understand me?""""I get it""Jadaone's Sunshine portrays the raw, harrowing, and excruciating journey of a young gymnast who found out that she is pregnant, just months before Olympics qualifiers. The emotional turmoil that sends her into a downward spiral ghastly encapsulates the prevalent issue of teenage and accidental pregnancies in the Philippines and how public's notions that are grounded from bigotry, conservatism, and outdated values can negatively imbue the minds of these helpless women.The fragments of Sunshine's psyche of children also deepened the already thematically layered piece where it now provides the protagonist a whole new outlook whether she should carry on with the pregnancy or terminate it. What I really love about it is the film stays grounded to its footing and steadily focuses on putting the audience in Sunshine's lens. The last act with the kid is a top-notch and probably the most heartwarming scene in the whole film.Maris Racal's impeccable performance also puts the cherry on top where the in-depth introspect of a young woman that is going down the rabbit hole won't be solidified without her. Overall, Sunshine may just bring a new sunshine in the modern era of Philippine cinema.",17
Sunshine,"pro abortion siya ha but I like how they show some scenes that really happening in days world, true to life kumbaga. Grabe yung mga mura eh ang satisfying pakingan HAHA. But kidding aside, I really appreciate yung acting ni Maris ne napaka talaga tapos sa ibang scenes kuha yung inis lalo na sa uncle scene kung ako yun bato na malaki pinukpok ko doon. And for me she has the right to do what she wants and we can't judge her for what she did. HER BODY, HER CHOICE",-1

Sunshine,Ariana. She’s my bitch.,-1
Sunshine,"Creating this movie in a country where abortion is seen as a taboo, is a great move from Antoinette Jadaone to educate the people about the autonomy of women to decide for their own body. By demonizing abortion, women are deprived of having an option and can led to dangerous procedures like what we've seen on the movie. After watching, I can say that it's very emotional and upsetting at the same time because of how it reflects the situation of Philippine society towards women's rights.",-1

(same w the other movies na sinabi ko) nagiging sobrang taas kasi nung expectations koang ganda ng simula. ang galing ni maris. fave ko yung may “gift of god” sa jeep tapos sa tabi ng simbahan ung nagtitinda ng pampareglanapakaunnatural lang nung mga pumipilit sa kanyang ikeep yung bata (doctor, pastor, etc). gets, pero hindi ko siya nadibdib kase halata mong acting? parang “ah eto yung part na pipilitin niyan siyang ikeep yung bata”. totoo namang nangyayari yon, pero feel ko dapat mas nabigyang pansin sana yung mga more subtle things that actually aren’t so subtle (yung pagbreak ng fship nila ni thea, mga relatives mong pakielamera) ewan ko wala rin akong mabigay na example it just didnt feel real in the moviegets dun sa hinahallucinate niyang batasobrang gets dun sa pagbasag ng red horse sa titopero ayon. overall i think may better execution pa dito. baka rin masyado lang akong liberal pero mas gugustuhin kong may pinupush siyang agenda. yes napakita niya yung struggles ng mga babae pero hindi niya //pinaramdam//. ayun. nakita ko lang, hindi ko naramdaman (pero baka manhid lng ako!)tbf more on na-ragebait lng ako doon sa mga pinipilit syang ikeep ung bata. pero more of eyeroll lng ganon. gusto ko ung kumukulo na dugo ko (tulad nung sa tito Talaga Naman)",-1

Sunshine,"This movie really captured the whole idea of “what if my parents chased their dreams instead of having me?” The film shows how teenage pregnancy and child sexual abuse really happen not just because of irresponsible boyfriends who don’t use protection, but also because it can come from anyone and i mean ANYONE. your own dad, uncle, cousin, friend, or partner.Its eye-opening how teen pregnancy has become so normalized in the phillipines of ages 13 to 18. And to my mom who had dreams too, until she found out she was pregnant with me, she was torn a real 50/50 on whether to keep me or not. She chose to keep me and eventually married my dad.Sometimes I can’t help wondering what her life could’ve been if she pursued her own dreams. Honestly, I’d want her to be happy, even if that meant I wouldn’t exist. The movie’s meaning and message really hit me deeply.",5

Sobrang pulido. Sobrang raw. Sobrang “ay oo, ganito talaga buhay ng babae—lalo na kung babae ka sa Pinas.”Sa wakas, may pelikulang hindi takot maging totoo. At bilang bansa na predominantly Catholic (sigh), alam mo na agad na taboo ’to. Ang hirap maging pro-choice sa isang lugar na agad kang hinuhusgahan bago ka pa marinig.Kaya huge deal talaga na may pelikulang gaya nito na nag-oopen ng usapan. At pinaka-tumatatak sa akin ’yung paalala na ang babae… tao. Hindi lang “may dinadala.” Hindi lang vessel. Tao.Na may nararamdaman, may konsensya.Na may sariling isip at puso.Na may takot at pangarap.At hindi biro ’yung bigat ng bawat desisyong kailangan niyang pasanin mag-isa.Tapos Manila as the backdrop??? YES.Hindi siya ginawang poster aesthetic! Totoong Maynila talaga: mainit, masikip, magulo, pero buhay. Like literal na buhay. Mga mukha ng taong araw-araw lumalaban sa sistema na hindi naman talaga pumapanig sa kanila.And the film doesn’t say “Maawa ka.” Hindi.Ang sinasabi niya is: “Makinig ka naman kahit minsan.”Kaya oo.Isang malaking oo.Gets ko na, Sunshine.(At medyo hindi ko kinaya emotionally kasi DAMI KO PANG NASASABI pero grabe, kudos talaga!)",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is a feat for Philippine cinema. It tackles a topic most are scared to produce and it was written WELL. Yes, without the poverty porn or political porn most films of ours subtexts. There are characters that are REAL. Not written to tell unjustly-unrelated issues but to support the story itself. And so, characters that are in poverty aren’t written to convey another message, rather to stand with what the film is about in the first place. This film is easily the one of the best written films of all time in our history. Not only does it tell a beautiful picture of a character undergoing such a life-turning “accident” but how it tells it psychologically, and powerfully. It never let go of what it portrays nor does it settle for a scene that would bring in viewers, it’s written SO realistically that you’d forget it’s a movie. A quick one to point out is Sunshine texting her bestfriend, at the time she needs support the most, even if she’s disappointed for losing contact with her, she still texts out of fear, and that’s something i’m sure plenty of people have done. Those text messages are so real, raw and incredibly well-written too. The whole story is an absolute masterclass of writing a film straightforwardly without losing the essence of what it is. It’s a display of perfect world-building, from the story of her boyfriend, the realistic response from him to the story of the tindera, who without building a relationship, completely makes sense of the film. Even built a subtext of a no nonsense coach that adds to fear, support, motive and regret of the main character.I can tell you all about the beautiful writing but this would be too long. Let’s get to the cinematography. Well, it’s good. Definitely better than most films, it’s quite obvious that certain camera works and shots aren’t just to finish the scene but is chosen to look good while portraying a scene nicely. There’s a lot of cues that whispers visually, like how she prays with bars infront of her, evoking the feeling of our character not FEELING or BEING welcome inside the church. Shot-selections like those sre essential and quite reliable to make a scene impactful so i’m incredibly proud they excerted better effort to make this film the best it could possibly be. Wouldn’t say it’s a strong suit, but this fil is definitely visually well-made.I’ve always seen Maris Racal as a great actress before this, now she’s PHENOMENAL one and is one of the best in the industry right now. The talent to portray talent and skill alone, is something most actors/actresses not only have the chance to audition for BUT absolutely nails from the first to the last second of the film. There’s a Piolo Pascual jumpscare here, Elijah Canlas KILLS it AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.Sunshine is great, it’s amazingly told through emotions and a bit of a psychologically present engagement to allow interpretations of viewers be as wide as it can.",12
Sunshine,realistic,1
Sunshine,"im very happy abt this movie's existence, though honestly the emotional beats feel lacking. i feel like the movie's story could have been written better, bcs in my perspective it felt a bit boring and predictable. being just predictable would have been fine, some movies can be rly good even tho you know what happens, but i j couldn't rly get with it because i was bored.. and some scenes felt very, well, how do i describe it? like so…",23

Pero nandito ako ngayon to separate the work from the artist.Sa totoo lang, everything in this movie reflects everything about this country—poor facilities in public hospitals, exploitation of children, rape, konserbatibong pag-iisip ng karamihan, teenage pregnancy, at kung paano tumakbo sa responsibilidad ang ilang kalalakihan. Ayoko na itong pahabain pa. Pero lagi nating tatandaan to always wear condoms and practice safe sex. Also, legalize abortion!",6

Might be one of the most realistic and relatable film ever. This deserves such a breakthrough knowing how close minded most toxic filipinos are towards this topic. Frustrates me how much our country needs to view and take this film more seriously considering how heavy the message weighs in this messed up system we're living in.

Sunshine,"This movie should be an eye-opener for the citizens of this country.Abortion is illegal, yes, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.There are many reasons why women get pregnant, and one of these is rape. It should be part of women’s rights that their safety is guaranteed no matter the situation. Because abortion is not accessible in this country, women tend to rely on unsafe methods that could harm their bodies or, worse, could kill them. Other people shouldn’t have an opinion on what women choose to do with their bodies. Legalizing abortion doesn’t mean encouraging all pregnant women to get one—it means giving women safe options if they don’t want to keep that little chunk of blood cells in their body, instead of forcing them into unsafe methods that could be fatal.I will always stand by the fact that abortion should be legal.",5

Pero they ignore what's happening around the world. They ignore that there's a genocide happening in Sudan and in Gaza. Wala silang pake. Tapos when it comes to women's reproductive health, hala gustong mangialam. Bida bida ka teh? Stupid laws! Yes im pertaining to divorce and abortion.You care so much about life pero wala kang pake even if it endangers the life of the mother. You care so much about the sanctity of marriage yet you turn a blind eye when there are millions of women being abused.Ang kapal mo naman.Catholic daw kasi.Duh, Catholic country din ang Spain pero they separated criminal law. Tapos yung ayaw pang mag pasa ng abortion bill is yung may mga case pa against humanity, haha kalokohan.Those law dont protect anyone.Anti-abortion law cannot make the woman love the child lalo na if that child is the everyday reminder of what hell she went through. Kawawa parehas diba? The kid's unloved, tapos reminder pa ng pang aabuso sa nanay niya. Anti-divorce law can't make a broken family happy again. It not just damage the parents, but also the kids. ""Kids might suffer from broken families"" daw kasiAh, so, ipipilit mo? So mas okay na nakikita ng mga anak nila na nagsisigawan sila, na nag sasakitan at ginagawang punching bag yung nanay nila kaysa maghiwalay?!Keeping these bans doesn’t uphold morality, it endangers women, silences survivors, and empowers abusers.You're not protecting anyone but the perpetrators.And I hope this film serves as a message.",11

Sunshine,"finally watched this film that this conservative country can't take. pinakita kung gaano ka-fucked up sa pilipinas; magmula sa kalsada hanggang sa mga public health care. abortion shouldn't be a debate; it is a choice that a woman should be able to make. hanggang ngayon, sensitibo pa rin ang mga pilipino sa salitang aborsyon lalong lalo na sa mga relihiyon. this film can help widen knowledge about how dangerous abortion is if there is no support from public or private healthcare. ang dami ko pang gusto sabihin, pero panoorin n‘yo na lang. gets na gets kita, sunshine.",5
Sunshine,"some thoughts the film could have worked better without the personified unborn kids. gets naman na it needed to materialize the internal conflict/turmoil of sunshine but the imaginary kids seemed lazy writing to me. plus, it complicates the politics of the film—is it really a child if it’s just a clump of cells? in the film, yes and it even shows the mother and the unborn child hugging, as if arriving to an understanding… “gets ko na!” uhmm okay.jennica garcia though… i need her in a dramatic lead role ",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine is one of those rare Filipino films that refuses to look away. Instead of sugarcoating or romanticizing the world its characters inhabit, it confronts the audience with the uncomfortable truths we collectively sidestep—the toxic mindsets we inherit, the social issues we normalize, and the moral rigidity we mistake for virtue.What makes the film remarkable is its honesty. It acknowledges how deeply ingrained complacency is in our culture, how we often witness injustice, misogyny, or dysfunction and simply shrug, labeling it as “ganun talaga.” Sunshine exposes that mentality for what it is: a quiet violence that enables suffering. The film does not preach; it simply presents the weight of these realities with clarity and emotional intelligence, letting the audience feel the consequences of silence and inaction.Its commentary on anti-abortion attitudes is especially bold for Philippine cinema. Rather than reducing the debate to dogma or melodrama, the film shows how anti-abortion rhetoric becomes a peril for women; not just physically, but emotionally, socially, and economically. It reveals how denying reproductive autonomy restricts their futures, limits their ambitions, and punishes them for choices men are rarely held accountable for. Sunshine portrays this with nuance: the internal conflict, the fear of judgment, the systemic lack of support, and the complete absence of safe options. The film understands that this isn’t just a “moral issue”—it’s a structural one, tied to poverty, misogyny, and societal expectations about what women owe to the world.Ultimately, Sunshine is more than a movie; it’s a critique of the culture that raised us. It forces us to ask why we maintain harmful traditions, why morality is weaponized against women, and why we accept inequality as a norm. Its power lies in its refusal to let the audience remain comfortable, and in reminding us that the first step toward progress is learning to confront what we’ve been taught to ignore.",12
Sunshine,nearly cried but remembered my rage for men,15
Sunshine,"Films like this make me realize how great the potential of the PH film industry is when it comes to storytelling, creativity, and taking risks. Sunshine proves exactly that. Ang tapang ng pelikulang ‘to, not just in the execution, but sa choice of subject matter. Makamasa, madaling kapitan, and at the same time, a real eye-opener. From start to finish, ramdam mo yung puso at bigat ng kuwento, and yet ang linis ng pagkakadala.Maris Racal shines in a way that’s both raw and controlled; she gives a performance that stays with you long after the credits roll. Jennica Garcia is equally powerful, grabe yung presence niya, every scene hits (we all need a family member like her!!). Together, they carry the emotional core of the film so well na hindi mo mapigilang maapektuhan like ALL I CAN SAY IS I REALLY LOVE WOMEN SM.But above all, very important yung conversation na binubuksan ng Sunshine. Abortion is a difficult, nuanced topic—one that should be openly discussed not just within families, but within our society and government. And I firmly believe na choosing yourself first, your success, your safety, your future matters just as much. AND, women should be able to decide for themselves: their body, their rules. This isn't a simple issue, and the film treats it with the depth and humanity it deserves.Sunshine is indeed a courageous and a necessary film that everyone should watch!!",-1

Sunshine,"cinema in its rawest form. Sobrang direct to the point and realistic, ‘di ko alam kung bakit hindi pa rin maintindihan ng mga boomer sa fb na oa maka-movie review. ABORTION IS SELF AND HEALTH CARE. Wala ‘yan sa susustentuhan naman, pananagutan naman, etc. Women have every right to decide what to do in this kind of situation. An opinion from a man is not needed — NEVER. A woman gets to decide what they want to do with their body. Sobrang raw ng emotions, kaya pala nasabihan si Maris na haggard/hindi fresh during shoot kasi ‘yan pino-portray niya. Isang 19 year old na gymnast na pangarap maging olympian — nabuntis at walang malapitan, walang mahingan ng tulong kundi tiktok, reddit, at twitter. Kuhang kuha yung situation sa Quiapo, yung mga nagtitinda ng mga pamparegla sa tapat ng simbahan, mga nagdadasal sa simbahan, etc. Abortion should be legal, really. Kaysa kung ano anong solusyon gawin ng mga kababaihan para lang makapag-abort, why not gawin na lang in a safe and legal way? Masyadong relihiyoso mga tao, ‘di mo na alam kung ano pinaglalaban e. Kanino lalapit ang kababaihan kundi sa mga 2.5-3.5k na pampalaglag na gamot na nabibili sa Quiapo at online? Haist, I love you, Sunshine. Naiintindihan talaga namin!!!",-1

Sunshine,"More didactic than her previous films, but this is still a great “social issues” drama (albeit one with some magical realist touches), with a moving central performance. In terms of “abortion movies,” it really does a great job of making its case. For a teenage gymnast, carrying a baby to term really does completely remove that path as a possibility for her life—that dream just gets immediately destroyed, in a way that (obviously) won’t happen for the baby’s father, and it’s why it’s so essential to this film’s success that Jadaone so skillfully captures the tactile and practical *reality* of Sunshine’s body in the gymnastic scenes: that body, with its graceful and athletic movements, that she has spent her entire life molding for this sole purpose of Olympic gold, and it will go away, permanently, if she doesn’t have an abortion. I also think Jadaone does a good job of avoiding deck-stacking. Yes, the pro-life nurse who castigates Sunshine is portrayed as a witch, but the saleswoman who gives her the abortifacients is also shown to be a greedy haggler herself. And while the two male figures pressuring her to have the baby (her boyfriend and her boyfriend’s father) both make specious and insincere cases, it is again to Jadaone’s credit that she cast two dynamic male performers for these roles (Elijah Canlas and Pio Pascual—whom I didn’t recognize in a straight-up “Dad” role, after decades playing the heart-throb!)…this is one of those reviews where in the process of writing it I’ve realized I liked the movie a lot more than I thought I did while the credits were rolling. Jadaone, she’ll do that to you!",5
Sunshine,"tangina ni miggy at nung tito, kalalaking tao humihinga??but seriously tho why should abortion be such a dangerous and life-threatening experience in this country, when it should be safe, accessible, and rooted in compassion for all women? (women empowerment where??) not legalizing abortion does not stop abortion, it only stops safe abortions. not to mention that it’s also very anti-poor lol. it’s heartbreaking that women are not given the choice or freedom to choose and that something that is meant to protect their health becomes a source of shame and risk simply because the system refuses to provide proper options, and society forces them into thinking na “pregnancies are blessings” when that is not the case for everyone.and to anyone that have the mindset na “what if ‘yan ang next president ng pilipinas” dude fuck you and your guilt tripping ass. you’re the reason bakit hindi umuunlad pilipinas.",4

Sunshine,the punching the stomach parts :(,1
Sunshine,"One of the biggest factors holding back the Philippines from being as progressive as our neighboring countries like China and Japan is our deep entanglement with religion—Christianity, in particular. As much as faith shapes our culture, it also becomes a hindrance to national progress when religious beliefs are imposed on matters that should prioritize the welfare and rights of all citizens. Imagine how much better our society could be if we allowed personal freedoms and evidence-based policies to guide our decisions, instead of insisting on religious doctrine as the standard for everyone.The movie portrayed this reality so powerfully. It addressed so many issues in one narrative—how women are often the ones who suffer the most under a misogynistic system, how men can easily walk away from responsibilities while women cannot, and how horrifying it is that young girls, even minors, can be raped and then forced to bear a child. These are the consequences of a society that refuses to give women full autonomy over their own bodies.I truly hope more people come to realize the importance of allowing women to make decisions for themselves by legalizing abortion. Every woman deserves the right to choose what happens to her own body.Despite the heaviness of the story, I’m glad that Sunshine still managed to pursue the dream she longed for, proving that resilience can still bloom even in the harshest circumstances.",11

Sunshine,"I may be on the unpopular side of this: I want to love this so badly but for some reason, I can't help to mull-on & pinpoint some details lacked for me and thought it needed more revising story-wise. I am not hating on this. In fact, I actually like several parts of the movie. I think it's fair to say (and undeniably so) that this is an important and a refreshing story on what's the take of abortion & body autonomy here in the Philippines and I do appreciate this movie for that. (I added the half star plus because it still is an important movie)I want to love this movie (but only like it) because I thought it obviously have such a great potential to be ""a great movie"" on most aspects. What holds me back is the writing, story-wise.It started really strong and direct to the point which I really liked. By the next part, we'd see a little girl who follows Sunshine. At first it seems to me that it could be her inner child or her unborn future child so it confused me a bit (most especially on the part where Sunshine was rushed to the hospital, we'd see a blood on her crotch area as well). This device they used provided a bit of comic relief in the movie which I thought is cute and actually can be an effective way to delve deeper sentimentally because its so personal. However, I came to learn (through online reading) that she is indeed her unborn future child (bc of Ariana disappearing). To be honest, I couldn't finalize my thoughts on this whether I like it or not because with that in mind, the mix message does confuse some a bit on whether or not it's a ""pro-life"" but I guess that could also be the point that it is complicated. Afterall, Sunshine did kept coming back to the church scenes and this can represent a lot of women who faces/d the same situation. I just thought the movie might have to clarify in telling that message.I also much prefer her being Sunshine's inner child (which could be a ""tangible"" reminder on what the whole movie is all about, Sunshine taking control of her own life and the dream of being a national athlete ever since she's a child). But the line ""Gets ko na"" have such a great impact on people because of its ""casualness"" but its the words that has a really heavy weight on it that I thought is effective to pull people's heartstrings in. Another aspect of the movie that kinda lacked for me which is, I think a big part of it: I want to see how much Sunshine wants it by seeing her own training to be a gymnast. What does she do every day as a training athlete? How does she balance everything in her life-- being a sister/aunt/student/friend/a woman in general while also being a training athlete? What do you to do train as a gymnast? How heavy does it weigh on her that she's truly doing every thing she can to be in olympics and be a great gymnast, what does it look like? I wished she saw that a bit (even just in a montage) before or during the moment she found out she got pregnant. I want to see her really work hard and see how much blood, sweat, and tears and really feel and see that ""goddamn it i want this so bad"" and not just tell it. I guess what I want to say is that I want more training scenes too because I am also interested in watching gymnasts do their thing haha.I also thought that by the 3/4 part of the movie where we do meet Ariana is kinda took a different turn for the movie. I am not sure if it is necessary that we meet another kid (Ariana, not Mary Grace) and that maybe without that, they could still end up getting the same storyline/result (though don't get me wrong, I did like Ariana, i think she's fab). It also didn't do much impact on Sunshine's decision but rather it does prove how fucked up it is that this happen in reality and how shitty it is again that we don't have much (legal and safe, known) access to women's sexual and reproductive health services, let alone being a woman/person who's forced into something they aren't ready to be/never wanted be in the first place.More so, the visuals and cinematography, can't deny that it is beautiful, that's a given. Acting is amazing, no notes no doubt.A little predictable on emphasizing on the Manila landscape and scenery although it is still beautiful to look at (especially considering to people haven't been to Manila/Philippines, at least they'd get the gist of it even though its not all picturesque all the time). I especially appreciate the movie getting in deep and showing the grim & messy ways of taking different methods of abortion. I thought its very important to see how harrowing and fucking hard/harsh/unfair/dangerous it is that women have to/had no choice to do experiences like these. I only wished that they showed the method of when Sunshine made an appointment for that Doctor Helena because maybe it could also show that abortion could also have safe and harmless way that would make people feel less wary and scared of it and maybe even talk about it.With all that, in conclusion I think I do like this movie. It is an important movie to exists especially at our modern times, it's long overdue that we finally talk about this here in our country. I hope we keep talking about it because it is necessary for us we want to keep fighting for women's rights. I don't love it but I do like it and I appreciate it for what it did.",13
Sunshine,Loved how the filmmaker showcased different situations that emphasize the importance of the *legalization of abortion and also showing the weaponization of religion against it that just guilt trip women into submitting themselves to motherhood ! So brave and hopefully opened the mind of some Filipinos,13

Sunshine,"i liked the narrative and character of Sunshine. a well-performing gymnast who carried it all alone, refusing to give up her passion over being a childbearer. but there's something more to see, something to observe about — the country's system is rotten. beggars crossing your struggles only to be fed. the extreme language of Filipino people to express rage. busy and wasted streets to feel unsafe yet realistically implied. hospitals rejecting patients instead of living out the work ethic of saving lives. being a bad influence for expressing what you really feel. religion as a coping mechanism. plans of abortion kept clandestinely to hide against the law. and the most of it all, choosing to smile as a way to focus on doing what you love. additionally, showcasing Sunshine's child manifestation was wild. it was her conscience at the same time — guilt tripping the heck out of her.curses to the legal system. curses to insensitive and lustful men.curses to irresponsible parents.ang gwapo ni Piolo Pascual.",12
Sunshine,This is why we need to legalize abortion in the Philippines,11
Sunshine,i love the symbolism but the ending couldve been more dramatic,39
Sunshine,"this is what the filipino people need to see more often. it might be obscure for some, but it is timely and important. teenage mothers are often judged for carrying a child; whether they keep it or not, judgement will still eye on them. the guilt of their conscience will still haunt and hunt them. but we never get to see their point of view, we only see them for the mistakes they have done. where is that energy when it comes to boys who choose to abandon the outcome of their bad decisions? nowhere. i love how this film doesn’t just show us the story of a teenage girl who got pregnant while chasing her dreams—it is a story of all the girls and women who are forced to carry a baggage they never asked for. we saw their hardships and struggles. it also shows us how flawed our system is and how hypocritical some religious people are. this should be a wake up call. the little girl (annika) doesn’t just represent sunshine’s unborn child—she also represents us. we only see abortion and choosing oneself as something wrong and sinful because we are too blinded by what was merely taught to us. we never get to see or feel what others feel. and once we do, we will understand them. that is when we will realize. let’s be more like the little girl, let’s try to understand more.i also love that they chose manila as the setting of this film. it might not be important but i think it is. manila is messy, scary, and it will kill you. but once you overcome it, you’ll see its beauty.lastly, sorry pero super bothered talaga ko sa part na nasa lope de vega na sila tapos ang layo pa ng hospital na pinuntahan nila e mas malapit naman ang metro, san lazaro, or jose reyes.  bothered lang ako pero gets ko naman kung bakit, so wala na lang yon, di siya mahalaga. hahaha",-1
Sunshine,"Source: www.reeladvice.net/2025/12/sunshine-2024-movie-review.htmlAntoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine has been one of our most anticipated local releases of the year and it does not disappoint. Emotionally charged and socially resonant, the film tackles teen pregnancy and the realities of limited reproductive rights in the Philippines with honesty and empathy. While it may not offer clear-cut moral answers, Sunshine succeeds in revealing the real and painful stakes of becoming a young mother tackling equally both sides of the moral coin.National gymnast Sunshine (Maris Racal) has always dreamed of competing in the Olympics. With qualifiers fast approaching, she pushes her body to its limits until she suddenly faints during training. What she assumes is exhaustion from her intense regimen and strict diet turns out to be something far more life-altering: she is pregnant. At only 19 and with her lifelong dream on the line, Sunshine faces a bitter decision: keep the child and lose her final chance at the Olympics, or pursue an illegal abortion and grapple with the moral and emotional fallout.As expected, Sunshine doesn’t shy away from tough conversations. Its central dilemma is painfully relatable, regardless of where you stand on the right to choose in a predominantly Catholic country. Maris Racal is a revelation, delivering a nuanced and deeply human performance as a young athlete forced to confront consequences that will shape the rest of her life. And while we won’t spoil where the story ultimately lands, the film takes a definitive stance without betraying the complexity of its subject matter. It was a balancing act handled with notable care.What elevates Sunshine further is how vividly it captures the societal pressures and chaotic realities of Philippine society when it comes to the right to choose. The judgment, the ironies, the lack of support systems, everything feels painfully authentic and grounded. Where the film stumbles slightly is in its more fantastical elements. Though the intent behind these sequences is clear, they often feel out of place and not fully integrated into the narrative, appearing more convenient than cohesive. Still, Sunshine is a compelling and important watch and not only for Maris Racal’s standout performance but for its bold and compassionate exploration of an issue that remains deeply relevant in modern Philippine society. It’s a film that provokes and ultimately shines.",12
Sunshine,"naiintindihan na ba ko?loved the movie it tackled and open up so many topics, and it was very common problem in our country but we don't really talk about.",-1
Sunshine,"and you know what? fuck them kids and fuck you tooooDe joke lang hehe, releasing this film in this political climate is insane, Antoinette Jadaone deserves her flowers for this film. Maris Racal also did a phenomenal job in portraying the titular character and so did the other actors. The story, though it can be a little ""in your face"" at times really drives the message home. I hope one day other people can get it too. Support women who follow their dreams!",25

Kapag naman gusto mong kumawala sa idinidikta sayo ng relihiyon at ng konserbatibo nating lipunan, parang hindi tama na hindi ka kainin ng konsensya mo; dapat pa yatang lumuhod ka sa harapan nila kahit para sa ikabubuti mo naman ang magiging desisyon mo—parang mali pa sa mata nila na unahin mo ang sarili mo. Kailanman ay hindi magiging pro-women ang kahit anumang sistema dito sa Pilipinas kung patuloy na babahiran ng relihiyon ang mga batas na ipinapatupad. Dahil dito, imbes na bumuo tayo ng isang lipunan kung saan walang babae ang kinakailangang dumaan sa butas ng karayom para magkaroon ng access sa isang serbisyo na DAPAT ay parte ng healthcare system natin, we continue to condition women into shaming themselves.

Pinapakita nung una na Pagbuo sa bata vs Pangarap niya, hindi gaano najustify yung pangarap niya at ano siya bilang sasali sa Olympics. Ang nakita ko lang don simpleng training na para bang hindi big event yung sasalihan niya. Isang beses ko lang din nakita na may nagpapicture sa kanya. Hindi nagmemake sense sa part na yun. Sana may mas nafeel tayong pressure sa surroundings niya para rin makita natin gaano ito kahalaga para sa kanya. 'Di lang yon, kilala rin tayong bilang mga pilipino na grabe kung sumuporta sa nagrerepresent ng bansa natin. Parang si Manny Pacquiao lang yan or candidate na sasali sa Miss Universe. Kulang sa pressure o justification. Sayang, but honestly, sanay naman na ako sa bansa nating hindi gaano nagiinvest ng budget para sa film.Legit, okay 'to siya. Nakakatuwa na open na tayo gumawa ng ganitong klaseng palabas mula sa bansang punong puno ng katoxican at mga relihiyoso. Galing ni Maris! Thank you Direk Tonet. Abante Babae!",3
Sunshine,felt this film deeply in my soul bc: count 1: im a woman in a predominantly conservative country count 2: ive had a pregnancy scare count 3: same financial situation as sunshine count 4: film set in the areas i frequent,5
Sunshine,"this feels very similar to brocka in that it portrays manila as a city full of hardship and loneliness that can leave you so disillusioned and alienated; and where hope and humanity exist on the fringes of it. it's a working-class story with working-class sentiments that fully takes on its own identity because jadaone is able to portray such familar elements in a way that feel completely isolating; the interiors of jeepneys, tricycles, shabby motels, clinics — everything feels so alien. which, i guess, offers many people unfamiliar with what these woman go through a much-needed perspective on the importance of dignity and bodily autonomy and how violent, horrible men try to take that away from many women.i think it's also worth noting that religion and patriarchy play such a prominent role here in oppression; jadaone laser-focused on placing religious beliefs and preconceived notions about abortion in the spotlight, all the more affected by teenage pregnancy and how religion has kind of shaped the way many filipinos treat abortion as something so taboo and inhuman that they completely forget how it affects the mother. and it's brought to life by a really incredible maris racal; shaped by all the adversity — the kind of performance that requires you to bare your soul to the audience, to beg them to see the humanity behind the people suffering from religious oppression, and why access to abortion services — even in a heavily catholic country — is of utmost importance.",-1
Sunshine,a film Filipinos may not be ready for…but need,9
Sunshine,"“Gets ko.”This is the first time na medyo mag-essay ako here because just… wow. Usually, when I watch films, madaldal ako with side comments here and there. Pero habang nanonood ako ng Sunshine, tahimik lang ako. Walang imik. Kasi it didn’t feel like I was watching a script come to life, it felt like I was actually watching Sunshine. Not Sunshine as the protagonist of a movie or a character that Maris plays, but Sunshine as a real person—her, as someone like me. A young girl struggling with the kind of belief system that we have in our country. Bilang babae, nakakatakot na malagay sa sitwasyon na mapapahamak lahat ng pinaghirapan mo, lahat ng pinagtrabahuhan mo buong buhay mo, lahat ng mga pangarap mo. Lahat tayo may karapatan mamili ng kapalaran natin. Kaya gets ko, Sunshine. Gets na gets ko. Hindi dapat tayo inihahalintulad sa demonyo o pinipilit na humingi ng kapatawaran sa kahit sino dahil lang gumawa tayo ng isang desisyon na para sa sarili natin. Hindi para sa pamilya o sa kaibigan, para sa atin.Would I say na the Philippines is ready for these kinds of films? I don’t know, pero parati akong naniniwala na hindi kailangang maging handa ang isang tao o bagay sa lahat ng oras. I think a more important question is: do we need these kinds of films? Then my answer would be yes. We do.",-1

Sunshine,"Gets ko na :(It’s not even debatable. ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE. Hindi ko maintindihan kung bakit may mga taong against sa abortion. If you’re against something, you don’t have to do it. Pero bakit kailangan mong ipagkaila yung isang bagay sa taong nangangailangan? Tangina 13 lang sya, nirape ng Tito nya. Imagine na may taong ganito yung sitwasyon. Kung maging legal man ang abortion sa Pinas, hindi ka required na gawin yon. At hindi ka maaapektuhan kung magdedesisyon ang isang tao na gawin yon.Fuck people with this kind of mindset.Imagine, nasa pedestrian lane ka, tapos tatanungin ka kung magpapakamatay ka? Tanga ka ba?Bibili ka lang ng pregnancy test, tapos ijjudge ka at sasabihing, “Mga kabataan ngayon hindi na marunong magpigil.” People just can’t shut their mouths.Fuck the government.Putangina nakakalungkot, everytime na may Pilipino na magkakasakit, una nilang iisipin ay wala silang pera, paano ang gagastusin, at kung anong ipangbabayad nila sa ospital, imbes na isipin ang kalusugan at mangyayari sa kanila. Nakakalungkot pero totoo, and I’ve been a witness of that, yung dalawahan sa higaan at yung konting check up na sobrang mahal, na dapat naman ay libre. Sobra na, bakit ganito? Mayaman ang Pilipinas, pero nasaan? Putangina ng gobyerno, paano nyo nagagawang magpakasasa sa pera habang nakikitang naghihirap ang mga mamamayan? Mas masahol pa kayo sa mga mamamatay tao. Pag may sakit, lilipad ng ibang bansa para magpagamot imbes na ayusin ang healthcare system sa Pinas. Tangina diba?Fuck men and their views to women.Haha tangina, bakit ba sila ganon? Bakit ang tingin nyo sa babae e parang laruan? Pwedeng basta iwanan, itapon, o palitan kapag nagamit na? Bakit tingin ng mga lalaki e sex lang ang pinakamagandang bagay sa relasyon na maiooffer ng isang babae? Putangina, tite lang ba nagpapatakbo sa isip nyo?Thank you sa scene na hinampas ni Sunshine yung bote ng beer yung lalaki, super deserve nya yon.Fuck society for thinking all we’re made for is to procreate and care for our husbands.There’s more to life than men. Literal. Ito yung gusto kong sabihin everytime na may family gathering tapos unang tatanungin sa’kin, “May boyfriend ka na?” Putangina. Nakakapagod. Ito lang ba yung concerning na bagay sa buhay ko? Lalaki? Haha. Pano kung tanungin nyo kamusta yung pag-aaral ko? Ano yung mga bagay na ginagawa ko lately? Ano yung mga lugar na napuntahan ko? Kamusta ako? Wala ba? Lalaki lang ba talaga? “Hindi ako nahihiya, ayoko maging nanay”This was the part where I literally cried, salamat, at least at some point narealize ko, may boses tayo, may karapatan tayong magdesisyon para sa sarili natin, may karapatan tayong piliin kung ano yung tama at mas makakapagpasaya satin.Gets ko na, salamat Sunshine.",4

Sunshine,drown the noise,-1
Sunshine,"Women in the Philippines continue to grapple with deeply rooted issues such as teenage pregnancy which is made even more complex by the country’s predominantly Catholic identity. The moral codes and expectations instilled in us from childhood often determine whether society views abortion as a sinful act or a necessary choice, and this cultural tension becomes the silent force shaping many young women’s lives.In the film, Maris Racal embodies this struggle with striking emotional clarity. She carries the weight of a decision that no young woman should have to make alone: the impossible choice between holding on to her dream of becoming an Olympian or confronting the life-altering reality of an unexpected pregnancy. Her performance is powerful not because it dramatizes the dilemma, but because it mirrors the experiences of countless Filipinas whose voices are often dismissed or shamed into silence.What elevates the film is how it frames her situation not as a moral failure, but as a human story: one shaped by fear, hope, societal pressure, and the search for agency. Through Racal’s nuanced portrayal, the narrative exposes the cultural contradictions we live with: a society that celebrates the achievements of young women yet imposes rigid expectations on their bodies and choices. The film invites the audience to move beyond judgment and recognize the quiet courage required to stand at the crossroads of identity, aspiration, and responsibility.In grounding a personal crisis within the broader context of Philippine social norms, the film becomes more than a character study; it becomes a commentary on how we, as a society, often fail to extend empathy to young women navigating impossible circumstances. And in that sense, Maris does not just act the role; she embodies a truth many are too uncomfortable to confront.",11

I loved how the film tackles social issues that are rampant in the Philippines—it’s heartbreaking, especially for those who have experienced these struggles firsthand. The storyline, cinematography, and characters were all exceptionally well done.",-1

Sunshine,watched this again with my friends to annoy them with some unsolicited random facts behind the film,8
Sunshine,"this movie is surprisingly good. i was impressed by how the story centers the lived experiences of marginalized women, showing not just the weight of their decisions, but the harsh realities, judgment, and lack of support they often face. it isn’t about glorifying or condemning anything, but about understanding why some women make the choices they do.this film doesn’t just tell a story, it challenges people to empathize beyond biases. and i think that's beautiful :)",36
Sunshine,GETSSSSSSSSSSS ,1
Sunshine,"Grabe… sobrang ganda !! :') ang daming na-touch na importanteng issues like the country’s poor healthcare system , societal pressure sa mga babae (na rarely nangyayari sa mga lalaki), and how self-righteous people keep this country backwards.. plus, yung dilemma pa between choosing yourself and your dream vs becoming a mother... I hope every woman is given the chance to choose their own life, motherhood or not…",-1

Sunshine,Ang ingay ingay!!!!!!,1
Sunshine,"I love this film. It captures so honestly how hard it is to get an abortion in an anti-abortion country — the judgment, the lack of empathy, and the reality of how poor our healthcare system is.Salute to the director for making a film like this. Maris Racal was incredible as Sunshine. And the way Annika and Ariana’s characters were written — symbolic and intentional — made everything hit even harder.",5
Sunshine,ts film showed how fucked up Philippines healthcare system!!! and the rights about women’s freedom and choices!!!,-1
Sunshine,"""drown out the noise"" but there shouldn't be noise in the first place. abortion is healthcare!!",4
Sunshine,"This made me cry 4 times in one night. I was a survivor of assault when I was a child — and it literally broke me when I found out that the girl Sunshine gave her abortion contraceptives was thirteen. THIRTEEN. And her looking around and watching all the cramped space inside the maternity ward, where mothers were helping eachother out because it's hard being a mother in the Philippines. Sunshine's dreams being crushed by just one accident. I've never cried so hard for a movie.",-1
Sunshine,Old folks will never understandadd: hayuf talaga mga lalake,0
Sunshine,"gets kita sunshine another masterpice from direk antoinette, i love this so much walang tapon!! the acting, cinematography, the bustling noise around manila, and the emotions. i enjoyed every scene, and this is such a profoundly brave film capturing how women endured sm when it comes to motherhood and abortion, in a country like ours where abortion is a shame and criminalized, and silence women in every decisions that they make with their own bodies especially in context of abortion, and using their religious beliefs against abortion. making abortions illegal does not get rid of abortion, it gets rid of safe abortions for women, abortion is healthcare. most of people think it’s okay to take away women’s basic human rights and you simply don’t have the right to make that decision for anyone else over their body.",5
Sunshine,"she indeed drowned out all the noise. hay, no one—not even God himself—can stop a woman from pursuing her dreams. so proud of you, sunshine!",-1
Sunshine,Annoying little girl,-1
Sunshine,grabe,1
Sunshine,"One word to describe the film: MatapangIt’s about time a film like this was released. Direk Tonet shows the real struggles that many women face today, especially here in the Philippines. The movie gives you an uncomfortable feeling—exactly what we should feel, because it reflects a truth we need to see and confront.The storytelling of Sunshine’s journey is smart and compelling; every scene gives you chills. And Maris Racal’s portrayal? Chef’s kiss.This is a must-watch film, one that everyone should see, especially Filipinos.I hope that one day, people will be brave and open enough to say, “Gets ko na.”",-1

Sunshine,ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE!!!,4
Sunshine,"grabe sobrang husay na pelikula i am speechless, the cinematography wow. every filipino SHOULD WATCH THIS FILM this is really an eye opener. grabe nakakaiyak how fucked up ang pilipinas. fuck mens too",9
Sunshine,It's good though bit of a hard watch due to what the main character has went through in the story. Nice cinematography din!,8
Sunshine,"The grittiness and colours of the streets of Manila were the most apt backdrop for the emotions and Filipino sensibilities brought about by ingrained patriarchal conservatism. I especially adore films that take me back to familiar spaces, and Sunshine did not only tell a brave story but was also a visually rich piece of work.That night scene with the running LRT reflected on the motel window was, to me, textbook cinematography at its finest.",-1
Sunshine,so good to get the conversation going!! gets ko na,33
Sunshine,"ABORTION IS KILLING!! THEN JERK OFF AND DON'T FUCK WOMEN!!What makes Sunshine haunt me is how real it feels — not just as a story of a gymnast’s dream, but as a raw, painful portrait of what it means to be young, afraid, and fighting when everything seems stacked against you. The moment the truth sinks in — that this girl, brimming with hope and ambition, is now carrying a life she never asked for — the world she built starts cracking. Maris Racal gives a performance that doesn’t feel like acting — even when she’s silent, you feel every tremor of fear, every doubt, every moment she prays for a different ending. The film doesn’t paint shades of grey — it throws you into a world where choices are dangerous, and every door seems closed.And the way the city closes in around her — tight alleys, cold clinics, judgmental stares, desperation disguised as quiet — Sunshine doesn’t just tell a story. It burrows underneath your skin and refuses to leave. This film isn’t easy or comfortable, but it’s needed — for the stories it refuses to sanitize, for the voices it pulls from the shadows, and for the courage it asks from us to look. If you think you know pain, you might not until you watch Sunshine.",-1
Sunshine,"this movie bravely tackles multiple issues within the current system we have in the philippines. it leaves me so speechless and moved that i don't have the right words to describe how heartbroken it made me feel but i hope this serves as a wake up call for our country. our declining healthcare system, traditional and religious beliefs, and government dictating what women should and shouldn't do with their bodies has been something we have needed to discuss long ago. mahirap maging babae, lalo na kapag lahat ay gumagawa ng desisyon para sa 'yo. dapat may karapatan tayo na pumili para sa sarili natin, at napapasaya ako na pinili ni sunshine ang kanyang sarili",26
Sunshine,"i may not be Sunshine, but i know other Sunshines in my life.hilak kaayo ko tungod sa movie. gasakit akong dughan sa tanan nga panghitabo ni Sunshine. naglagot ko, naluoy ko, naguol ko samtang nagtan-aw sa iyang giagian. gets kaayo nako nganong nabuhat to ni Sunshine, pero ngano man lisod para sa uban nga masabtan? naglaum ko nga unta, in the future, naa nay mas safe, mas humane, ug mas accessible nga mga options para nato mga kababaihan.para sa mga Sunshines sa akong kinabuhi, how i wish inyo kong gisultian. i would never judge. magsakit jud akong buot maghuna-huna unsa mo kahadlok atong panahona. i hope i was there to help you, to hold you, to give you the support you deserved.",3

Sunshine,"when I figured the movie is gonna be about teenage pregnancy, I was so ready on receiving another sex education, no shade to that, but so often that's all it brings. this is not just about that, it profoundly showing all that but also giving you the same level of importance side quests along with the emotional rollercoaster. When she's praying outside of church looking for a chance and forgiveness, that tremendous guilt transferred through the screen right into my heart. The society has no rights to impose further punishment to those who already sure they're living the condemn.",5
Sunshine,"in a place with a broken patriarchal system backed by viscous religious dogma, choices are often considered privileges for women, and Sunshine’s sudden life turmoil quickly turns every underprivileged woman’s worst nightmare into an awakening graphic discussion about self-autonomy.",7

Sunshine,The one annoying little girl gotta be real vibe like to investigate who behinds the real identity of Bay Harbor Butcher,1
Sunshine,It’s probably an important film for its target audience.,8
Sunshine,"stream-of-consciousness review (i’ll edit it later): her younger self got mad at her for losing her friend (which i presume was rhed’s baby) cause her younger self’s view on abortion was that it’s morally wrong. the scene where she made peace with her younger self felt like the magic piece that ties this excellent film together. i love how introspective and culturally true this film is. although scene-setting would have made it better like showing sunshine’s house from the outside, where she lives - more sceneries that show her life.the actress playing her sister gave the best performance in this film. the subtle moves, the eyes, the persona. the abortion topic, of course, is a daring one to talk about for a film by a filipino to be watched by filipinos. abortion is completely illegal and prohibited here, with penalties for those who perform or obtain one. the film successfully tackled a sensitive subject in good taste. i also saw the religious lady doctor character as a commentary on the non existent secularism in the country. that lady confronted with the sister was satisfying to watch.",5
Sunshine,One of the best sports-related/coming-of-age films I’ve seen. Maris performance deserves so much more recognition; she is a capital S Star. This has been on my watchlist since the TIFF premiere last year and so glad it’s finally out so the international community can watch this brilliant movie! (i have so many thoughts so this is a placeholder review),10
Sunshine,"as weird as it initially was to see this movie give a voice to the unborn kids, i think it was an appropriate depiction of the cultural mindset where conservatives already give unborn children voices to justify anti-abortion policies",5

Nakakalungkot lang kasi nung mga panahon na ‘yon ang tanging alam ko lang ay kasalanan ang gusto niya mangyare, pero habang tumatanda ako dun ko mas maiintindihan.",-1
Sunshine,this movie reminds me of black swan. i love it,8
Sunshine,"isang mahigpit na yakap, sunshine. ipinakita ng pelikulang ito kung bakit ang pagbabawal sa aborsyon ay hindi kailanman nagpapababa ng bilang ng mga nagpapagawa nito :) sa halip, itinutulak lang nito ang mga tao sa mapanganib na paraan. at doon nagsisimula ang tunay na trahedya.abortion is healthcare. it is a right.and the choice to bear a child is central to a woman’s life, her dignity, and her very future. it is a choice that belongs to her, and only her.",4
Sunshine,"Where do I even begin? Sunshine feels painfully relevant in a country with high rates of teenage pregnancy, yet where discussions about sex education, abortion, and women’s reproductive rights remain heavily stigmatized. Being a predominantly Catholic country keeps us from moving forward. Silence, shame, and Catholic guilt block real conversations about sex and autonomy. And women end up paying the price. One of the scenes that struck me and honestly infuriated me was when the doctor told Sunshine to ask…",28

Sunshine,"Finally had a chance to watch this, i was meant to watch this when it was showing at the cinemas but so busy until recently saw news that it was gonna come out on Netflix so i was elated. Haha.I like it so much, i love the cast in this film, and i love seeing this kind of quality in Filipino movies which is super rare these days. The story is about a young woman who has a dream that she pursued her whole life and suddenly she becomes pregnant which risks this dream, and now she has to weigh everything carefully because either which choice she pick will be life-changing. The whole movie revolves around that and we get to be introduced to the characters and the environment around her that is essential and will influence the choice she will make. Here we get to see a real picture even though the story is fictional, as filipinos you could almost grasp the realness out of this film and say, this is the REALITY but we don't have to embrace it, WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT. As a man, I always believed that i am no position to speak about what women should and shouldn't do about their bodies, but will absolutely support the concept of abortion. When we speak about abortion in a country that is like the Philippines, that is so centered on religion, abortion becomes a taboo, illegal and unethical. We also see these professionals, government leaders that support this kind of ideology that abortion is bad blah blah blah. This film is a great commentary and an eye opener to what young women and women in general what they go through, and that abortion should become an option for all women in our society. I will just make it clear that i think this film is not pro abortion or anti life, without directly stating it, the film focuses on making better decisions, the importance of protection, sex is more common than we think which is ironic in the Philippines that is so religious but that’s ok, this country just needs proper education and thats it. PS. If you are going to argue with me about me being ok about abortion or use of protection, I’m going to tell you this, how dare you bring a life in this world, in this country that cant do anything about poverty, cant do anything about corrupt politicians, cant vote right, doesn't have an accessible healthcare and on top of that, if you’re a man, stfu, and if you’re a woman, who is not ready, physically, mentally and financially, Ari and that young girl doesn’t deserve to live like that, on the streets or getting abused. But if you are, financially stable, mentally stable and physically stable with a nice and healthy environment to grow a living thing then go fucking crazy.",-1

Sunshine,"sobrang ganda ng symbolism with annika (yung batang babae) which they left for the audience to interpret who (or what) she really is.i personally believe it's those standards set by the society na kinalakihan natin which became part of sunshine's conscience. it's those beliefs thrown into us during childhood that subconsciously shape the way we think and make decisions, and yung pagpigil ni annika kay sunshine and then eventually saying ""gets ko na"" is sunshine finally breaking free from the societal standards. from the stereotypes. from the guilt and fear of being judged.",-1

Sunshine,"In spite of her past controversies, Maris Racal's performance in this film is the very reason why she remains in the spotlight. Her acting as Sunshine is spectacular. The story requires someone who is capable of letting the viewers feel the heaviness of her pain, the agony, and the hope of standing up for yourself and for what you want, and she made us feel all of that. And though I may not completely agree with everything that's pointed out here, I really admire Jadaone's attempt and bravery at addressing such a taboo topic, not just in the Philippines but the rest of the world. Being prayerful and always going to church do not give us the right to see ourselves as being more morally upright than others. When you put all of that aside, Sunshine is just a teenager who regretfully made a mistake and who made a decision for herself, stood up for what she wanted, and spared the child from the resentment of a mom from being robbed of her own dreams, and of leading her to what could possibly be a miserable life.She knows she could be ridiculed for that decision, but she lived according to her own terms anyway. And we know that in the end, she is happy, and that's all that matters.",25

Uniknya alur ceritanya kerasa ga menye-menye karena punya pendekatan yang lembut dan jenaka.Salah satu hal yang memikat lainnya adalah penggambarkan imajinasi wujud sosok anaknya. Kehadiran elemen ini bikin jembatan emosional antara hubungan ibu-anak jadi begitu kuat dan melekat.Pengemasan closure-nya berani nan kontroversial seakan Sunshine ngajarin kalo menatap masa depan juga adalah salah satu bentuk cinta yang tulus.| 2025 Ranked |,-1

Sunshine,sedih  kasian ih,1
Sunshine,"Ang hirap maging babaeng puno ng pangarap. The film Sunshine (2024) resonated with me because it honestly depicts how unforgiving reality can be. It shows how quickly people judge young women, often before they even have a chance to breathe or ask for help. The film also makes painfully clear how the lack of reproductive rights pushes women toward risky, sometimes dangerous choices. You can almost feel Sunshine being boxed in on all sides, not because she did anything wrong, but because society refuses to give her real options.Women in the Philippines face judgment, limited choices, and immense pressure around pregnancy. And the film makes a point I strongly agree with: no government or religious institution should dictate what a woman does with her body. Those decisions belong to the person living that reality, not to people watching from a distance.Sunshine made the right choice. Sobrang taboo sa Pilipinas ang usapang abortion, pero at least the child didn’t grow up feeling guilty or resenting their mother for what might have happened if they hadn’t been born. It’s better for a child to know they were truly wanted, rather than feeling like the product of someone else’s dilemma. Constantly being told they’re a blessing can’t replace the sense of being genuinely chosen.Sana ma-gets ng lahat si Sunshine.",-1

Sunshine,"NO UTERUS, NO COMMENT! I like that Sunshine knows what she wants, that despite being drowned by unsolicited opinions, and thoughts about morality and religion, she chose herself. It’s really hard to go through this phase without parental supervision. I’m glad her sister understands and supports her decision. She will surely carry the heavy weight of all of these… regret, grief, anger, sorrow. I hope she has the mental space and strength to let each emotion settle, not letting it swallow her whole.",-1

For example, yung unang jeep na sinakyan ni Sunshine papuntang quiapo may ""Gift of God"" na nakalagay, wala lang napansin ko lang.All throughout the movie parang ramdam ko din yung pinagdadaanan ni Sunshine.

Sunshine,"Maganda ang pagkakasulat nito—from its storyline to its characters' struggles. I love the use of irony and metaphor throughout the movie (I'm a sucker for these in films). I also love how this movie portrayed women who chose to have an abortion dahil pinakita rito na hindi madaling desisyon ang magpalaglag; kitang-kita ang struggles ng isang babae na hindi pa ready na maging isang ina. This movie echoes the cries of all women who risked their lives undergoing unsafe abortions, as well as those who were forced into childbirth because they had no access to safe options.god forbid a woman wants to have a safe abortion.",5

Sunshine,"‎ang masasabi ko ay tangina, ang hirap maging babae lalo na nasa pilipinas ka pa. walang maayos na healthcare (tangina, may public hospital nga pero sobrang hirap at kailangan mo pa ng backer para lang maasikaso ka ng doctor. puta, malapit ka ng mamamatay kailangan mo pa mag hintay sa emergency bago ka nila i-check at asikasuhin.)‎‎wala pang maayos na suporta sa gobyeryno, hindi binibigyang atensyon ang reproductive health ng mga babae. sobrang relihiyoso, masyadong takot at kinakasuklaman ang usapin sa abortion. kung tutuusin, hindi naman dapat taboo ang abortion. abortion is women's healthcare. no man, no religious beliefs should take a woman's right to her own body. let women decide for themselves, lalo na kung nabuntis sha sa maling paraan at ayaw niyang maging isang ina.‎‎PAKYU sa lahat ng lalaki (lalo na sa mga katulad ni miggy, jaime, at lalo na sa tulad ni bobot.) pakyu din sa mga overly religious na tao na sobrang taas ng tingin sa sarili. fck the patriarchy and fck the government.nakakagalit knowing this is someone's life right now. ilang babae at batang babae pa ba ang makakaranas ng ganitong hirap bago mabigyang atensyon ang karapatan sa reproductive health ng kababaihan?",3

Sunshine,"SOBRA SOBRANG GANDA NG PELIKULA NI DIREK TONETsa sobrang ganda i had to watched it 2 times. hindi ko alam ma fefeel ko after kong unang panuodin ito, sobrang lungkot at bigat dahil alam kong hindi lang ito basta pelikula kundi realidad ng bawat babae, bawat tao, at bawat batang muntik makita ang mundo.i love the jeepney scene, It was a really heavy scene, I think it was me interpreting na iniisip na ni sunshine na 'bakit??, bakit saakin pa? baka hindi na ako makasama sa olympics na ito- bakit?' maybe there was this question of confusion na kahit siya hindi niya masagot.. na kahit saan siya dalhin ni kuya manong at ibaba dala dala parin niya talaga ito (yung bata)I loved how this film not only focuses on abortion rights, but also shows many of the real problems in the Philippines.Napakita talaga kung gaano ka–fucked up ang sistema ng mga hospital dito—kulang sa pasilidad, nagsisiksikan, at ang daming pwedeng mamatay dahil sa ganitong sistema. Sobrang nakakagalit isipin na sa hospital ka pa dapat may chance mabuhay, pero doon ka pa pwedeng bawian.It also shows the messed-up beliefs of people who think it’s “easy” to raise a child. Yung mga nagsasabing “takot mo sa una lang ‘yan” at “biyaya ‘yan ng Panginoon.” I’m not against their beliefs—they’re entitled to them—but I find it toxic. Paano mo kayang sabihin sa isang tao na “biyaya” ito kung galing sa karumaldumal at walang kamalay-malay na kasalanan ng ibang tao? Paano mo sasabihing tanggapin niya na lang ito?I think not everything can be called a blessing. And I don’t think it’s fair to say “binigay ito ng Diyos” kahit mali ang pinanggalingan. When I watched it for the second time, ang dami ko talagang na-notice. Naging malaking tanong sa’kin kung *paano* at *saan* narealize ni Sunshine ang lahat.At first, akala ko si Annika (yung batang babae) was her inner child someone who guides her, the version of herself who dreamed of becoming an Olympian but never got the chance.Yung part sa ilalim ng tulay, nung lumabas na si Ariana — doon ko talaga na-connect. I think Sunshine realized it too. Habang hinahanap niya si Sunshine, hindi siya mapakali. Naging question ko rin talaga kung paano kilala ni Sunshine si Ariana if kakakita niya lang dito? Diba??!And what Ariana said made sense. May part sa movie na sinabi niya na ayaw niyang bumalik sa bahay dahil wala namang may pakialam sa kanya. sabi ni Sunshine doon “Hindi, naguguluhan lang siya.” i think she was referring to marygrace.The conversation between Ariana and Annika (the little girl) really altered my brain.The way they pictured the life they could’ve had in a world they will never get to be part of sobrang bigat..And that line, “Pangarap ko kung anong pangarap ni Sunshine,” grabe.sobrang naiyak ako sa part ng ate niya at si sunshine, grave sobrang galing talaga ni direk tonet. tinanggap at inintindi niya ito ng buong buo mabuhay talaga ang pelikulang ito.Lastly! finally!(ang sobrang daming yap)the last part, yung “gets ko na.” Those words explained everything.It felt like Sunshine was saying,“I hope naiintindihan mo kung bakit ko ‘to ginagawa.”And i know that’s exactly how she felt.Maybe the girl can’t have the world.But no—actually, she did.Because she gave Sunshine the world she always wanted, even if she couldn’t have it herself. ""Pangarap ko kung anong pangarap niya""That “gets ko na” part really hit me.Sobrang bigat. And right after that line,there was a cut showing Sunshine in this moment of relief and it says so much kahit na walang description kahit walang explanation.i love this film na gustong kong yakapin si sunshine at hawakan ang kamay niya at sabihing ""hindi mo ito kasalanan""",6
Sunshine,"ah. beautiful. no words i could come up with aside from that.honestly, when i went to JAFF 2025 in Jogja, i wasn’t really looking forward to watching this film. i was curious because the premise kinda sold me off, but i don’t have any expectations on this film since i thought i could guess where the story ends.turns out i couldn’t.i can’t really say much because i don’t want to spoil anything and i just want people to experience the same awe as i did, so i’m just going to say this:sunshine isn’t about teenage pregnancy; it’s much beyond that. it’s a film about a girl and her big dream, without failing her own humanity that speaks from the deepest part of her tender heart.",-1

Sunshine,"There's something so raw about sunshine... idk if it's the clothes, the setting, or the language used but it feels so real and it should feel real!! It's truly time to wake up and see why abortion is needed especially with teen pregnancies kasi minsan lalaki talaga ang problema, kahit ano sabihin mo, hindi sila kikinig and now women are left with this burden and guilt. The addition of catholic guilt is so UGH AMAZING! Especially with religion being used as a reason to make abortion illegal because it's God's gift. There's so much I want to say about this film but talaga, one of the best films I have watched!! Spoilers! the kid following sunshine around being her unborn child is so crazy  and that moment when the child saw her performance and finally understands why she needs this abortion has so many layers and meaning UGH I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO BADDDDD",4
Sunshine,"i have a lot to say about this movie but if i were to describe it in one sentence, it would be: ang hirap maging babae, at mas mahirap maging babae sa pilipinas. i can tell that this story is well-written. it is my first time watching a filipino movie so realistic and women-focused. this movie depicted the struggles of being a woman—not just sexually, but in all aspects. women are expected to be perfect—capable of carrying the weight, not expected to make any mistakes despite everything hateful is being thrown at us. we are expected to meet and be the standard even if it is out of our capabilities. dahil? babae tayo. at kung ‘di man natin maabot ‘yon, isa tayong kahihiyan. dahil nga, mga babae tayo. kalaban natin ang relihiyon, gobyerno, at bansa na mapang-husga. ika nga ni coach, drown out the noise. but that is not the case. even if you force yourself to be apathetic, you’ll still hear the the voices of the people. mga kabataan nga naman ngayon, hindi na makapag-pigilbawal ‘yan sa batas ng Diyoshindi ko ma-a-admit kaibigan mo dahil illegal ‘yonkung buntis ka, i’ll have to kick you out of my rosteranother thing i loved about this movie is that it was shot in manila and covereed many social issues—making it even more relatable to us filipino. especially when it comes to poverty, dito talaga natin masasabi na mahirap maging mahirap. the film showed the reality of life for those without privilege—struggling to find a tricycle, not having enough money for basic needs, and doing everything we can just to earn a little. even parents are driven to the point of selling their own children.some men, on the other hand, can run away from everything. nakabuntis? kasalanan pa rin natin ‘yang mga babae! kesyo hindi tayo nananamit nang maayos, kesyo tayo raw ang may mali kahit sila naman ang tumakbo sa responsibilidad. here, i saw how cowardly some men can be—afraid to take responsibility for their wrongdoings, and always ready to cling to anyone who will shield them from consequences.lastly, i love how the kids represented their inner child—sunshine’s bata symbolizing her dream of becoming an olympian, while menggay’s bata represented the lgbtq community and her longing to get revenge on those who wronged her. each represented their dreams, no matter how impossible they seemed in their circumstances. each represented their dreams, clinging to whatever little piece of themselves the world hasn’t taken away.",26
Sunshine,"i'm expecting na hindi ko sya mag-gets because i'm a guy pero feel na feel ko sa movie yung experience ng babaeng maagang nabuntis. eto yung script na walang tapon kasi lahat ng binubuga nilang salita, may meaning talaga +++ the cinematography is SICK! overall 10/10, should be an eyeopener sa hayop na bansang to na malegal ang abortion",-1

Sunshine,"Sunshine speaks a truth people keep avoiding: hindi kasalanan piliin ang sarili at mag desisyon para sa sarili mong katawan. choosing abortion, or choosing not to become a mom, doesn’t make someone less human, less moral, or less worthykung tutuusin, abortion should be legal now, but the government and some people are so devoted to their religious beliefs, even though they have no idea what women go through. they keep saying it’s a sin, as if they themselves aren’t sinning every single day. enough with imposing those beliefs on other people’s liveshampasin ko kayo nang bote riyan eh!!!",4

Sunshine,"Whenever Sunshine waves around her colorful ribbon while flowing and gliding through the mat, it's not just a flawless routine at stake. It's the little bit of life growing inside her.Maris Racal anxiously walks through the streets and markets of Quiapo, looking for a way out in the form of illegal drugs hidden beside statues of Mama Mary. Sunshine knows what she wants —to be on the Olympic stage, but the world around her from the kid who knocked her up, to the saleslady who's ""helping"" her, to her sister who also got pregnant, may have different opinions.Sunshine stops by the church, pleading for clarity but also possibly for forgiveness and absolution. But a ghost in the form a kid that calls her a ""murderer"" haunts her the most, popping in and out like a conscience. She was nervously waiting to see what Sunshine would finally decide, and so was I.Pelikulang Pinoy ",17
Sunshine,"Sunshine saying “hindi pa ako ready maging nanay” really hit me. No woman should ever be forced into something she isn’t ready for. And yes I agree with abortion. Every woman has the right to choose what happens to her own body and her own life. No man, or anyone else, gets to decide that for us. And to the men who can’t even take responsibility for being a father? Yeah… fck you.",4
Sunshine,"""gets ko na""that line literally sent me into the abyss. going into the film, i was so confused about the little girl following sunshine. i thought she was sunshine’s inner child, like a guide through the mess, reminding her who she was and what she actually wanted. but when they introduced ariana, the kid that “bata” playmate during that night, everything started clicking.then the incident happened. mary grace (rhed bustamante) tried to get an abortion, and her baby died. when we saw ariana recognize mary grace, and then later, at the hospital, the nurse announced the baby didn’t make it… ariana just disappeared. that’s when it hit me: ariana and bata was supposed to represent the baby, their baby. it felt ironic at first because you’re torn between “should i feel bad?” and “should i feel sad about the literal premise of the film?” but then bata said to sunshine, “gets ko na,” and the whole film just punched my soul.maris racal is easily one of the best actresses of this generation, and sunshine proves that. the film is raw, very indie pinoy cinema vibes, and it works. it also doesn’t shy away from the heavy stuff, like how brutal the philippines can be when judging teenage pregnancy and abortion. the shame, the gossip, the pressure to “keep it,” the lack of safe spaces… the film shows how hard it is for girls to make choices about their own bodies when everyone feels entitled to comment.i just kinda wish they explored sunshine being a public athlete more, like the public eye, the rumors, the judgment she’d face online and her community as the time goes by. the ending showing her making it to the sea games was nice, but i feel like addressing the backlash and the pressure could’ve made the story even stronger.overall: great film. beautiful, painful, and honest. i love you, sunshine.",-1

Sunshine,Well done,1
Sunshine,"I have a lot of feelings to share about this beautiful and heartbreaking film. Truly a big eye-opener to many Filipinos.Women carry a biological physical pain we are given the moment we are born. Period, childbirth, postpartum, etc. But we also carry the pain this world and men cause. The pain men should be held accountable for. Emotional labour, cultural and religious expectations, rape, pregnancy, forms of abuse, etc. It's like our suffering is pre-written, pre-approved, and expected. And yet the world still has all the audacity to treat us as if we're lesser, fragile, dramatic, overreacting. I think I will never be able to understand the logic of a world that demands strength from women and then punishes us for being strong.Like Sunshine and Menggay, a lot of women out there don't have choices. A lot of women are already deprived of basic rights before they even learn to speak. But then again, society still keeps finding new ways to take more from them.The hypocrisy of the Filipinos in this film is also insane but couldn’t be more well depicted. (It’s actually so much worse in real life.) Filipinos will praise God with one hand and strip women of autonomy with the other. Anti-abortion because “God said so,” but silent about abuse, poverty, rape cases, or the girls forced into motherhood long before they even have the chance to understand themselves. They defend unborn children better than they defend the living women who have to endure the burden of carrying them. Because if they don’t, you will judge them. You will shame them. How is that love? How is that morality? Abortion is criminalized, but sexual abuse cases get dismissed.It’s exhausting. It’s enraging.To all of the Sunshines out there, gets na gets ko kayong lahat. The world keeps underestimating and shaming us, but here we are, still standing, still surviving.To end this, I want to share that one monologue in Fleabag that came back to me after watching this film and inspired my entire review:""Women are born with pain built in. It's our physical destiny—period pains, sore boobs, childbirth. We carry it within ourselves throughout our lives. Men don't. They have to seek it out. They invent all these gods and demons so they can feel guilty about things, which is something we do very well on our own. And then they create wars so they can feel things and touch each other and when there aren't any wars they can play rugby. We have it all going on in here, inside. We have pain on a cycle for years and years and years, and then just when you feel you are making peace with it all, what happens? The menopause comes. The fucking menopause comes and it is the most wonderful fucking thing in the world. Yes, your entire pelvic floor crumbles and you get fucking hot and no one cares, but then you're free. No longer a slave, no longer a machine with parts. You're just a person.""",26

Sunshine,"advocating women struggles by showing women living their life. its so important to highlight how the philippine government, society, and healthcare system affect women’s lives, affect how women think, how they should live, and how they should dream. not only does it show the effects of a lack of legal abortion but also shows the effects of a lack of support for women healthcare in general. i still shudder thinking about how there’s hospitals out there that share two people in one hospital bed due to lack of space. on top of that, the people themselves while knowing how shitty the philippine healthcare system is, would still ridicule and isolate women affected by it. overall i love this film, i love women, and i love women who dreams <3",11

Sunshine,"Sunshine is such a good character...she's brave, strong, smart, and righteous and it just makes me proud to have a character like her in Filipino cinema. Overall the movie is amazing because it really sheds light on the struggles that women face in such a conservative country. This is why it's so important that the church and state stay separate  Also it ended in the most perfect way possible.",12
Sunshine,"hindi ko alam kung ilan at paano ko i-rate tong film na to, kasi tangina. una sa lahat, tangina ng mga lalake. pangalawa, ang fucked up talaga ng opinion ng mga pinoy kapag tungkol sa abortion to the point na nakacenter nalang siya kay God, when in fact, kung sino pa yung pala simba sila pa ang mas lason kung mag-isip. may karapatan ang babae kung ano ang gustong gawin nila sa katawan nila. kahit pa sabihin na, oo, nagseggs sila kaya automatic na alam nila kung ano ang mabubuo, pero hindi yun sapat para sabihin mong masama ang abortion. gaya ng scene na sinabi ni miggy na huwag na gumamit ng condom kasi sa labas niya ipuputok, pero anong nangyare?gaya ng nasa pelikula, yung nabuntis ng tito niya. kung masama sa mata ng Diyos ang paglaglag, paano pa kaya ang kasalanan nung tito niya? nagdebate kami noon about sa abortion, ang sabi ko gagawin ko kasi sarili ko ang iniisip ko, na hindi ko kaya at hindi ako ready. pero anong sabi saakin? selfish daw ako kasi hindi ko inisip ang bata kahit pa galing grape cases yan.nagaaral ako ng nursing, at base sa mga pinagaralan ko, habang nasa loob pa yan ng sinapupunan, hindi yan bata. fetus yan. hindi naman puso ang unang nabubuo, kundi ang utak. hindi ko maintindihan kung bakit ang hirap maging babae sa bansang to. wala kayong pake sa mga corrupt na politicians kasi may binibigay na pera sainyo, e kung sa tutuusin galing din naman sa tax natin yon. pero sa abortion na wala naman kayo noong may nangyayare sakanila, kung makapag salita para bang kayo ang mag-bubuntis, mag-hihirap, at mag-papaanak.",3

Sunshine,"realistic portrayal of a woman's struggle. how easy it is for men to just stay out of it. but the woman, she'll swallow the consequences that comes from it. Sunshine made a choice, a brave one. honestly people should know more about a woman's body and how not to dictate what she wants to do with it. how come the unborn has more voice than the woman carrying them? give ko na rin 'to sa sister nya who was ALWAYS there for her and who stood by her until the end. sister's love—im grateful i have that. Sunshine. what a strong woman you are.",-1

Sunshine,Sana ma gets ng mga pilipino,-1
Sunshine,"the film moves slowly, almost cautiously, letting you sit with people who are trying to hold their lives together even when everything around them keeps slipping sideways. nothing is exaggerated; it all feels painfully ordinary in the way real lives are. the characters are not shouting for answers, they are just trying to make sense of the days piling up. there is this constant push and pull between wanting to break free and accepting that the world has edges you cannot always escape.no big revelation, no sudden salvation. just a slow unraveling-that honesty hits harder than any dramatic twist could. thank you",-1
Sunshine,"I teared up. Women can do and not just dream. Why is it ever that when a woman bears life, they are to sacrifice their own dreams and on the other side, men continues to live on vicariously? And so Sunshine flipped the narrative. Live a long good life, Sunshine :)",-1
Sunshine,"Sobrang ganda ng movie nato. Hugs to all the women out there and experiencing the same problems Kahit ako, i would want the best for my mom. Gusto ko matupad niya mga pangarap nya even if it means na wala akoNakakaiyak yung part ng batang narape ng tito niya at kay ariana, i hope there are more people like dr. Helena.",-1
Sunshine,"It was true when they said that this was a brave film. To be one of the first films in pinoy cinema to explore a pro-choice and an unwanted pregnancy narrative is indeed brave, especially when you know the Philippines’ socio-political and religious climate around topics regarding sex, female desires, pregnancy, bodily autonomy, and parenthood.There were unfortunately some parts of the film that felt like they didn’t work.I’m not sure but Sunshine’s decision to abort felt too quick. And her dream to be an Olympian felt underexplored and more of her coach’s. We’re told rather than shown that it was hers.The inclusion of Annika Co whose character can be interpreted as Sunshine’s subconscious/ego or unborn child or whatnot sometimes felt irritating to watch (sorry not sorry). But I guess to reach more towards a predominantly Filipino audience and to highlight Sunshine still being a (teen) child who’s forced to confront the consequences of her choices by a child: worked? I don’t know. Not to mention that it felt a little silly to include two other characters, where one was another pregnant teen girl, that lowkey felt like their stories were being shoved down to the audience’s throats. And in the end, felt shallow. I just think that I hoped they showed more of the technicalities of her being an athlete. Rhythmic gymnastics is considered an elite sport. And when you consider it in the Philippine context – the film didn’t really show what was at stake of being an athlete in this sport. The film’s strong aspects are definitely on the score, cinematography (particularly to highlight the corners of Manila as this chaotic, packed, and cruel city), and of course: Maris’ performance as Sunshine. There were scenes that hit hard and heavy. The irony of abortion drugs sold and found in the street outside a church. The motel scene to show Sunshine’s quiet desperation. Her final rehearsal for her routine before her “gets ko na” scene with Annika (where I cried unfort bcz luteal phase duh).The film does show you a glimpse of the unforgiving reality of what many Filipino women go through everyday: teenage pregnancy, overcrowded and underfunded public hospitals, and the lack of comprehensive sexuality education about sexuality and sexual and reproductive health. It lacked, sure. But I guess, for pinoy cinema to start tackling difficult topics such as this: it’s a start.",-1
Sunshine,genuinely cried so much this isn't funny,15
Sunshine,"This story is so bold in its themes and it got all of it across with no bullshit. It got everything across so straightforwardly, and I applaud it for that.

Sa buong takbo ng pelikulang 'to, mabigat ang loob ko para sa mga katulad ni Sunshine at Mary Grace. Napakasakit isipin na maraming kababaihan ang nabubuntis nang maagang edad ang walang kakayahan o maayos na suporta kahit sa mga pampublikong ospital na gagabay sa kanila. Hindi ko lubos maisip na kailangan pang dumating sa punto na ma-compromise o mag-agaw buhay ang isang babae dahil lang hindi sila handa sa responsibilidad na katulad nito. Ang sakit-sakit lang.

""Gets ko na.""i interpreted the child as her inner conscience kasi pinakita how societal standards (ex: religion na sobrang evident sa movie) affected her decision-making. thats why gustong gusto ko yung linya na yan, kasi sunshine felt na everything was already settled for her and all noises were finally shut out. mas mahalaga parin talaga ang mga pangarap niya para sa kanya.this movie begs the watchers to Be More Understanding. ganun lang kasimple. intindi na hindi lahat ay pare-pareho; at for sunshine & menggay's cases, intindi na hindi lahat ay handang maging ina. unawa lang sa sitwasyon ng iba. tunay naman na abortion is not for all, pero may iba parin na Kailangan ito. why restrict the choices of others diba? legalizing accessible and safe abortion helps girls like sunshine and menggay. no one deserves to be go through those levels of pain. direk tonet's best work yet imo!!!! sunshine is indeed a movie that can move you + can change one's thoughts about abortion. altho i believe sobrang long way to go pa natin. malayo pa tayo sa pinaglalaban natin, ngunit walang imposible. :)",-1

Sunshine,"“naiintindihan mo ba ako?”oo, gets ko na.”this film is raw, relevant and worth seeing. it goes to show that it’s not about changing one’s political belief, but about having radical kindness. the film doesn’t intend you in changing sides, but it teaches you to be more understanding of people’s choices. i’ve known sunshines in my life - a co-worker, a co-worker’s sister, close friends, and old classmates back home. and it’s just sad just how much they were under scrutiny for, for something they should have total control over. it infuriates me even further to realize that back home, abortions are not accessible, and are illegal even. oftentimes the women are frowned upon because of our country’s conservative and religious culture, they face shame and judgement first before they can even get to decide of their own autonomy. meanwhile, the men that are responsible can get to walk away from all scrutiny just because it’s not theirs to hold and carry. to all the sunshines that we know, get to know and may not know yet, they deserve to talk about these things openly, not in secret, not in shame. sunshine reminds us that we definitely have a long way to go. yet a little empathy can go a long way.",-1

Sunshine,"I don't remember where I first heard of it, but the idea has always stayed with me: for every abortion, miscarriage, or infertility, if a women desires to be a mother, it will come to her at the right time—in one form or another.And I think this film beautifully echoes hints of that belief.The part where Sunshine asks the little girl, ""Naiintindihan mo na ba ako?"" And the child replies, ""Gets ko na,"" feels like a simple, but so profound of an exchange of words. It feels like a hand that's gently soothing a wound she's been carrying all this time. A wound that asked to be seen with the nuances that came with it, not the fantasies the society chooses to blind themselves with.Another thing that stood out to me abt this film is how it challenges the viewers to confront the expectations forced onto women simply for existing. Not with judgement, but with a silence that understands what it means to be human.I just love that this film respects women's choices. It doesn't force a message or a narrative that motherhood is the only path to walk through once it enters in a woman's life. Instead, it says that your life, dreams, and timing are all yours regardless of what everyone thinks nor says abt it.Because to be a mother means to be ready mentally, physically, and financially. Love alone isn't enough to carry a life, just a majority of its suffering.",-1

Sunshine,"Rewatch and this time with the knowledge why Jadaone chose Sunshine to be a rhythmic gymnast - isa kasi siya sa mga sports na walang male counterpart sa Olympics, and it is a sport where form and performing in your peak years is crucial - na parehas magiging at risk should Sunshine choose to keep the pregnancy.Wala lang share ko lang. Galing ni direk don! Maganda pa rin on second viewing. Gets na gets pa rin. ",17
Sunshine,tackled every theme on teenage pregnancy that i hoped for :’) yung nagdasal sa labas ng simbahan + search history whahshaha #GETSKONA,5
Sunshine,i have no maternal bone or whatever in me because the whole time i was rooting for sunshine to get a safe abortion T_Tanyway. i love jennica garcia so much!,4
Sunshine,"hooooo pano ko ba to sisimulan,,,, first of direk tonet hands down. maris racal I love you queen GRABE ang dami kong gustong sabihin about sa pelikula na to pero at the same time I can't find the perfect words for it. Thank you for this art. matagal ko na talaga to want panoorin nung nasa cinemas pa lang kaso wala akong time buti na lang naging available siya sa streaming platform but anw back to the topic. sobrang linaw sobrang detailed at sobrang lantad nung mensahe ng pelikula, kung paano yung flow from start to finish. kung ano yung totoong nangyayari o nararansan ng kababaihan sa bansang to. from the dreams, the sacrifices to the guilt. sobrang hirap maging babae sa bansang hindi ka naiintindihan. sa bansang palagi kang vinivillainized at dinidiktahan at kinokontrol ka sa sarili mong katawan. damang dama yung bigat sobrang tagos na tagos. as much as she loves her life... her dreams nandon pa rin yung bigat sa gagawin niya and the allegory/metaphorical representation as the unborn child??? made me weak and cried nung ginagawa ni sunshine yung reps/performance niya then the proud look of the child as she claps,,, how sunshine asked her kung naiintindihan ba siya and how the kid says gets ko na like FUCCCCCKKKK para akong sinaksak dinurog at pinirapiraso.AND THE ""pangarap ko ang pangarap niya"" (brb T___T)sobrang AAAAAAAHHH how this film makes me and how this film feels like a hug to every woman. I love you Sunshine!!!!!!kaya sanaaa sana sana sana as much as this film hugs every woman I hope the country opens their minds, their eyes, and their understanding to this film. kasi pagod na pagod na pagod na kami to be misunderstood and neglected. kaya sana mas bumukas pa yung usapin about reproductive health and mabigyan din ng bukas na isipan hindi lang tayong mga mamamayan pati na rin yung gobyerno. reproductive health is important, abortion is healthcare, tama na pagpipigil at pagbubusal sa karapatan namin. please lang.",0

Sunshine,"Took me a while to write a review about this film. Despite showing a lot of things the film didn’t missed to emphasize what are the struggles that a woman has to faced in the reality of life. Chismis dito chismis doon, a government that failed to provide protection and assistance, and specifically “Men” but it is never about them. At the latter point of the film when she was given a “probably” better future for her kid, I was…",36

Sunshine,"Sunshine is on the edge of her Olympic breakthrough when she discovers she’s pregnant, sending her into a desperate search for options that won’t take her dream away. The acting is great (especially that little girl and her unfiltered mouth!). A tough story told with so much clarity and heart.",17
Sunshine,"A world closing in. Excellent use of chaos and noise. The entire film is suffocation and endless running and running out of breath. No room to stretch one’s legs.Navigating malicious intents, judgments, and conversations, while your life is threatening to implode. An entanglement of choices and their repercussions plus the absolute need to deal with them. Maybe the ribbon gets loose, maybe it gets tight. No choice but to face it and pull yourself out inch by inch. Rhythmic gymnastics was so fitting! Two particular moments felt like sighs of relief. And those were all that she ever needed. “Naiintindihan mo ba ‘ko?”“Gets ko na.”Chills. Literal chills.Jennica Garcia. That’s a SISTER! Maris Racal. Phenomenal! WOMEN!!!Francisco representation! LolThis is a film about mental health. ",23
Sunshine,"i have no more comments, but really, i love the purity and rawness of this film",8
Sunshine,an important but very heavy film. had to watch in 3 trenches cos it was acsh rly making me super sad hahaha but it's so valuablei'd love to say that everyone has to watch this bc of the subj matter and the social commentary but truth is it might be too heavy for many... rightfully so... touched on so many loaded layers of filipino society and it did so with great respect but enough criticism. galingfirst maris racal film and she did great!!! bleh just so many shots to my heart with this film :(speaking of shots... cinematography was very intentional and i appreciated it. always liked antoinettte jadaone films (go csa!) but this one i loved for a diff reason.. watch if u can!,9

Sunshine,"The Philippines NEEDED this film!Not only does it talk about teenage pregnancy, pre-marital sex and how women's lives, hopes and dreams being put aside for a pregnancy, but it also talks about the uncomfortable truth of how abortion really is in the Philippines and how unsafe, unavailable and painfully unaccepted it is in our society.Amazing actors! Such a beautiful movie! <3",13
Sunshine,I mean every Antoinette jadaone film is good eh the message of the film is on point. I BAWLEDDDD nung narealize ko.,-1
Sunshine,"I loved it to bits. The Philippines has always been against abortions due to its religious nature, so I love that this is the kind of film that will spark conversations about the said controversial yet necessary topic. I for one can never fully give my stance since I am religious but also because I am not a woman. I've always believed that the woman is the one that should decide on what to do with an unwanted pregnancy. So, to see pros and cons of wanting to abort a child as well as choosing to go through abortion was quite engaging and I understand things more now. To see the horrors of using illegal ways of abortion was eye-opening, in all honesty. The film did a fantastic job of showcasing these issues, as the message was loud, clear and perfect. I'd say that my only issue with this film is that I wish the story was more fleshed out in a way. Also, it was blatantly obvious that the mysterious (and annoying, mind you) little girl was Sunshine's supposed daughter. I would've honestly preferred it if it wasn't made obvious.",13

Sunshine,"First Letterboxd essay — I had an itch to scratch so bad with this one. Also medyo late, crammer kasi year-end na :) Right off the bat, I knew how reviews of this film would look like. At hindi naman nagkamali. This film is highly praised, receiving remarks such as masterpiece, brave, and a stepping stone.Yet to my surprise, a few share the same sentiments I had, thoughts that were brewing in me while watching Sunshine. Kaya rin ang hirap buuin ng review na ito (bukod sa hindi naman talaga ako nag-eessay sa plataporma na ito), kasi ayoko maging echo lamang.Anyways, just for the sake of sharing kahit onti:(1) I agree that the supposed personified child is, safe to say, contradictory. Kahit may explanation si Direk Jadaone, it still felt conflicting and made the film unsure of itself.(2) The introduction of some characters felt out of place. In some aspect parang chess yan, character placement and arcs matter, so the player must be aware of their moves.(3) The slap in the face commentary on religion felt overdone. Sayang ang parts and points na pwede pang mahimay.Oh diba, dami niyang sinasabi. But in all honesty, I really felt the need to essay the hell out of this review. Mahalaga sa akin ang usapang SRH at syempre mahalaga rin sa akin na maging diskurso ito.And dahil diyan, here’s a point I feel no one else has raised. Personally, it felt like under-researched ang pelikula. Bakit? Mababaw pa ang na-capture nitong realidad ng abortion at ang hirap na nadadanas ng kababaihan sa kalusugan. These are things you would know agad with one simple search on Reddit. Gets ba? (Lol) And to think na mas layered and complex pa dapat ito sa sitwasyon ni Sunshine, as a student-athlete with financial instability. Sayang lang, ano? Syempre may good points din ang Sunshine sa pananaw ko. Visually, it did its thing. Acting, no doubt, great talents, especially Maris and Jennica. The fact that I watched this with my parents and that they were genuinely interested and concerned about the film is a good point.Sa dulo naman, baka expectations ko rin ang rason kaya ko ito naisip. From here on, sana hindi laging hanggang unang bato lang. Here’s to hoping na makahakbang at makausad na tayo.",6
Sunshine,"i feel like i could have empathized with her more if the film showed how her imaginary child gradually understands sunshine from her own perspective like how? How would she even know? lol aside from that, we could’ve explored more of why this sport is so important to her instead of adding a subplot (that 13 yr old girl case) that makes her situation feel less serious.her feelings and reasons are all valid but that subplot makes her look careless and kinda dumb lol so it’s hard to root for her tbh also, her imaginary child looks cute, healthy, and fun to talk with... why would she think of aborting her if that’s what her imaginary child is going to look like growing up?????? the imaginary child should reflect the life she can’t give or the pressure she feels or at least something burdensome that is so much worse, not some fantasy lolz. gets na niya, hinayaan niya, tinaggap nalang niya ang fate niya kahit imaginary siya.",-1
Sunshine,"I’ll be honest, underwhelming siya for me. Siguro tumaas lang expectations ko dahil sa dami ng reviews na nakita ko sa social media (na hindi ko binasa para iwas spoiler) at syempre dahil sa haba ng theatrical run niya. What I genuinely liked were the performances. They hired competent actors, and it shows. And since marami na rin akong napanood na Jadaone films, andun pa rin ’yun trademark angst niya—and I love that for her.Ang hindi ko kinaya ay ’yun imaginary children. Siguro kasi sobrang dami ko nang nakitang ganitong atake sa short films at full-length lalo na kapag tungkol sa abortion kaya hindi na bago sa paningin ko. I get kung bakit siya ginamit as a plot device to feel “innovative,” especially with a message that wants to tell the masses na okay lang piliin ang sarili at magpa-abort. Importanteng mensahe ’yun.Kaso… hindi ako nadala emotionally. May mga babae akong kakilala na nagpa-abort at grabe ’yun pinagdaanan nila. Compared sa mga kwentong narinig ko, ang nipis lang ng emotional experience ni Sunshine sa film. Kaya siguro nainis ako sa imaginary children na atake. The feeling itself of learning you're pregnant tapos mag-decide to get an abortion already carries so many complex emotions. Hindi mo na kailangan idikit pa ’yun mga bata to prove a point.Hindi ko rin nagustuhan na parang ang babaw ng pagkakahandle sa kwento nung batang na-rape ng tito niya. Pakiramdam ko ibang pelikula dapat ’yun—isang pelikula na mas malalim at mas handang i-tackle ’yun bigat ng topic.Feeling ko kung lalaki ka, baka mas ""oks"" itong film para sayo. Pero bilang babae… parang kulang pa. Hay. Miss ko ’yun docu days ni Jadaone. Can we bring her back? Charot.",-1
Sunshine,"I’m very grateful at this film’s attempt to keep the narrative always in favor of pro-choice.For a recent narrative on a young woman’s choice about her pregnancy, this film plays a lot of modern elements well. Social media is used several times throughout the start of the film, but none of it is cliché or abhorrent. Each social media is used in a very relatable way, which kind of shocked me but it was a feature of the film I really appreciated. Sunshine’s panic is so realistic and grounding too, the performance is amazing. In terms of tonal shifting, the film does a really great job at keeping it’s theme and message intense and suffocating, much like Sunshine’s need to make a decision. It should ALWAYS be the woman’s choice!!",5
Sunshine,LOVED this grabe gets na gets kita sunshine im so glad that you chose yourself,2
Sunshine,"i have been waiting to watch this film ever since the behind the scenes photos of Xyriel Manabat came out and it was worth it. it did not feel exaggerated, hits its points especially the tiniest details such as the looming hunch of security in the depths of Manila (a place full of otherworldly side quests, brimming of characters,, from experience). Annika Co's acting was great, seeing her go from showtime to an actual movie is such a heartwarming sight. i love home but man there is so many things that are outdated, the mention of using ""hilot"" to mend a situation of a pregnant 13 year old girl, women’s health care OR even the fuck ass health care system itself, which is greatly shown, overpopulation, etc, you name it. it's too corrupt, and i feel like ending the film with sunshine on her own way was the best (and only) way to do it.",-1
Sunshine,"kung sana lang talaga binibigyang pansin ang health care system dito sa Pilipinas eh no. grabe ka maris racal, kuhang-kuha mo na naman ako. also can i just say that annika co slayed so hard on this one? hayy. cinematography! scoring! screenplay! editing! this one deserves an award. walang tapon. jennica garcia? elijah canlas? merryl soriano? walang tapon! ganda.",6

Sunshine,"ive been waiting for this to come out on netflix and it is honestly such a GREAT commentary on anti-abortion laws in the philippines and in religious/third world countries as a whole. it truly is a privilege to have the right to our own bodies.the writing of this movie was quite interesting and i believe the children held so much significance to the development and the decision making of the main lead. i believe they are the make-believe consciousness of the “thing” (lets stop calling them babies PLEASE) inside the main lead and the 13yo girl, and i LOVED being so confused and then realising this later on. “drown out the noise” something we need to tell ourselves more often than not. we shouldn’t listen to outside opinions of what to do with ourselves and our own bodies. it is the happiest way to live and love life.i hold this movie very close to my heart and living in a country where abortion is legal is a HUGE privilege and i look forward to the days where religious doctrine dont run the government and put its citizens in a chokehold. religious or not, DON’T tell ANYONE what to do with their bodies, we are all in different circumstances and have wants/dreams/aspirations we’d like to pursue for our own happiness and that’s not selfish.",13
Sunshine,"my best friend sent a message in the group chat saying “guys please don’t ever get pregnant” fresh after watching this. i laughed in my mind thinking how is that even gonna happen. but here i am sobbing like a child and wishing that nobody ever gets pregnant against their will. what a demented, horrifying, and pathetic world we live in. this film plunged my heart deep into my guts from the very beginning. it’s already hard being a girl and then you have systems in place that form a fist around your throat. this was so well made that none of it looked fake. i mean it’s so funny to see the juxtaposition of the church and the “pamparegla” vendors that are still there today. maybe it’s more sad really but that is the reality. i don’t know i guess it is so hard to explain the horrors of being a woman. men get to conveniently be selfish as part of their nature but putting yourself first as a girl needs an apology from god. men regard laws only when they can deny women any autonomy, but break them with ease for their own disgusting desires and freely laugh about it with their friends. i am so glad this film ended the way it did but i am also very sad and angry that girls who meet the same fate have to suffer maybe even worse than this. and that’s when i know god is not a woman.",5
Sunshine,"Society claims to protect the “unborn child,” yet the conversation often leaves out the women whose bodies, health, and futures are directly involved. It feels unsettling to watch how easily society dismisses the experiences of women, as if their lives become secondary the moment they become pregnant. I can’t ignore how deeply this connects to the patriarchal norms I’ve grown up seeing. From subtle expectations to outright judgment, there is a long history of controlling women’s bodies and decisions. The shame placed on those who consider or seek abortion is not just personal; it is cultural and religious, embedded in systems that teach us to shame and question women’s choices instead of supporting them. This made us more aware of how easily society turns compassion into condemnation when it comes to reproductive health.P'wede ba pag walang matres, 'wag na bumoses?",-1
Sunshine,grabe ang lala nastress ako pero shit ganda nung movie. gets na gets ko,-1
Sunshine,"I really like most of Jadaone's works, some of em were even my all time faves, I just love it when she focuses on the realistic and simple stuff. The fantastical elements really took me out a bit and some scenes where it's like spoonfeeding the information to the viewers imo. I'm still rooting for Jadaone and some other directors to make more realistic and relatable mainstream drama films.",-1
Sunshine,"Gets ko na. at gaya ng ate mo at ng bata, kakampi mo rin ako, Sunshine.WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL FILM!!!!",6
Sunshine,"hindi ko alam kung anong mas mabigat habang pinapanood ko Sunshine — yung katahimikan ng mga babaeng walang mapagsabihan, o yung ingay ng mundong ang bilis humusga pero ang bagal tumulong. Jadaone films always stab softly, pero ito? Parang dahan-dahang hinihiwa yung dibdib, layer by layer, para ipakita yung takot, pangarap, at kahihiyang matagal nang nakatago sa ilalim ng “ok lang ako.”this is the kind of film na hindi mo papanoorin para gumaan ang loob mo, papanoorin mo siya para maalala kung gaano kabigat mabuhay bilang babae sa bansang ayaw umamin na may mali sa sistemang sinasamba nito. Sunshine doesn’t preach. it just stands there, raw and trembling, asking the kind of questions we’re trained to avoid:Paano ka pipili kung lahat ng choice mo ay kasalanan sa mata ng iba?Paano ka lalaban kung mismong katawan mo ang pinaparusahan?Maris Racal is devastating in ways na hindi loud pero lumalalim. hindi siya yung tipikal na dramatic heroine — she’s simply a girl suspended between a dream and a reality that keeps shrinking her choices. her silence says more than any monologue could. every frame feels like a confession: hesitant, trembling, pero totoo.and what struck me most wasn’t the gymnastics, or even the central issue of abortion. it was the ache between who we want to become and what our circumstances force us to be. nakakapagod maging babae sa Pilipinas — laging may moral lesson, laging monitored, laging may takot na isang maling galaw lang, tapos na ang lahat. parang ang liit liit ng mundo mo kahit ang laki laki ng pangarap mo.Sunshine doesn’t romanticize any of this. walang sermon, walang cinematic gloss. just a raw, unfiltered look at how dreams bruise under a society na mas mabilis manghusga kaysa umintindi. the film’s imperfections — the loose ends, the uneven metaphors, the sometimes rushed stakes — oddly work in its favor. because real life isn’t clean. hindi linear ang trauma. hindi laging malinaw ang choice. and maybe that’s the point: that we’re all navigating a world built not on empathy, but on fear and control.in the end, Sunshine feels less like a movie and more like a mirror — one that forces you to sit with the darkness until you finally admit na masakit talaga ang liwanag. it’s an eye-opener not because it shocks, but because it whispers truths we’ve mastered the art of ignoring.a film worth watching, not because it entertains, but because it confronts. because it nudges you to look beyond the screen and into the world we built… and ask, Bakit ganito?And more importantly — hanggang kailan?",6

Sunshine,"Ang hirap maging babae.Sunshine touched on some of the most sensitive and difficult struggle of being a woman... especially in the Philippines. One of which is the inaccessibility to women-friendly environments, may it be in your household, in public, at the hospital, at school. And when I say women-friendly, it's the support for the emotional and mental consequences, and physical choices for oneself. We suffer consequences that are beyond our own control but when we decide how to deal with it, our surroundings tend to vilify us for our choices. But Sunshine shows us that we are in charge of our own choices however we like it. We know our bodies, our dreams, our capacities the best. Salamat Sunshine at nagwagi pa rin tayo sa pagtatapos ng pelikula.",-1

Sunshine,"abortion is a topic i usually avoid because it’s morally, socially, and emotionally heavy. what i loved about this film is how it didn’t shy away from that weight, showing how complicated it really is especially in a conservative, Catholic society like ours where abortion is still illegal and pregnant teens are often judged and shamed. i liked how they showed that harsh reality here. and i also really liked Maris Racal’s performance, i think she brought so much depth and vulnerability to her role.i’m a Christian, so of course i have my own beliefs. but honestly, i don’t think life is always black and white. i do believe every woman should have a say over her own body. we shouldn't force someone into a choice they aren't ready for. if she isn't ready to be a mother, she may not be able to provide the care a child deserves. sometimes, the bravest and kindest choice a woman can make is the one who chooses the best for herself, who considers her life and circumstances. at the end of the day, it's not our body, not our life, not our consequences so we shouldn't judge. we're called to love, to show mercy, and to respect the dignity and choice of others. after all... autonomy is a lifeline.",5

Lahat yon dahil lang sa di pagcondom nung guy?? Like ang unfair ng trade-off talaga.Ganda ng cinematography. and yung sound during practice, its giving “Challengers (2024)” like, tungtungunun eme.

Sunshine,"""A woman’s body is not a vessel only to bend for a man’s morals nor a canvas for a man’s shame.""Imagine a young woman who is chasing her dreams, but being struck down by laws made by patriarchal society which restricts and shames her for taking decisions for her own body. We failed our women! Antoinette jadaone’s SUNSHINE is powerful , poignant, beautiful, and yet heartbreaking which showcases the crisis of young age pregnancy, the taboo and the shame comes with it, hypocrisy of society and being resilient and standing up for yourself and for your dreams over anyone. It’s not a fairytale, but a hard hitting truth. There is no ending to this cycle of shame for women who are bred in this macho-feudal society, how religion and social taboos remain a bottleneck than a savior. But the movie overcomes those things so bravely and leads a courageous path to tell women to take their rights in their own hands. I really loved the idea of her imaginative child being with her all the time, giving her strength, and emotional support and that final moment between those two is tear jerking. What most people think it was a sad ending, but actually it was not, it was an inspiring ending which reaffirms that every woman should have the right to make a decision for herself. Abortion is actually less cruel than bringing a baby in this hell hole and making its life shitty, when its parents are not capable of taking care of it mentally, physically, financially and emotionally. You are not only ruining one life, but multiple lives.2025 Movies Ranked",7

Sunshine,"such a beautiful film and i think everyone should watch it. i got scared that it would be a pro-life film, but it wasn’t. thank you. my fav thing in filipino movies is how they express real life issues in a creative ways. #MakeAbortionLegal",13
Sunshine,Yes. I get it.,-1

Sunshine,this is one of the first of many i went berserk to a character whose only purpose is to push our mc feel anguish and it even made me feel a chill on my bones for how it felt very similar to what i had experience when i was admitted from a failed attempt of hurting myself like goddamn right at my chest,-1

Sunshine,A spectacular film through and through.,8
Sunshine,"i love sunshine— despite all the doubts and fears, she remained strong and brave. i couldn’t imagine how I’m going to handle that situation. she really wanted that SEA games/olympics. im so happy we got to see what she really WANTED:)",-1
Sunshine,"Nakakalungkot lang. Basta. It brought me back to the Fangirl days when it gave me the chills about how being a delulu can bring you to your worst disappointments. But this time, Sunshine hits different. When you realize what she did to achieve her dreams, you'd be flabbergasted. It's giving The Unforgivable dilemma. Biktima lang din talaga si Sunshine ng circumstances.Sunshine is just one of the many girls in the society who still get solely blamed for the acts that should also be blamed on the boys. This movie is not just your typical feminist film; it speaks of depth, especially on the challenges of women and the dilemma they face. Isa pa sa nagustuhan ko sa film na to is yung pinadama niya yung hopelessness ni Sunshine. Di naman sa ayaw ko ng movies na binibigyan ng pag-asa ang main character sa huli, pero this served something different and it worked. It's when she was forced to choose between two things, and ended up choosing what's best for her, even if it meant—basta. May empathy ka pa din kay Sunshine kahit labag sa iyong kalooban ang kanyang gagawin (as a Filipino Catholic).Sobrang ironic lang din ng title, which I admire. Yung nakita ni Sunshine ang liwanag ng kanyang mga pangarap, pero di man lang nasikatan ng araw ang kanyang—Ang sa akin lang, ***** Bobot yan .",17
Sunshine,"may review ako rito,, saka na busy pa ako eh",1
Sunshine,"I love how it touched varying aspects tied to pregnancy, abortion, and struggles of contemporary women/girls. Always a fan of direk Jadaone's writing and direction. Mabuhay sa naging bahagi ng pelikulang ito.Abante babae! Palaban militante!",-1
Sunshine,"“gets ko na”Imagine if this were someone's life, not knowing which path to choose: your own future? Or the potential future of your unborn child? Sunshine is incredibly brave. And I just realized, Anika is the future child, and Ariana is Mary Grace's daughter? the creator of this movie is so smart. A fresh film for Filipino movie. This is truly a must-watch.NO DOUBT WHY MARIS RACAL IS STILL A GOOD ACTRESS DESPITE OF ALL HER ISSUES.",-1

Sunshine,"“i’m not ready to be a dad yet”madaling sabihin, mabilis bitawan. may pribilehiyo ang isang lalaki na pumili kung kailan niya lamang gusto o kayang managot. ngunit para kay sunshine, kahit isang beses ‘man lamang, tinanong ba sa kanya kung handa ba siya maging nanay?takot. immature. unprepared. madami pang mga bagay na tinatawag sa mga lalaki kapag sila ang umaatras. pero para sa mga kababaihan? pokpok. iresponsable. padalos-dalos. pabaya. walang puso. ang kanilang katawan ay tila nakakulong sa sitwasyon, at wala itong pakialam kung handa ka o hindi; at mas lalong walang pakialam ang lipunang mapanghusga.bakit hinahayaan na lamang natin na ang babae ang pumapasan ng responsibilidad na dapat ay pinaghahatian?",3

Tipong 13-years-old pinapag-initan ng mga dapat na mag-alaga sa kaniya, si Sunshine na kakatapos lang magdusa na sinermonan pa, magkakasama lahat ng may pregnancy-related cases sa isang ospital, mga babaeng ginagawa ang lahat kahit na 'ilegal' bagamat inclined ang lipunan nila sa paniniwalang espirituwal.

Sunshine,"ariana: wag ka nga mangialam dito. usapang bata to.sunshine: oh, bakit? bata din naman ako ah kaya nga ayoko maging nanay.i hate the fact that this reflects the reality of most girls in the philippines women not being able to access abortion is a crime against women’s health and well-being i can’t stomach that hospitals don’t accept girls who resort to unofficial or “illegal” abortion pills — bcs what else can these girls do when they’re put in an unwarranted position like menggay who was impregnated by her uncle?? after being violated she’s expected to be tied to a responsibility caused by someone else’s crime against her? do you really want that for her when she was raped ?TRUE FREEDOM IS HAVING THE RIGHT TO CHOOSEwhat a hell it is to be a woman with no freedom to choose for ourselves++ and accessing contraceptives without being shamed should be the norm esp as we head into 2026 !! sunshine being humiliated for buying a pregnancy test is CRAZY let’s make it more accessible shall we? philippines ? putangina naman oh",11

Sunshine,"sobrang hirap maging babae lalo na kapag sa pilipinas ka nakatira. sana maintidihan ng pro-lifers na criminalizing abortion doesn't stop women from doing it, instead it makes it unsafe and puts women's life at risk. nadurog talaga yung puso ko nung rhed was denied medical care kahit halos she's on her death bed dahil lang nagpa-abort siya.",4
Sunshine,great acting and uh great contraception guys,5
Sunshine,"this film is a deeply realistic exploration of what it means to be a woman in the philippines—a country where patriarchy, tradition, religion, and economic pressure converge in ways that make womanhood both exhausting and precarious. Importantly, the film is not a pro-life statement, nor does it romanticize suffering or prescribe motherhood as a moral imperative. instead, it shows that the choices women face are complex, constrained, and often invisible to those who hold power.it also addresses the ways women navigate survival under these pressures. it shows that women are often responsible for both care work and emotional labor without recognition or support. the everyday reality of harassment, unsafe streets, economic vulnerability, and social judgment creates conditions in which reproductive choice becomes a deeply personal but politically fraught decision. the film does not moralize these choices; it presents them with nuance, empathy, and a refusal to simplify the stakes into a pro-life narrative.at higit sa lahat, thank you, sunshine, sa pagpukpok ng bote sa tito.",26

Sunshine,"rating 5 stars is not enough... honestly the best filipino film ever and it talks about abortion in such honesty, bravery, and emotional depth. let women chase their goals without limitations and ensure that their right to make decisions about their own bodies is fully respected and protected. !!!! it's never illegal to live your life and choose what’s best for you !!!!",-1
Sunshine,"This goes by the saying that there really are choices to be made, actions to be done, and decisions to decide. This is a reminder that life is not picture perfect and it could go from bad to worse. I took the time to really understand the movie’s roots and motive, and as a teenage girl, it really reflects my fear. Trying so hard to be something you become nothing. Especially with how there are religious motifs, it really lives deep within you, the guilt, the unremovable mark of every lesson that you have to incline within you. Whether the impact is small or big, you just can not wash off what they say should be your purpose in life. A dreadful life where a teenagee is torn between her dream and catholic guilt.",-1
Sunshine,"ako din, gets ko na.this film has quickly outranked some of the other recently released filipino films that i’ve seen. maris racal was perfect for the main role and rhed bustamante’s performance was chilling. one thing that i could point out though is that annika co’s delivery the conyo accent slipped from time to time and didn’t fully match her character. but overall, i believe that everyone’s performance in this film exceeded expectations, the storyline was great, and the cinematography was well-executed.",-1
Sunshine,"Once again, cried because of societal issues",15
Sunshine,"Still unflinching and so hard-hitting. Always best seen with a crowd. I don’t mind watching this again with my other friends, with my fam, with the whole class, with someone who’s curious. It’s just so good. Maris Racal’s breakthrough performance, very deserving ng Urian! Give her the awards! SWEEPPPPP",10
Sunshine,it's hurts to know people have to risk their lives because abortion is not legal in this country. people especially women deserve freedom to choose what should they do to their lives. MAKE ABORTION LEGAL !!,4
Sunshine,"This is a blistering, gut-punching film that doesn’t just ask difficult questions about bodily autonomy and Olympic dreams; it screams them into the humid, chaotic reality of Manila. It’s a brave, essential piece of cinema that confronts the devastating consequences of living in a country where a woman’s control over her own body is perpetually under threat. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and utterly visceral—it’s relentless, trapping us inside Sunshine’s suffocating anxiety. Jadaone uses the oppressive visual texture of Quiapo’s crowded, sweltering streets—a perfect, gritty backdrop—to symbolize the labyrinthine journey of a young woman navigating impossible choices in a system designed to fail her.A massive and well-deserved standing ovation goes to the central performances. Maris Racal is devastating as the titular gymnast, embodying the crushing physical and emotional burden with every strained muscle and every desperate, silent plea. Her performance is a masterclass in controlled despair, capturing the agony of a lifetime of sacrifice being threatened in an instant. She is perfectly complemented by Annika Co’s mesmerizing, eerie, and unrelenting presence as the Kid—an unsettling narrative device that functions as both Sunshine’s internal critic and her desperate conscience. But let’s be real: the film’s rawest emotional hook comes from the shocking failure and apathy of the men around her. Their irresponsibility and sheer lack of accountability form a central, infuriating symbol of the patriarchal society that traps Sunshine.Ang hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas. Every day feels like a battle against a society na paulit-ulit kang nilalagay sa kahon, insisting that your worth begins and ends with motherhood. Fuck the stigma na finoforce ang mga kababaihan into roles they never agreed to—parang automatic default na lang na dapat tahimik, dapat magtiis, dapat magpakamartir. Walang puwang para sa sariling pangarap, sariling katawan, sariling desisyon.Kaya sana mas umingay at mas mapag-usapan ang Reproductive Rights—hindi lang as a “women’s issue” but as a basic human right. This is about giving women the freedom to choose, the safety to seek care without judgment, and the dignity to exist without being shamed or controlled. Hanggang hindi natin tinatalakay nang seryoso ang mga ito, paulit-ulit lang tayo sa cycle ng stigma, trauma, at kawalan ng choices.Being a woman here shouldn't feel like a punishment. It shouldn't demand silence in exchange for survival. And yet, dito sa Pilipinas, ganun pa rin ang realidad—and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.Putangina, Miggy/Miguel na naman!",-1
Sunshine,"gets ko na, naiintindihan kita sunshine.",2
Sunshine,"not me crying in the last scene when the kid said “gets ko na”  that line alone broke me.it shows the reality of so many women being abused, raped, silenced and then forced into motherhood they never asked for!!!this country still treats pregnancy like a moral test instead of a health issue and how abortion is demonized instead of seen as a life-saving option. they judge wome but never the system that failed them. we blame girls for getting pregnant, but not the men who hurt them!!! and forcing someone especially a minor to give birth when she’s not ready???? reproductive rights ARE human rights and that choosing not to carry a pregnancy is valid!!!",4

Sunshine,gets ko na.,29
Sunshine,such a well-written movie,8
Sunshine,"DIREK TONET! YOU DID IT AGAIN!first of all, this should be more relevant than it is. being pro choice and growing up somehow religious, I know what other people think of abortion. especially yung mga sagradong katoliko. and that scene where sunshine went to church and immediately begged for forgiveness showcased EXACTLY THAT. (religious guilt!!!) it perfectly captures how the film isn’t just telling a story, but also reflecting a very real internal conflict na ang daming pinoy women who quietly deals with—yung clash between what you personally believe is right for your body and what your religion tells you is a sin. ang bigat pakinggan at panoorin.""buntis lang ako, 'di to nakakahawa""kahit sa kapwa babae natin di mapipigilan yung judgement eh. kasi ganun yung pagpapalaki satin which is honestly fucked up. and that line hits SO hard because it’s a commentary on how society treats pregnancy like a moral failure instead of a situation that needs support, empathy, and actual options. the film shows how even other women, who should’ve been supporting you, end up policing each other because yun yung environment na kinalakihan natin. tangina diba?!!?also the irony of buying abortion pills at a church and you can't get a room at a motel ALONE?? the system makes it impossible for women to make decisions about their own bodies, pero at the same time they judge you for every workaround you try to do. also for young girls who get raped and still, THEY have to deal with the consequences. it exposes how the philippines forces women into shame, secrecy, and inconvenience—and then they act shocked when women feel unsafe or unsupported. it’s painfully real, and so, so on point.overall, i love this movie because it's honest in a way that most local films are too scared to be. some women don't have a choice, and it's important that WE DO HAVE A CHOICE. LET WOMEN HAVE THEIR DREAMS!!!",5
Sunshine,"I love you forever shine, well deserved top1 on netflix!! daming side comments ni nay haha ayoko nalang magsalita hayup.",24
Sunshine,"it’s beautiful. it’s brave. it’s heavy. it’s painful.it’s hard to be a woman. even harder to be a woman in the philippines.one of our professors once told us that our laws are deeply embedded into our culture. that’s why there’s no abortion in the philippines… because of our strong religious beliefs. if you choose abortion as your option, you’re immediately seen as a murderer, a sinner, by our legal system and, of course, by god’s law. the same religious beliefs hiding under the skirt of a patriarchal culture, doing nothing but scaring women away from their own choices.sana, ngayon, gets n’yo na. gets na ng marami.that this kind of decision has never, ever been easy.and i hope that now, we finally push for comprehensive sex education, free check-ups and contraceptives as reproductive health rights, and the legalization of abortion in the philippines, so no woman ever has to resort to unsafe methods while carrying the guilt and the danger all on her own.there are so many deep-rooted problems tied to abortion that we need to confront and tear down. only then can we truly set women free.",11
Sunshine,"first of all, gusto ko rin ng isang ate geleen hands down to maris' restrained but deeply affecting performance. ramdam mo 'yong bawat pag-aalinlangan at takot—every moment where the world presses a little too hard on a young girl who only wanted to chase her dream.what makes the film even more powerful is its raw, unflinching portrayal of philippine society. the story exposes how reproductive rights in the country are entangled with religion, shame, and systemic neglect. it shows how a woman's body becomes a public issue the moment it no longer fits moral expectations, and how access to safe, affordable healthcare quickly turns into a privilege instead of a right. ultimately, sunshine champions a woman's right to her body, her choices, and her future—even in a society that constantly takes those away.",-1
Sunshine,"""ayoko maging nanay. hindi ko ipapanganak 'to dahil hindi ako ready maging nanay.""better not to be a parent than be a bad parent!! this alone should be reason enough. no amount of moral and religious qualms, judgment from others, and what-if's about the future should offset a woman’s right to decide what happens to her own body and her own life. gets kita, sunshine ",-1

At nakita ko sa kanila kung gano kahalaga magkaroon ng autonomy; at sana yon ang reality ng lahat ng kababaihan didto satin. Ang ganda ng mga pelikula gaya ng Sunshine, kasi napag-uusapan natin ang mga bagay na dapat noon pa man ay napag-uusapan na. Ang aborsyon ay karapatan ng kababaihan. Ang pagccriminalize dito ay nakakaendanger lang sa buhay ng mga babae. Thanks direk!Napaisip din ako kanina pagkatapos kong mapanood ang Sunshine, na sana in the future ay malegalize na talaga ang aborsyon, and if ito ay malelegalize man ay sana magkaroon din ako ng opportunities to train. Yon lang!",3
Sunshine,"As someone who is not against abortion, this is a must-watch!Wake up, people. Open your eyes. It’s not about killing, and it’s not about breaking the rules of God. It’s about women’s choice.Can we normalize abortion? There are people who become pregnant because of rape, or those who simply do not want or are not ready to have a baby. It’s not the woman’s fault if she chooses to get an abortion—her body, her choice.And to the men: can you all just be responsible? Some of you have the audacity to leave after getting what you want, acting like you have no responsibilities.Hindi masama ang abortion. Kapag ang babae ay hindi pa handa sa kanyang dinadala, may karapatan siyang pumili. Dahil hindi lamang ang babae ang maghihirap, kundi pati ang batang kanyang isisilang.",4
Sunshine,"the most defining moments of sunshine's character lie in the mundane loudness that surrounds her, and the silence she forces to cope with it. paghikbi sa jeep, paghahanap haligi sa avenida inn, at pagsasarili sa gymnasium na naging ikalawang tahanan na. the deafening silence of being bold, unabashed—being a woman who only wants to reach for the stars. this doesn't go on to show that the choices sunshine made were born out of being heartless; but rather the opposite.gets ko na. please do watch this film :) and #legalizeabortion #makeabortionaccessible!",17

Sunshine,"What stayed with me long after the credits rolled is how Sunshine understands the quiet corners of being young. The ones filled with fear you don’t even have language for yet, and the hope you still hold anyway. The film doesn’t chase shock value; instead, it trusts stillness, letting the soft ache of its characters speak for themselves.And then there’s that storyline about the 13-year-old girl, pregnant because of her own uncle. OH GOD. That shattered me. It’s horrifying, devastating, and the film doesn’t sanitize the truth of it. It shows how violence like that hides inside families, how children are left carrying consequences for sins that were never theirs. I felt so much grief and anger for that kid; it’s the kind of scene that makes you sit there and go quiet because it hurts in a very real way. The film’s exploration of choice, shame, and the pressure to “grow up correctly” hits even harder because of moments like that. It never lectures. It simply shows how heavy it is to carry circumstances shaped by adults who should’ve protected you. Maris Racal delivers an immaculate kind of devastation in this role. There’s a sharpness to every look she gives, a trembling truth in every word, that feels painfully real. She breaks open the character’s longing, lets the fear spill out raw, and turns her strength into something that rises slowly from the wreckage. It’s a performance that destroys you and stays spotless in its honesty.Sunshine is the kind of film that lingers. Soft, bruising, furious when it needs to be, and quietly bright in all the places that matter.",-1
Sunshine,FUCK the judicial system here in the philippines. So happy for sunshine and the “gets ko na” part was soo good.,31
Sunshine,"the struggles and pain are def relatable as someone who’s like sunshine. this film showed nothing but reality and how people, society are so fucked up. a movie about abortion wherein it’s illegal in our country is superb. the line “gets mo na ba?” asked by sunshine to the child after being able to perform whole heartedly and the child agreed is ICONIC. #abortionishealthcare",5

Sunshine,"this is so well made; the future kid concept, the multiple perspectives of women w the same problem, the commentary on religion, and the lowkey open ending. i think everyone should watch this. maris racal u deserve all the flowers. ps this is probably the first time i got mad at a piolo pascual character as in minura mura ko sya.",-1

Haixxx nice movie, it takes me back to manila  and ang movie natoh shows how in a fast paced place like manila is wala ka talaga magagawa kundi sumabay talaga sa agos. and I understand na it didn't directly criticize religion but how religion is ignorantly used. That is why niwala rin ako merun dapat mga legal amendments or legal considerations done when it comes to dealing w abortion cases",4

Those who choose to be ignorant towards reality and blindly follow rules that is beneficial for them, and not for others.Imagine how many empowering women lose so many opportunities because somebody told them it was wrong, that their bodies aren't their choice to make and that they are at fault. So many women, in many ages, in many places. Miggy pissed me off the first second I saw him based on how he reacted, and the male doctor. Then again, it was perfect. The movie is perfect. It showed reality.I genuinely love this movie, and I can only hope it's able to change the minds who still stay close-minded. This film is a step towards progress.",7

Sunshine,"sanaol inabort lol anyway, the movie is a good conversation starter. but i do have to point out that, in a way, it’s somewhat hurtful to the advocacy. what i’m talking about is her “unborn child” used as her “conscience”i like that it kind of misleads the viewers into thinking that sunshine might keep her pregnancy. however, turning her “unborn child” into an actual character only gives the viewers an impression that abortion means murder (when we all know for A FACT that it’s not)",5

Sunshine,"A challenging plot to bring to the screen and a harsh and sad reality for many women. The strong hold religion has over the Philippines is especially frustrating. The hospital scene where you would expect empathy from the doctor pissed me off. The pastor and Miggy especially bothered me — Miggy because he’s a little shit and the pastor because his reaction reminded me of my father. Other people can get away with abortion because they have the money so they can just go freely with their lives, but for younger women like Sunshine and Ariana, it’s life or death. Ariana’s situation is especially heavy, something I’ve heard about from people I know. This film is going to bother me for a while.",11
Sunshine,"Sunshine (2024) serves as a powerful and eye-opening film, especially for us Filipinos. As someone working in the healthcare field, I believe the movie highlights an important truth: abortion should not be treated as a taboo subject or inherently immoral. Whether we acknowledge it or not, there are women who do not wish to become pregnant or are not ready to become mothers. Criminalizing abortion does not stop it from happening; it merely drives women toward unsafe procedures that place their lives at greater risk.If one personally identifies as pro-life, then one has the choice not to pursue abortion. However, holding that belief does not grant anyone the authority to dictate or restrict what women can do with their own bodies, especially when they do not contribute to the wellbeing of the child these women may be forced to bear. The health, autonomy, and safety of women must remain our priority. It is time to end the stigma surrounding reproductive choices and to uphold the separation of religion and state in policymaking.",-1

Sunshine,"Ang pelikulang Sunshine ay hindi lang simpleng kwento ng isang babae—isa itong salamin sa maraming isyung matagal nang umiikot sa Pilipinas pero pilit pa ring isinasantabi. Nagawa ng pelikula ito na ilahad ang mga sakit ng sistemang kinabibilangan natin: mula sa pakikibaka ng kababaihan sa kanilang sariling katawan hanggang sa nakakalungkot na estado ng ating healthcare system.Isa sa pinakamalinaw na ipinupukol ng pelikula ay ang isyu ng aborsyon. Ipinapakita ng pelikula kung gaano kahirap ang desisyong hinaharap ng mga kababaihan—lalo na sa bansang halos bawal pag-usapan ang reproductive rights. Nakakahalit dahil hanggang ngayon, marami pa ring kababaihan ang hindi ganap na malaya sa sarili nilang katawan dahil sa malalim na kapit ng konserbatismong relihiyoso. Sa halip na suportahan, hinuhusgahan sila. Sa halip na pakinggan, pinapatahimik. At gaya ng ipinapakita sa pelikula, napipilitang harapin ng mga babae ang mga sitwasyong hindi nila pinili, wala man lang ligtas o legal na option para makaligtas..Kasunod nito, mariing binabangga ng pelikula ang realidad ng ating healthcare system. Hindi na bago ang nakikitang eksena sa ospital: siksikan, kulang sa gamit, at kapos sa espasyo. Dalawa, minsan tatlong ina sa iisang kama—hindi dahil gusto nila, kundi dahil wala talagang mapaglagyan. Ito ang reyalidad na hinaharap ng ordinaryong Pilipino araw-araw, habang ang mga pulitikong may kapangyarihan ay kayang lumipad paabroad para magpagamot sa mas kumpletong pasilidad.Sa kabuuan, nagsilbing boses ang Sunshine para sa mga isyung matagal nang dinidinig ngunit hindi pinakikinggan. Maris Racal did her best one on this. Kudos!",3

Sunshine,PUTANGINAMO TITO BOBOT,-1
Sunshine,"The transparency how the society really is was really good, and applause for that because no one can be that strong to put how our society works. Maris Racal's acting showed the desperation and the dedication for her dreams, it was sad how much she handled all throughout. She is really a great actress and no one can change that. Lastly, the way everything was a real life situation and relatable for people who live nowadays, it was great and FUCK MEN!",25
Sunshine,"This movie was fun to watch in terms of its setting. I have been to the gym Sunshine was training in and also the Rizal Sports Complex because I have trained there before in 2015!Argh, teenage pregnancy in the Philippines stems from the lack of sex education and advocacy for contraceptives and abortion. The fact that we are a mostly Catholic-dominated country or population that strongly adheres to tradition makes it harder for pregnant teenagers to find support. They are made to feel ashamed and helpless because even the law says that abortion is illegal, meaning that they do not have a choice but to deliver the child. Sunshine's passion was found in gymnastics, something that she couldn't let go of. She knew that if she were to become a mother (which she isn't ready for, as she explicitly states during her conversation with Miguel and his father), she would have to surrender everything she has worked hard for. Her sister's situatio, who was a former gymnast as well, basically shows that Sunshine's life would eventually become just like hers if she were to proceed with the pregnancy. The doctor was so annoying because that's exactly how the older generation sounds like when stating their opinions about religion, abortion, and chilbirth.I also liked the fact that they tackled topics like sex, autonomy, rape, and incest. These are very real in the Philippines and the situation with Ariana and his sister (?) greatly displayed how messed up it is. These children have no choice or power over their elders and what makes it sad is that those who should be protecting them are the ones putting them in danger and ruining their lives.I read somewhere that the little girl that followed Sunshine was her unborn child. I also thought of this throughout the movie and it even made more sense when the little girl said ""Gets ko na"" after Sunshine practiced her piece with a passionate smile and aura that could be felt by the audience.I love that Sunshine chose herself and her dreams over being a mother. A child born into this world who would eventually live in substandard conditions just because people say they should be born won't truly experience a life that should be lived.",-1

A very realistic movie. ang ganda ng portrayal ng stigma at discrimination na nararanasan ng mga kababaihang dumadaan sa ganitong situation sa bansa natin. At, sana buksan na ng mga Pilipino ang kanilang isipan at intindihin na ang abortion is healthcare at hindi dapat ituring na uri nang pagpaslang. Also, I appreciate how this movie shows na accessing safe abortion care from clinics is far better than relying on herbal remedies or sa mga faithhealers. And of course, this also shows the effects of our flawed healthcare system, it's inaccessible and expensive, pushing women to resort to those kinds of practices. But, It's important to remember that we have the rights to make a choice about our own bodies, but we should make those choices wisely and safely.",-1

Sunshine,"Ganda. A harrowing, claustrophobic, yet essential sprint across Manila streets. The craft here really shines, at just 90 or so minutes the film feels tightly-paced and confidently crafted through Jadaone's masterful direction, yet it still swings wide over several discussions and thoughts over its major theme in an arguably short amount of time. Mind you there's an element here that I'm not the biggest fan of-- I think the film could have actually eliminated it altogether as it feels inelegant especially against the overt realism of the rest of the film. But otherwise it's easy to overlook this compared to how wise the rest of the film is. It culminates in a truly lovely finale that uses simplicity to great, moving effect, especially when juxtaposed to how much noise and haste the rest of the film's heavy atmosphere is. Gets ko na why ""Gets ko na"" became an easily recognisable, even arguably iconic line from this film.Besides the stellar direction, the rest of the departments here really shine. The camera and production design really stand out here, painting a crowded and cramped world. The performances are simply captivating. Maris Racal truly carries this hefty narrative, but Annika Co really exudes such natural confidence that steals the scene whenever she appears. Ultimately, this really feels like important cinema from simply one of the best Filipino filmmakers out there.",-1
Sunshine,"Sobrang tapang ng pelikulang 'to. Sobrang tapang ni direk tonet. Sobrang tapang ni Sunshine. Sobrang tapang ng mga kababaihang nagpapatuloy, lumalaban sa mga hamon ng lipunan. Dinala ako ng pelikulang 'to sa kung anong klaseng lipunan ang kailangang harapin ng mga kababaihan araw-araw — lahat ng husga, dikta, at pangungurakot. Wala sa kahit anong batas or salita ng diyos ang makatutulong sa mga taong kagaya ni Sunshine, kung 'di ang maayos na health care system, maayos at tapat na gobyerno, at isang mapagpalayang lipunan — malaya sa kahit anong dikta at husga ng mga taong hindi kailanma'y namroblema sa kanilang kaligtasan kapag maglalakad mag-isa sa madilim na kalsada, sa kanilang kasuotan at pananamit, sa kung anong pananaw ng iba sa kanilang katawan, sa kakayahan makapag-luwal ng anak, sa mga tingin at pagnanasa ng mga mabababang-uri, at sa mga marami pang bagay. Napakaraming aspeto ng pelikulang Sunshine ang paulit-ulit sinasampal sa atin para lang magising sa realidad ang bulok na lipunang 'to. Isa na rito ang pagbibigay sa mga kababaihan ang kalayaang mamili, kalayaang magdesisyon, at kalayaang mangarap, kasama ang proteksyon para sa mga batang katulad ni Mary Grace.Ilang kababaihan at bata pa ba ang kinakailangang maranasan ang hirap nina Sunshine at Mary Grace bago mamulat at umusad ang lipunang sakop pa rin ng makalumang pananaw — mga pananaw na hindi nila alam ay unti-unting ginigilitan at pinapatay ang karapatan, kalayaan, at kakayahan ng mga kababaihan. Ang mga taong tulad nina Bobot, nanay ni Mary Grace, at Miggy ang tunay na lumalabag sa sa utos ng diyos, ang tunay na gumagawa ng krimen, at ang tunay sa nagpapabulok pa sa inuuod na sistema para sa mga kababaihan at bata, hindi ang mga taong tulad ni Sunshine na pinanghahawakan ang karapatan nilang mangarap at magkaroon ng desisyon para sa kanilang sariling katawan. Tangina gaano ba kahirap isipin yon?Napakaganda ng cinematography. Lahat ng baho, usok, lagkit, at sikip ng Maynila; lahat ng mga matang mapanghusga, mga taong makasarili, mga komentong nananakal, at bigat na dala-dala araw-araw ng mga babae at bata, lahat ito ipinakita. Ibang klaseng sining ang ipinakita nina direk tonet, maris, jennica, annika, at sa lahat ng cast ng pelikula.Mahigpit na yakap para sa lahat ng Sunshine na patuloy bumabangon at lumalaban. Abante, babae!",3
Sunshine,the world is cruel to women. fuck men!!,7
Sunshine,perfect representation of how trash men can be,22
Sunshine,"This film really reminded me that sometimes even the most seemingly trivial decisions—like whether to use a condom or not by relying on the excuse of pulling out—can have huge effects on one’s life. It also shows how having no access to proper medical care for abortion (since it is illegal) is so unfair, especially for children who were taken advantage of, which leads them to use unsafe methods that put their lives at risk. I really applaud Sunshine’s determination to chase her dreams and stay strong in the face of her friends ignoring her and her boyfriend not wanting to take responsibility for their child. Aside from her, I also applaud her family for staying by her side regardless of what her decision may be. I applaud this film for showing the hardships of being a woman—specifically, a woman in the Philippines—surrounded by noise, distractions, and judgment.",5
Sunshine,not the pastor kid,16
Sunshine,"""Naiintindihan mo na?""""Gets ko na.""Whenever somebody asks me why I support abortion, I will ask them to watch this film—especially now that it is widely accessible through Netflix. The ability to choose for a woman's own welfare and decide for the future of a child is a fundamental right, it should never be a debate. Bodily autonomy is a human right. We can use religious morals as a basis to weigh the decision but NEVER force it on somebody and leverage that same bullshit to guilt-trip them. Safe-sex should be promoted not shushed by religious parties; accessible care for abortion should be a must We shouldn't demonize doctors and women who want that for themselves. Like the line, ""Flush out the noise"", these unneeded external noises should never be heard in the first place, all throughout the film it catches up to Sunshine. Hangang, hanga, ako sa'yo Sunshine. Dreams should never be impeded because of a mistake, she's still a teen who's transitioning to adulthood. She should be allowed to live her life not being worried about a child she never wanted in the first place. And to all the women out there, who's met with arguably stronger hostility, I hope that laws, people, the Philippines becomes more friendly to you. It should be like that. I never doubted Maris Racal's ability to act, and all I can say is they found jackpot by casting her as Sunshine and casting Annika as the little girl that appears all throughout the film. P.S. that Uncle deserved so much more than breaking a bottle on their head.",5

Sunshine,"A disturbingly realistic film that tackles on the disadvantages of living in a country that criminalizes abortion—discouraging women’s bodily autonomy and integrity, huge risks on women’s reproductive health, and so on.It is a dark cinematic film that does not only impress one with its amazing visuals and role portrayal from the cast lineup, but also leaves you pondering on the bold message it screams throughout.",5
Sunshine,"Maris Racal is ready for leading roles, and Sunshine gives her everything to work with. It helps that a stellar ensemble of women round out the supporting roles too, with Annika Co haunting her like an undeniable reality. Its plot, certainly a conversation-starter, doesn't all the way succeed with all its creative choices, but it's welcome forward motion for showing that women's choices command respect even if it doesn't fit the ones you decide for yourself. Another thing everyone should agree on is that Antoinette Jadaone has her finger on the pulse of what Filipinos, and the cinephile-going population of the country, need to discuss.",25
Sunshine,"hayst ang hirap panoorin :( when you work in healthcare and you know andaming may kwento katulad ni sunshine at mary graceat sana darating rin ang panahon na ang karamihan ay makakasabi ng ""gets ko na""",3
Sunshine,"“usapang bata to!””bakit? bata rin naman ako!”a striking detail that struck me the most is the contrast between the very first time we watch sunshine step onto the mat and the last time she ever does. at first, you hear this deep and intense noise of her drowning the music, her choach’s instructions, and even the sound of her own breathing. and the noise only goes louder and harsher each time we see her practice her routine while she quietly endures the devastating ordeal of attempting to terminate her pregnancy. what started off as a sound to describe her pressure and desperation to reach her olympic dreams, now becomes the sound of her fear, her secrecy, and her grief. this says so much about what it means to be a woman in the philippines: how suffering must be hidden, how autonomy becomes something to apologize for, and how you’re expected to quietly tend to your own wounds you never asked to carry.and sunshine carries her decision with guilt, so much that she looks at the unnamed young girl like she’s staring at every version of her future that never got the chance to choose. but she dreams. she dreams so much. and she dreams for more. and she stands firm, because what’s so wrong about wanting a life that belongs to her? what’s so wrong about refusing to be swallowed by sacrifice? what’s so wrong about refusing to become another woman she didn’t want to be?“gets ko na.”so as we see the last time she practices on the mat, we finally hear the sound of the music, not the deep sound of pressure of fear, but a rhythm that finally belongs to her. the gymnasium is dark, she’s alone and she’s pale, but this is the brightest she has ever looked in the past hour i’ve watched the film. she moves with a softness that feels earnest, like this is the first time her body isn’t performing to impress or survive, only to exist. she dances gracefully, probably the most she ever has, and it’s a moment that shows us that she has unapologetically reclaimed something no one ever thought she deserved: the right to choose herself. and for the first time, she is no longer a girl she’s afraid to be—she is a woman who has already decided.i hope more people watch sunshine (2024) not to criticize women with early and unintended pregnancies, but to meet them with grace and empathy for their fears, their confusion, and their fight to claim what should have always been theirs in the first place—their autonomy, dignity, and right to have access to healthcare without being made to beg for it.patuloy nating pahalagahan ang kalusugan, karapatan, at mga kwento ng kababaihan minus half star kasi parang kaya pa natin i-improve yung dialogues, direk?? HAHAHAHAH also sino ba agent ni elijah canlas bakit parang kalhati na ng roles nya may nabubuntis sha ",-1
Sunshine,"Philippine cinema is not dead and Sunshine is a living proof of it. this film has so much emotional depth and thought-provoking scenes that captures perfectly what it feels like to be a woman living in a patriarchal society- in a country where hypocrisy runs rampant and making decisions for yourself is often frowned upon. why is it that women are the ones always blamed, shackled and punished for choices they make- choices driven by the need to prioritize their health and safety in situations they did not fully create? Antoinette Jadaone's best film yet so far, and i'd say it because of its boldness, for addressing an elephant, a taboo topic that most of us are not ready to talk about, but eventually we must. it's already hard enough that we don't have proper access to healthcare, even worse to be scrutinized by society simply for choosing yourself.",-1
Sunshine,woah tangina lupet,19
Sunshine,"Agree with prof cuartero who said that people who write would not appreciate sunshine. Employing the child character as a form of her unborn child is tasteless, it once more reinforces the very discussion surrounding women’s autonomy over their pregnancy—a life is not born the moment that it’s conceived. We should not treat it as such, and must move forward without having to empathize with centuries old rhetorics about women’s body that really falls back into bioessentialist dogma. This seems like a film that is afraid to insult the very audience it is intended for.",-1

Sunshine,“Gets ko na”Pero ang lutong nang mga mura,-1
Sunshine,"”Ay nako! Talaga naman ang mga kabataan ngayon hindi na makapagpigil.”Throughout Sunshine, there are several adult figures that do not listen to Sunshine, blinded by either their convictions or Filipino societal norms. They push Sunshine on what she must do: pray, seek forgiveness, give the baby a life, be a mom, and pray. In the adults’ eyes, Sunshine is not a nineteen-year-old Filipina in Manila going to school and practice. To the adults, Sunshine is already a mom.On Saturday, the Filipino noontime show It’s Showtime invited parents with 7 or more children for their game Laro, Laro, Pick. A majority of the contestants were women, and two of the mothers interviewed, Elsa and Rosalie, had 15 and 8 children respectively. Elsa, the 63-year-old woman with 12 living children and 3 deceased children recited the ages of her 12 children from the oldest, 46, to the youngest, 24. The gap between the older ones is 1-2 years apart, while the younger ones are about 2-3 years apart. Elsa confesses how difficult life is for her and her children, spouting how without God she would not be as strong as she is today, living off 300 pesos everyday. When Vice Ganda asked Elsa why she has so many children, Elsa plainly said, “Ehhh di ako marunong mag family planning eh,” inciting some laughter in the audience. Elsa even revealed that the father was absent and had a different family, leaving the Filipina mother and her 12 living children to figure out how to live.The second woman, Rosalie, with 8 children echoed the same sentiments as Elsa. She sells sampaguita every day with no days off at the age of 60 something; her children married and had their children early; the highest level of schooling one of her children attained was high school, but never graduated; her children sell sampaguita with no days off; and she has 19 grandchildren to look after in a home with no roof above their heads.What Sunshine, Elsa, and Rosalie have in common is how the patriarchy confines them to suffocating religious ideals, a corrupt and conservative government, and poor healthcare. What Sunshine does not have in common with the two women is the ignorance in family planning. Sunshine is no one's mother! It should never be a reason to have 7 or more children at an early age, with no means of support financially and emotionally, because it is ""God's gift,"" or because they simply want to experience having children. The favorite catchphrase, ""Kase malakas ako, kaya ko to"" can only thrive for so long with honesty until oppressors abuse the Filipina determination. Access to sexual education MUST be a right, not a privilege nor a taboo subject. Children do not decide when they want to be born, so there should be conscious efforts to assess if the environment people live in can secure their children's/childrens' future(s), especially in a country like the Philippines. Unfortunately, there are connections to poverty and the lack of interest and access to proper education. There is also the inability for Filipinos in poverty to seek other options, or have the real agency to pursue aspirations. While there is such thing as being irresponsible, Filipino women are a laughingstock in conversations surrounding teen pregnancy and reproductive rights—when realistically—they should have the choice to protect themselves, but are instead ruthlessly flayed off by the very system that commands kindness.[Minor spoilers ahead]Annika Co manifests herself as (what I think) Sunshine's Catholic guilt. We first meet Annika after Sunshine prays outside of Quiapo Church and is about to light a cigarette. Annika appears whenever Sunshine does something that will affect the fetus, and often berates Sunshine for being ""bad."" At first, I was hesitant towards the idea of Annika representing Sunshine's potential child, because it can mistakenly support the pro-life argument of murder (which Annika actually yells at Sunshine), until Annika says, ""ang pangarap ko ay pangarap niya."" SOBRANG bigat yung line na yan! In a sense, Sunshine and Annika are the same person. Sunshine should be able to pursue her dreams successfully the same way Annika, along with other living and future children, should feel secure enough to be ambitious. The message further builds itself with Ariana, Annika's friend and the 13-year-old girl's potential child. Ariana wants to be the first gay president, but how can they do that in an environment with a r*pist, a neglectful grandmother, and a KID whose choice was stolen?If mothers like Elsa and Rosalie can somehow ""get away"" with no family planning, how can Sunshine and the 13-year-old girl survive in a Catholic Philippines? The Reproductive Health Law was passed in December 2012, and efforts to educate the masses and distribute contraceptives have improved, yet there is still a high percentage of unintended pregnancies, AIDS rates, and JUSKO PO—ISSUES WITH BUDGETING (source 1),(source 2) !!!!!! The Philippines will never progress as a nation if objectivity is blocked by the grip the church and the state have on one another, which ultimately and consistently harms Filipinas who give their best yesterday, today, and tomorrow.I am certain that Sunshine is not the first film to be unapologetically bold and loud for the Filipina, but it is certainly the first to make rounds among the casual movie-goers and the general Filipino. It is not a perfect film and such flawed instances are where:- the narrative of Sunshine being an Olympic-level athlete clashes with the lack of popularity shown outside of practice- the cinematography is poetic without a doubt, but the scenes of Sunshine messaging her Coach, Miggy, and Thea isn't synchronized with Sunshine typing on the phone/isn't even her actually texting. If you're going to place emphasis on the quietest scenes, I believe that something as minor as texting should be clean (this was the same quip I had with the controller scene in Anora like c'mon now....)- the cinematography can be too poetic. for example, the shot of Sunshine looking out of her hotel window with the Metro Manila noise juxtaposing her quiet turmoil contributes to Sunshine purposely not drowning out the noise (or the failure to?), but I found it unnecessary because right after she woke up in pain. the juxtaposition felt like it was purely for aesthetics- the Jojo Rabbit esque character of Annika and Ariana was VERY risky (re: pro-life arguments)- maybe it's just me but the film gives you some breathers with comedic aspects in things like ""no bad words"" and Annika proceeding to say ""putangina"" which I found myself like ""damn girl ! ! !"" though it makes me wonder if those who do not share the same ideals as me laughed at it the same way the audience laughed at Elsa in Laro Laro Pick. In a not long-winding way, and assuming negatively, if tonal shifts struck the audience as a serious matter and not a reactionary narrative.- the last 3 paragraphs of this review regarding how art can effectively stand by its purposeAng hirap maging isang Sunshine sa Pilipinas, at hindi pinaguusapan kahit eto ang reality ng karamihan ng babae at batang babae. Women can dream for themselves. Women can learn to protect for themselves if there are resources available by sources that make themselves available. Women are strong, but you cannot glorify them to always be strong at the expense of exploitation. Sunshine is many of the first steps in Philippine cinema that can continue the conversation. I hope the film incites action in Filipinos to call out the current and future administration, who, under the guise of a devotee to a forgiving religion, perpetuates being uncritical and whose laziness is a disservice to the Filipino people. And most importantly, may Filipinos denounce the administration's vigor in committing violence against them, and reclaim the autonomy all Filipinos are born with.",12
Sunshine,"so important, so phenomenal, maris racal they can never make me hate you!",2
Sunshine,I wish this country is kinder to our young women.Also grabe mga symbolism ha? Lots of shots making it look like Sunshine is caged or imprisoned. An abortion pill being sold outside the church. The political commentary (how the government fucks us everyday and how our healthcare is bad). Basta. Ugh made me frustrated that the people in a position of power were refusing to help (but the film also made a point that there were good samaritans)! Sad!,5

Sunshine,"I know this movie feels heavy and complicated the first time you watch it. It’s about a girl who is struggling against the world and against herself. She loses her way, and she could lose her dreams if she doesn’t stand up to the world.From this movie, I learned one important thing in life, everyone has their own problems, different kinds of problems. But the important thing is what you choose to do when you’re going through something difficult and nobody is there to help you. Even when you feel alone, useless, or hopeless, don’t give up. You can still reach what you want and chase your dreams. Just keep going and keep fighting.As a man, I feel sorry for Sunshine, but believe me, there are many good men in this world better than selfish and stupid men and I learned from this movie how to be a better man. Use protection when you’re doing something intimate, and if you don’t, make sure you can take responsibility for your actions. Live wisely and don’t make rushed decisions. Every choice you make shapes your future. We may not regret our actions in the moment, but we regret them later.And for other men, I want to say this if you have a girlfriend, make sure she’s happy with you. Don’t be rude to her, and don’t ruin her life because of your desires. As a man, I promise myself that I'll be better. I’ll treat women with respect, and I'll never raise my hand when we have problems or arguments.",-1

Sunshine,"kababaihan nga ba ang kanilang pinoprotektahan, o ang sariling takot na mawalan ng kontrol sa buhay ng kababaihan?sobrang ironic lang na ang simbahan at ang kanilang pananampalataya ang itinuturing na pinakamalaking hadlang sa pag-legalize ng abortion sa ating bansa. pero sa mismong labas ng kanilang pintuan, makikita mismo ang serbisyong pilit nilang ipinagbabawal. minsan katabi pa nga ng mga santong sinasamba nila.kung ganoon katibay ang kanilang pagtutol, bakit hindi nila mapigil ang realidad na nasa harap nila?dahil sa hindi pagtanggap sa aborsyon, maraming kababaihan ang napipilitang gumamit ng hindi ligtas na pamamaraan, na naglalagay sa kanila sa kapahamakan.kung ang ipinaglalaban ng kanilang moralidad ay “proteksyon ng buhay,” bakit parang hindi kasama sa buhay na iyon ang mismong babaeng nagbubuntis? bakit ang potensyal na buhay ang pinapahalagahan, pero ang buhay na humihinga, nagdurusa, at nalalagay sa panganib ay tila pangalawa lamang—o minsan, hindi man lang isinasama sa usapan?hindi kayang resolbahin ng moral absolutism ang totoong problema. ang kababaihan ang nagbabayad ng presyo—hindi ang simbahan, hindi ang mga pulitiko, at hindi ang mga taong nagtatakda ng mga patakaran na kailanman ay hindi nila mararanasan sa sarili nilang katawan.ang karapatan sa sariling katawan ay hindi dapat ipinaglalaban sa husgado ng relihiyon o pulitika. ito ay desisyon na dapat ibalik sa taong may katawan, may buhay, at may tunay na pinansyal, emosyonal, at pisikal na pasanin.",3

Sunshine,"I love how it turned out! I like Maris so much, she genuinely delivered the story like as if it's really her!! I like also the plot twists! This film deserves more recognition.",-1
Sunshine,one of those films that will turn women into even bigger misandrists than they already are (no man should be offended by this if he’s a real one) and make men realise how privileged we actually are that we don’t need to give up on our dreams and ambitions just because of the expectations of raising a child we didn’t ask for. i will forever be pro-choice and each and every man should be one because we should never have any say in what women do with their bodies when we have all the privilege to ignore their hardships and turn a blind eye to them so the least we could do is respect it when a woman doesn’t want to go through 9 months of turmoil. praying that the women of the phillipines get to see a day their country legalises abortion as soon as possible,34

Haha, kudos kay Direk Tonet, and ang galing ni Maris!",6
Sunshine,"It showed something that is still considered taboo, not being scared of showing the realities of the desperation, humiliation, struggles, and one's dream slipping off.It did not just show one perspective but multiple, which will really make you think about the implications that come along these kinds of situations.Honestly, a great film. I do think more people need to see it.",23
Sunshine,"10/10 acting & story telling. sobrang brave netong pelikula na to considering sagradong katoliko parin talaga ang karamihan sa mga pinoy. I love Sunshine and her ate so much. sobrang gigil ako dun sa doktorang pinahiya siya in front of everyone. I'm glad her ate stepped in. She's such a strong female character and I love the subtlety in which they showed it in the movie. nanay siya pero never niya pinafeel sa kapatid niya na dapat i-keep ni Sunshine yung bata dahil lang siya kineep niya yung kanya. pinakita rin na kadalasan talaga kapwa babae ang tutulong sayo, sad reality kahit na dapat may katuwang ka in the form of a partner (the one who knocked you up in the first place), it's always women helping other women- even in situations where they themselves don't have much (the maternity ward scene, just a whole community of mothers caring for each other) and even when they have issues of their own (Sunshine helping out the younger girl that was also pregnant all while dealing with her own pregnancy) the 13 year old girl who was revealed to have been GAY and a victim of her uncle's story was very impactful. nakakalungkot na yun ang realidad ng karamihan sa mga batang babae sa bansa. abuse is so normalized and looked over, especially in marginalized areas. that's why we need more Dra Helenas in the world. I hope philippine cinema gets to produce more films like this para mapukaw ang isip at damdamin ng karamihan.",-1
Sunshine,"What a way to end November. Tapos na pero umiiyak pa rin ako. I miss my mom, and I completely understand her if she didn't have me. I like how this film show that kind of perspective, na nakikita ng future child mo yung situation mo right now.

Sunshine,"Sunshine told a well-rounded story on abortion in the Philippines, and how the lack of safe options for women disproportionately affects those in vulnerable positions even . The ""ayoko maging nanay"" line toward the end, when Sunshine met her ex's father, was so powerful to me. Because she's making a choice that men do so easily, and it shows how much women need to have that option, too, specifically SAFE ones. ""What if the baby can cure cancer? Blah blah…",-1
Sunshine,"worth watching fr! i love all the subtle scenes — like sa jeep na may “gift of god” sa harap, the super makadiyos billboards, every convo with annika and her gay friend (ariana), and yung scenes na kahit nasa crowd siya, you still notice her. alam mo yun, kahit sobrang simple at halos walang make-up, she still shines. And the cinematography is a solid 10 out of 10.this movie shows how cruel the system is for women in general. with a patriarchal society and a conservative country, talagang “jackpot” maging babae. it also highlights how badly we need proper sex education and why decriminalizing abortion should be pushed hard!gigil ako dun sa hayop na bobot, yung unang doctora na super pabida, at siyempre special mention kay miggy at sa pastor niyang tatay.overall, this movie hit me in a way na kahit hindi ako in sunshine’s situation, ramdam ko pa rin. as a woman, it just made me realize again how much we deal with. it’s not just a good movie it’s the type na kahit okay ka naman, pero pag may sad song, bigla kang nagrereflect. that’s exactly the energy it gave me. kudos to the director, and of course maris, who always gives justice to every character.",-1

Lahat ng detalye, mula sa ilaw hanggang sa pagbitbit ng emosyon, ramdam mong dinisenyo para ipadama ang bigat ng isang desisyong hindi kailanman naging madali. Napakagaling mo, Maris Racal. Isa ka pa, Annika Co! Putangina bata ka ba talaga???",3
Sunshine,"what a strong cast — especially Maris. Jennica shined in the second part of the movie :) i appreciate how this movie has started conversations revolving abortion in the PH. when Sunshine was frantically searching for underground abortion solutions, it was really saddening. women should not have to turn to dangerous options just to choose what they want to do with their body. however, i really could not wrap my head around the “child” in the movie… i know she’s…",-1

Sunshine,very important work.,1
Sunshine,"This is truly one of the best Filipino films this year. It takes courage to empower abortion and women’s rights in a country that has been conservative and patriarchal for the longest time. I really really loved how the film doesn’t shy away from unraveling the realities of a Filipino woman. The crowded and unorganized public hospitals, the irony of churches and black markets, and the innate nature of self-righteous men trying to dictate a woman’s life. There should be more movies like this marketed to the mainstream media. Looking forward to Maris’ future projects, galing niya as always!",13
Sunshine,"i want to say a lot of things about this movie pero ang hirap niya i-form into words. pero una sa lahat, i love this film. umpisa palang, ang bigat na sa feeling manuod. siguro kasi i’ve been to those places? na it felt too real. lahat ng sulok na dinaanan ni sunshine at mga lugar na tinakbuhan niya, parang nandon lang din ako. i know some will say na maling desisyon yung mga ginawa ni sunshine pero ano na bang pwede niyang gawin? sa bansang walang maayos at ligtas na healthcare para sa mga kababaihan, saan pa siya lalapit? kahit nung dinala siya sa ospital dahil sa epekto nung pampalaglag, hinusgahan pa siya. ganyan ang estado ng healthcare ng mga kababaihan dito sa bansang to. i love the “what should have been her daughter” na character na sinusundan si sunshine sa bawat sulok ng maynila. alam natin sa umpisa palang na ayaw ni sunshine maging nanay at gagawa siya ng paraan para magpalaglag. pero hindi parin mawawala yung parang “guilt” na meron ang isang babae lalo na’t lumaki tayo sa katolikong bansa. kita rin ito dun sa pagpunta ni sunshine sa simbahan tuwing dumadaan siya sa quiapo. mahirap siguro hindi isipin ang mga “what ifs” pero kung hindi handa ang isang babae maging nanay, hindi siya handa. dapat ganun lang kadali. i also like how they added the side story of mary grace. kasi totoo naman. ano ang gagawin ng isang babae (at sa lagay ni mary grace na 13 palang) kapag ni-r*pe siya ng tito niya? hindi kailanman magiging handa maging ina ang labintatlong gulang na bata lalo na’t bunga ito ng abuse sa bahay. also ang galing ni maris! sobrang husay niya sa pelikulang ito. kahit yung mga mata-mata acting lang, damang dama ko. you can say anything you want about maris pero no one can say anything bad when it comes to her as an actress. ang dami ko pang naiisip and i think i need days to reflect and form my thoughts pero ang masasabi ko ay we needed a movie like this sa pinas. kailangan talaga marinig ang mga kwento gaya ni sunshine (at ni mary grace).",6

Sunshine,ang ganda kasi tlga puta,1
Sunshine,"“Gets ko na.”In a country like the Philippines, where everyone has an opinion on your body except you, this film hits a nerve that’s been aching for a long time. The way the film shows her struggle, the shame, the fear, the judgment, the dreams she’s forced to postpone, feels like a mirror held up to countless Filipina girls who had to grow up too fast. You can feel how her choices are never just hers; they’re tied to religion, family, and the weight of “dapat” at “bawal.”But what makes Sunshine beautiful is how it refuses to punish her for wanting more. For wanting herself.When she finally chooses her dreams, finally chooses herself and it doesn’t feel selfish. It feels like survival. Like finally stepping out of a shadow she never asked to stand under.This is a reminder that a woman’s future shouldn’t be treated like a sin.And that the sun doesn’t ask permission to shine… it just does.The best Filipino Film of 2025.",-1

Sunshine,"Ayokong maging nanay! Ano bang pakielam nyo?!Followed by her Ate's support is what every young woman's response to people trying to dictate what to do with her body. not when she's not ready, not whenever. In this world, we need an ate like her, Dok Helena, and ate pharmacist who completely shows support no matter what her decisions, does not have malicious mindset and judgmental tendencies. Sunshine reflects the reality all young women face, the struggles of being a woman in a religious third world country and it is so brave to create this kind of film, so kudos to Direk Antonette Jadaone, Maris Racal, and to everyone behind this. Sunshine's bravery for fighting for what she wants, her exercising her rights, and her choices are what young women of today should follow. It is important to see how women who plan to abort or did abort are NOT completely cruel nor sinners, as they also have a conscience and dilemma as they go through every consideration. Her conscience, being represented by ""bata,"" goes to show how she considered having her, but of course it all just boils down to her body, her choices, and her future. And the rights to have access in safe abortions does NOT only applies to rape victims but all WOMEN. ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE. AND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS HUMAN RIGHTS. Sunshine showed how hard it is to receive health care in the philippines; that we resort to what is accessible even if it meant danger for herself. This is sad but this is reality. We need more films like this!!!",-1

This hits harder because I’ve had patients just like the women in this film. Sunshines and Menggays, girls shackled by laws that were never built to protect them. Meanwhile, the men who put them there get to walk away.I hope we evolve, instead of clinging to outdated, patriarchal laws disguised as devotion. We deserve better.",28

Felt like a wasted opportunity to have Maris Racal be the lead but without a real plot to actually steer. Was it a censorship issue?? I don't understand why they would choose such a topic and not really have a stance on it. Maybe the creators themselves are also confused as to being pro-choice or pro-life, as are most Filipinos due to their religious beliefs (I'm assuming). I'm just saying, if you didn't want to get ""too"" political by having a clearer opinion in the film, then it's probably best to take more time and do more research about the topic, or just make another kind of movie.",-1

Sunshine,"it's no surprise to me that a lot of filipinos will misunderstand the whole point and premise of this movie. ang pagb-buntis ng maaga ay madalas nakikita lamang bilang topic ng chismis ng marami kaya di na ko nagulat na madami ang di nakakaintindi sa istorya ni sunshine. i love the inclusion of mary grace in the story, it's a bleak reminder that the women who want and need to get abortions aren't always the stereotyped madonna who's into casual sex,(granted women shouldn't have to fit into a ""perfect victim"" image just to be granted bodily autonomy) but they are also minors who were victims of rape from family members. mary grace's story adds so much to how deeply the film tackles the conversation around abortion as well as making it known to the audience that abortion is not a black and white subject. additionally, it also does a good job in portraying the role of men in these women's lives as well as how little guilt they shoulder from something they also took part in. sobrang little ng guilt at remorse na nararamdaman nila miggy at yung tito ni mary grace. the fact that miggy was only able to help and apologize to sunshine when his father was involved was so putangina. if male audacity had a poster child it would be him. never fucking trust a man (period) who says his ""pull out"" game is strong, especially if that motherfucker is named miggy and talks like he consumes red pill content on the daily.",13

Sunshine,sorry po papa god,16
Sunshine,"what hit me the most was how the film shows society’s pressure without ever yelling at you. the judgement, the shame, the rules you’re supposed to follow — it’s all there, always in the background, shaping every choice she makes. but then there are these tiny moments of kindness, little glimmers of hope, and it’s those moments that make the sadness bearableyou really feel her pain, her confusion, her stubborn spark to survive and keep dreaming, even when everything seems against her. and the story doesn’t give you easy answers — it just lets you sit with the reality of what it’s like to be a girl in a world that doesn’t make it easypero na-realize ko na the girl who follows sunshine and calls her “murderer” is not a real person. she represents the harsh judgment sunshine feels from others and the guilt she carries inside herself. the girl is basically the voice of society telling sunshine she did something wrong, even when the situation is more complicated. she’s also sunshine’s own fear and self-blame turned into a person. in short, the girl is the symbol of the guilt and pressure that keep haunting sunshineyung nasa jeep scene fav ko kasi pinakita na how overwhelmed sunshine is without her having to say a word. while she’s sitting in the jeep, everything around her feels loud, messy, and fast—parang tuloy-tuloy yung mundo habang siya, nakastuck. when she starts crying quietly, it shows how much she’s been holding in for so long",-1

GRABE. sunshine, with her ribbon, was able to be free on the mat. now, clad in her shimmering pink and purple bedazzled spandex, she walks out with the brightest smile in her force and, like the ribbon she’s been acquainted with since childhood, is finally able to take control of her own life.

Sunshine,"Putangina, hanggang ngayon, ang daming lalaking nag-aakalang may karapatan silang magpasya para sa katawan ng babae. What stays with you long after Sunshine ends is how the film treats every moment as something pulled straight from real Filipino girlhood. You see it in the small, mundane ways Sunshine tries to keep herself together like the way she tightens her jaw during training to hide the panic creeping up her spine, how she forces a neutral expression when adults around her throw judgment disguised as concern and the humiliation of realizing everyone expects her to handle a crisis she never chose.Girls grow up by being punished for becoming women. Sunshine is still a teenager, but the moment her pregnancy becomes known, people start talking to her like she owes them maturity, penance, and accountability she was never taught to carry.When Pastor Jaime steps in, offering moral pressure, you can feel the room closing in on her again. Everyone wants her to be a mother. Everyone thinks they have the right to her future. Despite all that pressure, Sunshine’s refusal hits like a rupture in a system built to control her.",-1

Sunshine,"[ system log : 001 ]user : haziah | age : 23status : active // processingI liked Sunshine because it speaks volumes about the lack of real sex education among teenagers—how so many are left to navigate consequences without ever being given proper knowledge, guidance, or protection. It shows how quickly people are forced into rigid sides—pro-choice or pro-life—without being allowed the space to exist as confused, scared, and human first. I didn’t like it only because Maris Racal’s acting was phenomenal—raw, restrained, and painfully real—but because the film chose to center understanding instead of judgment. It didn’t sensationalize the situation; it made you sit with it.I liked it because it treated the experience as what it truly is: a life-altering moment that cannot be simplified into slogans, morals, or online arguments. It showed how heavy one decision can feel when the world is already crashing down on you. I liked it because it refuses to make the audience comfortable. It doesn’t beg for sympathy, it doesn’t chase approval, and it doesn’t try to make itself digestible for everyone.And most of all, I liked it because it never tells you what the “right” answer is. It simply lays everything bare and lets you face it on your own. It allows you to choose what to feel, what to believe, and what to carry after the credits roll.Some people say it lacked something—especially in its length—that it should’ve been longer, that it ended too soon. But I don’t agree. I think it had to end exactly where it did. Because some stories aren’t meant to be over-explained. Some experiences don’t offer neat closures. The ending didn’t feel incomplete to me—it felt honest.",-1

Sunshine,apat na beses ko na 'to pinanood pero lagi ko limot i-review basta love you direk tonet [pinanood ko with my bf],0
Sunshine,This brings me so many emotions. Kudos to the director and writer for making this movie. Sana maging eye opener to sa maraming tao. Women’s business should only be theirs and theirs to make decisions. Buhay ng mga babae ang mag iiba at maapektuhan. Not everyone’s dream is to settle down and be a mother. I hope movies like this can be produced more.,30
Sunshine,"choosing motherhood is noble, but so is pursuing ur dream. such a refreshing take for a Filipino film.",-1

Sunshine,my chest is so heavy after watching this ohmygod,1
Sunshine,don't say bad words,-1
Sunshine,"sunshine is that kind of film na akala mo light lang, pero unti-unti ka palang hinihiwa sa tahimik. maris racal absolutely devoured this role — raw, awkward, fragile, and painfully real. jadaone’s direction hits that perfect balance between humor and heartbreak, yung tipong tatawa ka pero may kurot sa dibdib after.it captures the kind of loneliness na hindi dramatic, just… human. the kind that sits with you sa jeep pauwi. honestly, one of the most honest portrayals of early-20s confusion and self-worth spiral.grabe. ang sakit. ang ganda. ang totoo.would rewatch and ruin my mood again tbh",-1
Sunshine,All throughout the movie girls help girls. Tangina ni isang lalaki sa movie walang kwenta e pare-parehas gago,-1

Sunshine,"grabe, yung setting ng pelikula okay lalo na yung pag capture na sa Manila pa talaga, dama mo talaga eh pero grabe talaga yung mga lalaki na handang umano ng mga babae na akala mo sa una kaya buhayin ganto ganiyan pero pag nasa harapan na nila biglang huwag na? grabe lang yung baba ng tingin ng ganitong mga lalaki sa mga kababaihan, kadiri kumbaga! lalo na yung sa tito? grabe sobrabg kadiri trese anyos lang, pero ayun so far maganda yung movie and how it speaks sa mga ganito rin yung pinagdaanan",-1

Sunshine,impact was impacted -- watched this with my mama!,-1
Sunshine,The film served its purpose by ending it the way they did.Bottomline: Ang hirap maging babae.,39
Sunshine,"Ayoko maging nanay. Hindi ko ipapanganak 'to dahil di ako ready maging nanay.Say it with me now, abortion is women's health care !! That's it. It's that easy. I also recommend the film ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" by Eliza Hittman.",-1
Sunshine,Dito mo po makikita kung gaano ka fucked up ang system sa Pilipinas at gaano sobra nakakahiya ang mga LALAKI.,0
Sunshine,hays tayong mga babae lang talaga magtutulungan. FUUUUUUCK MEN,1
Sunshine,"iba pa rin talaga pag nakikita mo kung hanggang saan yung extremities ng sobrang gagong sistema. isipin mo, kailangan mo talagang umabot sa point na mamamatay ka mapa-abort lang yung bata na di mo ginusto. tangina lang. sobrang nakakagalit na ganon yung process na need pagdaanan ng mga babae. mas naramdaman ko dito yung galit sa mga gumagawa ng batas na walang pakialam sa health concerns ng mga kababaihan. tangina rin ng mga catholic shits na puro bible lang alam di man lang makiramdam kung anong tunay na nagyayari sa mundo. parang wala talagang balak makinig, masunod lang nasa bible eh. na para namang di pili yung pinagkukuha nilang principle don? HAYST. sobrang grabe pa na ngayon lang nagkaron ng portrayal ng ganitong nangyayari sa bansa? yung mga nasa laylayan lang kasi talaga nakaka-experience ng ganito. kapag mayaman ka, pwede ka lumipad ng ibang bansa para makapag-paabort (i think?) pero pag mahirap mamatay ka muna talaga sa procedure. sobrang nakakagalit lang kung ano yung nangayayari. at isa pang nakakagalit is kung gano pa tayo kalayo sa progress. ni-reproductive health nga pinagdadamot eh. parang gago talaga.",3
Sunshine,"ang hirap maging pilipino, PUTANGINA.i don't think there's anything more i could say that hasn't been stated yet. gets ko, GAGO. nakakagago maging pilipino. i haven't watched a film that felt more human than this. gumising na kayo, hayaan niyo kaming mangarap nang buong buo.",6
Sunshine,"sana sa susunod na mga taon hindi na natin kailangan humingi ng tawad para iligtas ang mga pangarap natin. hindi na tayo susubok ng kung ano-ano mula sa twitter at facebook. hindi na tayo magpapanggap na para sa kaibigan natin ang bibilhin. hindi na natin kailangan sumubok ng mga nakamamatay na gamot. hindi na tayo magccheck in pa sa kung saan para lang gawin ang kailangan. sana sa susunod na mga taon ay bukas ang pinto ng mga hospital para sa kinabukasan nating mga kababaihan. hindi nila tayo mamatahin at gagamitin ang bibliya para ikulong ka sa buhay na hindi ka handa. sana maging ligtas na para satin ang abortion—hindi sa banyo ng isang motel, hindi mula sa timeline sa twitter, at hindi tig-3,500 sa tapat ng quiapo church. at higit sa lahat, sana maturuan tayo nang tama—mula sa bahay hanggang sa eskwelahan.AT TANGINAMO BOBOT GAGU KAAAAAAA",3

Sunshine,"""naiintindihan mo ba ako?""Sunshine, at its core, is a film that aims to make the people who watch truly understand. hopefully to also change minds but for that to happen, dapat maintindihan muna kung bakit. and in the spectrum of making films that want to make people listen, Sunshine sits perfectly in the middle. hindi masyadong dinikta yung mensahe to the point that it may be a bit too ""preachy"" kahit walang substance, pero hindi rin nasobrahan sa spectacle at drama at kinulang sa tapang to the point that the message gets blurred. this was a very well executed show and not tell, and show it did.plus everyone was just soooo good. ang husay ng pag arte ng lahat. maris, jennica, annika???? ang husay. no acting to take you out of the scene, no lines to remind you that you're watching a film aiming to be a commercial success (which is a pinoy movie disease, the infamous hugot line syndrome)simple lang. the story was straightforward. it knew what it wanted to tell and it delivered. the topic was handled with care without shying away from the heaviness of it. visually stunning, i love seeing manila filmed as it is and have it be a setting that adds to the storytelling. technically admirable, without losing the heart to tell the story. ms tonet jadaone you've won me over once again. balik nanaman ako sa good side mo po ms jadaone po. please don't stop making pinoy movies tnx po",-1
Sunshine,"Women are born with pain built-in. It's our physical destiny: period pains, sore boobs, childbirth, you know. We carry it within ourselves throughout our lives; men don’t. They have to seek it out. They invent all these gods and demons and things, just so they can feel guilty about things, which is something we do very well on our own. And then they create wars, so they can feel things and touch each other. And when there aren’t any wars, they can play rugby. We have it all going on in here inside. We have pain on a cycle for years and years and years and then just when you feel you are making peace with it all, what happens? The menopause comes. The fucking menopause comes, and it is the most wonderful fucking thing in the world. And yes, your entire pelvic floor crumbles and you get fucking hot and no one cares, but then you’re free, no longer a slave, no longer a machine with parts. You’re just a person.",7

Sunshine,"“gets ko na.”women truly deserve their rights and autonomy in the philippines.the patriarcy and the church have such a tight grip on what should be a human right has plagued the country for so long. the cracks and corruption of such outdated ideals are starting to show on how it endangers women to get illegal abortions done by any means necessary para lang malaglag ang bata. licensed doctors fear treating botched abortion patients even when saving is supposedly their priority kasi illegal yun, mawawalan ang license nila.ironically, women never get to be the central topic of even when the pregnancy is their's to bare. girlhood forcibly transitioning to motherhood, prioritizing the infant for their supposed potentials, the neglect and lack of responsibilites of a father role. women are expected to drop their dreams and aspirations as soon as they carry a baby.oo nga naman, what if nga president ng pilipinas ang anak o ang tao behind sa cure ng aids or cancer? pero naisip ba nila paano kung ano ang magiging sa bata na may babaeng hindi handa maging ina?",11

Sunshine,AHHHHHHHH GANDA i love maris idc what anyone says,-1
Sunshine,"hirap maging babae in a patriarchal society let alone in a religious country. when it comes to accidental pregnancies, women always gets the short end of the stick. slutshamed and persecuted by society, family, religion and maybe even their friends. women should always have a choice if they want to be a mother or not and should not be shamed for whatever decisions they do.",-1

Sunshine,"such a good take on my body, my choice and maris racal took on the role so well",10
Sunshine,omg ,1
Sunshine,a movie that refuses to demonize women for choosing themselves yet at the same time refuses to glorify the fact that unwanted pregnancy is truly a life or death situation for most women… antoinette jadaone the woman u are - i can get past the kinda corny imaginary children when u have great cinematography and great actingits far from perfect but its definitely an important conversation to have,5
Sunshine,"Bold and brave enough to tap on an issue considered a taboo and unsettling in the Philippines. Explored both sides and perspective regarding abortion, but most importantly, highlighted the dilemma, struggle, and pain of a woman. This movie depicts how hard it is to be a woman with an ambition and choice – having to deal with the glaring eyes, defective system, hypocrtical religious people. More films like this should be released as this is a way to make people be more in touch with the reality and to respond knowledgeably towards it.",13
Sunshine,"putangina ang ganda, maya essay ko",1
Sunshine,make abortion legal in the philippines!!!!!!! this movie is an eye-opener of how close minded & dehumainizing people are pag dating sa usaping abortion. no woman should be told she can't make decisions about her own body. +++ ang galing ni maris aaaahhh,-1

Sunshine,"This movie would have been a 5/5 for me if not for the scene with Rhed Bustamante, which weakens its claim of being genuinely “pro-choice.” Some devout viewers might frame abortion as acceptable only in cases like rape or other extreme circumstances. Abortion is a woman’s right because she has full authority over her own body. Women are autonomous humans. Reproductive rights should not depend on how tragic the story is. Abortion should not be portrayed as acceptable only for rape survivors or under certain conditions, but as a fundamental expression of bodily autonomy for all women, regardless of their reasons.",5
Sunshine,really loved how it tackled such a heavy issue with sensitivity and it makes me so sad to know that this actually mirror’s some women’s truths. make abortion safe and accessible! #abortionishealthcare,5

Sunshine,kuhang-kuha ng Sunshine ang hirap ng pagiging babae at ang ingay ng maynila,0
Sunshine,"apaka hirap maging babae.sunshine did the right thing. she wasn’t being selfish; she was being honest. she knew, deep within herself, that she wasn’t ready to be a mother, and because of that self-awareness, she understood that ending the pregnancy was the most responsible choice she could make.i genuinely love this film. it exposes the harsh reality of living in a country dominated by catholic doctrine—where the people around us can be relentlessly cruel, judgmental, and unforgiving. the film tackles abortion with remarkable depth, showing how society instinctively treats it as a sin, a crime, even a form of murder—without ever pausing to consider the woman’s circumstances, pain, or autonomy.sana mapanood ‘to ng lahat, para maintindihan nila na hindi masama ang pagpapalaglag. people forget that there are reasons—real, painful, and valid reasons—why someone would choose it.the storyline of the thirteen-year-old child, impregnated by her uncle, shattered me. it happens in real life. children—literal children—forced to carry pregnancies at the cost of their own safety and future. it’s heartbreaking that instead of being allowed to end the pregnancy for their well-being, many are forced to keep it simply because abortion is illegal. the kid didn’t even know she was pregnant—she only realized when her stomach started to swell. that level of innocence being burdened with trauma feels monstrous.i truly hope our country stops clinging to extreme conservatism and learns to be more open-minded—to understand that these things do happen outside the walls of their moral fantasies. legalize abortion. educate children about sex. there is nothing lewd or obscene about knowledge—malisyoso lang ang mga utak ng mga ayaw magturo.at tangina si miggy. walang kuwenta.",-1
Sunshine,"""bakit, bata rin naman ako""",0
Sunshine,because why is abortion still illegal in this country?? this is real life,4
Sunshine,"one thing about antoinette jadaone is she will always write complex, raw, and multi-dimensional female characters.",-1
Sunshine,"loveee the solidarity of women in the film. especially jeannica's character (sunshine's sister) what stood out to me abt “Sunshine” is how it handles abortion without turning it into shock value or moral debate. the film treats it the way real life does, quietly, privately, and w a kind of heaviness that doesn’t need big explanations. it shows how a situation like this doesn’t happen in a vacuum; it’s shaped by family, religion, money, expectations, fear, and the silence surrounding women’s choices, seeing how, in the film, women were denied healthcare even in life or death situations bc of the values and systems upheld in this country.motherhood demands so much, money, energy, time, and an immeasurable amount of emotional labor. once u step into it, there's no turning back. that's why becoming a mother should never be forced, it's not something anyone should bepushed into. it's not easy to be one.being a mother is a beautiful, yet deeply complex role. it should be intentional, it should be a choice.at the same time, every person brought into this world deserves to be born out of intention, love, and readiness. if someone doesn't want to become a mother, that's OKAY. it's only fair, both to her, and to the life she could've been expected to bring into the world.the movie doesn’t try to justify anything or convince u what is right. instead, it shows the reality of how young people end up dealing w choices they were never prepared for. it’s not dramatic, not preachy, just painfully honest. the long pauses, the still shots, the way conversations trail off… it all reflects how hard it is to say something out loud when yk u’ll be judged before u’re understood.it’s thoughtful, grounded, and uncomfortable in a necessary way. a reminder that behind every headline or opinion is someone trying to figure out how to move forward when every option hurts.",20
Sunshine,LOPIT,1

Sa bawat kayod ng kamay at kalyong nabubuo dahil sa pagod, sa bawat patak ng pawis sa ilalim ng mainit na araw, at sa patuloy na pagtrabaho ng lahat para lamang sa kabuhayan — ito ang realidad ng Pilipinas. Hindi lang ito pelikula, ito ang katotoohanan. Ang realidad. Ang kamulatan ng masa na hanggang ngayon ay naghihirap para lang makawala sa hirap.Ramdam na ramdam bawat emosyon. Tangina ang husay e.

Sunshine,"honestly fuck the spaniards for colonising us and forcing their religious beliefs onto us.i applaud direk tonet for perfectly capturing the harsh reality that young women face in this country; the lack of safer options for abortion, and the prejudice from society towards women who have had or are planning to get an abortion. it truly is saddening how there are still people who submit themselves to the patriarchal and conservative system of this country that convinces them that getting an abortion is immoral and unacceptable. women should not be looked down on for wanting to make decisions for their own bodies, for their own lives. women deserve safer options. legalize abortion now!",4

Sunshine,"""naiintindihan mo ba ako?""""gets ko na.""See Greatest Filipino Films Of All TimeSee Jom’s Greatest Films Of All TimeOnce in a while, movies like this will remind us how great Philippine Cinema could be with proper production and marketing.Let's be honest, there are many films like Sunshine out there, produced and marketed independently. The talent of our Filipino directors, writers, and actors is flourishing; it just needs the right hand managing them. Studios surrounding Sunshine took a huge gamble promoting and marketing this movie, because they know how good it is. And it's that fcking good!Sunshine beautifully captures Sunshine, our protagonist, as she battles her way out of an unwanted pregnancy set in the cold city of Manila. This journey was documented with captivating visuals of Sunshine in the gym, in Quiapo, in a motel, etc. On top of this, this is unlike any other dialogue in mainstream Pinoy. The dialogue often has witty layers, purposeful intentions, and emotional punches.Maris Racal delivered a career-defining performance. This is not the same Maris Racal we often see in teleseryes or some other romcom movie. Her performance is an incredible take on such a complex and relatable character.I could nitpick some off details here and there which really bugged me, but I won't talk about it here as I believe that further magnifying this movie's success is what we should do.Sunshine represents every woman, every female, every girl, every lady of any shape or form. It brings up socially relevant topics and issues worthy of discussion. I am most impressed by its bravery to speak all about these, coming from a conservative country. Sunshine, the protagonist, showed bravery in confronting the stigma and the conservative norms.

Sunshine,"Antoinette Jadaone's ""Sunshine"" is anchored by a stellar lead performance from Maris Racal and a neo-realist perspective on the lack of reproductive rights in the Philippines. The film follows a rhythmic gymnast who dreams of participating in the Olympics, only to find out that she is pregnant. The film explores the difficulties of finding the right medical care for abortion. Racal's performance is impressive, and she is solidly supported by Annika Co, Jennica Garcia, and Meryll Soriano. Jadaone is able to capture the dirt and grime of Manila's urban areas, as well as the outdated beliefs in the country.Reproductive rights for all!",17

Biggest fear na ata ang maging teenage mom ka dito sa Pilipinas; hindi dahil may nakakahiya, kundi dahil doon na lang irereduce ng lahat ng tao ang buong pagkatao mo. Kung tutuusin, mas cinocondemn pa nga nang iba ‘yung pagpapa-abort kesa sa pagnanakaw o pag-ddrugs na makakalimutan na makalipas ilang araw at babansagang “normal” lang. Sa bawat sulok ng Pilipinas, there would always be a Sunshine or a Mary Grace na aping-api na nga ng patriyarkiya, ilulugmok pa ng mga maka-relihiyon. Just shows how difficult it is to be a woman, especially a woman living in the country of so-called saints.

Sunshine,"The movie did not contain any surprise elements whatsoever — rather, it depicted the realities that Filipino women endure, especially when it comes to pregnancy and abortion. Seeing individuals like Sunshine and Mary Grace deal with the outcomes they did not choose is devastating. It's awful that they had to put their own lives in danger to reclaim their lives. In addition, I detest the notion that women are blamed and criticized while the majority of males who participated in the incident roam free from the consequences. It's horrible how obviously apparent the double standards are. Most of us are aware of the worst-case situations if abortion isn't legalized, and this film accurately depicts the gravity of the situation. If watching this doesn't change your mind about being anti-abortion, I don't know what will. Not everyone is ready to be a mother. Not everyone is capable of being a mother. Is protecting your child's future and safety truly a sin? I truly hope that this movie will continue to inspire empathy and provide better facilities for safe and regulated practices in the country. Let's do better, Philippines.",-1
Sunshine,"“Gets ko na.”Ang dami kong gustong sabihin na feeling ko, hindi ko kayang masulat in a movie review. Literal na daramdamin mo lang yung pelikula and your emotions will be enough for people to understand.Gets na gets ko si Sunshine—from thinking you’re an adult yet feeling like a child; an ambitious girl to a woman on a tightrope; from being alone and criticized by society as a whole to finding your space, your people, your support system despite what people have to say… and ultimately choosing your own peace and happiness—something that is deemed a privilege for women. Hindi naging madali ang pinagdaanan ni Sunshine at ng milyong-milyong babae sa Pilipinas, sa mundo. May mga babaeng katulad niya na hindi sinasadyang mabuntis, may mga babae namang katulad ni Menggay na posibleng ginahasa at pinagsamantalahan. Hindi ko masikmura kung gaano karaming babae ang dumadaan sa ganitong hirap araw-araw at nakakaramdam na wala na silang mapanghahawakan pa. At dadagdag pa sa pasakit ang ang mga lalaki, ang simbahan, gobyerno at mga sarado ang isip sa ganitong sitwasyon. Why is it that women have to suffer the consequences alone, with the whole world—heaven and hell—blaming them for what happened. A world that continues to place heavy pressure on a woman’s shoulders yet crucify them the moment they make a mistake. Society needs to be more forgiving to women who are trying their best to make and take up space without making them sacrifice their whole life and identity. Every woman is a Sunshine of their own, and I hope that they realize that their happiness, their life, their voices and choices matter.",-1
Sunshine,"ayaw ko maging nanayis a completety valid reason. in a society where women are expected to carry everything on their own, may Sunshine remind us that not being ready for motherhood is perfectly okay. You have your own life, and you have your own dreams. May we all dream like Sunshine bravely, loudly, and unapologetically.Fck men who uphold misogyny, fck the patriarchal system, fck the kind of religion and culture that silence women. Fck everything that prevents women from having their own choices and decisions. Women deserve proper healthcare and abortion is healthcare. I hope gets yun ng mga tao. I hope gets nyo si Sunshine.",-1

Sunshine,"I genuinely loved how the movie made sure to show all of the things that make unwanted pregnancy and abortion hard for women: the loss of opportunities, the potential absence of the father, the lack of support from society, the scrutiny, all on top of the idea of ""killing"" your child; an idea heavily imposed on us from the day we were born. Maris' acting showed how difficult it is to be thinking of all of that and more.IMO the story takes into account the ethics of the topic while making sure to portray the most important part: how the woman feels. Sana, ma-gets na rin ng lahat :)",5

""will getting abortion forfeit my spot in heaven?""

Sunshine,"SAGOT SA PELIKULANG “SUNSHINE”: HINDI GUGUSTUHIN NG BATA ANG MAMATAY SA ABORSYON KONTRA SA PINAKITA SA PELIKULA----------------------------Paalala: Ito ay dati naming Facebook post na muli naming inilabas dahil nasa Netflix na ang pelikulang ""Sunshine."" Para sa nagnanais na malaman kung sino ang ""unlikely guide"" sa caption, basahin ang post dito. ----------------------------Matapos maibalita ang pelikulang “Sunshine” ni Maris Racal, inaasahan ko na ang pagsuporta nito sa aborsyon o ang pagkitil sa anak na nasa sinapupunan ng kanyang ina. Ngunit, ang hindi ko inasahan ay ang huling parte ng pelikula. Hindi ko pinanood ang pelikulang ito ngunit nagbase ako sa buod nito upang malaman kung ano ang naganap [1].Si Sunshine (Maris Racal) ay naghahanda na sumali sa “gymnastics team” para sa Olympics ngunit nalaman niya na buntis pala siya. Dahil dito, pumunta siya sa Quiapo upang bumili ng pampalaglag. Matapos ng eksenang ito ay makikita na sinusundan siya ng isang batang babae. Iyon pala, ang babaeng ito, na nasa larawan sa post na ito, ay isang “imaginary friend” ni Sunshine. Hindi ko na babanggitin ang gitna ng buod ng kwento ngunit sa huling parte ng pelikula, makikita na si Sunshine ay naghahanda para sa Olympics. Nagpakita muli ang “imaginary friend” na batang babae kay Sunshine. Tinanong ni Sunshine kung nauunawaan ba ng batang babae ang desisyon niya. Matapos nito, pinakita ng batang babae na tinatanggap niya at niyakap niya na may luha sa mata si Sunshine. Ang “plot twist” dito ay ang “imaginary friend” na ito ay ang anak ni Sunshine na namatay dahil sa aborsyon. Sa imahinasyon ni Sunshine, tinanggap ng kanyang anak ang desisyon ni Sunshine na patayin siya sa sinapupunan. Tila ba tinuturo ng pelikulang ito, hindi lang na dapat gawing ligal ang pagpili ng tao na patayin ang anak sa sinapupunan ng ina, kundi gugustuhin ng isang bata na mamatay na lamang sa aborsyon kaysa ang mabuhay dahil sa benepisyo na matatanggap ng nanay kung pinatay na lang ang kanyang anak. Nakakalungkot dahil sobrang sama ng moralidad na ipinapalaganap ng pelikulang ito. Dahil dito, nais ko lang ipakita kung ano ang sinabi ng mga taong nakaligtas sa tangkang aborsyon. Hindi sa lahat ng pagkakataon ay namamatay ang mga anak na pinapalaglag. Dahil dito, mahalaga na makita ang kanilang perspektibo sa usapin ng aborsyon matapos silang makaligtas dito. Sabi ni Linda Swayn na nakaligtas sa aborsyon ngunit nagkaroon ng problema sa kanyang bungo dahil sa bawal na gamot na ginamit sa pampalaglag,""The greatest gift I have received is life. God has given me the greatest gift of life [2].""Ito naman ang mababasa sa buhay ni Charlie Rousseau, isang tagapagsalita sa radyo sa Canada, na nakaligtas ng aborsyon na nagdulot upang mabuhay siyang putol ang braso at dalawang binti,“She wants to continue with her dream to work and live remotely, and see the world [3].""Makikita naman natin na lagi nanaginip ng masama si Kimberly na maaaring parte ng kanyang masamang alaala sa tangkang pagpatay sa kanya,“For as long as I can remember, I would have a recurring nightmare. I could feel it coming, as if someone was coming to kill me... Somehow I knew it was going to kill me! It was terrifying! When I was 15 years old, I woke from the nightmare screaming and crying [4].""Ngayon, huwag muna natin isipin ang aborsyon kundi ang bagong silang na sanggol. Tama ba na patayin sila para hindi maapektuhan ang pangarap ng kanyang nanay? Sa tingin ba natin, sasabihin ng sanggol na tama ang desisyon ng kanyang ina na patayin siya? Malamang ay hindi. Ito rin ang ating rason sa pagtanggol sa buhay ng lahat, lalo na ng mga bata na walang kakayahan ipagtanggol ang kanilang sarili. Galing mismo sa boses ng mga nakaligtas ng aborsyon na alam nila kung gaano ito kasama at gaano kaganda ang buhay. Walang bata ang gugustuhin na sila ay patayin. Itigil na sana nila ang kasinungalingang ipinapalaganap sa pelikulang ito.",3
Sunshine,"Bring back more filipino movies like this, gets ko sunshineSunshine really hits the mark in portraying toxic filipino culture (since we’re a largely catholic country, abortion is looked as “sinful” and “immoral”) and Filipino women struggles. We don’t even have access to safe abortion, even if the baby is born off of violence since it’s illegal. And it STILL is. Why is the concern of safety regarded for the unborn baby,, not the woman carrying it? Why are we shaming women for not wanting to keep it even if they didn’t ask for it? Kakainis. No more words other than thank you to Antoinette Jadaone for making a movie that tackles the pro-life/pro-choice conflict so well and shows awareness respectfully. Nailed it so hard. It’s uncomfortable to watch, but I can’t imagine the reality of living it.The movie leaving us with the question, are these beliefs that can be challenged more important to uphold than the safety of our Filipino women? How many more women must suffer until it gets through their thick skull that these beliefs and the anti-abortion law actively does more harm than good?Extra: I reco you read Nutribun review of this movie after you’ve watched it, explains it much better than me and i agreed with SO many points.",-1
Sunshine,"Abortion has been a pressing issue in a predominantly Christianised nation like the Philippines. Albeit some of the points raised are quite incisive, what Sunshine lacks is an original insight on how we ought to discuss “abortion” that Hinugot sa Langit (poverty & morality) and Bendor (folk & speculative realism) have not articulated yet. Maris Racal and Jennica Garcia are two of this generation’s finest actresses, in my opinion.",-1

Sunshine,"this isn’t really a film about mistakes. well, at least for me. it’s a film about the quiet burdens women carry—those moments when the world expects you to stay composed while everything inside you is breaking apart. what stayed with me wasn’t the plot itself, but the feeling of watching a girl stand at the edge of her dreams while life keeps pulling her in directions she never asked for.there is a particular kind of loneliness here that Filipinas know too well: the pressure to be strong, the fear of being judged, the lack of safe spaces to fall apart... The film captures that ache, the way society can be quick to moralize but slow to understand.For me, it felt like looking at a reflection of a system we’ve all quietly learned to navigate: the whispers, the shame, the institutions that pretend to help but rarely do. Yet in those heavy moments, you still see a girl trying to choose herself, even when the world insists she shouldn’t.it’s messy, raw, and painfully familiar… and that’s why it felt less like watching a film and more like remembering something you wish you could forget.",36

Sunshine,"just had to rewatch once more. ito, seryoso na at skl ko lang din this anecdote of mine. i remember being a transferee in sixth grade when i was suddenly forced into an intra-school debate tournament. one of the motions i had was about the legalization of abortion and i was placed in the opposing team. i vividly remember kung paano ako naging mulat sa topic na ‘to and i thought to myself, “oo nga, ‘no? bakit nga ba bawal?” i honestly had a hard time countering the government side’s points, so i just ended up focusing on my own arguments (without saying any rebuttals) instead — buti leader of the opp. lang ako no’n, lol. our debate teacher, or the madam chair, was very strict about not using the church as a basis when making an argument. but all i could think of then was the bible, i couldn’t think of any other countering argument na pwede kong maibato.and so, if a small-scale school debate tournament prohibits using the church as an argument, why can’t we demand the same from our government? bakit patuloy na iginigiit ang impluwensya ng simbahan sa batas if we supposedly live in a secular state?sunshine and all filipino (women) do not deserve this bullshit. free and accessible (reproductive) healthcare for filipinos!on the side note, this film is incredibly well-made and fearless. salamat, direk tonet and to everyone involved. give maris racal her flowers juseyo! i’m sooo glad i finally got to watch this kasi i missed the local screening months ago. i really hope na maging mulat ang bawat manonood kung bakit napaka-timely at mahalaga ang mga pelikulang tulad nito.",4

Sunshine,"one striking scene was when she went to the church to pray she didn't go in and pray, kneeling at the pews because 1) she wa begging for forgiveness for intending to do a unforgivable thing, and (2) she wasn't dressed ""appropriately"" (all the other church-goers were in shirts and pants)sunshine captured manila and the feeling of being and lost in manila so accurately sand also whew damn i would been angry if she didnt go thru #legalizeabortionsosososo good w/ nanay and tatay (who slept midway thru) and pompom and ponyo and puma",28

Sunshine,"Sunshine offers a quiet yet affecting exploration of teenage pregnancy and abortion—two issues deeply intertwined with the social and economic realities of our country. What makes the film striking is its simplicity: it doesn’t rely on heavy dramatics, but instead allows its heartfelt moments and grounded storytelling to speak for themselves.I particularly appreciated how the film subtly incorporated supernatural elements. Rather than distracting from the story, these touches added depth and symbolism, making the film feel both intimate and introspective. It’s a creative choice that gives Sunshine a unique emotional texture.As someone who grew up Catholic, I’ve never taken a firm stance on abortion; I’ve mostly remained indifferent or unsure. But this film pushed me to reflect on the bigger picture. It gently raises a painful yet necessary question: Why bring a child into a country that struggles to provide a dignified, nurturing environment for its people? Without forcing a specific viewpoint, Sunshine invites viewers to confront the harsh realities that many young Filipinos face—stories that are often ignored or oversimplified.Overall, Sunshine succeeds not just as a piece of cinema, but as a conversation starter. It lingers with you, urging you to think about compassion, choice, and the societal conditions that shape both. It’s a simple film, but one with a resonance that’s hard to forget.",-1

Filmnya artistik yang dipadu dengan adanya unsur surealis, yang justru mengingatkanku dengan Sore. Bedanya, si ""anak dari masa depan"" berusaha menyelamatkan si ibu dari hal-hal yang enggak mestinya dia lakukan. Yaa si anak memang enggak bilang dia dari masa depan, sih, seperti Sore.",-1

Sunshine,"Mga uri ng tao na hinihiling kong masunog sa impyerno:1. Mga lalaki sa mundo2. Overly religious people3. PRO-LIFERS.WOMEN'S RIGHTS SHOULDN’T BE SOMETHING TO BE DEBATED!“Hindi pa ako ready maging nanay” is already a valid reason for abortion. It’s her choice, not a moral issue for everyone to judge. Nakakalungkot noong ipinakita sa movie na ito kung gaano kalala ang situation sa public hospitals—kulang sa resources, walang safe at stigma-free options, mayroon pa ngang nanganganak na lang sa sahig dahil sa kakulangan sa mga tao at kagamitan. Kaya hindi nakapagtataka na for many women, the “safest” choice ends up being underground options, kahit sobrang risky. Mas ironic pa, kasi nasa paligid lang ng simbahan ang mga nagbebenta ng pamparegla, hilot, at kung anu-ano, tapos ang narrative ng church: “kung natukso ka, talo ka.” Kaya understandable that the “tukso” becomes sometimes the only lifeline for someone desperate. Women bear the brunt of the hypocrisy. That’s literally the only way a woman could access it. Hindi ko alam kung bakit kapag babae ka, ang daming bawal sa’yo. Pero hindi ka naman bibigyan ng reliable options. Napaka eye-opening nito sa atin, lalo na’t ipinakita sa atin na wala tayong karapatan husgahan ang batang ina kasi hindi natin alam ang pinagdadaanan nila. Rape victim man o hindi, a woman should always have the right to decide for herself—her body is never up for debate.",4
Sunshine,"I love this movie, it's not only about sunshine being pregnant at a young age but the sad reality here in the Philippines why some women would go through illegal abortions and yet there's judgment and shame.

Sunshine,"Okay siya. Gets ko 'yung punto. Hindi na-romanticize ang unplanned pregnancy. Alam nating lahat na tangina ni Miggy. Very backwards ang point of view ng character ni Piolo as a pastor. Struggle maging babae kasi kapag ikaw ang nagkulang, nagkamali, at ""nadisgrasya"", ikaw pa ang kawawa. Pero hilaw ang storytelling. Kung una pa lang, gets mo na ang maraming pagkakamali na tinalakay ng pelikula, good for you. Kasi aware ka na, at may foundation ka dun sa knowledge. Pero paano 'yung wala? 'Yung unang beses mapapanood ang Sunshine with that kind and approach of a prevalent social issue? Magegets ba nila? Tayo-tayo lang ba ang magkakaintindihan?

Sunshine,"finally a film with good dialogue and actually filmed within manila!! u can already tell the movie was bound to touch on heavy topics but there were still moments where i thought, “holy shit, they really went there” O_O live for the gay ariana grande kid, he’s lowk me. i gen would not have expected him to be the 13 y/o’s son LIKE i knew alr that the girl was supposedly sunshine’s child but it did not hit me that ariana…",-1
Sunshine,"“Drown out the noise. You are Sunshine.”it’s heartbreaking how many young women are going through this right now. abortion in the Philippines is not only illegal, but also so deeply stigmatized that many are forced to carry this burden alone, sometimes risking their own lives through unsafe procedures. the film portrays this reality with such quiet honesty that it sticks with you. the symbolism throughout was also so striking, like the “Gift of God” sign in the jeepney Sunshine rode, or her so-called imaginary friend who could represent her unborn child or her inner child.it was honestly so satisfying watching her stand up for herself against miggy and his father, who’s a pastor. then of course, her breaking the bottle on tito bobot’s head? deserved. every mf like him deserves that.the final sequence felt incredibly freeing as well. it was like she was finally free, almost like a release of everything she had been carrying — fear, shame, pressure, expectation. her imaginary friend disappearing can be interpreted that she did push through with the abortion (which parallels the 13 y/o kid and ariana), or as her finally finding peace with whatever choice she made. hopefully, this film gives conservatives some perspective on the immense weight placed on women in these situations, and they’ll finally be able to say, “Gets ko na.” not everyone has the means to raise a child, especially when society is quick to judge. and even if you do have the means, you might simply not be ready because you might still have dreams you want to chase. it’s really tough, and that’s why kindness matters so much.at the end of the day, we shouldn’t be the ones deciding what women should do with their bodies. and yeah, practice safe sex!!",-1

Sunshine,"crazy movie to watch with your boyfriend for the first time (no regrets)- says a lot that i already knew the realities the movie was meant to expose because it's a very real possibility for me (and i've experienced some parts firsthand) (XD) (i am never going back to reddit that had me believing in some bs) (which is based on truth naman but still you could never fully trust these sites)- some aspects of teenage pregnancy and abortion might be new to some people because these things wouldn't concern them in the first place (men) (conservatives)- which is why the characters feel very planted. as in, their role is In Your Face (to name a few: the kids, piolo pascal*, miggy**, ate, her kid, unhelpful little brother that shares a room with her lol, whole tito boyet sideplot)- but i think the best thing this movie does is spark conversation, especially since it covers those unsaid aspects (e.g., the role of the church & ses, feelings of dread & anxiety when faced with the possibility of being pregnant, again: reddit, the actual pain & danger of an abortion) and makes it Palatable for d general ph audience!!!!!!!- again, since this is a taboo topic, people wouldn't want something too extreme and radical, so this movie is a good first step towards talking about it- still tho, the palatability made the ending so ass for me personally like. everything just started coming together a lil too smoothly for sunshine and honestly... for me ha...... Meh..........- anyway, props to maris racal for executing the choreo holy shit. so impressive and so cleanalso, Wow this movie hit so close to home, even outside of the content mismo1) towers2) i have never seen a movie with so many familiar landmarks like vito cruz (hello what other ""mainstream"" media's been filmed here), recto, avenida, quiapo. plus the lrt and the fact that they commuted everywhere!! i loved that3) all girls (cliques) and all boys school aspect. plus the fact that they were in a relationship coz partner school ata lol4) the fact she basically had no one but herself at one point oh my god made me So grateful for my support systemtbh the only thing that made me cry from this movie was the ate coming to bed with sunshine Ough... and the very hard conversation i had with aldy after coz wow we did not process that pala (o diba sparks conversation) but yes good movieside notes* i'm so sorry nathrow off aq sa mukha nya like the movie has pretty new faces for me so seeing him was like Woah. what are u doing here** casting for him was actually spot on. straight from a private school",5

Sunshine,"'Yung pangarap ko, kung ano ang pangarap niya.Ang hirap maging babae sa bansang 'to.Gusto ko lang sabihin na napakagaling ng mga gumanap sa mga karakter sa pelikulang 'to, hindi ako usually umiiyak sa mga pinapanood ko, pero dito, nagawa ko. Para sa'kin, purong-puro 'yung mga scenes, naipakita talaga 'yung reyalidad ng buhay pagdating sa mga taong katulad ni Sunshine, mga pangyayari na katulad ng sa kanya. Pati 'yung sitwasyon na nangyayari sa mga public hospitals, 'yung mga facilities na binabayaran natin gamit ang tax natin, ay hindi nila magawang maayos. May mga doktor pang kung umasta ay hindi sila propesyonal at napaka-condescending. It is the reality of life here in the Philippines. Napansin ko rin that hatred for abortion is rooted from patriarchy and religion, napakahirap maging babae kapag ito ang mga kalaban mo, 'no? Sa babae ang sisi, sa babae ang lahat ng kasalanan habang ang mga lalaki ay may tinatawag na ""free pass."" Sabi pa nga nila, ""Ba't ka kasi bumubukaka,"" o kaya naman, ""Kung sino-sino na lang kasi ang kinakalantari mo."" Those things are the representation of the mindset of those who deem themselves as religious, but for me, they are just a bunch of hypocrites. Men can even be erased from the picture, and women will continue being condemned. Fuck people with double standards. Our society is so hypocrite that 'yung mga tinatawag na ""pamparegla"" ay natatagpuan malapit sa labas ng simbahan. Gaano sila kamapanghusga sa mga babaeng may karapatan sa kanilang sariling katawan, ipinapakita 'yan sa paniniwala nilang biased at outdated. It is sad to think na kailangan pa ng mga kababaihan na mag-lean towards these illegal means just to afford being free, when in the first place, it is their right to have a legal, safer, and non-demoralizing way to abort when it means taking care of their body, preventing the unborn from having a miserable life, and just letting women have their right to bodily autonomy. It just shows na napaka-patriarchal ng batas, sumabay pa 'yang pagiging misogynistic ng lipunang ginagalawan natin. These force women into motherhood and to have a life they do not want, and guess what happens after that? The cycle continues. Sa mga katulad ni Sunshine, at sa mga kababaihan, I'm proud of you. Sana'y buhay pa ako kapag nawala na 'yang ganyang kabobohang mindset na laganap ngayon.",3

Sunshine,"i get it, sunshine.",2
Sunshine,"I hesitated to write a review that delves into the realities women in our country face, because I’m not the person who should be speaking for them.But SUNSHINE is a deeply powerful film.It would’ve been easy for a story like this to sink into pure despair from beginning to end. Yet somehow, the film manages to confront its darkest truths while still carving out a sliver of hope. The performances are extraordinary—raw, fearless, and honest—but they make the film difficult to watch in the best possible way. It exposes how our country refuses to grow, medicine needed for the operation coming from black markets, how it continues to force women into roles far smaller than what they’re capable of, and how it avoids addressing issues that desperately need to be talked about. Women deserve choice. They deserve agency. They deserve that right without question.This film places you in the shoes of a woman who believes her life has been shattered by one reckless decision made by someone she trusted—and then shows, unflinchingly, how our society treats victims.Hopefully, the success of this film reignites the conversation around the importance of being pro-choice and pushes us toward building a better, more humane system.All we hope for is a little sunshine to finally break through.",-1

Sunshine,"Gets ko na.that scene is so powerful and such a forgiving narrative which was the perfect indication of that one monologue kung saan sinabi ni bata na ang pangarap niya ay kung ano ang pangarap ni Sunshine. this film made me think of women who were robbed from chasing their own dreams and ambition. don't get me wrong, but most of them are grateful for the life of their own children but i noticed how some of them still thought about their unfulfilled dreams at nasaan na sana sila ngayon kung hindi lamang sila nagkaanak nang maaga. just think of it. paano naman yung mga walang choice? some may call women with so much ambition selfish for firmly believing their own potential but let us think of those who got trapped in a loveless household, stuck with the unending loop of maternal duties that becomes dreadful as day goes by, slowly losing their identity, and autonomy.",30

Sunshine,Kelan ba kasi magiging legal ang abortion sa Pinas?,4
Sunshine,"this film doesn't just tell a story; it exposes a system. for that reason, it stands as one of the most important films ever made in the philippines. honestly, it deserves far more attention, discussion, and recognition. include it in school curriculums too if possible.you don't need tearful monologues, or dramatic breakdowns (not that there's anything wrong with them) to understand the full weight of sunshine's situation. the film uses restraint as its sharpest tool. the dim, muted visuals; the overwhelming noise of her environment; the way the camera locks her in the centre of the frame.. always boxed in, always between lines.. all emphasise how trapped she is by the social and religious stigma, and by a society that refuses to recognise abortion as a woman's right. the blurred backgrounds aren't just aesthetic; they reinforce her disconnection from the world around her. she doesn't have the luxury to care about anything beyond her immediate reality: herself, her dreams, and the looming consequences of every decision she faces.and that is the tragedy, sunshine is a young woman with ambition, yet she navigates a world that is unforgiving. she is asked to seek god's forgiveness for attempting to abort the baby, yet if god is understanding, wouldn't he understand that she is not ready, and that she acted out of necessity? with abortion vilified and access almost impossible, the film illustrates how society corners, isolates, and silences young mothers.. not with loud condemnation, but with quiet, crushing inevitability. it is a devastating portrait of how systemic and cultural forces conspire to limit women's autonomy, and a reminder of the human cost of denying choice.one of the most striking elements of the film, for me, is its gendered power dynamic. every character, without exception, imposes his own beliefs onto sunshine. urging her to keep the baby, citing legality, morality, or personal conviction. their ""advice"" is never about her well-being, it's about controlling her choices. the absence of a single moment where a man asks what she wants is not accidental, it reflects a broader social structure where women's autonomy is secondary to male authority.the women in the film, however, present a more nuanced spectrum. some internalise patriarchal norms and unintentionally reinforce them, but many others recognise sunshine's struggle immediately. they empathise not because they have the answers, but because they understand the emotional, economic, and social burden that falls disproportionately on women. their solidarity is quiet but powerful. a direct contrast to the coercive, dismissive tone of the male characters. the film ultimately critiques how systems built and upheld by men deny women agency, especially around reproductive choices. in a society where institutional and cultural norms consistently silence women, the film shows that women often became each other's only source of validation, understanding, and empowerment. no scene is waster. nothing is filler. every character is intentionally placed, each one shaping or limiting sunshine's decisions in ways that feel painfully real.",-1
Sunshine,"this is definitely one of the best films i’ve seen this year. It truly left a lasting impression on me, i’m still processing what i just watched. Maris did an incredible job.",-1
Sunshine,Applause for the movie not letting the main character birth a child just to suit the palate of conservative filipinos.,-1
Sunshine,"Yes! This is the type of films the Philippines should make more! Finally a movie with substance, relevance, and courage to tell a story despite cultural taboo. This is required and essential.I thought an hour and a half wouldn’t be enough to dig deeper into the journey of Sunshine but it was actually just enough to see all of it. Although, there were unnecessary choices made in the film that I disliked and that I wish were done differently and I wish saw more of Sunshine’s character in the lowest of lows or maybe I’m just greedy. However,Maris Racal is a revelation. And for the Philippines to have such a film like this one that speaks to so many women, even men, in the country. I hope this is a step forward for the country to move progressively and this be a force for politicians to pass that bill. Because after all, films are made to speak out, protest, and to implement change. Lastly, Sunshine is such a huge step towards good filmmaking in the Philippines. We need more films that speak of truth and of society. Stories that need to be heard and not rely too much on fake romance. Though Sunshine isn’t perfect as a film itself, the courage and the amount of truth revealed in an hour and a half are enough to have the voices of so many women be heard. TO THE PHILIPPINES: YES TO ABORTION!",-1

Sunshine,"It was such a powerful Filipino movie—an eye-opener. Stories like that remind me that these things are really happening in our country. And I have to say, I stand by my belief in abortion.For me, only the one carrying it has the right to decide what to do. It takes courage and responsibility to be a mother, and that choice should never be taken lightly.

Sunshine,"Alas tres na ng madaling araw pero I have to get this out kahit medj unorgnized pa ang thoughts ko.!! MAY CONTAIN SPOILER !!GRABE. GRABE. GRABE. MARIS RACAL I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH YOUR GAME!Ang kwento, ang cinematography, ang emosyon!!! Sobrang raw and realistic from the familiar “jeje” song playing sa jeep pagsakay ni Sunshine, to the 13 yr old na nakaranas ng pang aabuso mula sa kanyang tito (talamak ang kaso ng incest sa pinas, thank u direk for highlighting that). Sa sobrang realistic pati ang inis ko kuhang kuha ng conservative doctor. Literally had to pause and say “Putangina” pag sabing “Baka yan pala ang magiging future presidente ng Pilipinas or ang makakagamot sa AIDS.”Ang pelikulang ito ay napakatapang. It had the guts to shine a spotlight on a longstanding issue sa bansa na lagi na lang inooverlook. It dare call out and address what Filipinos considered as taboo. And as someone who had a debate with her mom over dinner about abortion, this film is so special to me. “Hindi ka ba kinikilabutan?” were my moms’ exact words but I cannot blame her. Being a country deeply rooted in Christianity, where morals and teachings of the church are deeply ingrained in you ever since you were young, it is actually hard to speak freely about this things without the catholic guilt creeping up on you. Kaya ang laki rin ng significance ng pagdasal muna ni Sunshine before nya gawin. To ask the lord for forgiveness.Plus it doesn’t shy away from showing the state of the country’s public healthcare system. Nakakaputangina lang. Putangina ng gobyerno. Putangina ng sistema kung saan kailangan maging life-threatening situation ang pagpapalaglag. Banning abortion does not end it, it only makes it unsafe for women since it causes them to resort to underground means. And what an irony that one of those means can be found tucked under the shadows of the church (mga ale na nagbebenta ng pamparegla, u carry so much hope for these women). The very church that condemns it and shuns women who will even consider it. This film is a big step in understanding women’s bodily autonomy. Mas mahalaga pa rin ang buhay ng nagdadalang-tao. Lastly, Annika (the child symbolizing Sunshine’s future child) saying “Gets ko na” at the end is so so dear huhu. Bata pa ang bata para magkabata. She has her whole life ahead of her and god forbid a woman chooses herself and her dreams. Gets ko na, Sunshine. Gets ko na.",0

Sunshine,i love letterboxd because i have a space where i can yap about how that scene where sunshine got off a jeepney that said “gift from god” after just finding out that she’s pregnant might be an allegory to how bearing a child is often alluded as god’s gift and i think it was absolutely insane bc it was so subtle yet a powerful detail like you get me!!anyways UGHHHHHHH WHAT A GREAT FILM EVERYONE GET WOKE NOW AND LEGALIZE ABORTION!!,5
Sunshine,Mabuhay ang mga Kababaihan ,0
Sunshine,"this film is so close to my heart and i don't think there's a word in any dictionary that can explain how much value i put in this movie. sunshine is the representation of many young girls in the philippines and the cultural violence that filipino women have to face every single day. manila is home, but what home turns away its daughters? what home is so noisy that it becomes hard to hear the plea for change? it's hard to drown out the noise when manila is nothing but the howl of traffic and trains grinding along rusty tracks. it's hard to drown out the noise when every corner of the city carries the weight of other people's opinions about you. it's hard to drown out the noise when people love nothing more than the echo of their own voices. it's hard to drown out the noise when the government chooses to not help. it's hard to drown out the noise when the hospitals meant to care for you are bursting in the seams. it's hard to drown out the noise when you're a woman in manila. besides, why are we expected to keep drowning out the noise? why can't the noise just stop. i am tired of seeing women seek help from the narrow and noisy streets of quiapo to get unsafe abortion simply because there's no other choice available to them. women should be able to walk into a hospital and feel protected in their own decisions, in their own bodies, without a doctor insisting they “thank God” for something that has broken them. sunshine, i dream the same dreams you have. gets na gets kita",12

Sunshine,"This is tough to watch as a woman. I was already crying halfway through the film. I usually comment on the techniques used by the production but I honestly don't feel like it with this film because the story and the themes tackled carries so much weight. I just hope this film could shine a light to everybody, especially the PH Government. The topic shown, specifically, is more than cultural, it is systemic. It is not just a medical issue or a mere moral dilemma in our belief systems considering that it significantly affects all Filipino women. The more we shy away from these issues, the more we increase mortality rates, creating dysfunctional families and dysfunctional communities as a whole, it also contributes to the poverty problem that has prevailed since forever. Safe abortion is a necessity, especially in this godforsaken country.",26

Sunshine,"Hands down, wala akong masabi sa palabas na ‘to. This film reveals everything about the Philippines that we don’t often talk about. Many Filipinos have no choice kasi illegal ang abortion dito, and young women are forced into situations THEY NEVER REALLY WANTED. It shows the harsh reality of how society constantly pressures women into motherhood, ignoring their dreams, their health, and their right to make decisions about their own bodies. The film doesn’t sugarcoat the pain physical, emotional, and mental—that comes with being trapped in a system that refuses to acknowledge their autonomy.What hits the hardest is how normalized this struggle has become, and how many are suffering in silence. Especially the story of rhed bustamante’s character. Grabe. 13 years old nag cacarry na ng baby  a child carrying a child. This is a message to all the people to talk more openly about abortion, to stop victim-blaming, and to hold those useless shitty ass irresponsible men accountable. It’s more than a movie—it’s a wake-up call, a plea for empathy, and a DEMAND for change. Sobrang gets kita, sunshine.",-1

Loved how they showed actual filipino life through the eyes of a passionate girl living in a not so easy way of life.

Sunshine,"overhyped  the acting was crazy good— i can see maris’ effort sa whole film, the portrayal of the reality of women and the reality in the streets was portrayed well. i didn’t notice the time— time went by so quickly which means that the pacing was good. but, it’s still overhyped. failed delivery of “my body, my choice” message. u cant compare sunshine’s situation, irresponsible sex; to mary grace’s situation, rape. “tite muna bago utak” yung message na naconvey…",-1
Sunshine,"SUCH AN IMPORTANT FILM!!!!During these times, we genuinely need more films like this. First, not only does it touch on the struggles of a young woman faced with an unwanted pregnancy. It also shows how easy it is for the men to rid themselves of the responsibility. Miggy DID NOT give a fuck about Sunshine. He wanted her to deal with it herself; he wasn't even going to give her money if she didn't threaten him. It was his fault that she got pregnant, and yet she has to suffer the consequences of their unprotected sex, which he insisted upon. Second, it is very important how this film shows that early/childhood pregnancies are not just because of young people's 'kapabayaan.' More often than not, young girls' pregnancies are results of sexual assault and rape by predators. I cried when I saw Mary Grace, even more when we were told she's just 13. JUST 13!!!!! She wasn't ""wreckless,"" she wasn't out there having sex with anyone; she was raped by her own uncle. And she's just expected to mother the child born out of such a horrific thing done to her?Third, it shows you just how important legalizing abortion is. It's already happening out there. People are selling abortive pills or concoctions. People are doing basement abortions, in unsafe conditions, without licensed doctors. It's happening and it's dangerous. Sunshine was hospitalized. Mary Grace almost died. If abortion was legal, none of this would've happened. These girls would've been safe and cared for.Again, what an important film! It also shows how abysmal the healthcare system is in the Philippines. Overcrowded hospitals, little to no financial support, etc.On top of that, phenomenal performances all around. Maris Racal was great. Jennica Garcia was, as usual, brilliant. Rhed Bustamante, you will always be a star.This might be the longest entry in my letterboxd rn. I'll end it with: COMPREHENSIVE SEX EDUCATION NOW!! LEGALIZE ABORTION!!!",5

Sunshine,"Bilang isang babae sa pilipinas, isang kasabihan lagi ang nakatatak saakin — mahirap maging babae, at mas lalong mahirap maging babae sa pilipinas. growing up in this economy, this so called 'religious country'. fuck that shit, fuck men, fuck this economy where women having a choice is considered illegal. Kapag ang isang lalaking nakabuntis sa isang babae, makakapili sila kung gusto nilang sustentuhan o panindigan ang nabuo nila. AT hindi sila matatawag ng kahit anong pangalan, hindi sila matatawag na mamatay tao, criminal, atbp. Putang-puta talaga ako na karamihan pa ng hindi sumasangayon sa abortion (kagaya ng tatay ni miggy) ay mga lalaki na akala mo'y may mga matres. WAG BUMOSES ANG WALANG MATRES. I love this film. the cinematography, kitang kita ang gulo sa maynila, the hospitals, ang boses ng bawat babaeng nasa pelikula.

Sunshine,"kahit hindi nila naiintindihan, gets ko",0
Sunshine,"One thing I like about Sunshine is its brazen risk to center the story on a 19-year old who's made consequentially irresponsible choices. It's a gambit that can easily be -- and, judging by discussions surrounding this movie, has already been -- misconstrued as a lesson on the importance of hammering down our society's puritanical views on sex and reproductive health to set teenage girls straight. That, somehow, Sunshine is a lesson in, as the elders say, ""opening your legs for just about anybody""; that she did not listen to the adage is an absolute failing on her part, and its consequences fall rightfully on her shoulders. But here's the tricky bit: Sunshine could very well have been about a mother who could no longer give birth to another, and it would have still been met with the same logic-defying resistance that still places the blame squarely on the woman. Minor gripes include a finicky plot device that, at times, feels jarring and slightly questionable in terms of messaging. But it all feels egregious to say because the urgency of its existence really dwarfs over whatever minor flaws it may have. It also helps that Sunshine carried is so deftly by Maris Racal's and Jennica Garcia's career-defining performances, and a score by Rico Blanco that knows how to restrain and reintroduce itself in all the right moments.Sunshine cracks open a conversation on an obstinately immovable subject, and unflinchingly exposes the grim reality on how our women and girls move about our society, bearing the problems that we could easily find solutions to but which our religious guilt and intolerance constantly shame us into denying.",20

Sunshine,"Direk Tonet did it again! Sobrang painful and disturbing ng movie na ito (at least for me) but it only shows how exactly why a woman should never shrink herself to what society wants women to endure. Hindi palaging babae ang magpaparaya at mag aadjust; her body, her choice. ",-1
Sunshine,"“Naiintindihan mo ba ‘ko?”“Gets ko na. Gets ko na. Gets ko na.”haaaaaay nako. thank you papa God for women; for their lives and their bodies that carry the world. despite women being the strongest people put into this place we live in, they do not need to put up with everything—it’s okay to say “no!” such a good film :)",-1
Sunshine,This is an additional reason of why i hate men.,22
Sunshine,"gets na gets na yung hype for Sunshine, naiyak akothis film really opened up a lot of heavy conversations regarding controversial topics that, up to this day, are still very hard to be tackled in our country where most minds are still enveloped by conservative ideologies that have been long influenced by religious policies.the message is straightforward and clear. it showed us the reality of women alike that had to endure the consequences of the patriarchal oppression and the dominance of Catholicism in the country, which is something that the rightists would undoubtedly refuse to accept because they'd still believe their presumed ""norms"" are what they think what's ""best"" for everyone and in the country — which is so out of touch from reality and it's very frustrating.however, i just had a bit of a problem with the film's inclusion of imaginary children; which i think somehow holds it back from letting the main message have its full weight. i get that they were used as some kind of a metaphor or a device for the plot, but something with it troubles me for reasons i can't quite best explain yet.but all in all, i really commend the bold attempts they did for this film. still a solid gem for Philippine contemporary cinema that's deserving to be watched by so many",28
Sunshine,TANGINA I-LEGALIZE ABORTION SA PILIPINASpati sana tigilan na yang pagkapit sa religion lalo na kung sapalaran ng bata in the future ang mananagot,4
Sunshine,"This is such a wake-up call about how dangerous abortion can be when it’s not done safely. That’s why we really need to legalize abortion, so women can have the option and so it can be done medically and safely. It’s funny how all the men in the movie reflect real life, where they don’t have a fucking ounce of understanding about women’s reproductive health. This also reflects how men often dictate the legalization of abortion when they shouldn’t, because they don’t even have a fucking UTERUS!Also, fuck that old doctor. Holier-than-thou people are the most hypocritical pieces of shit. Instead of empathizing with Sunshine, she had the audacity to take the religious route.The storyline of the thirteen-year-old also shows that people should not have a child if they cannot fucking provide and protect. It reflects our current society especially the poor children whose parents are pieces of shit. And that’s exactly why abortion should be legalized so women can have the option if they are not ready. Just look at her life; she was born to a mother who doesn’t care and a rapist uncle who should be imprison.Why the fuck is the Philippines so backward? Fuck all the corrupt politicians. Also, what the fuck was that male doctor doing denying care to a child whose life was at stake because of the abortion? Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t think that happens in real life. Doctors should save a patient regardless of whether it was due to an abortion, especially when the patient is critical. As a healthcare worker, I have never witnessed a doctor deny care to a critical patient.Despite her issues, MARIS RACAL ALWAYS DELIVERS!",5

Sunshine,"sadly, the country is still far from being progressive, especially with topics like abortion, since the stances of some are rooted in religion. one thing i didn't understand is the character progression of the kid. at the beginning of the film, she is clearly against abortion. however, we saw that her opinions changed (because she saw that sunshine doesn't want to become a mom) when ariana was introduced, where she mentioned that she and sunshine both share the same dream,…",5
Sunshine,"My favorite scene was when sunshine hit fucking bobot’s head with a beer bottle like YES DO IT AGAINI kid u not I kept screaming “more!!!!” when that scene played outOn a real note tho, loved the fact that this film showed the reality of unwanted pregnancies, especially in the philippines. Deducted one star bc it could’ve been longer. Don’t get me wrong, as someone with a short attention span, 1 hr and 30 mins is such a perfect duration, but I feel like with this kind of storyline, the issue tackled is so important that it deserves to be longer than that",-1
Sunshine,"the premise alone is enough for me to give it a full rating. to come up with a movie about one of the most taboo topics in this predominantly catholic country—given how conservative almost everyone is about it, how it’s actively vilified and condemned, how those who seek it are treated as no better than murderers, and how women are left to fend for themselves and look for alternative ways, whether through an underground clinic, safe or unsafe, or a seller’s comforting words when you don’t even know if the medicine will work—is a huge feat. it has been long overdue, but this is already a big step for everyone. abortion is, and will always be, healthcare.film-wise though, i absolutely LOVE the color grading. i usually hate SOME filipino movies (omg i’m sorryyyy) because the coloring pisses me off (like ik we can do better). idk how to pinpoint what gives me the ick but,,, yeah. sunshine’s though was nice. and it was a delight to see bits of manila’s vibe. always shady, dirty, BUT well, that’s our country and i loved the actual showcase of it. there were some symbolism and stills of how ironic some scenes can be too!! nice touch :) from the pills next to the statues to the jeepney signs. the plot is predictable for me (re: what those kids are), but not in a bad way. it just shows that it’s working, and i feel seen. a lot of women will feel seen. not saying we went through the exact same thing, but generally, the gist of thinking your life is over, or will be if it does happen, because we don’t have a choice in the first place, and are expected to just live with it, is familiar. the amount of mental gymnastics people will spew about “the future of the children,” how they could be “the next inventor of a cure,” while never considering the mother, who has her own ambitions, who has to give birth, raise the child, and provide the system and support for their hypothesis to even happen… it’s all broken-record arguments. these are the usual lines they’ll say, and some of their reactions (doctors, friends, “partners”) really DO HAPPEN irl and it’s proof that the film is heavily based from real experiences, and well researched enough about the actual process people will go through (and went through) for this. here’s to shed light, to inform, and hopefully, to make people more open, thoughtful, and willing to give women the autonomy they deserve.mic drop",28

Sunshine,"I can't find a good line from this film to be quoted lol.I watched this because of the hype on the internet, so I guess I expected more from this movie. I saw the vision of what the story was to show, but it felt flat. The movie opened so many issues to tackle but it really failed to explain them. The story itself lacked sex education too. What do you mean you want to tell the viewers you are pro-abortion, but here's the (imaginary) kid talking to Sunshine as if she's her conscience just to mess with her decision to abort? It shows how conservative our country is, yes, but the eagerness to change the mindset of the viewers is nowhere to be found.Also, the kids cursing throughout the entire movie is unnecessary lmao.Overhyped, I guess.",5

Sunshine,"Finally a film that depicts the reality of unwanted pregnancy. It’s more than just dreams being unattainable, people stereotyping you including yourself, other people making decisions for you as if it’s their life. But it’s also about the lack of safe and available procedure for people like sunshine and mary grace. There’s this one scene that made me giggle haha. The jeepney signage saying “Gift of God” stoping in a “no unloading” sign. I also love that they give the possible future kids a face. Something i think that helped sunshine solidify her decision.Ang hirap lang kase masyadong ipokrito and mga pilipino na kesyo masama ang magpalaglag ng bata, bawal maghiwalay ang pinagsama ng Diyos pero karamihan din sa mga yan sumusuporta sa mamamatay tao.",5

HINDI SIYA MADALI, lalo na if may iba pang circumstances na kailangan tignan. sana magets ng mga close-minded people yung point pag pinanood nila.kung iisipin, buhay ng isang babae in real life ang buhay ni sunshine sa pelikula. pero kahit nakikita natin si sunshine sa ordinaryong Pilipina, napakahirap pa rin ng conversation surrounding abortion. kaya ang tapang talaga ng movie for inviting discussion on this topic.hindi ko nagets at first pero i appreciate how the kid represented her unborn child. ang ganda nung ""yung pangarap ko, kung ano ang pangarap niya"" nakakaiyak...ang galing galing galing ni maris racal!!!!!gets ko na :)",3

This film is showing whats it like to be a woman in a fucking religious hypocrite country. Ang daling sabihin na kasalanan sa diyos ang magpalaglag. Ang daling sabihin na ipagpatuloy ng isang babae ang pagbubuntis. Pero napakahirap gampanan ang tungkulin bilang isang ina kung hindo mo ginusto maging nanay. Should we turn a blind eye to those who where raped? But do we just wait for someone to violate a womans body just so she could have a choice? To those woman who doesn't have the resources to birth a child in this fucked up world? In this economy? Those without a partner or family to support them? Should doctors turn a blind eye to this problem?Making abortions illegal does not stop abortions, it just forces a lot of woman to get unsafe ones.",-1

Sunshine,"if there is light, kahit konting-konti lang, we chase it—because sometimes that’s the only thing left for women to hold.sunshine (2025) is the kind of film na hindi ka pinapa-wow sa effects or spectacle. instead, it sits beside you quietly, like a friend na alam lahat ng pagod mo kahit hindi mo sinabi. it’s woman-centered in the most unsettling, honest way—walang sugarcoating, walang mythologizing, just the raw truth of being a girl in a country that asks you to endure more than it ever protects.the film strips away the usual softness associated with its title. sunshine isn’t light; she’s a girl trying to survive a world that keeps dimming her. and when the story touches the issue of abortion not being legalized in the Philippines, it doesn’t sensationalize it—pinapakita lang niya ‘yung totoo: na in this country, women are expected to carry consequences alone. that reproductive rights become moral battles instead of health and safety; na the system treats our pain like an inconvenience, our choices like crimes.‘yung internal struggle ni Sunshine—‘yung fear, guilt, confusion, desperation—hindi dahil “mahina siya,” but because society makes women feel cornered by circumstances we never chose. and the film doesn’t villainize her for thinking about her future; it villainizes the world that forces her to justify wanting one.and then there’s Miggy.Miggy is… familiar. not evil, not abusive, just painfully typical. he represents the kind of boyfriend most girls in the philippines know too well—the one who “cares,” but only until it requires accountability. the boy who says “I’m here for you” pero umiilag sa big conversations. the boy who loves you but doesn’t understand the weight you carry because he’s never had to carry anything like it.Miggy is the embodiment of how boys in this country are raised: may freedom without consequence, may opinion without knowledge, may presence without responsibility. his reactions, his avoidance, even his attempts to comfort—they feel real because they’re exactly what so many girls have lived through. boys who think support is just saying “kaya natin ’to” while leaving the actual pain to us.sunshine 2025 becomes a commentary on how women are taught to be accountable for everything—including mistakes that weren’t only theirs—while men are taught to be forgiven for everything. the movie doesn’t hate Miggy; it exposes him. it shows the casualness of male privilege, the way it slips into daily life unnoticed but heavy—always heavy—on our side.and that’s what makes the film hit: it’s not loud, not preachy, not dramatic. it just shows the truth—and the truth is already loud enough.sunshine isn’t a story about brightness; it’s a story about women trying to navigate a world that refuses to make space for their choices, their fears, their bodies, their futures. it’s a film that says:the pain wasn’t yours alone, but somehow, you were the only one expected to carry it.and long after the credits, you’re left with that hurt—the kind that reminds you why we keep fighting for a world where women don’t have to beg for the right to their own lives.",-1

Parang napakalaking kasalanan na ayaw mong maging nanay, worse when andyan na and you want to get rid of it. Tapos mga sagrado katoliko pa na pinipilit 'yung aral ng dyos na di naman nila sinusunod lang din. Mga putanginang hipokrito na ang daming sinasabi against women's rights pero tameme pag naabuso human rights as a whole na. Ewan ko ba LECHENG mga tao yan. Akala ko rewatching this di na ako as maiiyak as the first time, di naman na nga pero ang lala pa rin ng iyak ko simula nung kay mary grace  Putangina nyong mga lalaki talagaAlso, super duper happy na mas accessible na yung film. Sana makareach sya ng wider audience pa at mamulat sila sa reyalidad na kinahaharap ng mga babae at kabataang babae.Just to reiterate, women OR girls, shouldn't feel guilty for wanting to get abortion. It doesn't matter if you got pregnant from abuse or if you willingly participated, kung ayaw mo edi ayaw mo. Tapos dapat ang usapan. Wala nang tanong tanong kung naabuso ka ba or kung ginusto mo ba. Ayaw mo ng bata. Wala na dapat karapatan magbigay ng opinion ang di naman kasali sa usapan. Your body, your choice, it should be that simple.",-1

""Do you fear God?"" ""This is illegal"" and no one would help us, They are just doing it out of spite. I hope this film will be an eye opener for all that, being a woman is like a curse that we deal with every day. Our body and our choice being judged.

Sunshine,"My thoughts? Decriminalized abortion. Yes to sex education. Fuck patriarchy and misogynistic mindset. Fuck pro-life purist and their hypocritical beliefs. FUCK THOSE MEN WHO ONLY KNOWS HOW TO STICK THEIR STINKY DICK AND JUST GET AWAY WITH IT!!!! FUCK SEXUAL PREDATORS!!!!!! Salot mga lalaki talaga. Kayong mga lalaki PRACTICE SAFE SEX kung di kayo ready mag-anak, my goodness. Women deserve to the liberty on choosing what they would do over their body without getting ostracized. Pucha, lalo lang napapahamak ang mga babae because they don't have a choice but seek for ""illegal"" means. Kudos to the Sunshine team!! Sobrang mind-blowing and mind-opening ng film. My teenage self would not believe I am saying all of this kase sobrang exposed ako sa propaganda about criminalizing and shaming teenage moms/pregnancy, whether they choose to keep it or not. Yun talaga ang reyalidad. I'm glad there are films like Sunshine na eye-opener sa ganitong sensitive and important topic.Para sa kababaihan at para sa pangarap.",4

Sunshine,"Ang hirap mangarap sa pilipinas, at mas lalong mahirap maging babaeng nangangarap sa pilipinas. Here, our dreams can be taken away in just one snap. The hardship every woman face in this country was shown in this movie — everything in every angle. From the lack of support from the government, the inequalities women face, how fucked up the mentalities of most of the Filipinos, struggles in the face of poverty, to the fragility of our dreams. ""Libre lang mangarap"" they say, but it's not really free when you live in this country. It costs you your dignity, and even your life.---- I just know na I chose Humanities and Social Sciences to broaden up my understanding, perspective, and empathy like how this movie exposed and depicted our reality. We all need exposure to learn, since parang hindi sapat yung everyday witnessed struggles nating mga Pilipino, let this movie open your eyes on how f-ed up our system in this country really is.

Sunshine,"Sunshine (2024) is the most needed Filipino film of our generation and the generations to come. Beyond the excellent storytelling and technicalities, the message it conveys in a predominantly Catholic & conservative country is a long-overdue revelation of the reality of women.The film opens conversations for the uncomfortable truth of human nature. This is not just Sunshine's story. This is also the story of every woman and every young girl who face the challenges of being silenced and whose rights are being dictated and stepped on by our society.Maris perfectly portrayed Sunshine as a woman who knows what she wants and realizes the power that she and every other woman should have.The rest of the cast realistically depicted the Filipino society that reflects their morals on the teachings of Christianity. Moreover, the two ""imaginary"" characters brought life to the film by displaying the faces behind the masked moralities our society tells us.As a child of unwanted birth and as an adoptee, I know deep in my heart how much I advocate for abortion. I will always side with what is just and right; the ability of women to have access to reproductive health and the power of women to make decisions for their own life.Maraming salamat sa tapang at galing mo, Direk Tonet.",12

Sunshine,"I honestly thought the ending would be her choosing to keep the baby and proving that even as a mother, she could still be a gymnast. I’m glad she chose herself instead. Their body, their choice. I love this—Gets ko na.",-1
Sunshine,"I watched this film with my very religious family. I didn't say a word the whole duration of the film— yet every few minutes, without fail, at least one of my family members would nag me about teenage pregnancy and promiscuity. I heard countless demeaning phrases like ""kita mo yan? alam mo na ha, pag ikaw"" and ""san ka pupulutin kung di namin sinasabi sayo 'to?"". I'm 15, they don't even let me watch movies with sex scenes on the family tv. (but obviously i still do watch movies beyond my age rating) The overbearing nature of religion is truly a problem in the philippines; and among our people, the vast majority of our country is made up of catholics, and it seems like the state is sometimes one with the church because of that fact. I commend this movie for being a step in the right direction. It's showing the true nature of these things to our often ignorant and close-minded society. I know it's still a long way to a progressive philippines, but atleast i know there are still measures being made to ensure that we will get there. Someday, somehow.",-1

Sunshine,"Authentic depiction of how the female reproductive health is viewed and discussed in the Philippines. It is terrifying and undeniably demeaning that many, if not all, do not have access to these basic rights and thus continue to endanger the lives of many women out there. It is more infuriating to know that this also includes children as young as 13. Though this inclusion in the film may seem minor, it actually emphasizes that not being able to be given a choice to our own body steals our futures away.I also liked the nuances and subtle details that made this film feel more humane and relatable, including the motto etched on the Jeepney Sunshine rode when she found out she was pregnant, which was “GIFT OF GOD.” Hands down, Maris Rascal nailed this role. Those facial expressions? Period. Bonus na rin appearance ni Piolo Pascual.I could yap about this film but for the sake of my fingers typing this review, I’ll leave this as it is for now.All in all, this one is a great watch.",-1

Maris Racal at her best, a grounded and sincere performance.

Sunshine,"Nadama ko sa pelikula na mag-isa si Sunshine sa kanyang tinatahak ngunit nadama ko din na may iilang sumoporta sa kanya at ito ay mga kapwa kababaihan.Ito ang mga babae sa istorya na tumatak para sa akin: Sa eksena kung saan tinanggihan ng isang lalaking doctor i-attend ang batang nag pahilot sa takot na mawalan siya ng lisensiya at isang babaeng doctor ang nag lakas loob na tulungan ang bata. Ito ay realidad na ang batas sa bansang ito ay nakaka apekto sa pag lilingkod kapwa. Ang ate ni Sunshine na inintindi at sinuportohan hindi lamang ang desisyon kundi ang pangarap ni Sunshine. Malaking aspeto ang pagkakaroon ng kapamilya na hindi ka i-guiguilt trip o susumbatan ka sa nagawa mo, bagkus nag tiwala siya na alam ni Sunshine kung ano ang makakabuti para sa sarili niya. Ang imaginary child na nag boses na gets niya ang alab sa puso na makamit ang pangarap ni Sunshine. Sa tanong na who will protect women? Ang sagot ay tayo. Tayong kapwa kababaihan ang palaging tumutulong sa isa't isa dahil alam natin ang bigat ng mundong pasan pasan natin. Sa bansang hindi prayoridad ang kalusugan ng kababaihan, napakita ng pelikulang ito ang realidad ng isang babae kakapit sa kung anong meron sa paligid niya na paraan para mag palaglag dahil pinag kakait sa atin ang accessible healthcare. Ang pelikulang ito ay para sa lahat ng kababaihan na tahimik lumalaban sa ingay ng paligid na palaging may kuda sa kung anong daan ang dapat nating tahakin.",3
Sunshine,I LOVE LOVE THIS FILM SO MUCH especially the fact this fucking country’s laws nor pov is solely based on religion (the way that abortion is still unlegalized since it’s considered murder at bawal sa batas ng diyos). I like how realistic sunshine waa throughout the film and fuck miggs for almost ruining sunshine’s life smh,5
Sunshine,"alam mo ung line sa pelikula na “drown out the noise”? grabe teh!!! hindi lang siya tungkol sa literal na ingay,, it’s the kind of noise na araw-araw nating dinadala bilang babae — yung ingay ng expectations, ng moralism, ng judgment, ng kung sino-sinong feeling entitled magsabi kung ano dapat gawin sa katawan natin. at ang lakas, ang gulo, ang bigat niyang lunurin.pero habang pinapanood ko ang Sunshine, doon ko talaga naramdaman na,, ang hirap na ngang mabuhay bilang babae… tapos nasa Pilipinas ka pa.hindii basta hirap na surface level — but that kind of struggle na nakakadrain sa pagkatao mo. ung bawat galaw mo, may mata. bawat desisyon mo, may opinyon. bawat pangarap mo, may kapalit na moral judgment. ung tipong ikaw ang may katawan, pero hindi ikaw ang may pinaka-malakas na boses tungkol dito.&&& watching sunshine, parang may kirot na very familiar,, hueyyy!!! yung struggle ni Sunshine? hindi siya layo sa totoong nararanasan ng maraming babae.yng pagpili sa sarili kahit lahat ng tao around you sinasabi kung ano dapat mong gawin. ung bigat ng moralistic expectations.YUNG TAKOT!!!! YUNG GUILT !!!!!!! YUNG SHAME!!! na hindi naman dapat sa’yo ibinibigay pero ikaw ang nagdadala.kaya naman isa malaking PUTANGINA TALAGA NG MGA LALAKI (no explanation needed)pero ang powerful dito,, pinapakita ng pelikula na kahit gaano kaingay, kahit gaano kagulo — may karapatan kang piliin ang sarili mo.at gaya ng bata “yung pangarap ko, kung ano ang pangarap niya"" at “gets ko na.”",-1

Sunshine,"Grabe napaiyak naman ako nito. Although I have personal reservations about Maris Racal due to past issues, her performance in this film was undeniably amazing. Sunshine is a definite eye-opener regarding religion, stigma, and the taboo surrounding abortion matters here in the Philippines.I genuinely feel for all the women represented by the characters of Sunshine and Rhed. They may have different names, but they share a rough, unfair path: being stigmatized and pressured to conform to religious and misogynistic beliefs about motherhood. They are forced into the role of nurturing a child, often without considering their own agency.I particularly noticed the scene when Miggy and his father confronted Sunshine about her situation. They never once asked her what she wanted. Their ""plans"" were simply laid out for her to accept without a word, effectively depriving her of choice. This lack of genuine care is what hurts. Furthermore, the film shows how these women are forced to go through dangerous and unhygienic lengths just to pursue their personal dreams, highlighting how their rights as human beings are limited solely because of their CHOICE.I appreciate this film immensely, and it should be talked about more. The tragic reality of Rhed’s character, a 13-year-old victim raped and impregnated by her own uncle, is a situation faced by many. Yet, victims like her are still discriminated against for wanting an abortion. The movie effectively represents this toxicity, such as the scene where the OB-GYN cruelly orders a literally pale and blue Sunshine to ""repent"" while she is struggling in a hospital bed.This film is beautifully made. I sincerely hope that someday, people will truly receive the message: Every woman should have a choice. Depriving them of that fundamental choice does NOT make one a saint.",-1
Sunshine,"2nd time around, and yes, iba talaga ang tama ng movie pag paulit ulit mo siyang pinapanood",-1
Sunshine,"Watched this before sa sinehan and with the netflix release, had the chance to watch it again alone and at home (can repeat scenes too).It's as good as I remember. It challenges the foundation of this county's backwards and outdated beliefs — the very fact that we are willing, as a nation, to limit what an individual, specifically, a woman's decisions with what she wants do to her own body even if it means them harm just to hold up centuries-old ideals, because what, we want to feel righteous and good people? This kind of shit is barbaric and has no place in the current state of the world. The ending was very powerful. The gymnasium scene where sunshine could be herself: free from the shackles of the patriarchy, is something that brought tears to my eyes. However, I feel like final final scene was unnecessary, it could have ended with the ""gets ko na"" scene.Jesus, Pilipinas. Do fucking better. Protect your citizens. Protect women.",-1
Sunshine,ariana what are you doing here?,-1
Sunshine,"Gets ko si Sunshine.This film really captures me the most. As a woman who grew up in a most conservative country and a religious family, I feel the comfort of the movie. I know that tackling this kind of topic would raise brows to the people especially the one who’s spirituality believes that a women shouldn’t undergo abortion even if she really didn’t want to bear the child. Actually, it’s even funnier that this country preach that abortion should ban but the truth is there is a lack of education about sex, abortion, and contraceptives. Additionally, it’s so hypocrisy and misogynistic that people really blame woman for getting pregnant but NOT THE MAN?! In fact, they are the ones who put babies inside the woman’s womb. I really learned so many lessons in the movie which open my mind to the struggles of a woman. It’s disappointing that people keep preaching what’s right or wrong but THEY NEVER HELP AND UNDERSTAND THESE WOMEN. The movie open my mind that abortion SHOULD BE LEGALIZE. Abortion ISN’T a sin, murder, nor crime. IT’S A HEALTH CARE. It’s NOT selfish. It’s okay.But it is just sad that the Philippines is not yet ready to understand and tackle this kind of topic. I get Sunshine. The guilt-tripping, shame, and misogyny are tackled in a best possible way to give the viewers assurance and comfort. Also, it gives reminder that Filipinos should really open their minds and change their mindset. Women didn’t deserve the shame, the hate, and mostly the expectations that have been throwing to them just because THEY ARE WOMEN. For fucking sake. WOMEN NEED SUPPORT NOT A FUCKING JUDGEMENT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO’S CLAIMING TO BE A SPIRITUALLY ACTIVE BUT CANNOT OPEN THEIR MINDS AND THINK RIGHT.I hope and wish that the government legalize abortion. It is not a shameful thing to do. It is not killing. It is a self-care — A HEALTH CARE. People should know and understand that.Overall, I really love the movie and it will have a special place in my heart. I hope, Filipino directors would produce many movies like this to promote woman and to educate people that abortion is a health care.",5

NAPAKAGALING SO MUCH NG LAHAT AS IN !!!",6
Sunshine,"I have so much to say about this movie. Grabe. The story, the cinematography, the acting—everything, just wow. This movie is so impactful, and it felt surreal as it is totally happening in this country right now. Kuhang kuha yung reyalidad sa bawat buhay ng mga Pilipino, sa mga babaeng pinagkaitan ng sariling desisyon sa kanilang sariling mga katawan. As a person who agrees about legalising abortion in this country/pro choice, the religious people who tried to convince Shine and even made her feel guilty about aborting her baby triggered me so much. Dahil lamang sa relihiyosong paniniwala, o konsensya? I get it, it is a sin and it is evil thing to do. But what's more evil is that producing an unwanted child out of guilt into this world. Sunshine wasn't ready to be a mother, she still has dreams to follow, and she has the right to make a decision for her own life, own good, and own satisfaction. Miggy didn't even felt responsible for that child. He only got scared of his pastor father who is also a manipulative religious man. Smh. Men will be a horndog and disappear, yet it's their sperm that made that baby.  Yes, raw sex is pleasuring. But the thought or risk of producing a child habang hindi ka pa handa maging magulang ay dapat lamang na mas nangingibabaw sa kagustuhan mong masatisfy sexually. I hope people are aware of the consequences of their action before doing something because it's a big responsibility.I love this movie so much. Grabe kuhang kuha lahat, mga kaganapan sa maynila, mga black market, mga bawat sulok o tindahan sa quiapo, mga taong hindi nauubusan ng pag asa mabuhay sa kabila ng kahirapan ng buhay, mga batang kalye na nangangarap, at ang mga kinabukasan na naghihintay para sa kanila.I had goosebumps about Annika's representation in the movie. I thought she was the younger Sunshine  I just realized that she's the child that shine could've had. Now I know why she always appears around her, and make her feel guilty, and understood her in the end.I love this movie so much! I hope this will be an eye opener to those imbecile peeps lol, and ofc the government. Abortion should be legal, especially if it'll be processed by the law too. Irresponsible people should not be punished by forcing them to keep the child. Because only the child will suffer throughout their lives. There are for sure a lot of an unwanted pregnancies situation, not only by not using condom but could be also by a failed contraceptives, or lack of knowledge about the reproductive system. Restricting abortion doesn't really promote responsibility—it just punished people for circumstances that are often beyond their control, and women will always be left with no choice but to abort an unwanted child in a harmful way.",5

Sunshine,"kudos kay dir. jadaone kasi bihira lang ‘yung ganitong ingay sa filipino cinema, buti na lang walang twitter mga matatanda baka ma-cancel pa ‘yan siya lolanyway, kahit baliktarin mo man ang mundo, walang mawawala sa lalaki when he engages in coitus—kahit pa makabuntis ito. and, the film gave us this statement as it is. moreover, it exactly depicts how our society reacts when a woman participtes in sexual intercourse: bawal, nakakahiya, nakakawala ng dignidad. that our society reinforces this same tired belief: kapag babae ang nagkamali, pangalan at pangarap niya ang nakataya.nakakairita kasi napakatotoo, “mag-iingat ka,” “isipin mo lagi ‘yung future mo—‘yung pamilya mo,” “tandaan mo na ‘yang virginity mo ang pinakamagandang maireregalo mo sa asawa mo,” mga katagang palagi mo maririnig kapag babae ka pero ni isang beses hindi ibubulong sa isang lalaki. nakakainis kasi hindi siya exaggerated, it’s not melodramatic, it’s reality. the silent judgment, the unsolicited advice of people, and the casual sexism na parang background noise ng buhay ng babae. it makes the audience uncomfortable, distressed, and painfully aware of how familiar everything is.ang ganda lang kasi it’s not about regret, rather it’s reclamation. it gives you this dichotomy between burden and freedom, as well as give you the raw and aching truth na nakakagalit, nakakaiyak, nakakaputangina kasi bakit hanggang ngayon ganito pa rin?ay, putangina rin ng mga lalaki, putangina ng mga hindi naniniwala na virginity is a social construct that’s used as a tool for the patriarchy to label a woman’s dignity, putangina ng mga hindi hinahayaang magkaroon ng bodily autonomy ang mga babae. legalize abortion at sorry papa god sa bad wordssana gets",-1

Sunshine,"Ini menurutku tipe film yang sederhana tapi ngangkat tema yang ckup berat. tentang cewe cantik bernama sunshine yang hidupnya berantakan tapi tetap berusaha ngejar mimpinya, sambil harus ngadepin fakta klo dia hamidun, dia depresi sampai sempat ingin aborsi dgn cara yang nekat. Aku sebenarnya di awal2 agak confuse dgn anak kecil yang mengikuti sunshine trasa ambigu kek dia tuh kesannya cuma bayangan doang dan orang lain kyk gak bisa ngliat…Yahh tidak bisa menyalahkan 1 pihak aj menurutku krna mereka lakukan “hal itu” kemungkinan atas kemauan mereka berdua sendiri, namun juga bisa jadi biasanya pihak cwo yang ngrayu2, ya beginilah efek dari pergaulan bebas.Di endingnya barulah sdkit jelas anak kecil yng tdinya ngikuti sunshine memeluk sunshine sambil ngungkapin soal dirinya itu siapa, ini open ending si masuknya.Btw kmu imut bgt sunshine ",-1

Sunshine,encapsulates the feelings of a woman with dreams and passion. very brave movie,-1
Sunshine,"one of the best filipino movies this year!!!! i’m glad it tackles the religious guilt that comes with teenage pregnancy and the fact that reproductive rights are so limited in the philippines, specifically for women. thankfully, it’s not one of those pro-life movies that disregard a woman’s career for the sake of an unborn child.to quote from the movie: “i just don’t want to be a mother. why should that involve any of you?”great watch!!!!",-1
Sunshine,"From the very beginning, the film doesn’t sugarcoat anything. It throws you straight into the raw, unfiltered reality of the city. You feel the noise, the chaos, the sense of being overwhelmed, like you’re standing right in the middle of it all.Pero beyond the city’s noise, Sunshine digs into something heavier. It shows the weight of Sunshine’s struggle, the clash between personal pain, religious expectations, and society’s harsh judgment. The movie doesn’t shy away from the reality na hanggang ngayon, ang hirap mag-access ng abortion services sa Pilipinas dahil illegal pa rin ito. It captures how isolating it is to face a problem this heavy, and how hard it is to seek help in a system that refuses to understand.Overall, I like it.",-1
Sunshine,i love how the noise of manila mirrors the noise inside sunshine’s own thoughts and decisions. how the kid represents her unborn child. how her sister shows her the reality of becoming a mother. and how the world becomes quiet and peaceful once she finally learns to silence the noise and listen to what she truly wants. all of it builds beautifully to that final scene!,12

Sunshine,"people may not forgive sunshine, but the most important here is that, sunshine forgave herself :) naiyak ako sa scene ni rhed (mary grace), this film just shows reality, nakakaawa ang mga batang nakaranas ng ganito, what even more sad here is that kung sino pa yung dapat tumulong sila pa yung kitid ang utak. Nakakainis yung bobot na yun at yung mga doctor, wala namang masama if you're a Christian and a doctor pero wag nyong idamay yung pagiging relihiyoso sa mga gamitong sitwasyon, government and religion are not the ones who should decide what a girl should do with her body ! that is just so stupid.ps. may araw karin sakin bobot",-1
Sunshine,"this kind of movies always makes me cry, especially when it’s set in the philippines, and somehow even if i do not exactly experience what sunshine feels, i relate to her in someway—the agony of being in a toxic expectations of the society despite your circumstances. sunshine, you are a reprensentation of glimmer and hope to me, and to the young filipino women.",12
Sunshine,putangina.,1
Sunshine,"A young aspiring teenage Filipino gymnast who everyone looks up to has been selected in the National team to participate in Olympics. Her nightmare begins when she finds out she is pregnant. Her boyfriend wants her to abort. Her best friend disowns her. She hallucinates a small girl chasing her around trying to make her feel guilty. Desperate to pursue her gymnastics career, she buys a product from the local black market. She rents a room in a shady inn, inserts the product and ends up bleeding profusely. She wakes up in an anti abortion clinic to learn that the fetus is still alive. ‘Sunshine’ plays out like a horror movie as the characters try to come to terms with their reality. The tension, fear and desperation is palpable. Sunshine’s journey from numb helplessness to a woman who wants to pursue her dreams is truly remarkable.Abortion is illegal in the Philippines under all circumstances, including rape, incest, or when the mother's life is at risk. Black markets of abortifacients thrive near places of worship and street side shops. Hospitals refuse admission and doctors perform secret illegal procedures. Antoinette Jadone’s writing and direction is raw and brutal. The narrative is neither preachy nor claims to know a solution to a complex problem that leaves women without agency. It simply critiques the situation and demands that viewers confront it along with women who are left helpless in front of politics and religion. Maris Racal pours her heart into the titular character and you would feel nothing but compassion and empathy for Sunshine Francisco.",17
Sunshine,"Barely ever climbs the mountain it wants to reach. May censorship issue talaga sa Filipino films 'no? Super evident niya. Commendable, however ang pag-build ni jadaone at ng cast ng emotional climate. Napaka-isolating maging isang babae. Everybody wants you until they realize tao ka lang din. Nasasaktan, nabubuntis, may sariling mga pangarap sa buhay. Kalungkot lang 'no ? Ilang dekada na ang nakalipas at paurong talaga tayo. Napakasimple na lang ng konsepto ng sunshine, ikinakagalit pa. Karamihan ay masyado pang bulag, malayo sa katotohanan na buhay at nangyayaring ganap sa lipunan.",-1

Sunshine,just bomb the whole country atp… they’re already killing all of us slowly like what’s the point idgaf start the rapture!!,27
Sunshine,"A woman should be entitled to make their own choice.I have a lot to say, but I would rather get to the point. In matters of abortion as a social issue, our country isn’t progressive. Abortion is healthcare.Raising a child takes more than just a responsibility. Time, effort, money and patience are one of the things a parent should provide, and honestly in this economy it’s hard to meet that requirement.",4
Sunshine,"sobrang tapang, sobrang lakas, my god this movie moves so much of my body that i just stood up clapping after watching it. THIS should be the topic people are talking about, should be focusing on, should be screaming about!! also the maternity ward scene screams so much womanhood and how much women struggle but still strive to persevere. I LOVE U SUNSHINE !! gets na gets kita!!",-1
Sunshine,"“Babae ka, hindi ka basta babae lang”this film is an eye opener especially to women who chose to pursue their dreams and decided not to have children because they know they’re not ready. Hats off to the director, producers, writers and to Maris Racal for sharing this masterpiece.Being born in a religious country is hard, but being a woman born in a religious country is harder :))To Sunshines out there, thank you for being brave, for prioritizing yourself and choosing career instead of raising children in this kind of economy and country. Gets ko, gets ko na :)",-1
Sunshine,gets ko sana magets din nila,0
Sunshine,"Strongly acted and emotionally charged, It beautifully captures the dilemmas and struggles that women face in a system that has not addressed modern issues. Though how the unborn children are presented in this film might raise questions, imo it doesn’t take away that this film is still a great attempt to start conversations about pro-choice.",5
Sunshine,"nawa'y makamit mo ang kalayaan sa pagpapahayag ng sarili mo, Sunshine!",2
Sunshine,"the movie started the complete opposite of its name, but eventually ended how it was meant to end. everything about it was phenomenal, siguro medyo oa ako pero ang ganda talaga. maris racal as sunshine was exceptional, can't imagine any pinay actress portraying the role. same with the role of ""bata."" the symbolism & meaning behind them really gave me goodebumps. tama nga, gets ko na. gets ko si sunshine. i recommend it so much ",-1

Sunshine,It was my dream too,-1
Sunshine,"quite on-the-nose with its metaphors and analogies but with the philippines you kind of have to in order to get it through to them that being able to choose what happens to your own body is a basic human right, kudos for the bravery in saying/showing things as it isfor all the young girls who have dreams, for everyone who had to grow up too fast, for everyone who doesn’t have the ‘luxury’ of choice. necessary viewing and a necessary conversation we need to be having morealso here: elijah canlas being typecast as the shitty boyfriend who doesn’t practise safe sex lmao",-1

Sunshine,"There’s always a thin, trembling line between a patriarchal society and the relentless social construct that insists women still can’t decide for themselves—least of all when it comes to their own bodies. And even if we try to drown out the noise, this film refuses to stay quiet. It hits too hard. It shows the very realities women go through in today’s world.What makes it even bolder is its willingness to be raw, relevant, and unapologetically confrontational in a country where abortion remains illegal. It doesn’t tiptoe. It doesn’t soften its edges. Instead, it stares straight into the contradictions of a culture that claims to protect life while silencing the ones who live it.",-1

Sunshine,"Whatever path you’ll choose, I’ll be by your side <3",-1
Sunshine,"The film should have done away with the little kid. She's a totally unnecessary plot device who is cringe and corny as hell. Sunshine would have been better off without the imaginary character. I get the idea on paper but damn, the kid's poorly written and her acting's pretty bad. Sayang! Most of film is fine, though it has some awkward moments Maris Racal, Jennica Garcia, and Meryll Soriano are absolutely fantastic but those with smaller roles can't act to save their asses. What's worse is they actually ruin what are supposed to have been great scenes. Their writing isn't as good as well but could've been salvageable if they had any talent. Sayang!",-1

Sunshine,"Dzamn love this film. Sobrang lungkot lang isipin na marami sa ating mga kababaihan specially mga kabataan ang nakakaranas ng ganito in real life. Hindi dahil sa nagkamali sila, hindi nag-ingat pero dahil na rin sa pang aabuso. Tulad ni sunshine sa huli, babae lagi ang dehado. Ang hirap maging babae sa third world country tulad ng pilipinas na hanggang ngayon ay illegal ang abortion. Walang proper sex education na dapat naitatalakay sa mga eskwelahan. Taboo at may stigma pa rin ang usapin sa abortion. I love this film because it shows not only the struggle but also a lot of the problems here in the Philippines. Pati na rin yung health care system and education. Nakakatawa lang na considered black market ang pagbebenta ng abortion pills pero na sa harap mismo ng simbahan tapos ang lakas mang guiltrip ng mga matatanda na kasalanan sa dyos ang magpalalaglag mga hipokrita!",-1

Sunshine,"Visceral, gut-wrenching, and politically relevant. Sunshine is not only a film about resilience, it’s a commentary on the disparity between human systems and human persons. When a system is run by patriarchal standards, women live life isolated or alienated by how she is defined.

Sunshine,"this is someone’s life right now. put yourself in their place.you can understand sunshine even if you’re not pregnant. even if you’re not a gymnast. even if you’re not joining the olympics. she’s a woman filled with rage, ambition, and dreams. in a place that reeks from layers of sweat, the stench of alcohol, noise, spit, and smoke—under the blazing sun and along filthy streets, sunshine keeps shining. she can carry herself even when only a few stand behind her. it’s hard to be a woman. it’s hard to live on your own. it’s hard to bear problems you never wanted in the first place. it’s hard to live comfortably when you don’t have the privilege to attain that right away. but if no one reaches for her hand, she’ll take her own. because her story isn’t about waiting for someone else to save her—it’s about uncovering the strength that has always been inside her.",17
Sunshine,"jadaone never fails to deliver a movie that starts strong but falls flat and chokes on the message it’s attempting to tell, whatever that may be. every story she writes is abysmal and surface level and almost always advocates for shallow feminism, hanggang doon nalang ba tayo? spouting for women’s rights without actually understanding the nuance of what you’re actually advocating for?maliban sa poverty porn na kinatutuwaan ipakita palagi ni jadaone, from fan girl to sunshine, she also likes showcasing sexual assault as a plot device, only this time it wasn’t shown to us explicitly—wow, how she’s advanced in her writing noh? (sarcasm meant)while i appreciate the gritty and emotional moments of the film especially when the focus is entirely on the movie’s protagonist who it’s named after (maris carried this entire film along with the supporting cast’s acting) it’s overshadowed by it’s dogshit abysmal surface level performative writing, its inclusion of imaginary children that is either a representation of the characters and their inner child or their unborn children which confuses and irritates me as they’re shown way too much, the on the nose messaging of conservatism in the philippines, the lack of detail on how important sunshine’s dream actually is because it focuses on another separate character that rids sunshine a chunk of her story and conflict, and the abstract, hollow message they’re trying to advocate for.genuinely, can we take the pen away from this grown ass woman? not only does she exploit the masa to serve her story but women as well, nakakabastos sa totoo lang, not very feminist and not very for the masa also—add to the fact that jadaone probably thinks that her audience is stupid and can’t read in between the lines for how she chooses to write the story. more actions, less words sana, more time spent in the writer’s room, less color-grading and filming quiapo’s slums for your poverty porn sana.i could say more but i’d have to give half a star at least for the cast’s amazing performances, they carried this film, and they deserve the recognition especially maris racal. also nagulat ako andito pala si piolo pascual haha.",-1
Sunshine,"""Yung pangarap ko, kung ano ang pangarap niya""it's such a brave move for anyone to take this on considering how against our country is in making abortion safe and legal ! sunshine is a beautiful film that depicts the reality of being a woman in this country. the philippines is not ready for this and it shows",13
Sunshine,"Hands down. One of the best filipino films I have ever seen.This deserves more than what I’ll write. More than the stars I’ve given. More than a mere category of ‘favorites’.This is worth talking about. The film I should see when tackling feminism. The film that shows how the Philippines lack support for its beautiful and brave women.Una sa lahat, fuck quiapo air. Quiapo—ang baho, ang sikip, ang init! Pero Quiapo… a place where you’ll find even the tiniest bit of hope, a place where even an ounce of solution can be found, a place where help exists, even if only through a few people.i also loved how fuckass men were portrayed in this movie. walang kwentang jowa, walang kwentang kapatid, walang kwentang tatay, walang kwentang tito, walang kwentang doktor. Tangina ang may kwentang lalaki lang ata rito is yung tricycle driver eh. Tangina ng mga lalaking ganyan. Patriarchy at its finest! Also, fuck women who let themselves be abused by this power. Yes, I’m talking about YOU nanay ni Mary Grace.as it progressed, onti-onti kong nararamdaman yung emotional sincerity ng film. yung dilemmas of decisions ni sunshine and yung heartbreaking truth about Mary Grace’s pregnancy. 13 years old pa lang siya? Yes, 13 years old pa lang siya. The movie refuses to romanticize their situation. instead, it leans into the uncomfortable truths of being a young woman in a society that praises discipline, resilience, and sacrifice yet offers little support when life derails. Director Jadaone shapes the film with a raw, documentary-like honesty: tight shots of silent breakdowns, stripped-down scenes with no dramatic score, and a narrative that mirrors the suffocating pressure placed on young Filipinas navigating taboo choices.Lastly, ang nagustuhan ko talaga sa film na to is the fact na the film didn’t fail to show and acknowledge the other women surrounding sunshine. women who, though not always in the spotlight, embody the many forms of pressure, expectation, and silent resilience that shape the world she moves in. they all carry their own versions of sacrifice: women praised for being disciplined, nurturing, and endlessly strong, yet rarely offered the same support they tirelessly give. like seriously? the maternity ward scene broke my heart so much  seeing allthe women sharing the same beds also shows how fucked up our healthcare system really is. Tayo-tayo lang rin nagtutulungan. Tayo lang ang sumusuporta sa isa’t isa. Tayo lang mga babae. Kudos to that tindera. Ironic lang na sa harap pa talaga ng mga rebulto ni santo niño nagtinda ng pampalaglag  these kinds of religious beliefs shouldn’t really hinder us from doing what’s right and best for ourselves. and in showing these women’s quiet struggles, the film expands its emotional weight, reminding us that the story isn’t just about one girl’s burden but about an entire generation of women expected to endure everything while being thanked for it in silence. kulang pa tayo sa pansin, sa pagmamahal, at sa suporta. i hope that someday, all of us can finally feel how to live as a woman and be loved as a woman.",-1

Sunshine,"Rewatched it and still felt underwhelmed. The trailer was so promising and I expected a lot. I’m all for it from what they’re trying to convey but the storytelling wasn’t it. Execution is realistic tho. I believe most of us relates in jeepney scene when you’re in the verge of breaking down and you don’t know what to do but to breathe slowly and comfort yourself, hoping no one would notice. Love the irony, the symbolism, and the heats.But then again, they be trying to highlight everything all at once but failed to deliver why we’re here in the first place. It was moving, as a woman. BUT AS A WOMAN I was hoping for a more impactful message since it opened a lot of discourse. Women are far more complex and I was looking for chaos in what a woman feels in a society where everyone are so entitled to decide on how a woman should act and carry themselves. The movie could’ve gone deeper, one that touches diff range of emotions. It just doesn’t feel genuine, yk.Overall, Im giving it 4 stars. Such a brave movie for a conservative country.",23

If they talk about it to an adult, they will likely get shamed for feeling that way when it happens. If they're going to keep abortion illegal, at least educate people properly to prevent it from happening, especially the guys, they should have consequences too. Women are more likely to be shamed than men because she's carrying the child, but the child is also part of the dad's dna. Especially those who are sick minded groomers, they definitely should be stricter and on the lookout for.",-1

Sunshine,"Kudos to Direk Tonet, Maris Racal, and the whole team responsible for creating this film, thank you for being brave and casting a light on our nation’s issues often overlooked in fear of the cultural taboo it carries. I would have rated it 5 stars, but the choice to represent Sunshine’s internal conflict with herself through a hallucinated child character doesn’t sit right with me. Jadaone’s direction results in jarring tonal shifts that muddle the film’s emotional center. What was perhaps intended as a bold attempt at cinematic expression to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour. It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility. In fact, by personifying an unborn child as a character which speaks and thinks, then Sunshine unintentionally reinforces the very moral framing that anti-abortion rhetoric thrives on. It circles back into the age-old “when does life begin?” debate—a question that continues to paralyze policymaking in the country, even when the conversation should be about autonomy, access, and proper healthcare. The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, frames it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics. Though, I will still give my flowers to this movie. It helped brought upon a conversation in our country long overdue and for that I am grateful. I hope it inspires other filmmakers to be bold in the face of a country that chooses to be blind to issues that continue to grow with no solutions in sight.",-1

Take away access and people will turn to dangerous methods.2. If you're young or not ready or do not have the capacity to give a child a good life, you shouldn't have to be forced to have a child 3. Some people are not fit to be a mother.4. Rape-related pregnancies should at the very very least be allowed to have abortion. Just imagine the trauma they're going through.5.

Sunshine,"people often judge teenage pregnancy as the result of “giving in to temptation,” but this film shows the other side—not all teenage pregnancies are wanted or chosen. what i love about the film is how powerful it is; it resonates deeply with viewers and delivers a clear message consistently from start to finish.maraming sunshine sa lipunan—na biglaan, takot, at walang lakas ng loob na harapin ang pagiging ina—pero hindi ito usapin na masama ng tao si sunshine kaagad nang dahil lamang sa hindi pa siya handa. a moment of temptation is not enough reason to demand she accept her situation, as forcing a woman into parenthood before she is ready is a far greater mistake.i hope this film opens more eyes and highlights the need to strengthen reproductive rights in our country, recognizing that abortion is a right for all women. men who cause pregnancies rarely face the same scrutiny or shame; women, on the other hand, bear society’s judgment alone.abortion is not always chosen for pleasure—often it is the result of abuse or exploitation.it is heartbreaking that in the philippines, a case of violence against women is reported every 57 minutes. globally, over 30% of women—more than 737 million—experience abuse from partners or non-partners. many feel trapped, unable to leave because they are pregnant and have no right to terminate.in february 2024, save the children urged stronger reproductive rights in the philippines, noting that 35% of filipino girls under 15 became pregnant from 2021 to 2022—clear victims of abuse and exploitation. this is a critical issue that the government must address.women have the right to control their own bodies and make their own choices—regardless of religion, culture, or social pressure. they are often the most vulnerable and left behind in such situations.thank you to sunshine for her courage in standing up for herself and pursuing her dreams, and thank you to the film for portraying these realities.as i read somewhere, “marami ang hindi mapapatawad si sunshine dahil sa ginawa niya, pero sapat naman nang napatawad ni sunshine ang sarili niya.”",5

Sunshine,"lahat ng tao ay may sariling ingay na tinatahak. sa pelikula, hindi lang ito ingay ng traffic o tambutso. ito yung ingay ng moralidad, ng tsismis, ng relihiyong mabilis magturo pero mabagal magmahal. ito yung ingay ng mga taong hindi naman mabubuhay sa katawan mo pero sila ang pinakamalakas magdikta kung ano ang dapat mong maramdaman, gawin, at piliin. at sa lahat ng ito, isang nineteen-year-old girl ang pasan ang mundo—a girl who should’ve been allowed to dream freely, pero sinasakal na ng lipunang takot sa kababaihang may sariling isip.isang bagay na ramdam mo agad sa pelikula: magkakampi ang mga babae. halos lahat ng karakter ay babae, at karamihan sa kanila may dalang munting piraso ng simpatya. isang kolektibong danas. isang unspoken sisterhood built on the multiple burdens that women carry: being caregivers, dreamers, breadwinners, shock absorbers of society’s cruelty. pero hindi rin romantisado ang pelikula—may mga babaeng kakampi, at may mga babaeng hindi. katulad ng doktor na ultraconservative, na nagpapaalala sa atin ng painful truth: hindi lahat ng babae ay mapagpalaya, at hindi lahat ng babae ay kakampi sa kapwa babae. minsan, ang mismong sistemang umaapi ay umiiral din sa mga babaeng natutong ipasa-pasa ang sakit.pinaka-mahalaga sa lahat: hindi totoong pagiging makasarili ang pagdedesisyon ng babae para sa sarili niyang katawan. kung may isang “gets ko na” moment ang sunshine, ito ‘yon. kung sarili lang niya ang iniisip niya, wala sana tayong ganitong pelikula. wala sana tayong ganitong lalim. pero ang totoo, bawat desisyon niya ay puno ng takot, pagmamahal, at pag-asa—lahat ng bagay na kinalimutan ng lipunan kapag babae ang may kailangan pumili.dito rin pumapasok ang simbolismo ng batang babae—ang unborn child, ang personified conscience. ariana is 13 y/o's own past self, her own fear, her own what-if. lahat ng interaction nila ay nangyayari “sa loob,” sa pinakatahimik na sulok ng isip ng babaeng hinahati ng daigdig. at nung ending, it’s for herself. the hug is acceptance. ang yakap na iyon ay tahimik na paglaya.pero kahit sa mundong pilit nagpapatahimik sa kababaihan, may irony na hindi kayang itago ang pelikula: sa isang konserbatibong lipunan, ang nagbebenta ng religious figures ay siya ring nagbebenta ng abortion pill. ang ob ay bigot. ang bahay ay hindi laging ligtas. ang simbahan ay humuhusga. at ang babae? wala man lang tunay na espasyo para huminga. bakit ang mga lalaki, may opsyon? bakit ang kababaihan, pilit pinapapili pero hindi ginagawaran ng tunay na choice?dito nagiging mas malakas si sunshine. hindi siya martyr. hindi siya sainted victim. she doesn’t just endure—she decides. she chooses herself kahit alam niyang bawat galaw niya may kasamang kurot ng panibagong judgment. she’s not fearless, but she moves anyway. at minsan, iyon na ang pinaka-matapang na pwedeng gawin ng babae sa bansang sobrang hilig kontrolin ang katawan at kinabukasan niya. dedma sa ingay. dedma sa prejudice. kung may pangarap ka, hawakan mo, kahit pa buong mundo pa ang naka abang na magkamali ka. ang sabi ni direk jadaone, ang pagbubuntis ay magbabago sa katawan ni sunshine, sa career niya, sa buong trajectory niya bilang atleta. at totoo—para kay sunshine, ang pregnancy ay literal career suicide. at dito umaalingawngaw ang tanong na gusto talagang ipukpok ng pelikula: bakit ba laging kababaihan ang kinakailangang magsakripisyo ng pangarap? bakit ang freedom ng babae ay laging conditional?kaya oo—decriminalize abortion. kasi ang autonomy ay hindi dapat ipinaglalaban, dapat innate. ang katawan ng babae ay hindi battleground para sa moralidad ng iba.in the end, sunshine reminds you that sometimes the bravest thing a girl can do is to choose herself, quietly, consistently, even when the world says she shouldn’t.",3

Really, this movie is so heavy for me—not in a negative way you know. Ang heavy niya kasi you’re looking and peeking through the life and struggles ng mga babaeng naiiwan kapag nabuntis, and that’s too painful kasi there’s no two sides of the coin na. A woman always left thorn between keeping her dreams or to be a mother, samantalang ‘yung nakabuntis, tangina, sasabihin hindi pa siya handa at sustento na lang ambag? Tangina. Every woman have the right to say na hindi rin siya handa sa ganitong mga circumstances. It’s her life.I hope it becomes an eye opener for every Filipino.

From secretive clinic visits to hushed conversations with unsympathetic adults— with Sunshine’s journey, you can feel the judgement of a society that constantly polices women’s bodies and their choices. Patriarchy is relentless : they leave it up to the women to pick up the pieces that the men shattered— ""Bahala ka na diyan, just get rid of it"". Maris Racal’s performance was exquisite, ramdam mo yung pagod, sakit, and overwhelming suffocation that Sunshine faces as she navigates through making a choice that is supposed to be hers and hers alone. Every flip, every landing, every stretch was a step towards her dreams— the stage, the recognition, the life she has ever envisioned for so long. Sunshine’s journey is not just about survival; it’s about the courage to continue dreaming in a world determined to limit her. Gymnastics wasn’t more than a sport, it was her identity, her sanctuary, the place that gave her hope to keep believing. At the end, pinili niya pangarap niya, despite the fear, the sadness, and the guilt, her decision was a refusal to let anyone dictate her future, to let her stop that dream.",-1

Sunshine,"Sobrang gets lang talaga ng palabas na ‘to, sana napanood ko siya on a bigger screen. Ang galing ni Maris Racal, totoo nga na the moment na alam niyang buntis siya, naka-autopilot na siya at alam niya na kung ano yung gusto niyang mangyari kahit na hindi niya alam kung paano. Sa totoo lang, isa sa scene na napatanong na lang talaga ako kung ano bang silbi talaga ng mga lalaki ay yung nasa hospital si Sunshine kasi dinala niya si Menggay doon, tapos ipinakita yung mga kama na kaunti lang ang espasyo sa isa’t isa, yung mga manganganak pa lang at nakapanganak ng mga babae na nag-uusap at nag-abutan ng gamit ng bata. Ewan ko, ang hirap manganak, ang hirap maging nanay, at ang hirap ng estado ng healthcare sa Pilipinas. Bukod pa roon, nandoon yung bigat tsaka ingay sa kabuuan ng palabas. Bigat nung dinadala ni Sunshine bilang babae na hindi suportado ng karamihan ang pagpapalaglag dahil tayo ay nasa isang relihiyosong bansa. Yung ingay sa paligid, yung mga dasal, yung desperasyon, yung konsensya habang paikot-ikot siya para lang makahanap ng solusyon. Ayun, sana naman mas mapag-usapan pa ang reproductive health ng mga kababaihan sa Pilipinas, and yes decriminalize abortion.",-1

Sunshine,"It’s a film about women — their suffering, their heartbreak, their impossible choices — in a society that pretends to protect them yet refuses to listen to them. Especially when it comes to abortion, the film exposes how cruel a world can be when faith is used not for compassion, but for judgment.Ang lalim ng emosyon sa bawat eksena. Just the truth, plain and heavy. The kind that sits on your chest long after the lights come up.Maris delivers a performance that feels painfully honest. Ang galing ni Maris, and I’ve never doubted her talent, pero dito she carries a story so much bigger than her character — a story shared by countless women who are tired of being silenced.At Maraming salamat sa sining mo, Director Jadaone.",5

Sunshine,nakakaiyak talaga e,1
Sunshine,"the moment i realized they brought the kids to life…. amazing conceptalthough they show the potential of what their kids could have been or who they could have become, and it hurts to take it away, the current lives of the mothers also have to be considered. they also have dreams to fulfill. taking away their future also means taking away the future of their children. both are really big factors to take in, but what truly matters is knowing what needs to be done today for a better tomorrow.so if you’re asking me, the real selfishness here is doing what is deemed right by society just because they don’t realize how selfish bringing a life to a world that isn’t ready for you is. it’s simple. they’re not ready, and that should be a good enough reason.and the way this was written and directed by a filipino woman is really brave storytelling. i loved it. i hope more close minded people watch this. this should be shown in catholic schools. sorry papa G, pero gets ko rin si Sunshine!",-1
Sunshine,fuck them pro-lifers.,-1
Sunshine,"First of all, I know that this movie premiered at the 49th Toronto International Film Festival in 2024 and arrived in Philippine cinemas 4 months ago. And now that it finally dropped on Netflix… I hope I’m not too late to say it finally: This movie is powerful Antoinette Jadaone delivers one of her most fearless films yet with ‘’ — a coming-of-age sports drama that hits with quiet power and emotional honesty.Maris Racal plays the titular character, a young gymnast on the road to the Olympics. Her world revolves around discipline, repetition, and the dream of making it to the competition she’s trained her whole life for. But when she discovers she’s pregnant, her perfectly controlled world cracks open.What I loved about the film is how it never sensationalizes her situation. Sunshine’s fear is treated with quiet realism. The movie acknowledges how complicated teenage pregnancy is, especially in a society where abortion, reproductive rights, and bodily autonomy remain heavily stigmatized and often misunderstood.These themes are controversial. And yes, the movie will divide people. But ‘’ refuses to look away from the truth:         .    ,  .Maris is phenomenal here. She carries the entire emotional weight of the story with a performance that feels painfully real. She rarely breaks down on screen, but you think her internal collapse in the smallest expressions — the breath she holds, the way she avoids eye contact, the way she pushes her dream forward while everything else is falling apart.         .The supporting cast — particularly Jennica Garcia, Meryll Soriano, Rhed Bustamante, and Xyriel Manabat — also elevate the film, each representing a different kind of pressure or support Sunshine faces. And yeah, some male characters in the movie definitely got what they deserved. Jadaone’s direction is quiet, patient, and uncomfortably close — exactly how it should be. The movie lets us follow Sunshine’s anxiety and feel the suffocating pressure she’s under.One of the film’s boldest artistic choices is the recurring appearance of a mysterious girl who seems to follow Sunshine. At first it’s confusing, then a bit eerie, then surprisingly emotional. I won’t spoil anything, but when the film finally reveals who she represents… . It’s symbolic, heartbreaking, and adds a deeper emotional layer to Sunshine’s arc.Beyond the gymnastics, beyond the controversy, Sunshine is really about choice — and how young women often aren’t given the space to empower themselves to make their own choices.The movie conveys important messages: your body is your own; silence can mask the deepest struggles; the pressure to be perfect is harmful; pursuing dreams matters, but so is ensuring one's survival; kindness fosters safety, while judgment breeds fear; and young women need safe spaces. The movie doesn’t push a specific viewpoint — it drives for humanity.Overall, ‘’ is brave, heartbreaking, and painfully relevant. It does not shout — it whispers truths that hit even harder. Indeed, it’s a film that mirrors reality for many young women today, and one that our society needs to see, even if the conversations it starts are uncomfortable.With that being said, I’m going to give this movie…9/10!  (Woooo!)",-1

Sunshine,"do it for the little kid inside you! fuck men, fuck religious psychosis, fuck the government, and fuck the patriarchy!!! GETS dapat ng lahat na ABORTION is HEALTHCARE!!! thank you, mahal kita sunshine at mahal ko ang pelikulang ito ",4
Sunshine,"My GOD sobbed so hard in this movie!!!Small nitpick lang about the final scene of her getting into the Olympics. It kinda felt like it should've ended at the scene before that, when she was having that conversation with the Girl about her understanding her decision. I didn't super love how it felt like her getting an abortion had to be justified because she ended up as an amazing gymnast, that she needed to prove that it was worth it! Not wanting to be a mother is enough justification, imo, and that alone makes the abortion worth it.Anyway, what a beautiful and impactful film  love all the Sunshines in tne world!!",5
Sunshine,"This is an eye-opener to the Filipinos that, women are entitled to abort their child whether it’s on purpose or not; we should not be blind by our belief—in Christianity. Because this is not about the child alone, but also the mere fact of being a mother unprepared. That’s why abortion should be legalized.",11
Sunshine,"just holding back my tears as I type my review. nothing could have prepared me of how possibly angry I could get watching this. nakakagalit talaga maging babae sa Pilipinas. Come to think of it, the moment na pinanganak kana as a girl parang talo kana agad … in the sense of being deprived of services that a woman needs. this just solidifies that WOMEN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE ABORTIONS. Let women have a say over their own body! gets ko na.",-1

Sunshine,men should suffer like this or idk,22

I’m all for pro-choice, but I just wish the execution had been a little stronger. nevertheless, i’m glad they chose to speak up abt this. everybody make more films like this so we could do smth abt the trad shitty mindset of the filos !!!",23

Sunshine,Gets ko na. This film gave me a new whole perspective of things.,-1
Sunshine,"sometimes, circumstances happen and it may either break or make us in the end. we just need to decide, and stand by it, what we really want for us to not have regrets. Sunshine tells a story how a single decision can turn your life 180 degrees. it also portrays that people, especially women, have the right to decide what they want to do with their OWN bodies. You may hate the fact that people do decide abortions, but you dont get a say about it. you don’t know their full story, and you certainly don’t know the circumstances they’re facing.",-1

Sunshine,rewatched sa netflix. ganda talaga huhuhu!,24
Sunshine,"sobrang delikado ng proseso ng abortion kung walang proper equipment, kaya dapat lang gawing legal ang abortion para sa mga kagaya ni sunshine at mary grace. sa lahat ng mga sunshine sa mundo, you matter kahit ano mang maging desisyon niyo.",3
Sunshine,"Mahirap na nga maging babae, lalo na sa Pilipinas. Ang dami laging sinasabi ng mga tao --- from how you should dress to how you should deal with your own body. So in a very judgmental country like the Philippines, parang wala ka na talagang choice but to drown out the noise.This film is raw, relevant and necessary. I'm also glad na this movie became mainstream kasi it makes us think and talk. I never realized I hadn’t fully understood my stance on abortion until I watched this film.Other comments: - Feel ko lang ang daming hindi naconsider/napakita sa film like how athletes should also be public figures (atleast on my POV, if athlete ka, medyo known ka talaga sa public --- especially if marami ka panalo). So iniisip ko lang how Sunshine could roam freely nang walang nakakakita sa kanya. hahaha - Feel ko may iiimprove pa yung plot ni Rhed. I feel like super minadali siya that it seemed so random for me. - Nassoft ako everytime pumunta siya ng simbahan, pero hanggang sa labas lang siya kasi nahihiya siya. Super galing ni Maris!",-1

Sunshine,"i wish nagustuhan ko pa ito ng sobra, andun na lahat eh. hindi ko din alam kung bakit hindi ko mas naappreciate. maaring dahil yung dating sakin ay hindi sya pumapanig sa isang side lamang, kumbaga hindi firm yung stance ng palabas. pero baka ayun din yung kabuuang mensahe na tinitimbang at pinagiisipan nang mabuti ang ganitong mga bagay at tinatalakay ang pagiging komplikado ng pagbubuntis at pagpapalaglag. anyway ang ganda pala ni maris racal heheisa pa, napaka ignorante pero nag search ako at may nabasa akong blog about dun sa mga tindahan sa quiapo. totoo pala na may nagbebenta talaga ng mga ganon sa tabi tabi huhulastly, naimbyerna lang din ako nung sinabi ng tatay na ""pagsabihan mo yang kapatid mo"" HUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHH??? kung ako yun baka tinalakan ko na pabalik!",3
Sunshine,"Where Filipino films trend to historic dramas and at times big explosive bursts of emotion, Sunshine reflects the good and the ugly of Filipino society in the modern times. It is within the same type as the classics like Maynila sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag, but where it could've easily just copied that same old formula of poverty, crime, and the ugliness that lies beneath the city, the film chooses to explore controversial topics at its heart and anchors it toward really good character dynamics, not to mention where other films center around a male character from the rural side or from the slums, we instead focus on a lady who is faced with a great moral dilemma (in the Filipino perspective, you'll get it) when her dreams are on the verge of being stripped away from her. While watching, I sometimes forget that it is a Filipino film (not to sound derogatory or self-hating btw) because it strays away from tired old cliches other Filipino films do, and while the blueprints of those tropes are present, they are presented in a light that feels more subdued than its usual contemporaries. Also, I do love how the film does respect the audience in choosing not to explain certain things, letting us fill in the gaps.It's a great watch, in my opinion. And I feel that this film should be at the helm of some sort of renaissance for Philippine cinema, where we aren't afraid to speak out and be bold while also making great art out of it.",12

Pregnancy tests, contraceptives, menstrual products, etc.—these are needs, yet they are an expense for women. Napaka-mahal maging babae. Napaka-hirap maging isa... lalo na sa bansang ito.

Sunshine,I wish I could string together a more eloquent review but I’m still in the middle of recovering from sobbing as I write this. All I can say is that women are so strong and brave and beautiful and deserve to live a life free from judgement and control . IT’S PRO CHOICE FOREVER AND ALWAYS BTW.,7
Sunshine,"LUMIPAD KA, SUNSHINEThis film tackles tons of social issues that’s been prevalent and is really a big concern in the Philippines—that should be given effort to create a change. Poverty, lack of sex education, teenage pregnancy, and especially the issue about abortion that’s been keeping a lot of women in cage and are being force to have family or be a solo parent. This film utilizes tons of social issues that people—especially the uneducated ones or the boomers should watch and serves as an education background for them to be knowledgeable how women can be easily put through hell when a women is a victim of teenage pregnancy. Maris Racal did a really great job in portraying Sunshine. Probably one of the best filipino film I’ve watched.",12

Medyo bitin lang sa pagpapakita kung gaano siya kagaling bilang atleta, at may ilang plot, lalo na yung parallel story ng isang buntis na biktima ng pang-aabuso, na kahit malakas, medyo rushed at overwhelming.Pero kahit ganun, malakas pa rin ang dating ng pelikula sa social issues at sa pagpapakita ng totoong buhay sa Maynila.",3

Sunshine, my sweet girl, you are so brave i fucking love you and im so proud of you. The film itself is so fucking brave in showcasing these fucked up prevalent “taboo” issues in this godforsaken country, all overshadowed by fucked up hypocrites, fucked up men, fucked up families, fucked up conservatism, fucked up systems, fucked up government, and the fucked up overt control and chokehold of “religion”. Tbh that’s not all, THE LIST GOES ON. All these beliefs and what do you get? A closed off skull that’s for sure. I know damn well that a lot of conservatives might refuse to watch this, stop midway, or carry prejudice over empathy while watching the film.

A little spoiler: I really like how they were able to let us see the experiences of women, including young girls, who are abused and forced to take on a weighty responsibility just because choosing themselves is wrong in some people’s eyes, even if they didn’t want what’s happening to them in the first place. Some experience it as the consequences of their actions, but this movie also gives up a glimpse of those who are oppressed and have nowhere to go. We also see the current situations of places like hospitals. It’s a good way to raise awareness about the issue being tackled in this movie. Very eye-opening and inspiring.",36

Sunshine,"definitely direk antoinette’s best work so far. simula pa lang, damang-dama ko na si sunshine. lahat ng naramdaman niya—yung takot, galit, inis, lungkot…tumatama sakin. kahit na gets ko agad yung role ni annika, i didn’t expect that surge of emotions sa dulo. as much as i am pro-choice, hindi talaga mawawala yung catholic guilt. and aside from that, ewan ko if ako lang, pero ramdam ko rin na in some way may fondness si sunshine sa bata. maybe it’s something mothers feel, even yung muntikan na, or baka kasi babae tayo.tbh, parang hinuhulaan ko na yung mga susunod na mangyayari (ganun ako sa lahat ng movies ;-;), pero nagulat pa rin ako dito. damang-dama ko yung pagkababae ko rito, parang universal feeling for women ganun. kita ko sarili ko hindi lang kay sunshine, pero pati sa ate niya, bff niya, si menggay, yung doktora, yung ate sa pharmacy, yung coach niya. hayyy naluluha pa rin ako kapag iniisip ko to HAHAHA.pansin na pansin ko rin na talagang englishera si annika HAHAHA. iniisip ko parang hindi swak, but i remembered na englishero yung tatay niya (character ni elijah). idk if on purpose ba na englishero si elijah to match annika or the other way around HAHAHA.",-1
Sunshine,Gets ko na.,21
Sunshine,the small detail sa jeep na “Gift of God” kahit problemado na si sunshine lewl,2
Sunshine,"this film stayed with me. raw, quiet, tapang na hindi sumisigaw pero tumatagos.unang-una: Maris Racal. hindi lang nag-portray — she became Sunshine. yung pagod, yung takot, yung pagka-desperate pero umaasa pa rin… ramdam mo hanggang buto. this is the face of so many young women na araw-araw lumalaban in a country that tells them what to be, what to do, and what to carry.ang ganda ng pagkakahuli sa Manila — yung sikip, yung init, yung ingay, pati yung bigat na hindi mo maipaliwanag. hindi siya romanticized; totoo lang. yung Quiapo scenes? sobrang accurate na parang naamoy mo na yung alinsangan at dasal at pag-asa ng mga taong dumadaan dito para humanap ng solusyon sa problema na hindi sila binibigyan ng choice.and that’s the heart of the film: choice. or the lack of it. bilang kababaihan, ang hirap pag-usapan ng reproductive rights dito sa Pilipinas kasi every conversation is haunted by guilt, religion, and judgment. pero Sunshine manages to hold that tension — yung guilt, yung fear, yung what-if — without punishing the woman at the center of it.this isn’t just a film — it’s a mirror. it asks questions na hindi madali, and refuses to hold your hand para bigyan ka ng sagot. it lets you sit with discomfort. it lets you ask yourself: kung hindi ikaw ang nasa sitwasyon, bakit ikaw ang magdedesisyon?",-1
Sunshine,"What will you do if your dream is at stake because of one mistake?Sunshine delivers a powerful message about reproductive rights and the need for access to safe and legal abortion.The film shows the current state of healthcare in the Philippines and how this basic necessity has become inaccessible, especially to those living below the poverty line.I like how the film does not romanticize the societal issue of unwanted pregnancy. Instead, it highlights how stigma deeply affects women’s decision-making about their own bodies. It shows how the main character struggles with an internal conflict and debates with her own conscience.While the film clearly presents why abortion should be legalized and recognized as part of healthcare in the Philippines, it also portrays how religion and health often clash. It is true that our country is still in the process of accepting that abortion is a right that should be available to all women.Some might argue that safe sex is the only way to avoid these situations, but we cannot ignore the fact that many women experience sexual abuse, rape, or non-consensual ejaculation during intercourse.Sunshine is not just a film that explains why safe abortion should be legalized; it calls our attention to consider the issue without guilt-tripping women through religion or societal pressure.Women should have the freedom to decide what to do with their own bodies. Marriage or co-parenting should not be treated as a band-aid solution to a lifelong responsibility. These solutions do not apply to everyone, especially to those who do not have the means to support a child.I know we all have different perspectives on this issue, but thinking long-term about the future of our children depends on how ready we truly are to take on this responsibility.",-1
Sunshine,"Hindi talaga ako binibigo ni direk Jadaone kapag usapang isyu, pakikipagsapalaran, at boses ng kababaihan. Kuhang-kuha rin ang realidad ng Maynila (bigla kong naalala ang Maynila sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag [1975]).Mabuhay ka direk Jadaone!",3
Sunshine,"Love how the film depicts the harsh reality of what women have to go through just to be able to decide for themselves and their BODIES!! This movie really goes to show how making abortion illegal makes it so much harder and dangerous for women. It does not sanctify the value of life since in the first place the life of the woman is endangered. Moreover, I love how Manila gets depicted in this light, it shows the good and bad that comes with the city. It is bad for obvious reasons, the normalized chaos that is happening around it, how every night Sunshine is there, a mayhem ensues. However, I appreciate how Manila became a sanctuary place for her, where we can see how despite the chaos that happens every night, there are bits of humanity that saves her. The girl dun sa hotel, yung tricycle driver, and the 13-year-old girl that she met.Furthermore, I would like to commend the addition of having childrens act as her conscience or the ""what if child of hers"". It's a great addition because we can see how in the beginning of the film the girl was literally shouting ""murderer"" over and over again because in her perspective, her mother is harming her. But in the end when she said ""gets ko na"", it became a cathartic scene as it finally hits us that it isn't about being irresponsible and selfish ---- rather it is something more than that. The whole line of the girl saying to her friend Ariana that her dream is the same as Sunshine's is a great addition because I think it rings true with reality. As every now and then, when a child hears about the dreams of their parents and how they had to stop it to take care of their children, especially when it comes to Mothers, the child often feels bad and just wished that thier Mom was able to live out their dream first.Lastly, I love the relationship of sunshine and her older sister, the fact that never once pinagalitan o diniktahan ng ate nya sa kung paano nya haharapin yung sitwasyon niya goes to show how much she trusts and love Sunshine. I also love the contrast that all throughout the film there were different sides of the story whether labelling her as a ""murderer"" o miggy telling her to do what you got to do that once you reached the end scene when her sister just told her ""kahit ano maging desisyon mo kampi lang ako sayo"" made it soo impactful. Kase in the end yun lang naman ang kailangan niyang marinig, we have seen her face through that circumstance alone with nothing but her conscience, that the moment na sinabi sa kanya yun, it became a relief to her as well as allowed her to finally tell someone or at least cried it out to them na natatakot din siya kase nga bata din siyaa and hindi pa siya ready maging nanay. All in all, the film was a 10 out of 10, and I appreciate how the film wasn't all in the face about what you should believe in and what you shouldn't. It just presents Sunshine's story and her decision which should be acknowledged because hindi dapat humantong sa isang sitwasyon na mas uunahin pa ng isang doktor ang kaniyang lisensya kesa sa buhay ng isang tao dahil lang ""nagpalaglag"" siya. If you really value life in its essence then we should also acknowledge the life of the person carrying the baby so bakit niyo papabayaan lang na mamatay yung batang 13-year-old???????? so in conclusion:TANGINAA NG MGA LALAKETANGINA MO MIGGYTANGINA NUNG DOKTORATANGINA NUNG LALAKING DOKTORTANGINA NUNG TITO TANGNIA NUNG WALANG KWENTANG NANAY (?) - di nya deserve matawag na nanay",13

Sunshine,“gets ko na” ,18
Sunshine,"sunshine (maris) im on your side it's sad how sunshine and girls like sunshine get exploited on top of so many other things they have to deal with in a religious, conservative and judgmental, capitalist society. god. the sick religiosity that permeates every level of filipino society is SICKENING. i want girls to be protected and safe and supported and happy!!!",-1

Sunshine,this film had me staring off into space afterward!,-1

Sunshine,I FUCKING HATE ALL THE MEN THAT SPOKE IN THIS FILM,22
Sunshine,"Sunshine is easily one of the best films i have seen in a while. The film depicts the reality that many women experiences. In a country like ours, where religion holds so much influence, making this film is such a courageous decision. Filipinos tend to be religious but their actions contradict the values they claim uphold. It’s about time we normalize conversations abortion and sex education. How many more women will go through what sunshine went through? Women should not be forced into motherhood because not all of us are made to be a mother. Every women deserves the rights to decide and to be seen.Sunshine is such a beautiful film. It’s very raw which makes it easy to connect with the audience especially with women. To all the sunshines out there: you are heard, and you are seen. Your voice matter.Pangarap ko rin ang mga pangarap mo, Sunshine:)",12
Sunshine,"""yung pangarap ko, kung anong pangarap niya."" and really, that's the entire point, isn't it?",0
Sunshine,"while watching naalala ko sinasabi ni sir lau na parang dinadaanan lang ni maris ang maynila instead of interacting with it and ykw i see it  kumbaga tinarato lang ng pelikula ang manila na ‘prop’ imbes na isang karakter. and i’m aware that i’m looking for something that wasn’t in the film pero missed opportunity talaga na ipakita ang manila bilang isang living and breathing city. Gets ba.and one thing though.. the acting in this film is SO fawking good.. especially kay maris  super galing ng microexpressions Ugh lalo na yung scene where she was convincing her coach na hindi siya buntis.. Siper galing at ang realistic lang.. kita na agad na natatakot pero nagpipilit na magmukhang matapang. ALSO JENNICA GARCIA.. So good pero super love how di talaga nagwaver si sunshine sa ayaw niya na maging nanay  even the church scenes didn’t consist of her asking for guidance in her decision, it was her asking for forgiveness likee",6
Sunshine,"First of all, ang galing talaga ni Maris Racal umacting.Gets ko naGets din kita... Nakakainis 'yung unang doctor (pero I know it reflects the prolifer's take on this kind of issue haha). Nung una nainis din ako kay xyril pero mabuti na kang may character development sya. Napaisil ako, if ever sa friend ko mangyayari yung ganitong bagay, I know for sure na hindi ako maghehesitate to help her. I almost cried sa part ni Rhed, grabe talaga. Napakairesponsable nung parents n'ya, and to think na 13 years old pa lang s'ya. Sobrang nakakapanlumo dahil nangyayare talaga 'to sa totoong buhay. Medyo nadamihan lang ako sa part andaming mura (siguro ginawa 'yun para mas magmukhang natural? Pero somehow medyo na oa-han ako) Also, ginawang tao si anika and aryunuh with feelings and such, and pinakita pa dun na parang gustong mabuhay ni Aryunuh, wala parang medyo contradicting lang yung part na yun, I think unnecessary na 'yung character ni Aryunuh since nagbigay life lang 'to sa fetus sa tiyan ni Rhed. I like the ending, akala ko nung una hindi matutuloy dahil nga sa sistema dito sa PH. Add ko na din, bakit ba kasi hindi nagk-condom si Elijah Canlas hahahah. Overall, magagaling ang cast. Simple lang yung movie, and gets ko bakit nga ba controversial. I think kulang or hind na explore pa 'yung other reasons bakit need I legalize ang abortion to convince the public. Pero maganda talaga, fr.",3

Sunshine,"Holy shit, this film had me in tears. Not only is it extremely well made, the cinematography and the characters were so raw that it had me stressing over them. I have never rooted for anyone so much to get rid of that damn baby. The movie also shows the darkest sides of the healthcare system in the Philippines, religion, and most of all, fucking men. It is unfortunate that us Filipina women have it the fucking worst. Not only are we in a third world country where it is illegal to abort, but we are guilt tripped over and over again by society to not choose ourselves. We are literal machines for them to procreate and forget ourselves in the process. We are not human to them.Right from the get-go it is shown how unprepared (who I assumed is 20) 20 year old Sunshine is. Even when she is cleaning up her sister’s child, she raises her hand as if to scare the child, when the child clearly does not understand this gesture. The men in this film are shown to be no help at all, may it be sibling, the boyfriend, the men in the streets, every. single. man. The concept of birthing a child will never be their problem, it will never even cross their minds. I love how realistic the scenes were when all the pregnant were all together, aiding each other and comforting each other; that is the harsh truth— men will never know the connection us women have with one another. Even if they are strangers.Rhed (Mary Grace) is the exact reason why abortion should be legalized in the Philippines. Young women subject themselves to improper medical procedures because that’s all they have access to (and hardly)— they do not know the severity of what their bodies will go through. In the first place, sex education is still frowned upon in the Philippines. God, I really hate, HATE how religion proves time and time again that they are the main reason why we cannot progress as a society. This film is beautifully filmed, I loved every bit of it. My heart sank deeper whenever she struggles, but the weight lifts whenever she chooses herself. Ladies, please choose yourself, above everyone else.",13

Sunshine,"There is beauty in raising a child, and beauty in chasing a dream. Women shouldn’t have to trade one for the other. This film shines light on this truth—understanding that every woman deserves the freedom to choose what’s right for her, and the autonomy to decide the path her life will take.Such a beautiful and inspiring watch. I hope more people watch it, and allow its message to open hearts, challenge norms, and spark understanding for women like Sunshine.",-1
Sunshine,"Holds so much meaning about womanhood during different stages of life, especially for those living in a country in which unplanned pregnancy is a death sentence. The backwards system that gets perpetuated by bigots like a couple of doctors that Sunshine meets is heavily stacked against women, but the movie shows us how having a choice can save our lives. There's surrealism in the movie too but it's very much deeply rooted in reality. Many girls are Sunshine or Mary Grace.",-1
Sunshine,"'Yung pangarap ko, kung ano ang pangarap niya. Isang mahigpit na yakap para sa mga sunshine diyan:) at fuck you sa mga Miggy at Bobot diyan. Putangina niyong mga lalake, mga walang dulot. Gets na gets ko—and I hope many more people will get it, too. This film struck a deep chord with me. Nearly every scene felt like it could happen in real life—and in many cases, it truly does.Abortion is treated like a sin in this godforsaken conservative and dominantly Catholic country. Many people disagree, but it really doesn’t matter whether you agree or not. In the end, the decision should be up to the woman who’s pregnant. We shouldn’t have an opinion—just understanding is enough. After all, it's her body, her life, her future, her choice. That's why I'll always firmly believe that abortion should be legal and safe. There are women—and even girls—who are far too young, forced into pregnancy, still unstable, still trying to build their own lives, and completely unprepared to raise a child while chasing their dreams. Abortion is healthcare, and access to it is a basic reproductive right.This film captures that reality so loudly. It’s loud with the streets of Manila, with people’s judgment, with hypocrisy. You can hear it all so clearly—the way society pushes women toward unreliable and dangerous methods like pamparegla in Quiapo or hilot, simply because abortion is condemned and proper reproductive healthcare is lacking. It’s so fucked up and heartbreaking. Tangina, ang hirap-hirap maging babae sa bansang ’to—sa mundong ’to.'Yung scene na walang filter na ipinakita ang estado ng public hospitals—mga serbisyong galing sa buwis ng tao pero hindi nila kayang ayusin—sobrang sakit panoorin. Sobrang bulok ng sistema natin. And there’s probably something even worse behind it—we are so fucked.So when Sunshine finally went through with the abortion, I felt relieved. For a moment, I was scared she might keep the baby. Bringing a child into the world when you’re not ready—and being forced to give up your own dreams because of it—is one of the most cruel things you can do to yourself and to that child. And that’s exactly why choice matters.Gets ko na.",-1
Sunshine,"- the ending was good. idc what other people say but for me lang mas better nga wala gi state whether or not nag pa abort si Shine. - abortion is healthcare.- love her sis so much and fuck elijah's character.- some part of the movie is rushed, other than that it was great",5

Sunshine,"Ang ganda!Isa sa mga kagandahan ng Sunshine ay ang pagiging tapat nito sa katotohanan. Pinakikita ang katotohanan kung anong meron sa Maynila; masikip, maingay, maputik, at maalikabok. Pamilyar.Pamilyar ang ingay.Pamilyar ang tsismisan.Pamilyar ang katolisismo.Pamilyar ang sikip at mahabang pila sa pampublikong ospital.Pamilyar ang sistemang mabagal at madalas walang pakialam.Pamilyar—dahil ipinanganak at lumaki rin ako sa pinakasiksik na bahagi ng Maynila.Pero bilang lalaki, iba ang mundo na ginagalawan ko. Sa gitna ng pelikula, naisip ko: hindi ako pamilyar kung paano ba talaga maging isang babae.Hindi pamilyar ang takot.'Yung takot na hindi ko kailanman mararanasan, pero ramdam ko habang pinapanood si Sunshine.Para sa akin, Sunshine works because it feels lived-in.Alam mong ganito talaga ang Pilipinas. Bansang puno ng pangarap, pero puno rin ng hadlang.At sa gitna ng lahat, nando'n si Sunshine: takot at desperado, pero matapang.Hindi melodrama ang dating. Hindi rin lecture.Mas parang paalala: hindi dapat ganito kabigat ang mundo para sa mga kababaihan.",3
Sunshine,"MAG RANT KO YAWAall i could think about during the entire movie was that i hate this goddamn country. fuck the philippines for STILL taking away our right to choose and fuck the philippines for making women resort to underground methods instead of providing safer options. i hate how people have to shove catholicism down their throats when in reality, i dont think jesus wouldve wanted kids to end up with parents who cant love them the way parents should either. i think they also beautifully portrayed the juxtaposition of how women have to always carry the burden in situations like this and how men are just…. there. their lives dont stop the second they become a father. women have to put aside their dreams and their careers because they carry the brunt of it all. i hope now that its on netflix na it will start to make waves among the conservative people and make them realize what reality they are putting women thru unsnssuhsnshunsn i love this movie",-1

HER BODY, HER CHOICE. you don't have the right to judge a woman just because she chose to abort her child. again, her choice not yours.Maris Racal proved that her acting skills are on a different level, she justified her role in this movie. and i know it's a hit when Maris is the main lead.no doubt, ONE OF THE BEST FILIPINO MOVIE EVER MADE.",-1

Sunshine,"Maris Racal is Sunshine; and Sunshine is womanhood incarnate. Through Sunshine’s story, the film becomes a quiet yet devastating reflection of how our society—and deeply, its systems—continue to fail women. One of the film’s most harrowing moments is the scene where Sunshine rescues Mary Grace after she nearly dies from a self-induced abortion. It is not just a moment of personal crisis; it is a painful exposure of how inaccessible, judgmental, and unsafe our healthcare system remains for women…",20

Sunshine,"I loved everything about this film. It's super important for people to watch it with an open-mind. I've always been pro-choice, and watching this movie just further solidifies that belief of mine (as if it isn't an already solid belief before).

Sunshine,ABSOLUTE CINEMAAAAA I LOVE THISSSS,8
Sunshine,"the woman that you are, Maris and direk Antoinette!",10
Sunshine,"Gets.I was gonna leave it there but I have thoughts so full steam ahead—Manila is a staple in almost every Filipino film, being the capital and all, but rather than the large city itself— Sunshine specifically captures the essence of Quiapo so well. The bustling markets, the overcrowd and kids begging for alms, and religion is embedded everywhere— whether it be its churches, the posters within the buildings, street stalls selling rebultos and rosaries, or the people themselves. I don't usually care for the setting of the story but I always think it's smart when it actually helps drive the narrative forward, so I find this neat little aspect of the film amusing (also, while we're at it, props to whoever the prod designer is wow). I watched this at 3AM during a vigil so I had all the time to read other reviews and can I just say, while I understand how it could be viewed as such— I don't think this film was didactic or propaganda. I love films that open conversations and Sunshine opened a lot, but more than the conversations it opened, I love how the center of it has always been women. The heart of Sunshine is Sunshine herself, and Maris Racal definitely gave the performance of a lifetime in this one. The fact that she filmed this the same time as Can't Buy Me Love is insane, talk about range.Also, props to Direk Tonet 'cause I have only watched this film a day before, but it is so dear to my heart. Pangarap ko ang pangarap mo, Sunshine <333PS.Also, whoever decided to cast Piolo Pascual and Elijah Canlas sa father and son deserves a raise.",-1

Both in the sense that Sunshine needs to drown out the noise to chase her goal and that she needs to drown out the noises that judge and try to influence her decision regarding her pregnancy.

Maris Rascal was great in this.,13
Sunshine,"the illegality of abortion may not impede ur day-to-day life, but that doesn’t erase the fact that hundreds of thousands of women suffer from it. and who’s to blame for this other than our government?

Sunshine,at sana’y gets din nila…,-1
Sunshine,tb,1
Sunshine,"i applaud the production kasi ang tapang nila to release a movie like this, knowing na super conservative ng mga tao dito and super against ang karamihan sa abortion.i don't know if I'm too woke pero wala naman mali sa movie na to. let's not crucify people na inuuna yung career above anything else. this is not about ""legalizing abortion"" para sakin, this is about letting women decide for themselves. you do you guys! your body, your choice.",-1
Sunshine,girl fuck them kids and fuck u too (mga lalake at religious people),-1

Sunshine,fuck the law.,27
Sunshine,HANDS FUCKING DOWNNN,27
Sunshine,"Yakap sa lahat ng Sunshine, kapit lang at laban lang.",2
Sunshine,"pangarap ko kung ano pangarap niyathis movie seriously altered my brain chemistry. soso many women face this exact problem, yet it is not being recognized and represented enough. it has shown autonomy, religious guilt, the state of the philippines, domestic abuse, men running away from the problems they created, and how the limitation to contraceptives & not being pro-choice affects not only women, but everyone personally. criminalizing abortion doesnt banish abortion, it only removes having a safe abortion. could this be any more perfect !!!!!",13
Sunshine,sama me!,1
Sunshine,gets  ko  na ,14
Sunshine,"sobrang walang budget kong iskolar sensha n po direk inantay kopa mag ka netflix version but whateverbilang isang bakla sa lipunan na nabuhay sa bilog ng kababaihan isang malaking reyalidad ito na nasa puke ng babae at katawan ng nagdadala ang mamahala kung handa naba ito.kung hindi pa handa ang isang bulaklak ng isang babae at kung ayaw nito, siy at siy lang ang dapat nitong magdikta wala sa mat ng diyos. bakit may cctv ba ang diyos? over, mas higit na mahalaga ang matagal nitong pinangarap.pero sa kasalukuyan ang kababaihan ay mag pagkakaiba depende parin ito sa kung ano ang kanyang paninindigan abante babae!",3
Sunshine,daming loopholesdaming questions,1
Sunshine,"haven't cried over a good filipino film in a long timeefilipino catholic guilt is an absolute beast. and god forbid a woman actually wants something—that whole primal conservatism clamps down on female desire like a vice ika nga, ""Sunshine is fantastic for a country that fails its women"" and i couldn't agree more !!!!",-1
Sunshine,Essential viewing for quite a lot of people here,24
Sunshine,Women–,7
Sunshine,"It’s overwhelming and heartbreaking that this is the reality for some women. and even when you feel like no one will take your side, choose yourself—despite everything. gets na gets kita sunshine.",7
Sunshine,grabeng reality check para sa mga bullshit na tao na nag bubulag bulagan patungkol sa usaping 'to!!!,-1
Sunshine,We need more movies like this. A movie like sunshine shows the struggles of every woman bearing a child. And if a woman who is not ready to have a child should not be force to keep the child because every woman deserves the right to decide her own future and what she’s truly prepared for.,-1
Sunshine,Gets ko na.:),33
Sunshine,no notes,-1
Sunshine,"gets ko nagellen & sunshine magkatabibsa bed scene my fav, ang simple pero grabe yung emotions. kudos, great film",6
Sunshine,ok! I have so many thoughts for this movie and its defff not for the smol minded people - its not a movie to ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO SUCH THING kaya pls kung makitid utak mo - wag mo panuorin,-1
Sunshine,"I love the significance of the film. Hindi ako naniniwala sa “it takes a village to raise a child” dahil it takes more than just a village. It costs a mother’s body and the world to raise one. Alam kong maraming katulad si Sunshine, at kahit anong paraan sabihin ng mundo, walang desisyong magaan. Sapat na rason o dahilan ang pagiging hindi handa maging ina.",6
Sunshine,"everything moving, heartbreaking, and gut wrenching has already been said about this film so i’ll add my favorite short sequence that left me breathless:sunshine’s attempt at self-induced abortion was at this tiny raggedy inn room; a rule of thirds composition using the windows to divide the shot, sunshine in the rightmost basked in green light, which feels cold and lonely, away from the leftmost corner of the room lit in warm orange light emitting from a small lamp. she’s boxed and contained and helpless, it’s just her carrying the weight of her own problems and decisions. as she slowly carries out the procedure of the abortion, the train rolls by—loud and deafening—like the heavy guilt and grief setting in. she can’t drown out the noise, she’s drowning in the noise of her troubled thoughts.(not great at writing and describing things sry but yeah the inn scenes were the start of my ugly sobbing throughout the movie)",-1

TANGINA.",0
Sunshine,"Get's mo?At first I was conflicted kay I thought the two children represent the unborn children of both Sunshine and the 13-year-old girl. Only when Annika said her dream is the same as Sunshine's, that I realized she is a part of Sunshine. Not a different ""person"" but a part of her— which gives Sunshine the utmost right to decide on which path to take. (or am I stating the obvious?)",-1
Sunshine,better reproductive health rights and health facilities!!,4
Sunshine,tangina talaga ng mga lalak3. salot sa lipunan!,0
Sunshine,"Two can tango, but only one makes it out of the dancefloor.The hard truth of women and children being the ones to bear the consequences. May this film be an eye opener. The underlying issues on mental health, socioeconomic burden, and lack of education are directly implied in this film. To bravely put it out on Philippine media is a start of a more aware perspective. The cinematography and script are well combined and well thought of. The metaphors hit the spot and Maris' performance not only represented a lot of young girls out there, but also those who are mentally struggling. Seeing someone doing everything alone and bear the burden of something that isn't normative is heartbreaking. Children must not be guilt tripped into doing things just to survive. Proper education and guidance is what we always hope and pray for. May this film pave the way to a more open and safe space for all that are struggling.",-1
Sunshine,favorite film of all time,8
Sunshine,"i love everything about this film. in a country where catholicism is the majority, the film is so brave to choose a side and advocate for women's rights. hooefully, filipinos will learn to open their eyes and finally say the words, ""gets ko na.""",-1
Sunshine,Salamat Direk Tonet sa Pelikulang 'to ,1
Sunshine,naiintindihan mo ba 'ko?gets ko naputangina basta naiyak ako ILY SUNSHINE,2
Sunshine,just as good as the first time,-1
Sunshine,ang bigat at nakakatakot. sobrang raw ng lahat. grabe direk tonet!!! sumikip dibdib ko tangina damang dama ko acting ni maris. ang galing ni annika! ang lala ng emotional toll nitong movie.,6
Sunshine,"kung magiging presidente lang din naman tulad ni marcos, ayoko rin ipanganak. sana gets niyo.",0
Sunshine,"i think that men forget the emotional, physical and mental turmoil that women have to go through when pregnant. ang dali lang sakanila na sabihin ""paninindigan ko yan"" or ""ipalaglag mo na yan"" because they dont risk anything that can permanently impact their lives. they can walk down the streets and no one would know that they have a kid. while women in this country are forced into motherhood bc theres no legal right that saves them from that. ncjsbs tangina talaga ng pilipinasalso! we need more films like this that talks abt motherhood, pregnancy and abortion in the country.",-1
Sunshine,"tangina napakahusay niyo maris racal and direk tonet!!!!!!!!huwag kang mag-alala sunshine, gets na gets kita.",-1

Sunshine,"“Gets ko na. Gets ko na.”it feels incredibly realistic... so real that it’s as if Sunshine herself is my best friend, opening up to me and sharing her deepest thoughts. you can truly feel every line she delivers; each word carries weight, sincerity, and emotion.the film truly stands out in the way it portrays raw, human moments. sunshine’s character is written with such honesty that her struggles and triumphs feel personal.hands down to you, direk tonet  your vision and heart made this film shine in the most genuine way.",-1
Sunshine,"beautiful, just absolutely beautiful this has got to be one of the best filo movies i have ever watched, like EVER. i honestly cannot find the words right now but i have never felt so affected, like i was the one experiencing it. from sunshine drowning out the noise, to her practicing the last time (we see) before the olympics. all of this was just so beautiful, i felt her struggles and everything that happened to her.this movie made me tear up atleast 3 times. it was just so sad seeing the reality, and thinking that someone might be experiencing this - that this IS someones life. its sad, really to think about just how many women have to suffer and give up their lives, their DREAMS just because of this stupid anti abortion law. and its crazy how so much women have to go through suck risky procedures just to get rid of a baby. its not helping either that the philippines is a catholic/ christian heavy country. meaning that in their eyes, abortion is evil and murder. we see this in the film, and the film executed and protrayed it perfectly. we see how sunshine is slowly becomes confuse because why should sunshine apologize? if god is so forgiving, couldnt he forgive her for fighting for her dream? i am catholic but people who think that god wouldnt forgive women for aborting their children confuse me. also, i forgot to mention that we also see how sunshine prays before doing anything bad, just shows that she has some catholic guilt/ conscience.sunshine didnt even want a baby, was it her fault miguel didnt pull out? why should she be pressured to give birth when she never wanted it? think about it, why should women pay for mens incompetence? its crazy how so much men think that just because women carry the baby means that they have to carry all the burdens and troubles too, like hello? ure also a part of this too LOL. speaking of men, FUCK that bobot guy  sunshine was so right for what she did to him and i will forever defend her for that. but, lets not forget that this is the reality of some women. its just gross and inhumane. FUCK YOU BOBOT!! now lets talk about the people who supported sunshine along the way, starting with her sister. Honestly, with how close they were i was really surprised that sunshine never told her. all of their scenes were just so heart warming and it really just felt so comforting. i feel like she was someone that sunshine really needed at the time and yknow those words probably meant so much to sunshine. i got a little teary eyed during that scene cuz it was just so next, the doctora. notice how it was a woman who risked her lisence and did everything to save the pregnant girl? yeah, thats what i call girlhood  but yeah, i was just so happy that someone, an actual stranger, reached out a helping hand. even though she had very little screentime, i really enjoyed her character and it really just showed that there are still some good people out there.moving on, we have the pregnant girl. her hug with sunshine absolutely made me cry. idk, maybe seeing someone going through the same things as her just brought some comfort like atleast theyre both in this together. her almost dying made me feel something, it was either goosebumps or just deadass misery.. i guess a HM would be the coach. (no i am not mentioning the kid cry about it )overall, this was such a beautiful movie. i felt everything and it just captured the life of a filipina so well. just shows how much one person could be going through and how much a woman has to do to simply get rid of her baby. def watch this if you have time!!",-1
Sunshine,"second watch, naiyak pa rin ako sa last performance ni sunshine HUHU GANON SIYA KAGALING!!! ramdam na ramdam yung pagmamahal niya sa ginagawa niya. ang galing mo, maris racal. ",-1
Sunshine,ganda tangina!,19
Sunshine,"love you, sunshine. love you, maris racal, they could never make me hate you.",2
Sunshine,it hits harder the second time. GETS NA GETS KO NA (watched it with mom),18
Sunshine,"Its interesting how we yet blame a woman for everything and say nothing about man's actions. This reminds me of the Barbie movie especially that one line""it is literally impossible to be a woman""",-1
Sunshine,"this was so realistic. and also so realistic in showing how fucked up the system in our country really is.people say things like ""paano kung 'yan yung maging susunod na president?"", ""paano kung 'yan yung makahanap ng cure sa ganito gan'yan?"" when talking about a fetus that might be aborted, when those questions should honestly be applied more about kids who were forced to live a messed up system that was also because of adults, just like yung kay mary grace. her case happens a lot in real life. many children as young as 13 are forced to be pregnant and become mothers. like imagine, a 13 year old?? that's a kid. anddd hindi ko rin talaga magegets (and never will, honestly) yung mga tao na hindi pro-choice who doesn't care if pregnancy happened because of rape. tangina niyo. another thing, dahil nga illegal pa ang abortion in the philippines, a lot of kababaihan would resort to ""pangpa-regla"" and other unsafe procedures para lang makapag-abort. if the healthcare system truly cares about the people, why prioritize the ""life"" of a fetus, imbis na sa taong buhay and humihinga na? bakit kailangan pa silang maghirap? and i like annika's character here also symbolizing sunshine's guilt. kahit na parang desidido na talaga si sunshine noong una pa na she wouldn't keep the baby, there still lingers a feeling of guilt inside her, yunv parehong religious and personal guilt. and yung sa last part, her saying na ""gets ko na""... ay, putangina, i love it.i really hope this movie would serve as an eye opener sa bansang 'to rsgarding abortion, and i also hope that people become more open-minded. sana maging legal na ang abortion. hay, tangina kayo",4
Sunshine,"Gets ko na si Sunshine.Sometimes I fail to remember how Philippines such as other countries, do not have the same privilege as first world countries do. Imagine the first thing someone says to you after you almost die from trying to have an abortion “Say sorry to God, be thankful He is forgiving. Be thankful that your child is still here.” Women shouldn’t have to feel guilt or religious pressure to have a baby they didn’t want. It should always be their choice, their right to their own body. I hope one day that the Philippines legalises abortion, it’s healthcare after all.I’m just so glad she didn’t let go of her dreams. ",11
Sunshine,"“yung pangarap ko, kung anong pangarap niya.” SOUL SHATTERED. FUCK MEN.",-1
Sunshine,oh my God,1
Sunshine,plz sana gawing legal na ang aborsyon sa pilipinas !!!!!!!,3
Sunshine,"parang every 5 seconds napapasabi ako ng putangina eputangina nung bobot, nung doktor na santa, nung doktor na takot mawalan ng lisensya, ni miggy, nung nanay ni mary grace,,,, putangina ng lahat!!!!!",0
Sunshine,"If your moral values believe that no child should be aborted, sana kasama rin sa values nyo na walang babaeng deserved na mahirapan dahil sa unwanted pregnancy. Women needs to have choice, if we always shame women na nabuntis, bakit hindi natin ibaling sa mga nakabuntis ang sisi? Sa buong panonood ko, nainis ako kay Elijah Canlas, sa nanay ni xyril, kay Piolo Pascual, dun sa nagtitinda ng pampalaglag, dun sa doctor na ayaw mag-admit ng batang naghihingalo dahil gumawa daw ng ilegal (mind you, narape yan kaya sya buntis), at sa ospital na hindi kayang i-cater ang pangangalaga sa mga kababaihan. Sana imbes na ijudge si sunshine sa choices nya, sana namulat tayong lahat na we should be free of our choices. Na hindi tayo selfish dahil lang ayaw natin ng anak. And that we are entitled to be taken care of kahit ano pang desisyon natin when it comes to our pregnancy. Sobrang lupit ng mundo natin, na patuloy na nagtataas ng kilay kapag tungkol sa SOGIE pero wala ring ginagawang hakbang kapag nagkakaroon ng unwanted pregnancy ang mga kababaihan. I love this movie so much. It is by women for women",-1
Sunshine,"live, laugh, love women who chose themselves and palabans. heavy crying sa scene nila jennica, kasi may ate rin ako na very very supportive sa'kin",30
Sunshine,gets kita sunshine,2
Sunshine,"tangina, hirap maging babae. i already knew this film was going to be good, yet it still managed to move me deeply. the acting was so astounding that it truly felt like i was witnessing people actually living their lives in real time. it’s horrifying to watch sunshine and the other girl struggle with unwanted pregnancy throughout the film. unjust laws, religion, traditional norms, and other people’s opinions should NOT be barriers to abortion. give women access to healthcare!!",5
Sunshine,i love you sunshine,2
Sunshine,Naiintindihan mo ba ko?Gets ko na.,21
Sunshine,galing ni maris !! sobrang convincing as in ramdam ko agad yung aligaga at takotang hirap talaga maging babae lalo sa pinas sh e t,-1
Sunshine,"the miggy dad reveal took me to a place LMAOOOO AND THEN HIS JOB DESCRIPTION WAS REVEALED TOO AND I JUST - but in all seriousness, this movie delivered what it wanted to give. it felt like a perfect balance between showing the best-case and worst-case scenarios you could face without ever implying which is ""bad vs. good"" or ""right vs. wrong."" it was straight to the point, but commentary all the same. yes, some moments felt draggy or even unnecessary to the plot, but overall, i would say it was well-thought-out and worth a watch",23
Sunshine,ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE! WOMEN DESERVE BETTER! FUCK PATRIARCHY!,4
Sunshine,"FUCKING HELL BROhaven’t been THIS emotional because of a movie in so long. i have so much to say & this letterboxd log is too soon for me to compose my thoughts properly.kakampi mo ako, sunshine!!",-1

Sunshine,"The moment na sinabi ni Maris Racal sa harap ng Boyfriend niya at sa Tatay ng Boyfriend nyang Pastor na ""Ayokong maging Nanay"" , ""Hindi ako handang maging Nanay."" Gets ko na siya! Sa sobrang effective ng gustong iparating ng Director at pelikula na ito, kahit lalaki ka, aangkinin mo din yung role ni Sunshine na nahihirapan, na naguguluhan, na sobrang pressure sa pag abot ng pangarap pero ang daming Ingay, ang daming mapanghusga, ang daming sinasabi sayo ng nasa paligid kung anong dapat gawin o anong mali at tama. Saludo sa lahat ng Sunshine na matapang na pinaglaban kung anong dapat gawin sa sarili nyang katawan at magdesisyon para sa katawan nya. Yakap sa lahat ng biktima ng unwanted pregnancies dahil biktima ng pang aabuso, gets na gets namin kayo!",3
Sunshine,Putangina talaga ng mga lalaki!Legalize abortion! Hindi dapat ganun kabuwis-buhay ang piliin ang sarili. Hindi dapat ganun kahirap iligtas ang sarili.,4
Sunshine,good film with topics and themes that NEED to be more openly discussed especially in the Philippines. as a movie though it was kinda boring. a lot of it is just sunshine walking around. and the ‘hallucination’ of the unborn children being a part of the film felt weird to me. still so much better than longlegs so def watch it over that,-1

Sunshine,im soo sick of women suffering at the hands of men!!!! and women being the only ones showing compassion towards each other proving women hold a kind of strength unimaginable by the opposite sex.,7
Sunshine,"grabe gets niyo ba ko?! tangina nadejavu ako sa love in the big city. yung emotions ko and most importantly yung perspective ko sa ganitong 'talk' still hindi nabago. sobrang raw ng film to the point na tanging tunog ng train, jeep, traysikel, mga alingawngaw ng tao yung bumubuo sa lahat pero sobrang bigat, kasi ito yung reyalidad na hindi matanggap ng karamihan. Mahal na mahal kita direct Antoinette, dati hindi ko masyadong na r recognize yung director and staff team itself. pero simula nung natuklasan ko yung mga films mo— nagkaron ako ng pake sa mga detalye na kumukumpleto sa kung anong nakikita ko.dafawk— pero anggaling talagang umacting ni Maris, imagine sobrang raw ng film and no ost songs or so whatever pero dalang dala niya yung emotion. Also, sobrang creative sa part ng character ni Annika, sobrang hirap himayin at ilarawan ng ganitong konteksto sa pelikula, pero yung sa ganitong way, mas nakalinaw siya. Oo ako naiintindihan ko yung ganitong side of talk, pero kung i c consider to na eye opener— yes walang tapon. Sobrang ganda ng detalye sa point na walang tapong sasabihin ng maraming manonood— ""gets ko na"" ",3

Sunshine,"gets q the message it wants to convey and wala aq masabi ksi antok na talaga ako bye+ society always protect the potential of the baby but ignore but potential of its mother? paanong naiisip nila na magiging future leader or presidente yung bata without even looking at the mother, kung may pangarap ba siya, kung capable ba siya maging nanay or kung atleast safe manlang ba yung environment nya?",-1
Sunshine,"“gets ko na."" hits me",18
Sunshine,"gets ko na sunshine, gets kita.",2
Sunshine,"“Gets ko na, gets ko na.”Sobrang tumatak sakin yung line na yun.Sunshine is the kind of film that hits quietly but deeply. It shows how hard it is for women in the Philippines to ask for help, and how scary it can be, pero kahit ganun, it reminds us na may karapatan pa rin tayong mangarap.I also liked how it showed the reality of our Olympians here. You can give everything, train like crazy, be so talented, pero minsan hirap ka pa rin mabuhay. Ang bigat pero ang totoo.Sunshine’s character feels real and strong. Hindi perfect, pero may tapang pumili ng sarili niyang future. Even when she had an easier option, pinili pa rin niya yung pangarap niya. I respect that so much.Sana mas maraming babae ang makapili ng sarili nilang path, dreams, and life.",-1

Sunshine,"waited so long na maging available on digital 'yung movie na 'to and needless to say it was worth the wait because wtf ilang beses ako naiyak from the depiction pa lang ng daily life sa pinas, the customs and norms we have, to the imaginary children representing the ""could-have-beens"", and also in a way, the girls' own guilt following them with every decision they try to make for a common situation that girls—especially the young ones—suffer through here sa bansa na 'to (not just the pregnancy itself but also the internal battles that come with religious guilt and having dreams beyond what other people would call as ""a gift from God"").na-bother lang ako sa texting scenes because ang random ng pag-type sa keyboard, but hindi mo na talaga maiisip 'yon at present sa sobrang daming na-tackle for such a short film. and yet it was done so beautifully. the pacing was SO GOOD and i couldn't help but fall in love with the cinematography, the WRITING, the ACTINGGG because of how natural the lines were delivered. kudos kay direk at pang top 4 films na ata 'to !!two takeaways for me dito: there's really no hate like christian love and seeing female solidarity in films will always make me cry. (pwede na 'to i-add sa films about girlhood bcs it would be my fav on the list).",-1

Sunshine,you know ang fucked up na mas pipiliin talaga ng iba lisensya nila kesa sa tunay na integridad ng trabaho nila. itong pelikula na ito ang patunay na hindi uunlad ang healthcare system ng bansa kung may relihiyong patuloy na pinamayayagpag sa loob nito. jadaone's best,3

Sunshine,"""Walang tapon"" type of a film.Everything just drags you right in. The way they produced this definitely put their heart and soul into it, the way scenes just felt natural and realistic despite the added sense of whimsiness into it—it wasn't weird, awkward, or any different at all; it came from a place that had known and understood the situation and had continued to wrap it with care. Thank you for this film, kudos Direk Tonet! <3",-1
Sunshine,"details of the situation in the country were clearly depicted through the characters’ emotions and decisionsit made me think that the conditions of the unborn will be much likely how Sunshine currently sees her — in the streets, roaming around. their interactions showed how she is not yet ready. but she always still empathize with her, and to receive the empathy back at the end was heartwarming",-1

Sunshine,!!!!!!!!! review: tbf ,1
Sunshine,"Not everyone will agree with her choices, nor understand them. But since when is it anyone else’s business what a woman chooses to do with her own body?!The raw, unflinching exposition of a city filled with contradictions—similarly displaying the distinct patriarchal society overshadowed by the hold that Catholicism has over the views and laws held by the Philippines. It is beautifully shot and the story is even more beautifully represented through the acting. Sunshine’s story is one related to by many women and brings to light so many issues that women are facing. Her story is one of light amongst the dark; befitting her name",-1
