cyber_gecko_cdr,"Jan 8, 2016",Failed so much as a film,"NOTE: I am a Non-INC member and I was open minded when I watched this movie.

A historical film which traces the origins of the religion, Iglesia ni Cristo. Two Guinness World Records holder.

Production design was good. The set feels what era the certain scene is in. Dennis Trillo as Felix Manalo is very applaudable. Other than that, it was very flawed. It fails cinematography, the visual effects and the storyline. It is a little disjointed and rushed and full of irrelevant scenes. Obviously religiously biased and failed to enlighten both sides. Inappropriately lengthy for this kind of movie.",3
blackangel-09921,"Dec 28, 2015",Don't ever compare this to Heneral Luna,"The Legendary Heneral Luna will NEVER be compared to this useless film. Yeah, it's bloody 9.2 because of the propaganda cult.

But what if we won't believe in the Iglesia crap? It's a battle of different beliefs and this movie failed to enlighten different kinds of spirituality in people. Instead, it made non-Iglesias enraged because of the stupidity that was shown.

I had to walk out of the theater within 20 min. If you don't believe me, see for yourself. Just don't regret it.

Iglesia is Networking. Not even close to religion.

Film is a waste of time.",1
kahitanongmaisipmo,"Oct 12, 2015",Fake reviews from cult members!,"To start with, the movie is a propaganda of lies. Funded by the cult itself, their brainwashed members are forced to watch the movie (otherwise they will be kicked out of the cult), and then some more. Movie-wise, just plain stupid. Such a waste of talent from the Philippines. But hey, money talks.

The movie does not show the rape scene of Rosita Trillanes by none other than Felix Manalo. This movie is such a blunder that all their cult members rallied to IMDb to give a perfect 10 rating to this horrible, horrible film. People from around the world, please stay away from this rubbish. Iglesia Ni Cristo is a cult from the Philippines with brainwashed members around the world claiming that they're the only ones going to heaven. LOL right?

you don't believe me? check all the perfect 10 reviews for this movie. most of the accounts were created just a few days ago (after the screening of the movie). and their flock is known for that: blind obedience for the promise of heaven! :)",1
deik-33556,"Oct 9, 2015",Felix Manalo features the reemergence of the true Church of Christ in the PH,"I rated it 10 because it's so nice to see the Philippine setting back then, which is so much different from where we live today.

Imagine Manila, Taguig and Paranaque all looked like far flung barrios before.

The sepia effect is so soothing to the eye.

It also features Filipino traits like compassion to our fellowmen without asking for rents/payments.

There were moving scenes, like the war-torn Manila; yet Filipinos still thrived to do what they have to do.

It was very touching how Iglesia members back then continue to worship even there was war.

Most of all it features how the true 1st-century Church of Christ was re- established through Felix Manalo.",10
thinkforsecond,"Oct 10, 2015",Epic blunder,"Felix Manalo is quite the unwieldy pedestal for such a beloved icon. The film is tight-fisted in its desire to sanctify its subject. It provides no opportunities for discourse except for the immense one its glamorized crafting suggests.

If the purpose of the film is to enlighten, then it has failed miserably because it only persists to reinforce an image that is far too rosy and romanticized to be taken with the same seriousness one affords any other biopic with more balanced perspectives.

If the purpose however is to stir a myth out of a man's life, then the film only succeeds partially, because it only aspires to be understood and celebrated by that section of society where doubt, suspicion and curiosity are frowned upon.",1
rockwitdal,"Oct 9, 2015",Great but could have been better as a TV series,"First, let me remind you that you should remove your prejudice with this film, especially if you are a critic of the man and his religion that was depicted in the film. Just think of this as another movie from another day with historical value not only for the members of the religion but also the Philippine society.

Summary:

The story is a romanticized life of Felix Y. Manalo, founder of the religion called ""Iglesia Ni Crito"" (Church of Christ). The movies tells the man's faith in God and his search for answers for the right religion. Unable to find any religion that he believe is right, he researched more about Bible in days. That's the time decided to preach people what he believes is right and was written in the Bible. But that didn't go easy for him. He went through many hardships. He was ridiculed, despised and was threatened by those who didn't want to listen to him. But those weren't enough to make him stop. His religion continues to grow even during Japanese occupation where any religious sects are eradicated by violent and horrifying means. Due to his persistence and faith, he triumphed and survived the Japanese occupation. His church even grew bigger. The movie ends with his death and his son's (Eraño) succession as the leader of the church.

The movie is an emotional roller-coaster. You will sympathize with the characters, even if you are not a member of the church. Cast are composed of established and popular actors from the protagonist, which was played Dennis Trillio up to minor roles like Heart Evangelista, Gladys Reyes, Jacklyn Jose and many more actors and actresses. The performance of the casts are also well-done, especially Trillio,who did a great justice of the character he portrayed.

Production is also great. They did a great job portraying the life of the Filipinos in the late 19th up to early 20th century. No certain glitches like vehicle noise in the community of early Filipinos or accidental capture of a plane in the sky. Musical scoring is where the movie really excels. They really captured the atmosphere of the scenes and will push your emotional limits. The use of CGI effects were also apparent, but not to the point of ridiculousness. I think it's safe to say it's Hollywood-realistic and not overdone, granted it was only seen for a brief time.

This movie is really good, but it also has its flaws. Some scenes felt disjointed and rushed. There is no build-up on how that scene developed. The over emphasis of the church over characters is also a negative. I know it's an autobiography of a religious leader, but doctrines shouldn't be the main priority on making a movie over the expense of character development. Talented casts are wasted due to their brief minor roles, but there is only much you can do on a 3- hour movie. The story also missed some important events on Manalo's life, like the unbirth of his child from his first wife and the Rosita Trillanes case.

Overall, I still say it's a great movie for families to watch, despite it's shortcomings. One of the few Filipino films in recent years that I got emotionally attached. Yes, this one of Joel Lamangan's finest film to date but could have been better as a TV series. Whether you are a member of INC or not, it's definitely worth watching.

The good:

+ Strong casts of popular actors/actresses + Excellent settings + Outstanding musical scoring and atmosphere + Strong emotional impact + Very interesting autobiography

The bad:

Some disjointed scenes - Rushed events - Too preachy at times


I give this film a solid 9/10",9
jeremiah_ezekiel-22532,"Oct 16, 2015",it could have been better,"I really did not like the movie. Too many well-known actors that does not fit the time relevance. It would have been better to pick just one famous actor that would portray Felix and cast a not so well known actors and actresses. The audience focuses on all the cast and the attention away from the movie. For example, when you watch Heneral Luna it became a hit because they placed the right actor who are actually not so well known.

I did not like the fact that INC are forcing and threatening the majority of their members to watch. If not, they will be suspended or possibly expelled.",1
crvallejos,"Oct 10, 2015",3 Reasons Why Filipinos and Non-INC Members Should Watch Felix Manalo,"Felix Manalo is a controversial film.

He did not face a battalion of armies in the movie. He was a worm who moved mountains. As Teddy Locsin tweeted, ""the beauty of Felix Manalo movie is that the action is limited to theological points being made and won, not violence...a compelling narrative of people who took religion seriously...""

It showed how Manalo transferred from one religion to another. From Roman Catholic, to Methodist Episcopal Church, to Christian Mission and to the Seventh- day Adventist Church, with some engagements with atheist and agnostic friends.

He fought the biggest established religions in the world brought by the colonizers of the Philippines.

At a time when Filipinos had belief, he believed that we Filipinos were ready to accept the truth and ready for change.

Why did he turn his back to the other churches? His reply was short and crisp. Theirs was a false religion.

Erehe! He was called such by actor Jaime Fabregas in that awkward scene when Felix Manalo refused sacrament from the priest for his dying mother.

The social media critics of INC will definitely love or hate the heated exchanges of Dennis Trillo in the scene with Philip Salvador and Ryan Eigenmann who portrayed the role of other sect leaders in a bible exposition. That scene was, to me, one of the most elegant discourses of faith in the movie.

2. Dennis Trillo's performance is for the Oscars!

We know Trillo as a good and versatile actor. But in this movie, which essays various periods of the INC and Philippine history, Dennis Trillo transformed himself from a refined young character to an eloquent and mature charismatic leader. Even in the rhythm of his delivery of lines, he sounded very close to Ka Felix Manalo whose real audio voice is played when you visit the INC Museum at the Central Temple.

I had to re-tweet Locsin again. He posted: ""Si Dennis Trillo is an Oscar level star. What acting, soft, subtle, eloquent with difficult lines.""

Dennis Trillo has the most close-ups and most of the time, his acting is only visible with the movement of his eyes, lips, forehead and jaw. While breathing, he was already acting Felix Manalo.

For sure, Dennis Trillo will reap awards for this sterling portrayal of Ka Felix Manalo.

Bela Padilla as Ka Ata, on the other hand, is a casting perfection!

3. Felix Manalo has the makings of being one of the greatest Filipino films of all time.

If you are a non-INC member or an Iglesia basher who calls INC a 'cult' in social media, attempt to imagine that the film is just about a common Filipino, and his name is Felix Manalo.

The film is not only about him. This picture is about the strength, deep conviction, audaciousness and the indomitable spirit of the Filipino people to conquer hopelessness and ignorance.

It is also the Filipino's journey in standing up against the abuses of the rich and powerful colonizers. The fight for freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

After long and careful study of the Bible, Felix Manalo saw the inaccuracies and misinterpretations of the doctrines of the religions that he belonged to. He then taught the truth based solely on what he read in the Bible. Then he preached the doctrines of the Church of Christ, the name of the only church that Christ has built during the early times.

Like Heneral Luna, Felix Manalo can also be called a ""lunatic"" as he stood up against priests and scholars 101 years ago.

In the film, Felix Manalo said that he is not the founder of this church. He is just establishing a congregation of the Church that Jesus Christ has already founded. That congregation which he preached in small places has grown to be the most influential indigenous religion of the Philippines. INC is now a fully established global church with presence in 100 countries composed of 110 nationalities.

As long as there is a locale, church of place of worship abroad, any brethren find peace in their hearts. INC's rise from a local congregation to international prominence is the Filipino's gift to the world.

To essay this remarkable story comes a stellar cast composed of 120 of the brightest names in show business, 8,000 extras and a topnotch production team led by the multi-awarded film-maker Joel Lamangan.

Like Heneral Luna, Felix Manalo is comparable with Hollywood style of film-making. Real, cerebral, sincere and grandiose. Not a single detail was left to chance, from the costumes, props, sets and location to prosthetics and visual effects. Its production design is picturesque, giving us a rustic view of the Philippines of the past.

Its sparkling cinematography provides a different texture and color that portrays the periods of history wonderfully more dramatic in evoking the moods and feelings of those times.

And the music is majestic!

The story-telling of Bienvenido Santiago was straightforward. The message of truth is brilliantly essayed in beautiful words.

Felix Manalo has all the elements of an award-winning film and the makings of being one of the greatest Filipino films of all time.

Thus, INC bashing will be elevated to a higher level of discourse. It can transform into serious intellectual exchanges of respect and deeper conversations of faith and hope.

As a proud INC Member, I was one of the 43,624 who was accounted for by the Guinness World Records during the premiere at the Philippine Arena, earning two world records for the largest attendance.",10
johnrygarciajunior,"Feb 12, 2022",Laughable,"I watched this with a friend who tried to convert me.

trevorreyrey,"Dec 18, 2024","A testament to this religious groups boastful, money, and power.","As an exMember of this religious group (closer to a cult than anything), this movie was made only to boast of their money, prop up their current leader Eduardo Manalo, and function as a propagation tool to indoctrinate people.

Their record breaking numbers (Guinness Records) show their power of how they can manipulate/force/coerce their members to do what they will. Disguised as ""giving God glory"" in much the same way they manipulate the Philippine Government through bloc voting (forcing members to vote for the candidates who will grant them favor). When this launched in the USA, I remember our locale being obligated to rent a bus, and ""sell out"" the tickets even if people were not attending. We tried to even hand out tickets to people around the movie theater! No one wanted to watch this.

As a period piece, the set work and such were done well, but watching a film about some made-up bible hero was not fun.

If anything, this film's historical accuracy and inaccuracies poke more holes into the Iglesia Ni Cristo's fundamental doctrines about Felix Manalo being an Angel from God and the Last Messenger of God... which they use bible manipulation to insinuate this guy is greater than Jesus Christ.. and their current leader, Eduardo Manalo, is the most holiest and god-anointed person on the planet.

Recommend to watch it if you have questions about this religious group and then watch for how they manipulate the story and further manipulate them in your bible studies. 1 star cause that is the lowest it could go and do NOT recommend attempting to join this Filipino group. Zero stars.",1
omraammikhael,"Apr 9, 2024",Manalo's harem of úndéraged girls...,"The real Felix Manalo describe himself as like King Solomon who have many wives, Felix Manalo, founder of the organization Iglesia Ni Cristo, did not just rape his members; he also abused his authority by spending his members' money in all his vices.

A man who sexually abuses women and threatens to end their lives if they ever surface is beyond immoral. He who does so is evil.

A man who uses his congregation's money for sexual gratification is not just evil, he is a false prophet. He who is a false prophet is undoubtedly a son of the devil.

I pity those who continue to look up to Manalo as a religious leader.

Therefore the film is another tool to con people into the cult.",1

ijamesreli,"Oct 11, 2015",interesting and amazing,The transition of his life to how he was able to reach the gap of horses and cars is amazing. It was also an amazing depiction to how he endured the hardships of the Japanese occupation and the whole movie is moving all through itself. Most scenes escalated quickly despite the movie being that long. I guess the real movie was supposedly 6 hours and it would've explained more about the movie. The actors were all famous and the portrayed their roles perfectly well. The religious influence is inspirational and the movie is something you should watch when you really want to know more about the history of this religion. Great production design by the way.,10
jaugustoinctv,"Oct 8, 2015",A powerful story that will touch millions of lives!,"A few reviews have been made about Felix Manalo the movie. Common to those are two words; epic and monumental.

Though it is true that this movie is indeed epic and monumental, I say this is an understatement. This is only a bit of what the movie is all about. This story does not only tell of a man's life. This story tells us how a man stood firm in his conviction, to go on amidst various persecution and opposition and how he made it through it all. This story tells us on how a man anchored his faith, love and hope to the very foundation of what he believe, the Words of God and His promises.

Insignificant he may be to others during his time, the story shows the significance of what his endeavor was, to those people whose lives were touched by the work he started.

Felix Manalo is not just a story, Felix Manalo the movie is THE story that touched and will continue to touch millions of lives. This may as well touch yours, if you give yourself time to watch this movie.

Felix Manalo, a POWERFUL movie that will touch millions of lives and even breaking world records!",10

It made me cry finding out the difficulties Felix encountered as he started Iglesia. How many people would fight for what they believe even at the face of death? And how many religious leaders will truly love their members? It seems impossible but after watching this movie I finally understood why. For the benefit of your soul, watch this movie. There's a reason why I line up for it and there's a reason why viewers were teary eyed after watching the movie. I would say, this is historically important. This church raise our nationality. All Filipinos must watch it.",10
tagasparta,"Oct 11, 2015",Faith can really move mountains.,"Felix Manalo is a biopic of the first executive minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo(Church of Christ). A story about a man who sought the true religion during his time in the 1900s. His basis for seeking the true religion is through the words of God written in the Bible - testing if the religion he belongs to completely follows what was written in the Bible. Until that fateful 3 days, and the rest is history...

The cinematography is excellent for a Filipino film. You will feel as if you traveled back in time during the 1900s in the Philippines. You won't see any influence of the modern times in the film - one of the main problems I see in most Philippine historical films when it comes to the look and style of the portrayal of characters, their actions, and setting - because it breaks the illusion of the movie. The portrayal of every character is perfect - their actions and behavior reflect the time they are in. The Sepia effect is a plus, and fits the movie perfectly. It's soothing to look at. Guaranteed, you will be immersed in every scene.

One of the unique aspects of this historical movie is it's battleground. The battles are fought not on a chaotic and violent battleground, but instead in front of gatherings of people - a debate. This is a very cerebral movie, which I'm fond of, and requires the viewer to literally use his mind and think. I found it enjoyable to the point wherein after every victory of sir Felix, you would like to read the Bible to read what he has quoted. The realism is so strong you will feel like you're one of the audiences in the debate.

The only part which breaks the illusion is the CGI, but it's just in that one scene. However, it's understandable because CGI tech used is not on par with that on Hollywood films. Still kudos to the CGI team of the movie because it blended well in the background and that's no easy feat.

The original uncut version of the movie is 6 hours long, and will be released on DVDs soon. Even after reducing the movie into a 3-hr theatrical version, it still has a lot of important details. Absolutely it will increase the viewer's anticipation of the 6-hour long uncut full movie.

This film is a roller-coaster ride of emotions. After watching the movie, it is impossible to believe that Felix Manalo, along with the Iglesia ni Cristo, was able to overcome those trials and odds they faced when it was still starting; and will leave the audience in awe on the status of the church right now. A very eye-opening, very inspiring masterpiece in the art of Philippine cinema.

Recommended. Will absolutely watch over and over again. 11/10",10
sixrodriguezph,"Oct 9, 2015",I gave it 10 stars because it is a movie that EVERYONE should see!,"Felix Manalo is a historical-biographical film dramatizing the life of Felix Ysagun Manalo, the first Executive Minister of the Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC; English: Church of Christ), and the church he preached. Manalo is regarded by the members of the Iglesia ni Cristo as the last messenger of God and the restorer of the true Church of Christ, whom the INC gives the title Sugò (Tagalog, ""messenger"" or ""envoy"").

As a young man, Felix Manalo is on the path to becoming a priest, but then starts having doubt about the Catholic faith. He spends the next few years studying several of the new Protestant sects that have just arrived in the Philippines during the American Occupation. After much contemplation and study, he finds all of them lacking. This leads him to start his own ministry, which would grow into something far larger than anyone would have expected.[5]

I am glad how Dennis Trillo portrays the role as ""FELIX MANALO"" as he did it very great. Everyone should know how many religious sectors he had joined to seek for truth until God directs him to the true church which already written in the bible.

Christians and Non-Christians will benefit from all the life lessons being taught in this movie (all base from the bible). I have never seen any movie like this, EVER! This movie is about Felix Y. Manalo, a filipino whom God used as his instrument to teach his truths (TEACHINGS FROM THE BIBLE). He was a pioneer in the real sense of the term- innovative, persevering, impelled by a vision, courageous. Moreover, his faith in God and Jesus Christ was pure and unshakable. When he set out on his great mission, he was convinced it was the will of God and that God would therefore make him prevail against all odds.

Felix Ysagun Manalo was right. His success in preaching and leading the Iglesia ni Cristo or Church of Christ has been phenomenal by any standard. The Church, or the INC, as it is commonly known, has grown into a giant religious organizations from its modest beginnings. It covers the entire Philippines, north to south, with new congregations and missions in distant parts of the globe.

Awarded filmmaker Joel Lamangan sums up why Filipinos should watch ""Felix Manalo:"" ""Iglesia Ni Cristo, which Felix Manalo founded, is the only Filipino religion that has reached 100 years old already. He added that more than the birth of Iglesia Ni Cristo, the film is Manalo's journey through Philippine history. It will showcase how he built, promulgated and fought for his faith across decades.

The film tackled the origins and growth of the INC since 1914. It also covered and replicated events and locations as early as 1886 when Ka Felix was born until his demise in 1963. And this was accomplished in 58 shooting days in a period of eight months.

The Cinematography, the Theme Song, the casts are great. This movie also proves that Filipinos truly can fight globally in the world of Filming.",10
amsleonardo,"Oct 9, 2015",I gave it 10 stars because it is a movie that EVERYONE should see! :),"""If you are a non-INC member or an Iglesia basher who calls INC a cult in social media, attempt to imagine that the film is just about a common Filipino, and his name is Felix Manalo. And this is not only about him. This picture is about the strength, deep conviction, audaciousness and the indomitable spirit of the Filipino.ts sparkling cinematography provides a different texture and color that portrays the periods of history wonderfully more dramatic in evoking the moods and feelings of those times. And the music is majestic! The story- telling of Bienvenido Santiago was straightforward. The message of truth is brilliantly essayed in beautiful words. Felix Manalo has all the elements of an award-winning film. Truly, it has also the makings of being one of the greatest Filipino films of all time."" (C) Caesar Vellejos",10
valencianympha,"Oct 8, 2015",Great Movie,"Everyone should watch this movie.""It is a film that every Filipino should watch not because of anything else but because it features courage, perseverance, and everything good about being a Filipino, irregardless of one's faith.""It's is a Once in a lifetime experience. The film tackled the origins and growth of the INC since 1914. It also covered and replicated events and locations as early as 1886 when Ka Felix was born until his demise in 1963. And this was accomplished in 58 shooting days in a period of eight months.From the standpoint of Iglesia ni Cristo, ""Felix Manalo"" the movie is their way of sharing with their followers or ""kaanib,"" Filipinos and foreigners alike, INC's beginnings especially the tribulations and triumphs in making what INC is today. Morever, ""Felix Manalo"" is also geared towards non-Iglesia ni Cristo members",10

eugeniostevenson-53335,"Oct 9, 2023",Epic and Brilliant movie!,"The emergence of the Iglesia ni Cristo was truly planned by God, because it could have happened before or after World War 1, but on that day, the Church was officially registered to fulfill the time of the appearance of God's children in the last days as written in the Bible. The show was beautifully executed, and the actors who portrayed the roles were excellent. I admire Felix Manalo's portrayal; he did a fantastic job. Kudos to the entire cast and crew, brilliant!

It sounds like a remarkable movie with a compelling story and talented actors. The film not only showcases the Church's origins but also highlights how it has grown and succeeded over time, demonstrating that it is truly the work of God. I can see why you would want to watch it every year.",10
missshane,"Aug 5, 2022",HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"One of the best movies that Dennis Trillo had. Star-studded, even the small roles, puro bigatin yung casts. Moreover, Joel Lamangan is one of the best directors in the Philippines. Now, I understand why Dennis got the the best actor award from this film.",10
glennsallan,"Oct 10, 2015",Superb!,"I've watched the movie twice (First on Premiere Night and first Saturday of its release) and it was great! it portrays the early classic era of Philippine History. INC has so many haters in its own country but it managed to last up to 100 years and it became powerful. The story is about the founder of INC who resist the obstacles and challenges of the society who is eager to persecute his faith despite his objective of bringing the true church written on the bible. As of today these things are continuously on the works, attempting to bring down the church and is always envying its victory to all walks of life. No one can convert anyone into something but just himself. i am inviting everybody to come see the movie in flesh before speaking things they don't have any proof of.

Everyone is invited to our church gatherings after seeing this movie:)",10
kade_artiaga,"Oct 10, 2015",The movie was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,"The perfect movie for someone who had already given up in life, for those ones who were looking for hope, for love, or for anything to hold on to help them keep moving, this movie is really inspiring and will help and give them hope, courage, determination in the darkest age in their lives. The storytelling of Ka Bienvenido Santiago was straightforward. The message of truth is brilliantly essayed in beautiful words. It was so powerful, epic and emotion-stirring movie.

bonalosmaryrosefaith,"Nov 9, 2015","Biopic film ""Felix Manalo"" is AMAZING! Two thumbs up!","I rate it 10 because biographical film ""Felix Manalo"" is really inspiring and can really inspire the lives of many! It shows the humble beginnings of the Iglesia Ni Cristo and it moves our faith that this church's really belongs to Him. An eye-opener to everyone and a must-see film! I just want to clarify things; we are not required to watch this film. It was our heart that wants to watch this biographical film. It made us proud as an Iglesia Ni Cristo member. Two thumbs up for Mr. Dennis Trillo for portraying our beloved first Executive Minister, Brother ""Felix Manalo"". You did a great job po. The acting is SUPERB! Thank you also for directing this film Direct Joel Lamangan. It touched our life and especially our Faith.

Ms. Bella Padilla is also great in her acting! Thank you po. The cinematography, production design, location, props, costumes, and scoring of this film is also great and well defined. The sepia effect will also move you; it was like you were really back in old time especially during 1900's and as if you were travelling in different places in the Philippines. The effect perfectly fits in the film. Until now, I can't even hold my tears while remembering and recalling every scenes in this film especially my favorite line when Ka Felix said ""I did not received my calling from you, but from God"". It actually gives chills.

Teachings inside the church are from the bible. ""Walang labis at walang kulang"". This film will also show you the history of our faith. This movie also tackles our faith, on how we should love and not to lose hope. I will now wait for the 6-hour uncut of this movie on DVD. I can't really wait to have a copy of it. My family is also excited to watch the 6-hour movie.

Everything about this movie is so beautiful, truly AMAZING and monumental. You can also learn many things in the movie. A must watch for everyone! It is still showing nationwide and already reached half way around the world, it last premieres in London! Everyone is invited to watch! This powerful movie will also answer your questions about our church. What are you waiting for? Visit the nearest cinema near you!",10
ravenous-55608,"Mar 1, 2016",Good film. Don't get influenced by disgruntled expelled members.,"This was a good film. This is why the rating is 9+ stars from those who watched it. It's very obvious that the majority (not all) who are rating this movie 1 star are disgruntled, butt-hurt, jealous, cry baby, need-a-hug type people. Watch the film and rate it for yourself. I rate it 10 stars because a large part of my life relates to it, but you don't have to take my word for it. Again, watch it for yourself. I went with a group of non-INC friends and they all loved it. The Church didn't make this film to make money, and no member, or no one for that matter, was forced to watch this film. This film was meant to simply share our faith, so that those who want to know more about the Church could watch it. If you're all so butt-hurt about the movie, why'd you watch it in the first place? Propaganda? That's just stupid and dumb to say that.",10

A film that is about historical figure who fought for what he believes in.Joel Lamangan, the director, gained my deepest respect for his craft and talent.Everyone should watch this movie about the courage of one Filipino who dedicated his life to seek such truth about his belief.

Manalo and the history of the Iglesia Ni Cristo (Church Of Christ)is beautiful. The story, actors, chemistry, cinematography, music is very inspiring and lovely. A great movie that everybody should watch. It's a ""must-see movie.""Grand production and a captivating performance from Dennis Trillo (Main Actor) might be the one of the reasons to see 'Felix Manalo' as the story seems quite sure it has enough juice. Its narrative feels exciting and make Felix Manalo a must-see movie,and sees him as true leader and the First Executive Minister of Iglesia Ni Cristo. There are interesting story lines for Manalo, but it jumps to how he preached the said religion, how he faced rejections, Persecution and test to his leadership. Knowing him intimately enough to understand his actions and beliefs. My favorite line of Felix Manalo in the movie is ""I did not receive my calling from you, but from God."" I cry every time I see it as well",10
nco_que_alreyes,"Oct 11, 2015",Truly Inspiring,"A must see film of faith, love, and hope that will inspire everyone.

Unwavering faith, and how it was fought for.

Determination, from one man to now a nation.

To God be the Glory.

INC or NON-INC, this is a film to see.

Everyone can learn about unity.

Very educational for Filipinos to know about the history of when the Japanese arrived in the Philippines, and how the Americans fought along them.

It shows how faith can overcome any trials and hardships.",10
jericopikipitsma,"Oct 12, 2015",superb cinematography,"The movie has superb cinematography and good story lines.What I like most with this film is the way the director compressed the scenes without sacrificing the story lines.The actors are good in delivering their lines.Inasmuch as the settings is from 19th century the costumes are great and delicately selected to have a good view of 19th century.The movie depicts the story of a man who inspite of trials and tribulations that came along his way,did not waver in his faith and stiid his ground in his calling.This movie is very inspiring and it gives people an insight on who this person is and what he did to our country.He led a church dynamically and with that great leadership I think it just behooves for us to imitate someone who leads something .",10

I was moved and inspired by the movie.from the beginning to the end, it was all breathtaking. The cinematography is so great that it looks like one of the internationally made movie. Dennis Trillio's role was excellent and I felt like he really prepared himself for this role. Although some prosthetic need to be improved but the whole story line covered up some lapses and shortcoming. I hope this movie will be the foundation of the future Filipino movie making in the future.",10

It encompasses the beliefs, traits, and discipline of a person towards seeking the truth in a religion.

It shows the hardships of Filipinos during the japan colony.

No matter what happen still your partner will be at your side to support and love you whatever it takes.

A story of sacrifice and perseverance.

The transition of their lives to how they were able to reach the gap of horses and cars is awesome.

Imagine our means of transportation nowadays with the use of horses instead of using luxurious cars.",10
andrewdec,"Feb 26, 2016",The Iglesia Ni Cristo is the True Church,"I am so happy that a film about the history of Bro Felix Y Manalo and the Church of Christ (Iglesia Ni Cristo) has finally made to world cinema.

This film has been long over due.

There is no doubt that the Iglesia Ni Cristo is the true church restored by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in these last days through the preaching function of the last messenger of God, as written and prophesied in the Book of Revelation and the Book of Isaiah.

Praise God for the restoration of the true church in the Philippines on the outbreak of the first world war, in these last days!

olanchromebook,"Nov 13, 2015","Great Cinematography, truly a work of Art","Initially, the teaser trailer was made elegantly. It was giving goosebumps to most viewers. The timing of shots was made to beautifully craft the story.

The performance of Dennis Trillo, memorizing long lines was delivered naturally. Bella Padilla acted greatly giving life to a more watchable film in the sense that the film not only became historical but also love story.

The story also tells how the Iglesia Ni Cristo, a religious organization in the Philippines has started. It started from humble beginnings in Punta Sta. Ana Manila. Being a minority religion in the Philippines, it was able to overcome many obstacles.

Now, Iglesia Cristo holds many titles at Guinness World Book of Records due to member's unity which was explained in this film.",10

This film portrays how the Church of Christ, which is now in more than 100 countries, territories, consisting of different nationalities started in a very humble beginning. It possibly could not be done by just one man, but it is evident and possible with the help and guidance of the Almighty.

Convincing acts, very eloquent delivery of speeches 3. Story line was intellectual and very poetic as if watching Shakespearean 4. The movie showed Filipino culture. Focused on small details that involved culture and the transition of fashion, language, transportation, and the role of women in those times. 5.

ivansavior,"Oct 21, 2025",Inconsistent. Holy.,"The Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ) will keep using the 2.8 million number because it sounds small when you compare it to the entire Philippine population. Once you convert that number to percentages, the excuse collapses. INC Filipinos account for 2.47% of all Filipinos. If every INC adult were eligible and registered to vote, their absolute ceiling is 4.64% of the national voter pool. With a realistic turnout of 81%, their functional voter share sits at 3.34%. Philippine elections are routinely decided by 2% to 5% margins. That margin range is exactly where a bloc vote flips outcomes. The closer INC gets to mobilizing the full 2.47%, the more that bloc controls any election result.

Let's share this on an open media platform for Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ) members. On Reddit, search for the subreddit community named: exIglesiaNiCristo.",1
