kupatea,"Oct 29, 2020",Good animation but story writing needs improvement,"The animation was fun to watch specially that you don't see that much Filipino animation online.

The thing that I don't like about this movie is that it has too many dirty jokes that aren't that funny, and I think it would've been done better if the jokes were timed right. The story flow was messy, some parts were fast, some parts were slow. I actually found myself watching this movie with a straight face, i guess i was expecting too much since the teasers hyped me up?

Guess the way the story was written isn't my cup of tea. Kudos to those people who worked on this animation! hope to see more animation projects in the future",6
whiteboiii30,"Nov 4, 2020",Good Overall,"I set my expectations low, when I saw the mainstream local actors were the voice of the characters. Its premise as typical cheap romantic comedy gives me a bad vibes because of reputation of poorly-made-overused plot lines that plagues Filipino mainstream cinema. But I still give it a chance because Filipino animations are not common. I like the cultural references and the catch of the story. I think making it as adult, dark comedy animation film is a great move. In short ""Hayop Ka!"" Exceeds my expectations, 7/10.",7
Lloydee98,"Jan 11, 2021","IT'S CLICHED, FUN AND QUITE TOUCHING","During the first half of ""Hayop Ka,"" tons of cliches from filipino teleseryes and movies were shown, including some funny jokes and references. But after an argument scene that features Robin Padilla's terrific voice acting, the film actually got better. Despite being quite annoying during the first half, the character of Nymfa won me over due to her journey and the ending wherein I realized that a lot of Filipinas end up with the same situation.",7
riyandans,"Oct 31, 2020",A suprise from SEA,"Well the animation is good also VA and character design, but storyline need some improvement i was just get disappointed when how the ending comes like that i just kinda hoping that after credits there is some sort epilogue will explain how Nimfa's life foward. But this movie also need some more audience to watch the movie it's a good movie so tell people to watch this movie.",7
paul_m_haakonsen,"Jan 25, 2022",Funny and enjoyable...,"When I stumbled upon the 2020 Tagalog animated movie ""Hayop Ka!"", I had no idea what I was getting myself into here. But I read the synopsis for it, and have to say that I was somewhat intrigued, as ""Hayop Ka!"" sounded like something definitely aimed at a more mature audience.

And I will say that writers Manny Angeles, Avid Liongoren and Paulle Olivenza definitely managed to put together a story and plot that was every bit as entertaining as it was enjoyable. So yeah, ""Hayop Ka!"" was a wholesome animated feature for a mature audience. And when I say mature audience I don't mean that it is XXX-rated, but merely that there were references and hits towards lewd nature.

The art style in ""Hayop Ka!"" was strange, but enjoyably so. Initially I was a bit taken aback by the art style, but it quickly grew on me and I came to enjoy the art style that they used here because it was definitely complimenting the story and the message of the movie.

With ""Hayop Ka!"" being an animated movie, a proper voice cast ensemble is a must. And luckily they did have that here. While I am not familiar with Tagalog cinema, then I wasn't familiar with a single voice here. But I will say that the voice acting was good and definitely gave the characters life on the screen.

I found ""Hayop Ka!"" to be an enjoyable surprise of a movie, and definitely is an animated movie that I would recommend for a mature audience that enjoys light-hearted and funny stories. The fact that ""Hayop Ka!"" was told as an animation wasn't really a hindrance in any way.

My rating of director Avid Liongoren's ""Hayop Ka!"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6
pzct,"Dec 26, 2020","You Filthy Animal, Nimfa XD","Hayop Ka - About the female cat known as Nimfa, who has to decide if she wants to be with her macho boyfriend who she's been with for years or a rich gentlemen guy. The movie has it's ups and downs

Pros:

Character Designs and Animations - Let's go ahead and point this out. I thought the designs for the characters were unique. To the point where I can easily identify where these characters came from. Not only that, but the animation was beautiful!! I enjoyed the movement of these characters!

Repeating Premise with a Surprise - It has been done to death Yes. A female that's tired of her broke life so she wants a chance at the richness and luxury. That's pretty much what Nimfa does in this movie. She leaves her ex to join the rich and luxurious life. Except instead of realizing she was better off with her old life, she doesnt get neither men. Her Ex was now taken and she caught her Rich boyfriend cheating. So the premise is repetitive but there was a nice twist for me!

Roger - If I had to say which character stood out to me more, it was definitely Roger. He was the best character to me in the movie. Because he was trying his best to provide for his girl while staying loyal to her. While admittingly, he is at fault for giving her the same repetitive lifestyle she grown tired of, I felt like he didnt deserve to be lied and cheated on. Plus, his design is pretty hot owo Strong Muscular Dog

Radio Host - I forgot his name but the radio show host straight up tells Nimfa all the wrong things she did. It was the best moment because somebody needed to set things straight with her

Cons -

Third Act/Final Act - The film was going pretty solid so far. That was until the third act or the part where Roger was bailed out of jail for destruction to somebody's car and putting someone in the hospital. After that part, I personally felt like the story kind of fell apart. Nimfa does have a guilty mind for the decisions she made, which is understandable. But here is one that I felt like fell apart: Nimfa getting pregnant with Roger's baby. This was when literally Nimfa and Iningo finished having sex on the beach. She was pregnant next day and it was Roger's baby. I was confused because they havent had sex in a while! She was pretty much banging Iningo. Plus, I felt like this was a bit out of place for something like a pregnancy to happen. There are more to it but watch the film. You'll understand why I felt like the third act of the film kind of just fell apart. Not only that but the ending felt so unsatisfying. Since the third act pretty much broke apart, the ending felt unsatisfying

Overall, A solid movie at best. Of course the story is pretty much basic but with a neat rwist. I just felt like the movie was dragged down by the third act of the film",7
rhardo,"Nov 14, 2020",It's a good start!,"It's a good start! In fact, I can call the whole thing a masterpiece from a creative standpoint. Surprisingly, it was entertaining despite the usual Pinoy the-other-woman trope surrounding the plot (but come on... Filipinos are more than just a Telenovela audience). I have to commend the team behind this project, though, for being bold and for choosing an unconventional direction-we don't get to see a 2D-animated anthropomorphic characters featured in an adult infidelity-driven storyline everyday, do we? Overall, kudos to Rocketsheep Studio for a very fine job! The Philippine animation industry has really come a long way. Keep on!",9
gege-24317,"Nov 1, 2020",Awesome visuals; weak story,Really impressed w/ the visuals and animation. Story could work a bit better tho.,5
candadhanik,"Oct 31, 2020",Coolest slice of life comedy!!!,This is the funniest and coolest slice of life comedy that I've ever seen. This is the reality of life. I really loved every details of it. It's a sad and happy story. I laughed a lot with this film and the part where empoy sang almost brought me to tears. Thank you for the filipinos who did this. I hope you continue doing more of this amazing comedy film. That was very entertaining and honest. Great characters. Thank you very much. 🙂,10
titotitomanbaby,"Nov 24, 2020",The Nutshack is better than this,This is just a furry cartoon with a Philippine teleserye cliche.,1
royhectorkabanlit,"Nov 1, 2020",A Must Watch for me,"The Movie is pretty good, the dialogue is very witty, and very Filipino. Some or most of the Jokes I'm not sure Foreigners will appreciate as much, like when Nimfa said, ""sa Pares pa talaga nag propose"", LOL.

The Characterizations were also pretty good by everybody in the Cast. The Plot is also very Filipino, like Nimfa supporting her Sister's Education, etc. and it is not as predictable as you might think, there are some surprising twists in the Story also.

Stick around for the Credits, the rest of Nimfa's Story is also shown in Story Board format. And I also loved Empoy's rendition (I think it was Empoy) of Jose Mari Chan's ""Beautiful Girl"" at the end. Overall it is a Must Watch for me.",10
grajalescade,"Nov 7, 2020",A strong story but a weak ending,"Although the visuals looked so good, the story doesn't reach the Steven Spielberg storyline, but it could have some improvements",5
aumarivero,"Nov 20, 2020",Past the Vulgar Theme is a Message,"The Theme: Past the dirty jokes and the sex theme of this movie is a filipino masterpiece, no doubt about that. Congratulations to the makers of this film. It's not usual that Filipinos brave an animated movie production like this, so kudos to you guys for that.

The Production: Angelica, Sam and Empoy are personalities fit for their roles. The dubbing could have been improved though. This caveat for me is that there are some scenes where the emotions and interaction of the characters seem so disconnected with each other. Did they record separately? Together? It's not majority of the movie but there are just some scenes that felt like they aren't talking to each other but are just speaking in character by themselves.

But the character design, the vulgarity of the screenplay, I agree that these are great creative routes for marketing purposes. They worked for me.

And I like that this movie was able to feature a pinoy world in a not so cliche way... the saleslady, the pares house, papa george.. seeing filipino icons in an animation is so funny itself. I love these.

The Story: The ending is definitely THE conversation starter. Why did she 'happily' come back to that pares house with jerry? Isn't that place what she's trying to leave for so long? Or was it really roger she's been tired already?

Is the ending a picture of failure? As in going back to square one or zero?

Or is it a depiction of a second chance at love at the same start?

I don't know the answers but I'm happy to be intrigued.

Good job and again congratulations to the team behind this. :)",8
bergenkremer,"Jan 29, 2021","Visually pleasant, rather disappointing story-wise","All that is good in this title is it's eye-catching art. Granted, I watched the English dub, so I could have missed a lot of untranslatable jokes throughout the movie, but it seemed that most of them are toilet humour and jokes for 12-year-olds anyway. The whole plot revolves around such trivial and beaten tropes that nothing in the movie strikes me as exciting or unexpected. This title could have tried to be anything else but the cheesy and unoriginal romcom that it is, and with the beautiful art direction it could be more mature and bring more to the table in terms of story and characters. The main plot doesn't grab any stars from the sky, nor does it even try to be original. My takeaway: I would love to see more projects by the animation team behind this movie, but in a title that will actually make me feel something.",5
merylldiola,"Jan 11, 2021",PLEASE MAKE MORE FILMS LIKE THIS.,Totally love it! Hope they make more 👉👈. Laughter all the wayy plus the animation style is superb.,10
Frutic,"Jan 26, 2022","Nice graphics and amusing characters, but terrible message","The movie has been a pleasant eye candy visually, the characters somewhat enjoyable,though a bit insipid and cliché. But what is the moral of the story? Its OK to cheat? Its OK to laugh and be angry on somebody because he is poor and you want more than that, that you just like him for sex, and insult him for loving you and wanting to be with you? Not saying he was the greatest but the main character was angry at him and laughing at him for unreasonable motives.

Also throwing a fit over something she herself ends up doing, having unprotected sex resulting in a baby?

And happy in the end because..what, she made a new friend? Almost instantly after a rage fuelled cat fight with the rich guy and his""friend""

What is the reason of this movie? I feel sorry for the animators that had to put up with such a dull content. They made me give it 3 stars rating and one more star for some amusing scenes. But it's not saving the movie at all.",4
mikaelquizon,"Dec 28, 2020",Love it!,A whole lot of pun and the animation is superb! A punny take on classic Pinoy radionovelas brought to life!,10
adriannieva,"Nov 3, 2020",New Cover Same Book,"Same story line as what other rom-com filipino film already has. A girl torn between a dust poor and extremely rich lover. With animation, you can show more of your imagination that is difficult to perform with live actors but unfortunately they stuck with the usual filipino content.",3
kirkespinar,"Oct 30, 2020",Philippine Animation at its best,"I loved every single bit of it. From the animation, to the witty dialogue, to the story (you'll like it better once you're aware that it's supposed to be a parody of Filipino teleserye romcom tropes), and even the music. As contrary to what some might have said about it, I actually find it to be pretty woke and progressive, with its not-so-subtle nods to current social issues such as contractualization, police brutality, etc. Like, there was even a scene in the film where you can find a poster with Duterte's face on it depicted as a literal dog; how can you be more woke than that? Politics aside, I really enjoyed the film overall. I hope Hayop Ka! manages to inspire more Filipino creatives to express the wonder of Filipino culture more and to be able to show to the world how amazing Filipino talent can be.",10
ArtSmart-40856,"Oct 30, 2020",A visual feast,"A visual feast. I have to pause the scenes every once in a while to appreciate every details. Imagine our chaotic metropolis interpreted by impressionist artist exploding with colors and lights. Dark scenes highlighted with glimmering lights inbetween and daytime landscapes so detailed that even captured the tangled electric cables, bumper to bumper traffic, rusty rooftops and most realities in the city we live in and yet somehow so mesmerizing to see in their own way. The same studio that created Saving Sally, you can easily tell their signature style that separates them from other animation studios here and globally. Much like Cartoon Saloon, an animation studio based in Ireland (Song of the Sea, Bread Winner to name a few of their movies) focus on their unique styles of visuals in their story telling. Each cells worthy to be printed, framed and hanged in your living room. Kudos to the talented creatives and artists. You are making a difference indeed.",10
magsirover,"Oct 31, 2020",A Rocketsheep exceptional,"As what reviewer Artsmart stated. Hayop Ka! (You Animal!) is exactly stands out as a note worthy ""visual feast"". and in addition to this, I would like to sincerely congratulate the makers of this animation. It is truly a great work of art, following ""Saving Sally"". Who would have thought they'd actually release yet, another amazing show. Not to mention, The casting and dubbing for the voices of this was truly exceptional. Although, it is not an animation that can be for all ages. It is a true treat for both Film and animation enthusiast of legal age. If our entertainment could release shows in such feat, I am looking forward to more of these. Please watch Hayop Ka! and support our local art industry.",10
psalmgerhartbecodovargas,"Oct 30, 2020",Great movie but ruined by a voice actor,Great animation. Good story. The VA's were mostly okay but it was Robin Padilla's voice who ruined the entire mood of the movie. It's creepy and cringey. Hoping they will re-release it with a new VA replacing Binoy's part.,9
jffry-95918,"Jan 8, 2021",Greatest Filipino Animation,I love everything about this movie! From story to the animation itself! There's more to it than you saw.,10
breadandhammers,"May 12, 2023",Delightful,"A Cat meets and falls in love with the handsome and rich Wolf of her dreams, despite having an ordinary Dog boyfriend. This is a loving send-up of Filipino soap operas, with a touch of raunch and a lot of charm. The film ends with Nimfa getting pregnant with Roger's child, having broken up with both Roger, her dog boyfriend, and Inigo, her wolf boyfriend. She actually has a hinted at romantic relationship with Jerry, the Frog.

What a delightful and funny film. You feel the loving sendup of Filipino soap operas, all carried along with its charming and adorable art style. The film dips into hilarious raunch for a few moments, just enough to spice things up, but is still pretty elevated. A wonderful film. Personally, I don't think of this as a ""dirty"" film.",No Rating
