ruke256,5,"I was pretty much on the bandwagon with this movie, mostly because of the devoted effort that the animators have worked on from Rocketsheep Studio's last film from 2016, Saving Sally, a beautifully made film mixing animated and live-action elements in a seamless polish, only to be pulled down with a standard plot and intolerable characters. So even with my skewed expectations for this film, I still do hope that this would fare better, and...It does, but it does not at the same time. So I may as well start out with the cons before the pros, and these have to do with the story and themes itself and how the tone can clash with the animation. Given that it's rated 18, the themes that it tackles do fit well, but how they are executed is in poor taste, which does remind me of how Saving Sally executes its own mature themes, but at least this film gives these themes a bit more room for discussion, even if it's dealt with in a sour, and sometimes questionable manner. The story is simple yet dramatic and can hit some good moments. I just wished it was a bit longer and does not cut through dramatic scene to dramatic scene so quickly, which made the resolution and ending so spotty, unsatisfying, and utterly rushed. The overall tone can clash with the animation in a consistent way, as some scenes do not mesh well with the hyperbolic nature of the animation, which can make some of the melodramatic scenes to be unfit and oddly uncomfortable with the cinematic and energetic flow of the animation.Pushing the flaws aside, I will say that the animation is excellent all throughout. Smooth, expressive, and gives the characters a lot of personality. The backgrounds are detailed with anthro versions of real-life brands, mottos, and references which gives more attention to detail to the movie. And the performances for the most part are also in their A-game as well, especially Angelica Panganiban.Even despite my mixed feelings for this movie, I still do want to convince everyone to watch the film, because if the film managed to succeed in its streaming sales, then that would determine how many animated films would go down the line in the years to come. And hey, with the animation this good, who wouldn't be excited for more locally animated films such as this one?",2020-10-29,2,0,watch,True

reeladvicenet,5,"Even with all the controversy behind it recently, we want ""Hayop Ka!"" (""You Animal!"") to succeed. The film is a technical marvel with its animation and is truly a showcase on what our local artists can do. But nothing can save it from its very simple and one-sided characters and narrative - that have no redeeming values or whatsoever. Nimfa Dimaano (Angelica Panganiban) is a pretty cat who works as a perfume sales lady at a department store. Her boyfriend is Roger (Robin Padilla) who works as a janitor and already happy and satisfied with his standing in life. But Nimfa wants more and when she meets Iñigo Villanueva (Sam Milby), a super rich business dog, their chemistry ignites. Who will Nimfa choose? Roger’s unending love or Iñigo’s unending riches?Taking years to make, it seemed like much of the effort in creating ""Hayop Ka!"" was put into crafting its world of parody. If you're a Filipino viewer then every scene will be oozing with inside jokes that it was actually as amusing as the animation itself. Speaking of the animation, this is the strongest asset for ""Hayop Ka!"". The colorful and vibrant environments and palette make every scene stand out and the 2D animation had the perfect mix of feeling nostalgic and modern at the same time. The voice acting was good but not great. While the voice actors themselves handled the script well, there's just this feeling that the visuals and audio didn't match up 100%. Unfortunately, the film had poorly-written characters and narrative. It was too simple to the point that the characters themselves were one-sided and extremely flawed. The characters do ""bad things"" and there's little chance for them to redeem themselves given the film's running time of 98 minutes. We understand that this is a raunchy comedy but putting non-redeemable characters just for the sake of being in tone with its theme was a bad decision in our opinion. Overall though, ""Hayop Ka!"" at least had excellent comedy and visuals that will make you laugh - just don't expect to get anything else from the experience.

blaziker,6,"Story and writing: 2.5/5Animation: 4/5Characters and voice acting: 3.5/5Overall score: 10/15Rating: Decent (3.33/5)Song: ""Love Me Like You Do"" by Ellie Goulding (from ""50 Shades of Grey"") - youtu.be/AJtDXIazrMoBeing Singaporean, it's such a pleasant surprise that Southeast Asian animation is getting better and better each year given that it's a very small industry in the region, even in 2020. I got to be honest, 2020 is the year where the small and low-budget animated movies managed to be at times on par with the mainstream giants. Hayop Ka (or You Animal), from the Philippines' Rocketsheep Studios (who also produced the unique hybrid movie ""Saving Sally"") should be included on that list.The story parodies on classic Filippino soap oprea tropes, in that it's a love triangle between a saleslady, her janitor boyfriend and a rich businessman whom she feel in love with the first time they encountered each other. One of the best things about the story is that it's one of the funniest animated movies of the year. The amount of animal-related puns, innuendos and sexual tensions justify the M18 rating there, but it also sacrificed the cohesion and flow of the love triangle, an absolute shame given that it's the writing that mainly let the whole movie down (also, a little bit too many storylines to cover in such a short frame). Still, for their first animated movie attempt, the story is still enjoyable to a certain extent.But, let's talk about the most surprising element of the movie: the animation. This is easily well animated. I know I prefer 2D animation to 3D CGI, but for an animated movie made in the Philippines, this is a solid attempt! There are moments where the colours are a little bit flat, but when the animation gets dynamic, it shows the full potential of its animation and we rarely get this type of animation anymore. Kudos to the guys at Rocketsheep for such great animation.As for characters, most of the main cast are full realised, although given its 73-minute runtime, some of the development felt rushed. I feel for the main character Nimfa (voiced by Angelica Panganiban) as she struggled to keep her affection with the rich businessman a secret as well as the two main male leads. If the story is a letdown, the entertaining characters did not.I will give Hayop Ka credit for one thing: they should not be underestimated when it comes to low budget animated movies that came out in 2020, especially when it's easily one of the most entertaining low budget animated movies of 2020. It's currently available in most Asian countries that has Netflix, so if you can't wait to support Filippino animation but you are outside Asia, do keep a lookout for its release in other countries on Netflix. Trust me, Hayop Ka is a great surprise, but I truly wish for 10 to 15 more minutes of this great animated and furry parody of typical Filippino soap opreas.",2020-10-29,0,0,watch,False

echototheeye,5,"From the creators of ""Saving Sally"" comes this Filipino adult-animated film that is a visual marvel on its own right. Animation vendor Rocketsheep Studios created a visually stunning animation with a consistent style that explodes onscreen. Plus, the visual gags and colorful sequences make it stand out.Where it falls is on its story that manages to be frustratingly unoriginal and unconsciously misogynistic. While the core narrative was inspired from an actual caller story, it just rings of the flaws of typical Filipino rom-coms. And it only made the character of Nimfa Dimaano really stale.Speaking of, while she did a decent job, Angelica Panganiban is no voice actor when doing Nimfa. The only ones to stand out in the voiceover department are Empoy Marquez as Inigo's jolly chauffeur Larry/Jerry (insert stolen ""Parks & Rec"" joke here), Arci Munoz as Nimfa's best friend Jherelyn and Piolo Pascual as a radio DJ. But they cannot get over the fact that they play stock characters.Overall, ""Hayop Ka!"" excels in the animation department but settles that with a generic and flawed story.

bentraje,4,"SPOILERS all the way1) Since I watched the film with friends (through Netflix Party/Teleparty), there was entertainment in its crude dialogue and spotting out several puns, even the corny ones like in the police station: ""We Serve and Protecc"" but it became apparent, around halfway through the run time, the film has nothing else to offer.2) Inconsistent characterization with ML (Huskie). At first, he was portrayed as an arrogant rich snob by buying a whole restaurant for failing to honor his reservation. Then, for the most part, he was actually kind. Not only to the FL but to everyone. His character came back near the end where he says ""Girls no need to fight. You can share me"". But at that point it was already a hopeless case. 3) There are some potential dramatic scenes but somewhat downplayed by execution. Example near the end where the FL finds that her sister is already a parent . There is no apparent build-up. It escalated quickly, in this case, to a cat fight, which to be honest lost its effectiveness. A sample of a proper build-up is that classic ""Wag Mo Akong Ma Terry Terry"" scene. In this scene, there was also a beat of the sister returning a money FL sent through the years. I like this beat. It gives the sister a bit more depth that she is not solely living off FL's allowance and is actually serious about earning her keep. But it was just downplayed, as if it didn't happen. Like FL didn't even recognize this. It would have been nice if sister put up a fight with FL. It was all too one-sided. Also in this scene, I'm 50/50 on this. They made a joke after the dramatic scene. Can't recall it properly but it includes FL saying you are too young. You don't have breast. I might even have to breast feed your baby. Then FL's mother rebuts, don't worry I can still breastfeed while she massages her breast. Like whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut I mean per se its funny, it's just a bit out of place.4) At its current state, the writing is just an excuse to make the film rather than the basis of the film. This is a shame because the script has a potential dramatic core. I'm referring to FL discovering she is (A) pregnant not with her current BF but with her recent ex, (B) who happens to now be with her best friend and all the while (C) her sister is also pregnant. The way I would see it is her sister represents hope so seeing that hope broken also affects her. Another depth is the FL is now being a hypocrite by not practicing what she preach which is use contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancy . As you can see, there are a lot of events that carry the film. If only that drama happened much earlier and they tackled it properly with proper thought process, it would have be a concrete film. What happened in the film is FL goes to radio station and asks for advice. I mean how lazy can you be? I can't wholeheartedly recommend Jowables but at least that film did justice to unwanted pregnancy plot point5) So, for the most part of the film, our FL is the ""bad character"" for intentionally cheating. One way or another, the film will eventually redeem her. Apart from having unwanted pregnancy which audience pity, the film ""redeems"" FL by having FL's ex hook up with FL's best friend . I actually don't mind this per se. What I mind is the ex instantly became an asshole and the FL's best friend a bitch. Oh if you're wondering how does this redeem the FL, it's the case of ""I am bad, but other people do more bad to me. So I'm not that bad"" kind of narrative. It's subtle but, since at this point, the FL is now a total underdog, the audience will naturally root for her, to some degree.6) Part of #4. If only we get the side of FL's ex and FL's best friend after hearing about the pregnancy. Would have been a proper film. 7) The music, both the BGM, fx, foleys etc, are somewhat shabby choices. Can't really support this one since I'm not a music/audio person but it's the type not quite for film-material. 8) I also don't get why the characters need to be animals. In Zootopia or Beastars, it makes sense because it's part of their discrimation plot point (i.e. prey vs predator). The only reference I can is in the title ""Hayop Ka"" where the FL obeys her survival or pleasure instinct like an animal. They could have been just human characters and it wouldn't make much difference. 9) The FL's love problem is somewhat resolve by hooking up with the driver character, the frog. I'm not sure what to feel about that. 10) I like the ending montage sequence.",2020-10-31T01:14:15.561Z,0,0,watch,False

Gosh, Filipino animation definitely needs more support.In line with that need for support,major oof for the narrative. Nimfa isn't a character you would actually root for, sadly. I'm really sad how the plot is constructed and how it ended. I was really annoyed at the part wherein Nimfa was being dragged down even more for her ""human choices"" like oof, she was legit called out in a really terrible way on live radio. Gosh that was really an oof. PLUS, THAT WAS A CLIMAX MAN HHHHH. This film pretty much used a lot of stereotypes commonly seen in Filipino media hhhhhhh. Love triangles, the romanticization of pregnancy, cinderella stories, misogyny, rich families, and kinda a lot more, just oof, really. There's kinda a lot of romanticization hhhhh. Nimfa tries to be a redeeming character who's slightly politically and socially aware but that's not enough to redeem herself as a protagonist. I enjoyed a lot of the animation and references mostly. The fight scenes and change of animation styles throughout the story is what honestly allowed me to stay hooked in this film. This Filipino animation film is another huge step for animation in the country, but it is also a wake-up call for Filipino storytellers to change the landscape of storytelling. Yes, we should serve the masses and let them relate. but the more we maintain those tropes and stereotypes, the more we are to promote them in actual society which SHOULD NOT be the norm. We need more progressive stories to influence both the youth and adults. The voice acting though needs a bit of work. Also, well oof for some of the voice actors hhhhhhhh.

I appreciate the efforts of the film for tackling certain issues such as the woes of the working class, contractualization, and such. But who is this story for?Is it simply trying to portray the struggles of a modern working-class woman? Is this supposed to be a commentary for something bigger? Why does this film feel like it's an MMK episode with a high production value?I discussed this film with my boyfriend, and we both agreed that perhaps the target audience of this film is the masses and the working class. This is quite ironic because the film was released on Netflix (which caters to mostly the privileged people).Direction wise, boy I wish they hired professional VOs instead. The film would have been more bearable. The surprising delight for me is Sam Milby's performance as a VO. He's the only competent performance in the film for me.My main beef with the film is that it’s a very well made film with an awful story that perpetuates the system it wants to critique in the first place.Cheers, nonetheless to the hardworking artists behind this film.

This is not going to convince a lot of people to support animation, if the thing that they're animating is crude, disgusting and reminiscent of the problems plaguing local entertainment.This movie is an amalgamation of everything familiar and stereotypical of an afternoon at a local TV channel: homewreckers, cheaters, exaggerated rich-poor conversations, and all the things regular viewers across the country seem to swoon over on the daily. The folks over at Rocketsheep seem to think that this makes for a passable idea in the animation department. Did it work? Yes. Do I like it? FUCK NO.If the goal of this cartoonish re-imagining of a soap opera is to drown it in cutely-drawn pastel-style animation interspersed with clear homages to GMA-7's Astig Authority (afternoon segments where international anime series are dubbed in Tagalog for local audiences), then congratulations, they're going to successfully hook in the support. But to explicitly juxtapose this advocacy of creative animation with the morally replete narratives of your average Philippine soap is just deplorable. What they're doing here, is making a statement that the only way to somehow succeed and get more support from everyone is to just get what already works for the masses. This isn't something I look forward to if the future of the industry is really dictated by the preposterous concept that is this movie.Put it this way, the story can just as easily be inserted as a real-life adaptation in the hands of grubby network executives. If independent studios like Rocketsheep are already behaving in the same manner when it comes to advocating the #SupportLocal mentality, then we have a big problem here.And for the love of god, DO NOT TELL ME THIS BULLSHIT IS SATIRE. Where is the humor? The dialogue is supposed to be funny? Jesus christ, none of the writers here can write for shit.

I haven't watched this movie, and the only way you'll make me see this movie is if my viewing of the movie will not support the movie in any way.I'm writing this review right now to post my stance regarding this movie.I am all for supporting local animation studios, but my support will never come in the form of blind support. We've already heard the stories and news everywhere of Robin Padilla being casted as a character in the movie and while I do not support Robin Padilla in any way, his casting isn't what doesn't sit right with me.What doesn't sit right with me is the fact that Joyce Bernal is one of the producers of the film. For the ill informed, Joyce Bernal is a D/D/S director who is the director behind all of D/utert/e's SONAs (among some other terrible movies that she's also directed). Not only that, but Piolo Pascual is also a producer. While Piolo Pascual hasn't directly come out as a supporter of D/utert/e, he has previously worked with Joyce Bernal on a project in support of D/utert/e, and that makes him an enabler. So, we now have three D/D/S supporters/enablers involved with the movie. THAT'S what doesn't sit right with me. Surely there are other producers or actors they could've approached?I will never support the art or the creative works created by or produced/financed by supporters of this horrible administration and nor bootlickers who try to act ""apolitical"" despite being enablers themselves.Again, I am for the support of the works of local animation studios, but should that support come blindly all in the name of ""support lokal""?",2020-11-04T13:48:28.464Z,3,0,watch,False

I just wanted to lurk, read reviews, check out people’s lists, stalk user profiles and yes, read every single review to every movie I directed because i like crying myself to sleep at night. But after watching hayop ka and reading the reviews here, i was compelled to write something. Because i don’t get why people hate it so much. For me, it’s a dark comedy that tackles realities of class and socio-economic disparity in the Philippines. Nimfa’s problem is simple: she’s poor. She has to break her back working as a saleslady to pay for her sister’s tuition and pay rent, she has pares to look forward to during special occasions because that’s all she and her boyfriend could afford, she can’t even go to a motel for some sexy time. This isn’t necessary a problem except for one thing: Nimfa is dissatisfied. She is not happy with her situation. She wants more. But what can she do? She didn’t graduate and it’s very likely that she’ll be a saleslady forever. So can you really blame her when she “falls” for Iñigo? A handsome rich guy who showers her with attention? If you were in her situation, wouldn’t you? I would. So she makes one bad choice after another. Should we hate her for it? What would we rather see? Tanggapin nalang niya yung buhay niyang ganun? Ok lang yang pares ghorl masarap naman. Beauty in poverty ganun? She sees a way out, and she grabs it. I am not entirely happy with her choice but i understand why she did it. Eh sa sawa nang maging mahirap ’yung tao e. The bad choices that Nimfa makes are greatly influenced by her circumstances, circumstances that are forced upon her because she is poor. Yes cliche. Yes lagi nalang mahirap/mayaman storyline but maybe there’s a reason why the boss-katulong trope(the powerful loving the powerless) works so well in our country. Maybe it’s because most of us Filipinos still see that as the only means of escape.And hayop ka lays bare that truth: If you’re poor, falling in love out of economic need is very much a reality. This truth is prevalent in our narratives, even if they aren’t explicitly stated. Some top of mind examples are Laida Magtalas falling in love with sir Miggy(A very special love) or Maya with Sir Chief(be careful with my heart). Fuck i’m old😭😭 The difference in hayop ka is that it does away with romantics and explicitly states, with ice cold pragmatism: I am in love with you because I am poor, because you are my best option to escape this life. It’s tragic how in the world presented in hayop ka, genuine romantic love is a privilege for the rich.And another note, can i just say that the art direction is fucking gorgeous. Making drawings move is an expensive and time-consuming affair and you have to find ways to get your point across in as few frames as possible. Hayop ka borrows some techniques from Japanese animation which it uses brilliantly and comically. Future animations will surely use this film as a reference.-1 half star lang pala for too much sexual jokes. Not that im offended or anything and i’m totally fine with women exhibiting the same sexual libido and desire as men, it’s just that there were too many and most of them weren’t funny. -1 half star ulit for the ending with empoy the frog. I get that the film had to end on a somewhat lighthearted note, after it literally kicked rich prince charming out the window, mejo corny lang yung promo ng walang ka paris and laughter laughter. Other than that, methinks this is a solid film that illustrates the relationship that exist between class and love. Aesthetically, this is an important milestone in local animation and will surely be used as a peg by future similar project.Tang ina 5 na amf. Dami ko sinabi wala namang babasa.

bryllefajardo,10,"Liongoren's Hayop Ka! is a tongue-in-cheek and provocative 2D animated film seen from the perspective of proletariat catwoman Nimfa Dimaano, as she finds herself slowly loosening her morals in desperate exchange of economic indemnity. The film is deceptively simple, but functions intelligently to provide a scathing representation of the cyclical, problematic lives of the working class Filipino: their desensitisation to the methods they cling onto for their own economic benefit, the internalized sexist and especially misogynistic paradigm that remains hegemonic among both Filipino men and women, and how all this disturbingly becomes the mundanity of everyday life in a third-world country. Moreover, although the narrative might simply appear as an animated rehash of what has plagued local TV for years, it cleverly utilizes these teleserye tropes to construct a sociological examination on capitalism's destruction to society; more specifically, to the Filipinos that belong to the lower end of the social strata. Past the painfully realistic reconstruction of the plight of the working class in film, the portrayal on the bourgeoisie is also excellently handled; they're cruel and selfish, despite the already comfortable lives that they live. Hence, the anthropomorphism of these animals becomes a clever display of how capitalism has made literal animals out of us— easily succumbing to carnal desires and almost devoid of empathy.Aside from the thematic complexity of Hayop Ka!, the meticulously beautiful animation is extremely noteworthy as well. Sadly, this film has been misread by most of its viewers— its intelligent writing and thematic complexity ignored due to its vulgar, yet realistically absurd humor. Needless to say, Hayop Ka! is up there thematically, and can even suffice to be the lovechild of two classics that eloquently critique capitalism: last year's Parasite, and 1962 Mexican film The Exterminating Angel.

profkeating,7,"2019 gave us DEAD KIDS. 2020 gave us HAYOP KA. And funnily enough just like last year, I find myself in the minority who enjoyed this.There have been polarizing opinions surrounding the film's true colors: Is it a satire on the Philippines' kitsch, recycled plotlines for film and TV? Or is it just a complete piece of trash poorly dressing up as a story? I'm inclined towards the former, but I hear the latter's argument.Like DEAD KIDS, I think it's important (if you want an enjoyable watch) to see the film for what it is: Pure entertainment. It doesn't have to be deep unless you want it to. Personally, Nimfa Dimaano's story ain't that deep. It truly felt like I was just listening to an anon's juicy anecdote on some love advice radio segment, which the film was loosely based on and have the faintest clue of.The animation more than makes up for the storyline as it offsets the trashiness with charming visuals. Good job for local animators!And the voice actors were really good and well-cast. They brought out the personalities of the characters that they were portraying especially Angelica Panganiban's Nimfa.Overall, I think some people need to chill out a bit though I understand the frustration. It's not the history-making Filipino animated film that a lot of us wanted, but be glad that it's there and the doors it can open.",2020-11-02,1,1,watch,False

I love the dialogues and the way the voice fit the personality of the characters so well. I laughed a lot of times in this film and besides that the animation was really good as well.

However, this could be the potential start of more original Filipino animations being produced, as well as animation as a whole being taken more seriously here in the Philippines.

ndrnzdr,7,"Gorgeous animation and interesting commentaries on the hypocrisies and two-faced-ness of Filipino society. Had a lot of fun watching this one as I knew what to expect from the trailer. And can I just say, whoever did the backgrounds...Kudos to you guys, whew.Character development is where this film falls terribly short. I get that the whole thing was a satire on the Filipino teleserye, but eventually, you need to create characters we can root for. ""Hayop Ka"" has no one to root for and everyone to despise. The goals of each character were incredibly shallow and in the end you just hope they all get what's coming to them. The ""happy"" ending was definitely forced and undeserved.In spite of my criticisms, I do not think this film deserves the backlash it's getting. It's a very admirable effort and it can serve as an important stepping stone for future, superior animated films in this country. So no, don't boycott this film just because you disagree with its morals (it's not supposed to be for kids in the first place) or because it features a voice actor whose politics are against yours. Animation in this country is still trying to get back on its feet and while there's a lot of story improvement that could be done in this film, it's a good start, nonetheless.In short, eye candy with plot that could be way better.",2020-11-03,0,0,watch,False

(in translation 'You Are an Animal!', a profanity meaning of ""you son of a bitch!"") or simply 'You Animal!' that I've recently heard about with sum peeps on a friend's Discord server and gotta say, it's pretty alright as far as it being an animated movie of furs that's adult-oriented, especially one that is of the fairly typical two-sided romance story of a everyday common girl and guy are happy together until the slick handsome millionaire comes and steals the limelight from him, she becomes induced to her, they hook up for a bit, he isn't as crackup to what she thought he was, he leaves her, she mourns, both her and the former boyfriend meet up and try to patch things of forming feelings for each other once more, they both work together of opening up a family business and everything's all lovey-dovey in the end, plotline; you know, something that's supposedly common in the Philippine movie industry. As what one of my friends said it the best on his Twitter, think of it as a movie adaption of the 'I Will Survive' Zootopia fan comic.

ferjackson,6,"Hayop Ka! es una película animada para adultos de Filipinas, cuyo título vendría a ser un insulto, algo así como ""eres un animal"" o ""eres un hijo de puta"". Este es el primer filme animado para adultos que ha creado este país, por lo que eso de por sí merece un reconocimiento. La película trata de un trío amoroso entre una gata, nuestra protagonista, y dos perros, uno pobre y otro millonario. Dicho sea desde ya que, a mi parecer, la historia es el punto débil de la película, suele caer en territorios clichés melodramáticos que se han visto miles de veces; sin embargo, aún así tiene un buen ritmo y sus personajes son expresivos y cómicos y logran sacar adelante la trama.Donde Hayop Ka! se luce por completo es en su trabajo de animación. La película es hermosa visualmente, en especial los diseños de los fondos, los cuales son coloridos y llenos de detalles. También hay momentos donde la animación cambia repentinamente y esto le aporta un estilo particular y buen humor. Eso sí, claramente hay algunos guiños presentes que sólo un filipino podrá entender.En términos generales, estoy más o menos en la mitad con esta película. Desearía que su historia hubiera tenido un poco más de peso, pero me encantó su visualidad, su humor, y las interacciones entre sus personajes, hay un buen trabajo de voces aquí.

cocaconan,6,"Have waited for this film since one of its earliest teasers were out. Got around to watch it this day with adjusted expectations considering the political climate (not only of the country but also the stance of the attached producers and a lead actor) and my personal view of the studio's previous effort Saving Sally (2016).It plays out as a telenovela/teleserye/soap opera with themes of infidelity. The greatest standout is the animation and design even with a vague story in the background that is a lot more interesting than the main story (endo, abortion, labor strikes, etc.) Which is kind of expected as the Philippines is one of the major places of outsourcing in a lot of known animated projects (film, video games, visual effects).The voice acting is fine but could be better either with a good voice cast director or hiring the professional dubbers (which is also a rising industry here but lack of support and recognition over popular celebrities).The decision to make the cast anthropomorphic animals is likely to avoid an uncanny valley feeling. Though I also saw it as playing with their strengths as one of the strengths of Saving Sally was its monster/creature designs. Though it doesn't make a difference here if they did it with human figures anyway. Anyway, I still would recommend to anyone to give this a chance especially for the work of the animators and other just as essential crew.",2020-11-17,0,0,watch,False

millenna,10,"this is concrete proof that once the Philippines' film industry starts taking artists and writers seriously (and paying them right!) that good movies like this are possible. as a Filipino, i've only been blown away by a few local animations in my whole existence and that's because most of it are either poorly created or have stories that lack depth. this is not the creators' faults though, because there is little to none moral and financial support from production companies enough to bring out the full potential of local filmmakers. major props to the creators behind the scenes whose efforts have been visibly seen throughout the film. obviously, the animation for this is the movie's strongest suit and the attention to detail whilst incorporating humor is purely amazing! the story on the other hand, is molded from the current Filipino culture thus there is a familiarity towards it and it appeals to its targeted audience. if you're a foreigner, you won't be able to understand all the inside jokes but you'll be able to comprehend enough of what the country and the people are like, even if it's portrayed as an anthropomorphic society.",2020-12-04T17:03:36.470Z,2,0,watch,False

gem37,,"You have no idea the effort I put in to actually watch this, and I can't really recommend it to anybody else - an animated film with spot-on Cartoon Network aesthetics, relentless sex jokes, and a setting (Metro Manila) where I spent a lot of my formative years. Clearly, this work was calling me.So let me make this plain: this film's sexual and gender politics are - put charitably - regressive. The humor is largely juvenile, with not a single innuendo left unsaid. And the story is propelled by thoroughly unlikable characters.But... I was ultimately entertained. A large part of that was just pure nostalgia for the Phillipines, getting to see all signifiers I remembered (The Supermall! Jeepnies!) and several I forgot (the wire mesh displays for drinks, holy shit!) The animation and design are lovely, but are helped by some truly genius visual comedy and meme references. And for as selfish as our protagonists are, I thought their motives made sense. The story may go full soap opera, but at least it's never boring.From what I've seen on Letterboxd, most of the reviews compliment the film's look but criticize it for perpetuating tropes of clasism and misogyny that are apparently well-represented in Filipino media. For all the time I spent living there, I never really watched much that was locally made, and am only vaguely familiar with the craziness that has been going on with the current government.As a piece of satire, I thought this worked.

After reading a lot of the reviews calling the film misogynystic, i had to reassess my own reading, and although i understand where people are coming from, i disagree. Nimfa was a strong woman in touch with her femininity and her own sexuality, she has ambitions and the choices she made was for herself. Although that radio DJ was really spouting chauvinistic things, i thought it was established by the movie that the radio program was misogynystic. (As a person who had to endure THAT radio program during my cab rides, i agree with that sentiment.) Besides, she was awarded her own agency at the end.

mithras_,8,"Getting back to the r/letterboxd Film Raffle after my 6 month hiatus with this wild recommendation from Antoine! I also get to add one more country to My Cinematic TravelsI actually really liked this and even if I hadn’t I would still appreciate how the film raffle gave me the chance to see it. I can guarantee I would have never seeked out a Filipino adult animated furry film on my own.... The animation is fantastic. I absolutely loved the style, effects and great attention to detail and really appreciate the effort that must have gone into making it. This is even more impressive considering it’s from a country that isn’t known for its animated works or even live-action film industry really. I enjoyed the humour a lot, both the dark comedy and the immature dirty jokes. Comedy is universal, but I’m sure it would have been funnier to people who speak the language and can relate to the culture. Or they could have hated it much more judging by all the very low ratings on Letterboxd. They seem to be judging this for the presence of some questionable names in the cast/crew and for being misogynist and encouraging toxic behaviour. I obviously can’t speak for the former, but to me this very much seemed like a satire poking fun at toxic masculinity rather than trying to encourage it. It also seemed to have some surface level commentary on class and how love is sometimes a luxury only the rich can afford. I didn’t feel like it had something whether the actions of Nimfa, Roger and Inago were justified nor did they seem to want the audience to make up their mind. This is obviously much less concerned with sending a message than with making a funny piece of entertainment, and I was certainly very entertained. The ending was the only part I didn’t enjoy and it seemed totally inconsistent with the rest. I don’t have much more to say other than warn everyone about Netflix’s evil furry agenda. Furries are degenerates that must be combatted at all costs (/s... I think) and yet Netflix continues to promote the likes of this and shows like Beastars... and they even have the audacity to be pretty good. It’s interesting how the language spoken is a mixture of English and Tagalog which does happen in certain segments of Egyptian society but not to this extent. Is this how the average person from the Philippines speaks or is it another level of satire?",2021-01-25,4,0,watch,True

themilliemania,6,"It's a Filipino animated film, I think one of the first feature length animated film from the Philippines? And my god is this film sexually charged. Like, I knew going in that it was a soap opera-esque love triangle type thing that very much took advantage of appealing to adults, but man I didn't expect it to go like it did. The pacing is alllllllll over the place, and a lot of tensions in the film don't get resolved. Despite that though? It's actually kind of nice. I dunno if I'd watch it again, but overall, I'm glad I watched it. Nimfa, the main character, is a bit unlikable at times -- she's unfaithful as hell and has some priorities a bit mixed, and can be somewhat hypocritical at times -- but the entire cast is flawed in some form. It's very grounded in that sense, and she's not above growing. Her two love interests are similar. Roger, he's rough around the edges, but overall is a nice dude... albeit with a temper, and real poor money management skills. Iñigo is the other -- a tried and true stereotypical businessman type, slinging deals and reveling in his riches. Overall a nice dude, though very much enjoys all the whims his life offers. If you don't like soapy drama or heavily sexually charged energy (my god), it wouldn't be for you, but it is BEAUTIFULLY animated. The style is distinct and very nice to look at, and it has gorgeous fight scenes, of all things.

abrealad,4,"This movie stinks. First off, the animation is goddamn gorgeous. It’s really good and it’s something I honestly didn’t expect going into this movie. It’s clear to me that everyone in the animation department for this movie just let loose and went bananas with charm and colors that pop. It creatively welcomes the audience and allows them to find delight in a world where people are, in essence, human-animal hybrids without them reeling back and thinking “wtf are these human-animal hybrids”I didn’t think about this until the very end of the movie, but secondly, the voice acting was also surprisingly decent in my opinion. Something I also did not expect. The dialogue felt organic because of that, and because the lines were never dry nor dull. Unfortunately, that’s everything good about this movie. I see this film as another dished-out entry in the Filipino film industry, as nothing sets it apart from other films of said industry (apart from the animation). It doesn’t bring anything new to the table plot-wise, since everything that’s been done here feels like, no wait, IS something that’s been done by so many other goddamn movies (albeit in a lighter tone) I can’t even begin to count. I just think this: if we strip this movie of the obviously gorgeous animation, if we take out the witty/funny lines, the voice acting, the editing, if we just leave the plot all on its own, will it still be able to stand all by itself? To me, the answer is a big fat no. It isn’t a very good story in my opinion, and as I’ve said, this is in essence a movie with themes and elements that are in many other Filipino movies, executed and presented almost exactly the same way most of the time. You don’t have to look or try very hard to find hit-or-miss jokes, cheesy lines, and bad writing along with classism, misogyny, and adultery among other things as themes in other Filipino films/series. Also there are times when, weirdly, the movie kind of asks the audience to take a certain scene or moment seriously, but then it wusses out and overshadows said moments with *funny action scene!*, stopping anyone from caring about our protagonist’s worries, doubts, and hurt. It could not commit to a pause just a while to let us feel and instead convinces itself that *funny action scene!* is necessary to maintain attention. Now if you find this movie enjoyable, if you were able to whole-heartedly enjoy it the whole time, all the way, I would not diss or condemn you for it. If anything, I actually envy that you were able to get something out of the time you spent with this movie. I just find it odd how some people who did enjoy this movie go out of their way and say “Oh yeah? Well, you just didn’t get it! It’s actually satire dummy and well, what did you expect? Disney? Pixar???” to people who disliked the movie. When….okay let’s talk about this for a bit. Firstly, in my opinion, if it was really satire then it still didn’t do a very good job. At no point did the movie mock the themes and elements it was said to make fun of, nor did it make a point that it was indeed satirical, subtle or otherwise, like a satire would do. It was just doing it’s own thing without…….satire. If that’s the case, then it’s just a regular Filipino screenplay with a “satire” sticker slapped onto it. Secondly, I find it weird when people say “What did you expect? Disney? Pixar???” as if it’s okay to stay in a box contented, conforming to the usual formula without experimenting, venturing out or aspiring to have as strong an emotional connection and impact with the audience as Disney/Pixar movies. This is not to say it SHOULD BE Disney/Pixar. I’m just saying any piece of art isn’t worth much if it isn’t the best it could be, if it never went the distance, if it never evolves and adapts. That’s my two cents. Great animation, lackluster story. My stars go to the animators and the few jokes and moments that actually made me laugh.",2021-06-12,0,0,watch,False

thatshelf,,"There are a couple of things one needs to know prior to delving into a satire like Hayop Ka! The Nimfa Dimaano Story. First: the film is inspired by popular Filipino telenovelas. These beloved soap operas usually feature characters who scream “Hayop Ka!,” which translate to “You Animal!” or “You Son of a B****”, in the height of conflict.The fact that the central figures in director Avid Liongoren’s cheeky animated comedy are, in fact, animals should tell you what type of film you are watching.The second thing to note is that shock jock radio hosts have increasingly become surrogate therapists for those who lack the funds to get professional advice. This is a double-edged sword though as the hosts usually turn the caller’s personal hardships into humiliating spectacles for ratings. While this unfair trial by public opinion appears in the later sections of the film, Hayop Ka! The Nimfa Dimaano Story keeps its feet firmly in the soapy waters of melodrama throughout.Read Courtney Small's full review: thatshelf.com/fantasia-2021-hayop-ka-the-nimfa-dimaano-story/",2021-08-08,1,0,watch,False

A hilarious soap opera parody, the film doesn’t aim for the low-hanging fruit in poking fun at one of the lowest art forms there is. But the real success of the film is the way in which it creates a genuine emotional connection to these characters. Even though it’s obviously melodramatic (on purpose), the genuine heart in the film is absolutely charming and unexpected.MORE FANTASIA THOUGHTS HERE",2021-09-01,3,0,watch,False

stitchcastle,7,"Beautifully animated and hilariously raunchy. It’s charming in its own way but its morals are very eschewed, which is I guess a good reflection of the society it’s borne out of. (I’m filipino and raised there, so I know what I’m talking about) It’s always toeing the line between misogyny and feminism which is just a really odd thing to behold. It would’ve been awesome if the movie had something real to say about women in modern day Manila, but coming from the point of view of male writers and directors who are enamored with the idea of this being a pastiche of the old bold-star era of Philippine cinema, it was never gonna go down that route. Which, it is a shame because it had all the ingredients to do so. That being said, it works well as a glimpse into life within modern day Philippines, with its matter-of-fact way of showing social and class divides and the strange double standards on gender that are the result of colonial patriarchy being thrust into an inherently matriarchal society. The humor is also quintessentially filipino with its focus on puns (jokes that are so lost in translation that the subtitles are basically a whole different screenplay).",2021-09-30,2,0,watch,True
