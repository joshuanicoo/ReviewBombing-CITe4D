aremcu,6,"PUSANG INAMOedit: i swear, if this is just a movie na hindi animated, i would have given it half of a star and i'm not even giving two stars below... that's how poor the writing is, but I GET IT it's showcasing the talent of pinoy in animation, di ko siya inexpect coming from this country, the animation was SO CUTEEE yun lang ang masasabi ko. storywise, i know that it is satirical, and i think, if you're one of those people na gusto ng seryosong film with mas seryosong plot, you need to LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS, yung tipong nasa ilalim ka na ng lupa, because this movie is not made for that. the story is about a girl na gustong umangat sa buhay kaya nagmahal ng mayamang lalaki, typical pinoy, umamin man tayong lahat dito o hindi, shows betrayal na friend mo tas pinatos yung ex mo right after nyong mag-break, and all of these things, kahit gaano kaseryoso yung topic, nung nabuntis man siya or kahit ano, joke pa rin siya at nakakatawa pa rin. and maybe that alone, to make me laugh every time na may ibatong sarcasm o joke or scenes na sobrang pambobo, it IS SO GOOD, kaya masasabi kong bagay siyang maging animation movie lang at wag nang ireenact with real people, because this type of movie needs to say na HOYY WAG MONG SESERYOSOHIN HA sa pinakaunang punto palang na makita mo yung poster, pusang ina kasi.the casts??? yung voice nila tangina bagay na bagay sa characters, angelica panganiban HAHAHAHAHAHAH tangina may mga fight scenes pa ang mga hayop.I LIVEEEE FOR PINOY ANIMATIONS LIKE AFTER WATCHING ITI MAPUKPUKAW NOW THIS...

themichaelcarlo,6,"I love the art style, the animation, humor, visual gags, and the Filipino-specific easter eggs peppered throughout the film. It’s clear the animators had fun making Hayop Ka!My only problem is the romanticization of cheating in a relationship. Sure, Nimfa, the titular character, received a verbal lashing after confessing her mistake on air (spoofing a famous, self-righteous love guru radio DJ). And she ended up facing the consequences of that mistake alone. But I don’t think punishing the woman should be the lesson here. Anyway, cheating and adultery stories in the context of Filipino pop culture is such a tired idea. I’m sick of it.Hopefully we see more Filipino, adult, animated films.

gerigravity,4,"Hindi ko rin alam kung bakit ko pinanood 'tong Hayop Ka! ni Avid Liongoren, siguro dahil curious ako sa ""unang Pinoy adult animation"" sa Netflix. Pero matapos ang isang oras at labinlimang minuto, isa lang ang masasabi ko: hindi benta ang kalibugan ng mga hayop.Yes, maganda ang animation. Hindi maitatangging pulido, colorful, at may effort ang mga animators. Halatang pinag-isipan nila yung detalye ng ""animal version ng Pilipinas."" Witty yung names ng lugar, makulay ang background, at minsan may mga visual gags na effective. Pero sayang, kasi lahat ng ganda, tinabunan ng isang script na parang binunot sa pinakababa ng basura ng Philippine showbiz.Nakakabwisit yung sobrang sexualization ng mga karakter. Oo, satire daw. Oo, gusto raw magpatawa gamit ang bold jokes. Pero ang kinalabasan, parang hyper-sexualized telenovela na hindi malaman kung seryoso ba siyang commentary sa class divide o gusto lang niyang gawing ""bomba cartoon"" si Nimfa. May mga lewd puns na hindi nakakatawa, may mga eksena na parang lowbrow radio drama, at may ending pa na pinilit gawing redemption arc gamit ang ""nice guy"" trope. Ang suffocating din ng casual misogyny na parang diniktahan kang kamuhian si Nimfa for making choices na, in reality, rooted sa kahirapan niya.Ang daming Pinoy teleserye clichés dito. Mayaman vs. mahirap, kabit-kabit, pangarap makaahon sa hirap, tapos puro moralizing sa dulo. Kung satire nga talaga, bakit parang mas kinampihan pa ang mga luma at problematikong values? Parang instead of poking fun at them, nire-recycle lang nila.Props lang sa animators! Sila lang talaga yung nagdala ng pelikula. Hindi nila kasalanan na yung script ay puno ng infidelity, sexism, at macho bullshit na hindi na dapat sinusubo pa sa audience. Sa totoo lang, mas deserve nilang bigyan ng proyekto na mas meaningful at hindi ganitong caricature ng lahat ng maling bagay sa local entertainment industry.TLDR: Kung gusto mong makita kung ano ang hitsura ng Zootopia kung ginawa siyang panghapon na teleserye na puno ng sabaw na kabitan, eto na 'yon. Pero kung meaningful satire ang hanap mo, huwag ka na mag-aksaya ng oras.",2025-09-18,0,0,watch,False

hannavyr,8,"The first time I watched Hayop Ka!, I honestly just saw it as a bastos movie, parang puro kabastusan lang HAHA. But upon rewatching it, I realized the concept is actually liberating and surprisingly close to reality. Its vibrancy and exaggerated humor felt more like satire—a playful but biting critique of how consumerism shapes the world we live in.Through a realist lens, the film mirrors the everyday struggles of many Filipinos, though wrapped in an animated, comedic package. The stark contrast between the rich and the poor was a constant theme. How privilege dictates not only opportunities but also relationships. Even love in the film is framed by class and material wealth, showing how affection is often entangled with survival and status.From a Marxist perspective, Nimfa’s relationships expose how capitalism and consumerism seep into our most intimate desires. Her dissatisfaction with her current boyfriend and her attraction to a wealthier partner may seem superficial at first, but it reflects how the system conditions people to equate love with upward mobility and financial security. The film satirizes how consumer culture commodifies even emotions and human connection, turning them into transactions rather than purely personal bonds.Looking at it through feminist theory naman, my initial impression of Nimfa as ""malandi"" for wanting more felt unfair. On rewatch, I realized this judgment reflects how women are often shamed for pursuing their desires, especially if those desires break away from traditional expectations. The film suggests that Nimfa’s choices are not purely personal flaws but rather shaped by the larger forces of patriarchy and capitalism, where women are pressured to chase an “ideal” version of love, security, and femininity. It questions why women are criticized for seeking better lives, while men who fail to provide are rarely scrutinized in the same way.In the end, Hayop Ka! may seem chaotic and shallow at first glance, but digging deeper, it becomes a satirical mirror of our society; where class, consumerism, and gender roles intersect to shape even the most personal aspects of life like love and relationships.",2025-09-01,1,0,rewatch,True
fayelune27,6,"Nimfa should’ve gotten an abortion, just sayinSurprisingly enjoyed this silly anthro telenovella. Pacing is pretty off and nobody is truly likeable here, but the animation is wonderful, I quite like how they drew backgrounds and cityscapes. But holy shit we spent the whole movie wanting to end the cycle of poverty, and it ends with her raising her baby as a single mom…? And despite its pretty neutral portrayal of female sexuality in the beginning, she gets shamed for having sex by that weirdo radio jockey, gross. We should be past this “children are a punishment for having sex” type of plotline already. Not surprised that the billionaire boyfriend thing didn’t work out, not just because he’s had a history of cheating but because Nimfa had shitty communication skills and kept pushing away Inigo so…But honestly these half star reviews are a bit harsh. I’d love to see more from this studio and encourage Southeast Asian animation, even if the output isn’t always appealing.",2025-09-07,1,0,watch,True

davidnigelco,6,"I remember all the hype about this back in 2020! Shame it took a course in my fourth/last year of college before I pressed play on this…Anyway, I thought this was effective and authentic. Your way of life and finances really do dictate how you live your life tbh… the resentment towards each other (Nimfa, a saleslady, belittling his janitor boyfriend) is real; you resent each other because you both cannot lift each other up, yet the system is unfortunately devised in a way that keeps you both down. While it very much feels like something so inspired by films from the late 2010s, its themes held up really well. Five years after its release, I’ve never seen class resentment be so pervasive all over. Watching this in 2025 made me realize that wow, this has been a dilemma for ages. Nimfa resorts to participating as a caller in a radio program, whose misogynist host attacks her for her decisions. However, Nimfa’s actions were dictated so by her circumstances; you cannot blame someone for doing what they do if they’re in the margins of society. I really liked how Raffy Tulfo was satirized here. Its ending was a bit too far-fetched, if you watched in 2020. But in a time that is currently very much intent on ‘eating the rich,’ and after Luigi Mangione did what he did, it’s not far-fetched anymore. Maybe this film was ahead of its time tbh… Anyway, I was cracking up over several jokes. I particularly liked the scene where Nimfa’s workmate was revealed to be fucking Nimfa’s boyfriend 😂 just insane throughout.I just didn’t really like the abundance of sexual jokes… it felt incredibly juvenile. If you get off on making animals freaky, then please go all the way, instead of showing them moaning so sexually and then revealing they’re just having a foodgasm. This was hailed as a boundary-pushing film, but all I got was a work that felt too afraid to be unabashedly themselves. You’d get the respect you crave if you own the furry freak in you. Nonetheless though, I think it’s a good critique on the system that pits the poor against each other! It aged well.",2025-09-04,0,0,watch,True

nikarue,3,"Unang una, animation-wise, ang ganda. Ang effort ng mga animator may detail, style, at fluidity. Pero doon na nagkaproblema sa kwento. Sadly, the plot just didn’t hold up. Kahit gaano pa kaganda ang animation, kung paulit-ulit pa rin ang narrative themes, walang bago at walang depth hindi na rin kayang isalba ng visuals even though I'm a sucker for visuals, masarap sa mata kaso ang hirap i-ignore 'yung nilalangaw na plot.I'm not expecting some Pixar story plotline pero it doesn't hurt to criticize kung paano nila in-execute.Usual tropes na naman: cheating, class divide, misogyny, poverty porn, and outdated character stereotypes. Nakakapagod na panoorin kasi parang wala ng bagong sinasabi. Instead of elevating the story with the animation, parang mas lalo lang na-highlight kung gaano kababaw at problematic ‘yung plot. Even the dialogues felt off awkward, minsan cringey, minsan tone-deaf. Imbes na ma-immerse ka sa kwento, nadidistract ka sa kung gaano ka unnatural pakinggan ng mga linya. Sayang. Ang ganda ng animation, pero nasayang sa isang plot na hindi masyadong pinag-isipan or nag-stick sa classic tropes ng Philippine media.

So, it wasn’t entirely bad in that regard.Also, the casting of voice actors.

jyujinplus,8,"I really wish I could figure out just why this is rated so low on Letterboxd. If ever there was a movie I wanted to have a conversation about, this is it, because I fail to see why this really fun, slightly dramatic, but overall interesting slice of life is so universally panned. I think it goes without saying to praise the animation in Hayop-ka - it’s smooth and moves fluidly, it leaves itself open for some really impressive expressions and powerful images in scenes. The backgrounds are picturesque, and create a very vivid feeling of what this version of the Philippines is like: lively, energetic, maybe a little crowded but full of interesting characters. I think it’s worth mentioning, too, how good these backgrounds are at communicating different regions: the scenic beach near the luxury cabin, the quiet village that’s contrasted by its tight knit sense of community, both contrasted against the usual setting of the city. And while I’ve seen in other reviews that people find the innuendos in the background jokes to be tacky or in poor taste, I actually found that not only were a lot of them funny, but I think it creates a tangible sense of a world populated by Anthro animals more than other media tends to. I think sex is a pretty natural human experience, and a lot of real life marketing sells sex very transparently, and lots of mainstream Anthro animation doesn’t address that. It’s outside the ratings for films like Zootopia and Sing, and sexuality is so central a focus of a story like Beastars that normalizing it would kind of destroy its themes. And I think that perhaps Hayop-Ka’s depiction of sexuality in this world is one of its greatest strengths. Which, I guess, is interesting, because it seems like part of the negative backlash to Hayop-Ka is the accusation that is perverse or obscene for its sexual nature. Which seems… weird to me. The sex isn’t explicit in it, and Nimpha is only pictured having sex in the film once. The films setting is steeped in sexuality: sexuality is marketed on every sign on every street, and Nimpha’s motivation is mostly based around sex,But it doesn’t feel that weird I guess? It’s a story about an adult woman making adult choices, and the use of sexuality is only out of place because it’s animation - but there’s a lot of animated stories that are a lot more sexual than this. And like I said, I think the sexuality makes the plot kind of interesting. By the third act, the novelty of animal-sex-world kinda dies off, and the film isn’t really about that, as it becomes a series of Nimpha making increasingly more destructive decisions with basically everyone involved in her life. But by that point in the film, I had already been hooked in, and I was interested in what would happen to Nimpha. The positive sexual expression was a great hook for the first act, and moving into the second and third, I cared enough about the established characters enough to weigh the morality of their decisions in my head. Nimpha does something objectively bad to Roger, but it is understandable that she wants to better herself, and Roger’s tendency towards violence make him seem like a less dependable partner. But Inigo’s a literal villain, and if him talking about partnering with Elon musk didn’t telegraph that enough, he is a character who openly talks about working with the Filipino president to keep wages down. When Nimpha confronts her family in the third act, she’s objectively wrong, but I can’t really be mad at her, because it’s a realistic emotional outburst. I’ve watched a lot of stories about bad people who misuse sexuality in their lives. And I’ll never claim that Hayop-Ka - an animated parody of soap operas meant to poke fun at infidelity - is even half as weighty as Tár or Bojack Horseman - heavy commentary about how celebrity is used to leverage power. But, I do file this movie in a similar place in my head. Watching a not great person try to be better and trying to figure out why things are so messy. And frankly!!! I actually adore the ending for that. Because Nimfa does fuck up, she does do bad things, but people in her life do bad things back to her. And in the end the best thing Nimfa can do is just… walk away. Start a new life. And she does and I think that’s beautiful. I do think it’s worth mentioning the sexist overtones in the climax of the movie - when Nimfa calls the radio station. A reference to an unfortunately very real trend of men berating women for doing anything other than serving whatever man is already present in her life. I feel like part of the negative reception of Hayop Ka is that people read this as him being right but like… no?? He’s just not? Maybe it’s my prior knowledge making me biased against a man in a recording booth telling a woman how to live her life, but in that moment I think it’s Nimfa’s last attempt to rely on men, and her faith in it is shattered when she talks to Inigo again. Because yeah - don’t know if you notice - she can’t even try to follow that bull’s advice, because she never gets a chance to come clean to Inigo if she wanted to. And I think that Nimfa marching for maternity leave and raising her child on her own with her family shows that Nimfa’s life isn’t going to revolve around the approval of men anymore. It’s possible that’s cope: that this is a sexist message I’m jumping through hoops to spin in a way that empowers the protagonist in the end. But I dunno, I kinda constructed that reading without thinking about it. I don’t think it’s that much of a stretch.I’m going to be coming back to Hayop-Ka at some point, for sure. It’s filed in my brain alongside a lot of my favorite depictions of every day life in an animal world. It’s a little melodramatic, but I do think that the depiction of Nimfa, and how her story ends, does tell a good, grounded story. I think I, a bunny, am always going to be happy with a film that I start and whose title very loudly says to me,“You’re an animal”",2025-03-18,2,0,watch,False

Iñigo is your average Elon Musk-loving capitalist asshole and Nimfa is a cheating, manipulative asshole that constantly tries to (and successfully) cheat on her boyfriend. I would've respected her if she just outright tried to do it just to swindle Iñigo's money. The weird thing is, they seem to be aware of all this.

frogheart,5,"Before I start being critical I have to say, this movie being the first that the Philippines didn't outsource for animation and was made in the country is really neat, along with the fact the animation just looks good, It is very good at comedy and changing art styles for effect, I got some good laughs out of it becoming hyper realistic during the sexy time parts, also the character designs are nice, Jerry objectively being my favorite because...well I love frogs and he's stylized really good, a perfect little guy design.Anyways, the plot was uh...well it was okay I guess? I found it to be a bit too melodramatic for my taste, and while I suppose you can say it is because of it being a satire on the way the tropes in Filipino media act, but even then I feel like it missed the ball sometimes. Sometimes it does good, I like the end credits of our main character learning to not be as much of a piece of shit, but something about it urks me, you know? Another person had mentioned how sort of misogynistic this movie is, and how while sometimes it does good in relation to satirizing the concepts shown, sometimes it just uh...doesn't I guess? It sort of goes well, we were satirizing this but now we mean it genuinely I suppose. This isn't me being against characters who are shitty people like the way it is in this movie, I love bad people doing awful things to each other, maybe its the cheating aspect or the over exaggeration but it comes off as more of a smear against women who want more in life. I can't blame our main character to want to be living comfortably, she works a dead end job and wants to be happy, I'm not defending her, by any stretch of the imagination, fuck her, but I feel this aura of sinister intentions. As a whole this movie is beautiful when it comes to animation, but the story is overly dramatic to the point of it being more stupid than anything else, and while the fact it is a satire saves it sometimes, other times it really isn't satirical and just dumb. Go watch it though just for the animation and some of the jokes. Maybe just once if you can't stand stupidity in your movies, but it is worth the watch.",2023-01-07,0,0,watch,False

ngboo,7,"Ralph Bakshi’s cult feature debut ‘Fritz the Cat’ gets a sort of a spiritual successor in romantic satire ‘You Animal!’ – a tongue-in-cheek parody of Pinoy telenovelas in which characters reportedly scream the titular phrase at each other in the heat of an argument. Deliciously saucy and irreverently melodramatic, it revolves around a love triangle between a saleslady or rather, salescat, Nimfa, her macho mongrel boyfriend, Roger, who works as a janitor, and a purebred (husky?) playboy industrialist, Iñigo Villanueva, with whom she fulfills her fantasy of climbing up the social ladder. (Did I mention that the story is actually prophesized by an octopus fortune teller?)The colorfully mesmerizing artwork may look cute, with all protagonists being talking animals, but this is by no means a kids cartoon, given its rampant sex jokes and lines such as “my bun is quite content with your hot dog”, not to mention a highly stylized (read: deliberately kitschy) intercourse scene. However, it is not to be taken too seriously either, which Liongoren and his team of artists constantly emphasize through visual gags such as witty inscriptions hanging all around ‘Zootopia-fied’ Manila, some literal catfight or a rage-fueled scene inspired by the ‘Street Fighter’ car-crashing bonus game.

jamesabelc,7,"So me choice ka to watch this in support of Pinoy animators, or not to watch this because ayaw mo sa mga taong involved. Pinili ko siyang panoorin at eto masasabi ko:🔘 maganda siya sa simula, mga first half kasi bastusan hahaha.🔘 medyo off talaga si Robin Padilla, pero bagay sa kanya yung role hahahaha🔘 simple lang yung story. Susko a little over an hour nga lang sya 🔘pero andito yung mga realidad sa buhay na palagi na lang din naman nagiging subject ng mga movies / teleseryes / indie films : simpleng buhay, breadwinner, kapatid na nabuntis sa halip na nag-aaral (spoiler), yung makatikim ka ng panandaliang ginhawa at handa ka nang talikuran at gawin ang lahat, traffic at kung anu-ano pa. these are all familiar. Ginawa lang siyang animated para siguro ibang atake? Tho enjoy naman.🔘 again, me choice ka kung papanoorin mo o hindi. Tingin ko naman hindi kabawasan sa buhay kung hindi, pero hindi rin naman sayang ang 1 hour in support of Pinoy talent sa Netflix. Yown.",2020-10-31,1,0,watch,False

stitchcastle,7,"Beautifully animated and hilariously raunchy. It’s charming in its own way but its morals are very eschewed, which is I guess a good reflection of the society it’s borne out of. (I’m filipino and raised there, so I know what I’m talking about) It’s always toeing the line between misogyny and feminism which is just a really odd thing to behold. It would’ve been awesome if the movie had something real to say about women in modern day Manila, but coming from the point of view of male writers and directors who are enamored with the idea of this being a pastiche of the old bold-star era of Philippine cinema, it was never gonna go down that route. Which, it is a shame because it had all the ingredients to do so. That being said, it works well as a glimpse into life within modern day Philippines, with its matter-of-fact way of showing social and class divides and the strange double standards on gender that are the result of colonial patriarchy being thrust into an inherently matriarchal society. The humor is also quintessentially filipino with its focus on puns (jokes that are so lost in translation that the subtitles are basically a whole different screenplay).",2021-09-30,2,0,watch,True
