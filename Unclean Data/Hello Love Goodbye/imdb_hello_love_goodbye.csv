karenkeysie,"Oct 24, 2019",An Inspiring Movie,"Hello Love Goodbye, despite being a largely feel-good film, did not shy away from the harsh realities that its OFW audience experiences. Despite being upfront with the struggles of an OFW, it still serves as a gentle, hopeful reminder for our modern day heroes to not forget to choose themselves. To not forget that they can allow themselves to dream, to love, and most of all, to be human. It show that love can wait but our dreams it knock once like opportunity grab it once it came in your or our life.

Kathryn Bernardo portrays Joy's exhaustion, anger and resolution so potently without much words. It all comes out in the way her lids look heavy from a two-hour sleep; how her shoulders slump as she grapples with the thought of her agonizingly routine life. We see it in her quiet moments in the night when she can catch a few minutes just to stare blankly at the wall. The depiction felt authentic and tugs at your heartstrings, Joy is the symbol of women with dream. And also her leading man this is a more mature role for Alden as well, and the material lets him show a deeper side to his acting chops. His character's personal story carried as much weight as the romance, and in Ethan's vulnerable moments, we see Alden as a dramatic actor, and not just a tutti-frutti leading man. That's not to say that he didn't play the charismatic boyfriend role well, though. The kilig factor we as always cranked up to high, thanks also to his and Kathryn's organic chemistry.

The most unforgettable scene in this movie when Ethan and Joy decided to leave each other to continue their dream and when Ethan said ""will you give the rest of your time with me in Hong Kong? "". Those line make me sad and overwhelmed because even they know that they leave each other they choose to understand and make those little time to make memorable, they choose to spent those time to be happy. This movie make us inspired that life is like a photography, we developed from negative.",8
spasek,"Apr 13, 2021",Love is About Letting Go...Not Sacrifice,"I've seen a few of Kathryn Bernardo's films, and I believe she turned in the performance of her life. She stepped away from the typical romantic-comedies (many of which are actually quite good), and challenged herself to take on the role of a much deeper and much more complex character in Joy.

I have always marveled--and not in a good way--of how people tend to use others; even people they love; even members of their own families. Of course, children are usually guilted into it. In short, it's a parent's way of saying, ""I suffered, and so now you must suffer too. Why? Because it's how families work.""

As stated in other reviews, I am an ESL teacher. I've lived and worked in South Korea, China, and Taiwan. I know quite a bit about how Asian parents tend to treat their kids. Of course, it's not all bad. You'll scarcely find parents who are more dedicated to teaching their children about discipline and hard-work. The large contrast between them and western parents, is that western parents tend to allow their kids to do whatever they want. They're spoiled beyond belief. What is needed is a balance.

As the eldest daughter, Joy is in Hong Kong working several jobs in order to keep herself alive as well as sending money back home to her family in the Phillippines. She has a nursing degree. Her dream is to go to Canada to pursue what she loves. Of course, she meets and falls in love with Ethan, a young man who is also from the Phillippines, who is trying to support his family as well, after a disastrous relationship that nearly cost him everything.

Ethan, of course, is hoping that Joy will decide to stay in Hong Kong, and not go to Canada. This is when the film really grabs the viewer to see what Joy will decide to do.

Love is not about sacrifice for someone else. Sacrifice is about losing something, and love is never about loss. It's always about who you are. In all her wisdom, Joy has to explain this to Ethan as well as outlining the consequences of not pursuing her dream. Fortunately, Ethan finally gets it and is able to do what only love can do: let go. As soon as you try to hold onto it, love ceases to be love.

Filmed in Hong Kong, we're giving a stark and not-so-pleasing depiction of life for many immigrants struggling to survive. Some can do it. Some can't. In the end, you can only truly look after yourself and not lose sight of your own dreams. Of course, the world, and even your own family will throw every reason at you to NOT pursue your dreams. If you give in, you have no one to blame but yourself. If you forge ahead, then you have gained more profound wisdom about life than what most people can only dream about.

My only complaint of the film was that the chemistry between Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards was not what it should have been. And because of this, the film loses a bit of its heart and depth. I'd say it was pretty obvious that Kathryn Bernardo did not want to do any kissing scenes with Alden due to her love and respect for her boyfriend, Daniel Padilla. The only kiss we see is one on her forehead in the dark. Can you imagine the lack of depth in a film like Titanic if Jack and Rose only held hands and never shared a kiss? I couldn't help but wonder how much more powerful the film would have been if another actress had performed in the role, or if Padilla himself hadn't turned the role down (which I read that he had).

Still, this is a memorable film that challenges everyone to go after their dreams and let nothing and no one stand in your way.",7
paul_m_haakonsen,"Jan 21, 2021",What a nice surprise of a movie...,"Right, well I didn't really know what I was getting into here when I sat down to watch the 2019 Tagalog movie that was filmed in Hong Kong. Initially I thought it was a Chinese movie, but upon seeing the names of the cast, I looked on IMDb and saw that it was a Tagalog (Philippines) movie and not a Cantonese (Hong Kong) movie. And given my fascination with Asian movie, of course I sat down to watch ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"".

And I must definitely say that writers Carmi Raymundo, Cathy Garcia-Molina and Ronalisa A. Co came up with a rather enthralling storyline; one that definitely provided as much of entertainment and enjoyment, as it was a movie that was very watchable and likeable.

The storyline is one that easily sways away the audience, because it is wholehearted and nicely told storyline. And milling about in the storyline are some nicely detailed and interesting characters. So a big thumbs up to the writers on this accomplishment.

I will say that the acting in the movie was good. Now, I am not overly familiar with Tagalog cinema, but my wife told me that there were some rather famous Tagalog actresses and actors in the movie. Nevertheless, I think the acting performances were spot on.

At the same time, with providing a good story and good entertainment, ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" really brought me back to my four years of living and working in Hong Kong. This movie stoked so many memories and definitely spurred a desire to return to Hong Kong to revisit that fabulous place.

If you like romantic movies, then I strongly believe that the 2019 movie ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" from director Cathy Garcia-Molina is a movie that you will thoroughly enjoy. I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie, and it is a movie that I can warmly recommend you sit down to watch.

My rating of ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",7
richarddillomes,"Mar 22, 2020","Hello, Love, no Goodbyes.","Being the highest-grossing Philippine movie thus far, I hope you don't mind if I came into watching this with high expectations. Still I was skeptic because the assumption was it will be another one of those formulaic Star Cinema movie starring Kathryn Bernardo, directed by Cathy Molina-Garcia, set in an international location, usual love story but with a twist: we get a new boy this time in the form of Alden Richards. For the most part I was right, it was all you could ever expect from the same group that gave us the highest-grossing movie the year before, 'How's of Us.' Amidst it's shortcomings, 'Hello, Love, Goodbye' is a pleasant surprise for a movie who's theme has been done a million times. Part of it's success can be attributed to showing us the reality of our hardworking domestic helpers in Hong Kong (which the OFW community all over the world related and responded to) and it did not give us the usual ending we are used to, which makes a sequel possible seeing as all three already expressed interest in doing.

The story was well-written for the most part and my favorite was the start of the movie. It was a different approach, fast-paced and intriguing. While at some point it had to slow down to become what it really was meant to be in the first place, a typical Pinoy love story, at least it introduced something new to the audience that can be the new norm in the future. Acting-wise, Kathryn and Alden both delivered but both lacked maturity which I'm hoping can be improved on once the sequel rolls around. There were exchanges that fell flat because either a) it was poorly-written or b) both did not have the capacity to deliver them with the emotions needed. It took a while for their chemistry to kick in, possibly a result of being pigeonholed in their respective love teams for a long time. Kathryn can act, but she has certain mannerisms when she deliver some of her lines that breaks my concentration from her acting. I'm still getting rich girl even though she's supposed to be covered in filth from hiding under a pile of garbage bags. Alden still comes from the John Lloyd Cruz school for acting, but as soon as he develops his own signature he should be destined for greater things. The supporting cast did what was required of them, with Maxine Medina and Jameson Blake as highlights.

There's always the burden of asking whether this is the movie that will propel Philippine cinema back to it's old glory. Obviously this is not it, but delightfully it's not a step back as well. Knowing this specific tandem and formula works, hopefully everyone involved will be more keen on wanting to elevate the viewing experience the second time around. I keep harping on this because I honestly believe it has the potential to become even more special than what they've already done here.",7
alvintalavera,"Jul 31, 2019",Truly amazing,"This is so far, the best Filipino movie of 2019. I really love the story, which shows a lot about the lives of Filipino workers in Hong Kong. It is not like any other of those Filipino rom-com, and drama movies you've seen before. This will make you laugh out loud a lot and cry hard.

For me this is Cathy Garcia-Molina's best movie. Kathryn and Alden really shines in this, great acting by the whole cast. It also has great shots, cinematography and soundtrack so it is a must watch!",10
Sirfaro11,"Oct 30, 2020",Mature and bold love story,"The two stars from the two different stations hit it off with good chemistry in this mature love story. Although the story is as typical as any Filipino love/romance movie could be, I like the fact that the writer and director went for the bold path of ending the movie with ""goodbye"", instead of coming up with an epilogue that let the two lovers meet again in some future. The two lead stars are engaging enough for you to care what happens to them in the end but there are some parts where it could drag. Still, I can understand the clamor when this movie came out in 2019.",6
kingsjreal,"Oct 23, 2019",THE BEST FILIPINO MOVIE EVER,This is the best pinoy movie ever. The characters are superb. Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards performance was the best. There is no boring moments in the movie. It's a must watch for everyone. Kathryn Bernardo played the role of Joy a Filipino worker in Hong Kong who is struggling and doing odd jobs to take care of her family. On the other hand Alden Richards played the role of Ethan a funny and unserious bartender who later crossed path with Joy and the story of their undying love begins. The story is not just another pinoy love story. It's a story that shows the struggle of all OFW . I was touched and move by the acting of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards. They made it possible for me to relate with the movie. I'm not a Filipino but I was able to get every piece of the movie because of their wonderful onscreen chemistry. Kudos to the cast and crew. Good job Director Molina. I wouldn't mind to travel again for the part 2 of this movie. It's worth my time and my money. More movies for this duos please. I would always travel with my family to watch their movie onscreen. More movies for Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards please. They've won my heart.,10
Honest_Reviewer32,"Aug 10, 2019",WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!,"I was excited to watch the film due to the hype and some of my friends posting about it on social media however, I was very disappointed after watching the film as the acting from the lead actors including supporting cast appeared quite scripted and very awkward. Kathryn & Alden seemed too rehearsed and some of their co-actors were really annoying. The story was predictable and recycled from previous films. Only thing I appreciate was the cinematography and soundtrack. Save your money and just watch this on netflix or cinema one when it airs.",No Rating

50fiftillidideeBrain,"May 1, 2024",✒ Time Must Start Again 🕰 °7.7° °VG ° 💯%🔍,"🕰Timing in life is everything; so the adage goes. In Hong Kong, time is G💰LD. As long as you move you'll live. Once you stop you'll starve. Over 200,000 Filipinos work in Hong Kong. It's most common to have a 2-yr domestic helper contract as Filipinos are not allowed to do anything else - unless they manage to become a citizen. Therefore, when Joy loses her job because her employers can no longer pay her, she takes an illegal waitressing job. The cops, inevitably, will come by to check IDs. When Joy sees them, she busts a move and runs. She ends up running right into the handsome bartender and 😙busts another move. She uses him as camouflage to hide from the po-po. Cops rarely bother a couple snogging in the alleyway, afterall. It's done so often in movies you might think that they would start checking, even if a duo is rounding first and headed for second, but it always seems to work.

The Filipino community in Hong Kong is small. Everyone is within 1° of separation, but it's large enough to support a Filipino radio station. (They have a nifty microeconomic system in place as well.) Joy thinks she got away scott-free only to wake up the next morning to a radio announcement about her! Ethan, the bartender, is looking for Joy so that she can return the kiss that she stole from him! Joy's friends go insane.

HLG is about what decent, but poor, people must do to survive: It is all about hard choices. It is also about the nature of love. Joy & Ethan. Ethan + Joy. She resists him, but she can't for long. The problem is that she's leaving. She's definitely leaving. She has a nursing degree that she can't use in Hong Kong. She's going to be a nurse in Canada. That's her dream, and n🅾thing's going to change her mind. N🅾t a thing/budkis/pist🅾🅾za/larkaflark/nuffink/jack squat/NATTY. Joy is no wimp. She has a will of iron. She warns Ethan to not get attached. Yet they allow themselves to fall in love. Every day they push the knife in a little deeper.

Their story is sweet and these protags are likable. He says he can handle it and he won't get in her way, but as that 🕰 approaches the pressure ratchets up. Because, 'when you love, it's all or nothing. If you hold back, then why love it all?' Ethan has a point. 'There are questions inside of me that only I can answer,' Joy insists. Joy has goals, a mission, and an ironclad agenda. She will not be swayed. Not now.

L💘VE. What does it look like? To Ethan it's: ""If you loved me enough you would stay."" ♻ To Joy it's: ""If you loved me enough you would want me to go."" Later, Joy asks the universe: ""When a woman gives too much of herself, she's stupid, but when she prioritizes herself, she's bad. Where do we need to place ourselves? Is love only expressed through sacrifice?"" Why so often, indeed, does every option, for women especially, seem irreconcilable? Love can teeter from selfish to selfless. Perhaps love always starts down in the selfish zone, but the more we sincerely love someone, the more selfless we should become. Leaving the shallow end and diving down deeper should elevate our love higher. If not, we must question how much in 💓 we are or how selfish we actually are. A young person should never be expected to throw away h/h future for a relationship, particularly a relatively new one. Talk about creating a debt for regret - No sane person would endorse that. Joy agonizes over this unexpected timeout from the race she's been running. Either option is valid. Her choice is hers alone. HLG tells young girls that their personal development and future is every bit as important as love.

Befitting a modest budget, most of the filming is on the street or in contained spaces. There's a couple of wow shots. They take a day off to go up into the mountains. On a cliff looking down on the city, the buildings are uniformly white. While they look like bad dental work there's also an ethereal beauty to the vista. The effect is otherworldly.

HLG is a 118 minute, 2019 release that is rated 8.2 on MDL. Overall, this is a well put together production. The writing, directing and acting all blend to make a great product with few flaws. This is a 🇵🇭Filipino production and I am looking forward to seeing more of their works. I've seen 2 🇭🇰Hong Kong productions, The Defected-8.2 and Hong Kong West Side Stories(7.5). Both of them are good but also dark, edgy, sad, and a display of the worst elements of humanity. The group that is the most downtrodden in Hong Kong seems to have a brighter outlook. Between the 3 productions, one wouldn't think it's the same place. HLG is well worth the time to get a peek at life in Hong Kong from the view of the hard working, overlooked Filipino community. We🇺🇲 have alot to be thankful for.

It's a great start for hollywood-esque films 😁👍 It even has lessons like remember to care for your family and how to love someone purely.

wilfredlucas,"Aug 18, 2019","Alden Richards' character, Ethan, is pushy, creepy and problematic.","Ethan will continue sending friend requests even if Joy declined several times already. He will make the radio station talk about Joy in public without her permission. He will use another phone to text Joy anonymously. He will act like a police even if Joy is weeping out of fear. He will squeeze through inside a small room knowing that Joy will be uncomfortable. He will continually send ""Need a friend today?"" text messages even if Joy has rejected it so many times. I don't know how a Filipino girl reacts to such moves, but if people consider this as ""nakakakilig,"" there's a problem.

'Hello, Love, Goodbye' is at its best when it tells the story of Kathryn Bernardo's character, Joy. In some ways, the film manages to outdo similar mainstream Filipino romance films because of Kathryn Bernardo's stunning performance and the earnest depiction of OFWs. Bernardo, whose acting holds the film together when it was falling apart, effectively evokes a palpable sense of weariness, discontent, and eagerness to alleviate Joy's situation. Actually, I can do without the 'La La Land' love story if the social commentary was strengthened and expounded more. In a similar vein with 'Sunday Beauty Queen,' the film resonates with Filipinos because of its sensible portrayal of what it is like to work abroad in a job you are overqualified in.

But Cathy Garcia-Molina's picture falls apart as the annoying, melodramatic score continues to play in the background, tackier drone shots are added, and more forced, ""hugot"" dialogues are delivered by the leads. Sure, this is how cliché-ridden mainstream Filipino romance plays out. But how I wish we get movies that transcend this generic romantic stratagem. 'Hello, Love, Goodbye' fails to offer something new to romance movies as an art form, which is disappointing since the OFW story and Joy's arc have so much potential.",3

gulagulabla,"Aug 24, 2019",The Story Has Potential - The Film Failed to Deliver,"As far as the film's story goes, it has so much potential. It depicts a few of the many instances of what OFWs experience while working abroad. But the way Cathy Garcia-Molina presented the story was too mediocre.

Their choice to cast Alden and Kathryn was bad. There isn't any chemistry between them. The chemistry happened between the viewers and Alden/Kathryn, but not between the characters themselves.

Alden's character was unrefined. His acting was subpar. His smile is problematic. Instead of conveying something that relates to being hurt or having a struggle, it becomes out of place and sometimes creepy.

The camera shots were out of place. It felt like the production team were trying to show off their drone shots even when it would have been better to just use a simple wide shot. Close-ups were not utilized properly.

The script contained the typical ""hugot"" lines. At the same time, the film contained at least 30 minutes of pure exposition. It became a film of telling rather than showing.

I haven't talked about the problems with the other casts. But overall, the film was purely a waste of time. I would have felt better if I just watched the film ""Anak"" with the other OFWs in one of the film's scenes.",1
dazzylila,"Oct 27, 2019",Unexpectedly Real!,"Oh they went deeeeeppp.

This is a realistic movie where you'll see the life of a Filipino OFW in Hongkong- the sacrifices and dreams for the family. But love will always come at the least expected time. Kathryn Bernardo- never failed me to amaze on her acting skills. She always devote herself into the character and put amazing life onto it. I must say that I'm a fan. Alden Richards on the other hand surprises me on his hotness throughout the whole movie. These two characters made my heart cry and leaving me to re-watch again the movie. That feeling you have when you finish an amazing movie that you don't want it to end. Director Cathy is a genius on her craft. She knows how to perfectly put drama, romance and comedy into a single movie! Everyone must watch this movie!

og-klippz,"Aug 18, 2019",HONEST Review. Why 5?,"Lets start with how great Kathryn's acting is. As expected from her The Hows of Us piece. Alden did OK. Wasn't expecting much but it was a solid performance. However his acting reminds me of John Lloyd. And if you act like someone else's then you should give justice to it or do better. But in this movie it's neither. Then again a solid one. Now, the lines. They are trying to squeeze the ""hugots"" absolutely anywhere they want in the film. And it's absolutely out of timing! The lines are so bad that I can say I can write that. Yeah its that bad. The songs doesnt go well with the scenes which completely ruined the greatness of the song. They could have done it better. Cinematography is so bad, its like you're watching a TV series. Go watch it again, you'll see the same style of focus and switch to subject over and over again. There are many scenes that could've shot with them both in the frame to show their emotions at the same time. It was like Action! And Cut! Next line! The style of shots just changed in about 10-15mins remaining in the film. It looked like they realized it and hired someone else. And my 11 yr old daughter even agreed how bad the shots are. Compare this with Tadhana, 100 na Tula, Kita Kita, The Day After Valentines, Never Not Love You, and #WalangForever. If you havent seen these, go watch them and thank me later. 5 is because of Kathryn.",5
yeheyyeehah,"Sep 13, 2019",Wow!!! Just wow!!!,"In what may be Cathy Garcia Molina's best movie to date, this movie overcomes the banal and stereotypical nuances pinoy romcoms are known for. In fact the apparent filipino diaspora is the true backdrop of this movie. The dissolution of every OFW workers success or possible demise. The ensuing love story merely serves as extravagance but will eventually turn complimentary to the already palatable storyline of Kathryn Bernardo's plight as a struggling domestic helper torn between the choice of staying in Hongkong to be with the man she loves (Alden Richards) and fulfilling her destiny to be a succesful nurse in Canada. Both characters are vibrant and played to a T by the two lead actors. Not really a fan of Alden Richards, one may surmise that he was directed exceptionally well for this or was incidentally a victim of writing mediocrity in previous films. But that stockroom scene is just plain fun and genius. The chemistry between the two characters made apparent by screams of excitement from my neighboring seat as the pair locked eyes for the first time. Forget about the common adequacy pinoy films are usually associated with. We may suck in action and sci-fi movies but we can definitely make quality films in other genres. Like this one. Baduy na kung baduy, but this is a movie you should watch. Again, this is not a paid ad. Lol!",8

ceresscarlet,"Aug 22, 2019","It's not hollywood, but for a pinoy style movie , this is ver good!","After watching the movie, i just have love everything about it : the feeling of missing the characters after the movie ended . Here's my thought: 1. Goodvibes, inside the cinema, it is so nice to hear people having mixed emotions throughout the entire movie, nakakakilig, nakakatawa, nakakaiyak . It's not heavy , just simple. 2. Kathryn's voice is just perfect for her role. She has a straight face but she managed to give expressions that justifies every line she says, thru her eyes. You will love her more in this movie. 3. Alden has an expressive face, can portray a sad eyes and happy smile at the same time. With that expressive face, I was amazed that he made me smile and laugh with those supposedly cheesy lines of the script. I did not expect that he is this good. He actually can shift from happy to sad to serious without you noticing the transition. Plus he is so manly and handsome. Many women inside the cinema were so 'kilig' everytime his face shows up especially upclose. 3. The supporting cast will give you a break to the story of joy and ethan, they are very funny! I meant, just their presence adds excitement. They are the ones who completed the movie. 4. Good choice of names of the lead actors. Joy is a name that is nice to hear from Alden's voice. Ethan could be alden's alternative name in real life, it suits him well . And Mary dale is maymay's real name, very filipino and youthful name for her character. 5. Great chemistry, Ethan's arms looks so comfy everytime he hugs Joy. When they look at each other in the eyes, it's genuine. Alden's bubbly voice and Joy's serious voice are blending nicely that is why just them sitting and talking brings ""kilig"". 5. You can see hongkong itself, even in just a glimpse you can see the unity of filipinos. Being an ofw is hard but having to see a community of filipino around you brings comfort and home. 6. Some parts are like music videos, maybe because the music is so good to hear in those hongkong buildings in the background. 7. Direk cathy is really exeptional. She will bring out the best in all actors. She choses the best on everything. 7. The movie itself tells different stories in just 2 hours. All stories are true to life, but hopeful . All stories are aspiring to have a better life and chasing happiness. In order to chase happiness, you should make sacrifices, but making sacrifices is not sad at all . It is a challenge and part if the process. The whole movie is not korean or hollywood, but filipino. Like any other movies, it is not perfect. There is always room for improvement. But that improvement, we should make movies more like filipino style. It is very simple actually but filipinos are loving it because it is very light, its for family bonding. You wont feel awkward watching it with your grandparents. I gave it 10 over 10 because i cant get over it.",10
shalalahappy,"Oct 30, 2019",It's an ok film,"Story - It's Good but there is some strained scene just to make the story long/extend.

Actor - Ethan (Alden Richards) He's acting skills is Amendable there's some blunt moments in his facial acts.

Actress - Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) no doubt a great actress.

Cinematography - great Beautifulyl shot.",1

shng-77912,"Aug 17, 2019",Very worth it!,"A story about everything that's happening in real life. From sacrifices, responsibilities, self-love and relationships.

Not a fan of Tagalog movies, watched this upon recommendations from friends. Truly worth every penny. Great Job Kathryn and Alden. 👏",10
hernander,"Feb 9, 2021",Great movie,"One of my fav movie, I love the cast, the plot, I love everything.",10
suicidesydd,"Apr 28, 2021",Had that Before sunrise vibe,"Watched this the other night on netflix, after being in my list for a while. And boy it was good, it starts a bit chaotic but once you're in ,then you're in.

All characters where good, and the chemistry between. Joy and Ethan was very convincing. It is a romantic movie of course, but with a message.

Like i said in my title, it had - for me- that Before Sunrise feel. And since that's my favorite movie of all time, that's a compliment..",9
arveeframirez,"Aug 27, 2019",10/10 for a Filipino film,This is one of the best filipino films i have watched.,10
marlonllorendaro,"Dec 15, 2021",Worth watching pinoy movie,The movie depicts the reality of life being OFW's their struggles dramas and obstacles make the love chemistry of the couple--protagonists worth fighting for each other. Its theme is deep and so heart-touching.,10
