Na para bang hindi na option ang migrasyon kundi isang daan na kailangan mong gawin para umangat sa buhay. All throughout the film, walang balak bumalik si Joy sa Pilipinas. Wala siyang balak maghirap nang sobra. Enter Ethan. Ang heartbreaking lang nung fact na he had to experience the same experience twice. Buti na lang he was matured enough the second time.Putek graduate ako ng college, anong ginagawa ko naglilinis ng inidoro?Dito ako umiyak eh HAHAHAHA. Joy is full of dreams. Mataas ang pangarap niya pero willing siya mag settle sa kung anong pwede niyang magawa. Ang sakit lang na kahit maraming propesiyonal sa Pilipinas, mas marami pa ring pipiling mangibang bansa kahit hindi akma sa kursong tinapos at sana'y pina practice nila. Joy and Ethan finding solace with each other feels natural. Na para bang they meant to find each other. Overall, the film is really good.

6767676767676,,"Ang pelikulang Hello, Love, Goodbye ay isang nakakaantig na kwento tungkol sa pag-ibig at mga sakripisyong ginawa para sa mga pangarap. Ang paggamit ng Filipino sa mga emosyonal na eksena ay kapansin-pansin sa pelikulang ito, na nagbigay ng mas malalim na koneksyon sa mga manonood. Ang mga linya ay natural at totoo, kaya ang mga emosyon ng mga karakter ay higit na nadarama. Gayunpaman, may ilang bahagi kung saan ang mga diyalogo ay may halong Ingles, na bagama't nagbibigay ng makabagong tono, ay nakakabawas sa lalim ng mensahe sa wikang Filipino. Sa aking palagay, maganda pa rin ang paggamit ng Filipino sa pelikulang ito dahil ito ay nagpapakita ng ating wika na nagpapahayag ng tunay na damdamin at karanasan. Para lalo pang pagbutihin, makabubuting bigyang pansin ang paggamit ng mas malalim at mas masining na mga salita sa Filipino upang mas maipakita ang yaman at kagandahan ng ating sariling wika.",2025-11-06,0,0,rewatch,False

faevor8s,7,"i really love how they’ve shown the lives of the ofws — their sacrifices, silent battles, and the longing that comes with being miles away from home. one of the main reasons why i chose this as the film subject for my discourse analysis in grade 11.but above all, they’ve shown us a story about choosing yourself — and all that you have to go through to do that. and joy was such a great protagonist for this because how can you love someone so much, and still have to let them go to choose yourself? some might take it as a selfish decision, when in reality, it is not. all her life, she had to put others first before herself, giving up and sacrificing things for people. but when the time came that she finally decided to choose herself, she wasn’t being selfish — she was finally being free. i admire her so much for having the courage to leave, to allow herself to grow and dream.and ethan? sometimes, love alone can never be enough. it’s a hard pill to swallow, but it’s the truth — the reality that not all the love in the world can save us. joy was never lacking in reminding him that she’s going to leave. she never made false promises, never painted a forever she couldn’t give. from the beginning, she was clear that she’s not open to commitments, clear that she’s leaving. it was he who pushed himself into her life, even when she kept on pushing him away. i know that ethan just hoped — it’s not a bad thing — but sometimes, hope blinds us from the truth we already know, making her choose between the dream she’s been working hard for and the love she never expected to find.so yup, joy, tama ka sa sinabi mong, “kung mahal mo ’ko, bakit pinapapili mo ako?” dahil ang pag-ibig ay dapat na mapagpalaya, hindi isang pakikibaka. at kailan man ay hindi magiging masama ang piliin ang sarili.at sana, makahanap tayong lahat ng taong hindi tayo papipiliin tulad ni ethan :)",2025-10-29,0,0,rewatch,False

irynadel,8,"Not the most life altering piece of cinema but definitely the most modern Filipino movie that I'm proud of so far.RIP to kathniel but also not because Kathryn Bernardo (and these other actors) deserve to have their spotlight and be taken srsly as actors instead of being forced into a loveteam from an early age. Still loved their movies together but this was definitely a huge risk in the Filipino entertainment industry and I’m glad they delivered. Obviously still has its fair share of red flag romanticism for the leading man but as ALWAYSSSSSS the Filipina baddie carries. But just knowing how the usual Filipino rom coms go, this was already breaking tradition, while still managing to deliver the kilig factors. I LOVE that the ending is up to interpretation, and Kathryn still pursues her career as a nurse. VERY bold choices against the usual Filipino movie plot lines. It’s a good love story, the chemistry is there, and also love how it mixes in the harsh realities of working abroad and the hard-working Filipino spirit. THEY WERE IN HONG KONG THOUGH,, so the shots could have been way prettier cinematically. 😩But props to the director and the casting, Kathryn Bernardo always has my heart and I can’t wait to see her in more movies. Alden is alright too ❤️ ** I’m just pretending the sequel doesn’t exist. **",2025-09-08,1,0,watch,True

Buti na lang hindi siya nastuck sa love team niya with Daniel. Mas lumabas yung galing niya sa pagacting and sa pagportray niya sa character. Super natural lang nung acting niya. Ang galing din ni Alden. Pumantay talaga siya sa acting ni Kathryn. Slow paced siya pero hindi yung nakakaboring kasi nabuibuild up yung emotion hanggang climax.Super daming iconic lines. Iba talaga si Direk Cathy. Maganda kasi nahighlight yung hardship ng isang OFW. Pinakita rin kung gaano kalakas and katapang ang isang babae. Nagustuhan ko siya kasi hindi siya yung typical romance movie na happily ever after. Super realistic lang nung ending especially for a person na mas uunahin ang pamilya kaysa sa sariling kaligayahan.

Ethan is a mixed bag for me where there are parts that are so endearing you can't help but smile at his line delivery and his love for Joy, and at the same time, I wish that Joy would ignore him or just call the police on him for calling her everyday.

k3nr1c,7,"I appreciate this movie for showing a glimpse into the life of an OFW working as a domestic helper, and for highlighting the reality that many of them hold degrees that could qualify them for opportunities far beyond the jobs and salaries they’re stuck with. Kathryn nailed her role—her character felt real and easy to sympathize with. Alden, on the other hand, was weird and unlikeable. Ethan wanted Joy to stay because, for the first time since his breakup with Tanya, he felt like he had purpose again—something he found in helping Joy—and he didn’t want to let that go.",2025-06-20,0,0,rewatch,True

moregeekthanyou,7,"Joy, a hardworking domestic helper, and Ethan, a charming bartender, fall in love while working overseas in Hong Kong. It's a fairly grounded love story that reminds us that sometimes love means letting go. Kathryn Bernardo, as Joy, carried the film for me as she is forced to choose between love and following her dreams, capturing the quiet resilience of countless Filipinos abroad. We also get to see the emotional toll, economic pressures, and social sacrifices OFWs face living in constant hustle while enduring discrimination, homesickness, and uncertain legal standing. A reminder that behind many OFWs are stories of struggle, strength, and dreams deferred.",2025-06-14,1,0,watch,False

"" Hindi lang ako nag aagree 100%. 100 gazillion times more.2. I intentionally didn't watch this as early as I should have because of Cinemalaya pero the few days I missed made me appreciate the wait. 5 out of 5 stars.3. Malamang marami naka relate na working professionals when Kathryn Bernardo's character Joy said that choices are just for the rich. Umoo ako e. Pati yung mag jowa sa tabi ko. Pati yung yuppies sa likod ko. Totoo naman diba? Kahit anong profession mo makakarelate ka talaga. Kahit mahirap, babangon ka at magtratrabaho. Pero may choice ka din naman na magbago o mag stay. Kung ano ba ang priority mo.4. Kudos sa scriptwriter for involving that famous scene of Anak. Kasi kailangan siya. Kasi epitome yun ng Hongkong stories of our OFWs.5. Think of all the superlative words you can to describe outstanding. Yun lahat ang masasabi sa acting chops nila Kathryn Bernardo at Alden Richards dito. Yung alam mong hindi naman sila aa totoong buhay pero akala mo they are an item in real life.6. Sasamahan ko na lagi ng ice tea kapag kakain ako ng noodles. Saka oo. Pasasaan ba't makakahanap din ako ng taong kasabay kong kumain ng mabilis dahil busy ako at marami pa kaming gagawin.7. This film will make you respect our OFWs more. Kung ano ang sinasakripisyo nila. Kung ano ang kaya nilang ibigay. Kung bakit kailangan nila yung gawin. Iba ibang istorya. Pero sumesentro lang lahat sa pag ibig.8. Iba din talaga tayong mga Pilipino pagdating sa pamilya. Yung ikakain mo na lang ibibigay mo pa sa kanila. Kasi iba ang saya kapag nakita mo silang masaya.9. Two people make a relationship work. Hindi lang isang tao. Kasi nakakapagod yun. Dalawa dapat.10. Hindi ako kuntento sa one film lang for KathDen. This pair deserves one more movie. Or maybe two.

notagreenflag,8,"A heartfelt exploration of love, sacrifice, and personal growth set against the backdrop of Hong Kong’s bustling cityscape. The chemistry between Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards is undeniable, their performances grounding the emotional core of the film. The story of Joy, an OFW navigating her dreams and a complicated relationship, is both compelling and heartbreaking. It’s a reflection of the sacrifices many Filipinos make for a better future.However, while the romance is touching, the pacing feels a bit uneven at times, and some plot points seem predictable. The portrayal of the struggles of an OFW could have been explored deeper, as some aspects feel overly simplified for a broader audience.Nonetheless, the film leaves you with a powerful message: ""That sometimes, you have to let go of love in order to truly find yourself and your own happiness."" It’s a bittersweet journey of realizing that love is not always about holding on, but knowing when to let go and move forward. A solid effort with a lot of emotional resonance, even if it occasionally falls into predictable tropes.",2025-02-17,0,0,watch,False

thanksamovie,6,"Joy, a live-in migrant-cum-domestic helper in Hong Kong, prepares to leave for Canada to pursue her dreams when she unexpectedly meets Ethan, and the two fall in love. However, their relationship comes at the risk of their personal goals and aspirations.While it's probably my third watch, this time with an objective, So here are thoughts: I felt some scenes were mixed with the usual pushy theatrics, overly focused shots, and an excessive number of romantic background songs unnecessarily shoved into the film, occasionally straying from authenticity and realism. Overall, the film manages to maintain authenticity for more than three-fourths of its runtime.Hello, Love, Goodbye offers something for everyone—heartbreaking romance, politically tinged drama, and uniquely scenic locations in Hong Kong, encapsulating both the classic three-night, four-day tourist spots and the lesser-known areas. It effectively captures the realism of Hong Kong’s live-in migrant workers, highlighting their struggles with abuse, poor working conditions, the fight for PR, Sunday gatherings of domestic workers, and the depiction of a city that never sleeps.Bernardo and Richards ignite the screen with natural chemistry, speaking volumes through lingering glances and long silences. Every shared moment crackles with quiet intensity, letting emotions simmer and adding profound depth to their connection, with moments of joyful humor in between. The film is lively and, at times, playfully silly, thanks to its ensemble of supporting characters, which helps create a feel-good vibe for the audience.I personally appreciated the character development approach taken by Cathy Garcia-Sampana; the first ten minutes serve as a synopsis of Joy’s character, unfolding family issues—from the rift between Joy’s mother and father to Ethan’s desire to keep his family together. All in all, the film’s emphasis on character building, assisted by sincere backstories and strong performances from the leads, enhances its authenticity. Additionally, the film’s setting—Hong Kong’s hazy skyline, busy crowd, and colorful, grid-like residential blocks—paints a compelling backdrop for a story that leaves audiences hoping for a sequel.",2025-02-15,0,0,rewatch,True

jamiejcerrero,7,"My Brutally Honest Review of Hello, Love, Goodbye (2019)Directed By: Cathy Garcia-Sampana Score: 76/100 Potato Verdict: An interesting character study of domestic helpers in Hong Kong, and addition to the OFW romance storiesPROS:1. Both Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards carried the film. Kadalasang problems for romance films is meron isa nasasapawan yung isa. Thankfully, they are both treated as seperate characters and people. Hindi yung nakadepende yung isa sa buong film. Iba talaga if non-loveteam film. 2. Alden Richards never disappoints. In fact, he’s perfectly casted as someone charming and funny but kayang makipagsabayan sa drama sa family. One of his finest performances yet kay no wonder he’s one of the best actors of his generation. Kaya I hope more quality films para mas mapakita yung acting. I’m a fan. 3. As a fan ni Kath, I can say that this film will go down as one of Kathryn Bernardo’s best and memorable performances. She’s better in roles na may maturity than the usual rom-com roles. Magaling si Kath magportray ng strong independent female character kasi mas ramdam mo siya and yung authenticity ng characters niya sa mata pa lang. I can really say na Kath is one of the greatest actresses ng generation niya. Sana lang bigyan siya ng mas challenging roles and better scripts. 4. Commendable for a mainstream film to portrayal of OFWs na nagiging TNT din. Naging strength ng film na di ginawang backdrop lang yung pagiging OFW for the sake of a love story. 3. Ang lakas ng chemistry ng #Kathden. Im not a fan of love stories pero nakakakilig sila and at the same time you want to root for them.4. It doesn’t have a forced happy ending because being an OFW means sacrifices. Buti wala na yung hahabulin sa airport then magiging pabebe then kiss with friends na kinikilig. 5. Balances romance and comedy. Pero hindi nakakalimutan na mature yung depiction sa OFWs. 6. Nagwork yung Star cinema cliche na magkaroon ng maraming friends like Kakai and other people kasi justified na meron sense of community yung mga kababayan nating OFW sa Hongkong. Natural for our OFWs to survive. 7. It showed the realities of underemployed OFWs like Maymay who graduated Education pero di makaapply ng job sa HK and ended up as a DH. 8. It also includes yung labor exploitation and taking advantage ng mga kababayan natin physically and emotionally. There’s a part where sinabi kay Joy na “I own half of you”. That’s heartbreaking pero yun yung reality na naririnig ng OFWs. 9. Ang cute ng character ni Mrs. Chung. She’s a natural. 10. Sobrang heartbreaking ng short encounter ni Jerome Ponce and Kathryn about their lives. Ang ganda ng execution and comparison ng lives nila. Dito lumabas yung acting ni Kath. 11. Hongkong as a brilliant metaphor of Alden and Kath’s love story. Unlike Barcelona: A Love Untold, mas justified yung location hindi kagaya ng ibang films na basta nasa ibang bansa. At the same time like Joy, stepping stone ang Hongkong for Canada. 12. Ang galing ni Joross Gamboa. Bentang benta sa akin yung mga lines niya lagi. 13. Maricel Laxa had a short but great portrayal. Great actress sana mas napansin siya ng iba kasi ang galing niya ramdam mo talaga yung struggle ng OFW sa kanya and being an OFW not because may choice pero because it is a need.14. Ang ganda ng cinematography and shots ng film. 15. Kahit nasa hongkong sila, maganda din yung may pa-Pageant knowing how Filipinos are so passionate sa pageantry. It also effectively shows yung comedic side ng characters natin. At least, may temporary escape and they can show sino sila despite yung laban nila sa life. CONS: 1. Very Predictable storyline and character problems. It doesn’t offer anything new sa plight ng OFWs. 2. Masyadong stereotypical yung lead characters. Just like any leading man, toxic and possesive si Ethan. I like how the actor portrayed the character even if overused na yung puro red flag ang male lead (The Hows of Us, Rewind, One More Chance, My Ex, and whys), pero ang creepy ng pagkakasulat kay Ethan sa simula. The stalking? Ang cringe di siya nakakakilig even if his character redeemed himself. Then si Kath she deserved more than umiyak and halos lahat na lang gusto niya maayos na problem. Di siya realistic. They deserved better characters. 3. This film begs the question sa dynamics of the new trend of OFW. Dati kasi yung Nora and Vilma OFWs, parents ang OFW. Now naman may Maymay and Kathryn how did it end up na children are now sacrificing their dreams and even love life. Although mentioned naman sa situation kay Maricel Laxa, but at least di ba sa generation nina Kath? 4. Masyadong forced yung ibang hugot and cheesy lines na malayo sa objective ng film to be realistic.5. Why do Filipino films really don’t invest sa soundtracks???? Umay ako sa Ikaw at Ako playing sa mga specific moments. Nagmumukhang music video. 6. I wish nagpakita sila na nurse si Kath na nagstruggle naghanap ng trabaho sa Hongkong when she arrived. Yung innocent version niya na akala niya basta graduate ng nursing. It would’ve been transformational to see her growth na that kind of promise is not true. That’s the fantasy na after we graduate may job ka na. Ang ganda sana may dialogues about Brain Drain ng nurses natin and grab foreign opportunities dahil sa mababang salary sa PH. Yung scene ni Maymay na nakarating sa Hongkong sana lay Kath yun. 7. Also Joy entering Canada doesn’t seem like a realistic solution we can all root for. Yes it has benefits but…… nasaan yung representation ng Pinay nurses who go to Canada who take exams and assessments. In real life, they still experience a much more complex and competitive process pa.8. There were illogical and avoidable moments in the film (running kahit sinabihan na stop, yung away sa bar) 9. May characters na halatang siksik lang and unnecessary na makasama sila. Maxine Medina and Jameson Blake.",2025-02-15,0,0,watch,False

Maybe they've adapted this deep and hurtful ""hugot"" lines because that's what catches viewer's attention when watching trailers and that's what is used for memes on social media. Alden Richards proved to people that he does know how to act. He has this charm that can make you swoon but it was not enough for me to feel a spark between him and Kathryn Bernardo.Kathryn just keeps getting better and better. Her acting on this film is way more mature than those of her other films. It's sad that her performance and Alden's was not on the same level. You can really feel that gap during the climax when they were throwing overly dramatic lines with each other.Cinematography is good especially during the first part and the climax. I love how the pallette switches from vivid & strong colors in the drama's ""hardworking"" scenes to dark, warm colors for its personal and intimate parts. Not that crazy about the scoring though. Filled with long dialogues,and clichés, Hello Love, Goodbye still did not capture the drama of being an OFW in Hongkong. It tried, and it did on the first half but ultimately it failed because that part was later merely used as a tool to make a different setting for a love story. Being a romantic movie, the film was not something worth remembering. Even though the hard to get scenes and perseverance to woo the woman are there, it remains on the box of a typical romance flick which we have already seen a number of times. It sure adapted a different ending from our most typical Pinoy movie hits back then but the execution of presenting the reason behind it was not that powerful as well.",2019-01-10,0,0,watch,False

But as much as i hate ethans character, im giving this a big rating because of kathryn bernardo and her character. I love everything about joys character and how it's so different from other movie plots where a girl changes herself for a guy. Kathryn Bernardo honestly killed this entire movie ( both of their performance are awesome ) i just don't like the way they presented ethan and how they're tryna make us believe that he's some "" golden retriever lover boy "" when he was lowkey manipulative. Overall, i think this movie is shot perfectly, and even tho ethan is meh i think all characters has played an important role on this movie n that's why i love it very much.

thepatricisreal,9,"Hello, Love, Goodbye comes across as the Philippines’ La La Land but grounded in its culture and story. A romance drama that shows the bitter reality of people trying to chase their dreams in tough situations. Actors Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards are sensational and display immaculate chemistry. The realistic story about love/dreams, will touch your heart and soul. As someone who is half Filipino, it was eye opening experience to witness the hardships of my culture. Hello, Love, Goodbye is a great romance drama filled with hard truths and reality. But with added beauty and pain to create a wonderful film. So I saw the sequel to this film Hello, Love, Again currently in theaters first. It was my introduction to Philippines cinema. Once I was informed on twitter that there’s a first film, I decided to check it out. The plot of Hello, Love, Goodbye is pretty clear cut. Set in Hong Kong, a Filipina domestic helper working hard to make the move to Canada meets a Filipino bartender trying to help his family. Even with the truth and circumstances laid out these two are drawn to each other. Leading to a honest portrayal of love, with all the highs and lows that come attached with it. It was refreshing to see a story feature characters who don’t have everything together and are also struggling. Made things feel more genuine and authentic to me. Especially prominent in the brief little joys, no pun intended and adventures they partake in to escape their reality This film did a good job of hitting you hard in the feels. Some might not like how it ended but I did. If you are a dreamer like myself, it made perfect sense. Only gripe is the humor, majority of it, isn’t my cup of tea. I really have to commend actor Kathryn Bernardo for giving us such a gripping performance as Joy. Her character goes through so much that she has to endure to maintain focus on her dream. Luckily Kathryn Bernardo really gave her best to convey the various emotions of Joy’s situation brilliantly. She had the best performance in the movie. Her co-star Alden Richards matched her incredible acting and energy with his character Ethan. Unlike Joy, I was conflicted a lot with his character and at times wasn’t a fan of his actions. But we can all relate to Ethan because love makes you do strange things. However Alden Richards adds a lot of charm and sincerity to Ethan. Hello, Love, Goodbye is an excellent romance drama from the Philippines. Even though it’s ingrained fully into its culture, it can be easily enjoyed by everyone. For we all have been in similar situations when it comes to relationships, dreams and love. I’ve always maintained that the best romance films aren’t the ones that give you the typical happy ending. This is what makes Hello, Love, Goodbye beautiful. As always, go watch this for yourself!",2024-11-25,0,0,watch,True

As they each live in their respective cities, time and the COVID-19 pandemic take their toll on their relationship. After going their separate ways, fate has again brought them together under different circumstances and as evolved individuals.This is an excellent romantic movie with a good balance of comedy and drama. The story is simple, but the combination of immigration, a global pandemic, and a pinch of cultural humor makes it unique. The story shares how love grows and changes and how individuals must grow and change to survive and thrive. With a runtime of two hours and two minutes, some parts are unnecessary and slow the overall development of the story. This is a great movie to stream for a unique international romance.",2024-11-24,0,0,watch,False

But it's also the story of OFWs, of people trying to make it in a country outside their own, as people fighting not only for survival but also trying to hold on to their dreams, to make them come true.

abcdefghijkelle,9,ang pagkakaalam ko napanood ko na siya before pero pinanood ko ulit siya last friday bc we r planning to watch hla and mind you i also cried bc of d film. (as a iyakin girly) you will see the kasi the struggles of OFWs na akala ng mga pamilya nils rito sa Pinas ay masarap ang buhay nila roon at sobrang dami nilang pera pero ang hindi nila alam sobra ang pagtitipid kung minsan nga hindi na kumakain para may maipadala lang sa pamilya nila rito at kung minsan napakarami nilang trabaho at sabay sabay yon kaya wala silang maayos na pahinga. I admire joy kasi may pangarap siya and she's so sure na gusto niya makamit lahat yon and nothing will stop her kahit pa nagkaroon sila ng rs ni ethan. ang selfish lang nung una ni ethan bc she's stopping joy na ipursue yung pagcacanada niya when in fact ayon na lang yung time na uunahin naman ni joy yung pangarap niya bc lagi nalang pamilya niya ang priority niya. although sa last part natanggap din ni ethan and sinuportahan niya rin si joy with her decision. i hope na kapag may ganitong love na dumating sa akin i will not question the love of my partner kung aalis siya para sa pangarap niya but i will just support him instead :)) sana mapanood ko today yung hla hoho,2024-11-15,0,0,watch,False

sebastiandpy,7,"timeless classic, a beloved filipino movie that made its mark on cinema history. Back in 2019, there was so much chaos in the Philippines, station wars, loveteams flopping, and everything in between. Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards had one shot to save it... and they freaking did!Two of the most influential Filipino celebrities teamed up and broke our hearts. Major kudos to them! Rewatching this movie now, especially with the sequel on air, I have to say it’s been the most heartfelt Pinoy film of the decade. It’s so real and authentic, showing how Filipinos have to live overseas just to earn enough for their families. Joy gave up her dreams for others, it’s so unfair but so true to life, but this guy Ethan had some problem with attachment issues lmao, it's such a perfect way to end it without them being together. Alden Richards, THE MAN YOU ARE! Can we talk about his acting? I’ve never seen him act like that before because GMA keeps giving him mid movies (not to be shady, but fr) . No wonder it became a blockbuster hit.""Joy is Here!"" This first movie is pure nostalgia. Cinematic, leveled-up, and with a soundtrack that was soundtracking.

anlureii,7,"if you love me, why cant you choose?if you love me, why are you making me choose?filipino romance movies always felt really corny to me as a filo american, especially with those low quality cheesy montages and lines. but i always had a soft spot for them, especially due to how skilled filipinos are when it comes to implementing the perfect amount of drama and sentiment into their entertainment.this movie was pretty solid to me when considering how i was never into these type of movies. ive watched a good amount of filo romance movies and like i said, i was never a big fan. which is why i was surprised when i found myself appreciating this movie for different aspects and executions.first of all, reminds me a lot of la la land (2016) except filipino OFW version. as much as it hurts, i like to treasure those bittersweet or “tragic” love stories because its realistic. i live for the realism; the hope and joy whilst feeling that agony and yearning, bc i think it really shows u how things really are for a lot of relationships and couples; the reality. how it was never just about love and trust, but understanding. understanding your significant other, and how even when you guys do, the ending isnt always going to be “happy”. i think its a common plot and ive def seen it before!! i just enjoyed this execution and i liked the mature take on it. this movie felt like an entire leap of maturity for both the characters (esp ethan) and shows the growth of their relationship and of them as people. i also loved their chemistry, alden richards and kathryn bernardo as the main couple. i was honestly surprised bc i grew up watching some of kaths films and thought she never had a romance one without that daniel padilla dude. and i am NOT mad that i was wrong bc i rlly liked alden and kathryn together. they delivered the emotional scenes incredibly and i js loved watching them. i also appreciate another bare minimum feature (that kinda ties into what i was just talking about) but multi dimension. like i said, ive seen the plot been done and its nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary. but this movie specifically also had me looking at both sides, both dimensions, and understanding both. i saw how there wasnt a bad guy nor a good guy, how both were multi dimensional and had their reasons. i just loved how it was very clear and how raw certain scenes were.im giving it only 3 n a half stars tho bc i js still found myself cringing like hell everytime alden richards character was being creepy af and IDK theres js this vibe ab filo movies i cant get over. #lovebeingpinoy tho",2024-11-16,0,0,watch,True

Ethan and Joy's motivations were so grounded and solid that it would be disloyal to their characters if they went another way.I like how the film also subverts classic romantic movie tropes by beginning with the first kiss and uttering the ""I don't love you""s.

sinecues,10,"Hello, Love, Goodbye pulls us into the bustling streets of Hong Kong, where we follow Joy, an OFW working as a domestic helper. Through her story, the film powerfully captures the resilience, sacrifice, and quiet heartbreak of Filipinos abroad. Kathryn Bernardo’s performance is raw and compelling, embodying Joy’s exhaustion, determination, and longing. She dreams of migrating to Canada to create a better life.Alden Richards brings surprising depth as Ethan, Joy’s love interest. His character’s introspective warmth and grounded approach complement Bernardo’s emotional intensity, offering moments of hope and connection amidst the harsh reality they face. While Ethan’s backstory could’ve been explored more, Richards’ growth as an actor shines, lending a layered dynamic to their relationship.The supporting cast enriches the film’s emotional impact, with Maymay Entrata, Kakai Bautista, Joross Gamboa, Jeffrey Tan, and Lovely Abella adding warmth, humor, and camaraderie. Cathy Garcia-Molina delivers her best work yet, handling complex themes with sensitivity. Rewatching it, the film’s painful message resonates even more: love alone, often, cannot make us whole.

It’s a typical Filipino romantic comedy drama film, with a great cast and some cheesy but unforgettable lines. They look really good together, even better than Kathryn's last on-screen partner. The story is pretty much relatable, especially if you’re an OFW, because Cathy wrote it really well. She really pushed Kathryn and Alden into a whole new level, too. The only part that didn’t feel right to me was Alden’s character, Ethan.

No unnecessary yelling involved then coming to the conclusion of letting her go for her dreams while still loving each other.

al_vrt,8,"Gave this movie a rewatch before its upcoming sequel Hello, Love, Again (2024). Same feels pa rin, grabe pa rin yung tama nung ""I love you all pero tangina pa'no naman ako!"" ni Kathryn which is nangyayari talaga, kadalasan sa mga breadwinner ng pamilya. Imagine, putting your family as your top priority is a must na kung saan choosing yourself feels like illegal, ang hirap, na kahit sa love ni-restrict ni Joy yung sarili niya, not until she met someone na tinulungan siyang buhatin lahat. Ethan made the things lighter for Joy and he taught her na wag pigilan yung puso niya na magmahal kahit sa sandaling panahon lang. Gano'n nga naman dapat, sabi nga ni Ethan ""kapag nagmahal ka, all or nothing. Kasi if you hold back, ba't nagmahal ka pa?"" at dahil do'n, naranasan ni Joy na piliin ang kung ano'ng gusto ng puso niya. But in terms of loving someone, hindi naman laging s'ya ang kailangan mong piliin.. ""kung mahal mo 'ko, bakit mo 'ko pinapapili?"" -Joy, ""kung mahal mo 'ko, bakit hindi ako ang piliin mo?"" -Ethan.. this lines reflects the fear of Ethan na baka maulit lang yung nakaraan niya and yung suportang kailangan naman ni Joy from her love ones, to take the different path she want, that leads to her dream. Hindi naman palaging nasusukat ang pagmamahal sa kung anong kaya mong isakripisyo, kasi kung sa sakripisyong 'yon, isa lang sa inyo ang mabubuo, para sa'n pa yung sakripisyong 'yon? Kaya tama lang ang naging desisyon ni Joy ""oo mahal kita, pero mas mahal ko ang sarili ko ngayon"" -Joy. Can't wait to see what will happen to them in Hello, Love, Again 2024.

Probably her breakout role and what makes her a more serious actress.Also, had I not known that there will be a sequel, I liked that they made it open-ended; that it’s not your typical Pinoy happy ending. It makes it more raw and close to reality.Some highlights that stuck with me:• “Ang choice, para lang sa may pera.”• “Ang selfish ba para piliin ko naman ang sarili ko ngayon?”• “Mag tatagpo din ang futures natin balang araw.” “Let’s make that happen.”",2024-11-10,2,0,watch,False

I remember not really expecting much from this film, and I was honestly quite surprised by it. It is a fairly solid film that’s well-directed by Cathy Garcia-Sampana. It feels a lot more mature than some romance drama Filipino films, especially in how it tackles some of its themes. It’s also carried by its two main leads, Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards, who have great chemistry with one another. That said, the story is rather formulaic, and the characters are a little generic. But as a whole, this film right here was still a pretty decent watch.",2024-11-09,10,0,watch,False
chzanelle,8,"I usually prefer watching western movies rather than Filipino movies because I sometimes think that the plot of Filipino movies, specifically the latest ones, are too cliche. But this film definitely made me change my mind. It’s a great film. Kathryn is an amazing actress and Alden wasn’t so bad as well. This film really depicts the sad reality that several Filipinos must go through due to financial instability. The director of this film did an amazing job capturing the real-life struggles of our OFWs. Aside from that, Kathryn’s character Joy definitely breaks the typical female protagonist stereotypes in romance films where the girl gives up everything just to be with the love of her life. In this film, Joy taught us that sometimes it’s okay to be selfish for once. Especially when you’ve been nothing but selfless all your life. In life, we have to make decisions no matter how painful it gets. Some decisions are necessary in order for us to have a brighter future to look forward to. I admire her character because it shows how much of a strong-willed person she is. Despite Ethan’s attempt to make Joy stay, she knew that this wasn’t the life that she wanted and that she could do so much more. Leaving wasn’t easy for her but she knew that she had to in order to achieve her dreams. Overall, this film is so worth watching. You know the film is good when Kathryn Bernardo is starring in it :p",2024-11-02,0,0,watch,False

hiiyannie,7,"Without a doubt, the film beautifully captures the realities of OFWs, and Bernardo's performance doubles it. I won't question how they weaved her character. I love how Joy chooses her own joy at the end of the movie. It was something that was empowering for me.Just wish they had a different narrative for Richard's character than the typical archetype of a guy who got traumatized by his past relationship, resulting into his playboy maneuvers in life—only to be changed by the female lead. His backstory was such a missed opportunity to utilize as a guiding wisdom for Joy while she navigates the complexities of her situation. Nabaliw sa pag-ibig, na-disappoint ang pamilya, and is now working to redeem himself. They could have stopped there instead of injecting the part where Richard tried to stop Bernardo from pursuing Canada.It could have been a love story that is self-sufficient yet consistently supportive. But oh well. What do you expect. It's a Cathy Molina film wherein stalking someone is apparently nakakakilig.Overall, I still like the film. The cinematography and the acting were superb.

mattcastaneda,6,"My biggest gripe with the movie is that Joy's decision to move to Canada is unrelated to her familial dilemma. She was going to leave regardless, and the revelation of the truth to her did not make her decision to leave any harder.I think this movie wanted to be a lot of things. It wanted to be an OFW story, a love story, and a Filipino story. The ending was a story trying to find a grip most of the time.OFW stories have the same formula, one person jaded by reality, and another who yearns for something more. It works wonders if done well, and the authenticity of this one really makes for an engaging world. I left the movie knowing that I understood the Filipino subculture that occurs overseas compared to movies like ""Milan"" and ""Barcelona"". But it gets old, and it gets predictable.I would love to see a version of this movie where Joy doesn't have to leave because she's grown attached to the child and the grandmother. And working hard for them is making up for the love she missed out on. The emotional anchor of the movie just didn't work for me because I know there's no question that she'll leave. But it is an OFW story, and the family she serves will have to have some hostile moment to make us feel sympathetic to her cause. And it's getting old fast.Also, the unrelenting stalker-like behavior really does sour Alden's character. And I find it weird that the script is spear-headed by at least 2 women.Will give it props that it didn't take the safe-ending - where Ethan and Joy meet somewhere and they'll both have it all. Their decisions have consequences, and I like that they accepted it in the end.",2024-10-14,0,0,rewatch,False

elentyaa,8,"Hello, Love, Goodbye notes ⁃ Hirap naman may constant text message before the alarm, na pa pavlov si ate Joy mo. Mas una pa hinahanap text ni Ethan sa umaga ⁃ So nice to see Ethan adjusting his pace sa pagkain para masabayan si Joy hahah ⁃ 1 hour in ‘nung naging friends na sila, sinabi ni Joy: “Hindi pa naman huli ang lahat, you CAN be more”. ANDDD OH BOY ETO NAAAA NEED NA MAG BUCKLE UP kasi I think this sets up the conflict. Joy sees the potential in Ethan, but enough ba yung drive, dedication, and will ni Ethan to materialize this potential? LET’S SEEEEHAHAHHAHAHAH very familiar dialogue @ 55:22 remaining timestampJ: So, kailan ulit kita makikitaE: Nami-miss mo na kagad ako? ⁃ Nooooo, gusto ni Ethan mag open ng bar para maipakita kay Joy na di na niya kailangan umalis papunta Canada. MALING MALI!!! Always do it for yourself, not for anyone else. Especially kung para sa pangarap!! Bandang huli, magkakasumbatan pa niyan tamo ⁃ PAKYU SA TATAY NI JOY - ang galing galing mo magsabi na “sabihin ng nanay mo sa mukha ko na di na niya ako mahal” to “kung ayaw ng nanay mo, wala na tayo magagawa” after the truth came out WOW naman. Tangina talaga ng mga tatay. THE AUDACITY *insert PARKOUR meme from the office* ⁃ Tanga Ethan, don’t make it about you please. May pinagdadaanan yung tao. ⁃ TANG INAAAAAAAAAAA MAS SELFISH KA ⁃ OMAYGHAD AYOKO NA TAPUSIN KASI MEDYO PARALLEL TO WHAT HAPPENED TO ME ⁃ I was right!!!! Sumbatan galore sa dulo ⁃ Ethan, ang tawag sayo ay INSECURE ⁃ Buti nagising sa katotohanan ⁃ Good save, ganda ending ⁃ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️In conclusion: I fear tragic romance will consume me more than my slow burn romance fascination",2024-10-09,0,0,watch,True

dizzy_bee,7,"Star Cinema + Cathy Garcia Molina is always a good watch. You can always expext a well produced, well written film that will captivate you from the start up to the end. One of the things I appreciate the most in this movie is how the supporting characters, specifically their friend groups, brought life and entertainment to the movie. While watching, I can't help but think how challenging to produce a Filipino movie abroad. I always notice the crowd looking or recoginizing the actors in the background. It is also noticable how some scenes seems to be forced or unnatural just to advance the plot. It also ironic how a film shot abroad will make you feel that it is really a small world after all, the characters are always on the same places, casually bumping into each other too much. While budget costraints are completely understandable, there is definitely a room for improvement. Overall, this movie did not fall short on giving you a classic romantic Filipino movie experience, giving you the right amount of ""kilig"" while also touching into social and family issues.",2024-09-29,0,0,watch,True

philomenaa,,"I rewatched this recently pero nakalimutan ko lang i-logFilm wise and considering it overall, masasabi kong mahusay ang pagkakabuo ni Direk Cathy, dumudulas siya sa gitna ng 3.5 to a flat 4 stars out of 5 starsSiguro ang mali sa film na ito is more than the film itself but rather ang ating pag-iisip. Napaka-weirdong lalaki ni Ethan sa totoong buhay kung tutuusin. Siya yung lalaking mapilit na hindi kayang tumanggap ng hindi for an answer. Siya yung gaslighter mong boyfriend na lowkey pa-sad boy. Magaling mangmanipula at may paniniwalang siya ang may kakayahang gumawa ng tamang desisyon. Una ko 'tong pinanood grade 9 ako, katorse anyos kami no'n ng mga kaklase ko and majority ng peers namin at the time e kilig na kilig sa mga moments ni Joy at Ethan nung bago maging sila, kahit naman kami, lalo na yung scene nila ro'n sa backroomPero now, in the eyes of someone who has learned and unlearned substantial matters sa ating lipunan at lalo na patungkol sa gender at ang existing system of capitalism and patriarchy e sa totoo lang napaka-uncomfortable panoorin ang character ni ethanFrom the character pipeline on him I mentioned above, nag-progress siya to this man na gustong ikulong si Joy sa bisig niya dahil kaya niya namang ""mag-provide"" at mabigyan ng ""magandang buhay"" si JoyIf Joy wasn't persistent about leaving, she would have been robbed of her identity as a woman, and she would be following the path of a million filipinas, a victim to the hands of a man dahilan sa kakulangan mga kalidad na oportunidad na inilalaan ng ating lipunan sa mga babae. Nakakatuwa na hindi ito ginawang typical love story ni Direk Cathy with the motto na love concurs all type shitTotoo, may pagka-predictable ang flow ng plot pero it doesn't erase the beauty of it anyway. Kailangan natin ng ganitong mga palabas na inilalabas sa masa dahil nagiging impluwensya ang media sa tunay na buhay ng mga tao and vice versa. Kailangang mabura sa isipan ng mga babaeng pilipino ang pagiging martyr at mapagparaya sa mga relasyon. Hindi tayo simpleng alipin ng pag-ibig, at hindi porket nagmamahal tayo nang totoo e isasantabi na natin ang ating mga sarili. Hahaha nagamit ko rin 'to as a reference to one of our discussions sa major subject ko sa kolehiyo dahil maganda ang pagtatalakay nito sa buhay ng ating mga ofw na domestic helper, ang pagkakaisa ng mga pilipino, kung saan e nagagawa nating tahanan ang bawat sulok ng mundo, ahahahah marami pang iba nakalimutan ko na lang xd nasa lec notes ko 'yon hahaha palompalo ako kasi discussion namin and a good reference will hook the students to understand the topic discussed much easily tapos mas mapapalalim mo pa and their interest lingers and boogsh a successful teaching style!",2024-08-03,0,0,watch,True

Also dahil nga may confirmed sequel na ilalabas, it's better to watch it now para fresh padin sa utak lol.While I love the romance in this story, I can't help but applaud Joy's perseverance as an OFW woman and as an eldest daughter. It's not easy being both at the same time. I'm glad she chose herself first, as most women (like her mother) isn't always given the chance. Moreover, I also applaud that the struggles in the movie are what most women (with dreams and aspirations) OFW workers go through. This highlights and raises awareness more about the life of our nanay, ate, lola, tita overseas.Anyways, love the movie ✨",2024-05-19,1,0,rewatch,True

bossch1ef,7,"with the announcement of “hello, love, again”, it’s was time yet again for me to visit this romcom gold mine. and for this second viewing, i have seemed to appreciate it a half-star more. the operatic, dramatized monologues and back-and-forths between joy and ethan have grown in me. i felt their words better than last time, somehow, and though i understand that these types of writing were manufactured to emit such reactions from the audience, i cannot deny the goosebumps-y tingling sensation i felt during such dramatic scenes. the performances i still find amazing, the dramatic scenes punched hard, the romantic scenes were cheesy but sweet, and the funny side characters were wholesome-ly funny. i did say last time that this was problematic, which if looking at it at one side, it is, but i think it was necessary to further enhance the stakes and to give the characters more reason to go or not to go ahead with their decisions. this problematic element is not in any harmful way being glorified, thus its usage increases the dramatic structure of the story and gives justification to the dramatic choices, thus giving layer to the characters and their inner selves. i’ve also come to appreciate some tiny details. the montage-like cutting was very effective in building the world and the budding relationship. maricel laxa played her short appearances amazingly. the final exchange between the leads was greatly implied like their wedding vows. and surprisingly, i didn’t hate the endless “kung ‘di rin lang ikaw” in the background. reading the logline for the sequel, i really hope they don’t fumble it, they have something special here.",2024-05-19,1,0,rewatch,False

joshclaude,7,"You know what? It’s actually pretty good for the most part. I still would’ve preferred a slightly different ending that still retains Joy getting to follow her dreams of moving to Canada, but color me surprised even with the positive reactions, I didn’t hate this. As much as I disliked Alden’s character (and his acting. I’m so sorry), it’s a great decision to actually have him learn rather than have men like him win in the story even if they are actually wrong. Still, I am quite mixed on several aspects of the film. Script-wise, for one, I am aware that this is a romance film but I ended up being more interested in the OFW subplot. I have merely seen the trailer of Sunday Beauty Queen but parts of this instantly reminded me of that film. To bring forward a topic such as that in a mainstream film is a nice change of pace; however, it is instantly forgotten about and left unexplored by the second half. Some may say that the film already needed more time dedicated to the romance plot but I wish it was a little more consequential to tie itself to its OFW subplot. The dialogue is a little too on-the-nose at times as well, which can make some scenes feel a little superficial. Please get rid of full English dialogue between our pure Filipino leads, please, unless absolutely necessary (in which case, it wasn't).In terms of cinematography, I found it to be on and off. There are some good shots with impressive lighting here and there, yet they are never consistent as there are also shots that are too overexposed and poorly lit for my liking. I am aware that the motifs in the score would always be based off of a mainstream song, but having heard Kung 'Di Rin Lang Ikaw even months before this film's initial release (high school tingz), I find it to be a little overplayed at some points. Oh, and louder music doesn't always mean more emotional impact!Still, I guess the film's biggest redeeming point is its direction. Yes, it's a mainstream romance film, but it offers different flavor through its more mature approach. Spotty dialogue aside, the more emotional scenes work well on their own and never feel forced, even if they are a little too on the nose. I did not feel the chemistry of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards at first, but damn it, Kathryn can carry hard. She just knows how to ground her character so well without making it feel superficial. Some people are probably tired of the comedic 'sidekick' best friend(s) of the lead female character but I personally found Kakai Bautista to be hilarious. Not all of her jokes land, but when they do, it's absolutely funny (the Vilma Santos scene probably got the loudest laugh out of me). And holy fuck, I knew that was Jameson Blake playing Peter! Why is he just so good at everything, even in playing an annoying character?Everything said here may have come across as if the negatives outweight the positives but Hello, Love, Goodbye is thankfully saved by Garcia-Sampana's (no longer Garcia-Molina) honest direction and Bernardo's strong acting. Perhaps its approach to showing the OFW life in Hong Kong can be shallow, but it's a good first step to bringing that story tied with its main romance plot into a mainstream Filipino film. Other aspects are quite weak (God, I'm sorry, but I couldn't stand Alden's acting), and perhaps a slightly different ending would have sufficed, yet by the end of it, it didn't feel poorly-made for the sake of profit. By utilizing the appeal of the two leads from their own different loveteams to tell a new romance story, it gets its point across effectively. Once the credits have rolled, I was relieved that I did not hate it, even if it's not quite my thing.P.S. I haven’t heard Ikaw At Ako in so long (high school has officially been very long ago for me) and I had no idea it would play here, nor have I known that I would hear J@$0n M@rv!n’s voice again 2-3 years 💀💀💀P.P.S.
