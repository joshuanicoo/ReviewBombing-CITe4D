lincoln_22,8,"THE COLLAB YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU NEEDEDAs I've experienced a sunday in Hong Kong with my aunts, I can say that they accurately depicted a DH's life. Side characters helped a lot in building the love team's chemistry. They brought life that if they weren't in the movie, it will be boring. Kakai, Maymay, Joross, Jeff, and specially to Lovely. (Pero ang oa lang konti ng ilonggo accent) Alden is unleashed and at his best. Just give Kathryn an Oscar already! Just with her eyes, she can win an acting award. Screenplay is strong and cinematography is great. There's no wonder if this would be a blockbuster hit-- a crowd pleaser. Perfect amount of cheesiness, dilemma and PAIN.

chasingmovies,4,"Watched Hello, Love, Goodbye at SM North EDSA Cinema 6.Its first hour & last 15 minutes tells an interesting, heartening, compelling and high-spirited OFW story fueled with great acting from Kathryn Bernardo. But Director Cathy Garcia Molina defecates those usual Star Cinema formulaic SHIT that stinks the middle part of the storyTOO BAD!The first hour of Hello Love Goodbye sets up an interesting & heartening plot & main character.Kathryn Bernardo portrays an empowering existential libertarian take of a Pinay OFW torn between her JOY dreams & obligation.But Director Cathy Garcia Molina poops many formulaic Star Cinema SHIT ruining the film.Hello Love Goodbye reminds me of Kita KitaHello Love Goodbye could've followed the cinematic style and storytelling structure of Kita Kita to be a great film.Kathryn Bernardo❤️Alden Richards is comparable with Alessandra De Rossi ❤️ Empoy Marquez#Kathden ~= #AlempoyIf only Direk Sigrid Bernardo be the director instead of Cathy Garcia-MolinaHello Love Goodbye could've been a great, well-made and well-treated film.Hello Love Goodbye works only at its first hour and its last 15 minutes of the film.The film lays out an interesting and compelling plot as well as a Kathryn Bernardo main character as Joy that we would all sympathize and root for.The concept of spiritually living in transit in a strange foreign land working hard to make a desired reality happen one day is the film's conceit that really hits hard to all of us. In this modern, demanding and even depriving world we are living in, we are all racing against time to reach our desired goals in life or else we would never achieve it.No time for JOY, no time for LOVE, no time to enjoy our current disposition NOW.This is pretty SMART stuff for a Filipino OFW story.We always watch Filipino films about OFWs where the OFW main character always sacrifices his/her life and personal well-being to fulfill his/her responsibilities to the family he/she left behind in the Philippines.This is a long worn-out story and we had enough of it.Hello Love Goodbye turns the table around.Instead of highlighting the selfless sacrifice of a typical Filipino OFW, the film smartly tackles an examination of a lonely OFW's existence in a foreign land balancing what he/she really likes against what he/she is supposed to do.I believe Hello Love Goodbye opens this paradigm which really hooks my attention and root for the story.Kita Kita almost touches this ingenious examination of OFW but never gets there as Direk Sigrid Bernardo never intends to portray such theme. Direk Cathy Garcia-Molina since ""My Perfect You"", ""The Hows of Us"" and ""Three Words To Forever"" is exploring and digging further her creative mind in coming up with ingeniously joyous Filipino stories while keeping that worn-out and obsolete Star Cinema Filipino family rom-com formula.Hello, Love, Goodbye is Kathryn Bernardo at her BEST so far. Good thing she escapes and breaks off from the tight-bound clutches of her constant leading man, Daniel Padilla. Therefore, Kathryn Bernardo is truly FREE as an actress and as a woman. Without Daniel Padilla at her side, Kathryn Bernardo did not fall down but instead rose higher than what she used to be just as an eye-candy amateur teeny bop damsel of a brute teenage heartthrob debonair.Kathryn Bernardo as Joy in Hello Love Goodbye successfully and convincingly emulates the existential crisis a Filipino OFW has to face as she braves working in transit in a strange foreign land while examining her choices and personal well-being in life. There is a strong libertarian take on Hello Love Goodbye that makes me like the film at first. And Kathryn Bernardo's great acting make that happen loud and bright on the big SM Cinema big screen. Again, this is smart stuff and Kathryn Bernardo as Joy would be one of the most striking Filipino movie characters that I have watched. At least on the film's strong first hour.Alden Richards plays Ethan who is more of a sassy comic relief yet effective MPDG for Kathryn Bernardo as Joy. His character as Ethan started out as a male creep stalking Kathryn Bernardo as Joy in a misogynist distasteful manner that even Senator Risa Hontiveros would never approve of. I guess Direk Cathy Garcia Molina is trying to make a Daniel Padilla out of Alden Richards with Daniel Padilla always bullying or tormenting Kathryn Bernardo for her to love him. Ahem! Direk Cathy. May Safe Spaces Law na tayo thanks to Senator Risa Hontiveros. Any naive sexualized young male Filipino doing a Daniel Padilla or Alden Richards to a Kathryn Bernardo is a crime punishable by fines or at worst, jail time.But I really DO NOT MIND Alden Richards portraying as a sex-crazy playboy luring Kathryn Bernardo into a one-night stand. I believe his flawed character gives merit to the powerful first hour and what Hello Love Goodbye is supposed to be.But I do wonder if Direk Cathy Garcia Molina inject that sex maniac character flaw for the male MPDG to justify that one-night stand motel scene. Seems Direk Cathy and the Filipino masses are really after Kathryn Bernardo shoving her face to Alden Richard's bare muscular chest. OMG! No wonder Daniel Padilla never passionately supports Hello Love Goodbye! 😂 I actually like the unusual pairing of the troubled & serious Kathryn Bernardo with the carefree & hypersexual Alden Richards.This unusual pairing reminds me of Alexandra de Rossi and Empoy Marquez of Kita Kita.The Kathden dynamic in Hello Love Goodbye could have been a more improved, more substantial version of Alempoy in Kita Kita.Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards interacting in Hello Love Goodbye is similar to those sassy Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) teenage romcoms that I get to watch on HBO Red Channel. Only, the Kathden may be something more meaningful than a unusual campy romantic/sexual pairing.Yup! The first half of Hello Love Goodbye really sets us up for a promising story that I am eager to watch.Until the second half came which quickly abandons this great promising story for Direk Cathy Garcia Molina to POOP to us the standard Star Cinema formulaic SHIT that STINKS already!Hello Love Goodbye starts well.The film establishes an interesting, heartfelt OFW story, introduces a charismatic, relatable and empowering female Kathryn Bernardo lead character and builds up an uncanny yet endearing relationship between Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards.Am really expecting the real plot to unravel on the second half.However, I got appalled when Hello Love Goodbye suddenly shifts into your typical standard shitty Star Cinema family romcom formula that is so uncalled for!This really RUINED the movie!Depriving and ROBBING us of a great story to unravel.NABITIN na, NAGOYO pa tayo sa Hello Love Goodbye na ito!From an inspiring, heartfelt and empowering OFW story on the first hour;Hello, Love, Goodbye suddenly drops everything and shifts into a cheesy standard bloated Star Cinema romcom love story with lots of these shit:1. Unnecessary kilig moments, 2. Blatant over exposure of unnecessary supporting charactrers3. Instant falling-in-love that does not feel earned and 4. Speedy resolutions that does not make a big impact to the hearts and minds of the audience.So Cathy Garcia Molina still adopts her standard Star Cinema family romcom formula into the promising Hello Love Goodbye story even when the film does not really need it!Resulting to a big pile of mainstream Star Cinema SHIT taking over the 2nd half of the film.The Star Cinema formulaic SHIT forced upon on the 2nd part of Hello, Love, Goodbye feels like a typical shitty Star Cinema story of its own. Therefore, Hello, Love, Goodbye NEVER continues, NEVER finishes and CUTS SHORT its REAL and promising OFW story that it masterfully sets up at the start.We are DEPRIVED of watching a great story until the end in Hello, Love, Goodbye. The typical Star Cinema family romcom formula that Direk Cathy Garcia Molina is fond to insert is not bad always.This overused family formula does work well for some of the following Cathy Molina's films:1. ""You Changed My Life"" starring Sarah Geronimo and John Lloyd Cruz2. ""My Perfect You"" starring Gerald Anderson and Pia Wurtzbach and 3. ""The Hows of Us"" starring Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla......But NOT ""Hello Love Goodbye""!Instead, this Star Cinema formula injected at the middle part of Hello, Love, Goodbye causes a sudden change of the story, making me feel that I am not watching the continuation of its promising first half.This Star Cinema romcom formula which thrills the Filipino masses, unfortunately causes a big void at the 2nd half of the real promising story of Hello Love Goodbye.Which is TOO BAD and VERY DISAPPOINTING!It is really STUPID for Star Cinema ever since to forcibly insert that singular usual repetitive worn-out family romcom formula on most Star Cinema movies of varying stories.FUCK! SO STUPID INDEED!While this worn-out formula works on some films, it FAILS miserably and RUINS so many Star Cinema films.Including ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" as its latest casualty!The audience never gets to watch the REAL, more heartfelt OFW story of Kathryn Bernardo as Joy and her libertarian existential adventures with Alden Richards as Ethan.Instead, we get to watch another typical Star Cinema formulaic romantic SHIT which should not be part of the real story.Just like any other typical Star Cinema filmsHello Love Goodbye is so BLOATED.1. Maymay Entrata is so underutilized! Although she has a charming potential to have an Pinay HK OFW movie of her own.2. Alden Richards as Ethan's personal existential struggle may not be necessary but should not be emphasized as much as the struggles of Kathryn Bernardo as Joy.3. Alden Richards as Ethan's family should never be one of the main focus of the film.4. Alden and Kathryn's friends should never overstay their welcome to the real story.5. Maxine Medina is a beautiful yet useless distraction to the movie!6. Those kilig scenes are so forced upon Alden Richards and Kathryn Bernardo. The REAL story does not even require for Ethan and Joy to madly fall in love and become sassy sweethearts.7. Finally, the interesting sub-story of Maricel Laxa as Joy's mother who is forced to marry a foreigner to secure a resident's visa is so not explored further. Too bad!These bloated 2nd half of Hello Love Goodbye gives us unnecessary SHIT while DEPRIVING us of the real stakes of the story that really matter.I assume that Cathy Garcia Molina intend to portray the over-glamorized 2nd hour to be Ethan and Joy's existence in the NOW.With this, the film really falters.But Hello, Love, Goodbye redeemed itself on the last 15 minutes of the film.It is actually the real resolution to the existential OFW crisis that both Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards are facing.But it is TOO LATE!A big void is left on the 2nd half of the film which fails to bear fruit the promising OFW story that the film first introduces to us.Hello, Love, Goodbye could have worked if its 2nd hour is a more serious, more composed, yet truly heartfelt & intelligently memorable adventures solely between Kathryn Bernardo as Joy and Alden Richards as Ethan.Both would continue to explore their libertarian existence together either as lovers or bffs. As they continue to work their asses off in Hong Kong, they continue to examine their existence, wants, needs, priorities and obligations.And that is where their prospect about love in the world of constant demands and uncertainties take place.All other supporting characters interact at their minimum as the real Hello Love Goodbye story is soley focused on Alden and Kathryn.This is how the movie should be if it were serious enough to be a great movie.I guess Hello Love Goodbye could've worked if it follows the story and cinematic style of Kita Kita.I do wish Cathy Garcia Molina consulted with Sigrid Bernardo on how to make Hello, Love, Goodbye work.Hello, Love, Goodbye is really a missed opportunity for Star Cinema.Rather than making a great movie which is a worthy follow-up to the great Quezon's Game movie 9/10.Star Cinema chose to inject the usual mainstream formulaic SHIT that really leaves a void on the potentially inspiring OFW story which really shortchanges the audience outright!P.S. As Hello, Love, Goodbye is an exhibition of Kathryn Bernardo at her bestAlden Richards at first plays a convincing & effective uncanny free-spirited character worthy of a companion for Kathryn Bernardo.Too bad Direk Cathy Garcia Molina fails to handle Alden Richards's good talent well in the film as she foolishly swings his character from a free-spirited sex-crazed playboy into a more serious yet passionate romantic.With this, Alden Richards still performs his best in his previous film, ""Imagine You and Me"" as Direk Mike Tuveria really puts Alden's talent to good use to make the ALDUB film work somehow.""The Hows Of Us"" may not be a great film. But its strength is its middle part which Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla exhibits that magical romantic feeling artfully around an old house that is really glamorously teasing our emotions.Some scenes before that mid-scene and the later scenes after are somewhat unnecessary and could be SHIT.But it didn't damage the story for its mid-scene is awesome.""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" is the opposite.The first half and the last 15 minutes of the film are GOLD in the story.However, the middle second half of the film suddenly turns to SHIT which irreversibly DAMAGED the integrity of the entire story and film.Finally, I also complain on how Hello, Love, Goodbye visually depicts the beautiful Hong Kong.The unusually bright lighting on various Hong Kong settings are slightly irritating to the eyes.I can't really determine if Hello, Love, Goodbye has poor cinematography or Direk Cathy Molina intends to have this visual flaw on purpose to support the real theme & message of the film.",2019-07-31,0,0,watch,False

philbertdy,8,"It's the specificity that I enjoyed the most. There have been many movies about the OFW experience, but this one roots itself in the particulars of the Hong Kong domestic helper. They're women who have made the great sacrifice to be separated from their families for the sake of potential economic prosperity. But they labor under a system that seems intent on limiting them. They are given work, certainly, but they aren't free to seek other work. To do so is illegal. Joy is pursuing a dream, seeking a life beyond being the absent breadwinner for a family that doesn't feel her suffering. And because she wants more, she can't just stay within the very limited lines of her existence, risking arrest and deportation just to scrape together enough money to find a means to a better existence. In the margins, we see the internalized tragedy of a people convinced that this is somehow an acceptable situation: veteran domestic helpers constantly telling a neophyte that she'll get used to this life, a phone call back home that's about having to extend a contract another two years. And at the center, we learn about Joy's mother, whose tragic situation exemplifies the commodification of the Filipino woman, and the trauma that it brings.The relationship stuff is less specific. Ethan fits into the playboy made good archetype: a lothario who develops real feelings for a girl because she initially rejects him, and then seems to tirelessly pursue her despite her consistent pleas for him to stop. That's a lot less interesting, even though there are aspects to Ethan's story that are kind of intriguing as well. The film bends its story around the fate of their relationship, and it isn't quite able to make it feel weighty enough to stand up to the larger issues that the characters are facing. It's cute and stuff, but it feels like a distraction from the genuinely incisive examination of the Hong Kong OFW situation.But none of that erases all the good that the film does. Even as the romance takes the fore, the movie is smart enough to make it all feel burdened by the tragedies inherent to a people who have resigned themselves to the reality of a home that can no longer be their home. Also, Kathryn Bernardo is great in this. Joy is a fully formed character: an industrious young woman who has deferred her dreams under the pretense of a necessary selflessness, struggling under the weight of responsibility all while learning sad truths that will come to shatter her conception of the life she's been pursuing. There's a lot going on there, and Bernardo just takes it all in and makes it work. Good stuff.",2019-07-31,185,1,watch,False

dianedayang,8,"This is a film I normally don’t go for. I chickened out of a midnight screening of Midsommar and caught this one instead. (I felt I wasn’t mentally ready for that haha.)But I was surprised because this one wasn’t a walk in the park too—it dropped some heavy emotional bombs. With grace though. I liked it as a whole. Was it cheesy/sometimes overly romantic? Hell yeah. But it was good. Because it was honest. Honest is beautiful. Well-acted, too. I cried lots. And they portrayed the OFW life honorably and respectfully, I think. Never underestimate an OFW’s plight. As an immigrant’s kid, I deeply appreciated how this film didn’t shy away from the messy parts of life away from one’s home country—the ugly parts of choosing to be displaced for some years in hopes of saving enough to build a better life for OTHERS who might not even deserve it. I liked the subtle commentaries. Life is unfair.It also didn’t present perfect characters, which is rare for a Filipino mainstream romance movie. This one had messy people. No hints of self-righteousness. And you can’t help but root for them because of that. I love films that do this. Remind you of the cheesiness and beauty of being human.

ijazzkent,7,"Hello, Love, Goodbye starts with Joy (played by Kathryn Bernardo) saying something like, ¨In Hongkong we don´t waste time because every second counts and every second we are payed¨. The film works best when it follows this premise- when Joy acts as the ´kayod lang ng kayod´ breadwinner of the family and when she desperately searches for ways to support her dream of flying to Canada to seek a job and follow her passion. However, when Ethan (played by Alden Richards) comes into the picture, this premise suddenly shatters, bringing back the movie to its commercial origin.A DIFFERENT CATHY GARCIA-MOLINA FILMThis film is envisioned to be like one of the remarkable classic OFW films in the past like ´Dubai´, and ´Milan´. Fortunately, the film doesn´t settle for that vision alone. It raises the story, nuanced to experiences by domestic helpers based in Hong Kong, where it is illegal to take another job aside from being a DH. It also digs deeper, creating a more compelling and informative story about the overseas Filipino workers in Hong Kong. To this end, the film may be given credit for its thorough research.THE MIDDLE STUMBLESIt could have been great if the film lived up to that premise and made that nuanced Hong Kong experience as it`s core, but instead it uses the romantic narrative as a way to effectively communicate with its audience. It is here, in the halfway of the movie, where it fails to function as a compelling narrative piece. Just when Ethan comes into the picture, familiar Filipino movie production processes and cliches come into play. Take for example the Wattpad-ish treatment of Ethan´s character, the way he is perceived as a playboy and later on revealed that he´s not so bad after all because of previous traumas he had encountered, the cringey mix of English and Tagalog to try to create remarkable lines, inserting some product brands into the movie that never really contributes to the story, using some irrelevant sequences and drone shots that make the film look weird and the quality subpar, and most importantly the redundant score that´s being played using different instruments to create a grandiose melodrama just like every Cathy Garcia-Molina film. Truth be told, there´s really nothing that is compelling in the film´s second part. It all looks like a really long pantomime with ¨Kung ´Di Rin Lang Ikaw¨ as background.THE SLIGHT RESURRECTIONThankfully, all the second part craze undos itself in the film´s last few minutes. Here, the struggles of both Joy and Ethan are discussed and are powerfully put together to give the film a compelling touch, grounded to the themes presented in the film´s opening. The last few minutes of the film however still feels like a long music video. Only this time, it´s disguised as a travelogue. Although, it is in this long sequence where the most delightful shots are shown, it kind of feels just like a long compilation of tourist vlogs rather than an essential part of the story. Another resurrection comes at the film´s last minute. It brilliantly presents the resolution, bringing it to a powerful last shot reminiscent to that of Alfonso Cuaron´s `Roma´, but more explicitly told.THE BEST OF KATHRYNI never thought I would say this, but this is definitely Kathryn´s film. Though this is her most daring and demanding role yet, she perfectly portrays Joy´s desperation, desire, and inherent sadness. This performance is her all-time best and I can, with no doubt say that it is something that should seriously be considered by the country´s award-giving bodies. Alden Richard´s Ethan however feels like a character that was written for Kathryn´s on-screen partner, Daniel Padilla. Despite this, Alden Richards still plays the role with heart. Unlike Kathryn´s role, Ethan is not a dramatically demanding character. This is somehow opposite to Richards´ past roles which never fails to use tears and eye acting as tools for storytelling. In the end, it feels like Alden is only a supporting character in this movie. INCONSISTENTLY GOODSometimes, Hello, Love, Goodbye struggles to cope up with it´s promising premise. At one point it proudly flaunts it´s technical excellence, and the next thing you see, a drone is randomly used to show a scene where the main characters are running on a rooftop. Sometimes it also shines as a narrative piece while the next second, it reeks of shit. This film has a lot of potential, in all honesty. However, it does not consistently makes use of that potential, and most of the time it acts like one of those commercial films in the market- settles for the mediocre, and the audience appeal while sacrificing good storytelling. Despite this, it still should be regarded as a cinematic achievement as it presents a raw aspect of the difficult life abroad despite being a studio-made film.",2019-08-02T13:48:10.817Z,0,0,watch,False

Every bit of its scene mirrors the reality of life and through that, true love is depicted in the story. You may bump into some cheesy and corny lines, but you could quite see how the two leads were able to emulate the vibes of Filipinos. If you're not into romantic type of movies, don't worry.

kiteman,7,"Hello, Love, Goodbye is a film I didn't expect to like. I went to the cinema with a passive indifference to pass the time, yet I was utterly blown away once the opening montage scene started. It reminded me of the claustrophobic isolation and weariness of Chungking Express, which also took place in Hong Kong. I thought to myself that it wasn't a bad start at all and it piqued my interest, hoping it manages to be consistently good throughout. And it did.The portrayal of domestic helpers is realistic. It doesn't go all the way to make it a tragic story, to the point of being depressing, as it manages to be hopeful at times with frequent lighthearted moments. I have a soft spot for stories about OFW struggles. Being a child of an OFW, I've witnessed various injustices prevalent in the OFW community. The movie brings to light several of them, and they hit home.Surprisingly, I didn't find the romance corny at all. Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards both come from different well-established love teams, and I was initially skeptical that a chemistry between them wouldn't work. However, they manage to exceed expectations as they bring the best out of each other. Kathryn portrayed the role of Joy convincingly as a struggling domestic helper trying to make ends meet and realize her dreams. Alden portrayed the role of Ethan as your typical playboy, but he manages to bring out enough nuance to an honestly flawed character escaping the ghosts of his past.The cinematography is decent, providing enough satisfactory camera angles to capture the scenic Hong Kong backdrop. The script is pretty standard for a Cathy Garcia-Molina film but sufficiently witty, sappy, and genuine all at once. The score is average but serviceable. Certain scenes could've had more emotional impact and tension without the dramatic music. The acting of some minor characters needs improvement. Despite that, it's not distracting when you have two lead characters pouring their heart out in their respective roles.To conclude, Hello, Love, Goodbye isn't just a typical straightforward romance film for me. It had enough going on in its story to be engaging while being paced well enough. The chemistry is there, and I must admit that the movie touched me in a way that other of its contemporaries haven't. Ultimately what resonated with me most in this particular film is how it addresses love in the most honest and vulnerable way possible. Every subplot is instrumental and significant to the film's conclusion, making a brutal yet optimistic statement that I rarely see in romance stories in general.",2019-08-02,1,0,watch,False

darkbluebk,8,"My expectations for this were high because of the praise it has been getting, and it does not disappoint. Beyond the romance blossoming between the two leads, this shows the hardships and difficulties of life while living as an OFW (Oversees Filipino Worker) - the limited choices and the sacrifices the characters have to endure. Kathryn Bernardo gives a stellar performance as Joy - and this is possibly her best performance to date. She is clearly supported by her male co-star who reciprocates her performance though Bernardo is the center of the story. My primary issue with Filipino romance films is the direction the romance will take when the leads are faced with a dilemma. Usually it’s the woman who ends up self-sacrificing for love, or the issues of the man are not addressed while giving the couple their happy ending. Sometimes the ending could be a cop-out, instead of letting it naturally play out. This played out perfectly - it was sensible and realistic. There was no gimmick, and the direction their relationship headed addressed the situation the leads were in. This is one for the books.Also kudos to the cinematographer and the writer.",2019-08-03,0,0,watch,True

(May I just note that Joross Gamboa's performance here was so hilarious? Like, as in sobrang benta ng jokes na kahit ano nalang din siguro lumabas sa bibig niya ay nakakatawa rito)Story wise, what I really did like was it didn't romanticize the hardships of our OFWs, it presented the harsh reality of working outside the country. Kathryn really captured it. The film wasn't really the dark, heavy drama-ish film but it made me reflect on the privileges that I have and shouldn't take for granted.

btzneb92,7,"If there's one thing the movie can really boast about, it's the strength of the acting between its two leads. Kathryn Bernardo acted her heart out in this. You can literally feel the sweat, desperation and exhaustion her character endures in her stint as a domestic helper in Hong Kong. At this point, she proved that she can carry a movie all by herself. Alden Richards also proved here that he came a long way from his pabebe Aldub days. His acting definitely improved and was pretty solid overall.Although I did have a problem with how the relationship started in the first half (Alden really was a straight up stalker, wasn't he?), the movie redeemed itself after, not just with how the relationship was ultimately executed, but the execution of the film's central message of how loving yourself over everything else is not necessarily a selfish thing. There's definite chemistry between the two of them, and given how successful the movie is critically and financially speaking, I'm looking forward to their next movie together.Another thing that I really like is that (without getting into spoilers) the movie could had easily ended in a traditional happy ending. They could had easily added a certain scene in the end to do that. But they chose not to, instead delving more into an ending that is whilst bittersweet, much more grounded and admirable. It made the movie had so much more of an impact at the end (and I already really dug the last ten minutes so that was something).Hopefully Star Cinema does keep up this surge of quality and care in its films. I mean, it's not a stunning innovation per se, but it's a noticeable improvement in quality (*coughs* Vice Ganda *coughs*). If there's one thing to be learned from this movie, it's that Filipino audiences do are starting to care on the quality of their local mainstream films, and less on cheap laughs and hollow kilig moments.",2019-08-03,0,0,watch,False

iamppatrickk,7,"HELLO, LOVE, GOODBYE REVIEW Hello, Love, Goodbye is a film about a domestic helper in Hong Kong; her name is Joy (Kathryn Bernardo). In her last four months in Hong Kong, she met a guy named Ethan (Alden Richards) and at first, she is making him go away because she is finding money for the paper works to be submitted to the Canadian Embassy and not a friend or a relationship. But Ethan persevered and Joy falls in love with him. In this film, we can see the conflict in choosing between love or dream, their own conflicts as a character and the hard work and sacrifice of an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker). First of all, why are there many films coming out in the Philippines about adult rom com? I don’t know why but all of them is a box office hit! It is well and good that they showed the harsh reality of the life of an OFW; as a family of an OFW, it is sad for us. They are doing the best that they can, but they are still mistreated by their landlords. As big as forgetting to fetch their children at school to as little as forgetting to take the trash out. There are a lot of stories happening at once, but they resolved everything at the end. These stories are a gateway to show the main characters’ internal conflict not just between them. COMEDY IS ON POINT! Just as expected with Joross Gamboa. Not too many and not too few, just the right amount of spice. Also, there are too many cliché moments, but it worked out well without me cringing. This is one of the Filipino’s illness when it comes to films; they are too afraid of just letting the visual tell the story. Lines are too much; they somewhat gave away the story before the climax. They did not let the audience think instead they laid it all out for us. I hope that they overcome this fear and let the visual tell the story. I’m also glad that they used the original artist’s songs and not just cover it. It sets the mood rather than someone covering it. Lastly, cinematography is meh, okay but I can forgive this one because they shot this entirely in Hong Kong with some parts here in the Philippines. Overall, I give this film a 7/10. Film can be improved by deducting some parts, cut down their lines in half and let the visuals tell the story. Although, acting is on point, I think Star Cinema can squeeze more out of Alden Richards. Cinematography can also be improved by using tripods, stabilizers and a professional drone operator (some aerial shots are jittery). This is your typical “love, dream and family” story but they added the hardships of being an OFW.",2019-08-11,1,0,watch,True

Although it does have some sappy 'romantic' scenes and lines that I felt like sinking to my seat due to undeniable discomfort, this is indeed a romantic movie for everyone and cliches are not cliches if they never work. Anyway, the movie is good. Both actors have great chemistry but then again, I think Kathryn Bernardo could fit well with anyone. Alden Richards has never been more handsome in my eyes. Of course, the funny bestfriends for mere comic relief. Kakai Bautista is hilarious to no surprise.

Some dialogues felt a bit cliché and that acting direction in one scene felt too calculated but the two leads were still great, nonetheless. Kath and Alden played their characters with endearing wit and charm, as their oddities make their interactions raw and believable. What I really like about HLG is that as it goes along it feels riveting on a simplistic scale, it becomes expressive of our own feelings. The theme is on the idea of love (almost didn’t work for me), but the direction pulls in the audience through its characters— I am every bit of Ethan and Joy. I work overseas but I have so much to be thankful for that I am not a breadwinner, no responsibilities aside from myself and I have a job that I wanted for myself. Movies are indeed powerful. This made me more appreciative of the life I have now— it’s good and a privilege, therefore I should not take it for granted. 6/10",2019-08-15,1,0,watch,False

guinamos,8,"It is a feeling of mixed emotions watching the movie. Once again, we are reminded of the diaspora of Filipinos or OFW's to well off countries such as Hongkong and Canada to look for better paying jobs, no matter what these jobs are . It is sad because of the extreme difficulties encountered by the OFW's. At the same time, I feel thankful that there are jobs and income to support the families back home.Joy's work in Hongkong is hard - her pay is reduced, she gets a part-time job and runs from the Hongkong police because of it. In the middle of this, she sends home money to the Philippines and finds a friend, Ethan. Happiness finds its own source and with Joy, it is in the Central Park where all the ""kababayans"" provide comfort to one another in the middle of a foreign country with an alienating culture. It is also in Ethan whom she fell in love with.The movie is well directed and masterfully portrays the lives of domestic helpers. Salute to Cathy Garcia-Molina! The script is tight and romantic which clicks with the Filipino audience: ""when you talk to strangers, there is no judgement"" and "" I love you"" (witty remark to mean stay away).Finally, Kathryn Bernardo acts very well, she is the next Bea Alonzo.

I really don’t know if it’s because I was only very slightly intoxicated, or because I’m a 20 year old gay Filipino in a wonderful relationship with my oh so sweet and loving Brazilian boyfriend, or the chemistry of Alden and Kathryn, or the admittedly cheesy but so emotionally-charged well-weitten dialogue, but this film... this film has made me cry more than any other film I’ve ever seen. More than my ultimate favorites, Lord of the Rings, Cloud Atlas, Spirited Away, Cinema Paradiso, Boy and the World... I literally had to turn away from the screen and bawl on my boyfriend’s shoulder in the cinema when that last conversation in the pier between Ethan and Joy. I really don’t know why this film struck me so hard. Maybe it’s all of the reasons I’ve lifted above. Or maybe this film is also just alright if I revisit it in a while... but wow, I really did not expect this reaction out of me going into this at all.

wilfredlucas,3,"Alden Richards’ character, Ethan, is pushy, creepy and problematic. He will continue sending friend requests even if Joy declined several times already. He will make the radio station talk about Joy in public without her permission. He will use another phone to text Joy anonymously. He will act like a police even if Joy is weeping out of fear. He will squeeze through inside a small room knowing that Joy will be uncomfortable. He will continually send “Need a friend today?” text messages even if Joy has rejected it so many times. I don’t know how a Filipino girl reacts to such moves, but if people consider this as “nakakakilig,” there’s a problem. It almost gave me the same queasy feeling of the stalking problems I saw in Kita Kita and the French film Amélie.Hello, Love, Goodbye is at its best when it tells the story of Kathryn Bernardo’s character, Joy. In some ways, the film manages to outdo similar mainstream Filipino romance films because of Kathryn Bernardo’s stunning performance and the earnest depiction of OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers). Bernardo, whose acting holds the film together when it was falling apart, effectively evokes a palpable sense of weariness, discontent, and eagerness to alleviate Joy’s situation. Actually, I can do without the La La Land love story if the social commentary was strengthened and expounded more. In a similar vein with Sunday Beauty Queen, the film resonates with Filipinos because of its sensible portrayal of what it is like to work abroad in a job you are overqualified in.But Cathy Garcia-Molina’s picture falls apart as the annoying, melodramatic score continues to play in the background, tackier drone shots are added, and more forced, “hugot” dialogues are delivered by the leads. Sure, this is how cliché-ridden mainstream Filipino romance plays out. But how I wish we get movies that transcend this generic romantic stratagem. Hello, Love, Goodbye fails to offer something new to romance movies as an art form, and it is disappointing since the OFW story and Joy’s arc have so much potential.",2019-08-17,310,3,watch,False

It has plot and spiels topped with cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan, cottage, and blue cheese. Pairing Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards is a genius move. This film showcased how good actor each of them is. Of course, we do not forget the supporting cast because they added extra entertainment and drama. The movie never failed to give a sense of claustrophobic feeling of alienation and loneliness in a developed world— the very reason why I think portrayal of Maymay’s character was so realistic.

jouleartemson,8,"MY TWITTER REVIEW:The love story of Hello, Love, Goodbye (2019) couldn’t be more formulaic, although I won’t dismiss its sad factor, but I really couldn’t care less for it after the movie ended. What the movie successfully conveys is the sacrifices people make to have a better life,...to make ends meet, even if it means being away from the people you love. The family aspect of the movie really got me, it’s the subplot that actually made me cry. The plight of OFW’s in this film was executed very well—sensitively, with a lot of heart.It made a good depiction of how families want to be together but can’t, the pain and consequences of being away from them, dreams that have to be put on hold and the resilience of OFWs. I loved the movie because of that aspect. Again, as to the love story, not so much.MY FACEBOOK REVIEW:I have to admit that the love story of Hello, Love, Goodbye (2019) didn’t charm my socks off. It couldn’t be more formulaic and to be quite honest, it bored me. (Please don’t attack me 🥺)What I loved about it though, and where the film actually succeeds, is its depiction of the life of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW). It was executed very well—grounded, sensitive, full of heart. It showed how resilient Filipinos are and how we find humor in everything. That in any way that we can, we always find/create families when we’re away from our own.The film conveys how sacrifice can be selfless and also selfish. Selfless in the aspect of going away from your loved ones and braving a new world alone to make ends meet and eventually have a better quality of life. Also, that sacrifice can also be selfish, but not the bad kind (? I hope you get it), when it comes to choosing yourself, choosing your dreams instead of always trying to make the people around you happy.The values of this film resonates, especially in every OFW family, how families always try their best to be together albeit it might not actually happen or whenever it does, it’s going to be a long, long time. That in the end, and this might sound corny, love transcends loneliness, fear or hardship.My favorite scene would be when Kathryn, Kakay and their other friend were watching Vilma Santos’ iconic speech in ‘Anak’ and Kakay sobbingly asks, “Ang pagmamahal ba sa sakripisyo lang naipapakita?” It’s a good question, and my answer is NO. Sacrifices are not requirements in love; we don’t have to sacrifice anything just to show someone we love them but we do it because that’s how we try to make it work with someone we love and it’s necessary.",2019-08-18,0,0,watch,False

jeyanela_,8,"""Hindi naman doon nagtatapos ang buhay. Lahat ng gusto mo sa buhay, puwede pa rin, You can be more.”Hello, Love, Goodbye is one of the great Filipino films I have watched this 2019. I really love the way this movie portraits Filipino values of people working in Hong Kong for their families. Pursuing your own interests/ambitions away from their loved ones while also considering your family's immediate and important needs is one of the most difficult sacrifice everyone can encounter. This movie really thought me how to prioritize yourself more and to support each other's back when it comes to achieving your goals. For Joy and Ethan, distance doesn't matter as long as the roots of their relationship were strong enough.Superb acting performance of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards. Every lines they have delivered really struck me. The drone shots shown in this movie are really amazing. Excellent choice of songs for their soundtracks.

crazyaiden,8,"For the first time I watched a Kathryn Bernardo movie in the cinema, since I'm not a fan, and I must say it did not disappoint me. The movie is a great depiction of the OFWs in Hong Kong, particularly the domestic helpers, through a romance film. Bernardo did great in this movie playing a domestic helper named Joy. Her character was well developed and mature and Bernardo was able to fully portray it with finesse. As you watch the movie and Joy's development you'd feel like you're watching the true pains and hardship that our fellow domestic helpers go through with their work and life in Hong Kong which I think is when the movie is at it's best. As for the romance part of the movie I did enjoy the on screen chemistry of the two leads and how they went through although their story is not as strong as Joy's personal story alone. Richards is fine as the opposite of Bernardo although I do cringe whenever he needs to deliver the cheesy taglish lines which I really don't like in most Cathy Garcia-Molina movies especially that the way those lines was written in the script, it's just that it did not matched with Richard's character Ethan.

echototheeye,7,"""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" is another landmark on Cathy Garcia-Molina's illustrious filmography. While it may not be her best movie, she sprays her piece with hints of realism, grit and realities on the backdrop of being a overseas worker. All the while, she brought it with some weight and optimism that makes it stand out from her recent movies, even though the tone seems derivative from them. It all works because of the performances of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards, who are able to carry the levity of their down-to-earth characters. And their chemistry is surprisingly exquisite and wonderfully executed that their solution pays it off. The rest of the movie is filled with neat cinematography, a good pace and a cinematic feeling. And even if the rest of the cast fall on the usual entrapped cliches, it is Bernardo and Richards' rapport that makes ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" transcend to its audience. It is one of those Filipino romance movies where I do not hear an over-the-top shouting match. That is at least an achievement.",2019-08-26,0,0,watch,False

Hindi sya yung typical na romantic films lang kasi meron syang substance and hindi sya puro landi lang. So yes eto lang naman po yung limang natutunan ko sa movie na to. 1. TIME - Kailangan nating pagkatiwalaan yan hindi lang sa love or career. Kasi TIME is everything. Ako lagi kung sinasabi sa sarili ko na ALWAYS ALWAYS TRUST THE PROCESS kasi lahat ng mga nangyayari satin lahat yan may rason hindi man natin gusto yung outcome pero at the end of the day lahat yan may purpose and something more meaningful will be handed out to you. Pasok ito sa lahat ng aspeto ng buhay. Time can change everything and it gives us the flexibilty to grow. 2. SELF LOVE - Sa panahon ngayon napaka hirap i apply to sa totoo lang kasi aminin natin na bigay lang tayo ng bigay sa mga taong mahal natin. We became selfless and nakakalimutan natin na mas kailangan natin i prioritize yung sarili natin hindi dahil selfish tayo, Kundi mahirap lang talagang ma lose natin yung sarili natin in the process. We should know our worth and value kasi at the end of the day sarili lang natin ang makakasalba satin. 3. PLANS - Hindi porket plinano mo eh yun na yun, Based sa experience ko ayoko na talagang nagplaplano or nasasalita ng tapos kasi hindi ko sya napapanindigan sa totoo lang, And dahil dun natutunan kung maging versatile and flexible sa life. Dapat open tayo sa possibilities and mga pwedeng mangyari mapa negative or positive man yan. 4. FAMILY - is everything, Kahit sino satin walang idea kung kailangan tayo kukunin ni lord. Kaya make the most it and make time for your family. Sobrang on point and usapang family sa movie na to. Nabigyan nya talaga ng emphasis. Na kahit ano at sino kapa pamilya mo lang sasalo sayo at the end of the day. So we should be greatful. 5. LOVE - Para po ito sa mga single at sa mga in a relationship. So hindi naman porket single ka eh katapusan na ng mundo tandaan nyo na masaya i enjoy yang ganyang phase ng buhay. Kasi dyan ka mag grogrow as a person and dyan mo mas makikilala ang sarili mo that will make you the better version of yourself. Don't let society dictate you what to do.

'Cause when you grew up with overseas working parents and became the guardian of your 4 younger siblings at the age of 14, and now that you're an ofw yourself, you just know. You get to empathize with the plight of the OFWs, and as you get fully immersed with Joy's character, you can no longer stop crying.

iamtylerdurden,10,"A perfect example of a movie created with the most generic formula in Philippine romance cinema, but actually works. For me, the story works because it leaned in the struggles of reality rather than the idealistic world of most of Star Cinema movies.

jiannemsoriano,8,"Leave to pursue your dreams, or stay for the love of your life? This is the question that Hello, Love, Goodbye asks us. This latest offering from Cathy Garcia-Molina, best known for her Filipino romantic comedies, is set in Hong Kong. Molina sheds light on the experiences of Filipinos working overseas by following the story of Joy and Ethan, two Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). We see their lives unfold through the eyes of Joy, a hardworking domestic helper who’s trying to save money to move to Canada as a nurse, and Ethan, a bartender trying to find his motivation in life.Hello, Love, Goodbye stars two of the Philippines’ biggest names from the two of the biggest “loveteams”—Kathryn Bernardo (from KathNiel) and Alden Richards (from AlDub). What’s also surprising is that Bernado and Richards are from rival television networks; in the Philippines, it’s common for actors to be signed to one network exclusively. Their performance in Hello, Love, Goodbye proves that once in a while, it doesn’t hurt to break out of your loveteam to grow as an artist. In Hello Love, Goodbye, Bernado graduates from her teen roles and blossoms into a dramatic actress—a total transformation from her child acting days—in a tour de force performance. Richards rises to the challenge and exhibits his versatility as an actor, proving why he’s one of the country’s matinee idols.To get into their roles, Bernardo was separated from the cast to better empathize with Joy’s feelings of isolation; after just a week of filming in Hong Kong, she wanted to go back to the Philippines. Richards, on the other hand, lost almost 25 kg to play Ethan. Molina is notorious for her strictness with the artists that she works with—but it’s paid off as they are all household names, and her films have been blockbuster hits.Hello, Love, Goodbye’s story is not new, yet it provides us with a unique perspective of the realities of being an overseas worker. The film tears away the layers of the OFW experience with sheer intensity. Shifting away from showing the employee-employer relationship found in other films about OFWs, Molina brings her focus to the OFWs themselves, and their families back home.Read the full review here: https://www.cinemaescapist.com/2019/09/review-hello-love-goodbye-movie/",2019-09-01,1,0,watch,True

You said that their story are like ours, but it will be much better because we can decide the ending. My friend even told me that we should see this because she was reminded about us. Now I get it. To be perfectly honest, what we did was a gamble. I was supposed to transfer my love letter to you in a scented paper. We were supposed to see each other tomorrow. I was about to post a picture about us on Instagram. I was supposed to introduce you to my family and friends. We could have made it work, but we didn't. Ethan of my life, I told you multiple times that I wasn't ready, but you keep on and I let my guards down. I told you many times that we can't, but you made it seem possible. I told you that I am going away and that, you're willing to give up everything for me. I told you that you cannot make me choose about you and my career, but I was going to tell you that maybe I can compromise.However, you didn't. I think we both knew that we are both throwing away our lives to the uncertainty of us. I told you that love alone or our affections and words will never amount to the future of us. You said, let's give it a try and take a risk. Little did you know that I've already given a part of me for you. I'm not mad. I promise. I can't blame your premature promises and affirmations, but I should have known better. I've seen and heard those before. I thought maybe this time, it'll work. Hands down, it didn't. Thank God it didn't. I'm trying to be happy now even though I'm still hurting. I just wish that we shouldn't have made those plans together because it is true when I told you that you make me happy and that everything will make sense with you. I'm sorry if I have ever hurted you. I was inconsiderate at times. If my friends would ask me, I will tell them that I did not regret meeting you because you deserve all the love. I will pray for your happiness and health. I hope you're not skipping meals or burning out too much from work. I also hope you get yourself checked. And lastly, He misses you so much.

jks0910,9,"10 minutes into the film and I am already teary-eyed.Hello, Love, Goodbye is the film that is sure to be successful. It stars actors that has a huge fan base and the storyline is centered on love. I didn’t think much of it at first and expects it to be just another hugot film. Especially, Cathy Garcia-Molina was directing it. One More Chance 2019, I feel like. But, it’s different.One, the setting was in Hong Kong. The film made sure to maximize their time abroad by shooting in different locations. Also, they highlighted it in a way that the scenes are almost always outside. The team guaranteed that once the movie is seen, the audiences will be transported to Hong Kong as well. Second, aside from love, the movie dwells on the topic of work. How OFW’S work themselves to the bone and how they survive on a day-to-day basis. Kakai Bautista’s role was the most impactful for me as an OFW. She might not have as much lines at Kathryn Bernardo’s but when she says it, it rings true. Lastly, the feministic principles of Joy, the heroine. There might be a trend of feministic heroines on Cinema lately like Nadine Lustre’s on Never Not Love You but it still is special. The way Joy was written was phenomenal. The dialogue was on-point, the justification is there and the way the character grew was understandable. Her decision especially on the Climax point of the movie hurt but it is inevitable. Her line of how the emptiness inside her will never be filled by romantic love alone was poignant. Overall, the movie is great as it arises discussion amongst its viewers.

fidel_antonio,8,"Hello, Love, Goodbye catapulted itself as not only the highest grossing Filipino film of 2019, but also of all-time. Unlike previous title-holders, this acclaim is well-deserved because the film is actually good. Two overseas Filipino workers (OFW), Joy and Ethan, meet in Hong Kong and fall in love. However, Joy is planning to leave the city soon to pursue her dreams elsewhere. Meanwhile, Ethan is about to become a permanent resident and is at the cusp of building a long-term life there. What’s most notable about Hello, Love, Goodbye is how it immerses us into the OFW experience — the daily hustle, the homesickness, and the impermanence of it all. Not that the story is any different from Anak or Sunday Beauty Queen, but the film managed to go deep into the lives of domestic helpers and Hong Kong residents with so much authenticity and breadth. And then there’s the pairing of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards, which propels the film’s dramatic stakes to even greater heights. Both are completely believable not only as lovers, but also as people trying to make their families proud. The film’s overarching theme of “chasing after your own ambition” will surely resonate with everyone — that being in a relationship doesn’t mean that you have the same goals in life and that ambition is a personal thing. Every once in a while, we get a Star Cinema film that breaks out of the rom-com mold and superficial happy endings. I am absolutely floored with how the film ended.

louthe,8,"After bringing more misses than hits, it's safe to say that HELLO, LOVE, GOODBYE is the film that finally gets Cathy Garcia-Molina back on her feet to once again captivate the Pinoy cinephile's attention thoroughly. As a celebrated contributor to modern Philippine cinema with her iconic Star Cinema features from previous years, she seems to have lost her touch with her being inclined on quantity-over-quality style of releasing films. 2018's 'The How's of Us' which starred Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo may have worked for some, but to others, it all still felt trite and stale as that still felt like a star vehicle than a supposedly enthralling story-centric piece about young romance.Molina must've listened to the critics because her 2019 offering is quite special for a lot of things ––– all of which make it a solid venture into new horizons for the filmmaker that hopefully, she'll continue to explore to continue an exciting streak of films potentially started by this one. If one were to take it a step further, it's also a bold film, really for what it shows and tells to the audience as a mainstream release that makes it slightly unconventional and powerful. What makes it so is the strength of the discourse that astonishingly, marvelously overpowers that of the Star Cinema rom-drama formula that Molina has always gripped onto. It seems to have came at an opportune time, too, considering the state of Hong Kong during the time of its release which makes it a film of considerable significance that brings enlightenment to a wide audience about the OFW experience overseas. The film can work and be enjoyed both ways, and that's really where the magic can be found, tasted, and adored. As a social commentary piece about the lives of OFWs in Hong Kong, it's fascinating and moving specially because of how the characters of Joy and Ethan are written with specificity where the drama is stressed and is made impactful. And so, that brings us to the other side of the film that makes the romance that they try to invigorate worth buying into knowing their stories that can pretty much be anyone's. Looking deeper into those two facets of the film, it seems like everything here works fine and well, and indeed it does that it feels like a charm so unbelievable in how it is conceived.Though the film may still fall under the trappings of Cathy Garcia-Molina's films, such as the sappiness of the romance or the movie-like dialogue that takes away an amount of authenticity, they aren't huge hindrances to the film being well-formed. Molina doesn't merely make it all feel like a star vehicle for Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards after all since there's meat given to the characters they play courtesy of co-writers, Carmi Raymundo and Rona Co. It may be unexpected, but believe it or not, the screenplay of the film is astonishingly rich even if the direction isn't as masterful as one would like it to be. The actors really work from that, bringing great stuff for us to commend, absorb, and feel; almost Even with the flaws resting in it, there's no way for one to not be won over by what this film packs. A love letter to OFWs not only in Hong Kong, but all over the world who sacrifice themselves for love in different ways, it rightfully deserves to be seen and embraced as a new classic for the memorability of how it converses, which shows its profound dedication and respect to those it represent onscreen with immense accuracy. It's honestly the kind of Star Cinema film that you'd hope to be made more often; tempered, substantial, and resonant ––– a film that knows how to reach its audience in ways that don't feel too compromised and feeble in their attempts.",2020-01-04,0,0,watch,True

crudeprudedude,8,"""Ang choice para lang sa may pera"" (Choice is only for those who have money)It makes me so happy this rom-com is the highest grossing Filipino film of all time. Cathy Garcia-Molina obviously knows how to make a rom-com filled with the genre's tropes & make it sing. Turning it into a love story between two intergenerational Overseas Filipino Workers in Hong Kong who are bound by the struggle to survive under late capitalism & the sacrifice they made to leave their families for another country to give them better life gives Ethan & Joy's love story more weight & poignancy. The fact that it mostly shows the usual places Filipino domestic workers would go to in Hong Kong, trying to cram as much details & stories about the OFW experience in without torpedoing the plot, & holding off on the country's tourist spots until it mattered speaks to its priorities. And goddamn this might be Alden Richard's finest performance yet & Kathryn Bernardo is fucking fantastic.Someone in the Third World Cinema Club podcast mentioned that it's fascinating to watch this now, since it was shot before the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.

lovelily,4,"Is it wrong if this movie‘s spotlight on Hong Kong makes me romanticise Hong Kong more from the view of a foreigner?The movie poster caught me but the synopsis made me watch it as I am interested in discovering more narratives of domestic helpers. As an Indonesian, I learned a lot more of Filipino words which are surprisingly similar to my language, such as ‘bangon’ and ‘utang’, so that was interesting and made me curious to learn the language. As a woman, I hate the fact that body-shaming was absorbed into a couple of jokes during some scenes, notably Miss Central 2019. As a nobody who is not qualified to give any critics on film but will do it anyway, I would say that this movie centres around the life of one domestic helper which is pretty illustrative but not of the domestic work itself. It disentangles a bunch of issues which may probably be central to some women foreign domestic helpers. If there is anything that I would like to underline is that Joy helps Ethan and not the other way round. If you cannot see something as simple as that then I do not know what else to say except to recommend you watch the movie again. This kind of movies that reinforces the idea that men are allowed to force the love out of a responsible, ambitious, and bright young lady just because that lady is too arrogant to love is just... disgusting.

issatong,7,"I read somewhere once that flying makes you more prone to crying but I think that even at ground-level, this movie would have made me cry. On the surface, it looks like your typical Filipino romcom. Guy meets girl, one of them dislikes the other initially, the other person is interested and tries to win their affection by being both pabebe yet persistent, a montage ensues, and as much as one party tries to fight it, they eventually fall in love (chAr).I remember seeing the trailer for this sometime last year and wanting to watch it because it looked promising. While the movie does fall trap to some of the cheesiness and tropes (read: Ethan's backstory) that make the aforementioned typical local romcom weak, it manages to bring a depth to its characters, including l Hong Kong itself, that usually escapes mainstream blockbusters.This is exemplified in Joy's character. I've been a Kathryn Bernardo fan since grade school (hello Mara Clara) but this is probably her best performance to date. We are thrown headfirst into the demands of Joy's life and her routine, the pacing of which I really enjoyed. Duty to family, the dichotomy between practicality and passion, and the price of following your dreams take on a new meaning in her situation. You can't help but root for her and (if you're like me) want to throw a shoe at Ethan. The movie never outright asks you for sympathy. Instead, it paints an honest picture of things as they are for so many OFWs in Hong Kong. It leaves the viewer instead to decide how they feel about not just the characters' situations, but also the very systems that birth and perpetuate them. Glad I was finally able to catch it!

cameronwjohnson,5,"Hmm, sounds like ""Three Words from Forever"". Straightforward as this title is, whatever the complications and heartbreak in Cathy Garcia-Molina's latest romantic tragedy, they can't be any heavier than the story that has to be behind Kathryn Bernardo not playing opposite Daniel Padilla. No, I'm sure their marriage is as annoyingly adorable as ever, especially since this film doesn't set a good tone for them seeing other people, onscreen alone. Bernardo plays a free-spirited domestic worker in Hong Kong, with a diverse network of friends that - don't worry, Filipino conservatives upset about an onscreen couple not being married offscreen - isn't too diverse. She naturally hits it off with a handsome fellow Philippines expat, an ambitious bartender looking to lay some roots down in the city our woman can't wait to get the heck out of. As the two begin to look to their seemingly temporary friendship to help them weather the Hong Kong hustle, it becomes clearer that they have ideas to spend their lives together, and extremely different ideas about how to. As the title plainly tells you, this story won't work out, but it is charming, way to a fault.I mean, this is clearly just another trite and sappy romantic-comedy-drama, of little consequence and even less surprise, with a runtime of two hours. This doesn't want to be ""just another"", as it lives up to its title by methodically examining the process of a potentially doomed romance with the intimacy and draw of a prestige love story. There's more potential on paper than you'd think, but of course it's all hijacked by overwrought rom-com sensibilities, especially with bouncy pacing and gratingly corny, relentless music. Jessie Q. Lasaten's score sucks, and it's just about omnipresent throughout an authentically paced drama to bring out the inauthenticity of its melodramatic situations, frilly farce and general genericism. The script doesn't help with its quirky sense of humor and hearty or histrionic breakthroughs, all cheapening substance that is just full enough to water down that punch-up. That script may only feel obligated to pander to the lowest common denominator, but it sits between the tritest of romantic melodramedies and the most cloying of aesthetics. The average rom-com viewer may also get bored with the runtime, so of course I find more compelling than the average rom-com.There's certainly a unique enough romance in the gorgeous, ever-bustling backdrop of Hong Kong explored extensively as its own character. This scope is more than enough to liven up this intimate love story... but just to be safe, let's overshoot the environment, overwork the editors, and overplay an oppressively corny score. There's nothing refreshing or challenging about this shameless fluff piece, but its themes are a little more grown-up than usual, more frank about the chore of reconciling romantic interests with personal ones. Histories of failures and potentials for success are heavily debated and approached in this two-hour dual-character study, at a methodical clip that may bore certain viewers without the fallback of zanily colorful supporting characters. They bring some laughs, and texture the personalities of lead characters who are spoiled by their own, more mundane humor and quite a few humiliatingly cheesy bearings of soul. Besides that, their motivations and relationship turns are thoroughly, even complexly drawn, and tightened under the solid chops and crisp chemistry of the beautiful Kathryn Bernardo and the handsome Alden Richards. This takes the time to build a genuine human drama, but it's squandered on meager fluff.Between the ready-made claptrap and the meanderingly thoughtful romantic dual-character study, the former pretty much prevails on grating music, style, comedy and melodrama, with enough entertaining sprawl in the lavish Hong Kong setting, more colorful characters and endearing flair, and enough real nuance in the characters, their relationship and the performances, to make Cathy Garcia-Molina's ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" a touchingly heartfelt, just as abrasively disingenuous romantic melodramedy.2.75/5 - Fair",2020-07-12,0,0,watch,False

cesandpooh,5,"Meh. The only thing new about this Star Cinema romance is the ending — it opens the story up to a sequel. Movies of this kind from the movie giant would always end with a definite closure. Perhaps they’re looking forward to another partnership with the actor who was loaned from another network for this movie.The movie was mostly noisy. It had the most noisy and annoying sidekicks ever. They all follow the typical formula of sidekick friends telling the main protagonists what and how to feel. I especially dislike one of the lady friends - the one with the thick Visayan accent. The accent was obviously put on as some form of comedic relief. But it was not funny; it was extremely annoying. No real Visayan talks like that. Alden Richards - it’s my first time watching him in a full-length anything. He works in a TV network that I hate, so I’ve never really seen him act that much. Anyway, I’ve been trying to figure out what’s different about his face. He’s handsome, for sure; but I just couldn’t put a finger on that one thing that’s different until I saw him in this movie. I know it now — he has a very shallow, barely there philtrum! Maybe from the years of wearing braces, his upper lip flattened out?Anyway, Kathryn was good. Almost made me cry again in one scene. But then Alden spoke, so there. Don’t get me wrong; I don’t hate the boy.

reeladvicenet,9,"With unrelenting chemistry and superb acting from its two leads, ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" turns out to be an outstanding romance drama film experience. Against the backdrop and introspective of our country's modern day heroes, the OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers) specifically domestic helpers in Hong Kong, the film was able to bank on even more emotions than expected.Life in Hong Kong is not easy more so for the domestic helpers who are unable to improve their lives even if they wanted to. One of these domestic helpers is Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) who has wants to leave Hong Kong and find a better life in Canada as a nurse. But unfortunate circumstances have prevented her from attaining this life-long dream. Ethan (Alden Richards) is a bartender and has a few years left before he can be a permanent resident in Hong Kong. Both meet one fateful night and while they do not fall instantly in love, Ethan's persistence eventually wins Joy's heart. But their polar opposite circumstances and dreams will make the decision to continue with their relationship a difficult one to make.""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" does enough to make it one of the better romance drama films we have seen. How it accomplishes this is by pretty much making outstanding work on the basics. First and foremost, the central characters of Ethan and Joy were well-written and well-scripted. Both characters had deep-seeded personal issues that were not only central to the film's main conflict but grounded and believable. The script was mostly great having its fair share of emotional one-liners and witty banters but we have to admit, it went a little too cheesy in some scenes. Beyond that, both characters had great actors and performances behind them that gave these characters much life and much justice. Additionally, the main narrative was well-written. It felt fresh and had a lot of unexpected twists, turns, and surprises along the way. The ending was satisfying without spoiling much. It also presented a basic look into the stark reality of the OFW domestic helpers in Hong Kong. However, we felt that the film failed to establish more emotions on this introspective. While it had some unnerving revelations about the domestic helper life, most of these have been tackled better in other films previously. What surprised us most though if the film's cinematography. It's a given that Hong Kong is a beautiful city to begin with but the camera work here impressed us. Overall, ""Hello, Love, Goodbye"" is a great romance drama film worth your time and one heck of a dramatic film at its core.Source: www.reeladvice.net/2019/09/hello-love-goodbye-movie-review.html",2019-09-01,0,0,watch,False

jackcordero,6,"**Watched this for class, and we talked about the rift between mainstream and independent cinema in the Philippines.**The opening sequence of Hello, Love, Goodbye (2019) is almost exactly the same as the first few minutes of Sid & Aya: Not a Love Story (2018), as it makes use of a montage of the scenes to come, all while Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) describes Hong Kong, and her life, and how she perceives love. Again, similarly with Sid & Aya, the first part only follows Joy as she lives her life as a domestic helper, then it pulls the ""then it all changed"" cliché when Ethan (Alden Richards) comes in and pulls out some weird and cringe-y pick up lines to woo her (And funny enough, just like Sid & Aya, the woman has little to no interest in the man). This film almost masquerades as the usual mainstream Filipino romance, with its structure and overall production. It has invisible editing, clear visuals, and an upfront and chronological structure (with exception to the first flash forward montage and a few flashbacks). But where Hello, Love, Goodbye diverts from the ""usual"" is in the complexity of its characters' struggles as its plot progresses. Joy is ""lost potential,"" with the film implying that she was an excellent college graduate. She is almost drowning in responsibilities as a domestic helper, but continues to hustle harder and harder to provide for her family, and to keep her fading dreams alive. Ethan is a hotshot bartender who is secretly full of regret, as he previously left his whole life behind just to chase a girl he desperately loved. Joy and Ethan's dynamic starts out weird, but their love reluctantly grows as Joy comes closer to her dreams and as Ethan slowly comes to terms with his past. Towards the end, as Joy and Ethan are arguing about their future, and what love means to them. Alden Richards and Kathryn Bernardo's performances are strong and passionate in the later acts (despite some very mushy lines here and there), and perhaps this is where the artistry of the independent film lies. Their performances and their lines are the things I pondered about long after the credits rolled.This film definitely leans more towards the mainstream cinema. The mainstream elements significantly outweigh its ""indie"" elements. But, it has a certain depth and profoundness in the messages it delivers to its audience thanks to its good writing and performances. It's far from a perfect film, or a film that I would consider a modern classic, but I can definitely see this being enjoyed by a lot of different filmgoers with different tastes, as it does have a little something for everyone. And because of all these, it's clear to see why this is currently the highest grossing film produced in the Philippines.",2021-01-04,0,0,watch,False

nickvan99,5,"""The time stops when you don't use it."" There's a single aspect in Hello, Love, Goodbye that makes it truly worth watching—its fairly authentic portrayal of the collective plights of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW). As a former OFW's kid, this one definitely hits home, and it's pretty much the same feeling I had when I watched Sunday Beauty Queen. I have heard a lot of stories about their struggles abroad including from my mom and dad. The moment Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) shouted ""I love you all pero 'tangina, pa'no naman ako?"" was pretty reminiscent to that of my mom's sentiments about her experience when she was feeling down while at work. It's really sad, and this one spoke so much to me. And so, I'm gonna give this film a point for that. However, other than the things mentioned earlier, everything ranges from being dull to borderline decent. I have to commend Bernardo's very emotional portrayal of a very emotional character. She eventually ended up carrying the entire film, while Alden Richards, despite being constantly labeled among fans and critics for slightly stepping up his game, seemed a little stale. The chemistry was there, but it didn't really hold up in the long run. I also have to acknowledge how problematic the start of their romance was. See it for yourself then. Moreover, the film still succumbs to clichéd tropes we usually encounter in Filipino romantic films, not to mention the terrible use of music just to evoke emotions that would only work for, dare I say it, wild fans. It's nothing new, so I had to endure it.Hello, Love, Goodbye would have been a huge knockout had it been focusing on Joy's story arc. It's the only thing in the film that I was fully invested in. How it treated the romance aspect was decent at best, but its establishment damaged the film tremendously. Gosh, it could have been so much better, really.",2021-01-12,29,0,watch,False

Pretty easy to see how that gets butts in the seat! But....It’s so bleak. Their lives are so unpleasant. Both are Overseas Filipino Workers stuck in immigration traps in Hong Kong, forced to submit to exploitation in order to retain proper status (one especially tragic scene has a Filipino who's working as a nanny beg her employer to keep her on at half pay because losing the job means getting deported back to the Philippines....and this is a college-educated worker with dreams of being a nurse). Our heroine’s mother gets beaten by her (foreign) husband whom she despises, but has to stay with him for another few months to become a resident (and then the rest of her family--who were left behind in the Philippines--can join her).The driving force of the movie is essentially how these punitive immigration rules ruin their chance at true love and happiness.

She did the best she could with that script, with that roller coaster showcase of emotion she had to show as her character. I really didn’t like anyone else’s acting. Kathryn with the unrealistic, too corny words that’s given to her is at the very least didn’t feel like she played her character, she IS her character, it feels like i’m watching a person even if the things she says are too cliché for a person’s mouth. Everyone else’s acting felt like acting, it feels like i’m watching someone who’s PLAYING a person, trying to show a person, exaggerated, corny adding to the unrealism. Even the smallest characters played pretty badly. The best thing i can say in this is: everyone played their best but Kathryn is the only thing good that came out of this.",2021-03-27,1,0,watch,False

georgedcc,,"A surprisingly affecting romantic drama about the large community of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong. This is something that has been recently explored as a more heart warming drama with Oliver Siu Kuen Chan and Anthony Wong's excellent Still Human, however here we have a similar situation but shown almost entirely from the Filipino workers perspective and with a significant romantic plot.Through central character Joy, who wants to be a nurse, but is forced into the domestic helper lifestyle like her mother, it looks at the difficulties and exploitation inherent in these worker's arrangements. Paid a pittance, and treated appallingly by their employers and the state, this film examines how they can be trapped into this existence and life, allowing them to send a bit of money home to family in the Philippines that they only speak to via video calls, promising a reunion that will never happen.There's an excellent movie in here, but the film stumbles significantly when introducing Joy's love interest, barman Ethan. While it may appear like this film is going to be a standard romantic comedy, it's not really, and Ethan's initial characterisation is straight out of a lunatic American rom-com. After being introduced by pretending to be immigration police and arresting Joy, he's harassing and calling her constantly, that even within the constraints of a romantic comedy (which this isn't!), he's basically a stalker.It's a shame that the film goes down this initial cliched route, after introducing Ethan's character for the next twenty minutes, because at it's core, and once Ethan stops behaving like a lunatic, it's a genuinely tender and quite tragic film about a doomed romance, and about how Filipino immigrants to Hong Kong are never made to feel part of society. The films portrayal of both Ethan's father and Joy's parents is well done, and very sympathetic, which makes it more frustrating that they wasted so much time with Ethan's initial character, when they could have skipped that and presented him as he appears for the last hour of the film.It's filmed on the streets and alleys of Hong Kong, and all extremely recognisable and vivid, clearly made by someone who understands the areas, full of classic ""oh yeah, I know where they are"" moments.Surprisingly bittersweet ending too. This is mostly an excellent film, that's dragged down unnecessarily by the initial appearance of Ethan - made even more frustrating that they roll that characterisation back. Still, definitely worth my time, and a lot better than I expected (but it could have been just that bit better).",2021-04-16,0,0,watch,False

While watching the movie, seeing Joy struggle through her life especially as an OFW made me think about the OFWs.

It made me angry how a lot of our Filipino people are struggling to find means of income, often juggling 2-3 jobs that cause them to overwork themselves.

nimuy,5,"5.5/10For me, it’s a very typical Pinoy romance you’d expect from Star Cinema, so I won’t really go into the quality and narrative of the film. What always fascinated me was how this stands as the highest grossing film of all time in the Philippines. Having an OFW-centred story would definitely play a huge role in this benchmark, since the OFW struggle is a very real experience among working class Filipinos. There’s a whole history behind OFW films that I’d love to look into further while I’m still studying Honours.It was also jarring to have watched this after seeing two Wong Kar Wai films these past few days — I say this because this film is set in Hong Kong. So for me, it felt like an interesting exercise in comparing both localised and transcultural portrayals of a country. I don’t really have a right to comment on the way Cathy portrays Hong Kong people, or whether or not this captures an “authentic” Hong Kong experience outside the OFW life, but this is also something I’d like to scrutinise more closely.I think I can get behind why people would see this as above average, and despite it being an average experience for me, I appreciate the film for what it is. I would love to write further about the film’s OFW narrative and transcultural elements, as they are both integral to shaping Philippine cinema as a globalised medium.(PS: watching Kathryn Bernardo sing badly has been the most cathartic thing I’ve seen all year)",2021-06-13,3,0,watch,False

queegqueeg,8,"Cathy Garcia-Molina departs from rom-coms in a touching tale of sacrifice and love in a city far from home.Leave to pursue your dreams, or stay for the love of your life? This is the question that Hello, Love, Goodbye asks us. This latest offering from Cathy Garcia-Molina, best known for her Filipino romantic comedies, is set in Hong Kong. Molina sheds light on the experiences of Filipinos working overseas by following the story of Joy and Ethan, two Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). We see their lives unfold through the eyes of Joy, a hardworking domestic helper who’s trying to save money to move to Canada as a nurse, and Ethan, a bartender trying to find his motivation in life.Hello, Love, Goodbye stars two of the Philippines’ biggest names from the two of the biggest “loveteams”—Kathryn Bernardo (from KathNiel) and Alden Richards (from AlDub). What’s also surprising is that Bernado and Richards are from rival television networks; in the Philippines, it’s common for actors to be signed to one network exclusively. Their performance in Hello, Love, Goodbye proves that once in a while, it doesn’t hurt to break out of your loveteam to grow as an artist. An Empathetic, Authentic PerformanceIn Hello Love, Goodbye, Bernado graduates from her teen roles and blossoms into a dramatic actress—a total transformation from her child acting days—in a tour de force performance. Richards rises to the challenge and exhibits his versatility as an actor, proving why he’s one of the country’s matinee idols.To get into their roles, Bernardo was separated from the cast to better empathize with Joy’s feelings of isolation; after just a week of filming in Hong Kong, she wanted to go back to the Philippines. Richards, on the other hand, lost almost 25 kg to play Ethan. Molina is notorious for her strictness with the artists that she works with—but it’s paid off as they are all household names, and her films have been blockbuster hits.Hello, Love, Goodbye’s love story is not new, yet it provides us with a unique perspective of the realities of being an overseas worker. The film tears away the layers of the OFW experience with sheer intensity. Shifting away from showing the employee-employer relationship found in other films about OFWs, Molina brings her focus to the OFWs themselves, and their families back home.The film strips down the glamor of Hong Kong, as we follow Joy waking up at 5am every day, hustling through the crowded streets of Hong Kong—away from her family, never catching a dream. She sits down on top of cardboard boxes on Sundays in Central and juggles taking care of her employer’s daughter and grandmother while selling power banks as a side job (which is actually illegal). Molina blends drama and clarity in portraying these hardships, and most importantly, tells the “whys.”The Burden of Responsibility“If you stop, you’ll starve”—that’s the reason why.Joy, and thousands of other OFWs, endure these hardships to provide for their family back home—a message that the film strongly reinforces. We watch as Joy’s friend reminds her cousin to be smart with her money so she can have enough to send back to the Philippines, as the same friend tells her father that she’ll stay two more years because they need the money.Domestic helpers only earn as little as HK$4,520 (US$576) per month, while working long hours. In Joy’s words, if you stop working, your family will starve. Making sacrifices is almost always a given—a harsh reality if you’re an OFW because you have a responsibility to your family back home. This responsibility that Joy carries is one that resonates with many other OFWs.But OFWs carry out this responsibility at what expense?Similar to Still Human, which also featured a Filipino domestic helper, Joy has a degree in nursing. In fact, nursing is a common degree among Filipinos with the hope of working overseas for better pay than what they can get back home. As it turns out, nursing is actually the dream that Joy wants to pursue, and being a domestic helper is just a stepping stone to that goal.Then Ethan comes into the picture. While a movie following the plight of domestic helpers and OFWs doesn’t really need a romance story, the love story still has a purpose. Ethan’s character contrasts with Joy’s. While Joy is hardworking, determined, and knows what she wants in life, Ethan is a happy-go-lucky guy who jumps from one relationship to the next and doesn’t know what he wants in life. But his character’s free-wheeling life also echoes Joy’s self-questioning of whether choosing ourselves over our family makes us a disappointment, or selfish.Joy laments the lack of choice she has in life. As the family’s breadwinner, her family doesn’t know what she has to endure on a daily basis. A nursing graduate that cleans the toilet and eats leftover food—“I’m more than this job, I’m more, and I want to be more,” Joy says.Surely, this sentiment reflects the many dreams of other overseas Filipino workers. They have dreams but they also have responsibilities that hold them back. Joy and Ethan’s romance show the heavy burdens and choices OFWs face on a daily basis. Even something as minor as buying a snack or not is difficult, because every dollar spent is a dollar you could have saved to give back to your family.Dreams vs. LoveA common Filipino phrase, “libre lang mangarap,” tells us “it’s free to dream”. But Joy and Ethan realize, as they try to make their love work, that dreams aren’t free. When you make a choice, you give up something.Joy and Ethan’s mutual romance story mirrors the same sentiments that their individual stories have: choices, responsibilities, and dreams. Perhaps that’s the reason why the romance element works against the backdrop of an OFW story. In this sense, Hello, Love, Goodbye isn’t just a love story, nor is it just an OFW story—it’s a story about finding yourself, and loving yourself in the process. This universal message is something that will strike a chord with audiences.Hello, Love, Goodbye‘s message is simple: give yourself the chance to do what you want, get back up from disappointments, be courageous enough to love and choose whether you want to leave or stay. The film doesn’t portray Bernardo and Alden as people to pity—it portrays them as human beings, with stories and experiences that empower them to ultimately choose how to pave their own way for their futures—with or without each other.",2021-06-27,0,0,watch,False

carlisun,7,"Finally, I watched the highest grossing Filipino movie of all time as well! Hello, Love, Goodbye was on my list since it’s official release. With the new pairing I took some time to get into the mood. All my Filipino friends confirmed to me that the portrayal OFWs is indeed a very accurate one. It was indeed frustrating to watch the everyday struggle and hard work of educated young people in minor jobs to support their family. Nowadays it belongs to the normality to support their families through migration. It’s indeed a very depressing atmosphere and all the problems and concerns were well portrayed by Katheryn Bernardo in this movie. She did an amazing job as usual. But this time the melodramatic vibe really flashed me. Same for Alden Richards. I have to admit that I had my doubts to see Katheryn in a movie without Daniel but all my concerns were for nothing. The whole superstar casting and the successful capture of the OFWs situation makes this movie captivating. I really enjoyed the realistic view and the reality that hits the viewer in every scene. The survival and emotional struggle is detailed pictured and I really loved it that the characters stay true to themselves, no matter how hard is life.To be honest, the depressing reality clash were indeed very much needed and an eye opener for a foreign audience. The movie promises nothing and stays true to itself like it’s main protagonists.",2021-09-22,0,0,watch,False

Like if you go out on the streets and ask an ordinary Pinoy any director they know, high chance that you’ll hear Cathy Garcia-Molina, Joyce Bernal, Antoinette Jadaone, which is the exact opposite in the international scene where names like Lav Diaz (deserved tho), Brillante Mendoza, or Erik Matti are more recognized (well Isabel Sandoval too but just referring to the ones based in PH).Well, at least female directors are popular amongst the locals haha (unlike in other countries where the local and international scene are still heavily dominated by male directors).

She really did well in portraying the struggle of our Filipina DHs.Hong Kong, so close yet so far.

carlobayan,8,"This is one of the best films of Modern FIlipino cinema I would say especially in the field of mainstream media. It's no surprise that the film is the highest grossing in the Philippines. I like how Joy's character and how she narrates the film through her eyes. I like how she's not ashamed to tell her job to one of her friends. I like how she's so candid in trying to keep herself whole amidst the things that try to crumble her into broken pieces. I like how she well portrays how awful and difficult it is for people like her to be steps closer in attaining her goals. This is one of Kath's best roles to date. I also like how Ethan made it a bit difficult for her to leave Hong Kong after falling into each other's intentions and vulnerabilities. What's a bit problematic though is Ethan's character especially in the beginning. It could be a little offsetting if it were to be done to girls in real life with him being a bit pushy when a girl you like is already gate keeping herself from you. But it's good that there was some character development from him going halfway through the film. It's nice he understand Joy has big plans to fulfill and he trusts they'll be together in time.Love is really the most complicated thing. It makes you question if your own dreams are really worth giving up if you can have another one with the person you love. It makes you question what road God has paved to you. But in the end you'll realize that your destiny is what your freewill desires anyway.

I've been looking forward to this one for a while. I gotta say though, I think I prefer Wong Kar Wai's portrayal of Hong Kong to Cathy Garcia-Molina's. Hello, Love, Goodbye tells a very standard love story that's been done numerous times before, and better. A couple meets for a short amount of time in a foreign country, and then are parted by time. This film is incredibly soap-opera esque, and there are a lot of scenes with heavy over-acting and some delicious scenery chewing. The audio mixing is also all over the place. The actors can usually be heard fine, but sometimes the music drowns out what they are saying during important scenes. Some of the dialogue is also really unintentionally hilarious, like the scene where a character is berated for opening a bar instead of becoming a doctor or store manager. No offense to anyone out there, but I would probably be more impressed with someone who opened their own restaurant than someone who manages a Walgreens 😂The pacing is also all over the place, and the film is way too long for what its trying to accomplish. There are some genuinely sweet moments hidden amidst the saccharine sea that is Hello, Love, Goodbye, but I couldn't help but feel that this movie is frighteningly similar to those ""inspirational/romantic"" YouTube videos that get roasted from time to time.If you're looking for a light, modern-pop romance film, you could do a lot worse than Hello, Love, Goodbye.

theshiftyshadow,8,"March Around The World 2022 (7/30)I, for some reason, thought this was a bog standard cheesy rom-com, and I put it on my potential watch list for this challenge because I knew I had some others with kind of heavy subject matter and wanted a few lighter options in the mix too. Cut to 20 minutes from the end and I am sobbing, SOBBING! Not what I was expecting at all. I'll be honest, Ethan's initial pursuit of Joy is maybe questionable, and judging by the most popular review for this film, a lot of people could not see past that, which is a shame, I think. Once the characters actually connect properly this is a really sweet and lovely romance. And as much time as that romance does take up, it's not at the expense of Joy as a character. She is always at the centre of this story, which is about so much more than a really quite cute love story. I wasn't familiar at all with the cultural setting here, but I think there's enough context for everything that it's very easy to understand the employment situations, as well as the family commitments, and all the stress and pressure that comes with that. Joy and Ethan's situations are different but they're a result of the same social, economic and familial restrictions/obligations, and these things hang over their romance the whole time, which adds a layer of urgency and also sadness to them both. There's a scene pretty early on with Joy on a bus, and she bumps into an old college friend, there on his honeymoon, and it's just devastating. I knew at that point this wasn't the film I was expecting it to be. Kathryn Bernardo is quietly heartbreaking in that scene, and she really does centre this entire film. And later when she realises that she's been working towards an unattainable goal for her family, and now she finally gets to have a choice of what happens to her but it's not as simple as she hoped it might be, I was so invested in her that my heart was simultaneously soaring for her, while also breaking. There's one or two little things in here that keep it from being 5 stars, but if you can see past Ethan's somewhat questionable initial pursuit of Joy then there's a really beautiful film here.",2022-03-12,0,0,watch,True

jimeeeeey,4,"I think ito na ang extent ng pagiging experimental ng Star Cinema, lol.First and foremost, Kathryn Bernardo proved once again that she can evoke whatever emotion she wants from her audience. She acts with her eyes, body language, speech tone, just overflowing with passion! Nakakadala ang performance niya!I don't quite get why every single major family in the film had a member who had some sory of disability. It didn't really contribute anything to the story's development nor was it even explored through dialogue. It felt like an easy excuse to elicit sympathy from the viewers, which is problematic as PWDs have been forever subject to being accessorized in films and tv.Wasn't a fan of Alden's character. Too shallow imo. However, Alden himself did a great job in matching Kathryn's splendid acting! He was decent enough to keep me engaged.Played it safe on the ending. Of course, it had to have even a tinge of a happy ending because it is a mainstream film and lots of Filipinos consider a film bad if it doesn't have a light or a positive-leaning ending. It was building up nicely to an emotional climax but the moment Joy and Ethan had that confrontation scene, everything that followed felt like an attempt to repair the sad atmosphere that it produced. I wish the film maximized that misery and took a full-on drama end. Maybe then it would have more impact.Technicalities were subpar. The film did not look aesthetically pleasing most of the time. Perhaps it wanted to portray the gritty experience of living as a DH in HK, but it could have been better. Score utterly sucked. The audience does not need to hear a full track while the scenes transpire. This is not a music video.Tolerable, for sure. Kathryn carried it.",2022-06-02,0,0,watch,False

chesse69,10,"""The time stops when you don't use it.""A heartfelt romantic comedy drama set in Hong Kong following the story of Joy and Ethan, two filipino immigrants. Its not a new story, but it blends the hardships, sacrifice, dreams, love & realities of a overseas domestic worker quite empathetically. The pairing of Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards was so charming & sweet.Hello, Love, Goodbye‘s message is simple: give yourself the chance to do what you want, get back up from disappointments, be courageous enough to love and choose whether you want to leave or stay. The film doesn’t portray Bernardo and Alden as some people who need your pity—but rather portrays the characters humanely, with stories and experiences that empower them to ultimately choose how to pave their own way for their futures—with or without each other.

lawsushie,8,"This film emanates comfort, uncertainty, and self-worth. And that is what Philippine cinema should put out not hundreds of generic cringy-ass rom-com films. Joy, a struggling Filipino DH, who has specific dreams for herself and her family meets Ethan who doesn't exactly know what he wants. A literal manifestation of the 'Grumpy x Sunshine' trope, and I'm here for it. Joy finds comfort in Ethan, even if she isn't exactly looking for a relationship.Amid their emerging relationship, Ethan finds himself filled with uncertainty as his time with Joy comes close to its end. He deeply hopes that Joy will change her mind as he planned everything out for their future. But this is where it gets tricky, Joy has already made up her mind, from the start. She knows what she wants, even Ethan can't change her mind. And I support and understand her. All her life, she has put her family first, and this time she needs to prioritize herself. Ethan does not deserve Joy's half-self if she even chooses to stay, cause she will always have 'what ifs' and that would also be unfair for Ethan.In simple terms, Joy needs to find herself. To feel that she is her own person. Only then will she be able to give herself committedly to Ethan, and he understood that in the end.This is when two persons respect each other's dreams and are both willing to let go of each other to grow individually and come back when they're both ready.Alden & Kath > Kathniel, I still stand by this.",2022-07-30,1,0,rewatch,True

Seenggaknya menurutku.Kathryn Bernardo di sini bener-bener mirip Ayu Ting-Ting. Eh, nggak. Yang bener Kathryn Bernardo di sini bener-bener berpenampilan cewek biasa-biasa aja, yang masuk ke karakternya. Di sini dia berperan jadi Joy, lulusan S1 yang kesulitan dapat kerja. Dia ngerantau ke Hongkong, berpikiran mau kerja apa aja yang penting dapat uang. Karena mau hijrah ke Kanada jadi perawat dan ngeboyong keluarganya hidup sejahtera di sana. Dia nggak ada waktu buat senang-senang, termasuk buat cinta-cintaan. Kerja kerja kerja mulu. Sampai akhirnya ada cowok datang ke dalam hidupnya, pengen deketin dia tapi dia nggak mau nggak mau nggak mau. Nggak bermaksud jual mahal, tapi dia memang nggak punya waktu buat pacaran.Aku suka film ini. Aku tau rasanya jadi Joy, terutama pas dia yang kerja sama orang Hongkong. Aku pernah kerja sama orang Chinese dan keras sih dunia kerjanya. Simple-nya mereka ngomong kayak marah-marah padahal sebenarnya ngomong biasa aja. Ketika ngelakuin kesalahan kecil, mereka bisa marahnya gedeeeeee banget. Aku nggak bermaksud rasis lho ini ya.Interaksinya Joy dan si cowok di mana si cowok nggak gentar deketin. Disuruh pergi ajaaaa nggak pengen pacaran ya bebal tetap aja dekat, ngingatin aku sama ayangku. Dulu dia juga gitu ke aku, ketika aku malasssss banget buat pacaran karena nggak mau sakit hati lagi buang-buang waktu bikin aku selama ini nggak produktif, dia tetap aja maju.Aku mau fokus kerja aja, karena ketika aku galau karena pacar ya bisa ambyar kerjaanku.

I think I found my most favorite Cathy Garcia Molina movie. This is her best work. And Kathryn, wow! I think I found a new respect to you as an actor.Some of my favorites:1. Cinematography - grabe ang ganda ng pag capture sa Hong Kong and how it tells the story of our domestic helpers2. The setting helped in the storytelling, hindi lang siya background. 3. JOY AND HER CHOICE AS A WOMAN - galit talaga ako sa mga babaeng character sa pelikula ni CGM but Joy gave me so much joy. How she insisted that she needs to decide for herself and her happiness. This is cinema! Chos. Add the scene where the character of Cacai asked the question about women being selfish when she choose herself!Mga not so favorite:- Fat jokes! Talaga ba?- The neverending family struggle. I guess it will not be a star cinema movie if there's no conflict with the family. Kaya nga hindi na resolve na domestic abuse victim ang nanay ni Joy. Because there's too many family drama!!! - Medyo makulit si Ethan when he courted JoyOverall, this was really a great movie.

brylo,6,"Cathy Garcia-Molina has setback my generation of Filipinos as well as our cinema 😃 A few notes I took during the movie:- Off-putting editing, too many random cuts, does not allow shots to breathe as well as having unnecessary ones.- Random foreigner actors? Lousy English dialogue.- Suspense was ruined in one scene that was the same as shown in beginning. Legit ruined the character reveal.- Kathryn Bernardo’s acting performance was respectable and well done. First half of the movie made me lose my mind and would have end up giving this film a 2 star or below if it continued. Second half made up for it, it kind of got me in my feels.Overall, I can understand why people enjoy this film, but if it’s the dominating genre in my country, we are doomed.+ highest-grossing local film of all-time in the Philippines?!FALSE IMAGERY OF LOVE WILL RUIN MY GENERATION!*note: I am half-serious.",2022-11-16,1,0,watch,False

kabloke,5,"A story in two layers. The first is with Joy and her experiences as a Filipino overseas domestic helper living in Hong Kong. We not only delve into her journey of wanting a better life for her and her family, but we also get a glimpse of this particular subculture of Filipinos living in Hong Kong, who have carved out a little community for themselves away from their home. Between poor pay, long hours of work, and shuffling through countless jobs and hustles to make ends meet, seeing these workers come together to host their own makeshift beauty pageant, or weeping together as they're watching Filipino dramas on someone's phone while they're in the middle of illegally peddling retail, it's those small moments of solidarity that adds a charming touch. It adds an extra dimension to this life that isn't just all doom, gloom, and abuse (and sadly there's a lot of it) to make you sympathize with their struggle.The second layer is a Wattpad fueled, Twilight charged romance full of the same toxic tropes with the weird stalking and complete disregard for boundaries. They made sure to make Ethan seem like such a bad boy who can get any woman he wants (and they display this by his friends joking around about how all his flings are named after a day in the week), yet he drops them all for Joy because...I don't know actually. Maybe it's at this crucible where a bachelor--who has no reason to like a woman who doesn't come from money--suddenly becoming obsessed with her that people find truly romantic, but then he admits to later gaslighting and manipulating her the entire time towards the end (but he did it for love!).That cute montage of them taking selfies all over iconic landmarks in Hong Kong while a Filipino ballad lulls in the background, is supposed to ignite lots of warm feelings in the belly, but for those who didn't buy into this relationship, can feel misplaced. The only part of the romance I liked were Joy and Ethan's friends cheering their relationship on. Others may see them as one dimensional who act as nothing but cheerleaders, but these Filipino romances know how to make really damn great cheerleading supporting characters that makes you wish you had them in your life. Now if only these male leads can actually be decent guys for once.",2023-02-15,0,0,watch,False

The male lead was honestly immature and did not carry as much depth as the female MC. And I kept wanting to explore more of her history and depth. I honestly wish the movie was longer, enough that we could see her family, friends and their stories more. They clearly have their own stories that are reminiscent of all the Non-chinese hongkongers who sacrifice everything to suffer in a foreign nation for money.

It's a bitter reality of what you would do for your loved ones just to bring them up a level higher on the economic ladder. Being selfish is okay. Choosing to chase for your dreams and to find yourself is okay. Because love alone cannot solely support two people. Can love feed you when you're broke? NO.

Joy is a domestic helper who dreams of working as a nurse in Canada while Ethan is a bartender who is waiting out his permanent residency. Just like how most romantic films go, these two characters meet, fall in love, then… life happens.Hello, Love, Goodbye not just a love story, it’s a life story. About making a choice between love and chasing after your dream. Joy, as the breadwinner, works hard to give herself and her family a better life. She also actively engages in her buy-and-sell business every sunday, and even takes on a second job at night as a waitress. She desperately needs funds not only to send back home, but also to finance her dream of flying off to Canada to practice nursing, her original course. Ethan, on the other hand, is on the road to redemption after letting down his own family. He was supposed to have gained Hong Kong residency already but he left and went to the US to pursue a girl he loved. They broke up and he had to go back to zero in Hong Kong. One is burdened by her family while also committed to her dreams, the other tethered to the idea of making amends to the people closest to him, and a relationship is the last thing they need in their lives.Point of the story was about making choices, no matter how difficult they may be. Joy said “choice is only for the rich.” And she is partly correct. Choice is a luxury only the privileged can afford. It is true that not all of us can have a fair opportunity in life, that’s why when we had a chance we should make sure to grab it and used it. Joy, in the end, realized that she also has to think of herself first and made her own choices for herself, even if it means that she can’t be with Ethan. And it’s not selfish to choose your priorities first, since no one can fully understand your decisions even they say so. Choosing yourself is not an act of “selfishness”. No matter how many reasons you may have to stay and give up on your dreams—even if these include people you love the most—in the end, choosing yourself is still the most fulfilling decision you can do. Of course, if I am in the position of Ethan, I will also do everything for Joy to stay, but we can’t control everything. Sometimes loving someone also means giving them wings to explore horizons of growth.",2023-07-24,34,0,watch,True

marckie,,"A romance different enough from the formula to make it interesting yet close enough to keep it undeniably familiar.The first third of the film was filled with much promise, dipping its toes on social commentary by exploring the world of Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong. In the film’s first conflict, we see Joy (Kathryn Bernardo) deftly running away from police — even hiding in the garbage. This must not be her first time.Was this film going to have something to say about the Filipino diaspora?Once it begins to introduce the romance, though, it left that promise to immerse deeply in the tried-and-tested formula. Which is not such a bad thing.What’s refreshing about it is its confident departure from two-dimensional, well-defined fantasy. An attempt to re-define the ‘Star Cinema romantic film’, as it were. I once read about the ‘Star Cinema audience’ ’s rigid expectation of their movies, that they enter the theater fully expecting their ‘happily-ever-after’s and their convenient closures.* While I disagree with this sense of non-adventure, it is naïve to discount this insight significant enough to define the film-watching market for generations. Garcia-Molina’s cache is exactly in catering to this sensibility.The scene of Ethan’s (Alden Richards) introduction is as jarring to Joy as Ethan’s character is to the film. To be honest, I kept on expecting him to revert to some sort of savior trope in Joy’s life all throughout the film, even in his turn as a toxic Nice Guy in a pivotal moment further in the story. To her credit, Garcia-Molina gave Ethan the room to decide realistically and bear the weight of these choices‘ consequences.It was surprising how natural Richards was able to play Ethan. The writers forced his character to say some purely cheesy lines for the sake of saying them — as lip service to this Twitter generation — but Richards was somehow able to pull it off. And Bernardo did well enough in her turn as the headstrong Joy that I merely had to stop comparing her to Nadine Lustre and start appreciating what she was giving to the film.The chemistry was there, too, in that I could see them pulling off a dialogue-heavy romance à la THAT THING CALLED TADHANA, which is in no way easy to do. Those scenes where they were wasting time beside each other were gold.If our mainstream romance is really shaping up to this mold — influenced by the efforts of Antoinette Jadaone, Dan Villegas, Sigrid Bernardo, and others from the independent scene — then I’m definitely looking forward to more pleasantly-surprising, insightful entertainment.—*Don Jaucian, “How Black Sheep is trying to ‘disrupt’ Philippine cinema,” https://www.cnnphilippines.com/life/entertainment/Film/2019/6/4/black-sheep-films-interview.html",2019-08-18,0,0,watch,True

kuyaed,8,"I appreciate the premise and how it's been told. The realities of being an OFW and how specific it is in the context of the Filipino community in Hong Kong.What bothered me were two things:1. Is a preference thing, but Alden and Kathryn held their own, but apparently doesn't work together for me? Chemistry is lackluster, I hate to admit it but I don't feel for them as a couple here. And it is a romance so it's kind of fundamental.2. Is a technical thing - But I was bothered how this was filmed all throughout in 16:9 ratio. I feel like it diminished the scenic appreciation for the location which is Hong Kong. It could be beautifully picturesque in a theater screen, but with the ratio it felt very TV show. This is basically me nitpicking but I would appreciate a noticeable difference with TV and movie.But overall, not a bad watch. Did it waste my time? Not really. Will I consciously choose to watch this again? To kill time, maybe. Does it deserve to be the highest grossing Filipino film? Debatable.

grborlongan,8,"There have been a number of films about the life of an overseas Filipino worker, as our country is unique to have a very significant population pursuing this route. Among these films, there are gems that stood the test of time, and probably influenced real life and further films, as we see in a scene in this film.What makes Hello, Love, Goodbye enjoyable is how effortless it presents the culture, the active and passive decisions, that OFWs take, to fulfill their purpose. While there is a wide cast of characters with their corresponding side stories, nothing feels misplaced. Maybe a few were quite less filling, the different facets and permutation of circumstances of Filipinos living abroad, provides a peek to a rich tapestry for wider stories of these characters.More than how these stories are told, as enhanced by the shot choices and camera movement that let you fall in love with the cityscapes, is the courage to not shy away from the route of the socially desired, mainstream choice.Until when though do Filipinos need to be pressured to make these choices, to enter these circumstances?",2023-12-08,0,0,watch,False

motion_splatter,,"God, when will the Philippines retire the overly persistent dude wearing down the uninterested girl with his charms? This film kind of makes up for it with the sheer support radiating off both the characters later in the movie, but it, along with other well-worn cliches, threaten to wear the movie down. Thankfully, though, it doesn't. It's still very much typical Pinoy romcom, but it's also one of the best examples of the genre. There is poignancy, clear-set goals from each character, and most of all, a lack of certainty in the end of their love story. Most other films bend over backwards to provide easy answers, but this movie doesn't. Joy's young cousin doesn't overcome the hardships she faces as a newly-minted domestic helper, but she does tap out and get out of them. Joy and Ethan come together at a time in Joy's life when she is just about to leave to Canada in search of greener pastures. Discontentment and resentment fester in each of the lead's personal lives in ways that don't always go away so easily. And yet...not all solutions come clean. Hello, Love, Goodbye gets that. It as a movie has experienced true life, and despite being cornier than most, it's got its finger on the pulse of the way people love and laugh, especially when time is so fleeting. This is the best acting work on either of the two sides, Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards. A change of pace brings out the best in you, I think.",2023-12-17,2,0,watch,True

pvallejo,10,"somehow combines all movie + character tropes possible in the typical pinoy cinema fashion but still had me balling my eyes outthis is truly peak pinoy cinema.. beyond the portrayal of a healthy relationship (finally), i truly enjoyed the portrayal of DH workers in HK in full transparency and rawness.. especially with sending remittance back home as Kathryn also to save money (pag-ipunan) for her nursing agency to fly to Canada .. domestic labor is one of the main sources of income for many Filipino women both at home and abroad. even the opening seen, of her running away from authorities because she took an under the table job exposes the difficult reality of DH workers as they strive to make ends meet for their families back home. joy's situation is very lucky compared to other experiences I've heard of DH being abused and exploited by their bosses. other than being a film starring Kathryn Bernado and surprisingly NOT Daniel Padilla, i wonder what power this film could've had on shedding light on the exploitation, rights, and working conditions of DH workers and the ""outsourcing"" image we have as Filipinosanother line that truly resonated with me was when joy's ama reprimanded joy for abandoning her disabled daughter, annie, on the street.. she unable to pick her up on time.. joy's amma exclaimed, ""how could you do this to her, i thought u loved her"" this made me think about the complexity of love DH workers face.. in ur job description, you must love other peoples children, u care for them daily, watch them grow up, and essentially fill in this role of a parent to these children all while being miles away from your own family and often times unable to spend quality time with them for years until your contract expires.. to what extent to DH workers feel love towards the children they care for while simultaneously feeling guilt that they cannot be there for their own family or children? one possible answer in resolving these complex feelings of love, guilt, and regret is by reminding yourself your sense of purpose in which most of these DH workers find purpose in their love for their family willing to sacrifice to put food on the table and support the education of their loved ones.. YAYA is fantastic documentary that follows the life of a DH worker who in the director's, justin cheung's, words, ""helped build a family at the expense of her own""",2023-12-23,0,0,watch,True

punanicega,,"this is Cathy Garcia's redemption after a disappointing film, The Hows of Us. I was very impressed on how they showed the struggle and working conditions of Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong. it even question the problems of labor export policy and the lack of opportunities and failed social services in the country. the storyline might be predictable yet it is straight to the point, and effective to touch the audiences. Star Cinema might repeatedly used their formula for a romantic-drama/comedy film but they handled it properly. the side story of Kathryn's and Alden's family are justified to be part of the story for us to understand their present decisions. the friends from both sides are only present for comedic purposes but it can be problematic as it serves distraction to the real issue. though, i appreciate the presence of Kathryn's companions who are also domestic helpers. Alden's role fell short from the very beginning and we are left with no assurance of his character development. as well, Alden's pick-up lines are so irritating and I am happy Kathryn was not doing it.above all, this is a breakthrough performance of Kathryn Bernardo as she matured to handle a strong female character and let go from her previous fragile roles. this film proves that Kathryn does not need Daniel to be recognized as a great actress.",2024-01-07,0,0,rewatch,False

They gave such moving performances.However, as much as I love this film, there are some things I didn’t like:-Too many subplots, and not all of them were done well. As the film focused on Joy and Ethan’s love story, many subplots got overshadowed and lost their emotional impact. The one with Joy’s mother towards the end wasn’t even built up properly.-That fatphobic joke from Joross Gamboa’s character… seriously, was that really necessary??-There are so many disabled characters. I appreciate the representation but these disabled characters were just… there. They didn’t serve any crucial purpose apart from highlighting the difficulties in Joy and Ethan’s lives. And why is it that both of Joy and Ethan’s fathers were disabled? I get that the director may have wanted to portray them as weakened, but frankly, having both of them disabled felt forced. Also, the portrayal of Annie’s disability is stereotypical.-As other reviewers have said, Alden’s character (Ethan) is a big red flag. I feel like they could’ve written the conflict without making Ethan a red flag character — without making him disregard Joy’s dream. Also, he was creepy in the beginning. He gave off stalker vibes…-While many of the dialogues were well-written, some felt stiff and forced.-Mary Dale’s disappearance subplot was unnecessary. It came out of nowhere and lasted only for a while, which undercut the emotions. If they spent more time on it, it would’ve hit harder and would’ve really highlighted Mary Dale’s plight as an OFW.Nevertheless, despite these criticisms of mine, I really love this film! It made me smile a lot today.",2024-02-11,1,0,watch,True

silentcinephile,9,"Sorry, I DON'T LOVE 'Hello, Love, Goodbye' because of: (1) The story. MA... MAKATOTOHANAN. It's like the romance drama version of the 2016 MMFF Best Picture 'Sunday Beauty Queen'. So much respect for our hardworking OFWs not just in Hongkong but all over the world. You appreciate all the sacrifices they make and feel the longing and suffering they endure just to send money to their loved ones back home. (2) The cast. I've always been a fan of Alden Richards' acting skills and he certainly didn't disappoint. I initially thought the role didn't suit him based on the trailer but he just proved that he's one of the best young actors around. Talagang ramdam mo at maiiyak ka pag ginamit na nang Pambansang Bae ang mga mata niya. The supporting cast were all great from Joross Gamboa, Cacai Bautista and Lovely Abella (these 2 were riotous), MaiMai Entrata, Jeffrey Tam, Jameson Blake to veterans Lito Pimentel, Maricel Laxa-Pangilinan and William Lorenzo to even the local Hongkong actors. But it was Kathryn Bernardo who surprised me the most. She really has grown as an actress from her teleserye days. Since I choose not to see her movies with Daniel Padilla, I never expected her to be so effective and sympathetic as the young woman torn between following her own dreams over love. I thought this was more of her movie than Alden's. (3) The soundtrack. Moira, Moira, Moira. Just hearing her voice in 'Kung 'Di Rin Lang Ikaw' and 'Ikaw At Ako' gave me goosebumps. And these 2 songs were the perfect soundtrack to Ethan and Joy's love story. (4) The setting. Who would've thought that the busy streets of urban Hongkong would look beautiful on the big screen. Kudos to the cinematographer.But if I were to nitpick, it would be that the hugot lines were too many. Joy and Ethan mouthing them all off sometimes felt forced just for the viewers to remember and quote them when they talk about the movie. Nonetheless, ang pelikulang ito ay MA... MASAKIT SA PUSO pero MA... MAGANDANG-MAGANDA. So sorry, I don't love this movie because... I REALLY LOVED it.",2024-02-13,0,0,watch,True

reeed,5,"It's kind of easy to see why Hello, Love, Goodbye was one of the Philippine's highest grossing films until very recently. It's a romance. The movie it dethroned for highest grossing was also a romance movie, and the one that took its place is also largely a romance (with some time travel thrown in). People love love, but they also love the drama and everything else that comes with it. —And boy does Hello, Love, Goodbye have a lot going on. Overwrought emotions, situations with dire circumstances played to dramatic background music, a reluctant at first romance, and so on. Some of this works, I think a romance needs some high stakes and emotionality, some of it falls flat however and doesn't work. I never felt too compelled by the relationship between Joy and Ethan, so the fact that it could've ended at any time was never really upsetting to me. Mostly the movie was just fun, a little silly at times, and the writing could've had another pass but it was an okay watch and more than distracting enough.",2024-03-07,0,0,watch,False
