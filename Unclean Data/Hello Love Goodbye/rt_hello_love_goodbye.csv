Audience,Audience,"I noticed Philippine studios produce this kind of B-film that's pandering to the mass base and focusing only to the Filipino audience, which is not a tinny tiny fraction of the world's viewing population. Still waiting for the Philippines coming up with stories like Bad Genius (Thailand), Parasite (South Korea), Little Big Women (Taiwan), The Shoplifters (Japan).",Maan P,Apr 16,0.5/5,all-audience

Audience,Audience,"Wonderful story, impeccable acting and glorious chemistry by both leads, beautifully directed and beautifully shot, this movie is truly a work of art. And with such compelling characters and story, no wonder there is a sequel already.",JOE J,11/30/2024,4.0/5,all-audience
Audience,Audience,"Unexpectedly a success film in every aspect! The story was superb and well-written! It is so relatable by giving highlight to the plight of our Filipino OFWs in Hong Kong with a twist of romance that is far from montage of chessy lines and scenes. Given with this plot about OFW, it is so relevant and relatable already to the audiences. The lead characters shone on their own equally in the story the same as the lead casts justified their roles in giving a compelling performances that exceeds expectations. This is a proof that you don't need love team tandems to produce a great movie! Even the supporting casts, they gave so much life to the story of this movie. And they gave intermittent breaks from the seriousness of the main story. Hong Kong chosen as a backdrop setting for the entire film was promoted fully here and went beyond by showing to us the OFW daily life of Filipinos there. This is a certified travel movie as well! The shots in Hong Kong and its places were flawless and stunning! I love that they promoted it not just a ""transit"" place which Hong Kong is used to be known but also a place to stay. Cinematography was commendable. This film was actually close to masterpiece if it weren't for a open-ended ending that I felt and the rest of the audiences were left wanting more. This is highly recommended!",ldgbQNxd,04/06/2020,5.0/5,all-audience
