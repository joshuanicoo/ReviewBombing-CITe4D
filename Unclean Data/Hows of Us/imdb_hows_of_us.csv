KathNiel's G.O.A.T movie!,"I don't usually go watch local films, but KathNiel just have that thing that makes me not want to miss it every single time (I always watch on it's first day too.) lol

So here's my non-biased review. I will try to be as objective as possible. For someone who appreciate movies a whole lot, it is such a hard thing to please me and my siblings when it comes to movies. I was a bit hesitant before watching the movie, rom-com-drama movies are not really my type.

This movie, went beyond my expectations. The cinematography wasn't as great compared to their Crazy Beautiful You movie, but nonetheless, it really went beyond expectations. I never expected it to be as creative and dynamic because of the simple setting and story line, but it was unbelievably quite on par with CBY. Kudos to the team for that!

Story wise, it was that kind of movie which is really simple and not as complicated as others but it really brought out the feels. I specifically loved the beginning part the most! It's not common for Filipino movies to start that way but it did! Not gonna spoil the scenes though. Gonna leave it all to you to find out how beautifully catching it was. Another thing to note, was the transition to each and every scene, the voice overs and the story flow. It's meticulously put together that you'll be hooked the whole time you're watching the movie. The dynamics was there too, will sound cliche but it was a roller coaster of feelings. When you think you're through all the heavy scenes, and can feel the whole cinema audience sharing that light feeling, they'll hit you with the feels again.

To the couple, Kathryn and Daniel, they were really the one who brought the movie to life. Unlike, Barcelona: A Love Untold, we saw how great of a supporting actor Joshua is and for me, he was one of the actors who brought the movie to life. In here, it was all them. Not discrediting other actors, they all did a good job. Darren is a revelation, the kid is a multi-talented person. We can't really say anything about Miss Jean Garcia cause she really is a legend. Other cast's acting were quite bland but it was still a good one. Joross and another actor's cameo was also on point. For those who never had a relationship like me, Juan Miguel Severo and Ria Atayde was the most relatable one. They really showed what friends do, it was real, really genuine. Back to KathNiel, I really feel like this is their best movie yet. Kathryn was on her zone, she really owned this one. She literally shone her, she really showed her vulnerability and it's super far from when she was starting and her teen movies. We really saw Kathryn, not Kathryn with Daniel but Kathryn. Kathryn herself. Daniel is a natural, we all know that. I can't even explain how great of an actor he is, whenever he accepts a character, you won't see a trace of the Daniel Padilla in real life but he really gets into the character and owns it. He was the best Primo just as Kathryn was the best George. They really owned this one.

Direk Cathy showed us again why she is a blockbuster director. She is a legend. Maybe not indie wise, cause that's not her forte. But we can always trust Direk Cathy to bring out all the emotions, may it be tears of both joy and pain, all the laughs and all the frustrations.

Rated it 8 because there will always be room for improvement for all the actors and the movie itself, but overall it is a really great one. A must-watch!",8
TOUCHING AND UNIQUE,"As a non-fan of the usual romantic Filipino films, especially those starring love teams, ""The Hows of Us"" is a unique film thanks to the set up. It's also nice to see a nice twist to the what's essentially the same formula.",8
7/10 rating will do,"I watched this movie out of curiousity... 'cos my friends keep on telling me its a nice movie... well, not bad, the story is good. What I only don't like is the ""Live in"" concept.. it tells youth nowadays to it's okay to live together without marriage for if you two don't click living together..let go and leave each other.. but if you click that's it be with each other... Realization nowadays, Filipino youth seems forget the culture, the values... anyway, congrats to kath and daniel, great improvement in their acting...it won't surprise me if you two brag the Best / Promising Actress and Actor of the year..",7
direk cathy is superb in showing us the ups and downs of a long term relationship.,This movie is the 'one more chance' of this generation. very relatable. i agree that there's nothing new in the storyline simply because couples these days still struggle with the same issues like all other couples from before.,No Rating
I dont understand Phillipino language so...,"Good movie, even tho I didn't understand the language still this movie didn't bored me at all this movie is very cute and lovely ^-^",7
8/10,"For a Filipino Film I'll give it a score of 9/10 It is one of the best RomComs in the Philippines ever!

But if you stack it against Hollywood movies. a score of 7/10 would suffice.

Acting Lead Actors: 10/10, they portrayed it masterfully. Supporting Cast: 6/10, could have casted a better ""Yohan"", they gave him a lot of screentime and his portrayal is lacking. The cousin and friends of Primo needs more workshops. George's friends were the bright spots.

Story/Dialogue The plot is simple and direct to the point. It somewhat dragged when they went to Amsterdam. Dialogue was good 7/10

Direction/Cinematography CGM is one of the best when it comes to RomComs here in the Philippines. 9/10

As of Sept 7 it has 404M php gross, and its only been up for 10 days.

PS: To the other reviewees, please be fair, don't bring your Crab mentality here.",10
Personal review.,QuiteBeautiful siya medyo kailangan lang nila ng workshops pa esp. Daniel,10
"Not supposed to be 1 STAR, but........","Ok ladies and gentlemen, I might get hate comments on this but this is my review on this movie.

First, the only reason I had the urge to create an account on IMDB is because of the overrated reviews this movie has gotten. On top of that, this film became the BOX OFFICE FILM of the Philippines of all time! (So, arousing my curiosity, I took the time to watch).

The material of this film was alright. Nothing extra special to be honest. The usual romcom pinoy film. In my opinion (no hate to Kathniel), it could've been better if someone better portrayed their characters.

Seriously, who would live in the same house and put a division using a tape? Like, cmon, seriously?

There were okay moments, but seriously Filipinos who went gaga on this movie need to re-evaluate yourselves. I'm not even hard to please.

I would rate this film a 4/10 or 5. I gave it 1 STAR to lower down its overrated reviews from other people like giving it 10?? and their best movie of all time? Jeez.",1
Best movie ever!!!,10 is not enough to rate this movie it should be ughh 101. This is the best movie of 2018 literally! Will give u a lot of realizations. This movie didn't GRADED A for no reason! So watch the talk of the town movie and don't forget to bring tissue. KathNiel and THOU team ay maghahakot ng awards!,10
Good movie but not too commercialized,"Neither I am a Kathniel fan nor hater, this is just an honest review (for me).

Before I watched the movie, I made sure that I've had checked social media on everyone's take on this film. Honestly, I was convinced to watch it. As I enter the movie house, my eyes were on point to each scene. During the first part, I totally enjoyed it. Everything was so realistic and on-point. But as the movie runs, it made me bored already. The scenes were all over already. I must say, Can't help falling in love was their ""most matured film.""

Did I leave the movie house feeling heavy-hearted? No Did I leave the movie house happy? Yes, but just to give my thoughts about it. Will I watch it again? Maybe if I want to see what part I may have missed. Was it worth the money? 280 pesos is not bad but I left the movie house thinking I should have watched other local movies that will really make my feelings satisfied.

Let's just be honest here, do you think this was their best movie so far? I don't think so. To be honest, I think I was just convinced by lots of fans commenting that this was their movie ever.

Lesson Learned: Do not believe in what you see or hear.",5
Best Movie of Kathniel,A story everyone can relate to. Kathryn was at her best in this movie and she deserves all the praises she is receiving from those who watched the movie. Daniel a natural charmer and his comedic timing was impeccable. Kudos to director CGM for bringing out the best in them!,10
Must watched...,Superb....the best....movie of the year...touching and may aral...,10
Story and Characters are cliche and boring,Acting is substandard. Story is utterly boring. Very cliche characters and story. Ending is rushed.,1
10/10!,"Cathy garcia molina and kathniel definitely outdid themselves with this movie! superb acting, cinematography, direction, and lines. A MUST WATCH!",10
Don't believe the 10/10 reviews here,"First half of the movie was good, promising... can't say the same for the rest.

I felt like her struggle during the relationship wasn't acknowledged enough when he came back. Then the scene where we're told of what his life was after he left her felt lacking. Sure, he experienced real life, but that doesn't change how much of an a-hole he was to her. I still thought that's not enough for a reconcilliation at this point. But, of course, you see her starting to give into him. Pathetic.

Then there's the letter. Such a corny literal piece of garbage. People who fall for that, are the same people who fall for heart emojis.",1
relatable movie,"Great story and acting from the cast, especially from the female lead. She made me emphatize with her.",10
Must see lovestory movie,"The best ever movie of KathNiel. Mixed emotion, i cried, and the sametime kilig factor",10
"Good production, Disappointing story","The cinematography is good and can be improved. Actors are not that bad. However, the story does not make it worth-watching. The male lead character doesn't seem to have changed that much when he returned. If I were the female lead, I would never choose such man. The good reviews maybe a bit biased because of the large fandom of KathNiel.",4
"REAL, HONEST REVIEW FOR #TheHowsOfUs. ""IN THEIR MOST FINEST PERFORMANCE/MOVIE OF ALL""","Watched it exactly on it's showing date in cinemas (August 29, 2018) and I can say that the audience really missed KathNiel on big screen/cinemas! Sold-out screenings, long lines, etc.

Review for the movie: This is going to be the last tandem movie of KathNiel together with Filipino's Blockbuster Director, Cathy Garcia-Molina. And they really did impress us viewers with their last movie together! The movie is a little bit cliche as you can say but atleast, it has something new to offer for the viewers. Direk Cathy indeed put up her best for the movie turned out to be beautifully scripted, it is by far expectation acting coming from all of the cast especially Kathryn Bernardo (this is her most amazing character/acting as she portrays ""George""). KathNiel didn't failed us on each of their movie. Perhaps, they both keep on leveling up in their craft of acting or as a love team or maybe a partners in real life (hehe).

THE MOST TALKED-ABOUT AND MUST WATCH MOVIE OF 2018. YOU SHOULD NOT MISS IT! ;)",10
Half baked poetry!,"Exactly this is half baked. The first half is poetic, the agony of the heroine is well-portrayed. When in the second half of the movie the narrator tries to solve the puzzles, the story falls flat that you honestly pity yourself for watching the thoughtless work!",5
Beautiful story,Sobrang gandaaaa. Nakakaiyak sobrang galing ng kathniel,10
BEST MOVIE EVER,"This is great movie, may matutunan ka talaga, and also this is the best of Kathryn Bernardo. You should watch it. Sulit ang bayad nyo. PROMiSe.",10
Just fine but,"This movie is just fine. Not boring, some scenes are realistic but I don't understand the hype at all, what's so special about the movie ? It would have been better if they didn't end up together like the dude was such a red flag then they would tryna change him which is the whole point of the story and make them come back together, lol chiche. They really make everything a happy ending like I haven't seen a movie of kathniel that has a sad ending at least this one would be better if they didn't end up together again at the end. I'm only rating it a 3 because of their acting, they deserve that.",3
Obviously the best romance movie of Star Cinema this recent years,I must say the Filipino movies are really improving. Our films can give us so more genres in three weeks. This The Hows Of Us is the best romance movie. 10/10.,10
The Best Movie of 2018 and Best KathNiel Movie of all time.,"10/10

Everything in the movie is at its best.

Do not believe the poor rating and review given by other reviewers, they are just part of other fandoms who wants to bring the movie down.

See it for yourself, for you to know that indeed, this is the Best Movie of 2018.",10
REALISTIC,"This movie is great. It gives you the feels of loving someone. I have a boyfriend and we're already on our 3rd year. Seeing this movie will help you realize things that will help you improve your relationship. If your love is true, it will make you a better person.",10
Added to Classic Filipino Movies,Watched it 3 times and still can't get enough of it. Kathryn and Daniel are very natural and Kit Thompson is such a revelation. This is the best movie 2018 for me.,10
THE BEST,"On of the best filipino movies i saw. grabe magpaiyak, daming realizations",10
Love it..,"Haters are everywhere here.. :)))

The movie shows how versatile Kathryn is..",10
The best movie!,The best movie of all time. Simple plotwise but emotion wise. Your time was worth it to watch thos movei.,10
Definitely a must watch film!,"The story and concept is simple which makes this film more interesting and remarkable in a way. How? Then watch it!

Kidding aside, the actors were great, ang galing ni Kathryn and Daniel! My God, best actress ang acting ni Kathryn dito and yung ibang cast nagbeblend in sa kanila. I love Miko! (Beki friend of Kath in the film). The scenes and lines were very relatable. Believe it or not, yung katabi kong guy na may kasamang gf umiyak nung pa-end na yung movie.

The 'hugot' of this film is not just the typical na hugot pagibig. It's a hugot about life, love, your family and friends.

If given a chance at may magaya, for sure panuodin ko ulit! Sobrang worth it sa ticket prize na 295 (ang mahal bes). I hope a lot of people will be able to watch this film. Pwede sa barkada, sa magjowa, sa buong pamilya (makakarelate si inay at itay). Go na bes, watch na. You won't regret it! Promise!",9
"KATHNIEL'S ""THE HOWS OF US"" , A BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE INDEED!","#TheHowsOfUs The 9th Movie-team up of KathNiel and their second movie with the blockbuster director, Cathy Garcia-Molina (after She's Dating The Gangster) and may I just say that they keep on leveling up with their acting skills as a love team or as individual actor/s.

*Beautifully scripted *Cinematography, Wise! *Simple plot and story but will definitely hit you hard and after it will give you a lot of realizations about relationship/s. *At syempre, TATAK CATHY GARCIA-MOLINA yan eh!

#THOU is their best movie of all! (though lahat naman ng movie nila is maganda). All of the cast has brought such a great performance but Kathryn Bernardo? She really nailed it! She brings a Award-Winning worthy acting as she portrays ""George."" Also, what I like about the movie is that it is very relatable in all aspects (relationship, family, self)

! If in year 2000, we have Popoy and Basha. In year 2018, we have Primo and George. You should not miss such great movie like The Hows Of Us! THE BEST TAGALOG MOVIE OF 2018 so far.",10
PAINFUL BUT HOPEFUL,This movie will break and fix you. A must watch movie,10
"A reflection of the line, How do we save us","The question ""how do we save us?"" does not only pertain to failing relationships. It is also a question you would ask yourself when you are at a crossroad. If you are at a point in life where you needed to choose between pursuing your passion or settling for practicality. It is a question of ""how do I save myself?"" from my own failed expectations when things don't work out to how I planned it. How do I save myself from the self pity? the self hate? How can I admit to myself that maybe, just maybe this isn't what's meant for me?",10
Shadows,"I'm gonna keep it short and simple. After watching the movie, it will leave you with questions and answers you didn't know is with you. The shadows by the sidelines waiting for you to open that urn and welcome yourself by setting you free. Finally. Thank you The Hows of Us.",10
Kdrama fan liked it,As a fan of Kdramas. I will surely recommend this movie. A must watch. You will feel a roller coaster emotion.,10
Worth watching,"Honestly, it's one of those movies that you would not get tired of watching. Very endearing and real. Would recommend",10
The Hows Of Us,"For me the movie is the best movie of 2018,the story,the acting,the direction,the cinematography,is the best,it was the best movie of the year.",10
Dont believe the bad reviews,I watched this together with my family. And it's worth it. This movie is an art. You could really see the effort of each actor and staff in every scene. This is not a typical love story just like what others say. This is uniquely made. Pinag isipan talaga to let the audience feel the kirot at kilig that makes the movie relatable.,10
A MUST WATCH FILM,"This movie really hits me home. Such superb acting and the film over all was very real, it's very authentic it feels like I was watching a movie based on a true to life events. It feels like Primo and George really existed. It made me cry, laugh, feel being heartbrokened, fell in love again and became whole. Please do watch in the cinemas near you. You won't regret it. If your status is in a relationship, moving on or never had been in one. You can get lessons and tips about LOVE. Worth evey penny!",10
THE BEST KN MOVIE,Ang galing galing!! hands down sa mga actors sa movie na to. sobrang worth it panoorin,10
The Best Movie of 2018!,"The acting of Kathniel in this movie is SUPERB! They deserve the best actor and best actress award, Direk Cathy never fail give us quality films with heartfelt message.",10
THE BEST LOCAL FILM OF 2018,"THE BEST LOVE AND LIFE STORY FOR EVERY FILIPINO AND FILIPINO BY HEART. THE BEST OF KATHNIEL, THE BEST OF CATHY GARCIA MOLINA, THE BEST OF KATHRYN BERNARDO. KATHRYN BERNARDO THE NEW BEST ACTRESS OF ALL TIME",10
quality film,"This was Graded A by cinema evaluators. hence I watched it so I can attest how good this movie was. KATHNIEL is undeniably has massive fanbase that cinema owners/malls had to open more cinema theaters to accomodate moviegoers. 420 cinemas nationwide to date... KATHNIEL, the King and Queen of Philippine Movie this 2018!!",10
BEST KATHNIEL MOVIE,"This is not your typical Filipino lovestory. THOU will make you believe in love again, in taking risks, and fighting for the one whom you think is worth it. It will give you a roller coaster of emotion. It is worth every penny. The casts played their role very well and you can definitely relate from each character.",10
Reality,I love this movie. I mean it tacles the everyday life of couples. It strengthens bond between couples. Highly recommended this film,10
REALISTIC,"Superb acting
Amazing cinematography
Script on point
Simple but realistic plot
The right balance of romance, drama and comedy
Characters are relatable because for sure at one point in our lives we became one of those characters


PS: Please don't believe some of the 1 star ratings here because it mostly came from different group of salty fandoms lmao. Anyways enjoy watching thou!",10
Beatifully executed and Strong connection to reality,This movie is beautifully written and executed. The actors delivered amazingly to the point you will be thinking as if you are watching a reality.,10
THIS MOVIE IS A MASTERPIECE,"Every line is a Tagline, a thought to fonder. Things in the house are small things as it may seem but the relevance is so big that I can't believe that a piece of yellow paper can make me cry a river. Not just ""ThenHowsOfUs its alao ""TheHouseOfUs""",10
Best romance movie,"Very real, very touching. We learn how do we save a relationship.",10
Beautifully Photographed,Raw. Natural. Sweet. Wholesome. Lasting. This movie is a masterpiece! The whole run of the story is well executed. Each character portrayal especially the lead actors are beyond amazing. KathNiel effortlessly delivered their natural sweetness and love for each other. It gives impact that lasts.,10
Movie of the Year Material,"I'll give this movie a 10/10.

Realistic. Honest. Raw. Faithful to the storyline. No unnecessary sub-plots. Simple. The actors and their superb acting gave us the rollercoaster ride of emotions. One minute you're laughing and next you're sobbing and then it'll make you realize things you had done in the past.

Kudos!",10
WHOLE PACKAGE!,"This movie is a whole package!! The cinematography, scripts, acting, actors, musics and everything in it is just superb!! Surely, this movie is a must watch and the best movie of 2018! Swear, your money won't go to waste. After the movie, you'll be left dumbfounded. No words to utter. You can only hear sobbing. Watch it and testify!

Thou shall watch THOU.",10
Simple. Raw. Funny. Painful. and Romantic,Simple because most of the audience can relate. The person behind it doesn't need to complicate things to create this wonderful film. Acting is Superb. You feel the emotion and the pain of the main actress. Every breath you hear pinches your heart and then your tear starts to fall. Kathryn and Daniel were really into Rom-Com movies. I love how the humor unexpectedly surprises you every scene and I can hear genuine laughs from the audience. Painful. Yea it's painful. Romantic. Kathniel is natural. Unbeatable.,10
Not your typical Filipino Rom-com,"A strong and raw depiction of a struggling relationship.

No, this is not an epic star-crossed lovers nor a cute campus crush story. A simple story of a couple facing the ups and downs of a long-term relationship. Facing the challenges caused by their own passion and dreams.

There are heavy scenes that you'll feel the weight and tension(fav:first 25 minutes) while there are also light ones that will bring a smile on your face.(the house division sequence)

The characters are likable with strong characterization...thanks to the cast's performance and the direction. The dialogue never felt out of place.

Great cinematography and I love the use of classic songs.

Watch it and you won't be disappointed.(tissues.just in case)",9
A really educational movie on relationships!,"I can back to IMDB to write after long years after watching this movie! The ending is emotionally strong, be sure to grab some tissues... I could connect to the feelings of the guy... one who sees... who feels... but can not do any better... when you start losing consideration for yourself! It is tough! Really tough to cope with...

But this movie is a definitely must watch for every young adult! There is a thing or two to learn from it... I was happy to have watched this :) Feelings are one and only!",10
A great movie where you can get life lessons,"Kathryn Bernardoand George and Daniel Padilla as primo are schoolmates who fall in love.George preparing to get into medical school and Primo a musician waiting for his band to hit it big. Together, in a house they inherited from George's grand aunt, they dream of great success and promise to support each other no matter what.But what happens when the dream of success doesn't come for one of them. Primo doesn't get the big break he's been working for and turns into a difficult and arrogant artist who can't even help with the bills.
