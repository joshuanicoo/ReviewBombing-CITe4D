philbertdy,6,"There used to be a time when the powers-at-be were trying to convince people that Daniel Padilla was cool, casting him as the broody teenage bad-boy that had to be won over by the steely determination of his good-girl paramour Kathryn Bernardo. But he's not cool, at least in that way. He's got a big goofy smile, a friendly presence, and an earnestness that gives his characters surprising vulnerability. His growth as an actor largely involves him being comfortable up on screen, being some version of himself that's closer to who he really is.And this leads to the best bits of this movie, which almost seem to happen in a vacuum of narrative. It doesn't matter what came before or what might happen after. In the moment, it just looks like these two kids are enjoying themselves. Kathryn Bernardo hasn't quite kept up with Padilla's development, her performances getting a little stiffer as she gets older, but their clear affection for one another smooths out a lot of these scenes.But these moments don't actually exist in a vacuum. There's a movie around it, and like so many local big romcoms, there are just too many things going on. All the classic formula markers are there, too: some sort of medical problem, some parental issues and a whole bunch of characters that exist purely to tell the leads what they're supposed to be feeling. The movie stretches into two hours with the added weight of these rote elements, and by the time they fly off to some foreign land, it kind of feels like an entirely different movie. It shifts focus completely, and starts filling in even more backstory through yet another character that just says everything outright.The story they end up telling is actually pretty simple, but there are just so many other things that crowd out the much more affecting core of this story: two people still clearly in love with each other, just trying to overcome the hurt that also still exists between them. In bits, in moments, the two kind of make that work. But the movie itself feels so caught up in the norms of their genre to just let the leads take the lead.",2018-08-29,51,1,watch,False
grepel,7,"HEARTFELT. This film presents a distinct, powerfully affecting kind of love story to prove that the standard CGM formula has still some unique perspectives to spin and explore. Here’s a mind dump (with little spoilers) rendered in the same fashion as the film’s break-build narrative, starting off with negatives (baka awayin ako ng fans, lol), wrapping up with positives. 1. The opening voiceovers are certainly moving but seem lengthier than necessary. I hate that I feel like I’m being spoon-fed.2. Daniel’s character is rather poorly developed. And the choice to reveal his backstory through another character’s verbose lines is quite a disappointment. 3. I am totally confused about (what I think is) the turning point where Primo has to leave because that’s obviously what he is asked to, then is instantly being chased by George afterwards. There is no question about Kathryn’s acting, but seriously I’m like, “Girl, why are you crying? Pinaalis mo ‘di ba?” And when he returns, she says something like “That’s not what I actually meant because I was just tired, and that I wanted you to fight for us that night.” Ang labo. 4. The prepossessing bike scene gets less delightful when Primo starts throwing gibberish pick-up lines. Ganda na sana eh. Rickety in part but there’s so much that makes it worthy as a whole:5. Editing does not look as though it’s rushed. ‘Buti naman. 6. A dialogue-heavy scene backdropped by Amsterdam’s glaring flower fields and lovely sunset is my favorite. How would you feel if you’re in a beautiful place, talking to someone you love about how your lives got better after you painfully parted ways? Tearful acceptance, ganun. Ako, hindi ko alam. Unfathomable. 7. Second favorite is the harana/apology scene. Pain and kilig stirred together. 8. It may not be picture-perfect, but it’s a warehouse of authentic messages, inspirational ideologies, and lessons in love, which I gladly take away:- Relationships take great, great effort to maintain. It’s easy to give love and be happy when things are going well. But what happens when life suddenly feels as though it’s caving in with a spirit-crushing weight? Ang tanong eh kung kaya mo pa. Pero kung siya ayaw na, tama na. Ginawa ko na ‘yan. Okay naman ako. Pero ako lang ‘yun. - I give a nod everytime Primo says “Sayang iniwan kita, nagkahiwalay tayo,” and George will answer “but we became better persons.” Eh kasi tama naman. We don’t grow when things are easy, comfortable, and effortless. We grow when we face something beyond what we’re capable of handling. Kahit magkahiwalay pa kayo. Again, ako lang ‘to. - For the most beautiful part: Just because we think our heart is broken doesn’t mean it’s incapable to love again. (Sa’kin talaga galing to? Hahaha!) It’s those times when we have to step aside, heal in whatever foolish way we can, and remind ourselves of what keeps us going. It’s when we think na wala nang dahilan magmahal ulit kasi masasaktan ka lang ulit, that instead of curling up and hiding from the world, we gather our scattered bits of resolve to keep moving forward, whether with someone from the past, with someone new, or with yourself alone. Friend, life is worth every single moment. Be open to lessons from your hardships and misfortunes — they will build within you an unshakable passion, acceptance, understanding, and LOVE. THOU redefines my idea of living life, makes me want to fall in love again.",2018-08-31,2,0,rewatch,False

To make us feel or just even tell us that everything will be okay. Primo’s character is also us in some moments of this so called life that we are in. We pursue our passion and only think of ourselves (I think, this is the majority of the millenials). But sometimes, unfortunately there will come a time that we’ll be in a crossroad and we only have to choose one path. Yourself or not yourself. They say, you are lucky if you found what you are passionate about and make a career out of it. But sometimes our stars doesn’t align in what we know we want to pursue and what we need or know to do. I consider myself lucky in my career. Not YET financially but I love what I’m doing and where I am at. My takeaway in the story is that if you love someone, fight for this person. No matter what.

In this movie however, Director Cathy Garcia-Molina flipped the script and made Kathryn shine more out of the duo. Don't get me wrong, Daniel is still a great screen presence but he was encumbered by what is, in my opinion, a deeply unlikable character while Kathryn got to play a long suffering and determined young lady and really got her chance to shine here.

cameronwjohnson,5,"I don't know if I have nearly as many questions about how this couple happened than I do about the one in ""She's Dating a Gangster"". This onscreen romance between Kathryn Benardo and Daniel Padilla can only be healthier than their last one under Cathy Garcia-Molina, but we're still talking about an aspiring musician and a medical student moving in together after she inherits her great aunt's hows-I mean house. I don't know how mature the film itself is with that wordplay in the title, so of course it's not too long before the med student gets tired of supporting the bum. Years later, ""he just happens"" to return declaring that he is a ""changed man"", but at least sticks around when he discovers that his ex-girlfriend blew up her medical career to whine about breaking up with her boyfriend. As if that's not unhealthy enough, after they ruined their first relationship with too much pressure, they have to start a new one by selling the house and finding the female lead's estranged father before her brother goes blind from diabetes. Along the way, they figuratively return to the debate club where they literally met to assess the ""hows"" that will save these lovers, even though the only one that counts is that they're played by Kathryn Benardo and Daniel Padilla. Filipino cinema's hottest power couple are sure to draw a crowd to what bickering they can manage, but the film still has to pander to them to oblivion.The masses might be a bit thrown off by the film's wildly convoluted nonlinear storytelling, and even then, it's mostly hard to keep up with the rapid-fire progression of the characters' arc settling into the house and adapting to their draggier reunion some years later. Something as overdramatic as a flashback structure mostly just shows how contrived this thing is, as a simplistic melodrama that forces conflict in the flashback storyline to spice up an initially ""happy"" home and facilitate its downfall, and blows the reunion arc on either randomly searching for an estranged father or a grown-ass doctor screaming about the ""tragedy"" of getting dumped. This film deals with some pretty sophisticated themes on how individuals are complexly shaped by their relationship, and although fairly likable character undergo a lot of change, it's all undone by those ""I can't live with you"" confrontations and ""I can't live without you"" declarations. It's never a particularly well-written romp, of course, the comedy being almost singularly embarrassingly juvenile screwball banter with friends or cutesy shenanigans with the couple, whose romantic interplays are devalued by sexual tension and saccharine dramatic progression. For the film to talk about moving into an adult relationship, this is in no way an adult movie, with Cathy Garcia-Molina being just one of many writers on a flimsy committee, and giving up on carrying this above that as directress. As full-hearted as her frantic overstylization, over-scoring, overpacing and overall overhandedness are, it's yet more grating pandering that wears down a superficial romantic dramedy. It's just a fluff piece, and it's sure to please the crowd, sometimes with actually tasteful elements.The wooded suburban house is a key character, and a comely one at that, with a beauty and humility beaming with some of the truest romance in the atmosphere of a film all about the hassle of a couple settling down. This sentimental tone is carried over by Jessie Lasaten's sweetly bright score and Noel Teehankee's dreamily polished cinematography, but without the maturity naturally inherent in that home. Cathy Garcia-Molina's direction just keeps going too far with the romantic disposition, but no matter how cloying this gets, there's always such honesty in such fiery emotion. As melodramatic as the film gets, there are times when Garcia-Molina is simply owning up to that with her dreamy sentiments, trusting that the cheese will be grounded by the admittedly fairly solid character factor. It's a romantic drama about growing up that is in no way grow-up, until there comes a point in both the flashback and present-day segments when the characters really start to break through, losing a grip of their prospects under the pressure of making a home, then reuniting some time later to further contemplate how they function as a unit. Juxtaposing these two processes deepen fairly sharp themes on understanding the differences between healthy dependency and toxic codependency; sacrificing your own prospects and supporting someone else's; and succumbing to the burden of a serious relationship and giving it time to breathe. I can tell you one thing: it's getting hard to see Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla functioning without each other, their radiant chemistry continuing to flourish alongside their bubbly charms and often surprisingly piercing emotional forces, as they try to hold together a film that is having a harder time managing fluff with true maturity.The nonlinear narrative is just part of the incessant contrivances that devalue a would-be mature love story, but not like the grating humor, histrionics and overstylization that render this strict pandering, with enough charm in its craft and punch-up, if not enough depth in its character developments and the leads' chemistry, to save Cathy Garcia-Molina's ""The Hows of Us"" a likably farcical romantic drama that warms your heart in some places and leave it cold in others.2.5/5 - Adequate",2019-06-27,1,0,watch,False

ichahrnssa,8,"Bingung sebenarnya mau nulis review film ini gimana. Bukan karena filmnya jelek, tapi karena filmnya RELATABLE SEKALI, KAKAK. Aku bingung karena aku pasti kecurcol soal mantan. Aku gatel pengen cerita soal kehidupan percintaanku, sesuatu yang rasanya bisa menjijikkan buat dibaca orang lain. Bisa bikin orang lain memaki, “MANA BAHASAN SOAL FILMNYA, ANJIIIIIIR. MALAH CURHAT SI BANGKEEEEEE.” But… fuck it. Aku tulis aja deh. Aku nggak tau mau nulis apa juga. Selain film ini bagus kecuali adegan pas setting-nya berpindah di Amsterdam di mana pas bagian itu terasa membosankan. Bagi yang males dan mual kalau baca curhatan, bisa berhenti sampai di sini.-------------------------BATAS SUCI-----------------------------Tuh, aku bikinin batas sucinya ehehe.Aku ngerasa kenapa nonton ini pas banget dengan momen si mantan ngajak balikan. FYI, aku dan si mantan putus beberapa waktu lalu. Aku diputusin, lebih tepatnya. Ehehe.Film ini seolah bikin aku optimis mau dan bisa balikan sama mantan. Karena filmnya tentang pasangan yang putus terus balikan lagi. Tentang cowoknya yang buat salah terus cowoknya minta maaf, menyadari kalau ternyata dia yang salah dan berusaha berubah. The Hows of Us adalah mimpi basah bagi orang-orang kayak aku. Yang dalam lubuk hatinya pengen balikan tapi takut bakal hancur lagi. Yang ngerasa bingung kalau pake otak, jadinya rasional. Kalau pake hati, bisa senang tapi irasional. Kalau ngikutin otak, wajar banget rasanya kalau nggak balikan. Memang harusnya nggak balikan. Kalau ngikutin hati, rasanya pengen balikaaaaan aja. Memaafkan dengan mudah apa yang telah dilakukan mantan.Aku nggak bilang kalau sepenuhnya mantan yang salah. Aku juga salah. Aku nggak bisa memenuhi ekspektasinya. Aku nggak sesempurna yang dia mau. Aku udah berusaha berubah jadi apa yang dia mau, tapi aku nggak bisa. Rintangan yang dihadapi menuju ke 'arah sana' juga bukan dianggap cobaan, tapi halangan. Aku nggak berhasil meyakinkan dia buat terus berusaha demi aku. Demi kami.Aku paling ingat kata-katanya temannya George (Kathryn Bernardo), salah satu tokoh utama di film ini. “George, I know that story all too well. First, you start to listen. Then you believe what he says. Then you agree what he wants. Then you’re fooled again, you’re naive another time! Listen to me, do not repeat the same mistake!”George adalah perempuan cerdas yang bisa jadi contoh dari kalimat, “Kalau soal cinta, semua orang bisa jadi goblok.” Temannya George udah kayak Kak Ira, kakak sepupuku, pas nasehatin aku jangan sampai balikan sama mantan.Hiks. Ditambah lagi, George dan Primo (Daniel Padilla), sepasang kekasih yang udah jadi mantan, waktu pacaran punya panggilan sayang. Yaitu Jo.JO ANJEEEEER.KENAPA HARUS JO. ANJEEEEEEEEEEEER.FILM KURANG UAJAAAAAAAR. Ya gimana, aku manggil si mantan waktu masih pacaran dengan nama Jojo. Tapi aku sering panggil dia, “Jo,’ dan nama kontaknya di hapeku itu aku tulisin nama Jo. HUAAAAAAA KENAPA BISA KEBETULAN SIIIIH. Film ini brengsek. Patut aku bilang brengsek karena bikin aku optimis aja buat balikan sama si mantan. Bikin mikir kalau aku juga bisa kayak George yang akhirnya balikan sama Primo. Aku nggak bisa bohong dengan bilang aku nggak sayang sama mantan. Aku masih. Nggak berubah. Nggak tau sampai kapan. Aku pengen rasa ini berubah, minimal berkurang sedikit. Tapi malah…. aaaarrrrrrrgh. Cuman kalau balikan lagi, pasti kami berantem lagi. Nyakitin lagi masing-masing.Hahahaha. Hahaha. Haha. Ha.Ih ngeselin ya kalau jadi orang baperan.

Seakan mau pamer aja syut di Amsterdam, setelah sebelumnya di Barcelona di film Barcelona A Love Untold. Tapi bukan berarti buruk. Walau klise, cerita dibuat se-believeable mungkin. Sebab akibatnya. Konsekuensinya. Tentang si perempuan yang muak dengan idealisme cowoknya. Masa si Daniel (eh aku lupa di sini nama peran dia siapa? sudah nonton sebulan lalu) nggak mau nyanyi bahasa Inggris di kafe hanya karena idealisme. Hehehehe. Mending situ nyanyi di kamar mandi, kan beda musisi pro dan musisi kamar. Maksudnya keidealismean dia terlalu banyak dan kurang menohok aja. Bahkan sampai ditinggalkan temen ngebandnya. Mungkin mereka disuruh ganti genre dangdut kali ya sama produser rekamannya sampai Daniel nolak ambil proyek rekaman.Si Kathryn gagal jadi dokter, karena mengurus suami kumpul kebonya. Mereka belum kawin sih. Tapi bebas, kan Filipina. Di sini juga ada wkwkw. Aku suka aja kegerahan Kathryn dengan toxic relationships antara mereka berdua. Kalau cinta itu butuh duit, bukan cuma kepercayaan. Sayang aja mesti happy ending dan mereka balikan lagi. Kalau gue mah ogah, emansipasi ciiinn.

pezka,6,"The first act, sweetie, you're doing amazing! The Amsterdam sequence—you don't even go here 😭😭😭Just when I thought this film strayed away from formulaic, comfortable rom-com that never fails to have: a hugot festival, kids with parental issues, and the need to go to special places to release repressed feelings, instead it stayed loyal to it. The beginning was so promising, may pa-slow motion pa, but it wasn't consistent. Also, I'm curious as to how and why they make the audio in these types of films. There's something about how voices are amplified too much or smoothened out. Sometimes, it looks like it was dubbed which I find disturbing. Anyway, Kathryn Bernado's acting is stale as ever and I almost pity Daniel Padilla who caged in roles as a charismatic loverboy that it scares me to see him outside it.",2020-07-20,2,0,watch,False
makilim,6,"While the start and main problem were promising, the formulaic resolution was very disappointing. I just don't get the point of already starting with the post-breakup, and then showing the redeeming value of Primo was with him all along, even before the breakup, as if pointing out that it was all a misunderstanding. This subtly puts the blame on George for not knowing that Primo was actually a good man (she should have just trusted him!).This should have been a film about HOW Primo acknowledges his accountability and redeems himself, and HOW George finally finds in herself the courage to forgive and love again. That would have been less formulaic, less harmful, and most probably very endearing.Also, what's with the exaggerated acting? Almost all of them are good to great actors (except of course for Espanto), and yet most of them were also over the top. I think, because they have proven in their other projects that they can act, that it's a directorial problem.

cesandpooh,10,"This is the first Kathniel project i ever truly liked — loved even! In typical Star Cinema fashion, the movie starts with a chaotic scene depicting hyperactive leads that, somehow, lose that hyperactivity through the rest of the film.In another typical Star Cinema fashion, insert the need to shoot in a foreign country. I have to be honest, though — those Amsterdam scenes could have also panned out effectively if shot in some remote province in the Philippines. But, yeah, I know Amsterdam doesn’t require permits for filming there, so I guess Star Cinema took the opportunity to film and have a European vacation at the same time. Typical Filipino showbusiness tactic. Splitting the house in two - seen that many times, mostly in comedies. It did the job for this movie, though. It worked as a story device that did not feel forced.Anyway, Kathryn and Daniel have both really matured in this movie. Especially Kathryn — in all her previous movies where she was supposed to play an adult, she didn’t quite do so well. I mean, acting-wise, she did. But in terms of looks, she always looked like some teenager and, sometimes, even a child. So I commend the styling team for doing a good job with her look for “The How’s of Us”. Her screen presence matured. As for Daniel, boy, has he grown into a man. I especially love him in this role. I love it when men are depicted as soft, vulnerable, and pitiful — in the context of a love story, of course.And this — I cried. Yup. I tried to hold back the tears, but I just couldn’t. This is the true hallmark of good storytelling — when you fight your emotion, but it gets the better of you.",2020-09-29,0,0,watch,True

(i personally would not have forgiven him, i have to say. the relationship that primo and george had was too toxic, and it hit a little too close to home than my liking)there are many things i would still like to say about this film, perhaps i’ll expound more on this when the morning comes. just know that this was a good watch, not the best, not the worst, but good.",2020-10-24,4,0,watch,False
aintdrei,5,"""George, I'm sorry.""""And what makes that sorry different from all your other sorrys before?""I've always been a devoted admirer of Kathniel, eagerly anticipating each of their upcoming movies. They stand out as my preferred Filipino loveteam, especially since I used to follow Social Seryes on Twitter inspired by their story. My admiration for Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo deepened after watching this particular film in theaters.While the movie's plot follows the typical, cliché, and foreseeable pattern of Filipino romance films, I found it delightful because of the remarkable chemistry between the two leads. Somehow, they infused it with a special and heartfelt quality. Kathryn Bernardo's acting deserves special recognition; her exceptional performance left a lasting impact, even stirring my emotions at 3:00 AM.Forgiveness, a challenging virtue, becomes particularly daunting when faced with someone who has caused you pain and shattered your self-esteem. The decision to forgive or harbor perpetual resentment carries immense pressure, complicated further by the fear of disappointing those opposed to your chosen path.I won't deny that Primo was quite the jerk in the past, blinded by his dreams to the harsh realities around him. Despite acknowledging George's struggles in a letter, he failed to take meaningful action. His reckless behavior, fueled by alcohol, exacerbated their financial woes. Fortunately, George displayed remarkable understanding and selflessness. It's heartening that Primo eventually transformed into a better person, learning from his mistakes and genuinely committed to fixing everything.In contrast, I resonate more with George's approach. I refuse to let the same person inflict harm on me once again.",2020-10-24,5,0,watch,False

Same Cathy Garcia-Molina formula. Same Filipino romcom formula. What made this film better though is how warm and pleasant Kathryn and Daniel act together. Their chemistry made this film work. I would have loved this more if the film focuses on Primo and George's story. More scenes during their stay on Tita Lola's house, what happened after Primo left, and after Primo came back. It's like the Barcelona: A Love Untold. Too many sub-stories that could have been deleted.Overall, I love it. THIS IS DANIEL PADILLA'S MOVIE.",2020-10-24,0,0,watch,True

reeladvicenet,7,"At two hours long, ""The Hows of Us"" was limited severely by so much bloat and so many tropes that it really made us wonder why they just didn't tell a straightforward story in the first place. But don't get us wrong though, it wasn't a bad experience at all and we actually found ourselves liking this film much more than we anticipated. But its barely middling middle section should have been reworked maybe even removed.For years, Jo (Kathryn Bernardo) and Primo (Daniel Padilla) had a long-lasting relationship so much so that when Jo’s Aunt died, she left her house to the both of them. But with Primo, a budding musician, failing to attain the success that he feels he is beholden to and with Jo feeling that Primo’s failures are holding her back, Primo abandons Jo all by herself. A few years pass by when Primo suddenly shows up and wants to fix the wrongs he has done in the past - including his relationship with Jo. But this isn’t as simple as it sounds as Jo plans to sell their house soon and hasn’t really forgiven and forgotten that Primo left her to fend for herself. We must admit that “The Hows of Us” left us with a heavy dose of mixed feelings. On one hand, its narrative and story really had potential to be substantially and emotionally moving. But the film also suffers because it felt it needed to do genre tropes within its story that was just unnecessary. For example, there’s a parent or sibling who suffers a sickness in the most opportune time or simply travelling to a foreign country. We wished it just told a more straightforward and down-to-earth story - one that we could actually imagine happening in real-life and not one obviously written for the big screen. While the overall narrative was bloated, the film actually had bright spots. In fact, the first thirty minutes and last thirty minutes were outstanding in our opinion. It had us gripping our seats with emotionally moving moments. Of course, these scenes were bolstered by the great chemistry and acting between Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla. Overall though, “The Hows of Us” will make you swoon in key moments and if that’s what you’re after, you’ll actually find it a story worth experiencing.

dibidi,7,"this is peak Pinoy romcom cinema. it has everything you’d expect; flashbacks and flashforwards, a junket trip to Europe, 2 charismatic leads, etc. what separates this from the fluff is its execution, the story (up until the end) is well crafted and avoids the natural pitfalls of the premise it set up for itself. the protagonists have agency and do not make any decision just for plot contrivance. not to say this is a perfect movie, it has its problems— the editing and pacing is not quite there. it spends way too much time meandering through Amsterdam, and crafting a Pixar Up-like sequence in the beginning was not necessary if they were only going to spend a lot of running time going through the past all over again, so there is no economy of storytelling present. my biggest problem though is the ending. i understand why they did it the way they did, but imo it was completely unnecessary and actually harms the characters’ growth during the movie. SPOILER what the ending does is retcon the movie’s story; we find out in the end that Primo actually knew he was being a selfish prick before he left, but instead of actually doing something about it, he instead, what, wrote a letter? that makes it okay? that actually makes it worse, because now we know he had a CHOICE to be better 2 years ago, but he chose not to. his 2 years of change therefore did not matter because it implies he in fact didn’t change, at all. then they have George APOLOGIZING to him? as if anything was her fault? that is wrong on so many levels. this development looks unfortunately to have been put there only to create a reason for George to get back together with Primo in time for the movie to end, but this was completely unnecessary. Primo has grown as a person, he’s already shown this to George, and George already acknowledges that he has. there was no need for the letter. instead, what they should have done was, after all the items have been sold off, have both of them say farewell to their past selves, the people that owned that house, and reintroduce each other as new people. have the movie end with George agreeing to go on a first date with Primo, a chance that this time around, things will work out.",2020-11-04,0,0,watch,True

Please, crying easy doesn't mean your acting is effective.5. Philippine cinema formula. Yes, let's shoot at overseas location to use the beautiful sceneries as background and our studio gave us extra budget anyway eventhough it doesn't really add anything to the story itself. Check.6. The unnecessarily long runtime of 117 minutes. There's lot of useless stuff there. Does this film think it's an epic?7. What's up with that end credits scene? Soooo cringey.8.

Then the second act came and this movie just falls into like any other Filipino romantic drama films with the “return of the exes and still hung up from each other after not seeing or communicating after many years but it felt like nothing has changed and we still love each other so much that we end up together because LOVE CONQUERS ALL ADVERSITIES” trope with a little bit of an identity crisis from our supporting characters as a side plot.I really thought this film was gonna give us a tale of couples dealing with ups and downs and eventually, a breakup and going through the transition of being single after being in a committed relationship for so long. It did touch that issue in the first act but it was so rushed and I just didn’t feel any sympathy or connection with the characters. I really believe this movie isn’t really worth the hype.Phenomenal acting from Kathryn but still unimpressed with Daniel’s acting ability still.

denlebantino,4,"The film's premise surely captures the kind of sentimentality that is born out of selfless devotion. George (Kathryn Bernardo) represents every doting lover who understands that love is both a struggle and sacrifice. But she's human enough to reach her breaking point, that non-singular moment Primo (Daniel Padilla), her lover, erodes into a miserable man. That's outright promising, given an opportunity to go deep into the characters' core. Until the narrative submits to Star Cinema formula. While Primo tries to win George back, a lot of other things happen, all brazenly pointing to them realizing they need to be back together, even if he decides to set her free--a banal device that aims to make love look elusive but more intense. Because how are these two characters supposed to respond to other charcters whose sole duty is to remind them that they still love each other? The sequences in Amsterdam feel like you're watching a different film, with characters so eager to accomplish something for a great cause. The attempt at proving its significance by way of editorializing the flowers and the sunset does not put weight on either the characters or the narrative itself. Daniel effortlessly delivers, his eyes expressing the right emotions. Kathryn tries hard, a few times she's hitting it. Other times she's like a dainty, vulnerable young girl being forced to battle tough times. Her eyes convey ambiguity rather than perceptive and penetrating responses that don't demand words. Her delivery of ""quotable quotes"" and the lines in the debate scene sounds like a graded recitation (yung mukhang minemorize nang maigi).And then the film gets too didactic, telling us what we should make of how Primo and George triumphed at their story and how we should distinguish battle and war as metaphors for love (kung maka-figure of speech!). The film is supposed to tackle maturity in relationship, but it appears that its depiction does not quite go with its marketing. And Star Cinema is not bothered by such incongruency. It just continues to shape love through a narrative that always turns factitious and simplistic. It does not mind reducing it into the fundamentals of melodrama and simplified association or discourse.",2021-03-02,1,0,watch,False

carlisun,8,The second highest grossing movie of the Philippines of all time is indeed a gem. The Hows of Us is in fact an anti-love story. The movie explores not the best moments in a relationship but sets it’s focus on the moments that were the beginning of the end. The calm vibe and the direct confrontations of the couple make the movie captivating and leave a bitter taste. Bernardo and Padilla act so damn good in this film that I had to check if they indeed broke up in real life. So many emotional moments and the question “Who’s right?” pull the viewer into the story. The rain scene is one of the most legendary moments in Filipino cinema for me. So many emotions with so less words really got me.

raymond_lo,8,"Streaming on Netflix now is this topgrossing 2018 Filipino drama that i somehow liked and shamefully but not secretly enjoyed and bawled my eyes out to. 😃😃 It tells the story of former lovers Primo and George who, at the beginning of the film, relive the days and sad occasions that led to their break-up. For fans of Filipino tearjerkers, a box of tissue may not be enough for this film. It will squeeze you out dry but you will not be complaining. This movie hits all the right formula in the genre. From the beautiful cast to the relatable relationship drama that’s been a staple of Philippine cinema for decades now. The story is somewhat typical but the storytelling is fresh. The conflict is as old as Sharon Cuneta’s first movie (or could be older) but the execution somehow feels novel. There are many cutesy scenes definitely constructed for the diehard fans of the loveteam but it somehow does not offend or get in the way of the developing drama. There is a subplot that will not ordinarily work but somehow works here. Every emotion this movie elicits from the audience is definitely earned. The great character actress Odette Khan appears in a cameo towards the end of the movie that only made me love this film more.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",2022-02-25,1,0,watch,True

What I don't like about it is how unrealistic some of the scenes are, but it's saved by the amazing performance of Kathryn and her co-star Daniel. The chemistry they both have is seen clearly in here. Of course, it wouldn't be a Star Cinema film without the following:1. an emotional scene while raining2. going abroad3. medical issues4. daddy/mommy issues5. cheesy and sometimes even cringy lines that feels unrealistic if said in real life.With all of these in mind, I enjoyed the film because it shows the struggle between the people, and how we should always have each other's back no matter what. "" The story they end up telling is actually pretty simple, but there are just so many other things that crowd out the much more affecting core of this story: two people still clearly in love with each other, just trying to overcome the hurt that also still exists between them.

Contrary sa nakita kong reactions ng fans, di ako agree na problematic si Primo. Oo, idealistic siya at ma-pride. Pero bata pa siya nun. Atsaka tingin ko may pagkukulang din si George. Sa relasyon kasi, dapat may communication. Bigayan kumbaga. Kaso, pareho silang nagsasarili ng hinanakit nila. Pwede naman maayos yan sa masinsinang usapan. Di sinabi ni George yung expectations niya kay Primo at nagtiis nalang siya sa gilid hanggang napuno na siya3. Gusto ko pang makilala si Primo. Parang dito sa movie na to, albeit lovestory siya, mas focused kay George yung kwento. Naging 'pixie dream girl' si Primo. Gusto ko siya. Partly siguro dahil ang charismatic ni Daniel Padilla 😂4. May ibang plot lines and characters na unnecessary at naging plot device lang sila. Gaya nung past romance movie na napanood ko, di na kelangan pumunta sa ibang bansa para gawing nakakakilig yung story. Tbh, parang irrelevant nga sa main story yung Amsterdam plot nila.5. Sobrang rare talaga siguro ng filipino romance (lalo na yung focused sa loveteam) na maging grounded sa reality. May ibang lines sa movie na kung di korni eh unrealistic. Like, wala namang taong nakakaisip agad ng hugot line and take note, yung sobrang madrama pa. Gusto ko lang siguro talaga ng romance story na makatotohanan.

mieuchntle,9,"I’ve watched this film countless times and I just want to watch it again because of the soundtrack number one, the story and because I’m sick and in no mood to watch new movies. Plus I missed this movie because of the trend that’s going around tiktok right now tumawid ka na baby. It reminds me of him in a bittersweet way. Primo the ultimate red flag. I’m quite happy na alam ko sa sarili ko that I would never let this happen to me under any circumstance. It’s just not possible for me be in this situation. First I have a rule I made for myself, that if I want to be in a relationship or to experience relationships it would be during high school. Because I won’t be going to college with a boyfriend. I can’t afford distraction, medicine is already too much I can’t afford to bother with another humans physical and mental health? Plus what do you need a man for? What exactly is their use? You won’t gain anything from, physical touch is 0% on my love language so men would be a 100% hindrance in my case. And don’t start with “makakahanap ka din ng katapat mo” or “bitter, sino nanakit sa ‘yo?” Wala. Tumahimik ka nalang because like men I don’t need an opinion from you about myself. If I’m gonna be honest, I like Primo sa una, he is totally my type, passionate and knows what he wants in life. He’s also smart, musikero plus he’s Daniel Padilla for goodness sake? But my favorite character in this movie would still be Mikko my love the only one who has sense. But kahit ilang beses kong panuorin ‘rong movie na ‘to ‘pag hindi ako maga pause babaha nanaman here sa bahay. I tend to invalidate peoples feelings ‘pag nasabi nila na about sa relationship kung bakit sila depressed. And for all the people feelings whom I invalidate you deserve an apology. I’m so so sorry. My mindset used to be makipag break ka na tapos na lahat ng problema mo I mean for me hindi parin s’ya mahirap but maybe for others it won’t be that easy and I’m slowly opening to that possibility. I’m glad God didn’t give me a friend like George because I only would cry with her because of how much I care about her and I would go to jail because I would accidentally kill Primo. I love Kathryn and Daniel’s acting, I love all their movies omit Barcelona from the list I didn’t appreciate that movie quite as much. I love Can’t help falling in love, she’s dating the gangster of course a classic and this film. This movie has the potential to have my 5 stars and like if it weren’t for Darren Espanto can someone please remove him from the movie. I literally skip every time I see him, his acting was not it. He acts too young for his age in the movie, ‘yung eye sight may problema sa’yo not mentally. I’m so sorry for saying all this but seriously, ang childish? Who made him an actor? He’s a singer not an actor, porket na famous doesn’t mean he has the talent to act, y’all could literally choose anyone tapos he doesn’t look remotely close to the younger version of Yohan, that little kid did it better by the way. He infuriated me more than Primo did all through the movie.Na delete ‘yung other review ko fml. Anyway I just finished the movie and earlier I said I’m so glad that it is impossible for me to experience something like this, but at the end the pain and love of the kiss George and Primo shared made me think what it feels like to fall in love and fall out of love and fall in love all together. I don’t think they ever stopped loving each other but you get my point. I could never experience loving or being loved that hard ever. Anyway, where is the new kathniel film?! The house arrest of us sucks I would rate it a negative if I could. Cringe sobra I feel so bad for the both of them to be forced to do this show.",2022-05-12,0,0,rewatch,False

The first few minutes of the film was okay, a bit realistic, but onwards, it became super cheesy and frustrating. Please, for the love of God, free Kathryn Bernardo from Daniel Padilla and Cathy Garcia Molina (and other mainstream directors). She either greatly overshadows DJ's acting skills or DJ drags her down with his acting (or the lack thereof). She also wouldn't grow as an actress if she just keeps getting the same role with different names. Cathy Molina has done it again with her favorite movie formula: the toxic guy gets in a relationship with the positive strong woman, they break up, guy or girl goes to a different country and then goes back to the Philippines years later, guy woos girl (redemption arc), girl forgives guy, and they live happily ever after.

alvinjames_,8,"“Patience.”This is the moral of the movie. George and Primo showed a realistic relationship. It is not always a romantic one, sometimes it can be sad and heartbreaking. They let each other because they are tired — but letting go each other makes them grow and be the person they want to be. It is a matter of staying through thick and thin, through your darkest days. It is all about the patience we have in love. Sometimes we get tired, but it doesn't mean we don't want anymore. We just get tired, but we can rest.Maybe one of the lines that I can forget is, “we cannot survive to a battle if we fight each other, but staying together can conquer the battle.”This is one of the best Filipino movie I've ever watch, and undeniably the best KathNiel film ever produced.

abigailgzmn,6,"Love the cold open--contemporary and innovative.Primo's a fucking red flag, egocentrically manipulative as ever. But perhaps Tita Lola was the real antagonist here, charot.Galing ng EO product placement.Very cliché, nakaka-cringe, as always with KathNiel films, but it’s their best films I've watched.I was wondering bakit kailangan umuulan pag may strong heartfelt scene between the two of them. I figured it must be symbolism for George's turmoiled feelings toward Primo. Tulips are definitely a symbolism as well for George's ideal partner. Primo gave him a plastic ones when he was courting her.Background music or the musical scoring can be a little excessive in some scenes, but I realized that commercial local films do be like that. Was it necessary to resolve George and her brother's daddy issue? I don't think that was essential, but the film could've been done without the Amsterdam trip. It could've ended with when they already sold the house. The whole Amsterdam trip and there on was like a second act.Overall, despite being cliche, good execution. Deserve naman ang pagiging batikan ni Direk Cathy Garcia-Molina, time-tested na rin. Subok na ng panahon, ganern.George's mistake was falling in love with Primo's potential.Personally, I resonate with George with her territorial and sungit trait; but damn, she's right, she's dumb and weak when it comes to the fucking guy. I WOULDN'T tolerate Primo's comeback if I were her. Pero feel ko binalikan niya lang din out of convenience and because first and only love.

Primo is everything I don't want in a partner. George has very low self-esteem and lacks self-respect. Sacrificing your future and missing your NMAT exam for a prideful but useless man??? PURE IDIOCY. I can't even side nor feel pity for George. I'm so sorry sweet but you brought this upon yourself. I want to hit her in the head at least just once to wake her up from her own stupidity. I didn't even finish this movie. I stopped watching around the 30-minute mark when I was hinted that they'll surely get back together again. I just hate the ""going blind for love"" trope so much. This is a good portrayal of stupid immature young love, though, I'll give them that.

In the middle of the story, I was kind of confused by Primo’s behavior which was still blurry about where will they take their future to? I daresay it’s very related to the lives in the present time, especially for couples who want to bring their relationships to an improved or more serious level.

inhyukks,5,"grabe magmahal si george, handang tumalon ng jeepney at mamiss yung nmat niya para lang sa awoj niyang hindi naman kayang kilalanin mga efforts and sleepless nights niya.the ending felt disappointing, kasi it feels like all of george’s efforts to lock primo out of her life (rightfully so) were thrown out of the window once again just for the sake of the main couple being “endgame” which in and of itself, is a concept that gets pretty annoying when the audience knows that “endgame” is not always the fastest and best solution for every unmended relationship. primo left george after hearing just one complaint from her that she’s tired of always carrying the relationship, let that sink in.nawa’y wag nating tularan si george na kumakapit pa sa isang relasyon na hindi na healthy and maganda sa kaniya, this movie could’ve been greater than it is if primo and george did not end up with each other and chose to grow separately, as individuals.",2023-05-12,0,0,watch,False

Well, art should be a liveable job naman technically, but we all know the reality rn. Still, we all had a little bit of Primo in ourselves believing na what if our passion can be our career at the same time. But mahirap din maging George at Primo. While Primo was chasing his dreams, he forgot that he has a partner to take care of and consider. Si George naman, kakaasikaso at asiste kay Primo, nakalimutan na yung mga sarili niyang pangarap. For me, this is what made the movie realistic.What I didn't like though was the fact na nagkabalikan sila and how they approached it. Para kasing nabura rin kung gaano ka-shitty yung ginawa ni Primo kay George over the course of their relationship. For me, dapat hindi sila nagbalikan talaga. Hence 4 stars.

Its themes of redemption, growth, and forgiveness seems to be lop-sided in parts, and Kathryn Bernardo's George was poorly written—though Kathryn gave an ecstatic performance. Daniel Padilla as Primo, on the other hand, also gave enough nuance to make his character charming, and surprisingly earnest.

josephweirdness,6,"Strictly speaking, probably the best of the Kathniel movies. The one where both put in their most rounded performances, both charming and weighty when necessary. Beyond that, they're supported by much better material than in any of their other films. So much feels authentic and even the silliness of the core concept (dividing a house in half out of spite) feels grounded in a strong emotional reality that it passes by without much resistance from myself. There's also just a lot of interesting visual ideas going on here. Not all of them land perfectly, but I find myself appreciating all of them. In all her best work, Cathy Garcia-Molina has this very strong eye for divisions and framing and how that relates to the characters on screen. Obviously the divided house concept gives her a lot of chance to play with these ideas and generally speaking, they work to the film's benefit more than they detract.Where the film suffers is where it has to bow to the studio tentpole formula. Lengthy travel sequences get included in films like this as a means for the intended audience to live vicariously through the characters. Can't afford to go to The Netherlands? You can at least watch your favorite romcom team go instead. The Netherlands is a beautiful country but the entire subplot around Kathryn's brother and long lost father is just bloat that detracts from the heart of the movie. If this film had simply been contented being a romantic comedy (leaning towards drama), it might have been great. The addition of the family drama weighs it down dreadfully.That being said, it's a good movie. Too much of it works and those first two acts are some of the best I've seen from Filipino mainstream studio films. The crown jewel of the Kathniel canon, yet to be topped.",2023-09-15,0,0,rewatch,True

notkaterin,9,"darren and his subplot ruined itfirst half of the film >>> because the second half (the amsterdam arc, specifically) seemed like a different movie.if the amsterdam arc focused more on primo's side (as the film was told from george's point-of-view), rather than the search for george and yohan's father (darren's subplot), the film would be much better and the ending could be ‘more justified.’the only part of that arc that i like is the flower field scene. seeing the tulips was primo's and george's dream together. but things didn't go as planned. same as with life, you don't always get what you wished for but life will always find a way to give you something better or in their case, they became better persons despite the fact that they were unable to reach their dreams together as they had planned.speaking of the flower field scene, i truly wish they had given primo's side equal attention. i believe many viewers failed to notice his depression and suicidal phase. of course, it won't excuse him for what he did, but at least it shows that he didn't do it just because he wants to.overall, thou has lots of iconic lines that became part of philippine pop culture. also one of kathniel's best acting performances—daniel's quiet moments (internal) and kathryn's intense dialogues (external). if not for darren's irrelevant subplot, this will dethrone ‘she's dating the gangster’ as my favorite kathniel film. one of the highest grossing filipino films of all time, without a doubt.“Palibhasa kasi alam na alam mo kung paano ako kunin e. Isang ngiti, isang kanta, isang yakap, isang sorry, wala... Umiikot na ulit ‘yong mundo ko. Tangina, Primo! Matalino akong tao e.

jm_trece,8,"Heartbroken…just heartbroken. I hope the break-up news isn’t true. I truly hope this wasn’t their last movie together. Kathniel movies are the reason I went back to school to pursue film. Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla are inspirations to me. These movies mean so much to me. This couple means the world to me. I’ve been beyond devastated after hearing the heavy rumors of the break-up and it really seems to be true. My heart seriously aches so much…I cannot take it. 💔With the new drama surrounding Kathniel, it can be said that “The Hows of Us” is a reflection of real life. Growing apart…making mistakes…the difficulty to forgive in adulthood…too many factors that limit our happiness…too many factors that change the way we love. 😭😭😭The first time I watched this a couple of years ago, I was sobbing at the end of the movie. I was already a huge Kathniel fan before I watched this one, so that ending struck me so hard. Overall, the drama, cinematography and music meshes well together. I believe this is seriously a really beautiful film. I love this movie so much. I love Kathniel so much. 😭😭😭I will always love Kathniel. As much as I would hope that they aren’t broken up, it’s not up to me to decide what’s best for them. They have helped me get through rough times. I believed in true love because of them. Sometimes, even the best relationships grow apart. Thank you Kathryn Bernardo. Thank you Daniel Padilla. Thank you for being the greatest love team of all time. I will always have a place in my heart for Kathniel. ❤️#KathnielForever",2023-11-28,2,0,watch,True

I remember when i watched this movie for the first time, i fell in love with them both. i mean, i could easly think that they are couple in real life. Their chemistry is insane, everyone can see it. 11 years and now means nothing? how could this movie becomes real? i watching it again today and i cried so hard. it hits different now, especially when this line comes ""how did you not find a reason to stay?"" it stabbed me to the deepest heart.can you imagine? 11 years they survive, and now they met the final chapter. Dj if you really did cheating my kath. youre nothing but an ashole. TAPI KEK ANJIRLAH KNP BARU SKRG SIH BERULAHNYA?!?!?! UDH 11 TAHUN ANJIR, MASA' BOSEN PASTI UDH DILALUIN.

Kath makes dj becomes her safe place and comfort zone. 11 tahun dan itu udh jd kebiasaan mereka sehari-hari.

cess_kinoc,6,"Baka naaawa lang ako kay Kathryn ngayon kasi look at the date diba... Pero tbh binuhat nila silang lahat, kahit yung wig ni Daniel.Noong nakita ko ito nung 2018, over yung acting niya for me. Sa ikalawang panunuod, may mga mahahalagang performances si Kathryn dito. Mistulang siya ang nakaintindi sa paghihirap at ang naaangkop na kalakasan ni George upang makamit nya ang maayos na buhay.Naway ito na sana ang wakas ng pagdusa ng isang storya, ng pagbuo ng karakter sa pinoy romcoms, para lang mapunan ang negosyo ng love teams.Mas mahusay rin sana ang maiaambag sa kamalayan kung hindi na nagkatuluyan pa si Primo at George. Kay tagal rin niyang nagdusa sa makasariling pag-iisip ni Primo. Naway maging mas malaya pa ang mga ganitong kwento, hindi nahahanay sa ""Prince Charming"" si Maria Clara.Ang sabi ni George, pagod na sya sa grand gestures. Pagod na syang itigil yung mundo niya para kay Primo. Pero sa dulo, malalaking gestures nanaman, may pa-kanta kanta pa. Siyempre isasama niyo siya sa Amsterdam dahil siya nagbayad ng plane tickets. Walang respeto sa hiling ni George na lumayo na siya sa buhay niya. Dahil dito hindi nagsucceed ang pelikula.",2023-11-30,0,0,watch,False

lovejiyan,7,"no matter how many times i’ve watched this film, it never fails to make me cry (and inis at the same time!) > : )when i first watched this film, i was happy that they got back together in the end. i used to be a sucker for second chance tropes, so i was really hoping for them to be with each other again. but after rewatching it with all the knowledge i have today, i’ve had a lot of realizations about this film.primo’s actions to win her back (all the singing of umuwi ka na baby and bare minimum shits) & the letter he wrote do not validate every single thing that he made george feel. not all relationships deserve a comeback. no man is ever worth sacrificing your dream for. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM. of course at first, your heart will ache with their absence. there will still be times that it will still hurt, but i swear, it gets better! it is healthier and happier to grow alone instead of staying yourself in a relationship that drains you.love is also about acceptance and letting go. choosing yourself over staying with someone who drags you down is the best form of love that you can give yourself !# shungekz mo talaga, jo !!!!!!",2023-12-30,0,0,rewatch,False

punanicega,,"Star Cinema have to stop producing repetitive and mediocre storyline for a romantic-drama/comedy film while using famous love teams to extract money from the audience especially to avid Kathniel fans. first, there are so many side stories such as the medical problem and the daddy issue which i find it unnecessary. i also want to point out the longingness of Darren to his father does not break the social construct of a traditional family and his acting makes it even annoying. second, the part where they go abroad seems forced, just to say that the movie is set in Amsterdam. it is irrelevant and a waste of production's money especially they can use provincial places in our country. third, the friends of Kathryn and Daniel are trying hard to be funny and have no significance to the character development of the protagonists even if Juan Miguel's role makes sense. fourth, the dialogues are too cheesy and have so many ""hugot lines"". fifth, the moral story of this film only taught audiences to be hopless romantic and to endure toxicity in order to save the relationship. the only breakthrough somehow is the absence of third party in the relationship. as well, Kathryn is too good as an actress to play another fragile female character.P.S.pangalawang beses ko na itong napanood at ganun pa rin, inis na inis pa rin talaga sa pekikulang ito. hindi na ulit ako mag-aaksaya ng dalawang oras para dito. mas pipiliin ko na lang ulit panoorin ang SDTG o HLG.",2024-01-08,0,0,rewatch,False

lerryjohnofcl,8,"Since the breakup of power couple Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla, it seems like the best thing to do is to have a bittersweet marathon of all their films together. Although the teen romance genre is not typically not my cup of tea, the wife and I was able to watch at least one Kathniel film - which turned out to be their last - The Hows of Us (2018). Directed by the go-to filmmaker when it comes to romantic drama blockbusters, Cathy Garcia-Molina crafted something truly special that would resonate more to the love team's followers five years later.The film revolves around the central characters, George (Kathryn Bernardo) and Primo (Daniel Padilla), a couple whose relationship undergoes a tumultuous journey. The narrative ingeniously navigates through the highs and lows of their love story, exploring themes of commitment, dreams, and the inevitable challenges that life throws at them. The storytelling is compelling, keeping the audience engaged with a mix of heartwarming moments and gut-wrenching conflicts.By letting Bernardo and Padilla portray layered and maturing characters, this project breaks the conventional boundaries of the love team which became widely popular through their numerous rom-com TV serials. The commitment of the two young actors make this work as the story revolves around their truly relatable character arcs. Although the supporting cast could also use deeper exploration, the couple's natural chemistry is the beating heart of this film.It may have leaned more towards traditional romantic comedy/drama elements, but the film's success lies in its passionate execution, especially in terms of narrative exploration and character depth. The actors' real-life love story may have ended, but this film shall remain as a highlight of PH cinema.4.0 OUT OF 5⭐⭐⭐⭐📃STORY - 0.8🎥EXECUTION - 0.8👥CHARACTERIZATION - 0.8🍿ENTERTAINMENT VALUE - 0.8✨LASTING IMPACT - 0.8",2023-12-08,0,0,watch,False

piattos,8,"*incoming word vomit, i will not reread this to check it the things i say make sense fjsdhfd*I watched this with a loud as-it-happens commentary on the decisions the characters make and I find myself acting like how people usually would advice their friends when they're with a /useless/ partner. I'd say ""LEAVE HIM!"" or ""He isn't worth it!!!"" or ""There are other fish in the sea!!! Better fish!!""But I found myself silently relating a bit too much to Primo as I watched. I know how comforting it is that you know that there's someone rooting for you in what you feel are your darkest times. The only difference is that I live alone, therefore there was no one to see me when my 'functional' mask is off. In a way, it's good to not reveal that to anyone. But at the same, it may have been helpful to have someone like Jo around. (anyway, therapy helps!! you dont need a jowa to save you from yourself HAHA)My favorite part was when Jo opened up about how she felt about their breakup. The choice the scriptwriters made to have Jo angry at the fact that Primo left, rather than the fact that we was a piece of shit on the days leading to their breakup made it clear that she really was rooting for him. That her love for Primo was rooted in something deeper than the idea of what he could offer her. She was simply disappointed that he gave up on what they had when she started to break down as well. I definitely feel like their breakup was necessary. At that point, Jo's hope was the singular thread keeping that relationship intact, and hope can only take so much. So when it wasn't strong, the relationship had to unravel. And it was good that they both grew despite being apart.Did she have to go back to Primo? I don't know. If she didn't, i think it'll go to a ""Past Lives"" type of scenario when they meet each other again in the far far future, except with more contempt.On the subject of passion vs. practicality. I wish I knew the answer. I always always want people to choose passion. But I can't relate because I don't have passion. I simply have a drive to survive. So I go for practicality. But if I had passion like Primo, I understand why he acted the way he did. I always imagine that it must be nice to want something so strongly.Overall, I liked this movie.
