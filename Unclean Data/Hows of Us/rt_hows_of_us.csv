Audience,Audience,On a Tuesday night where I can't go to sleep because it has been quite a day- I went to the Filipino channel and found this movie. I love romcoms with a happy outcome and this one suited me perfect. The love story is elevated above the usual plot although it relies on misunderstandings and withholding information to protect the other. The entire story pivots on a house as a base as an anchor for their love- yet the house provides a way to work out their conflict. I like it. The direction towards the end sort of pushes the audience to a different outlook but as delightful romcoms go- it will please the audience with a sigh- a good sigh and tears will flow. Shhhh- don't tell my wife I'm a softy.,Don L,09/26/2024,4.0/5,all-audience
Audience,Audience,"very flawed, there are obvious problems like the pacing shifts a little bit at the end, few moments where you just think to yourself ""what tf is happening"" and few scenes that i think DID NOT have to be in the movie. but i would still recommend ppl to watch this bcz its in the better side of filipino movies.",mannn n,06/22/2023,3.5/5,all-audience
