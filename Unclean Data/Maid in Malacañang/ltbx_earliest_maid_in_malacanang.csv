totallynotrae,10,"Rewatched for the first time since seeing it in the cinemas in 2022. I don't support anything that happened during the Marcos regime, however, I enjoyed the movie then, even now because it was meant to show the helpers/maids who worked in the palace during the People's Revolution. Personally, I grew up always having helpers/yayas and I have tremendous respect for them, and what they do for me and my family. I’ve had helpers who have seen me grow up, took care of me as a child, and some even took part in raising me instead of doing all that for their own children. In the movie, you could see the amount of loyalty the helpers had towards the family, and that’s something that I definitely see every single day with mine. Sometimes, I just think how lucky and how blessed I am to be on the receiving end of things, because they don’t just choose to be a nanny, most times they don't really have a choice, they have to work to send their children to school, put a roof over their families heads, or to just put food on the table and make ends meet. In return, it takes significant moments away from their lives, they take care of somebody else’s kid rather than their own, they take care of somebody else’s mother or father instead of their own. Spending time that can never be given back on making someone’s life easier. Even on the hardest days, they have no choice but to keep going. When theres nothing else they can do but obey what they are being told to do. Even after all of that, they still have a smile on their face, they still do their job to the best of their ability, and for that I will always be grateful. 💌(ly ate ann and ate jean 🥺)",2025-11-23,0,0,watch,True

forgineo,1,"Took me three years to watch this and I would be objective on this:1. Marred by uneven writing. There are times that they would inject humor when in just one scene Imee was paranoid. 2. More tell than actually showing the narrative. Each chapter has its own introduction. 3. Audio has its problems and in the first scene at the Palace, it seems that Christine has the mic alone. 4. Undefined genre, it becomes a comedy, then drama and at one point, horror. There was a point that it becomes a documentary. I guess, Darryl, pick a narrative style. 5. Production-wise, I will be nitpicking this. Instead of using the images of Cesar and Ruffa, they used FM and IM’s images instead. I need consistency because Cesar doesn’t look as much as FM. 6. Most of the time, they used the One-shot technique and engaging narrative but it was flat. 7. We don’t see much of the maids in Malacañang. I guess we have to change this to The Marcoses in Malacañang.",2025-03-25,0,0,watch,False

Kaso hindi, ano rin bang ineexpect ko sa walang hiyang direktor na 'to, pinapalabas na para bang taumbayan pa ang masama, na parang hindi inalipin ng kanilang pamilya ang Pilipinas nang mahigit dalawampu't taon (at sa ngayo'y patuloy pa rin), minaliit ang rebolusyon bilang isang pulitikal na agenda ng mga Aquino, at hindi bilang isang makamasang kilusan na nagpabagsak ng diktadurya. Nakakatakot lang talaga yung huling chapter, kasi sa bawat isang makakakita sa katarantaduhang pinapalabas nito, may limang mauuto at maniniwala sa 'totoong kasaysayang' pinaparatang ni Yap, ng mga Marcos, ng mga bumubura at bumabaluktot sa ating kasaysayan - madaling makita ang appeal nito sa masa, napakadaling ipalimot at mabago ang ating pananaw sa pamilya ng isang diktador.Ang pinakamasahol pa ay, ordinaryong mamamayan pa ang ginamit (ang mga kasambahay at PSC) para sa pagpapalaganap ng propagandang Marcos - para lamang sabihing si Imee pala yung ""Maid in Malacanang"" (no fucking way they did this). Hanggang ngayon, ginagamit at inaabuso pa rin ng parehong Marcos at Duterte ang taumbayan para sa sari-sariling pulitikal na layunin.Iniisip ko bago 'to panoorin na ""Baka bawi naman 'to sa visuals at technical aspects"" kaso hindi, ang gimmicky ng long takes, inconsistent yung audio, hindi maayos yung pagpalit from comedy (na hindi rin naman nakakatawa) to drama, ang uncomfortable ng blockings, at ang artificial ng acting ng lahat ng gumanap, high school play lang ang peg.Kahit ganito, naging matagumpay ang pelikula sa nais nitong gawin: hugasan ang pangalan at krimen ng mga Marcos, napa-upo ba naman si Bonget sa palasyo. Pero kahit anong pagbaluktot ang gawin nila sa kasaysayan, kitang kita ngayong ika-39 anibersaryo ng EDSA na tayo pa rin ang may hawak ng kasaysayan, hangga't may hindi nakakalimot, hindi ito mabubura o mapapalitan.1/2 star para sa Traydor na Pag-Ibig ni Marion Aunor, ang ganda ng kanta, pero bakit naman dito ka napunta.Putangina mo Darryl Yap, putangina ng mga Marcos, at putangina ng mga DuterteNever Again, Never Forget!",2025-02-25,3,0,watch,False

Gagi lahat ba naman ng iyakan pinepraise sina FEM and Imelda sa lahat ng mga ""mabuting"" nagawa daw nila. Not to mention rin how every single time the Filipino people are mentioned we are villainized just because we are fighting for the oppressed. “Hindi ko kayang labanin ang mga Pilipino”Tangina imaginin mo presidente ka tas gusto mo labanin directly mga citizens mo without even understanding why?Lumalaban daw tayo sa mga kabutihan na ginawa ng mga Marcos and malicious intent lang lahat para sirain ang pangalan nila. Eh the entire premise/the reason why we’re fighting is going over their heads. FEM saying that the revolution for the Filipino people starts when they leave the country to flee for their safety taints what it truly means to hold a revolution to fight for one’s rights.Wala, I hate this. Halatang pang brainwash with so many unnecessary emotional dialogue to get us to sympathize with them through the experiences of real life characters (the maids). The humor is so forced and out of place too. At ang pinakanakakainis is the ending scene- they really tried to be that deep huh 💀Ang dystopian rin ng dating eh, a scene highlighting all of Imelda’s shoes and dresses tas the entire palace being so fancy. Do you really want to defend rich people who stole from the government and everyone’s damn taxes? Galing sa perang bayan lahat ng mga sapatos at damit na yan eh. Nakakaputangina, just because they gave their workers the bare minimum kailangan ba talaga sila sambahin ng ganyan?

lhyemarp,2,"+ Let's start with the few positives. How this film looks is amazing. Though, for most of the time, people are just standing and exchanging dialogues, the colors of this film really feels like a step-up, relative to Filipino comedies and teleseryes. Also, I guess I liked how it utilized old news footages. And, that's pretty much it.+ Anyways, leaving all politics aside (even though it's hard to do so), if we are going to just view this on the technicality of film making and writing, it's bad. The writing, sound design, and score are overly dramatic clichés you would expect from a family drama, a low-brow comedy, and from a historical and political biopic. Though I appreciate the long takes as it really let's the drama feel natural, however, it also exposes just aforementioned poor writing because it's dialogue that serves nothing to progress the story other than sending their propaganda. + But truly, one cannot really discuss how this film is written without acknowledging the context of which it arose from. If we really dissect the film, it will not stop bleeding ""Marcos Apologist"" and historical revisionism. It is also troubling how the film really conveniently is not interested in truly discussing the politics with enough rigor and discipline. It really overly simplifies the entire EDSA People Power to just a dangerous riot orchestrated by power hungry politicians. It leaves out all the complexity of the political climate, as well as all the money laundering which sparked the entire social crisis. Not to mention the violences inflicted during the Martial Law. There really is the sense that Daryll Yap, the director and writer, was only really interested in telling one minute moment of this dark but important part of Philippine history. And he did not even discipline himself enough to not fall prey to self-indulgence. He really wrote it as if its a novel which ironically, made all of the actors in this film feel like they are overacting. + What is also troubling is how it did not even shy away from truly depicting the regal and glamorous life of the Marcos' in Malacañang. From the number of loyal maids, every wall plastered with life size portraits, easy international travels, among others. And with that kind of glamorous mise en scene, the audacity of this film to mention that the Marcos are not elitists, and that it's the reason for the hate they get. + Christine Reyes, portraying a younger Sen. Imee Marcos, who happens to be a creative and executive producer of this film, had the highest screen time with acting that knows only to scream frantically. It really is interesting that the senator allowed herself to be depicted and written like this, a controlling paranoid daughter flustered by their family's downfall. And how they revealed she is the Maid in Malacañang? Wow. + And let me just point out how blasphemous this film can get sometimes. Other than the regal mise en scene that competes with churches and their number of Christian iconographies. The scene where President Marcos scolds his son, Bongbong Marcos, the camera gradually and steadily circles around the two as they exchange their dramatic dialogue. The scene is honestly one that I can appreciate because of how it chose to keep this camera circling them technique continue on one long take. But during this long take, there are a handful of moments when the ceiling lights goes behind the President's head resembles a saint with a halo. It's a small nitpick but, dear Jesus, this film really wants to be on the Marcos' good side. + Another nitpick I want to highlight is how in the scene where Bongbong and Imelda Marcos are talking, they seem to have overestimated the Philippine government after the Dictatorship, stating once they leave, the people of the Philippines would do everything not to let them come back. It does make the audience wonder, and potentially realize the failures of the republic that came after. But what bothers me is this will only paint the democratic and liberal ideas, that should govern us, with yellow And because of it, the discourse of political awareness goes down as just another color contest. And that ""IRM 2022"" just screams corny.+ There's no substance to this film other than the blatant propagandist nature of it. I recommend watching, not to support this types of film, but to persecute it.",2023-10-01,0,0,watch,False

windiermegatons,1,"Nakakahiya lang…Looking for a movie to assist with Tagalog exposure, I thought this one might stand out amid what looked mostly like a sea of lukewarm romantic comedies. As it happens, this was substantially worse than I could possibly have feared about the others. You know you’re in trouble right from the jump when Imee Marcos is listed as both a creative and executive producer and then turns out to be the main character of the film. I suppose you can’t blame the Marcos clan for trying to further whitewash history now that they’ve fully completed their comeback with the ascension of Bongbong to the presidency a month before this was released, but I almost wonder why they even bothered when the attempt was so dire. This movie is two hours long and it could have cut down to about 20 minutes total - most of the runtime is occupied by interminable scenes of characters saying anything and everything they’re thinking, none of which would be particularly interesting even if most of it weren’t focused on the thesis that Ferdinand Marcos was not an oppressive dictator but rather a Great Man who Loved His People, Actually. Even by Filipino movie standards the overacting is intense - virtually every member of the main cast gets at least one showpiece to absolutely devour the scenery. The actress playing Imee screams so much she must have needed a lozenge by the end of filming (how this was intended as a flattering portrait of a producer of the film I have no idea, but I guess she is referred to as a “genius” multiple times).This reminded me of nothing so much as the kind of thing that might be dumped out by American *cough* “auteur” Dinesh D’Souza. It evinces absolutely zero talent on the part of anyone involved - the acting stinks, the writing would stink even if the message weren’t horrendous, the tone lurches wildly between melodrama and slapstick for no apparent reason, and the long takes (with their constantly moving camera) are insanely tedious. Paul Thomas Anderson this ain’t. But you actually have to appreciate how badly this is made - if this were a better movie, it might actually have some hope of convincing people of what it’s trying to do. But it’s such a mess it’s hard to imagine anyone getting all the way through unless they’re already enormous Marcos fans or absolute gluttons for punishment like me. For anyone else, don’t waste your time, and I do mean waste. There are easier ways to learn Tagalog than trying to sit through this joke.",2023-07-12,0,0,watch,False

rell_,,"Ang cinema ay audio-visual medium. Pwedeng panoorin tong MiM nang nakapikit dahil lahat ng information ay nasa dialogue na. Mas gumawa ang produksyon ni Daryll Yap ng radio drama kaysa pelikula. Yung pabibong one-shot unang tatlong chapter e hindi rin naman nakakamangha dahil wala namang action. Astig ang one-shot sa mga zombie movie o war movie dahil sa continuous orchestrated action. Pero kung puro lang naman dada ang gagawin e balewala din. Mas awtobiograpikal ito kaysa politikal. Memoir to ni Imee Marcos (the best maid in malacanang - FM). Siya ang producer e. Yung mga tunay na kasambahay sa malacanang noon ay halos narrator lang dito. Ni wala nga sila sa poster. Si Marcos Sr., sa persona niya during his times, e eloquent at strong man. Dito sa pelikula, binaliktad. Siya lang yung hindi matatas magsalita kung tutuusin. Paulit-ulit na nakakairita na naghahabol ng mga salita. Lalo na doon sa eksenang pinagagalitan niya si Bongbong. Tina-try gawing tao si Marcos Sr. PInakikita kuno yung malambot na side nila, yung hindi inihaharap sa publiko. Ganoon din si Imelda, at si Bongbong na may oedipus complex pa ata. At yung Irene ba yun. Mukhang tatakbo si Imee Marcos sa susunod na eleksyon dahil strongwoman siya ng pelikula, pinapabango ang sarili. Bilang propaganda palyado din ito. Dahil magagalit, matatawa, o aantukin lang nang husto ang mga ""oposisyon"". NI-re-reinforce lang nito ang parasocial relationship sa pamilya marcos ng mga loyalista.

jayrlovesmovies,1,"There is so much to dislike about Maid in Malacañang that there is not even one redeeming value in this blatant propaganda movie.The cast performance, which I thought would be the best (and only) part of the movie, ended up being disastrous. Not only they are terribly miscast, but they also don't sound like the Marcos family at all. Even if Christine Reyes had the ""best"" acting in this movie, it does not say much when she doesn't even look like Imee Marcos and the dialogue is terribly written. All of the budget to make them look accurate to the Marcoses went to Ruffa Guitterez's wig as Imelda and the filmmakers are lazily relying on the viewers to identify which one is who in the Marcos family. The cinematography is also not good. The use of pseudo ""one-take"" shot framing using the square aspect ratio to highlight the film's time period just makes this film so ugly and ingenuine. It's like I am watching a poorly-edited Lana Del Rey music video.The Vincentiments humor in some of the scenes is just terrible and very out-of-place for a period film like this. This is what you get for a film written by someone whose previous background in filmmaking was tacky sex comedies.Perhaps the most offensive part of this film is that it attempts to put the entire family in a positive light as if they are not held responsible for the things that took place during Martial Law. To justify their lapses, the film instead presents the Marcoses as genuinely good people who happen to be naive and absent-minded about the people who betrayed them and Imee (who is the film's main POV and the real-life senator is also a producer of the movie) happens to be the only smart one in the family. I just cannot fantom how people fall for this obvious lie, yet their supporters will take them as facts on the surface.It's so annoying how films like Maid in Malacañang, as well as its counter-programming film Katips, only aim to fuel our culture war here in the Philippines. Both of these films are only made to strengthen the confirmation bias of their target audience, forcing them to accept whatever they presented as facts instead of asking the audience to ponder the message they want to tell.Among all of the bad-to-mediocre Martial Law and post-ML era films made since President Bongbong Marcos became president, this is the worst one of the bunch.

bromine_minari,1,"A gross spectacle in hindsight, one that embraces and glorifies every single form of manipulative and almost fascistic appeal from the characters. It's rather devoid of any sort of emotion and dipped into an endless pit of constant egotism by Darryl Yap that it's embarrassing to look at. When we are introduced to Marcos family, the first thing they with the large and spacious hallways of their palace, filled to the brim with gold, maids, and a polish mansion with never a single flaw in hindsight. When we are then introduced to the protesters, it's through low-angle shots, a filter of uneducated and poor peasants that almost sees them as derogatory of any kind. A film both ville and technically incompetent in direction. You can compare this to films such as Birth of a Nation or Triumph of Will, but at least those two films have clear reason and direction on why they exist a propaganda. In Maid In Manacalang, everything is so convoluted that it almost feels like a parody on Facebook rather than something to take seriously with. This film isn't even about any maids, and they probably just served as a light cover-up with the marketing. I hope Luis Bunuel comes back from the dead to make Darryl Yap live the events of ""Un Chien Adalou""",2023-03-06,5,0,rewatch,False
hanautasancho,1,"Historically distorted films have marred history for decades now. Certain movies like Argo, Braveheart, Pocahontas, and Patton had their fair share of twisting history in exchange for spectacle. Even movie juggernauts like Lawrence of Arabia or Titanic have been lambasted because they portray actual events. The difference between those films and this is that they have been created with cinematic accuracies that provide enjoyment to the audience.In the eyes of the filmmakers, what matters most is if the movie generates income, even if it's executed poorly story-wise and technicality-wise.Maid in Malacañang, despite its well-divided 10-chapter plot, is a mixture of unnecessary inconsistencies shown in a very cheap spectacle style. Inconsistent shots that tried to execute long takes, like in 1917 or Birdman, but the character blockings and setup make it more annoying than pleasing. Cheap sets used to represent the Malacañan Palace (The grandest mansion in the Philippines) looked like a huge village home full of creaks and poor paints. Mixing in 21st Century Gen-z dialogues to add humor that doesn't work well. And line delivery seemed like the actors tried to portray their roles because they were asked to and did not practice well.But I got to say, it takes a lot of heart and brains to really watch this one.Because to me, who has watched a good chunk of films, especially award-winning ones, made this film more annoying than enjoyable even if you don't bother comparing it to actual history. I know we are not always gunning for our movies to be ""world-class"" because filmmaking is still a business, and sales are more important because it generates money. Maid in Malacañang is definitely a tad below the low-class filmmaking because the whole movie felt like it was done in a rush, like a school project. Yet, it was still watched by a lot of people.I am wondering, have our standards on how we watch films gotten really low?",2023-03-06,0,0,watch,False

filmcirclerjct,1,"Fresh from the success of winning the Philippines' 2022 Presidential elections through their endless propaganda and trolling, Darryl Yap brings us his latest pessimus opus: the fictionalized retelling of the end of Marcos family's dictatorship, focusing on their last three days in Malacañang Palace before their exile in Hawaii following the People Power Revolution in 1986.In the film, Cristine Reyes play the fictionalized version of Imee Marcos, who returns to the Philippines after she is summoned by his father, a fictional, mild-mannered version of Ferdinand Marcos (played by Cesar Montano). Upon returning to the film's cheap-looking version of Malacanang, the fictional version of Imee Marcos learns about a failed assassination plot against their family. All throughout the film's excessively long running time, the fictional version of the Marcos family face betrayal of several high-ranking officials, including several Palace staff, food shortages, plus fear and anxiety from the growing number of the ""mindless"" crowds joining the EDSA revolution. After ten excruciating chapters and 105 wasted minutes, the family, upon the persuasion of the fictional version of Imee, decides to leave the Palace, with the help of m0therfvcking senator Robin Padilla as Gen. Fabian Ver, the Chief of Staff of the AFP under the Marcos Administration. The film ends with people storming the Palace, looting and destroying its premises.Penned and directed by Yap, with the real Imee Marcos serving as the film's creative producer, this propaganda film is actually not the worst Filipino film of 2022 for me (that recognition still belongs to the Claudine Barretto revenge drama ""Deception""). But this is definitely the most boring local film from last year. The film opens with a text saying the following: "" Ang pelikulang ito ay naglalaman ng mga tunay na kaganapan, sa gitna ng kasaysayan, sa gilid ng kaguluhan, sa likod ng media, na ngayo'y ihaharap sa Bayan."" Early on, it already conditions the viewers' minds that what they're about to see is based on a true story. It even used real life footage and clips from the time of the EDSA revolution to make it feel more ""real."" There's even a voice-over, claiming that Cory Aquino herself was advocating for the public's civil disobedience. We all know how it's going to end, with Marcoses as mere victims of fate and tragedy. Nothing is surprisng anymore. In short, their version of the truth, so it's predictable from the get-go. Kuwento niyo yan, eh.On top of this, the forced comedy makes it even more painful to watch. Can you imagine, the actual ""maids"" in the movie are the ones that make it more cringy, acting like some chorus and providing comic relief (which all failed). Karla Estrada and Beverly Sarmiento in particular, are both excruciating to watch and listen to. It feels more like a series of Vincentiments skit with bigger names, stitched together to form a film. It also looks like one. It's cheap. It's boring. It's always loud (lots of shouting, as usual). It's very dependent on stirring controversy. Very Darryl Yap.Right from its early scenes, the film's main focus is on the fictionalized version Imee Marcos, making it feel like she's the hero of the story. It's actually pretty confusing, because I remember the real Imee Marcos saying before that she was ""too young"" when she heard about Martial Law, but here, she's portrayed as a full-grown, fierce and intelligent woman, which we all know are all made up, just like her claim that she is ""one of the first female graduates from an Ivy League School -- Princeton University, graduating with honors.""And as expected, it paints Ferdinand Marcos as a naive and innocent victim who trusted the wrong people, and the entire family as sad victims. Boohoo. ""Palagi lang mabait! Yan, yan yung ginamit nila para mapagbagsak ka. Sobrang tiwala mo sa kanila,"" said the fictional version of Imee. They did get one detail right though: that young Bong-bong is a party animal, as proven by their massive private video collection obtained by the media, including the infamous ""We Are The World"" video during his birthday celebration on board the presidential yacht Ang Pangulo.To make matters worse, all the scenes lack tension. They all feel dull, despite how loud the characters shout their lines. The only thing that adds emotions to its scenes is its manipulative and overbearing music. The cinematography employs long shots which, instead of giving the film an authentic feel, makes it look more boring. The performances only add up to the film's blandness, like Ruffa Gutierrez's performance, who looks like she doesn't know any other facial expressions. She's like Jennifer Coolidge, but in a very bad way. You don't know whether she's about to laugh, about to cry, or she's just constipated. The only good decision that this film had is having Cristine Reyes playing the improved, cinematic version of Imee.It's packed with lies after lies, that it is so hard to keep track.""Galit na galit sila dahil hindi tayo nanggaling sa elitistang angkan. Galit na galit sila dahil probinsyano lang tayo. Galit na galit sila dahil mahal tayo ng mga tao. Pero hindi ko magawang magalit sa kanila,"" says the sadboi ex-President in the movie. And I'm not even going to dig further in that scene featuring Giselle Sanchez's portrayal of Cory Aquino playing mahjong with nuns, which has been debunked by the Carmelite sisters themselves.Long, loud, lame and lifeless, this fictionalized, propagandist film from Viva Films and Darryl Yap is nothing more than a disgusting attempt to whitewash the crimes and atrocities under the Marcos dictatorship, and to suck-up to the current administration.The design is very Darryl Yap.",2023-03-01,0,0,watch,False

davoarid,3,"Finally got to see the year's most controversial film! (Currently ranks as the 3rd highest grossing Filipino film* of all-time...as well as the fourth lowest rated film on all of Letterboxd right now.)I think Yap is just too stupid and lazy for this film to be *truly* offensive; as it is, it just plays out as the sort of propaganda whose only goal is to preach to the converted. The Marcoses are depicted as paragons of virtue, unfairly maligned by the ignorant (and jealous) activists/media who've always despised them. There's never any mention as to WHY these activists are so angry--no menton of the thousands of victims of the dictatorship. No, Ferdinand Marcos's only crime (according to this) is that he loved his country too much.I'd like to be charitable--one could defend this by saying that, since this film is only from the perspective of the Marcoses and their staff, that of course the result will be hero-worship...that in fact, he's making a critical view of him by showing how brainwashed his inner circle was....except Yap can't even do that, as he inserts newsreel footage and chapter headings that all promise he's showing us ""the TRUE story"" of the PPP. And the ending--Cory Aquino's lone appearance, gambling with nuns and heartlessly ordering the Marcos's exile--completely scraps that possibility (as it depicts Aquino as a monster, and it's also a scene no one in the Marcos family witnesses--it's all Yap.)That said: on a formal level, the film is really interesting. The average shot length is about 3 minutes each, and they're not lazy stationary ones; Yap will start a scene outside the palace, then go indoors, up the stairs, into different rooms, with dialogue from multiple actors, all without a cut. I don't quite know why he's doing that, but it's a really neat touch, as most of the film is comprised of conversations, and I'm always a sucker for shooting those at a distance with shots as long as possible--it's the best way to capture performance, imo. And the odd music cues (it starts with an 80s dance version of an OPM classic ""Nosi Balasi""), random interjections of humor (from the maids), and odd bookends of scenes (a maid ends her Big Speech to the palace staff by asking one for a candy bar), it's all very interesting...yet totally at odds with the rest of the film which is blunt and brutal.*That’s what Wikipedia says, but I’ve learned that the box office figures for this were almost certainly inflated artificially.",2023-02-14,5,0,watch,False

chuzen,6,"as with all things in life, one must take this film with a grain of salt - obviously you have to when imee marcos is a producer - and they absolutely are trying to whitewash the marcos family, even romanticize them. thus, the way to view this film is as a window to how delusional the marcoses and their supporters are. in this way, it becomes a fascinating and at times hilarious watch (often unintentionally). the extent to which daryl yap tries to humanize the marcoses is so over the top it is comical. it’s not that humanizing the marcoses is a sin - it’s the @$$ kissing that makes one rolls their eyes. and there’s plenty of it here.nonetheless, i found this to be more entertaining than basically any lav diaz film i’ve seen, and less offensive than the racist film of (the otherwise great auteur) mike de leon (both of whom - rightfully so - are marcos critics). at least with maid in malacanang i knew what to expect - diaz is so pretentious i dgaf how much my politics align with his, and the fact that filipinos ignore the (not even casual) racism of kakabakaba ka ba really makes me want to bash my brains out. as if fawning over the royal family of england is any different than the fanaticism of marcos supporters, but one is more acceptable to certain filipino cinephiles than the other. in the end, if you’re not ken loach/paul laverty or the dardennes, what does it really matter? guys, it’s just a corny movie.tl;dr the marcos dynasty still sucks and this film is corny, just like all the films about the royal family. just laugh at it. or hate on it, i dgaf. but let’s not front, either postscript i can’t believe i have to actually say this, but one of my uncles was actually tortured under the marcos dictatorship, but i might as well just do it preemptively to ward off any weirdos who might come across this post and want to comment you apologist you! foh!",2023-02-10,18,4,watch,False

coffeemints,5,"[ahahaha if u saw my profile yes I watched this, but I also watched Katips as well- ALSO NO I WATCHED THIS FILM ONLINE JUST LIKE KATIPS]Okay before anything, I'm not a kakampink or Marcos Loyalist [and I don't care about political labels] so if you don't like my opinion cuz it doesn't align with your political views, then don't read my post from here.I've heard of Darryl Yap before [Via vincentiments] but I wasn't interested in his works- since I found most of them to be disrespectful and controversial, yet ig that's the style he likes or made him relevant anyways...So, I watched this film with a neutral thought-and I knew that this would focus on the Marcoses' (Obviously cuz Imee helped him produce it) last hours in Malacanang (yk when they were ousted in 1986), and I never really thought about it but yea I never heard their side of the story when it came to their last hours there...[Okay this is where all the political shenanigans happen so please respect my opinion huhuhu]Well, it's rare to see a film talk about the Marcoses on a less-evil note - unless bloggers talk about them, so there was kinda a gap for me when it came to perceiving Marcos Sr. as a father than as a strongman. It wasn't my cup of tea at first, but ig he was also a person who had his flaws IN THE FILM. The actor portrayed him pretty well, the same goes for Bongbong and the rest...I also liked how they centered this more on family issues than political issues tho. And wow They sure had their conflicts...I just didn't like how they kinda rushed on some parts, or overly exaggerated the maids...Storyline: Engaging and interesting, yet had some plotholes. [3/5]Characters: OKAY OUTSIDE THE ACTUAL MARCOSES, the characters in the film were good. [4/5]Music: Meh. [2/5]Overall: 9/15 - again I'm not a Marcos supporter [or even a Leni supporter] - but okay the film was decent. Relieved I didn't see this in the cinemas, but well it did reach my low expectations...""Does this change my opinion on the Marcoses"" - bruh, just cuz I watched a film that all the Marcos supporters had been eyeing about, doesn't mean that I will support him or his allies at all. I have my opinion on the family- and even if this film centers on them, it will never change my political views whatsoever.""Do you think this boosted Marcos' reputation"" - I can't speak for the film's viewers, it's up to the mindsets of both toxic and healthy-minded Filipinos who bothered seeing this movie. ""Do I think that this is historical revisionism?"" - not really, it's just their POV, also it's a movie with an exaggerated plot so I doubt it; after all, we can't speak for Imee, she's the daughter so she's tryna keep it clean ig""Katips or MiM?"" - I suggest watching both...then making your own opinion on them- outside the political viewpoint. Character-wise - MiM / Music-wise - Katips / entertainment-wise - both""Would I watch it again"" - don't expect it. I don't think I'd have the time to watch it or think about watching it- when I'm bored.The most important question: ""Is history tsmis?"" - hahahahahah no sweetie it's facts, yet these facts can change if there is any reliable book information that can justify a change. BUT OVERALL NO IT'S NOT. Do I look forward to seeing the sequel: MoM? (hA, sure but don't expect me to watch it in cinemas)",2022-09-16,2,1,watch,False
