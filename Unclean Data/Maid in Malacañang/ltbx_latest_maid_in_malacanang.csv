Unlike the film ""Katips"", this movie lacks credibility because it didn't even written in the history books. It only serves to distort the history by making the late dictator's name great.

udrich,1,"Badly-written, lazily-directed and saddled with terrible-pacing, wooden acting and a scattershot plot, Maid in Malacañang is Filipino Film Director Darryl Yap's vanity project whose sole raison d'etre seems be laundering the ignominious reputation of one of history's worst kleptocratic dictators Ferdinand Marcos Sr. along with his equally corrupt family (a reputation surpassed only by Suharto in pilfering his respective nation's coffers).Indeed, the project was concieved with the deposed despot's own unrepentant daughter Senator Imee Marcos serving as its ""creative producer"". With all of these elements at play, one can't help but think this film is just bad propaganda and self-serving hagiography. It brings nothing new to the table nor does it contribute to the advancement of the moviemaking craft. If that's not bad enough, Yap makes amateurish directorial missteps such as telling the story instead of showing it. The only positive the film possess is the fact the producers clearly spent money on its set pieces. With Maid in Malacañang, Yap ascends to the list of ignominious filmmakers such as Leni Riefenstahl and D.W. Griffith but with far less talent. Yap is certainly no auteur.",2022-08-04,47,0,rewatch,False

omnyojii,2,"Basically, a propaganda movie to white-washed the dark history of the family of Marcos. It garners dimwitted audience who doesn't read historical records and fanatics of the said family.

Media can kill you beyond the grave"", they sure are very aware of the historical distortion they are doing that's why they hired social media specialist or trolls to divide the people through populism.",2022-08-04,32,0,watch,False

edzopalacol,3,"As a person who doesn't read, I wasn't a fan of all the text and exposition that cuts frequently throughout the film. It's a basic known rule in filmmaking to ""show, don't tell"". I also don't feel like there's enough story to divide the film into ""chapters"", especially when each chapter felt like lasting only 10 minutes at most.The film tries SO HARD and SO ANNOYINGLY to paint the Marcoses in such a great and kinder light. It tries to portray them as the victims that in retrospect only happened because of the corruption and deceit their family had done in the first place.Artistically it was fine. The direction was atleast dynamic and some effort was put in. Although the choice of a squarish aspect ratio made it all feel too ""compact"". Especially since it was accompanied by having almost all shots indoors and in small rooms.I have no sensible reason whatsoever to endorse anyone to watch this movie. It all really is just an effort to repaint history in favor the Marcoses. Put simply, it's brainwashing.",2022-08-04,4,0,watch,False

""galit sila kasi di tayo galing sa elitistang ankan, galit sila dahil Probinsyano tayo""THAT IS NOT WHY THEY ARE ANGRY.3. Maid speaking: Palamunin lang tayo!Holy shit ate di po kayo palamunin tangina nagtratrabaho nga kayo eh4. At the end of the movie they left the fuckin maids as protesters stormed the palace lmao and Imee Marcos cut a yellow dress of Imelda so their Malacañang staff can disguise themselves as protestors and not get attacked. Fucking kek.5. THE TITULAR ""MAID IN MALACAÑANG"" IS NOT EVEN ONE OF THE ACTUAL MAIDS. IMEE IS THE MAID IN MALACAÑANG HOLY FUCK. SHE WASN'T EVEN IN THE COUNTRY WHEN SHIT HIT THE FAN FOR HER FAMILY AND ONLY WENT TO THE PALACE WHEN MARCOS APPARENTLY CALLED HER BACK. THE ACTUAL MAIDS WERE NOTHING BUT COMIC RELIEF AND THERE TO PUT THE MARCOSES IN AN EVEN HIGHER PEDESTAL.6. Fuckin Robin Padilla shows up out of nowhere towards the end of the movie like a fuckin MCU cameo holy fuck.7. In between ""chapters"" of this movie, they show like text to say what's going on in history which kind of defeats the purpose of what a movie is lol8. The entire movie is like Birth of a Nation but like in the context of Martial Law era.9. Christine Reyes has the same acting of yelling a lot in the movie.In the end, this movie is not gonna help the Filipino people. It's just gonna build up the hegemony machine that they already control, rewriting their inconvenient history to be in favor of their narrative. They preach unity while at the same time demonize their opposition. I legit don't know how this country is gonna be lmao.",2022-08-04,275,3,rewatch,False

This is only one of several foreign foundations that the Marcoses established as supposed cover-up for their money deposited in the Swiss banking system.The Swiss Federal Supreme Court ruled that the secret Marcos account hidden in Swiss banks had criminal provenance. The high court ordered its transfer to the Republic of the Philippines and placed it under escrow with the Philippine National Bank. In 1998, Switzerland turned over to the Philippines bank deposits worth $627 million in accordance with the Swiss Federal Supreme Court.The Marcos foundations appealed to prevent the transfer of bank deposits to the Philippines but the Swiss Federal Supreme Court ruled that the foundations were mere creations of Marcos and that they had participated in his bad faith.",2022-08-06T07:52:25.069Z,0,0,watch,False

I wanted to gag—this was a waste of time, money, resources, and energy.

Walang katuturan, at wala akong napulot sa dalawang oras na pinanood ko 'to.Halatang ginawa lang for their long con of historical revisionism and bastardizing the Filipino people. They tried to `cleverly` frame this film from the perspective of the maids in malacañang, because if they focused on the Marcoses, there would be nothing to salvage from their naturally arrogant attitude—paanong naging `pamilya` at `hindi tinipid sa respeto`, ni hindi nga alam mga pangalan ninyo, hindi kayo ma-greet pabalik ng `magandang araw`, at hindi rin kayo inacknowledge unless uutusan? Kahit anong mangyari, lumalabas at lumalabas ang ugali ng mga Marcos.Everyone was so emotionally constipated—we didn't need to know about Imee's mommy and daddy issues and her screaming for two (2) hours straight about how she was so distressed and inconvenienced when thousands of Filipino people died during her father's dictatorship. Anong point no'ng, ""kung kailan pa ganito ang panahon, tsaka pa naging caviar ang ulam natin"" as if that line would do anything to relieve the fact that they are still privileged, benefitting from the money of the Filipino people, and them cowering in fear as the masses ask for the justice they deserve?Ampanget rin ng camera work, ano 'to, debut teaser? HORRENDOUS musical score, eugh. It was basically spoonfeeding and shoving it down our throats—carefully picked self-serving narratives, poor script and dialogue that feels very forced and unnatural, and just endless screaming as a pathetic attempt to try and evoke any emotion from the audience.

purplejeopardy,1,"They try so hard to make the Marcoses look more appealing, but they don’t even try to make the movie actually decent.1. I thought movies were supposed to mostly show, not tell? Why the hell are there just long walls of texts in between “chapters”? Okay, so you say the Marcoses are doing this and feeling that, so why don’t you just show it to us? You’ve got an ENTIRE set of actors and you instead just ask us to read the “struggles” they supposedly felt? Instead of the maids just telling stories about how kind the Marcoses are to them, why not actually show the Marcoses doing special things for the maids? Telling instead of showing is not entirely bad, but a little more effort here please. Which brings me to my next point…2. There is a lack of—or honestly, complete absence of—thought in the visuals. Okay, we got the 80s square ratio and sepia tones which seems to be nothing more than an aesthetic of the time period, but what about the cinematography and the staging? The camera seems to hesitantly step in and out because the frame is somehow not fitting everyone in LOL... the way the camera quickly rotates 180 degrees from person to person is offbeat; it looks like a Bong Joon-ho sequence done wrong. Why is it that most of these scenes are just long ass takes with the camera rotating 360 degrees? In one scene, a conversation between BBM and FEM had the camera just continuously circles around the two actors who don’t move from their positions at all—there’s not a care whether the facial expressions of the speaker or the reactor are more important to be shown at a certain moment. In another scene between BBM and Imelda, the camera watches them on the bed from above and just rotates endlessly… to what? Symbolize me spiraling out of control?3. They literally spend no time setting up the characters. It’s clear who they wrote this story for because you already have to be emotionally invested to relate to any of them. Naiyak daw sila kay Ella Cruz after having her show up for one crying scene with FEM after having no dad-daughter interaction in an earlier scene? Ano ‘to? Fanfiction? One shot? Kahit na, talo pa kayo sa mga kwento sa Wattpad.4. My god, the acting. Can’t even judge it because there isn’t even a good script in the first place LMAO. There’s a moment where I feel like the actors almost have good familial chemistry, until you actually listen to their conversations that are seemingly rid of variation at all (“di na tAyO maKAkAbAlik,” “mAkAkAbaLik tAyO mOmmYy 😭😭” repeated monotonously like 5 times). Christine Reyes screamed more times that the usual count in a horror movie. Although probably not as much as the times I’ve internally screamed in the cinema watching this…5. The soundtrack? They used like two pieces throughout the movie—one for “funny” scenes, and one for the sob stories. Then there was that Nosi Balasi song that was ruined by this film. I guess I should’ve expected that they couldn’t work on the score because they couldn’t even write a good script in the first place 😭Two hours of my life I’ll never get back, but at least these BaByM stans can’t say “Panoorin mo muna yung movie bago kayo magjudge.” Oh eto nga, pinanood ko na! 😩✌️",2022-08-06,0,0,watch,False

What else can one say to such a meandering plot, whose intent is currying sympathy from its audiences in a flagrantly unabashed manner...I sat just unmoved by all the scenes where a member of the Marcos family would either scream or cry. They were all unnecessarily saccharine or sentimental, portraying the Marcoses as a relatable, dysfunctional family.I was fortunate to have sat next to this charming individual. Her ticket was either free or heavily discounted; I can't seem to remember. She would entertain me with stories and her general kindness was infectious. But I noticed that whenever these clear dramatic moments would happen, she would legit cry and bawl her eyes out...I was left rather speechless, because, as a person who aligns himself against the Marcos dictatorship, it was difficult to empathize with those supporting him.The film itself did not merit any strong emotions from me. It was clear propaganda that places comedic moments, uttering not one stir of laughter from the audience. With exception to the ending before Cory's controversial mahjong scene, the humor and drama were all lacking in wit or insight.Still, I can't seem to get the picture of that woman crying, laughing, and feeling an internal sense of nationalism and pride at what I can only describe as pandering to the lowest common denominator.I'm now more terrified than ever that such a film will encourage people to support Bongbong Marcos, just as Iginuhit sa Tadhana did for his father.

jowanabueser,,"Tatlo ang layunin ng Maid in Malacanang: 1) ang papaniwalain ang mga tao na si Marcos ang dahilan kung bakit ""hindi naging madugo"" ang People Power 2) ang iluklok si Imee bilang totoong torchbearer ng kanilang pamilya 3) at ang ipasa ang responsibilidad nang pagtatanggol sa Martial Law sa mga ordinaryong tao.Isa-isahin natin.Oportunidad para sa mga Marcos na tabunan ng kasinungalingan ang patuloy na paglalarawan sa People Power bilang isang ""bloodles revolution."" Dumanak ng dugo noon. Hindi man sa mismong People Power subalit marami ang pinatay na Pilipino ng rehimeng Marcos. Tandaan natin na nagsimula ang himagsikan kontra Martial Law sa unang pagkakataon na may kumontra dito. Hindi natin dapat ikinakahon sa loob ng ilang araw ang pakikibaka kontra kay Marcos.Ang kasinungalingan na nais ipakalat ng pelikula ay simple lamang: kayang-kayang iutos ni Marcos na patayin ang mga nagtitipon-tipon sa lansangan ngunit pinili nitong panatilihin ang kapayapaan. Paulit-ulit din nilang idinidiin na ang sinumang sundalo at opisyales na sumapi sa kabilang panig ay mga traydor ng bayan.Eksperto sa gaslighting ang mga Marcos. Sino ba ang dahilan kung bakit nagtipon ang mga tao? Para sabihin na may utang na loob pa ang mga tao dahil pinili ni Marcos na hindi sila ipapatay ay isang panggagago. Ganito na lamang ang isipin mo: ninakawan ka ng pera at nang nakaharap mo ang magnanakaw, sinabi sa iyo, ""Pasalamat ka nga at hindi kita pinatay.""Walang duda kung sino ang pasimuno ng kasinungalingan. Bilang creative producer at executive producer, malaki ang naging papel ni Imee Marcos sa naging takbo ng kuwento. Malaki rin ang papel ng kanyang karakter sa pelikula. Kung tutuusin ay siya ang bida. Sa simula pa lang ay nais nilang ipakita na hindi tumatakbo ang Malacanang kung wala si Imee. Higit sa lahat, inalalayo nito ang responsibilidad sa kanyang mga magulang. Malinaw ang nais ipabatid sa mga tao: siya ang matalino, masipag, at madiskarteng anak ng kanyang ama. Siya ang totoong nagmana. Siya ang babaeng Ferdinand Marcos.Hindi ko alam kung anong mararamdaman ni Bongbong gayong ang kanyang karakter dito ay puro angst at daddy issues. Umiiyak at naghahanap ng affirmation mula sa ama. Hindi siya katulad ni Imee. Negligible si Irene. Samantalang si Little Aimee naman ay ginawang punchline. Maging si Imelda ay walang nagagawa sa panganay na anak. Katunayan ay palaging idinidiin na sila ay magkaiba. Reelectionist si Imee sa darating na midterm elections. Hindi ko pagtatakhan kung gagamitin nito ang pelikula para sa kanyang kampanya. Para sa mga loyalista ang paglalarawan sa kanya bilang tagapangtanggol at tagapagpatuloy ng adhikain ng ama. Kumbaga pandering to the base. (Sa isang tagpo tinawag ni Marcos si Imee bilang ""the best maid in Malacanang."" Napakalinaw ng intensyon.)Marahil ang ikatlong layunin ang pinaka-epektibo sa loyalista at sa mga taong madaling mapapaniwala ng maling impormasyon. Ang tatlong kasambahay sa Malacanang na ginagampanan nina Elizabeth Oropesa, Karla Estrada, at Beverly Salviejo ang nagsisilbing tagapaglahad ng pelikula. May isang eskena kung saan si Beverly ay inutusan ni Marcos na ikuwento kung ano ang naganap sa presscon nina Enrile at Ramos. Sila rin ang paulit-ulit na ipinapaalala sa manonood na mabubuting tao ang mga Marcos. Tila nais nilang ipasa ang responsibilidad nang pagtatanggol sa Martial Law sa mga ordinaryong tao . Nagkukubli sila sa mga taong tumatanaw ng utang na loob sa kanila upang mapagtakpan ang kanilang mga krimen. May isang eksena dito nang papaalis na sila sa Malacanang ay dali-daling inutusan ni Imee ang mga kasambahay na maglagay ng yellow headband upang hindi raw sila saktan ng taumbayang papasok sa Palasyo. Nagmamakaawa ang mga kasambahay na isama na lamang sila. Kung totoong may malasakit ang kanyang pamilya ay gagawin nilang prayoridad ang kanilang mga kasambahay. Pero hindi dahil mas mahalaga ang male-maletang alahas ni Imelda kaysa kanila. Alam ko na alam nila ang kasinungalingan ng kanilang pelikula. Tuwing merong eksena kung saan tahasan nilang binabaliktad ang nasusulat sa kasaysayan ay pinapasukan nila agad ito ng joke. Parang nervous laughter. Sana ay nininerbyos nga sila sa kanilang ginagawa dahil mahirap ipahiya ang mga taong walang hiya.",2022-08-06,4,0,watch,False

lerryjohnofcl,8,"Take a 360° look at the last 72 hours of the Marcoses in the presidential palace at the height of the EDSA Revolution in 1986. Highly controversial due to its subject matter, it gives voice to the infamous family that has never told its most vulnerable stories before. Passionately crafted by its equally controversial director Darryl Yap, this is his first drama film and Viva Films' first major theatrical event in the time of pandemic.Its ensemble cast consists of respectable actors, but special mention to three standout performances: Cesar Montano, who also previously played the hero Jose Rizal in the 90s, has effectively humanized the late Ferdinand Marcos Sr. as a father. The father-and-son confrontation was very powerful, more so that he shared the scene with his real-life son, Diego Loyzaga. Cristine Reyes as the eldest daughter Imee carried the film's tense moments on her shoulders and her indomitable presence brought the entire household together in its darkest hours. Beverly Salviejo utilized her theatrical chops as the housemaid Biday and she balanced all the drama with her genuinely funny antics that in one scene with her fellow maids, you'd see yourself cry then laugh then cry again.This is a family story at its very core, a dramatization of their final hours as a powerful first family and before their lives are changed forever. I like how every chapter incorporates real news footage or context then it portrays how it was like in the palace as these historical moments unfold. The soundtrack captures the mood and makes certain scenes unforgettable. The film evokes the feel of watching a theatrical play with its continuous shots and reliance on dialogue.However, this is in no way a perfect film. While it mainly focuses on the characters' interactions, there are certain parts of conversations that I believe are unnecessary and could've been ommitted. Since it's a period piece, there were some (humorous) utterances more common in our current day and age that it's ridiculous to hear them in 1986. The camera works need more polishing especially in the continuous scenes, there are times when the framing or angle techniques could be a bit distracting to the viewers (and to the actors too). Plus, I would love to see more of Imelda than in the very few scenes she's in.And for the million dollar question: Does the film blatantly revise history as we know it? Well, you'd be disappointed to find this is not the film all them noisy people are claiming it to be. The emotional outbursts on where the family's persecution was coming from could be heavily debated, but these were the family's inner thoughts in the midst of chaos. The controversial Cory scene is simply as it is, aptly symbolizing the 'game' of politics after EDSA.All in all, you'll feel roller-coaster emotions for the characters you've only heard bad things about, and you'll see them in the perspective of the closest people who were actually THERE. In fact, the thing that moved me the most is realizing that they are as real as you and I, and that far from being historians, at least they have finally spoken their truth.And the rest, they say, is history.4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐",2022-08-04,0,0,watch,False

francesizzy,1,"I was forced to watch this and I spent 114 minutes on Imee's anger issues. She should have been the one to run as president since the movie portrayed her as the brain and the main character of the Marcos family. Bongbong literally did nothing but wear a fucking uniform and wallow throughout the film.Majority of the scenes Imee was shouting but props to her outfits; they were all pretty, well, coming from the kaban ng bayan of course. Tho I have to say whoever Cristina's wardrobe director is... love the fits. Ang pretty rin masyado ni Cristina para matawag na Imee huhu TvT but my eardrums were annoyed with her constant screeches.Ang pogi rin ni Bonbong pero hindi siya morena na chinito with short hair. Si Irene naman they slayed the fact that I always forget she even existed even in the film walang may pake sakanya nasa gilid lang siya; waiting to be summoned. ""Wala kang alam, Irene! Wala kang alam!""ANYWAYThey tried to explain their side by glorifying their Father (who literally ruled for 14 years) using the weapon of pity. Hear me out with what Ferdie said""Galit sila sa'tin kasi hindi tayo nagmula sa isang elitistang pamilya"" UHM? HELLAUR?? UR FATHER AND GREAT GRAND FATHER HAD BEEN MINGLING WITH POLITICS BEFORE U WERE EVEN BORN?? ever since the Marcoses joined the nation's politics; it just birthed a whole dynasty as we can see in Ilocos Norte. This has been their name's family business. Your family encapsulated the very core of what an elitist is so I greatly beg to differ.""Galit sila sa'tin kasi probinsiyano tayo""Ako ren, probinsiyana ako pero galit ako sa'yo. And in the first place, out of all the 16 ex- presidents, si Estrada lang ang born as BGC kid dito. Don't use that ""probinsiyano"" card as a decoy for pity because there is nothing wrong with being a probinsiyano. Magsaysay was from Zambales and he proved to be a great president so I don't know why you have to bring your ancestry up when it's not even a good factor to be considered. Try better.""Galit sila sa'tin kasi mahal nila tayo""There's a literal revolution outside your house.. so uhm... yeah.. Also, I expected this would be a film in honor of the Malacañang maids but.. Jesus Christ... I should have expected their tremendous ego beforehand. I mean they tried to pan the attention back to the maids but the actual ""Maid in Malacañang"" is none other than Imee herself. You figure how the fuck that happened. Not to mention the sex-ish scene dedicated to Imelda and her 3000 shoes.. No idea where that came from but God was that weird. There was also this scene where as the Marcoses were about to leave, Imee ordered her maids to tear a piece of her Mother's gown and make a bandana of some sort so they could pretend like their part of the riot and get out of the mansion safely. That was witty actually but also overdramatically stupid. A GOWN? OF ALL THE GARMENTS??? A GOOOWN????? AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS REALLY HAPPENED???There's also this scene with Cory Aquino and the Carmelite nuns. Cory acted like fucking Kris Aquino on this movie, with the accent and all. It's supposed to be a form of mockery, I assume but they really didn't leave the nuns out of this. Their form of mockery is to have pink linen on their HABIT? Bravo for the audacity! Sacrilegious Blasphemy! And for the historical inaccuracy! There's literally a book completely denouncing this fabricated claims so congratulations for that.Ay gago may biglaang cameo pa pala dito ni Robin Padilla parang Stan Lee jusko. Am I supposed to gasp in surprise and awe because owemji that's my top 1? fuck off ^-^All in all, cinematography and the script itself is idfk?? because you can literally see the camera shaking in the first few scenes and again the weird intimate scene with Imelda and her shoe collection.. comedic relief lang nila is 'yung the actual maids of malacañang and they really relied on hearsays here as they portrayed their katulongs as ""marites"" which is offensive with the people working the same field.

lncrxv,1,"honestly watched this for free thanks to the vouchers that they have been giving to government offices.if i were a marcos voter who somehow trusted and believed in him and his family, like the rest of the 31 million, i would have loved this. it tried to gain further sympathy and humanize a family who has been under siege by forces who either betrayed them or wanted to take the malacañang for their own benefit. never mind the fact that the palace and the presidency weren't and shouldn't be permanently belong to them. this shows drama, like how teleseryes try to do so, and the marcoses (especially imee) as the protagonists who are dealing with a huge threat.but, as someone who knows my history, this is a fucking propaganda film that has been used to humanize a family who plundered billions of dollars and plunged our country to debt and disaster after more than 20 years in power. i laughed at how marcos sr. asked irene (played by chismosang ella cruz) if he was a bad person. imee, acting all high and mighty, tried to be the family's savior all while bonget just wants to make his father proud (i remembered that four sisters scene). it sought to clearly wipe their sins out and make the people forget how they made our country suffer. MIM reorients the supposed ""goons"" of the country to the yellows and all of their elites and cohorts that wanted to take the power away from the besieged marcoses. this film failed to highlight the most important part as the story of 1986 unfolded: it was the filipino people who ousted the marcoses. edsa was not about cory or macoy, it was about us at that time in history when we took the matters to the streets. so i commend darryl yap as a staunch marcos propagandist, especially in trying to protagonize imee rather than her brother. but as a filipino who will never forget the marcos atrocities, i'll continue to long for a day in my lifetime where he will eventually pay his sins for brainwashing our people.",2022-08-10,1,0,watch,False

chasingmovies,5,"Watched ""Maid in Malacañang"" at SM Sangandaan Cinema 2.Smart clever HARMLESS insightful art film that does not actually distort history on its main story.But as a committed Marcos sympathy apologist filmMaid in Malacañang is such a WEAK pro-Marcos propaganda filmThat can be easily debunked, disputed called-out or trashed out by reply films made by REAL Filipino filmmakers calling out the horrific facts of the brutal Marcos dictatorshipWaiting to watch those stronger reply films shouting #NeverAgain to Marcos Martial Law!Contrary to the rabid noise on social media claiming that this movie is made out of malicious lies meant for historical revisionism.I'm surprised that ""Maid In Malacañang"" does NOT revise distort our collective Philippine history about the brutal & corrupt Marcos regime,The film actually embraces our ACTUAL history about the impeding end of the Marcos dictatorship.It even acknowledges some of the grave sins of the Marcos regime such as blatantly bribing local leaders to maintain political clout, the lavish lifestyle brought by absolute dictatorship etc.Even accepting the dictator's political playbook that a dictator's rule would not last forever.The brutal Marcos dictatorship, as well as other dictatorships around the world will surely end.Not a question of if it would end but when.And the Marcoses accept that historical FACT and not denying it.So ""Maid In Malacañang"" is not just a movie about the last hours of the Marcos dictatorship.But it is also a powerbank of emotional hugot and sentiments from the point of view of Marcos along with his last loyalists standing in Malacañang at this turning point of our ACTUAL history. It is obviously clear that the movie does not distort nor revise history on its main story.But the film artistically uses unreliable narration recalling events of the historic last moments of the Marcos dictatorship.Using ""tsismis"" accounts from the feeble-minded maids who reflect typical Filipino masses who do not know much but still stands by their own version of any real-life stories via unfounded rumors or ""tsismis"".And using such rumors from naive commonfolk where their little world just revolves inside Malacañang is a legitimate social commentary on the reality that the Filipino masses do not know the real story, standing firm on knowing historical or current events based on hearsays, rumors and ""tsismis"".This is a social commentary FACT and not ""tsismis"" at all.And the film still utilizes unreliable narration of past historical events of the Marcos regime based from testimonies from the Marcos childrenWho spend most of their youth living carefree lives not minding what's happening in our country governed by their brutal dictator of a father for more than two decades.It would be understandable for the Imee or Bongbong character in the film to ""claim"" that their dictator father was betrayed, deceived or colluded by his supposed ""trusted minions"" in the dictatorship.That could be their opinion, baseless emotional rants or understanding on what happened based from their little world which may or may not be true.Everyone of us has biased opinions or varying levels of understanding from factual historical eventsEspecially on crucial moments where emotions ran high and the beleaguered may not think well anymore succumbing to delusions and the 5 stages of grief.So the historical events of the last moments of the Marcos dictatorship still remains intact without any historical revisionism or distortion. What we witness in the film are emotional rants, hugots and dangling opinions & perspectives of the royal Marcos household as they are facing the final curtain of their golden era of the Marcos dictatorship.The Marcos family depicted in ""Maid In Malacañang"" is NOT who the Marcoses actually are.The Marcos family is clandestine.They keep an inner circle where they secretly live as they actually are.The Filipino masses & the international community do not actually know who the Marcoses really are.Being a masterful Filipino political family, the Marcoses like to keep a front or a political facade of a public image infront of the people.The Marcoses like veteran politicians would want to contruct their public image based on what the Filipino people would want to see and based on what the Marcoses themselves would want the Filipino people to know about them.So ""Maid in Malacañang"" with artistic license, superficially & cinematically portray the Marcoses based on what the Filipino audience would want to see from them or based on what the film or producers would want the Filipino audience to see about the Marcoses with a specific objective to win their sympathy.This is why I doubt if the Marcoses do speak in Tagalog most of the time or the Marcos children are very knowledgeable or fully aware of their father's dictatorship to the point that they can try to take control of the dangerous situation that the Marcos family were into.Cesar Montano is the worst actor to portray the dictator Ferdinand Marcos.He does not resemble nor act like the real Ferdinand Marcos.Cesar Montano seems to be a fraud of a Marcos in the film.Ruben Rustria is still the best actor that convincingly portay the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos in the Australian film ""A Dangerous Life"" which we Filipinos watched on ABS-CBN Channel 2 after the EDSA Revolution.Ruffa Gutierrez in fairness does resemble first lady Imelda Marcos in a way as Imelda has white skin similar with Ruffa.However, Tessie Tomas although morena still delivers an iconic role as Imelda Marcos as a kingmaker of a first lady also in ""A Dangerous Life"".However, Ruffa Gutierrez is given little acting or significance in ""Maid in Malacañang"".Such an odd choice from the director as Imelda Marcos remains to be a very iconic & very fascinating political figure in the world.Both Cesar Montano and Ruffa Gutirrez give very lame performance as the once powerful Marcos dictator couple. But I cannot blame them for they are not the main characters of the movie.I'm surprised that the Marcos children are the main characters in which ""Maid In Malacañang"" is all about.Particularly the Imee Marcos character who is actually the lead character in the film.Although the Bongbong Marcos character delivered an interesting scene throwing barbs with his father.So ""Maid In Malacañang"" does not really revise or distort history in its main story but only utilizes unreliable narration and equally unreliable yet raw impactful emotional sentiments of the unreliably cinematically stylized Marcos family as they face the final chapter of the dictator's playbook on that fateful event.Inspite of employing unreliable narration and sentiments,The artistic messaging is very clear in ""Maid In Malacañang"".The reign of the once mighty Marcos dictator couple is about to end and they are both resigned & disillusioned with their fate & the end of their legacy.But the Marcos children remains strong & defiant seemingly taking charge of moving on and reclaiming the honor of the Marcos family moving forward.The Marcoses has accepted factual history of the end of their dictatorshipBut they willfully draw sentiments, sympathies & even pity from the Filipino peopleAs the Marcoses still uphold their pride, honor & dignity even at the lowest point of their lives.So the film does not intend to revise or distort history in its main story.For the Marcoses themselves accept their place in history as it is.But they make sure that they would use factual history to turn back in their favor.I heard Imelda Marcos mention about using history in their favor in an old news clip.And this film truly reaffirms the determination of the Marcoses to make factual history work for their favor.The film is obviously a Marcos apologist, sympathizing propaganda moviePrimarily catering to the Marcos loyalist & supporters seeking vindication from the recent win of Bongbong Marcos making another Marcos our President right now.But at the same time, the film also caters to REAL Filipinos like me who remember & despise the brutal despotic Marcos dictatorship and who value the EDSA Revolution and the return of Philippine democracy that Marcos has nefariously taken away from us Filipinos.So ""Maid In Malacañang"" along with its story caters to BOTH pro-Marcos and anti-Marcos alike.With the same emotional blurbs & sentiments where the Marcoses try to redeem their legacy and consoling themselves that the Marcoses has done great for the Philippines and is a poor victim of betrayal from his ""political minions"" wanting to grab (dictator?) power from him. For REAL Filipinos like me who despite Marcos brutal dictatorship, I pity & looked down at the Marcoses in the film with their disillusionment & delusions as they bitterly accept their humiliating fate with their destined end of their typical dictator's saga.But for the rabid Marcos loyalists & dumb random Filipino audience who just wants to spend time in the cinema, they can get enamored and easily sympathize with the Marcos with those same scenes & lines.Especially with that scene where the Cesar Montano Ferdinand Marcos whimsically said that the elites want to oust him from power for he is just a ""simple probinsyano"".For REAL Filipinos like me, that's laughable & very pathetic for the once mighty dictator to say that.But for the Marcos loyalists & dumb Filipino masses watching the movie, that line may resound on them which would effectively sympathize & root for the Marcoses simply for being also a ""simple probinsyano"".This same ""Maid In Malacañang"" film caters to both pro-Marcos, anti-Marcos and even to those who do not give a damn about the Marcoses.The same theme & scenes caters to the most politically polarized affinity with different persepectives on the same film.In the film, the dictator Marcos character in the film explicitly calls his daughter, the Imee Marcos character in the film the ""Maid in Malacañang"".I think Senator Imee Marcos divulged a secret family joke about her during the Marcoses' long stay in Malacañang.But what is very interesting in the film are the ""Maids in Malacañang"" portrayed in the film.These maids are tools for the film to enforce unreliable narration by relying on ""tsismis"" to interpret history.And those maids provide some humor and comic relief to the film.But the cinematic significance of the maids in the film are more profound and more poetic than being just comic reliefs.Director Darryl Yap actually lives up with the title of the film and puts those ""Maids in Malacañang"" into the pedestal driving the message and its ideology on the film.He promoted those maids from being comical extras for the cinematic Marcos family into a compelling symbol representing the Filipino people as a whole!Karla Estrada has delivered the most powerful and convincing role in her showbiz career with ""Maid In Malacañang"".Director Darryl Yap made a once underrated Kim Molina into a star in the well-acclaimed #Jowable.Now he has rewarded Karla Estrada with a supposed-to-be simple extra role into a metaphorical character on how the Filipino people are treated & see themselves as the maids & helpers of the Marcos dynasty in Malacañang.This is an amazing feat.Karla Estrada should thank Darryl Yap for giving her an important, substantial role of her lifetime!That scene where Yaya Karla Estrada rallies all the maids & Malacañang household members to come to terms with what they would do after the Marcos would leave & mad demonstrators are marching into Malacañang, is truly a cinematic game-changer unraveling the metaphorical strengths of the film.Finally, those seemingly lowly maids & other Malacañang househeld members are given an important symbol unraveling the UNTOLD TRUTH that ""Maid in Malacañang"" would unravel!Those maids in Malacañang do not only represent the Marcos loyalists.They also represent all of us Filipinos in general.As we Filipinos during the entire Marcos dictatorship see ourselves & are regarded by Marcos & everyone around the world as mere maids, helpers of the royal Marcos family & wilfull enablers of the Marcos dictatorship or any corrupt regime.This metaphor is so convincingly TRUE!I'm so amazed!The film has started to unravel the UNTOLD TRUTH on ""Maid In Malacañang""!The film attempts to pack a big punch at the final scene depicting the siege in Malacañang marking the tangible end of the Marcos dictatorship.First of all, this final scene of ""Maid In Malacañang"" is the start of its HISTORICAL DISTORTION.The historical portrayal of the siege in Malacañang is oh so WRONG!The rallyists sieging the Presidential Palace are all not wearing yellow.Some or even most of them are reds.The rallyists are not actually mostly Cory Aquino supporters.Many of the rallyists sieging Malacañang are Joma Sison Communist followers.So it clearly explains why those rallyists seiging Malacañang exhibit very unruly and raging behavior.After all these years of being oppressed by the Marcos Dictatorship, they understandably vent their extreme rage & anger in Malacañang hoping to capture the Marcoses inside the palace.I personally took part of the EDSA Revolution.Many the REAL Filipinos in the EDSA Revolution are not seiging Malacañang.I as well as many of the EDSA Revolution participants wearing yellow are in EDSA in Quezon City, particularly along our AFP military Camp Aguinaldo and our Police headquarters Camp Crame trying to form a massive human blockade to protect our military hero, Fidel V. Ramos & other prominent revolutionaries from being attacked by the loyal Marcos forces.There could be yellow supporters marching to Malacañang but many of them are Communist militant activists.So ""Maid In Malacañang"" is OH SO WRONG portraying the rallyists all wearing yellow.Many of them should wear Communist red when seiging to Malacañang as an actual & fair depiction of history.But Director Darryl Yap made an undignified choice to distort historical justice over poetic justice as he is trying to make a statement out of the so-called ""Yellow"" seige in Malacañang.Just treat this Malacañang seige scene not as a historical account but rather as a cinematic metaphorical statement unveiling the UNTOLD TRUTH from the movie.That so-called Malacañang seige scene powerfully states that the Filipino masses are really not genuinely invested in revolutions.Revolutions come and go.The Filipino masses would naturally join the revolution only if they see that it benefits their little lives.It's not about being patriotic.The Filipino masses join the revolution only for their little vested self-interest.And that is the UNTOLD FACT that caught me by surprise watching this Darryl Yap film.Revolutions come and go.Along with those in power and other politicians who come and go with the times.That's the TRUTH!Naglunsad ng rebolusyon ang masang Pilipino HINDI dahil sa pagiging makabayan kung hindi para sa kanilang maliit na sariling interes. At iyan talaga ang KATOTOTHANAN sa buhay.Pana-panahon lang ang rebolusyon.Pana-panahon lang ang mga nasa kapangyarihan.Pana-panahon lang ang pulitika.This is where the highly creative artistic talent of Director Darryl Yap come to play in this film.Just as when the main story has ended and the film had made a credible point.Director Darryl Yap has to make Marvel-MCU-like mid-credits scenes that stir real repulsive controversy that would drag down the film.Giselle Sanchez's depiction of Democracy Icon Cory Aquino is her worst acting ever that could damage her career.That post-credit scene where Cory play mahjong with the Carmelite Sisters in Cebu is a malicious smear to the undisputed Revolutionary and Democracy Icon.It's even a blatant attack on the Carmelite Sisters as well.But at least this is considered to be a post-credit scene that is actually not an integral part of the main story and message of the film.This malicious scene could be easily taken away on future releases on television, Vivamax & other streaming sites & on official physical copies,In case the Carmelite Sisters or the Aquino estate would file an injuction order to the courts against the film.But that mahjong scene is part of Darryl Yap's cinematically poetic metaphor reinforcing its message that no political ruler or ideology would last forever.Panahon-panahon lang ang pulitika.As there is also a mahjong scene in Imee Marcos's residence at the beginning of the film.And that Robin Padilla cameo scene truly shows that he's a sellout.I remembered his past interviews that he idolizes Che Guevarra & other armed revolutionaries.Now he portrayed a ""rebel"" solidier who pretended to be a rebel but approached the Marcoses to show his loyalty to the dictator family.So Robin Padilla projecting his bad boy, rebel, revolutionary persona on movies is nothing but a farce.Robin Padilla is truly a sell-out and a tool.So yes!""Maid In Malacañang"" is a creative decent art film that does not primarily alter, revise or distort our Philippine history, except for the last scene out of ""poetic justice"".The film embraces actual history accepting the fate of the Marcoses falling from grace as their dictatorship is collapsing in front of them just as stipulated from a dictator's playbook.But inspite of the Marcos's downfall, they still put their heads up high and salvage whatever dignity is left from them to finally leave the Philippines effectively ending their brutal dictatorship.This is what the film is all about. Very harmless, accessible and even interesting.This could have been another good film by Director Darryl Yap (Yet way inferior to his acclaimed landmark film #Jowable which is truly great!).Whatever the film says makes it good.However, whatever the film DOES NOT SAY, makes it truly BAD!The film continues to depict the Marcoses as the fallen victims of their impending doom.And those angry rallyists storming Malacañang really look rabid and inhumane (Since most these rallyists are actually rabid Communist militant activists who should be wearning red not yellow.).The film keeps on stressing that the Marcoses are betrayed, coerced & are ousted for the patriarch is a probinsyano which is utterly ridiculous.But what the film FAILED to show is the background behind the call to oust Marcos from power.Surely, there are actual historical reasons why there are loud clamors for the Marcos to finally step down and to get out of the Philippines!It's surprising that ""Maid In Malacañang"" does not mention the Marcos dictatorship and Martial Law itself.The film does not let the Marcos characters reflect or retrospect their 20+ years of Marcos rule and dictatorship.The film does not even justify why the elder President Marcos has to declare Martial Law and even address the Cold War & Communist insurgency as an excusable reason for Marcos to declare Martial Law and rule as a dictator in order to save the Philippines.No refelections or justifications are made on the First Quarter Storm, Martial Law & the Marcos dictatorship ruling with an iron first.All that the Imee Marcos character has been saying and all the rants & sympathetic statements made by the cinematic Marcos family in the film are all ended up as just whims. Nothing substantial. No powerful statements spoken. Only whims.There are lots of good stories about the Marcos dictatorship that can be made into films which could be way better than this WEAK Darryl Yap movie.Perhaps narrating the context & events behind President Bongbong Marcos walking along Chinese Communist leader Mao Ze Dong would be a great idea for a movie that would put the Marcoses in a good respectable reputation!With the dicator's son as our current President, I would expect a Heneral Luna-like movie about the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. That will surely come and it's inevitable that we will all watch that upcoming film in cinemas.As a movie that commits itself to be a Marcos apologist, Marcos symapathizing & a pro-Marcos propaganda film,""Maid In Malacañang"" is actually a WEAK movie.With this fact, and in effect, this pro-Marcos movie can easily be refuted, debunked & belied by a bunch of new wave of anti-Marcos reply films that can successfully attack & destroy this Darryl Yap pro-Marcos film.Madaling pabulaanan ang ""Maid In Malacañang"" ng napakaraming reply films na darating sa susunod na taon.Director Darryl Yap through his pro-Marcos film is like taunting patriotic Filipinos to a fight but leaves himself very vulnerable to easily get defeated.Parang naghahamon ng away si Direk Darryl Yap sa napakaraming mga batikang director na mulat sa katotothanan ng Martial Law at marahas na diktadurya ni Marcos.Sa pamamagitan ng ""Maid In Malacañang"", nagbitiw ng isang suntok si Darryl Yap sa mga maka-Pilipinas na mga direktor.Subalit hindi malakas ang suntok ng kanyang pelikula kaya madaling matalo si Darryl Yap sa laban.So instead of winning the hearts and minds of the Filipino masses to the side of the Marcoses,""Maid In Malacañang"" has opened a pandora's box of a massive bunch of a new wave of anti-Marcos films that will expose again the TRUTH about the brutal Marcos dictatorship.Shouting ""Never Again! Never Again! To Marcos Martial Law!"".After watching ""Maid In Malacañang"",I'm eagerly waiting for so many reply films & anti-Marcos films that factually feature the TRUTH about the evils and brutality of the Marcos regime.Although ""Katips"" may not be a good reply film,There will surely be lots of anti-Marcos reply film to come to succesfully destroy ""Maid In Malacañang""!Attention, Director Joel Lamangan & other patriotic film directors who have been exposing the truth of the evil Marcos regime.Your time has finally come to fight back against this very WEAK pro-Marcos propaganda film!",2022-08-09,0,0,watch,False

siralcee,10,"Few honest reviews, some shamelessly dishonest. The FILM does not pretend to be anything but a story of the final 72 hours of the Marcoses in Malacanang. It divides that story into 8 chapters, each chapter dealing with the interactions of the Family members and some helpers. It does not make the Marcos 'saintly' as others try to do other politicians. It paints a grim situation of how a family will deal with their fall and how they will survive that fall. It shows BETRAYALS in the beginning. There are expositions, dropped hints and each chapter attempts to draw emotions from the viewers in multiple directions. Overall, it entertains very well, which the movie intends to. It narrates and successfully so. It informs as well. The Very Good: Music, Sound, Photography, Acting, Screenplay.The Good - Direction, Script, EditingThe Average: Production Design, Continuity, In-Film Clips The Below Average: The use of TEXT for exposition.

They were just used as a comedic relief. Probably a way to make them likable characters when in fact, you can't take them seriously.

jeddmalillin,1,"Review: No!Rewatch?: No!It's the perfect pseudo-documentary to feature the tsismis of Imee Marcos and their maids. The acting shown in this movie is very Daryll Yap trademark - lots of unnecessary shouting and corny one-liners.The fact that the reason why the Filipino people are mad and why Marcoses had to escape in the first place was left out showed it only tries to appeal to the emotions of the Apologists. Same thing with what the family and their maids had to pack before leaving the country which had been impounded by US Customs Service. Important facts like those were not revealed intentionally to fit the family of the dictator's narrative.As we all know, Imee Marcos got her hands all over this movie so she should bestow Cristine Reyes with a Best Actress award in a Proxy Role. I saw that the former got the main character syndrome in the film as energetically portrayed by the latter.Kudos to the whole team and the studio outfit who made this possible as the most trashy Filipino movie in a very long time to cash in on the gullibility of the fanatics.P.s. I was invited by a friend to watch it at a cinema so I had a chance to see it for myself for free. I will never contribute and will never be part of any disinformation drive of that hideous family.tl;dr Apolo10 movie, most of it was just tsismis. Avoid wasting money at all costs.

jansol,4,"The ""source material"" lends to much more and the film could have been executed better without being too melodramatic for those who just want to see a proper historical film adaptation and without being too propagandist for the subject's political rivals; near the end of the film almost of the characters have spouted general, grand statements of how another character is supposed to be and what he's not supposed to be. The titular characters aren't even the main focus of the film. The authenticity of the film, despite the touch of old logo of the production company, the setting, the cars, the aspect ratio are lost becuase rather than not being lazy and have the actors replaced the original people in the background photos and paintings, we see the real people instead. The tension was undercut due to screen narration rather than being the underlying atmosphere of the historicla situation and the melodramatic scenes being topped-off with Marvel-like comic quips.",2022-08-27,1,0,watch,False
