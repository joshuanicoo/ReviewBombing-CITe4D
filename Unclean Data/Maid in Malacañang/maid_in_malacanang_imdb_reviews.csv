ethansy-94636,"Aug 31, 2022","Anyone who gives this film higher than a 9 lacks integrity, or just has never seen a good movie","A lot of the late dictator's loyalists will hype this film up but its really, really boring. It's not the worst film I've seen but just like most of Darryl Yap's films, it's trash. Much of the acting from Christine Reyes is just her shouting. It's a grating noise to the ears. The maids in the film are the best part of it as the delivery of their lines are somewhat entertaining, however the lines and ""hugots"" feel so forced and shallow. The main problem is really the script. The emotional scenes feel so forced. It's obviously a propaganda film and a really boring one at that. It had an okay start but dragged so much at the middle almost as if they were trying to fit a bunch of propaganda from a checklist. The soundtrack and cinematography are okay but not enough to salvage the film. Skip it.",3
trialmaker,"Aug 6, 2022",PUTANGINA,"I don't know why people review this movie with 1 star, The movie have good combination of comedy and drama, But I think need more cinematography.

escaerlang,"Aug 9, 2022",Ferdinand E Marcos Sr is a great president,This movie shows a president who loves his people. I don't call him a dictator. I call him a great president. The Marcos family became victim of many false accuses.. I'm happy they are back.,No Rating
houdinad,"Aug 5, 2022",Another Darryl Yap trademark,"Political messages aside, the movie editing is messy and incoherent at times. The scene transitions were bad even for a typical Filipino drama. The acting seems forced and the story direction tries too hard but fails to convince viewers to sympathize with the cast because of badly placed comedic banters in between scenes and badly-written script. It seems like the director didn't learn or even try to improve on his filmmaking formula which has already been frowned upon in his previous films.",1
astrophel-57798,"Aug 4, 2022",Not even worth it,"Honestly, I was expecting a coherent turn of events in this film. However, the lack of cinematography bores me to the point it feels like I'm watching a poorly executed youtube skit. As to the transition of the scenes, it was choppy. At first, I thought I'll get used to it but it turns out to be very unnecessary and annoying. The color grading was ok but I supposed they could have done more in terms of the lighting.

Furthermore, the acting was so bland and god it was horrible, in fact one of the actress could not shed a tear in the climax of the film. Nonetheless, the girl with the short hair expresses well with her eyes but her voice screeches sometimes. The dialogues written was plain and bland unfortunately did not engaged us viewers. I was hoping they would take us back to that time but that was not the experience at all.

Overall, the movie felt so rush and unproduced. Not even worth your time.",1

KimSontoya,"Aug 6, 2022",It made me cry,"Please ignore harsh and negative comments about this movie. Most of them only watched the trailer and never bothered to watch the whole film. They are primarily from people who hate the Marcos family.

I just watched it last night, and it made me cry. I never expected myself to cry over a biopic, semi-documentary film that depicts the last 72 hours of the family of the leader who has been tagged as a dictator in Philippine history.

I don't have much expectation when it comes to local Filipino films. I never bother watching one in the past. But, for this one, I made an exemption.

I have watched maybe a thousand movies and foreign tv series; thus, I have a very high standard when rating one.

For this film, I rate it 6.5 stars.

It's a low-budget movie with a very compelling storyline and dialogue, and I don't want it to end. When it ended, I felt like there were more stories to tell, thus the reason I gave it a 6.5-star rating.

Another reason for my rating is that a few scenes are OA. I hope the director can improve his craft in the sequel movie, MoM - Martyr or Murderer? I am very interested to know what the Marcos family's take about the assassination of Benigno Aquino.",7
ralphzaimondd,"Aug 5, 2022",It could've been better.,"I know criticism is your enemy, but let's be honest in here.

Apparently, this could've been a good movie if all of these plots and stories were made with true and validated proofs. I could say it's not ""bad"" to tell the story of the Marcoses-if only they were truthful to what the Marcoses did back-in their last 72-hours in Malacañang. I could say that most of the plot in this movie is just as distorted as ever, although I wanted to hear a single thing that Marcos Sr. Admits his mistakes that he have done to his country back then, but it turns out that this movie came out to be such an anti-climatic, and distorted. I know this is hard to accept, but mocking the Carmelite Sisters playing Mah-Jhong, making Cory falsely say ""Let them out of the Philippines"" isn't really the most accurate stuff I've ever seen in the movie. There are still missing pieces that I wanted to hear from this movie's script and plot.

I could re-watch it again to re-validate the topics above, but no, Daryl Yap, you should've grabbed the history books and read them well-even if it contains your enemies' stories, learn to accept them-accept the truth for everyone to accept your movie, and not keeping up with those beautiful lies to distort the lads.",1
godyeahdamn,"Aug 5, 2022",I TRIED,"Watched this on the first day of release and was in utter disappointment on how bad the whole film was. Setting the fact that the goal of this film was to distort history, the overall production of the film was bad and mediocre. Some actors stood out with their good performances but clearly wasn't enough to save the whole film. Dialogues are weak and bland.

donvyt,"Aug 13, 2022",The title says it all: a version of a tale of one of the most contentious times in modern Philippine history...,"The title says it all: a version of a tale of one of the most contentious times in modern Philippine history as told from the point of view of three domestic helpers employed in the dictator: Ferdinand Marcos Senior's Presidential Palace.

(This is obviously the root of a recent trending topic on Philippine social media pitting historical accuracy against rumor-mongering - with the clear intent to validate this film's point of view.)

With the involvement in this film's production of a lone, single, individual with the last name 'Marcos,' from the entirety of this point in Philippine history; the film is the embodiment of a lone, single, individual's point of view.

Full transparency: this reviewer could only stand the first 30 minutes of the film before storming out because almost all of the events are conveyed through the incessant shouted narration, screamed narration, and complained narration of three fictional maids.

Context was totally absent - leaving the viewer to figure out for themselves and navigate the precise point in history that is being portrayed on film. As a witness to this history, even I could not make heads or tails of it.

Adding to the confusion, the actors playing their respective roles did not even exert any effort to try to emulate the mannerisms, speech patterns, and idiosyncrasies of the historical characters they are portraying. It's a guessing game, distracting from whatever message the film tries to convey, unless the entire nature of this film's existence is to distract.

The constant cutting between re-enactments and historical footage adds to the confusion since no attempt was made to recreate the footage using the actors in the same context. Go figure!

This is bad. Really bad. Really, really bad. If you're a masochist wishing and willing to undergo being constantly screamed at by the help, then, by all means, waste your hard-earned money.",1

angelo-27356,"Aug 5, 2022",A Movie that adds the story from the other persoective,"I would like to write this review with no political bias between Pro Marcos and Anti-Marcos as I can;

In the recounts of history about the Marcos Family has been demonized by the media and our historical books about the Martial law, the plot was entirely simple that depicts the last 3 days of the Marcos Family living inside the Presidential Palace. No Historical revisionism has taken place, I said it myself, THERE'S NONE! During the EDSA Revolution in the 1986 every documentary has all-out entirely focused about the Aquino and the People who went out to spurt their anger about how they are sick and tired on the rule of Marcos for the past two decades, the ounce of brutality and the human rights violation during the time of martial law (1972-1981) the mere fact that it was understandable due to the rise of Communism in the 70's and organized terrorist running rampant in the Philippines of why it was declared. When I sat down in cinema frowning down with my expectations quite low. Upon realizing that the movie is comprised with different segments of chapters as if its a book of some sort, another thing I can add-on was that documentaries are lazily panned from the actual movie instead of letting the actual actors/actresses to do their part of the following history. The first Chapters started quite alright upon build-up pacing for the story. This, however went dragging on to the point the chapters were too repetitive, unpolished and very unnecessary. Instead why not derive the Chapters to just 3 settings instead of 10. The First Chapter is the buildup, the second chapter will be the climax, and the third chapter as the aftermath.

My most awaited part of the plot was the actual 3 maids that served the Marcos family for 20 years. Beverly Salviejo as Yaya Biday, Elizabeth Oropesa as Yaya Lucy and Karla Estrada as Yaya Santa, which served as the center-piece of the history which proves that this event really happened during the last days of the Marcoses. My only issue with the maids depicted in this movie is portrayed in comedic manner in such a serious movie that tear-jerks your emotion The pacing went downhill when the rallyists stormed the Malacañang in a very comedic manner due to Budgetary constraints. Philippine movies have come a long way to depict a proper practical effects in the movie.",6

I really dislike this film, I enjoy Filipino documentaries because as a Filipina myself, it sparks nationalism in my heart but this movie? Not only did it do the polar opposite of what films usually make me feel but it made me sick to my stomach.

lybukid,"Aug 7, 2022",history revisionism,"Maid in Malacañang (2022) Directed by: Darryl Yap

Huling tatlong araw ng mga Marcos sa Malacañang... Ano ang nangyari ?

The movie didn't give the experience of a family in their last 72 hours.

The progression of events is anti-climactic.

The flow of conversation is dull.

The choice of words is hollow.

The storytelling is not cohesive.

It feels like you're watching some YouTube skits, TV Patrol excerpts, Theater scenes and SOCO rolled into one.

News. Drama. Documentary.

Fiction. Biopic. Comedy.

Fantasy. Tribute. History.

They didn't know what to tell and how to tell it, so they showed a bit of every other thing.

They just combined all their scenes by inserting ""chapters"" and ""long texts"" in between that literally summarizes what they want to tell-which defeats the purpose of a movie.

Some scenes give the impression of one long continuous shot. It actually works when Cristine Reyes is in the scene.

Si Cristine Reyes ang nagdala ng pelikula. Tumataas ang tensyon kapag siya na ang nasa eksena.

Magaling umiyak si Ella Cruz. Masaya ang tambalan nila Karla Estrada, Elizabeth Oropesa at Beverly Salviejo.

Walang dating si Cesar Montano.

Walang emosyon si Diego Loyzaga.

Walang ginawa sina Kiko Estrada at Kyle Velino.

Mas malakas ang prisensya nina Robin Padilla at Giselle Sanchez kahit ilang segundo lang sila nagpakita.

Hindi marunong umarte si Ruffa Gutierrez. Lumuluha na pero mukhang nagpapatawa pa rin.

Mas magaling pa umarte yung bodyguard na taga-Ilocos daw.

Meron mga salita na hindi naman ginagamit nuon. Pero lantaran nilang sinasabi sa pelikulang ito.

The scoring is deceiving, trying to enhance the scene-even when there's nothing remarkable in it.

Then by the end, there's a sudden tribute to characters that were not given its decent exposure during the actual movie runtime. An illusion that something is made for them-when it is not.

Mapanlinlang ang pelikula.

Makalat ang kabuuan.

Pero hinding hindi ka makakatulog.

This mysterious side had always been depicted as the darkest and people in control of information, breeds a notion that it's a damnation to have knowledge about this side. In fact, Philippine history books instill very negative pictures about a past President, while numerous living grandparents and ordinary folks who were witnesses of his reign (including my father, uncles and aunts) were all praises and admiration, calling him the ""Best Philippine President ever"" were undocumented.

This movie stirs additional curiosity to every Filipino as the story revolves from the point-of-view of the first family, being revealed and heard of for the first time.

A very family-oriented and brilliant movie you shouldn't miss!

Acting was subpar, it felt awkward. The actors were misguided, perhaps in their direction on how to attack such scenes. At some points, scenes felt surreal. Good thing there were some funny tidbits.

Scenes were oftentimes monotonous, yet sometimes overbearing at the same time. The shrill zany acting in the second half of the film is just irritating at best.

This film has painted a negative narrative for President Cory Aquino. According to this film, during the EDSA Revolution in 1986, the late president dared to gamble with nuns whilst the Philippines' democracy is under siege.

kylfno,"Aug 7, 2022",NO HISTORICAL REVISIONISM,"I attended a special screening organized by the 31 Million Movement from Facebook last August 5th held at Greenbelt 3 in Makati. Even it's too far from my house, I rode an Angkas taxi even with torrential rain since I was so late and got all wet, because I know that it will be all worth it. And it did. No disappointments nor any dissatisfaction. I even met Billy Jake Cortez and Julinana Parizcova Segovia, special guests for this screening.

The movie itself was good. The actors who portrayed every character has their own distinction, and were of high caliber. No historical revisionism was made nor inteded on this movie as the others were telling. They just told the untold stories of the Marcoses during their last 72 hours in The Malacañan Palace.

Congratulations to Direk Darryl Yap for yet another masterpiece and can't wait for the rest of the Trilogy to be released.",10

jickain_ant,"Aug 6, 2022",Thrash,"Looks like a school project converted into a movie, funded by the Marcos. A movie that based on lies and historical distortion. There is nothing interesting on its story. It's great mockery to the Philippine history. 👎",1
kiddarknesselmszz,"Aug 5, 2022",Don't mind the 1star reviews,"First of all, don't even waste your time reading all the 1-star reviews that were given to this movie. They are just mad because they are driven by the fear that their narratives might be overshadowed.

Second of all, this is just a FAMILY drama and intended to show their side of the story that other people outside the President's residence are not aware of.

Plot: This is just a straightforward dramedy that tells the struggles of the first family of the Philippines during their last 72 hours inside the Malacañang palace. The movie is divided by chapters. Of course it touched politics, but more than that it was a Family drama. The story was told with a mix of truth and artistic view. The movie will make you cry and laugh at the same time.

Tone: It was made to entertain and educate as well. It highlights what is obvious in Politics; trust, betrayal, loyalty, etc. Most importantly, it really tackles the importance of family during difficult times.

Acting and Characters: All the actors have played their roles really well. It seems that each character's attitude and behavior fit the actor who played it. Every scene is remarkable and will pinch your heart as if you are part of the scene. You can feel the emotions in every dialogue exchange, as if they are not acting and just comes out naturally.

Cinematography: There were scenes where the camera is panning in circular motion as if the movie is showing the audience how this family's life is turning upside down especially the scene between the mother and her son. The movement and acting are aligned and the actors are properly framed.

Summary: This may be my own opinion about the movie, but I can assure you that this is a legit review as I have already watched the entire film. Don't rely on the reviews having 5 stars and below, there are some Anti Marcos out there that don't even bother to watch the whole movie yet they are leaving reviews as if they are being good critics when in fact they are just bitter because another Marcos has returned in Malacañang. 🙂",10

""Huling tatlong araw ng mga Marcos sa Malacañang, ano ang nangyari?"" was the supposed plot

Yet, the movie didn't give the experience of a family in their last 72 hours

The progression of events is anti-climactic

The flow of conversation is hollow

The choice of words contribute to the hollowness

The storytelling is disorderly

Continuously changes format narratives

I think if they stuck to a ""documentary"" type of movie it would've fit well

They didn't know what to tell and how to tell it, so it became an amalgamation of every movie format possible

They just combined all their scenes by inserting ""chapters"" and ""long texts"" in between that literally summarizes what they want to tell-which defeats the purpose of a movie

Cristine Reyes carried the movie, Ella Cruz has solid crying acts

Cesar Montano, playing the infamous dictator, has no semblance of the supposed 'strongman' traits of the one he's playing Diego Loyzaga literally has no emotion

Others didn't do anything Looking at you Kiko Estrada

Misrepresentation of nuns with Giselle Sanchez playing mahjong already crosses this film out as a supposed ""addition"" to history, since said nuns are cloistered

Usage of words that were not present those days, but are yet frequently heard in the movie

Usage of musical scores are way off, since most of the scores play in scenes that are unremarkable

Then by the end, there's a weird and sudden tribute to characters that were not given its decent exposure during the actual movie runtime. An illusion that something is made for them - yet the movie is portraying a supposed tribute for the said dynasty

In the end, you'd stay awake because it isn't boring, but you're trying to understand why the movie is made as it is, and the supposed plot and the actual output strayed so far

All of that trouble but still ain't worth every minutes we spent. Now they're requiring us to do a review and give this 10 contrary to our conscience. So I'll take this opportunity to show my frustration instead.

I promised to myself that I won't participate in this political quarrel, but after watching this and sharing a room with some of their worshippers, I can now understand why they received so much hate. This is so bad that the comfortable sit in cinema feels like a iron chair (the one they use for torture). The whole environment itself is bad, not just the movie. I can't explain it, but everyone feels dead. Like if this is hell, then it's actually worse than what they portray in every story. And for a ""supposedly"" historical movie, this is very cringey. If I were to choose whether the world hunger to be solved or unwatch this movie, I would definitely choose the latter without any hesitation.

The so-called revolution was actually a coup d' etat of the high ranking military traitors with human shield. Cory Aquino was not a symbol of democracy.

It is not intended to alter the dominant Edsa People Power narrative. But it provides us a glimpse of what happened in the other side of Edsa, the Malacanang Palace.

It is not historical revisionism as alleged by the sanctimonious among us who appointed themselves as protectors of our history.

benjamin-52143,"Aug 4, 2022",A film about a powerful political family facing the reality of their collapse.,"The film portrayed the last three days leading to the fall of the Marcos family and their exile to Hawaii in 1986.

Taking away the political bias, the context of the film was about how each family member responded and acted to the realization that their world, their paradigm, was about to shatter because of betrayal which is a universal theme that everyone can relate to.

The cinematography was good, limited by the fact that the film had a meager budget and there was only one or two shooting locations for the movie. The soundtrack was well-thought of and laid out very well throughout the movie. Editing was better than most Filipino films that I personally had seen.

The acting was top-notch, and this is coming from a non-viewer of Filipino films---the performances were riveting and heart-wrenching which took me by surprise and disarmed me which is probably because so many people had given the movie bad reviews based on the trailer and not actually watching it. There were scenes which were jarring to paranoia tempered by scenes that were light-hearted and cringingly humorous. My only wish was that the costumes, props, and settings were more historically accurate, but I will cut it some slack since there wasn't much of a budget to begin with.

I would gladly recommend this movie to everybody, and would like to encourage everyone to have an open mind and the suspension of disbelief when going in the movie theatre. One's politics is only a small fraction of one's personality, so leave it at the doorstep and enjoy a rollercoaster ride.

This movie is a good one to take the time to watch. It is a film that is greater than the sum of its parts. Looking forward to watching the proposed sequels.",9

gabrielcanlas-43275,"Aug 6, 2022",Fake News.,The story is very wrong and is not true at all. I experienced the revolution and saw everything that happened with my own eyes. This movie sugar-coated the exact story and make it look like they were the victims. That is all I can say.,1
reclajennymae,"Aug 8, 2022",Christine Reyes is this movie's only saving grace,"Despite the negative things I have been reading about it, I still watched to see what it for myself. But, from what I've seen, the negativity it is receiving is well-deserved.

Christine Reyes' acting was the only positive thing I saw here. She is good with her portrayal and commands attention everytime she is on screen. The rest of the actors are disappointing. The extras are even better.

The story, indeed, runs contrary to what historical records show. There was an attempt to make the film appear to be a documentary but the lack of empirical evidence/proof as basis made it lackluster. The lousy editing made it even worse. It is like watching short videos woven together. It is not cohesive. And remarkable only for being utterly disappointing.

The musical scoring is weird. The music is ok but feel displaced as some unimportant scenes were heavily scored while the others were left disserviced by a musical scoring.

The direction of Mr Yap is also lackluster. The costumes and makeup were acceptable, but not noteworthy.

Overall, I think it will be better if they just showed it for free in youtube or other platforms for it is not worth paying good money for in cinemas. If, as the critics say, it is a tool for propaganda, then make it free for viewing. Leave the cinemas for actual movies worth they money we pay for it.",2

ecstasticlady,"Aug 6, 2022",The Other Side of The Story GONE WRONG,"As someone who has an open mind when it comes to politics, this film really made me see how distorted the POV of the other side. This film really aims to justify and victimized the family by making them appear too good and genuine to the point that it is not realistic anymore and is already trying hard. There's a lot of inconsistencies that I can't help but shake my head during a lot of frames.

I really can say this film is really not good in terms of artistic expression and direction. Acting-wise, most of the main actors are stiff and boring. I do not know if their script intentionally wants them to portray the roles like that or they are just terrible actors.

Overall, if you are someone trying to understand the ""other sides of the story"" as the people market this film, this junk is not really the best material. One word explanation: BIASED. I am aware that the supporters of this family are mad as hell for biased pieces but this movie is indeed one of those. Well, I don't wonder why they are not raging on this one since it is something that is what they want to believe.

josephinewillard,"Aug 6, 2022",The film was boring and full of crap. Entirely a lie from start to finish.,"Free movie stubs were given to us by some friends therefore, although I hated the thought of watching the movie, I came in to watch it with a friend. We were stuck watching the film just so we can sit on something.

First of all, don't believe these people giving this piece of crap positive reviews, these are people the director himself asked to review the movie and rate it with the highest score. The truth is, this movie was made to distort Philippine Marcos regime history. The movie clearly depicted an unlikable Cory Aquino ( Marcos' rival to the Presidential post ) to feed people with a false belief that Cory was the "" antagonist"" and the Marcoses we're victims of treachery and oppression of the Filipino people. The truth is, the director of this film is a friend to the Marcoses and he was paid to create a fictional version of the Marcoses story of the last 72 hours of them in Malacanang before they flee to the U. S. by force, as the Philippines had enough of their atrocities, corrupt administration and the poverty they left the country with due to their incapacity to lead the country to progress. The people had enough of them and they were attacked by the people after 2 decades under Martial Law.

The movie showed a Cory Aquino playing mahjong with some nuns while the Philippines was at war with the Marcoses. I mean, Would anyone ever think of playing mahjong while their lives are in danger and their country's state is uncertain? I don't think anybody will have the nerve to even sleep peacefully at a certain point, all the more, these people depicted to be playing mahjong are nuns and the late President Cory. This movie even managed to disrespect the nuns who brought Cory Aquino to hide with them while the Marcoses were hunting her. The movie made them seem as if they were uncaring at the time of crisis. The scene was senseless, blasphemous and laughable, as if the director tries so hard to degrade the nuns and ruin the name if the late President on purpose.

It also showed the Filipinos during the late 80's in the most advance city in the Philippines, mind you, holding torches while attacking the Malacanang Palace. What kind of activists in their sound mind would rally to the Presidential palace and while holding torches and in the late years of 1980's? Really torches in the 1980's? And people from the city in that time, holding them torches? What a funny fart ignorance of a movie this is. I don't know whether to laugh at the scene or just leave lol.

Had I known it was this ridiculous, I would have given my ticket to someone else. The movie was very inaccurate, provocative and utterly a dismay, a laughable senseless depiction, or fictionalization of characters, events and the entire history at the Marcos regime. A waste of our time.",1

There is always two sides to every story ever told, Filipino people have been taught to only observe and understand one side of every story and that is to hate Marcos.

I had to give it to Cristine and Cesar, they are really great actors. For actually a simple film, their acting is still consistent from all their award winning movies. Ruffa's transformation to IRM is on point. I was hoping though she could've given more lines or scenes. But nonetheless, the film is not that bad.

To many lies were written about their leaving and only the stories of the powerful during that time were written and was heard. But, this time that the Marcoses came back to public service and that their long hidden story can be finally heard, this flick can be one of the strongest ways to tell the Marcoses' side of the story.

Not everything that was written in our History about the Martial Law was the truth, our history, the international media, and Uncle Sam has badly tainted the Marcos family name and they were never given a chance to really explain their story for the past 36 years. No historical revisionism was done in this movie. The movie is factual and very entertaining to watch.

I was disappointed that there was no ""historical revisionism"" in the movie, just like what is exploding now in social media saying the film is trying to revise history. The film only revolves around the story of the Marcos family, the people, and what is happening inside the Malacañang during the 1986 People Power Revolution. The actors were great! Christine Reyes was so damn awesome actress! Surely, the movie proved that Imee is a badass. Hahaha I was surprised that Ella Cruz's acting was great, too! The dramatic scenes can be heavy, so I suggest you bring tissue or hanky. I was preventing myself to wipe my tears at first, but when I saw other people sobbing unashamedly, I didn't stop myself. LOL I love that Director Darryl Yap added some comedy scenes to the film as a breather for the heavy drama. I enjoyed the film and I think it was also appreciated by the people who watched it, because the cinema in SM Aura where we were in exploded in applause after the film ended. I even heard people say, ""Ang galing!"" ""Shocks, ang ganda."" while clapping their hands. Awesome movie! Watch it, and leave a review only after you did so. ;)",10

THE OTHER STORY OF THE EDSA REVOLUTION WAS EXPOSED IN THIS MOVIE AND IT WAS THE BEST PLATFORM FOR THE FILIPINO PEOPLE TO LEARN TO LOOK FOR THE TWO SIDES OF THE STORY BEFORE MAKING JUDGMENT.

Imee Marcos and the 3 maids in the film made me laugh even though the scene is very emotional, the 3 of them never fail to put a smile in my face. I love the Retaso part I cried a lot when the ""Traydor na pag-ibig"" was played in the movie. That specific scene made me cry like a baby.

jsanders-02475,"Aug 5, 2022",Great,"The movie MIM is one the films I was curious about. Since it was shot in the 1980s, it gives one a nostalgic effect on the setting and the clothes worn of the actors.

Story wise, this is an account of a maid in malacanang who was never given due wages and recognition (only those who saw the movie can relate to this). It was a moving story of a struggle of the nation's leader yet his vulnerability towards his family.

Imelda Marcos played by Ruffa Gutierrez did not have that much dialogue but portrayed brilliantly with her looks and affection as a mother for her children and the country.

The transition between scenes was fluid. The satirical nature of the director cannot be denied hence, those who have been against this movie would be triggered.

papamyron,"Aug 3, 2022",Don't believe the 1 star ratings. They didn't even watched it and are extremely biased.,"Do not believe the 1 star ratings. They are people who are still experiencing the bitterness of the defeat of their candidate and rating 1 star to a movie they haven't even watched yet. How did I know? Because there's not a glimpse of the ""history revisionism"" as to what they are talking about in the movie. It was just telling the story of what the people inside the titular place had experienced when the Edsa 2 happened. The same narrative that was being told to us over and over like people raiding the palace was there.

Again. The 1 star ratings are just there due to their irrational hate to the Marcos name who is our current president now and also because there's a movie who is supposed to ""counter"" this but not really selling well because that's what these people, the opposition supporters, are. Acts tough on the internet but flakes out on the real thing. Pathetic.",9

swittanytupas,"Aug 5, 2022","The movie that brought Filipinos back to the Cinema. A heartwrenching, untold story of the Marcos family in their last 72 hours of power.","Unfortunately, some reviews of this movie is politicized and given negative reviews by the Marcos haters even before it is shown in cinemas. The movie only started showing in Philippine cinema on August 3rd and it was a blockbuster hit. Tickets were already sold out by August 2, and cinemas had to add another cinema house and slot for people who walked in to watch.

Some reviews are based on their emotions and not about the movie.

Judging by the art of the film, it was made with brilliance. The timing, the plot, the story, even with a lot of conversations was not boring, it was intense and really impacting.

Maid in Malacanang is a heartwrenching untold story of what the Marcos family went through, days before Cory took office.. it's actually more of a drama and comedy film.

No scenes nor script in the film, of the Marcos family bad mouthing the Aquinos.

The plot conveyed unknown details of events but it is left to the viewers how to judge such information given.

It may be more of a personal family story rather than historical, but it will give us a lesson we never knew we were missing.

To me, the film is an opportunity for us Filipinos.

Bring tissues because you will cry, the storyline touches your heartstrings but it is peppered with light humor all throughout brought by the three helpers.

renielsbahian,"Aug 3, 2022",It is an eye opener to those who are bias and selective in Filipino History,"Just watch the movie first and make your comment afterwards. This movie is not an attempt to revise history of the philippines but an attempt suply stories that has been deprived to be heard more than 3 decades ago. It is good to know the the totality of the history before drawing a particular judgment. It is illogical to directly discredit a particular experience of history just because such experience is not popular or not in congruent to what has been accepted. History is not an exclusive per se but an all-inclusive collection of recollected events in the past which undergoes series of scrutiny and validation in consideration of its truthful product. Thus, I think it is time now to listen to the other side of the story first before making your conclusion.

If you are not a Filipino be informed first before drawing your conclusion. Do not be fed with bias media instead go to the Philippines and make your further research. It sounds plausible when you listen to both sides of the story before you make any judgment about Martial Law or the Marcoses.",10

benzxx,"Aug 5, 2022",SINO BA SILA?,"It is not my habit to watch films on the first day they're shown in theaters. Knowing ""Maid in Malacañang"" is viral, popular, and controversial, I knew the cinemas would be packed so I did not make it an exception.

I watched it on the second day yet the theater was still full.

This movie is about a family that Filipinos are used to see on TV and read in newspapers and magazines, but never seen and heard behind closed doors.

This is the first time to see the candid side of the Marcoses and how they dealt with one of the most tumultuous parts of their regime.

The first part had the ""Nosi Balasi"" playing in the background, which made me think of the critics and the detractors that continue to discredit the Marcoses and their supporters through the years.

When you read the lyrics of this song, you'll realize that's exactly how the Marcoses treated their critics in the last 36 years.

I knew this film only presents one of the many perspectives of the so-called People Power Revolution in 1986. As the movie progressed, however, it became evident that two main perspectives are being narrated: those of the ""maids"" or the kasambahays, and that of the other ""maid"" in Malacanang who promised her father to tell their story in due time: Imee Marcos.

Others may disagree with me on this but I see this film more as Imee's perspective of events as the ""panganay"" and as the unpaid ""maid"" in Malacanang, who did her best to give order to chaos and make some of the important decisions for her family during the last 72 hours of her father's regime.

Having watched so many of Imee's vlogs and interviews, I can only imagine what she was like behind closed doors. It was Christine Reyes' portrayal of the character that gives glimpses of Imee's younger self in a way that I believed she was Imee. Christine showed Imee's facets convincingly: she was feisty, a quick thinker, always on her toes, decisive, a multi-tasker, and at times appeared to be a control freak.

The stories of the helpers inside the palace gave me a roller coaster of emotions; but more importantly, they gave the audience an idea of how the Marcoses treated their workers. The fact that the maids could be candid around the president, the first lady, and their children speaks volumes.

They also had accounts that painted the Marcoses as ""just like other good employers"".

One important bit that got me was when the maids showed their furs given by Imelda. The former First Lady told them that they, too, deserved to own furs. This reminded me of what FEM and Imelda often talk about in their writings and interviews: to give dignity to the Filipino people.

Of course, I couldn't help but mentally ""fact-check"" and compare some information in the movie with what I read from books and other publications throughout the campaign period.

The part about mainstream media spreading fake news that the Marcoses had already left Malacanang when they were still in the palace can be found in Paul Goldstein's article in EIR Journal dated July 25, 1986.

There was also the bit about Cory winning the elections based on NAMFREL's tally and FEM winning based on COMELEC's tally. You can find this info in Cecilio Arillo's book, A Country Imperiled and Rigoberto Tiglao's book, Debunked.

The part where the people at EDSA headed to Radio Veritas can be found in Paul Goldstein's article in EIR dated July 15, 1986

There's also something I noticed that's unique in this film that I don't see often in other Filipino films: the art of long takes.

A ""long take"" is a shot that's intended to appear as a single, uninterrupted take in the final edit of a film.

I thought this was interesting as it made the scenes appear more intimate. Long takes can draw you closer to the scene. At times, I felt transported into the story as if I were there in the moment with the characters, but as a silent and invisible observer.

As the camera gracefully glided from one angle to another, the drama and tension became more palpable. That's because long takes mimic the real-life scenarios of freely moving through space and time while expressing feelings of agony, confusion, and fear.

I jokingly posted yesterday on Facebook: ""Who wrote the screenplay, Direk? Because it was attempting to make me cry.""

And I did cry an ugly cry. Darryl, you're a brilliant writer. I felt the suffering, the confusion, the hopelessness, and the shattering of the souls of the characters.

The simplest of lines can turn those who are hardened into misty-eyed. You will identify something very personal in your own life with a line, a scene, a character, or a moment in this movie. I am not sure anyone could have written the screenplay any better as you did.

Another thing that I liked about this film is there were almost no actions and no special effects -- just a family and their staff talking to one another sometimes in a group, sometimes just between two people or among the family members. It's the simplicity of it that highlights its sentimental edge with dialogues so movingly performed.

You'll probably never find the stories of these characters in any publications mainly because they chose to remain quiet for decades or maybe they were not given the chance to air their side.

While others will most likely question the accuracy of the narratives in this film, no one should invalidate them especially when these perspectives come from characters who LIVED inside Malacanang for several years.

Like I said several times in my previous posts, there are hundreds or even thousands of ways to narrate an event depending on who is telling it.

Maid in Malacañang is about the perspectives of those inside the palace at the time when the opposition and the people on EDSA also crafted their own stories to tell.

All perspectives are valid, especially of those who were in the same rooms as the president of the Republic These perspectives are pieces that help complete a puzzle that perplexed the nation for decades.

The movie did not negate exiting perspectives at all. In fact, perspectives should be looked at and treated separately without prejudice against one another. This is how we understand both sides objectively. This is how we form a more complete picture of an important event in our history.

Maid in Malacañang is about how it makes you feel in the end. This movie makes me feel hopeful as a Filipino because, perhaps, this can help pave the way to national reconciliation so we can finally move on together as one.",10
vinxporlares,"Aug 5, 2022",We are entitled to know the TRUTH!,"We are so excited to watch this film after they released the trailer, and it feels surreal when its 1st showing day (August 3,2022). And after watching the film, here's my analysis why this film deserves to be more recognized.

-the cinematography is lit! Its detailed and will allow you to go back in time when that tragedy happened. It captured every simple details that millennial should be aware of.

-Every character has given time to show its limelight, the ambiance,the script,the emotion,the soundtrack-that made the scene be more extraordinary yet realistic.

-the plot, the story that every fellowmen should know without filter and biased opinion or outlook.

We had so much fun watching the film, with an emotion in balance with witty funny sides of the in -character maids in Malacañang. This film exceeded my expectations and hoping for another part,part 2!

trackerphone,"Aug 5, 2022",THIS MOVIE IS A RESULT OF CREATIVE THINKING AND A WORLD CLASS ART!,This movie is a result of creative thinking and at the same time a work of world class art! It shows how Marcoses lived for the last 72 hours and it opens the minds of everyone what are things they didn't see and realized how loveable and with genuine concern Ferdinand Marcos Sr is to the Filipino people and how he will never or ever wanted to hurt anyone even his enemies. Indeed this movie is not a distortion or revisionism of history but instead this movie courageously shows the hidden truth that all people must see!,10
barredomichael,"Aug 5, 2022",Best Movie ever,Not fan of Darryl Yap Movie but this one is the most best movie ever. Must watch you will know what is the real story of Marcoses.

valdezaryn,"Aug 5, 2022","Indeed, it is a great movie.","Contrary to the claims of the Liberal Party supporters, it contains no historical revisionism. It is a story of a family the Liberal Party supporters are still trying to destroy. However, no matter how they were belittled, no matter how these sick people cursed them, they remained calm and humble. They did not do anything bad to those who ousted them from the Malacañang palace. The movie is all about their last 72 hours of stay in power. It is a story of a family, how they loved and supported each other in their most vulnerable time. They believe in divine justice which I believe was the reason why the people elected the son of the late president Marcos Sr via land slide.",10

melennofrada,"Aug 9, 2022",From someone who ACTUALLY watched the movie,"Good movie showing a different perspective of that 1986 shenanigans in my beloved country. It may trigger emotions in different ways, depending on how you view the EDSA incident. It's understandably a family story. Story is structured enough, but not missing the human factor of the Marcoses. Mini easter-eggs can be found if you actually watch the movie, very subtle but nicely done. Great and gutsy director and actors. Watch it. I would say it's a feel-good movie in some way, and I'm glad that the family gave way and escaped harm for them to be back to tell their side of the story. Nice OST, btw.",10

clydegtuazon,"Aug 5, 2022",Another POV worth telling; the other truth,"The poor rating on here was given days before even the actual movie was premiered. It is mostly because these people where trying to ""protect"" the only truth they wanted to accept that was everything and all against the Marcoses hence the saying ""there are two sides to every coin"" only applies to them and never for the Marcoses.

Now another light is being shed telling the POV/accounts of other witnesses of how things transpired during that moment. It is a whole new information besides the one sided narration being portrayed by the anti-Marcos.

It tackled what was happening for the last 72 hrs inside palace while history was making it's way outside. Acting is pretty darn good and i specially appreciated Cristine Reyes, Cesar Montano, Diego Loyzaga, and Ella Cruz's scenes. Maiiyak ka tlaga. A lot of siblings would really relate to their roles. Yes there are quite a few political POV from their side but that's just a small part of the story since it clearly is a family film. Madadala ka talaga sa actingan nila. By the end of the film you will realize that the Family isn't really a family of pure evil as the yellow/pink cult would want you to believe. They are just as human as we are. Ah oo nga pala they also treated their maids as family.

athenamakou,"Aug 5, 2022","GREAT MOVIE, IT'S HIGH FOR THE MARCOS'S SIDE","From CockyRocky (Facebook page Cocky Rocky, please follow him for all insights)

After military and rebel forces in collusion with the USA and the Catholic Church in the Philippines stole the 1986 snap elections from the democratically elected president, the late Ferdinand E. Marcos, rioters, looters and criminals stormed Malacañang Palace. Darkness swept across the land as a Yellow dictator illegally took over the government.

This was the start of the decline of our country's fortunes. Infrastructure, culture and the arts, agriculture, technology and even education gradually deteriorated due to her government's incompetence and corruption. The departure of the Marcoses signaled the start of our national trials and tribulation.

But. History is not through with the Marcoses.

The story of our country's success, security and prosperity begins again. Two great families - powerhouses, polar opposites and legacies - have come, a son of the North and a daughter of the South. Together, they are electrifying the world with their statecraft.

What a glorious time to be alive, to be a Filipino. Philippine history is upended. The truth and lies which were deviously but masterfully mangled, marbled and warped through the passage of time are now under scrutiny. This is a reckoning. We are fighting not just for our stories today but for everyday that we have lost since the historical revision which began in 1986.

The past - hidden by the hate-filled lies of the academics, the clergy and the media - are finally seeing the Philippine sunrise for the first time. Let it not be dimmed and cowed into obscurity again.",10

Diego did well as Marcos Jr, he delivered his lines excellently and made me cry my eyes out. Ella was a delight to watch, I didn't want to cry at That scene but her emotions were contagious. Rufa was underutilized as Imelda, perhaps intentionally. The 3 maids were funny.

LunaRafaelo,"Aug 4, 2022",An Actual Objective Review of the Movie,"Okay. I am writing this because I just watched it earlier.

First of all, folks, the movie is not ""bad"". You only deem it bad because it portrays the side of the Marcoses.

Second, Have you watched it? Have you actually bought tickets to see the film? If yes, did you watch it for entertainment? Or did you watch it as your source for ""the truth"". Because if you went for the latter, then you're a snowflake and you just proved the other party's point that they can trigger you. Your source of information shouldn't be on what you see on the movies. It's a movie, give everyone a break.

Third, they portrayed the side of the Marcoses. If you think your idea of their own experiences should be followed, then you go make and produce the movie.

Fourth, when did you actually see a Marcos film post 1986? You know, the one that depicts their part of the story, even if it was bad. Was there? Honest question. Because I don't think there ever was. And this was the perfect film for it. Admit it or not, post 1986 we were already bombarded with Anti-Marcos, Pro Aquino, NPA, Martial Law events and victims movies - BUT. NOT. ONE. MARCOS. FILM.

Anyway, here is my take on the movie.

First five-ish ""Chapters"" of the movie went on with no cut scenes. I found this amazing as it shows their mastery of their script and their character.

The build up of the story was slow but entertaining, nonetheless, thanks to the comic of the three maids.

They were obviously pointing out references to defend themselves (Marcoses) which was kind of a smirking moment for me - it wasnt because I doubt them or something but more of a ""Okay they are being defensive on this part but go on.""

The team tried to build up the story by ""Chaptering"" the whole plot which is I think is kind of in the infant stage of Philippine cinema, at least they tried, and I should give credit to them because it was in a unique way of directing/producing the film. Given the fact that our movie industry is falling apart because of the likes of mainstream tweetums drama cliche stories of Cardo Dalisay, Kim Chiu, Vice Ganda and the like.

Feels of the movie could be better. I guess it was just the filter of the picture.

There were scenes of some of news cuts. It was okay for references but again, it could be portrayed/edited better. But nevertheless, the cinematic feels is there.

The torches, the Mahjong, the nuns were better off omitted if possible. But it is their point of view so whether or not these were true, they left it for us to do more research if we wanted confirmation.

Acting: The three maids, were great especially Beverly Salviejo. Great Character!

Ella Cruz was really into it! I thought she's just one of those actresses who was just famous. But no, she can act. And she can perform really well!

Cesar Montano as always has always been a great actor. So thats just it.

Diego Loyzaga needs improvement. I can't wait for his lines to be finished.

Ruffa depicted Imelda just fine. Nothing much engagement with the film.

Finally, Christine Reyes. She went on full beast mode with this one. The acting was just overflowing but I guess that how they wanted to portray her.

Overall, come on guys. It's a film so just watch it. Be objective enough to give where proper credit is due and not just because of Historical Revisionism point of view. It gets old. Compare him to Hitler for all I care, but some of you watched Davinci Code, Hitler movies and Lucifer the TV show. I mean, come on.

P. S. Will watch Katips tomorrow and will leave a reply to that review as well.

Cheers.",10

It has nothing to do with their feared distortiom of history nor revisionism but it is the EDSA 86 orchestratorrs and armed rebels' fear that the Marcoses will no longer become a heartless villain in the Filipino eyes, instead Marcoses are humans they are true FILIPINOS. This movie will make every Filipino think and research about the political players from 86 to present and will make you understand that why there are MARCOS LOYALISTS to this day and why PAMILYANG PILIPINO matters.",10

movienthusiast143,"Aug 5, 2022",SUPERB!!!!! MUST WATCH!!! ❤❤❤,"All those who gave just 1 star to this movie are desperate and obstinate losers who couldn't move on from their 'epic fail' movement last elections. Funny how they'd even spread their bitterness up to a movie review site!!!

BACK TO THE MOVIE...it was absolutely AMAZING!!!!! It's a whole ride of a roller coaster of emotions while watching this movie. You will definitely cry and laugh and get mad and feel all the raw emotions of everyone inside the Malacañang Palace during the last 72hrs of their stay.

DOES IS REVISE PHILIPPINE HISTORY??? DEFINITELY NOT. AS IN BIG BIG ""NO"". It doesn't change a thing about what we already know. The movie is not about showing who's right and wrong. It just showed the chaos and what was happening outside the palace and what was happening INSIDE the Malacañang at the same time. It never discredited any abuses nor any other claims. Instead, it just showed a new perspective and that is what was going on INSIDE the palace while every other thing is happening outside and in EDSA.

DOES IT MAKE PEOPLE SYMPATHIZE WITH THE MARCOSES? DOES IT MAKE PEOPLE SEE THE MARCOSES AS VICTIMS? NO. I don't think it intends to do that either. Everything depends on how every viewer takes everything in. It's an emotionally-packed movie and it just bombards you with everything. It bombards you with their ""truth"", their personal experiences, their emotions. It just literally gives you what these people felt and what they did during those last hours. Now, it's up for the viewers to decide whether or not they'd believe their story.

DOES IT PAINT LATE PRESIDENT CORY AQUINO IN A BAD LIGHT? NO. I don't think so. It just stated a normal reaction from a leader who thinks of Marcos Sr as her enemy. She wants him out of the country and so she did. I won't look at her like she's the bad one just because she wanted Marcos out of the Philippines.

AS FOR THE CONTROVERSIAL MAH-JONG SCENE...IT IS A METAPHOR. It just showed how politicians together with the ""CHURCH"" played their blocks for this EDSA Revolution. PLUS, FILIPINOS ARE NOT STUPID. Of course we know that Cory Aquino is really not playing Mahjong with her pink sisters during time of crisis. It's a given. Not just because we saw in the big screen that late pres. Cory and the nuns are playing means that they're really doing that at that time. We all know what to take as a symbolism, a metaphor and what to take literally.

IN VIEW HERE OF, ALL I CAN SAY IS...MAID IN MALACAÑANG IS A MUST WATCH!!!!! The family is crisis and all the characters are very relatable. Each of the viewers can see themselves in those characters, may it be as a father or mother or sister or brother or even as househelps who have been treated as a part of the family they've served for years. The music is powerful and very on point. The actors are all great!!! The lines are very very impactful especially the last part. No wonder why it will surely be a BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE!!! To everyone, WATCH IT!!!! IT IS ALL WORTH THE HYPE!!! VERY VERY WORTH IT!!!! KUDOS TO EVERYONE WHO MADE THIS MOVIE HAPPEN!!!

P. S CAN'T WAIT FOR PART TWO!!!!!",10

""What are the maids experienced inside the malacañang palace, when black propagandis are trying to ruin the good gernmentment""

Some people rate this as 1 star because they dont want to hear and know the other side of history but they are proclaimimg that they know the truth because they read a book of ""history"" but lack of manners and characters specially to the students who are recruited by the cpp-npa-ndf , as Student Activist against the government .

Some students proclaimimg that this movie is totally history revisionism but they cant afford to buy their tickets on their own to find out ""whats on their side , simce the martial law happened 35 yrs later""

Who will you trust? A Someone that has a ""History Book"" that favors to certain person or Someone who has a actual video footage .

The cinemas are so jam-packed, that viewers would pay again to watch a trilogy or a series. The atmosphere throughout the room is mixed - at one end, you could see people crying in tears, while on the other end, some would burst into laughter.

We already know the victors version of half-baked history and their bias narratives enforced into our books (sic), now, it's time to listen to the Marcoses' actual experiences in their last 72 hrs (and hopefully some more hours or events in the next upcoming movies in the future) before they left the Philippines.

Suggestions: Please bring your family and friends with you because for sure it will be a family bonding of TRUE HISTORY (the Marcoses' history which were deleted, hidden and unpublished by paid yellow historians) and for sure, you will not regret to miss for the world..

The missing piece of history.

The side of the history the yellow propaganda tried so hard to not be heard is finally here.

Witness the last 72hours of the Marcoses as a family inside the Malacañang as they were forced to be removed to power by an angry mob after Marcos won the 1986 snap presidential election on Comelec.

Director Daryl knit the story perfectly with the perfect cast, soundtrack, best cinematography, controversial scenes, metaphors and symbolism and actual footages from 1986!

The enemies of the marcoses finally succeeded of removing President Marcos, thanks to the US government who found President Marcos' usefulness over.",10

arnoldhermosa-40359,"Aug 5, 2022",BEST FILIPINO FAMILY FILM,"Just like what Direk Darryl Yap said, Maid in Malacañang is a family drama. It is a perfect depiction of a Filipino family. It shows what you're willing to do for your family. It shows the length you're willing to go to for them. Every family-oriented and open-minded person will relate to this film -- politics aside.

I'm happy they get to tell their story now. After being deprived of it for 30 years.

Congratulations Direk Darryl Yap, VinCentiments, Senator Imee R. Marcos, and VIVA Films for a BRILLIANT project.

It is not revisionism movie about our history especially during the martial law nor about the EDSA revolution but it is just a flip of a coin or a missing piece of our history told in the eyes of people inside malacañang.

charleensulit,"Aug 5, 2022",My child's POV (History taught on their school),"As a parent born in 1980, I want my children to have their freedom of expression and we respect it because it is their rights. We watched it on the first day of the movie (Aug 3, 2022) so that we can experience the vibe of millions of Filipinos who are hunger for entertainment and excited to go out with their families after 2 years of fear, anxiety brought by pandemic. The movie MiM is a very family oriented movie, that's why it has a rating of PG. And we can assure that it is very understandable and remarkable in the minds of our little ones. Me and my husband together with my youngest (15yr old), really enjoyed our family time - we laugh, react and even hide our little tears while watching the movie. It really touched our hearts as a FATHER to his SON, a SON to his FATHER & MOTHER, a DAUGHTER to her FATHER, and an AMO to their KASAMBAHAYS, we don't even thought of any political motives and it doesn't enter our minds that it was a black propaganda againts the previous administrations after the Marcos regime. I am not a movie expert, but I have eyes to see what is beautiful or not, I have hands that can feel the hands of my child that touched me during scenes that might get her nervous or excited. And I have a heart that can feel the hurt, the fear, and the hopelessness of a family that was betrayed by their so-called friends, allies, supporters and even families. I can relate to that, because I even experienced that in real life. When we got home, I asked my child ""so anak may nabago ba sa history nyo?"" She said ""wala naman po mommy"". And that's from my child's point of view. And that's their freedom! Congrats to the writer and director Darryl Yap.",10

On the other hand, please be aware that most reviews across different websites that has low rating for Maid in Malacañang, esp the earliest ones (when the movie wasn't yet released), are from yellow propagandists. They are the number 1 destabilizer of the government. They are terr0r!$ts, even in online platform (they basically infiltrated twitter in our country). Their main goal is for the world to view Philippines as a lowly country just because their presidential bet/puppet did not won. They want the Filipinos to remain ignorant so they can stay in power.

TO BE CLEAR: Yes I have my own political views and those close to me knows that. BUT, I have and will always respect people even if they have a diff political view with me. Same with their CHOICE of religion, tradition, taste in food, culture etc. THIS MAY have a few politically affected opinion. BUT, it will be MINIMAL AND NOT BIASED SO PLEASE be of the same mindset before reading. IF YOU CANNOT do so, then PLEASE DO NOT READ AND SCROLL DOWN.

This will be about the movie and not what it MAY stand for. OK? Agree? :D

__________

Admittedly, I have a love hate relationship with Darryl Yap's movies. Don't like Pornstar 2, Babaeng Walang Pakiramdam, Revirginized. Indifferent to Gluta, liked Pornstar, liked Jowable alot and truly AMAZED at Tililing. (All of which we have posts of as well) Had high hopes with this one but I really didn't know what to expect.

The story telling part was very well done. Same with the choice of music and scoring. Could have been so flat and boring because it was mostly talking among a few, emphasis on a few characters on a single location with a single topic. BUT, Biday, took control of this movie! There were a lot of powerful scenes and her involvement in those scenes, though actually minor and irrelevant and some made just to lighten the mood was SO ON POINT and FUNNY it made this movie that much more fun to watch! Truly unexpected and caught me off guard that made me laugh so hard.

The cast in general were really good, special mention to Christine Reyes, wow, Cesar Montano, wow, and BEVERLY SALVIEJO, WOW! Ella Cruz had one powerful great scene and hoped she did more.

8 of 10 for me. Was suppose to be a 9 but that cheap shot in the end was distasteful and merits a minus one, even if the telephone conversation (alone) was based on a documented interview. BUT, overall, something worth watching, specially because of Biday :D #wherecollectingisalifestyle.",10

anndrm,"Aug 5, 2022",AN UNTOLD STORY OF A KNOWN FILIPINO FAMILY,"As someone who ACTUALLY WATCHED the film, I believe, It would be better for someone like me (who have watched it) to comment or make a review about it.

The movie has A LOT going on, definitely worth your money. It is an ""untold story of a known Filipino family"", nowhere near how they call it: ""historical revisionism"", but I do agree with revising parts of our history if there is a need to, and clearly, there is.

It is well-made; the acting, the plot itself, the setting, the effects, the props/clothes, everything.

It made me cry and at the same time, it made me laugh. Now, if you'd like to feel the same thing, know the what's happening inside the Palace that time, and know the Marcoses better, watch #MAIDinMALACAÑANG.

Showing now in over 200 cinemas nationwide and SOON worldwide!

Though you know that this movie will be about the last 72 hours of the first Family you will still be shock of what is going to happen. This movie just show how the MARCOSES just like the rest of us are also human- capable of all the hurt- that they too got feeling- that they too were hurt of the event that was happening on them. This movie will give some light to those Bullying their family receives for almost 4 decades.,10
imchristianp,"Aug 5, 2022","IT'S NOT REALLY AN HISTORICAL DISTORTION NOR A BIOPIC, IT'S JUST ALL ABOUT THE LAST DAYS OF THE MARCOSES IN MALACAÑANG DURING 1986 EDSA REVOLUTION","At first, we really thought or expect that it was historical distortion or revisionism of what really happened during the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution. But we've surprised and dissapointed, disappointed because we thought there will be revisionism but they did not have that.

And here's my review about the movie, which is same as the reviews of Mr. Mark Perez Agullana.

Plot.

The movie as the trailer suggested it is about the few days of The Marcoses in Malacañan Palace from the personal account of their household helper or maid and the Maid in Malacañan Senator Imee R. Marcos. By watching this movie, it presented a view I rarely see, read or hear about the Marcoses. Of course, it touched politics but more than that it was a family drama, the other side of the villain most of us do not know through the eyes of those close to him. The story was told with mix of ""truth"" and ""artistic license"". It was fun, laughters and tears. The story was told in a clear simple manner that everyone can easily follow.

Themes and Tone The main theme of the movie for me is family than politics. It was made to entertain and educate as well. It is easy to spot on the funny and entertaining jokes inserted in the movie. It is also highlighting and presenting what are the obvious in politics and life - traitorship, allyship, trust, honesty, doing what is right, doing what is good, family connection, friendship and other values. But most importantly, it highlighted the most important unit of the society, the family and its importance especially in difficult times. It tells the importance of making up a decision and acting on it.

There are many symbolisms in the film like the conversation between Bonget and Imelda and how they will be able to return to the Philippines and to the power, great use of imagination. And of course, the most controversial scene of Cory played by Giselle Sanchez. That closing scene and the statement are great show of how Politics and Religion are playing the lives of many Filipinos, the fate of the nation and its wealth while they are lucky for having a seat of power. Until today this is true, in every election and important bills being pushed in the congress.

Acting and Characters I like how each character played their roles. Still, Cesar Montano is Cesar Montano. From Muro Ami to this film. I am thinking how difficult it maybe for Diego Loyzaga to act with his father. Great scene. I wish I have a conversation with my father on important matters in my life. I feel like ILoveRuffaG is not Ruffa with her like x100 very slow movement in the movie. But I like how she potrayed Imelda with so much grace, beauty and elegance. She is really different from who she really is. She matched and gave justice to the role. Ella Cruz is okay. Not too much, not less. But she really did great in her scene with Cesar convincing the father to move out. The three maids were really good. Karla Estrada and Beverly Salviejo were very funny in their scene which gave a balance to this dramatic movie. It was not OA. Of course, Christine Reyes who played the very important role, showed in the movie the acting you expect from her.

Direction Daryll Yap's signature story telling was very evident in the movie. It was simple, not complicated, not too fast and not to slow directing. It was almost a straightforward story telling with symbolisms in a funny way. There was a little tension.

Score The music chosen for each scene were matched perfectly to build the emotions and connect to the characters and story. I like the song choice.

Cinematography The camera movement especially during long walks of Imee is bit shaky, maybe budget or I am not certain if that was intentional. The various shots and angle were good. It is comparable to mainstream films at low budget. I like how the camera was moving in circular motion changing the position of the characters of Bonget and Imelda while they were talking. It depicted how their lives were turning up side down. The lines, the shot, the movement and acting were aligned. All actors were framed properly.

Production Design The costumes and props were good. They matched with the story, the setting and the characters.

Special Effects There's not much special effects used in the movie except the sound effects which are okay.

Editing The film was cleanly edited. The flow is consistent. The transitions used are very simple but effective alongside with the effects and music.

Pace The pace is neither slow nor fast. It was enough. Each scene is not dragging and arranged properly. It was like small episodes of the usual vincentiments film and combined as one.

Dialogue There are conversations that I really feel not needed and the movie will stand still. Oh well, there is really a good script.

Lessons There are many lessons you can take from the movie. It presented an alternative view of the existing truth about the freedom we are enjoying today. Does it change the way I view EDSA, Cory, FEM, Ramos, Juan Ponce Enrile, the Nuns, the Martial Law victims, the truth, the democracy and others? No. It just reaffirmed what I am already believing about FEM, Cory, Ramos, Johnny, the Marcos Family, the Aquino Family, the Nuns, the Martial Law Victims, the EDSA Rallyists and the Filipino People - they are all human beings neither good nor bad. That good or bad outcomes are based from each person's decisions and actions. The movie was good, but I expect more next time.

PS. Indeed, the crowd went applauded after watching the movie. I just want to understand those person who are full of hatred in this movie even the truth is always truth. And this kind of movie, was made from the creative minds and imaginations. Their situations are believable, but the drama or act? Hehehe only they know the truth.

Little spoiler: The Mahjong scene does have POWERFUL MESSAGE.",10

Review: Overall the movie was great. I don't usually watch tagalog movies for the simple reason that I think it is not original or the story is not new. This movie is different and it is very interesting. Seeing how other people close to the Marcos Family felt and reacted during those times was indeed somehow refreshing. I would highly recommend this movie for those who haven't gone out because of the pandemic and see it in the big screen.

Congratulations Daryl Yap and the Movie's Cast and Crew for a great movie. Thank you! We will be waiting for your next movie.",10
PepeRep,"Aug 9, 2022",Thought-Provoking and Superb,This is a powerful film that is leading the changing landscape in Philippine politics after decades. The long takes are superb - kudos to the actors! Cinematography is delightful down to the details. Some of the script do not necessarily reflect language from the 80s but that is a minor issue and could be forgiven. I believe this is achieving its goal of artistically providing a venue for national conversation on the recent history of the Filipino people by capturing testimony from the other side in the interest of fairness.,9

dimayugasc,"Aug 6, 2022",Nothing to be scared of!,"This is a story of a family in the middle of a crisis. It is very relateable, especially for the Filipino families. Full of drama and comedic acts with the FEM members and staffs. The 3 yayas are so perfectly balanced. Love the musical score. A lot of details in the movie are well placed, may be intentionally symbolic and/give credence to what really happened back then. I also love the use of video clips of news/interview footage.

That's why it made me wonder why a lot of noise is going on about historical revisionism. I am not a political analyst, but I think it's all just an automatic reponse to anything 'Marcos', that they are evil people, as what their mantra for so many decades has been.

I highly recommend you watch the movie and judge it for yourself.

I enjoyed it very much - tears and laughter, and emotions abound. Kudos to Dir Darryl Yap and team! At least the Philippine Cinema is alive again!",10

jayltan,"Aug 8, 2022","Your political opinions are better said and heard in elections, not here.","A family in crisis trying to come to terms with events unfolding during a tumultuous time in history. The film, despite patently baseless allegations of ""historical revisionism"" by spineless critics, and farce, inorganic ""reviews"" by those seeking to resuscitate their defunct and decaying political capital, provides insight into the untold final moments of the Marcos family in Malacañang during the 1986 EDSA protests. No material misrepresentation of ""known"" historical facts were made in the film. I encourage you to see Maid in Malacañang for yourself to see how laughable and immature its film critics are. I should have rated this 9 stars myself but i have to compensate for the irrational and politically-charged reviews. I just have minor concerns over lighting of some scenes, but overall, the film is superb: a fitting opening salvo to the reopening of Philippine cinemas after the pandemic.",10

This film made us cry, laugh, cringe, hate and love. All the actors were excellent in portraying their roles, most especially the Maid in Malacanang.

I love how the story unfolded in chapters, more like so when you are reading a book, and I got to appreciate how each title was artistically appropriate. The development of the drama and the timing of the humor were perfect. It can be published in a book and can be even made more powerful in a theater production.

This movie made me appreciate my family even more and it reminds people how love and family can make us strong despite the pain and the difficulty.

shaest2013,"Aug 6, 2022","Thought-provoking, remarkable, and hilarious - overall, entertaining!","I'd say 99% of the low rating reviews that the movie received came from people who have not watched the movie, I'll tell you why after I share my honest and objective review of the one of the most popular and controversial Filipino movies of 2022.

Most of these people are saying the movie twisted the usual narrative and that it revised the history by peddling lies about the Marcoses. The person who'd say just that is being too dramatic and is most likely a god who's all knowing of what actually happened inside the house and the minds of the Marcoses during the last 72 hours of its dynasty.

No one can really tell you what exactly happened in the last 72 hours as every person's perception of an event that took place in the past has his/her own version of that event. Say you interview 10 people from a single event, each one of those participants may have different version based on his/her perception, views, and beliefs. Hence, you can't say someone else's testimony or version of an event is ""false"" or ""wrong"". There is no absolute right or wrong - what's right for you may not be right for others, do not be all too self righteous.

However, this movie in particular is truly controversial as the movie apparently did not put the Marcoses in the bad light, which is something new to most people given how this last name is notorious for being the worst of the worst kinds of people - only if social media existed during the Marcos dynasty, back then, it was easy for powerful people to twist the minds and realities of the masses.

The theater in Cebu (SM Seaside) where I watched was i'd say was about 95% full, and the movie received a round of applause upon reaching the credits. If that doesn't make a movie good for you, then I do not know what is. Again, what's a good movie for you may not be good for the others viewers, and that's alright. As always, watch the movie before you rate it.",10

noemicudiamat,"Aug 5, 2022",Two thumbs up,"Don't be fooled by the. Snowflake dilawans' review of this movie. Not only do they have no intention of seeing the movie (yet rated it low anyway) but they got so excited rating it ahead of its official theater release. That alone gives you a clue as to what kind of people this group are.

The movie is not an ""attempt"" to ""revise history"" or to ""distort"" it. The movie is simply a glimpse of how the Marcoses handled their situation inside Malacanang Palace as EDSA ""people power"" was going on outside their gate. It's how they struggled through the ordeal individually as a son/daughter, as a father, as a mother, as member of the extended family (the maids), and how they handled it as a family as well.

Sure there were scenes that can be thought of as provocative. They can be seen as a swipe to Cory and those who masterminded and staged PP but they were very few and far in between. Besides, the movie itself caters to a specific audience. It's for those who are sympathetic to the Marcoses so it's to be expected that it will play to its audience.

Anyway, this is more of a family drama more than anything else. It humanized the Marcoses. And it was done in a way that it did.not completely absolved them nor completely glorified them. Honestly, I don't know where the fear is coming from.

Anyway, it's refreshing to see a Filipino movie that is different from the usual.

This film can pioneer a revolution in the industry. Our films should abandon the usual movie formula of loveteams, sampalan, predictable plot and storyline, very heroic and purely good protagonist and the pure evil antagonist. This movie used a lot of symbolism, there are character development even within that short span of time.ive not seen this done in most of our movies.",10

I found 2 things, (1) the movie is great, the dramatic parts made me teary-eyed and the funny moments are really funny af, and (2) Anti-Marcos people are, I think, are over-reacting and/or haven't watched the film yet.

The Cinema is almost full which is nice, haven't experienced that in a while.",10

There was the question that the truth prevail,the hidden truth that the Marcoses real felt about there 72 hours in Malacanang it will move you.

beth_gray-65315,"Aug 6, 2022",Highly recommend,"Excellent acting by all major and minor characters Perfect casting Brilliant script writing Superior directing I personally did not see anything offensive directed against the opposition or the Aquinos, in particular. On the other hand, I was very impressed by how Darryl Yap was able to put together a film for the ages where any unbiased Filipino can actually appreciate. It's a movie about the struggles of a family that was being forced out of their home. It was a moving experience from start to end and that is why I highly recommend it.",9
RomeroKay,"Aug 5, 2022",Martial Law- the other side,"The movie revolves around the last 72 hours of the Marcos family in the Malacañang Palace.

The story depicts the unspoken side of the Marcos family who were painted monsters by the yellow democracy. Many revelations were shown in the movie which are not known to many Filipinos and strikingly, despite the fact how the Marcoses have been terribly persecuted, they have maintained their quiescence for the longest of time.

The transition of the story were stitched neatly and simply and these have made some gray areas clear.

The actors portrayed their roles effectively. One can related well with the characters especially the maids.

Musical scoring have matched the emotions of every scene. I laud well the arrangement of Nosi Balasi. It sounded really a dark past.

But I still have a few questions in mind that were not shown in the movie that I think will turn the tides and I hope to see it in the next two parts (because this is a trilogy)

1. Why did FEM stay long in power?

2. Who assassinated Ninoy Aquino?

For the open-minded viewers, this will movie is like a missing puzzle piece but for critics and yellow apologists, this will be a trashy kind of movie.",10

jamesjl-22141,"Aug 14, 2022",Great acting & directing. Overall a great film!,"The audience laughed & cried. The Marcoses are well-loved by ""kasambahay"" (maids), farmers, guards. They treat them like their own family; with respect and dignity. This movie is well-acted. Great casting! I always thought Sen. Imee Marcos is a wiser politician than PBBM.

The three maids will make you laugh & cry. I'm glad to see Yaya Biday (played by Beverly Salviejo) was able to see her family (The Marcoses) back.

I know Manang Lucy (Played by Elizabeth Oropeza) is happy because Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Was way ahead in the survey (60%) back in MARCH 2022.

Yaya Santa (played by Karla Estrada) - her pictures in Malacañang show she is a very happy person. She's treated well. She must have been heart broken after what happened.

Just watched it August 7, 2022 at SM Molino. I can say that the story is clear and can be easily understood by viewers. The last 72hrs of the Marcoses inside the Malacanang Place is being shown with actual footages as well. So where is the history distortion here really? There are proofs, video proofs and yet you insists we are blind by the truth you are trying to feed us by saying ""Let me educate you.""

Back to the movie. You will laugh and cry, mostly cry while watching the movie.

And who would question if its a good movie or not? Right after showing the credits, you know what we people did in the cinema before we all stood up to leave, we clapped! That goes to show we loved the movie! That is the truth of the 72hrs of the Marcoses in the palace.",10

Also watched a lots of film and documentary about Cory, Ninoy Aquino Assassination and many more. And for 36 years never heard the side of the MARCOSES. I would like to hear their sides of the story that's why I watched the film.

The movie was all about the family experiences on their last 72 hours in the Malacanang. How they feel losing power and find ways to survive the chaos which is happening around them.

NOTHING WAS REVISED. IN THE HISTORY.

The casts was brilliant. Each chapter was made with excitement, full of emotions and will make you cry.

jcomaoay,"Aug 9, 2022",Excellent Family Movie,"This movie is far from being political as what many would comment without even attempting ro watch it. If you are a moviegoer such as myself, you would know that the movie is actually more inclined to portray the strughles of a family being pinned down by a political war. There are scenes that are predictable but there were many that will catch you off guard. Watching it is a roller coaster of emotions. One minute, you are laugjing, then sad, then in the verge of tears and next thing you know a comedic line will be thrown out unexpectedly to make the audience laugh just as they are about to cry. Truly a wonderful emotional masterpiece. I would have preferred more from a few of the cast but to make the audience know and want more after watching is the beauty of a film. It makes you excited and anxious to know what comes next.",10

(2.) The transition of the 1986 clips are very smooth.

Acting-wise: (1.) It's a mix of comedy and emotional scenes.

(2.) The acting is very well portrayed, it's mostly accurate, the way they talk, they move, they dress.

Overall, NO DISTORTIONS in this movie. NO REVISIONISM OF HISTORY. It is just plainly telling a story.

It was merely showing things, as they unfold, through the eyes of the accused. They also showed footage and published interviews that backed-up the statements made by the characters. This movie opens up a lot of things for discussion and further examination. History, the same with any scientific claim, must react and change according to new evidence discovered, submitted or unearthed.

And thus prejudice is because of who thus movie is portraying. But for me i base my rating on what i had watched and how much i enjoyed it. It's a great movie overall it has a lot of moment that will make you cry especially if you picture yourself in their shoes. I enjoy laughing and crying at every funny and sad scene during the movie. Some say it is historical distortion but as far a i have watched they even included video footages from that period to backup the scenes. For me the most memorable part of the movies is near the end where they try to leave malacanang. It shows how protesters jumped over the palace gates in an attempt to hurt/""oust"" them. That is not historical distortion because that really happened. There are video footage of that and it was also included in the movie. I just hope that people don't just make rating here because they are againts the people being portrayed.

immisscym,"Aug 8, 2022",Worth the watch - For open-minded viewers,"It's a family drama with an excellent pinch of comic relief. Contrary to the ""hate"" it's getting from those who have not really watched it due to political leaning, this movie did deliver on entertainment value.

The actors performed surprisingly well. From the extras, ""maids"" and to the lead roles, kudos. Story telling was smooth and editing was masterfully stitched. Soundtrack, hands down. The director really made an effort to tell the story without pretense. It was raw.

Was there a historical revisionism? I didn't think so. My father had personal accounts of the ML and the story was already ingrained in me since childhood. So I think, (at least to my perspective) that this story was something else.

In the cinema, I do hear people being emotional from some scenes. Seeing some audience nearby my seat, trying to wipe their tears. I was also one of those. I was actually moved not because of the characters itself but on how the director and the actors made the story relatable to common people - family. It does make you realize how important it is to learn from experiences and that it's always wise to listen to your parents. Love - is the primordial factor of survival.

If some people wouldn't think about the baggage of what this movie is all about, then I think it deserve better scores.",10

mirfam,"Aug 7, 2022",For Those Selfish and Arrogant People Giving 1/10,"Karma will surely get you one day.

The movie doesn't have anything to do with historical revisionism nor fiction like what others are trying to say selfishly just to bring down the image of a family or certain people.

The movie is mainly about what the people in Malacañang felt specifically the Marcos family during their last 72 hours there. Don't they have the right or at least the freedom to tell their side of the story that never been heard or fairly listened to since the past 30+ years? I thought the opposition love to scream the word ""freedom"" every rally? After all these years, why not ask ourselves who are the real dictators and threat to the country?

It seems that those people saying history distortion or history revisionism(those giving 1/10 for obvious selfish reason) didn't watch the movie yet. They gave review just to drag the movie down. For sure many anti-Marcos trolls will rate the movie 1/10 and yeah, that's just how sad and selfish some of them.

They claim to be the victims of Martial Law that sounds to know everything when they speak but can't accept or at least respect the other side of the coin.",10

This is the story of a family,their grievances, and their vulnerability when they were betrayed by the people they fought so hard for.

The Philippines is riddled with brainwashed dafts who thinks they know everything and forcing their version of truth to us,the public,but their reign ended in 2016.

The film is visionary,a testament of people who witnessed that era that was silenced by the mainstream media. If you really want to know what's the real status or heart of the Filipinos,look at 31M Filipinos who voted for the Marcos presidency this 2022.

entenabryansmdcsales,"Aug 5, 2022",Imperfectly perfect.a MASTERPIECE!,"How should I put it?

Owh,way back 1986, EDSA people power took place and as a result,the Marcos family and the late President Ferdinand Marcos have nothing to do but to stepback and surrender the presidency.

Since then, the Victor's,Aquino administration, with all her allies continue to run the country and start their own side of history from that day. Sell the biggest government owned electricity establishment to private,change the Manila International Airport to her late husband's name, confiscating and freezing all the Marcos wealth, file hundreds or thousand of cases about the family which in Hawaii,the time wherein Ferdinand Marcos is already dying. His only request was to go back to the Philippines and die here,but the Aquino refused!

For the past 36 years, none of the Marcoss tries to tell what happened that day or have the chance to just discern their side.

I've just read about the unfortunate story in the book. It was taught in elementary,secondary and a little in college about Martial Law. Believing that the Marcos are evil and Martial law is nothing but a shackles to every Filipino.

Then the internet rise.

Iam now 37 years old, little by little,I'm questioning myself. Is the story about the EDSA and Martial law are correct,creditable and factual?

I started searching. Books by books. Article by article.

Then I realized, the history about it,which I've known since elementary was just a piece of trash.

I was living in a factual lies!

2016,BBM(Ferdinand Marcos Jr.) run the Vice Presidential seats but lost. From then on, I told to my self that I will support them. Not because what I have learned about them,but on what they can do in order to lead the Filipino people.

6 years gone past and he run again but for the highest post. And tremendously won the heart of 31m Filipinos by landslide. Why? Because he received more trampled trash from the past, tons of bashing, humiliation and unhuman forbearance by those who supported and believe that EDSA is worthy and the Aquino are saints that time.

After the election,2022, one movie becomes controversial. The Maid in Malacañang is a story of the last 72 hours of the Marcos family inside the presidential palace. They are also human who cries when experience heartbreak, who gets upset,who feel disappointment, who feels anger and hatred. They are also a typical family in different status in life,but they are human.

Those who believe in the people power said that the movie will revise the history.. IT'S A BIG NO You better watch it first then if there's any of the clip or scenes distorted the history, then email me and let's have some healthy argumentation about that. It's not a biopic and documentation movie. It is a story on what happened to them inside the Malacañang palace from the last 72 hours of their reign.

I rated it 9/10 it is. It needs to more justified. The other side of the coin must be heard and watched,not to change the history but they deserved to be heard. Even in the court. The judge weigh both sides.",9

jodemailer-net,"Aug 6, 2022",Redeeming 30+ years of damage,"I have lived my life from the very start of martial law and I am now approaching my senior years.

All along, I already knew the stories portrayed in this movie so none of these are new or surprising to me since I have followed these events in 1986 on tv, radio, newspapers and further reading.

And yet, I just have to shed tears for myself and my fellow Filipinos while watching Maid in Malacanang.

Great acting, story telling and directing. We can all relate to this movie if we watch it with an open mind and no political baggage.

Bottomline for me, if I were to categorize it, is that this is a movie about a family in the eyes of a family member and extended household who were in the throes of revolutionary hopelessness and filled with drama (not sensational or over the top like what we see in our soap operas) and light comic relief.

The soundtrack was equally moving and has been dwelling in my mind, rent-free.

Those 30+ years, sad to say, were wasted time for what could have been a truly great nation of and for the Filipinos.

Damage has and will continue to be done to the mindset of Filipinos from mind-conditioning and brainwashing by schools, the communists, the catholic church and the biased mainstream media which are still controlled by oligarchs and US puppets.

They have done this for the last 50+years and has institutionalized this bias since 1986.

These evil collusions will continue to wreak havoc if we don't deepen our understanding of the true state of this nation and the forces that are acting against the common good of the Filipinos.

I don't see any attempt to revise history.

Story was told as it happened from first hand experience and personal perspectives.

The movie serves its purpose in broadening the mindset and consciousness for nation building.

With Knowledge, Understanding and Unity, Filipinos will rise to true greatness.

It was how they were betrayed by close friends and relatives and a political party that hitched a hike with the American Government to KIDNAP President Ferdinand Marcos and family. History has painted the Marcos family as a dictator, inhuman and corrupt. The opposition also used religion to distort a predominantly catholic country in asia to protest against the ruling Marcos. In effect the 1986 People Power revolution was a peaceful process of power grabbing of the Cory Aquino presidency. Marcos could have stirred a cicil war, but instead left against his will peacefully.

plukcharlotteleetan,"Aug 9, 2022","Emotion-triggering, tears and laughter","Despite all the fuss about this film, I went to watch it with an open mind. It could go either way but it did not disappoint. I liked that the movie was broken down into chapters. I liked the dynamic of the family, it's just like a normal family who goes through traumatic events. I mean, how is it not traumatic when there are so many death threats. The pacing is easy to digest, I love the details that were of the era. 👍

The biggest take away I have is that, not everything is as media portrays it. Which is very rampant even to this date. It only solidifies all the stories I heard from my 79 year old father who lived and thrived. He always shared stories of life back in the day. The narrative over the past 34 years have been the same, it's old and tired. The narrative has been broken. I think it's high time to hear the other side, which is weird because there are a few who are against it? Why? Even during a trial, there's prosecution and defense. We werent allowed to hear the defense side of things, it's due time to hear the other side. Also, if those years were truly the worst of the times, how come some of the very crucial hospitals that were made then are still very useful these days? What's even more boggling is that those who wished to overthrow then president and promised better lives for Filipinos did the exact opposite of what they promised the people? How come instead of making our lives better it became stagnant and even went downhill? Where is the improvement they promised? Heart center, lung center, and kidney institute were not improved and there werent any creation of additional public hospitals like those anymore. Those facilities that were built in that ""dark era"" are still functional to this date. Overrun as they are, they help the common citizen. These are some of the things that broke the opposing narrative. We refuse to be led to believe the holier-than-thou narrative. It's overused and tired. The hypocrisy is blatant and we no longer stand beside it.

The movie showcases amazing acting from very good artists, it'll trigger so many emotions in the audience no matter your age or sex. At the end of the day, it is an imagining of the last 72 hours in Malacañang in 1986. It is a movie, democracy is for everyone not for a select few. This movie should be watched those who bash it have an alternate agenda and it's petty.",9

atsharamusic,"Aug 6, 2022",I Didn't Like It But Definitely Entertaining,"So what are my thoughts about Maid In Malacañang.

This is a non paid review for this film.

Unlike trolls who reviewed this film and gave this bad marks without watching it.

So to start.

I don't like it. But read along before you attack with torches and hurl insults.

Here are reasons why. (Warning : Few Spoilers)

This is not a historical movie. If you want to see something stronger, then watch Brocka's banned movie or actual news footage. Not a movie told from the perspective of the producer, the director or the award giving bodies.

If you are expecting a revisionist movie like dispelling rumours about the Marcoses excesses and opulence, this is not for you. It doesn't hide their wealth and their control of people around them - from the luxury-wearing zero-gravity moving Imelda, to the scary bossy angered Imee, the party going camou-wearing brave-wanting Bonget. No sugar coating here - they are revealed as spoiled people.

It doesn't portray the Marcoses as the bravest souls as they show here how they spiraled to their fears and frustrations, the latter shown by former President FEM himself. If you are expecting them to be portrayed here as a blameless hero family, they aren't as even Irene

It doesn't show the Marcoses as the most powerful family in the country as they too failed to save their entire extended household (meaning those who lived long with them in the palace). The mahjong scene that irked many before the actual showing revealed the figures who were more powerful, and I emphasize, were as it is passe. And it is not the one who sat at the mahjong table but the bigger entity some tried to represent mockingly.

It didn't show the atrocities during Martial Law nor it depicted further the evil side of many politicians some have come to worship for decades. Nor did it tackle the roots of what made Martial Law to be declared.

It didn't utilise more some actors like Elizabeth Oropesa, the controversial Ella Cruz and even the most hated actress now for portraying the symbolic yellow wearing saint, Gieselle Sanchez. I feel like some scenes really got stolen much by the superb timing and acting of Beverly Salviejo aka Manang Biday.

But it did reveal some things that would make more people ponder, especially with the ""what ifs"". Highly entertaining as was the movie, I am left with questions after seeing it as the pieces still don't feel complete. With many puzzle pieces hidden before like actual video clips of how the palace was stormed and yes, burned (as there are actual reports to such in the news), the actual announcements to join EDSA uprising (I wish they put recordings of those actual announcements of Sin calling the faithful), to the big reveal for some that Marcoses were aimed to be killed by friends and some organised people, I can't help but ponder is the running time enough for film or is this better a series?

Some things are made clear here though.

First, and I won't be apologetic. This is a middle finger movie to Ramos who died days before the movie was shown. Maybe he chose to die before his humiliation can be revealed that he was indeed part of planners to kill off the first family. I know BBM paid respects but the Maid in Malacañang didn't and I understand her for that.

This is also a big middle finger movie to family and friends who betray us for politics. Darryl never shies away from controversy and arguments. With the 2022 election campaign being hailed as the most toxic we experienced (and maybe the worst of all time). The lines hit hard that you eat on the same plate with people who wish you dead. Sadly, toxicity is shared on the plate.

This is not a hate film though. In fact, it is a beautifully crafted melodrama with light touches of humor and reference to 80s, to telenovelas and even PRRD's expletives. The music was superb, the pacing mostly on point but always easy to follow and the acting delivered credibly by everyone in the main cast. If Cesar Montano and Beverly Salviejo don't get awards here, we know some directors probably thought to award it to someone else and found their own reflections.

Darryl also is masterful in creating memorable lines like how he delivered with his notoriously popular LenLen series. My dad kept repeating some of the lines he remembered and I of course love villains so you know whose I remember the most. Add the symbolisms, references and mild swearing he put may look or sound cliche for some but those are reminders that this movie is not perfect nor the people shown in it. It doesn't lie like others hailing their own as absolute truth and true masterpiece that must be seen again (and I say again as not much watched the first run, it wouldn't earn either with a re-run if not put side by side with Maid in Malacañang). It doesn't lie that it is not without creative liberties meant to stir emotions at almost every chapter as they hit the right nerves at most points.

Maid in Malacañang is not a movie made to justify lies as others claim it would be. Rather, it presents itself as a vulnerable piece prone to dissection - hence chapters. It is highly entertaining as it is thought provoking, tear inducing, BP raising, heart warming.

So I don't like it.

I love it.

PS the final mahjong scene looks funny in the trailers but it is actually a sinister dark energy filled take, from the daunting music which reminds of The Omen, to the evil spewed out lines to the closing of hands playing with yellows. A promotion of what was to come. Darryl should make a horror film continuation about this. :P.",9

Just because it does not align with what you believe is true, does not mean it is not true. Your idea of the truth is very subjective. And how can one say it is historical revisionism when they were just narrating what happened inside Malacañang the last 72 hours before leaving the country. Were you there that time? As what Senator Imee said, ""I cannot talk about what happened in EDSA coz I wasn't there. But I can talk about what happened inside Malacañang coz I WAS THERE.

AGAIN, THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS ""WERE YOU THERE WITH THE MARCOSES?""

I rest my case..",10
dokgerry,"Aug 10, 2022",The best ever MIM,"It reflects the truth and it touch your senses like love, sympathy, sadness, anger and fear. It did not hide the real truth. You will enjoy the comedies of those maids and your emotions will be carried away till the end. The dramatic moment is when they are going to leave Malacanang. There are some moral lessons in the movie. It gives additional insight or important insight into our history reflecting the other side of the story. The movie Maid in Malacanang is a controversial stories of the Marcoses in their version of what happened during that period and reflects many betrayals, hardships and many more.",10
joelenpenado,"Aug 10, 2022",Untold story not historical revisionism,"We see the other face of history Lincoln once said, ""nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character give him power."" This to me sums up Maid in Malacanang.

I came out thinking of love and power after laughing and tearing up on the various chapters of the movie. Love being power in itself. The movie was love of parents, siblings, workers who remained loyal until the end, love of self (masama ba akong tao?), people who surrounded those in power and love of country. Love after all is power.

It has often been said, ""Love is Light, that enlightens those who give and receive it. Love is gravity, because it makes some people feel attracted to others. Love is power, because it multiplies the best we have, and allows humanity not to be extinguished in their blind selfishness. Love unfolds and reveals.""

I hosted a private screening of #MIM last 9 August. I carefully selected the audience ensuring a generational mix. There are six (6) generations: Baby Boomers: born 1946 to 1964; Generation Jones: born 1955 to 1965; Generation X: born1 965 to 1980; Xennials: born 1977 to 1983; Millennials: born 1981 to 1996; Generation Z: born 1997 or after and Generation Alpha: born 2010 or after. X. Only Generation Alpha was not represented. A total of 56 individuals watched #MIM.

There was no revisionism made. It provided the 72 hours on the other side of the proverbial fence, the side of the Marcoses which were never really made clear to all Filipinos. The side I hated and never crossed in my youthful years. But a leader I knew from grade school to college. He was my only president for my first 23 years.

Of course I didn't know the POV of the three (3) maids but certainly knew of Sen. Imee Marcos' role as ""mayordoma"" - she was after all the assistant of her father, being the eldest and more knowledgeable than the other siblings.

MiM reinforced the characterizations I learned of Imee Marcos and Bongbong Marcos growing up. There was no sugarcoating on those two. What got my attention was that of the youngest, Irene Marcos. She was never political. She was always the sweet girl with a ready smile. That scene of Irene Marcos with the father was gut wrenching. Was there creative license there? I don't know because Irene Marcos has never been in the public eye. But that scene summed up what to be in government meant, what to hold power and how to deal with people wanting more. Meron bang mabuting pamahalaan is still ringing.

Clearly the sibling rivalry was there. Clearly, Imee was her father's daughter and Bongbong was the mama's boy. On point was a strong Imee and a gentle and low-key Bongbong. The moorings of the son was palpable in the scenes with the eldest, father and mother. Interesting that the journal page on Bongbong had an extended play with FM saying he believed in his son despite being a spoiled brat, the son after all was out to secure the support of the father. In politics, the namesake will always have that internal doubt (am I worthy of the name? Can I be better than my father? Could I achieve even just an inch of what he has done?). I have seen that internal debates with fathers and sons in the world of politics.

The scene of loyalists remaining in the palace wearing yellow and doing the L sign were just stories I heard from friends who joined the march to Malacanang on that night. ""May mga tao kaming nadatnan pero pro-Aquino."" I remembered the trashing, the bringing out of souvenirs. I myself had a piece of the barbed wire but can't recall where it is today...

Ang ""kasaysayan ay chismis""? Puede pero sa ilang dekadang pagsasaliksik at paghahanap ng katotohanan, puede and chismis ay nagkakaruon ng ugat at yumayabong hanggat may nagiibang daloy para ito muling baguhin. Hindi natutulog ang kasaysayan. Ito ay umiikot kung may kontrang daluyan ng punto o pangyayari na uusig sa ating kinagisnan.

Darryl Yap knows the public pulse so well. He intertwined happy and sad; comedic relief in a hot confrontation; the power of the moment and the internal questions one get to ask about how to love a country are all in the film. Sometimes, its takes a very ordinary view by maids that we discover the real narrative at the back of certain events. They may not sit well for some but it has to be told.

Were the Marcoses placed in a different light after MiM? Yes, because we saw their humanity and no, because the final chapter has yet to be written. As a wise man said to me after the film, it would be better to see who instigated all these things. ""Where is Joma in all these?""

MiM also confirmed the role of a foreign power in getting the Marcoses out. They were escorted and just by a call, they were rerouted. I again remember a favorite adage: ""In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it does, you can bet it was planned that way.""

The character I loved in this film was Manang Biday. For someone who did not know how to swim, maybe she survived her plight because she drank a lot from the Pasig River 😆.

Sometimes ordinary people hold the keys to where the mighty will soar or land head on. Often, they take the calumny to heart and that's what loyalists are made of. ###",10

MY PERSONAL MESSAGE: In this film, you will see how unjust these people went, but at the same time, how they deserved justice in the present time.

Remember, the Truth always will be revealed, one way or the other, maybe now or sooner. Whether you like it or not, Justice will prevail. It does not mean many people will believe and accept, but the Marcoses demonstrated that they still continued even if there are circumstances around them.

Haters out there, even if the elections are finished, do you even think the Marcoses will fail this time? No matter how much energy you put on hating the Marcoses, it would be useless. But it does not mean I hate you.

As a Filipino, can we all please stop all of this. Can we all move on? What would happen to the Philippines if we keep being divided? As a Filipino, I request that we must continue to prosper more, rather than being stuck talking about this history. It is time to start a new beginning.

I could consider it as a ""Dra-medy"" drama mix with comedy, and it was done perfectly! Actors portrayal of Marcos family and all the cast were superb, intriguing, miraculous and very funny. It is not a film about pro or anti Marcos, it's about simple things in life which is love to humanity. In terms of its technical aspect, I was blown away from the costumes, props. ( airplane was one of them), and the soundtrack was top notch, you'll be humming it after you saw it, a world class classic! Bring a napkin or tissue, the theater will be filled with tears....",10

ianjay-04931,"Aug 11, 2022",SUPER BLOCK BUSTER FILIPINO MOVIE OF THE YEAR AFTER PANDEMIC,"THE EMPEROR'S SWINDLER: A SPOILER-FREE REVIEW OF DARRYL YAP'S MAID IN MALACAÑANG BY SASS ROGANDO SASSOT

I have watched Darry Yap's other films - Jowables, Pornstar series, and Revirginized. What I noticed in those films is Yap's storytelling: he begins strong, then somewhere in the story he rushes to reach a denouement. Maid in Malacañang (MiM) is a different Yap.

Nothing felt rushed, the storytelling progressed like an onion being peeled delicately. Yap peeled MiM so delicately in its intricate layers, letting the audience shed tears as each layer unravelled, without emotionally manipulating them to do so.

And like in his other films, Yap combined drama and comedy - this time, seamlessly. There's still the usual preachy parts, like in his other films - this time, integrated so well as a narrative device, rather than as a cop out from the labor of story development.

As an ensemble, the cast is skilfully selected.

Cesar Montano is a Bernini sculpture: the minutest detail of his acting is Ferdinand E. Marcos. Diego Loyzaga is spot on in his portrayal of President BBM's coming of age moment. Real-life father and son, Cesar and Diego's confrontation scene is like watching a masterclass in acting.

Ruffa Guttierez's elegant acting unveiled Imelda, as a mother, beneath all the glamor. Ella Cruz as Irene Marcos tells us she has a bright future in Philippine cinema.

The three maids: Karla Estrada's comedic timing is masterfully delivered. Elizabeth Oropesa is timeless. Even when she's just standing, she makes you believe. Beverly Salviejo deserves a standing ovation for every scene: Give her her own full-length film. One never wastes a juggernaut like her! Even if there are 24 characters in a film, just cast Salviejo, and she would be able to persuade you that there were 24 different actors.

Now...Cristine Reyes as Imee Marcos. She does not deserve an acting award. Reyes must be given a monument. Rename NAIA, EDSA, the West Philippine Sea after her -- I don't care. Reyes, like Montano, is a Bernini sculpture: even when she is deep in thought, she is giving us Imee Marcos. If Reyes could top her acting prowess in MiM, name an entire galaxy after her.

As the film reached its denouement, I cursed: ""Potaena ka Darryl Yap!!!! Brilliantly wicked!""

The Emperor's New Clothes told the story of the swindlers who made a fool of an emperor and his ministers. They promised to weave the finest cloth for the emperor, and whoever wouldn't be able to see it is unusually stupid. Unusually stupid - that's how enfant terrible Yap made everyone who thinks so highly of themselves looked like with his most brilliant work to date.

MiM's real plot isn't in the film itself. This is one of the rare instances where the real plot developed after the film has been promoted publicly. In this sense, MiM is just a subplot. The main plot is the one - consciously or unconsciously - written by Yap: The mass hysteria of people addicted to their victimhood - real or imagined, reacting to the film they never watched. Yap directed a satire -- and it's not MiM. If you're as alert as the innocent child in The Emperor's New Clothes, you will easily spot the nakedness of the Emperor, his ministers who lost the plot, and the swindlers who wove the finest golden cloth worn by history.",10

This is not intended to be a documentary but a story of a family, the Marcos family. I hope the plans for its trilogy will soon materialize. The Mahjong scene was grossly bashed as they only based it on the stills found online. But it REALLY is different on the big screen. We finally get to see their side after decades of being perpetrated as evil by mainstream media. Most if not all the negative reviews written here and other platforms are just from the pinklawan trolls who haven't even seen the movie. They have nothing better to do but spread hate and keep this country divided. They just like to spew hate online like the trolls that they are.

I always want to hear the other side of the story (or history) since I am not satisfied with Cory Aquino being the one who gave freedom back to the Philippines. As a 9 yr old girl in 1986, i somewhat refused to believe it.

When this movie came out, and of course the vloggers and YouTube.. questions in my mins have been answered. The Marcoses are not monsters. They were portrayed as monsters by the oligarchs and elitists.

marcotongomd,"Aug 13, 2022",Must watch for every Filipino,"This is a movie about the last 72 hrs of the Marcos family in Malacanan before the Liberal Party took over.

Previously made films or dramas always celebrated how the Aquinos were supposedly the heroes of Philippine democracy.

No other film in the contemporary time had tackled the story of Maid in Malacanan. And for that alone, I think this is a must watch for every Filipino, whatever political inclination you may have.

And if you will be watching, always keep in mind that this is a movie. For issues regarding ""matter of fact"", it would still be prudent to do your own research.

There is nothing revisionist about what happened in the critical days of EDSA, and absolutely nothing about Martial Law or the attempt to redifine it.

MIM did not distort the story of EDSA, nor of Cory, or the Carmelite Nuns for that matter. Far from it. The dilawan rage over the movie is so misplaced, and so convulated that I cannot help but again believe that it was contrived and manipulated just to fuel more hate and devide.",10

graceysplaybox,"Aug 8, 2022",A Must-Watch For All Filipinos,"It seemed pretty obvious that the rating here has been desperately pulled down by no other than the yellows/pinks, otherwise known as the anti-Marcos people. Notice how uniform the ratings are? People who truly took the time to watch the film wouldn't have written such utterly biased, uniform ratings. Somehow there would be slight differences in numbers, depending on each and everyone's movie-watching experience. However, as obvious as they can get, their purpose here is to attack the film and the people surrounding it, because they do not want the Marcoses' side of truth to come out, or be heard. Even before the film was released, there were already 1-star reviews, which is typical of how the other side has always reacted to anything Marcos. The real distortion here is the other side who claims to be for democracy, but couldn't even allow others to tell their side of the story. Ponder on that.

Darryl Yap is a brilliant filmmaker. Genius. I admire his brevity and his courage in divulging the untold story of a family that would help pave the way for an eye-opening experience to the Filipino people, through a significant work of art.

I love how the film was made; the symbolisms, the transitions, its metaphorical scenarios. Bravo, Direk Darryl!

In fact, there are only TWO opposition / anti-Marcos senators. (Should be 4 but the other two went independent lol)

For more than 3 decades, Filipinos ONLY heard the opposition's side of the story and during those years, the Marcoses went silent, waiting, building themselves up from the negative to at least zero.... until they got back and better in 2022. And MiM is their way of telling their story. And it's just the first part of the trilogy.",10

NO, I do not see any historical revisionism as what other low ball ratings here are saying, for the record, I don't think that they really have seen the movie at all. It was a story held back for so many years. It was the story that the media did not allow to be aired but were valid on all points because they too were humans, they too were Filipinos with families and friends who got hurt in the process. For me the story was ""bitin"", they could have shown more and planted more foundation but it was a direct point as to the story they want to get across. It was the story of the Maid in Malacañang.

SirAlCee,"Aug 10, 2022",Imperfect!,"As Ella told Cesar, the government can never be perfect. So does the movie. A gallant effort to show the 'normal' side of a family whose 'kingdom' is crumbling amidst efforts to destroy them, quite literally and figuratively and the reaction and interactions amongst them. Besides a Prologue and an Epilogue, divided into 8 chapters highlighting the conversations (topic is accurate but the specific conversation is cinematic invention) between and among members of the Marcos family feeling the world close in on them and the pain and angst associated with it. Each chapter conversation will try to pinch your heart and then caress them with humor, placed near the end. It has many foreshadowing, Between chapters are short narratives to connect each chapter either text, footages or narrations. It focus only on the family and their helpers. Its music is haunting and heavy (MOSTLY PIANO) save for some sequences. It is not epic and doesn't pretend to be, nor documentary, albeit it does show footages that are self-explanatory. Generally good, and has some scenes that I feel are either out-of-place or not-well thought-out or appears to be an editing misjudgment due to discontinuity. It is worth watching. Those rating this 1 or saying historical revisionism HAVEN'T SEEN this and shame they bother to rate something they've NOT SEEN.

It was a very good movie, I cried and laughed multiple times even though I'm not a fan of martial law and FEM. It was a story of family who wants to survive for the last 72 hours from the hands of NPA and brainwashed people because of the Aquino's.

georgeamarcelo,"Aug 27, 2022",A Surprisingly Good Movie with Roman Catholic Themes,"A surprisingly good movie, considering the sensitive subject matter! Genuine characterizations of the Marcos family, including their personality flaws, and a nice balance of drama and humor. Not at all revisionist, as the contents are mainly interpersonal events between the Marcos family and household staff, and TV news footage. Looking forward to the sequel.

There are a lot of Christian and Roman Catholic themes in the movie. I will not mention these in my review to avoid spoiling the movie. These themes become more evident on the second or third viewing. Observe the way the characters are presented visually. Also listen carefully to what they say, especially their choice of words. Observe things that are present around the characters.

The genre of the movie is definitely political, with the objective of humanizing the Marcos political family. This is good, because the Marcos family are human beings, and the movie is telling this truth. But I think the movie at its core, is deeply Roman Catholic, and uses the story of the Marcos family to communicate spiritual truths.

I did not give the movie the highest rating because there are some parts of the movie that ""tell you"" rather than ""show you"" through action and character development. But it is not easy to see this because the acting is so good. You are able to lose yourself in the world of the Marcos family during their final days in power, and we also care about the characters so much that we do not clearly discern the screenplay writer ""preaching to you"".

A lot of criticism about the movie comes from the final scene where Cory Aquino is playing Mahjong with some nuns, as they say this did not happen, and so give this final scene as an example of historical revisionism. However, what Cory was doing at the time is not historically significant. The critics miss what is being communicated in this scene at a spiritual level. Observe closely the altar next to the Mahjong table. Do you notice anything odd? What is the position of Cory Aquino relative to the altar? Do you notice anything odd about the nuns? If you see the spiritual theme being presented, then now you might have something significant to be upset about, after you get over the initial shock.

Enjoy the movie. It gets better with every viewing.

I have created a vlog reviewing this movie in my BitChute Channel: ""Prepare For Departure"". It is a spoiler review, so I recommend that you watch the movie first.",8

malcolmconlan-88198,"Aug 28, 2022","Truly a masterpiece, three decades in the making.","Having finally watched Maid in Malacanang twice already over the last couple of days, I felt I should take to IMDB myself to rate the movie. Before watching this film, I had no idea really of what it might have actually really been like during those last 72 hours of the Marcos Presidency.

It's very easy just to rely on what's out there already in terms of historical documentation and documentaries on the Marcos era and those days as well as the so called EDSA revolution, but what we don't know is what it was really like for those present with the family themselves, what were there feelings, emotional responses and so much more. This movie and that era has been brought to life through the excellent storytelling of Philippine director, Darryl Yap. I believe he has put his heart and soul into this movie as have the whole cast and crew. Both Cesar Montano and Christine Reyes put on great performances, really believable and heartfelt.

If I could rate this movie as 11/10 I would. Please do all you can to watch this wonderful masterpiece!!!",10

There are scenes that are super intense and you will feel it while watching. There are also some tear jerker scenes and then some comedic scenes from the 3 maids.

robinreyes_ce,"Sep 25, 2022",An absolute masterpiece,"It was the first time in my entire life that a movie had such a profound impact on me from beginning to end.

The chapters are their entirety highlights. In the movie, each character has a standout moment.

1. The scene between Marcos Sr. And MarcosJr. Is excellent and ends with some humor.

2. I was deeply moved by the interaction between Irene and Marcos Sr. Irene's speech reflects her anguish very viscerally.

3. Imelda and Marcos Jr. Scene also made me shiver, and the scene where Imelda recognizes her jewelry and shoes captivated me. In the end, one of the maids sings the background music, and Biday is hilarious.

4. I was moved by the scene between Marcos Sr. And Imee in which he declared Imee to be his favorite and most trusted child.

5. But it was the sight with all the house staff and security officers that moved me and practically shed a tear to my eye. The three main maids address the entire staff in this scenario in order to inform them of the apparent departure of the first family. I was only able to control myself because I was sitting next to another viewer. But if I'm by myself, I imagine I'll be sobbing uncontrollably.

6. The final chapter, in which the servants lamented their exile with the family but were forced to use a piece of yellow clothing from Imelda's closet, is similarly heartbreaking.

Even as I write this review, I can't stop crying. The movie is a true masterpiece and magnificent. I'll watch this movie again, I swear.",10

Walang kaaway, walang siniraan subalit ipinakita ang galing at husay ng Filipino sa Industriya ng Pelikulang Filipino, kudos to all cast members, Mabuhay ang Filipino, Mabuhay ang Pilipinas.",10
revelynalmonte,"Mar 5, 2023",Perfect. Touching. At its best.,"Family drama at its best. I've watched it and so as those who paid for more than 700M pesos gross ticket sales and we all loved it. Direk DY is so great he touched the hearts and souls of those who watched it. For those who rated it without even watching it, its a shame that you and your political propaganda is trying to kill a very good movie. Wait for the sequel, marter or murderer and you will see how much this movie is so great that Viva has now a blockbuster movie. Congratulations to the cast and crew. Great movie. This will go down Philippine history as one if the best films to be written and produced.",10
gerald_knights-27808,"Sep 12, 2022",true story,"The movie is actually a family dramedy. If there is one thing that I find problematic, it is the stereotypical typecasting, once again, of maids becoming the sources of comic relief. But certainly, it is hard not to be amazed by Yap's masterful weaving in of humor as a punchline, most vividly represented by that emotionally charged confrontation between father and son Ferdinand Marcos Sr. And Jr., played by real father and son Cesar Montano and Diego Loyzaga, capped by the tiptoeing Biday, ably played by veteran comedian Beverly Salviejo. It was seen again in that touching dramatic silent monologue of Imelda Marcos played by Ruffa Gutierrez as she bid goodbye to her material possessions of gowns and shoes, taking only small mementos and love letters her husband Ferdie sent her, to the tune of that iconic 'Dahil Sa Iyo,' which turned out to be not a soundtrack but Biday, again, belting out her own aria as she was dusting a flower vase.

On a larger scale, the entire movie was actually a wicked punchline to rudely douse water ON the misplaced fears, the ruckus and the noise, about this movie becoming a monumental sacrilege to the altars of historical purity. There is nothing in this movie that actually distorts, revises, or replaces what we already know. This is not Yap and Viva Films trying to assault history with outlandish claims, but simply a dramatic, and sometimes hilarious, representation of a powerful family at their most vulnerable, most defeated state as they faced their imminent downfall.

It is the story of an eldest daughter, a role excellently enacted by Cristine Reyes playing Senator Marcos who struggled to lead a family in the throes of collapse, trying to hold it together. It is the story of a son, poignantly played by Loyzaga as the young President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., trying to make his father proud, trying to prove that he can be more than the party animal with whom his father expressed disappointment. It is the story of youngest daughter Irene Marcos Araneta played by Ella Cruz pleading with her father, and whose lines in the movie embodied a summary of the entire political career of her father.

Some people took note of the absence of any reference to the actual reasons why EDSA took place, and count this as a deficiency of the movie. What they missed is that this movie is less a historical account of EDSA, or the political downfall of the Marcoses, but a family drama to reveal the stories behind the façade of the presidential palace. Ella Cruz's character of Irene summed up what can possibly be said about the rule of her father - that his government was not perfect, and that he lost control of it and his people, many of whom betrayed him. These are factual claims.

There is no deliberate attempt to radically alter facts. Instead, what is given space is to provide the Marcos narrative a voice, and for the audience to form their own interpretations. The scene of the stash of cash at the beginning of the movie is perfect imagery that captured this. It establishes the fact that indeed there were boxes full of undistributed cash, which many would interpret as money intended to buy voters in the 1986 snap elections, but the character representing Senator Marcos rationalized it as payment for people who actually worked for the Marcos campaign. It was left to the viewers to form their own conclusions as to which narrative we will believe.

The much talked about, and bashed scene, of former president Corazon Aquino playing mahjong with nuns, who incidentally are clearly represented not as the Carmelite sisters, is actually an artistic and symbolic representation, following another symbolic scene where Ferdinand and Imelda waltzed while Malacañang was being attacked by a mob. If there is one moment where Yap made a political commentary, it would be in this symbolic representation of the political elites playing with the Church during EDSA. And no one can dispute that indeed the Church played a crucial role there.

This movie is not about revising history but about humanizing the Marcoses at their most vulnerable and weakest. This is something that cannot be denied by anyone, tyrant or otherwise. It doesn't change what they did or failed to do.

If there is another important fact that this movie revealed, it is that aside from the Marcoses there were others in Malacañang when it fell. These were the people who served them as guards and maids, who for so long were invisible, but finally were given a voice in this film.

In the end, the politics of this film is less seen in its content but more in how it has been received. It is like an RT-PCR test that would reveal whether we are positive with partisan prejudice, or negative and tolerant of other voices.

sebio-45307,"Aug 5, 2022",I did not expect this!,"The last 72 hours proved to be nerve wrecking and such a tearjerker. Great performance from Diego, Cesar, Ella and Cristine.

Beverly provided the comic relief from such heavy scenes.

This is the story we need to hear from the other side of history that was never told by those who rose to power.

I recommend for everyone born in the 80's onwards to watch this and be open minded. We've been hearing false narratives created by the yellows since elementary days.",10
mfeangeles,"Aug 9, 2022",One of the best movie ever,This film is great. I was blown away how the characters act every scene. There is no revision of history here only addition on what actually happened before. A must watch movie for everyone.,10

tezukaby,"Aug 9, 2022",A strong leader with the heart for his people!,"A movie that conveyed how Marcos loved Filipinos! EDSA revolution became bloodless because he chose to not fight his countrymen despite of the betrayal he re received from his colleagues. It was really a great movie. Former President Marcos was blessed with loving children, Irene, Bongbong and Imee who were ready to protect their father at all cost. 🇵🇭☝💟",10
danicakimly,"Aug 5, 2022",GREAT MOVIE!,"A must watch, it is worth it and you will never regret it. So heartbreaking and touching and at the same makes you laugh. A tear-jerker film. Fear The actors did an amazing job. And Direk Darryl Yap is brilliant the cinematography is amazingly done. Maid in Malacañang is a rare movie that succeeds on almost level. And the sound track nosi balasi is so fitting for them. One of the best things about this movie is we can see how vulnerable the Marcoses during the Edsa and the painful things they face during that time. Over all it is a great and a must watch movie.",10
juanitojrmarquez,"Aug 9, 2022",A missing piece from the History,"This movie is so great it made me cry so hard and laugh the entire movie, as in grabe... a must watch movie of Daryl Yap.

The story was to clear and the artist are great especially Christine Reyes, her acting was very awesome... cudos to the entire team... still waiting and excited sa sequel ng Movie.",10
alexcapuso,"Mar 6, 2023",I watched for the 3rd time and I still cried,"Kudos to the actors and actresses!!!! There is no history revisionism only a story of the other side, how they felt during the last 72 hours in the Malacañang. I can still remember how I cried hard and clapped hard at the theater after watching the movie.. The rollercoaster of emotions this movie gave me. And even just a single clip on social media still gave me chills. I hope people from the other side watch the movie too. Kristine reyes, Cesar Montano, Ella Cruz made me cry. Beverly Salviejo made me laugh. Kudos to Direk Darryl and Viva films for this masterpiece movie we millennials are craving for.",10
basagpinggan,"Mar 30, 2023",Worth Watching,"This is a good story from the other side of the spectrum which gives audience a chance to veer away from the long standing narrative of EDSA.

Direk Yap did not hide the real truth behind MIM. In fact, he is transparent declaring in a recent interview that, ""This is a family in crisis film..."" and is to be appreciated from the perspective of the maids, primarily the three Yayas - Biday (Beverly Salviejo), Lucy (Elizabeth Oropesa), and Santa (Karla Estrada). He also did not conceal the fact that the Marcos family had a direct hand in the making of the film, admitting in the same interview that Senator Imee Marcos deleted some from the original script, added some of her own, and approved the final script. Senator Imee Marcos is also the Executive Producer. It is in these regards that those behind MIM are honest and transparent as to the intentions of the movie.

And yeah, the number of ratings gives justice that this movie is indeed worth watching for Filipinos.",10
ndscs,"Aug 5, 2022",The last 72 hrs....,"If you're expecting a political thriller or a historical biopic, this is not it.

While based on true accounts, this is not about flipping the EDSA narrative at all. It is not to glorify the first family nor to make them heroes. So all the fuss about historical revisionism as far as we can see, is much ado about nothing.

What you'll get instead is a powerful tearjerker that exposes the Marcoses at their most vulnerable - during their last 72 hours in Malacañang. Even if you're apathetic about the Marcoses, you will still be moved by how Direk Darryl Yap. Is the film perfect? That's too generous of a statement. But it's very well-done.

The film is not a hagiography of the Marcoses but it shows them in a more humane light without completely absolving them of their sins.

It is a story of family, of love, and of hope. And that's something we can all root for..",10

Servings: six to eight.

Created at Brennan's restaurant in New Orleans in 1951, this classic dessert was named after loyal customer Richard Foster. Firm, ripe bananas are sautéed in a rum-infused caramel sauce, then flambéed in front of diners and spooned over vanilla ice cream. For extra pyrotechnics, throw a pinch of cinnamon onto the sauce as it flames.

Read the Test Kitchen blog for tips on flambéing safely.

Ingredients2 oz. (4 Tbs.) unsalted butter1 cup lightly packed dark brown sugar1/2 tsp. Ground cinnamon1/4 cup banana liqueur4 firm-ripe bananas, peeled, halved lengthwise, then halved crosswise1/4 cup amber rum, such as Old New Orleans or Goslings1 pint vanilla ice cream

Nutritional Information

PreparationIn a 12-inch skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the brown sugar and cinnamon and cook until moist, about 1 minute. Add the banana liqueur and cook, stirring continuously, until the grainy texture disappears and the mixture rolls off the spoon in a steady stream, 1 to 2 minutes. Put the banana quarters rounded side down in the pan. Cook until the bananas begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes.

Turn the bananas onto their flat sides. Remove the pan from the heat and pour in the rum. Set the pan over high heat and carefully ignite the rum with a long match or grill lighter. Gently shake the pan until the flame subsides. Remove from the heat.

Place a generous scoop of ice cream in 6 to 8 individual heatproof dessert bowls. Arrange 2 to 3 pieces of sautéed banana around each scoop of ice cream. Spoon on the sauce and serve immediately.",10

enriquecinque,"Aug 9, 2022",Marcos story: the other side of the incomplete truth,"For thirty years, the yellow Liberal Party had perpetrated a one-sided narrative regarding the purported EDSA Revolution. They have portrayed FEM as a monster totally erasing the many good things he had done for the country which no president before and after him could ever match. In this film, the Marcoses' humanity were presented debunking the yellowtards' depiction of them as monsters. But at the same time, the Aquinos were also humanized, that they are not saints and angels but weak and foolish leaders.",10

dazziellemaetlzdo,"Aug 9, 2022",Think twice. This is definitely not a 3-star movie. It's a 10.,"This movie is thought to revise Philippine history, but it is not. The books introduced to us in elementary thru college do not write anything about the Marcos' side of the story - their anxiety, their hysteria, their pain. There is nothing in this movie that tells that the history taught to us were wrong.

It is sad that the people who support the opposition of this present day government, loose what principle they have of appreciating art because they get rabid when their opinions are stubbornly not accepted.

Watch the movie. A dramedy that is very well done of superb actors with well-written lines, and of beautiful cinematography and intriguing song tracks. Watch, laugh, and cry.",10

aldinlapinig,"Sep 30, 2022",Great movie to watch with your family!,"Maid in Malacañang is the best movie of all time for many reasons. First and foremost, it is an accurate portrayal of life in the Philippines during the Marcos regime. The film does an excellent job of depicting the opulence of the elite while also highlighting the poverty and unrest that plagued the country. Additionally, the acting is superb, and the film's cinematography is gorgeous. Maid in Malacañang is a must-see for anyone interested in Philippine history or in great cinema in general.

The movie is highly recommended for every Filipinos or anybody who wish to know more about the Marcos era. Fill in the gaps that history books failed to educate us.",10

lencaparas,"Aug 18, 2022",What a movie!,"Glad that it was shown here abroad in Vancouver Canada at sa Cineplex theater pa. We paid $16 per ticket. (for those who says people were just asked and paid to watch it :D how lowclass thinking) Well made! Kudos to direct Darryl Yap. The music was so spot on! Magagaling din yung mga artists although exaggerated ang performance, ( like in most Filipino films anyway) . It is a drama and comedy movie. Love Biday. Bring tissues coz unless you are not human, you wont cry. It is relatable, imagine yourself being in their shoes in those last hours after living there for 20 years, and your sick dad and an angry mob. I really feel bad for Marcos as he was betrayed by his closest. But I guess they must do it para walang civil war. Somethings got to give. Marcos is no saint all politicians are anyway dirty kahit saan bansa. I read yung mga ninakaw nila Marcos na money binalik na sa pinas govt and yet those presidents that time took it to their own pockets using Marcos' name. So ganon din. The losers are the people pero sana this administration we let bbm pay what is due to the people by serving well and good.

jaceldeguzman-46942,"Feb 25, 2023",Untold Truth,"For almost 4 decades, we have been only told of one side of the story. The version of the Aquinos. This movies tells the other side. Marcos' side. Now it's up o us to establish the truth based on what we perceived and understood.

As a Filipino citizen who is on his fourties', i have seen a lot of information i have never known and heard of. Stories that the leftists hide from us.

If you are searching for truth, this movie is highly recommended. Because history to be factual should not be based solely from one side but all sides must be known, heard & understood. Even in a court, both parties are given the floor to declare their testimonies.",10

They just hate Marcos and will cancel every thing that is Pro-Marcos. I will not be biased here even if I'm a Marcos supporter. I will just judge the film for itself.

The movie's cinematography is really good. The actors who portrayed Marcos, Imee Marcos, and the 3 maids are great! There are some dramatic scenes that maybe did not exactly happen but were just added for cinematic purposes, of course. As well as some languages or expressions by the maids, that were really not used during the 80s. But it's okay, I think they were used for light moments in the film. The movie is dramatic and funny at the same time. I love the last few minutes of the film.",9

Everybody already knew what happened in EDSA, but no one told what happened inside the Malacanang during these trying times. And this is a perfect timing to tell everyone.

shamrreynaldo,"Aug 8, 2022",The Other Side of History,"For a very long time history books and the opposition mainly pictured the Marcos family as despicable and evil, and that Cory Aquino was the one who led the ""peaceful"" revolution that led to the overthrow of the Marcos Regime. Most of the Filipino people, if not all, were fooled into believing the narrative and lies that the left, the rebels and communists, NPA sympathizers, oligarchs, and student activists peddled. (And now they are going to IMDB to give this movie a low rating because that's what losers do)

The movie showed the other side of that story. The director, Darryl Yap, is successful in making the acting, the story, closer to reality by inserting old video footages of the real happenings around the time of EDSA Revolution in 1986. Yap was able to show the Marcoses as humans who have emotions, too. They were betrayed, frustrated, scared, and feared for their lives as the revolution is not really as peaceful as the opposition claims it to be. It was chaotic and bloody.

The best thing about this movie is that the information used to create this masterpiece came from a very reliable source -- one of the maids of the Marcoses in Malacañang. She was able to get herself out of the chaos in the palace by jumping into the Pasig River.

The movie is a roller coaster ride of emotions. It made me cry and laugh and mad at times. IT IS THE BEST.",10

clawson_J,"Sep 5, 2022",A passage of history for the people to see,"The movie shows the final moments of the Marcos family in Malacanang, showing bits and pieces of information that were fed to us but the one thing those yellow-commie aligned ""historians"" did not show was the human part of the people involved. The theme of family and loyalty, love for the nation is there, they really prefer to not use the gun, unlike their opposition.

If they were as ""eViL"" as some of these leftists/commie supporters have claimed, then how come the Philippines got worse when they elected that yellow saint of theirs who could not even bother to find out why her husband was offe'd and blamed it on Marcos senior.

History will be judged, the supposed ""heroes"" will be re-assessed.

bead32,"Aug 5, 2022",A MOVIE THAT SPEAKS FROM THE HEART,"I must confess that many portions of the movie found me teary-eyed. Oddly, the tears came naturally.

My rating would have been must less than the ten stars given. But I say that the low rating of one-star from many reviewers of the movie, is grossly unfair to the artistry and quality of the film. I found no one in the cast as over-acting, most all of the cast giving sterling performances. And given me the impetus to give it my full ten-stars to increase its IMDb rating.

bananachip,"Apr 10, 2023",made an account just for this!,"I should've watched this sooner.

Everything was great including the cinematography and writing. The opening gave so much nostalgia for the 80s even though I'm a Gen Z. Tons of references, props and historical videos to back it up. The comedy is very cheesy but that also applies to every Filipino movie ever.

One complaint I have is the forced dialogue and political potshots but I don't really care that much because.

1. The plot is contained in only 72 hours

2. This was made in the middle of the election where everyone was in ""war mode""

FACT OR FICTION? (SPOILER)

There are some elements that are fact and fiction but the history is 100% FACT. U. S News articles back then showed the extent of the military coup where Malacañang was being peppered with rockets. The protest being violent was also true as there's no such thing as a ""peaceful protest"" and the movie even shows news clips of brawls between Marcos and Aquino supporters.

I saw a negative reviewer here that claimed the maids were just fictional comic relief. The same reviewer admitted that they only watched 30 minutes of the film before storming out of the cinema in anger. This is just false.

The big reveal at the end was revealing that these 3 maids were actually real people. One even sadly passed away just two weeks after the events. Almost every Malacañang staff loved the Marcoses and it's a commendable Filipino trait as maids are always treated as part of the family.

So the history is actually factual, so where's the fiction?

Opinion: Personally I feel that Imee's entire character is fiction. As she heavily contributed to this film, it feels as though this is what she wanted it to have been rather than what actually happened.

In the film, Imee is treated as the leader of the household that even her parents can depend on. But witnessing the dynamics of older Ilocano households and even in Bongbong Marcos' own words, the Parents are never questioned and they lead the family by themselves.

WHY THE RATING?

As stated, my only problems were two elements so 8/10 but overall, it was enjoyable to watch.

The solemn scenes are beautifully intermixed with the humorous scenes. It doesn't follow the Filipino extreme like making us think someone's dead only to reveal that they were sleeping. It knows when to put a joke and not interrupt the pacing.

The scenes were also heavy. Props to the actors for the performance especially during my favorite scene ""Ilocos o Leyte"" where Imee has a mental breakdown of paranoia after finding out the severity of the situation.

I highly encourage watching with your family (16+) as it's more of a family film than a historical film. Seeing your parents relate to the 80's references makes you feel like your bonding with them and the theme of the entire film is a lesson on how strong family bonds always prevail over petty political fights.",8
ralphcharlofabian,"Mar 1, 2023",Straight from the Fact!,"Been watching Most of documentaries specially the Edsa event, and yes it was an unpleasant one, but what we know is just a ONE SIDED one.

The movie really showcase the other piece that are kept 37 years ago, specially inside the Malacañang Palace. Well documented and the actors/actress selection are excellent!

kittengab,"Aug 8, 2022",The movie isn't a total rotten fruit but a lot of things need improvement!,"Just watched Maid in Malacañang a couple of days ago. This is my first time to write a movie review and since I have no expertise in anything related to film production and writing stories, take this as a piece from an ordinary moviegoer. You might come across some strange expressions here, so I'm sorry in advance.

TECHNICAL STUFF. Whether it's the cinema's systems or the film's audio mixing, I found the sound so terrible that it affected my experience during the entire time. It was too loud that I had to cover my ears sometimes, even more for the moments when Cristine Reyes as Imee was shouting. And the balance between dialogue and music wasn't great; the Nosi Ba Lasi song didn't fit in well. And I wanted to enjoy the song naman while following the scenes. Another thing is the text. Did they make the text switch too soon or am I just a slow reader. I think it was too fast, and was part of my thought about the story feeling so rushed.

MUSIC. Nosi Ba Lasi is the theme song of the film. I didn't pay attention to the lyrics (never listened to the song before) but this version of Sampaguita's song did give some melancholic feeling to the story. Also I wished the background music wasn't so plain. I'm a sucker for movie soundtracks. The music score should have a unique identity.. It wasn't memorable. Also the sound of plucking strings during the maids' scenes felt pretentious. Didn't fit in with the sound style of the film.

CAST AND CHARACTERS. Okay, so I know nothing about the personalities of the family, so I wanted to see how the film would portray them whether it's assuming we already know the kind of people they are or it's gonna introduce them to us as if they're new (of course, accompanied with the knowledge this film is about the presidential family living at the Palace). I'm on the latter. I think Imee's introduction was good because I got to know her as this woman who's always moving, got a lot on her mind. When she gets back to the Palace, she's shown as the person most concerned about matters at home. I would be disappointed too if my siblings don't know what to do with their responsibilities haha. So I got the impression that the story would focus more on her development but the film dropped her in the middle of it. Irene, Imelda, and Bongbong suddenly got scenes of their own when I didn't really get to know them before that. (And clearly the father Ferdinand is a secondary character). Like, okay, I didn't care about their emotionals because I was already hooked on Imee's development from the start. The actors weren't bad actually. Christine Reyes as the stressed out Ate-of-the-house was impressive. Of course, she's the star here. For the other actors, I wasn't really impressed with them. I wish the story was written differently to bring out their best talent.

STORY. Bruh, I didn't enjoy the pacing. Too much tense and emotional scenes, it felt like a drag. I actually zoned out during Bongbong and Ferdinand's scene. And I saw two people on their phones during that scene too. I was expecting a good breathe of air after that but Irene's scene came next, I think. Hopefully my memory isn't bad. Also maid Biday's presence during that scene felt so out of place. I actually found it funny but it still didn't fit in appropriately. I wish the household staff had more scenes on their own since I felt they were important people in the story. If the story was written to not focus so much on the family but the Palace as a whole, I would've found it more interesting. The balance between serious and comedy needs improvement. Last thing, Robin Padilla's cameo was goddamn too cringe. What is this? The MCU? Welcome to the Malacañang-verse. And IRM 2022 during the Bongbong & Imelda scene was, er, cheesy.

THINGS I LIKED. I can't explain how the scene with Ferdinand and Imelda dancing in the middle of the Palace's chaos was nice. Ganda. Imee's scene with the staff at the end. I think that the only emotional scene I liked. The family cared for the staff and didn't simply abandon them. After Ferdinand called Imee the best maid in the Palace, the fact that the three maids were real people was a (heartwarming) twist! ""Maids are not just maids.""

Summary of stars deducted: 1. Terrible sound mixing and musical score was disappointing for a movie soundtrack lover 2. Lack of character exposition and development 3. Story felt like dragging and lost my interest and attention in the middle 4. Robin Padilla cringe and inappropriate comic relief (the maids deserved better!)",No Rating
