soundfables,8,aside from the goofy sfx this movie actually did a great job in trying to introduce a new format in storytelling for Filipino films. By no means am I saying that this movie is perfect but I think it’s a great start to challenge linear storytelling that’s been a longtime trend in the Philippine’s current world of filmography.

Cinematography, astral projection across different time periods, the concept, musical scoring is on point and impressive— all solid. The whole part about the family taking care of the sisiw or “maligno” added a really interesting layer.John Rey tho... I really feel so bad for him. he's the only one who knows how to love someone properly. he sacrificed so much over the years, only to see it wasted again kasi tatanga tanga si Jonathan sa pag ibig. ang selfish, kainis.The ending worked for me though. It felt perfect for this coz it didn’t wrap everything neatly. Instead, it left the sense that the horror isn’t over, that more evil and chaos is just waiting to spill out.

cmbynfred,7,"A haunting mix of history, faith, and horror — Mallari stands out as one of the more ambitious local thrillers in recent years. Piolo Pascual delivers a chilling and layered performance that keeps you hooked, even when the story starts blurring the line between the supernatural and psychological. The film’s atmosphere is eerie and unsettling, with stunning cinematography that makes every shadow feel alive. It’s not perfect — the pacing dips at times, and some twists feel a bit too heavy-handed — but its ambition and emotion more than make up for it. You can tell it’s a film made with vision and courage.Mallari isn’t just a horror story; it’s a tragic reflection on guilt, faith, and the darkness that lingers inside us all.",2025-11-09,0,0,rewatch,False

kalbryne,6,"The first time I watched this movie, I remember how scared I was, especially since I was watching it alone in my room at dawn. I didn’t finish it because I was too scared, and I only continued watching it in the morning.Honestly, the film was great when I first saw it. I was literally amazed by the cinematography—I mean, compared to other Filipino horror movies, the visuals here were on par with international films. The storyline was okay for me—not that outstanding, just okay.Now that I’ve rewatched it, I still find the visuals, production, and cinematography stunning. At some point, though, the film tried to do a lot of things; everything felt all over the place. Like, yeah, it’s trying everything but still gives nothing, which comes off a bit messy. I don’t know, this is just my honest opinion. For me, it could’ve been better if they focused more on the biography of Mallari rather than adding a touch of modernity to his story.Nevertheless, this film is a huge step up for the Philippine horror movie industry.

It’s rare to see a Filipino horror film that’s this well-made and actually keeps you hooked from start to finish.The mix of history, religion, and horror worked so well together—it gave the movie a really dark and eerie vibe that sticks with you. The acting was great too, especially how the emotions and tension built up scene by scene. You can really feel the fear and mystery behind the story.What I love most is how it doesn’t rely too much on jumpscares—it’s more about the suspense, the story, and the heavy atmosphere. Plus, the sound design and visuals added so much to the overall creepiness.Overall, Mallari is one of the best local horror films I’ve seen. Disturbing, emotional, and haunting in all the right ways.

chomulvr,9,"Rewatching cause why not? Okay, I get why most people hate the horror concept of the movie. Kasi nga nabigyan ng justice ang pagpapakilala kay Fr. Juan Severino Mallari. I understand that it can be introduced deeper since kinukuha na naman yung story nung tao, why not sa kanya i focus on yung film? Why not show in the movie how killings happened? The presence of ghosts, kulam/barang stories validated Mallari’s mass killing and kind of disregard the part where the priest lost his mind. Pero in my opinion, that one still hooked me. Alarcons’ secret lies within the family and they uphold that for centuries. Yung konsepto ng “oppressed people (mutsatsa)” craving for power in order to seek justice. Kasi hindi naman naparurusahan ang mga masasamang tao kaya’t kung nasa kanila ang kapangyarihan, mas madali itong ilagay sa sarili nilang kamay. On the other hand, sana na focus on how problematic ‘yon (pero lawl, gets problematic but true) pati rin yung pag justify kay Fr. Mallari as “just” serial killer which is so fucked up lol. Walang just na mamatay tao. The concept is nice. Yung iba't ibang time period, astral projection (? lol), medyo cringe lang yung part na nakipag-away si Jonathan HAHAHAHAHA sana all baliw.

ervienflix,4,"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Please don't kill me. ⛪️🐦‍⬛Hooptober 12 (12/31)Country: Philippines 🇵🇭Decade: 2020sThe story of colonial Philippines' first ever documented serial killer should be enough to sustain a fictional movie, right? The team behind Mallari thought apparently not because, somehow, all of the cliches and tropes you can possibly find in every Filipino horror movie is in this. Let's do a checklist.1. Aswang and other related Filipino folk horror elements ✅️2. Haunted house ✅️ BONUS: a scene set there with children scaring each other shitless that ends with a possession ✅️3. Jump scares galore unconvincingly shot through jump cuts, where a ghost either looks away from the camera or has a ""normal"" face then faces the camera with ghastly make up on accompanied by sudden jolt in the score ✅️4. Shoehorned romance subplot as a shorthand for character motivation ✅️I can get behind these cliches if they're done well enough for me to still enjoy the movie, but I was disappointed with the lackluster script and the story structure, even early on before the reveal of the movie's supernatural bent. Mallari starts off interestingly, featuring the on-screen kill of a well-known Filipina actress in surprisingly gory detail. I honestly thought that this was going to be a straightforward slasher movie, something that is so rare in Filipino cinema, so maybe it's my fault for setting those expectations. We flash forward more than a century later with the descendant of the infamous Fr. Severino Mallari, a doctor named Jonathan De Dios, both played by Piolo Pascual. Throughout the course of the movie, Jonathan encounters through dreams, astral projection and just plain old haunting another descendant nearer his bloodline, a war documentarian named Johnrey Mallari, also portrayed by Piolo Pascual. Despite the obvious ambition in telling a multi-generational story, I'm afraid Mallari only goes downhill from there.It feels like entire scenes are excised from the movie, without care for continuity — e.g., in the scene after the first contemporary murder, the cops say they went to Jonathan first but we don't see that scene ever, which doesn't add to doubts about Jonathan's identity as the new iteration of the killer.The movie suffers from clunky dialogue throughout. Character actions are written as actual speaking lines (there are a lot of expository and internal realizations spoken by the characters on their own in this movie). Despite the cast's best efforts in their line deliveries, some come off as unintentionally hilarious (like Janella Salvador's line, ""Bago ka umalis, doctor ka. Ngayon, manghuhula ka na?"") or hammy (like noong hinahanap na ni JC Santos ang SISIW! with exclamation point).Characters come and go as they please without establishing where they were in between scenes, which doesn't help if you want your audience to guess who's the one going around killing people (immediately after that first murder in the modern times, there's no doubt who it is), or if you want to establish some tension before a victim is dispatched (such was the case with Manang Mes, who is absent from the film until she was killed, only explained with a throwaway line from the cops). There is one character who gets a little bit of background before getting killed off, but it leaves a sour taste because many of the surrounding characters say homophobic stuff (although that tracks for the world this is set in) and it also doesn't help that even that character's own lines didn't seem to be well thought of.However, it is the inclusion of the supernatural angle that made my head spin the most. Since the actual case occurred in colonial times, limited records of what exactly happened in Magalang, Pampanga exist. The real Fr. Severino Mallari's motive was indeed his mother's mysterious ailment that he thought could only be cured by killing other people. But introducing another big bad behind the big bad dampens the impact of the movie's examination of who Fr. Mallari is. This technically makes Fr. Mallari an antihero, the movie even argues he was a vigilante although I don't know if that's based on fact. Wouldn't it be more interesting to portray a character at the deep ends of his wit to comment on mental health issues that is still relevant to this day? Or using the concept of the aswang and Filipino folk beliefs as a scapegoat, which would have contrasted nicely with his status as an ordained Catholic priest? Or is the misdirect done to be more commercially pleasing? Luckily, the folk horror parts of the story tie neatly until the end, but on top of the multigeneration arc, present-day investigation, and time travel subplots, Mallari already has too much on its plate.The only things I could think of worth praising with Mallari are the production design, costumes and lighting for the parts set in 1812 and 1948 (it's obvious that the budget went there), Gloria Diaz's pitch perfect doña of the household, and the clever incorporation of Catholic iconography into the killings (St. Bartholomew is actually the patron of Magalang, and the tabak is supposed to represent the weapon used to skin him alive when he was martyred) which the movie goes out in its own way of disclaiming at the end. While I could see how this kind of movie played well during MMFF when, notably, a Shake, Rattle and Roll installment was missing from the entries, I don't necessarily recommend watching Mallari.- Gags: 1. How would the present-day parish priest know just by looking at the crime scene photos (which shouldn't happen in real life because he's not being interviewed as a suspect) that they are ""copycat"" murders of the ones in 1812 when no actual photographs from that year exist? Is he also a time travelling astral projectionist? 2. Johnrey Mallari films himself with his handheld camera multiple times in the movie. But there was one film reel projected where Piolo Pascual's eyes are looking at a different direction, when he's supposed to be looking straight into the camera.",2025-09-27,2,0,watch,False

miriamorpho,4,"If I were to judge it in a few words, it’s like a fanfiction of Fr. Mallari’s true crime story, which explains why it became a mix of different genres and almost far from reality. Acting-wise, Pascual was really great at portraying three different versions of himself, and I could clearly see the distinction. Special mention to JC Santos, because I never thought he could play that kind of character. In terms of narrative, I liked how it was twisted and blurry at first, but it gradually made sense as the story progressed. However, as the story escalated, the plot holes became more evident, and I was honestly confused by the last revelation, as if the first one didn’t matter at all. The cinematography was great, and the jump scares were well thought out—they didn’t rely on the usual familiar tactics. Despite these mishaps, the unrelated accounts of Fr. Mallari’s real life, and the mixed genres, they still delivered a well-crafted Filipino horror.",2025-09-19,0,0,watch,False

misshemm,5,"""I rate Mallari a 2.5 out of 5. While the film had strong potential with its historical premise and intriguing concept, it ultimately falls short in delivering genuine scares. The pacing is uneven, and the horror sequences feel predictable rather than spine-chilling, leaving much of the tension flat. Despite decent performances and atmospheric visuals, the movie struggles to build sustained suspense, relying on familiar tropes instead of innovative storytelling. Mallari is watchable, but for horror fans expecting a truly frightening experience, it fails to leave a lasting impact.""- Obscuritin 🎬",2023-12-28,0,0,watch,False

A horror movie that would terrify the audience out of their skin or an accurate depiction of the historical killings of Fr. Mallari. It went both ways and I mean that as an insult. It set up a beautiful potential for the movie to progress into, and then drove the movie into a lackluster fantasy.The astral projection idea was good, had it been executed properly. The writers were probably so proud of themselves for adding the manananggal ""plot twist"" if you can even call it that, they shouldn't be. It was like they were pilling all the possible plots in the world that the movie had become too ambitious for something they can't even achieve.I just wish that they shouldn't've made this movie about Fr.

jmsurio_,8,"Mallari is a rare offering in Philippine cinema, a genre piece that dares to excavate spiritual dread through a historical lens, delivering both psychological unease and cultural reflection with surprising sophistication.Inspired by true events, the film braids fact and fiction with eerie precision, conjuring a portrait of evil that is neither gratuitous nor shallow. It does not sensationalize its horror, but rather embeds it within the folds of human frailty, trauma and unspoken guilt. What emerges is a haunting exploration of generational sin: how belief systems, when warped by grief and power, can descend into darkness.Pascual commands the screen with a quiet, brooding intensity, shifting seamlessly across timelines and psyches. His performance anchors the film's ambitious structure, which traverses multiple epochs without losing thematic coherence. The supporting cast enriches the tapestry, though it is Pascual's psychological unraveling that most compellingly draws the viewer into Mallari's descent.The cinematography is meticulously composed, leveraging lighting and period detail to amplify atmosphere rather than overshadow it. There is enough restraint in the visual language, a refusal to rely on cheap thrills, that allows the dread to simmer rather than erupt. The score, too, underscores the unease without overwhelming the narrative, enhancing moments of revelation with quiet dread.Mallari is a meditation on guilt, belief, and the persistence of evil across generations. In summoning the ghosts of the past, it forces the viewers to confront the ones we still live with.",2023-12-28,0,0,watch,True

ninetieslashers,5,"I was really hyped for this one. Like, really. I’ve spent hours researching Juan Severino Mallari myself — not even kidding, I know more about serial killers than I do about algebra. His story? Fascinating. A priest who killed over 57 people just to try and heal his sick mother? That’s the kind of dark, layered horror story I LIVE for. So when I found out there was a whole-ass movie about him? I was on it. I had that trailer play a few times, even YouTube e-mailed my ass and said, ""bitch, you gonna watch something else?"" But I remember being hyped to watch it tonight, and boy…This movie felt like homework. Long, bloated, and just a messy watch. They seriously took creative liberties with Mallari’s story — and not in a good way. Like, that's not how his mother was treated, at all 😭 And don’t even get me started on the VFX… I’ve seen better CGI on 2009 YouTube screamers. It gave unauthorized fan film with a budget.What stings the most is how much potential it had. They could’ve easily made a 90-minute slasher film set between 1816–1826, and it would've eaten. But instead, they threw in this confusing-ass time travel angle?? Girl, be serious. And suddenly it’s supernatural? No thanks. The kills were predictable, mostly off-screen, and the rare on-screen ones were so over-the-top they looked fake. It felt like the director just watched Insidious once and said, ""Yeah, I can do that.""I will say — it tried to be interesting. But this felt like someone's first time making a horror film… and it showed. If they stripped it back to its core — the madness, the religious guilt, the murders — it could’ve been powerful. Instead, it was a drag. A stylish, confused, occasionally interesting drag.My expectations were way too high. I should’ve grabbed a glass with a beverage to carry my ass through, dimmed the lights, and lowered my standards. But meanwhile, the guy who played Severino Mallari? HOT. Like fine as hell, no debate. When he showed up on screen in that priest getup, I literally whispered, ""Hellooooo, fatherrrr…"" The man was serving murderous thirst trap and I was eating it up. But even that face card couldn’t save this mess of a movie. While it’s not terrible, it’s definitely not good either.⭐️⭐️½ (2.5/5)",2025-07-22,0,0,watch,False

Naging halo halo na sya, this film is alot of things but not minimalist. It tried to do to many things and became mid in all of them. I think the ending was pretty good. It tied up the film properly, and you can tell na pinag isipan talaga yung plot ng movie and the characterization. This film overreached and underdelivered, but the attempt itself is good enough for me. It's a Filipino film with a compelling and non-idiotic concept that managed to appeal to many Filos.

ebbimae,8,"As an avid Filipino history lover, I did a lot of research on the real-life story of Fr. Severino Mallari when I was in 10th grade for our written essay in Filipino. He was a 19th-century Catholic priest from Pampanga who was said to be the first recorded serial killer in the Philippines. He was reportedly mentally ill and murdered at least 57 people, believing that each death would help cure his ailing mother. He was eventually imprisoned and later executed by hanging. His case is considered one of the earliest recorded instances of serial killing in the country — and yet it has been largely forgotten in mainstream Philippine history until recently.So when the movie Mallari was first aired, my older sister and I immediately watched it out of both curiosity and excitement to see how director Derick Cabrido would portray such a dark and complex figure on screen. Although the movie adds a heavy layer of fiction — including themes of reincarnation, supernatural visions, and a futuristic timeline (which clearly didn't happen in real life) — it was still incredibly engaging to watch.Piolo Pascual did an excellent job portraying three different characters across the film's distinct timelines. He carried the emotional and psychological weight of the role with such depth, especially in the scenes where guilt and madness were most apparent.",2025-06-18,1,0,watch,True

eduksineph,,"🎬Mallari (2023)🔹 Reviewed by: RovMallari (2023), directed by Roderick Cabrido and starring Piolo Pascual in a challenging triple role, is a gripping blend of historical horror and psychological thriller. The film explores the dark legacy of Fr. Juan Severino Mallari, a 19th-century priest turned serial killer, weaving together three generations of his family across different timelines. Pascual’s nuanced performances, which earned him a Best Actor win, and the film’s immersive production design vividly bring to life the eerie atmospheres of colonial Philippines, post-war struggles, and modern-day hauntings. The story’s exploration of inherited trauma and religious hypocrisy adds emotional depth, making Mallari more than just a conventional horror movie. The film jumps between different time periods, so it asks viewers to pay close attention, but the effort pays off with a powerful look at how evil can linger through generations and how faith can both heal and haunt.The film was well-received both critically and commercially, earning multiple accolades at the 2023 Metro Manila Film Festival, including Best Supporting Actor for JC Santos, Best Musical Score, and Third Best Picture. It also dominated the 72nd FAMAS Awards with 14 nominations and six wins, including Best Actor for Piolo Pascual and Best Picture Awards. What makes Mallari truly memorable is how it combines historical horror with deeply personal stories, resonating deeply even after watching. It’s a film that doesn’t just aim to scare, but also to explore the darker sides of human nature and family legacy in a way that feels fresh and meaningful.",2025-05-29,0,0,watch,False

aravindsriram,7,"Mallari is a chilling horror film that explores the dark legacy of Fr. Juan Severino Mallari, a Catholic priest turned serial killer in 19th-century Philippines. The movie masterfully weaves together a suspenseful narrative that spans three decades.Roderick Cabrido's direction is commendable, bringing to life the eerie atmosphere and suspenseful plot of the film. His ability to balance horror and suspense is impressive.The cast delivers outstanding performances, bringing depth and complexity to their characters. Piolo Pascual shines as Fr. Juan Severino Mallari, capturing the character's sinister and malevolent nature.The film's cinematography is excellent, capturing the juxtaposition of beauty and horror. The use of dark, muted tones creates an unsettling ambiance, drawing the audience into the depths of Fr. Mallari's twisted psyche.The movie's pacing is well-balanced, neither too fast nor too slow, allowing viewers to fully immerse themselves in the story.The soundtrack effectively enhances the overall atmosphere of suspense and horror.The film's reliance on unnecessary jump scares disrupts the flow of the movie, creating an abrupt and jarring experience for the viewer.The CGI effects, particularly the Manananggal scene and 3D shadows, are subpar and detract from the overall quality of the film. However, the CGI old creepy face of Doña Facunda is a notable exception.Despite its drawbacks, Mallari is a commendable horror film that boasts a captivating plot, historical ties, and commendable performances. With some improvement in CGI, this film could be truly exceptional. Overall, it's a worthwhile watch for horror enthusiasts, offering a unique blend of Philippine history and urban legend.",2025-05-27,2,0,watch,False

gogojira,5,"I've got some grievances for this movie...they valued cheap jump scares over good atmosphere and pacing. At some point,s the sound and music were so overwhelming when they didn't need to be?? And the time-travelling and dream aspects were poorly executed and confusing. The ghosts move like Hollywood ones and not Asian ones, which I think is a missed opportunity. The background characters' lore dump like no tomorrow, and the jump cuts are really disorienting :( I wanted a whole lot more with the concept for this film, this isn't the kind of generational conflict I wanted...",2024-06-29,0,0,watch,False

redbricksweater,5,"A Beautifully Shot, But Clunky and Overstuffed Horror AttemptI watched Mallari out of curiosity, intrigued by its premise and the promise of psychological horror—my favorite genre. My partner and I decided to give it a go, and while there were some strong points, the film ultimately felt like a wasted opportunity.The Good: • The cinematography, color grading, and framing choices were stunning. Certain scenes had a distinct, almost painterly quality that added to the film’s eerie atmosphere. • Piolo Pascual delivered a solid performance, effectively portraying three different characters despite criticisms that he was just “playing himself in three fonts.” • JC Santos completely stole the show in his final scenes. His performance was so gripping that I found myself thinking he might have been a better fit for Juan Severino Mallari.The Bad:1. Repetitive and Meaningless Scares • The eyeless souls were unsettling at first, but after the third time, they felt like cheap filler rather than an effective horror element. • The film never explains why the souls are trapped in the house when they were murdered elsewhere. • The scene with the children breaking into the house felt unnecessary—what was its purpose?2. A Confused, Overstuffed Narrative • The film tries to be everything at once—supernatural horror, historical thriller, cult mystery, and even a time-travel story—but ends up feeling like a jumbled mess. • Juan Severino Mallari was a real historical figure—the first recorded Filipino serial killer. Instead of leaning into historical horror and exploring corruption within the colonial church (which would have been a logical reason for how he got away with 57 murders), the film adds a convoluted subplot about a cult of witches raising a supernatural “sisiw” entity. • The cult’s motivations are unclear—do they want immortality? Revenge against the ruling class? Power? It’s never explained. They just need a vessel for the sisiw… so they can take care of it? • There was already enough real-life material to craft a compelling 1800s storyline without forcing in aswang elements and cults. Instead, the film almost seems to justify Mallari’s killings, framing him as a tragic figure rather than a murderer.3. Inconsistent Character Writing and Awkward Shifts • Gloria Diaz’s character starts as an abusive, religiously fanatical noblewoman, hinting at her darker tendencies. But midway through the film, she’s suddenly framed as an innocent victim. This abrupt shift feels forced, as if the filmmakers changed their minds halfway through. • The CGI transformation scene (especially the “Gollum” filter on Gloria Diaz) was jarring and unconvincing. • Johnrey turning into a werewolf after taking the sisiw was the moment I officially gave up trying to rationalize anything in the film. At that point, I just thought, Okay sure, do whatever, it’s your movie. • Then they introduced time travel through astral projection, which ultimately did nothing to resolve the story’s core conflicts.4. Forced and Cringe-Worthy Romance • The relationship between Jonathan (Piolo Pascual) and Agnes (Janella Salvador) had zero chemistry. • Agnes, despite being introduced as an intelligent doctor, was completely one-dimensional. Her dialogue felt forced and unnatural, which wasn’t helped by Janella’s flat performance. • The romance subplot added nothing to the film. Jonathan could have uncovered his family’s dark history on his own without a love interest tagging along. • The worst moment was Agnes’ final line: “Bilog na naman ang buwan… magugutom ako mamaya!”—delivered with an unnecessary dramatic flourish, complete with removing her sunglasses to the side. It gave off girlboss slay energy in the cringiest way possible. • Also, wasn’t the sisiw’s vessel supposed to forget everything once possessed? But now she conveniently remembers everything? Sloppy writing.Final ThoughtsMallari had potential but ultimately fell apart due to weak writing, unnecessary subplots, and an overcomplicated narrative. The film would have been stronger if it had stripped away the aswang cult elements and focused purely on historical horror and psychological tension.That said, I am looking forward to Severino (the upcoming series starring Dennis Trillo). Hopefully, they take a completely different approach— because Mallari was nothing more than a beautifully color-graded attempt at horror.",2025-03-31,0,0,watch,False

Aside from these, the movie also gave an interesting mix of slasher and supernatural horror, giving an interesting storytelling.

We tend to seperate and distance ourselves from the act and blame the devil, unable to accept that man is capable enough even without the devil's aid (a technique of neutralization in the Sociology of Deviance, known as denial of responsibility, wherein the deviant act is due to forces outside of the individual's control—a form of rationalization—distancing the self from the crime).Although, it's perfectly understandable considering that the Philippine culture has deep ties with supernatural beliefs, but the modern cinematic medium should at least serve as an avenue to shed light on matters with historical basis, not to envelope it further in the occult.Naging werewolf pa si Piolo amputa.",2025-02-13T10:24:59.499Z,2,0,watch,False

While it challenged me to pay attention and connect the dots, it never left me confused or frustrated. For me, this was thanks to its well-written script, brilliant acting, and superb direction.It’s proof that you can make a suspense/thriller/horror film na hindi ka nakakunot noo mo habang nanonood kasi halos wala ka nang maaninag—unlike that movie (yes, I’m looking at you, Deleter) where everyone might as well have been silhouettes in the dark - even after 2 years di pa rin ako maka-move on talaga.I absolutely enjoyed this movie, kahit na late na ako sa party!

The concept had so much potential—how could you go wrong with the story of the first parish priest turned serial killer? It’s such a compelling idea, and the plot could’ve carried itself without unnecessary additions.But instead of sticking to the suspense and thriller elements, they shoehorned in the whole “aswang” angle, which felt completely unnecessary and poorly executed. Horror like this, especially in Philippine cinema, needs to be done with care, and unfortunately, this just missed the mark.I had high hopes because of Piolo Pascual and Janella Salvador, but the film devolved into a melodrama instead of leaning into the dark, gripping thriller it was supposed to be. The script was cringe-worthy and lacked sincerity, making it hard to take the story seriously.The one saving grace? The production design. It’s clear a lot of thought went into creating the look and feel of the film, but that’s not enough to save it. Overall, Mallari was a huge letdown.",2025-01-13,0,0,watch,False

It was partly my fault for expecting that this movie would focus on the serial killer aspect and push that horror genre (maybe crime too) but it never really did any of the sort. It has jumps scares, which at first, when you barely have any information about the movie is slightly effective. However, those jump scares are just that, a jump scare and it does not lead into anything. I expected more. Half-way through the movie, when sufficient information have been given to clue you in on the direction it wants to take, it gradually lost its lustre. By then, it focused a lot on the supernatural and the ideas within the film began to feel too much. Some of the ideas were interesting, and some of them were straight up dumb. Which definitely impacted how scary this movie could have been. Good thing though, the production is excellent and Janella Salvador is in it.

migseu,4,"*long review & slight spoilers ahead* ""Mallari"" (2023) had the potential to be a compelling film, but unfortunately, it fell short of expectations. The plot felt disjointed and rushed, with certain plot points (such as the astral projection and the curse) introduced abruptly and without proper development. The narrative suffered from trying to do too much (shocking considering the runtime), ultimately deviating from what could have been a more focused and impactful story.While the film attempted to address the theme of mental health in the context of religious influence, it missed the opportunity to delve deeper into this complex issue. Instead, it resorted to familiar Filipino horror tropes, relying on excessive ""fear factor"", predictable and unnecessary jump-scare placements, and plot twists that detracted from the overall narrative. I wish they could have possibly explored the Marxist perspective on the use of black magic as a form of resistance by the oppressed class against the ruling class, instead of just completely antagonizing/demonizing the workers of the Mallari family.One redeeming aspect of the film was its cinematography and color grading, which were visually striking and well-executed. However, the technical merits couldn't salvage the film's shortcomings in storytelling and thematic exploration.""Mallari"" could have been a powerful commentary on the historical and social context of mental health in the Philippines. Instead, it became a fictionalized account that missed the opportunity to engage with more profound and meaningful themes. I can’t help but have a sour taste on my mouth given that we live in a political climate where history is being distorted, and where this film got its inspiration from is still a piece of history. Overall, ""Mallari"" is a film with unrealized potential. Its narrative flaws and heavy reliance on genre conventions overshadow its technical achievements and prevent it from being a truly impactful narrative.",2023-12-28,0,0,watch,False

pancakeiku,2,"RANT!!! I am somewhat conflicted in my response to Mallari. I entered with high expectations, but ultimately, it left me underwhelmed. There's an undeniable awkwardness throughout, and the pacing often veers into monotony, making it a rather tedious viewing experience.I had anticipated that the film would delve into the historical context, particularly the pre-colonial era, but it ultimately proved to be deeply disappointing in its handling of these themes.Mallari exhibits considerable potential, particularly with its intriguing exploration of the Mallari family's fate. However, the narrative raises more questions than it answers. The absence of Fr. Severino Mallari and the convoluted time-travel subplot only deepen the confusion, leaving me disoriented. The muddled timeline, coupled with a growing sense of disengagement, detracts from the film's overall impact.Didi's scene is deeply problematic, as it presents a portrayal that is highly discriminatory, particularly from the perspective of societal norms and, more pointedly, the Church's viewpointThe film's departure from its historical premise is both baffling and disappointing.

mettypie,1,"Mallari (2023) even on its last minute doesn't know what it wants to be. It's a great disappointment knowing it supposedly had a solid premise - the true story of the country's first serial killer Fr. Severino Mallari who murdered 57 people in the 1800s. The film looks good yes, and boasts of its cinematic experience, but it is empty and without a soul. The narrative was so chaotic you get annoyed with the jump scares. IDK but it wants to be horror, suspense, comedy, romance, eco-soci comm, address mental health, provoke gender issues, introduce folklore, and a gazillion more. It was just plain too ambitious wanting everything all at once and all that's left was confusion. The next time you write a film, please decide on what to become.

domfr_nc,1,"""Kaylangan kong mahanap ang sisiw."" 🤦‍♂️Just because you pile on a bunch of concepts doesn’t mean you’ve got a passable movie, especially when it’s sloppily executed. The story takes itself seriously, but the more serious it gets, the more it feels like a joke—mainly because it's so ungrounded. Honestly, it would have been better if they’d embraced the chaos and made it a sci-fi, romcom, or horror flick. At least then, the absurdity would have felt intentional.Let’s talk about the good stuff first: the production and art direction are gorgeous. It's a visual feast! It’s like a beautiful Instagram post that’s way too carefully curated—but then you read the caption, and it’s just gibberish. The problem is, like most Filipino horror movies, the plot spends more time explaining things than actually doing things. It’s like the filmmakers thought, ""If we talk long enough, the audience won’t notice the lack of substance."" But guess what? We notice. A lot. The dialogue is shallow, the characters have zero depth, and their motivations are as clear as mud. You’ll be sitting there wondering why they’re doing what they’re doing, while the movie just hands you a 20-minute monologue to explain it all. The narrative doesn’t match the gorgeous production design, and it’s a real shame. The film is 2 hours and 9 minutes long, but trust me, it feels like 4 hours. You’ll be checking the clock, wondering if you accidentally signed up for a director’s cut of ""The Lord of the Rings"".",2024-11-18,2,0,watch,False

I thought Piolo Pascual did good playing multiple characters. I'm not familiar with the origin story, but it sucks that this involved witchcraft and a manananggal. Could've been nice if it's a straight up serial killer story. I also didn't like the editing of this. There are scenes that shouldn't be there. Scenes that didn't make sense and should've just been cut. Anyway, I guess the fight for the best modern serial killer Filipino film is still on.",2024-11-02,4,0,watch,True

hanajoyb,2,"= Spooktober Film No. 2 🎃 =No'ng lumabas trailer nito last year, gustong-gusto ko siya panoorin. Ang ganda kasi ng plot, at mahilig ako sa mga horror set in ancient times. But having watched it today, super na-disappoint ako. Sayang kasi e. Nando'n 'yong potential to be the best horror released in a while, pero wala e, sinayang. Ay pa'no ba naman sadyang napakagulo ng kuwento. Hindi mo maintindihan kung ano ba talagang gusto nitong gawin, ano ba gusto nitong sabihin. Hindi naman 'to 'yong tipo ng pelikula na may deep meaning at hindi madaling intindihin, pero heto't 'di pa rin maintindihan. Daig pa nito jowa mo sa sobrang dami ng mood swings. Tapos lipat-balik pa ang gimik ng naratibo. Paulit-ulit binabalikan at ine-explain ang mga pangyayari kahit obvious naman na. Buti sana kung may naidadagdag sa kuwento e. Pinahaba lang tapos bibigyan tayo ng lintek sa pangit na conclusion. Masyadong naging ambisyoso ang pelikula na 'to. Napakaraming gustong mangyari. Napakaraming unnecessary na dinagdag para magkaroon ng ""WOW, I'M CONFUSED THIS MUST BE GOOD"" effect sa manonood. Akala ata effective. Daig pa nito Dingdong mixed nuts sa sobrang mixed bag. Ang pinagkaiba nga lang, mas masarap 'yong Dingdong. Hindi ko rin bet 'yong special filter na ginamit. Napaka-unnatural tignan. Hindi ko 'to kayang seryosohin no'ng una kasi parang sobrang obvious na pelikula lang siya. Tipong walang effort na paniwalain tayo na totoo 'yong mga nangyayari (kahit na based on true story siya). Mas nagmukha 'tong comedy horror. Sino ba namang hindi matatawa kung gano'n ka-cringe ang script. Ipinilit pa ang GenZ slang kahit hindi akma. Wala chemistry si Piolo at Janella. Super cringe ng scenes nila. Isa pa 'yong saksakan scenes halatang ang layo. Nakailang taga na buhay pa rin. Sa 57 na tao na pinatay ni Fr. Mallari, iisipin mo expert na siya manaksak pero hindi pa rin pala. O baka mapurol lang 'yong itak? Ginawa niya 'tong career pero 'di siya nag-invest sa equipment?

Hindi ko alam pero parang dun lang sa eksena na yun nagpakita ng mahusay na acting chops si Papa P. Pangit din writing dahil sa mga exposition dumps ng mga karakter nila Carlo, mga kasambahay sa bahay ni Severino, at mga Mallari boys ni Papa P mismo. Wala akong paki tuloy nung nagddrama na mga characters nila dahil hindi ko sinasabayan yung progression ng istorya habang nageexposition dump sila ng walang ka dating-dating. PROS:Ganda nung color grading at cinematography. Hindi ako expert sa costume design at sa time period na sinusubukan nilang i-visualize sa pelikulang ito pero believable naman ang sets at costumes sa uneducated kong mga mata. Lastly, trip ko yung ideya ng istorya na gawing backdrop ang ibat-ibang time period sa kasaysayan ng Pinas. Naalala ko yung ginawa ni Park Chan-wook sa The Handmaiden. Kung yung pelikula na yun ay nagpapakita ng mastery sa storytelling through film sa pamamaraan ng eye-catching yet purposeful camera tricks, realistic performances, at subtle but poignant writing, etong Mallari naman ay nagpakita ng amateur na version in comparison.

pooploverz69,3,"The film kind of reminds me weirdly enough of something like Psycho 3. A competent film with a bit more to say than the last, but definitely not enough to feel like a worthwhile experience.Because, there have been quite a few films similar to this over the past few decades. Films like Mike de Leon's Itim, Erik Matti's Seklusyon, Rico Maria Ilarde's Altar. These films have fascinating explorations on the difficult truths of a nation's collective past, on the definition of the family unit, and about the melding of religion on the Filipino's consciousness. On paper, Mallari has all three in spades. But, it also has the disadvantage of having a conflated story with very little to say once everything has transpired.I usually enjoy pointless genre films like those from Eddie Romero, but this one takes itself so seriously. Too seriously. I couldn't bring myself to take any of what I saw seriously, because there was nothing really thought provoking being forwarded. Yet, the film seems to act like it has something really impressive to say like M. Night Shyamalan wrote it. It shows a lot of punch with its special effects, but nothing underneath all the bells and whistles.A lot of the scenes felt particularly stagy and stilted. Seeing Piolo Pascual swallowing that cursed gastropod thing did nothing for me. And more baffling than that is this obnoxious musical score and sound design. It really takes you out of the narrative, which wasn't particularly absorbing in the first place.Personally, the very first time I had a mania for films was when I was a kid sifting through tons of horror classics. I remember falling in love with Tod Browning's Freaks, Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and bawling over William Friedkin's The Exorcist. I always felt that horror gave the biggest thrill and the most exuberant high of any genre. But, I feel myself more and more disappointed the further along I see from a genre that holds a lot of sentimental value for me.Overall, Mallari feels more like a half-baked cool idea for historical fiction combining a spiritual, sci-fi element with a scary real life figure, as opposed to a compelling drama of genuine, purposive scares to bring something meaningful on what it's based on. The film is terribly forgettable.",2024-09-05,3,0,watch,False

cameronwjohnson,5,"Welp, I sure hope no Philippine moviegoers mistook this for the more inspiring Piolo Pascual biopic on a subversive priest during Spanish occupation. It sounds like ""GomBurZa"" is a more profitable Christmas release than I thought, but all other Mallaris can take comfort in this being about distancing from that name. In the 1810s, Juan Severino Mallari seems to be a perfectly decent priest in Magalang, until he discovers that a cult got a hold of his mother. He saves her soul by taking on a double-life as a serial killer whose moralistic slayings throw the town into turmoil. Over a century later, amid the Hukbalahap Rebellion, Johnrey Mallari is working on a documentary about his great-uncle when he realizes that there may be something to his delusions. 2023 finally brings it all down to Jonathan Mallari de Dios, a physician who is summoned to Malang by a disturbing vision, only to be swept up in murders committed by a lookalike priest. ...Okay, this is at least definitely no biopic, but it may be a little too easy to mass-market.We Westerners have seen too much Jack the Ripper fanfiction for me to call that take on a historic serial killer inherently distasteful, but the ancestral slasher fantasy is indicative of the film's clumsy visions. Things are already destabilized by the lack of rhythm in how this corresponds three storylines across two centuries, that wildly convoluted structure being even harder to invest in for the respective subplots. Each storyline is also overdriven by some regressive agenda, with the 1810s probably being less grating in its Filipino religious nationalism because it's too distant from modern audiences. The 1940s is an almost comically exploitative caricature of American colonialism and xenophobic representation (Oh, we didn't have that many serial killers then... I don't think). Before you tankies start in with ""Well, actually!"", the 2023 storyline is hardly woke as the lineup's most archaic slasher, with such clunky archetypes as a stupefying transphobic murder fantasy. These inane trappings and the flimsy dialogue they entail steadily overwhelm the convoluted narrative, folding its ambitions to the usual overproduced style, jump scares and exposition. Mostly, the rote supernatural slasher is distinguished by overambition.The extensive nonlinear and historical plotting practically demands your attention across 130 minutes of almost mean-spirited narrative gymnastics, ever-focused on building some grand scheme. The Philippines' ""first serial killer"", a paradoxical figure in his own right, sets up an interesting allegory for the nature of evil as it evolves throughout history and manifests in a lineage. However you feel about the kind of allegory that would start with ""Juan Severino Mallari couldn't have been that bad if he was a priest"", there is compelling character drama unraveling with the twists along this transgenerational saga. It helps that Piolo Pascual is really good at capturing the unique natures and emotional layers of his three characters, when half of the cast's acting is arguably the most horrifying part of the movie. For all of the dynamic production values and lofty storytelling around a chilling supernatural lore, I'm afraid a lot of this is typical trash horror. And as such, it matches its campy charms with genuinely freaky visuals and atmosphere, and kills or action scenes that are gruesome without being too sensationalistic. It's passably made for what it wants to be, but the first problem is that it doesn't fully know what that is.This struggles for find coherent pacing in its wildly nonlinear story, bound by awkwardly moralistic subplots and clunky writing unto classically cloying pop slasher/horror tropes, still elevated enough by the intriguing plot, themes and lead performance(s) for those rousing thrills to salvage Roderick Cabrido's ""Mallari"" as a soul-chilling, if a little braindead representation of evil through history.2.75/5 - Fair",2024-08-01,1,0,watch,False

evilmonolith200,5,"Good:1. Great performance from almost everybody in the cast. JC Santos is such an underrated performer! 2. The killings and the gore scenes were well-done. Not over-the-top but still effective and bloody.3. The. Jumpscares. Work. They might not lend to anything of narrative value but they will make you jump. To me, that's the real test of their efficacy. 4. Excellent music, production design and colour grading. It does not look like the typical cheap Pinoy horror film!Bad (Spoiler territory):1. Too many ideas were incorporated in the screenplay. Serial Killers. Time Travelling Piolo. (Oh what I can do with this power!) Vigilante Killings. Supernatural Creatures. Cults. Ghosts. Improper cooking of Dinuguan. They tried to make it all fit in, but the result was an unidentifiable dish. It hurts more when you think about it after watching the movie.2. The monster effects just threw me off. Why bother if you can't make them look good? I imagined the transformations to be on the level of The Howling (1981). Come think of it, how does a movie that old still have better transformation effects??3. Unresolved plot threads. What about the parish priest? How would you live in an area serial killing dozens of people without drawing attention, (especially when you were previously the prime suspect)? 4. I felt that they introduced time travel to push the exposition forward. But goddamit it's so messy. 5. There is a better version of this movie.

Heck, he could avoid all of this if he probed more into the clue he got from the future.I didn't mind the folklore stuff since it was believed that the mother was cursed, but it made the time traveling/astral projection just a plot device rather than an integral part of the story, which wasn't even explained much in the film. The script became messy and incoherent. And don't get me started with the horror aspect. Genre-bending films like Mallari are always welcome and it gave light to an interesting part of Philippine history, a parish priest and a serial killer, Fr. Juan Severino Mallari. However, it just fell short on the direction and script as it tries to force different fictional elements.

Tunay na maraming posibleng sagot mula sa manunuod, ngunit naging sapat ang paglalahad ng pelikula sa kakaibang misteryo sa dalawang pamilya. Sa kabila ng pagiging isang horror movie nito, kung lalagyan mo ng humor ang panunuod, mapapasabi ka na lang sa huli na dapat talagang nagsasagawa muna kayo ng background check sa mga kasambahay na kukunin niyo dahil baka pasahan kayo ng sumpa (char!). Sa kabuuan, maganda at ibang atake ng Philippine horror movie ang Mallari. Sinabayan pa ng mga mahuhusay at premyadong aktror kaya talaga namang hindi ka mabibigo at magsisisi panuorin.",2024-07-21,0,0,watch,False

itsearlthepearl,9,"At the side of the discussion of ""Gomburza"" (2023) as definitely the Filipino film for that year lies ""Mallari,"" which had a plot and premise that is so inviting and attractive. I love how this film was composed, coming from a historical drama which (unfortunately) removed its history and replaced it with folk mystery. As a horror film, it brought the classic tropes that make it as a recognizable 2020s Filipino horror film, much like the curse that the Mallari clan supposedly carried. The plot was mostly well-done, with a decent sequence (maybe except for some parts), the cast also were done well. Add to that a sprinkle of existential moralizing about personhood, decisions, the past, and the future. It has the perfect concoctions of an Eastern / Asian movie with Western elements. Although some points for improvement: I wish that there were less jumpscare moments that did not progress the plot forward, more historical elements melded into the mystery of the curse, and BETTER MUSIC, which I believe should have been filled more with orchestric slow music that conveys more drama than horror, which could also make its frightening atmosphere lasting and subtle.",2024-07-20,0,0,watch,True

aleiaanies,4,"a few thoughts on mallari!!!!!! i didn't dislike it but i also didn't love it the way i thought i would. i anticipated its netflix release for a long time and i wish i could say that it was giving everything and more,, but given my misguided, and quite frankly, very steep expectations the only thing i can say right now is that it was extremely promising if only they focused on the structure of the story better and made more practical choices. by practical i mean mostly in terms of the special effects for the creatures and the way they aged the actors. they could have just used prosthetics and other more tangible effects and it would have looked far more believable and less jarring/out of place as opposed to the visual effects that were present throughout the entire material. as for the story!!!!! i really liked the way it enriched and utilized lower mythology and how they incorporated the various time periods in the philippines. the superstitions, mixed with factual elements, and everything in the story comprising and lending filipino-ness to the film was refreshing as opposed to the constant cliches and re-hashing of tired tropes from the west in most horror films we encounter in mainstream filipino media. the antagonist was easy to spot early on in the film, i think it was a mix of the foreshadowing/direction and the acting. perhaps they could have made less obvious choices on both the acting and script to be able to make the reveal less predictable. also there were parts in the script wherein they could have removed the dialogue. too much tell and not enough show!! there were so many unnecessary monologues and it kind of removed me from urgent scenes wherein i would have appreciated just SEEING what the characters were saying out loud. it's a film!!!!! SHOW don't TELL right? the story also only really picked up its pace in the final 1/4 part of the entire running time which is a bummer. honestly it could have been trimmed down if only they removed some unnecessary monologues. if they did this the pacing of the entire film could have been better i think. overall i enjoyed it, i just felt disappointed because it could have been a cinematic masterpiece.",2024-07-17,0,0,watch,False

Pakiramdam ko lang din parang pilit yung pagkakacorrelate ng ""sumpa"" sa ""pag-ibig"" dahil para sa akin, real love is not a curse but a gift.P.S. Sana mag-improve pa yung CGI work sa Pinas para naman tumaas ang kalidad ng special fx dito sa ating bansa.

Half-baked and too questionable din ang motivations ng characters, masyado silang 2D. Di naman magets bakit ulol na ulol siya para isalba si Janella at ang nanay niya. Relationships were established merely on dialogues (told instead of shown) na ""gagawin ko lahat maisalba ka lang"" pero walang concrete foundation ang motivation niya para makaconnect ang audience sa character ng mga Mallari.Wala ring subtlety, obvious na yung info pero sasabihin pa rin ng characters, para tuloy akong nanonood ng nga skit namin nung high school.

oraclecypher,8,"SPOILERS AHEAD So, my boyfriend and I just watched Mallari yesterday and it didn't fail my high expectations. It deserves the hype. As usual, I'm going to be analyzing and rating the film.I think the story is great with parallels. The transitions between different timelines work really well and it's not confusing. Great choice of the cast too. Each of them has their own singularity. It is very well-written and the storyline is just superb. There were a lot of jumpscares in this movie but there are times that it wasn't necessary. Undoubtedly, Jonrey is the best Mallari. He sacrificed himself to end the curse with him – even if it means not having to see his kid. He did everything in his capabilities to protect his loved ones.With Fr. Severino, he didn't want to do it in the first place. You could see that he was having a moral dilemma between his beliefs and his love for his mother. I couldn't blame him, I'd honestly do it too. And Jonathan. Oh Jonathan, you selfish fuck. I understand that you mean well and you wanted the love of your life to be alive but fuck you for being selfish. You only think about yourself. You never learn. You brought the curse back to life to save your fiancée, but did you really save her? Or you just turned her into a monster that hates your guts? All you guys wanted was to have a family, and now it won't be possible because of your selfishness. One more thing, I don't get the hate about the sisiw part and manananggal part. I think it plays a crucial role in the film. It doesn't deserve the hate huhu. The ending could be better but in totality, I could say that this was one of the best Filipino movies I've seen.",2024-07-10,0,0,watch,False

I was expecting a crime/thriller movie, which could've been good and way better rather than mixing it with fiction, gulat ako may aswang na nadamay tapos yung sisiw na lipat ng lipat ughh. Had the potential ganda na sana. Many scenes in the movie are anti climax, jumpscare that had nothing to do with the plot but still proceed to scare the character wahh scary.I cannot explain how I want just a simple crime/thriller movie that isn't mainstream or indie typa movie.

The movie was more leaning on the aswang, kulam, curse type of Filipino horror story, more than focusing on Mallari's POV. However, the characters were great.

Or something along the lines. If we reach quite a bit further, the shoe will fit.I’m a strong believer that Mallari is also big on middle child propaganda. Chz. Johnrey just raised the bar, and he never got down from there. The ending, tying all the stakes to Jonathan’s choices, love, and mistakes, is probably the only end of the road that I will accept given that this film’s agenda was to take things up a notch from the current movie landscape that can be seen in our locality. Johnrey (being my favorite of the Mallari men, so let me once again shine a light on him) was there to create contrast, moral ambiguities, and drive the stakes into an extensive pitfall—and the pitfall was just that, balls-deep. Mallari, then, for all its worth and not just the ending, was an adventurous take of the Filipino supernatural lores, the historical figure that heralded the first serial killings sighted in the country, and the ambition to create a noir motion picture avant-garde among films in the industry that are still struggling to get away from the love teams and third-parties formula. Perhaps, the glaring criticism to be made is the shortcomings in execution that anchored what turned to be just potential by the end. A lot of efforts have gone into this and if we nitpick each of them, I am fairly certain that on their own, these individual efforts are granted high praises. In some aspects, however, when they are expected to work well together, they grapple with finding such a way to actually mesh in compatibility—but end up leaving one, two, or the other on a rather lackluster note, holding back what could have been a remarkable sequence. (There are choices that I disagree with, among them, sequences that translate to transphobia and hate crimes against prostitution—but to further name a few of these choices, this review would do well on that.)That is to say that, though I agree with the choice for wrapping up the primary character’s story, among (above-mentioned) other things, the progression of his character could have been subtly shown and fine tuned throughout the film. Alas, with such an extravagant narrative filled with complicated layers, the movie being too busy, the ending became abrupt. On the note of acknowledging Jonathan, his storyline couldn’t have happened without the intergenerational storyline connecting the characters that Piolo Pascual embodied. It is with such element, aided by time traveling and the use of vintage themes, that Mallari became what it is: an explored genre. In spite of my criticisms, it was still a hard work to have made a movie such as this one, and even harder still to execute interconnected storylines resulting to an impressionable film—of that, it was never a doubt.I do hope that directors and production crews alike take note of choices, as expounded in the story, and the film itself in its entirety, for future projects.",2024-06-30,0,0,watch,True

aguynamedivan,1,"I wanted to enjoy this, gusto ko talagang magustuhan but there were too much choices in this na super distracting to me. I went in to this with high expectation kasi it was so well received during Metro Manila Film Festival 2024 but I ended up just being disappointed and frustrated, bullshit ba yung mga reviews nun? They heavily marketed this as based on Juan Severino Mallari's life, but it's not really?!?!? It's pure fantasy. Ang dami nilang creative input/choices that it reminded me so much of when Eugene Domingo was making a ""movie"" about Josephine Bracken's life in Ang Babae Sa Septic Tank 3 (2019). A time travelling serial killer? Seryoso ba? Also did they really try to justify a serial killer's actions? Sa panahon ngayon I feel like that is something the storytellers need to be careful with, example yung Netflix's Dahmer series; it's so crazy to think na that had some ""influence"" on some people. Not even 15 minutes in sa movie may mga cheap jumpscares na, they heavily relied on it through out the movie too, it got boring really fast. There was even one jumpscare na I'm sure they ripped off from Smile (2022), I never watched it but it was on trailer. Mallari also does a lot of telling and not showing; information dumping is so lazy. Why do we need to know why this random old lady has a long life? And bakit kailangan natin malaman yung wife ni Johnrey Mallari is like a coconut na brown on the outside and white on the inside??? Like, So? ANO NAMAN?!? As a viewer, anong use ng information na to? The movie is 2 hours long and I felt every minute of it, ang daming unnecessary scenes. And the ghosts and monsters in this! Holy sh*t, it looked so bad. Using CGI was really a choice, their faces ended up looking so goofy. To think na this is something they could've easily done with makeup/practical effects, like aren't we known for that? Nakita na natin yung talent ng Filipinos dun with the Shake, Rattle and Roll movies through the years! Were the filmmakers so cheap and it's something na ayaw nilang gastusan? And the 21 year age difference between Janella Salvador and Piolo Pascual; the Philippine entertainment industry needs to stop doing this. Like, maybe Piolo doesn't look it but he's old enough to be her Dad. Na he has a son na just a year older lang kay Janella Salvador. Mallari (2023) is way too goofy for me to even notice if the actors are doing good, or if anything in it is. Nakakagigil lang yung movie.Apparently there's another Juan Severino Mallari project in the works, but this one is an international series and starring Dennis Trillo, and said to be more of a biopic. P.S. I paused halfway through this movie because I needed a break, it gave me a headache. I watched Running Man Philippines' latest episode and then Sunod; another MMFF 2019 movie entry because I feel like I needed a dose of a good Pinoy horror movie.P.P.S.That scene of the manananggal flying around the room, obviously panicking and then it cuts to some characters just staring at it, mixed with the goofy looking cgi. Seryoso ba talaga? I ended up laughing so much during that scene. Even replayed it because it was so goofy na it's funny, it was the only scene in the movie that got a reaction out of me.",2024-06-30,1,0,watch,False

lordgallenghein,5,"Mallari (2023) was considered a historical thriller film but instead, we got a horror fantasy film that somehow got recognized by Warner Bros. One thing I must admit is that the film has great spectacular production sets & designs. And it's such a shame that it was implemented for this horror film with cheap jump scares and unnecessary time-traveling twist to make the premise so interesting. I wished the story should've been like GomBurZa. I actually do not know that this film is ""loosely"" based on Fr. Juan Severino Mallari, who is the first documented serial killer from the Philippines. I said ""loosely based"" because the film even adds two unnecessary fictional characters related to Mallari. The Mallari trio is played by none other than Piolo Pascual. It is very impressive for one actor to play three roles in this film, but his ""present"" Mallari performance was so unconvincing throughout the film, compared to his two roles. It would've been nice if Piolo just played the actual Mallari, not this make-believe storytelling.The story is complicated and it makes me wonder what are they trying to tell other than Mallari's actions for his killings. I can't get enough about this time-travelling twist. It creates a turmoil to its story that I can't describe and say anything positive about it.If Mallari take the GomBurZa approach as a proper historical thriller, it would've been a great film. But unfortunately, the film shall take its path for being a convoluting mess with great visuals and production design.",2024-06-29,0,0,watch,False

Piolo Pascual, and overall the writing of the main character Jonathan, I think, is a main weak point of this movie for me. Piolo was not believable as a doctor or as a filmmaker (maybe a little bit as a serial killer), his character is weakly fleshed out outside of the obsession with some vague thing with the house and its connection to Janella, and the moustache and glasses are just laughable. I was honestly more captivated by Lucas and the other mga mambabarang.Overall, needed paring down -- some roles were superficial yet occupied too much screen time (cough the kids and I mean all the kids, and the policemen cough) -- should imo have focused on Severino Mallari more, and not used godawful CG for old Gloria Diaz.",2024-06-28,0,0,watch,False

They clearly prioritized cinematography, but in a horror film, the horror aspect should never be overlooked. The pacing of some scenes and the editing were more painful to watch than the priest's killing scenes. On a positive note, I appreciated the fresh take on the famous story of the first serial killer.

A pretty good storytelling and a very nice acting by Papa P (🤣🤣🤣 i refused to call him any name otherwise, my aunts will be so proud)SFX aint that good but not bad either. Also, the song by the end are a pretty banger. The only thing is that if you’re not filipino and watched this, high chance you’ll be confused about the malignos and stuff. The folklore wasn’t explained enough and some people might not get the correlation between the supernatural beings and the chick being passed on to another person. It’s one of those movies where you have to search them by the end of watching it just to gets the supernatural beings much better but it doesn’t really affect the plot that much.

moresbi,5,"""Mallari"" was intriguing, bold and underwhelming.Seemingly a partly fictional, partly real life inspired account on the Philippines' first documented serial killer, Severino Mallari (keep in mind when! :O). I thought there's some cool stuff in the concept/ideas department, throughout. Really liked the structure too.Well, Piolo Pascual was pretty good with his various (quite well distinguished) roles. Several other neat contributions from the cast, particularly from JC Santos.I thought the movie went a bit over its head, to be honest. Both plot and execution-wise. On a more ""focused"" perspective, the plot has a few glaring plotholes and some underwhelming execution (particularly where action and horror are involved, for the most part).Several different approaches: some better, some worse (personally, I didn't enjoy some of the jumpscare technique with the editing). Two bigger scenes... one head-on, another avoided.The plot/story, while well structured and definitely intriguing, on a closer look, should feel quite shallow in a few regards.The latter stages were reasonable, particularly again structure-wise.I didn't particularly enjoy the ending, though it should be ok-ish (if you enjoy the ""reason""; I didn't and I missed some wickedness, for sure).Overall, an ambitious and interesting movie that I felt went for more than it could manage, though it's certainly understandable that you should go for it ^_^ I felt the plot could've been stronger, particularly around the ""origin/reason"" and the execution could also have been better. The horror elements felt lacking, particularly in several (avoided) scenes. But I think they did pretty great in creating something quite interesting around the ""main story"" element. I think this can totally be a 6 too but I'll fall back to the reasonable 5 for this one.",2024-06-26,34,0,watch,False

heyyitsiosef,7,"Mallari tackles the intersectionality of religion, faith, folklore, culture, history, and science. Spanning three different timelines, I think it was presented pretty seamlessly, though it could have been executed better. I think this performance if Piolo Pascual is a bit lukewarm. Despite their short appearances in the film, JC Santos and Janella Salvador had great performances here.For the most part, it was a bit sad that the film leaned more into the cheap jump scare horror when it could have capitalized on the opportunities brought about by religion and humanity. However, it would take a certain awareness and attention to detail to realize that there is a deeper horror embedded in the film - that love is a curse, and the lengths that a person will go through for the person they love, regardless of the consequences they face in return.",2024-06-25,0,0,watch,False

Like, men are so stupid and unreasonable. Jonathan, darling, I get it—it's Janella Salvador, but really? Father, why is the wig weave showing like that? (Tatak Pinoy films to have bad wigs, I said what I said). JC Santos, that nose acting, bro. I'm so frigging tired. I don't even watch horror, but those jumpscares did nothing to me—they are just jumpscares and didn't add anything to the plot.I think in this day and age, we would all rather die than be a maligno. I also would like to point out that he became a werewolf at some point, and the cinematography used shadows—and the shadows were cheap in form.
