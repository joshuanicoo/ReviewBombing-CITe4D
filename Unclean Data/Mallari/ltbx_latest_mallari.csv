goldwinreviews,5,"A man goes back in timeto figure out the mystery of a serial killernamed Mallari.Halos lahat ng pwede mong makita sa isang horror thriller film ay inilagay nila rito. Nakakatuwa dahil kaya pala natin makaisip ng ganitong konsepto na siksik sa iba’t ibang elemento.Hindi lang siya basta patayan, habulan, sigawan. Maraming pasabog sa kwento na tila walang hangganan. Sunod sunod ang mga plottwists sa dulo at wala itong hingahan.Piolo Pascual gave his usual good acting. You can see the distinction among the three characters he is portraying. Gloria Diaz was graceful. Geraldine Villamil was terrifying. The performance of JC Santos was impressive and applaudable, serving as one of the film’s highlights.The color grading, scoring, sound design, and cinematography altogether gave a thrilling atmosphere. The movie’s original song, composed by Quest and interpreted by juan karlos, is a powerful appropriate soundtrack.Mallari’s greatest strength still lies on its concept. The effort to be a different kind of horror film was seen and appreciated. If watching 𝘔𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘢𝘳𝘪 means getting better horror stories, then count us in.Let 𝘔𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘢𝘳𝘪 be the start of something new.READ FULL MOVIE REVIEW HERE:www.goldwinreviews.com/post/mallari",2023-12-20,11,0,watch,False

slasherhimbo,8,"Hilarious... Uncomfortable... And one unique hell of a ride!Mallari, though not perfect, still offers an enjoyable horror flick that has FILIPINO smeared all over it, be it 1800s, 1940s, and the modern times... and even has the legendary monsters we all grew up hearing about... but of course with a unique twisted flavor! Piolo Pascual devoured not once but thrice with his triple role! The twist was a lil predictable but executed just fine making this whole experience satisfying enough for me! Also plus points for the #kapampangan represent! Janella Salvador did such a serve too!Do note that despite this being based off a serial killer, it is highly fictionalized, so if you're expecting a biopic, you'll surely be disappointed!I'm glad to see that ph cinema is alive and well! it was packed 😍",2023-12-25,3,0,watch,True

tamboexit,,"Gusto ko lang sabihin na hindi ikinahiya ng film na ito ang transphobia & criminalization ng sex work - baka kasi kailangan lang din masabi sakaling may nakikinig, so yeahhh…nakalulungkot.Anyways, the concept could have been a top tier religious horror/suspense/slasher/thriller (heck even camp) but it was horror only during the sigawan moments. After that nothing was sustained. I left the theater na walang baon pauwi. I learned nothing new abt Fr. Severino Mallari, what was his real motive labas sa fiction…or idk 🤷 which was real and documented (ang ganda sana i-explore). Di ko rin maiwasan ikumpara sa Seklusyon ni Erik Matti which was for me, an eye opener to the horrors of the Catholic church. That film perfectly blended horror + criticism on the Catholic church. I remember leaving the cinema with lots of questions on Catholicism. Dito wala, purely entertainment. Pero yun nga, gets ko kasi ito ay MMFF at hindi Cinemalaya (pero MMFF din naman yung Seklusyon kaya lang that was a different time I guessss huehue).So sana ibang direction naman ang tahakin ng Severino ni Dennis Trillo (looking forward to that).PSLove the gays beside us screaming “Go Valentina!”📍 MMFF 2023, SM Lipa",2023-12-25,50,0,watch,False
cee_jay03,6,"Let’s get the good things out of the way: Piolo Pascual is terrific portraying multiple characters, each of his character given just enough time to be fleshed out in a 2-hour runtime. The production is gorgeous, a really big step up here for Filipino cinema.I admire the concept of this film, has so much potential to showcase a unique Filipino horror experience with a touch of history and historical fiction. The history side of things was handled pretty decently, but unfortunately the horror itself is the singular thing holding this film back, relying on the usual cheap jumpscare tactics, with lackluster use of its unique atmosphere to build up dread and tension.This film could’ve been so much more than what we have, but at the very least I’ll give it this: it is a step-up from the generic Filipino horror rubbish that we get every year.6.5/10",2023-12-25,2,0,watch,False

kandreamt,7,"Initially gave this four stars after leaving the theater, but after giving it some thought I’m taking it down to 3.5 😭Mallari (2023) boasts impeccable set design and costumes that make each time period feel robust yet still feel lived in. Pascual and Santos’ performances carry a lot of the weight of this film for me with Pascual delivering in all three roles and Santos’ grit as Lucas. Janella Salvador’s Agnes also packed a punch despite her somewhat short screen time. Apart from Pascual’s portrayal of each Mallari, the film’s choice of anchoring each era to the conflicts that affected the Filipino of its period. The feudal tensions of the 1800s and the CIA Aswang psy-op gave more body to the time periods presented. The burden each Mallari carried through time eventually made that ending make sense to me. Greed, on both systemic and intimate levels, drive the motivations of each character. Considering all of this, what made Mallari (2023) fall flat for me was its horror aspect. I am no expert on the horror genre and seeing this film made me want to read up on it haha lol but I found that the jumpscares eventually felt cheap, predictable, and unnecessary. The CGI also faltered during one scene with Doña Facunda, though it warrants a pwede na from me kasi di naman siya ganun ka-distracting. So ayun! Also the girl who played Felicity looks like she knows what an iPhone is so medyo di bagay sa time period. Anyways, fun movie!

franzhalili,8,"A smorgasbord of horror genres that worked well!Watching Mallari is an journey and the ride paid off really well. The film had such an interesting oremise and promise that accounted for a fictional spin on a historical event that shaped the town of Magalang, Pampanga.Pao Orendain's lenses played such a big role in making sure every beat was felt and audiences were immersed. From the colos and light8ng used up to the choreography of the camerawork, it was a feast fornthe eyes. The overall production design was superb as well. Having three eras worth of costumes, props, sets is a hard task but it was executed really well. Everything felt too realistic and you can't deny the time out into crafting each set.But of course, the acting performances of the cast are the highlight. Piolo Pascual delivered such a great take on three distinct personalities from three different time periods. From the murderous priest, steadfast documentarian, up to the persistent doctor, all Piolos had their own personalities and nuances. Best actor calibre performance.JC Santos and Gloria Diaz also shone in their roles by delivering really strong and powerful performances. As usual, JC Santos was amazing and undoubtedly a strong contender for Best Actor with this performance. Meanwhile, Gloria Diaz was eerie, creepy, and committed. Last time I saw a strong Gloria Diaz performance like this was way back in ""Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo"" & its sequel and ""Nasaan Ka Man.""Special shoutout to Paps Raffy Tejada! Again, giving life to roles he's portraying. He's a breath of fresh air amidst the eerie fele8ng this film gave off. Kuddos.Kuddos to Direk Derick Cabrido for successfully mounting such a great film.

lowwwwwwwwenz,5,"The story is a filmmaker's dream, inspired by the events of Fr. Severino Mallari's killings, it's a complex and expansive story, going back & forth through 3 centuries worth of lore. It's also an opportunity for some gorgeous production, showcasing 19th & 20th century dialect, environment, and aesthetic, which this film brilliantly executed. The storytelling itself left something to be desired, where more proper character exploration were more than welcome. The killings as well is something that is promised but weren't fully delivered.It's worst aspects are it's delivery of horror, its plot twist, and ending. It has the worst standards of Philippine horror filmmaking, or rather, the standard is the worst, relying solely on loud sounds and jumpscares. They could've saved it with the make-up & design, but it's not enough. The plot twist can be seen a mile away, being able to call it out by a single scene. And lastly, without a doubt it's worst liability, is it's ending. It tries to be smart, aiming for shock value, but instead comes across as self-indulgent, and downright idiotic. It's a classic horror trope that thinks it's clever, but rather dumb.The concept and ambition is worth checking it out, but it really just can't shy away from the worst tendencies and shortcomings of Philippine horror clichés, which is a real shame as it has everything going for it to be a trailbrazer & change mainstream Philippine cinema for the better, but i guess for now, this will do, and i hope it's enough to spark more films like these.",2023-12-25,13,0,watch,False

It’s a mystery/psychological thriller/folklore tale mashed into historical account of the very first Filipino serial killer.Almost all tropes from recent horror films, such as the Insidious, The Conjuring, and even The Nun series of films, appear in this film. Filipino filmography-wise, it has a touch of Nocebo and Ang Mga Kaibigan Ni Mama Susan.Despite it being so convoluted, the film managed to deliver a horror film that showcases the talents of its ensemble—Piola Pascual cementing himself as one of the actors in the industry to not underestimate.Personally, these kinds of stories are my jam.

charles2002,6,"The plot of this film was promising, they could've focused only on the astral projection ability of the Mallari clan and build something on that alone but what happened was, they stuffed so much subplots to cut the loose ends. As the film progressed, the aswang element was added, then the caretaker element, then the curse (sisiw) inheritance, and so on. It became less interesting to me because of those subplots. I was expecting it to be a psychological horror like The Shining but the subplots kind of ruined it. Still, this film offers something new and leaves a lot of room for discussion, there is so much to unpack. Again, I really think the subplots were employed to remove the plot holes and I think they are successful in accomplishing that objective but at the expense of a better storyline.",2023-12-25,5,0,watch,False
patgallardo1999,7,"""Walang Diyos Sa Gabi""Mallari is a horror flick that is surprisingly good. There are elements that you would not expected to be added in this film. It has shockingly many twists and turns in this movie. If you thought this is a typical slasher/ serial killer movie, then think again. The cons of the movie is many annoying and unnecessary jumpscares. The beginning is also confusing and some characters are cringe to watch but the middle point of the movie will definitely recover what they did to the beginning. Also, the cinematography and performances of main characters is surprisingly good and it is worth to watch. Masasabi ko lang na may pag asa pa ang pelikulang Filipino pagdating sa horror. Dapat tayo wag mawawalan ng pag asa at least we are improving and learning from the mistakes. P.S.

sandwichspy,4,"There is a point somewhere in the fuzzy third act of Mallari where a character named Agnes confronts one of the Piolos [there are four] in this movie, where she tells him: “I knew you before as a doctor. Now you’re telling me you’re a fortuneteller.” I felt her confusion so hard. Because this movie is exactly like that: it does not know what it wants to be.Because what is this? A movie about a historical serial killer? A movie about a crusading documentarian during the American colonial period? A movie about a lovelorn doctor? A movie about aswangs or manananggals? A movie about American military propaganda against the Huks? A movie about rural beliefs? A movie about social justice? A movie about the servant class eating the rich [or at least the sinful]? A movie about proto-TikTokers? [See Felicity’s final filmed confession.]A movie about ... time travel?When the time travel element was introduced, that was when I finally decided to just suspend all my longing for this movie to make sense, and just surrender to the horrendous absurdity of it all.Fact was, I was so ready to do that already the first instant Mallari wanted to underline its horror elements [mostly through cheap jump scares] by announcing them with screeching music that bludgeons the viewer to pay attention and be scared. [Screeching music. A ghost!] But it doesn’t help that they mostly announce ghouls who just stand there — and do absolutely nothing of consequence. The movie does this ad infinitum that by the time we reach the 999th jump scare, you’re just ... numb with boredom.Which is sad, because the story of Fr. Severino Mallari — the 18th century Filipino priest who is marked in our history as the country’s first recorded serial killer — is already so rich with narrative possibilities. Just following that story, even if the filmmakers have to embellish it to make up for the lack of concrete historical data, would have sufficed. But screenwriter Enrico Santos, perhaps fearful that he didn't have enough material to constitute a screenplay, opted to fictionalize by making this a story about a curse transcending generations, threading it all with the very hoary device of ... time travel. That’s what you call a choice.A lot of the narrative elements of the film was certainly a CHOICE: killing off Mylene Dizon in the first few moments was a choice [hello, Drew Barrymore in Scream!], and then bringing in her cowering boy to the last few minutes to round off this story with an arrest was a choice; a priest spouting off “woke knowingness” and then the film proceeding to demonstrate the “kill the gays” trope was a choice; having exactly three paintings of distant ancestors hanging in an old house as shorthand for character introductions was a choice [the other ancestors don’t matter to this family?]; Elisse Joson’s acting as a bitchy Felicity was a choice; the predictability of JC Santos’ character arc from the moment he encounters Didi was a choice; the lack of serial killing was a choice; the humanizing of the serial killer was a choice; demonizing St. Bartholomew [and then making a post-script to deny this] was a choice; Piolo’s bad wig and fake beard were a choice; having characters do mouthful expository dumps as dialogue at crucial moments of high drama [to explain away gnarly narratives] was a choice — but that one with Gloria Diaz explaining the existence of a time-traveling descendant with a knife to her throat was icing on the cake; the fact that there’s only one kind of moon — a full moon always bathed in red — was a choice.I was so excited to watch this film, and purposefully made it the first MMFF entry I would watch for 2023. I left the theater wondering what could have been if the screenplay was better. Sayang.",2023-12-25,91,0,watch,False

christiankobe_,7,"“Ang isang tao ay kabuuan ng kanyang mga desisyon… minamahal… at mga pagkakamali.” (A person is made up of all of his decisions, beloveds, and mistakes.)i am usually hard to please when it comes to horror but Mallari was a pleasant surprise. the plot, particularly, piqued my interest: an origin story inspired by the very first documented Filipino serial killer, who happened to be a small town parish priest.Cabrido could easily make this a docu-style retelling but no. he took the material up a notch, made it an intergenerational story of the Mallaris, time-travelling in vignette storytelling, to unlock and reconcile each other’s past. honestly, that’s inextricably hard to land and i applaud the film just for this alone. the picturesque cinematography is just cherry on top. the vfx choices aren’t its strong suit. sometimes, i also question the relevance of its rather abundant jumpscares. that’s forgivable, at least for the most part. but you can’t dismiss how fresh this film was; how it was able to build such a unique tension with the audience made it bridge all of the mentioned shortfalls. overall, this film is a bloodcurdling picture of love—a curse in itself—as to what lengths it would take to love someone, even if we’ve become the monster ourselves. would you still call it love… or a curse spellbound?[Metro Manila Film Festival 2023]",2023-12-25,101,0,watch,False

spidejrr,5,"Isn’t loving someone also a curse? If they did the usual and conventional type of biopic, it would have been a lot better tho. Nonetheless, I like this film to an extent, so much potential. I just hoped they explored the psychological and emotional turmoil Fr. Mallari has gone through as well as how he was persecuted and convicted. It would have been nice to see Mallari’s point of view and constant agonize and suffering going through his thoughts and with the people around him. Honest take is: real life stories are much scarier than the typical jump scares. I also don’t feel the astral projection and time travel thingy and not to mention, the sudden manananggal and werewolf scene we all didn’t see coming. However, we could not just deny the fact that Piolo and John Carlo did carry the film all throughout. They were spectacular and eerie. The real story is in itself something that would keep us at night. Focusing on the series of sudden murders in 1810 as well as the human leeches of his life would help us retrospect better the unfortunate era. After all, Mabuhay ang Pelikulang Pilipino. Kudos to Team Mallari.",2023-12-25,2,0,watch,False

jaydee_reels,7,"Ang ganda ng konsepto ng pelikulang 'to.At first naguguluhan ako kung saan ito papunta but once the threads started to make sense talagang nabibilib ako how well-crafted the mystery surrounded this movie.For a Filipino horror movie, napaka-husay ng production design at cinematography nito. Makikita mo mismo ang kaibahan ng tatlong timeline dahil dito.Piolo Pascual delivers distinctive performances, consistently adapting to the story's different timelines. From an innocent to killer gaze, talagang matutunaw ka kay Papa P.The film's strength was showcased in the third act of the movie. Serving the final conclusion in each needles they've build up at the start of the movie. Maaaring minsan bumabagal ito at tila nawawala sa momentum ngunit naibabalik nila ito kada nasasagot ang mga itina-taas nitong mga tanong.What I don't like about Filipino movies is they always tend to hold back with the ending---luckily, Mallari doesn't!Alam ng Mallari ang storyang gusto nitong italakay at tuloy-tuloy nila itong inilatag.

It's hard to talk about without giving too much away, but we can start with the horror aspects of this, which largely involve jump scares that don't actually lead to anything. Like, I guess the ghosts are just there to play pranks on the characters, like they were TikTok influencers.But here's an example of something dumb: at one point, the main character is handed a film reel that he's been looking for by a girl who apparently just had an encounter with the ghost. To be clear: this is a film reel that holds vital information regarding the very reason he's gone back to his family home in the first place, potentially giving him the answers he's been looking for in order to prevent some future disaster.In the next cut, we see him sweeping in the garden.

Unfortunately, what they ended up with is a film facing a serious identity crisis. It desperately wants to tell so many stories but fails to dive deeply into most of them.

Mallari at nung may rumor na gagawin siyang pelikula hindi na ako nagdalawang isip na ito ang unahin kong panoorin mag-isa. Afterall, im a sucker for history talaga at istorya ito first documented serial killer priest sa Pilipinas. Ang ganda na napakita nila ang tatlong magkaibang time period sa pilipinas at mas lalo ko pa ito nagustuhan kung paano nila ito tinahi at na overlap dahil sa ***tooot***. Huling-huli nila ang atensyon ko rito kudos! Epektibo ang mga jumpscares, may iba rito na ramdam mo na agad pero meron rin na di mo akalain na may gugulat. May mga cliche scenarios na sa tingin ko naman ay hindi mawawala sa isang thriller film pero sa tingin ko naman ay naging smooth pa rin naman ang panonood ng pelikula. Medyo disappointed nga lang ako sa ibang dialogues na sa tingin ko ay mas better na i-reword o isulat. Masaya na nalahad sa pelikula na ito ang iba’t-ibang issue at kultura sa Pilipinas. Nandito ang ibang topic katulad ng classism, imperialism, greediness. Isama na rin natin na napakita rito ang iba’t-ibang myths at folklore na kinalakihan natin. Kudos sa editing. Grabe ang linis at ang ganda ng mga cuts ng bawat seq. Ang ganda ng mga biglaang cuts at transitions na nakadagdag ng pagkagulat sa mga manonood. Isa pang hinahangan ko ay ang production design. Wala ako masabi dahil ginawa nila ito from scratch. Taas talaga ng respeto ko sa kanila 🙌🏻And to Piolo, GRABE KA TALAGA. Sobrang galing niya rito at hindi na ako mabibigla kung ibigay sakanya ang Best Actor Award. Napakadaming karakter ang kanyang ginampanan sa pelikula na ito at SLAAAAY si phiepasaur sa lahat. Pinakapaborito ko sigurong karakter niya ay si Fr. Severino. Tangina. Tangina lang. Kitang-kita mo yung pagiging banal at pagiging creepy niya at the same time. May isang scene talaga ako roon na pinakapaborito ko at di ko malilimutan. Lumabas nang sobra ang galing ni Piolo sa aktingan. Kitang-kita mo ang pagiging takot, pagkalito, at pagiging desperado niya. Grabe galing. Kay JC rin! Grabe sanay ako makita siya sa mga cliche romance films pero masaya ako na ibang character ang na portray niya rito. Bagay sakanya ang mga ganitong genre at character!Overall na enjoy ko ang pelikula, i just wished na sana mas nag focus ito sa lumang panahon pero gets ko naman na kailangan ng spice para mas maging kakaiba.

acebron,5,"A promising concept centered on the Philippines' first serial killer who is a priest, but ultimately wasted by filling it with multiple ideas. The movie spans tropes from thriller, sci-fi, folklore, historical, romance, even family drama genres. Many interesting threads woven together, sure, but the design of this script could have been less busy so we could appreciate each one – personally, I would have liked more of a story behind the dark magic stuff so that it would be less of a twist in the final act and more of a creepy world long hidden in the shadows. Also, since the main character is a priest, a peek into the social climate of the church-centered 1800s provincial barrio would have been interesting (though I guess we already have Gomburza in the MMFF lineup to show us something like it). This is a horror movie with high-quality visuals, so you'd think the scares should at least be good. But no, they're all cheap jumpscares carried by a loud score or sound. I will admit that being in a packed theater contributes to a better viewing experience. People were really into it, screaming at the right parts, laughing at the right parts, anticipating with bated breath the (sometimes predictable plot twists) at the right parts. Mostly, it's thanks to a solid cast led by Piolo Pascual as three different characters and his friend Lucas played by JC Santos. Technically, aside from a particularly bad CGI scene, this is a decent feat for the Philippine horror genre. If only it were more focused.Full review here.",2023-12-26,157,0,watch,False

Mallari and their cursed bloodline, and succeeds only because it's clear that Warner Bros. really poured money into this. Plus points on it's creativity and ambition but its faults of overstaying it's welcome is prevelent. The messy pacing, editing, and story makes for a complicated albeit entertaining watch —carried by Piolo Pascual. Maybe Fr. Mallari's silhouette is enough to make this a memorable, maybe somewhat Hollywood 90s campy, horror film but, really, to hope for that is foolish.

pm1spicy,8,"Mallari excels as a mystery/thriller, skillfully interweaving Fr. Severino Mallari's story with Filipino mythology, delving into themes of love, sacrifice, and the supernatural. For those seeking heart-pounding horror and intense scares, this might not cater to your expectations. Piolo Pascual's outstanding portrayal of three distinct characters remains a highlight, although some supporting actors struggle to match his depth, impacting the film's overall cohesiveness. Additionally, attempts at modern dialogue occasionally feel forced, aiming to resonate with contemporary audiences but often missing the mark.However, it falls short in certain technical aspects, with some special effects momentarily disrupting the immersion. Moreover, the excessive use of predictable jump scares might disappoint those seeking a more nuanced and suspenseful thriller experience. While the narrative's non-linear structure converges effectively, some scenes in the first act might feel eye-roll-worthy. Despite these initial hiccups, Mallari gains momentum over time. The clever interweaving of timelines culminates in a gripping third act, redeeming the movie's earlier flaws. Noteworthy performances, including JC Santos's compelling contribution, complement the film's exploration of mythology and folklore.Ultimately, Mallari remains a captivating watch for enthusiasts of intricate storytelling, showcasing Pascual's remarkable acting abilities. As it navigates through love, sacrifice, and the supernatural, Mallari's imperfect yet engaging portrayal leaves an indelible mark, resonating with those fascinated by the depths of human experience and the enigmatic allure of Filipino folklore.Peak Filipino cinema is back on the menu.",2023-12-26,26,0,watch,True

The dialogues were cringey. Aside from JC and Piolo, the supporting cast didn’t help in elevating the movie. I don’t know if its bad writing or the actors didn’t give the script justice. The insertion of humor is unnecessary and didn’t add anything to the table. I wish that they have stick to a specific storyline of the 1st Pinoy serial killer instead of adding storylines involving Filipino mythology and creatures.

yenfilmreview,6,"The nonlinear structure, intercutting with three different timelines, finding the connection with its sometimes steady or stagnant pacing, finds its way nowhere near home. A must-be realization for Enrico Santos, the screenwriter.The killing never stops, but producing a big project with magnificent visuals with, no disrespect, a very disappointing writing shall stop. Forty-five minutes into the cinema, the film finally makes sense that the intro is trying to foreshadow — manlalakbays.No question about it. However, the use of jump scares to prolong the first act of the film is way too traditional or 2000s. Those do not contribute nor give any hint at all on why Piolo is in search of answers to their three generations of Mallari’s story. Admittedly, the first hour can be shortened to 15-25 minutes. Remove the jump scares. Just do not feed anything information through visuals; then that alone is enough for the audience to feel the genre. A bummer, still, is the used dialogues to tell a piece of information about either the timeline of the present or the story of past Piolo generations. It could have used the very evident big budget to convey information through visuals instead of throwing lines. Imagine, the film is visually pleasing and plausible, but it does not give anything or help in the progress of the plot. Such, such a waste of opportunity.The detour part of this journey is beauty — production visuals and cinematography.All-in production design. The worlds, as in three different timelines, are well put together. No one dares to refute or even question its costume or the artistic choice; the use of wardrobes and prosthetics. It speaks so much about how the audience accepts the world is shown, displayed, and given to them. Not an easy task to build a world that the audience can easily comprehend, but Mallari does it, and mind you, building THREE TIMELINES. Moreover, the sound design and music score need recognition. Although the need for a revisit in sound mixing due to its inconsistent loudness is a must, it still is a world-class quality. These perfectly and exactly convey the emotion of the characters, as well as the atmosphere of different sequences. Neither a riser nor a drone are instruments or techniques used in the film. An example is the use of bells as a score while killing the landlord in 1812.Feels bad for Piolo Pascual in a good manner. He looks exhausted by performing three characters with different distinctive personalities but conveys it justly and rightly. He may soon retire after pulling off such a performance in Mallari. No one can do that.Despite the negatives, the film counters its flaws through a good, well-thought mise-en-scene. The job of director does well in directing, putting all together by using each department’s strengths while masquerading its lows.In simple terms, the film is in the right hands, the right job, and the right driver. Writing aside due to its being subpar, all goes well. The audience just needs to learn and get used to it.",2023-12-27,3,0,watch,False

anjelx1,6,"The concept of having three generations of Mallari, delving on folklore and catholicism is the strength of this film. Although it was based from the true story of Fr. Severino Mallari's serial killing, it was fictionalized by creating a generation of Mallari to show how love and curse overlap over the course of time. Is curse inevitable, is anything done for love be justified, are the existential questions that can be seen with the acts of the three main characters. However, despite its good points, it has to be said that it has dumb and unnecessary parts for the sake of being called horror, like most horror films, of course. It holds so much potential. Maybe that's why it's ambitious for wanting a lot to happen. Glad that transitions are good in the middle because the beginning seemed shaky to me due to its overuse of jumpscares (that are, by the way, predictable). Also, I see that it has to involve folklore, but does it really have to include the scene of Facunda transforming into a manananggal (just one of the many weird stuff)? The belief of killing to save more lives is enough to incorporate it. As to script, it's as if there's not much research on language use. As a Kapampangan, the sudden switch from Filipino to Kapampangan to Filipino again didn't seem natural, as if it was only used to show it explored the setting but failed nonetheless. The usage of Tagalog as to period is a bit inappropriate as well.Overall, the attempt to tell the story of the first serial killer in the Philippines in a creative way is something I can appreciate.

Parang sinasabi sa atin na lahat tayo ay may bersyon ng sarili nating halimaw. And this clearly seen in the movie. His mother’s curse had its own form. Years later the curse takes on a different form when it moves to its next body. And along those lines we discover how intergenerational trauma is passed on.At the same time it lets us explore the deep end of what we can do when we are pushed to the brink. How much of ourselves we are willing to sacrifice in order to save a loved one. Blurring the lines between right and wrong. At napakagaling ni Piolo Pascual having to portray 3 different characters struggling along those lines.Hindi ako as much a big fan of jump scares but i appreciate it when done well.

It had all the classic Pinoy horror tropes but what got me was the edgy concept by the second half.2. Didn't see any trailer prior watching and I thought it's just a murder mystery. Without spoilers, crazy elements were thrown in the mix!3. There were lots of cheap jumpscares and creepy vibe.4. Not a fan of the special and practical effects used as it's quite laughable. That wig and facial hair's hideous.5. Paired with Janella Salvador and Elisse Joson, they could've picked someone that's Piolo's age.6. JC Santos was really outstanding.7.

legendaryl06,7,"It's no wonder that the huge studio outfit Warner Bros. Pictures Philippines distributed Derick Cabrido's timeline-jumping horror flick. After all, it's riveting and perfect for mass consumption. ""MALLARI"", partly-historical, partly-fictional, horrifies with its convoluted yet easy-to-follow storylines of three generations amid murder, mystery, and supernatural folklore. Piolo Pascual brilliantly plays three different characters that are well-meshed in its narrative. Its thrilling score and effective jump scares (although I wish there's more slow burn approach) make a good form that we don't usually experience in most Pinoy horror films. However, there's that miss of questionable mesh on time travel and astral projection and the pitfalls of telling vs. showing narrative technique that makes the execution a bit dull. The third act redeems itself with its intense buildup and that eerie final frame serving a nod to the endless horrors of society.San Bartolome. Doña Facunda. Magalang.

Nakakakilabot dahil ang kwentong ginamit ay may hango sa katotohanan at nakaugat sa mga bagay na kinatatakutan ng mga Pilipino.This film reinvents how Filipino horror stories were told. Marami ng pelikula ang patungkol sa mga kwento at paniniwala ng mga Pilipino pero ibang klaseng takot ang naramdaman ko rito. They utilized those elements properly and effectively.Ang pelikula ay isang malaking paglalakbay. Ginawa nila tayong manlalakbay dahil sinama nila tayo sa pag-aalam ng misteryo at sikreto sa likod ng pamilya Mallari. Sinigurado nila na mararamdaman natin ang kanilang mararanasan, makikita, at malalaman.Nakadagdag din ang magandang cinematography sa pagbuo ng intriguing na atmosphere. Nakapagbigay kilabot ang scoring para mas matakot ka pa lalo. Paniniwalaan mo ang kanilang mga practical effects na ginamit. Ilan lamang ang mga ito sa nakapagdala sa atin sa kanilang mundo. Each timeline has its distinct feel and tone, at napanindigan ito ng mga tao sa likod at harap ng kamera para masiguro na iba-iba sa pakiramdam ng manonood ang bawat panahong pinapasukan nila. Dinadala nila tayo sa iba't ibang panahon at mararamdaman mo talaga ito.Piolo Pascual definitely gave his A-game into this performance. He knew how to give that flare and nuance that will make his three portrayals different from each other. Kaya ka niyang palungkutin, pakabahin, at takutin. He is deserving to get recognition and appreciation because of his performance. He deserves that best actor award. Magagaling din ang mga ibang karakter at bagay ito sa mga artistang gumanap sa kanila. Janella Salvador had this sense of style na siya lang makakapagpamalas. Geraldine Villamil knew how to evoke terror. Elisse Joson blew my mind with her polished attitude. Ms. Gloria Diaz gave something that we never see from her until now. But out of all of the supporting characters, Jc Santos provided the most shocking performance. Dapat mong abangan ang kanyang pagganap dahil madadala ka sa kanya nang sobra.Most importantly, ang pinakanagustuhan ko sa pelikula na ito ay ang kanyang mensahe. Hindi lang siya about sa kuro-kuro ng sambayanan kundi pinakita rin dito ang mga hirap ng pamilya at ano ang makakaya mong ibigay para mapuna ang mga ito.This is a historical story of a family trying to escape from the terrors of the past that continue to creeps the present and that could greatly affect the future. With all that in mind, they knew how to tie all of it together in a jaw-dropping ending. Marami ang hindi ko inakala sa pelikulang ito. Hindi ko inakala na ganito ang kanyang kwento. Hindi ko inakala na sisigaw at matatakot ako nang sobra. At higit sa lahat, hindi ko inakala na makagagawa ang Pilipino ng ganitong klase ng pelikula.

invadersim,5,"Two Piolos wrestling each other? Now that’s cinema!(Spoilers incoming)This almost worked. The 1800s sequences, in particular, are the film’s shining moments. It was creepy and almost compelling — the occult infiltrating Christianity/the oppressed tearing down the elite from the inside are proof that this should’ve been a period piece.Still, this particular section of the film is also riddled with sins. The crux of it (showing how Father Severino started with his murder spree) was believable but was not strong enough. You mean, Father Severino is so downtrodden in faith that he resorted to do…that? In one request? The film didn’t even allow the character to explore options or resist. A film about a crisis of faith? What! A missed opportunity. He was just a piece of this convoluted puzzle. And when his faith was shattered. No one batted an eye. His relationship with his mother wasn’t explored enough nor who Father Severino really is — again why this should’ve been a period piece that began with his childhood.Well, this was tooled to be commercially successful and how else to fulfill that but peppering with deadly tropes — time travel, astral projection, love is also a curse shenanigans, innocent ghosts who also like scaring people for the heck of it, a dozen of jump scares, and TikTok humor?

As the film was running I was thinking of how they were going to resolve the story and while I couldn’t, at the time, pinpoint how I would want the story to wrap up, I could very well list a handful of ways how I wouldn’t want the film to end and, without spoiling anything, I think they really stuck the landing with that ending.We may have different tastes and what we look for in films may be different but, Mallari, as a whole, is a film that just works, at least for me.

This is noteworthy as I don't watch them that often.However, it is also different from what I expected. I was anticipating something of a biopic, telling the story of the first-ever recorded PH serial killer. The direction that the movie took was a bit different, but it's fine, as it was still interesting.For me, the jump scares were not that effective. Considering that it is a high-budget and relatively costly production, you would expect great ones, but most of them were just cheap jump scares carried by loud sounds. The film also focused on too many genres, such as family, horror, comedy, and fantasy, to name a few. I wish those concepts were not overloaded so that we could focus more on the lore.The character of Lucas (JC Santos) was not that convincing, given that he had a huge role. It felt lackluster due to his character's development.The pacing and direction were mediocre at best. There were some highs where the theater was excited about what events might unfold next, screaming and just being hyped. However, there were also disadvantages, such as in the first act where the film was kinda hard to follow.On a positive note, the concept itself was enticing since it's about horror (my favorite genre), and the Philippine mythology was also showcased well.Piolo Pascual also looked great and proved himself to be a versatile actor. His supporting cast also did really well, providing twists and more diversity.All in all, the concept was interesting; it just was not executed to its fullest.

There's one scene, though, where he transforms completely. Regardless of how the scene is set-up and built to be this important, his portrayal of this character is utterly diabolical. So good. I won't spoil. You'll know what I mean when you see the film. It is JC Santos who is consistently impressive in the film. His evolution comes to a riveting performance deserving of recognition. Watch out for this one scene where he outshines his co-actor. The film could have done more in terms of VFX. Its score could have been tempered for a more dramatic effect, but despite what the film lacks, it achieves something remarkable for the genre.

In the performances, Piolo did his best portraying these three separate individuals from different timelines but it did not help that JC Santos outacted him in almost all of their scenes together. The 3 characters also needed a bit more distinction but still a commendable performance nonetheless. But probably the biggest blunder is how it was overscored.

At first, I was a bit skeptical on how the three timelines will be showcased properly in a 2-hour film yet the movie surprised me on how cohesive it is. The plot is out of this world for a typical horror film but it surprisingly accomplished its goal. In a very well manner at that. The scoring and the continuous shots are also superb, creating an eerie atmosphere throughout the duration of the film, especially in the intense scenes. However, some special effects didn't work but I'll let it pass as the story and the actors really did well to compensate for it.Lastly, I want to say that:Felicity, you are a mother to many!",2023-12-28,0,0,watch,True

kaarujon,9,"An exceptional horror-thriller film about extreme determination, but for the wrong reasons. I'm so happy that the Philippine entertainment industry has come out of its cocoon and is now ready to conquer the larger global market for entertainment content. Mallari is such a stunner. Editing made a seamless integration of time jump elements. The acting is superb; Piolo is exceptional in his portrayal of the three Mallaris. His short portrayal of the demonic hallucinations, though, was chef's kiss. The screenplay kept me thinking about how the movie would end, even until the last 5 minutes. My main takeaway from this movie is that peace as a goal, when achieved by killing socially undesirable people, is diabolical. And while we may have our own personal thoughts of unaliving bad people for the sake of a better society, it is our demons that are speaking for us. Fundamentally, the movie is a satirical expression of our human follies, including extreme desire, sanctimony, and lack of good judgement.",2023-12-28,0,0,watch,True

jikookiesncream,9,"“‘Di ba’t isang sumpa ang magmahal?”Mallari does not only showcase the story of the infamous Fr. Severino Mallari, but also delves into the lives of men from succeeding generations of his clan. The first descendant, Johnrey, a documentary filmmaker in post World War II Philippines, and the second being Jonathan De Dios, a doctor and the lead protagonist of the film. The two descendants of Fr. Severino try to discover their family’s darkest secret, which most likely has contributed to the killings and disappearances in Magalang, Pampanga.All three generations of the Mallari clan are played by Piolo Pascual, which is perceived to be difficult parts to play. However, Pascual was able to to help distinguish one generation from another and yet was able to establish the connection between all three characters.What also is depicted in the movie is the presence of important female figures in each of the Mallari men’s lives: Dona Facunda, Fr. Severino’s mother played by Ms. Gloria Diaz, Felicity, Johnrey’s wife played by Elisse Joson, and Agnes, Jonathan’s fiancee played by Janella Salvador. All three actresses gave the three women their respective well-defined characters which was able to show how each Mallari’s love for these women had urged them to take greater lengths, even if it will cost them their own morals.JC Santos does an excellent job in portraying Brother Lucas in the likeness of Brutus from Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, as he showcases his character’s loyalty and later betrayal to Pascual’s Dr. Jonathan.The film may remind one of Luca Guadagnino’s Bones and All (2022) with its presence of common themes such as gore and manslaughter. It is also important to note how both Carido and Guadagnino have commonly used manslaughter as a dark metaphor for love as a motive of sacrifice and self-discovery, which the former has executed very well and evidently in Mallari (2023).It also bears similarities with Edgar Wright’s Last Night in Soho (2021) not just with the presence of gore and manslaughter, but also with the key theme of time travel, which the two Mallari descendants have used in order to learn about the dark secret of their family for this film.The film had a well-organized flow of events, as well as a smooth transition in between time periods. It was able to give me and other viewers proper context and a good idea on how to let the story unfold and think about what could happen next. However, Jonathan’s arc was very anti-climactic towards the end yet it established his arc as an anti-hero.Another thing to love about this film is that not only did it have Gothic themes and the use of the Catholic faith, which are associated as Western literary and cultural elements, but it also incorporated the use of Filipino folk medicine and faith healing, which are indigenous Filipino cultural elements, as important parts of the film.In conclusion, Mallari (2023) was a great watch, and it definitely deserved the accolades. Not only did it bring justice to a dark love metaphor, but it also presented and promoted Filipino culture through folk medicine as key horror elements. It is a must watch for traditional Filipino horror movie buffs and those in need of a fresh face to Filipino horror films.[Metro Manila Film Festival 2023]",2023-12-26,0,0,watch,True

For Mallari, The presence of a tangible threat stems from our protagonist’s dream, and the fact that he can see.. zombies? It deeply fails to create a sense of narrative urgency it needed until about halfway through, where suddenly it livens up its form and picks up a lot of heat.

I love the idea of astral projection and time travel as it is not often seen in Filipino Horror movies, however, I feel like it got too much that you'd think this is not about Padre Mallari anymore. Also, I don't also feel any chemistry between Piolo and Janella. They feel more like Uncle-Niece whenever they're together. And although, it's been instilled multiple times that Jonathan (Piolo) is obsessed with Agnes (Janella), I still don't feel it. Like they were not able to translate it on screen. Also the theater in Evia fucked up the sound system so all through out the film, I was in a sour mood.Furthermore, It's been a while since I've actually watch a Pinoy Horror film so I was amazed by the camerawork.

kuyaed,6,"MMFF Marathon Disclaimer:I went in blind to all MMFF entries this year, no idea on it but the poster, didn't even check the genres. So expect me being surprised on most things.I liked it just because I love Piolo Pascual and JC Santos (most of all JC, but let's talk about that later) but I gotta admit storytelling of this has lots of room to improve.It had a lot of jumpscares from ghosts that didn't lead to anywhere. I expected some payoff on the ghosts other than who they were, which was obvious on the getgo.When it was a slasher horror by the first act I was engaged gotta admit, but when the second act started and the time-traveling sci-fi direction went on the film kinda lost me. And when it went more fantastical by the third act by introducing witchcraft and a literal ""manananggal"" it lost me completely.As this is inspired from real events, I wish they just added upon the plot inspiration since that is an interesting story itself. I was just put-off on the closing title cards where they debunked their own story just to clarify the real story, because it kind of defeated the film. I feel like they accepted that the past 2 hours were fictional but then opening titles said it was inspired from true events.On the brighter side I saw a LOT of improvements here. Color grade was stellar, and lighting design. Night scenes were still visible (ehem hollywood for making night scenes literal darkness), also the VFX and make-up for the spirits were BEAUTIFUL, the ""manananggal"" part, not so much. Also, the production design. Set served. The amount of detail put into that was STELLAR, I was nitpicking even the wax drips of candles and they were accurate and realistic, very well-thought.Also, Piolo Pascual delivered on different nuances of different eras which made his performance very distinct. Without reintroducing who is who even with change of wardrobe, I knew who he was just by posture and speech. But what impressed me more is JC Santos, both sides of the coin in the soft-spoken to the gnarly side he delivered. The plot twist was underwhelming but his performance gave it a bit of value added.Addendum:One dialogue didn't sit with me after they killed off Didi, it's along the lines of: ""She's a sex worker, she's a plague to society"".

I truly went into it blind and admittedly I am not a fan of horrors so this is your pass to bash me or just take what I say with a grain of salt. I am a fan of the time-travelling aspect, so I appreciated seeing that in the film. It was really interesting to see the ties between two distant pasts and the present entwined with family ties, fate, withcraft and all that... I loved it! I think that Piolo was fucking amazing in his triple roles, we are so blessed to have him in such a role on the big screen today. JC Santos truly deserved his Best Supporting Actor win, he is truly insane in this.It's kinda unfortunate the jumpscare horror elements did not really lead to anything, I feel the film could've made do with less of that or made these horror elements mean something than just cheap thrills. To me, those bits just hindered the atmosphere-building and it bothered me. It was a bit funny to me too though that the scenes that garnered most audience reaction were scenes that just involved people. I am also not a big fan of the ending, but I'll keep it at that for you to discover if you, dear reader, will like it or not.(* Edit: Just heard from my mom that there will be a series adaptation of Fr.

targrod,9,"The devil (heh) may care attitude of Mallari really went to a place of the unidentifiable in Philippine cinema. It got so smart with the fusion of genres and somehow, cheated its way in something that is very interesting and cheeky. The genre mechanics became as polarized and those who found value in it, cared no less and the silliness is a great add-on to its narrative.The thematic journey of defeatist films always has a lot to say about bad decisions and the value of good as non-existent. Case in point, Christian Tafdrup's 2022 psychological horror thriller film, Speak No Evil. Said film excessively warns the audience about the eventual demise of the couple, the acceptance of one's fate just sets in. Mallari though, tries to fight back with its barbs and your usual good should always win over evil.It's funny that the whole point of the film had an underlying message that is extremely familiar in the recent and current political climate in the Philippines. The characters are represented by people, factions, and the entire nation. It's a sight for social media and fantasy for the optimist.

The writing and direction takes you to a roller coaster ride in which you can hear the audiences squealing, screaming and nervous AF. A friend of mine said, “Hindi ako mahilig sa horror, pero, gustong gusto ko ‘to.’”Piolo gave his performance of the year. A veteran actor that reminded us that our stars are so good. JC Santos and RAFFY Tejada, two theater actors, did not disappoint. But what amazes me is the jumping timelines, spearheaded by a Haunting-of-Hill-House inspired writing: and what threads them together is our dreams, to think that history repeats itself, and it only needs one protagonist to sleepwalk and realize that his worst nightmare has become the reality in his waking life.Even the set design is built from scratch. Mallari threads as our newest breed of horror, giving us something new to look forward with the Filipino indie-mainstream scene. I’d like to believe we are witnessing a renaissance for the elevation of standards of the Filipino film. Walang kupas. Wala silang tinira. Lahat ng takot mo, hawak mo pa rin kalabas.

Lumalaban sa matinong production design, cinematography at blend ng practical at CG Effects.Okay. Kahapon pa ako eager isulat to.I left the cinema with pure satisfaction. Everything went really well!The script is superb. Nabigyan nila ng flavor ang isang historical document turned fictional narrative by slowly weaving 3 important characters and importing supporting leads and powerful events who did their part to the overall story. Madami siyang elements pero na-intorduce nila ito in an effective way--nag gu-grow sa audience lahat ng ginagawa nila at mga nangyayari sa pelikula. Naitahi nila nang maayos ito para humantong ang lahat sa isang thought provoking and heart pounding conclusion. The technical choices were powerful. I spot little technical issues, but it doesn’t drag the whole film quality down. Almost perfect and cinematic storytelling nila.Yes, may mga sequences at events na feel ko sana nai-revise or naisama sa final cut. Also wished it was more gory.But overall, it has delivered! (Its way better from the production’s 2022 entry (My Father, Myself))Natakot, nagulat, nalungkot, nainis at nagcheer kami sa mga characters at events.

cinephileckurt,6,"Mallari is a pretty ambitious film. It's a slasher, also a sci-fi because of the time travel aspect and also a period piece. It's a fictionalized story about Severino Mallari, a parish priest in Pampanga who is the first Filipino serial killer. First, I just wanna say that the visuals were pretty amazing. As a horror fan, I'm glad to say that we are now catching up. Andaming magagandang ideas at concepts sa mga local horror films natin, di nalang tayo paulit-ulit. Praise-worthy ang cinematography and production design dito. The score is amazing, it really fits to the tone of the film. Piolo Pascual really did served, one of his best performances, I like it when he plays characters outside his comfort zone. Also JC Santos is pretty good here, he really deserves that best supporting actor award. First time ko rin na mapanood si Janella Salvador sa big screen, finally she's in a horror movie that doesn't suck. The film does fall into the usual horror cliches unfortunately. First, the jumpscares, there are so many jumpscares here that are just so unnecessary. Ghosts appearing left and right accompanied by a loud sound, without any purpose or significance with the story and most of the time, they are just so predictable. Di naman kasi nakakatakot ang gulat eh, hinay hinay lang din sa paggamit.I also have problems with the script. It does overexplain a lot to the audiences. A noticed a lot of exposition scenes, this film is not for children, please let the audience think and piece together the mystery themselves or just show don't tell.Mallari is an enjoyable horror film with a pretty unique concept, despite doing too much, there are many things here that you will appreciate and as a horror fan, this MMFF is a great start to finally make original and good pinoy horror films.*Ang weird lang para sakin yung mga scenes ni Janella and Piolo, parang mag ama lang sila, sorry 😭",2023-12-29,4,0,watch,True

mundingsalao,6,"Initially, I found myself being quite nitpicky and complaining about a couple of minor details, visuals, jump scares and effects choices. But as the movie progressed, it grew on me and eventually captured my full insatiable attention. The story pretty much revels in its intruiging mystery. It's bold and deliciously insidious. Its wicked irreverence reminds me of films like The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. Piolo taking on the three roles reminds us of how talented he is as an actor and is pretty much capable of stretching his range. The music is powerful and tickles the horror fan in me with how much it effectively marinated the movie. MALLARI has a spectacular appeal that I enjoyed, and I was also glad to hear, once more, loud screams and reactions from horror cinema audiences. In a really good way, it reminds me of those great Pinoy horror comicbooks from the good old days.

Actually, more of they can go separately as I wished this was more of a psychological thriller than a fictional thriller. Some thoughts:- Cast was on the spot! Everyone was really good - even the side characters. And they felt more fleshed out than I expected!- Plot was good … till it wasn’t. But there were really good direction here but somewhere somehow it became off. I think when it was started to do expositions.- There were too on the nose lines and on the nose scenes. The blanket realization irked me the most as it was obvious but the lead had to have a line for it.- Production overall was well made - but I don’t know why but PH media (regardless whether high budget or low) felt cramped/limited. It’s like the invisible wall in video games that makes it feel small.With that said, this had potential and I thoroughly enjoyed it!

Are we able to escape the fate that has been sealed long before our parents existence? Is love really the biggest curse of it all? These are all the questions that came to mind as I was watching Mallari. Before I continue, I just wanted to point out that they executed the connection between the 3 generations of Severinos seamlessly. It was really impressive how they wove the stories of the different generations of Mallari into the final fate of the present one. He who determines whether a person is the sum of all his decisions or his mistakes. More than anything I adore films that evokes questions out of me. There's just this juvenile wonder that comes after witnessing a story unfold in front of you. Something about it makes my morale skyrocket. That, for me, is one of the factors I consider when writing about films I watch. In conclusion, I ask of you (to whoever may be reading this, anyone who doesn't have a short attention span like I do), to watch this film.

Embodying three distinct characters is no small feat. Unfortunately, he struggles to convincingly portray the nuanced differences among these characters, leaving one yearning for an acting style akin to James McAvoy in ""Split.""On the contrary, JC Santos delivers an outstanding performance, effortlessly stealing the spotlight from Piolo.But despite this, the film still struggles to evoke spine-chilling moments. It relies heavily on jump scares that, unfortunately, don't significantly impact the overall storyline.Also, the narrative style of withholding key information, strategically aiming for impactful revelations towards the end, serves as one of its major pitfalls. While effective in building suspense, this approach renders characters—especially Jonathan—somewhat devoid of logical thinking, an odd characteristic given his role as a doctor.Despite these shortcomings, the film remains a worthwhile watch for those seeking a fusion of scares and suspense.SCORE: 2/5#MMFF2023 #MallariMMFF #MallariTheMovie #mallari",2023-12-30,0,0,watch,False

sirmiroro,6,"Set in three timelines, Mallari is inspired by the first documented serial killer, a small parish priest Fr. Severino Mallari, and how the next generations in his family are influenced by power and madness. The film gave us three Piolo Pascual who embodied three distinct characters from the three timelines and while Mallari surprises local horror fans with its twists and turns and interwoven timelines, the overabundance of cheap jumpscares and tonal mishaps made it too overwhelming and confused about its own identity. The overall production design, scoring, and Pascual's acting are the main highlights of the film. When the timelines switch, it genuinely feels like a different timeline. The nuances among the three Mallaris were all vividly portrayed by Pascual. And yes, even with the horrible-looking beard was justified. My biggest issue with the film is its confused identity. It pastes a pastiche of horror tropes that becomes too much sacrificing the narrative value of the film. Had it carefully chosen a fewer element and given a premium focus on it, the film would have been much better for me.",2023-12-30,1,0,watch,False

You won't get confused about whether you're in Fr. Severino's timeline or with John Rey and Jonathan. The story of Fr. Severino, the first documented serial killer, blended seamlessly with John Rey and Jonathan's narrative.Despite some disappointment with Jonathan's decision in the final part, if you reflect on the beginning and why he investigated Fr. Severino, his decision becomes acceptable.The one thing I dislike about this movie is the excessive jumpscares. Although there are too many, only 2-3 actually startled me. Nevertheless, it remains one of the best Filipino horror films.Piolo (Fr. Severino, John Rey, Jonathan) is a great actor and a strong contender for the best actor award. He truly embodied Fr. Severino, John Rey, and Jonathan. I've seen many of Piolo's movies, but this one truly stood out; he excelled in all these roles.Bro. Lucas and Agnes (JC Santos & Janella Salvador) are also standout performers in this movie. People were screaming during their scenes. JC Santos truly deserves the Best Supporting Actor award. I'm also rooting for Janella to win Best Supporting Actress 😭 but why not her?Hoping for more Filipino movies like this, and I'm begging Mentorque to put Mallari on Netflix or Prime Video, pleaseeeee.

reeladvicenet,6,"Delving into three intertwining timelines and employing a time-traveling twist, ""Mallari"" presents an ambitious scope. While the writers were able to tame this beast with a narrative that manages to engage and leaving its audiences intrigued, the overreliance on jump scares and the occult fails to tie up effectively with the overall storyline. This heavy-handed (and unnecessary) approach to horror detracts from what could have been a refined, narrative-driven film instead.Dr. Jonathan Mallari de Dios (Piolo Pascual) embarks on a journey to his ancestral home in Magalang, Pampanga, in search of a hidden chamber from his childhood - a chamber purportedly holding a cure for his fiancée's (Janella Salvador) severe illness. Upon arrival, we're introduced to his ancestors: Fr. Juan Severino Mallari (Piolo Pascual), the notorious 19th-century Filipino serial killer, and Johnrey Mallari (Piolo Pascual), a chronicler of World War II in the Philippines for the Americans. As eerie occurrences unfold within the house, it becomes evident that his quest may bring more harm than good to his loved ones.In the realm of fantastical and supernatural cinema like ""Mallari,"" stringent logic isn’t always to be expected. There's always a give and take involved as we're delving into imaginary stuff. Yet, the fundamental plot struggles to find coherence. Elements often feel forced, serving the narrative agenda without solid grounding. The biggest question for us is why is there a need to continue the legacy of murders across time? While the rationale is clear in the 1800s in Fr. Mallari's time, subsequent timelines lack this clarity and cohesion. The handling of time travel also raises eyebrow-raising issues, from small stuff such as our protagonists modern-day attire back in time without issue to seamless communication across eras to bigger issues such as the reasons how the Mallaris are able to go selectively go back in time.However, the film's glaring misstep lies in its gratuitous use of unnecessary horror and jump scares. The continuous barrage of ghostly appearances lacks purpose, serving more to frustrate than thrill. It's apparent why they put this excessive amount in ""Mallari"" and ironically it backfires by producing the opposite effect. Despite these drawbacks, ""Mallari"" maintains a level of entertainment. It's fundamentally flawed but manages to strike occasional emotional chords, buoyed by its visually captivating cinematography and commendable performances by Piolo Pascual and JC Santos in particular. Surprisingly, a degree of attachment develops with the main characters, though the film could have greatly benefited from more refinement and streamlining. ""Mallari"" assumes forced scares are necessary for a fulfilling experience, missing the mark on delivering a cleaner and better narrative in the process.Source: www.reeladvice.net/2023/12/mallari-mmff-movie-review.html",2023-12-30,0,0,watch,False

melthing,5,"DISRESPECTFUL TO THE VICTIMS.HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO MAKE A FILM DEHUMANIZING A MURDERER MORE THAN HOW A NORMAL PERSON WOULD DEHUMANIZE A MURDERER IN THEIR OWN MIND.If you enter the cinema asking ""Why would this murderer kill 57 people? How did he do it? Why is he a priest? What's the significance of his faith to this actions? You'd be left unanswered or simply, disappointed. A lot of the answer you'd get from the story of the first serial murderer in the Philippines ISN'T what you'd expect. Because the film...... ISN'T what you'd think it is, it's a completely boring film. You'd ask, maybe a thrilling reason to his killings maybe? A cold-blooded vigilante? Nah, this film manages to capture every joke of an excuse for a horrible pastor. In one of the worst showcase of fable based ""true event"" story, this film completely shocked me by how corny and ridiculously blasphemous their written/chosen tale is and how it was executed.First, how did i get ""hyped""?1. This was produced by Warner Bros. So obviously, as dumb as i am, i assumed we had done something right cinematically or atleast screenplay-wise.2. Piolo Pascual plays several roles. Piolo's been one of the best at picking which movies to appear in and who's passionate to what they do. Being present in Lav Diaz's films, being the best actor (imo) in Erik Matti's On The Job 1, he is significant in starring and helping produce the most ambitious flicks out there. He is one of my fav actors in the industry and so, i expected such moving performance here and i was left disappointed.3. New director to me, obviously, filmbuffs watches films for directors and being a new director i expected an up-and-coming new prospect to the staling roster of today.4. The plot, i don't think there's no plot better and more interesting in a while.5. MMFF is BACK! They said, It will be FUN they said. Totally taking away a murderer and going fully to the stereotypically plot-twist engaged minds of Filipino cinema watchers. This flick does not move our overall filmography at all even being produced by such prestigious film production. I expected Warner Bros to teach us how to make a proper film, how to fix the wrongs that we do. Nah, they just gave us a big budget of which we wasted to VFX that Filipinos love and never do right, Unneeded plot-twist and the props/design of which is actually one of the few okay things they managed to do. So the visuals are good? Nah the cinematography, blocking, coloring and effort in framing overall just didn't help the film at all. The directing and editing is so abrupt at times as well, even cutting to improper angles or jump cutting without a hint of pace at all. The 3rd act felt so rushed yet so dragged by the end??? No sense of pacing, completely ruining their own thrill in the climax by rushing their cuts and scenes just to complete the slow and boring end to the story.Just an absurd choice of story, obviously this is from the tales they must've heard from the locals and connected it to what seems to be an engaging flick with its unique premise and even unique portrayal. But this just shows that those things are NOTHING without the talent of a director, the invisible string that'll try to make a joke have profound meaning. What the hell even is the physiological conflict in this? What's the profoundness supposed to be? It's a complete waste of a good topic or story to unravel. It's a complete mess in filmmaking and an emotionless try to make something intriguing. I don't recommend watching this (unless you're going to the cinema with the people you're happy with like i did so i left there feeling well nonetheless. How can they dehumanize such inhumane actions to the point that it doesn't seem inhumane anymore? It felt like a joke horror rather than a meaningful or cold story. Korean cinema would EAT this. Hollywood would KILL for this script. It doesn't surprise me that Philippine cinema is not good, obviously. But to ruin a what could be easily-engaging plot? That's just..... criminal.",2023-12-30,0,0,watch,False

makeenetics,4,"Mallari is an ambitious film. Based on the story of the first documented Filipino serial killer, the movie could have been a gripping tale of horror and suspense. But it took a different approach and unfortunately, the execution fell a bit short in some parts.Don't get me wrong, the time-travel aspect is certainly interesting. But it left me feeling a bit disjointed and uninvested in the characters. Maybe it's just personal preference, but I prefer subtly eerie horror movies, slowly building up to the big scares that leave me on the edge of my seat and screaming my heart out. Instead, Mallari relied too heavily on jump scares and loud music that didn't quite deliver. It worked on the first few times, but it lost its novelty after a while. I left the cinema not scared shitless, but instead laughing at what just happened.But let's give credit where credit is due - the production value was stunning, sans a few VFX parts. It's easily one of the most visually impressive films from this year's MMFF batch. If only they had stuck to what they were good at and taken more risks than they could fully commit to.Overall, Mallari had so much potential that unfortunately wasn't fully realized. But it's still worth a watch for the visuals and unique take on the Philippine horror genre.Seen at SM City Dasmariñas as part of the 49th Metro Manila Film Festival",2023-12-30,0,0,watch,False

I don't think any other local film in recent memory has attempted to take on something with this grand of a scope.The film was successful in establishing a sinister atmosphere and setting up the intrigue of how the three timelines intertwine. The non-linear storytelling challenges its viewers and helps keep the suspense alive. Back this up with excellent production and sound design and you have a very promising first half.Unfortunately, the film was not able to sustain its fascinating premise. The infusion of time travel, questionable supernatural elements, and unnecessary jump scares made for a clunky second half. The unraveling of the mystery didn't really feel satisfying and the promise of ""the first Filipino serial killer"" was not explored to its fullest potential. I feel like this would have been more successful as a character study instead of focusing on the supernatural side.Some elements hold it back from truly achieving greatness but Mallari is a step up from previous MMFF horror entries not named 'Seklusyon' and pushes the boundaries of how good the technical quality of pinoy films could be.",2023-12-31,0,0,watch,True

filmcirclerjct,5,"In this time travelling horror mash up from director Derick Cabrido, Piolo Pascual plays not one, not two, but four different characters from three different timelines.In the first timeline, we follow the newly assigned parish priest, Fr. Severino Mallari (Pascual) and his mother, Doña Facunda (Gloria Diaz) as they both settle in the sleepy town of Magalang, Pampanga, circa 1812. Here, we learn what drove him to become the serial killer that we know today.In the second one set in 1948, we follow his descendant, filmmaker Johnrey Mallari (played again by Pascual) and his wife, Felicity (Elisse Joson), as he investigates the mysterious case of his ancestor, Severino, who has killed 57 victims.In the present time, Dr. Jonathan Mallari De Dios (Pascual) returns to his family's ancestral home in Magalang to search for a way to save his fiancé, Agnes (Janella Salvador) from dying. He believes that the cure lies at the hands of his ancestors, Doña Facunda and Severino Mallari.It's admittedly an interesting concept, as the film presents itself as inspired by the true to life crimes of Juan Severino Mallari, Phillippines' first documented serial killer during the 1800s, predating London's Jack The Ripper by more than 60 years. However, all that potential is sadly wasted in this film.Penned by Enrico Santos and helmed by Derick Cabrido, this horror film feels like a multitude of films stitched together, thanks to its many story arcs and concepts. A big chunk of the film plays out like a slasher flick, as we watch Severino Mallari dispatching a couple of victims along the way. The film also plays around with the idea of time travel and astral projection. A portion of it also feels like a creature feature, while the remaining part is your standard ghost story, as the characters are occasionally terrorized by the souls of Mallari's victims.The film is enjoyable in some parts, but as a whole, it feels convoluted. At times, it even feels confusing. The script tries to make the merging of the overarching story arcs and timelines as smooth as it can, but it can't help but feel overstuffed and too muddled. Enrico Santos' screenplay also didn't fully utilize the concept, although I appreciate the film's outlandishness. Imagine, from a serial killer, we eventually get to see ghosts, witches and aswangs in one sitting. Although I did find the film's blatant transphobia a bit icky as it didn't sit well with me.Despite that, the film is undeniably worth checking for two things: its production value and the cast. The film looks very impressive, with Pao Orendain's slick camera work brilliantly capturing Marielle Hizon's highly detailed production design. You know they really spent time and money just by looking at those highly detailed set pieces and costumes, from that town church made from scratch to the period accurate wardrobe. It's only the CGI effects that looks pretty inconsistent. The film's sound design, courtesy of Immanuel Verona and Nerrina Salim, also gives the film a more immersive experience.On top of this, the performances of the cast are worth every peso. Gloria Diaz is committed from start to finish with her character as Doña Facunda, while Janella Salvador and Elisse Joson are both effective as Agnes and Felicity. JC Santos occasionally steals the show with his compelling turn as Brother Lucas, who helps Jonathan investigate his family's dark history. But it is Piolo Pascual who keeps the entire show running as he plays four different characters in the movie. His unforgettable performance here as Juan Severino Mallari, the latter's descendants Johnrey and Jonathan, and even an evil version of St. Bartholomew is definitely for the ages.It's not exactly scary, as it spends most of its time with jump scares that, while effective, are all forgotten eventually. It's no surprise that this one's pretty divisive, as your appreciation with the film will depend on how far you can take all of its silliness. But while it does fall short of its very high aspirations, this ridiculously bonkers and incredibly ambitious time warping horror mash-up is still worth every buck, thanks to its top-notch production value and its impressive cast, led by Piolo Pascual.",2024-01-01,2,1,watch,False

sphgne,4,"god-awful (pun intended) CGI aside, this film could have been better with a lesser theatrical script. the lines exposed so much of the character and the story without leaving room for mystery. about 20 minutes in I was already cringing in my seat – the script was just all over the place.the jumpscares got old quick, musical scoring was almost fine but it just gravitated between being loud and sudden to force tension into the scene. there were plenty of ""duh"" moments, too. at many points it felt like a play where the actor had to voice out his (very obvious) realizations. this film could really do with SUBTLETY – it's horror, let the people fear the unknown. don't lay everything out that quickly.acting-wise, I was relieved to see JC Santos take on a character that deviated from the usual sad lover boy trope – it's about damn time. Piolo was great, Janella looked promising (the script really botched her potential lol I mean what the fuck was that ending???), Elisse was also alright.costume and makeup were phenomenal, though. the plot alone (or the main actor alone) is enough to draw a lot of people in, but what i really liked about this particular story is how it alluded to a particular saint – it's a strong artistic choice to make that story up for this film. i just wish the script delivered both more and less to make all of it come full circle. parang ang daming gustong mangyari ng writer (time travel, true crime solving, witchcraft/black magic, religious cult, filipino mythology, demonic possession...etc.). isa-isa lang, lol.",2024-01-01,0,0,watch,False

aphrod,6,"Ika nga ni Gojo Satoru, ""Love is truly the most twisted curse of all.""Watched this movie's 6:00 PM screening at SM City Cebu, and I was surprised at how long the ticketing line still is there. It's a pain to wait to buy a ticket, of course, but it just made me more excited to watch Mallari.First and foremost, I love horror movies. Literally one of my favorite genres ever. I am also one of those horror fans who have little tolerance for jump scares; it would scare me at first, but it'd eventually irritate me especially when overdone. This film could have scrapped some of those, since the way most scenes are shot already got the atmosphere to give you the creeps. The abundance of jump scares comes off like the film's underestimating the audience's perception of fear, and that aspect would have made me give this 2.5/5 stars.But the story it's trying to tell surely won me over, hence the 3 stars. Though the social commentary in the film is weaker and there are lapses in the fiction part of the narrative, it succeeds to tell how love is the main predictor for the curse that plagues the Mallari bloodline. It also successfully tells how in some cases, history is truly repeated if ignored. I see why Piolo Pascual was also others' bet for Best Actor, his acting really made the 3 main characters shine in their own ways (and his role as Fr. Pedro Pelaez in Gomburza is noteworthy too by the way, Papa P FATHERED). Out of the 3 stories presented, my favorite definitely has to be Johnrey's. Too bad that for me, his storyline doesn't seem as fleshed out as Severino's or Jonathan's, as he is the ""tragic hero"" of the movie.In spite of the film's blatant flaws, it's still a movie that deserves all the hype and the awards they've received from the Gabi Ng Parangal. Do see it in cinemas before MMFF 2023 closes, it's nice to scream with other people in the cinema!",2024-01-01,1,0,watch,True
satuwina,8,"""Sometimes, love is a curse and there's nothing else in the world that can break it.""Got to watched this film in an almost jampacked cinema and all I can say that it is a good balance between suspense and horror. Well, for me, it brought me back to the old horror films filled with the typical jumpscares thag you'll still get surprised but it also gives you this suspense feeling like sitting at the edge of your chair wondering what could be the next thing that will happen in the movie.The transitions between the three eras were smooth that it was a little bit confusing at first glance but I loved how it incorporates the three timelines on a single important event of the whole story and presents you each on how they are intersected at that moment. It was definitely good on how they are able to play around the plot and not spill the whole thing on one go. I loved that portion and Piolo Pascual's acting is the best I've seen and maybe this is his best movie on his entire career. From the visual, to the acting, to the pronounciations that make the timelines distinct on their own helps very well on distinguishing the three different timelines of Severino, Johnrey and Jonathan. I would also love to add some praise for JC Santos. Being a theatre kid gains you so much and we've seen it through his performance.Just two things I did not love as much.1) The Manananggal Scene (did not resonated as much or did not do anything for the plot, I guess? And a little too corny for the well produced film)2) The Ending (I am looking for more information on how things end up like that. Like from JC's character to Janella's ""memory"" of who she is now after what Piolo did)But despite these things, I found Mallari to be a good film and despite not being a fan of horror films, this is one of those horror films at the top my list (as it was a good horro movie and because I can still sleep st night after watching this)",2023-12-29,1,0,watch,False

The conclusion was also weak.Looking for the three video reels for a couple of days in a small house to solve a mystery was ridiculously stupid. The screenplay was not very good most especially in the wedding proposal scene; and the delivery of lines were bad. There was barely modulation in line delivery. It contains many cheap and ineffective jumpscares although two of them were remarkable (i.e, hospital scene in the beginning and ghost hunting with the children).

terriblejasf,7,"I didn't expect much from this movie as I'd been hearing a LOT of negative reviews. I went in blind, and I happened to enjoy it!It was a horror movie that made sense (if you're open to peculiar storylines, of course). The first half was confusing and wonky, but the latter half at least made up for it by tying up the initially disconnected events together in a way that stimulated the audience's minds. Plot twists were revealed in this way when I didn't think there was anything more to expect. The movie was intentionally NOT subtle about the true culprit's identity because there were MORE IMPORTANT twists. Some bits of dialogue, especially in the romantic scenes, were cringe-inducing and unnatural. Even Janella's and Piolo's decent acting couldn't make it bearable. The insertion of key story elements (e.g., time traveling) could have been better with a less cheesy dialogue. Speaking of acting, JC Santos DESERVES the Best Supporting Actor Award. Piolo's acting was the weakest despite portraying the MAIN character; he was outshined by the supporting actors. There were multiple layers to the story that influenced the characters' complexity. Wikipedia would tell us that Fr. Juan Severino Mallari killed 57 people as a ""cure"" for his mother's sickness, which he deemed cursed. But the movie went all out: There was MORE to show within 2 hours. I loved the ending. Life's true horror did not come from stories about ghosts but from a person's adamance in committing mistakes that would negatively impact the people around them.",2024-01-02,1,0,watch,False

anaiela,7,"+:- plot-wise, it's def a richer, more nuanced, and more thought-out narrative compared to most PH horror na super predictable na ng plot twists + generic elements. i like what it tried to do with 3 diff time periods though ofc the time traveling/astral projecting was a stretch and maybe a tad too ambitious writing-wise. still a good effort tho- characters: all played well. i liked the juxtaposition between severino - a serial killer who didn't enjoy it and didn't actually WANT to be it - and lucas who DID enjoy being a copycat killer and WANTED to do it. jc santos deserved his best supporting actor award. - technical elements: production design goes so hard esp knowing they built some of the key parts of the setting. the score was also particularly good tho maybe im just biased for church/choral elements-:- im not a big fan of origin stories of ""female monsters"" when the presented origin is so male-centric. sure, in this case it was women who set upon the curse that started the monster - but why? just for someone else to do their bidding? i wish they showed more of the alarcons and why they did what they did. if the motivation is supposed to be wrath at the injustice done against ppl like them, then i wish they leaned into that more, kulang lang ng detail pa for that- mallari stopped being scary the moment it was revealed that his mom saw smth nieves led her to watch. dun palang i already knew severino would only be forced to kill, not that he wanted to himself. im not a fan of this either lol he'd be a much more sinister character if HE was the fanatic and saw himself as san bartolome on his own accord BUT i know that's not the point of the story so sige na nga- why naman di na lang niya niligtas si agnes eh doktor din naman si jonathan ... tapos pampanga yan in present time beh dami dami nang ospital tas may kotse rin naman si agnes mabilis kayo makakarating dun medyo nkklk- AND SPEAKING OF THE HOSPITAL: in the first scene na pinakitang nasa hospital bed si agnes, ang sabi ng nurse ""end stage na po siya"" so akala ko naman cancer or some life-threatening disease. ngayon pala stab wound amp pano yon end stage nakapagsalita pa nga and all ewan ko ba- and the ending ... i get it they needed a shot of jonathan like that, but i wish it was even more tragic. filipino writing is sometimes so hooked on expositional writing but sometimes that gets too annoying to listen to and to act out. i wish they didn't show agnes eating the chick. ok na sana that they showed jonathan smiling while holding up johnrey's head and the chick is coming out of its mouth - and then cut na agad to the mallari house and the secret room, where agnes is chained and jonathan is ""lovingly"" feeding her entrails while she looks like she'd rather be dead after killing him IDK. personally didnt feel like all that dialogue was necessary in the end but ok gets pa rin namanoverall tho, i hope this film encourages more horror filmmakers to take on compelling stories! our culture is SOOO rich for this literally andaming pwedeng material for horror and im so glad to see i can look forward to more daring horror films like this now in the PH",2024-01-02,0,0,watch,False

Piolo was great the only thing I wasn't convinced by is his demon character in the church scene... But all other 3 Mallari was great. Maybe even his Fr. Severino was the best. I don't think the jumpscares were unnecessary. Us pinoys would eat the up anyway... But its use of time travel or astral projection as the film says is kinda weak I think, I wished it was more utilized to move the narrative better but a 2 hr cut wouldn't really suffice so I guess it's good as it is. + it really tries to fit in a lot of genres so I think that's a plus for me on that part.",2024-01-02,0,0,watch,False

atablefortwo,7,"Mallari is a horror-thriller film based on the Philippines' first recorded serial killer hailing from Pampanga. With this in mind, the film attempts to take us on a wild ride of discovery, boldly mixing genres that, while commendable, more often than not gets derailed into different directions. MAZES AND DAZESFirstly, it's admirable how the story attempts to give Filipino audiences something different. It marries the familiar Philippine folklore horror elements with sci-fi and mystery thriller with dashes of history, comedy, and even family drama. The story unfolds with a non-linear structure, too, which makes it interesting.The issues lay with this very idea that it wanted to do so much with so little time. The first half of the film lays all of the mystery, while the second half picks up the pace and fully turns into a horror story.Jamming too many elements somehow took away from what could have been great points in the story if only they leaned more into them and chose: did it want to be more of a historical horror or a mystery thriller slasher cult modern classic?BRIGHT AND DULL SPOTSPiolo Pascual playing multiple roles across generations would've been a great feat for an actor of his caliber. But somehow, something was missing in his portrayal that left me wanting more. His characters felt like they were the same people, save for two distinct moments in the chapel and in the hospital towards the end.Undeniable standouts were JC Santos and Gloria Diaz. They were spectacular and generous in their supporting roles and stole scenes whenever they came up beside Pascual. They were delightful to watch. OVERALLDespite its major flaws, I like how everything was wrapped up. All of the mysteries and questions set up were resolved and given their end, no loose ends (which could've easily been the case given its ambition and scope).Mallari is an example of what happens when you allow filmmakers to be adventurous and bold in their ideas. It can lead to a bumpy and crazy, yet fun and adventurous ride.",2023-12-31,1,0,watch,False

freshlinen,6,"watching this in the cinemas was definitely a fun experience especially when the audience (mostly strangers) also insert funny commentaries here and there that you can’t help but laugh at. the people behind our backs were especially funny i couldn’t help but to acknowledge how that elevated my experience. as for the movie itself…. first, i would like to point out how much i loooooove the musical scoring. i have no complaints about that. i also liked the acting especially jc santos like woah okay best supporting actor indeed! and also liked the fact that janella salvador is here like woah everyone’s eye candy is piolo pascual but mine is janella so there’s room for everybody! that said, what i didn’t like about the movie is how they didn’t explore much about the first filipino serial killer aspect more. i went in expecting that they would explore the story of the murders itself, the aftermath, the consequences, and how the priest was discovered as the murderer but i guess that’s on me for expecting something like that, something nbc hannibal-like? honestly, i just really wished they focused more on the murders since it is a mystery/thriller aspect in itself but i guess mallari wasn’t going for that. like hello, the first documented serial killer of the philippines was a catholic priest and that in itself is intriguing as a predominantly catholic country. anyway, i did like the time traveling aspect to explore the narrative but at the same time i feel like it wasn’t utilized well enough to really wrap up the story… but props to piolo pascual for pulling off the roles well.",2024-01-02,1,0,watch,True

And the ending was a piece of cake. It was delicious and satisfying. There was a part where a tape recording of Johnrey's wife was giving her own confession, it was full of shit but I'll let it slide.

ally_alano,4,"this had a good concept but bad executionthe way this movie would have worked if they stuck with the historical fiction serial killer aspect rather than leaning towards a more supernatural horror angleI was interested in this film because I wanted to know about the first known serial killer in the philippines, but what I got was a fantastical supernatural version of it that, which led me disappointed. the jumpscares were unnecessary and did nothing for the plot but to scare the audiencethe movie also felt too long. they could have cut down a lot scenes, the pacing could have been better, and they could have revised the script more. it also thinks that that the viewers are dumb by over explaining some of the key plot points and reiterating information that was already shown beforehand. (more show, less talk guys)however, I do want to note the best thing about this movie is its scoring, its really no wonder why it won best musical score because the music just gets you and pulls you into the creepy supernatural atmosphere that they wouldn’t have fully accomplished without its great scoringoverall, it had potential and I thought this had a different approach to the material, but ultimately left disappointed",2024-01-02,1,0,watch,False

Their cinematography was simple; numerous shots were repeated frequently. I’m not a big fan of their visual effects. But i liked the color. The performance of Piolo Pascual should have been better.

aarondavem,7,"Horror, I guess, is truly the most challenging film genre, and you feel it in the struggles of PH cinema. Often, in our horror films, the story is either unclear or unintentionally turns into comedy due to poor visual effects. In this film, I don't quite get why the fear factor feels forced. There are numerous jumpscares that seem repetitive and not very surprising.Perhaps the film could still deliver (or even be better) if the horror vibes weren't forced (especially the manananggal scene, it might have been better off excluded). But it's still a 4-star rating from me because I did enjoy watching it. It gives off similar vibes to Seklusyon since both are horror and revolve around religion, making it inevitable to compare the two.There are few local horror films with a good screenplay, and this is one of those succeeding in that aspect. The disturbing ending was exactly what I wanted to spark discussions and curiosity about the life of Father Severino Mallari. Kudos to the filmmakers for the smooth transitions between scenes, and you genuinely feel the thrill.The score was superb (the bayle scene was chef's kiss), but there were times when the sound effects are annoying because it's too loud and hurts the ears. The editing still needs more improvement. The visual effects are far from perfect, but they're already good and a significant improvement compared to other local films, especially in the horror genre. What truly stood out here is the phenomenal acting of Piolo Pascual, with three characters portrayed, and JC Santos, who is truly deserving of his Best Supporting Actor award (they nailed it in their last scene together). I believe Piolo Pascual is the Brad Pitt of the Philippines because he never seems to age.There are many loopholes and points for improvement, but the film's concept is indeed impressive, and in some ways, it probably delivered the intended message to viewers. I'm happy because I see this as a launching pad for the progress of local horror films, and the trajectory is only heading upwards.",2024-01-03,1,0,watch,False

xpert_ninja,6,"Rather than tell a straightforward slasher/police procedural story like in most serial killer-centric films, Mallari opts for a unique approach: focusing on a historic Filipino figure. Oh and time travel as plot device. The film certainly has great ingredients. The combined acting prowess of Piolo Pascual, JC Santos, and Ms. Gloria Diaz. The Enrico Santos-penned screenplay that combines Gothic atmospheres, Catholic traditions, (almost) Lovecraftian ancient evils, love and madness, and the dance between Christianity and violence. The visuals refreshingly don't look made for TV which, in my perspective, dominates Filipino visual media today. Y'know the overly lit backgrounds. Or sickening coloring. Sadly though, Mallari is overdone but not in the fun, unique way. It falls into the usual trappings of conventional big-budget films these days (it is a Warner Brothers affair). The jumpscares that define much of this film's genre are too one-note. A character enters a room and then there's a figure, either behind or in front, which slowly turns around, revealing black eyes, decaying skin, and mouth wide open. Dramatic score in the background to accentuate the fear. Watching it alone in a dark room can make those scenes scary, sure. But would it kill the filmmakers to create sequences that haunt, not merely surprise? Suspenseful equences that paralyze you for a minute, instead of five seconds of jumpscare? The score too, good Lord, would it kill to have silence? Let the dread creep in. Build on the minutes-long discomfort.

This is what horror movies should look like. 3) Piolo Pascual's Performance is really commendable! He was able to differentiate between each character he was portraying. 4) Setting / Production is great. Timelines were differentiated and can be easily identified. Areas to Improve:- Played too safe with the gore, hence it was something we don't really mind. The horror elements are enough. - 2 murders in the modern day could not justify the ""serial killings"", would be great if there were at least one or two more. - I, personally, did not like Janella's fate.

I did not expect to come out of the cinema witnessing a movie which is basically an amalgamation of multiple genres.Mallari's strengths were its phenomenal acting from a star-studded cast, its great cinematography, and its pacing is okay.Mallari's weaknesses were its all over-the- place writing and personally, I think, the movie could've done better and not spoonfeed everything to the viewers and let them think for themselves. Also, it had tons of ineffective jumpscares that do not contribute anything to the plot and for some scenes, the scoring was kind of jarring and felt in-your-face.Overall, I enjoyed watching Mallari even though it's somewhat predictable. Also, we all could've saved two hours of our lives if only someone handed Jonathan a balut in the first place. Metro Manila Film Festival 2023 @ SM Megamall",2024-01-06,1,0,watch,False

Isang tanyag na kura paroko na nagngangalang Juan Severino Mallari ang pinaghihinalaang pumatay sa humigit kumulang 57 katao.Sa pelikulang ito ni Direk Derick Cabrido, hindi lamang niya tinutukan ang buhay ni Father Severino bilang kauna-unahang serial killer sa Pilipinas, ito rin ay nagbibigay ng makabuluhang mensahe tungkol sa pag-ibig, bagamat isang nakakakilabot na representasyon ng pag-ibig, habang nilalakbay ang mga masalimuot na landas ng pagmamahal, kahit pa ito ay may kaakbay na panganib. Talagang hindi matatawaran ang pagganap ng isa sa pinakakilalang aktor sa bansa na si Piolo Pascual. Ibang ""Papa P"" ang makikita sa pelikulang ito. Iba't ibang pagkatao, iba't ibang emosyon, at iba't ibang kwento. Hindi madali ang gumanap ng tatlong persona kaya kahanga-hanga ang ipinamalas ng aktor. Isa sa gusto kong karakter na ginampanan niya ay si Father Severino Mallari. Nabigyan nya ng hustisya ang karakter na ito, makikita mo sa mga mata niya kung anong emosyon ang nais niyang ipahatid sa mga manonood. Takot, galit, at pagmamahal, walang duda, nakilala siya dahil sa kanyang angking galing. Gaya ni Piolo, ipinamalas rin ni JC Santos ang kanyang galing sa pag-arte na gumanap bilang Lucas. Isa siya sa pinakanagdala ng pelikula, kaya naman hindi nakakapagtaka na sya ang napiling bigyan ng parangal ng MMFF bilang Best Supporting Actor ngayong taon.Kakaiba ang atake na bitbit ng “Mallari” dahil hindi lamang nakasentro sa horror ang pelikula ngunit sumasaklaw din ito sa iba't ibang genre tulad ng thriller, sci-fi, folklore, kasaysayan, romance, at family drama. Nakakamangha na napagsama-sama ito sa iisang pelikula. Mahusay nitong inilarawan ang kontradiksyon ng pag-ibig bilang isang biyaya at sumpa. Katulad ng sinabi sa pelikula “Ang isang tao ay kabuuan ng kaniyang mga desisyon, minamahal, at mga pagkakamali,"" gaano nga ba kalalim ang kaya nating isugal para sa pag-ibig?",2024-01-06,2,0,watch,False

There are justifiable parts, then there are “what the hell is going on” ones.Regardless of the mishaps, such as the lack of cinematic fluidity and overpowering score, Mallari is an entertaining experience - thanks to Piolo Pascual’s constant reinvention as an actor.

cinegeekspod,6,"The Philippine Horror Movie scene has had a very interesting existence, to say the least. Our culture is ripe with legends and fables about supernatural beings committing atrocities, and many variations of these tales have made their way to the silver screen - whether that be a refrigerator eating an unwelcome houseguest, or centuries-old entities luring influencers to a “collab” to harvest their fresh flesh and blood. Sometimes, we get tales of a feminine spectre haunting a commonly-used thoroughfare in Quezon City, and sometimes we’ll get a tale about the horrors that have befallen families simply because they’ve set wedding dates so close to each other. One horror trope, which has not been explored much in Filipino cinema, is that of the serial killer slasher film. One film dares to go deeper into that sub-genre, an attempt that has elicited much anticipation and hype.

matchartsy,10,"The concept of time travel in storytelling is a nice approach. It was well presented how the 3 different generations of Mallari were portrayed, but it also showcased that—even now and then, there’s a curse that has been happening in our country (in the context of societal injustices). “Ang isang tao ay kabuuan ng kanyang mga desisyon… minamahal… at mga pagkakamali.”The Love lies at the core of all three varieties of Mallari. Two are driven by love for their spouses, and one is out of love for the mother. However, Jonathan and Juan Severino both have the trait of sacrificing others in order to save their loved ones. Johnray, however, gives his life to save everyone, even his loved ones. It all leads me to the question: to what extents are we willing to go for the sake of love?For the production, when it comes to horror, it’s either you go big or go home. This means that to be able to justify the concept of a horror film, you will need to exert a lot of effort in executing it, from cinematography, lights, sound design, production design, and wardrobe & prosthetics. I applaud the sound design that carried the whole jump scare, the lights that signified each scenery, the PD, wardrobe, & hmu, who emphasized the time frame, symbolism, and their story as a character.Though there are some unnecessary parts and certain areas that could use of improvement, but overall, I applaud how well they have shown the history, culture, and Filipino myths in this film. The messages they unfold about societal issues, needs to be recognized more; hence, they tackle serious issues such as the injustice killing which represents the EJK, and how the lgbtq community is still considered as part of the “salot ng lipunan”, and many more, that are still happening today.",2024-01-07,1,0,watch,True

alocasean,6,"Making the Philippine’s first recorded serial killer a side character rather than the main lead was a miss. There’s so much lore and history around the character just for it to be overshadowed by present time’s Mallari and his spiral. If the movie was solely about the priest, it would’ve been a fucking hit, but I admire the unique take on astral projection and time traveling.While I applaud Piolo Pascual’s talent in portraying three different characters, I can’t help but think if there would’ve been a better way to introduce these characters and their stories. The constant flashbacks and sudden time jumps were bordering on overkill, I personally would’ve enjoyed if the movie was sectioned into three parts instead to have a consistent story line because trying to decipher each time period’s plot made the movie feel longer than it actually was. Reading the wikipedia plot was more entertaining.Also, what the hell is this movie’s lightning problem? A majority of the jump scares are either the killer or ghosts in the background but I wouldn’t know because I couldn’t see shit. Speaking of jump scares, Philippine cinema needs to find new ways of scaring its viewers rather than the typical ~scary image~ with loud music. I admit, some of it worked, but the tension in teasing a potential jump scare is more memorable than a lousy 5 second scare imo. Or maybe I’m just used to the American horror movie industry and the likes of Blumhouse or A24.To cut it sweet, the parts I liked: the hospital scene at the end being shown in the beginning, each Mallari’s origins in how all three ended up being in one room at the same time shown throughout the movie, Janella Salvador, the manananggal reveal, generational Alarcon vs Mallari, Piolo Pascual’s acting, and the overall filmography of it all.Would I watch it again? Mhm, probably not. Did I still enjoy seeing Piolo Pascaul and Janella Salvador on the big screen? Hell fucking yes.",2024-01-08,0,0,watch,True

Para lang siyang in-add out of nowhere sa script to make it “scarier” since plain nga lang talaga ang flow pag Serial Killers ang story. They added that “oomph” badly pero gets naman na pinoy medyo need ng OA sa life char. When you rewind the clips siguro di talaga nakakatakot yung faces, nakakagulat lang pero “eh” ang makeup, for me, + may OA din na SFX during jumpscares na di ko nabet-an. It’s too much.Acting: hands down to Piolo Pascual for portraying 3 DIFFERENT CHARACTERS flawlessly!!! Ang galing at walang bahid/mix ng other characters na Mallari. Siguro given na din na they’re from different timelines pero kitang kita mo yung difference ng character and harmony nila together as “Mallaris”. Special mention to JC Santos!! Napakaganda ng execution niya with his character! + the women in the film Janella and Elisse very strong characters indeed!Cinematography: Seamless and Experimental Since the story has 3 different timelines, it jumps from one timeline to another and super clean ng transitions. Experimental in a way na they’ve incorporated transitions to jump from one dialogue to another and from one Mallari to the next Mallari in another timeline!For the color grading, *chef’s kiss* it speaks for itself and bawat history ng family nila seamless ang colors. All in all, ganda ng execution!Camera Work: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 super love it di ko na explain watch niyo nalang very visible yung ganda ng camera work nila!!Production Design: THE BEST. Bawat details sa set ng timelines kuhang kuha!! It feels so alive na parang nangyari talaga siya in real life.Slasher Factor: At the end of the day, it’s a story about a Serial Killer, medyo nakulangan lang ako sa Serial Killer factor niya. With the slashing scenes, nabitin ako! Kulang sa patayan! Medyo heavily kasi nag focus yung story sa Filipino Theme na may added witchcraft, superstitions, folklore. Which is gets ko kasi it’s a Filipino Serial Killer it’s bound to be incorporated with Filipino themes. With the added themes, it’s too chaotic, in somewhat a good way? Hahaha. Though sana dinagdagan pa nila yung slashing and killings kasi bitin! For the gore, pwede na ilaban. ✨Additional✨Since this is Fiction, some scenes are familiar sa other Horror/Thriller Films that I’ve watched kaya parang magegets mo na din yung scene or mahahalata mo na influenced siya with a certain film.Films like Mallari: Sinister, Insidious, Lights Out Sucker for history and true crime!!",2023-12-26,0,0,watch,True

paulenicola,6,"MALLARI, MMFF2023: Based on Filipino Catholic priest Juan Severino Mallari (1785–1840), the first documented serial killer from the Philippines; Director Roderick Cabrido and writer Enrico Santos deliver a story that takes the premise of Mallari's serial killing and uses it as backstory to advance the horror elements of the film's three-timeline, three-Piolo Pascual act. Personally, I might be in the minority who thinks that, with reports of Mallari showing signs of mental instability around the same time of his killing spree, the film would have worked better as a psychological thriller, sans the folk horror aspect. The filmmakers seemingly took advantage of the paucity of verifiable records about the man's life — so much that the liberties they took just screams 'WOW'. Mallari, in its sheer unapologetic glory, is a very interesting mess. As an alchemy of historical thriller and folk horror, at times it becomes too tiring, that audiences can be forgiven for expecting scares before they even appear onscreen. This marriage ultimately combusts in the end, leaving only one of the two as the last genre standing.And for that, flaws and all, I feel Mallari deserves a closer look for its guts to prioritize jump scares to frighten its audiences shitless; even if by doing so, it compromises history — and the last ounces of accuracy remaining — by putting it on the back burner.",2024-01-09,0,0,watch,False
rhytious,8,Horror film na may kuwento at hindi jump-scares lang ang puhunan.Bago ang konsepto ng pelikula. Inspired ito sa totoong kuwento ni Juan Severino Mallari na hinaluan ng fiction. Simula pa lang ay may mga panggulat na. Mangangapa ka nga lang at malilito sa dami ng nangyayari. Pabalik-balik kasi sa timeline ng tatlong Mallari. Duda na nga ako nong kalagitnaan kung kaya ba nilang pagtagpi-tagpiin ang lahat ng bahagi ng walang sabit o plot hole.Sigawan ang mga tao sa sinehan lalo sa habulang eksena sa dulo. Kaya masasabi ko talagang effective sa pananakot ang pelikula. Marami ring plot twist na dapat abangan. May mangilan-ngilang plot holes nga lang at ilang rebelasyon na predictable pero hindi naman no’n maikakaila ang ganda ng pelikula.Sa huli’y natahi naman ng maayos ang bawat piraso. Gusto-gusto ko ang ending. Hindi ko ito inaasahan. Nakakagulat! Lalo akong humanga sa galing JC dito. Deserve na deserve ang best supporting actor. Nakakakilabot naman si Gloria Diaz!

Pero hindi naging sarado para hindi maging sariwa ang pagkilala ko sa pelikula.Mabilis na ipinakilala ang karakter. Hindi sila nagpahaba ng paghihintay bago mo malaman kung tungkol saan ang pelikula. Ngunit sa simula pa lang, alam mo na yung inihahanda nilang ibunyag sa dulo ng pelikula.May mga panahon napabilib ako sa paraan ng editing at pagkuha ng eksena pero hindi ito naging sapat para mailatag ng malinaw ang istorya.May iilang eksena na hindi nakatulong sa pagkukwento bagkus nag-iwan lamang ng mga katanungan hindi na nabigyan ng kasagutan.Maayos ang ipinakita ni Piolo pero hindi ako tiyak kung ito ay kayang magpanalo sa kanya ng parangal. Pero gusto ko at nararapat siyang bigyan ng pagkilala sa maraming karakter na ginampanan niya. Kung pagbabasehan ang akting na ipinakita, SI JC Santos ang magbubuhat ng bandera sa gabi ng parangal. Mahusay at nararapat ang ipinakita niya.Medyo naguluhan lang ako sa mga manunulat kung anong kwento ba ang gusto nila para sa mga manunuod.

imjustdrey,6,"(Note: This review contains spoilers.)This is certainly one of the most bizarre films I’ve ever seen.I entered the theater expecting a retelling of Juan Severino Mallari’s story in the form of a slasher film, but ended up witnessing something completely different. My expectations were completely subverted.The film took so much creative license and put some fantasy and supernatural twists on Juan Severino Mallari’s story, which is really inventive. But while I do appreciate this creative effort, I was not quite satisfied with its outcome. As much as I want to give lots of praises to the film, I believe it has some flaws, which, unfortunately, brought down its quality.Frankly, the film was too ambitious. It tried too hard to present a complex and mind-boggling concept but ended up executing it poorly. Hence, when I left the theater, I felt that something was missing. The film didn’t turn out to be as impressive and groundbreaking as I expected it to be.Perhaps, they should have just focused on the time travel aspect, because that was done brilliantly. Fusing it with Juan Severino Mallari’s story and excessive supernatural elements ruined what could have been an amazing time-travel historical film. The foundation was already there! It would’ve created something truly impressive and groundbreaking, until… the poor execution of the story’s very ambitious plot.Also, the dialogues were clunky. Many of the conversations between characters who are supposedly close to one another felt forced and awkward. An example is when Jonathan suddenly shouted at Lucas after the latter butted in on his conversation with Agnes. His shouting came out of nowhere, and it felt so forced. Sure, he was angry at Lucas, but I didn’t feel its emotional weight due to how forced it was. (I’m aware of the reason for Jonathan’s anger, it’s the clunky dialogue that’s the problem.) There are more instances like this throughout the film, and it really bothered me. The timing of the dialogues, as well as the choice of words, were really off.But despite my gripes with the film, I’m gonna give it three stars because it has some redeeming qualities. Among these are Piolo Pascual and JC Santos’ impeccable performances.I was absolutely impressed with how Piolo was able to portray three different characters while putting certain nuances to each of them. The three characters are really different from one another, and you could tell that based on their individual demeanors, personalities, and body languages, which Piolo fantastically depicted. I really hope he wins an award for this, because not many actors could pull this off.And JC Santos… man, he really deserves his Best Supporting Actor award!! Even though I was able to predict it easily, I had goosebumps when his character, Lucas, turned out to be the killer in the present day. JC pulled off the Jekyll and Hyde persona so well. He should do this type of role more often!Furthermore, the film did well when it comes to building suspense. Although it is not as scary as typical horror films, the jump scares were still frightening. Additionally, the score and sound effects were spectacular — they fitted every scene perfectly and greatly intensified the eerie atmosphere of the film. And the pacing was surprisingly good! In contrast to most long films, I wasn’t bothered with the runtime of this one. Most scenes were paced appropriately.Overall, disregarding my criticisms, I enjoyed watching this film. It had a lot of wasted potential, but it still gave me a nice cinematic experience.",2024-01-07,1,0,watch,True

aesyeo,4,"Sorry to say this, but this is just a 130-minute-long glowed-up version of a Gabi ng Lagim episode. Staying awake was a struggle.Its astounding cinematography cannot salvage this film from the utter ludicrousness of the story. Its premise was interesting. After all, it was supposed to depict the Philippines' first serial killer, Fr. Juan Severino Mallari, a talented calligrapher-turned-murderer priest in Pampanga.Yet, it tried to outsmart its audience by hyping up a confused intergenerational Mallari curse. What came out was a mess littered with pathetically otiose jumpscares, lazy narrations, historical inaccuracies, overstretched fictionalization, and the implausibility of astral projection and time travel. To make matters worse, there were hints of transphobia, racism, and glorification of extrajudicial killings flying all over this film.JC Santos and his deranged act as a killer stood out in this film. And don't fret; that ""twist"" was given away in the first 15 minutes. Gloria Diaz was great. Piolo Pascual succeeded in crafting three different personas.

Also, it would have been more fun if the body count was a little bit higher, I guess. To add to the things that were left a lot to be desired, the ending fell flat for me, when the main character in the 2023 timeline ended up doing the exact things he was trying to prevent.

While the scenes where he shines are the scenes with intense emotions like struggling to come to terms with his character’s supposed destiny.

stupidfanboy,6,"Mallari is a good thriller film if you are craving some thrills. It gives adequate tension for most scenes, with entertaining plot twists for everyone watching.However, it suffered from bad writing and dumb choices. There was an attempt for a relatability in Father Mac's character, but it was too much it feels shoved into the film. Wonder if they paid license from Sueisha and Pierrot for that character that is just used for comedic relief. The marketing of the film is waaay waay off the actual film plot. It tried to incorporate a lot of elements: family, isekai, love, occult, Philippine folklore, and common horror tropes but executed quite badly. It was a clickbait/watchbait to say it is a film about Severino Mallari, but more of a fictionalized character of him (adding the Disclaimer about using St. Bartholomew as a plot device didn't help at all). The music is too much to aid with horror; it helped me anticipate the jumpscares.There is also a missed opportunity in painting the moon red for trying to tie it into blood moon as well, you know, when blood is involved here.But Piolo and JC Santos carried the film. They both provided some wide range of character. They somehow saved the film. I can also see Piolo in Melvil Poupaud. He somehow styles like him and has aged well.In short, Mallari is like me, quite confusing to discern its main purpose because it went off-tangents and digressions.",2024-01-13,0,0,watch,False

Too many cheap jump scares and the sound design ruined some of the moments. Some of the cgi was horrible too and I wish they used practical effects instead. Speaking of effects, the gore in this movie was weird. It's like they're not afraid to be graphic but they're also not showing how graphic the kills are? Then there's the plot. Lots of misplaced exposition and unanswered questions. Unanswered questions are a good thing but the questions we really needed answers to were never answered. Despite all of these, Mallari had a lot of things going for it. Piolo was great, JC was great, I bet Janella would've been great too if she was given more screen time. I respect their decision to add a more complicated twist to the material at hand, but this would've been better if it was a period piece and focused more on what happened back in 1812. Overall, a good watch but could've been better. What I like best about this movie is the fact that studios are giving stories like these a chance to get the big screen treatment.

lerryjohnofcl,7,"One of the most anticipated films of this year's MMFF is about the curious case of Father Severino Mallari, a real-life Filipino priest who is also the country's first-ever documented serial killer. What makes people even more excited is that this is lead actor #PioloPascual 's first horror film to date, after being tried and tested in romance/drama/comedy genres. This is among the final batch of films announced to be a part of the festival shortlist, which now has 2 entries more than its usual 8. In this film, Pascual plays three distinct characters in different time periods: Doctor Jonathan (present time), war documentarian Johnrey (1940s) and the serial killer Fr. Severino (1800s). Individually, these key characters all face the fears of their respective eras, while their paths converge in one hidden room of the Mallari mansion. It is delightful to watch Pascual step up his game in portraying the triple characters with distinct personalities, perhaps one of the most memorable performances in this festival. However, #JCSantos brings out the real surprise of this film and there's genuine terror in his character's ultimate reveal! If only the CGI effects were polished and convincing enough, then its horrific atmosphere may have been consistent. The film sure took a risk in mixing a lot of elements that could be too much to absorb in one sitting. Honestly, I would've wanted it to focus more on the killer priest and explore his psyche on a deeper level - his internal battles and the impact of his killings. The concept of an astral time travel could be saved on another film, the blood relation of the three leads may already be used to explain their connection. They could've used the time building up the crime-horror-folklore angles rather than explain all the sci-fi.Still, Mallari is a good attempt at elevating our taste in cinema. May this inspire more filmmakers to experiment in the horror genre.3.5 OUT OF 5⭐⭐⭐½📃STORY - 0.7🎥EXECUTION - 0.6👥CHARACTERIZATION - 0.8🍿ENTERTAINMENT VALUE - 0.7✨LASTING IMPACT - 0.7",2023-12-30,0,0,watch,False

snowstage,6,"“𝙄𝙨𝙣’𝙩 𝙡𝙤𝙫𝙚 𝙖𝙡𝙨𝙤 𝙖 𝙘𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚?”How far will you go for love? I believe this is the theme of the movie.Father Mallari is a real figure in Philippines history, the first documented serial killer in the country. The movie tells his story from the angle of love and madness. After some researches, I found that the real Father Mallari might have acted with love or he had mental issues.This movie is a fiction based on the real story of Father Mallari; it has a very mysterious background and I like the darkness it presented and how the story didn’t end with political correctness; however, the ending couldn’t have ended earlier.Nevertheless, there are too many jump scares (with unnecessarily too strong sound effect), which didn’t help pushing the plot forward and made it draggy.The acting range (and muscles) of Piolo are amazing; his has 4-style in the movie, if you watch close enough, there is a small detail for the style of Johnathan. Since Piolo has a mole near his left ear, to further differentiate the style of Johnrey and Johnathan, his mole was removed (likely by CG) when he plays Johnathan.JC Santos is really outstanding, he definitely stole the spotlight.The buildup of atmosphere is great, technical aspects are pretty impressive like visual effect, lighting and scores. However, editing seems to be another issue. For example, the scene where Father Mallari just returned home and almost encountered Johnrey and Johnathan, had repeated 3-time in the movie. Is it really necessary or audiences would be that absent-minded?I’m not sure whether relatively jumpy editing is the storytelling style of Director Cabrido, because his last movie 𝘞𝘪𝘴𝘩 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘞𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘖𝘯𝘦 also has this issue.",2024-01-18,2,0,watch,True

jomsc,10,"The storyline cleverly deceives you into believing that its plot is predictable, allowing you to anticipate scenes and revelations. However, the meticulous crafting of every detail ensures that, despite the apparent predictability, the execution remains so well-done that you'll still find yourself shocked and frightened. The film achieves this without unnecessarily complicating the narrative, maintaining its effectiveness in delivering surprises and scares.""Mallari"" masterfully employs a multi-sensory approach, seamlessly blending visuals and sound to provoke a powerful emotional response from the audience. The effectiveness of the musical scoring becomes evident as it skillfully crafts a suspenseful and frightening atmosphere, enhancing the impact of jump scares and intensifying the overall horror experience.The cast delivered compelling portrayals of their characters, infusing depth and authenticity that kept the audience engaged. Despite the anticipation of impending jump scares, their performances were so effective that even when expected, the audience found themselves screaming in response to the well-executed moments of shock.Contrary to the typical ending associated with this theme, where the protagonist usually finds redemption or breaks free from the negative thread, ""Mallari"" takes a different approach. The film allows the protagonist to embrace the path of becoming the villain, seemingly without learning from the events of the story, succumbing to darkness. This unexpected twist left a lasting impression, showcasing an innovative narrative where the conventional expectations are skillfully subverted, making the storytelling more impressive in its well-outlined and unconventional trajectory.Hats off to the Mallari Team for creating an outstanding film that truly deserves international recognition.

It had the perfect amount of jumpscares (which I liked a lot). But in my head, a good horror movie is more than just its jumpscares. It has to have a plot. And this movie had. I loved everything about this film regardless of the complaint of the internet on that one particular reveal/scene. To me, that scene added up everything and completely made sense. Undoubtedly, Piolo is already a really good actor and he delivered in this film. This is honestly the latest Filipino horror film that I genuinely enjoyed. Actually, the latest horror film (including films produced in Hollywood).

Severino who used to be very kind but ended up committing murders for his mother to live long. it's such a good watch, no dead scenes, also with jc santos, playing as Lucas, Jonathan's friend who was the killer in the present time!! i just hated that Jonathan killed him, but then ended up digging the grave of Johnrey to get the evil creature and pass it to his girlfriend, Agnes (played by janella salvador) making her a monster. he just put his uncle's sacrifice to waste!! what a stupid man... and not to mention, Agnes did not approve it, he only forced it to her. good thing, their relationship is not the same after, that's a good ending.",2024-01-06,0,0,watch,False

ayesak21,7,"A familiar yet refreshing take on Filipino horror.Mallari served as the frontrunner for last year’s MMFF months before the festival. Trailers were good and promotions were good as well, but what surprised me is the difference between the final film and these promotional materials. I was expecting Mallari to be Psychological Thriller or a slasher film but it was meddled with paranormal and time travel. You can already pinpoint who the killer is in the first 30 minutes of the film, which is a bummer. JC Santos gave a splendid performance but his character and the twist of the story could be done better. Magulo yung first act, it felt like marami silang gustong ilagay sa marrative. Lines were cringy and walang tao sa totoong buhay na ganon mag salita. The film also had unnecessary jumpscares na walang purpose sa story, very Filipino horror movie core.The second and the last act is where the story started to take ita shape and form. I was glued down to my seats with what I was watching. Magulo ang simula pero natahi nila nang maayos ang lahat ng elemento sa dulo which is what made me like this film despite its issues. Piolo Pascual showed how great he was in his craft. Sa pelikulang ito makikita mo kung bakit sought after si Piolo. Janella Salvador was also great in this movie, she can be the queen of filipino horror movies. Sound design and the set designs were my favorite, dito mo makikitang pinaghandaan at may malaking budget ang palabas na ito.Mallari has some of the elements of a bad and cringey horror movies but it also has refreshing takes on a newer form of horror and storytelling that uses a lore to expound on a subject matter.",2024-01-01,2,0,watch,True

gmcajayon,6,"Perhaps the most surprising aspect of Mallari is how the director Derick Cabrido managed to weave together a staggering amount of narrative threads and somehow still ended up with a cohesive story. Although the same thing cannot be said about its many thematic layers that often felt convoluted and reactionary, there is something to be admired (or at least respected) with how textually rich Cabrido aims his film to be.Albeit inferred only through the choice of time periods (1818/1948/2018), Mallari succeeds in tracing a historical and cultural perspective on the Duterte drug war–that of a messianic figure (Duterte/Fr. Mallari) assuming the role of both judge and executioner of perceived ""plagues"" of society (the sinful/addicts)–and clearly demonstrates why this is problematic and is ultimately an act of self-preservation. The film takes a firm stance against mass murder, especially when it is enacted by the elites, and in the current Filipino socio-political climate this sentiment is well-appreciated.However, Mallari's portrayal of folk religion/mythology vis-a-vis Christianity is rather questionable. On one hand the film explores its anti-colonial capacity, that its integration into a Western notion of Christianity did not necessarily result into assimilation; indeed, through sinister shots littered with religious figurines (rooted in pagan worship) and the psychological corruption of Fr. Mallari's morals, the film shows that folk traditions' effects and influences have stood the test of time and could even be argued as the primary feature through which Filipinos practice modern Christianity.On the other hand, however, Mallari is still unable to resist the hegemonic assumptions that these folk practices are inherently evil; they may be anti-colonial but they're just as bad, maybe even worse. They function mainly to bolster the film's hypothesis—that evil is the primary component of the world and that everything else exist only in relation to it.This argument is most explicitly shown through the construction of Casa Mallari as a liminal space, where different temporal (past, present, future) and existential (living and non-living) realities converge. This is also the reason why the scares, although seemingly imitating the effect of sudden shock, are deliberately designed to evoke diminishing affective returns; fear is not an anomaly in the film's diegesis but is rather the norm, further supporting the essentialist view of the world and humanity as evil.And although this position works within the confines of the horror genre in which Mallari operates, I remain not fully sold on such bleak and defeatist attitude. I'd rather believe that there exist other ""manlalakbays"" (time travelers) with the capacity to intervene and put an end to this cycle of violence.",2024-01-29,6,0,watch,False

As Severino, the murderous priest with a malicious intent to kill the bad seed in his community and free his mother from a curse, Piolo is very convincing as a serial killer. The transition scene in the church, where he was being convinced by the Patron Saint Bartholomew, was just a chef’s kiss.As Johnrey, Piolo transitions into a man willing to do everything to rid himself of the curse. And as Jonathan, who was willing to do everything to save a loved one, Piolo was so good that you might want to express frustration for all the stupidity and recklessness he portrayed.The ending scene, where Piolo is facing the audience as if telling them that he will be hunting them for the night, is just brilliant.

mahuika,8,"This was a really good film. It shows three perspectives of three different characters played by Piolo Pascual. The nice visual effects were really nice, and I was not expecting the quality to be THAT good. Byfar the BEST Filipino film I’ve seen.It boasts a captivating plot intricately linked to Philippine history and urban legend. The commendable acting skills of all characters significantly contribute to the film’s appeal. The pacing strikes a perfect balance—neither too fast nor too slow, preventing viewers from experiencing boredom, or confusion.Regrettably, the downside lies in the inclusion of unnecessary jump scares, creating an abrupt disruption in the flow of the film. This drawback proves to be a significant dent in the overall quality of an otherwise promising story.Despite this setback, it’s important to note that “Mallari” still stands as a commendable horror film, especially when compared to the usual offerings in the Philippine horror genre. Its compelling plot, historical ties, and the commendable performances of the cast elevate it above many counterparts, making it a worthwhile watch for enthusiasts of the genre.",2024-04-07,0,0,watch,False

dmfetalvero,4,"I went into ""Mallari"" with a mixture of excitement and skepticism because of how well-received it was by Filipino viewers on social media. Regretfully, the film's execution left me feeling disappointed, and my expectations were not fulfilled. To bring the story to its best, the screenplay in particular needs to be significantly revised.On the one hand, the film's artistic vision is praiseworthy. It is creative and promising that the authors chose to examine several incarnations of the Mallari family in diverse eras. But the execution is inadequate. It's challenging to fully immerse yourself in the characters and their struggles because of the story's rambling dialogue and pacing.Despite being a crucial part of the movie, the big reveal feels hurried and doesn't have the emotional impact it needs. The final choice made by the protagonist, which is supposed to be a pivotal moment in the narrative, is disappointing and has no lasting effect. Additionally, there is no tension or surprise because the criminal killer's identity is revealed right away. Furthermore, the movie's depiction of Mallari's deeds and killings is a little sanitized, which lessens the story's overall impact. The final product does not justify the audience's reaction to the story, nor does it fully realize its complexity. It was a failure all around. Although it had promise, the narrative required a lot of work and changes. The morality of Fr. could have been the subject of the film. Mallari and how his actions' effects were still troublesome. The topic of murder and why it shouldn't be accepted or exalted could have been covered.Sayang!Props to JC Santos tho!",2024-06-21,13,2,watch,False

poet1c_,3,"Hindi ko mawari kung saan o paano ako magsisimula. I read an article about the real Father Mallari and why, just why, was his story portrayed in this way? I am not going to talk into detail na about the structure or the scenes of the film basta 'yung feelings ko rollercoaster. Puntahan natin yung mahalaga. The film was supposed to be historic and cultural. No matter what kind of creative tweaks ang niluto nila, hindi ba't pangalan ni Juan Severino Mallari ang ginagamit natin dito? Where was his story? Sa pagkakaunawa ko, tila napunta ang spotlight kay John Rey at Jonathan kung sinuman sila. At tangina pa ni Jonathan. Hindi ito ang kwento ni Father Juan Severino Mallari. Ano kayang sasabihin ni Mallari kung bumangon siya sa hukay niya ngayon? His story is rich with moral dilemmas and gray areas and very significant and relevant topics such as psychological disorders that could have been interpreted and revealed to us in a way na may twist pa rin siguro? without adding those unnecessary fictional elements. This could have been the chance to talk more about the Church and our individual beliefs and how it clashes with each other but they didn't. In fact, bakit hindi na lang nila ginawang drama? Hindi na lang nila ginawang isang pelikula na sa mga susunod na taon ay magiging isang klasiko? Kontemporaryo? Isang mahalagang reperensya? Bakit thriller? Bakit Haunted Mansion style? For the last 20 years most of the Filipino films that have been released are all short-lived. Konting-konti lang ang nagsusurive ng maraming taon at pinapanood at tinatangkilik pa rin hanggang ngayon. This could have been the chance for God's sakes!!!!!! And, no, we do not need millions of budget to make masterpieces, no. God, wala na sumigi na ako. Hinding hindi maikakaila na lagong-lago ang imahinasyon ng mga taong nasa likod ng pelikulang ito. I liked or maybe loved the creativity that was poured unto to the making of this film. I needed some hope na mayroon pa ring mga sining na pinaghihirapan at hindi pineperahan. And, Mallari maybe gave me that hope, gaano man kaliit. Alam ko na hindi pa rin ito yung ginustong nilang maging katapusan ng pelikula. They were just so limited, perhaps, by factors such as censorship, pressure from corporations from investors? O, kaya, iniisip na lang lagi ng mga filmmakers natin na ang mga manonood ay yung mga casual moviegoers lang, ganon ganon. Ayaw kong maging masyadong harsh sa kanila dahil siguro nahihirapan din sila. Pero, ganito na lang ba palagi? Gustong kong may magbago.

bogs02,5,"Mallari (2023) Review:Mallari is a 2023 Philippine horror-drama movie directed by Roderick Cabrido. The screenplay was written by Enrico Santos. It’s produced by Allan V. Aldea, Ronalyn Bana-ag, John Bryan Diamante, Roxan Mendoza, Carl Yvan Dornila, and Gio Medina. The film’s production companies here are Mentorque Productions and Clever Minds Inc. It’s distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and Star Cinema. It stars Piolo Pascual, Janella Salvador, JC Santos, Elisse Joson Vangie Labalan, Bart Guingona, Ge Villamil, Raffy Tejada, and Gloria Diaz.“The movie is inspired by true events. The story is set in three generations and follows the Mallari family: Juan Severino, John Rey, and Jonathan (all of whom are portrayed by Piolo Pascual). Juan Severino was a Catholic priest and serial killer during the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines in the 19th century. John Rey is a photo journalist and also the grandnephew of Juan Severino during post-World War II. Johnathan is his great-grandnephew and also a doctor in the modern world. Their stories interlink with one another.”I was honestly looking forward to this film. Ever since I’ve read about its premise, it immediately caught my attention. The trailer was solid. It has a pretty interesting premise. The history that aspects of its story have taken inspiration from catches my attention. If executed properly, this would be a really solid movie. I was eagerly waiting for its release on Netflix, and after finally watching it, I have to say that I was rather disappointed with it. I really wanted to like this film, but there are a lot of things here that are pretty dull.Mallari (2023) is a mixed bag. It’s decently directed, and it also has a solid cast. Visually, it looks great, and the music was excellent. There is some creepy atmosphere here, and again, the premise was interesting. Unfortunately, the film leaves a lot to be desired, especially with its script. It has a very messy, bland, and uninteresting story. The characters are wooden, and a lot of the dialogue was cringeworthy. The pacing is inconsistent, and the scares are very cheap. This film was mediocre. Here are my thoughts on the movie:Positives:- It’s a decently directed film. Roderick Cabrido did a fairly serviceable job with the film’s overall direction. There are definitely some moments here where I can see what they’re going for. As for the cast, I thought they were pretty solid. A lot of the performances here are good. Their chemistry with each other was also fairly decent here. Piolo Pascual’s performance certainly shines throughout the entire duration of the film. He’s performance was good.- Visually, the film actually looks pretty good. There are plenty of shots here that looks excellent, especially the final shot. Some of the camera work that they’ve done here is also pretty good. Aside from its overall cinematography, the film also has a solid atmosphere. There were some moments where I find this aspect to be incredibly effective. The music composed by Von de Guzman is excellent. It fits the tone of the film, and at times, it was effective.- As for its premise, this aspect was the reason I wanted to watch it. The film has a very intriguing premise, and there are moments where I can see the potential. Unfortunately, the execution could’ve been better (more on that later on). Aside from that, there are a couple of decent moments here and there. There are a couple of creepy moments, especially with the atmosphere. Its production is a mixed bag. At times, this aspect here was fairly decent.Negatives:- As for my issues, despite a pretty interesting premise, the execution certainly leaves a lot to be desired, especially with the script, which was rather lackluster. There are some moments here where I can see the potential that it has, but it often devolves into a generic and messy story. The structure here was all over the place. It doesn’t really help that it was also underdeveloped. It’s really disappointing how underbaked the premise of this movie is.- Not only is the story very lackluster, but the same thing can also be said about the characters themselves. Sure, the performances from the cast members may be solid, the characters that they are portraying, on the other hand, just fall flat to me. I didn’t really care about or find any of them to be all that interesting. The dialogue is also pretty terrible at times. It tries to be modern with its dialogue here, but it usually ends up being really cringeworthy.- Aside from that, the editing here is also pretty choppy. Not only from the overall structure of its narrative but also within its jump scares. Speaking of its jump scares, they aren’t good. Sure, the film can be creepy at times, but it’s not all that scary. The jump scares that it does here often end up being predictable and clichéd. It did this weird edit that was really sloppy. It doesn’t help that the movie also bombards you with unnecessary sound effects.- As for its visual effects, they aren’t good either; they’re actually quite awful. Some of the special effects that it does in here look pretty cheap and noticeable. It could’ve been a lot better. Pacing-wise, this aspect is very inconsistent. There are a couple of moments where the movie is a bit of a drag to get through, and other times, it feels incredibly rushed. It just felt messy. Some scenes here are also pretty lackluster, which affects the pacing even more.Final Thoughts:Overall, Mallari (2023) is such a mixed bag for me. There are aspects here that I really liked, and some that don’t really work whatsoever. It’s a decently directed film by Roderick Cabrido. The premise itself is pretty interesting, and there are a couple of moments here where you can definitely see the potential. As for the cast themselves, they’re pretty good. A lot of the performances are great. There’s also some fairly decent chemistry between the cast members in here. Piolo Pascual shines throughout the movie’s entire runtime.Visually, I think the film actually looks pretty good. There are a couple of terrific shots here and there. The cinematography also does a good job of giving the film a bit of a creepy atmosphere. Aside from that, the music that was composed by Von de Guzman is excellent. This also helps with the film’s atmosphere. The overall production here can be a little bit of a mixed bag, but there are some moments where it was quite decent, in my opinion. Aside from that, there are also a couple of pretty decent moments here and there.Unfortunately, despite an intriguing premise, the execution was just all over the place. The script is pretty lackluster in a lot of aspects, often making its story feel messy and underdeveloped. This was such a shame because there are some moments here where I can see what they’re going for, but the story just felt really generic at times. Aside from its story, the characters here are also rather bland, making me not really care much for any of them. Some of the lines of dialogue here are also pretty awful. They can be cringeworthy.Aside from that, its editing can be very choppy in some scenes, especially when it comes to its jump scares. Speaking of its jump scares, there’s way too much here, and none of them works. They’re just predictable, and there is also an overabundance of sound effects. The visual effects are atrocious, and the pacing here is very inconsistent. There are instances where the film is a bit of a drag to get through. I really wanted to like this film; I really do. But despite some pretty solid ideas, as a whole, this just leaves a lot to be desired.5.5/10What are your thoughts?",2024-06-21,10,2,watch,False

Despite having a messy flow of events, if you have enough comprehension of it all, it's a good film until towards THE ENDING. The ending could have been better. The clues and evidences were already there, he was JUST SO BAD at investigating and connecting shit and he was so impulsive in his decisions and there is no scene he is CALM AND THINKING RATIONALLY. And his fiancee was even the first one to solve the mystery of the present killings.If he could have known who the killer was earlier, he could have saved his fiancee. The ending really disappointed me I wanted it to be a happy ending where the curse is no longer existent yet he (main protagonist) didn't learn anything at all despite everytthing he saw in time travelling and watching the tapes of his ancestor. I bet his ancestors had the biggest facepalm in their graves when he decided his decision.To be fair, the cinematography, props, setting, are really good.

strawberry_tea,4,"There were a lot of good elements but ultimately this movie fell flat for me. It just felt like the movie was trying to do too much and alot of it just ended up half-baked and under developed. It's supernatural horror, a slasher, a time travel movie, a murder mystery, a social commentary, a psychological thriller, it just feels disjointed and I'm left feeling disapointed because there were alot of good ideas that felt just felt jammed in there. I really didn't care much for the time travel plot which is unfortunate because it makes-up like 85% of the plot. I would have much loved to see how they would have approached the film if they went full on psychological horror cause the third act with JC Santos and Piolo Pascual duking it out was so great. Dialogue and Acting was so on point and the scene just felt so fleshed out compared to the rest of the screenplay. I would have loved to see an angle where the mallari curse wasn't real so Jonathan just feels like he's going insane for the whole film and maybe he thinks that he's the killer and the whole 3rd act scene with JC Santos just plays out. But yeah we got this instead.. I will say though I did like the final scene at the hospital It was probably the only supernatural scene in the whole movie where I actually felt unnerved but then they followed it up with the next scene which not only ruined the momentum but it was just completely uneccessary. We know that what jonathan did was wrong and we know the implications of his actions because we literally see it as clear as day in the scenes prior so why add another scene of the characters just talking about what we already know? Don't take your audience for granted we can understand what you're trying to say without you having to spell it out for us.Another issue I had with the film was the fact that it just wasn't scary. The ""horror"" in this movie just comes from an abundance of jumpscares and loud accompanying music stings. Of course if you're gonna throw something at my face I'm bound to react.All in all I really feel like this movie was a missed opportunity. The acting is great, production and sets were great. Maybe it was just too ambitious or maybe it wasn't ambitious enough.",2024-06-21,0,0,watch,False

ave8888,10,"a fresh concept, and i couldn't be more glad that it was piolo pascual who starred in it. however, we shouldn't forget jc santos's spectacular supporting performance during the unravelling of the story. i'm not sure whether to review the films based on the technicalities of the plot or the in-depth interweaving of the characters' relationships, but safe to say, both are well written. let me first start with the technicalities, which can be simply ruled out by semantics: baby jonathan calling johnrey ""tito-lolo"". jonathan isn't johnrey's son with felicity, given that he is his ""tito-lolo/lolo-tito"". and so, johnrey must have a sibling, from which jonathan came from. or if we lean to the ""lolo"" part, jonathan's direct relationship with johnrey is by johnrey's child with felicity. but then again, the same question arises with severino. being a priest, he isn't supposed to have descendants, which opens the possibility that the mallaris played by piolo pascual have siblings that aren't in the story, but had the chance to continue the blood line. given the time gap between 1812 to 1948 and 1948 to 2023, i assume that the ability to ""travel"" skips every one or two years in the mallari blood line. and if we were to get a spin-off film about those undisclosed generations but with their own peculiarities, why not? i enjoyed this film enough that i'd want a second one. as for the review about the characters' relationships, which i'd admit is a more informal review, i'll do in another entry.",2024-06-21,1,0,watch,True

ave8888,10,"this is the characters' review:if there is anything we know about the mallaris, it's that they're devoted to the people they love. father severino mallari, despite being the marketed center of the story as the first serial killer priest in the philippines, turned out to be a tortured character, who was flawed enough to make mistakes and have turbulent emotions about the people he loved. they gave father severino, a supposed serial killer, a heart, and a facet that made him undeniably human. personally, i like when supposed villains/evil characters show that human quality to themselves. severino, all distraught and maddened yet surrendered by the situation of his mother, still found the strength in his knees to dance his monster-turned-mother. sure, poke fun at him and call him a ""mama's boy"", but it's not like he had a choice in the matter. especially not when the choices were your own mother or your principles. and how many times have our mothers derailed our principles completely? severino's love was devout.moving onto the second mallari, johnrey: i couldn't say much about him that isn't about his intelligence, martyrdom, and commitment to the future generation. johnrey ended the curse by not choosing the same path severino did. johnrey was selfless, and his love didn't manifest in a way that would put others in harm's way. johnrey's love was kind.and to the third mallari, jonathan. amongst the rest, jonathan chose all the wrong choices. even agnes herself said it would've been better had jonathan let him die. jonathan all throughout the film was misleading, taking on the role of an unreliable narrator, or at least, an ambiguous one. if anything, jonathan's love is unrelenting. and to the special mention, lucas. lucas, oh, he could've been everything. had this been an alarcon-centric film, it would still be as interesting. lucas's motivations which eventually flowed into desperation almost sounded as if he wasn't only faithfully attached to jonathan mallari, but also a servant who loved his faulty master through and through. lucas calling jonathan ""amo"" was something else. i'm not sure whether i'm viewing everything through the colored lenses of queerness, but lucas's devotion to jonathan had undertones of romanticism and obsession that could only be explained if he were in love with him. and such display would make for good alternate universe writings about this story.",2024-06-21,1,0,watch,True

escapistmedia,7,"Ibang klaseng generational trauma naman 'to, teh.Kidding aside, Mallari had lots of potential as a culturally-nuanced Filipino horror film, but fell short on certain aspects. Fictionalizing the life of Fr. Severino Mallari — reported to be the Philippines' first serial killer — into a film that incorporates elements of folk horror, historical fiction, science fiction, and thriller was promising. It succeeded in drawing upon elements of folk religion and true crime to invite viewers into the life and motives of a creepy and murderous priest, and Piolo Pascual — timeless of an actor he is — nailed the triple roles of Fr. Mallari, Johnrey, and Jonathan quite excellently.The storytelling and production design were quite able to establish the settings in each of the Mallari eras, but the horror elements of the film were left to be desired. The jump scares felt gimmicky and did not serve any real purpose to the storyline other than to imply that Johnrey and Jonathan had psychic abilities. The suspense was present, though I wish Mallari had touched upon the concepts of folk religion and witchcraft a little further to better understand the sociocultural contexts in which the settings of the film revolved in. The motives behind Maria Capac's practice of witchcraft wasn't made clear, apart from maybe the implication that peasant folk like them just wanted to exact revenge on the elite. It would've been nice if the subversiveness of the practice of occultism had been given better emphasis within the contexts of colonial and post-war Philippines, but maybe that's just the sociological analysis-hungry viewer in me wanting more lol. There were also moments when I felt as if the depiction of occultism in the film was a little clichéd (""impoverished househelp uses dark magic against the rich people they serve"" felt a little telenovela-esque), but maybe that was intentional to reflect its generally taboo reputation. I did notice, however, similarities in the portrayal of the practice with what was shown in Lorcan Finnegan's Nocebo (2023), where Chai Fonacier played a vengeful mangkukulam disguised as a timid homeopathy-practicing OFW.But all in all, Mallari is a refreshing take on horror, especially for a MMFF release. It's dark, eerie, and adds to the foray of contemporary Filipino media that draws inspiration from real historical events and figures. I'm no horror enthusiast, but I do appreciate it when a Filipino film weaves our history and culture into its storytelling... especially when it includes the parts of our culture that are often left in the dark.",2024-06-22,0,0,watch,False

jamenn,4,"Hindi ko matapos-tapos ʼyung palabas. Sabi nang huwag kasi gagalaw Piolo Pascual e, malapit na nga matapos.Sa kabuuan, half disappointed/half okay-ish para sa akin. Hindi ko maikakaila, medyo nag-improve kahit papaano ang MMFF nitong nakaraan ngunit parang ni-recycle lamang ang mga materyal nito. May pag-asa pa rin ako sa takilya dahil kahit papaano, paunti-unti nang bumabalik ang interes ng mga tao sa panonood ng palabas sa sinehan. Balik na tayo tungkol sa palabas.Sa totoo lang, interesting talaga ang palabas na ito. Biruin mo pinagtagpi-tagping panahon, serial killer, at history ng Pinas, maganda nga siguro. Magandang ideya ngunit pakiramdam ko may mali dahil sa pagkawala ng originality ng palabas na ito. Habang nanonood ka, hindi mawawalay sa kaisipan mo na ihalintulad ito sa mga palabas sa Hollywood. Hindi na bago, gasgas na rin. Pero kung ididisregard natin iyan, makakapiga pa rin naman tayo ng katas sa kagandahan nito. Isa nga ring problema, sa mga linyang sinabi sa palabas na ito. Tambay ba sa Twitter ang writer nito? medyo hindi lang ako sang-ayon sa mga piniling salita at nagsasalita kasi pakiramdam ko ay pinipilit lamang ito para makisabay sa panahon ngayon. Wala ring saysay at hindi ako tinamaan sa mga huling kataga ng mga karakter, ang cringe bwisit. Magw-work pa rin naman ang palabas na ito kahit na walang mga multo. Magandang ideya sana ngunit naging isa sa mga sablay nito ang pagdagdag pa ng multo ng mga pinatay. Minsan epektibo ang jumpscares sa palabas na ito pero bakit ginagasgas nito dahil sa paulit-ulit at prediktableng pananakot. Hay, buti nalang nakuha ang tindig ng balahibo ko nung kinuha na ʼyung projector.Nagampanan naman nang maayos ng mga aktor at aktres ang kani-kanilang role. Lupit pa rin ni Piolo Pascual, first time ko siyang makitang umacting sa horror film. Para naman kay JC Santos, lupit ka rin talaga, puwede na maging Joker ng Pinas. Si Janella, okay lang, parang akala niya nasa Darna TV show pa rin siya.Mala-Christopher Nolan ampeg ang pag-edit ng palabas na ito. Ayos, dahil epektibo ang non-linear na pagkuwento. Sablay lang talaga siguro ang production sa VFX dahil napa-WHAT nalang ako sa isang scene (nakakasura after mo mapanood dahil mapapaisip ka kung 2 to 3 stars nalang ba ang mair-rate mo rito sa Letterboxd). Solido rin ang transisyon tuwing pinagtatagpi na ang noon at ngayon. Maliban sa iniiskip na frame para sa jumpscares, wala na akong reklamo. Medyo binigyan din ako ng chills sa score at soundtrack ng palabas na ito. Pasado rin ang sinematograpiya ng palabas na ito. Ako lang ata nakapansin na medyo shaky ʼyung camera nung isang scene haha.Ayun lang.Official yapyap ko sa palabas na Mallari.",2024-06-22,4,0,watch,False

May serial killer, may astral prjection, may mambabarang, cult-ish yung line of servants ng family… by the time na naging manananggal si Gloria Diaz medyo bumitaw na ako ng very light sa plot. I’m a sucker for generational curses though, so I still enjoyed seeing three generations of Mallari men trying to save the one they love the most, kebs na sa eternal damnation, ganon. My favorite scenes were the interactions of Mallari men, and I loved the concept of being able to return to a specific time by carrying a Mallari keepsake with them when they sleep. What else… oh, medyo tumatak yung acting ni Elisse dito — the way she delivered her coconut line was smooth, believable yung implied background ng character niya. The jumpscares were pretty weak, the writing was a little all over the place, but most of the actors were good in the roles given to them. I feel like it could’ve been a shorter film, though. I wish they chose fewer folk / supernatural tales to incorporate in the story. That would’ve made the movie’s plot tighter and maybe, a bit more compelling.",2024-06-22,0,0,watch,False

zoey_de_leon,5,"I craved it all up as a horror fan, I just thought that it went all very crazy towards the end.It's fine that they used the based on real events backdrops on Mallari using the time travel stuff and I think that's enough for a fantastical addition to the story but as they aren't satisfied enough, suddenly all of these series of events introduced monsters such as manananggal and an aswang. It was justified for the story but it could have been done differently in a more thriller than a fantastical way. I just thought that for a revisionism from a real life serial killer is way too overboard. Add in the ghosts of the victims played for cheap jumpscares. could have reduced those into some few scenes than be played repeatedly.Talking about the ending. It switches its theme of the whole movie where it is supposed to be a serious horror melodrama but it ends into taken out of a Shake, Rattle & Roll ending where jt is all like campy and hits with a punchline.

azuregq,4,"Sa direksiyon ni Derick Cabrido at panulat ni Enrico Santos, isa itong pelikulang horror na tungkol sa isang doktor na si Jonathan Mallari De Dios (Piolo Pascual) na bumalik sa bahay ng kanilang angkan upang hanapin ang maaaring lunas sa sakit ng kaniyang fiancee na si Agnes (Janella Salvador). Habang hinahanap niya ito, matutuklasan niya ang sikreto ng kanilang angkan partikular sa buhay nina John Rey Mallari na isang dokumentarista at Fr. Severino Mallari na isang pari at pinaniniwalaang unang serial killer sa bansa.Mapupuri ko ang pelikula sa effort nito na tahakin ang ibang direksiyon sa halip na magtuon lamang sa sub genre ng horror na slasher o patayan. Sa kasamaang palad, sa sobrang gustong pagsanibin ang halos lahat ng mga elemento rito ng horror, naging magulo na ito. Kahit iyong paggamit ng konsepto ng time travel at astral projection ay magulo para sa akin sapagkat sa pagkakaalam ko, magkaiba ang dalawang ito. Mas nakagulo pa sa pelikula ang pag-eedit nito ng di-linyar na pagsasalaysay dahil sa ilang paulit-ulit na eksena na tingin ko, puwede pang gawing pulido sa isahang pagpapakita lamang. Hindi rin gaanong nabigyan ng linaw ang motibo ng pamilya Alarcon sa pamilya Mallari.Kapuri-puri din ang disenyong pamproduksiyon nito ngunit napag-iwanan naman ang visual effects nito gayong medyo bumubuti naman ito. Napag-iwanan kasi isa sa mga prodyuser nito ay Warner Bros. Philippines tapos ganoon lang ang inabot ng VFX? Ewan ko ba. HAHAHA! Bilang karagdagan, ayos din naman ang sinematograpiya at musika at tunog nito ngunit dahil naging paulit-ulit ang paglapat ng musika sa pare-parehong jump scares, ang unang karanasan na nakakagulat ay naging nakaiirita habang tumatagal. Sa tuwing may paparating na halatang jump scare, napapairap na lang ako at minsan, napapabuntunghininga.Sa pagganap naman ni Piolo Pascual, hindi ko nakitaan ng pagkakaiba-iba ang tatlong Mallari. Parang pare-parehong Jonathan lamang ang nakikita ko na nag-iba-iba lamang ng bihis. Marahil, nakaapekto rito ang kulang na karakterisasyon nina John Rey na nalimitahan lamang sa pagiging dokumentarista at Jonathan na nalimitihan lamang sa papel nito sa buhay ni Agnes. Kung mayroon man akong papupurihan kay Pascual, iyon ay ang eksena matapos ang una niyang pagpatay na lumabas ang kaniyang kakayahan bilang aktor sa drama. Bukod pa rito, iyong alter ego ni Fr. Severino Mallari na nakabihis bilang San Bartolome, mahusay. Medyo nasapawan nga rin siya ni JC Santos sa totoo lang kaya nakuha ko na iyong pagkapanalo niya ng Best Supporting Actor sa nakaraang Gabi ng Parangal ng MMFF 2023 dahil malinaw na naipakita ni Santos ang pagbabago sa katauhan ni Brother Lucas. Napaisip tuloy ako, paano kaya kung si Santos ang leading role? Sa tingin ko, naging disadvantage ng pelikula ang pag-promote nito bilang kakaibang horror kaya nadismaya nga ako. Sa ganda ng trailer nito, naging mataas ang inaasahan dito. Sa panonood ko nito, nakita ko iyong effort sa direksiyon at bisyon ng pelikula pero habang tumatagal, nagiging trying hard na ito. Kaya, masasabi ko na mas maayos pa ang pagkakabuo ng Kampon (2023) dito. Kampon > Mallari. That's it.-----Ranking ng MMFF 20231) Firefly 2) GOMBURZA3) Becky and Badette4) Kampon5) Family of Two6) Mallari7) Rewind8) Penduko9) Broken Heart's Trip",2024-06-21,0,0,watch,False

dmtalkies,,"""Directed by Roderick Cabrido, the Filipino horror film Mallari stars Piolo Pascual as the three main characters living in different time periods: Juan Severino Mallari, Johnrey, and Jonathan. The film is centered around the Mallari family from Magalang, Pampanga. In 2023, Jonathan, a doctor, returned to his ancestral property in Magalang to find the cure for his wife’s illness, and that was when the supernatural phenomena began. The film is inspired by the real-life story of Father Juan Severino Mallari of Magalang, Pampanga, infamous for killing 57 people.

jamcritics,,"Gave this one a try and that alone shouldn’t be too hard, right? Except it was.Mallari feels like a rollercoaster ride watching it where you are bombarded with too many things going on, too many information that isn’t put to light. It becomes very awry and sleazy as the film drags on, hoping to reach a certain angle that only becomes a disappointment especially for horror fans.There were so much that bothered me from this one especially as a horror and film fan. And it didn’t help knowing that Mallari is based on a real person. The lore of it all, the “astral projection” being a dumb plot device, the time-jumps, the weird cuts that produced so many continuity errors, the visual effects, the many information that didn’t really work…consuming everything from this film is draining.The only merit I would give this film is JC Santos’ performance that always has me in awe. He can play any sort of role perfectly that just suits him. Also the cinematography that had great camera tricks using the Dutch angles and that one scene using mirror between JC Santos & Piolo Pascual’s fight in the end.The point for this film was to follow the true story of Mallari, the Philippines’ first ever recorded serial killer from the 19th century. Except it was all a ploy to lure people in, making its audience expect a biopic of some sort of a serial killer that only became stupid, fictionalizing almost everything there is to Mallari and making the audience see that serial killers can have good intentions. There are a few serial killer films/shows that actually lets its audience look further into the person’s story (or from their perspective), yet also distinguishing the fact that these people are villains and that you have to understand that you are seeing everything from the villain’s eyes. Or in this case, a serial killer.",2024-06-22,3,0,watch,False

Bakit paulit-ulit mga sinasabi nila? However, I don't agree with a certain FB post 🧐 that said na this was a waste of time and that the time travel concept was not good. Yes, it is long. Yes, it felt weird going through all three timelines the way the movie did. But, the movie held its own despite it not knowing kung ano ba talaga gusto niya gawin - maging love story ba ni Piolo and Janella? Bloodline ng Mallari? Bloodline ng Alarcon? Filipino Folklore? o story ba talaga ni Fr. Severino? I think that it is only a waste of time if you were expecting a Hollywood level horror story (even Hollywood horror movies are not that good). You know better than to expect that.(Steering away from the review of the movie itself but about na ito sa post...)One of the points sa review na 'yun is the cgi. It was not the best but it tried. We put the Filipino Film industry in such high standards that we're not allowing our OWN movies to make mistakes, learn better, and grow from it. The thing that I find weird is, we're all screaming for better Filipino films, but then we have one that is trying its best, and then we laugh at it. Saan na pupunta mga creators natin kung pati mga kapwa Pilipino hindi sila tinatangkilik?

suusheese,4,"When I first saw the trailer for this last MMFF I was onboard with it. I read ahead about what Fr. Severino Mallari was all about. Biopics are my bread and butter, and with every biopic, or in this case, an adaptation, I anticipate a degree of creative storytelling to make it more feasable for cinema. What was the films take on this? A Generational ""curse"" in the Mallari family. Interesting. The real Mallari was allegedly scizhophrenic; so I was hoping theyd explore that, a mental illness angle plaguing the family for generations. Much to my disappointment, the movie veered away from that and laid blame not into the serial killer but to an entirely fictional group of people who ""used"" this serial killer to kill. Severino (Piolo Pascual) was essentially forced to kill out of love. A theme which kind of fell flat because of how many things the film wanted to juggle. Was it a mystery? Was it a thriller? A supernatural horror? A sci-fi? Yes, sci-fi.Taking away Fr Severino's agency erases or paints the actions of the real Mallari as not his own choice; if it was indeed mental illness it wouldve made more sense but instead it was the malicious work of well meaning witches. Which, in an original story MAY work, but not in this. Its supposed to be BASED on a real story yet it strayed a little too much into fiction. A creative choice that MIGHTVE worked if only they didnt add astral projection and timey wimey shit into it too. OH plus origins of a notorious Philippine mythic creature.There were some creative shots here and there, I particularly liked this one shot when John was walking through a door and a dolly zoom boxed him in the corridor. However the scares were lack luster. It relied heavily jumpscares which became old fast and can be easily expected. While the makeup and visual effects were great, I dont think it utilized it enough to anything other than. ** SPOILERS FOR THE ENDING **god I hated ending. Heres DOCTOR John Mallari; granted hes a pediatrician (I think) with a FIANCE whose also a DOCTOR thats dying bc she got stabbed, his first response was NOT to bring her to a nearby hospital for first aid. And despite being on life support clearly conscious and capable of surviving given medical aid, MISTER JOHNATAN STILL DECIDES TO BRING BACK THE BIRD AND TAKE THE CURSE. WHICH IS THE WORST WAY TO GIVE AGENCY BACK TO THE MALLARI FAMILY when the previous 2 mallari's tried retreiving their lost agency by breaking the curse only for millenial Piolo Pascual to take it back.In summary, story is Messy. Acting is subpar, EXCEPT for JC Santos he stole the show. He was amazing and a twist I saw a mile a way but still welcome because of how well he acted.

I think kinulang sa creativity, kasi malaki ang potensyal ng kwento para manakot at manggulat. Kaso masyadong dumepende sa cuts at sound effects.Pero maganda ang concept. Nakakamangha 'yung second half nang nailatag na ang mga sikreto at misteryo. Complex ang kwento, kaya nakakabilib na maayos itong naihayag.Sa second half din mas nag-shine ang performances ng mga bida. JC Santos, deserving ng best supporting actor sa mmff. And Piolo Pascual, perfect casting. May isang scene na tumatak sa akin dahil sa performanceS niya. All in all, 3/5 kasi medyo na-outweigh pa rin ng flaws ng pelikula ang good aspects nito. May magagandang creative choices in terms of filmmaking, pero sana mas napagtuunan din ng pansin ang mga ""scares.""

tontonico,6,"Movie could've been great but as I was watching it, I got totally lost and confused as to what the movie was trying to achieve. The jump scares were so predictable and the CGI was just plain awful. What's with those CGI ghost faces?! The way they CGI'd Gloria Diaz was cringey as fuck. Not to mention those awful manananggal wings which literally made us want to stop watching the entire film.One major ick I have was Padre Severino's weird beard. Like couldn't they have made it more natural? It looked so fake I couldn't take him seriously. They honestly should've just invested on the cast's makeup or prosthetics to make everything look convincing. I honestly could not help but compare it to cult favorite Filipino horror movies like Feng Shui and Sukob. No CGIs there but it was definitely scarier and more realistic by a mile.I still gave it four stars because, okay, it was ambitious - I'll give them that. But it was too ambitious it failed to just stick to what people came to watch the movie for - Fr. Severino Mallari's story. I think a lot of people were expecting to watch and know more of his backstory and his motivation, but sadly this was a huge opportunity missed.",2024-06-23,0,0,watch,False

gininina,9,"“diba, isang sumpa ang magmahal?”—bago ang lahat, sana ‘wag kayo malito sa astral projection ni piolo pascual at talagang subaybayan niyo para ma-gets niyo ng true kasi konektado ang lahat. aliw rin si amal at ng colloquialism ng film na ‘to. “pasensya na kung amoy kiffy” -amal bwahahahaha! putting jest aside, i came to a realization that this nail-biting Filipino film, inspired by true events yet interwoven with fictional elements, fundamentally springs from undying love. each character, driven by their own ambitions, had one thing in common: their actions were motivated by love. among Piolo's three portrayals in ""Mallari""—Severino, Johnrey, and Jonathan—it was Johnrey i found as the most courageous character. his initial ambition to investigate the Mallari family's history and his selfless sacrifices, motivated by love, set him apart. meanwhile, Jonathan’s determination to keep Agnes alive demonstrated a different facet of this enduring theme. as for severino, i sympathized with him, recognizing that he never truly desired the tragic events that transpired. yet, he continued to submit himself in vicious killings to save his beloved mother which only reveal that desperate times need desperate actions. lason ang wagas na pagmamahal. lason ang pamilyang alarcon. lason ang sisiw. sadly, parang ang sumira nga lang sa patronage ng traditional philippine architecture ay dahil sa mga ganitong horror films. nevertheless, i give this film a 10/10! as it brings a refreshing justice in demands in the realm of modern Filipino horror cinema. lesson learned: “ang isang tao ay kabuuan lamang ng kaniyang mga pagkakamali”",2024-06-24,0,0,watch,True

Una sa lahat, nakakanginig ‘yung mga linyahan haha akala mo mga nakuha lang somewhere on the internet just to match this generation’s language. Hay, na-dismaya lang ako nang kaunti pero ayos na rin. Nawalan na rin ng sense of suspense sa ibang mga scenes dahil nga ang predictable na ng mga susunod na jumpscare, halos sunod-sunod kasi at ‘yung iba parang out of context pa. Despite all the shortcomings, cinematography still did its job.Kudos din sa casting, magagaling naman talaga mga napili. Especially si JC Santos, never fails talaga parang paghinga lang ang pag-arte sa kanya kahit na hindi gaanong suwak ‘yung mga lines for his energy eh.

lyfaiths,6,"Mallari was the movie I was most looking forward to out of all the MMFF entries last year, given it was the first movie distributed by Warner Bros (I could be wrong here), but sad to say it's at most a solid 3/5.While it tackles a lot of firsts, it's also a movie that uses the redundancy of the Filipino ""timpla"". Like, men are so stupid and unreasonable. Jonathan, darling, I get it—it's Janella Salvador, but really? Father, why is the wig weave showing like that? (Tatak Pinoy films to have bad wigs, I said what I said). JC Santos, that nose acting, bro. I'm so frigging tired. I don't even watch horror, but those jumpscares did nothing to me—they are just jumpscares and didn't add anything to the plot.I think in this day and age, we would all rather die than be a maligno. I also would like to point out that he became a werewolf at some point, and the cinematography used shadows—and the shadows were cheap in form. I guess I want to say in the end, Filipino films' bare minimum is moving in the right direction.",2024-06-24,0,0,watch,False
