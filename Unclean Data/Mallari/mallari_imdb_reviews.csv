IAmRalphTrani,"Jan 1, 2024","Great story, Cheap Jumpscares","The story was alright, it had a little bit of humour, a little bit of twist, but I wished the story showed a little bit of a long prologue before the scary parts started. It's like every filipino horror film, always start with a jumpscare or a suspense already, this makes every scare in the movie expected. The cinematic camera movements we're pretty good especially when the mother and the old century priest started dancing each other. Some of the dialogues weren't fit for the scene, but that dosen't mean the whole story is bad. The movie will be still counted for being a horror but do not expect good scares.",6
redemptions_love,"Jul 9, 2024",Interesting plot!,"There are pros and cons to this film. It did remind me of a Made for Television Movie, and horror elements did come across rather B Grade. Because of the latter this film may not be for everyone. Certainly elements of it could be improved upon. In terms of horror, I personally find B Grade Slashers and special effects to be rather campy and fun. So this didn't bother me at all.

The reason I watched this film all the way through was 100% due to the plot to the film, I found it very interesting and well done. This isn't a perfect movie, but if you like a good story then I do recommend it. I thought it was very intriguing. I won't leave any spoilers, all I will say is that right at the end the plot caught me by surprise, which rarely happens when I watch movies.

I found the Character Development, especially towards the end of the film to be executed nicely. Two particular characters were very thought provoking.

Anywho, ultimately I recommend this movie for the story, and if you find horror elements that are more on the B Grade side to be fun. Lastly, I found the switching of time periods to not be confusing in this film at all. It worked smoothly in my opinion, it's actually one of the things I enjoyed the very most.",7
phristocardiel,"Dec 29, 2023",It's ok,"A few jump scares here and there. Movies' first half was well written. Script had humor and energy during the first half. The 2nd half, though, felt like it was originally written in English and then translated to Tagalog. Dialogue felt off sometimes and I wish the attitude of the first half carried on throughout the movie. The mystery and the way things unfold will keep you hook. But once everything is out, it all goes downhill. Ending is not something you have not seen or experience. It's been done multiple times and I wish the film could've wrapped differently. Horror fans might find this average.",5
ralphralf,"Jun 30, 2024",Good but there are buts...,"""**Mallari** is a promising film within the horror genre, offering a genuinely scary and creepy experience. The atmospheric tension is palpable, and the eerie settings enhance the overall sense of dread. However, despite its strong elements, the film falls short in delivering a seamless narrative. The storytelling feels convoluted at times, which detracts from the otherwise engaging experience.

The acting is commendable, with the cast delivering convincing performances that elevate the film. Additionally, the film's setting is well-executed, effectively immersing the audience in the haunting world of **Mallari**. While the presence of typical Filipino tropes might be seen as a drawback by some, I personally didn't mind them as they added a cultural authenticity to the film.

Overall, **Mallari** is a solid horror film with a lot of potential. With some refinements in its storytelling, it could have been a standout in the genre. Nonetheless, it remains an enjoyable watch for horror enthusiasts and a notable entry in Filipino cinema.""",6
agnesmarieglapus,"Jun 22, 2024",Had huge potential but failed miserably,"Movie could've been great but as I was watching it, I got totally lost and confused as to what the movie was trying to achieve. The jump scares were so predictable and the CGI was just plain awful. What's with those CGI ghost faces?! The way they CGI'd Gloria Diaz was cringey AF. Not to mention those awful manananggal wings which literally made us want to stop watching the entire film.

One major ick I have was Padre Severino's weird beard. Like couldn't they have made it more natural? It looked so fake I couldn't take him seriously. They honestly should've just invested on the cast's makeup or prosthetics to make everything look convincing. I honestly could not help but compare it to cult favorite Filipino horror movies like Feng Shui and Sukob. No CGIs there but it was definitely scarier and more realistic by a mile.

I still gave it four stars because, okay, it was ambitious - I'll give them that. But it was too ambitious it failed to just stick to what people came to watch the movie for - Fr. Severino Mallari's story. I think a lot of people were expecting to watch and know more of his backstory and his motivation, but sadly this was a huge opportunity missed.

Will I recommend watching it? No. Will I watch it again? Definitely, NO. If you really are interested, save yourself the disappointment and just watch documentaries about Fr. Mallari on YouTube.",4
katrinamacaballug,"Jul 1, 2024",The script is lacking.,"The stort is about the first serial killer accounted even before jack the ripper and I really expected for it to have more eccentricities or edge in it's script alone wherein the whole concept of the movie is about the dark side of the Philippine history. The jumpscares are not that good as well, the acting of the main characters are lacking as well. However, kudos to the production team in having that courage to showcase a fresh idea in the mainstream entertainment, I have been hearing this in documentaries and podcasts for quite sometime already but not to actually watch it and be reinvented.",6
cyrilgetroika,"Jun 24, 2024","Promising plot, brutal storytelling","I was expecting a historical narration of what transpired 200 years ago, instead I got a crappy, delusional story that's literally all over the place. I hope the writer took the time to really research this thing, instead we got something inspired by Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. He might have come up with a great idea, then midestream decided, ""heck, I don't have enough factual info I'll just swing by the fences and hope I hit gold. It's such an awful film I was embarrassed 30 mins in during movie night. Apologies to my family for dragging them to watch and waste 2+ hours of their time. FAMAS should be ashamed for giving the Best Picture award to this film. As Filipinos I'm sure we can come up with something better than this.",1
darkgreymatter,"Jan 5, 2024",Compelling Plot Marred by Gratuitous Jump Scares,"The film ""Mallari"" boasts a captivating plot intricately linked to Philippine history and urban legend. The commendable acting skills of all characters significantly contribute to the film's appeal. The pacing of the movie strikes a perfect balance-neither too fast nor too slow, preventing viewers from experiencing boredom or confusion.

Regrettably, the movie's downside lies in the inclusion of unnecessary jump scares, creating an abrupt disruption in the flow of the film. This drawback proves to be a significant dent in the overall quality of an otherwise promising story.

Despite this setback, it's important to note that ""Mallari"" still stands as a commendable horror film, especially when compared to the usual offerings in the Philippine horror genre. Its compelling plot, historical ties, and the commendable performances of the cast elevate it above many counterparts, making it a worthwhile watch for enthusiasts of the genre.",8
kaiyamaramobs,"Jan 7, 2024",Eh...,"The movie has it's moments. The actors did a good job with what they had, and personally, the best scenes of the movie were in the 1800s.

The movie falls on a lot of tropes. It has a lot of cheap jumpscares, and I wish they'd have used more of the runtime of the film to flesh out the story, rather than use it on not-so-great jumpscares.

The cinematography for this film was good, as well as the acting, but the script was just okay- this isn't to say the story is bad but the dialogue could've been written better.

The story *is* ambitious, but I feel as if it wasn't fleshed out enough to be worthy of a rewatch, and the script is okay, but it did definitely wasn't good.

(Personal problems or nitpicks with the movie) I can recall this one scene, near the start of the film of which I couldn't exactly point out it's purpose... Basically, a character was walking in the night, in the middle of the forest while having e-s*x. While the character has e-s*x, the murderer sneaks up from behind them and hacks them too death. The scene wasn't that sexually explicit, but the dialogue, as well as the character's hand motions made it uncomfortable to watch. If the dialogue's purpose in that scene was to be humorous, it failed- as when I watched it in a packed theater, most were silent, even when said character was hacked to death. There are more scenes to where I feel the film jumps the shark, like when a character loses their keys in an struggle with the murderer, but end up knocking them out, then going down to try and escape using their car but realizing they don't have it then going back to where the murderer is just for the key. Then a scene where the same character very clearly has the ability to kill the murderer, but does not despite the murderer having clear killing intent. I feel like this scenes like this spefically devalues and reduces the enjoyment of the film for some.",4
ecadiente,"Jan 2, 2024",We still want to watch this Mallari,"Movie review of Mallari (2023) is called: ""Fates Entwined: The Chilling Legacy of Fr. Juan Severino Mallari.""

When the horror movie Mallari delves into the dark and sinister tale of Fr. Juan Severino Mallari (Piolo Pascual), a once-respected Catholic priest turned malevolent serial killer haunting the village of the Philippines during the 19th century. This psychological thriller, directed by Roderick Cabrido, weaves together a spine-chilling narrative that spans three decades, connecting the fates of the Mallari family members - from John Rey in the 1940s to Jonathan in the present day.

The film opens with the tranquil landscapes of the Philippines, setting the stage for the eerie events that unfold. The cinematography masterfully captures the juxtaposition of beauty and horror, enhancing the overall atmosphere of suspense. The use of dark, muted tones contributes to the unsettling ambiance, effectively drawing the audience into the depths of Fr. Mallari's twisted psyche.",10
jeromesgabilo,"Jun 27, 2024",NOT BEST PICTURE AWARD-WORTHY,"I could not understand the hype surrounding this film. I don't even think that this horror film was worthy of bagging the Best Picture trophy at the FAMAS Awards, which was the Philippines' Oscars counterpart. I really think that Piolo Pascual being the protagonist lifted the entire film to its heights. His performance was indeed one of the most excellent I've seen this year. Unfortunately, even his performance could not save the poor writing of the film. The scripts felt amateurish and second-rate. It was a wasted potential, and I wished the scenes were compressed to just one and a half hour running time.",3
ana_k31,"Jun 29, 2024",What's the hype about?,"I honestly thought that I'd be seeing something that somehow has a bit of historical twist at least but yeah what they had was this horror movie. I mean, come on, it's the first serial killer in the Philippines and then suddenly it all turns to aswang and kulam. Argh!

I feel like it's slow paced because a lot has gone on and it's only the half of the film. Well, a lot will happen, but was all of it needed?

Sorry, but I just need to point this out, most of the actors don't know how to speak kapampangan. One even called kamaro Cameroo. Lols

Overall great acting from the cast most especially Piolo. But, I have to agree with what everyone is saying, it's not Best Picture material and what is with all the hype?",4
oliverosjulianna,"Jan 19, 2024",MID,"They really had potential with this movie because of the plot but they blew it up BIG TIME. Very cringy jump scares and awful CGI. Kapag tataga yung pari di mo malaman kung saan na tapyas yung biktima. Piolo was a good actor but his on screen love was awful, she was mediocre. Some scenes I get what jump scare they were trying to do but they chose the wrong camera style so essentially the jump scare was not scary. The main character is DUMB, NAIVE, AND EPAL SOOOOO EPAL! The only reason why this has 4 stars was because they featured the true to life serial killer priest and his segment of the story was good. Do yourself a favor and not watch the movie cause you did not miss much tbh.",4
horrorlover-96807,"Jun 22, 2024",Only the CGI effects bothers me.,"The movie itself was was already great the acting, cinematography, color grading, sound and music editing, and Make up's. I was impressed with this film. Especially those twist. What I really like on this is the movie Tells about time traveling, reincarnation, astral projection.

This movie can really be add on international horror films not just because it's distributed by Warner brothers. The only thing that I really didn't like was the corny CGI especially the Manananggal scene, and the 3D shadows. (Except on the CGI old creepy face of Donña Facunda I really like that) If they fix and work more on the CGI I would give this the perfect rating. I know that some Filipino editors have hard time working on CGI's but I would love if they just use a person shadow rather then 3D.

Overall Great film not really the best but I love it.",9
masrandomness,"Jul 2, 2024",'Mallari' Misses the Mark on True Crime,"""Mallari"" is a fictional film based on the true story of the first serial killer who was a priest in the Philippines. This is the plot that made me want to see this movie. Turns out the movie includes elements of time travel and explores various Filipino ""aswangs"" and beliefs.

Overall, the film isn't bad, but it focuses on the wrong ideas and characters. I would have preferred if it had delved deeper into Father Mallari's mental breakdown and what set him apart from those who choose not to commit murder. Instead, the movie emphasizes Filipino folklore, which downplays the severity of his crimes. One particular scene that I disliked is when Father Mallari tells Jonathan not to get the ""sisiw"", despite having killed over 50 people himself for it. The whole movie feels like an insult to the real-life victims of this priest.

In summary, ""Mallari"" is an okay watch, but I wish it hadn't used a real-life killer and mixed it with folklore fantasy.",5
ReviewbyAfrica,"Jun 30, 2024",This movie deserves more recognition!,"I do not watch horror movies but I watched this with friends last night and we really enjoyed it. I loved everything about the movie.

Cinematography Story telling Plot Lots of minor surprises Learned some ancient Tagalog words

The writing is genius and the actors wow, Piolo Pascual and JC Santos grabe. Their eyes tell so much. To the Director, congratulations!!

This and the Gomburza movie I am so proud of.

One of my favorite part is learning about the main characters' ability.

I would definitely recommend for everyone to watch. Hence, I am writing this review.

It is best to watch with friends. Lol.",10
pliant-moods,"Jul 10, 2024","Plot lacks creativity, better off as a true-crime","The casts were exceptionally well! The lighting choice really brought me back to each intended timeline in the movie.

However, I'm disappointed with the postcolonialism story twist they chose--further capitalizing the story that precolonial practices are but witchcraft and therefore ""evil"". The worst part is the reconstruction of an evil and murderous ""man of God"" to be a subject of Filipino witchcraft, deeming his act of murders as ""innocent"". These angles mean capitalizing on: 1. The majority catholic population 2. Non-christian filipino practices are evil

This movie would have more credibility if more facts and research were done about Mallari. A true crime category would have been more fit. Irrespective, I think they should have stick to the fact that the priest was what he really was, a murderer and an evil man. Nothing justifies the terror he did.",1
paoloenad,"Jun 23, 2024",Piolo carried this Horror Movie very well.,"They could have omitted the monster scene and the movie would have been perfect. The CGI was the only downside, good that there is only one scene. Piolo was a convincing psycho serial killer. Awesome acting on his part considering he is playing multiple character. There were a couple of Jumpscare that got me but it was the story that made me stay. Cinematography was awesome. There were no scenes, that were too dark and the gore was just right, not too much and not too little. Love how they explained the timetravel aspect of the movie. It wasn't too complicated but not to simple that would bore the audience. The movie is something fresh. Horror movie fans should check it out.",9
