Audience,Audience,"I honestly thought this was a historical movie, it was not. The movie is not bad but not great either.

Time travel, a man eating monster, a serial killer, and a chick, they should have added aliens and completed the set.",Am3i0Ys5oFb0hWnsw3fWjSOKt88cKPubWC4NsO8tkkcWmto2FmzfqoHKKcJPFpLcDYSVjcggcPouoOtwnI87iawuPWhkzixBF45F0viJ4FKm,07/06/2024,2.0/5,False,N/A,all-audience
Audience,Audience,"""Mallari"" is a promising film that delivers on horror with its scary and creepy elements. However, it falls short in its seamless storytelling, feeling convoluted at times.

Audience,Audience,"It was a well-crafted movie with a very unpredictable plot. The acting was superb. I was amazed at how good actor Jc Santos is.
