lemisfitvee,5,"With the announcement of Vice Ganda's new project with Jun Lana in the works, I thought I would revisit some of the films in his filmography and I gotta say, while Praybeyt Benjamin didn't exactly age all that well, it became the better Mulan live action we deserve lmao. I mean, imagine that. It has all of Wenn V. Deramas' stylings and add to that a fresh out of the gates of his success as a noontime host and celebrated comedian, getting the chance to helm his own movie, Vice Ganda shows up here with his signature comedic style. The only thing is, and my Dad has said this before and I agree, there's a Vice who gets directed to say jokes and there's a Vice who does adlibs and jokes impromptu that somehow shows a completely polarizing way you experience his comedy. Here, the gags and style were fresh for that time. His command of the camera feels special but it wore out at some point because I feel like Vice does well in situations in the moment not exactly prepared for him. I do have to say, in the moments that allow him to show vulnerability, I don't hate it, especially with the theme of ""a gay man having to play up being a brusque man in order to serve in the military"". Yes, the theme of why should it be any different for him to serve his country as a gay man than being the stereotypical cishet with big muscles? Sure, this feels like a propaganda film but if you're gonna serve your country , SERVE CUNT lmaoooooAnyway, it's still a shame that they didn't get Jimmy Santos in the second movie to play Benji's dad.

Ready for the sequel! (Special attention to the supporting performances: Derek Ramsay and Eddie Garcia act the hell out of what are terrible roles on paper, but, employing the Leslie Nielsen-in-Airplane role, play them perfectly straight, which in the anarchy around them makes them sooo much funnier.)",2022-06-08,25,1,watch,False

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities. Directed by Wenn V. Deramas who pretty much pumps out films year after year of the same quality. To make everything clear, this is not a good movie but is enjoyable enough that its watchable at least. Vice Ganda who is funny in his Pinoy variety show ""Its Showtime"", is not as funny here, which I expected since the reason he's funny in his show is because its improv, but here it feels forced and plain corny. The thing about these movies that you know its bad but it has a sense that the people making it were just having the time of their lives. There are way more jokes that miss than hit but you can laugh at how bad a joke really is.Overall, This is regular pinoy fare that everyone gobbles up because 1.) its a comedy, 2.)

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities.

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities.

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities.

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities.

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities.

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities.

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities.

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities.

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities.

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities.

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities.

moviegrande,5,"Not to be confused by the Goldie Hawn movie, ""Praybeyt Benjamin"" (or the Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin) is a Filipino comedy starring one of the Philippines most famous personalities. Directed by Wenn V. Deramas who pretty much pumps out films year after year of the same quality. To make everything clear, this is not a good movie but is enjoyable enough that its watchable at least. Vice Ganda who is funny in his Pinoy variety show ""Its Showtime"", is not as funny here, which I expected since the reason he's funny in his show is because its improv, but here it feels forced and plain corny. The thing about these movies that you know its bad but it has a sense that the people making it were just having the time of their lives. There are way more jokes that miss than hit but you can laugh at how bad a joke really is.Overall, This is regular pinoy fare that everyone gobbles up because 1.) its a comedy, 2.) Its all good vibes, and 3.) Vice Ganda is in it.
