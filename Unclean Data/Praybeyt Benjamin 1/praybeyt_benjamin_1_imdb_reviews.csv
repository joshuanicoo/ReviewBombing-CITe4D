leianleian,"Dec 27, 2012",Waste of everything watching this movie.,"I never expect this movie to be good and one thing in mind, surely it is WORST. And wow! yes! yes! I did the right expectation on this movie.

There's no story at all its all time wasting moment,

i prefer to read the oldest newspaper than sitting in front of TV watching this crap.

But I cannot deny and I can't still imagine and can't still find the answer why this movie became the top grosser of all time.

Waste of everything watching this movie. Only kids can enjoy for those with have a very low humor.

I hope foreign people missed to see this garbage",1
sim-richmond,"Sep 29, 2012",Good Comedy Movie,"First of all, I would like to congratulate Star Cinema/ABS-CBN Film Productions and Viva Films for having Praybeyt Benjamin as one of the highest grossing Filipino film of all time.

The movie was quite hilarious and the storyline of having a gay soldier is a good idea, though not anymore unique. Nevertheless, what made it different from any other films with gay soldiers is that they mixed genres. They added a touch of science fiction (SciFi) and drama (Family Rivalry). And, thankfully, the romance they have put was only for the sake of comedy, and not being focused on the romance alone because if they did, it would appear mainstream which the Filipino taste is already burn of.

The camera rolling techniques that have been used was on average, and the CGIs appeared to be similar to that of old Filipino films (which I have to admit devastated me).

Heavy screen portrayal got no place in this kind of movie because it does not showcase heavy drama. However, I believe that some of the actors underacted making some scenes awkward and unnatural.

Overall, it reached 7/10.",7
