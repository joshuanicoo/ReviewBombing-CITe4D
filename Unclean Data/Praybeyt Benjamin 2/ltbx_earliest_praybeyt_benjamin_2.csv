rizzmoviejam,8,"MMFF 2014: (1/8)a nostalgic movie for me.nung bata ako bumili si mama ng CD and this is the movie, that time siguro alam niya na na gay ako and I want to watch this movie talaga, however, 'di ko sinasabi kasi magagalit sa akin yung papa ko, then I think 1st or 2nd week ng january, sabi ni mama may surprise daw siya sakin, then pinakita niya sakin yung CD ng movie na ito, grabe yung tuwa ko talaga that time just because of this movie.anyways, if I will review this movie, for me talagang mas maganda yung unang film, the story is interesting, isa talaga ito sa mg movie na nagsasabing gays are strong and resilient—nag-focus siya sa comedy pero if we look at it, sobrang daming pinagdaanan ni benjamin para patunayan ulit yung sarili niya, mas mabigat lang talaga yung naunang movie for me, and mas nakakatawa rin.the casttt, kaya gusto ko rin itong mapanood before kasi nandito si sir chief HAHAHA.",2025-12-09,0,0,watch,False

Ang gulo rin minsan ng transition. May mga eksena na biglang magiiba and walang context sa previous na eksena. Yung ending, bakit ganon. Ginawang video games yung paglalaban. Out of context din na naging just dance yung pagpigil ng pagsabog ng bomba. Wala masyadong character development. Narealized ni Benjie pagkakamali then okay na ulit lahat.
