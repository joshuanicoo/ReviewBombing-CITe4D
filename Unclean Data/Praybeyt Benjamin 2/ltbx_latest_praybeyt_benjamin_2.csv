davoarid,2,"Oof. I (surprisingly) really liked the first Praybeyt Benjamin movie, but this sequel is dire. My sense is that Vice Ganda was given more creative control this time around (since he had become a huge star between movies), and it's entirely to its detriment, as oh boy does Vice need someone who can rein him in. So instead of the original's narrow focus (on an incredibly horny gay guy who has to pretend to be straight to serve in the military), we get all the dumb Vice Ganda-isms (parodies, pop culture references, that incredibly annoying trend where Filipinos believe simply reciting dramatic speeches verbatim counts as comedy, etc). But even setting that aside, it fails as a comedy sequel just by changing the entire focus of the comedy. Praybeyt Benjamin is funny due to the clash between Ganda's bakla persona and the macho nature of the military. But then on this one the entire plot keeps Vice out of the military, and instead it does the comedy chestnut of ""person who is really bad at taking care of children has to take care of a child."" It's such a weird choice and it doesn't work at all. Also, this does Eddie Garcia so dirty....my man deserves so much better than this!",2022-06-29,7,0,watch,False

sinenini,3,oooo slay i guess … mm ok i watched this in cinemas when i was a kid and when i rewatched it with shobe today i forgot what it was actually about. somehow this was all repressed and i only remembered the zombie subplot 😭 i love direk but also parang nagdagdag lang ng mga “”funny”” celebrities or trendy? ones during this time in hopes of adding to the comedic value when they could have focused more on benjie’s squad dynamics bc they were rly so funny in the first film . as in yun pinakamemorable frfrfr . ngayon ko lang din napansin na jimmy santos was replaced here in his role as benjie’s tatay pala … idk why that makes me sad but it does for some reason (reason: nostalgia),2022-12-16,0,0,rewatch,False
