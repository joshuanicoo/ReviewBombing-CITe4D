marcelo___,6,"Quezon (2025) Watched Quezon in cinemas last week. It aims for epic, but somewhere between the dramatic speeches and historical gravitas, it loses its spark. Ambitious, yes, but the heavy-handed theatrics and slow pacing make it more exhausting than engaging. A decent attempt at history, but not one I’ll remember fondly.",2025-12-03,0,0,rewatch,True

nico_quejano,2,"A few weeks ago Cinemartys reminded all of us the massacre committed by Leonard Wood in Mindanao. But somehow, this movie humanized Leonard Wood. Making him charismatic and only wants to serve the people, at worst, a bureaucrat. But Leonard Wood was racist and an imperialist. His writings about the Philippines, depicting Filipinos as mostly backward and savages, were the reason why the US government did not give us independence immediately. And yet the movie not only gave credence to his racist tirades, it made it into facts. This is wrong in so many levels. I understand that we should unmask our heroes, but making the founding fathers as villains is a slippery and dangerous slope for a nation that easily forgets its own history. At a time that our sovereignity is in peril by outside and even inside forces, a movie questioning our genesis is a bit irresponsible. Not to mention the hypocrisy of a rousing speech against patronage politics then thanking the sister of the sitting president and the daughter of the dictator in the end credits. Admittedly, Quezon is a much better film than Goyo, but it's irrelevant at this point. [Glorietta]",2025-10-19,4,0,watch,False

yvreim,8,"i had a chance to watch their block screening on the first day and got to see their amazing actors, mon confiado, benjamin alves, jake macapagal, ana abad santos, and therese malvar, thanks to national university.the concept of making a prequel about the people we call our national heroes is a smart and refreshing move in philippine cinema. the director shows them as normal people with strong political desires, which mirrors the never ending power game we still see today. from emilio aguinaldo to manuel quezon, all the way to the marcos-duterte tandem, i must say they follow the same pattern. we treat these men like mythical figures and grow up with a clean version of them. then the film shows them bargaining, manipulating, and protecting their own interests, and you realize the cycle never stopped. it feels heavy at first because you hope someone in that era stood as the clear hero, but the more the story unfolds, the more you see how power shaped all of them.what i love about this film is that i went inside the cinema thinking I would learn another honest story from our former presidents and understand why they are considered important figures in history, not just because they led the country but because of what they sacrificed during their time. but after watching it, i realized that both emilio aguinaldo and manuel quezon, despite the rivalry and the clear protagonist antagonist framing, never truly cared about the filipino people and were both playing dirty.quezon is a great communicator and strategist. these helped him rise from being a lawyer to becoming the second president of the philippines. we grow up hearing his name and thinking of one of the best presidents we ever had. in the film, all he talks about is independence, but I never actually saw the real reason behind it. was he doing it for the country, for the people, or to validate his own hard work and protect his power and money.it took me almost two months to write this review because the film stayed in my mind longer than i expected. every time I tried to sit down, i ended up thinking about another scene or another line that hinted at something deeper. it’s not the kind of film you watch and forget the next day. it leaves you with questions that don’t settle right away.i kept replaying how the characters moved and how their decisions shaped everything. the more i revisited it in my head, the more i understood why it bothered me in a good way. it challenges the way we grew up seeing these men. it makes you look past the titles and medals and ask who they were when the doors were closed.",2025-10-15,0,0,watch,True

crow_355,10,"I’m a Filipino student and we were given a activity, a small film critique for my social studies class worth 20 points for the seatwork and quiz. Ironic enough, this was announced 6 days after I watched the film.When you hear the name Manuel Quezon, what comes to mind is that he was the 2nd most beloved President of the Philippines. A man who fought cases against the poor before as a lawyer, and was able to serve our country, But after watching the film I realized there was a lot more about him. I realized that Quezon wasn’t really much of a good President for his achievements. He is not really effective as a leader or able to accomplish anything for the country. But instead taking the government’s power by maneuvering to get what he wants and to establish what once was a blissful tree to a rotten egg. He was a master of playing dirty tricks to bribe the people creating conflict against his rivals causing them to get in the way of propaganda like Osmena, General Wood, and Aguinaldo. Involving the press questioning their political views on both perspectives. Another thing I noticed is that the Americans were actually trying to help the Filipinos as General Wood realized the people didn’t have proper education just from not knowing what independence means. They were helping us to establish better roads and build a proper government system for our country.The biopic not only showcases Quezon’s rise and downfall but alongside how our government is still the same until now. “I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos, rather than a country run like heaven by the Americans, because no matter how bad the Filipino government might be, it can still be improved!” To quote Manuel L. Quezon himself, sums up how our government will always run like hell unlike the Americans even though they were also cruel back then. Our independence may never be claimed, but our pride and soul can not be taken for granted. The Filipino government we have today is still running like hell from our corruption, political dynasties, and both parties fighting left and right while the poor are fighting by themselves. No matter how many people vote for a good president, we will always end up in last place as poverty devours us whole. After watching Quezon’s biopic, I realized how important education is for us and our love for everything we have in this country. What I can use from what I learned in this film as a citizen is by being civilly determined and persevering when it is already my duty to vote for the leaders of this country. That I should be a responsible voter in the future by knowing who to vote for and understanding what this stands for. Other factors that I realized to consider are self-dignity and moral values are important to look for in a leader. Patriotism can be as simple as exercising your right to vote and to vote wisely. In conclusion, despite Manuel Quezon’s search for independence and freedom for the Philippines he was unsuccessful. I say that because up to this day, our political system is naive and independence is something we have been fighting for up till this day. Independence not only from other countries colonizing us, but independence from corruption, political agendas, poverty, miseducation and political dynasties.I LOVE THE FILM SO MUCH. I’m a very big history nerd especially Philippine History so 100% recommended to any historian fan out there. Jericho Rosales and Jerold Tarog (big fan to both of them) did another phenomenal project for not only themselves but to every Filipino. Congratulations! At Maraming Salamat for making this film come true!",2025-11-01,0,0,watch,True

jolsf,8,"After 𝘏𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘭 𝘓𝘶𝘯𝘢 and 𝘎𝘰𝘺𝘰: 𝘈𝘯𝘨 𝘉𝘢𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘨 𝘏𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘭, TBA Studios and director Jerrold Tarog closes the BayaniVerse trilogy with '𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘇𝗼𝗻' — a film that trades the sound of gunfire for the noise of politics, but still burns with the same intensity.It’s not a war of soldiers this time, but a war of ideals, egos, and ambitions — fought in meetings, elections, and through the public eye.Jericho Rosales gives a career-defining performance as Manuel L. Quezon. You can tell he studied Quezon’s mannerisms down to the smallest gesture — the posture, the pauses, even the rhythm of his voice. His portrayal balances elegance with cunning charm, showing us both the gentleman, the strategist, the patriot, and the politician.The film’s structure is bold and stylish — divided into four chapters, each framed like a “V” (versus) battle, pitting Quezon against different political and historical figures of his time, accompanied by a subtitle based on dialogues in each chapter. It feels very Snyder Cut in its presentation — grand, deliberate, and unapologetically significant. The fourth chapter, the longest one, brings everything to a dramatic and climactic close that feels inevitable and tragic.Mon Confiado returns as Emilio Aguinaldo, and once again, he commands attention. His portrayal of a president haunted by legacy and resentment is one of his best performances yet. His dialogues, essentially saying that he did everything he could for the Filipinos, echo with pride and regret.It’s still surreal to see Game of Thrones veteran Iain Glen as Governor-General Leonard Wood, but even in his few minutes onscreen, he leaves a strong impression with his performance. Romnick Sarmenta also deserves praise for his controlled and weighty take on Sergio Osmeña, grounding every scene he’s in.The film cleverly incorporates black-and-white silent film sequences, serving as historical vignettes and mirrors of Quezon’s inner world. They show us the contrast between the public image and private intentions. Even more playful are Benjamin Alves and Aaron Villaflor playing not only as the younger versions of Quezon and Joven Hernando in flashbacks but also as actors in those silent films.Karylle shines as Aurora Quezon, bringing class, grace, and quiet strength to her role as a partner who understands the weight of her husband’s ambition. Meanwhile, Joross Gamboa may be new to the BayaniVerse, stepping into the role of the recast Eduardo Rusca. But he still feels right at home in this trilogy, proving his versatility in dramatic territory.'𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘇𝗼𝗻' is, without a doubt, the most political film in the trilogy. While its predecessors dealt with wars and heroism through action and tragedy, this movie unfolds during the Commonwealth election era, where battles are fought through speeches, alliances, and betrayals. Tarog turns politics into theater, and every act has consequences.If I were to rank all three BayaniVerse films:🥇Heneral Luna🥈Quezon🥉Goyo: Ang Batang HeneralAnd yeah, this movie may have lacked action compared to its predecessors, and some might find the pacing slow or the dialogue too heavy-structured, but that’s where its strength also lies. The movie challenges us to listen, read between the lines, and confront the truth that leadership often lives in the grey area between heroism and hypocrisy.What makes this linger isn’t a rousing battle cry, but a haunting reflection: 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘸𝘦 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘴 𝘢 𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯, 𝘰𝘳 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘸𝘦 𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘱𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘳 — 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘯𝘦𝘸𝘦𝘳 𝘧𝘢𝘤𝘦𝘴?Still, '𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘇𝗼𝗻' stands tall as a worthy conclusion to the BayaniVerse, both grand in scope, rich in detail, and haunting in its honesty about power and nationhood. And yes, stay for the end-credit scene — whether it truly closes the saga or hints at something beyond, it’s the vague ending that leaves you proud, curious, and reflective all at once.In the end, Tarog doesn’t just tell us who Manuel L. Quezon was — he shows us the kind of leader widely regarded as one of the most significant figures in Philippine history.With that being said, I’m going to give this movie…8/10! ⭐️ (Woooo!)",2025-10-19,1,0,watch,True

syncyore,8,"Hell week is over, so I can finally write my recent movie reviews. Let's start with the movie I watched in the cinema this November: Quezon (2025)At first, I had no idea kung paano ang takbo ng kwento, but I've heard and we tackled it with one of our lesson sa ArtApp where we talked about the Art and Society, Art and Politics. Since then, I was curious about how the movie portrayed Quezon, and how his administration affected the Philippines. I'm glad to have a chance to see it in the theater, it was a different experience. This will be long as I did my research a while ago after watching it kasi as someone who is not that literate with the politics, it can be confusing. Pero, it gave me an opportunity to look at the history myself. Quezon Vs. OsmeñaDuring his time, hindi lang Americans ang kalaban ni Quezon. May mga kapwa Pilipino siya na may ibang idea para sa bansa. Hindi na kalaban from outside, but someone beside him. Quezon and Osmeña were both brilliant, but their visions didn’t always match. Their rivalry wasn’t about hatred. It was about direction. Who can lead the nation better? Which path will bring Filipinos closer to independence? Historically, after passing the Jones Law, Quezon became Senate President, pero kasama niya noon si Sergio Osmeña bilang Speaker of the House. May ideology clash sa pagitan nila. Osmeña was more open to gradual transition, maybe compromises. Pero si Quezon gusto ng mas klarong direksyon sa independence. Dumating yung time na naglatag ng Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act, batas na may planong bigyan ang Pilipinas ng independence pero may mga kondisyon tulad nung retention ng US military bases. Si Osmeña sumuporta, pero si Quezon tumutol, gusto niya tunay na kalayaan. Pinamunuan niya yung campaign para i-reject ang HHC at gumawa ng mas maayos na plano. This eventually led to the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934, which set up a 10-year transition period toward independence. Nagkaayos sila para sa 1935 election: Quezon bilang President, Osmeña Vice-President. Nanalo sila at nagsimula ang Commonwealth.It is a fact na nag-advance ang pilipinas during his term pero some elites benefited more than the common people, so the effects weren’t evenly felt. Basically, Quezon’s leadership advanced the country on paper and at the top levels, pero hindi lahat nakaramdam ng pagbabago sa araw-araw nilang buhay.Quezon Vs. WoodThere's this Wood’s mission sa Pilipinas, na tinawag na Wood–Forbes Mission, sent by the U.S. para i-assess kung ready na ba ang bansa for independence. Sila ni Forbes literally inikot ang halos lahat ng provinces, tiningnan yung governance, economy, education, at social conditions. Ang conclusion nila? Marami pang Pilipino hindi pa ready mag-govern on their own.At sa totoo lang, hindi sila totally mali. Marami sa mga pilipino noon lalo na ang mga pilipinong walang access sa edukasyon na hindi talaga alam kung ano ang ibig sabihin ng kalayaan. May scene doon sa movie inikot ni Wood yung mga baryo at tinanong ang mga tao tungkol sa freedom, may isang farmer na sumagot, “Masarap,” kasi akala niya ang kalayaan ay pagkain lang. It is sad but it's true na ang mga tao ay madalas na focus sa araw-araw nilang buhay, lalo na kung paano makakapag-hain ng pagkain sa kanilang hapag-kainan (wow, lalim). Kaya natural na naging skeptical si Wood sa kakayahan ng mga Pilipino na mag-govern.Kahit sa mga elite, may problema rin. Maraming local leaders yung mas interesado sa sariling kapangyarihan at personal gain na kaysa sa long-term good ng bansa. Madali silang magpadala sa opportunism, kaya minsan hindi sila sumusuporta sa reforms. Dahil don, kahit nakapagtayo si Quezon ng institutions at frameworks, hindi pantay yung epekto sa ordinaryong tao katulad ng mga magsasaka, mas nakinabang ang mga elite, habang karamihan ng masa stuck sa poverty, limitadong edukasyon, at lupa.Quezon Vs. AguinaldoThis part builds the tension gradually. I LOVEEE ITTT! The soundtrack, the camera work, everything! Makikita doon sa 1935 presidential campaign ni Aguinaldo. Kasama niya yung supposed VP niya, pero compared sa massive support ni Quezon, maliit lang yung entourage. Low-budget, few supporters, at sa maliit na pagtitipon lang, Di katulad kay Quezon, nasa sasakyan, maraming supporters, parang festival. Sa isang scene, pinapaalis siya sa lugar (hindi ko matandaan kung saan), tapos sinabi niya na hindi na siya babalik. Eto parang dramatization nalang, pero historical fact na natalo talaga siya ng malaki kasi Quezon got around 68% ng vote, habang Aguinaldo less than 20%. It's a matter of nationalism vs. new governance ni quezon.""Wala kayong utang na loob.""Controversial si Aguinaldo dahil sa mga paratang na involved siya sa deaths ni Andrés Bonifacio at Antonio Luna. After Tejeros Convention noong 1897, na-execute si Bonifacio at yung kapatid niya. Maraming sources ang nagsasabi na in-approve ni Aguinaldo yung order, sabi niya “for the sake of the country.” Later, si Luna naman na-lure sa meeting sa Cabanatuan at pinatay; may mga historians na tinutukoy yung telegram ni Aguinaldo bilang evidence na posibleng siya ang nag-orchestrate. Hindi lahat malinaw, pero malinaw na messy ang Filipino politics noon, halo-halo ang power, loyalty, at personal ambition.Aguinaldo could have humiliated Quezon by bringing up personal matters, pero hindi niya ginawa. Quezon won, became first president of the Commonwealth, and set up the all-Filipino cabinet. He tried reforms like the Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933, pero marami ang nagsasabi na hindi daw ito effective kasi controlled pa rin ng landlords ang local politics, kaya maraming peasants ang naiwan sa kahirapan.Quezon Vs. JovenFictional siya, I know. Pero, joven served as the eyes ng audience. Sa simula, nung nakita niya si Quezon sa boat, hopeful pa siya, baka this person is really the way to change. Simple pa yung pananaw niya noon, hero si Quezon, clear ang moral compass, he's a good person.Pero habang lumalalim yung kwento, habang mas nalalaman niya yung political struggles, nagbabago rin yung tingin niya. Nakikita niya yung tension kay Osmeña, kay Aguinaldo, pati sa mga pilipino. Kapag titignan mo, mas naiintindihan mo yung history, hindi na pure heroes and villains ang nakikita mo. People have their own agendas, limits, at minsan kailangan gumawa ng “dirty work” para maabot yung goals nila.Nakikita rin natin kung paano yung utang na loob, loyalty, at personal connections gumagawa ng ripple effects sa buong political system, at paano siya nakakaapekto sa mga ordinaryong pilipino.Overall, through technical, I love the cinematography, yung color theory na ginamit nila, yung soundtrack and everything.

We share his naivete in ""Heneral Luna"", his awakening in ""Goyo"", and finally his hypocrisy in ""Quezon"".The character of Joven stands in as the Filipino people, whose principles waver at the sight of precious opportunity and promise. Joven has never fully let go of his tendency to idolize the man behind the power, his attachment to such figures taught him less to be wary of following their footsteps and taught him more of their machinations and how he could benefit from it all, only to be ultimately discarded after falling victim to the schemes of the ""hero"" he betrayed his principles for.Like Joven, we are complicit in the ills of our country by our own inaction and tolerance. It is much worse of a sin that we choose to close our eyes even if we have already seen the truth. We have the resources, the history, and the privilege of correcting our mistakes but why do we remain stubborn? We realize our own hypocrisy only when inconvenience has caught up to us.",2025-11-25,0,0,watch,False

hanniluvr,,"i watched this a long time ago but i’m only reviewing it now because i have been trying to gather my very conflicting thoughts on it… alas, i still have not finished doing that but this review is long overdue.i think it’s an enjoyable movie but there were some times where the film—i’m not sure whether intentionally ur unintentionally—romanticizes certain figures that shouldn’t be romanticized at all, and in turn the audience for this film did exactly that. ironically, at the same time this film also tried to paint the figures in a bad light, and that’s exactly where the lines start to blur to the point you don’t know what the movie is trying to say anymore.i know this comes off as “that one friend who’s too woke”, but this is the best i can articulate my icky feelings toward this movie right now. in general, i do not think it had a good impact—it had a good concept, but ultimately i do not think it delivered a point at all.this review shares my sentiments quite well.",2025-11-22,1,0,watch,False
bobfreking,8,"I get why the Quezon family might not love this.But honestly, that’s exactly what Gerald Tarog has been building toward since Heneral Luna and Goyo. The trilogy isn’t just about flawed heroes; it’s about a nation that has never been fully ready. Heroes rise because the people, the institutions, the country aren’t prepared to carry themselves. And Quezon leans into that idea.The film asks: What does independence even mean when you’re young as a nation and surrounded by bigger geopolitical forces? Here, politics is spectacle. Everyone is performing, maneuvering, managing appearances. It’s less “be angry” like Luna, and less “blind obedience” like Goyo. It simply shows you that everyone—from local elites to foreign powers—is taking us for a ride. And Quezon, in this telling, becomes a product of that pressure. Not a saint, not a villain—just someone doing what the moment required.What fascinated me was how consistent Aguinaldo is across all three films. You didn’t like him before, but here you can finally sympathize. The cast is strong, and the historical texture is rich.My issues are mostly structural. Since this is a biographical piece, the core tension is softer—alam mo na where it ends, alam mo na he becomes a hero, alam mo na we get independence. So the pacing won’t land for everyone. Luna worked because it tapped into a collective anger at a very specific time. Here, the emotional punch is more muted, more contemplative. I get why Tarog didn’t turn this into an activist film per se, but that choice also holds the film back from being as explosive as the first.Still, as a trilogy capstone, it’s thoughtful and well-acted. I admire the ambition, even if this one didn’t hit me as hard as the earlier entries.",2025-11-22,0,0,watch,False

ysmaelbp,8,"While Heneral Luna showed the good and the bad of public service, Quezon showed the good and the bad of politics. It prioritized storytelling than historical accuracy, and there are a few times that that bias didn't work, specifically with their portrayal of Aguinaldo. It prioritized dialog over cinematography, and weirdly enough is as witty as Heneral Luna but without the stunning establishing shots. While it is not a 100% historically accurate movie, I highly recommend this film to those who think Manuel Luis Quezon is just the ""Father of the Filipino Language"", as its overall portrayal of him is a flawed politician that had the independence as his goal, but wants to save the Philippines on his own selfish terms.",2025-11-22,0,0,watch,True

As for historical accuracy, would probably need to read up on it again.Firstly, my fav thing about this one was camera work. Props to Pong Ignacio for the brilliant shots (apparently he also worked for the director's other Bayaniverse films which is interestinggg). Secondly, the cinematography (still Ignacio) mmmm chef's kiss. Noticed this especially in wide shots and during the parallel campaign scenes between Aguinaldo and Quezon, where the color grading for Quezon's POV was bright and colorful while Aguinaldo's POV turned into this vintage dull tone that contrasted both of their character progressions/regressions.As a fan of arthouse films, where the direction of the storyline isn't really straightforward, absolutely loved the experimental storytelling which switches back and forth between Joven, Rusca, and Nadia watching the ""films"" as a narration guide then back to the actual events that happen. Found that very compelling. A scene I found rly funny (probs one of my favorites) was when Quezon and Joven bantered about Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Philosophy, and Ethics plsss (bc I get it help).Another fav abt the film was the score, especially in particular the one when Aguinaldo stood and walked towards the stage to give his speech during the 1935 elections scene, should've had a longer exposure hhhhTo summarize, I love how this depiction on one of the most notable ""National Heroes"" of the country serves as a critique to the twisted side of the road to the nation's independence and political power plays at the time that led up to world war ii. While there were a few things that irked me (won't spoil), loved Tarog's vision on this.(Also, Iain Glen aka Jorah Mormont in GOT and Batman in DC's Titans was here.

Wow. It was so loud at some portions and so hard to hear in some. Before we went in, we overheard an older gentleman say that the sound was too loud, and I chalked it up to maybe he’s older that’s why. BUT HE WAS NOT WRONG. I hated the mixing, truly. It caused my rating to go down a full star and a half. The non-linear story telling would have worked for me, had it not been the “silent film” within the film treatement. It was more annoying to watch, than it was amusing.

vanburg_,7,"Quezon is ambitious, centered on the dramatic rise and political maneuverings of Manuel L. Quezon, bringing into focus both his leadership and the moral complexities that come with power. Directed by Jerrold Tarog and starring Jericho Rosales, the film shows serious craft—period details, strong performances, and a desire to tell a sweeping national story. That said, while the intent is noble and the scale impressive, the film sometimes feels uneven—its pacing can feel heavy with exposition, and certain character arcs or motivations don’t always land with the emotional clarity you'd hope for. It’s a solid historical drama, but it doesn’t always transcend its genre in all moments.",2025-11-11,0,0,watch,True

godoffilm,6,"At its core, I found that the movie reflected my frustration in both the spectacle of political power plays, and the intellectual, moral decay of those who now hold the reins of government. Contemporary politicians—our so-called trapos—-have devolved into near-cartoonish figures: one-dimensional villains who plunder public funds, inherit their influence, and contribute little to the nation beyond perpetuating their dynastic entitlement. In comparison to Quezon, whose brilliance was matched by his ambition and corruption in equal measure, today’s leaders lack both vision and complexity. For all his duplicity, Quezon established systems that tangibly benefitted the poor in some ways, and he did grant us some period of independence (though that’s still debated). One cannot form a fixed opinion of him, for his legacy is both admirable and reprehensible. In this regard, Quezon (2025) mirrors its subject: difficult to pin down, simultaneously compelling and shallow. The film dramatizes power and corruption effectively, and inevitably tugs at the viewer’s frustration given the state of current politics. Yet it often flattens the historical depth of Quezon’s time, reducing the struggle for independence and the weight of colonial subjugation into a tale of political maneuvering. The controversy surrounding Quezon’s grandson’s reaction at the film’s premiere only reinforces the persistence of the Great Man myth, the impulse to sanctify flawed figures rather than confront their contradictions. While the Bayaniverse in general deconstructs this narrative, I think Quezon (2025) only partially succeeds. What emerges instead is a reflection of both the man and the nation: brilliant in flashes, compromised in execution, and perpetually caught between reverence and disillusionment.",2025-11-11,0,0,watch,False

For me, Quezon isn’t “bayani enough” to close this trilogy; he’s more like the start of what could be a pangulo-verse.Quezon is a master player in politics. The appointment game scene is one of my favorites because it shows how Quezon skillfully maneuvers people and the government itself. His ambition, driven by greed and power, is disturbing, yet Jericho Rosales portrayed it so convincingly that I couldn’t look away! ampogi. Quezon is selfish and trapo, and that’s what makes him believable. He mirrors the very kind of politics we see today, shifting how leadership and power are perceived in our system.I also liked how Joven became aware of what was really happening. He refused to be swayed again and stood firm in what he believed in. The two-hour film gave justice to how this trilogy ends. My favorite part is when Quezon said that being a hero is all about perception.

kaiser_indat,10,"10/10 = MASTERPIECE I didn’t expect this film to affect me the way it did. I thought I was ready, that it would simply be another historical piece about a man I’ve always admired. Instead, it left me still and uncertain, as if it reached into what I believed and rearranged it. It has been a long time since a film made me feel this kind of quiet turmoil.I have always seen Quezon as one of the strongest figures in our history. I saw him as a leader who carried both intellect and heart, a man who stood for what the Filipino could be. Watching this version of him felt painful. The film showed a Quezon who was cold, distant, even cruel at times. I disagreed with it deeply. Yet I could not turn away. It felt honest in its discomfort, as if the film was reminding me that greatness is never pure and that power often leaves scars no one else can see.I kept trying to defend him in my mind, to separate the man from the portrayal, but I realized that was the experience the film wanted me to have. It wanted me to struggle with the idea of Quezon himself. It wanted me to feel both admiration and doubt. That inner tension became the most human thing about the entire experience.When the credits rolled, I just sat there. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even think clearly. It reminded me how rare it is for a film to make me pause, to make me reflect not just on history but on the kind of leaders and ideals I believe in. It left me unsettled, but it also left me grateful.I still believe in Manuel Luis Quezon. I still see him as one of our greatest. Yet this film made me look at him again with clearer eyes. It made me realize that true admiration accepts flaws, questions myths, and still chooses to understand. That realization is what stays with me.Quezon (2025) gave me confusion, pain, and awe all at once. It made me think harder about pride, power, and the weight of building a nation. It is not an easy film to love, but it is a necessary one. And for me, that makes it a masterpiece.All the discomfort, all the challenge, all the awe I felt comes together in one simple truth. The film made me feel something that reminded me why I love history, leadership, politics, and philosophy.",2025-11-10,1,0,watch,True

Ang mga salita, galaw, at taktika ng mga nasa kapangyarihan ay paulit-ulit, predictably corrupt, at puro palabas lang.Ika nga nila, ""Ang magulong bayan ay salamin ng magulong politika."" Hanggang ngayon, hindi naglalaho at patuloy pa rin na umiikot sa ating realidad. Sa palabas na ito, ipinakita kung gaano kadumi ang politika: nakakasuka, nakakagalit, nakakatakot. Pero alam naman nating lahat, it’s just the tip of the iceberg. Mas nakakatakot pa, dahil hanggang ngayon, wala pa ring tunay na pagbabago, at wala pa ring nakukulong. Ang ganda rin ng portrayal ng mga journalist — ipinakita kung paano sila naging mata’t tainga ng bayan. Nakakalungkot lang isipin na may ilan sa panahon ngayon na nagpapadala sa impluwensya, nagpapabayad, o nagpapagamit. Pero naniniwala akong mas marami pa ring tulad ni Joven — mga taong marunong magbago ng paniniwala para sa mas mabuti, marunong mamulat, at may tapang tumindig sa katotohanan. Bukod sa journalists, binigyan din ng pansin ang mga filmmakers. Ang pelikula ni Nadia ay simbolo kung paano naaapektuhan ang opinyon ng publiko sa bisa ng mahusay na kwento. Madaling maimpluwensiyahan ng propaganda, political ads, o social media narratives.Sa trilogy, masasabi kong ito ang paborito ko. May halong sarcasm pero masaya ang paraan ng pagkukwento. Isa sa pinakanagustuhan ko ang campaign scene — maliwanag at parang pista, pero sa kabila, naroon ang lungkot at muted na kulay, na parang isang funeral.Sa huli, napanood natin ang sinasabi ni Quezon na ""hindi natin mapanonood"" — parang ang tingin niya, habang buhay ay matatago ang baho ng pabango. Marami sa mga politiko ngayon ay ganoon din: puno ng palabas, sakim sa kapangyarihan, at bulag sa pangangailangan ng bayan. Para sa akin, hakbang na ito para mas mamulat at lumawak ang pananaw ng mga Pilipino. Nakakatuwa dahil hindi lang siya pangalan sa history books; nabigyan siya ng boses, ng puso, at ng karakter. Ang pelikulang ito ay magsisilbi bilang paalala ng paulit-ulit na dumi at kasinungalingan. Pero sa huli, nananatili ang katotohanan sa mata ng mga nakasubaybay at mulat.",2025-10-15,0,0,watch,True

leviereviews,6,"the good:- i like na hindi nila binigyan masyado ng nuance si quezon dito. all throughout he’s just this cunning and ruthless asshole who happens to be the president and a senate president before that. we’ve seen countless pieces of media na pinapakita mabubuti niyang ginawa at niroromanticize buhay niya so it was very refreshing to see jericho’s version of quezon na masama ugali all throughout yet he never came across as shallow and one note. no art is meant to be isolated in vacuum so by placing it with another like the quezon movie prior to this gives you a fuller picture of who quezon is, even when theyre not entirely accurate.- was taken aback by how playful and satirical the movie’s tone was considering that it’s supposed to conclude the bayaniverse trilogy. galing. fave ko yung silent movie scenes grabe kuhang kuha yung blocking acting score at makeup! also works really well as a narrative device and cleverly points out how ridiculous quezon can be. - gusto ko yung movement ng camera it really made the movie entertaining- fave line: hindi ako kulangot wag mo kong binibilog!the bad and the ugly: - why remove the sakdalistas? gets na this is a movie about larger than life historical figures but the sakdalistas were popular enough to win a seat in the congress so bakit wala sila sa movie? the whole movie is structured around who quezon is going up against at different points in his political career so it would’ve been the perfect opportunity to explore the perspective of the masses and could have made the ending/message stronger but ok whatever. including the sakdalistas in the story could’ve shown a different side of quezon—one that was insecure enough to actually sabotage figures who are way less powerful than him even when he was already the commonwealth president- why portray filipinos as ignorant/unlearned when it comes to independence? that was the only time na may representation ang ordinaryong pilipino na nagsisilbi ring stand in for the audience tapos in that scene they chose to depict filipinos as mangmang na hindi alam kung ano pinaglalaban nila e kung tutuusin sila na nga yung nakarealize early on that independence should be achieved immediately hindi katulad ng filipino elite noon na kumapit pa rin sa colonial forces and chose delayed independence because they didnt wanna lose their privileges yet - not enough hate for the other key players. not enough hate for aguinaldo (but its okay bc we have luna movie and goyo movie to compensate for the lack of aguinaldo hate) but what bothers me the most is that there’s not enough hate for wood. leonard wood is depicted as this diplomatic and level headed guy who just wants to do his job so he can go home even though historical accounts say otherwise because he’s anti filipino, and orchestrated the massacre in bud dajo, etc. at the end of the day, mananakop siya na ang tingin sa mga pilipino ay mangmang na kailangan ng colonial intervention. ang mga amerikano din naman ang naginstitutionalize ng padrino system and the filipino elite just took advantage of it so why are they making it seem that quezon was the one who established such system? the issue isn’t about the movie omitting or adding events for creative purposes (it's a movie after all), the problem lies with the larger picture it ends up painting by taking those liberties and to me it just reeks american propaganda and i dont think the movie is aware of that. i know this is about quezon, i know this is a satire, pero kailangan ba si quezon lang yung ivivillainize/satirize? pagvillainize kay quezon gusto pagvillainize sa mga kano ayaw? eme- ewan andami ko ring issues pa like di convincing for me yung relationship ni joven at quezon and yung eventual split nila, yung over sa exposition na dialogue tipong subtext nawawala kasi lahat laid out na for you through dialogue, etc.",2025-11-05,0,0,rewatch,True

kontradiksiyon,7,"Ang panonood ng ""Quezon"" ay parehong pakiramdam ng pakikinig sa isang kakilalang naglalarawan sa isang taong nakadaumpalad mo na, ngunit hindi pa lubos na nakikilala. Kaya matapos makinig sa mga kuwento, may responsibilidad na kilalanin pa nang husto ang taong iyon sa kung anumang layuning mahalaga para sa iyo.Ang panganib lang dito ay kung paano tatanggapin ng nakinig: maniniwala agad-agad o aalamin muna ang kabuuang konteksto.Sa Araling Panlipunan/Sibika, limitado ang pagpapakilala kay Quezon. Kaya kung gagamitin itong pangunahing materyal ng DepEd at literal na bibigyang-interpretasyon, mayroong tendensiyang matuon sa ""sensationalism"" ang talakayan.Ngunit gayundin, magandang ipinakita ang kabuuang karakterisasyon ni Quezon at kung paano siya naging biktima rin ng sistema ng politika sa panahon ng pananakop ng mga Amerikano. Gayunpaman, sa personal kong opinyon, nakulangan ako sa pagpapakita kung paano tinawid ni Quezon ang grey areas--sa pelikula, tumatawid lamang si Quezon sa itim o sa puti. Kung maipakikita sana ang bigat ng pagkaipit sa sistema at pagpili na lamang sa ""lesser evil"", mas naging balanse at nagkaroon ng dagdag na layers ang kaniyang tauhan.Nakakabahala rin ang idea na mula pa noon ay umiiral na ang parehong maruruming taktika sa politika. Na parang ang pelikula ay direktang salamin ng kasalukuyang lagay ng politika sa bansa.Super like: Pagganap ni Jericho at ang acting ensemble. Karakter ni Nadia.

pennandpapers,7,"Honestly before watching the film I got a bit skeptical, not because of the relative's reaction rather, of how his death is going to be depicted - as most stories of ""Bayani"" ends with an abrupt bullet or a machete to the body (about 50 times). I vividly remember reading that he once gave his SONA in a hospital bed in Washington DC because he was fighting TB. While he often had that shiny 20-peso bill image to him, reading books like Nick Joaquin's A Question of Heroes (which this film takes inspiration) suggests a more open to interpretation viewpoint of the politician-statesman. You can write a persuasive essay about it, honestly, and your highschool AP teacher would probably applaud you by choosing either depictions and look at the complexities of the human character and the political environment he had to deal with. Going back to the ending though, you can very much understand the backlash because it really leaned into the creative side of the narrative. But I kinda like it because its a fun thought to have; if MLQ didnt get sick, what would he have done more as his legacy? Depicted as the savvy, charming, trickster of a politician playing ""the game of politics"" and always trying to get the upper hand on people, I'd like to think that he would've been similar to how Lee Kuan Yew did for Singapore. Similar in character in a lot of ways and tickling his way to almost authoritarian (competitive authoritarianism, that is). At least with the way how the film depicted it. ""I am the Philippines"" is definitely a bold line to say, but probably not too far off. And the line about ""Quezon may not have invented the game, but he sure damn played it well"" describes the character perfectly.The film is actually the commentary of Jerold Tarog, the director. He questions Manolo's morality and character because that's how we all should look at historical figures. I remember when Luna came out, everyone was preaching his machismo, especially at the height of Dutertismo. But Tarog probably saw the bad effects of the film and tell us: ""Hey, don't worship our heroes."" Funny how the film mocks the audience for incorporating the silent film-slide show scenes at points, as if they're trying to tell you ""this is how most people probably would've made this film: prim, proper, textbook-like, 'here's all the key highlights of his life and the good he's done, and then he died."" Rather, they chose to depict that complex, imperfect, flawed character that I would've been more interested in watching. He's never meant to be seen as a martyr. He's a historical figure, a real person. Is it 100% accurate? I don't know, ask your history teacher. Was it fun to watch? Was the acting great? More importantly, was the film good? All points to: Yes. Yes it was. Last note: MLQ III is right. The film is a horror story about corruption of power, the state of politics today, and the trajectory of Philippine politics from that point on. Makes my arm hair stand up.",2025-11-08,0,0,watch,True

finalskilledme,8,"fascinating film. clear eyed on its mission on dissecting how we got here and how we're still stuck here but I don't really think it does enough to condemn the actual system (capitalism and colonialism) that allows for the rise of populists. What I got most from this is I think Tarog is frustrated by the success of Luna and how it led us even just a tiny bit to electing the kind of person he warns us with in this film (TWICE IN A ROW, this god forsaken country man) given how much the framing device of this is about an alternate cut of what are essentially propaganda films. I think these films are really about the disillusionment of a man may it be Joven or Tarog himself in the Filipino project while I think it's valid (and I do share the sentiment a lot of the time) I don't really know if it's the sentiment we need in this moment considering his ideals about reviving the idea of national mythmaking through Philippine cinema. I hope people take something else from here other than, oh all politicians are the same and it is what it is, I hope they at least realize that the powers that be are fallible (Quezon eventually runs out of time) and that we see through their bullshit and that populists are really fucking bad for ""freedom"" and that we should get rid of them by hook or by crook although the film doesn't really go there because history didn't go there. Overall it's fascinating stuff. Really loved how propulsive his direction and editing are, the energy of this thing is just really great.

_findrafa,8,"Possibly one of my most engaging watches this year. Instead of picking up from where Goyo and Heneral Luna left off, Quezon abandons the tragic hero's tale of its predecessors and instead explores, for lack of a better word, its titular character's descent into madness and depravity. It's less a biopic and more of a character study that relishes in the drama of its narrative without needing to wink and nudge at the viewer. There's a lot of standout performances here, but Iain Glen, Romnick Sarmiento, and Jericho Rosales really stand head and shoulders above the rest in a very talented cast. Glen and Sarmiento especially bring a lot to their characters' tables with microexpressions that elevate already stellar performances. Sarmiento's facial expressions by themselves are strong enough to constitute dialogue. Rosales, meanwhile, really puts the larger-than-life aspects of the titular character at the forefront of his performance and just exudes the kind of charisma you would expect a man like Quezon to have. As much as I would've liked to see what TJ Trinidad would've done with the role had he not been replaced, it's hard to see how anyone other than Rosales was the best choice.On top of that, the movie pulls very little back in the way of punches. Very few characters are portrayed in a positive manner and it's the clashes between these strong personalities that make this picture so interesting to me. The film also uses these clashes as a Trojan horse for some scathing social commentary that, while on-the-nose, hardly ever crosses the line of being egregious or preachy.The visual and stylistic homages to Fritz Lang's works, especially, were the cherry on top for me.

lorenmilton,9,"It’s been a big year for Philippine cinema, and what could make it even bigger than a film about politics and power? Quezon dives deep into Manuel L. Quezon — his legacy, his triumphs, and all his mess and contradictions. The film portrays him as charming and eloquent, a political game player, and manipulative at times — without ever romanticizing him. It’s insane how the political landscape back then mirrors so much of what we still see today. The film serves as a fascinating tribute to one of the country’s most dominant and complex figures.The cinematography and editing are stunning. It's an ambitious step forward for Philippine cinema and a huge achievement in craft. The script, dialogue, and even the incorporation of silent film techniques beautifully capture the era. The acting is top-notch. Jericho Rosales, Romnick Sarmenta, and Mon Confiado delivered powerful performances!Overall, Quezon offers a sharp, compelling glimpse into the man behind the myth while holding a mirror to our present-day politics. It’s timely, daring, and deeply resonant. People really need to see this. What a great film.",2025-11-07,0,0,watch,True
juls_via,8,"This film for me is such a refresher because unlike the previous films about MLQ, it challenges the pedestal that he has been put on, which I believe is essential when we discuss important figures in our history. I think a lot of us (myself included) often fall into the trap of patronizing our heroes to the point that we romanticize them through the legacies that they have built. This was very much true for me, specifically with Heneral Luna (Naalala ko grabe yung galit ko kay Aguinaldo nung una kong napanood yung Heneral Luna na movie hahaha).While some may see this film as overtly negative and borderline slanderous against MLQ, I see it as a way to challenge the longstanding beliefs and notions regarding him. It pushes people to rethink our history, to be more critical, and to ask questions about what really happened in the past.And of course, the biggest elephant of them all is the connection between the past and the present. This is not just a historical film; it is also a social commentary about the current political climate we have right now. We can make the analogy of how the things from the past never really changed up to the present day. It merely evolved, adapted, and thrived. It persisted because the people in power willed it so.Going back to the film, we can also see how the concept utang na loob played a big part in ultimately shaping MLQ’s politicking. How it was first used on him and eventually, how he used this to take the reigns of our country.“You either die young as a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”In essence, MLQ wouldn’t have survived that long in the landscape of Philippine politics had he not conformed to the games being played on the floors of its administration. His good intentions, as genuine as it might have been when he first started, nevertheless was inevitably consumed by the environment he was in. Truly, it was a world of “eat or be eaten”.",2025-11-03,0,0,watch,False

quark,,"We were supposed to do this at Amazon but what happened happened. Despite everything I’m lucky to have read three drafts of this and a treatment of what would have been its structure were it a series, and came in to the theater just to marvel at how Jerrold would pull this off. He pulled this off wonderfully, of course, with humor and aplomb. The script wasn’t as funny as it turned out to be on the screen, and kudos to Jerrold for seeing our government for the farce it is. Seeing Jericho play Quezon initially felt put on, but by the end you believe he’s the living, breathing embodiment of the 50 peso bill. Cris Villanueva puts some weight and character into the everpresent Joven. Jorah Mormont is a great Leonard Wood despite the accent. Karylle is always great and is missed on the big screen (follow her on Letterboxd). I really love Romnick as Roxas. And our dear beloved Mon Confiado, the survivor of the trilogy, plays Emilio Aguinaldo as the same person with the fire behind his eyes fully extinguished. It’s a painful portrayal, and will make you feel bad about all his shenanigans from the prior two films. End of the day I’m just grateful that during this time, what feels like such a low point for Philippine cinema, Jerrold continues to create his films about our flawed history, filled with stories of deluded strongmen, inexperienced boy generals and manipulative power players. He holds a mirror to our society that most people in power, heroes’ grandchildren included, don’t want to see. But when Leonard Wood talks about politicians using diplomatic trips as an excuse for family vacations and Filipinos not ready for independence with their infighting and greed, everything feels so eerily timely. Then you realize that’s the way it’s always been. Me: Question: matatapos na yung trilogy mo. After all is said and done is there an overarching message for the… bayaniverse?Jerrold: *shrugs* Aguinaldo outlived them all?There’s probably something in there.

aywrydri,7,"Unlike Heneral Luna and Goyo, Quezon did not show any form of physical violence; rather, it portrayed violence through the use of words. Storytelling-wise, it was quite okay for me, but I think there are a lot of areas that could be improved. As someone who doesn’t appreciate slow-paced movies, Quezon felt really boring to me at the beginning. Nadia’s role as a storyteller throughout the film also felt somewhat messy—but then again, it allows the audience to form their own opinions and perspectives on the narratives and realities she presented during Quezon’s term.In both Heneral Luna and Goyo, Joven served as a symbol of youth—the hopeful defender of our country’s future and independence. In Quezon, however, he symbolized how people might abandon their morals because of the selective facts presented to them—facts that politicians carefully curate for their own benefit. Joven still represented hope for the Philippines, because even though he strayed from the beliefs he once fought for, he eventually came to understand how manipulative and power-hungry politicians can be. This idea was further emphasized by Miguel Laureano’s retirement, which symbolized the shift in political climate and the changing perception of the masses.The movie reflected the bitter reality of our current political state—it mirrored how Filipinos tend to be selective about what kinds of change and movement they are willing to support. As we moved on from Quezon’s term, we should have experienced growth and improvement, yet we did not.

Of course I have to applaud the production and costume design! It’s excellent and if I remember my fashion history well, I think they did a good job at depicting the way Filipinos & especially Filipino women dressed back then. I also LOVE the format they chose to tell the story to stay true to the times, thru the silent films and then the 1920s-30s visual aesthetics. That aspect was so fun I love it so much!!!!!!! Anyway, it’s interesting to see how they portrayed Quezon because I vaguely remember how he was portrayed as a good President back in my elementary Philippine History lessons, how we briefly touched upon his “achievements”. But since they say that this depiction was backed by historians, public facts and documents then I think they really did a good job of humanizing him. He wasn’t just a shallow historical figure from the recent past anymore, we get to see his flaws & his motivations. This is great!Leaving the cinema just made me kinda depressed tbh because it just reminded me of my PI 100 class.

passivedre,8,"i remember quezon being one of the many names i had to memorize for some 4th grade exam alongside his contributions to the jones act and the tydings-mcduffie act. it was only until i became invested in historical movies that i decided to watch the bayaniverse, and it was in this trilogy where i started to look back and revisit my perspective on our national heroes. when we look at history, the act of calling someone a hero or a villain is very reductive, as it ignores the nuances of their decisions and their distinct worldviews and beliefs. the philippines is not exempt from this at all. in the context of the bayaniverse, these people (luna, goyo, quezon) are inept and egotistical at best, and downright criminal at worst, but put them in a movement, and you have the spirit of the filipino revolution, proud and waving the flag. and despite their flaws, that does not erase the efforts they've done for an independent republic.tarog, with quezon, aimed to showcase both his flaws and his accomplishments in a way that piques our interest and to go to our local library and read up on our history. we are directly anchored in through joven and his family, and through him, we get to interact with the true nature of quezon, one that, just as tarog intended, is not displayed in bullet text or powerpoint. he is a con man who thrives in confidence and does whatever is necessary, because to him, politics is a game of chess. he anticipates, he strategizes, and takes advantage of weakness. he is thrust into a system that benefits those in power, and considering his eagerness to satiate his thirst for power, he uses that system to gain complete control of his circle and of the country.its use of satire and the bravado of 1920s silent film aesthetic at certain points complements the big personality of quezon, immediately making it the most unique out of the trilogy, where the prior films were conventional war epics, rather showcasing the action of politics than the action of bloodshed, but it remains as violent and intense as the previous films, but what makes quezon stand out is that despite its lens (not borrowed from nepomuceno!), the situations facing the country remain significantly relevant. the constant trips costing filipino taxpayers millions? the fact that we have more politicians than public servants? infighting between two major political players? i forgot who said it, but they mentioned that quezon became the blueprint for modern day trapos, and i can see it! he possesses many of the traits that make up most of our senate, he's a cheat, a liar, and an opportunist! and that's what makes our national heroes so much more interesting. in one way or another, they are not faultless, nor are they necessarily bad people. despite all my shit talk on quezon, the one thing i'll give him credit for was his love for the country, his means justify the ends and he DELIVERS, at the cost of his morality and friendships.the chameleon will always fit in with anyone, but in the end, it will end up with no one, and that is the price one shall pay to become the chameleon.i got a good deal though, it was 13 dollars for one ticket? good shit",2025-11-04,1,0,watch,False

He’s always portrayed as this larger-than-life president who accomplished so much. And although his flaws are in the history books, they’re rarely emphasized in schools. This movie finally showed that side of him. Although they still showed his contributions for the Filipino people, it was overshadowed by the scheming, womanizing, manipulative traits, and that lowkey god complex side of him, at least with how he was depicted in the movie.He’s still undeniably a great president who did a lot for the country, but it’s good that we don’t over-romanticize or idolize political figures. I just wish they also covered his actions during his term and during the Japanese invasion. It would’ve made a stronger conclusion and could have highlighted more of his contributions.As a Quezonian, this movie slapped. It honestly validated all the shady things I’ve researched about him before for a contest about.... well, him.

nic_t_dlr,2,"I watched Quezon yesterday in the cinemas. The movie leans heavily on the negative aspects of Manuel L. Quezon’s character—some of which are based on conjecture and lack sufficient historical evidence to be accepted as truth. For example, there is a scene portraying voters booing Emilio Aguinaldo during his presidential campaign, supposedly orchestrated by Quezon. There is no record of this ever happening.The film presents an unbalanced portrayal of the Philippines’ first president, further complicated by a fictional subplot involving made-up characters: journalist Jevon Hernando and his filmmaker daughter, Nadia, who produce campaign videos for Quezon’s presidential run while secretly creating “more honest” versions of each one.I didn’t quite understand the purpose of this subplot, except perhaps to draw parallels with the current political climate. The campaign videos felt like an early version of a “troll farm.” In that sense, the film invites viewers to reflect on the prevalence of “fake news” and how even legitimate journalists can become complicit in the myth-making that surrounds political figures.The film puts forward the idea that “democracy” in the Philippines has never been the real deal because of problematic leaders such as Manuel Quezon, and that the system has always been broken from the start. I think it’s a motivating sentiment; however, the message becomes contrived when retroactively applying it to Quezon’s story.It presents what on the surface appears to be a compelling question: What does it mean when a historical film uses a 21st-century lens to moralize the past? However, I personally disagree with this treatment of history. I believe history should be explored as unfamiliar terrain—something distinct from our present time. Otherwise, how could we genuinely learn anything from it? Imposing a modern framework of social media–driven politics onto the past flattens historical complexity, especially when many Filipinos don’t have access to in-depth historical education or materials outside of school.The story—not just of Manuel Quezon’s life, but of all Filipinos involved in the journey toward Philippine independence, from the formation of the Senate and Congress to the election of the first president—could have offered an inspiring message. Instead, all of this is portrayed as nothing but a sham. The film minimizes the work that Filipino figures did to win our independence by focusing only on the unsavory details of Quezon’s life, such as his love-hate relationship with Osmeña and his ploy to get Governor-General Leonard Wood removed from office. One of the film’s early fictional chapters is titled Quezon vs. Hernando: A Noble Lie, in which Quezon and Hernando debate the concept of “noble lies” using a quote from Plato. Quezon “loses” the argument simply because Hernando can name-drop more philosophers. Many scenes like this follow, reducing Quezon to a caricature—an exaggeratedly naïve and shallow version of himself.Because our history is often told through the lens of our colonizers, mainly Americans, Filipinos have long had a weak sense of the value of freedom and independence. We have been taught to believe that we are not ready to govern ourselves—and perhaps never will be. The film includes Quezon’s famous line: “I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by the Americans.” In a more balanced portrayal, this line could have carried real gravitas. But given the film’s cynical treatment of Quezon, it instead becomes further evidence of his supposed incompetence.This film could have offered audiences a meaningful, alternative way to engage with our history. Instead, it mimicked the very dynamics of social media, reducing historical events into digestible, sensationalized drama. Audiences should ask questions while watching the movie, such as: Is there any genuine historical basis for the scene in which Manuel Quezon asks Vicente Madrigal for a blank check to fund his presidential campaign? What was the purpose of showing a completely fabricated conversation between a drunk Leonard Wood and Manuel Quezon?I also took issue with the portrayal of Emilio Aguinaldo as Quezon’s more “credible” rival. The movie pits Quezon and Aguinaldo against each other, going so far as to fabricate or misrepresent events to exaggerate their rivalry—such as showing Quezon canceling Aguinaldo’s pension during his run against him and framing the loss of Aguinaldo’s farm as a personal attack. Neither of these are based on fact. It is well-documented that Aguinaldo ordered the executions of Andres Bonifacio and Antonio Luna. These are not Quezon’s political inventions—they are part of the historical record. Yet the movie invents an entirely fictional subplot involving Pedro Janolino, who reaches out to Joven Hernando to reveal that Aguinaldo ordered him to kill General Antonio Luna. He is later revealed to be Quezon’s sergeant-at-arms who planted the testimony to sabotage Aguinaldo. In truth, there really was a Pedro Janolino, and he did kill General Luna. He died before Quezon ran for president, and it was Panteleon Garcia who later revealed that Aguinaldo ordered Luna’s murder.Unfortunately, I didn’t find the film well-executed overall. The acting was uneven, with the exception of Jericho Rosales (Quezon) and Mon Confiado (Aguinaldo). The fictional film-within-a-film subplot featured unlikable, underdeveloped characters, and the “silent movie” aesthetic came across as contrived rather than clever. The production design was also disappointing. The U.S. colonial period was a stylish era—this is evident from the films and photographs of the time—yet the costumes, especially for the women, lacked both elegance and authenticity.In the end, I couldn’t understand the film’s motive in diminishing Quezon’s legacy. It seemed told through a distinctly pro-American lens: the Filipino masses are depicted as naïve and gullible, unable to grasp what “independence” truly means, while figures like Sergio Osmeña and Manuel Roxas are reduced to mere sidekicks without agency or depth—an unfair portrayal of these important historical figures.Ultimately, the film misses an important opportunity. Instead of offering a richer understanding of our nation’s early struggles for independence, it relies on cynicism, convenient narratives, and present-day parallels that oversimplify history—a treatment that is both disrespectful to Quezon and his descendants and intellectually irresponsible. That half the movie’s plot rests on a fabricated premise should be a sign for audiences to approach it critically. Quezon’s story deserves a more nuanced, intelligent retelling—one that trusts its audience to think deeply, not one that panders to the fleeting attention span of social media.",2025-11-04,1,0,watch,False

caeljann,7,"I can see why people would criticize this film for not representing the historical figures for all the actions they've done no matter how good or bad. But pieces of art, which this film is (regardless of quality), are meant to tell a thematic story.For what it is, a film and not a documentary, it uses historical figures as symbols to tell a story of political games and showmanship. They are not who they were in history but are instead used as a backdrop for the inner workings of politics still prevalent to this day. The addition of Joven Hernando as a fictional character, other than being a narrative device, is a clear intention of the story being fictional, not historical, even if his existence being too fantastical at times.Yes, it can be dangerous to represent a historical event/s and handwave all inaccuracies as necessary for drama. You can even call this film straight up propaganda since it aims to tell a certain message with regards to politics, but it still functions as a piece of art. There is a risk of audiences viewing this dramatization as historical fact. A risk that no amount of ""fictionalized"" disclaimers can make people believe it to be otherwise.Do I believe this film shouldn't have been made for the lack of historical context it portrays? No. Without this film, I don't think a lot of Filipinos would know who Leonard Wood is. It ignites interests about the historical figures and leads people to seek out the facts themselves. Not a lot of people, me included, were aware of all the shit Wood did as Governor-General prior to this film.I didn't rate this film 3.5/5 for its accuracy, but instead for its pacing and tendency to read between the lines for you.

legendaryl06,7,"The two sides of the same coin. The admired and the flawed. The good old fashioned politician and the staunch patriot.""QUEZON"" isn't particularly the film that one may expect from writer-director Jerrold Tarog's ""Bayaniverse"". The titular hero isn't glorified but examined - with all his strengths and imperfections. History, as rich as it gets, immortalizes the gripping and controversial facets of the beloved statesman that unsurprisingly still echo up to this day.Exceptionally played by Urian winner Jericho Rosales, we get to see the might, influence, charisma, narcissism, lies, and betrayals of Philippines' second president through his acting force and vulnerability. The penchant to roll the classic 4:3 movie aspect ratio in its short films and the interesting camera pans during the Congress election strategies a la chess moves are some of its strong suits. Art and production designs, although a good addition, can be improved to perfectly embody its era. Bearing its creative license, it dramatizes the calculated games and internal conflicts through (at times confusing) non-linear storytelling with hefty dialogues and politicking narratives that can be cut down in exchange for more warranted depictions of political effects to the society under the eight-year regime, apart from showcasing people's ignorance of the very notion of independence. Now that would be more compelling and cathartic. Rosales truly leads the pack but it's indubitable that every featured artist (Romnick Sarmenta, Mon Confiado, Cris Villanueva, Benjamin Alves, Karylle, and even its import Iain Glen to name a few) pours their heart to the material. A call to action in these trying times, may this push us to demand for a better nation.Joven Hernando and Alerta. Plato and Kant. Casey and the Philippines. Heroes are still humans. 3.5/5, folks!

rheonna,8,"an aguinaldo propaganda in the guise of a quezon biopic? this film is really all about perception. how quezon weaponized perception. and most importantly on how this film presents aguinaldo in stark contrast to how he was presented in heneral luna. i hated that aguinaldo presented in the past film but i can’t help but sympathize with him in this one. but this is what this film wants it to be and that “aguinaldo propaganda” concludes not only the movie, but the franchise altogether. i kept thinking that maybe there remains in aguinaldo a semblance of heroism especially in that one specific scene where he chose not to introduce quezon’s alleged first wife and just use her as a pawn. or maybe it was the emphasis on how his candidacy for presidency was a mere heed of duty and not out of lust for power. or maybe i felt bad because he was gradually yet loudly stripped of power. or maybe just the culmination of every vengeful act of quezon against him. or maybe it’s just easier to accept him as a lesser evil. the idea of resonating and accepting someone merely because they are a lesser evil is just plain foolishness in theory. even the idea of a “lesser evil” just seems to transcend all bounds of rationality. did we bring that idea into conception as a cry for help? a cry for hope? it’s really easier to side with someone. as a country who remains deep in suffering, misery loves company i guess. but is this really all that we deserve? kailan kayo tayo tuluyang titigil magpakaalipin?",2025-11-02,1,0,watch,True

cent04,9,"'The Noble Lie'. This is one of the lines that resonated with me after watching the film. The mere fact that these traditional politicians boil everything that they do down to this idea of doing questionable means towards a 'good end' is not only narcissistic but also dangerous at best. These people genuinely believe that a lie could be considered 'noble'. Meaning, what is ethically right for them is already skewed, and that conscience no longer plays a role in the crux of their actions. Rosales' Quezon, even at the very end of the film, embodied this rotten mentality, thoroughly absorbed in the idea of being the 'Great Savior' that the Philippines needed for its independence--even at the expense of losing the true meaning of the word.Truly a magnificent end to the 'bayaniverse' trilogy, showcasing a 'war' that is not fought in the front (compared to 'Heneral Luna' and 'Goyo'). A war that is played behind cunning speeches and charming smiles, but is dangerous all the same. Not gonna lie, I thoroughly enjoyed Quezon and Osmena's dynamics (iykyk).

akoaytao,3,"I think the film has true promise. Quezon has always been quite a controversial figure of the early fight for true Philippine independence. He did as much good and as much bad if you really think deeply about it BUT the film is just presented in such a dense way.In posits there is true good in Politics.Even sections of actual criticism in the film is really hampered by Tarrog's insistence of the right 'governance'. The lack of a real alternative or an actual in depth conversations that does not really fall into this guise of moral grandstanding is prevalent that it was so eyeroll inducing. You can read philosophies and still be the worst person ever - a college with Liberal Arts make you learn that quickly. If Quezon did not win, what does Aguinaldo can offer in the table that he himself had not done too?Rather film, just villainizes Quezon's insistence to lead. One good example of the film's insistence for moralistic bent but lack of actual 'analysis' is the film's villainization of Quezon's use of his connection.That is what connections are for. To create this dynamic give and take but it oh no, that is bad - because he can make so much campaign materials. It never really delivered on the fact on what would become the Nacionalista Party lead to one of the biggest ultra-majority in the Philippine's History, a familiar sight if anyone has lived to tell in the Duterte era Congress. In fact, the film kinda glosses the fact that this same majority lead the changes in the constitution that inadvertently resulted to the Marcos Dictatorship. In fact, I do think the reason there are many rich families interested in Government is because how they were able to really to enter political spaces during this time. Like for a film that prides itself as critical, it always uses these weak arguments to posit the rather double face attitude of Quezon. I was grasping straws, because it uses the worst criticisms (ad hominems) rather than just actually pulling real punches that is still present in the current Philippine political space. It just bats this idea that Quezon wants the presidency is bad (not really bad), because he wants it no matter what. His machination is bad since he is not truthful about his intention. It literally is true facts. Quezon is a problematic and prolific muckraker, that most of what we hate about Aguinaldo is actually rooted towards his campaign against him. That is attested but a lot of actual paper trails sadly has been destroyed by the war of 45. The film posits that is bad. (not necessarily) but the problem here is that the film also plays out the same muckraking as noble against some of his 'enemies' since they it's not out there. Like come-on now film. That is just plain stupidity at this point. You cannot just make this two sides of the coin when it's practically the same side. I also hate how the film hates Quezon since he is sly about his approach on things but equally loves the American because of their you ready sine clearly the average filipino does not know the word for Independence. THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT THE LEADERS to begin with. Another instance of the film going for the soft analysis over real question of readiness with the leadership. And also, it really gives so much pass for the Americans and how they handled the Philippines, because they are well-meaning apparently. Suddenly, the atrocities is just a side comment here and there. Even Aguinaldo, who could have been more complex as a character himself is just plainly glorified. I just feel there is so much more here that could have been made to make this actually critical in a sense that in actually is talking about things that would still be prevalent in our life and all. On a lighter mode, Good performances though. Echo does well. I personally think certain actors looked closer to the very Hispanized Quezon but has character for it. He kinda performed really well and the cavalcade of supporting role was a welcome surprise. I personally think the film did well visually and editing wise, which is a lot for a local film. The costuming though is really bad - a lot of badly fitted suits. I will still recommend this BUT with a deep reading about Quezon's role in PHI history tbh. It is important to look at this with a more critical eyes since this takes a lot of true issues about Quezon but in a way that feels misguided tbh. (1) Hmmm. Surface level talks about Government leadership. I wish sana within true leaders dapat tbh. DDS sense is tingling.(2) Uy cinema scenes. Pero again this belief that there is only true good and true bad. And true good is not subtle . And by knowing western idealogy.(3) Konfirmed, half glass empty approach and very dds.(4) The American racism is played done here.(5) Also, Tarrog does hate Quezon here. Even a simple political function like Appointment is played against Quezon, because it is his literal job. He has a job to do, what do you mean he has to be true to some kind of moral logic.(6) Soft positive, great style from Tarrog.(7) Sa lahat ng oomff ko walang commentary about how American was never really into the Philippines, or the rather weird anti-independence belief in the film. but posits that murican cares about you and baddie quezon just want to be free.(8) Not the Aguinaldo advocacy in the film. I still have an hour left off this film and this awful and redeemable in my eyes.(9) Ang tanga na nung film. Literal na may political parties and donor ang isang politiko. Your unpopularity with donors/failing party is more of you problem.(10) There is credence on Aguinaldo vs Quezon. I do believe that Aguinaldo even tried to oust his presidency. (Incorrect it was much worst - collaboration with the Japanese). (11) But this feels like too critical to Quezon at all.(12) This is practically me trying to piece my history. Quezon is not the nicest man in all accounts - the film got that right but he pushed the buttons to where our country lead into. Successful or Not. The film is just too damn negative to the point That it rather be friendly to Americans and Aguinaldo and make them a densely woo is mee characters. (13) Aguinaldo being shocked that people hate after getting a bunch of KKK members death. Kkk is not the same klub from USA, btw.(14) This last section that heavily focuses on Quezon in his final days is so much better. It is a true character study that does not need grandstanding good or bad morality. Talaga namern.",2025-11-02,2,0,watch,False

Instead, he leans on the spiteful energy and conniving instincts of a Peter Sellers character, which fits on the pseudo-satirical bite that this Bayaniverse entry tries to achieve.It is not the best of the three. (In fact, it is the most eyebrow-raising but liberating of them.)

norbssarigumba,8,"The third installment of the Bayani-verse franchise yet again provides a compelling portrayal of another pivotal figure in Philippine history. Jericho and Karylle really stood out in their roles as President Manuel L. Quezon and First Lady Aurora Quezon. I particularly enjoyed the unraveling of the Aguinaldo vs. Quezon showdown in 1935, a satisfying karmic payback for the atrocities Aguinaldo did in the past. Understandably, the movie was not as action packed as its predecessors given that its events occurred post-Philippine revolution. But I found the movie’s exposition of the political drama at that time to have sufficiently made up for the lack of gunshots and wars as a backdropWhile the movie is set in the ‘20s-‘30s, “Quezon” poignantly mirrors the patronage and personality politics that continue to fester our country today.

We feel more directly the decision to make the film allude to our current political landscape where media becomes a tool in dividing the people. I don't think people should take this as autobiographies of our ""bayani"" because this film is not just about Quezon but equally the beginnings of a Philippine government that the people deal with today.

At the end of the day, like Joven, we can still very much acknowledge that the system is absolute ass and fight against it.The unfortunate thing about Tarog's movies so far have been that they're too familiar. So familiar in fact that you can compare an event in the movie to a political event that happened, let's say, just a few weeks ago. Quezon said that he would rather a government run like hell by Filipinos, than a government run like heaven by Americans, because that means we -- the Filipinos -- have the freedom to improve it without outside forces pushing and pulling at us. The problem is, nothing has changed. The Philippines is as much run like hell today as it was way back then.I love you Nadia, 1930s Filipina movie director.

Though deep and well acted, ultimately 2D lng yung mga main characters. The ending was disappointing. Rinush yung “tragedy” ni Quezon to a single scene. It felt less like a story and more just a chronology/ documentary, which is the danger nmn of all biopics. Still, it was a fun watch. The smallest attention to detail (like 48 stars lng yung US flag not 50😍) kept me hooked since it showed na it was made with passion, nde lng for the cheap jokes/ caricatures of history.

It is creative, yet direct enough to clearly tell the narrative to a broad audience.Narrative-wise, the ""film within a film"" trope is a good idea, though it needs some polishing to make the 'buddy and soul' arc more impactful. Despite needing that refinement, it remains a highly creative approach to the story.While I struggle to engage during the very first few minutes, from my lens, this is a great film.

charliewatch13,5,"All that for what, shits and giggles?I honestly am very disappointed by this movie. How was this movie PG, there were swear words every five seconds and smoking in every room?Film makers that continue to fumble when they have a book, a short story, a myth, or literally HISTORY, as reference material continues to baffle me. What a waste of resources and potential.These events happened already. Why the need to add fictional elements for thematic purposes? Was adding fictional character/s necessary, if their goal was to educate our generation of who Quezon really was? And why include flashbacks inside the movie, when we are already looking back into the past? It adds confusion as to where we are in the plot. I did not like the ugly art deco designs in the flashback scenes and as part of the office design. The over contoured faces. Using “Hallelujah Chorus” as background music during the signing of the Tydings-McDuffie Act was tasteless. Please try to be more imaginative next time.American characters (like Wood) being portrayed as morally upright in contrast with Quezon’s portrayal of character should be talked about more. It implies white supremacy and colonial mentality. Let’s not do that all over again :)There was a scene where they brought out Quezon’s first wife for five seconds, for what? Was the goal to empower women or to further impose traditional gender roles where women are pushed to the sidelines? She was dismissed, shrugged from the plot. Please do better next time.This movie had the potential to call out the dirty elections, spoils system, traditional politics, systematic corruption, and imperialism. The very same issues they faced (or should I say reinforced?) before that we still face today. While I do commend the morally stained portrayal of Quezon as it serves as a lesson to not idolize individuals (especially government officials). However, the public may be misled to believe this fictional plot points that are conveniently dramatic. We should not tolerate or promote historical distortion in media. It would be so much better to simply provide the public a historical film that adheres to historical documents and facts.Ps. These are just my opinions.

HAHAHAHAH as far as mainstream pinoy cinema goes, this is a pretty great takedown of the idea of the ""great man"" as told in the history textbooks that we grew up with. the act of framing manuel quezon's shenanigans in his rise to power as one of the seeds that bore our nation's problems in the present is a pretty brave and bold move for a big budget, mainstream studio film to take, especially in the context of our local cinema. what i think makes quezon work so well is how, unlike the previous two films, it still plots out a clear narrative without losing sight of its unifying thread despite chronicling more than decade's worth of history.the unfortunate caveat to all of this is, of course, the loss of focus on other significant political and social players during this time, such as the sakdalista movement, as well as the downplaying of the strength and significance of the presidential campaign of gregorio aglipay, who himself won two provinces, despite the insignificance that the film portrays him with.despite all that, for what it is, jerrold tarog's quezon is still one of the most exciting filipino releases in recent memory, and the inevitable role it will play in the further reassessment of the way we've learned our history and the eventual reckoning with it will be one that i will be watching out for.",2025-10-24,2,0,watch,True
patroclues,7,"Out of all the films in this trilogy, I think Quezon captures the thesis Tarog's take on the filipino hero the best. Comparing it to Luna and especially Goyo, Quezon seems to be more overt with its critique on filipino politics and the filipino people as spectators of what goes on in our society. Though, seemingly with the other films in this trilogy, its message is served to its audience on a silver platter (some would say very preachy) but I guess it's a hard responsibility to take as a directior especially with how a lot of people took Luna's messaging. So in a way that proves the message of the movie? How could the filipino understand freedom if they are deprived of learning about it? also the performances were so good, Jericho Rosales' charisma and his ability to look so scary and eerie in the most tense situations *chefs kiss* in another note, teasing magsaysay in a post credit scene like the next solo movie in the marvel cinematic universe is so funny.",2025-10-31,0,0,watch,False

oninlouis,7,"While Quezon definitely has less action compared to Heneral Luna and Goyo, the other films in the “Bayaniverse,” I was not bored at all. The pacing might be gentler, but the storytelling and performances more than make up for it. The cast delivered strong portrayals that captured both the humanity and complexity of the historical figures, and the musical score complemented the drama beautifully. The production values were impressive as well. They may not be Hollywood-level in terms of scale, but they are undeniably Filipino in spirit and craftsmanship. You can really feel the trademark quality of TBA Studios throughout.As someone who’s a Filipino history nerd, I really appreciated how this film shed light on another side of Manuel L. Quezon, one that’s often overshadowed by his more famous political achievements. I also just learned that Quezon was a lawyer, and as a lawyer myself, it was fascinating to see how he was able to “play the game,” navigating from being a trial lawyer to eventually becoming the President of the Philippines. It added another layer of depth and respect for his intellect and political skill.Having just been to Bataan last week for a historical and heritage trip, I felt an even deeper connection to the story and the period it depicted.I was also fortunate enough to have seen Quezon’s Game a few years ago, and watching Quezon felt like seeing a grander, more expansive retelling of that same chapter in our history. The scope, emotion, and context were all heightened, giving a broader and richer perspective on Quezon’s legacy.Overall, Quezon might not rely on action or spectacle, but it delivers a story that deepens our understanding of one of the key figures in our nation’s history.",2025-10-31,0,0,watch,True

cionastra,10,"sinaunang yaoi is crazy bruh 😭🙏The first thing that really came to mind when I was watching this movie was the stylistic choice it decided to take on. The story-telling was incredible, following the movies made by Nadia with some scenes being her movie, while others being ""real life"". The way scenes were shot in ""real life"" in the style of a silent movie was genuinely so unique to me that it caught my eye. The merge of styles through out the entire movie all fit perfectly as well as contrasted each other well. Secondly, which is probably the most obvious, I enjoyed the perspective this movie gives towards not just Quezon but politics in general. I have heard the criticism about the fantasies this movie merges into what is the ""truth"", but I argue that is the point. The proper approach to movies like this is that after watching it, it should encourage you to research on your own. Be interested, be curious, and compare it to the life we live in. It brings Filipinos awareness back to the Philippines and our history. It may not all be true, but it sure is interesting. Of course, I have to mention the incredible acting of Jericho Rosales, Romnick Sarmenta, Mon Confiado, Therese Malvar, and the rest of the amazing cast. They brought these characters to life. There was a lot of debate about whether or not Jericho Rosales was the right fit for Quezon, but he did astoundingly well. I admire his efforts to be as true to life as he could be, accent and all. I am extremely attached to the style this movie had. Its use of colors, cinematography, and even sound were foundational to the narrative. The final scene, with quezon's quote of ""I am the Filipino People, I am the Philippines!"" brought chills all over my body. The envy in his voice when he questions why Osmeña was blessed with a healthy body and him not made me also question the irony of their story. It reminds me that sins are also reflected in the body. Wonderful movie, it brings about questions that we may never get answers to, and thoughts we may never complete. A beautiful and extravagantly painted picture of the past, that now leaves an impression on our present and the actions for our future.",2025-10-31,0,0,watch,True

dabidabidan,,"The Questions of QuezonThroughout Jerold Tarog's trilogy, he raises important questions about heroism — and in Quezon (2025), he explores it not as an absolute truth but as a matter of perception. Sa dami ng na-trigger at nabuong kontrobersya, it begs the question: handa na nga ba tayo sa malayang diskusyon tungkol dito?“Independencia!” The very ideal that Quezon and his forerunners fought and died for is finally within reach — pero paano ito aabutin ng bagong magiging presidente? The film thrives in the space between conflicting morals, fitting for a morally obsessed country riddled with corruption. Alin nga ba ang mas epektibo? Idealismo or realidad?The film is generous in portraying the old man's charm, eloquence, and impeccable sense of style. But in true Tarog fashion, he wasn't safe from being questioned either. Beneath the charisma lies his vanity, a leader fully aware of his strength and uses it to advance his ambitions -- whether for his country or for himself, who knows?Tarog's meta approach, blending fiction and history is a tricky but effective device. Nadia's films-within-the-film reveal two sides of the story, the same way Tarog does throughout his trilogy. The film doesn’t just retell the past; it exposes how the narratives we accept as truth are constructed. Gaano nga ba kalaki ang papel ng media, pelikula, o ngayon, ng TikTok sa politika ng bansa?What remains unclear, however, is the role of the Americans in the narrative. I didn’t quite appreciate how Governor Wood sort of became a ""father figure"" to the away-bati childishness of Quezon and Osmeña. Wasn’t this separation engineered by the ’Kano themselves?In today's battle against fake news, sensationalism and historical accuracy, Quezon's creative licenses may be a double-edged sword. But honestly? To hell with it!It's a triumph of Filipino filmmaking. It provokes, divides, and gets us all talking. Quezon doesn’t claim to be the truth, but it forces us to question who gets to tell it. So really, what is there to lose?---------On a lighter note, as a tubong Quezon myself, I have to say — Echo nailed Quezon’s American English accent of that time, but not quite his Tayabasing Tagalog.",2025-10-27,0,0,rewatch,False

jellobee,8,"Quezon provides an unbiased but contentious retelling of the titular character’s rise and fall in Philippine politics, his undeniable influence and charm, and his lasting impact in the country’s bid for independence.Despite the title, the film was not a glorification, but a critique on the character that is Manuel L. Quezon, the second president of the Philippines. Because while it was he who sought for Philippine independence, history tells us he might have done it in the not so cleanest of ways. While charming and influential, he was also brutal, unrelenting, and felt like he was Thanos or Darth Vader at times.The storytelling was great. Using film to backtrack the history of Quezon from his humble beginnings to his rise to presidency was really a good touch. It also really helped in presenting the exposition and Philippine history without it seeming like it was forced. It was like watching an educational film within a film.It was really paced well, too, as it divided chapters of Quezon’s life based on his political enemies at the time – it was like watching him go up the political ranks as he beat one adversary after another. Each scene felt intentional and it didn’t feel like 2 hours have passed.Like any other historical account, this film took some big creative liberties as well. While it could be really good for dramatic effect and inducing a reaction, it could also spark controversy and be misconstrued as the truth. With this, I thought some of the choices could’ve stuck to the truth and just exaggerated them a bit.But all in all, Quezon is a great film for both the casual audience and history buffs. It’s a good critique on the character of Manuel Quezon and as well as on all the political figures surrounding him at the time. At the same time, it’s also a good way to learn about the history of the Philippines, its political landscape, and its journey to independence.

racoverano,6,"i really wanted to love this film, i was looking forward to it. i did enjoy watching it, both as a film and for its historical subject. the performances were really good, i can see that the actors really enjoyed playing their roles. the story was a bit meta as well which i liked.but the film had a lot going for it that really held it back. the production felt rushed. the actor for wood was wasted with so few scenes showing him. the story also spanned too wide a period, leaving no room for additional context as to what was happening in the film. i knew the historical context behind those scenes, but i doubt the same can be said of the general public.then there's the narrative itself. one issue that really bothers me with this trilogy is how they portray the americans as reasonable. that scene where wood was talking to some locals and how they exclaimed that independence was good enough to eat was icky. what exactly is that scene supposed to mean. it feels patronizing. and how they felt quezon even more so. that he was manipulative, shrewd, was already known. the director said he wanted to humanize him. but quezon had no redeeming qualities in the film. he had no arc. actually, if you look at all three movies, all the leading characters had no arcs. they lived and ended their films with nothing about them having changed, nor something interesting shown about them. luna was a hothead, goyo was a womanizer, and quezon was conniving. luna being this unwavering patriot didnt make sense to me. he ratted out on the katipunan at first, and only joined the revolution when it was finally against the americans. goyo felt too small a figure that even in his own film, the focus wasnt on him, it was on aguinaldo and mabini (granted, that the trilogy was more of aguinaldo's arc, than the figures important to his story). and quezon, for all his and his colleagues' shrewdness, won ph independence from a country so reluctant to recognize it. that it played into their ambition shouldnt faze us from recognizing the monumental task ahead of them. these figures are not beyond reproach, nor are the films wrong from portraying them the way they were portrayed. there are just elements in these films, that quezon really amplify, that prevent them from reaching their potential. these movies have moved the discourse, both in history and in film far, but could not any further.",2025-10-26,0,0,watch,False

Jericho Rosales delivers a remarkable performance—his Quezon feels layered, seamlessly shifting from statesman to tactician with effortless charm. You can sense the performance behind the persona, the fragility behind the power.For me, Quezon isn’t really a takedown of a hero; it’s a mirror. It forces us to see how the leaders we admire, and even the systems we live in, are built by people as fragile and flawed as we are.

Rosales treads close to a mere impersonation while Confiado shines through his restraint.Quezon’s portrayal is flat compared to Luna’s and Goyo’s because unlike the latter, the former is not portrayed as a human with flaws but simply a wretched opportunist fueled by greed and ego. Luna’s populist portrayal is balanced with his sincere desire to fight colonialism. Goyo’s naïveté is tempered by his youthful idealism. Quezon, on the other hand, shows no redeeming factor.

bigstinkpoop,8,"What a wonderfully nasty piece of work that portrays things in such a devilishly entertaining way. It was fun watching the politics in this movie portrayed in such a darkly comedic, performative, and theatrical way (especially the first half). The way everything seems so ultra rehearsed, the way they move, the way they’re blocked, etc. together with some lively camera work created for such a weirdly unserious yet engaging experience. Though its chronological sequencing was a bit confusing at the start, and it’s pretty easy to get lost in what point of time we’re in.It’s funny too because these people are determining the future and current state of the country, yet it’s just a game to them; a stupidly intricate, dangerous game for power on who yaps and complains the loudest, all while Americans meddle with everything (as they always have), so it was over when Quezon stated that he learned from them.The biggest compliment I’d give is how this movie lowkey had some balls. I did NOT expect it to paint characters the way they did. They imply a shocking amount of things, and just straight up show how disgusting and slimy people were, albeit really smart and strategic for the worse.The foundation of this country, and its current systems have always been stained by foreigners (particularly the Americans), and it continues to be. Deny it all you want, the worst country in the world has that much power because it convinced the world that it does. The same way the loudest people always have, or end up, with some level of power.That’s Philippine politics for y’all; a loud, nasty, slimy game where the occupiers are always somehow the winners despite what people want to believe. Where the nastiest ones always somehow win, and it’s because they know how to play this deranged, ugly game incredibly well.A game that sadly demands you surrender your morals for survival, and that survival turns into a disgusting lust for power. The worst guy you know won the game because the system favors them.Also, Ramon Magsaysay will appear in Avengers Doomsday 😂😂😂",2025-10-30,2,0,watch,True

I am glad that this film wasn't propaganda as it was basically no filter and they showed us plain history.

mendozaluigi,6,"It’s been a while since we’ve seen a political film that brings us back to our senses and challenges what it means to be patriotic. (Maybe Gomburza tho) Quezon is a fresh film that introspects on the evils in both society and ourselves, and how we even play our role in corruption. I loved that Quezon is humanized as someone who had to play the game against bigger evils. Props to the super creative use of storytelling devices and other details, like Joven (journalist), newspapers, and films (all seemingly inspired from Citizen Kane). Much like Kane too, Quezon’s character reveals itself and his ambitions piece by piece, shifting our perception of him until his death.The film does quite have a spoonfed narrative though. The script tends to overexplain its themes and motivations. Great that it makes everything more digestible to the general public, but it also takes away some subtlety.The cast is solid and GOATEDD, and special shoutout to DOP Pong Ignacio.

filmstrip80s,4,"This film was indeed a pandora's box as how Mr. Avancena worded it. I came into the movie theater full of enthusiasm to watch it, but I came out full of questions, undecided if I was to believe the narrative, and unsatisfied. Upon going home, I had to research the next days about the veracity of this film. The film juxtaposed several elements of different timeframes such as colorized and non-colorized cinema to show the antagonist Quezon and the underdog Osmena narrative. It showed how Quezon tried to politick the Filipinos and Osmena (the Americans included)just to gain the seat for President. This also portrayed that patronage politics might have started in Quezon's time. However, just like the other Bayaniverse series, it is for the viewer to discern which part of the film was true or not because the disclaimer was only put in the beginning of the film. Thus, the viewers nee to read and research further. After watching the film, I also had the thought that publishing a book might not do so much after the trending phase of this film because in the era of social media, a book would not reach the same level of viewers that the film would reach especially if this will be released on online streaming platforms. On my part, it would be better if I would be able to read the researched part even on a blog online. The cast played well on their roles as Osmena, Quezon, and Aguinaldo. Other made up characters like Nadia and Joven, complemented the storyline . There was even a point where Nadia herself made fun of Quezon's traits. The main characters copied even the intonation of the politicians. Overall, it was a good film, but for a full length film, it feels incomplete. For a film just to end with ""I am the Philippines"", it feels unnatural. Well and good, Quezon died in America so there was really no good ending. But given that this was a mix of fiction and history, I hope they showed at least a memory of Quezon's memorial.",2025-10-28,0,0,watch,False

It was just simply a glittery word we acquainted with being free from Americans and establishing our own rule.As far as I am aware 1935 was an establishment of a commonwealth to transition to 1946 which was our genuine independence as a nation. We see this film through a sort of journalistic storytelling lenses of Joven Hernando (a fictional character), as he threads through what he went through prior to this film and the aftermath of Goyo towards the time he was reporting Quezon’s senatorial endeavors, his run for presidency, and unspooling the threads of who and what Quezon is. What is Politics? What is Patronage Politics?Politics has roots in Aristotle’s work, Politika, a Greek word which consequently means things concerning the polis (city). It is the ability by which one can use power, or direct influences to an individual, group, community, or a nation that a person “doing politics” busy themselves with. This occurs at all levels of a society.Now what is patronage politics? Associations, positions, promotions, and contracts are based on personal connections and friendships rather than pure merit. This is also what we call the padrino system or clientelism. Why am I highlighting this? You may think of our so called Bayanis as the glorified images they were portrayed as and made up to be by textbooks, anecdotes, and so on. But, they are just as horrid and grotesque as any 21st century politician can be. As Quezon believed it, it was a game, and the trick was to cheat it. Noble LiesIn the movie we see Joven and Quezon have a short argument about truth, their difference, and why it matters when they’ve attained a victory for independence or freedom. They reference many classic texts and philosophical concepts from which Quezon mentioned “mentira noble”, Spanish for a noble lie.This is a concept derived from Plato’s ‘The Republic’ in which Plato discusses that societies are built on such lies. If the masses believe in something (independence), then there is something to fight for. (Krause, 2019) Which in the film he utilizes as a way to earn power and along the way do some good for those who have placed his trust on him.Joven’s dialogue and realizations in contrast to this throughout the film reflects the audience’s gradual disposition over what can we believe from Quezon or in contemporary times, those who claim to have the nation’s best interests.Are Filipinos that fucking stupid?The humor in the film is great. Satire doesn’t necessarily mean a quality of being funny but just the moments that are spread sporadically throughout the film makes you smile and chuckle while also grappling with how twisted the butt of the jokes are. There is this moment when Leonard Wood who went on a trip around the Philippines to survey whether the Filipinos were truly capable of independence asked a few townspeople along with his translator if they knew what independence meant, to which one replied that: “They become full (their stomach) from the thought of it,” I couldn’t help but laugh and overhear a chuckle from 1 other watcher besides me. (Albeit what I quoted is not direct as I am struggling remembering the exact line. )So the question is are Filipinos stupid? No. We believe the propagandas, the persuasive anecdotes, what others say, and what we say because we hope for nothing but the best for all of us. It is not our fault that those we place our trust in chooses to betray us—the same way Quezon did to Joven, the same way Quezon did to Aguinaldo, and the same way Aguinaldo did to Luna and Bonifacio. I cannot stress how we’re stuck in this perpetual loop and how deep-rooted such issue is. Alas, human nature and greed is a mystical thing, it surpasses all reasoning and thought.But, in this day and age, if you cannot use history and the information at your disposal to think rationally—you are a stupid Filipino. Sorry.The WomenWhat is Aurora Quezon, Maria Agoncillo, and Carmen and Nadia Hernando’s role in all of this? Well, to show the intricacies and persistence of women who stand at the shadows of history. Aurora Quezon, behind the scenes is a woman who could stand her ground at the same level as Manuel Quezon.Maria Agoncillo, becomes Aguinaldo’s anchor as he goes through the loss and dirty tactics done by Quezon. Carmen and Nadia are smart women whose integrity and careers are supported by their husband in a time where women were otherwise discouraged. An article by the Lifestyle Inquirer goes into interviews with the respective actresses and provides valuable insight for these characters and how important they are. You can search for it. With that, I hope to soon see a movie about a female hero, as the director also hopes to do if given the chance.Quezon has a husband, OsmenaThey should get married, honestly. They bicker and make up like a husband and his wife would. The parallels run deep, friend or foe, tampuhan, the ancient and homosexual version of Bongbong and Sara. You will understand what I mean when you see the film, it sounds diabolical, I know.Their dynamic is like two academic rivals who do nothing but outdo each other and try to tolerate each other and when hurt make up for it. For instance, the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act and the blatant copying of assignment but slightly changing the wording with the consequent Tydings-McDuffie Act all because Quezon wanted the credit when Hare-Hawes-Cutting was his idea. Finally…“Maybe it’s about proving what you can do, instead of proving what is right.” — Carmen HernandoShe’s right, at the end of the day why should these politicians never fulfill and serve their own interests? At this point it is an interplay of psychological warfare, scheming, power play, and gaining something out of their endeavors whether it be favors, money, or something to leverage themselves further. But how will we, as a country move on forward with confidence and trust towards those who govern us when betrayal is in the table? When the nation’s interests aren’t fulfilled? When they are the sole reason we can’t get ourselves out of this damning rut? Perhaps this 21st century we ask, if there is a 22nd century will the Filipinos then, be able to live a better life? Because I have seen enough to say that in my lifetime at least, it’s never going to get any better.Suffice to say, I loved this film. I availed of the ₱ 250.00 discount allowed for students and teachers, and I did not feel like I wasted money at all. If we talk about the technical aspects like: the direction, music, composition, casting, and wardrobe, they were all perfect. You’ll never think throughout watching that they chickened out with giving Quezon (2025) huge production value. In a time where corruption is rampant in Philippine politics, well in retrospect it has always been, this film could not be any more relevant and timely. I implore everyone to support Filipino film and cinema, as they are a treasure trove of bright and brimming ideas awaiting audiences to see them.",2025-10-30,0,0,watch,True

He plays Quezon not as a spotless hero but as a man who understands how leadership relies on performance. The film doesn’t glorify him; it examines him. It shows how charisma can inspire and manipulate at the same time, and how power often hides behind elegance.The movie looks beautiful, with careful production design, steady pacing, and clean editing that keeps even long political exchanges engaging. Tarog’s direction is thoughtful and confident, peeling back Quezon’s myth not to tear it down but to reveal the man underneath that’s ambitious, flawed, and burdened by what it takes to lead.Seen at SM City Dasmariñas",2025-10-19,0,0,watch,False

The production design, pacing and cinematography all feel meticulously crafted, it’s clear the team sought to challenge the idea of grand national myth and instead expose the power-games behind it. In doing so, Quezon invites us to see how legacy is manufactured, and how leadership is as much performance as service.

thepaintedstar,8,"While considered polarizing, I still do appreciate the storytelling. I have a lot of thoughts on this as well as it's parallels to the ""Hamilton"" Broadway Musical, but I shan't divulge further. The only thing I would change about this is the use of the silent film aesthetic. At first, I liked it because it brought something new to the table and did tie well to the artistic intent to the film but as it went on, I felt like it somehow lost the plot. I felt like it didn't capture well which parts were reflective of the ""film"" and which ones were the supposed ""actual"" occurences. It was only at the end where I felt it become harmonious with the other two films in the series because of the familiar feeling it invoked. Maybe what I really wanted to get from the film was to viscerally understand the history it focuses on. How does it's overall storytelling differ from how I would read it from a textbook? How will an unbiased journalist portray it without being propaganda-like?Nonetheless, I loved the movie!

Glad to have watched this in the theater! 🫶🏻—Nung una I was quite disappointed sa unang part, na parang preamble, pero I guess that’s just how they make use of the time.I like how they portrayed Quezon: a politician through and through: knows how to play a game, used PR, used ads, used propaganda. Technically he has the charisma (mestizo), uniqueness (maybe because mestizo nga, not as Filipino, Filipino), nerve – because in the movie he portrays really going after what he wants, and talent — he rose above the ranks from lawyer to president. I didn’t see him as a bad person, but as a politician, so technically a bad person. Lol.We can see the portrayal and effect of media, and its relationship to politicians. The connections, the benefits might really impair the judgement, and of course, the want to survive life with a job that brings food to the table. But I like that at the end, the media is aware of its rile and at the same time, still aware of its principles once awakened to see whats happening.I like a quote about idolizing person that you may be blinded — ugh, I hope to capture the whole thing when it’s online.

Anyway. I really love the cinematography, the music, the production design, the pacing, everything. This movie felt so beautiful and put together. The colors and composition reminded me of Wes Anderson in a way and that was such a joy to look at. I always love a good non-linear story so that was extra fun to watch too, though I didn’t fully get it at first because I didn’t get to see the first few scenes. >:(I’ve always loved how Tarog uses Joven to tell the story so now, the use of Joven’s daughter’s film as a storytelling device really got me. The documentary (??) bits were one of my favorite parts. So Charlie Chaplin. I really loved that. The script was also really well written and the way the actors delivered them was so on-point. Most of them are some of my favorite actors too. Rusca got recast which made me sad for a minute because he was my favorite in Heneral Luna, but then I found out the old actor was actually a horrible person, so um. Sucks.The yaoification of Quezon and Osmeña is... interesting. They always find a way to make these movies seem a bit gay. Interesting. So. I think this movie is way better than Goyo because that one honestly bored me (I know the quiet aesthetic was intentional but I didn't like it okay). But Heneral Luna is still my favorite. Luna’s story just hits harder. But yh, this one still feels stronger in terms of the technical stuff. It's very neat and I can't wait to rewatch it.

kapengiced_,10,"​""Bakit siya ang pinagpala ng mabuting kalagayan? Hindi ba nila kilala kung sino ako? I am Manuel Luis Quezon! I am the Filipino People! I am the Philippines!""​The final lines of the film perfectly encapsulate the kind of person Manuel Luis Quezon was—a power-hungry, manipulative, all-knowing, chameleon king.​Tarog's portrayal of Quezon displayed him as a human being; a being with his own selfish greeds and desires. Books and documentaries would often portray Quezon as nothing but a ""perfect president,"" so shedding light on him as a trapo will definitely have his relatives shaking their heads at the representation.​Heroes were often depicted as nothing but that—perfect, heroic, symbols of peace and protection. However, in Tarog's final installment of the Bayaniverse Trilogy, he portrayed Quezon under a different lens: he was portrayed as imperfect, flawed. Quezon was sick, twisted, and outwardly selfish—something that made him stand out from Goyo and Luna. (Btw, my memory could be serving me wrong.) Goyo and Luna were portrayed as these ""sacrificial"" heroes whose actions were driven by their patriotism and love for the country. Quezon, however, was not. His actions were driven by his need to have and stay in power. As mentioned, ""Mauuna pang pumuti ang uwak kaysa mawalan ka ng kapangyarihan, Quezon"" for he did anything and everything in his power to ensure that he was never in a position of no power.​Quezon was terrifying for how ""real"" he is in this day and time. He was able to manipulate the people by abusing the Filipino's belief of utang na loob—and he used that as ammunition in every political war, which ultimately led to his victory. Another factor was how Quezon curated his image of ""perfection"" by utilizing his connections to the fullest—even going as far as trampling over the livelihood and well-being of the people if it meant staying in power. He used people at his disposal, all the while maintaining a picture-perfect image to the media and the people.​Quezon is terrifying because while he may not have been fighting armies on the war zones, he was pulling the strings from the best seat in the house.",2025-10-29,0,0,watch,True

lordgallenghein,8,"Watched Heneral Luna one time ago and never seen Goyo (but willing to watch after). Quezon is the final film from TBA's Bayniverse. It honestly feels like a satisfying conclusion to its said trilogy. I was never known to be interested in early Philippine history. I watched this because it's a film that's highly anticipated nationwide. I was really impressed by how the film goes from Manuel's early life through films, and how his life is in turmoil through the battle for independence. However, the film explores his desire for deception to gain much power to become the second president of the Philippines. Something so sinister that I understand that's how Jerrold interpreted it based on facts about Quezon's ""game"".Every aspect in every scene resembles the reality we still have. We're still in a developed country, which is not surprising to say the least. We're humans playing by the rules and laws. But for our country, it's what we live for.I adored how the film opens, but then I get a bit overwhelmed afterward. Thankfully, I was able to connect the dots on what's happening. I was blown away by the visuals, production set, and its ensemble cast of this film. It's truly amazing to see those in a Philippine film. Although, the sound mixing and camera work felt they needed to fill up on some scenes. Almost to make this film perfect.Now, the film Quezon became a national debate, thanks to one of Quezon's descendants at the Q&A post-screening. He stated that the film affected him, claiming it's a satire rather than a biopic. And he's not the only one; a few of Quezon's families are also affected by the film afterward. Many hated, many defend. It is very common to see this happening in every biopic film ever made. Filmmakers create a film based on a real-life figure, followed by credible sources available. Despite that, you will never escape from any person who knows a real-life figure because they don't provide you with any consideration before the film was made. To respond to that fiasco, I dare to say that this film is worth watching for everybody who's not interested in or complains about it. The disclaimer says it all, and yet they roared for a boycott. But as long as Quezon tells you exactly what the director and writers had envisioned, the film is the representation of our struggle to handle our country due to lies and deception.",2025-10-29,0,0,watch,False

sashimimojo,5,"Just watched Quezon. I want to start by saying I think Filipino films are not quite my jam, unfortunately.I wanted to like this. It had its moments, and I get the idea it wanted to convey.Quezon is a depiction of how Americans influenced Philippine politics into what it is today—for better or worse (mostly worse). It was not a good painting of Manuel Quezon by any means.I grew up not really minding Philippine presidents. Quezon, for me, felt like a decent person, someone who was deeply connected with the US—President of the Commonwealth. The film depicted him as a sneaky politician who would do everything to stay in power. He was charismatic and had a way with his words and aura. Unfortunately, the whole time I felt like I missed much more nuance in him. I felt his characterization was too one-sided; it seemed like he was used as a plot point to get a point across. The film was actually confusing to follow at first due to the differing timelines.The problem with political films is that they tend to be biased from a certain point of view. This felt like one of those films. I wished I had seen a complex character—one who is a lion when he needs to be but perhaps also a person who genuinely believed in something.This was my first entry in the 'bayaniverse' by Tarog. Perhaps most of what was depicted was true, but I think it left out some of the important parts of what made Quezon a fascinating Filipino president.I did like the heart of what it wanted to depict. We live in a political regime where corporations are the boss and the leaders do things to stay in power—not for the people.The acting was not that good. They hired a 'for the money' American actor, and the leads did not feel authentically Filipino. Or maybe the writing was just mid.",2025-10-23,0,0,watch,False

trcdelps,8,"I am the Philippines The third installment of Tarrogs' Bayaniverse explores on Manuel L Quezon as a four part film; The Hero, The Great Political Player, and the lobbyists towards the Philippines' Independence.Unlike the first two films which focus on the fight for a Revolutionary Government, Quezon, sets up a new story toward nation building translated to themes of power and play in the political arena(of which parallels to the existing political patterns of Philippine Politics). The good points of the film would be the idea of a film within a film; how media was an excellent medium to portray the two sides of Quezon as the Hero and the Trapo(traditional politician). Jericho Rosales did and excellent execution portraying someone who despite being narcissistic and intelligent gentleman you can't help but to love the guy.Another good point was the role Joven Hernando as the main protagonist guised as a side character which has been consistent on all three films. The role of Joven, a fictional character meant to symbolize the viewers but my interpretation would also be the youth who are seeking for truth. Joven meaning youth in Spanish is an excellent name for the character inviting the youth to critically think and discern for a more Independent Philippines.This last installment,while it stirs controversy on the portrayal of President Manuel L.Quezon, opens a fresh perspective how we can further improve our flawed system To quote the late President MLQ""I would rather have a government run like hell by Filipinos,than run like heaven by Americans, because no matter how bad a Filipino Government might be, we can always change it""",2025-10-28,0,0,watch,True

Kung gusto mo ng kapangyarihan, alyansa, at lakas — rurumihan mo at gagawa ka ng pangalan dahil nga ang sistema ng politiko sa ating bansa ay naghahangad tayo na mga leader na may 'messianic' dahil tayo ay lugmok sa mapang-alipustang sistema. Quezon's took that mindset kaya mabilis siya nakahanap ng propaganda. And during that time, iyon ang isinisigaw ng tao, kaya he took that chance to make name out of it and gain the power he has.This is also a good storytelling of how 'populism' is existing in our country.

Perhaps the most urgent for me to look at, is its distribution and promotion — how its coining of ""Bayaniverse"" has transmuted to multiple efforts of sustaining its captured audience from Heneral Luna (2015) and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2018). In these ongoing attempts of serving its captured audience, Quezon has both failed and served them at best. By constantly challenging and deconstructing our ideals of heroism, Quezon has to eventually hurt the Pinoy pride, which I personally found an achievement. Sometimes, to offend the audience is to serve them best. By structuring a film (or films) within the film, Quezon mirrors what many of us refuse to see and can't yet actively confront, that our eventual participation in the culture of patronage politics has built the Duterte - Marcosverse.Meanwhile, I couldn't help but realize that Goyo is actually my favorite of the 3.

groovygeek,10,"I appreciate how this film challenges the notion of being a “Bayani” differently compared to Heneral Luna (2015) and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2018).The film isn’t afraid to show that Manuel L. Quezon was a deeply flawed and problematic person despite all his achievements and contributions in helping the Philippines understand and reach independencia.(Random funny side note: It tickles my brain every time they say “independencia,” and when they curse in Filipino with their thick accents.)It’s necessary to have narratives like this every once in a while because people tend to put others on pedestals and perceive them as flawless and ideal individuals. This is dangerous because idolatry leads to leniency, leniency leads to conformity, and conformity leads to collapse.Everything breaks down when we put the weight and responsibility of an entire country on one person alone, instead of recognizing that it also takes an entire nation’s worth of people to create change.This story is socially relevant not only because of our current political landscape here in the Philippines, but also as a reminder of the importance of looking back on our history to ensure we never repeat the mistakes of the past.The film is also masterfully crafted on a technical level and is arguably the best in the Bayaniverse so far. The direction, cinematography, editing, staging, musical score, and performances from the entire cast. They all shine here. Every single department that worked on this film fired on all cylinders, and it shows.There is also a level of playfulness present here (Mostly because of the score, staging, and performances) in the film that I really appreciate.

cefirolikesstar,7,"Of all the Bayaniverse movies, Quezon (2025) is arguably the most polarizing. I'll try my best to condense my thoughts, organizing them based on meta analysis, historical truth, and social commentary.In its most meta, Quezon (2025) stands to subvert audience expectations with its characterization of Manuel L. Quezon. In Tarog's previous films, he sought to shed a more sympathetic light on misunderstood figures of Philippine history. Portraying Luna as a passionate and enlightened man, Goyo as misguided and young, and even Aguinaldo as complex and misunderstood. However, how could he showcase the story of a man who's well-beloved by a nation? It's in the best interest of many to concede that although polarizing, Quezon being characterized as the progenitor of patronage politics is on brand for Dir. Tarog. Luna and Goyo were already established by key aspects of their stories, either by being hot-headed or accomplished and young. Jerrold Tarog's brand has been to take what the audience may know and provide a different perspective, thus explaining Quezon's diva tantrums and arrogance. However, the question remains—Is it historically accurate? From my understanding of the film, Tarog already sought to answer those questions within the film itself. Accuracy and truth is greatly influenced by the filmmaker, her patron, and even preexistent ideas of who a person is. History is not my career, thus I can't provide a professional opinion on its accuracy. What I can say, however, is that if Tarog's own opus is be trusted—he, the director, is merely a man. He is not infallible and thus, the truth as he knows it, may not entirely be what it is. Historical accuracy cannot simply be based on its costuming and subtle details in props, but also the integrity of the story itself. Lastly, the movie is obviously a very nail-on-the-head commentary on politicians whose personal ambitions are hid thinly behind a persona of nationalism. It feels like a jab against growing populist sentiments, but antagonizes the greedy who sought to reap its benefits with little sincerity. It explores how the formula for gaining power as an ambitious, dynastic politician has never really changed in the past century or so. Unless the people themselves are willing to start questioning the integrity of the people they sought to empower with their votes, for every disgraced politician another corrupt politician will take his place. Perhaps I'm reading too much into this, but Quezon (2025) feels like some sort of cinematic social experiment that Jerrold Tarog gave us. He's seen the power of Heneral Luna and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, perhaps this is just him leaving a movie that's on-purposely polarizing so that the people can be forced to think about the credibility of everything they see. Even if not his intention, it's great to see this play out.The movie was enjoyable and the stylistic difference definitely ties into how we're in a brand new era of Philippine history. I'm hoping to see a similar thing be done with any of his future works ✨",2025-10-24,0,0,watch,False

vistica,9,"I'll be honest, I didn't know much about Manuel Quezon outside the fact that he's considered a national hero—and a bit about the questionable land acquisition practices in the establishment of his namesake city.And not being a huge fan of biopics, I was just hoping for a nuanced look at a national hero.But holy shit, this pulled no punches. Quezon is portrayed to have learned the worst of the political game from the Americans. Effective? Incredibly so. Honorable? Nope.I had to pull up some recordings of him afterwards, Rosales absolutely nailed his cadence. The acting here was incredible. The cinematography some of the best I've seen from a Filipino movie. And best of all, it LOOKED like a movie. This was cinematic.And surprising for a political biopic, this was a blast. It was hilarious. It didn't take itself too seriously (or seriously at all, really).Maybe those more familiar with the story will be annoyed by the heavy use of exposition, but I found it to be helpful. I'm not here to shit on anyone else's national heroes—I've got plenty of American historical figures I can do that to. But, this does do a great job of depicting how Quezon's style of politicking, and selling off his country's resources to the highest bidders, seems to have led to the rampant levels of corruption seen today, 100 years later.Added to My Filipino Film Diary",2025-10-27,3,0,watch,True

myxzaboteur,7,"Sa kahit anong sulok ng kasaysayan mo man tignan, ang pangkaraniwang mamamayan parin ng inang bayan ang talo at sawi sa labang pangkasarinlan. Quezon strongly exposes how rotten and self serving the Philippine government, not just in the past but surely applies in the current political climate as well. Even individuals like Joven, a journalist who's supposed to be the beacon of vocie and truth for the Filipino masses couldn't avoid this plague of corruption and selfishness.Utang na loob culture has brought the country more bad than good. It continues to feed from the goodness of people and instead of helping us progress, this culture have done nothing but weighed us down more from the weight of being indebted.Real change can only happen if the people in power, the elected officials can finally do their job properly and lead the citizens into a path that thrives in excellence rather than settling for mediocrity or ""okay na to"". Be great examples first and expect the people to follow your footsteps next.Round of applause for the impressive cast and quality production of Quezon as well.

pablolous,8,"A scathing and surprisingly humorous indictment of Quezon and his supposedly scummy character, so much so that it enters caricature territory, but I'm reminded of Tarrog's overarching project of interrogating what a bayani means. This is supported further by the dimension that the film adds to Aguinaldo who was a clear villain in ""Heneral Luna."" There's a dearth of (good) films about history and politics in mainstream contemporary Filipino film, so I was pleased to see some unconventional editing and cinematographic choices here that are more common in foreign biopics. The incorporation of the silent film was a clever device all around – a way to deepen the fictional Joven's story while beefing up the commentary on media as a tool of propaganda, a cost-cutting yet effective touch on the artificiality of celebrity politics, a self-aware reflection on how history is written by the victors. Rosales' transformation is a thrill to watch and a testament to the ripening of his craft but I was also really captivated by Sarmienta's performance. Sometimes the script sounds like it's lifted from a HEKASI textbook but it's forgivable for people like me who need the refresher course.",2025-10-27,1,0,watch,False
roizyrilb,8,"With memorable performances from the cast, compelling storytelling, and masterful direction, Quezon (2025) deserves to stand and be praised on its own. Still it’s best viewed as the final installment to the Bayaniverse trilogy. In this lens, we really see Jerrold Tarog’s thesis throughout the series: “Ang pagkabayani, it’s all about perception.”Heneral Luna (2015) showed a hero with unrivaled passion and patriotism. John Arcilla’s Luna is a hero people wanted to rally behind and emulate. He was branded as a leader who could have saved the Philippines, if not for the infighting between the revolutionaries. Yes, he was a flawed character, but you wanted to root for him. Never mind that he never won a battle – his profound love of country made up for it. The timing of the film also couldn’t be more perfect — it was released during an intense rise in populism. The film arguably contributed to Rodrigo Duterte winning the 2016 presidential elections, but that’s another story.Goyo: The Boy General (2018) was more subdued. There was no way to replicate Luna’s fiery personality and Arcilla’s performance as a cussing, temperamental general, so it was only natural to take another approach. Paulo Avelino gave life to the young, inexperienced boy general. In history classes, Goyo was often described as a martyr who died for his beloved country. The film portrayed his conflict – was he really loyal to his country or only to Aguinaldo? Was his sacrifice heroism or blind servitude?Quezon depicted a trapo’s rise to power. Jericho Rosales’ Quezon showed ability to pull all the tricks in the book: propaganda, lying, self-serving alliances, politicking, patronage politics. He wasn’t the first to do them (and we know from our daily experiences now that he’s not the last), but he no doubt mastered them. Describing him as a chameleon was an understatement. Always performing and projecting what the other side wants him to be.More importantly, Quezon brought the trilogy’s thesis full circle. The film, like the two before it, argues that heroism is not black and white. “Ang pagkabayani, it’s all about perception.”The film within a film device effectively blurred the lines between reality and fiction. The switching between different Quezons (the old version, the young version, the fictionalized young version), the nonlinear storytelling and changing perspectives, further served to confuse the audience about objective history and revisionist recollection.But the film’s biggest and most-rewarding bet is making Joven Hernando (the audience surrogate) an active participant to the story. By showing that he can be swayed by narratives, blinded by his own biases, be bought, but ultimately speak truth to power, the challenge is flipped back to the viewer. How should we view heroes? When we know that they “get their hands dirty” with politics; they forge convenient alliances; they stage publicity stunts; they do everything not for the greater good, but to push their own ambitions. How should we question our leaders and speak truth to power when we can also benefit from them if only we played our cards right?Looking at the trilogy as a whole, it is clear that our heroes, despite their contributions to the nation, are flawed individuals. Despite their larger-than-life personas, they are just people too. Like us. The whole time we were focused on the titular characters, on supposed saviors we have preconceived perceptions on. But this conclusion just reminded us we ought to look at ourselves and our relationship with these heroes too.",2025-10-18,0,0,watch,True

joviegeek,8,"Had a great time with this and it's a refreshing injection of optimism for the Philippine cinema scene. Love that our theater was packed and our audience was constantly engaged with every bit of dialogue, every Rosales enunciation, and every plot turn - the theater experience definitely amplified it. I cannot emphasize how lovely it is how this film ignited film discourse that I haven't felt about a local movie in a while since Heneral Luna.Jerrold Tarog's direction and screenplay with Rody Vera feel so ambitious in its approach to this type of film. The confidence seeps through every scene and how we're carried through scene by scene through its Hollywood level production design, editing, costume design, and unique biographical structure. Always been wowed at the idea of Joven Hernando and who he represents and this is all the more captivating as what transpires in this film. I felt like it may have some minor pacing issues that don't really tank the movie but it might've helped to have certain scenes/sequences a bit tighter.Jericho Rosales makes up for not looking like Casey through his fantastic line deliveries and not breaking a sweat while embodying this fascinating gray area of a man. Confiado (loved his presence very extra this time), Eusebio, and Villanueva also give fantastic turns as mostly returning cast members while Kris Villanueve takes over Joven easily. I missed you in this one, Epy as Mabini.As the emphatic period to TBA Studios' highly impressive Bayaniverse trilogy, it felt appropriate enough to lean more into the Oppenheimer-esque epic tale as opposed to just giving us another Luna story. This is not an action-packed war flick but rather a captivating portrait of political power plays, American colonial dynamics, and the roots of so many of our problems today. I'm sure there's more to take away from it and I'm going to continue browsing the internet to find out what else - that's what makes this movie-loving thing so much fun.",2025-10-24,0,0,watch,True

sp4des_,10,"WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW.Can't believe that's the conclusion of the Bayaniverse trilogy, a mere transition from the violent Revolution to the ego-driven politics.From the epic and fierceness of Heneral Luna, from the heartbreak and beautiful sights of Goyo, now to the perception of heroism through Quezon.Echo really killed this role, alongside Sarmenta, Villanueva, Confiado, and Sir Iain Glen.He really is one helluva egoist ngl. Love the callbacks to the previous films, the flashback scenes of our previous leads, the callback to the ""Ang tao may damndamin ay hindi alipin."" scene and the fierce energy and the tons of PI and PYTA based from Heneral Luna, the quotes from Pule (Mabini) and the beautiful color grading from Goyo, and notable characters from the respective films!I feel like theres gonna be fanfics about 70 (Quezon x Osmeña). They had such chemistry in this film more than their spouses.Throughout the Bayaniverse, this just shows that in history, there are no heroes and villains, just humans with flaws. From each film, we learn about each characters' traits and flaws that are something we can learn from them. Like our fav character throughout the trilogy, Joven Hernando, we are the observants, observing the two sides of a coin of each sides. Our voice may be silent as we watch, but the truth and the voice we yearn for is loud.What a nice conclusion to the trilogy, thank you TBA and Direk Jerrold Tarog for giving us great movies that we can go back and learn all about our country's history.

Di ko makuha yung Joven vibes kahit nandito yung actor na gumanap sa last 2 movies. Isa pa, parang under utilized siya sa ending. Yung anak niyang si Nadia parang cutout from that era talaga. May vibes siyang ganon ang ganda ng pagkakacast. Di ko magets yung cameo ni Cong at Iza. Ang random.

No matter which angle you look at it, the film portrayed a negative and unflattering image of Quezon during his lifetime.From his beginnings as a lawyer, to his time as governor of Tayabas, Senate President, and eventually as President — the movie showed how deeply rooted traditional politics was, even back then. Maybe they were the ones who started it; the methods may have changed over time, but the goal remained the same — to gain and keep power.It’s hard to accept that our own ancestors might have been the ones who taught us how to become monsters in the world of politics — corrupt and power-hungry.

tuesjays,9,"“I got one more in me,” exclaimed Jerrold Tarrog as he laid the finishing touches of his 3rd film in this ironically-titled Bayaniverse.Wilfredo Garrido has this scathing accusation that Quezon in its entirety is a hackjob in itself. It's very easy to glean the bias from which his status update after watching the film errs on, and I feel the need to start from this note because by no means does the film really sit on the fence.In fact, and if I may declaratively highlight in all its fictional and non-fictional aspects, Quezon sits as one of Jerrold Tarog's best pieces for being able to angle this part of history in a way never really seen. The recurring clamor for a film that talks of the Philippine Commonwealth has been something desired of, and Quezon being able to position itself in this manner is a welcome one.At the end of the day, one is left sitting at Quezon and possibly thinking about how the Philippine government is fundamentally a government of demons of all shapes and sizes. If you come out of this film arguing that the film itself makes Aguinaldo look like a saint (someone on Twitter says this), you may want to rewatch Heneral Luna as the center of all this is a series of heroes who are profoundly individual at their core, espousing social values and claiming to be champions of the greater good.Addendun: Raymond Red during a talkback of his Bayani (1992) screening earlier recalls the uproar he faced from the academic community for being the first to depict Aguinaldo as a piece of shit. In a way, history corrects itself down the line and one could only glean that reception towards Quezon will face the same developments.",2025-10-26,3,1,watch,True
myavrse,10,"I had the chance to experience watching this film in the Cinemas. Jericho Rosales as Quezon didn't disappoint, as well as the other actors. I love cinematic scene shown at first, the silent film theme one made by Nadia where he was portrayed as a good guy for his campaign, even though the contents of it are far from truth and how we're watching from Joven's perspective because the contents of the film revisiting Quezon before entering politics and during it is all in a film made by Nadia, a second version with more truth contrasting what she had made for his Ninong for Presidential Campaign. My thoughts on this film is that they executed the film really well. It showed their flaws, not just their good side. I like Joven Hernando's character, he's a fictional character but represent us really well. All of his lines really aligns with what the audience thinks when watching the film. From supporting and believing Quezon to questioning him and eventually criticizing him. It also reminded me of how Schools always teach and portrayed them as great heroes, but never really show what's behind the door. Osmeña's character is someone easily swayed with sweet words and Quezon took advantage of that, leading, swaying him with his words even though they've had their own disputes—rivalry turned allies. Roxas's character is like a child, easy to be pawn. Quezon's character was portrayed as someone good at playing a game at politics, he knows how to play his cards very well; using every tactic and opportunities just like how he used Patriotism and Independence as a Propaganda. They also showed Quezon's side being a Womanizer and portrayed him as someone always concerned with good image in the public—although his bad side was shown, it still wouldn't erase the great things he did but it's refreshing to see that this film didn't glorify anyone. It instead showed that even these people in the end of the day are Humans. They're not perfect or saints, they have their own flaws. You can also see how our government back then still mirrors our present government. Corruption isn't new, it has always been there. There's a lot of things that you can realize watching this film, I wouldn't really rely on it for accuracy, after all it's mixed with fiction, myths and certain rumours for humour, that's why it's still better to research thoroughly. Overall this is a great film, Jerold Tarog and Tba Studios never disappoint!

Like wdym he's this selfish and cunning when it comes to power? I know for a fact na tuta naman talaga ang Commonwealth ng mga Amerikano noon pero it was really obvious how corruption and nepotism was implanted and it worsened until now.

I think determined na ganon ang mangyari sa kanya, kasaysayan na ang magdidikta. Kailangan maintindihan ng mga manonood na ito ay may halong fiction, may kahalong creative juices ng screen writers at ng direktor. It should be taken with a grain of salt.

THE SET DESIGN YUMYUMYUMThis whole thing is a MASTERPIECE. Although we must be careful of what it actually means. It does not try to cancel what Quezon has done or Quezon himself, rather show the other side of the coin (haha get it) of what it took for him to bring us to wherever he took us.

raychen03,8,"Body and soul?Jerold Tarog's ""Quezon"" narrates a period of our history that mirrors the current state of politics in the country. Men in power takes advantage of the other men in the circle and, when its not convenient anymore, easily, casually dropping them dead. History, almost 100 years ago, is repeating itself. The dirty tricks, power-hunger, and betrayal that happened under the Commonwealth government employed by President Quezon are not new to me. My history lessons, albeit shallow, have taught me that while we recognize the efforts of our forefathers, they were after all human and susceptible to corruption. It is politics afterall. What surprised me tho is how this part of the country's history was presented through this film. The cinematography, sound production, and set designs, and of course the acting (especially Jericho Rosales) were beautifully blended considering the theme of politics and history.

icanbeyouero,4,"After watching Quezon, I wondered: what was the director’s goal in this movie?While discussions suggest that the intention was to reveal the flawed person behind someone most people consider a hero, I can’t help but ask—then what? What did it aim to achieve after that?For me, it merely opened up a controversy without offering any resolution. It’s similar to hearing endless news about corruption in the country without actually seeing justice served. Has anyone even been jailed yet?After tarnishing Quezon’s name and linking him to the culture of political patronage and under-the-table negotiations, what was the movie really calling for? This is one of the things I find lacking in the film.I was also confused about Jericho’s acting choices and the director’s decisions regarding narration. I understand that comedy can be an effective way to deliver a message in a relatable manner, but to me, the message—still unclear—was blurred by the slapstick. Tarog's disclaimer at the beginning and his response to Quezon's grandchild also did not help in his attempt to convey his message.And really, is that an attempt to give redemption to Aguinaldo?",2025-10-25,3,0,watch,False

ad3ofc,7,"Wrapping up a trilogy about the Philippines' revolutionary past with a relatively uneventful political biopic about some unremarkably corrupt politician really is a bold and interesting choice. Moreover, Quezon really is a rejection of the two films that came before.By no fault of its own, Heneral Luna is one of the most misunderstood and bastardized cautionary tales about patriotism and masculinity I've seen in my lifetime. Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral is a bitter demolition of the mindless jingoism and fascism that Heneral Luna became synonymous with. Finally, Quezon is a eulogy to the Philippines' revolutionary hopes and idealism; a resignation to a pathetic country's inescapable doom under so-called Great Men and self-proclaimed patriots.Problem is, Quezon is also the weakest of the trilogy from a structural level. Its transition from a winking mockery of the cosmic joke that is Filipino government to the bleak demystification of Quezon's self-made myth isn't as smooth as it could've been. The film's dragging length is impossible to deny by the midway point, though it's understandable given how long Quezon's story is. Worst of all, a literal half of Quezon's dialogue is a preachy lecture told at the audience. More than once, characters stop everything to become mouthpieces for the ideologies they represent and the timely commentary they embody. None of this is diegetic, and it's as awkward as it sounds. I also don't really jive with how the film ends by blaming the Filipinos for things and bastards they can't control. I too am disillusioned, but come on now with this ivory tower shit.Then again, after seeing how Heneral Luna's point was deliberately ignored, used to prop up a murderous shithead, then basically losing a decade in the process, I'm not too surprised by Quezon treating Filipino viewers like a bunch of gullible idiots who need everything to be spoon-fed at least twice.",2025-10-25,1,0,watch,True

maropa,8,"2025 RankedTBA Studios RankedBACKGROUNDThis franchise is one of the most unique franchises out there by connecting Philippine historical films with each other into a singular cinematic universe, which is distinct from those that are fictional in nature. There are fictional elements in these films, but they are overall based on true events. It may not be as popular as other franchises that have existed for decades, but it does not have to be, considering that the number of movies are three so far. Regardless, it is still a franchise that I am going to look forward to for its next entry.POSITIVESThe gap between Quezon from the previous film, Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, is seven years, which could be a bit too long to wait, but it was worth it because I did not expect for the third installment to turn out to be the best in the franchise so far. The tone and style of filmmaking was different compared to its predecessors, which reflects how much Jerrold Tarog has grown as a filmmaker. The choice to use the early stages of film as a way to reflect and criticize him as a leader not only adds more creativity and style to the film but also reflects the phase of technology at the time, and how it can be used as a powerful tool to spread influence. The storytelling is not straightforward or linear, but it is organized into chapters based on who Manuel Quezon has to face or deal with in order to rise in power. It is an approach that I did not expect, but it is a success for being able to tell a cohesive story. Jericho Rosales's portrayal is one of the aspects that I was looking forward to seeing in the film, and he succeeded my expectations. He has so much command, control, and confidence in his performance. His enthusiasm and charisma match his goal to elevate his status by playing ""mind games"" with his opponents. This puts the audience in an unsettling position because it becomes clear the kind of leader Manuel Quezon was. There are moments that would make me feel the intensity and pressure as I am piecing out the next moves of each player and the events that could happen. The production design was impressive that made me wonder about how they were built or where they were located. I also admire the various use of cinematography like panning and tracking to make the film livelier and to set the tone.MIXEDI was really impressed by the editing of this film, but there is a particular scene where the editing did not work for me because I felt that it did not fit into its tone. This film has the most number of significant characters in the franchise and there are a lot of time jumps, which makes it a bit difficult to catch up with certain plotlines for me, but it is understandable because it reflects how complex and complicated the situations are.NEGATIVESDue to how plenty the characters are, some of them were not given enough depth. There are a few of lines of humor that did not work for me.CONCLUSIONIt is clear how the film wants Manuel Quezon to be portrayed, which they were able to accomplish. The tone and genre of this film may not be similar to the past films in the franchise like scenes involving gunshots, but its unique approach to the story makes it stand out from other Philippine historical films.",2025-10-25,1,0,watch,False

cjazalea,8,"Gets ko si Joven. When you sit down and watch the film as it starts, highly likely you will suddenly be reminded of how Heneral Luna and Goyo went—the first two movies of Bayaniverse—and your expectation would somehow be related to those two. But Tarog did a different approach in Quezon, where satire is ultimately obvious, as much as it is also intended to be taken seriously. The fast-pace approach, the quick-changing of scenes, the conversations which aren't dragging, and riddles exchanged between the characters. These same characters delivered well and Tarog made sure the comedic stance are appropriately placed where necessary. It's just that for the majority of the time, I have this moment where the scenes are already at its peak, only to be steered in a different direction since, clearly, this film wants to tell more. I guess 2 hours will never be enough. I've always admired how he interpreted Luna and Goyo in a way that is culturally and politically provoking, yet easy to grasp, relate to, and branches out even more questions. Looking back at the Quezon film, it’s hard not to realize how little we’ve actually progressed as a country. We never truly learned. We forget too easily, and us being gullible, though partly not our fault, continues to hold us back. That's why it's vital that a fictional character like Joven Hernando comes in as a storyteller. We need a narrator that subtly contributes to the narrative, yet obviously part of it. He witnessed three generations of it all, with his perspective changing and honing, and revolving with the three personalities - Luna, Goyo, and now, Quezon. We are Joven. And would you ever disagree with Joven knowing that to our core, he is the representation of us all?Joven proved that as a nation, we want change. But individually? We really just wanted to survive, to focus on our families, to build our career around the things we love doing the most. At the same time, we want to see our country thrive, see it receive its deserved peace and rightful independence. We believe it's ours to begin with and no one should take that away from us. That's how us, Filipinos. We struggle to keep moving as a progressive nation because our minds are cut in half—in many pieces for some—because we have a lot to think about. Sa dulo ng bawat araw, karamihan sa atin gusto lang umuwi, magpahinga, at siguraduhing kinabukasan ay may pagkaing nakahain sa lamesa. Kaya gets ko si Joven. Kung nalinlang man siya, kung napaniwala man siya nila Luna, Goyo, at Quezon, at kung kumapit man siya sa kakarampot na pag-asa mula dun sa tatlo, hindi niya naman talaga kasalanan. Gaya ng karamihan, nagtiwala lang din siya. Kasi sino bang aayaw sa pangakong kalayaan para sa isang bansang inaabuso at kumakalam ang sikmura?As film goers, audience, and product of PH education, our role is to scrutinize and be doubtful, along with enjoying the film, because at the end of the day, a film remains a form of art, and art supposedly have its interpretation by whoever is looking at it.
