jornauxdereine,8,"had the privilege to watch this last October 12 and let me just say that i enjoyed it very much.Manuel Quezon was the original politician of the Philippines. he knew how to control the people and how to get what he wants. i do believe he ran as a government official to help the Filipino people and gain independence from the Americans, but once you get a taste of fame, money, and power, those intentions can be easily forgotten. this movie came at the right time as it shows similarities on how our current government looks like. we are in the hands of fickle-minded politicians who only care about themselves. it's upsetting how even 90 years later we are still in the same mess. i always envy how other countries have better transportation systems, better work opportunities, and just better everything just because they were served by people who want real change in their country. still, i would never stop dreaming for real change in our country, and i feel that this movie gives hope to its viewers. amazing performances from everyone in the cast, the message/story was clear, and can't wait to support more Filipino-made movies!!",2025-10-14,4,0,watch,False
reeladvicenet,9,"Source: www.reeladvice.net/2025/10/quezon-2025-movie-review.htmlThe war is over, and now the battle is set in the world of politics. Quezon takes us front and center into the seemingly heroic life of Manuel L. Quezon - a personality Filipinos look up to as a hero, a visionary, and one of the nation’s key founders. But much like its predecessors in the Bayaniverse franchise, the film tackles head-on the sheer humanity and fallibility of Quezon, questioning whether the ends justify the means in the battlefield of power and the making of a young nation.Manuel L. Quezon (Jericho Rosales) has just won the 1935 elections, becoming the first elected Filipino president and the second president of the Philippines. But the journey to win that coveted and historically significant seat wasn’t an easy one, and you don’t get to the top without getting your hands dirty and making a few enemies along the way.On its third outing, the Bayaniverse comes full circle by slowly shifting from the action-packed Heneral Luna to a somber drama in Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral and finally to a full blown political drama in Quezon. The literal battles here are replaced by heated confrontations between Quezon and his contemporaries, showing how he fought and negotiated his way through power by any means necessary. While we can’t say for sure if every revelation in the film is historically accurate, this is far from the textbook version of Quezon we grew up with. This is a human Manuel Quezon up front and center. One who is charming, cunning, and deeply flawed. The film hits hard, especially when viewed against the backdrop of today’s political landscape, reminding us that the people we idolize are often far more complicated than their public images suggests.The film’s chapter-based narrative structure was something we appreciated, breaking down Quezon’s political battles into distinct segments. However, the pacing felt uneven at times, with one chapter taking up a disproportionate part of the runtime. In terms of performances, though, everyone delivered. Mon Confiado stood out as a somber, grounded Emilio Aguinaldo, while Jericho Rosales embodied Quezon’s ambition and deceitful charm perfectly. We found ourselves surprisingly invested in Quezon, and by the time the credits rolled, it hit us hard much like the other Bayaniverse films. Like before, it left questioning whether the struggles we face today were shaped by the same heroes we’ve long revered. As a potential bookend to the franchise, Quezon closes the trilogy in the way we hoped it would which is powerful, reflective, and important for Filipinos.",2025-10-13,3,0,watch,False

philbertdy,8,"I think it's really best to now see all three films as one long project, all of it built around the deconstruction of the national hero. It is through that lens that the character of Joven finally makes sense, the trilogy's audience surrogate who attaches himself to these larger-than-life figures, only to witness their downfall. Joven believes in the Great Man: in the singular figures that will lead our nation out of the darkness. The film openly exposes that idea as foolhardy at best, because these Great Men are just people, too. And they're all deeply flawed individuals that just get their dirty laundry swept under the bed precisely because they feel like they could be our saviors.This third film is practically a farce, with Rosales' Manuel L. Quezon treating nationhood as a rigged game where only he can come out on top. He blatantly lies to his friends when it's convenient to do so, and accumulates power through every dirty trick in the politician's playbook. He is the Ur-TRAPO, basically creating the systems that would make TRAPOs an inescapable reality in the Philippines.Rosales is terrific here, his Quezon constantly performing for whoever's in front of him. He projects being a loyal ally, or a mentor, or a friend, or indeed the great savior of the Philippines. He plays that big, while in private moments Quezon is all vulnerability: a man who sees how delicate the house of cards he's built is, and worries about whether his health will allow him to see his dreams come to fruition.I do think the film has a tendency to overexplain, to have characters speaking the subtext out loud. But considering how some people took Heneral Luna, maybe this was always the tack to take. In any case, the film is unequivocal with how it wants us to see Quezon: he is what Chiz Escudero wants to be, and maybe what made Chiz Escudero possible. Welcome to our Sad Republic. Here's the guy that made it happen.",2025-10-15,448,3,watch,True
reyraymundv,8,"One McGuffin in the film is a Philippine peso coin that Quezon offers Joven the first time they meet. Quezon tells Joven, “pasisikatin ko ang pangalan mo,” “I will make your name famous.” It is offered as a symbol of promise. Later in the film, we understand that Quezon is a businessman and how we sees his wits as he steers money into his electoral campaign. Quezon knows how to invest in the hearts of the people he influences. He fully understands the weakness of Filipinos when it comes to “utang na loob” or debt of gratitude. We see this coin move between Quezon and Joven. Joven, who later finds out Quezon’s dirty tricks, returns the coin. In the last act, the coin is returned, becoming a powerful metaphor for the cost Filipinos pay when voting for leaders who manipulate their perception.Quezon is intriguing, comical at times, but otherwise compelling in that you’re hypnotized and drawn to the flipping of Quezon’s coin, who is on one side a hero, and on the other a flawed human being. We see him as a player, incisive in his chess pieces in Philippine politics. But also a sociopath when he deals with his cards in a game of poker with his enemies. The dialogue in the film never lets up, with pacing that keeps you glued to your seat. The film makes you love-hate the man, and Jericho Rosales’ performance stands out, supported by an impressive powerhouse cast.Overall, the film is witty and entertaining. The political play may be on the nose, but should not alienate a regular Filipino moviegoer. And should be able to provide a proper dissection of the politicians we placed in their positions, and a wake-up call to vote better in the next elections.see video version on Tiktok or Instagram @reyraymundv",2025-10-13,25,0,watch,True

ica_cheng,8,"The Bayaniverse films have always been about showing how these heroes, whom we have put up on a pedestal, are in reality very flawed humans as well. With ‘Quezon’ we not only see a very flawed human, but one that could have possibly set up the many political systems in play today. Jericho Rosales who plays the titular chameleon ‘Quezon’ brings his A game to the role. You can see his range with Quezon’s cunning smiles, and explosive anger. The entire cast is a powerhouse one as well, bringing their own strengths to their characters. Technically, I was impressed by how the film was shot, employing black and white film work to mimic films from the 1930s. The production design was also on point with the props and costumes used, even the set pieces were impressive. The story itself shows how Quezon, who might be seen as a hero, has some skeletons in his own closet, and even had some strings pulled to help his rise to power, the reveal is a treat, and even though this is already history, there was a scene where I had to hold my breath.",2025-10-13,2,0,watch,False
kapengmukha,8,"I had the privilege of watching “Quezon” last Sunday.The film in some way, gave me closure about what our politics are today—though not the good kind of closure.I remember during the last elections, one of my professors was kind enough to ask the whole class how we were holding up. Of course, we felt cheated, beaten. When I returned the question to him, he sighed and said, “Well, sanay na kami.”Watching Quezon, that statement makes even more sense. The film is a mirror—almost like a satire—protesting to our faces what we’ve been enduring for years.We’re all familiar with the Filipino game of politics (brought to life first by our colonizers, if I may add), but seeing it up close through this film is heartbreaking.We are being played by our politicians, and though we feel it deeply today, it’s something that has persisted for years.

This film was certainly not romanticized nor haigographic.

dicotalvarado,9,"A pretty compelling dissection of the messiness of politics. Mind you there's some bits here I would have loved to have seen pared down-- some speeches here often read as plain and didactic as thesis statements and some visuals come across as painfully obvious. There's a lot of reiteration of the theme of games being played here in the pull for power, even down to, in one scene, a clear chessboard referenced in both dialogue and image in a moment of Quezon's play for power and assembly of political pieces. And to be honest, the whole idea of politics being a game is something that simply comes across as trite (I mean, there is already a biopic out there that exists called Quezon's Game).At the same time, you have to admire the ambition of just implementing those ideas so clearly on levels of craft and storytelling. On the whole this is a sumptuously put together film that manages to make a whole lot of talking deeply delightful. This is especially remarkable considering that A. Dialogue-heavy films can easily bore if pulled off improperly and B. Quezon as a person is a character that, in actuality, should come across as deeply uncompelling due to how awful he actually is as a person-- which the film does not shy away from. To tackle the former, some truly astounding filmmaking is on full display here, really playfully swinging that camera and injecting a constant sense of energy through the movement of visuals. And for the latter, this is simply a sharp, wise, and surprisingly comedic script that really sells in its details. Manuel Quezon ultimately is a mess of a human being, but the film really has a lot of fun examining how this man claimed power instead of resigning to singing praises on who this powerful person is. It becomes truly engaging, even clever as a film that dissects a man who is gifted and unmatched at negotiation and talking but ultimately is still acknowledged as deeply problematic. Other than that, the performances here really do a lot of heavy-lifting as well. Rosales makes a full meal of the material, really exuding effortless and entertaining charm. Confiado controls the screen whenever he appears. Ultimately, this is simply a delight to watch through and through. Which is pretty astounding for a film that is essentially just about a bunch of politicians bickering. Hey, tale as old as time.",2025-10-15,13,0,watch,True

christian_davao,8,"Quezon (Jerrold Tarog, 2025) culminates the Bayani Trilogy that started with Heneral Luna and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral. The trilogy examines three historical (and controversial) figures who helped in fleshing out our concept of a nation under tyrannical colonial rule. In this film, Manuel L. Quezon comes alive as a fierce politician who would stop at nothing to fulfill his ambition which is not to serve but to lead. He destroyed reputations and livelihoods of opponents and critics and possible nurtured the budding seeds of patronage politics which is still practiced contemporaneously. He loved the limelight (at some point, even literally), thrived in public attention, and treated the people in his circle depending on how useful they would be for his advancement. Public service is immaterial as long as benefits come pouring in.Jericho Rosales played Quezon with such aplomb and vigor that you couldn't help but be irritated at his antics. He is good. I had initial reservations when he was cast but I realized he was a good fit and he played the role well. He owns the screen every time he is on which could be reminiscent of how the real Quezon chews the scenery whenever he could. The film is a good reminder of how devious politicians could be and how easily can we be blinded by adoration even if we should have known better. If anything, this film posits that politicians come and go but our country remains and therefore, our faith should be placed on people who would serve it the best.

jansol,8,"The finale (or is it?) to Jerrold Tarog’s ongoing thesis on what it means to be a national hero cleverly frames the retelling of the titular character’s life as a film within a film, one that’s purposefully laden with creative license and narrative freedom — blending truth and fiction to get its themes across (or, depending on your politics, to serve as propaganda or a fluff piece). It’s fitting, then, that the final confrontation between the real-life character and the fictional surrogate who’s been our audience stand-in since the start of this interconnected project takes place inside a movie theater — the very medium through which myths are made.The film — and its film-within-the-film (yes, it gets that meta) — traces Quezon’s journey from his beginnings as part of the revolutionary army, to his days as a lawyer of the people, to his rise from local town governor to the first president of an autonomous Philippine government, free from direct foreign control. Each retelling presents not so much the man himself, but how he wanted to be remembered: as a patriot, a reformist, a visionary — or perhaps just a man intoxicated by the idea of power.We see a Quezon who thirsts not only for independence but also for control — and at times, for affairs and questionable advances — justifying the bending of truths and the moral grayness of politics as necessary evils to “effect real change.” He preaches independence to a populace not yet aware of what it truly means, wielding the idea as a political tool. Even when confronted by findings that autonomy may have come too soon — that corruption and cronyism were inevitable — he presses on, clinging to power in the name of progress.The production design is remarkable, a clear step up in scale and ambition — grand, intricate, and indicative of a much higher budget. Tarog’s decision to divide the film into cinematic “chapters” gives it an epic sweep, though it also makes the storytelling feel jumpy at times, leaving certain emotional and narrative threads unresolved. The script leans a bit too heavily on exposition, and the occasional bursts of humor sometimes undercut the otherwise serious tone.Still, Quezon (2025) succeeds where it matters most: in driving home its central theme — that our so-called national heroes, for all their grandeur and idealism, were also deeply flawed, morally ambiguous men shaped by ambition and compromise. It leaves us with a haunting question that lingers long after the credits roll:Are our political leaders — past and present — truly heroes, or simply the kind of villains we’ve learned to celebrate?",2025-10-15,1,0,watch,False

bcd2114,,"I'm still not convinced that we need a film about Quezon because he is so bland as a greedy populist political figure that any attempt to explore him will be preachy and on-the-nose, relentlessly hammering the problem with the current zeitgeist with little catharsis. It entailed a perilous narrow line between portraying him as a brilliant charismatic political mastermind or a typical power hungry politician who reflect most public servant in the government today that they framed this story with journalists and filmmakers who would provide the commentary for the audience. It was looking at the eponymous protagonist from a distance, dissecting his essence and stripping him of all subjectivity, but it was also not presented objectively since they needed to ensure that the audience would not receive the wrong message, so more telegraphed commentary from the minor character. They should have simply written an informative paper discussion instead of making a film about the subject, because they had a lot to say but no compelling story to tell. It was so disorganized narratively that halfway through the film, it was difficult to tell where it was meant to go, and at least three elderly audience members were sleeping and snoring loudly from my theater.The visual language utilized in this movie is quite odd, most likely because they are unable to find a mean to convey the screenplay in a cinematic or visually appealing manner. It kept repeating the same shots and camera movements, which grew tedious at some point given the scale and time period it meant to communicate. There are too many tilt and boom shots, and the blocking tends to follow a formalism with a lot of symmetrical orientation that looked so theatrical with the camera slowly moving in, even though they desperately needed dynamic filmmaking to hide the limited production design. It relied on theatricality to pull this off, and even the performances adapt that theatrical mechanics where it devolved into actors yelling their dialogue, which was noticeable with the pitch of the sound, prompting me to be conscious with the sound system to see whether the problem was with the theater or the sound mixing itself. Not to nitpick the technical filmmaking further, but the way they filmed those propaganda short films looked too modern for the time period, and not because they were shot with a digital camera, which is totally understandable for budgetary purposes and accessibility of equipment, but they were edited and lit with a modern sensibility. Nonetheless, the intent of those short films narratively was rather intriguing since I'm pretty sure they were fictional and only used as a narrative device for the commentary. It was trying to offer that film within a film structure, peeling away the propaganda, but it just became too on-the-nose and a convenient excuse for their chosen narrative structure. They should have adopted a traditional narrative approach for this film since it would have been more compelling to show that point-of-view as Quezon rose and fell, with all of his hypocrisy and politicking, but doing so could have humanized the protagonist to the point that the audience would love him. It was a tricky film to make, and I appreciate that it did not humanize or glorify Quezon as an anti-hero at all, but it grew monotonous and painfully obvious when it could have been more mean-spirited and nuanced. I am so familiar with Quezon's political career that I was able to follow all of the political strife in the film, which made me upset since it seemed like I was reading my notes from my history class rather than following a cohesive narrative. However, I'm not sure what an audience unfamiliar with the subject matter can take away from this film, which moves from one battle after another with far too many expositions. It was bombastic and loaded with information, and without knowing the significance and relationship of each character, along with the political backdrop around the time, it will probably be alienating for others. It was still able to deliver some of the story in an innovative way, notably the Quezon versus Osmena fight, which is the most visually interesting, easy-to-follow and entertaining story throughout the film. It is actually impressive how it created a pace and tone that made sense for what it was trying to do narratively.Lastly, I want to discuss the Aguinaldo aspect, which was jarring since it nearly made him likable and probably the protagonist of this film, despite having a far worse reputation than most national heroes. It further claims that Quezon invented the beliefs that Aguinaldo killed Luna. It was strange since the film rehabilitated him with a title credit that celebrated how he is the last one to die among Quezon, Osmena and Roxas. Are we expected to feel bad for him? I don't know about that, and the way it was dramatized at the end makes it seem like we were wrong to hate him all along. Aside from being a nepo baby, I believe he tried to sold the Philippines revolution to the Spaniards in exchange for an exile in Hong Kong and allegedly 800,000 that is supposed to be handed in two parts, one of which were delivered but the other half was not, so he resumed the revolution. It almost feels like it was gaslighting the audience, but it was more likely illustrating that Quezon is beloved when he is actually worse.**Endnote: How dare them not to mention Pascual Racuyal, the bulakenyo mechanic who run for presidency every election from 1935 until the snap election during 1986?",2025-10-15,11,1,watch,False

xiehua07,10,"First Time Watcher! I have not watched any other films in the bayaniverse trilogy and this was my first. Safe to say I may look into them because I LOVED THIS! Everything works together so well — from the casting, music choices, filming perspectives, editing style, characters, and writing. Everyone who worked in this you deserve every piece of credit 🤍Not only does this depict how despicable Quezon was as a politician but even applies to the current state of Philippine politics and how politicians work to gain power. A friend who has watched the films in the bayaniverse told me this was a more “light” film compared to the other ones already released and that depicts a lot from Quezon’s character, a charismatic leader. I really enjoyed the campaign video having Quezon’s achievements and the alternative one showcasing the steps he took and people he conflicted with to be the man he is. And Jericho Rosales as Quezon? It works so well! The casting they do is so great and loved it a lot. Though I wish they didn’t picture Aguinaldo in a pitiful aspect since he has his fair share of dirt. Overall, a great cinematic masterpiece because I could apply my knowledge of politics and governance 😭🤍 Quezon may have had his lies and manipulation tactics, but he was right about how beautiful the film industry will be and still is. This film is solid proof to it. Great job to the people who worked on this!! Your art is loved!",2025-10-15,1,0,watch,True

itsjustarcher,8,"“I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by the Americans, because however a bad Filipino government might be, we can always change it.” -Manuel L. Quezon, 1939Well we did it Quezon, we're now living in a country run like hell by Filipinos, like you said. Not sure how that last part of the quote will fare out, but let's hope it'll ring true at some point. Quezon is yet again another substantive display of one of the Philippine's most important historical figures. Following Heneral Luna and Goyo, this is Jerrold Tarog's third attempt of this kind of historical drama that puts these historical figures on the spotlight in a way that provides discourse on the political state of the Philippines during their time; a discourse of which that's unfortunately relevant to this day. As opposed to both Antonio Luna and Gregorio Del Pilar, who were generals, this film focuses on Manuel L. Quezon, a prominent Filipino political figure in the early 20th century (the 2nd Philippine President, specifically). While he's more known in the history books (or at least how I was taught in school) as someone who made changes in the Philippine government to make the nation more independent, the movie gives a transparent perspective of his rise to Presidency in both a positive light and negative light, the latter of which is shown in the misdeeds and manipulation he did behind the scenes in order to gain his power. It's come to the point where the interactions feel so Mean Girls-coded, in a sense where Filipino political affairs feel so parallel to high-school drama, where people try to one-up themselves over others in the political game of seeing whoever takes the highest form of power. It's funny to think about at first, but it's much more depressing if you really put your mind to it; Filipino politicians have never really gotten past this political game for power that it's still very much relevant to this day. Instead of addressing the actual issues in the country like the lack of education, proper infrastructure, and better living conditions for the lower class, you see Quezon do a lot of back-and-forth between his opponents and other people just to retain his position. And when he does interact with the lower class, he instills this fake hope in the independence of the Filipino nation, which sounds so good that even those who don't know what the word ""independence"" actually means were sold by his charismatic and inspiring words. Though Quezon has done a lot of good for the country, the film shows just how flawed he is, and how we shouldn't just take the positive impact he had, but also take in his wrongdoings as a view on the saddening reality of politics. There's a recurring motif of characters being tired of all the back-and-forth interactions that lead to nothing productive, which feels very reflective of how the director Jerrold Tarog feels about modern Filipino politics; he's tired of his more subtle approach in his two aforementioned films that he tackles the topic in this film in a more straightforward way.As a result, the film can get preachy and waaaaay too obvious in its approach to this topic, which throws subtlety out of the way. But I understand how this is done intentionally to really get the point across, especially to the young Filipino viewers who will be watching this and be urged by educators in doing so, especially through the student discounts (of which I got, because I'm still in college lol). Normally, I'd be against this obvious approach in such an important topic, but seeing that it intends on educating the Filipino youth regarding the political state of the country, and seeing how poor the reading and art comprehension are of most Filipinos, I can forgive the film for this. It has a lot of good things to say, albeit there were some inaccuracies here and there, though they were done for a more cohesive narrative and theme throughout. Jericho Rosales gave a really good performance as the titular character, Iain Glenn was a standout to me, despite his considerably short appearance, and there weren't any bad actors in this at all. Tarog's direction was quite good, the pacing was always on point and never got boring, the cinematography was mostly great, and the production and set design were so insanely well done and there was a lot of attention to detail. Though the editing can sometimes be jarring and the music gets a bit overbearing at times, the film was still really good overall. Really hope that the students watching this film will take the good out of the film and be inspired to become the change that we need in the Philippines, especially since the future isn't looking so bright for our country. I liked Lav Diaz's Magellan, but honestly I wish this were picked as the entry to the Oscars for Best Foreign Film instead. This was a much more accessible film that will definitely speak to a lot of Filipinos and will definitely leave a lasting impact to Filipinos much more than Magellan did. Not saying that the entry should be chosen based on accessibility, but rather, it should be chosen based on how important it is in representing the country's cinema as a whole, and this was a great representation for our country's cinema and our history. Sorry Lav Diaz, still love you tho king. 😙🫶Films in 2025My ranking of Tarog's trilogy:Heneral Luna > Quezon > Goyo",2025-10-15,4,0,watch,True

kaylheen,9,"First of all, Jericho Rosales is such a great actor — his acting totally mogged Mon Confiado’s, and that’s impressive because Mon never fails to amaze me even now.Next, I honestly didn’t expect the plot to go that way. I had no idea it was about Quezon’s dirty politics and the manipulative things he did to get the people he needed on his side.This movie really shows that behind every successful politician, there’s always something hidden. It’s also interesting how school never really told us about Quezon’s wrongdoings — just that he gave the Philippines its independence and the other good stuff. They never mentioned the questionable stuff behind it. Quezon’s a funny character though; he’s like that one confident, good-looking classmate who cracks jokes and somehow always has everyone’s attention.At first, I wasn’t into the movie — it didn’t seem catchy. But I’m glad I stayed until the end because it was worth watching. Not just because of CongTV, who honestly felt a bit random and unnecessary. I also don’t get the hype about Aguinaldo’s supposed innocence when there’s really nothing to be innocent anout. Quezon was totally right about Joven’s hypocrisy too.

reviewsbyrich,8,"A sharp, smart, and playful deconstruction of The Life of a Showman.It's all for show. A call for Independence. A promising election campaign. A mythmaking agenda built on propaganda. That's the thing about politicians—they act, project, and perform for everyone. QUEZON is a timely & grim reminder that virtually nothing has changed over the last 100 years in our padrino & utang na loob ecosystem. In between political breakups and unnecessary theatrics, the country remains a farce governed by clowns. The film nudges the audience to see through the web of lies.What QUEZON also achieves brilliantly is turning political maneuverings into a compelling drama through a kinetic screenplay, smoothly switching from a frame story, to an analepsis, to its current timeline. Think Succession, but set in Malacañang.The newspaper montage works as an effective storytelling device, grounding its viewers to the historical context. It tends to overexplain and simplify its message but in an age where satire is a dying art, this may be the way to make its point crystal clear. The dynamic blocking, characters walking ahead or standing a tier higher, are used to convey fragile egos, shifting alliances, and subtle power plays.Jericho Rosales is simply terrific, inhabiting the role with such bold, infectious energy. Jerrold Tarog skillfully balances tone and themes, providing a fresh way to tackle a historical drama. The ensemble is stellar across the board, with everyone getting their moment. Karylle, with limited screentime, leaves a lasting impression. She’s often seated while Quezon towers above, until a full-circle moment where life throws a reminder that power, like fate and politics, always turns like a wheel.Entertaining & thought-provoking, QUEZON is a fitting conclusion to the Bayaniverse trilogy. Brush up with your high school history knowledge to achieve a richer experience. TBA Studios should be proud of this, especially with its grand production that’s 100% deserving of the big screen.

It’s wild because you know you’re supposed to be enticed by his noble lies, even while you can see the calculating political games happening behind all that famous charisma.And that's exactly why I love how this is so out of the box with how it was directed.

That was everything that gave me goosebumps all throughout the second half of the film! It delivers the film’s devastating thesis by explicitly showing us the dirty politic framework Quezon has basically founded in this country, which we suffer to experience to this day.That face-off of Quezon and Aguinaldo?

carlcarreon,10,"It's funny how this movie, even with all its fictional creative freedom, perfectly mirrors the political realities of the Philippines today. Jerrold Tarog doesn't just present a history lesson, he offers a raw, unflinching look at the budding Philippine government in a way that contemporary audiences should study closely. The film makes it brutally clear that this country's foundation wasn't laid purely with high ideals and patriotism, but was instead built on a messy combination of greed, manipulation, betrayal, and the relentless pursuit of power.What truly stings was the realization that after decades upon decades of supposed journey toward claiming true independence and stability, we always seem to cycle back to the same messy politics, just in a different font and under new names. And at the center of this perpetually recurring drama, the film powerfully argues, is a key player silently pulling the strings, moving the local pawns for their own geopolitical gain: the Americans. The film's narrative highlights how foreign interests often shaped the domestic landscape, making us question who are our true allies and enemies.This is uncomfortably sad, but Quezon is beyond a mere entertainment affair. It’s not just a historical drama but rather an outcry of what we have become as a nation, especially how we form our opinions with blind idolatry in mind, just like how Quezon blindly idolizes himself of what he thought he was, and that in itself is alarming.",2025-10-15,22,0,watch,True

cmdmngn,9,"“Masyadong maraming politiko sa bansa. Kaunti lang ang lingkod bayan”I wish we all had a lens clear enough to see what truly drives every politician when they chase power.Watching how Quezon played with the emotions of those around him, with position and power, I couldn’t help but wonder: maybe deception has long been ingrained in what it means to be Filipino. Maybe we’ve always been “mabilis mabilog” and “magaling mambilog”. This is where the cycle started, and no doubt why it still continues. It’s a system like a game with set mechanics—only the players change, and the tricks evolve.The film itself is incredible. There’s a sense of power here that’s difficult to explain and an emotional pull so strong you can’t decide whose side you’re on, because each character’s truth unfolds with raw honesty. You see their flaws, their desires, and how their ideals clash for the same country. Oh and i love how Tarog uses cinema and journalism as tools of truth. The transitions, the way history is woven through reels of film, are brilliant. The color palette alone tells a story—Quezon bathed in rich, vivid hues, while Aguinaldo fades into muted tones. And the score! Haha. The circus-like and chaotic score is perfect reflection of the madness, the spectacle that politics has always been. Ang husay. The cast is insane, and I couldn’t be more proud because wow..such a powerful ensemble of artists.Jerrold Tarog is bold and fearless, and such a great storyteller.By the end of the film, I found myself asking: Will this game ever end?

Bagay Kay Karylle ang role na Aurora Quezon!The cinematography is good, the set design is perfect! It feels like I was transported to the Commonwealth era! The story focuses on the rise to power of Quezon but I wish they also featured his early life like his lovestory with Aurora, exciting story Sana yun since they were cousins (Yes!) and also I wish nabigyan din ng highlight si Dona Aurora since she's a vital character in Quezon's life and to the history of the Philippines, Quezon was told in a non linear storytelling and sometimes I got confused if the scene is a backstory, or a scene to Nadia's movie or a scene in the present time, may blur yun department na yun and how I wish it was polished!After watching the movie as I leave the cinemas, mapapaisip ka, bakit sa Kabila ng lahat, mula noon hanggang ngayon, why are we still electing trapo leaders?

heyrow,,"It’s always a peculiar experience watching a Jerrold Tarog film. There’s a quiet unease that comes with it. Maybe it’s because I’ve followed his work long enough to know he never really plays it safe; every film feels like a balancing act between vision and vulnerability. I know he’s not flawless, and neither are his films, even the ones I hold close (Confessional, Senior Year, Bliss). But there’s something about the way he tells stories that always feels searching and alive. He’s never been after polish (and sometimes that’s the most frustrating part of his cinema) but he’s always been after answers. New answers to the kind of questions only a history geek would ask in the shower. So whenever I enter a Direk Jerrold film, I brace, because I know it might reveal something I wasn’t ready to see about us, or about what we’ve become.Of all the BAYANIVerse films, QUEZON feels the most adventurous — not in scale, but in spirit. It’s Direk Jerrold’s boldest experiment in this saga: a film that knows it’s a film. He borrows from Mike de León’s Bayaning Third World, playing with the grammar of cinema itself: reenactments, reconstructions, meta-frames. The satire is there, but softer now, as if Direk Jerrold has accepted that to film history is to fictionalize it. Every frame of patriotism is, by nature, a kind of performance.What’s interesting is how Quezon almost feels like a return to where Direk Jerrold began: to the heart of his first feature Confessional. That film was all about guilt and exposure. It blurred the line between truth and performance, between what’s real and what’s edited for the camera. Quezon carries that same unease, only now the canvas is larger: not one man’s confession, but an entire nation’s. It’s still about projection; about editing who we say we are. In both films, Direk Jerrold wrestles with the same dilemma: that the story of the country, like the story of the self, is always partly fabricated. The distance between public myth and private truth isn’t new to him; it’s the ground he’s been standing on all along.The beginning, though, is difficult. It unfolds like an essay: brisk, detached, almost indifferent to its own characters. We’re given on-screen identifiers to remember names, but no real reason to care about them yet. It’s matter-of-fact to the point of numbness. And while I understand the intention — that deliberate coldness, that resistance to sentimentality — it keeps me at a distance. Maybe that’s the point: that our first encounter with history is always sterile, a list of names before they become people. But it’s still a hard place to start for a film that ultimately depends on emotional investment. If the audience doesn’t feel invited in, the ideas risk floating above the story, detached from the very humanity they’re trying to illuminate. It’s a fascinating gamble: to alienate first, and hope empathy arrives later.Eventually, it warms. Theory turns into theater: infidelity, betrayal, the exhausting pettiness of ambition. The shift happens quietly, and suddenly, these figures in textbooks begin to ache, to resent, to want. The sarcasm becomes sorrow. Direk Jerrold lets Quezon’s charisma clash with his contradictions, and the film begins to reveal what the trilogy has been circling all along: that our heroes were never saints, just men rehearsing greatness for a stage called history.Still, Quezon is uneven in texture. It moves between stylization and realism so freely that the seams sometimes show. One moment it looks painterly, the next like something out of a morning kiddie show. Some transitions feel deliberate; others feel like accidents. At times I even caught myself wondering — is this stylized, or a little off? But at some point, the film begins to carry those inconsistencies as part of its design. The tone itself becomes a kind of argument: that history, like cinema, is never seamless. Its rough edges start to feel less like errors and more like evidence: that the story of a nation is always told through competing frames, through sincerity and performance, myth and memory all bleeding into one another.It’s also the most intimate of the trilogy, and paradoxically, the smallest. The 1935 election feels less like a historical event and more like a town contest, the scale reduced to smoke-filled rooms, small plaza gatherings, and even smaller street marches. But maybe that’s where politics truly happens: not on the battlefield, but in the room where stories are shaped or in those short walks in between campaign speeches. The Philippines, Direk Jerrold seems to say, wasn’t born in fire but in fog — not through heroism, but through negotiation. He shrinks the myth to scale, and somehow that feels truer.Jericho Rosales is remarkable. His Quezon is a performer to his bones: charming, strategic, aware that every gesture is part of a show. It’s a portrayal that understands leadership as theater. But it’s Karylle as Aurora Quezon and Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña who give the film its soul probably because I believe they are able to play characters that are also written better. They play the roles history often edits out — the ones who absorb power’s aftershocks. Their warmth gives the film the emotional gravity that its cleverness sometimes withholds.And the film is funny! Not that it’s a surprise, since the trailers already gave that away. But what’s interesting is how the humor works; it never feels forced. In all the politics of it all, the humor really lands. You laugh, but it’s the kind of laughter that feels like recognition — the ache of realizing how cyclical our myths have become. Watching Quezon today, it’s hard not to see the reflection: new leaders, same spectacle, the same applause for the illusion of change. The crowd has changed, but the choreography hasn’t. Politics has always been performance; we’ve just upgraded the stage lights.[SPOILER ALERT]What makes Quezon linger though isn’t how it ends, but how it fades. In a quiet mid-credits scene, a radio hums with “Mambo Magsaysay.” It sounds harmless at first, even nostalgic, until it sinks in. The trilogy that began with men dying for freedom ends with a jingle: a hero reborn not through valor, but through publicity. The revolution has learned rhythm; the myth, melody. What began in blood and fire now survives through broadcast. Heroism no longer dies; it loops endlessly on air, selling itself back to a nation that keeps forgetting.Maybe that’s Direk Jerrold’s quiet brilliance. Heneral Luna was about rage — the passion that builds nations. Goyo was about disillusionment — how conviction collapses once heroism becomes habit. Quezon is about myth — how belief turns into image, and image into machinery. It’s not just the end of a trilogy; it’s the moment when the revolution becomes a system. Because Quezon, for all his brilliance, also built the architecture of the politics we still live in: the patronage, the alliances, the transactional warmth that makes power feel personal but never equal. The birth of democracy was also the birth of dependency.And if the hinted Magsaysay film ever comes, then it will tell the story of how that system learned to sing. Because Magsaysay was the first modern president sold like an idea — a leader branded through music, charisma, and American approval. His legacy marks the shift from politics as negotiation to politics as emotion. If Luna died for the nation, and Quezon built it, then Magsaysay would show how the nation learned to perform itself — how conviction turned into choreography, leadership into branding, and the state into a stage where power thrives not by being just, but by looking relatable.The question now isn’t “Who is the hero?” but “Who’s holding the camera — and for which story, for whose gain, and at what cost to the truth?”",2025-10-15,6,0,watch,True

reyview,8,"The long-awaited final chapter in the Bayaniverse trilogy brilliantly shifts gears from the battlefield to the backroom, immersing us in the ruthless political game that defined the early Philippine Commonwealth. If nothing else, it shows that 100 years ago marumi na ang pulitika sa Pilipinas. The story is eerily reminiscent of the current political landscape na kung sinabi mo sakin na last month lang sinulat at ginawa to, pwedeng maniwala ako.Director Jerrold Tarog, once again, doesn't offer a statue but a scalpel, dissecting the myth of Manuel L. Quezon. This film is a compelling, dialogue-driven epic that strips away the heroic luster to reveal the manipulative acumen, charm, and sheer ambition required to forge a nation. It’s a messy portrait that feels urgently relevant, proving that the high drama of power politics can be as engrossing as any war epic.For me, the performances elevate the entire experience. Jericho Rosales is genuinely great in the titular role; he captures the former President's fire and charisma while still managing to hint at the deep contradictions beneath the tailored suits. However, this is truly an ensemble piece, and Romnick Sarmenta (as Sergio Osmeña) and Mon Confiado (reprising Aguinaldo) also shine, providing compelling foils and complexity. They make the political chess feel weighty and personal. Game of Thrones alum Iain Glen is a welcome and commanding presence, though I have to admit, his very distinct British accent occasionally pulls me out of the moment because he’s playing an American character - but maybe that’s just me being picky.I genuinely admire and respect the approach that Jerrold Tarog and team chose for this movie. A simpler but probably more boring version of this would be a straight up biopic that mythologizes Quezon. That being said, I sincerely hope our audiences are truly ready for a treatment of a national subject such as this, one that so meticulously deconstructs the idea of a great man. It requires a level of critical historical consumption that can sometimes be lacking. This film isn't just a history lesson; it's a call for discernment, and I hope Pinoys are able to understand and grapple with the deeper message it provides.My worst fear, and what keeps me thinking about the film's potential impact, is for people to come out of this movie with a shallow understanding—with the notion that all politicians are fundamentally flawed, so it's okay to support the corrupt ones they are currently ""fans"" of. I have this suspicion that when some people saw Heneral Luna, ang takeaway nila ay “Kita mo na! Kaya okay lang yung matapang tsaka palamura e” rather than the bigger and more important lessons that the movie tried to impart about nationalism.Quezon shows complexity, not blanket moral equivalence. It shows a flawed man achieving monumental goals, but critically examines the cost. It is a brilliant and challenging piece of filmmaking with terrific performances from the cast.

xaviercomplex,7,"I’ve always loved antihero narratives, and Quezon fits that mold perfectly. The film illustrates how populism can bring one to power. It skirted on a single word, ""independence"", and forces you to ask what it has ever truly meant. After all, the government we have now is the same one we’ve always had, merely dressed in different fashions for each generation.But where the film stumbles is in telling historical facts. Too much of its narrative hinges on the fictional character Joven Hernando and his descent into Quezon’s pitfall of populism and cronyism. This might have worked if Quezon were intended as historical fiction. But it's not. It focused too much on Joven’s disillusionment and Quezon’s perspective that it glossed over factual events a historical film should have covered.Overall, the film was both compelling and timely. I only hope we finally learn not to mistake charisma with integrity. Lies and manipulations, however noble the cause, are always self-serving. In a nation built on lies, speaking the truth is the greatest act of defiance. When will we ever learn? Only history can tell.

jasonrcf,6,"It's odd that a film so much about a man who campaigned on national independence, whose supposed saving grace is that he ultimately did bring it about, says so little about what that independence even meant. This film adds nothing to the discourse of national independence.This is another glossy entry to Jerrold Tarog’s “Bayani-verse” series of films, which some have described as an attempt to deconstruct the Philippine national hero. It's the most fictionalized of the three*. And it's another one that gets worse the more you think about it. Hopefully it’s the last, as they say, for I have no interest in seeing another one of these movies about Ramon Magsaysay. My biggest issue with this film in particular is that it subsists so much on the surface of its subject matter that it fails to say anything interesting about the context in which its events occur. What does it actually say about the 50-year American occupation of the Philippines? What does it actually say about Manuel Quezon as a president? As a leader of the country? What does it say about how everyday Filipinos experienced his rule? Does it say anything at all?It's mostly about Manuel Quezon as a politician, or more so, how he performs politics. It's about his two-facedness, his scrupulousness, his constant need to one-up his political opponents at any chance he gets. The film successfully contextualizes the absurd spectacle of 21st century politics by telling us that its roots go back to the very inception of our political independence nearly a century ago. But this is also where the film's issues lie.The film appears to critique Quezon for how he participated in and fine-tuned the garish spectacle of modern political campaigning, of setting the stage for our present day election cycles. But despite the film’s acknowledgment of the shallowness of these tactics, it still chooses to disproportionately focus on them. It reduces the American occupation of the Philippines to a series of interpersonal squabbles, as opposed to focusing on the actual impact of Quezon’s rule over the Filipinos at the time. Based on what we see in the film, the legacy of Manuel Quezon is in how he engaged with politics, as opposed to the impact of his actions on everyday people. But what was the actual situation of Filipinos back then? One of the only times we hear the perspective of a farmer is to highlight their ignorance of the word “independence.” A few scenes later we hear Osmeña and Quezon agree with Leonard Wood that the Filipinos just aren't ready for independence yet. But why? The film doesn't explore it further. And in the latter half of the film, some of the more intriguing critiques of Quezon’s political impact on the country are undermined by the fact that they’re coming out of the mouth of Emilio Aguinaldo, the Bayani-verse’s primary villain.There's just no inkling at all in the film of what life was like for the average Filipino under American occupation or the Quezon-led Commonwealth. It's 2025. We need to be looking past myopic personalizations of the past. We need to think about the actual situations of the Filipino people. We need to think about what independence actually means and what form of ""independence"" we actually got, both in 1935 and 1946. We don't need more Great Man biopics.Does the film have anything to say about independence at all? We hear the word constantly bandied around like a slogan, as if saying it out loud is enough to signal what the country needs. But the filmmakers don't bother to unpack it. Perhaps the real-life Quezon also didn't explain what was meant by this in the 1920s and 1930s, but that shouldn't excuse our filmmakers today. Unless they genuinely believe that all independence entails is a democracy to vote for our leaders. Perhaps a good question to ask is the opposite. How did Quezon continue the structures of colonial dominance during his rule?What the film seems to try to say is that our first president embodied a lot of the best and worst qualities of many politicians today, but ultimately, it can perhaps be justified because it was for something greater — it was for our independence. But it doesn't bother to explore what this proposed independence even means; it doesn't bother to distinguish political and economic independence; it doesn't even offer any useful corollaries to thinking about these issues today.So why was this film even made?*What makes it so much more fictionalized than the previous two films is the huge prominence of the narrative conceit of telling the film through the perspectives of Joven Hernando and his daughter. The closing down of Hernando’s Alerta publication and the idea of a young female director shooting short films to publicize Quezon’s campaign are totally fictional. There was some suppression of the press, for sure, during Quezon’s time, but Alerta doesn’t have any direct correlates. Perhaps it’s more to symbolize the shut down of ABS-CBN during Rodrigo Duterte’s term. And I could be wrong, but I don’t think Quezon had films made about himself to promote his campaign. Ferdinand Marcos definitely did though. **Very briefly towards the end of the film we get a 30-second critique of Quezon's impact on patronage politics and the disbursement of spoils (pork barrel). That's good. But I don't think it makes up for the other 130 minutes or so of the film that takes more seriously as an issue scandals such as whether he had a first wife or not.",2025-10-16,53,1,watch,False

ydmk,9,"The third film in the Bayaniverse series, Quezon, finally arrives a decade after Heneral Luna. Once again, Jerrold Tarog proves himself as an icon of Philippine cinema. As the film’s writer, director, editor, composer, and producer, Tarog demonstrates complete creative freedom. His distinct artistic voice resonates throughout the film. Tarog doesn’t shy away from drawing parallels between the political struggles of the past and the issues plaguing the Philippines today. It’s disheartening, as a Filipino, to realize how history continues to repeat itself, where those in power remain driven by greed and ambition.The film also challenges how we view Manuel L. Quezon. Was he truly a hero? Have we been blinded by the glorified version of our history, knowing only the good side of his leadership? These questions lingered with me long after the credits rolled.Visually, Quezon excels. The production design beautifully transports viewers to the past, recreating the era with meticulous detail. I was especially excited to see Iain Glen, though I admit I was a bit disappointed by how limited his screen time was. Jericho Rosales, on the other hand, delivers a refreshing performance, showing a side of him we haven’t seen before.Still, I felt the film could have explored more, particularly Quezon’s pivotal role as the “Father of the National Language.” That historical thread seemed missing and could have added more depth to his character and legacy.Overall, I genuinely liked Quezon. While Heneral Luna remains my favorite, this film stands strong in its own right. It’s thought-provoking, relevant, and undeniably crafted with passion. Perhaps it could have benefitted from more time in production, considering it was shot earlier this year, but its brilliance still shines through.Rating: ★★★★☆ (4.5/5) — A brilliant and insightful look into our past that continues to speak to the present.",2025-10-16,1,0,watch,False

Rosales captures the eponymous character with such gusto, power and dynamicism. One could say he indeed was Quezon in the flesh.But, this is still the Bayaniverse. Through journalist Joven Hernando, plus his filmmaker daughter Nadia in this film, provide an impartial lens where the modern audience is their envoy. Hernando's arc through the trilogy has satisfyingly gone full circle. Powerful for a fictional character in this context.Quezon brought this game - these political tricks, to light.

sageanna,8,"If you haven't watched the first two movies of the Bayani series, I suggest you should. Although it did not affect the understanding for this movie, you'll have a better grasp of the other important character's background. Jericho Rosales is an actor you should look out for. He put a lot of effort duplicating Manuel L. Quezon, especially the way he speaks. I think being able to change the way you speak for a 2-hour movie is dedication— Jericho has a lot of that. My last memory of watching Jericho Rosales was in a romance movie and I almost forgot how good he is. (Ito na magtatagalog na ako bdjsjsj) Nagulat ako kasi for someone na matagal nang hindi nakikita sa TV, sobrang pasabog ng pinakita niya na acting. This one really deserves to be in line with the other two Bayani movies. Sobrang galing din ng ibang actors as they also gave justice to the development of Manuel's character. Romnick wow! I already know he was an A-list actor, but seeing him with the others just made him stand out more (also maybe because he is an important character, but nonetheless). Mon, Karylle, Therese, Aaron, Cris, Joross, Ketchup, and JC were also freaking great. Ang lupit talaga ng line up ng artists kasi saan ka makakakita ng movies na kasama silang lahat? Sa Quezon lang. If you want to properly understand why we have this kind of government today, go watch Quezon and reflect as to why that kind of mindset persisted until today. It did not meant to make the people see Manuel as a hero, rather, it wants to make us realize why a revolution happened in the first place. It did not come from merely opposing a person— it is the generational urge to be in a better place that we can call ours. If politics is indeed a game, what choice do we have, as pawns, if we don't fight back and make a stand?

raveloblack,9,"The movie Quezon shows how patronage politics started in the Philippines. It’s a plea for people to always be critical because not everything is as it seems, especially when power and politics are involved. Dakila ang paglilingkod, but we can’t deny that even the brightest minds, no matter how noble their intent, have their own interests to protect, whether it’s power, greed, or pride. The film also leans into the idea of politics as performance, where charisma and public image often overshadow truth. It blurs the line between sincerity and spectacle, showing how easily stories can be staged, not just on screen, but in history itself. Beyond its message, this film feels like a love letter to the older forms of cinema now rendered obsolete by technology. In a world full of unfinished or half-hearted stories, it's admirable that Quezon made it to the screen despite all the odds. The more I think about the state of film today, the more I realize how fragile the whole industry is. The infrastructure is massive, and if one part of it falls, whether it’s funding, distribution, or technological support, the whole system would crumble.Watching Quezon in theaters felt like joining a fight to keep cinema alive. But it also made me realize that in a world where storytelling is changing rapidly, staying critical of what we consume is more important than ever. As technology brings new voices and narratives, we must stay aware of how stories are shaped.

franzhalili,9,"It's all fun a games for our politicians while the Filipino people continue to be the pawnsWhen I saw the trailer for the first time I was a bit confused. Why were they using a Filipino children's game song in the trailer? It all made sense after watching the film.Quezon did not have the action and angst of its co-Bayaniverse film Heneral Luna nor it did not have the suspense and romanticization of Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral but what it did have is a very intentional unraveling of a revered historical figure. This third Bayaniverse film is probably the best and my most favorite.From the very beginning of the film it captures you with its unique treatment of blending in a non-linear narrative with the meta-ness of using silent films as a medium to tell the story while it being contained in its own film. I admit at first there was some confusion in terms of the timeline and the determination of what is reality in the case of the film but as I patiently watched, it all meshed together really well. The end product was so good!I was waiting on moments where I could point out ""show-don't-tell"" moments but the expositions and explanations of what happened were really visualized and conveyed in such creative manners. Was it info overload? Well, if you didn't have any background/knowledge on Philippine History, it will be. But still, it's not a reason for someone to not watch it cause it will make you understand.Jericho Rosales, Karylle, Romnick Sarmenta, and Mon Confiado really stood out. Manuel Quezon was personified through Jericho Rosales' effortless and magnetic performance. He embodied the late president so flawlessly. Karylle's Aurora Quezon was so specific and precise with her portrayal. Her eyes spoke a thousand words and she made us gravitate towards her in every scene she was in.Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña was a crowd-favorite. The eventual first Visayan President was performed with charm and likeability. Even sometimes stealing the scene away from Quezon.But my favorite performance in the film was Mon Confiado's Emilio Aguinaldo. I don't know if I'm being biased because my great grandfather was one of his secretaries but the way Emilio Aguinaldo was written and performed in this film is so complete and really bookends his character arc since he was first seen on Heneral Luna. What I love most about this film is that it vilifies no one but at the same time it does not champion anyone as well. Yes, Quezon was a really influential and well-loved president. Dare I say, the first true performative-male. And in a country where celebrity and politics win the votes of the people, he really, admittedly, played a good game. If he was in Game of Thrones he could've sat on the Iron Throne. It did not smear Quezon's name in any way, yet, it revealed to us who he really was and how he played the game.I keep going back to ""game"" cause this was basically the main theme of the film. A poker-playing politician who always aim to one-up his foes, and even friends. He played the game right but at what cost. People being stuck between colonialism and independence, propaganda against the heroes who fought for our freedom, and a never-ending cycle of patronage politics that was mentioned in the film.I'm so glad I watched this film and I learned about this. And what's funny is that the silliness that happened during their time is still the same silliness happening in our politics up to this date. Senators and congressmen further delaying our countries progress, pork barrels and nepobabies, the ""utang na loob"" culture in politics, all of these are still happening today.Now it gets me questioning whether the fight they fought was really a success or are we just in a new hell created by being collateral damage from their wars. I guess to end this on a positive note, at least now we have people waking up, we have strong journalist and filmmakers ready to be the voice of truth, and the Filipinos are now desperate for a change. may this film be one of the flames that will truly ignite our fight for a better life and TRUE INDEPENDENCE here in our country.",2025-10-16,0,0,watch,True

andymancy,8,"Good movie that is carried by its excellent performances and undeniable timeliness. It does a good job of paying reverence to the Quezon’s legitimate political savviness while also depicting the back and forth of the political game as something childish and worthy of contempt. The movie is at its best when Jericho Rosales fires on all cylinders by being as abrasive and forceful as possible. Its these scenes, where Quezon seems deathly close to crashing out without actually doing it, where you can’t help but be mystified by his character, while simultaneously growing increasingly tired of him.The biggest problem with the movie is the problem with all the Bayaniverse movies, and a lot of movies in general nowadays, which is that it cannot help but over-explain. I get it, Manuel Quezon doesn’t exactly have the most well-known biography, but I feel like there’s a bit of projection that the audience won’t be able to understand the story without all the narrative cues, or the themes without the use of Joven as a narrator. Perhaps im more optimistic about Filipino literacy than i should be, but at some point, Jerrold Tarrog just needs to trust the audience. Joven is an incredibly lazy storytelling device that he has used as a crutch for three movies now, and made this movie twenty minutes longer than it should’ve been. I don’t need him to tell me what the movie is trying to say, and we can’t train audiences to be more literate if he keeps telling them. If Joven still somehow shows up in the next movie despite ostensibly being over a century old by then, please either end the cinematic universe as a whole or reveal that he was Juan Ponce Enrile the whole time.",2025-10-16,0,0,watch,False

a_sreview,10,"Jerrold Tarog's Quezon isn't just a historical biopic; it's a masterclass in political drama and the long-awaited final word in the Bayaniverse trilogy. This film brilliantly connects the trilogy, giving us the clearest and most satisfying explanation yet for the complex state of Philippine politics and leadership.At the heart of this engrossing narrative is Jericho Rosales' magnetic performance as Manuel L. Quezon. Rosales embodies the former president as a charismatic, cunning, and fiercely intelligent political operator. He portrays the energy, oratorical flair, and sheer force of will that defined Quezon, making it clear why this complicated, flawed man was able to navigate the brutal political game and change the course of history. It's a powerhouse portrayal that anchors the entire film.The fear in a dialogue-heavy historical film is a dragging pace, but Quezon defies it. The film moves with precision and purpose, making its runtime feel taut and engaging. You'll find your eyes peeled and attention held by the intense political maneuvering.This is history not as a dusty textbook, but as a live, urgent confrontation with power, compromise, and charisma. It confirms that the greatest battles for the nation were not just fought on the battlefield, but in the corridors of power.",2025-10-16,0,0,watch,True

comsateur,,"Hindi ako kulangot, wag mo akong binibilog. This film is or at least tries to be everything: a biopic, period drama, political satire, hays code era slapstick, old man yaoi, telenovela etc. Despite the seemingly conflicting tones, Jerrold Tarog and the creative team was able to juggle with grace and precision the different facets of Manuel Quezon and a nation's coming of age. Jericho Rosales is a revelation in his portrayal of the titular role. He spoke Tagalog in a slightly high-pitched almost-comical voice, and would switch to English in the accent of a timog-katagalugan everyman combined with the transatlantic cadence of a prohibition era radio personality. Equal parts charming and ruthless, hysterical and terrifying, he treated the character of Quezon as a ringmaster, and the Philippine Legislature his three-ring circus. As with the two other entries in Bayaniverse, Quezon holds a cinema screen-sized mirror to its audience as it peels away the layers of the man who planted the seeds of trapo culture in the Philippines. This is as much a character study of Quezon as it is of Joven, the makabayan surrogate character present in all three films, as he realizes in a full circle moment that even he and his uncompromising ideals of the Philippines' independence are susceptible to propaganda. Jerrold Tarog made a bold creative choice to cast deeper doubts on the conspiracies surrounding the murders of Andres Bonifacio and General Luna. He asks us viewers to look beyond the historical narratives we accept as facts, and to make wiser decisions on who we should put on the pedestal next as a hero of the nation.",2025-10-16,4,0,watch,True
philipilihp,8,"""Hindi ako kulangot, 'wag mo akong binibilog.""Bilang isang tambay ng sinehan, naalala ko na nakalagay sa trailer ng Quezon na it is ""the last chapter in our quest to define bayani"". So pagkatapos panoorin nito, mapapaisip ka nalang talaga: ano nga ba ang bumubuo sa isang bayani? Paano nga ba nagiging bayani ang isang tao? Pinakagusto kong desisyon na ginawa nila ay yung pagpapakita ng bagong paraan sa pagdefine ng ""bayani"". Kung sa Heneral Luna at Goyo ay nakita natin ang mga digmaan at ang laban para sa kalayaan ng Pilipinas, dito naman sa Quezon, ang sandata na ginamit para sa pagpapatuloy ng laban para sa kalayaan ay pananalita. Totoo na medyo mali nga lang yung paggamit nun ng iba sa movie na to huhuhfsdsa pero alam mo yun marina gets mo na yun matanda ka na.Di rin nahiya yung movie na ipakita ang dalawang panig ni Manuel Quezon at kung ano ang mga ginawa niya para lang makamit ang paulit-ulit na tinutukoy na ""independensiya"" ng bansa, kasabay ng kapangyarihang lagi niyang ninanais at di niya kayang bitawan. May kakaunting labo kung saan pumapanig ang pelikula pagkatapos ng lahat, pero nagulat na rin ako na ganun kalayo ang inabot nila sa pagpapakita ng pati na rin ang mga kasamaan niya.Ang nakalulungkot nga lang ay sabi dalawang beses dito na ""out with the old, in with the new"" (di ko naintindihan yung talagang sinabi nila sa tagalog sorry), pero wala pa ring nagbabago eh... ganito pa rin galawan ng mga pulitika. Yung pagbabago na hinahanap natin, hinahanap din nila noon, kaya if anything, sana magamit ang pelikulang ito upang patuloy na gumising ang mga tao at mamulat ang mga mata nila sa katotohanan ng lahat ng gulong ito, at kung sino ang mga may tunay na pananagutan sa lahat ng ito.",2025-10-16,5,0,watch,True

Well, it's an impulsive one for me to watch it but it's good to have it as somehow my last film before flying to the US and also, my first time at the director's club in our local cinema.I do not remember any moment where I felt so much giddy, excitement and anticipation watching a historical film but with this one, this excited me so much, amplified by the plethora (PLETHORA?!?!) of great actors (Rosales, Sarmenta, Santos, Lorenzo, Confiado, Villanueva, Tatlonghari-Yuzon, Abad Santos, Bayani, etc.) that just simply serve masterclass in acting and projecting. Jericho Rosales' portrayal of Quezon, from his demeanor up to his accent, it reminded me of how Vic Robinson portrayed Emilio Jacinto, that also shares an accent, it will really give you that good cherry on top for their characterizations.I really loved how the film was very rhythmic. That's the only word that comes to mind as the progression of the storylines per act is mainly governed by its accompanying track that somehow engages you to a certain feeling they want to invoke from you and that gives me so much fun because it really keeps me up and keeps me so engage, waiting for what's to come. But the accompanying track also somehow fasttracks certain transitions that make the flow of the story a little disorienting at times. There are moments where I am confused on what timeline it is or what reality it is. If I am in before of after Quezon's presidency or if I am in the silent movie created by Nadia or the reality alone.But beyond that, this is a good one and I can't wait to see both Heneral Luna and Goyo in the next few following days to see where this has started. p.s.

In hidisght tho, Jericho Rosales managed to do Quezon so well that his visuals never really distract me. If there is going to be a Ramon Magsasay film, hopefully it will be the same approach as this one because I do not want a film that is only showcased the ""heroism"" of Magsasay but rather the consequences of a Magsaysay"" (basically politicians tried to emulate his charisma and personality).

jaynormouskid,7,"Jones Law. Tydings–McDuffie. Commonwealth. Republic. First president. The film playfully turns these terms we learned in school into a clear, engaging source of politically-charged cinematic plot. The sets are impressive and elevate the viewing (something we now often see in recent Pinoy history films), but focusing mostly on them would be a disservice to a competently written and made film. I was entertained, with twists that made familiar Sibika lessons feel new.Lowkey and right after watching Cinemartyrs from Cinemalaya, Quezon is another film that champions women in the early history of Philippine cinema. Similarly from Cinemartyrs, it also considers America's influence on the country, for better or worse. Independence still feels like a concept, and it has fostered a culture of gratitude that can imply a sense of inferiority, even up to now. Jerrold Tarog always has something to say about these things, showing how far people will go for power. Change the world or seek power or both, it's the same old story. Even before Philippine independence, that was the world. Nothing new there, but it is a welcome reminder.Seems like Jerrold Tarog is not just done yet. And that should be exciting. Although like our thoughts about Villeneuve making franchise films, it would be nice to see Tarog go back to modernly-set films.

At its core, it’s a story about a protagonist who feels more like an anti-hero. Quezon could easily fit the mold of a Marvel villain, his intentions are clear and rooted in conviction, but he’ll do whatever it takes to achieve them. It’s all about perception, really, and how morality can shift depending on where you stand. Di siya masamang tao. Pero willing siya gawin ang lahat. Para sa kanya or para sa bayan niya? On the technical side, the film shines. The use of parallelism, the sharp direction of Jerrold Tarog, and the deliberate framing from Pong’s cinematography all reflect a meticulous attention to detail. As an aspiring filmmaker and cinephile, you’ll find yourself appreciating every choice they made; nothing feels accidental.The performances are equally impressive. Every actor fully embodies their role, responding naturally to one another. There’s no unnecessary showboating, no scene-stealing, just grounded, organic acting that serves the story.Emotionally, Quezon hits hard. It’s not an easy watch, but it’s a necessary one. The film mirrors the pain and complexity of the times we live in. It feels like an origin story for where we are as a nation today.As a frustrated creative from the Philippines, this is the kind of film that makes you proud.

cinemalandi,4,"Great filmmaking. Great shots. Great music. Great editing. But I felt nothing. Was I supposed to conclude that corruption, manipulation and politics go together since time immemorial? Don't I know that already? Doesn't everyone? And even if I did not, if that was all that I needed to realize by film's end, that was not much. That information could have been good for a documentary to explore and analyze. This drama bored me because it was not dramatic enough. A tragic figure, who doesn't change or is pulled further into sad or wrong choices, has to be set up as someone who seems heroic or as one who is given a chance to change his ways by the middle of the film. For all its freneticism, it droned. I think it wanted to be entertaining like a Scorsese or a Chazelle, but the writing caused a pacing problem. Also wondered if anyone who did not have an idea of who Quezon was would be invested in knowing why this is important to see for any human being. I wish all this technique was used on a good screenplay.",2025-10-17,4,0,watch,False

thonter,8,"""Bayan o sarili, pumili ka?""The Bayaniverse may have ultimately been a series of movies that are (if not for the same cast members/ completely standalone, but the bigger picture it paints is asking us the same question John Arcilla's Heneral Antonio Luna once asked a decade ago: ""Bayan o sarili?""""Heneral Luna"" is about a man who is dedicated to giving the country its rightfully earned freedom, no matter who he has to piss off to get it.""Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral"" is about a man who ultimately takes the fight, despite his selfish and somewhat childish nature.""Quezon"" is about a man who is nothing but a slimy and greedy politician who uses the country's independence as a bargaining chip so he can gain power and keep it for as long as he lives.The movie tells us outright that Quezon is not a good man, nor is he the hero of this story. He is a villain who uses every dirty trick in the book to remain one step ahead. It paints a picture of Quezon that is all too familiar to the everyday Filipino: a politician who plays dirty games to gain sympathy so they can climb higher into power.I love how Joven Hernando, who has always been the audience surrogate, has become a more active participant in the story. He becomes one of Quezon's pawns, another piece he could use to further his agenda. And once Joven reverts to his roots and once again becomes an observer, that's when the rug is pulled from under him.Joven is human. He is just like the ""heroes"" we've followed throughout the trilogy, flawed.Quezon brings the Bayaniverse into a solid finish, bringing back everything that came from Luna and Goyo all so it can ultimately tell the big punchline: Aguinaldo outlived every single one of the people we've followed in this trilogy.The Bayaniverse doesn't treat each and every single one of its focus as a holier-than-thou hero, but rather, humans who are just as flawed as everyone else. And in this landscape where every other biopic in the Philippines is treated like a glorified Wikipedia list, it's a breath of fresh air.Now, nobody knows what happens after this movie, after Bayaniverse. Who knows, maybe the Magsaysay tease could lead into a new trilogy that once again examines the Philippines and how we've become who we are today. Whether that happens or not, I'm glad we got to see these three movies come to life, the long way round. And if this does lead to another trilogy of movies, you know where I'll be.(P.S. Docking one star because the movie's soundtrack is sang by the jootsex guy.)",2025-10-17,0,0,watch,True

fiinina,8,"One of those movies you are just so incredibly engrossed in that you don’t even realize how long it actually is To utilize a film within a film was amazing to watch because of its simple yet amusing execution, not to mention its accuracy and relevance during that time. To see lessons and personalities I once learned in class brought to life was all the more fun… na para bang napapanood ko na lahat unfold with my own two eyes ! And lastly, to see the mischievous games and calculated steps & agenda that transpire within the government was insane, funny, compelling, nakakagalit, nakakainis, and overall nakakagulo ng isip kasi hindi mo alam sino papanigan mo……. Which is the point. These political leaders are meant to be humanized. They are complex and abundant of fault. Sabi nga ni Quezon, in order to lead the nation in prosperity he needs to get his hands dirty from time to time. Everyone in this cast was remarkable, lalo na sina Jericho Rosales and Romnick Sarmenta. Their performance in this film gave justice to the brilliance of Quezon, as well as Osmeña. All in all, napakahusay talaga. As usual. Everyone watch Quezon. PLEASE. Sobrang importante ng pelikulang ‘to especially in a time where political games and corruption remain to prevail.

It felt like the makers wanted to provide all relevant facts while at the same time letting the people decide for themselves. I think that if this series hadn’t gotten too meta, too self-conscious about its actual effect on Philippine society, it could’ve really been more courageous and straightforward.Hearing Jericho Rosales speak was jarring at first—having known him as an affable romantic lead—but he dissolves into his playful characterization.

Actually it has been decades (nearing 100 years) since the Commonwealth period and a century since Heneral Luna’s time and we are still facing the SAME issue now.

user1511rosie,7,"What a beautifully shot film that screams “sarswela” from start to end. As remarked by my partner, political dramas told by pinoys for pinoys are best presented in a comedic angle with the frequent spoonfeeding just to make sure the audience is caught up. This is personified by Joven’s character with the insistent need to have a third person pov to narrate the story (similar to Himala’s Orly), rather than just showing the events for what they are, otherwise the narrative can’t be controlled. Further amplified in the scene of Wood asking if Filipinos actually understood what “independence” truly meant. Maybe that’s the point of sandwiching humor (today: memes) in the gravity of our political state, it’s still relevant to the sarswela we have in the government today.The theme of storytelling through film does hit a very important mark in this trilogy— how heneral luna influenced the rise of a strongman president, and how it circled back in this third installation portraying the power of politcal alliances, uniteam. Haha. I do want to point out how so filipino movie-coded this is, with, of course, using women’s suffering as a plot device to move men’s story forward! How necessary was it to use a rape case other than as a threat and show the title character as cocky(we already know that), or how it’s scandalous that he’s bigamous (we already know that), or how aurora is complicit to all these. And, at the end, bears nothing to the story. Honestly, all those parts could’ve been cut from the film and it would have still held up. Lastly, I was first distracted looking at Jericho Rosales and not think of Echo the Hunk. By the end of the film he was truly Quezon to me.

xpert_ninja,9,"I can never forget the optional reading given to us in Kasaysayan 1 class by Prof. Karl Poblador. It was Alfred McCoy’s paper “Quezon's Commonwealth: The Emergence of Philippine Authoritarianism”. I was shocked at first at how absurd the title seemed. Quezon being the blueprint of dictators like Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and Rodrigo Duterte seemed like a stretch.The common Filipino mostly associates Manuel L. Quezon with positive things. The Father of Philippine Independence. The face on the P20 bill. Ama ng Wikang Pambansa. Namesake of the most populous (maybe even the best) city in the country. Strangely though, historical films about the struggle for Philippine independence rarely focus on the life of the first President of the Commonwealth. There are countless cinematic imaginations of figures like Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, and Emilio Aguinaldo. But I can only remember one film about Quezon, the very bland Schindler’s List knock off Quezon’s Game. Quezon is portrayed as a stoic hero, allowing Jewish people to seek refuge as Nazis and World War II circle in on the country. After reading McCoy and watching Jerrold Tarog’s film, that film even looks worse. Tarog’s Quezon is what exactly the country needs right now. A repudiation of the myth of a “Great Man” and his legacy. A stark reminder of the illusion of Philippine independence and the role of native elites in perpetuating the very system the foreign colonizers used for subjugation. The election race between Aguinaldo and Quezon, framed as a battle between the old and the new, even resembles the upcoming 2028 presidential race between the Marcos and the Duterte dynasties. A choice between two evils. The screenplay is impressive in its weaving of multiple timelines in Quezon’s political career, examining the key relationships (Sergio Osmeña, Emilio Aguinaldo, Leonard Wood, the fictional Joven Hernando) that defined it. It reminds me of The Social Network and Oppenheimer in its nonlinearity, an always welcome structure compared to the dominant cradle to grave biopic structure. Black and white 1930-style sequences, featuring the best looking shots of an otherwise blandly photographed and colored film, frame the entire narrative. And it is here where Tarrog’s screenplay surprises in its examination of the role of cinema in political propaganda and collective imagination. Joven, the Bayaniverse’s audience surrogate, finally becomes a compelling character, as he wrestles with supporting Quezon’s presidency.The humorous tone is another welcome approach, playing up the ironies of Quezon’s political decisions from being a collectivist ideologue to supporting the working class to slightly changing an independents act to take credit away from Osmeña. The tone is a good contrast to the rather dull self seriousness of the preceding Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral. Quezon is a comical figure: a petty, narcissistic, scheming con artist. A far cry from the image of a noble patriot many have. Jericho Rosales radiates an almost DiCaprio-like energy and charisma; the loudness of Rosales’s Quezon, in his verbal sparring and speeches, masks the shallowness of his intentions for independence.Tarrog’s screenplay does flounder with the theme of the hollowness of Philippine independence. “Do you know what independence means?”, asks Governor-General Wood to peasant Filipino farmers. The scene seems to be played for laughs at the expense of Filipinos who are portrayed as having a simplistic understanding of the meaning of freedom. Rather than further visualize the plight of working class Filipinos, the film does relegate them to the margins. The formation of Quezon City, the planned home for Manila’s laborers, is a pivotal moment in Quezon’s political career and the country’s history. And yet, the film omits or does not tackle what would have been a perfect illustration of Quezon’s contradictions. But, to the film’s credit, it is long enough already. Perhaps it’s best discussed by another film. Quezon is a rare biopic in this country. We’ve had cinematic deconstructions of Filipino heroes like Rizal and Aguinaldo already. But never has there been a film that demystifies a supposed hero as nothing more than an egotistical opportunist — not unlike the greedy and insincere politicians at the center of the ongoing DPWH flood control investigation. Even if the film has flaws in its bland cinematography and visualizing the struggle of working class Filipinos, it’s hard for me to not be riled up after watching Tarrog’s Quezon. That’s great enough for me.",2025-10-15,14,1,watch,False
reytrillana,6,"The movie, “Quezon” by Jerrold Tarog completes the so-called BAYANIverse trilogy that also includes “Heneral Luna” and “Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral”. The trilogy (post-credit suggests a fourth biopic) was designed to deconstruct the myth surrounding Philippine national heroes by portraying them as flawed and complex human beings rather than perfect heroes we place on pedestals.This is an enjoyable, brisk, and highly opinionated biopic on Quezon. Making a film about history in an entertaining manner is always a challenge but Tarog and co-screenwriter Rody Vera passed with flying colors with a screenplay that intricately weaves historical facts with cinematic storytelling. They did this with the masterful insertion of fictional characters Joven Hernando and his daughter Nadia Hernando. They also avoided the pitfall biopics usually fall into—pointlessly following a chronological order and trying to present everything. Here, they used Quezon's political skirmishes with Leonard Wood, Sergio Osmeña and Emilio Aguinaldo to tell the story of the consummate politician.Kudos to Jericho Rosales for his portrayal of Quezon: temperamental, mercurial, and unpredictable. I had my doubts if he could pull it off when I saw the trailer but happy to have been proven wrong. He is at his best when attempting to charm his way out of a predicament and outwitting his adversaries. Quezon is undoubtedly a compelling and complex individual. “Elastic, electric”; “one of the world’s supplest and hardest-boiled practical politician”; these were some of the words used by John Gunther in an article for January 1939 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. But such reading of the man who became President of the Philippine Commonwealth, Gunther noted, was “only a fraction of the complex, composite truth”. The movie portrays Quezon as Machiavellian—scheming, manipulative, and self-interested. He bossed legislators using the largesse at his disposal, and by threatening them with political ostracism. He valued the loyalty and gratitude of those around him. He would reward those who helped and followed him with jobs and pensions. This is clearly portrayed in his relationship with Emilio Aguinaldo, whose farm and pension he took away when the latter dared to run against him in the country’s first ever elections. But Quezon was also “a genuine revolutionary” as Gunther noted, “the history of the Philippine Islands in the twentieth century and the biography of Manuel Quezon are indissolubly one”. He was also loved by the masses because of his support for the marginalized. He was the one who set minimum wages for government laborers, established an eight-hour working day, and slapped higher taxes on the rich. I had to rewatch Heneral Luna and Goyo before watching Quezon. I think the trilogy succeeded in reimagining these three heroes revealing more intricate, conflicted human beings. But I also hoped that the trilogy could have focused more on nation-building rather than personalities. I understand the need to focus on heroic personalities in these biopics but I hope viewers came out of cinemas not just thinking about heroes as history but also this: the road to nationhood and statehood is complicated. It is still unraveling today. It is still complicated.Saying that the Filipinos united against colonizers to fight for freedom and become one nation is naive. To be fair, Tarog hinted at this in Heneral Luna and Goyo by depicting the regional differences of the revolutionaries and how it contributed to Aguinaldo’s defeat. But can we blame the Ilocanos or the Kapampangans? The revolutionaries from the different regions were fighting for a nation that wasn't there yet. This was Jose Rizal’s obsession during his time—the lack of a national consciousness. He spent, and offered, his life to lay the groundwork for a collective national identity, a shared sense of being a nation. Quezon was more pragmatic in his approach. He said, “In statecraft the most important thing is the goal.” In other words, the end justifies the means. Quezon, of course, would never publicly admit that the goal of independence from the United States is intrinsically tied to ambition. To his mind, what hurt would it do if the national goal and his interest align? One of the most powerful moments in the film was when Joven was pontificating in front of Quezon, berating him for his greed and scheming ways. Quezon then turned the tables around telling Joven that he was in fact an accomplice because he also benefitted from Quezon. The US role in all these should not be diminished. By organizing local elections they essentially empowered local warlords to acquire power setting the stage for their capture of central government.There were instances when the movie relied too much on commentaries rather than storytelling. I really appreciate movies, especially those with political and social messages, that exercise restraint—when it does not tell us how to feel and what to think.

zkyrysh,8,"This film is a sharp contrast to Henral Luna and Goyo, but somehow it blends in. It is the same game in a new mask—the same battle in a different battlefield. It has always caught my interest that the Bayani-verse shows the humanity in figures revered by their good actions in the past. It grounds the character to a playing field in which we can analyze their actions and flaws as if they are not above us at all. It gives the audience space to ponder the differences between the praises given on history books and the reality of the human experience. Film is always such an amazing platform for storytelling in ways that capture essence and displays an overarching sense of humor in our lives even in serious moments.Quezon concludes the first battle by showing us that in war or in the pursuit of independence, politics has always been the same. It is rooted in tactics and is played out as a game. Battle of minds and leverage is the front of all this. A greater focus should be on the sequence in which they discuss the readiness of the country for independence. From now and then, the comprehension of concepts allows the nation to grasp what it wants. If the word independence could not be understood before, now it has ballooned to so much more. Terms that now hide from the public to understand. Watching this film, the people behind me were in shock when the word communist was mentioned. I knew there and then that they do not know the concept of this ideology much like the Filipinos that did not understand independence. In the very seats that welcome watchers is also the very seats that criticizes us. Anyways—preparing for the teaser shown as a mid credit scene. I expect a lot considering the impact of the bayani verse to the film industry, to Filipino culture, and Philippine perception. Magsaysay!",2025-10-18,1,0,watch,True

vlaaaaaaadddddd,7,"“Mauuna pa atang pumuti ang uwak kaysa bitawan mo ‘yang kapangyarihan mo.”Unlike the first two installments of the Bayaniverse, Quezon throws all subtlety out the window and says everything straight to your face. I took an elective on the History of the Philippine Presidency last semester, and we spent almost half of it just talking about Quezon. Watching the film felt exactly like that — a two-hour lecture where all the facts are dumped on you. Maybe that's not entirely a bad thing. Maybe it's better that there's no room for misinterpretation or assumptions of what the film wants to say. Maybe that's what we need as a nation: to be told, directly and unapologetically, what needs to be done for us to become better.Quezon feels painfully familiar because everything in it mirrors our current news cycle — a political shitshow where those in power do everything to hold on to it. At first, it’s laughable. But eventually, it stops being funny, and we’re just left angry.We deserve better than someone like Quezon. We deserve better than leaders obsessed with themselves but blind to the people they’re supposed to serve. We deserve better than naming cities after them or printing their faces on our money. We need to stop turning flawed men into untouchable icons and start being honest about what their legacies should look like.Tarog’s meta-commentary in this third installment is interesting, but the constant switching between the younger and older versions of the characters can get confusing. I get what he’s trying to do. He wants us to remind that history can be reconstructed or reinterpreted, but sometimes it pulls the story away from having emotional or narrative depth.That said, the ensemble was great, but Karylle was especially exceptional. The unsure, restrained, and quiet glances she gives when the camera lingers on her say so much about a woman’s place in our nation’s fight for independence: sidelined and often overlooked. As her character tells his husband, “Naniniwala akong naniniwala kang tama ‘yang pinaglalaban mo.”With Tarog’s Bayaniverse coming to a close (or is it?), it feels like the fight that should’ve started long ago is only just beginning. Saying “we should fight” can get tiring and repetitive, but then again, maybe that’s why films like this still matter. Because we still see leaders like Quezon today.

denlebantino,8,"Manuel Luis Quezon (Benjamin Alves as the younger version) inside the prison cell at the beginning of the film submits to a calling he himself invokes,an act of total surrender to the shining light of messianic delusion: he as a vanguard of freedom,a savior of the nation. This scene lays down the very blueprint of the man, and the DNA of the third film of Jerrold Tarog's Bayaniverse shown at such a time as this. Tarrog's deconstruction of Manuel Quezon easily reveals a pattern, the four chapters proving how the Commonwealth figure wields power. The film depicts Joven Hernando (Aaron Villaflor/Cris Villanueva) as the conflicted source of truth and keeper of lies, he being witness to the former and he being made to hide the latter. Quezon ought to strip Hernando of his journalistic freedom lest he (Hernando) destroy the masses' perception of the politician. Cassey, as the Americans call Quezon,orders silence as a tool that the film also uses to depict politics as a performance where Cassey plays the main part and masters it to perfection. Cassey's political campaign by way of showing silent films visualizes the performative act. A man plays someone he is not,living the dream so long as he has the power, so long as he is able to craft perception and accord himself the grandeur. His bouts against Sergio Osmeña (Romnick Sarmienta), Leonard Wood (Iain Glenn), and Emilio Aguinaldo (Mon Confiado) easily reflect what we see today: politics as a game, interests at the center, power as the ultimate goal. The scene where Quezon walks back to his seat after his speech while Aguinaldo walks towards the podium projects a duel reflective of the political motion that haunts our nation: each going a different direction but aiming for the same peak of dominance.The score is aptly dramatic and haunting, giving the scene the verve that seals what we make of our politicians--if we haven't settled that yet.Jericho Rosales brilliantly plays Manuel Quezon as the Senate President and the President of the Commonwealth by consistently creating the identity of the man who cannot be caught defeated. His performance naturally shows Quezon as a larger-than-life figure, the center around which everything revolves. That the film depicts him in this magnitude makes everyone else small, especially the masses whom he declares he works for.But not only are they rendered small; they are also voiceless and invisible. When a poor man defines independence as food, the film unmistakably captures power and its fuel. It rightfully pictures the masses being the ultimate victims of the fraud that is politics, the victims of the insatiable dreams of the narcissists where they (masses) are subconsciously the empaths that support their (narcissists) fantasy.And so we laugh because the film is a farce as much as it is a political drama whose emotional interjection comes at the far end of the spectacle. It comes as a silent wave of heartbreak and desperation. For ourselves. For our nation. How else should the film show Quezon at the end but the way the film does? Did his dreams come true? At a point where he no longer has influence,what are the words that matter? The film serves the closure we deserve from a man we've come to know from the very beginning,the consistency Quezon can never make himself to break because his nature will never allow it. His last words affirm his fantasy.Saying ""I am the Philippines"" can never be more delusional. To this day, we continue to see this delusion. And it harms us more than ever.",2025-10-18,2,0,watch,False

billyregala,10,Ahhhh. This movie is so good. I know that this is a story based on Quezon but this is just as timely as it could have been with all the political statements that they have showed us here. I think it is truly important to note how power can be intoxicating but we also have to be reminded as voters that we have power to put these people in positions. We should be more critical of them and make them understand that who they are serving are us and not themselves. The film also encapsulates how media can also be used to change narratives and we have seen that be weaponized in today's time as well. We need stories like these to remind us of where power should lie and how these politically corrupt actions can lead to our demise as a nation. There are good and bad sides to people but I think it is important to remember them both and not put anyone on a pedestal high enough for no one to reach them but instead make them understand where true power lies - in us.

With those editing and transitions, it feels like I’m watching a Coen Brothers’ film, and in the writing, he stays true to his style. Round of applause to Jericho Rosales for his accent and acting skills. He was a revelation in this movie, and every shot of him is just amazing to watch and left me in awe. Romnick Sarmenta and JC Santos are also fun to watch; well done. Having Iain Glen on this, as Leonard Wood, is just perfect for the role. Mon Confiado reprising the role as Emilio Aguinaldo—it really does suit him. The cinephile in me is in pure joy and tickled by this movie.In terms of the history, as Mark Twain says, “history repeats itself, but it often rhymes.” With the current situation in the Philippines, it reflects a lot, and it is sad to think that we’re in a cycle. The feeling that we’ve never learned our lesson from the past. Quezon using independence for power to get into a higher position, and the way he acts, he is the epitome of a “trapo.” With all things considered, it is hard to be a Filipino and to be hopeful that one day we will be able to elect someone who has a pure intention to help every Filipino and make decisions that are for the betterment of the Filipino people. Thank you, Jerrold Tarog, for continuing to create these movies.

carloupeng,8,"Film Review: Quezon (dir. Jerrold Tarog, 2025)When I was young, Manuel Quezon was a romanticized figure, hailed as the one who earned the Philippines its independence, and also the “Father of the National Language.” Aside from that, I really know nothing about that guy.Several years later, I came across a copy of Ambeth Ocampo’s “Quezon’s Sukiyaki,” a collection of essays about several historical figures in Filipino history. It contained some interesting notes on Quezon’s boisterous nature. Further readings unraveled Quezon’s more devious side as a politician, which was the main theme of Jerrold Tarog’s newest film.“Quezon” chronicled the rise of the titular character from a veteran of the Filipino-American War to the president of the Philippine Commonwealth. The movie deviated from the typical depictions of the former president. Here we saw Quezon at his most unscrupulous, a true political chameleon. Whatever glazed images I had of the man evaporated after watching this movie. Suffice to say, Quezon was the original trapo. While it can be said that he genuinely cared about independence, he surely had his hands dirty, and his priority was after all, his own interests.Jericho Rosales was phenomenal in his role- adapting Quezon’s speech patterns and mannerisms. I was a bit skeptical when he was announced to be the lead, but Echo was a great actor after all and he surely proved it. Mon Confiado’s performance in this movie as Aguinaldo was a stark contrast from the other Bayaniverse films: the Aguinaldo in “Quezon” was more mellow, seemingly remorseful, softened by age. It was amazing of Mon to portray the same character in three different ways.The performance of the actors in this film was phenomenal, and I think everyone pulled their weight. I must specifically praise Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña. His bickering with Quezon was one of the film's highlights. I think “Quezon” was the most creative in all Bayaniverse films. I particularly liked the silent film snippets. It showed us the importance of media arts in shaping political opinions. I also appreciated the use of the rondalla as the main musical force of the movie: it made the movie sound more like a Filipino political comedy, compared to its militaristic predecessors. Compared to “Heneral Luna” and “Goyo” there were barely any action scenes in the movies. The battles were fought through verbal sparring, scheming, and persuasion. It was a unique Bayaniverse movie. I don't have many criticisms against this movie, although a certain cameo mildly soured my viewing experience. Also, I wish we saw more of the Japanese occupation, to see a different side of Quezon. I must say though, that the ending was hauntingly good. A great film, nonetheless.",2025-10-18,0,0,watch,False

Now, here comes the much awaited final film of the Bayani trilogy, at last.Quezon has a much refined commentary compared to the first two. It's well-paced. Couple of hours flew by quick. If Filipinos weren't brainwashed with fake news on a reel-to-reel basis for the past nine years, this film could've easily made an impact in our political landscape heavier than Luna ever did.Another quality film worth seeing in the big screen.

He was always dubbed as the “Father of the Filipino Language” and it didn’t help that he was my Grandpa’s favorite president ever. All I heard about Manuel was good things. This film shocked me, as the once perfect image I had of this “great” man (and I put quotation marks on that word because iykyk) was systematically debunked by the exposition of all his flaws. Direct Tarog succeeded in humanizing this man.Jericho really disappeared in this role, as I was convinced that he was a direct 1:1 copy of Mr. Quezon himself. The mannerisms, the intensity, the accent; he nailed it and really captured the swagger of this “great” man (again, iykyk).Mon Confiado is Mon Confiado, Rominick was great and very adorable as Osmeña, Iain Glen was excellent also, despite only appearing briefly.I loved the music, the occasional slapstick comedy, and the silent film parts.

izedkape,8,"Simply an amazing film to end Tarog’s Bayani Trilogy. Quezon harnessed the strengths of its predecessors Heneral Luna and Goyo, producing a film with strong storytelling, great actors, and awesome cinematography. Although he did not physically look like the mestizo Casey, Jericho Rosales delivered an enigmatic performance well-deserving of acting awards. But among its merits, perhaps my favorite thing about Quezon is its pointed delivery of political critique not only towards the current administration but to the long history of corrupted, patronizing, and self-serving Philippine politics.I know for sure that it is not only me who feared that Quezon would end up sanitizing the former president’s image, as films about politicians and heroes tended to do so. But alas, Quezon was not usual biopic that mythologized the man — instead, it demystified him, reintroducing the former President that plastered his and his wife’s name all over his home province and the biggest city in Metro Manila. It was able to effectively deliver Manuel Luis Quezon as the cunning politician, borderline dictator that he is.Alongside his intelligent spiels and populist rhetoric, the film revealed the unapologetic and manipulative character of the 2nd President of the Philippine Republic — the man who laid the formula of political maneuvering for the politicians and would-be presidents after him, proving Alfred McCoy’s view that Quezon’s Commonwealth paved the way for Philippine authoritarianism.I do hope that Tarog continues to develop new historical fiction films in the future. More than ever, we need more films that tackle and communicate our history in interesting ways that provoke the audience to revisit our past and reexamine our stances on our ‘great’ men.",2025-10-18,5,0,watch,False

Though we know him as the Father of the Filipino Language, Social Reformist but behind all of it do you know his game politically? You'll see a Quezon that no one has seen before (textbook-wisely speaking). You'll see how he the dirty game in politics has already been in their age (he prolly learned it to the Gringos while he was in the States). You'll see him greedy and hungry for power and you know that he doesn't like when people do not make something good out of him. Connecting this movie Quezon's Game (2018), without giving any spoilers, the influence of MLQ to the whites is superior over Aguinaldo's stance. Speaking of Aguinaldo, this is where I think he's reaping what he had sowed the bad decisions he had done. Though you may fill pity for him because of what he had faced in the movie. You'll witness also how JOVEN that was beside MLQ throughout the movie to confront him and protested what he truly feels and that stands out because Joven, he witnessed the history and voices what a youth could've said it also before.

cjshua,8,"Quezon closes out Jerrold Tarog's Bayaniverse as a farcical deconstruction of the idea that one ""Great Man"" can lead a nation to prosperity. With Joven as the audience surrogate of the trilogy, Tarog makes sure that this myth is shattered. We see Joven slowly but surely become disillusioned as he realizes the dangers of putting a face to a political movement. Gone are the days where he puts these strong and charismatic men on a pedestal. This film feels the most pointed of the trilogy. Tarog's screenplay feels quite self-conscious as it sometimes overexplains itself. This film really wants to make a point amidst today's political turmoil. Politics is a game. It paints Quezon as a charismatic yet narcissistic manipulator who knew how to play it so well that he may just be the showman who invented political chess. He's basically a glorified ""trapo"" who's tidied up by our history books with titles like ""Ama ng Wikang Pambansa."" His methods are the reason why Filipinos today are so swept up by populist and charismatic leaders. Whether we like it or not, his methods paved the way for the dominance of ""trapos"" in our Senate today. On the other hand, I feel like the lack of subtlety did remove the nuances and gray areas that I was looking for in a take like this. It does become just a fight between good and evil in some parts. For one, I did not understand the choice of glazing over Aguinaldo in this when even he lead a regime built upon manipulation. Felt like Tarog retracted from his stance against Aguinaldo in Heneral Luna where he was heavily villainized (deservedly so) in that third act. I also wanted more nuance with its take on Quezon himself. He was quite the showman who shifted his principles and narratives when it's convenient for him. I guess I just wanted more moments of self awareness and reckoning from him. Him being an egotistical maniac just felt a bit too clean and clear cut. Loved how Jericho Rosales just threw himself into this role though. Even if he is over the top, you really buy the charms and sales talking that he does in the film. Despite my gripes with it, I do think this is a refreshing historical biopic and I like how it played with its structure. It wants to make a point and it delivers with clarity and conviction. I ultimately do think this is a national hero biopic that we deserve right now as a nation. Something that will serve as a caveat and hopefully, an antidote to our deep fanaticisms with populists and demagogues.",2025-10-18,0,0,watch,True

At times, it can border into the saccharine, but that can be forgiven in consideration of the necessity for its themes to be communicated to the widest possible audience. However, much less forgivable is that in establishing Quezon’s manipulative and underhanded methods in politics, it may have presented his contemporaries, even the Americans, in a less critical light. Quezon becomes so comically evil towards the end that he makes everyone else look like saints.And yet, even as you grow to despise Quezon more and more, Jericho Rosales’ performance transfixes and commands attention. It should be praised that a portrayal that slimy and morally despicable continues to compel and leave you hanging on his every word. If not for the historical accuracy, a criteria I can’t attest to, watch this one for Rosales’ performance alone.",2025-10-18,1,0,watch,True

ayuutaoz,7,"Would’ve been a 4-5!! The color grading was unexpected for a film that tackled the Philippine Commonwealth. It felt off, almost too modern for the time period it was supposed to capture. The play on jazz tried to reflect how playful and full of tricks Quezon was, but it ended up feeling out of place rather than symbolic. Watching it with the expectation that it would have the same weight or sharpness as Goyo or General Luna, medyo wala siyang dating. It lacked the same power, emotion, and impact those films delivered.The storyline and its modern approach made a few interesting points, but overall, it felt just okay. The movie leaned in on how the Philippine press was going against the idea of too much “idealism” and not enough on honesty. The Philippines has always had issues with its government, and the film, while trying to shed light on a heroic act, missed the chance to question the systems and attitudes that kept those issues alive. Since the beginning, it’s always been about finding leaders who are good enough—but sometimes, films like this forget that good enough isn’t the same as good.",2025-10-18,0,0,rewatch,False

Tarog, the film explored the conquest of Manuel Quezon with all of its grit and glory. Personally liked the use of silent film and newspaper montages into the story, as well as the surprisingly heavy plot point of journalism throught the movie. Of course, Jericho Rosales portrayed the former President Quezon remarkably. His accent and mannerism was so animated and persuasive. But Mon Confiado’s iconic performance as Aguinaldo was my favorite. Sir Mon’s character throughout the Bayaniverse is definitely cemented in Philippine cinema history.Quezon serves as a stark reminder about the disheartening loop of our so-called “democracy” filled with figures vying for power using schemes and tricks. Sad to see that after 100 years, this has been our case — being a politician all boils down to the ability to sway the public’s opinion to one’s side with the incompetency to serve.With our current issues, this is for sure an essential watch. ‘Di dapat tayo magpapaloko sa mga trapong pera at kapangyarihan lang ang habol sa gobyerno.

pinathbutter,8,"Planned to rewatch Heneral Luna and Goyo first before catching this so I could have a more comprehensive picture, but I couldn't find the time to do so.That being said, I'm a huge fan of the first two entries and the concept of this franchise as a whole. It's always interesting to me when films or any form of media provide a deconstruction and humanization of historical figures who are otherwise just names in our minds carved by our history lessons. With this kind of movies, our heroes become flawed men, far from the shallow descriptions in lectures and closer to the people in power currently governing our countries. With that, everything becomes much more real, and much more depressing.The campaign film gimmick is an endearing choice, and it definitely made the story livelier and much more engrossing. This film, unlike its predecessors, is less on guns and bombs and more of battles fought in the realm of politics. For Quezon, it's all just a game. And he's bloody good at it. The chapters entertainingly break down how Quezon is an early manifestation of a trapo, arrogantly moving to serve his personal interests at the expense of true service to the people.What stood out to me the most is this film's depiction of the arts (e.g. film) and the press (e.g. newspapers). It deftly demonstrated how both can be weaponized by the state to spread its propaganda, often to the point of manipulation and deception. It rings true up to now.",2025-10-17,0,0,watch,True

justyfyd,7,"This is by far the weakest installment in Tarog's Bayaniverse, and yet a strong start for an ""experimental screenplay"" by the director. Tarog isn’t just known for his heroic-themed films but also for horror works like Shake, Rattle & Roll. This time, however, it's different. He used plenty of comedic acts—so much that I almost forgot the film was a drama—which made it feel very unconventional and rare for him to explore such an approach.Still, he was clever and creative for going unorthodox, especially since the film revolves around sheer politics. It was dense with overwhelming dialogue. Perhaps he decided to use comedy to maintain the audience’s attentiveness, as casual moviegoers tend to have short attention spans and might easily doze off. I think it was intentional, and he just saved his cinema from a bland, dull, and boring screenplay.As for the main character, Jericho Rosales did excellently in this film. He gave an astounding performance as Quezon—enough to provoke the audience’s emotions. The mannerisms, gestures, and expressions were on point. However, I believe there might still be another actor who could’ve portrayed Quezon better, as there were scenes where the acting felt somewhat unnatural, as if he was ""acting an acting."" On the side of fiction, Joven’s monologue never disappoints! From Luna to Goyo to Quezon, the consistency is just commendable.In addition, I really loved Tarog's uniqueness with his cinematic strategies on how he delivered the story of Quezon, plus the coin as an allegory, which is something I couldn’t explain in detail because it’s better if you watch it on the big screen. I still have a lot in mind, but I wish I were that diligent to write it all down. Anyway, this film is rated as a standalone piece, not part of the trilogy when the first two are taken into account.Overall, the film was entertaining, and the production was, as always, all-out. If you can, please watch it in cinemas. It’s worth watching.P.S. Kaya pala naging barya ang bente kasi dasurb nya???P.P.S.

azuregq,8,"Alam naman natin na may katiwalian sa pamahalaan dahil sa pamumulitika at sa pangingibabaw ng sariling interes kaysa maglingkod para sa kapakanan ng bayan. Nandiyan ang pork barrel scam noon at ang anomalya sa flood control projects ngayon. Pero bakit nga ba paulit-ulit natin sila binoboto? Sa panulat at direksiyon ni Jerrold Tarog, isa itong historical drama na tumatalakay sa buhay ng kinikilalang ikalawalang pangulo ng bansa na si Manuel Luis Quezon (Jericho Rosales) at kung paano niya nilaro ang politika. Ito ang pangatlo sa Bayaniverse ng nasabing direktor, una ang ""Heneral Luna"" (2015) at ikalawa ang ""Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral"" (2018). Sa higit na dalawang oras na takbo ng pelikula na puro diyalogo, napanatili nito ang aking interes dahil sa kakaibang direksiyon nito. Bukod sa paglalagay kay Joven Hernando (Cris Villanueva at Aaron Villaflor), nakatulong dito ang satirikong tono nito sa halip na isalaysay lamang ito nang tuwiran na makikita sa naunang dalawang pelikula. Nakatatawa na nga ang mga eksena, malalaman at maiuugnay mo pa ang mga patutsada sa kasalukuyang lagay ng politika sa bansa o sa sinumang politiko. Hindi naman kataka-taka na maitatagpi ito sa kalagayan ng pamahalaan ngayon. Ang may mas dating para sa akin ay ang gampanin ng mamamahayag sa lipunan. Ayon nga sa nalaman ko sa nadaluhang online seminar workshop para sa mga mag-aaral na mamamahayag at tagapayo ng pahayagang pampaaralan, walang obhetibo sa pamamahayag dahil may pinipiling anggulo ang tagapagbalita kaya mahalaga na maging mapanagutan at mapanuri sa isisiwalat tungo sa paghulma ng isipan at boses ng sambayanan. Kung patuloy na mas nagbibigay ng atensiyon ang mainstream na midya sa mga walang kawawaang paandar ng ilang opisyal, bago man o beterano, kaysa sa mga napapanahong isyu at adbokasiya, hindi na nakagugulat kapag nanalo ang mga ito kung sakaling tumakbo ito sa mas mataas na posisyon. Kitang-kita ito sa pelikula sa tulong ni Joven Hernando at ng kaniyang anak na si Nadya. Sumunod, kapuri-puri at kapani-paniwala ang pagganap ng mga artista. Noong una na nasa post-credit scene ng Goyo si Benjamin Alves bilang Manuel Quezon, nakakasabik dahil kamukha niya ito. Nang binago ito at naging si Jericho Rosales, nagtaka ako pero namangha pa rin kasi kamukha rin. Ngayong napanood ko sila pareho, palagay ko na tama na si Rosales ang gumanap dito. Kitang-kita sa kilos at pananalita at iisipin mo na si Quezon ang kaharap mo. Bukod dito, nag-iwan din ng impak ang ni Romnick Sarmenta bilang Sergio Osmeña at muling pagganap ni Mon Confiado bilang Hen. Emilio Aguinaldo. Hindi rin nagpahuli sina Karylle bilang asawa ni Quezon at Angeli Bayani bilang asawa ni Aguinaldo. Panghuli, nakatulong din ang disenyong pamproduksiyon upang maging kapani-paniwala hindi lamang ang pagganap ng mga tauhan pati na rin ang tagpuan ng pelikula. Nakapag-ambag din ang musika at tunog sa tono nito. Sa kabuuan, nagkaroon ako ng kawili-wiling karanasan sa panonood nito dahil sa bagong direksiyon, kapuri-puring pagganap, kapani-paniwalang disenyong pamproduksiyon, at angkop na musika at tunog sa pang-uuyam nito. Batid nga natin na may kanser sa ating lipunan ngunit bakit ba natin pinipili pa rin ang mga trapo? Dahil sila at sila pa rin naman ang tatakbo? Dahil kilala ang apelyido nila at may malawak na makinarya sa pangangampanya kaya naniniwala tayo na sila ang magpapaunlad sa atin? O dahil naging kuntento na lamang tayo sa paniniwala na kurakot naman silang lahat? Hindi man namamalayan ng karamihan ngunit may paniniwala na may ambag ang ""Heneral Luna"" sa kaisipan na ayos lamang na may palamurang pinuno. Sa ""Quezon"", nangangamba ako na baka ang mapulot lamang ng karamihan ay iboto na lang ang kahit na sino dahil tiwali rin naman silang lahat. Hetong Bayaniverse ang magsilbing paalala sa atin na huwag makuntento sa natatamasang kaginhawaan ngayon (kung mayroon man dahil sa mga pribilehiyo) sapagkat mas karapat-dapat pa na matamo natin ang tunay na mabuting pamumuno. Huwag tayong sumamba sa mga opisyal at pumanig sa kapuwa mamamayan.

(parang endemic na sila atp) and for us non-reptilians, are we complicit in the ecosystem we live in?i read a review somewhere where they said this film is nothing but a mirror and tells us what we already know. but you know what? WE FILIPINOS ARE HARD HEADED! we forgive and forget like its breathing when we often shouldn’t. so yes, we do need this mirror up every single day until we learn. we can’t also expect this film to give us a solution to our recurrent (if not perpetual) problem. it being a mirror does not reduce its value in asking us what we want to do when we don’t like what we see in the looking glass.this installment of the trilogy finally made me un-demonize aguinaldo. he’s still shit but he isn’t the devil incarnate. just as we examine the meaning of “bayani”, we also get to examine those who have fallen from grace. mon confiado proves why he is el presidente in capturing the complexities of the man.echo truly did the role justice with the way he became a chameleon! i love the focus on this aspect of quezon especially when irl there have been 3 actors in the bayaniverse to play quezon (long live the quezon multiverse!). he will act and (literally) look different depending on his audience and what he can gain from them. this is why i don’t think we actually see the real quezon in each of these scenes. they’re all an act. its only when you piece them together where you can see a better picture of the guy.

californiamacky,6,"If it's not yet apparent by now, Jerrold Tarog is on a mission to strip our heroes of their reverence and enigma, and in the third installment of the ""Bayaniverse,"" he focuses on a war of a different kind --- a war waged not with bullets and bayonets but words and propaganda. As a political drama, ""Quezon"" is a nailbiter. There is enough history lesson here to make one revisit old textbooks, and some of the issues surrounding the larger-than-life Manuel Luis Quezon are brought to light. My only gripe with this is that the script does very little to nothing with the issues presented. The film is only concerned with exposing MLQ as a flawed man --- perhaps as a reflection of the current Filipino politician who will do whatever it takes to amass power.I also found the portrayal of Aurora Quezon (Karylle) a little jarring. While there was an intention to highlight the immense potential of women to shape society (as with Therese Malvar's fimmaker character), Aurora on the other hand is given almost nothing to do but be a sounding to board to her husband (Jericho Rosales). In one climactic scene, where Quezon's secrets are thretatened to be exposed, the camera cuts to Aurora for a reaction shot --- and then nothing. The issue would no longer be discussed for the remainder of the film, and we never really see how Aurora views her husband in light of his duties as a husband, a father, a politician, and as a leader of a nation.The film also commits several sins of omission, including the portrayal of Leonard Wood as a mere bureaucrat, completely neglecting his involvement in the Bud Dajo Massacre in 1906.Nevertheless, the ensemble piece features several noteworthy performances, led, of course by Rosales as Quezon, Benjamin Alves as the younger Quezon, Mon Confiado, who will forever be associated with the Emilio Aguinaldo role, Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmeña, Cris Villanueva as an older Joven Hernando (a fictional character used to bridge the three films) and Iain Glen as Leonard Wood. Of the films in this trilogy, Aguinaldo gets the most interesting story arc in ""Quezon,"" as do Joven. The humor, too is at par with the best bits from ""Heneral Luna,"" which is fitting I guess because what is politics in the Philippines but a big farcical extravaganza? Something to commend here as well is the film's use of the silent film era to portray Quezon's rise to power, leveraging the power of images to form (or better yet, manipulate) public opinion. As ""Quezon"" takes place during the rise of cinematic consciousness around the world, it is nice to hear Murnau, Fritz Lang, Nepomuceno, and Harris and Tait mentioned in the same breath as the country's exodus towards independence from American rule. One thing I missed here was Epy Quizon's calming voice of reason as Apolinario Mabini, but by this timeline, Mabini is already dead (he died in 1903). Perhaps a voiceiver from the dead? Perhaps not.In closing, is ""Quezon"" a perfect film? Like the person it portrays, it is far from perfection. But is it provocative? Does it invite dialogue and introspection into our complicated history with truth, idolatry, and the persistence of patronage politics? Definitely.",2025-10-19,1,0,watch,False

ghostfacers,,"written and directed with precision by tarrog, quezon is an entertaining and smart depiction of history's manchilds and the ""heroic"" games they play for the ""independence"" of the nation.its double-edged sword, however, is its effectivity in critiquing and being propaganda. while it critiques film as the very medium for this ideological and calculated systemic myth-making (we are rooting for comrade nadia), it also falls under this trap by centering narratives on the humanity of history's people with less attention to the bigger powers in play that hold the strings to these figures.by focusing on quezon’s child's play hiding over his performed wit and individual brilliance, the film risks personalizing what is, at its core, a systemic issue: that philippine politics has always been a performance crafted under the watchful eye of american imperialism. politicians will choose their ideological stance based on available choices, independence is highlighted as the goal of the masses who is alienated by its very language, and in every six years, we will be given choices for leaders who will never trully represent us.the film eventually reveals this control, but the critique is softened, overshadowed by the dramatized rivalry between the opportunist quezon and leonard wood, and other names in history. the bigger villain, the structure that rewards political ego and molds philippine politics and elections to all be a game, remains unscathed. it is named. but it seems like right now, like quezon, we end up turning toward the nearest villains — within reach, within us.",2025-10-18,7,0,watch,False

dawnheartsfilm,7,"what’s interesting about bayaniverse — or perhaps, historical movies in general — is that you see these figures as human beings. there is this sort of doomed faith that the audience harbor, only to get disappointed with the characters’ actions, hence making it more humane. these people, despite being heroes, are fallible. as you get deeper into the film, you get to realize and understand why certain people act the way they do and how their brain works. it would be illegal to compare quezon to the two previous films namely luna and goyo’s. luna cultivated a sense of patriotism, leaning more on aggression and one’s burning desire, perfectly encapsulating antonio himself. on the other hand, goyo shifted its focus from war to the dilemma the young general is caught in, emphasizing how young he still is (GOYO MY FAVE FR + the OST made by direk je.

enelra21,10,"Been looking forward to this film forever. It’s one of those films in PH cinema that really stands out and feels well-invested. The cinematography was excellent, the sound was even better, and I have to say, the nuances of Osmeña and Quezon were portrayed accurately. The script was well writtenI especially loved how they showed Quezon’s lobbying skills, how he hinted, persuaded, and almost fed the egos of the members of the House and the Senate. It was both fascinating and nauseating to see how power was exchanged and traded so openly. It leaves you wondering whether this film makes you feel more hopeless and jaded, or simply resigned to the fact that you’re seeing the same things happen again & that none of it really surprises you anymoreAfter watching Luna before, I was left with frustration. Then came Goyo, which didn’t really resonate with me. But this one, this one did. I had been wondering how they would approach Quezon’s story. There’s been so much written about him, but I love how the film showed his showmanship, his dirty politics, and how he practically set the precedent for how politics are still played...manipulative, strategic, and all at onceAnd while this is a biopic, I think cinema about history should be done this way. If Goyo felt subpar compared to Luna in terms of cinematic and entertainment value, Quezon was endearing and powerful It makes you think, if politics were already that dirty back then, how much worse is it now, when people don’t even hide their corruption and proudly brand themselves as “noble” while stealing the people’s money? For sure Quezon played his cards wellAnd Jericho and Romneck definitely deserve awards for their performances",2025-10-19,1,0,watch,True

mischkalicouss,9,"if history were a movie, Quezon would be the scene where the lights stay on too long where the glamour fades and all that’s left is the politics, the pride, and the people pretending not to notice the cracks.i went in expecting something noble, something textbook. but what i got felt… human. painfully human. quezon (jericho rosales, absolutely magnetic) isn’t painted as a saint here he’s ambitious, clever, exhausted, and aware that being “good” doesn’t always win you the game. it’s that messy, moral middle ground where idealism meets ego, and somehow that felt more honest than any patriotic speech ever could.and then there’s aguinaldo. he’s not the villain not really. he’s just another man trying to keep his version of the world alive. it’s poetic in this haunting way that the movie reminds us: he was supposed to die early, yet outlived everyone. quezon. roxas. the whole lineup. and that irony? it stings. like history laughing quietly in the background.but what hit me hardest was how quezon shows corruption not as an event, but as a tradition. it’s not a scandal that shows up one day it’s baked into the foundation. this movie doesn’t even need to say it outright; you just feel it in every handshake, every campaign promise, every smile that lasts one second too long.by the end, i wasn’t just watching a historical biopic it felt like a loop. like we’ve been here before. same speeches, different microphones. same dreams, slightly more polished lies.Quezon isn’t perfect, but maybe that’s what makes it hit. it’s hopeful and heavy at the same time like loving a country that keeps breaking your heart but you can’t walk away because it’s yours.",2025-10-19,0,0,watch,False
moviecatts,7,"If there’s an alamat of the pagiging Pinoy TraPo, maybe this is it... the origin story of politics as performance... (just for show, performative politicians 🫢).""Masyadong maraming pulitiko sa bansa, kakaunti lamang ang mga lingkod-bayan.""I hate history classes, but I love revisiting history through travel, museums, and movies. 😅 Quezon (2025) is exactly the kind of film that makes history come alive...even for those who never liked it.It’s funny, sharp, and feels like a political satire about the past that mirrors the present. The film follows former President Manuel L. Quezon’s political rise and how he played the game of politics brilliantly, but not always cleanly. If there’s an alamat of the Pinoy trapo, maybe this is it -- the origin story of politics as performance (just for show).Jericho Rosales nailed the role of Manuel L. Quezon. I’ve seen clips of the real Quezon before, and every time Rosales spoke, it felt like I was hearing the late president himself. They don’t even look alike, but he captured Quezon’s spirit perfectly. Benjamin Alves, who played the younger Quezon in the silent film sequences, also impressed me. Alves could easily carry the role in a full-length version too.Supporting actors also deserve credit. Romnick Sarmenta (as Osmeña) complements Rosales well. Karylle, as Aurora Quezon, was charming but underutilized, perhaps reflecting how women were sidelined back then. In contrast, Angeli Bayani, playing Aguinaldo’s wife, had limited screen time but left a strong impression. Mon Confiado’s take on Aguinaldo was refreshing, showing a more vulnerable side (though I still have to see the other movies in the Bayaniverse). Arron Villaflor and Cris Agustin, as Joven Hernando, were remarkable too,you almost forget they’re fictional characters.Though a biopic, the movie plays like a satire. It’s unserious but smartly so funny, biting, and painfully familiar. The humor lands because the parallels with today’s politics are impossible to ignore. Everything feels like ""pang front lang"" and the nation’s welfare often comes second to pride and image.As I said, it might just be the origin story of the Pinoy trapos. Maybe Quezon didn’t invent dirty politics but as Joven Hernando puts it, he perfected the game.By the end, you’ll find yourself asking: What does independence (independencia) really mean? Are we truly free, or have we simply learned to believe we are? Maybe it’s like Plato’s “noble lie”, a story told to keep people hopeful, obedient, and proud. Tayong mga Pilipino, ika nga ni Romnick Sarmenta bilang si Osmeña, “hindi naman tayo kulangot, pero bakit tayo binibilog?”Maybe it’s because we love beautiful stories, stories that let us escape, even when they blur the line between truth and illusion. Kailan kaya tayo tunay na lalaya mula sa mga politikong inuuna ang sarili bago ang sambayanan?at ’yun na nga... nabilog na kc tayo. Marahil, just like being a hero, independencia is often just a matter of perception.(i am just wondering how Quezon's descendants would react to this movie)",2025-10-18,120,0,watch,False

""Masyadong maraming politiko sa bansa, kaunti lang ang lingkod bayan."" --- almost a century later and we still fall for the same old tricks.Among the 3 Bayaniverse movies, the storytelling format of Quezon is what I enjoyed the most. Since MLQ is more of a political figure rather than a wartime hero, there were more interior scenes rather than landscape wide shots (which I loved from its 2 predecessors -- Heneral Luna & Goyo). Still, it felt like they're in a battlefield where one must fight in order to survive.Kudos to all the creatives behind this, for always using their art to disturb us, the comfortable masses. Madaling makalimot tayong mga Pilipino, at napakadali nating maniwala sa pangako ng pag-asa.

filmcirclerjct,8,"A decade ago, Jerrold Tarog asked the Filipino audience what it really meant to be a hero. With his Bayaniverse, he aimed to deconstruct the heroes that we've come to know during our history lessons as kids. In Heneral Luna (2015), he showed us the fiery and passionate patriotism that is willing to do anything to protect our freedom. It introduces the idea of mythmaking, as it positions the entire Philippine–American War into the hands of its protagonist, and by killing off the only person who could have led us to victory, the government simply proved that our biggest enemy was not the Americans but our own Filipino countrymen—ourselves.Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2018) breaks this down further, showing us that the hero we glorified all this time was nothing more than a blind fanatic who died a futile death out of his arrogance and lack of experience—all this time, all he had to offer was this confidence and loyalty to his president, and nothing more. Then came 2025's Quezon. As he states in the film:""Ang pagkabayani—it's all about perception"" (Being a hero—it's all about perception).Becoming the hero means you get to decide whose story gets to be told and how it is told.In this third and final installment of Tarog's Bayaniverse, we follow the life of Manuel L. Quezon (Jericho Rosales), who would go on and become the first Filipino elected to head a government of the entire Philippines after 34 years of being governed by American governor generals. All throughout the film, we see him in different stages of his life through different chapters, depicting how he manipulates his way from the bottom to the top, including his conflicted relationships with Sergio Osmeña (Romnick Sarmenta), governor-general Leonard Wood (Iain Glen), and even his former president, Emilio F. Aguinaldo (Mon Confiado).Penned by Tarog and Rody Vera, this concluding chapter of the Bayaniverse trilogy is a fun, engaging, yet biting and farcical take on its titular character's meteoric rise and eventual downfall. Intending to portray the historical figures in the film series often regarded as national heroes as ""flawed characters,"" the film, while showing the achievements they accomplished, also shows their cunning and manipulative tactics to get where they wanted to be.The best comparison I could come up with for Quezon is Orson Welles' 1941 film, Citizen Kane, which also features the rise and fall of its main protagonist (Quezon even opens with a series of silent films, similar to how Citizen Kane introduces its main character through a series of newsreels). It's structured similarly too, told in a nonlinear narrative. Unlike Heneral Luna and Goyo, Quezon is divided into several chapters, with each of these beginning with Quezon headbutting with someone to achieve his goal, highlighting how he played many political games to secure his survival and to maintain his power. Another departure for the film is its setting—while the first two films are set during the Philippine-American War, this latest film explores the period of American political supervision that followed, eventually leading to the founding of the Philippine Commonwealth. It doesn't have the big battle scenes of his first two predecessors and instead focuses on the war they fought within their offices and desks. Unlike its predecessor, whose battles occur in sweeping landscapes and terrains complete with all the explosions and gunfights, Quezon is mostly confined in enclosed spaces and is more dialogue-driven.It's also the most visually imaginative film in the trilogy, as it incorporates a series of silent films to create the myth behind Quezon's heroism. The film creates different tones to emphasize the varying timeline and mood for several sequences: black-and-white color grading for the silent film sequences, a vintage palette look to depict the time of the young Quezon (played by Benjamin Alves), realistic and vibrant three-strip Technicolor for the old Quezon, and a dull and dreary tone for Aguinaldo. This also highlights the difference between the way the public embraced Quezon and Aguinaldo's candidacy—one with color and life, while the other was marred by the death of Andres Bonifacio and Heneral Luna. The film's production design managed to stay true to its milieu too, beautifully captured on camera by Pong Ignacio, who returns from the last two films.Most importantly, the film depicts the evolution of two of the trilogy's most important characters: Joven Hernando and Emilio Aguinaldo. In the film, Joven is played by Arron Villaflor as the young version, while Cris Villanueva is the older one. Unlike in the first two films, where he is depicted as merely an observer for the two titular heroes, here in the third film, he becomes an active participant in the story. However, he is no longer the reliable narrator that he once was, as we realize that he himself has turned a blind eye to Quezon's flaws as an individual and as a politician. On the other hand, the film looks at Aguinaldo with a gentler and softer view, portraying him as this weakened veteran who tries to fight against the giant that Quezon eventually turns out to be in the film, falling victim to his propaganda.And this is where the film's strength lies: with its powerful cast. Mon Confiado delivers a more nuanced turn here as the veteran Emilio Aguinaldo, perfectly complemented by an equally restrained yet compelling performance from Angeli Bayani playing his wife, Maria Agoncillo-Aguinaldo. Arron Villaflor is brilliant as always portraying Joven Hernando, but Cris Villanueva adds another layer of depth to his character. Benjamin Alves also has an interesting part in the film, as he portrays the young Manuel Quezon but also as the actor portraying Quezon within the silent film world, existing on two separate planes and blurring the lines between fiction and reality and between the revised history and actual memory. Of course, Scottish actor Iain Glen deserves a special shoutout for his portrayal of Governor-General Leonard Wood. Karylle also deserves some praise for her understated yet exquisite performance as Aurora Quezon. Romnick Sarmenta also impresses as Sergio Osmeña. But the one who really carries the film from start to finish is none other than Jericho Rosales, with his committed performance as the titular Quezon. Honestly, I was expecting Manuel L. Quezon to have a somewhat full and deep voice, but when I saw the videos of his actual speeches, Rosales nailed his pitch and tone. It's fun to see Rosales as Quezon manipulates his way through politics using one trick after another. He dazzles with his stirring and dedicated turn as the late president, warts and all.Rosales perfectly captures the cunning nature of his character—a two-faced Janus head who uses deception and whispers sweet nothings to charm and manipulate everyone around him like chess pieces. With Quezon, Tarog delivers his ultimate thesis statement: that heroism isn't black or white. We have to understand the grey areas in between. The heroes depicted in his trilogy did a lot of good things that led them to be celebrated as the heroes they are known as now. But like any other human being, they also did some pretty bad things—and Quezon, sadly, did a lot. He inadvertently paved the way for patronage politics, or the spoils system, to take over our government—one that is still prevalent today. His intentions started out as noble—he wants to give the Philippines the independence it has sought after for so many years. But along the way, he realizes that he has to play by the rules, bend some promises, and ultimately lie for what he believes is good for the country. Sadly, the things that he did led him to crave and hold on to his power for as long as he could.Later, Quezon exclaims:""I am the Filipino people. I am the Philippines."" He spent the entire film creating this image of him as the only person who could bring independence to this country—by hook or by crook. But as we see his final image in the film, we all come to the very conclusion that Quezon is nothing but a megalomaniac. He is not the savior he thinks he is. He is but a man.Flawed. Fallible.

migsser,9,"I always had a keen interest in history. I think this started with my likes to learn about what happened before and knowing all these famous people that the cartoons and shows I watched as a kid that keep on referencing, such as Thomas Jerferson, Benjamin Franklin, etc. This was further cemented by the social studies classes we had that focused on historical events of the world and the like. Philippine history was one and this led me to be more appreciative of what we went through as a nation. Naturally, this pushed me to more interested with movies that portrayed this events, even tho they weren't as accurate to what they wanted to represented *Ahem* El Presidente *Ahem* Fast forward to the release of Heneral Luna and Goyo, I was blown by how the films tried to show these people with a degree of understanding that wasn't as seen in previous historical movies portraying Heroes. Luna and Goyo made me feel angry and surprised, respectively. And now with Quezon, rarely do I get to see Philippine cinema being continued like this. One that continues to show how the past can be a reflection of what we are today, especially when it comes to politics. Its dirty, bloody and downright a game to some. I was sceptical at first with the announcement of Jericho taking the role of Quezon. All those worries faded once he got lost into this performance as the convicing, and coniving, president. Past and new characters were also introduced, adding so much to the story and how they all relate to one another. They portrayed well the friendly banters, conversations, and even betrayals. This connectedness and being one in a shared universe is amazing and works well with this film and the films before, even if each one feels different and stands on their own. The Bayaniverse feels like a proper universe and one that I wish for more Filipino films. This is a culmination of trying to define and portray heroes in ways that don't treat them to be outright heroes. No, these are people who are both perpratrators and victims of their own aspirations, dreams, agendas, laurels and even mistakes. This further pushes us to question those who led us before, and even those who lead us in the present. I'm looking forward for more films like this.

gerigravity,8,"Hindi kasing emotionally charged ng Heneral Luna, o kasing tahimik at mapanuri ng Goyo, ngunit may sariling bigat at diin ang Quezon. Dito, ang digmaan ay wala na sa larangan ng putukan; nasa entablado na ng pulitika. At gaya ng lahat ng magagandang palabas, bawat ngiti, bawat pakikipagkamay, at bawat pangako ay may kasamang pinag-ensayuhang pananalita.Jericho Rosales delivers one of his best performances yet: charming, makinis, pero mapanganib. Bilang Manuel L. Quezon, hindi siya ipininta bilang bayani kundi bilang isang politiko na marunong maglaro ng sistema. Hindi niya winawasak ang istruktura ng katiwalian; siya mismo ang bumuo nito. Ang trapo sa katauhan ni Quezon ay isang masalimuot na larawan ng kapangyarihan. Nakakatawa siya sa kanyang karisma ngunit nakakikilabot sa likod ng ngiti, kung saan namamayani ang tuso at mapanlinlang na pag-iisip.Ang direksyon ni Jerrold Tarog ay mas pulido at teatrikal kumpara sa unang dalawang pelikula. Halata ang diin sa blocking, sa staging ng mga eksena, at sa simbolismo. Parang chess match na bawat galaw ay may kapalit. Ang cinematography ay malinis, kulay-aristokratiko, at puno ng simetrya, na tila ipinapakita kung paanong ginawang perpektong entablado ang politika. Ang musical scoring naman ay naglalaro sa pagitan ng dalamhati at panunukso, na tila tugtugin ng isang entablado kung saan ang kapangyarihan ay ginagawang palabas.Hindi ito kasing-sakit ng Heneral Luna o kasing-lalim ng Goyo, ngunit mararamdaman mo ang maruming realidad ng politika. Naroon ang mga kasinungalingang nakabalot sa magarang retorika, at kung paanong ang kalayaan ay maaaring gamitin bilang produkto ng kampanya. Dito mo makikita kung saan nagsimula ang mga siklong hindi pa rin tapos hanggang ngayon: utang na loob, padrino system, at ang walang katapusang pagbilog sa ulo ng taumbayan.Tarog closes the Bayaniverse not with a scream or a whisper but with a smirk. Isang paalala na ang ating bansa ay itinayo hindi lang sa dugo ng mga bayani kundi sa galing ng mga manlalarong marunong tumaya. Sa dulo, hindi mo alam kung matatawa ka o maiiyak, dahil ang pelikulang ito ay parehong kasaysayan at salamin: mapanlinlang, maganda, at masakit tanggapin.Hindi ito aral tungkol sa kabayanihan; ito ay babala tungkol sa kapangyarihan.Sa pagtatapos ng Quezon, tila tayo ay nanonood ng salamin na bumabalik sa ating paningin. Dito natin nakikita na ang politika ay matagal nang pagtatanghal, at ang mga aktor ay nagpapalit lang ng kasuotan.

miggyber,9,"Small kwento: We saw Mon Confiado before watching the film kasi may surprise talkback session siguro before our showtime. We asked for a photo, then ang sabi niya sa amin: “Please review the film. Bad or good, it’s okay.”I actually didn’t want to watch Quezon yet kasi gusto ko may talkback. I really wish every screening of Quezon had one. Somehow, it’s not enough that we just witnessed what happened on screen. It’s also important to have a discourse about it.I understand that would be difficult and probably impossible to do for every showing. But it's a nice to have. Jerrold and the cast spent months or even years researching these heroes, and it feels lacking if all that effort just ends in a two-hour movie. I’m sure there were stories cut short or ideas that couldn’t be fully explored. It would’ve been so nice to hear more about it directly from them.So we ended up dissecting the film among ourselves after watching. The first thing we all said was how Quezon made it so easy to understand Manuel Luis Quezon. The film is divided into chapters, and in each one, it’s clear who he’s up against and what they are fighting about. And in every chapter, he always comes out winning.Quezon is unafraid to exhaust all his resources and even resort to dirty tricks to gain the upper hand. He can come up with unorthodox ways to defeat his enemies, and sometimes, he even teams up with them to take down bigger and badder ones. Quezon is just good at what he does. But he also thinks so highly of himself as the savior of the Philippines that it eventually becomes his downfall.It’s all very interesting. Like Luna and Goyo, Quezon is deeply flawed. In our minds, he's a great president for bringing independence to the country. But we all agreed that we never really saw Quezon this way before. It’s also amazing how the old problems in the film mirror the issues we still see in Philippine politics today. Maybe even worse.I’d say Quezon is a must-watch. We had a blast watching it, and it’s even better when you get to talk about it afterward with friends or family.",2025-10-18,0,0,watch,True

itos,8,"watched in a block screening of my tito who plays nieto!!welcome to philippine politics — where everything is a game, and things can get messy. this is such a rich character study on manuel quezon, backed by a generational performance from jericho rosales. quezon really laid out the foundations of how a filipino leader is made; through the manipulation of power and by being really loud. production-wise this is a huge step up from goyo even if there aren’t any war scenes — the PD and the cinematography really leveled up, like wow. slight complaint but i think the choice to use arron villaflor in most of the flashbacks was poor, because it got kind of confusing when we’d have flashbacks with jericho rosales as the old quezon but have arron villaflor as a young joven — though it did click eventually, it could have been much smoother if they just used cris villanueva and used make-up on him to make him a bit younger. but still, a really well-done film… magsaysay movie next? 👀watched in SM Aura cinema, director’s club",2025-10-19,1,0,watch,True

You are conflicted as you should be. There are no favorites.What we have left to root for is the normal citizen, Joven, that is genuis as the film's creative liberty that represents us as filipinos and honesty which is all we need and Cris Villanueva's role for me, just blends into another great film he's in about deconstructing the strucuture for a flawed hero that is José Rizal in Bayaning 3rd World.

ehrnjhn,10,"“The Philippine Assembly is yours—body and soul.”#QUEZON felt pretty much of a movie closer to our present day than did Heneral Luna and Goyo. I suppose it could be because of the timeline, but the events in this movie mirrored the present more harrowingly and realistically.I must say that my favorite scene in the film has to be the scene when a hauntingly troubled Aguinaldo was climbing up the stage in what pretty much seemed to be a miting de avance some time before the 1935 elections. When it was Aguinaldo’s turn to speak, he rose from his seat and walked towards the stage as the charming Quezon climbed down parallel to him. The background music intensified. The room did not know of the weight of the moment for Aguinaldo—only he and his Vice Presidential running mate Raymundo Melliza knew of what seemed to be their greatest leverage in the elections and against Quezon for all we know. The living evidence was there, present in that one corner—Quezon’s alleged first wife—a seemingly powerful instrument that could determine Quezon’s reputation. Aguinaldo had a smoking gun. Even I sat in the audience wondering, “Would he drop the ball?” Though Melliza was right in saying that they had no formal proof that the woman and Quezon were indeed married, the positive assertion could spark reasonable doubt on the perceived savior of the Philippines that is Quezon. The visibly horrified, pale-faced Quezon was standing aghast—would Aguinaldo get his own hands dirty as well? Perhaps, Aguinaldo’s option not to pursue the scheme significantly supported the image he had throughout the film: a noble, self-redeeming character in the nation’s struggle for independence who played the bigger man and refused to revenge out of spite.Another interesting point that made me leave the theater with more questions than answers was the re-introduction of Capt. Janolino, the man who made the first blow on Hen. Luna upon alleged orders from Aguinaldo some three decades ago. History tells us that Ka Miong purportedly sent four telegrams to the general, instructing the general to meet with him in Cabanatuan. Janolino sent the first attack, striking the general in the face while the others followed suit. In the film, Janolino was brought to Joven, the fictional figure, in order to clear his own conscience and finally become the man who lived to tell the tale. Janolino told Joven that his conscience no longer could contain the guilt, and that Aguinaldo indeed ordered the Luna massacre while handing Joven one of the four telegrams.History is not just about going back to the past, or connecting it to the present; it, too, is about questioning the narratives that we have long grown up believing, and more importantly, questioning what really was the truest truth about the motives of the people that shaped our history, yes, even forty, sixty, or ninety years apart. There is no question that Janolino was a blessing that came to Quezon’s lap at the right place and in the right time. We know the man. Quezon was too old of a hand in politics, or rather, in the craftsmanship of political manipulation. Quezon had Janolino as his final act of ragebait against Aguinaldo, leading to the latter’s eventual loss in the elections. But the question that left me mentally running in circles was, was Janolino really sincere in coming forward? Or was he yet another opportunist who took the chance to clear his name before anything happens to his life? Worst, was he yet another strategist who switched sides when it was most convenient to feast at the banquet of Quezon’s Senate as his Sergeant-at-Arms? We never know. We could only do so much as cast a doubt on true intentions, no matter how impractical, to really arrive at the truth. Was Janolino’s coming forward an altruistic move, or was it a plot to be thyself’s own saving grace? If you know the reference, good for you.Anyhow, despite the complicated cable spaghetti of neophyte Philippine politics, one can deduce but a single, unfortunate fact that not even Quezon, in a hypothetical redemption moment of his, could deny, and it is this: that corruption is as old as time, and that much of what we see today is utterly of little to no difference with what the country suffered before. It’s all a real déjà vu, only worse. “The Philippine Assembly is yours—body and soul.” If, before, the yours Quezon “sold” the people to are the Americans, now, the ones who sold the Filipino people and the yours these people are sold to are our fellow Filipinos: politicians who connive among themselves to lay bare the people as mere commodities. I am not so sure for everybody else but to me, that sounds like holding up a mirror in the face of Philippine history, except this time, the canon events seem more horrid.May the lessons of history cease to remain as lessons. May we make them cease to remain as lessons. Vote wisely. Think critically. Fight courageously.———PS: Props to Echo! A brilliant artist in the last of Bayaniverse trilogy.

mango_mikay,10,"“ Independence is good enough to eat “Quezon stands out from the bayaniverse movies that came before it — whereas Heneral Luna and Goyo had themes of war, Quezon portrayed political dramas, intellectual battles, and the performance of Manuel Quezon as a political leader. Quezon goes beyond its purpose of entertainment, it is a reminder of all the wrongdoings of our leaders due the mind games these leaders have instilled into our political system. The film is very timely for our political milieu, it shows how politics is like a game of chess — you take as much as you can from your opponent until they have nothing left. Politics aside, this film knows how to tell a story creatively. I enjoyed the “film within a film” aspect without it falling flat or cliché, I found it extremely satisfying. Cinematography ? FUTANGINA ANG GANDA. Every scene feels so cohesive and proper, like a political debate of some sort. I loved the juxtaposition between Quezon and Aguinaldo’s scenes — the loud and blaring music and overbearing lighting for Quezon, and the almost quiet and dull lighting for Aguinaldo. Everything was so tight knit and well executed and truly added more to the story.

tteokbomi,8,"The movie Quezon was really nice because it showed a different side of President Manuel L. Quezon that we don’t usually see in our history lessons. In school, we just learn that he was the first president of the Commonwealth and made Tagalog the national language. But in the film, he was shown as a kind and brave person who truly cared for people. One scene that touched me was when he helped the Jewish refugees during World War II. It showed how he wanted to save lives even if it was hard for him and his government.If I compare Quezon’s time to politics now, I feel like there’s a big difference. Quezon really cared about people, while some politicians today care more about fame and power. The way Quezon stood up for what was right reminded me that leaders should have strong values like honesty, courage, and compassion.The movie made me realize that our country needs leaders like Quezon—people who think about others before themselves.

I didn’t notice the over 120-minute runtime unlike in Goyo.I will forever bang the drum for more Romnick Sarmenta roles. It was also refreshing to see JC Santos being treated the way Nolan treated Rami Malek in Oppenheimer (which is definitely an influence here). I needed more of the talky genre here though.

popscicle,9,"The press releases brand Quezon as the third in Jerrold Tarog's ""BAYANIverse"" trilogy, but it's quite clear early into the film that Manuel L. Quezon, the second President of the Philippines, doesn't quite live up to the term ""bayani"" or hero. Yes, he was instrumental in taking the country through its first steps into independence from its colonial masters, but the film also unabashedly shows him as manipulative, petty, and spiteful. Worst of all, particularly in the context of today's incendiary socio-political climate, the film explicitly blames him for laying the foundations for the patronage politics that has plagued the country for decades. It's certainly not stress-free viewing for those among us who are already anxious over our current national situation.If his highly skilled work on the gem Sana Dati and the first two entries in the BAYANIverse films, Heneral Luna and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, did not manage to convince you that Tarrog is one of Pinoy cinema's most masterful directors, this film should. His direction of Quezon is superb. Sequences are creatively and tightly shot, producing a beautiful rhythm that belies the films runtime of over two hours. The [silent] film-within-a-film is a very nice touch, showcasing Tarrog's ability to balance pathos and humor, and also conveniently explaining why young Quezon is played by another actor (Benjamin Alves) in the first two films. Jericho Rosales is pitch-perfect as Quezon. His Quezon is cocky and assured, but also vulnerable and volatile. Cursory surveys of old video and audio clips of Quezon make it clear how well former matinee idol Rosales captures the Commonwealth President's vocal cadence, but the way he moves his body, a lot of which is presumably not visible in most existing videos, gives him ownership of the character. Rosales has proven his acting mettle in previous turns in both film and television, but this is probably the role that he was born to play. Among the supporting actors, the highlight is Mon Confiado as Emilio Aguinaldo, owning the role to the point that it's probably difficult to think of any other actor doing it as successfully. Confiado is often an uneven and divisive actor especially when it comes to loud, overtly physical characters, but here he shows how skilled he is with more quiet, introspective roles. The ever-reliable Romnick Sarmenta as Sergio Osmena, Bodjie Pascua as Raymundo Melliza, and Angeli Bayani as Maria Agoncillo also give laudable turns. Meanwhile, Karylle, who is no slouch in acting, is barely given anything to do as First Lady Aurora Quezon, which is a shame because of Mrs. Quezon's stature in Philippine history.The technical details are admirable, particularly the editing and the production design, which provides a genuine period look and feel to the film. The black-and-white scenes give lenser Pong Ignacio room to play with light, but it's rather unfortunate that the makeup on the actors during those sequences makes them look like the ghouls from Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls. The true standout, however, is the score (by Tarrog himself), which propels the film's pace with alternating whimsy and somberness, and it never feels out of place or overly used (which is very common in local films).Quezon is a true cinematic achievement. For both its quality and its socio-political message, it is must-see Pinoy cinema. Sure, it takes liberties with historical accuracy (the filmmakers are quick to disabuse us of the notion that it's meant to be fully historically accurate), but it asks the right questions, just as Heneral Luna did (remember its iconic ""Bayan o sarili?"" challenge?). Hopefully, the film's message does not fall on deaf ears and will further drive the social movement for true accountability and patriotism in governance.",2025-10-18,3,0,watch,True

ownhrl,8,"One of the poems I memorized back in elementary school was actually about him, but it never really introduced me to who Manuel L. Quezon truly was or what his role in our history meant. Growing up, I only knew few of his personal and political life from HEKASI and Sibika’t Kultura textbooks, so watching the film was full of surprises, every twist and turn caught my attention and kept me hooked.The reason why I love the Bayaniverse series is because it doesn’t just retell history, it shows the lives of our national heroes and questions what truly makes them a hero… or not. Take him, Quezon, for example. I found myself asking, Was he really a hero? Or could he also be a villain? Maybe Quezon was indeed a hero in governance and nationalism, but also a politician with many flaws. Through this film, we saw his strong will, pride, and even arrogance.Jericho Rosales, who played Quezon, did an amazing job. Honestly, if I had known that TJ Trinidad backed out of the role, I wouldn’t have thought of anyone else who could replace him. When it was announced that Echo would play Quezon, I was doubtful at first, mainly because they don’t look alike. But after watching the trailer and hearing him on Quezon’s accent, I said to myself, “Ayos 'to!” and I was right. His performance made Quezon feel real and relatable, showing not just the hero, but the man behind the title. His accent was consistent from start to finish, and the rest of the cast did great too, especially Romnick Sarmienta as Sergio. And for the first time, Joven Hernando’s role actually made sense to me, even though he doesn’t exist in real life.The music? I loved it. Just wow. It felt like a roller coaster of emotions, especially during the tense moments. Every background score matched perfectly with each shot. And the cinematography? Definitely a step up from Heneral Luna and Goyo. I didn’t expect the “film within a film” concept, but it worked beautifully.Overall, it was a great film, probably a fitting end to the Bayaniverse. Totally worth every peso spent and definitely a must watch Filipino historical film.

It successfully and awkwardly shows us a mirror that continuously slaps us Filipinos in the face real hard with questions about fake independence and our failure as a nation, after Heneral Luna (2015) and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2017).Jericho Rosales played the role to the tee, an opportunity of a lifetime, with enough force and conviction. Other cast who stood out were Iain Glenn who played Leonard Wood and Mon Confiado's Emilio Aguinaldo. So entertaining to see Manuel L Quezon, Emilio Aguinaldo, Sergio Osmeña and Manuel Roxas, who I only used to see in paper bills, got brilliantly fleshed out on screen. Jose Rizal wrote Noli and Fili to provoke the nation para magalit, because anger signifies that we've had enough and that we need to take action.

This trilogy sensationalizes these historical figures and is over-acted by much of its cast (although let's face it, that's a common issue within Philippine cinema), but it is also intentional in creating a narrative about the Bayani that makes a lot of sense when you look at the trilogy as a whole. Like the first two movies, this movie has so many odd creative choices where the intention is in full display but doesn't really serve the overall narrative. Case in point for this film, while the writing is funny at times, it feels so hollow because it's so evidently trying to get a laugh from its audience but fails in its purpose because it detracts from the story rather than enriches it. Many other such choices can be pointed out all across the trilogy. Overall though, I have to give Tarog his flowers. The trilogy has inspired renewed national interest in our history and revisits our national heroes in a way that invites us to re-evaluate where the education we received about them might have been wrong.",2025-10-19,2,0,watch,False

ayesak21,8,"Body and Soul.Finally got to witness the end of a saga that I can personally say I grew up on. As someone who loves history the “Bayaniverse” is franchise close to my heart. This time we got to do a character study on Manuel Luis Quezon. A man who is a prominent figure of our history. A political chameleon as to how others describe him. Heneral Luna was the “dagitab” that started it all, Goyo is fine film that dealt with the immediate aftermath of its predecessor and Quezon is this franchise’s final salvo. The pacing of the film is good. I liked how each scenes was able to give tension and stakes. My only nitpick was how the first hour of the film had a slower pace and then as we approach the end it felt rushed but maybe this was made so that it echoes Quezon’s desperate cling to power he built. Each scene felt like a game of chess and it is what kept me entertained. As a history fan I love it when I recognize people or events the people on the film talk about. Jericho Rosales as Manuel Quezon? Superb. How he speaks, his mannerisms, his quips were all spot-on. It was like I was really watching MLQ. Romnick Sarmienta as Sergio Osmeña shower how resolve and silence can both be a good and a bad thing. I wish JC Santos and Karylle had more screentime as I believe their performances were also so good. Mon Confiado as an older version of Emilio Aguinaldo was also a delight to watch. Ibang iba sa mga naunang Aguinaldo and I saw comments na they pity the old man but the way I saw it it, it was his karma that came to bite him.Quezon is a different film from the first two, it is not riddled with guns and canons, there is no physical war. Sabi nga ni Wood “We are fighting behind desks” and this political warfare is entertaining, riveting, and at most times fascinating. Nilatag sa atin kung paanong ang isang taong magaling sa manipulasyon at pamumulitika ay pinapaboran ng panahon.

Sarmenta, in particular, is a complete scene stealer. Other than the acting and the pacing, Quezon is mostly lackluster in terms of storytelling.

The script, while commendable on its structure, features some really underwhelming dialogue that feels less punchy than its predecessors.

Simula pa nung una, ang ating gobyerno ay itinatag sa maliliit na pabor na lumaki bilang utang na loob. Utang na loob na di na mabayad-bayaran. Totoo bang nakamit na natin ang kalayaan? Ang independencia? O ipinahiram lang ito sa atin at balang araw ay babawiin ito kapalit ng tulong ng ibang bansa?Pinanood namin ng mga kaibigan ko ang Heneral Luna, Angelito, at Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral upang maalala ang mga pangyayari bago kami sumabak sa Quezon. Isa pang nangyari sa akin ay pinanood ko ang Pingkian: Isang Musikal na storya ni Emilio Jacinto haka noong siya ay nagdedeliryo sa tama ng baril noong panahon ng himagsikan. Isa sa unang linya ng musikal ay ang mga katagang,""Doon sa Biyak na Bato, pinatigil ang putukan. Isinuko ni Aguinaldo ang apoy ng himagsikan!"" True to his style, ipinakita ni Direk Jerrold ang tao sa likod ng pagiging bayani. Na kahit isang matalinong heneral si Antonio, siya ay mainitin ang ulo at mapusok. Na kahit si Goyo ang paboritong Heneral ni Aguinaldo, siya ay nababalot ng takot kung ano ba talaga ang kanyang hinaharap, at bilang isang bata, hindi niya rin alam kung sino talaga siya. Sa dalawang pelikula ay makikilala mo rin si Aguinaldo, ang ating unang presidente, na nakadikit sa mga mayayamang miyembro ng kanyang gabinete. Unang tumatakbo pag parating na ang mga amerikano, at dala ang kanyang buong pamilya sa isang mahabang lakarin.May tatlong karakter akong hinihintay na makita; si Aguinaldo na kabado ako kung ano ang kanyang magiging storya. Siya ba ay bibigyan ng redemption arc? Si Quezon na tuso at naging batayan ng political warfare sa atin ngayon, At si Joven na tumanda na. Ginawa upang irepresent ang kabataan, ngunit ano na kaya ang kinahantungan niya ngayon? Masaya akong malaman na lahat ng teorya ko sa palabas na ito ay mali, and it has exceeded ALL my expectations. Panoorin mo nalang kung gusto mong malaman kung bakit. Pero masasabi ko na sinasalamin nga ni Joven ang kabataan, lalo na ang mga kabataang ipinaglaban ang bayan noong bata pa, ngunit noong tumanda ay nahumaling sa mga taong ipinangako ang kalayaang kanyang tinatamasa, kaya nagbulag-bulagan sa mga maling gawain kapalit ng mabuti. The end justifies the means ika nga nila.Napakahusay ng pelikula na ito, sa direksyon, cinematography, sa acting (hindi si Jericho ang makikita mo kundi si Quezon), costume, at production. Halatang tumaas ang budget hahaha. Well versed kami ng kaibigan ko sa kasaysayan, dala ng guro namin noong highschool na napakagaling magturo ng AP st World History. Parehas naming minahal ang kasaysayan dahil sa isang guro na itinuro ang lahat samin nang buong pagmamahal. Pero hindi pa rin itinuturo sa mga kabataan ang lahat. Marami pa ring mga accounts na kung gusto mong makita at marinig upang mapagaralan ay kailangan mong saliksikin ang mga ito. Sana ma-engganyo ang mga kabataan na saliksikin pa ang ating kasaysayan, sa labas ng mga petsa, sa labas ng exams at quizzes. Dahil paulit-ulit lang ang mga nangyayari sa ating bansa.

acebron,7,"Coming from the unbridled fury of Heneral Luna and the reflective nature of Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral, this installment takes us to the performance of nation-building, set not in battlefields but at podiums and facing cameras. Quezon, as the third larger-than-life figure, enjoys high production value as well, even if the centerpieces are explosive conversations and political machinations rather than fight scenes.Rosales as Quezon is a spectacle, with his high-pitched Tagalog-accented voice that mimics the gravitas of a transatlantic declamatory statesman. It matches, too, with the crux of his character being that of a man who learned from the Americans’ game of politics, and brought it back home. His performance and chemistry with the rest of the cast (namely his hilarious toxic yaoi push-and-pull with Sarmenta’s Osmeña and his dogged face-off with Confiado’s Aguinaldo) make a strong case for this film being the most entertaining of the three.Unfortunately, it may also be the one with the least heart in it. The senseless politicking and pandering to the promise of independence at any cost includes a pessimistic, self-referential plot point for the journalist character and his filmmaker daughter. The two fall prey to making propaganda for Quezon but ultimately can't make any definitive, concrete stand. It succeeds at holding up a mirror to the audience members watching, who decry corruption and bad governance, but cannot suggest or invoke any alternative. Quezon is a strong biopic and historical drama that satirizes politics through sensational slapstick moments starring some of the Philippines’ most known figures from the American period. For a dialogue-heavy film, it’s thrilling to follow thanks to its playful structure, making it stand out from its two predecessors which were mainly linear and battle-focused.What it didn’t really account for was the impact of Quezon’s actions. It only focused on the political spectacle that worsens the state of the nation and makes the dream of independence unreachable, even laughable. There’s a small scene where a farmer reveals that most people don’t understand what independence means. The film doesn’t explore beyond that — how the Filipino politicians and the American occupiers take advantage of this ignorance, what the average Filipino’s life is like, and why independence is such a pipe dream. Perhaps there we could have found the film’s heart.Full review here.",2025-10-16,0,0,watch,False

lewser_gf,9,"“utang na loob”a filipino value that still lingers the filipino society to this day, may it be in its smallest form or one that murks around the walls within our government: patronage politics. in the movie, it highlights how Manuel Quezon essentially gave birth to patronage politics in our nation’s government with how he deliberately moves around the walls of politics to set himself as the one with the most decorated achievements among his peers and foes. politics is a game for him. and in the end, he will use all his power to remain at the podium. all this to feed his ego. i believe that the release of this movie is relevant to the current issues Philippines is battling with today. just like Manuel Quezon, many politicians use “utang na loob” to their advantage, for their self-interest, which cost the lives of many ordinary Filipino people who are struggling everyday to make a living. moreso, this movie serves as a wake-up call to Filipinos that we must no longer be tolerant of how damaging patronage politics is to our society, especially on the topic of nepotism. i hope that one day, the concept of “utang na loob” will be redefined by generations to come. i hope that we open our eyes to see how this Filipino value has taken the route of submission to the one who has given you generosity. i hope that us, Filipinos, will one day, fully understand how “utang na loob” has impacted us in the grand scheme of things.",2025-10-20,0,0,watch,True

rjbandres,8,"As the Bayaniverse concludes with the film Quezon, we are left to ponder: Who are truly considered heroes? Does Heneral Luna—who, despite his temperamental and tactless nature, led his men to fight for the country at the cost of their own lives—fit the mold of a hero? How about the composed and charismatic Heneral del Pilar, known for his loyalty to President Emilio Aguinaldo? Or is it Manuel Luis Quezon, the first President of the Philippine Commonwealth, who relentlessly championed the nation’s independence?Unlike the tension-driven Heneral Luna or the meditative Goyo, Quezon leans toward diplomacy and vision—the making of a statesman rather than a soldier. Mon Confiado, reprising his role as El Presidente Aguinaldo, provides a strong emotional bridge across the trilogy. His nuanced performance ties the films together with quiet power—a fitting irony, given how Aguinaldo outlived these three who once served under him. Jericho Rosales, meanwhile, delivers a commanding portrayal of Quezon—a politician who knows how to play the game of politics, both as one of the chess pieces and as the one who moves them. This may well be the most compelling performance of Rosales’ career. Rosales and Romnick Sarmenta, who plays Sergio Osmeña, show an undeniable chemistry that is utterly entertaining. This dynamic between Quezon and Osmeña is refreshing to see, and is something that I just discovered from the film.While the cast performed well and Tarog's vaudeville-inspired storytelling was interesting, there was no singular standout in the film. The attempt to encapsulate Quezon's life after reading through 50 reference books made the narrative feel dense and uneven. The intent to inform and educate was there, but it came at the expense of smooth transitions and richer character development. A minor subtitle error (""kada buwan"" translated as ""per year"") is forgivable, but the lack of emotional buildup for the audience was a missed opportunity.Many historical moments were highlighted, yet the film fell short in conveying their emotional and moral implications. Still, the complicated feelings I had after watching it are proof that the filmmakers succeeded in presenting a layered, complex figure in Quezon.In the end, the Bayaniverse is more than a trilogy of historical films—it is a mirror reflecting who we were, who we are, and who we hope to become as Filipinos. Through Luna's fury, Goyo's doubt, and Quezon's ambition, we are reminded that heroism is not born from perfection or victory, but from conviction and purpose. Perhaps instead of searching for a hero to emulate or a leader to inspire today's generation, it may be far better to embrace a collective effort—despite our differences—to build the change we have long yearned for across generations. Tarog's decade-long storytelling, with all its flaws and brilliance, draws us back to the past that shaped us and rekindles our desire to strive for a nation better than the one we inherited.",2025-10-18,0,0,watch,False

gabofgreengable,8,"The last entry in the Bayaniverse trilogy which aims to deconstruct historical figures. Kudos to the production design and the cast which was of high quality ever since Heneral Luna 10 years ago.Jericho Rosales did very well in acting especially on his accent. The film showed Quezon as this political figure who was great in playing the politics game. I liked how Aguinaldo mentioned the difference between being a public servant and being a politician. It was interesting to see the dynamics of Casey and Serging (Quezon and Osmena) and I found their conversations amusing. In my interpretation, the coin that Quezon gave to Joven is a form of utang na loob which is kind of rooted in our politics relating to the padrino system.I wish that the patronage politics was explored a bit more though.Personally, I would have liked this film even more if it had more runtime because a part of me felt they condensed all that they could into the movie runtime. I hope TBA studios gets to have miniseries for more comprehensive storytelling. All in all, congrats to the Quezon team and TBA studios for pulling off a wonderful Bayaniverse trilogy which I hope would just be the start of many more films to come.",2025-10-19,0,0,watch,False

I HATED THE TRAILER, I DIDNT LIKE THE FACT THAT IT WAS GONNA CENTER AROUND POLITICS AND NOT BRAVERY, HEROISM, AND JUSTICE FOR THE FILIPINOS!! But oh my days I was so wrong, I love it sm (not Manuel Quezon obvi).This truly acknowledged the lack of information given to me about the presidents of the Philippines. Politics truly is a silver lining, there is no good or bad, ""it's just politics."" This movie truly made the loudest statement of how corruption GREW in the Philippines but I have yet to research and make an informed opinion, but this— this was truly something. It isn't like the rest of the ""Bayani"" films I've watched— no war, no bloodshed, just politics. Also shows how us voters HAVE to dig deeper on the track record of our candidates and CREATE informed decisions if whether or not their mistakes should be forgiven. It truly takes critical thinking to assess our presidential candidates if they truly wish the best for the people or they only wish the best for themselves.I keep repeating about critical thinking, informed decisions, research, but I cannot stress this enough. PEOPLE NEED TO LEARN TO READ MORE! Anyways the movie was great, the overall aesthetic of the film was amazing. Jericho truly EMBODIEEEED Manuel Quezon and cutie patootie Sergio Osmeña, huhu kaluoy.

pdfig,8,"The last of the Bayaniverse trilogy unfolds almost in tension with the first. While Heneral Luna (2015) almost glorifies nationalism and patriotism as the purest routes to independence, Quezon exposes a more unsettling truth: that nation-building, too, can be an enterprise of deception, politicking, and personal ambition.What struck me just as deeply was the film’s portrayal of the media. In the same way we inherited American politics and governance, we also inherited their media system. In the film, the two are almost indistinguishable. For Quezon, media is political machinery; politics, in turn, is media spectacle.To its credit, Quezon is an unforgiving dissection of a cunning man long revered in Philippine history as the architect of constitutional democracy. The film spares no illusions: it renders him not as a flawless hero, but as an American lackey who wielded independence as a political instrument for self-fulfillment. In the buildup to his presidential campaign, he is almost canonized as a saint, a portrayal that feels eerily symmetrical to the myth-making that defines our politics of today.I also think about Joven, how in Luna he was the youth whose fire needed to be fanned. Now, in Quezon, he was the people, blamed for falling victim to — and almost being complicit for having benefitted from — the very system of patronage. But the film offers more than this bobotante framing, as we observe Joven quite literally see through blind faith. Although the film had the tendency to slip into a romanticized treatment of Aguinaldo, it compels reflection on our country’s institutional memory. Why do we not know this Quezon: the ambitious, calculating politician beneath the marble statue? Why have patronage and our reverence for the West endured as the constants that anchor our political imagination? And why, almost a century later, do we find ourselves in the same predicament, still circling the same myths of power and nationhood?",2025-10-17,1,0,watch,True

franzoysauce,8,"“I am the Philippines”The clashing philosophy is the undercurrent that carries this movie. It isn't explicitly delivered; it's not visible on the surface, but it is deeply embedded for those who look closely enough. We witness the vivid interpretation of the rise and fall of a truly great figure, supported by compelling storytelling. The cinematography is strong, the acting is excellent, and the production design is surely top-notch.However, I can recognize that the movie's portrayal was somewhat tempered. We move from a brutal Luna and the edginess of Goyo to a Quezon who feels more approachable, child friendly, fun, and bright. Perhaps this interpretation reflects an intentional focus on Quezon’s charisma, or maybe it’s simply how the filmmakers intended for us to view his specific burden.I deeply admire the film's message—the political philosophy—and how acutely it mirrors our current government. It forces us to confront the question of how we arrived at this point. The answer, the film suggests, is woven into our history; the seeds were planted long before we were born. This system is so profoundly rooted that it cannot be simply plucked out. This, right here, is absolute storytelling. The core concept isn't forcefully presented to the audience; instead, the film allows us to arrive at the message through our own contemplation.There is much more to discuss, but the direction and storytelling are what I loved most. I can confidently say that those who see this as the least installment in the trilogy are missing the point. Each movie is a unique and great piece on its own.

jhonaustria_,8,"Ang lahat ng ito ay politika lamang, walang personalan.Just watched Quezon, and it awakened that history buff inside of me. Like Heneral Luna and Goyo, this was well done. It does complete the trilogy of what truly defines a political figure in the Philippine context. Its narrative and screenplay are peak, I adore the score, editing and art direction, and the production design was so good. Very interesting to see the early days of pork barrel, patronage politics, media ""envelopes"", and dirty tricks. Power play and mind game at its finest.Quezon, in its very core, is a film that presents itself as satirical, perhaps offering a timely commentary on the Philippines’ current political landscape and the ongoing struggle with personality politics. Themes including power and ambition just resonate with contemporary issues in the Philippines, sparking important conversations about governance and nation-building. I do commend Quezon’s portrayal here, as if he were a challenged hero who is worshipped. Jericho Rosales’ portrayal of Quezon was commanding; he brought depth and nuance to the role, capturing the former president’s complexities and leadership style. His performance conveyed the character’s passion, conviction, charisma, and flaws, making Quezon relatable and human. In addition, Mon Confiado was quietly powerful as Aguinaldo. While the film doesn't glorify Quezon, it reveals the cracks and how ambition can stain even the purest intentions until history decides whether you're an ideal or a sinner. There is more to be discussed in the historical events depicted. Politics is a game of thrones, mula noon hanggang ngayon.Quirky, silly and indeed a good game. It is a must-watch.

redastro,8,"Waited for this movie for maybe 8 years and I was not left disappointed. This is the historical drama I was waiting for and the depiction I never knew I wanted. This trilogy has proven and show that our heroes weren't perfect people. They've done bad things, got their hands dirty, and burned bridges but they were also instrumental in building our nation. Sometimes, these heroes are also reflective of our nation and who we can be. The Philippines has its share of problems but it's still a beautiful country and has the potential to be something great. We might be just as imperfect as the heroes in Jerrold Tarog's trilogy were but just like them, we still have the capability to bring the country somewhere great. I hope that one day, we bring this country away from where it is right now and beat the corruption that plagues it.Besides that important lesson and theme I got from the movie, I think the movie is an amazing piece of Philippine cinema from its acting to the cinematography to the editing. It's truly amazing. There were a few creative choices that I feel like could've been edited or shot better but I still think this movie is a masterpiece just like the other two in the trilogy.",2025-10-19,0,0,watch,True

Because all of a sudden it was theatrical, vaudeville, and full-on period. But when the plot thickens, it suddenly makes sense — On how the politics at the time (let’s face it, until today), is just one big show and performance at stake of actual lives.2. The timejumps was a bit confusing at first. When it jumped from film to life and back out again with no immediately understandable visual cues, it was snapping me out of the world. But again, when the plot thickens, you kinda get the point. This may be my personal issue, but it took me sometime to get to that point.And my most major thing with this:I BOTH LOVE AND HATE, I AM BOTH AMAZED AND DISAPPOINTED, ALL AT THE SAME TIME - On how this reflects to until today. This was basically the birth of a trapo. It says so in the film that this was the game of politics, showcased at large on how it was played, and how it evolved into the game of today. What I hate most is that the main messaging of political idolatry is still a rampant and relevant message that still needs to be relayed to today. And mind you, this was more or less than 80 years ago. How far we’ve gotten yet how slow our progress be.Also, I watched this one alone. And I kinda regret that, which is a RARE reaction I get from watching a film (because I love watching films alone). But this is a discussion me and my friends had before that we may dive deeper into after this film: “Was the Philippines premature to be independent before? Should we have taken more time to be colonized?”. No ill-intent in that question, it is purely a curious question. And one that was once again, sparked by this film.A thinktank, a conversation-igniter, which is how historical films should be.

Ang pinaka obvious ay ang Chess, kung saan ang naglalaban ay ang panig ni Quezon para sa puti, at si Osmeña naman ang sa itim. Isa sa mga paborito kong scene yung nasa isang malaking kwarto sila at tila naglalaro ng Chess para masukat kung sino ba ang mas ma-impluwensiya sa kanila. Sa huli, na checkmate si Osmeña.

Lahat gustong umakyat ng hagdan, lahat gustong manalo.Huli ang poker. Kanya-kanyang laro ng kani-kanilang mga baraha. Kung sino ang may mas maaalam na baho ng kalaban, siya ang panalo.

Quezon himself knew how to play the game. Lets talk about, Aguinaldo next, in this film he is tired and beaten down, he was out of his depth in challenging Quezon. Aguinaldo was characterized in which a part of you will feel sympathy for him, but makes you aware that everything that led to his downfall was through his actions.

denlebantino,8,"On the critique that Quezon (the film) is vague in its idea of independence:That's exactly part of MLQ's politics: the wielding of power is being the origin or source of a great idea, the new republic as a goal only Cassey can achieve. That is how political campaigns are inspired. That's how devotion to political figures has taken its root. Whatever concept of freedom there is should appear like it's going to come directly from the politician. Independence being perceived as food conveys the idea that it's constantly asked, not fought for, by the masses that wait for 'ayuda' rather than the affirmation of their capacity to hold freedom in their hands. And why is 'independence' or 'new republic' mentioned in the film like a byword? It's because Quezon wears it like a badge. But it serves a more important purpose: It floats as a concept that's never really understood. It remains to be a hollow idea associated with patriotism. So it continues to be talked about because it's never truly experienced. Valid pa rin ang tanong na ""What is a new republic?"" hanggang ngayon. So it's odd to expect the film to define independence for us when what it does is actually more essential.We define it. I trust that we know how to.",2025-10-21,1,0,rewatch,True
upcinema,,"Sabi ni Cinemaster Nadz Amata:Simply an amazing film to end Tarog’s Bayani Trilogy. Quezon harnessed the strengths of its predecessors Heneral Luna and Goyo, producing a film with strong storytelling, great actors, and awesome cinematography. Although he did not physically look like the mestizo Casey, Jericho Rosales delivered an enigmatic performance well-deserving of acting awards. But among its merits, perhaps my favorite thing about Quezon is its pointed delivery of political critique not only towards the current administration but to the long history of corrupted, patronizing, and self-serving Philippine politics.I know for sure that it is not only me who feared that Quezon would end up sanitizing the former president’s image, as films about politicians and heroes tended to do so. But alas, Quezon was not usual biopic that mythologized the man — instead, it demystified him, reintroducing the former President that plastered his and his wife’s name all over his home province and the biggest city in Metro Manila. It was able to effectively deliver Manuel Luis Quezon as the cunning politician, borderline dictator that he is.Alongside his intelligent spiels and populist rhetoric, the film revealed the unapologetic and manipulative character of the 2nd President of the Philippine Republic — the man who laid the formula of political maneuvering for the politicians and would-be presidents after him, proving Alfred McCoy’s view that Quezon’s Commonwealth paved the way for Philippine authoritarianism.I do hope that Tarog continues to develop new historical fiction films in the future. More than ever, we need more films that tackle and communicate our history in interesting ways that provoke the audience to revisit our past and reexamine our stances on our ‘great’ men.",2025-10-21,4,0,watch,False

thanatosfiel,10,"What a way to close out the Bayaniverse trilogy. From the ultraviolent chaos of Heneral Luna, to the somber introspection of Goyo, Quezon rounds things off as a psychological thriller-slash-political comedy-slash-drama that’s as ambitious as it is sharp.What I’ve always admired about Jerrold Tarog’s depiction of these historical figures is how human they are. There are no pure heroes here—only flawed men navigating ambition, ego, and nationhood. Quezon, played brilliantly by Jericho Rosales, is a political gamemaster: part statesman, part showman, and wholly cunning. I love that the film doesn’t dwell on textbook achievements, but rather on the intricate dance of manipulation, charm, and power that defined his leadership.Like the best Filipino historical films of recent memory, Quezon reflects its own era back at us—the politics of then echoing the politics of now, for better or worse.And while it’s billed as the end of the Bayaniverse, I hope this isn’t an exclamation point, but a comma—especially after that tantalizing post-credits tease.",2025-10-21,0,0,watch,True

The ping-pong exchange of politicking and smear campaigns is its most coruscating part—electrifying to me, actually—a protracted look at our current politics' saddening origin. Quezon—now that there is no need for battle pieces, as that is not Tarog's turf—is the most polished in the entire trilogy, only slightly tarnished by its caricature bits and overreliance on fictional characters.

cary_domiii,8,"It was so fascinating to see the things I've learned in history books be dramatized in film.What a time to be alive to witness a trilogy of films that tells a story of heroes, but also deconstruct them, showcase them as three-dimensional characters, as people and not as good guys up on pedestals.The change of tone from the seriousness and war setting of Heneral Luna and Goyo to the more modern setting of Quezon threw me off, but also had me engaged. Especially with the way they make a meta-commentary of the power of film and media to portray these stories. Jericho Rosales is wonderful to see on screen as MLQ, and Romnick Sarmienta as Sergio Osmeña showed a fun dynamic--almost like a romantic couple--between Quezon and Osmeña.The non-linear storytelling was also a change that I had to adjust after re-watching the first two in preparation for this. Thankfully, there are title cards and chapters that serve as good guide posts for the pacing of the story.Speaking of story, as this film spanned a longer timeframe compared to the two, it's written to showcase more vignette-type and montage-style of events rather than the more straightforward storytelling in Luna and Goyo. While it's not a bad thing, it can be difficult to keep track of while watching. Also, pacing is an issue as some parts dragged and other moments could've used more time to absorb its messaging.The showcase of Quezon's con artistry and showcasing him as a chameleon is done very well. This movie was really a battle of wits instead of arms--and it truly showcased the Filipino political culture.The production and set design were done incredibly well. A lot of effort was put to make this a period piece. While some seams and cracks can be seen here-and-there, those can be mostly ignored and do not hinder my enjoyment of the film. There isn't that much bloodshed and prosthetic wounds to be seen here, but more on CG buildings, vehicles, and recreation of period appropriate settings and props.---SPOILER THOUGHTS---I think they could've had a Mabini scene somewhere as having Aguinaldo, Joven, Rusca, and Janolino weren't enough connective tissue for me to fully connect this movie with the previous two.The Alerta storyline and Nadia filmmaking storyline could've been tighter as these were the parts that dragged the most. Though I do appreciate having this fictional plot point to give commentary on the importance of film, media, journalism, and media literacy--I do think this could be polished more and make less preachy. In the previous films, I didn't feel like I was being banged with the head with all of its messaging because of how beautiful the writing is and how its themes weave together with its characters. In here, that magic was kinda muddled a bit. But there were still some scenes and lines that made such a good impact on me.His abrupt death and shouting into the abyss, left me dissatisfied to be honest. Both Luna and Goyo's death were shown on-screen while here, it's just implied and presented to us through text. I would've loved to see him actually die in his sleep or something or maybe have Osmeña receive the news and take his place and then have the epilogue of the movie there.Lastly, all three films had some sort of subplot of the protagonist having some sort of affair. I think Aurora Quezon was underutilized here. Luna's affair with Isabel makes sense as the character was an amalgamation of various women in Luna's life. Goyo's love affairs with Felicidad and Dolores were the most poetic and beautifully done juxtaposed with the sacrifices of war. Quezon's love for Aurora and the affair with Ana Ricardo was so tense but not as strong as I would like it to be as both women were more plot device than actual characters.---END OF SPOILER THOUGHTS---Quezon is a great film and I am thankful to have watched it on the big screen. I think it is the weakest of the trilogy, but it still has its redeeming qualities. It can be frustrating in a negative sense with some of the complaints I have, but this film and the entire Bayani-verse trilogy of movies are frustrating in the positive sense--as ALL three were well-written to present themes, lessons, and events that are still relevant to this day. These films show history but as so well-crafted to mirror the political issues we have at present.I don't want this to be the last film. I do hope there are more stories to tell and themes to explore in our history.",2025-10-21,0,0,watch,True

123gir_hermione,9,"I really enjoyed this movie! Jericho Rosales doesn't really look like Quezon, I was really hesitant at his casting first especially as the original Quezon TJ Trinidad (and even the younger Quezon Benjamin Alves as well as Apolinario Mabini actor from previous Bayaniverse films Epy Quizon) looks more similar to the real Quezon, but Jericho did really make up for his acting. I love how the political tactics and intrigue are made with comedic timing, keeping audiences interested in the screen. I thought Mon Confiado was really perfect as Quezon and Iain Glen's special appearance as Governor General Leonard Wood was fantastic. I thought Karylle's Aurora Quezon doesn't have much to do in the movie, but I was really impressed with her acting especially when she realized Quezon's first ""wife"" was in the same event as her and Quezon.The movie seems to be based strongly on facts, but I couldn't find from my research information about this so called first ""wife"" of Quezon before Aurora. But I do think she was used very well in the plot of this movie. The fictional characters Joven Hernando and his daughter Nadia are well used in this movie as well. They are intended to represent the audiences (especially Filipino audiences as their Filipino history shown in this movie is still relevant today).

httphelena,9,"Quezon, in terms of storytelling, is different from the approach of Heneral Luna and Goyo. Not that the previous films were set during the war for independence and Quezon was more about words, but Tarog’s treatment here was somewhat different.What I appreciate about this new approach is its new perspective. In this film, we see Quezon through the lens of Nadia’s works, portrayed as both a hero and a shrewd politician — a duality reflected by the people around him like Joven, who seem like spectators to his life. The storytelling feels more playful yet sharp, much like the mind games shown in the film, which perfectly capture his wit and sly character. I also liked the use of the title card inspired by the silent era in the sequence that introduces Quezon — a clever way to bridge the past and the present.The scenes of love-hate tension between him and Osmeña, his attempts to outsmart Leonard Wood, and his feud with Aguinaldo make us, as viewers, feel like spectators in this grand game of politics. Despite the seriousness of the subject, the humor and comedic tone remain, giving the film a lighter touch — something I truly appreciate. It also highlights the absurdity of politics, showing how politicians can sometimes be clowns themselves. Quezon is definitely a film worth watching in cinemas. I also appreciate its cinematography and sound design, which add so much to the overall narrative.",2025-10-20,3,1,watch,True
lemnathanerena,9,"Quezon is less about defining a hero and more about what a hero isn't. With no guns and battles this time, Tarog's final film in the trilogy relied on a well-written screenplay and a brilliant direction and editing. This felt polished and grand.Jericho Rosales plays Quezon masterfully with his unmatched charisma and mischievous persona. Every department of this production brought their A-game (except the makeup which was at times distracting). The writing here is particularly good, in my opinion the best of the trilogy.Quite an experience going home from the cinema in a motorcycle, seeing his name in every corner of every street in this city named after him. His legacy indeed lived on. Scary to think that the unprincipled legacy of the people running this country today might live on too just like his.",2025-10-21,1,0,watch,True

migseu,8,"Quezon is not your typical biopic. It doesn’t simply glorify the titular figure, nor does it aim to reduce him to a villain. It’s a sharp, unsettling mirror. The cinematography is well-executed, every shot deliberate and meaningful. I loved how the film plays with style: the silent movie and noir sequences are such clever touches. There’s a bit of camp, even excess, but it works. Politics has always been a performance in the Philippines anyway, and this film leans right into that.It’s not afraid to show Quezon as both idealist and egotist, leader and manipulator. The movie calls out how he perfected the art of political spectacle, something we’re still drowning in today. At times, it gets too caught up in that same spectacle, focusing on power plays more than the people affected by them, but maybe that’s part of the point.What stings most is how familiar it all feels. The greed, the posturing, the foreign meddling: it’s the same game, just with new players. Quezon isn’t perfect, but it’s sharp, stylish, and painfully relevant. It doesn’t just revisit history; it forces us to realize we’ve never really left it.(P.S. Give Jericho Rosales his well-deserved FAMAS now!! that perforamance was spectacular!!)",2025-10-22,0,0,watch,False

franciscores,7,"Nakakatuwang isipin na kahit medyo natagalan bago nasundan at dumaan sa maraming hamon, ngayon ay mapapanood na rin natin ang “final installment” ng Bayaniverse. This time, nakatutok ang pelikula kay Manuel L. Quezon, upang ipakita sa mga Pilipino kung ano nga ba ang tunay na kahulugan ng pagiging bayani. So, was it worth the wait?One thing’s very clear: this movie is made with passion and love. Every aspect, production design, costume, music, sound design, acting, and screenplay, everything feels precise and deliberate. Walang sayang. Busog ang mata mo, at napakasarap sa pandinig ng bawat linya at tugtugin.I also appreciate that the film didn’t contradict anything from the previous installments. There’s no unnecessary retcon, and even smaller roles were reprised by the same actors (except for Joross Gamboa as Eduardo Rusca, previously played by Archie Alemania). Hindi ko nga agad napansin na siya pala iyon until I checked online, still, I appreciate his inclusion.What leaves me conflicted, however, is how the narrative perspective centers on Joven. He’s a good character, pero minsan nawawala ang connection natin kay Quezon. Unlike the first two films where we clearly see the world through the minds of Luna and Goyo, dito parang ikinukuwento lang sa atin ang nararamdaman ni Quezon. That sometimes creates a bit of emotional distance. I get that the film wants to show that our heroes are just as flawed and human as we are, and I love that message, but I wish we could’ve seen more of Quezon’s inner struggle.The non-linear structure works surprisingly well. Kahit medyo gimmicky, it adds flavor to the storytelling, especially since we already know where the story is headed.Jericho Rosales delivers a powerful and charismatic performance as Quezon. Mon Confiado also brings his A-game, while Cris Villanueva, Arron Villaflor, and Rominick Sarmenta shine in their respective roles. For Iain Glen, I honestly feel another actor could’ve played the part, but it’s still commendable that they brought in a respected Hollywood actor for the role.Overall, Quezon is a strong and passionate film. It may be overly ambitious at times, occasionally losing sight of its identity, but its heart is in the right place. The message remains powerful: kahit ilang taon na ang lumipas, tila hindi pa rin nagbabago ang mga Pilipino.And if ever this isn’t truly “the end,” I hope we still get to see more stories from the Bayaniverse, especially with that mid-credit scene tease.",2025-10-19,0,0,watch,False
invenire_,10,"It was a good film, though I'm still trying to understand why some consider it to be the weak link in the Bayaniverse trilogy. It's actually a wonderful movie. Confiado's delivery was excellent, it even brought me to tears because you could truly feel how he fought back against political corruption in the Philippines. I'm not just talking about the character, but this actually reflects our society today and how we struggle and fight against corrupt politicians. It's also great…",2025-10-19,0,0,watch,False

muybiennn,7,"Independence: Good enough to eat.127 years of Philippine independence, but are we truly free? Do our statesmen really know how to operate this country with 'freedom' in their hands? Do we even deserve this freedom? Will we ever learn?​This is what Quezon leaves you with. This movie is enjoyable and, as always, provoking.​It brings to mind that known quote from him: ""I'd rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by Americans."" Hearing that again, with what's happening to our country, made me laugh. I like how Tarog thinks, always aiming for relevance by connecting his historical movies to what's happening right now.​As someone who didn't know much about Quezon, I learned a lot and was reminded of the things he did. But it's also a movie about politics. We are introduced to their games, how they operated, and how they think. Today, it might seem obvious. But to think that this has been happening long before our independence has me worried. I was sitting in the cinema literally not knowing exactly how I feel, other than discomfort.​Technically, I appreciated the writing. Despite being dialogue-heavy, the lines are witty and written with a style similar to the Bayaniverse. I also like the aesthetic; it reminds me of Wes Anderson (very subtle) and the likes with its use of symmetry, colors, and scores.​Ultimately, we are shown the humane side of our celebrated heroes. While we appreciate what they've done for our country, we should not be blind to consider them human—not idols, not kings, not gods.​Maraming magagandang salita sa pelikula, pero siguro ang mainam na panapos ay:Maraming politiko, kakaunti ang lingkod-bayan.",2025-10-22,0,0,watch,True

Quezon is a political animal that knew no satisfaction but perhaps was a mere reflection of the period where America (his puppet masters) were too first learning the prizes of Empire. Rosales gives perhaps his defining performance in this stage of his career. Just verve and energy radiating off the screen! Like any of history’s narcissists, it was a downfall well portrayed and a rise to power that echoes DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort. (Where to mention the crispness of a Scorsese film’s editing is also possibly a clear inspiration for this film). Mon Confiado’s Aguinaldo was humanized well away from the El Presidente’s mythic stature. The birth of patronage politics and its attacks on journalism and truth was impeccably presented. Never to the point of celebrating it but dangles its dangers for people to discover and hopefully decry. 4/5",2025-10-23,1,0,watch,True

silentcinephile,9,"Director Jerrod Tarog delivers another masterpiece in the Bayaniverse with a showcase in filmmaking excellence in acting, cinematography, editing, production and costume design. I was initially thrown off by Jericho Rosales and Romnick Sarmienta's accents (never bothered to check if that's how Quezon and Osmena sounded in real life) but they're 2 of today's best actors that I eventually appreciated how they fully embodied their respective roles. Ditto Mon Confiado as Aguinaldo, Karylle as Doña Aurora, JC Santos as Roxas, and even Cris Villanueva as fictional character journalist Joven Hernando. It was also nice to see Iain Glen (Jorah Mormont in Game of Thrones) play Governor-General Wood. Quezon's bantering/arguments with both Osmena and Wood were quite amusing/entertaining. Also commend the shift in tone which was like a breath of fresh air in telling a Pinoy historical drama (sort of reminded me of Mike de Leon's 'Bayaning 3rd World' which also starred Villanueva). But if I were to nitpick, I'd note that if Luna and del Pilar were humanized in their respective biographical war dramas, Quezon was villainized here as the idealistic patriot fighting for Philippine independence turned scheming, power hungry politician.

th0ughtcriminal,10,"YOU CAN’T LOSE WITH QUEZONAfter three watches, I can safely say one thing: I have so many thoughts about the Quezon movie, and yet so little words to convey it in. I wrote so many passages down in my notebooks. All of them half-finished or just me arguing with myself trying to make sense of what I was feeling. I’ll try my best to write them here.The Bayaniverse, one of my favorite Filipino movie series, has finally come to a close with (arguably) one of their best movies yet. Quezon veers away from the usual historical biopic formula and moves into the territory of being a social commentary.Instead of the “event A happened, so event B follows” format, Quezon asks us to sit with discomfort. Rather than simply glorifying its subject, the movie presents a national hero who reflects the leaders we have now. A visionary who fought for Filipino independence, yet, a calculating statesman who mastered the performance of politics. Charming when needed, ruthless when required, and deeply aware of optics.I see the movie as something that doesn’t necessarily paint Quezon in a necessarily evil nor corrupt light, but as a pragmatic who knew that idealism alone could not dismantle a colonial-imperialism system built on inequality. That pragmatism, however, is exactly what built the foundations of our current political structure.What does that say about our national heroes? What does that say about the kinds of people we choose to enshrine and remember? Most importantly, what does that say about us?The Quezon we see in the movie is not simply Quezon–he’s also the collective psyche of the nation that produced him and the time that he lived in. He lived under an imperialist, racist U.S. government! As the movie perfectly states, “Quezon may not have made the game, but he sure did play it.”I think Quezon challenges the comfort that we have in hero worship. It dares us to look at power. Not as a moral test or a path to self-actualization, but as a mirror to who we are as a nation going through growing pains. Is it worth acknowledging that building a road to greatness often comes with destroying whatever comes ahead?The real message of the Bayaniverse, in my opinion, is that the nation was not built by perfect saints. It was also built by people who have the tendency to be selfish, flawed, ambitious, and painfully human. The series tells us that our understanding of heroism must mature as we continue to mature as a nation.On a more personal note, I will never forget the feeling of watching it on the big screen. What an amazing movie. The dialogue is witty, suspenseful, and human. Another thing I love about it is the casting. Everyone is so perfect! I knew that Jericho Rosales was a good actor, but he was PHENOMENAL as MLQ! I didn’t expect it at all.The music and cinematography are top-notch too. What a movie! I’d love to be part of something like this one day.I’ve been told that I have the tendency to go insane about the things I love. I’m not a movie person, but I’d love to go to the theater to watch it again, but that’d require me to open my commissions (and so, I’m opening my commissions to watch it again).",2025-10-24,0,0,rewatch,True

jayehanash,7,"painful irony of a nation striving for independence while simultaneously being undermined by internal disunity and dependence on external influence.the film offers a sharp critique of the deeply rooted filipino concept of utang na loob and exposes how it can distort the ideals of governance and public service. what once began as a moral virtue, a sign of respect and loyalty, becomes a political instrument that undermines integrity, opening the door to corruption, favoritism, and blind allegiance. it challenges viewers to reflect on how certain filipino values, while culturally meaningful, can be misused to sustain systems of power that work against true progress.at the same time, the film also confronts a difficult truth: it’s not easy to question or turn away from this cycle, especially when one is personally benefiting from those in power. comfort and convenience can blur one’s moral vision, making it hard to see the injustice hidden behind acts of generosity. it takes courage and self-awareness to break free from that dependence, to open one’s eyes and choose integrity over personal gain.",2025-10-24,0,0,watch,True
heartscript,9,"It depicts how, even long before, politicians have always been performative when it comes to their propaganda just to appear pleasing to the people. Human as we are, Filipinos as we are, we tend to be easily blinded by whatever “truth” is presented to us, especially when it aligns with our values and principles. What struck me most (in the worst way possible) and I was genuinely flabbergasted was the case with his first wife and how he defended himself in court, saying something along the lines of, “Does this face really need to rape someone?” It shows how contradicting his principles already were. You cannot fight for your country if you are struggling to be humane yourself. Quezon took Filipinos as nothing but mere tools for him to gain power. In reality, isa pa rin siyang tuta ng mga Amerikano by adhering to the same vicious practices as those American people.“Independence is just a word.” – QuezonWhat really is independence? Have we truly achieved it if we remain enslaved by poor governance and corruption? After all, he said it himself that he would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by Americans. Perhaps Hobbes was right, man is selfish in nature, and he will do anything through voluntary acts if the object serves some good to himself.Is it the lesser evil for the Philippines to barely progress under Filipino rule, rather than to thrive under an American one? This isn’t to claim that the latter would be preferable, rather, it’s to assert that we deserve a government that upholds both, a competent leadership and a genuinely Filipino sense of governance.",2025-10-24,0,0,watch,True

nourmean,9,"I entered the cinema expecting a crashcourse on history, yet I've been dished with a more nuanced understanding on our collective perception of history as a whole. The movie itself is the statement. Heneral Luna and Goyo have already fixed our expectation/s on how this will turn out: a valorous exhibit on the lives of ""national heroes"" that shaped Philippines as we know it; setting a preliminary idea that it will follow the same pattern about building Quezon as a major contributor of our independence. Yet, as it turns out, the movie stitches reflective points gauging on what these historical acts truly mean to us and the manner as to how these information precipitated through our minds. A magnified look into Quezon as an individual, almost overshadowing the historical context within them opens up a rare opportunity for critiqe against our national heroes. Oftentimes, we are trained to consume knowledge as quick as light, yet there is lesser existential emphasis that allow us to reject passivity in learning. I am too drowsy to add more (i will edit this soon tho), but I really enjoyed thinking about a lot of things such as the state of Philippine politics, statehood, and the lingering wonder as to what truly constitus a hero and power as recursive influence on the trajectory of history and how its viewed.",2025-10-24,0,0,watch,True

So when the character of Quezon, an ambitious man who benefitted from (and allegedly originated) the country’s rotten practices, shouted “I am the Philippines”, I was inclined to believe him.

paulenicola,6,"The film’s most intriguing throughline lies in Manuel Quezon’s (Jericho Rosales) exchanges with Joven Hernando (Arron Villaflor as the young journalist, Cris Villanueva as the older one). Joven, who once idolized Quezon, becomes his conscience and later his accuser, returning a coin once given to him as a symbol of principle. Their relationship encapsulates writer-director Jerrold Tarog’s grand question: can integrity survive intimacy with power? It’s through Joven’s eyes that we watch the statesman’s transformation into strongman, his lofty rhetoric curdling into patronage politics. When Quezon shuts down Joven’s newspaper for publishing an exposé, the betrayal stings not only as political allegory but as personal tragedy—the loss of faith in leadership itself.What I found most striking here (and which I strongly feel is the film’s strongest aspect) is how Tarog, through Joven’s eyes, frames Quezon as the unwitting architect of a system that still defines us. Joven suggests that while Quezon didn’t invent patronage politics, he definitely perfected its choreography: every favor disguised as friendship, every handshake turned into hierarchy. The film doesn’t condemn him outright for this; it simply watches how such pragmatism metastasizes into a national reflex that still nags at us today.In one exchange, Quezon insists that principle must bend to survival, a line that feels less like justification than prophecy. Tarog lets that sentiment resonate across the film like a curse. We see it in the way Quezon rewards loyalty with access, in the quiet humiliation of those who refuse to play along, and in the hollow triumph of independence negotiated rather than fought for. The movie’s politics are cyclical, almost fatalistic: power breeds corruption, corruption demands compromise, and compromise becomes governance. Tarog doesn’t spell this out; he lets it unfold in the pauses between alliances and betrayals, in the small intimate silences that follow Quezon’s public victories.Joven’s arc, meanwhile, becomes our moral compass—a journalist who believes truth can coexist with patronage, only to learn that one always consumes the other. His disillusionment is as national as it is personal. By the time he returns the coin Quezon once gave him, the gesture feels both intimate and historical, like a nation finally returning the debt of false ideals. Tarog’s “Bayaniverse” has always traced this erosion, but here it feels complete: Quezon may have built the country’s first Republic, but he also built the template for its recurring undoing.What the film ultimately suggests is that corruption in the Philippines isn’t an aberration—it’s an inheritance. Quezon’s genius wasn’t that he corrupted the system, but that he understood how to make corruption look like leadership. His brand of “opportunistic nationalism,” as historians have called it, didn’t die with him; it evolved, refined by each successor who learned the same survivalist grace. Tarog’s gaze isn’t accusatory, though. It’s almost elegiac, as if recognizing that Quezon’s contradictions—his brilliance, his vanity, his compromises—are also ours.",2025-10-24,1,0,watch,False

airowoo,8,"As the final chapter of Jerrold Tarog’s Bayaniverse trilogy, Quezon wraps things up in a way that’s both bold and refreshing. I went into this with zero expectations since it didn’t get much buzz, but honestly, it’s a must-watch even if you haven’t seen Heneral Luna or Goyo. It may not be as explosive or emotionally charged as Heneral Luna, nor as poetic as Goyo, but its quirky, satirical tone gives it a distinct identity that stands strong alongside the first two films.Seeing Quezon’s story unfold beyond the pages of history books is fascinating. Tarog leans into dark humor and sharp political satire, exposing the manipulative, chaotic world of power struggles — Quezon versus fellow politicians and the Americans. This isn’t your typical biopic; it’s a political farce where Jericho Rosales’ Quezon treats nationhood like a rigged game only he can win. He lies when needed, bends the truth to his advantage, and embodies both heroism and hypocrisy.What makes this film stand out is its honesty. It doesn’t glorify Quezon... it exposes his flaws, ambition, and contradictions. The inclusion of media’s role in shaping narratives adds another layer, reminding us that there are always two sides to every story. The line “heroism is just a perception” sums it up perfectly.Jericho Rosales is phenomenal here that you forget you’re watching him, he is Quezon. Mon Confiado as Aguinaldo, and the actors portraying Osmeña and Roxas, all deliver sharp, grounded performances that complement the film’s tone.The ending hits hard with its satirical bite, when Quezon declares, “I am the Philippines.” Tarog leaves it open to interpretation, but to me, it’s a powerful commentary on power, ego, and politics — on how even noble intentions can rot when corrupted by greed. A hero proclaiming that he is the country becomes the same figure consumed by its flaws. It’s ironic, timely, and uncomfortably reflective of the state of our nation today.Quezon isn’t just a political film — it’s a mirror held up to our nation, to our leaders, and to ourselves. It’s raw, funny, unsettling, and deeply Filipino. A brilliant, unflinching finale to Tarog’s Bayaniverse.",2025-10-23,0,0,watch,False

While Manuel Quezon remains as a polarizing figure in Philippine history what Quezon offers is trying to show both sides of the coin. That Manuel Quezon has his fair share of contribution to the independence of the country while also not turning a blind eye to his ill deeds. While the film is historically accurate and strong with its references to past events what drags it down is the fictional dramatization for story build-up purposes. My personal fave in this movie hihi that I loved how they told the narrative of the movie within a movie itself (this may make or break the viewing experience depends on the audience preference however in my case it worked!). What confused me, though, was how the film tried to paint Emilio Aguinaldo as a noble hero despite the long-standing accusations against him.

decadentrebel,9,"A bit better than Heneral Luna and ties together all the themes established from the first two movies. Siyempre andiyan pa rin yung mga ""audience surrogate"" scenes in which the characters engage in dialogue that's artificial instead of letting the audience figure it out for themselves. Case in point: yung kumakain sina Joven, Rusca, Carmen at Nadia while mansplaining that being educated doesn't mean you cannot be fooled. Also, I don't understand getting miffed by Quezon's portrayal in a negative light — deconstruction is the whole shtick of the ""Bayaniverse"". It's intended to serve as counterpoints to the textbooks that mythologize historical figures. Hindi naman siya malicious. They're humans after all and politics is intrinsically dirty and ugly.

ethanluvsfilm,9,"Easily one of my most favorite films of all time, not because of my personal bias towards the Bayaniverse films nor because of my views and opinions on MLQ, but because of how much impact this could make in shaping conversations about our ""heroes.""Historical figures are all subject to the judgment of history. We cannot confine MLQ into being an exclusively great statesman, nor into a cunning chameleon of a politician. We've got to see the good, the bad, and the ugly.After all, his decisions are a product of the conditions of the Philippines during his time. Love him or hate him, MLQ made his mark in our history. Marks that should be studied and learned from, lest we repeat the mistakes of the past.Anyway, what really stood up to me in this film is the wide use of juxtaposition and contrast in its storytelling, in the conversations between Quezon and Osmeña, Quezon and Aguinaldo, Aguinaldo and Wood, Wood and Quezon, so on.This film made me want to re-read Nick Joaquin's 'A Question Of Heroes'. And of course, learn more about the man himself, Manuel Luis Quezon. Ironic lang na nauna ko pa ito mapanood before 'Quezon's Game'.Though it must be said. The ""government run by hell by Filipinos"" is pretty much Quezon's legacy, a legacy of ambition-driven politics fueled by patronage. The film kinda highlighted it splendidly.Pretty much a great film to watch. Informative? Yes. Devil's Advocate? Absolutely!",2025-10-25,0,0,watch,True

migueltheangelo,7,"I finally watched Quezon with my family after we got the time to see it in the cinema. It is the final and third film released after Goyo which was shown seven years ago. This film took several years into production which made me think if ever this will be finished since it would take a lot of money to make it and possibly got delayed because of the pandemic as well.When the cast and more details were announced, I am glad that it still pushed through despite some delays in production. However, what raised some eyebrows is the announcement of Jericho Rosales as Manuel L. Quezon since there was another actor that was supposed to portray an older version of him. I was surprised because Quezon is a mestizo while Rosales is a moreno actor. While I think this must be a miscast, I was intrigued whether he can pull this off since he is also a good actor too and has played lead roles in the past. Watched the movie, I was impressed by Rosales's portrayal of Quezon as an ambitious yet charismatic senator who wants to liberate the Philippines from the Americans. I had my doubts at first that Jerrold Tarog would make Quezon a good person yet what he did in this film he made him a morally grey character. It based Quezon on several historical documents and articles. While it didn't cover much about everything, it is clear that Quezon is what we call in a politics a "" trapo"" where he uses people to his advantage and perception in winning the elections and attaining power. Watching the film made me realize that everything is still relevant to what is happening today. Same people but different faces. The movie depicts how politics is game for the politicians where the masses are still considered pawns and the rich and elite still dictate everything and control the society. In this film, I didn't root for either Quezon or Aguinaldo. There is neither black and white nor good and bad. Overall, the film is great and entertaining to watch. The veteran and rising cast is great. I also think that Quezon and Osmeña here have chemistry as rivals turned to running mates. It's also an eye-opener to everyone especially when some of the issues in this film are still relevant to our country. Joven and his family represent our struggle in facing the reality of our country. Corruption is a systemic problem in our country and the film makes us think whether we are truly free. Even if we are independent, imperialism still exists in our country especially with how first world countries interfere with our affairs and also control our economy in other ways. The political system is still same but worse and I can still see Quezon in some politicians in the news. With Quezon showing in cinemas, I hope that more people will learn to discern and choose leaders carefully and see them in a lens where they don't vote them just because they're popular or owe them everything. Quezon is not perfect in terms of production and pacing, but it's a fun watch and has served its purpose for the general public. I'm optimistic that if more people will watch this type of films we might get more genres like them in the future.PS: Stay for the mid-credit scenes.",2025-10-25,0,0,watch,False

badtasteyanyan,7,"jericho delivered a layered performance so i’ll deliver a layered reviewat first, I thought the choice to tell the story from That POV was just a gimmicky choice, like form over substance, but as the film continued it felt like a very relevant meta commentary (idk for sure if that’s the intention). (For added context for the succeeding parts of this review, Quezon’s grandson crashed out during a press tour as he claims there are gross inaccuracies in the film.)The way this film dealt about propaganda stuck with me. Choosing to tell the story in that POV further drives the point for me. Quezon’s grandson crashed out because of inaccuracies, but this film isn’t supposed to be seen as an historical account (as well as the previous films in this trilogy for that matter). Telling the story from the perspective of the film reels for me feels like the director’s way of telling us that these films shouldn’t be read as historical accounts because they are just not. In fact it could even be interpreted as propaganda by some. But that is what the film means to me at least. When TJ Trinidad was recast, I was hesitant, mainly because TJ looked like a modern Manuel Quezon. But after seeing Jericho’s performance as the titular character, no one could’ve done a better job. The voice, the mannerisms, the small details, it’s so layered and I could watch it for hours on end. Everyone else in the cast did a fantastic job as well. (Fuck the CongTV cameo tho)I was shocked by how much they grounded Manuel Quezon back to reality and deconstructed the person. Quezon is one of my favorite presidents, but this made me look at him at a less fanatic perspective. Quezon was one smart mf, but that was also his flaw. He may be the our country’s best example of what a Machiavellian is. He played the cards he was dealt with yes, but he did so knowing the game was rigged while still benefiting from it, and even contributing to the rot. The way imperialism and independence is dealt with here has me conflicted, I still have no cohesive thoughts about how they discussed it, maybe on a rewatch. Politics is a game to those in power even if it shouldn’t be because our lives depend on it.
