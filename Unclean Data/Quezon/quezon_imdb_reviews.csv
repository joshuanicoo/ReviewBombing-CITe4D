cjmff,"Oct 16, 2025",Both cinematic and educational,"As a college student, this gave me wider perspective not only about Quezon and the other main historical characters of the film, but about election campaigns and politics and the games politicians play. In history, it is a hidden pearl to find a Filipino that is truly clean, without having to compromise or worse manipulate to achieve their goals. That is why we have to thorough and unbiased research and immersion between all candidates or parties whenever we vote.

MINOR SPOILERS: Through my favorite device that is film within a film, Quezon exposes the grey areas of politics, and that the historical theme of whether Filipinos truly understands what Independence entails is eye-opening (more so in the tie back ending sequence)

I also love the parallelism between the themes of the obsession of power (Osmeña but more Quezon) and hero complex (Aguinaldo and Wood) somehow disguised as public service. Don't get me wrong, in watching this film, I believe all these men had good intentions during their tenure, but in the end they all had their past and present mistakes that the film highlights for us to be skeptical about those intentions.

The film has the staple Bayaniverse cinematography and soundtrack!

My only nitpick with the film is (1) the ending kinda villianized Quezon just for dramatization and that (2) in the feminist perspective, there wasnt ample stress or building of the relationship between Quezon, Osmeña, Aguinaldo, Roxas and the women behind them, unlike in Heneral Luna and Goyo.

NashA-80,"Oct 15, 2025",Higher Use of Creative License,"Unlike previous installments that were close to real-life events, this movie contained a lot of purely fictional scenes and plot. It is more of a creative social commentary regarding the Filipino political system than a loosely-based historical recollection.

Overall, it is very good and creative in conveying the moral of the story but one must be careful in accepting any of the events as fact.",8
SanchoD-7,"Oct 19, 2025",Enticing and fiery,"By far this is one of the movies in our film making history that actually broke the ""Filipino"" style of film making, not that it is bad but it can be too predictive especially with the characters. It gave the protagonist a complex personality and background that almost we people relate to. Manuel Quezon in the movie is by far what I declare as THE best Filipino character made in this country's industry. Not to mention the performance made by the cast not just Jericho Rosales but all of them.

For the movie's feel everything and I mean everything is greatly beyond my expectation, it felt like it was true to life and it romanticized the vibe of that era. The music matched the personality of Quezon which was a spectacular. And the cinematography was handled by an artist of its craft.

Although in the last part (spoilers) as said in one of the reviewer's statement in the review section, they kind of made Quezon a villain in the end, to which I have no problem with as it is a creative liberty of the writer and director to do. Overall this film is breaking barriers and blockades. This might be my favorite movie this year.",9
timothydavidtv,"Oct 31, 2025","October 31, 2025 - 1 of 2 general impression","Filipino 🇵🇭 films rarely get played here in the US. So as soon as I saw this showing at the AMC app yesterday, I had to watch.

*** Note: I was not a good student during my school days - Elementary, Middle, High School years.

I graduated with a 1.2 GPA (Grade Point Average) So needless to say, I never had the capacity to retain any information - Science, Math, and History.

Both Philippine and US History.

This morning, the only perspective I had on Manuel Quezon was, he had a city named after him.

Where I was born and raised, Quezon City.

My mother worked closely with the former Mayor of Quezon City - Brigido ""Jun"" Simon, Jr. From 1986 to 1992. Her desk was right outside his office.

During those years, on Manuel Quezon's birthday, we would visit his tomb at the Quezon Memorial.

My general knowledge was that he obviously is a National hero.

Until after I saw this film.... Here's a line from the movie, towards the end, a line that was said to Manuel Quezon during his later years, ""You are not a King"" .... I'm pretty sure you all get the hint and tone of the movie.

I promise to myself, I will do diligent research to get both sides of his story. And come to a better understanding. Which will come most likely by next year. After the 2026 Academy Awards here in the US.

The overall Cinematography and Motion Picture soundtrack - is a 10.

Looking forward to watching this film again and downloading it for my personal collection of movies.

Currently as of 10/31/2025 count: Films watched (in-person Screener & viewed-on Mobile/at Home combined) - 66 TV series (in-person Screeners) 13.",10
EMMANUELG-626,"Oct 16, 2025",Quezon Made Me Politically Numb,"If there's one political drama set in the Philippines that actually feels real, this is it. Watch this film - it's got all the juicy elements of a Filipino political story: power, ego, corruption, and all that messy human stuff. But what's nice is it doesn't feel like a rip-off of some foreign political drama. It's so grounded, so Filipino, that you can almost smell the cigar smoke and hypocrisy. I'm talking about Quezon, the last part of Gerald Tarog's trilogy.

And man, classic Gerald Tarog move - he never gives you that simple ""good vs evil"" setup. Everything's in the gray area. You can't really tell who's the villain and who's supposed to be the ""hero."" Sure, the title says Quezon, but don't expect to be rooting for him. This version of Quezon? He's a piece of work - cunning, manipulative, and so Machiavellian it hurts. You kinda admire his brilliance, but at the same time, you can't stand how self-serving he is.

What's great is that the film doesn't try to moralize. It doesn't pretend to be righteous or ""for the people."" It just shows politics as it really is - dirty, ambitious, full of people pretending to be heroes while chasing power. It's not preachy at all, and that's what makes it hit harder.

The vibe? Think The Wolf of Wall Street, but make it political and Filipino. Everyone's selfish, everyone's got an agenda, and no one's clean. You can't fully hate them, but you sure can't love them either - and that's exactly why it feels so real.

If you've seen the first two films, you'll appreciate this one more. There are plenty of callbacks that make it feel like a proper closure. What's surprising is how Quezon ends up softening Aguinaldo's image. This time, he's shown as this calm, conservative old man - almost like a fallen sage. After being painted as the villain before, he finally feels human. It's like Tarog's saying, ""He wasn't a monster, just a flawed man in a broken system.""

Jericho Rosales gives a bold performance. At first, his Quezon feels a bit exaggerated - the accent, the gestures, the swagger - but the longer you watch, the more it makes sense. We don't have much real footage of the man, so Jericho's take feels like a believable reconstruction. Tarog clearly wanted this Quezon to feel both authentic and uncomfortable - the kind of leader you recognize in today's politics.

The script works. The occasional strong language fits perfectly - that's how real politicians talk behind closed doors. The dialogue sounds lived-in, the tension feels raw.

Visually, the film looks good, but you can tell there were budget limits. Some big events, like rallies, felt small in scale - more like social gatherings in hotel lobbies than massive political spectacles. Still, the indoor scenes look great and atmospheric. The American characters are forgettable except for Leonard Wood, but maybe that's intentional since they're not the focus anyway.

The pacing near the end feels rushed - especially the Corregidor and Malinta Tunnel scenes. The story wraps up fine, but the scale drops suddenly, like the production ran out of steam. You expect something grander, given the World War II backdrop. But even with those limits, Tarog still lands the emotional punch.

My only gripe is how the film implies that all our political rot - corruption, nepotism, oligarch control - started with Quezon. Symbolically, it's clever, but it's also unfair. It's not just one man's fault. This isn't about Quezon alone; it's about a system that's been rotten for generations.

What Quezon nails, though, is how it mirrors our current politics. The bribery, the PR manipulation, the media playing both sides - it's all there. Watching it feels like watching the evening news. Different names, same game. Tarog even captures the hypocrisy of the press: ""attack and collect, defend and collect."" That line alone could describe our political media today.

So yeah, Quezon isn't just about Quezon. It's a mirror - of power, greed, and us.

And after watching it, I didn't feel angry or inspired - just numb. The first film, Heneral Luna, fired you up. Goyo made you question heroism. But Quezon? It leaves you hollow, politically agnostic, almost hopeless. Maybe that's the point - that in our politics, no one's really clean, and the cycle never ends.

If that's what Tarog wanted to show, he absolutely nailed it.",9
akoaytao1234,"Nov 19, 2025",A Lack of Critical and Actual Criticism for the Shady Quezon,"I think the film has true promise. Quezon has always been quite a controversial figure of the early fight for true Philippine independence. He did as much good and as much bad if you really think deeply about it BUT the film is just presented in such a dense way.

In posits there is true good in Politics.

Even sections of actual criticism in the film is really hampered by Tarrog's insistence of the right 'governance'. The lack of a real alternative or an actual in depth conversations that does not really fall into this guise of moral grandstanding is prevalent that it was so eyeroll inducing.

You can read philosophies and still be the worst person ever - a college with Liberal Arts make you learn that quickly. If Quezon did not win, what does Aguinaldo can offer in the table that he himself had not done too?

Rather film, just villainizes Quezon's insistence to lead. One good example of the film's insistence for moralistic bent but lack of actual 'analysis' is the film's villainization of Quezon's use of his connection.

That is what connections are for. To create this dynamic give and take but it oh no, that is bad - because he can make so much campaign materials. It never really delivered on the fact on what would become the Nacionalista Party lead to one of the biggest ultra-majority in the Philippine's History, a familiar sight if anyone has lived to tell in the Duterte era Congress.

In fact, the film kinda glosses the fact that this same majority lead the changes in the constitution that inadvertently resulted to the Marcos Dictatorship. In fact, I do think the reason there are many rich families interested in Government is because how they were able to really to enter political spaces during this time.

Like for a film that prides itself as critical, it always uses these weak arguments to posit the rather double face attitude of Quezon. I was grasping straws, because it uses the worst criticisms (ad hominems) rather than just actually pulling real punches that is still present in the current Philippine political space.

It just bats this idea that Quezon wants the presidency is bad (it is not), because he wants it no matter what. His machination is bad since he is not truthful about his intention.

It literally facts that Quezon is a problematic and prolific muckraker, that most of what we hate about Aguinaldo is actually rooted towards his campaign against him. It is attested but a lot of actual paper trails sadly has been destroyed by the war of 45.

The film posits that is bad. (not necessarily) but the problem here is that the film also plays out the same muckraking as noble against some of his 'enemies' since they were not able to use it openly (hypocritical).

Like come-on now film. That is just plain stupidity at this point. You cannot just make this two sides of the coin when it's practically the same side. Even just picking cabinet members from his ultra-majority is played as if its bad since he is in the end trying to seek the 'faithfuls' of his herd - like that is weak criticism of Quezon's.

I also hate how the film hates Quezon for his aggressive approach to independence but loves the American simply because the Americans found that the filipino plebe does not know the word about the word for Independence.

Stupidity, THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT THE LEADERS to begin with. Another instance of the film going for the soft analysis over real question of readiness with the leadership.

And also, it really gives so much pass for the Americans and how they handled the Philippines, because they are well-meaning apparently. Suddenly, the atrocities is just a side comment here and there. Even Aguinaldo, who could have been more complex as a character himself is just plainly glorified.

I just feel there is so much more here that could have been made to make this actually critical in a sense that in actually is talking about things that would still be prevalent in our life and all.

On a lighter mode, Good performances though. Echo is effective as Quezon. I personally think certain actors looked closer to the very Hispanized Quezon but he has character for it. He performed really well and the cavalcade of supporting role was a welcome surprise. I personally think the film did well visually and editing wise, which is a lot for a local film, though the costuming though is really bad - a lot of badly fitted suits.

I will still recommend this BUT it lacks a deep reading about Quezon's role in PHI history tbh. It is important to look at this with a more critical eyes since this does tackle a lot of true issues about Quezon but in a way that feels misguided tbh.",3
FLICKSWITHMIGS,"Oct 24, 2025","Quezon (2025): ""The story & life of Quezon""","Quezon feels like a well-crafted film that Jerrold Tarog put a lot of effort into, both in writing and directing. Rosales's performance as the lead really stands out and carries the movie. Visually, it's a treat with a unique old-school style and great production design that captures the early 1900s vibe perfectly.

The story also creates a good amount of intrigue, even if some parts aren't perfectly executed. Despite its flaws, it's an interesting watch because of its strong visuals and engaging narrative. Overall, Quezon is a solid film that shows real craftsmanship and is worth a watch.

JohnB-8497,"Nov 1, 2025","Good message, Bad Film","After watching Quezon. It truly feels like a hit piece for the old president. Arrogant, Megalomaniac, I am the Philippines.

The movie constantly states that you must look at things from different perspectives, yet shows that he does not have any redeeming quality. Other than i guess he looks good.

Satirical claims are understandable as this film is shot like a satire. Quezon v Osmeña, Quezon v Wood. But idk why its not like that with chapter 3, Quezon v Aguinaldo.

You can say that Quezon is already well regarded by many and a good film came out a few years back (Quezon's Game), but that is just careless in this day and age. As movies like this are perceived as truth by those who are not busily reading in-depth filipino history books, by students and others in the Philippines

But to give credit where credit is due. Most criticism in the film of quezon are real: the r**e case, the being two faced, being an arrogant/megalomaniac, back handing Osmeña.

One criticism i have is the I am the Philippines scene. I know this film uses fictional elements but pumping up the drama at the end while the truth (more of a rumor) is that he said this in a New York hospital.. while looking at refection of him self.

Its hard to like this film if you one of those that dont like grand standing and moral messaging being pushed in the forefront. Cause it happens a lot. With joven's uncle and wife.

Other than that, its filmed well, dialogues are written well, and great casting.",5
