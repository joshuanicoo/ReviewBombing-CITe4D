Nice movie.,"It follows a young gymnast who discovers she is pregnant on the week of the national team tryouts. On her way to a seller of illegal abortion drugs, she meets a mysterious girl who eerily talks and thinks like her.

Dude the cinematography and camera angles in this trailer is what I have been wishing Philippine Cinema would have already been by now. Not the disappointing films they keep hyping and giving fake accolade.

Finally, a realistic story, not about kabit, poor/rich love story, badings. This is a realistic struggle of teen pregnancy in the Phil.

Sobrang deserve ni Maris makakuha ng maraming awards sa acting! Ang ganda! Ang galing!",10
This is the sunshine the country needs in today's climate.,"This is the sunshine the country needs in today's climate.

It was Jadaone's courage that popped in my head when the title card flashed, a very Filipina name that connotes brightness and warmth - two things the film was not intended for, two things the titular character deprived of.

Sunshine is a story of every Sunshine, a Filipino woman vulnerable to systemic injustice and oppression; a story no one could have been told better than a Filipino woman herself - and a fearless and intelligent one at that. From reproductive health and general health care system to conservatism, Jadaone's care and spirit championed. Her personification of one's conscience was beautifully done. I sobbed through the last 15 minutes.

True-to-life darkness in the country executed from the literal streets to the contexts of quality of life through Orendain's realism. There's a harrowing frame in the movie that ticked all my boxes as a fan of dark cinematography. I bled in the dark with Sunshine right there.

This film boasts a talented bundle of actresses: Meryll Soriano, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, Jennica Garcia, with Maris Racal tying the ribbon, flexing her acting muscles across different tones and needs. Well-written and well-directed performances with standouts coming from Garcia, Co, and Racal. Ah, women.

Malalim. Matapang. Mahalaga. Hindi ako babae pero gets na gets kita, Sunshine.",9
Still processing. This film stays with you.,"Maris Racal delivers an incredibly raw and grounded performance. You feel her tension, her fear, her hope and the heartbreak that comes from making an impossible decision. She doesn't ask you to agree with her character. She just asks you to understand. And that's powerful.

Direk Tonet Jadaone has once again proven her gift for telling stories that cut deep. This film doesn't shout, but it lingers. It haunts you in the quiet moments. It reflects a reality many would rather not see one where shame is louder than support, and judgment comes faster than help.",10

A Powerful 10/10 Film That Tells the Truth,"This 2024 Filipino film follows a teenage gymnast, Sunshine, whose Olympic dreams are suddenly derailed when she finds out she's pregnant. What unfolds is a raw, deeply emotional journey through shame, societal pressure, and the painful reality of having no legal access to abortion-something many women across Asia still face today.

The film doesn't sugarcoat anything. It shows exactly what's wrong with restrictive abortion laws in many Asian countries-how they silence girls, punish ambition, and force life-changing decisions on those who are still children themselves.

The movie itself is honest, hard-hitting, and emotionally devastating in the best way.

Maris Racal's performance was absolutely stunning. She carries the entire film with a performance that is real, raw, and unforgettable.

Sunshine should be shown in classrooms, government offices, and households. It's that important. It sparks urgent conversations about women's rights, bodily autonomy, and the price of silence.

Sunshine is one of the most courageous and necessary films to come out of Southeast Asia in recent years. It holds up a mirror to society and forces viewers to face uncomfortable truths. Anyone who thinks film can't change minds hasn't seen this one yet.

This is not just a good movie-this is essential cinema.

10/10. A masterpiece.",10
Sunshine - A Raw and Eye-Opening Film,"Sunshine is truly an eye-opener. It bravely tackles real issues that so many young adults-and even kids who are just stepping into their teenage years-are silently going through. The film dives deep into the realities of early pregnancy, abortion, and the emotional and social weight that comes with them.

What I really hope is that parents take the time to watch this film. Not just to be aware, but to feel that urgency-the need to guide and talk to their children about these sensitive but important topics. It's a conversation that can't be delayed anymore.

What stood out to me the most was how real and raw everything felt. I didn't leave the cinema feeling happy, but I did feel relieved. I felt the pain, the heartache, and the struggle that Sunshine went through-but I also saw the strength in her journey. The story is complete. It gives you everything from beginning to end, no shortcuts, no sugar-coating.

I loved the film. I honestly want to watch it again-not just for the story, but for the emotions it stirred up and the awareness it brings. This film matters.",10

A Missed Opportunity to Stick the Landing,"I had been waiting a long time to watch Sunshine, especially since I never got the chance to see it on the big screen. So, when it finally arrived on Netflix, I was so excited, only for that excitement to fade the longer I watched.

The premise is undeniably compelling: a young gymnast discovers she's pregnant just as her lifelong dream of reaching the Olympics is within reach. It's a setup filled with emotional stakes and potential for a powerful, character-driven story.

But instead of exploring her dedication to the sport, the film shifts almost entirely to her pregnancy and her attempts to deal with it. I kept waiting for scenes that would show her fighting for her dream, intense training, the pressure of competition, the physical and emotional toll of gymnastics, but those moments never really come. The narrative focuses more on side characters and subplots that feel unnecessary and, frankly, uninteresting.

I couldn't help comparing this film to other international athlete biopics that portray the grit, passion, and relentless work behind the journey. Sunshine had all the ingredients to deliver that kind of inspiring story, but it simply doesn't stick the landing.

Overall, I'm disappointed. With a stronger focus on the athletic journey and the challenges of balancing an unexpected pregnancy with Olympic ambitions, this could have been a much more compelling and memorable film.",4
"Perfect, Very Relevant","Will keep this short, but I can't due to the minimum characters. It perfectly captures and delivers the message it intends to relay. Just beautiful! Loved it!

Very, very relevant. Moves you even if you yourself cannot directly relate, and that is where the magic proves itself!

Great acting as well by almost everyone in the cast!",10
One of the most important Filipino films,"""Sunshine"" is not just the greatest Filipino movie I've seen but one of the most important Filipino films of all-time! This film deals with controversial topics in our society, abortion and teen pregnancy.

A week of national tryout for the gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal) finds out that she's pregnant. Conflicts arise as she has to decide what to do next. In between life and dreams, what's the most significant between the two?

The film is unconventional at best. This is not your usual and average Filipino drama you'll see. It's a character study about a teenager who is on the down side of her life. We follow her journey through this life and see a glimpse of her life dealing with her problem.

Maris Racal defines this film as Sunshine. Her acting here is brilliant. She's perfect for this role. Jennica Garcia surprised me. Her character as Sunshine's sister marks! What she said to Sunshine near the ending, though it's common, is like a punch to tears! I ended up loving her character. Jennica Garcia deserves an award for being the best supporting actress for this role. Another cast that standout is Rhed Bustamante and Xyriel Manabat both deserve a recognition for their role.

Blurring between reality and fantasy, mostly this film is realistic in portraying the whole theme thanks to Direk Antoinette Jadaone directions. Also, the cinematography is the best!

Overall, ""Sunshine"" is a women's movie. It's timely, affecting and brave to its theme. It doesn't spoon feed. It will make you immersed and think. It's worth an experience. This is a rare Filipino movie I've seen! I'm glad and proud watching this in cinema. After watching ""Sunshine"", it leaves me with a question, ""Is abortion a choice if your greatest dream will compromise?""",10

Sunshine is the collective experience of many Filipina,"We watched Sunshine yesterday, July 24, during the block screening at SM Megamall. I had seen the trailer beforehand, so I knew we were in for something bold, something necessary. But I wasn't prepared for how deeply it would sit with me long after the credits rolled.

I didn't cry while watching the film, but once it ended, I found myself overwhelmed. The weight of Sunshine doesn't hit all at once - it lingers, it settles. And it stays.

At its core, Sunshine is the story of a woman taking control of her body in a society that keeps telling her she isn't allowed to. It's not simply about one choice, one moment, or one woman. It's about the collective experience of many Filipinas who navigate a system that consistently fails to hear them.

Antoinette Jadaone's direction doesn't shy away from discomfort. She faces it head-on, inviting the audience to confront the silences we've learned to live with - about abortion, reproductive rights, the stigma around sexuality, and the lack of access to informed sex education in the Philippines.

Sunshine is timely, urgent, and painfully real. It gives voice to the cry of our generation, echoing the need for progressive reforms that protect women and children. The film challenges its viewers not just to empathize, but to act.

As a viewer, I left the cinema not only moved, but also awakened. Sunshine isn't here to entertain. It's here to disturb, to provoke, and to push us into uncomfortable yet necessary conversations.

To my fellow Filipinos: let's not turn away. Let's create spaces where women can speak freely, where choices about their bodies are met with compassion, not judgment. Let's demand that our lawmakers stop treating reproductive health as taboo.

To filmmakers and storytellers: keep telling these stories. We need more films like Sunshine-bold, unapologetic, and grounded in truth. The personal is political, and cinema has the power to move both heart and policy.

Let Sunshine be a beginning. Let it be a spark. And let's keep the conversation going.",9
Sunshine,"The performances are outstanding, with the lead actress delivering a raw and emotional portrayal of Sunshine's struggles. The supporting cast adds depth to the story, particularly the little girl, who brings a sense of wonder and curiosity to the film.

One of the most striking aspects of ""Sunshine"" is its refusal to provide easy answers. The film presents a realistic portrayal of the complexities surrounding reproductive choices, leaving viewers to ponder the moral implications.",10
