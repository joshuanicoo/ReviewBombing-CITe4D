Blue-Grotto,"Oct 19, 2024","""I wanted to be brave for these girls""","Sunshine is on the verge of joining the national gymnastics team and going to the Olympics, when she loses focus, careens off balance, and falters. Dreams nearly in her grasp shift to distant phantoms as she realizes she is pregnant. Shaken, fearful, desperate, and determined not to lose her rightful place on the national team, Sunshine searches the underground of the city for abortifacients. Abortion and even divorce are illegal in the Philippines, so Sunshine has few options and few people she can trust. Just then a mysterious young girl appears in the darkness and crowded streets with knowledge of Sunshine's heart that surprises her and touches her deeply.

""I wanted to be brave for these girls,"" said Maris Racal (Sunshine) ""who have no one else to turn to."" Racal is intrinsically believable in her role. In the conservative religious culture of the Philippines and with the lack of access to reproductive support, many girls are in crisis. The issue is relatable and timely not just in the Philippines, but in many other countries including, unfortunately, our own.

At this world premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, director Antoinette Jadaone said she got the idea for an imaginary friend from the film Jojo Rabbit. As part of her film research Jadaone interviewed girls who had abortions. She hopes the film sparks conversations and change, that it is part of the solution for the country, and helps girls in such situations make their own decisions.",8
boiipaul,"Jul 28, 2025","An honest, genuine and raw moving story!","I've seen this movie at the cinema alone last night and truly I can say that this is absolutely a genuine heartfelt cinematic experience movie. The story is really an eye opening for everyone especially for the young teenage women out there. It was really sad and heartbreaking story for a young athlete who had a dream to do good in gymnastics in the olympics but struggled in the process because of getting pregnant and doing an abortion in order to do so. One of the best part in the movie wherein I cried and felt bad for the main lead actress was her motel scene, where there is quietness of being alone but all you can hear is the noise of the train running in the background. This scene was very raw and sad to watch especially the time when she struggled so hard to abort her baby just to make sure that she can continue with her dream in the gymnastics. Overall this movie, definitely can be a great contender at the Oscars International Film Feature especially by how cinematic, and compelling the story was. I love how the movie tackled a controversial topic that everyone needs to hear and be open about. Maris Racal and her eyes in this movie is seriously a gem, such an amazing and effective best actress of this generation.",9
kasserlannister,"Jul 27, 2025",This is the sunshine the country needs in today's climate.,"This is the sunshine the country needs in today's climate.

It was Jadaone's courage that popped in my head when the title card flashed, a very Filipina name that connotes brightness and warmth - two things the film was not intended for, two things the titular character deprived of.

Sunshine is a story of every Sunshine, a Filipino woman vulnerable to systemic injustice and oppression; a story no one could have been told better than a Filipino woman herself - and a fearless and intelligent one at that. From reproductive health and general health care system to conservatism, Jadaone's care and spirit championed. Her personification of one's conscience was beautifully done. I sobbed through the last 15 minutes.

True-to-life darkness in the country executed from the literal streets to the contexts of quality of life through Orendain's realism. There's a harrowing frame in the movie that ticked all my boxes as a fan of dark cinematography. I bled in the dark with Sunshine right there.

This film boasts a talented bundle of actresses: Meryll Soriano, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, Jennica Garcia, with Maris Racal tying the ribbon, flexing her acting muscles across different tones and needs. Well-written and well-directed performances with standouts coming from Garcia, Co, and Racal. Ah, women.

Malalim. Matapang. Mahalaga. Hindi ako babae pero gets na gets kita, Sunshine.",9
crystaljanelejano,"Sep 28, 2024",Nice movie.,"It follows a young gymnast who discovers she is pregnant on the week of the national team tryouts. On her way to a seller of illegal abortion drugs, she meets a mysterious girl who eerily talks and thinks like her.

Dude the cinematography and camera angles in this trailer is what I have been wishing Philippine Cinema would have already been by now. Not the disappointing films they keep hyping and giving fake accolade.

Finally, a realistic story, not about kabit, poor/rich love story, badings. This is a realistic struggle of teen pregnancy in the Phil.

Sobrang deserve ni Maris makakuha ng maraming awards sa acting! Ang ganda! Ang galing!",10

Sunshine is absolutely perfect filmmaking. A simple plot - so simple that it risks being stale, but isn't! - that is executed with perfection and nuance. Sometimes the hardest things to get right are those that are the simplest. Superb casting.",No Rating
keisydt,"Aug 7, 2025",A Powerful 10/10 Film That Tells the Truth,"This 2024 Filipino film follows a teenage gymnast, Sunshine, whose Olympic dreams are suddenly derailed when she finds out she's pregnant. What unfolds is a raw, deeply emotional journey through shame, societal pressure, and the painful reality of having no legal access to abortion-something many women across Asia still face today.

The film doesn't sugarcoat anything. It shows exactly what's wrong with restrictive abortion laws in many Asian countries-how they silence girls, punish ambition, and force life-changing decisions on those who are still children themselves.

The movie itself is honest, hard-hitting, and emotionally devastating in the best way.

Maris Racal's performance was absolutely stunning. She carries the entire film with a performance that is real, raw, and unforgettable.

Sunshine should be shown in classrooms, government offices, and households. It's that important. It sparks urgent conversations about women's rights, bodily autonomy, and the price of silence.

Sunshine is one of the most courageous and necessary films to come out of Southeast Asia in recent years. It holds up a mirror to society and forces viewers to face uncomfortable truths. Anyone who thinks film can't change minds hasn't seen this one yet.

This is not just a good movie-this is essential cinema.

10/10. A masterpiece.",10
reybenipayo,"Jul 27, 2025",One of the most important Filipino films,"""Sunshine"" is not just the greatest Filipino movie I've seen but one of the most important Filipino films of all-time! This film deals with controversial topics in our society, abortion and teen pregnancy.

A week of national tryout for the gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal) finds out that she's pregnant. Conflicts arise as she has to decide what to do next. In between life and dreams, what's the most significant between the two?

The film is unconventional at best. This is not your usual and average Filipino drama you'll see. It's a character study about a teenager who is on the down side of her life. We follow her journey through this life and see a glimpse of her life dealing with her problem.

Maris Racal defines this film as Sunshine. Her acting here is brilliant. She's perfect for this role. Jennica Garcia surprised me. Her character as Sunshine's sister marks! What she said to Sunshine near the ending, though it's common, is like a punch to tears! I ended up loving her character. Jennica Garcia deserves an award for being the best supporting actress for this role. Another cast that standout is Rhed Bustamante and Xyriel Manabat both deserve a recognition for their role.

Blurring between reality and fantasy, mostly this film is realistic in portraying the whole theme thanks to Direk Antoinette Jadaone directions. Also, the cinematography is the best!

Overall, ""Sunshine"" is a women's movie. It's timely, affecting and brave to its theme. It doesn't spoon feed. It will make you immersed and think. It's worth an experience. This is a rare Filipino movie I've seen! I'm glad and proud watching this in cinema. After watching ""Sunshine"", it leaves me with a question, ""Is abortion a choice if your greatest dream will compromise?""",10
MitchA-38,"Jul 25, 2025",Sunshine is the collective experience of many Filipina,"We watched Sunshine yesterday, July 24, during the block screening at SM Megamall. I had seen the trailer beforehand, so I knew we were in for something bold, something necessary. But I wasn't prepared for how deeply it would sit with me long after the credits rolled.

I didn't cry while watching the film, but once it ended, I found myself overwhelmed. The weight of Sunshine doesn't hit all at once - it lingers, it settles. And it stays.

At its core, Sunshine is the story of a woman taking control of her body in a society that keeps telling her she isn't allowed to. It's not simply about one choice, one moment, or one woman. It's about the collective experience of many Filipinas who navigate a system that consistently fails to hear them.

Antoinette Jadaone's direction doesn't shy away from discomfort. She faces it head-on, inviting the audience to confront the silences we've learned to live with - about abortion, reproductive rights, the stigma around sexuality, and the lack of access to informed sex education in the Philippines.

Sunshine is timely, urgent, and painfully real. It gives voice to the cry of our generation, echoing the need for progressive reforms that protect women and children. The film challenges its viewers not just to empathize, but to act.

As a viewer, I left the cinema not only moved, but also awakened. Sunshine isn't here to entertain. It's here to disturb, to provoke, and to push us into uncomfortable yet necessary conversations.

To my fellow Filipinos: let's not turn away. Let's create spaces where women can speak freely, where choices about their bodies are met with compassion, not judgment. Let's demand that our lawmakers stop treating reproductive health as taboo.

To filmmakers and storytellers: keep telling these stories. We need more films like Sunshine-bold, unapologetic, and grounded in truth. The personal is political, and cinema has the power to move both heart and policy.

Let Sunshine be a beginning. Let it be a spark. And let's keep the conversation going.",9
PL-614,"Jul 30, 2025",Sunshine - A Raw and Eye-Opening Film,"Sunshine is truly an eye-opener. It bravely tackles real issues that so many young adults-and even kids who are just stepping into their teenage years-are silently going through. The film dives deep into the realities of early pregnancy, abortion, and the emotional and social weight that comes with them.

What I really hope is that parents take the time to watch this film. Not just to be aware, but to feel that urgency-the need to guide and talk to their children about these sensitive but important topics. It's a conversation that can't be delayed anymore.

What stood out to me the most was how real and raw everything felt. I didn't leave the cinema feeling happy, but I did feel relieved. I felt the pain, the heartache, and the struggle that Sunshine went through-but I also saw the strength in her journey. The story is complete. It gives you everything from beginning to end, no shortcuts, no sugar-coating.

I loved the film. I honestly want to watch it again-not just for the story, but for the emotions it stirred up and the awareness it brings. This film matters.",10
jjfilms72,"Aug 2, 2025","Perfect, Very Relevant","Will keep this short, but I can't due to the minimum characters. It perfectly captures and delivers the message it intends to relay. Just beautiful! Loved it!

Very, very relevant. Moves you even if you yourself cannot directly relate, and that is where the magic proves itself!

Great acting as well by almost everyone in the cast!",10
Vee-031,"Jul 30, 2025",Sunshine,"The performances are outstanding, with the lead actress delivering a raw and emotional portrayal of Sunshine's struggles. The supporting cast adds depth to the story, particularly the little girl, who brings a sense of wonder and curiosity to the film.

One of the most striking aspects of ""Sunshine"" is its refusal to provide easy answers. The film presents a realistic portrayal of the complexities surrounding reproductive choices, leaving viewers to ponder the moral implications.",10
imdbfan-156912,"Aug 5, 2025",Still processing. This film stays with you.,"Maris Racal delivers an incredibly raw and grounded performance. You feel her tension, her fear, her hope and the heartbreak that comes from making an impossible decision. She doesn't ask you to agree with her character. She just asks you to understand. And that's powerful.

Direk Tonet Jadaone has once again proven her gift for telling stories that cut deep. This film doesn't shout, but it lingers. It haunts you in the quiet moments. It reflects a reality many would rather not see one where shame is louder than support, and judgment comes faster than help.",10
FrancineM-969,"Dec 2, 2025",Responsibility is Also a Choice,"The film Sunshine, directed by Antoinette Jadaone, presents a deeply emotional and socially relevant story that challenges how Filipinos view teenage pregnancy, abortion, and womanhood. It is a complex and sensitive topic, especially in a country that is deeply rooted in religion and traditional values. As a viewer and as someone who is pro-abortion, I strongly believe that abortion should be legalized-not to promote recklessness, but to ensure safe healthcare for women who are placed in impossible situations.

What makes Sunshine powerful is how quietly but painfully it reflects reality. The film does not exaggerate emotions; instead, it shows how fear, confusion, and pressure from society weigh heavily on young women. It highlights how judgment often speaks louder than understanding. In many cases, the girl is seen as the only one responsible for what happened, while the systems meant to protect her fail.

In the Philippines, many people argue that illegalizing abortion teaches responsibility. But isn't choosing abortion also a form of responsibility? Knowing that you are not ready-emotionally, financially, or mentally-to raise a child can already be an act of maturity. We openly preach safe sex, yet we deny women access to safe abortion. This contradiction puts women's lives at risk.

For me, this issue is not about the rights of a fetus alone-it is also about the rights of a living woman. In my own view, if my mother had gotten pregnant in her teenage years while still chasing her dreams, I would rather not be born than be the reason her future was taken away. I would not remember it, I would not suffer from that decision-but at least she would have lived the life she wanted. That, too, is a form of love and sacrifice.

Another harsh reality the film touches on is how society treats teenagers who experience early pregnancy. Many say, ""They enjoyed it,"" or ""They wanted it."" But a child or a teenager needs guidance from responsible adults, not condemnation. Blaming them does not fix the problem. This is not about tolerating impulsive behavior-it is about educating both girls and boys, teaching accountability, protection, and respect.

Sunshine makes you realize that judgment is easy, but compassion is rare. The film reminds us that behind every controversial situation is a scared, confused young girl who still deserves empathy and protection.

Overall, Sunshine is a brave and emotionally heavy film that forces us to confront one of the most uncomfortable issues in Filipino society. It does not give easy answers, but it asks the right questions. For me, the film strengthens the belief that abortion should be legalized-not to promote irresponsibility, but to protect women, save lives, and give them the freedom to choose their own future. True responsibility does not come from punishment and shame, but from understanding, education, and safe choices. Sunshine is not just a movie-it is a mirror of our society and a challenge to our beliefs.",6
jouleZ,"Nov 26, 2025",A Missed Opportunity to Stick the Landing,"I had been waiting a long time to watch Sunshine, especially since I never got the chance to see it on the big screen. So, when it finally arrived on Netflix, I was so excited, only for that excitement to fade the longer I watched.

The premise is undeniably compelling: a young gymnast discovers she's pregnant just as her lifelong dream of reaching the Olympics is within reach. It's a setup filled with emotional stakes and potential for a powerful, character-driven story.

But instead of exploring her dedication to the sport, the film shifts almost entirely to her pregnancy and her attempts to deal with it. I kept waiting for scenes that would show her fighting for her dream, intense training, the pressure of competition, the physical and emotional toll of gymnastics, but those moments never really come. The narrative focuses more on side characters and subplots that feel unnecessary and, frankly, uninteresting.

I couldn't help comparing this film to other international athlete biopics that portray the grit, passion, and relentless work behind the journey. Sunshine had all the ingredients to deliver that kind of inspiring story, but it simply doesn't stick the landing.

Overall, I'm disappointed. With a stronger focus on the athletic journey and the challenges of balancing an unexpected pregnancy with Olympic ambitions, this could have been a much more compelling and memorable film.",4
miketkrwilliams,"Dec 7, 2025",This film truly highlights how anti abortion is violence against women,"While the subject is powerful and brave and the acting excellent, the execution and cinematography are weak, marring what could have been an excellent film.

What it does well is highlight how anti abortion is violence against women. It shows how the anti abortion crowd destroys the lives of young women through lack of sex education and lack of health care combined with horrid anti women propaganda.

The hospital scene where the evil ""Jesus"" Dr. Berates the propagandist for attempting an abortion absolutely enraged me because it is so accurate as to how women are treated.

I think the film would have been better if it has put more emphasis on Sunshine's sister who supported and helped her. I wanted more of that.

All that said, this is a powerful and timely film about an important subject. I applaud all those involved for having the courage to show the evil at the heart of Filipino culture, and for daring to stand up against the ""pro life"" machine.",8
