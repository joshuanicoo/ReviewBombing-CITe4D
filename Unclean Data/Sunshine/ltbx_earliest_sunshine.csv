mapleleaf,8,"Sunshine is on the verge of joining the national gymnastics team and going to the Olympics, when she loses focus, careens off balance, and falters. Dreams nearly in her grasp shift to distant phantoms as she realizes she is pregnant. Shaken, fearful, desperate, and determined not to lose her rightful place on the national team, Sunshine searches the underground of the city for abortifacients. Abortion and even divorce are illegal in the Philippines, so Sunshine has few options and few people she can trust. Just then a mysterious young girl appears in the darkness and crowded streets with knowledge of Sunshine’s heart that surprises her and touches her deeply.“I wanted to be brave for these girls,” said Maris Racal (Sunshine) “who have no one else to turn to.” Racal is intrinsically believable in her role. In the conservative religious culture of the Philippines and with the lack of access to reproductive support, many girls are in crisis. The issue is relatable and timely not just in the Philippines, but in many other countries including, unfortunately, our own.At this world premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, director Antoinette Jadaone said she got the idea for an imaginary friend from the film Jojo Rabbit. As part of her film research Jadaone interviewed girls who had abortions. She hopes the film sparks conversations and change, that it is part of the solution for the country, and helps girls in such situations make their own decisions.",2024-09-13,15,0,watch,True

denisemp,6,"This is a film of two parts. This film is part compelling drama, with a strong lead performance from the young actor and a powerful examination of the treatment of women in the Phillipines. This film is also part surrealist, but in a way that I feel undermines the strengths of the film. There is a young girl who appears at various points throughout the film; her identity is left to interpretation. However I feel that this apparition weakens every scene she's in. You'll have this powerful understated drama and then this wise-cracking girl appears to swear at you. It is clear that they couldn't even make her fit throughout the film because she disappears for at least half an hour in the middle. The filmmaker said this was the original core concept of the film and I understand that, but I feel that the film moved beyond the need for this character. I will say that I found the final interaction between the girl and our protagonist quite touching. Maybe if the girl was more understated it could have worked better. I do want to mention that it was really lovely to be in the TIFF audience for this one; the Filipino community was so passionate about this film and it was the longest and most involved Q&A I'd ever seen. It's really inspiring to see how beloved it was.",2024-09-14,13,0,watch,True

Just like how Queer paved an honest way of portraying gay men, Sunshine isn't like an abortion movie I've seen before. I'm always excited to watch a Filipino movie that breaks out into a critically praised festival run. As a Filipino who grew up in a family that owned a lot of Filipino movies, I was never a fan to be quite real with you. Filipino movies ranged from Hallmark style romances, repetitive action movies and cheesy low budget horror (although Shake, Rattle and Roll did slap). But every once in a blue moon there comes an ambitious director who tells an honest Filipino story that is both intimate in its narrative and expansive in its political themes. Sunshine doesn't hold your hand the way mainstream Filipino cinema does. It takes you on this journey of this ambitious woman who has to make the toughest choice of her life in order to determine her future. Surreal manifestations of her consciousness is brought out by imaginary characters in a way I never saw in abortion centred stories. Its so powerful. Want to watch this again with my parents.

mickpilgrim,8,"What sets ‘Sunshine’ apart is how writer-director Antoinette Jadaone roots the film in the Philippines’ conservative culture, shaped by Catholicism and its influence on public policies. While some moments may feel a bit heavy-handed, Jadaone delivers an earnest take on the tension between religious values and societal realities, while occasionally poking fun at certain hypocrisies. Another unique aspect of ‘Sunshine’ is how it weaves in magic realism. This creative approach, which is like a mix of Taika Waititi’s ‘Jojo Rabbit’ and Celine Sciamma’s ‘Petite Maman’, might not be for everyone; nevertheless, it enriches the discourse and keeps the narrative from feeling simplistic.

filmcirclerjct,10,"Early in this coming-of-age sports drama from Antoinette Jadaone, we see Maris Racal as the titular character, twisting and turning her body gracefully like a professional who's been doing this routine all her life. Right there and then, I told myself silently that this is going to be the best and most unforgettable performance of her career. In the film, she plays Sunshine, a dedicated young gymnast preparing for her team’s upcoming tryouts for the Olympics. But days before their tryouts, she discovers that she is pregnant. Now she must embark on a desperate and risky journey to fight for her dream.Penned and directed by Antoinette Jadaone, this is definitely one of her strongest works and one that truly stands out amongst all the films in her sprawling filmography, thanks to its solid script paired with equally confident direction. Her works, which are reminiscent of the late Marilou Diaz-Abaya, albeit with a more modern flair, are always centered around fully fleshed-out female characters who, while at times flawed, go through a transformative journey (case in point: directing That Thing Called Tadhana, Beauty in a Bottle (2014), Never Not Love You (2018), Alone/Together (2019), and Fan Girl (2020)). And this latest one is no different. Here, we follow a young woman faced with the burden of her unplanned pregnancy in a country like the Philippines, where abortion is illegal under all circumstances and has no exceptions, even in cases of rape, incest, or when the woman's life is at risk.It's honestly a pretty daunting task to write a story like this given its themes, let alone actually make one and release it in a highly conservative, mostly Catholic country like the Philippines. Yet Jadaone successfully completed the film without sacrificing her vision. The film manages to bravely portray the burden brought by unwanted pregnancies to women while men get a free pass in this patriarchal society designed by and controlled by men. It also paints how religious people can't help but keep shoving their beliefs on others instead of minding their own business. Most importantly, the film discusses the importance of a proper health care system in a third-world country like ours, which is run by capitalism and corrupt government officials. Instead of providing safe and accessible procedures like safe abortion for women, we have a country forcing them to find unsafe means on their own, endangering their lives in the process.Performance-wise, the film is packed with numerous talents, so not a single shot in the film is put to waste. Both Meryll Soriano as Sunshine's coach, Eden, and Xyriel Manabat as her best friend, Thea, are effective. Elijah Canlas nails the gaslighting asshole of a boyfriend, Miggy, while Jennica Garcia is simply brilliant as Sunshine's sister, Geleen. Other noteworthy turns include Rhed Bustamante, Juan Miguel Garcia, Angeli Bayani, and Piolo Pascual in a cameo role as Miggy's father. A young Annika Co also shines with her role as the young girl constantly nagging Sunshine.But the film will definitely not work if not for the career-best portrayal from its lead, Maris Racal, who delivers a tour-de-force performance as Sunshine herself. One can really feel and see the dedication she had for such a demanding role, physically and emotionally. Her performance really pulls you into the film and won't let go until the emotionally charged third act, making it one of the best local female performances I've seen this year so far.The film also boasts some great visuals thanks to Pao Orendain's slick camerawork and incredible music courtesy of Rico Blanco—a first for the singer-songwriter.Overall, this latest film from Antoinette Jadaone is one rollercoaster of emotions that is buoyed by a daring and electrifying performance from Maris Racal. It's a poignant, gripping and thought-provoking journey of a woman coming to terms with her own inner conflicts. It's already halfway through the year, but this is already the best Filipino film of 2025 in my opinion.Trust me, you will not be prepared for how powerful this film is.",2025-06-30,4,0,watch,True

alexyoken,8,"Claustrophobic, not just in how the frame is composed in several scenes, but in how it shows the extent in which the malignant structure of self-righteous patriarchal conservatism has done palpable harm to women and children everywhere. The film uses its central plotline to weave a rich tapestry of people and places that paint a picture of how this corrupted structure affects the titular protagonist, as well as the people around her. The tone possesses a gradually ratcheting anger at the oppressive status quo, going for the throats of its targets with at times bleak satire, or crushing nightmarish realities. This indignation, however, is ultimately fueled out of immense compassion. The film never really downs itself in hopelessness as it actively claws for hope, and never loses sight of Sunshine's agency through it all. Maris Racal's humane, scrappy performance is the total anchor of this film, carrying the heaviness with determination impressively.Although the breadth of the screenplay's scope is the film's biggest strength, there is some messiness in terms of scene-by-scene progression, and the more metaphorical/allegorical stuff doesn't fully coalesce with the film's more tangible arcs. Still, its willingness to take an approach both upfront and delicate to its central topic proves to be a burning, driving core towards a cathartic final endpoint. Meaningful, impassionate stuff.",2025-06-30,18,0,watch,True
philbertdy,9,"I am averse to making comparisons to Brocka, but here we are. You see it in this film's Manila, a hysterically cruel city that somehow maintains its kindness in its edges. Here we are, at the claws of light, a sliver of sunshine cutting through the darkness. Sunshine makes a lot of bad decisions, but that's all she has. This is a nation of bad decisions, especially when it comes to the plight of young women. And she has to weave through these apathetic streets to find the kindness that exists in spite of the cruelty.The film uses a device that I found tenuous at points, though I do think it works out in the end. It's just that the film is so good at depicting the casual reality of these characters and the city that surrounds them that I found the break from it a little distracting. The film is transcendent when it just shows us what this city is: a place where a churchyard is where you go to find abortion drugs, a city where a motel is hesitant to give you a room if you're alone, a place where a person charged with caring for you might also take it as an opportunity to shame you for your choices.At the heart of this is Maris Racal, who delivers what might be the performance of a lifetime. A lot is asked of the young actress, who is made to mask the rage of generations of women and put on the facade of someone who is pretending that all this will pass without incident. It is sadness and worry, but also the prevailing need to show the world that everything is okay. She gets ample support from the rest of the cast, with Jennica Garcia in particular embodying the spirit of this film in its most crucial moments.There were several moments watching Sunshine where I find myself saying, ""yes."" Yes, because I was agreeing with what the movie was saying. Yes, because it was showing me a Manila that felt right. Yes, because Racal was really nailing something. Yes, because the music just swelled at just the right moment. There will be much talk about what the movie says, what it argues in the face of a society that often feels immovable. But here we are. Here it is. All I can say is yes.",2025-07-01,1030,2,watch,True
mel_loz_,9,"“Mahirap maging babae, mas lalo na babae sa Pilipinas.”No matter how matriarchal, modern, or progressive we claim to be, women here are still shackled by outdated norms, patriarchal laws, and the belief that their bodies and their choices are not truly their own.Sunshine confronts these hard truths with unflinching honesty. The quiet desperation of having limited options. The shame bred by religious and societal expectations. The resilience women are forced to summon simply to survive.Maris Racal delivers a tour-de-force performance. I’ve loved her since Marupok AF, but here, she transcends. She carries the film with depth and vulnerability, her portrayal of Sunshine equal parts fragile and fierce.She’s matched beautifully by Jennica Garcia, whose turn as her older sister is quietly powerful. In her hands, sisterhood becomes a form of motherhood, a reminder that parenting can come from places we least expect.Sunshine hopes to be a catalyst for reproductive rights, choice, and change. And at its core, it’s a love letter to every Filipina who has ever had to fight for her rights and a light in the dark.Go see it.",2025-06-27,498,0,watch,True

upcinema,,"Cinemaster FJ Calvario says:In 2022, the government of Cuba had undertaken a bold move. It ratified a revision of its Family Code which redefined the “family”. It was no longer defined by only biological ties but also by relationships based on love and mutual support. This revised code is a radical piece of legislation, expanding the rights of women and children and recognizing same-sex marriages and adoption. It is a watershed moment for a country once colonized by Catholic Spain whose religious policies defined what was and wasn't allowed in society. In another corner of the world, the government of the Philippines continues to enforce the same religious norms set by Spain. Unlike Cuba, the Philippines has a long road ahead of itself in dismantling colonial legacy. A road perhaps may be paved by radical films such as Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine. A pioneer of the dialogue-driven hugot films of the 2010s, Jadaone is best known for her screenplays that blended comedy and romance. However, beginning with 2020’s haunting thriller Fan Girl which tackled male idolatry in the Duterte era, she seems to be on a sociopolitical streak in her directorial efforts. Her latest drama Sunshine now examines a woman’s decision to abort her pregnancy in a country where it is illegal and heavily stigmatized by the influential Catholic Church. At the heart of the film is the eponymous protagonist Sunshine (played by Maris Racal), a gymnast who dreams to compete for the Olympics. We first see Sunshine practice her routine in a stunningly directed scene showcasing well-paced editing and choreography. The pulsating electronic score by Rico Blanco is the cherry on top. He embodies his inner Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who coincidentally scored another sports film released the same year as this one. Her character’s Olympic ambitions remind me of the great women athletes in our country who have been making waves for their international achievements. I see in her the Olympic gold-winning weightlifter Hidlyn Diaz and the Wimbledon-competing tennis player Alexa Eala. But this dream of Olympic glory and national pride may not be realized if Sunshine decides to continue her pregnancy. We spend much of the film following her as she navigates through her personal relationships with her family and friends, her boyfriend, her gymnastics coach, and a mysterious girl who questions her decision to abort. It’s quite a cast really. Maris Racal makes the film as Sunshine; she plays her with steadfast determination. Bubbling behind Racal's eyes is great fear and tragedy. Xyriel Manabat does a lot with silent glances as Sunshine’s best friend Thea who begins to distance herself from her pregnant friend. Elijah Canlas epitomizes the upper class douchebag as Miggy the boyfriend, frequently speaking in straight English and hilariously offloading responsibility to his girlfriend. Annika Co as the mysterious nagging girl manages to be cute, annoying, and threatening in the same scene (although her character’s inclusion in the film is questionable and counter-intuitive, well intentioned as it is).Jadaone’s dense screenplay is riveting in its timeliness, empathy and boldness. The struggle of Sunshine in choosing between her career and an unwanted pregnancy recalls last year’s controversy around another athlete the Olympic gold winner Carlos Yulo who feuded with his mother over the latter’s misappropriation of his hard earned money. The discourse around the Yulo issue saw the clashing of cultures, the divide between conservatives (who viewed the athlete as an ungrateful son) and progressives (who championed Carlos’s autonomy). I expect the same discourse around Sunshine’s decision in choosing herself to unfold in Facebook comments sections once the film gets widely released in the country. It takes a cold heart not to be moved by Sunshine’s struggle for bodily autonomy. Jadaone situates her protagonist in the working class environs of Manila. It is a landscape defined by neglect and economic difficulties. Sunshine’s mother and father are nowhere to be seen, leaving only Sunshine and her siblings to fend for themselves. Sunshine meets a young girl who is also in need of money for her own abortion, having been raped by her own family member. Miggy refuses to share the burden of Sunshine’s pregnancy and keeps his distance. Beyond her words, Jadaone’s images (courtesy of cinematographer Pao Orendain) strikingly capture urban oppression. There is a great shot of Sunshine praying behind the grills of a church, visualizing the struggle between Catholic faith and personal freedom. There’s another great shot where a lone Sunshine is again framed behind a window of a motel beside a train line, highlighting how isolating her struggle can be. Who would want to give birth to a child into a world of constant struggle amidst economic hardship and social stigma? The screenplay brilliantly reimagines what a family and society could be. In the place of a mother and a father, Sunshine has two mother figures: her sister Geleen (played by Jennica Garcia) and her coach Eden (played by Meryll Soriano). Where other films would fixate on the familial tension between a parent and a child, this film is refreshingly optimistic in envisioning a family that supports and respects each other in their decisions, even with a decision as controversial as abortion. Sunshine’s supportive, orphaned family challenges the dominant Filipino imagination of the family (a father, a mother, and children). There is a wryly funny dialogue exchange in a Catholic hospital scene between Geleen and a conservative doctor where the former defends Sunshine by pointing out the doctor’s religious hypocrisy. Jadaone’s screenplay beautifully emphasizes the solidarity between women. Beyond interactions within her family, we see Sunshine helped by a kind doctor (played by Angeli Bayani) and, in turn, she helps a young pregnant girl (played by Rhed Bustamante). Even in an unjust male-dominated world, the film shows hope in the kindness among women. I have read reviews comparing this film to works of Lino Brocka and Marilou Diaz-Abaya. Perhaps, they are not far off. What Jadaone achieves in this film is the start of an honest conversation about women’s bodily autonomy in our society, much like what Brocka and Abaya have done in their social dramas during the Second Golden Age of Philippine Cinema. Time will tell how impactful Sunshine will be on legislation regarding abortion and other aspects of women’s rights. The Philippines, society and state, has a long way ahead to embrace progressive ideas, unlike for our fellow ex-Spanish colony Cuba. I suspect this film will trigger backlash among conservative audiences. God, imagine the online discourse and private message chains from concerned parents. But I do hope that close minded people would be moved by a film as empathetic as Sunshine.Watch Sunshine exclusively in SM Cinemas starting July 23",2025-07-05,48,0,watch,False
ceptune,5,"Very backlogged review but hey, to have a star such as Maris (who is great in this film) lead in a controversial topic in this day and age is a breath of fresh air. Antoinette Jadaone steps out of her comfort zone yet again to bring out one of her bolder works. I am happy that something like this is out there, don't get me wrong, but there is something so off and odd about representing their struggles with hallucinatory unborn children. Feels almost counterproductive. In the talkback, direk says that she was inspired by Jojo Rabbit with this style of narrative and I wish she went deeper in explaining her reasoning.

titoianlee,8,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is a powerful, intimate portrait of a young gymnast who discovers she’s pregnant just days before her Olympic tryouts. Rather than using the pregnancy as a dramatic twist, the film treats it as a deeply human moment—one that forces Sunshine to confront her identity, future, and agency as a young woman. Jadaone’s direction is sensitive and grounded, allowing the story to unfold with quiet urgency and emotional truth.The film bravely highlights the invisible struggles women face when ambition and reality collide. Through layered characters and subtle symbolism, Sunshine reveals how choices—especially for women—are rarely simple, often shaped by expectations and silent pressures.Maris Racal delivers a standout performance, capturing Sunshine’s vulnerability and strength with nuance. The final scene is restrained yet powerful, offering a deeply satisfying end. Sunshine is a brave, necessary film that speaks volumes about the difficult choices women must make in a world that rarely makes space for them.",2025-06-27,1,0,watch,False

dennynotdeeny,8,"What do you mean Sunshine walked from Quiapo Church to Siena College? I’d recognize that street corner anywhere. As in Fan Girl, the best thing about Jadaone’s filmmaking here is how she leverages unreality to create an immersive, tactile, and real subjective experience. The film is not just set in Manila, but Sunshine’s Manila, at times hypocritically prim and tragically seedy, both just different modes of alienation borne from the conservative milieu that devalues and abandons the marginalized among us, here particularly young women. It’s a potent text not because it presents clear answers—although its allegiance to its protagonist is never uncertain—but because it paints the sort of full and rich portrait of a woman’s life that the society it portrays cannot seem to imagine for the women in it. Very good.",2025-07-13,4,0,watch,True
chocolocotol,8,"Sunshine is a powerful, empathetic, and important film that bravely confronts a topic still considered taboo in the Philippines. As someone born and raised in the country, I found it both courageous and deeply resonant. It’s not just what the film is trying to say, but how it says it and, that stands out. They did it with care, nuance, and emotional clarity rarely seen in local cinema.Premiering internationally was also a smart and strategic move. It speaks to how difficult it still is to have open conversations around abortion back home. The truth is, stories that challenge long-held cultural or moral beliefs often need recognition from abroad before they’re embraced locally, a reflection of our lingering colonial mindset and deeply rooted conservatism.I truly hope Sunshine finds its audience in the Philippines. It deserves to, it needs to. Until we confront the systems that silence stories like these. Film this bold will remain the exception, not the norm. And for that alone, I commend Jadaone. We need films like Sunshine—not just to provoke, but to create space for real change.",2025-07-13,0,0,watch,False

carlparaan,10,"Gets na gets ko na. During the film's duration, I felt like I was drowning. I was drowning with Sunshine in the chaos of Manila's unsafe milieu. As she traverse the limited and unfair choices, the feeling of helplessness associated with the ticking time bomb inside her is tactile. I felt restrained from the very beginning until the penultimate scene because every obstacle she goes through, she can't show weakness; she has to show up with a brave face because of the programmed noise in her head; which was generated by the years of social norms put upon every woman's shoulder.One of the most profound and sensitive moments I found deeply moving was when Sunshine said, ""Hindi po ako buntis, coach"", yet her eyes was swelling with tears. She can't believe that this is the only truth she is forced to deal with, that everything she has worked for will end in a whim, and that the choice wasn't even deliberately made by her; mirroring the many women in the Philippines who undergo teenage pregnancy, who also don't have a safe choice for their bodies, and for their dreams. As I sit and bask in her story in the cinema, my tears kept falling even in the most simplistic emotions. Maybe that's what happens when you feel like you've already lost the battle even if you haven't started to face it it yet. Maybe that's how it feels to be in the losing end of the decisions made by the very society that should be protecting you. Maybe this is how it is to step in the shoes of every woman in the Philippines, and at the very least, it's only a feeling I can imagine.Honestly hought this film wouldn't make a willful statement. But it takes a stand, and at the core of it is Maris Racal; supported by a riveting ensemble just as honest as her. Direk Antoinette Jadaone weaved the story with compassion through the lens of real stories of real women. She made a deliberate choice to conceive this film, and this time, it was made by her.",2025-07-23,0,0,watch,True

I don't know how hard it must've been to make this release work given how abortion is still illegal in this country and the stigma surrounding it. Such an empathetic film that's filled with so much heart despite how other people make it seem like an immoral decision. As Direk Tonet said in the Q and A screening I went to, as a writer, she sides with her characters whether people think the decisions that her character makes is right or wrong. In other words, she doesn't give a fuck what other people thinks about abortion. As for Maris, damn, what a performance. She's known to be more expressive and she admits as well that the hardest thing for her is leveling that down that she has to unlearn even the small nuances that she does. Such a vulnerable performance. Give her the recognition she deserves.We have been behind as a country when it comes to talking about reproductive health and women's rights but I hope given how widely this film is being seen right now that it sparks the necessary conversation not only in our society but also in our government that at the very least, decriminalize abortion.Side note: what a complete 180 when I saw this after watching Fantastic Four",2025-07-23,2,0,watch,True

aarondavem,9,"Sa Pilipinas, ang mga tulad ni Sunshine ay pinipilit habulin ang liwanag kahit paulit-ulit silang nilulunod sa dilim.Alam naman nating lahat: illegal ang aborsyon sa bansang ito. Pero kailanman, hindi ito makakapigil sa aborsyon. Ang nagagawa lang nito ay itulak ang mga babae sa delikado, hindi ligtas, at hindi kontroladong paraan. At ipinakita sa atin ng pelikulang ito kung gaano ka-mapanganib iyon. Mula sa pagbebenta ng pamparegla sa mga black market hanggang sa mga hilot na hindi naman ginagawa ng propesyonal—lahat ‘yan ay repleksyon ng desperasyong hindi nila ginusto, kundi bunga ng sistemang patuloy silang pinapabayaan.Pero hindi lang aborsyon ang laman ng pelikulang ito. Binuksan nito ang mas malawak na usapin—bulok na healthcare system, paniniwalang relihiyoso na ginagamit panlaban sa kababaihan, incest, rape, teenage pregnancy, pressure bilang atleta, takot sa kahihiyan, at moralidad na tila laging nakasandal sa pananakit ng babae. Pinakita ng pelikula ang buong paligid ni Sunshine—pamilya, paaralan, simbahan, coach, kaibigan, doktor—at kung paano sila naging bahagi ng problema o ng solusyon.At sobrang tamang-tama lang na sa Maynila ito kinunan. Sa Morayta, Recto, at Quiapo—mga lugar na malapit sa University Belt, kung saan maraming estudyante ang nakakaranas ng hindi planadong pagbubuntis. Mga lugar rin ito na kilala sa underground na kalakaran—mula sa pekeng dokumento hanggang sa black market na pampalaglag. Realidad ito ng maraming kabataan, at pinili ng pelikula na hindi ito pagtakpan.Wala itong pa-plot twist. Walang engrandeng eksena. Pero ramdam mo ang bigat. At naipaabot niya ang mensahe nang malinaw sa masa, sa bawat Pilipinong kailangang mamulat. Hindi para mangumbinsi, kundi para magpasimula ng pag-uusap. Pag-uusap na maaaring maging tulay tungo sa legalisasyon—o kahit dekriminalisasyon—ng aborsyon sa bansa natin.Sobrang husay ni Maris Racal. Para siyang talagang gymnast. Lahat ng galaw may kahulugan. Lahat ng tahimik na sandali, may sigaw. Kudos sa choreographers—dahil bawat routine, may sariling kwento.Si Sunshine ay isa lang. Pero napakarami pang katulad niya. Iba-iba man ang dahilan, iisa ang dapat malinaw: ang desisyon ay dapat laging nasa babae. Sa katawan nila. Sa buhay nila.Hindi kailangan ng pelikula ng sagot. Pero may lakas ito para magtanong. At sa isang bansang takot harapin ang tanong, sapat na iyon para tawaging rebolusyonaryo.Sana ang Sunshine na ito, maging sinag ng panibagong simula. #LegalizeAbortion",2025-07-23,5,0,watch,False

At sa gitna ng lahat ng ingay, ay isang babaeng may pangarap— tumatakbo, lumalaban.I have so many to say about the political nature of this film but I think at its core, Sunshine is about understanding. Hindi natin kailangan baguhin ang paniniwala natin, kailangan lang natin matutong umintindi sa kalagayan at sitwasyon ng iba.If you don’t believe in abortion, don’t get one. Same goes with the idea of divorce and same sex unions. Why limit the choices of others? The screenplay works so well along with its perfect casting. Lahat bagay na bagay sa role lalo na si Maris as Sunshine. I also love the cinematography lalo na sa Quiapo scenes. I felt the chaos through that. We know our country is fucked up when women can’t make choices for themselves. We know we’re fucked up when we’ don’t have safe and accessible abortions. We know we’re fucked up when we can’t pass laws like the divorce bill and the sogie bill. So what do we do after this? Hindi sapat ang isang pelikula upang baguhin ang sistema.

It will leave you with a lot of questions, isa na doon ay kung kailan nga ba nagiging tama ang hindi dapat, at kailan ba hindi tama ang dapat? One thing’s for sure, it will leave you with a heavy heart— sapat para kuwestyunin ang sistema kung bakit hanggang ngayon, ipinagkakait pa rin ang reproductive rights sa mga kababaihan.Hindi man ikaw si sunshine, wala ka mang kaibigan o kakilalang sunshine, pero alam mo na totoong totoo siya and she exists somewhere out there.Isa siyang babaeng pilit hinaharap ang mapanghusgang lente at konserbatibong pananaw ng lipunan kung saan hindi nila nakikita ang paghubog sa kaniya ng isang sitwasyon na iniwan siyang walang ibang pagpipilian.At the end of the day, it’s really just empathy and compassion.

moviecatts,10,"The best Filipino film I’ve seen so far this year.Raw, relevant, and worth talking about.Set in Manila: masikip, mainit, mabaho. The film captures it so well that you can almost smell and feel it. Beneath that heat and heaviness is a quiet story of sacrifice. It powerfully portrays the struggles of women in a deeply patriarchal society. Young women are expected to give way, to carry the weight, to make the harder choice. While men are often free to walk away, women are left at the crossroads, torn between duty and ambition, between what they want and what they are told they should become. Its honest portrayal of everyday hardship, mixed with strong feminist themes, feels like it is channeling both Lino Brocka and Marilou Diaz-Abaya.The film also reflects the quiet hypocrisy we see in everyday life. No one is truly exempt. People speak of values, yet live with contradictions. The film shows us these double standards in a way that makes you reflect.Maris Racal is so, so good as Sunshine. The rest of the cast is just as strong. Jennica Garcia, Meryll Soriano, Annika Co, Elijah Canlas, Rhed Bustamante and the rest of the casts are all remarkable. I also appreciate how even the crowd and background extras were credited at the end. It speaks volumes about how everyone involved was valued.And what a story it is. Raw, relevant, and worth talking about. Sunshine is not just the best Filipino film I have seen this year. It is one that dares to ask difficult questions and sit with uncomfortable truths. Brave and thought-provoking, it will likely spark conversation after the ending credits. Some of the choices in the film may feel morally difficult, and not everyone will agree with them. But the real question is, who are we to decide what is right for someone else? Are we even in their place to judge?More than anything, Sunshine reminds us to be kind. To live with empathy. To listen, to pause, and to try to understand before we judge.Just like these past few days, the rain has not stopped. For some, it is a blessing. For others, it feels like a never-ending trial. But in the middle of it all, we wait for the same thing: Sunshine.Sunshine that reminds us that after the storm, healing begins. And slowly, we rise. 🌤️",2025-07-23,576,6,watch,True

And it was clearly hers and her boyfriend’s choice to be unprotected. And when she decided to tell him she was pregnant, both of them had to make choices. But when legal options run out for Sunshine and the only choice she can make is to abort through illegal means, she puts her own life at risk. But it is also in making a choice that Sunshine finds herself.God’s Gift Sunshine leaves a jeepney with the words God’s Gift. She walks towards Quiapo church and asks for forgiveness, and outside the church there is a market selling religious things, but also potions that “induce menstruation”. A medical professional preaches God at Sunshine’s bedside after her “medicine” fails her. And it says a lot about the structures surrounding young women with unwanted pregnancies. Later on in the film, we see the impact of these structures on them. They are forced to make decisions that risk their lives.Full of GraceMaris Racal is perfect at portraying Sunshine’s physicality and character. Her performance will make you believe she’s an Olympian who can take the spotlight and get everyone’s attention, a sister who learns how important it is to make her family proud, but most importantly, a dreamer who understands her young age is the right opportunity to change the world around her. I will never feel the exact same way as Sunshine experienced, but as a male audience, the film still allows me to put myself in Sunshine’s hard and difficult situation.

Orendain’s shots don’t try to elevate the story—they move hand-in-hand with it, gripping tightly to the isolation of being a young woman in the Philippines.I haven’t seen any Filipino film tackle abortion quite like this. The nuance of setting it in a deeply religious country is compelling. It opens the conversation, but perhaps plays a little too safe—maybe to appeal to a broader audience. I was hoping for a stronger push, but it chooses to be understated: a film beaming with quiet urgency and an accurate reflection of the current climate surrounding women’s reproductive rights.",2025-07-23,4,0,watch,False

dvnaugust,10,"There’s a lot to unpack in Sunshine, but let me begin by saying this: Maris Racal owns this character. There’s no other actress who could have pulled off Sunshine the way she did. She embodied every bit of the character so completely that Maris disappears—you’re not watching Maris as Sunshine; you’re watching Sunshine herself. Her performance is quietly powerful and emotionally charged, grounded in rawness and empathy.But this film isn't just carried by Maris alone. Alongside her are Annika Co, Jennica Garcia,and Rhed Bustamante, who play pivotal roles in deepening Sunshine’s story. In many ways, their characters are Sunshine—reflected through different lenses. Through themes of mental health and teen pregnancy, the film constructs a layered portrait of girlhood under pressure. It's raw, empathetic, bold, and unafraid. It doesn’t flinch from the truth, nor does it romanticize the pain.What Sunshine does best is handle a very sensitive subject in our country with sincerity and urgency: the ongoing struggle for bodily autonomy. It quietly and firmly illustrates the emotional toll of being a young woman in a society that refuses to let her decide for herself. And worse, how these conversations remain taboo.Every silence in the film is so loud. The pauses, the stillness, the unspoken—Sunshine knows that some of the loudest screams come from what isn’t said. The film allows space for emotion to breathe, for truths to sink in, and for viewers to truly feel the weight these girls carry.The producers behind Sunshine had to fight to get this film seen—not for profit, but because these are stories that matter. They pushed forward to open a much-needed conversation on bodily autonomy and reproductive rights. And it’s 2025—yet these issues are still being dismissed, invalidated, or worse, treated like they’re myths. In truth, they are not up for debate. They are basic rights that every woman deserves.I only hope that in the years to come, we won’t need another Sunshine just to get people to listen.Panoorin ang Sunshine, hindi lang dahil gusto n'yo, kundi dahil kailangan.

It brings you to the darkest alleys of Manila where hope feels nowhere to be found, especially in a political climate where a woman is at a disadvantage, for the lack of a better term.Sunshine is disturbing in such a way that a woman, in this modern age, is still left with limited options, or the lack thereof, and has no autonomy in doing informed decisions on her own body amidst retribution of a patriarchal society.Sunshine is moving. It kicks. It punches. Five months after its Berlinale win, Sunshine comes home, and it needs traction. It is high time to make the conversation going until, for some divine intervention, it reaches the people that should be of utmost concerned about the plight of women.Sigh.

reviewsbyrich,9,"2:30pm AWKP Screening @ SM North with Direk Tonet Jadaone & Maris Racal We live in a nation of choices & contradictions where women are the ones who are burdened with most of its unwanted consequences. Abortion? Illegal. Teenage pregnancy? Immoral. Contraceptives? Taboo. Elders look down on women who have pre-marital sex, unwanted pregnancy, and even an ounce of body autonomy.Beneath clouds of apathy & judgment, SUNSHINE reminds us to choose empathy & compassion.Nora Aunor was Bona. Hilda Koronel was Insiang. Today, Maris Racal is SUNSHINE.To bring up Lino Brocka is a heavy statement itself, but the Crystal Bear winning-SUNSHINE has also memorized Manila, and all its aches and decays. In her background are the familiar veins of Avenida & Quiapo. The heaviness of everyday life, religion and culture all add to her already buzzing headspace. She tries and must drown out the noise.With this award-worthy role, Maris might just have earned her place among the revered women in Philippine cinema who have embodied the honesty and rawness of the Filipina experience—in their respective era, each still under the same problematic patriarchal society.There's an all-timer hospital scene that stayed with me the most. As a medical student, what we're taught often align with Catholic teachings, even if our personal beliefs say otherwise. Our hope is that the next generation of health professionals will be provided with aligned legislation and protection that will help them become more compassionate, empathetic, and sensitive to women's autonomy over their bodies. These conversations should start not just in household discussions but in our social institutions as well.Elijah Canlas nails the recklessness of a young boy scared to man up. Xyriel Manabat's eyes speak for themselves. Jennica Garcia is simply luminous and embodies the 'Ate' in our lives. Her tough love exterior melts whenever Sunshine needs her genuine guidance. Meryll Soriano's presence is calming and reassuring. Piolo Pascual delivers friction and captures the high and mighty men in our society who assume to know all about everything and everyone, especially women’s needs. This is Direk Antoinette Jadaone's career-best work, yet. And at the heart of it all is Maris Racal, delivering a thrilling performance that will catapult her to superstardom.",2025-07-23,73,2,watch,True

notetonie,10,"This film on female reproductive health boldly centers the female gaze, offering a fresh and unflinching take on the realities that many Filipinas face. It attempts to break the glass ceiling of deeply rooted Filipino norms and challenges the culture shaped by religion, stigma, and silence around topics like abortion, sex education, and women’s health.Direk Tonet Jadaone masterfully captures the struggles of the protagonist, whose aspirations are put on hold after she discovers she’s pregnant. The film follows her journey, portraying how a woman navigates the weight of societal expectations in a culture that often leaves little room for personal agency.Cinematically, it’s far from your typical Filipino cliché. The pacing is tight, the cinematography is visually compelling, and each scene is deliberate, drawing the viewer into the emotional and social turmoil the character endures. The film allows us to witness how Sunshine finds resilience amidst adversity, all while shedding light on the layers of deprivation and injustice a Filipina can experience in a patriarchal society.More than just a narrative, the film leaves an impact. It sparks important conversations about our broken systems—the stigma surrounding reproductive health, the taboo nature of sex education, the inaccessibility of contraceptives, and the criminalization of abortion. It confronts how society often reduces women to objects of pleasure or vessels of reproduction, without regard for their mental or physical well-being.Ultimately, this is a film about empowerment. It’s a powerful reminder that women can dream for themselves, stand their ground, and rise above a system designed to keep them down. Thought-provoking and timely, it’s a testament to Direk Tonet Jadaone’s bold storytelling and her commitment to stories that matter.",2025-07-23,1,0,watch,True

It feels incredibly real because it reflects life in the Philippines, where women's rights are acknowledged but often support a male-dominated system and the patriarchy.""Sunshine"" tells the story of many women living in the Philippines. In this country, discussions about sex and sex education are frequently considered taboo. Many people talk about sex negatively, treating it as something sinful rather than educational. As a result, issues like teenage pregnancy are primarily viewed as public health problems. Furthermore, while there is a law aimed at protecting women from violence, it forces victims of sexual abuse to carry any resulting pregnancy to term, even in tragic circumstances such as r4p3.With abortion being illegal in the Philippines, many women find themselves in difficult situations. Those facing unplanned and unwanted pregnancies may have to consider unsafe options, which can threaten their lives.Women's rights must prioritize the well-being and choices of women, not men. The self-righteousness and views of certain religious groups should not dictate whether abortion is legalized. Women must have the power to make choices about their bodies.""Sunshine"" is a story of hope, second chances, and pursuing dreams. It hopes for a better society where women are not scrutinized for claiming rights over their bodies. This movie is a bold and significant step for film in the Philippines, as it represents the experiences of many women in the country. We must continue the conversation and let this film be a part of the movement advocating for better women's rights.Without a doubt, Maris Racal brought life to her character, Sunshine.

sirmiroro,9,"Sunshine is an aspiring Olympian. She is two weeks away from performing in the qualifying round. She has won numerous gold medals in local and Asian competitions, making her an ideal candidate for an Olympic gold. But everything changes when she discovers an unwanted pregnancy. In a male-dominated, conservative, church-leaning country, who can help Sunshine achieve her dreams?Jadaone's latest picture is a gritty coming-of-age sports drama that tackles a sensitive yet realistic portrayal of the struggles women face when the government and society turn their backs on them. It is a claustrophobic journey that dims the shine of its lead character even before she sees the end of the tunnel. The film offers a timely and relevant discussion on gender roles, sex education, the health care system, body autonomy, female rage, and empowerment.At its center is Maris Racal, who plays the titular character with grace, bareness, and nuance. She embodies the sunshine amidst a dirty, hypocritical, careless, and immovable society that becomes a character of its own. This is supported by the film’s striking eye for cinematic framing of the ragged city of Manila.I love how the film handles the core of its subject: should Sunshine get an abortion and continue chasing her dreams, or take the baby and live a life she is not prepared for? I love how the women characters come together to help each other against the oppressive weight of our patriarchal society.And when Sunshine finally makes a decision, I don’t think the film wants you to agree or disagree with her. It wants you to ask why she had to be in this position in the first place. It wants us to notice the shoulder-to-shoulder crowding in public maternity wards. It wants us to see the hypocrisy of a society where black markets for abortion operate in the shadows of churches, and why a woman still cannot make a decision about her own body without judgment from everyone around her.Pero gets kita, Sunshine.

newrev,8,"Sunshine is a statement. Raw, delicate, and bold. It presents a social commentary on themes rarely explored yet deeply prevalent in the Philippine context. It dares to be radical. It dares to draw the line. When does the sun finally shine in a morally gray cloud of social disapproval?As linear and straightforward as the film appears, beneath it lies a complex character study — fearlessly told, thematically sharp, and emotionally unsettling. Antoinette Jadaone writes for women, and in a cinematic landscape like ours, we need more voices like hers. I was initially worried about where the story would go, but it was brave enough to take the harder path.This is Maris Racal's best performance yet — nuanced and quietly powerful. But it was Jennica Garcia who stole every scene she was in. She was the emotional anchor, the tearjerker. Some casting choices outside the leads, however, fell short. Certain scenes and narrative decisions could have landed harder with stronger performances or more fitting direction.That said, the editing needs work. The presence of a stunt double in certain scenes is obvious, breaking immersion. While the film’s visuals hauntingly capture a side of Manila we rarely see on screen, the sound design lacks polish. These flaws are noticeable but not deal-breaking.Still, this film succeeds in doing what few others do: it makes you ask what is ethical and what is not. It invites reflection. And when a film draws that line clearly for society to see, perhaps that’s when the sun truly begins to shine.",2025-07-23,1,0,watch,False

But sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing when you have so many people telling you what to do, or when you don’t have the resources to do so. It’s hard to drown out the noise in your head when everything around you is so loud. Sometimes you don’t even need someone to tell you what to do at all, because you already know. Sometimes all you need is someone to be by your side. Something to make you feel like youre not alone. A text message from a friend. A hug from a sister. A pair of compassionate eyes of a stranger. Despite feeling alone in her whole ordeal, Sunshine was held together by the women she encounters. From the child, her sister, the cashier at the motel, the doctor at the hospital.I was lucky enough to have my own community lift me up at a time when I thought i was done for. It’s because of them that I’m still here, and that I still keep going. “Mahalin mo si sunshine, kahit ano pa siya, kahit ano pang nagawa niya”, said my friend.

bcd2114,,"The film has a sense of urgency about it, presenting the drama with so much eagerness, firm convictions, and intense sentiments nearly to the point where it devolves into cheap propaganda for a cause with which I happen to agree ideologically. It was too on the nose and constantly going for shock value that it was draining to follow, brazenly provoking the audience to feel for a horrible social reality but instead of pointing it out with a nod and a commentary, it was trying so hard to make them feel bad about those situations. Not in a good way because it is one of those things that breeds frustration rather than empathy for the protagonist. At some point, Sunshine simply disappeared, becoming a vessel for the audience to put their shoes on since she is subjected to so much oppression, losing any semblance of agency as it is all about how messed up her social reality has become. It's the same problem I had with war films and other poverty porn, where it ignores developing the protagonist in favor of escalating the situations in front of her and throwing every miserable conflicts imaginable at her. To be fair, the protagonist as a vessel had an aspiration, a threatened dream that was about to be broken, and the idea of her interacting with all these women, smoothly transitioning from the one who needed help to the one who provided help, clearly distinguished the film from those with a typical point-of-view character. Those moments of empowerment and camaraderie with other women may have eased the tension and made it feel more hopeful than the premise implies, but it also falls into the trap of caricaturing other characters for the sake of cheap sensationalism. It also felt betraying that so many things transpired that the gymnastics was set aside for so long, and I would hope that it was more of an escape than a hardship because no joy was displayed during those routines except for the last act. I would say that the sport was not seamlessly wedded to the character, since it could have been any sport or dream, and the film would still be effective. The magical realism element is essentially what I detest about the film, because it could have lingered in the loneliness and allowed the audience to connect with the character through subtlety, but it had to be filled with hypothetical conversation that hits the audience on the head to explain the themes and demonstrate the unspoken dilemmas in the present predicament. It could be interpreted as a mean to communicate guilt, a process of forgiving oneself and empathizing with other women, or as humanizing the fetus inside the body, which I'm not sure how to feel about that ideologically. It's also tonally odd, which is a Philippine cinema branding at this point, but it's always convenient to use a child for humor, and it reduces the overall tone of what's happening to the main character. It was just too telegraphed at times, and I was hoping to let the sequences play out and use more silence because those are the scenes I enjoy when the protagonist is alone and burdened by her situation. The upward momentum of a film that begins bleakly will always impede any form of storytelling because it must outdo itself, building emotions that are overwhelming every ten minutes to the point of monotony. In fact, I can't recall the chronology of the film even though I saw it yesterday, but I do remember every segments and the emotions it was going for. It actually came to the point of absurdity in the third act, when one character emerged, followed by a terrible circumstances, followed by even more bleak information and an unsettling confrontation, which would undoubtedly disturb anyone. And then there was a cameo in which the small theater collectively whisper and giggle a bit as a result of being taken off guard, which again felt awkward because it always has to make a joke after every other miserably effective scene. Not letting the moments breathe for a while. It can even be tonally confusing at times, with scenes that is either attempting to be comical or unsettling as some of the dialogue was just satirical and they incorporate some triggering monologue ala Vincentiments, but they also made the film lighthearted, which I am not sure is a good thing. I suppose I want my abortion movies to be more thought-provoking and full of sociological nuances rather than funny and emotional, because it can be too loose for its sensitive subject matter, but it was heartfelt and that was good. I'm making it seem like I hate this film when than I don't because it was terrific and entertaining, but it's just that I'm not sure if those are the things I want to take away from this film. I have to say though that it had a very good filmmaking mechanics. I heard they tried to hide the camera in public scenes to make the setting appear more authentic, and I was expecting long takes because it was another Filipino film about a protagonist wandering around which they did not employ at all, but I kind of like what they did here, from the shot composition and coverages to the way they were edited together. The only criticism I had regarding the filmmaking was the noticeable stunt double in the gymnastic routines, as well as how the emotions in the close-ups did not match those in the wide shots whenever they intercut them together. I suspect no one grins when doing gymnastics since it is a serious performance by meticulous athletes rather than by an exuberant victorious person, as the film claims at the conclusion. It's just a little quibble, but I commend the filmmaking overall and even the rough cuts were fantastic. Definitely the best-directed Filipino film I've seen in quite some time, I can say that with confidence.",2025-07-23,1,0,watch,True

_filmonella,8,"Antoinette Jadaone has always been one of the few Filipino filmmakers I deeply admire, not just for her craft, but for the way she tells women’s stories with empathy and nuance. Her work has always felt personal, films like Alone/Together, Fan Girl and now Sunshine, might just be my favorite Filipino film released this year so far.I remember seeing the trailer last year and wondering if it would even get a proper release here. It tackles such a taboo topic, one that many in this country still refuse to even speak about. That’s why I admire Jadaone so much. She’s chosen to talk about what others won’t. In a predominantly Catholic nation where abortion is criminalized, even in cases of rape or incest, Sunshine feels like an act of courage.I’ve always been pro-choice. I grew up surrounded by the whole “abortion is murder” narrative, from relatives, from my old Catholic school run by nuns. But even as a kid, it never sat right with me. I never saw it as a sin. And now that I’m studying to become a doctor, that belief matters even more to me, because women deserve healthcare that doesn’t judge or shame them. Sunshine affected me on a personal level because of that. It reminded me why I want to do this.It’s not a perfect film. Some might find the pacing fast or feel like it didn’t say enough. But to me, the point isn’t perfection. What matters is that it exists. It dares. It’s a film that opens doors, uncomfortable ones, sure, but necessary. I really hope it’s not the last of its kind.",2025-07-24,1,0,watch,True

Through the streets of Manila to the corners of her room, we get to hold hands with her and be a confidant. I like how it positions the audience as part of this journey, not as the usual bystander. One sequence that stood out is the one from the inn to the hospital - Maris lets herself be consumed by Sunshine, almost as if the creeping is part of the routine itself. The messaging gets confusing in the middle but ultimately ends in a tender moment of acceptance and determination.

pinathbutter,9,"In a Q&A with writer-director Antoinette Jadaone that I was lucky to attend, she was asked how she braced for the potential backlash of this film from Filipino audiences given our mostly conservative background. Her answer resonated with me deeply: As a writer, Jadaone believes her primary duty is to stay loyal to her characters. If her character's arc demands visiting unnerving and controversial depths, she is not afraid to take the plunge - regardless of how viewers might perceive it. Her earlier work, Fan Girl (2020), already painted a similar picture, albeit a bit spottily.Jadaone takes her boldest steps yet in her latest work, Sunshine (2024), by tackling abortion, a highly contentious subject in the country, with both sensitivity and grit. This entry is unflinching in its commentary, taking us to the most harrowing places women can be in a nation where sexual abuse is prevalent, abortion is illegal, and healthcare fails the underprivileged . Sunshine, our protagonist, is a skilled gymnast, but even she can't leap over patriarchy, tumble past outdated laws, or cartwheel her way out of the conservative society and system. In one scene, Sunshine waits along a street choked with tricycles, behind the railing of a pharmacy counter - she is jailed in and by this wretched city, made a criminal for wanting to make a choice that should be her right. But this film's Manila is more than just Sunshine's prison. It's a breathing character, trailing her around from scene to scene. Always in the backdrop but never invisible. Never speaking but always loud. A passing MRT train rattles the windows of a shabby motel. A crammed jeepney bounces to the bass of a local rap song. Grimy streets teem with hustling vendors and weary residents. Sunshine makes her choices, but her choices are only as good as this bleak, brutal city allows . Maris Racal delivers a phenomenal performance, portraying our protagonist with nuance and raw intensity. She is backed by a stellar ensemble - Jennica Garcia, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, and Elijah Canlas - each breathing life into characters that are authentic and vital to the film's message. The sequences are daring, the story beats sometimes violent, but always necessary. The music elevates it all, with a standout Challengers-esque score underscoring the gymnastic scenes. This film is not without its faults though, with excessive cursing (seriously, again in a Project 8 work?), somewhat awkward acting, and some unpolished plot points, but these are forgivable given how effective the complete work is.Sunshine may very well be Direk Tonet's finest work yet - and rightly so.

iauqmaj,,"i was deeply moved and inspired by sunshine. what a gem of philippine cinema. you know a film is good when it makes you want to create again. however, while undeniable in its prowess and relevance, its potency and impact dwindles in its struggle to pinpoint with conviction who its target audience is. it seems to want to pander to both liberal and conservative audiences, but this muddles its message. who is this film really for? who is it in dialogue with? i thought that the choice to portray the unborn fetus as a grown, conscious being was counterintuitive at first, but then i realized the film was only trying to meet its conservative audiences halfway in their beliefs. then i thought it was a stroke of genius: of course, the only way to convince someone to change their mind is by explaining it in the terms they understand, through their perspective of the world. but then it also alienates this very audience by demonizing them in the film. while it successfully empathizes with the horrors of being a woman in the philippines, there is a lack of nuance, a dichotomy of good vs. evil, that might be more harmful than helpful in the grander scheme of things.(there are also so many scenes where maris racal’s quiet yet powerful performance should have been enough, but the beauty of the moment is ruined by the “child” voicing out sunshine’s thoughts, spoon-feeding the audience.)only particularly critical because i think sunshine is an exciting step in the right direction for ph cinema. i loved it and i think everyone should still watch it in spite of its flaws.",2025-07-23,3,0,watch,True

targrod,10,"The tone set by Sunshine over Jadaone's previous film, Fangirl, is way different. The urgency of survival is apparent and how it clashes with the film's thematic journey, like Paul Soriano's Thelma. Though Sunshine tends to get the feel of guerrilla direction, it is a combination of the director's experiences in mainstream and her indie roots. Meaning, we get to see well-lighted scenes and less usage of shake cam.Sunshine unpacks a lot of society's ills and inequalities. Patriarchy, discrimination in the medical field, inhumane laws, and glaring social class issues that don't benefit those without that much. In a country where religion reigns, or so they say, the film easily relays problems with well-made sequences and heartbreaking results. Jadaone knows the voices of her characters, and it tells a distinct topic with passion and wit, giving the audiences a rollercoaster of emotions.One thing that makes this film unique is the inclusion of a fantastic element. It somehow references, or a styling of, what they had in Death Note anime or Big Mouth to make it more accurate. And such symbolism as Sunshine's conscience made it relatively easier to tell the film's narrative. It was smartly added, and it didn't make the audience unintelligent.The technical are overwhelmingly great. The use of lighting in urban areas, especially those scenes shot at night, is worthy of a picturesque view of the marginalized reality. We rarely see such strong shots in film. The options to use close-ups for intensity of emotions and certain decisions to make the scenes with Mariz Racal's gymnastic performance were made with careful efficiency. And the sound editing was just on point. It is technically the protagonist's in-ear audio being shared with the viewers.Jadaone's casting is really one for the books. An appreciation to Mariz Racal's graceful bookend performance. The representation is exactly what we need to see from young adults, especially in the situation of what is happening to her character. The conflict-bearers really made the sequences memorable, and it made you think of the situations presented. These aren't farfetched ideas shown in the film. Most of them are realistically sound and Piolo Pascual's short stint really is just something for us to gasp about. And we also get to see Jennica Garcia and Elijah Canlas' supporting roles to complete the ensemble.Les we forget Annika Co's strong personality. I guess we have another star made by the director. And regarding Meryll Soriano being part of the film. It made me remember how she did a similar role back in 2010, as Lizette in the Mark Meily film, Donor.Sunshine displays what needs to be said in a society when abortion is considered a taboo topic. A possible eye-opener to the current status quo. .:smcityeastortigas>>",2025-07-23,3,0,watch,True

I sometimes felt the script and characters could have been more seamlessly sewn, and not just coming out of nowhere, making it feel a bit unnatural. Nevertheless, this is an essential film that needs to be seen by a wide audience.

Right beside vendors selling rosaries, crucifixes, candles, and bottles of holy water, there are stalls hawking pamparegla and other herbal concoctions said to “regulate” missed periods. The juxtaposition is striking. Sacred and taboo, salvation and cycle, side by side like it’s the most natural thing in the world. It’s absurd, hilarious, and deeply Filipino. I always find myself thinking, someone should write a story, play, or movie out of this contradiction. With Sunshine, it finally feels like someone did. Fearlessly and with heart.It’s not exactly about Quiapo, but it carries the same beautiful mess of contradictions. Faith and survival, morality and body, dream and disappointment. It dares to talk about reproductive health care in the Philippines without flinching, but it’s also about more than that. It’s about the right to choose. Not just over one’s body, but over one’s future. It’s about women tired of being told to wait, to settle, to stay silent. And finally daring to want more. What makes it powerful is its quiet grace. It doesn’t preach. It listens. To the unspoken shame carried by women. To the whispers exchanged in tricycle/jeepney rides and neighborhood clinics. To the dreams that keep getting deferred by the weight of economy, expectation, and morality. Sunshine is a film that sees women. Not as symbols or martyrs, but as people.Technically, it’s a marvel. The cinematography captures the real Manila. Not the sepia-toned or shadow-drenched “poverty porn” we’re so used to. No extra lighting or artificial grime smeared on walls for the sake of grittiness. No “designing poverty.” The production design feels lived in, never overworked. Every detail feels honest. If I have only one criticism, it's that the magical realism elements could have been woven in more seamlessly. But even that doesn’t take away from the film’s quiet power.Then there’s the acting. Maris Racal delivers the role of a lifetime. Raw, honest, and quietly devastating. Jennica Garcia, whenever she’s on screen, shines. Her presence is magnetic, and together, their chemistry feels lived-in and true.In every sense, Sunshine is a landmark film. It should be our Oscar submission for next year. And if there’s any justice, it should sweep every local award. It’s not just a movie. It’s a mirror. One we’ve long needed in a country as patriarchal and hypocritical as ours.

ajduyac,8,"Some films entertain you. Sunshine confronts you.When the credits rolled, no one moved. No one spoke. It was that rare kind of silence. Not awkward, but sacred. As if we had all just witnessed something painfully true and didn’t quite know what to do with ourselves.Because Sunshine isn’t just a movie. It’s a question. A confrontation. Directed with clarity and deep compassion by Direk Tonet Jadaone, Sunshine doesn’t soften its message or try to make it more palatable.. It’s brave. It’s loud in its honesty. It doesn’t ask for permission to be angry or tired or vulnerable. It simply is, and that’s why it hits the way it does. And yet, somehow, even with all its emotional weight, Direk Tonet’s signature humor still finds its way through. There are moments—unexpected but perfectly timed—when the entire cinema bursts into laughter. It’s sharp, it’s honest, and it never feels out of place. Maybe Direk Tonet makes us laugh because she knows we’ll cry eventually. Or maybe that’s just how we are as Filipinos, finding humor even in the heaviest moments, because sometimes, it’s the only way we know how to carry the pain.What makes this film even more powerful is how it gives voice to things we often overlook. As someone who isn’t a woman, I know I can’t fully grasp the weight of that experience. But this film opened a window for me. A clear, honest glimpse into a reality I will never live, but need to see. Much of that power comes from the performances. Maris Racal, as Sunshine, delivers the most vulnerable and grounded work of her career. Her pain is quiet, but it radiates. You feel it in the way she holds her breath between words, in the weight behind her gaze. Jennica Garcia, as her sister, is just as affecting. Her stillness, her softness, the way she listens. She becomes a reflection of what the film asks of us: to pause, to witness, to respond with care. There’s a moment near the end that stuck with me. Sunshine asks, “Gets mo na ba ako?”And while it’s said to the person in the room, it felt like she was looking straight through the screen, asking us, the viewers. And like that person beside her, I hope we all have the courage to say: Yes. We see you. We understand.Please, Direk Tonet, keep making films like this (inutusan pa nga).

farscribe,6,"Sunshine (2024) would be a perfect double feature with Eliza Hittman's Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) as they both tackle similar topics but with a stark difference in privilege and access.where the latter becomes a story of sisterhood and compassion, as two girls cross state lines to get access to healthcare, Sunshine offers no such respite to our eponymous protagonist.in here, what Sunshine wants is not even a matter of choice, it is something that she is forced to bear. all alone as her confidants succumb to the stigma of her dilemma, Sunshine takes to the streets of Manila in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy.the plot moves along while the audience is served scenes of what i believe to be one of the better cinematic depictions of modern Manila. the first few minutes almost feel like an entirely different film (one i would have particularly liked more) until the plot takes a peculiar detour.in all of its realism and poignancy i found a particular element in its storytelling very out of place and oftentimes distracting. while the ending made me understand why those choices were made i just don't think a semblance of Magical Realism is the perfect vehicle for a message as heavy as this one.while i think the point that: ""an entire generation of Filipino women being forced to reckon with their unborn children as if the choice of abortion is something that has to be explained, and in turn, be understood."" is a step in the right direction for this nation's pro-choice discourse, the delivery just felt like it was bordering into Diary of an Unborn Child territory. with that being said, i still thoroughly enjoyed Sunshine and i would still highly recommend it. despite some of my grievances with the film, the unblemished ray of sunshine known as Maris Racal delivers a stellar performance in the titular role. perhaps even a mariesteller one. *wink* *wink*",2025-07-24,3,0,watch,False

zarvindale,6,"This is my first film in FOUR months?! It’s horrible for my cinephile ass out here…This is the Happening of Filipino cinema, except it’s less thrilling and more aligned with the traditional storytelling of Filipino drama.Perhaps my favorite element of this new project from Antoinette Jadaone is the contrast between morality and sin as personified by the hawker who sells abortion pills behind figures of saints beside Quiapo Church, which is arguably the most popular place of veneration among Catholic Filipinos throughout the country.Beyond that, I’m struggling to seek nuance and proper closure. What sets this work, aside from the palpable gentleness toward the female main character, apart from the many stories about abortion out there?It’s worth noting, however, that stories about women are told by women, just like what Jadaone manages to deliver here. I believe (cis) male filmmakers, no matter how genuine their intent is, cannot tell stories about women because women’s danas, the distinct Filipino word for experience, is not men’s danas.[Watched at SM Mall of Asia Cinema 1]",2025-07-24,4,0,watch,False

pm1spicy,10,"Sunshine is going to be an eye-opener for a lot of people here in the Philippines. It doesn't just raise awareness, it confronts the daily injustices Filipino women face just for being women. This should kickstart long-overdue conversations about reproductive rights, no matter how uncomfortable they may be.Maris Racal gives a career-defining performance as Sunshine. She fully captures the vulnerability, resilience, and quiet strength of her character. She feels heartbreakingly real. The supporting cast also pulls its weight, with Jennica Garcia standing out in a big way.What I really appreciated is how the film frames everything through the lens of a deeply Catholic country. The Sto. Niño statues being sold next to illegal abortion pills and the Christmas lights in the maternity ward stick with you. They are not just background details, they feel like commentary. Birth and suffering are made sacred here, even when they come with pain, even when they are not wanted.Sometimes it feels like the film is about to lean into pro-life messaging, with ""what if"" hypotheticals and future-president guilt trips. But instead of reinforcing those ideas, it pulls them apart. I didn't expect it to handle such a taboo subject with this much care. Subtlety is completely thrown out the window at times, with some characters written like Facebook comment sections come to life. They are loud, caricature-like, and clearly meant to provoke. But the sad truth is that people like that exist.Without getting into spoilers, the film isn’t trying to decide what’s right or wrong. It’s more interested in what it means to be understood.Heavy-handed? Sometimes. Necessary? Absolutely.So with that, we thank God for Sunshine.",2025-07-24,3,0,watch,True

cinegela,9,"My experience with this film didn’t end when the credits started rolling. Walking out of the cinema and into the crowded floors of a large mall, I began to watch people with a weighted heart. The children playing. The mothers of different ages. It left me reeling and in silence for quite a bit, to the point I felt a little sorry to the company I watched the film with. That was the moment I knew this film would leave an impact for a lot of people, and could even be divisive among most of its Filipino audiences.Sunshine leaves a mark. A film that paints a very real, raw, uncomfortable, and deeply moving picture on what it is like to be a Filipino woman with a dream, a mistake, and an agency that is being challenged by those around her—even by herself. It does this through depicting scenes all pointing towards the state of reproductive healthcare in the Philippines, and all those who are affected by it.Its characters are what makes the film so moving. Of course, Maris Racal does a stunning job portraying Sunshine and the character’s emotional complexity. Every character, though, has a purpose and reflects Filipino realities accurately. Perhaps the most special characters are what the film uses as a device to move the story along. At first, I felt unsure of it, but by the end of the film, it was very effective.This is a type of story that I feel, and hope, most Filipinos get to see. It is highly relevant as much as it is good. The narrative, linear structure of the film lends to the experience of the casual spectator; it builds up and comes crashing down.

aldrinosawr,9,"For a couple of years, I've lived and roamed in the kind of Manila Tonet has painted for us: busy and dirty streets of Recto and Carriedo overflowing with people trying to make ends meet, the filthy motels of Avenida filled with horny, exploitative men who need them, and the whispering neighborhood all around the tight grid-like system such as Tondo, Blumentritt, San Lazaro, Laon-Laan or Dapitan watching, staring, looking for something to make time pass.Under the watchful eyes of this condemnatory city stands a rather bright-eyed Sunshine, a young female student-gymnast trying to secure her spot in athletic competitions such as the Olympics and SEA Games. Her hard work and dedication have reflected in her routine, and her coach is confident in her skill in making it to the national team. But all of her dreams of soaring global recognition have been put to risk when one day, she discovers she is with child.What's heartbreaking about this piece is that this film is about a young woman working day and night fighting for a country who doesn't fight for her. This is a country where a woman needs to make unnecessarily drastic measures just to live a life she works hard on achieving. This is a country built on guilt and shame, yet a country proudly branded for its resilience. This is a country that veiled its dirt and its scum with the cloak of catholic morals and self-righteousness. This is no place for a sun to shine on.It's easy for me to believe in this film, because it is a true story. This is a biography, not of Sunshine and not of Tonet. This is a biography of Philippines in modern day, and for decades this has been told time and time again from the works of Lino Brocka, Ishmael Bernal, and Brillante Mendoza, to works of Kip Oebanda, Ramona Diaz, and now Antoinette Jadaone. For years filmmakers like them have hoped for a brighter future, hoped for people to open their eyes and unveil what is hidden in plain sight, and Tonet, in this incredible feat, making the movie ticket as cheap and as accessible as it can be, is reaching out to us saying ""This is my country. Look and see.""",2025-07-24,2,0,watch,True
lizzycapellan,10,"The moment Sunshine opened, I felt like I was already there in her world. That’s one of the things I’ve always admired about Direk Tonet Jadaone: how she builds these quiet, lived-in spaces that don’t just exist for her characters, but completely pull you in. You don’t just watch the story unfold, you feel it with Sunshine.What stuck with me the most is the way the film builds this deeply uncomfortable paradox: a country that loudly declares abortion is murder, yet leaves no room for safe options, quietly allowing dangerous pills to be sold under the table. The contradiction isn’t even subtle, it’s the whole point. Being a Filipino is already hard, but being a woman in the Philippines? It's brutal. The film doesn’t sugarcoat anything, it throws you straight into the brokenness of it all, from healthcare to shame culture to just… surviving.As the story unfolds, you’re taken on this intense ride with Sunshine, a girl trying to make sense of what she’s going through while the world around her offers no real answers. It forces you to confront your own biases. You start to ask yourself: what would I do in her place? What’s the “right” choice, really, when you’re trapped in a society that only ever gives you wrong ones?Menggay’s story hit like a gut punch. It’s the kind of pain that’s so real, but we never talk about because we’re scared to. Menggay isn't just another casualty, at the end of it all -- she's still a kid.What I love most about the storytelling is that it doesn’t preach. It makes you think, it makes you question -- but in the end, it reminds you that it should all boil down to what Sunshine feels is right. What she knows is best. It gives her that agency, that voice, something this world so often tries to take from girls like her.I've always been a fan of Maris Racal, and I agree that this is her best project yet. She didn’t need to go big; her silence already said everything. And I loved how the film used gymnastics as this quiet metaphor of control, performance, and discipline all while her personal life spirals into uncertainty. It’s so smart.And I have to say: the cinematography? Stunning. Of course, the gym scenes were beautifully shot, we all expected that - but it was the motel scenes that floored me. There was something about how those moments were framed that just hit harder. Like everything was raw, exposed, still. And what really stayed with me, long after the credits rolled, was this one feeling: at the end of it all, our dreams, they’re always for the younger versions of ourselves. We fight, we keep going, because we hope they’d understand. That if we ever had to explain why we chose what we chose, they’d look at us and say, “gets kita.”But the question that lingers is: are we, is this world ready for a story as brave as Sunshine?",2025-07-23,0,0,watch,True

The film had a timely subject, sincere writing, and phenomenal acting - Maris Racal was stellar, while Jennica Garcia delivered with quiet power. But I struggled with certain elements, particularly its attempt at magical realism. The presence of the imaginary child felt clunky, tonally jarring, and out of sync with the otherwise grounded narrative. Frankly, the character felt unnecessary - the film had already evolved past the need for her. The story had power, and I wish it had trusted its own strength without the added flourish.

thefilmbruuh,10,"In a deep personal level, saying that I like this film is an understatement. This is a well crafted story that follows a gymnast enroute of becoming an Olympian. Antoinette Jadaone is really clever in tackling a stigma with boldness and sensitivity at the same time. I really appreciate that the movie also depicts the reality and scenarios of living in Manila on a daily basis. I also appreciate the shots where the busy streets of Manila is in the backdrop. This may be an overstatement but Lino Brocka will be proud. I do not want to compare but when I was watching this movie, I remembered the late Gil Portes' classic High School Scandal starring Gina Alajar and Sandy Andolong. Its a proof that we need movies like this to be informed and educated.Maris Racal, the entire heart of the movie, humbly carried the story in her back - a teenager who got pregnant in a very religious and conservative country. This is her best one yet - humble, raw and precise. The supporting cast are great, too. Jennica Garcia's eyes are really captivating on those crucial moments. And Anika? Bruuuh, we really need to watch for that little one in the years to come.One of the best Filipino films in recent memory, Sunshine is bold, thought-provoking and relevant.

zawtch,10,"Play ""Perpektong Tao"" by Maris Racal.Oh Diyos ko po, mapapatawad N’yo pa ba ako!!!I walked into the cinema with so much expectation—and Sunshine delivered more than my expectations. This is a landmark film. A humanizing, soul-stirring, and bold piece of cinema that dares to speak truth in a country that often prefers silence and compliance.In a nation as conservative and deeply religious as the Philippines, Sunshine dives headfirst into the conversations we often whisper about, especially around the elderly and religious individuals—abortion, reproductive health, sexual abuse (WITHIN the family), and the religious hypocrisy that surrounds them. One of the most powerful moments for me was when she prays to God in the middle of an abortion attempt: “Lord, tanggalin Mo lang ’to, babawi ako sa lahat-lahat.” That line alone—honest and devastating—is a statement that cuts deep into the Filipino moral paradox.Napakagaling. Maris Racal carried this film on her own, brilliantly. No awkward or cringey moments—just pure, intentional acting that hits you right in the gut. This is easily her most brilliant and mature performance to date, and I am hungry for more.Also, just to share my theory: I don’t think the kids she sees represent a “mother figure” version of herself. To me, they were the babies’ little angels, quietly watching over their mothers, protecting them, forgiving them.I laughed, I wept, I cursed out loud inside the cinema. PUTANGINANG PILIPINAS TO. We need to see this. Sunshine deserves every bit of international acclaim it’s been getting—and more. And most of all: the Philippines is ready. Filipinos are ready for this conversation, for this kind of truth-telling, for this kind of art. More than a film, it’s also a wake-up call.

jiannemsoriano,8,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is a powerful and unflinching examination of the ongoing issue of teenage pregnancy in the Philippines, anchored by a stunning breakout performance from Maris Racal. The film transcends a simple narrative, offering a poignant and necessary critique of a society grappling with deeply entrenched religious and political views that often leave young women isolated and without agency. Through its raw and unapologetic storytelling, Sunshine doesn’t just present a problem. It takes a stand and demands that we, the viewers, confront it alongside its protagonist.Where the film truly excels is in its unflinching depiction of the societal and systemic failures that trap young women like Sunshine. The Philippines has the second-highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Southeast Asia, and a 2023 survey by Save the Children Philippines revealed that more than 500 adolescents become mothers each day, some as young as ten years old. Sunshine masterfully illustrates the intense personal isolation behind these numbers by using the accessible medium of sports. Read my full review here.",2025-07-09,0,0,watch,True

zaccheus,10,"I have a love-hate relationship with the Philippines.My country has it all, a strong historical background and culture, beautiful agricultural sights. The Philippines shines in so many ways. This country is easy to love, but it’s also easy to hate. On the other side of the spectrum, the Philippines is plagued with corruption, deeply oppressive religious standards, and many more hateful traditions and mindsets that continue to affect the Filipino people. The bare minimum is oftentimes glorified as the best that society could do for itself in the Philippines, but is to settle for less to settle for enough? This is the question that Sunshine raises. In a country that struggles to stand for its women, Sunshine did what many movies could not, it fearlessly depicted what was real and happening in our country. It showed the pure, unfiltered realities of a young, adolescent woman facing an unwanted pregnancy. The film doesn’t hold back. From the infamous ‘motel scene’ to the different women we follow in the film, direk Antoinette Jadaone fearlessly portrays the dangers a woman has to go through just to gain autonomy over their body, hopes, and dreams.Upon a second watch (this time with my mom and my cousin), I noticed something about the way Sunshine (Maris Racal) progresses in the film. She starts off as quiet. When she finds out she is pregnant, she only tells her boyfriend and her best friend. When she’s worried or angry, she conceals her emotions. She is held back. She is chained. As the film progresses, she slowly finds her footing, first through the infamous ‘basag windshield’ scene, and then through the numerous situations she finds herself stuck in. There is a scene near the end of the film. Sunshine is practicing her routine. She is emotional, and she’s made up her mind. As she ends her routine, the ribbon falls around her body, chaining her. She has a heartfelt conversation with ‘bata’ and she breaks free from her chains, which directly leads to the ending. Nothing is holding her back, she won’t settle for less, she has had enough.There is a scene in the film between Thea (Xyriel Manabat) and Sunshine. They are at a school canteen, eating separately from each other, but through their eyes, through the way they are looking at each other, you know that they are in support of one another. In a country that fails its women, they are forced to support each other in silence.Listening to my mom’s thoughts and reaction to Sunshine was the best part of my experience with this film. A woman who is somewhat religious, understanding why someone would want an abortion. An emphatic moment between my mom, me, and all the Sunshines in our country. The irony of watching a film entitled Sunshine during tag-ulan season is an irony that’s hard to look past, but I think this film couldn’t have come at a better time. We are settling for less. The streets are flooding, and the women in our country struggle to find the healthcare they deserve. We are chained and we are held back. When will we break free? When will we have enough?

The supporting characters did what they were meant to - help tell her story without stealing the spotlight.What stood out to me visually was how natural everything felt. The cinematography wasn’t overly stylized, but it matched the tone and mood perfectly. Set against the harsh backdrop of Manila, the film captured that mix of grit, morality, and religion in a way that felt all too real. It opens up an important conversation about sex education, teenage pregnancy, and abortion - topics we often shy away from, but ones that need to be talked about.More than anything, Sunshine shows how hard it is to be a woman in a world that’s stuck and unforgiving. It doesn’t scream its message, but it stays with you.

macjohnearl,5,"We are in a limbo. So much of Philippine cinema, especially that which makes the rounds in local and international film festivals, is stuck churning out “groundbreaking” firsts. Because our cultural discourse is so behind, our filmmakers are tasked not only with telling stories, but also with inventing the stories to be told. They’re required to stake out new thematic ground, not in service of aesthetic evolution, but simply to keep up with the global conversation. The cost of this is a cinema that often feels overburdened with didactic intent and undernourished in emotional and formal rigor.In a particularly polarizing gesture, Jadaone introduces a hallucinated child character, a device that indirectly echoes Jojo Rabbit (2019). But this choice results in jarring tonal shifts that muddle the film’s emotional center. What was perhaps intended as farce to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour. It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility. In fact, by personifying an unborn child as a character which speaks and thinks, then Sunshine unintentionally reinforces the very moral framing that anti-abortion rhetoric thrives on. It circles back into the age-old “when does life begin?” debate—a question that continues to paralyze policymaking in the country, even when the conversation should be about autonomy, access, and proper healthcare. The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, literalizes it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics. What’s more revealing than the film itself is the discourse surrounding it: a ubiquity of gender-essentialist and bioessentialist defenses, as if any critique of any form is automatically a threat to representation. That instinct: to guard a film’s cause rather than evaluate its craft just proves how far behind we are as a nation in talking about gender politics in filmmaking. The refusal to embrace genuinely revolutionary tactics, whether in politics or art, has kept us coasting on the optics of progress ever since.Full review for the Kinoise Substack published here",2025-07-24,57,2,watch,False

vincentio,9,"Sunshine is the product of the environment that failed her. It's an excellent movie that's blatantly shows how women are being boxed with limited rights and decisions in their lives with her being a young gymnast who is forced to weigh her personal dreams against societal expectations. What makes the film compelling is how honest and raw it is which made it difficult and easy to digest at the same time. It's difficult to digest since the film doesn't sugarcoat nor romanticize, it confronts. It slaps us with the reality that our system is really crooked when it comes to having the options such as abortion which draws you into Sunshine’s emotional turmoil. It's also easy to sort out as well as the film itself utilized a lot of symbolism and metaphor that's very comprehensible to the young audience since it was depicted in way of being simple and straightforward.This is the kind of film that should have been made long ago. Its themes were not only relevant, but urgent not only within the country but the world. Sunshine deserves to be shown in schools, especially for young women who are still learning to navigate their autonomy and choices in a culture that often denies them both.All I can say is that Sunshine is not just a film, it's a conversation starter, a one we desperately need.P.

And for a 19-year-old girl simply wanted to chase her dream, who are we to shame her for the choices she takes pride in?The film is heavy, filled with thrilling sequences and beautiful picturesque cinema that adds an insightful edge to its narrative. It doesn't shy away from the realities of living in Manila, where everything is muddy, dreary, and dried in irony.

ziaracarmelli,10,"In a country where a uterus can feel like a prison, Sunshine breaks through the silence with a scream.This is not just a film—it’s a rebellion against a system that punishes Filipinas for daring to survive.What a fearless and necessary filmz Sunshine dares to confront a brutal reality in a country where abortion remains illegal and where women’s rights are often reduced to whispers—silenced by false morality and systemic neglect.Antoinette Jadaone’s storytelling isn’t just intimate; it is a searing indictment of how the state and even the healthcare system fail Filipinas. This film reminds us that every choice a woman makes is shaped by power structures that shame her, control her body, and turn compassion into judgment. Through Sunshine’s journey, we see how being a woman in the Philippines means living in a constant struggle for autonomy—ang hirap maging babae, pero mas triple ang hirap ng mga babae dito sa Pilipinas.Sunshine is not just a movie; it is a mirror held up to a society that polices women’s bodies while abandoning them in their most vulnerable moments. It’s a rallying cry for the Sunshines, Theas, Helenas, Geleens, and Edens of this country—voices we must hear, stories we must protect.May this film be the turning point for our generation: progressive, pro-women, and unapologetically pro-choice.Thank you to the entire Sunshine team and SM Cinemas for making this powerful narrative accessible by lowering ticket prices.

cjshua,9,"Maris Racal is astonishing as she gives a star-making performance in Antoinette Jadaone's finest film yet. Sunshine takes us by the hand in a bustling Quiapo that's full of hypocrisy, contradiction, and a brutal system on women and their bodies. It's a random odyssey of a woman trying to take back what is her's in an unforgiving conservative society. In the film's opening moments, we see an ambitious athlete confused and paralyzed with the news of her untimely pregnancy. She's scared and she's prolonging the agony of confronting the inevitable. One thing that some people may ask is, why doesn't she immediately ask anyone for help? Doesn't she have a family? Why is she trying to deal with such a serious problem on her own? Is this the society that we've grown into? Where a young woman is so afraid and paralyzed to get any help that she risks her life trying to deal with it on her own? The answer is a resounding YES. We are living in a country where dominant beliefs and religion are shoved down in women's throats even if it means giving up their dreams. Where young women are scorned and defined by their mistakes instead of being educated and getting a strong support system. Most egregiously, we live in a society that stigmatizes and punishes women but tolerates the very system, and actions that led to their unwanted pregnancies. That is the society that Jadaone perfectly paints in this harrowing film. Jadaone uses Quiapo as the backdrop to tell this story as she blends elements of neorealism and magic realism. This film has a great sense of place as Sunshine roams around a Quiapo that hides hypocrisy underneath its Catholic cathedral. Jadaone goes full Brocka mode through these scenes as she showcases different communities and people through a neorealist lens. That's why I found the film's surrealist tendencies to be a little bit jarring. Sunshine encounters a kid that appears only through her consciousness and it really makes you wonder if this type of storytelling fits the themes that Jadaone is exploring. It just runs the risk of making it too melodramatic and undercutting its authenticity. But what keeps it from going off the rails is her unwavering compassion and understanding of Sunshine's plight. Direk Tonet did mention in the Q&A session after that she swore that she was gonna hold Sunshine's hands and be by her side through every turbulence she'll face while writing this movie. In the film's third act, the neorealist and magic realist narratives just blend into a powerful, poignant, and profound moment while Sunshine practices her routine one last time. I think this is a film that our country desperately needs right now. It's bound to spark debates and fruitful discussions about abortion, reproductive health, and women's right. Some may disagree with what Sunshine ended up doing, but at least this is a film that ignites a discussion for these taboo topics. I will never know how it feels to be a woman in an unfairly conservative country. But this film rings with so much vitality, bravery, and honesty that I just cried by the end of it. This is so damn close to being a masterpiece. Gets ko na!",2025-07-23,1,0,watch,True

alonzojuwan,,"Maybe most ingenious about Sunshine is its willingness to accept the decision to abort likely also involves a negotiation with the unborn child, maybe even a plea for forgiveness—less from God, because getting that would be easy, and in fact Sunshine gets it out of the way early on, but more from who the child would have been. For the film indeed that is the longer battle, and it affords Sunshine a long array of events that could make the explaining easier. She sees her dilemma reflected in the city's decay, her choice—which she readily makes—put into perspective, rounded out, by another girl's inaccess to that choice. Very carefully, and backed by research, Jadaone dissects what that choice may mean for women like Sunshine in a developing city like Manila, where dreams are scarce and their fulfillment even rarer. Sunshine's choice is an act of self-determination, in a world where that's seen as vulgar, irreverent: that is clear. But to what should reverence be owed, in any case? Sunshine argues it's simply a matter of priority. When Sunshine chooses her dream—which she's been carrying in her womb longer than she's known her unborn child's ghost—we empathize with her, as does the ghost. That shows the film’s executed its heavy work.",2025-07-25,36,1,watch,True

aragakky,,"a lot of things were going on in my mind after watching this. mimicking what my friends say about this, it is indeed an important movie which hopefully, can open the doors for discussing the decriminalization of abortion and better, making the state strive toward a world that would not need it in the first place. quoting from one of my eye-opening reads this year, which greatly sums up my thoughts about abortion:“…focusing solely on the ‘right’ to have an abortion obscured the many other determining factors around childbirth, child-rearing and family. It absolved the state of its responsibilities to create the support mechanisms for raising families. If the decision to have a child is simply a woman’s choice, the responsibility for the well-being of children is shifted onto mothers instead of the society in which children are raised.”feminism, interrupted: disrupting power by lola olufemiinterestingly, what struck me the most was the portrayal of manila and the people living in it. kaya kahit alam kong marumi, masikip, at mausok ang maynila, it feels alive and weirdly enough, i get comfort from it as it highlights how much of it stems from our collectivist culture.random pero napansin ko rin na whenever kids swear in this movie, medyo pilit at nagiging borderline darryl-yap-style of filmmaking for me lmao 😭 anyways dami kong ebas (na puro disconnected ideas) pero i feel like the movie needs a little more push and it would be harsh to confine it into a rating kasi importanteng movie siya so di ko na lang talaga lagyan hahahaha but overall it’s a nice watch. star-studded sha jshdhdjshs",2025-07-25,1,0,watch,False

ahbr,,"If there’s anything that is uniquely Filipino in terms of interior design, it’s the green walls. It generally evokes feelings of tranquility and harmony, but Jadaone’s latest film flips it around to signify chaos and dysfunction. The color is almost everywhere, it’s inescapable: the walls of the protagonist’s home, the sterile and hostile clinic spaces, even the motel where the film’s lead almost died, comparable to the grip Catholicism has on the Philippines. While they say there’s a separation between the church and the state, it’s barely upheld in practice, as they hinder human rights that could save thousands of lives. And yes, I am talking about abortion laws, or the lack thereof here in my country. Jadaone’s Sunshine addresses the huge elephant in the senate, as it depicts the life of its titular lead (Maris Racal), whose life is turned upside down due to a sudden news of her own pregnancy. It’s easy to blame women like Sunshine for getting pregnant. After all, she’s presented as a domineering figure in her sport, even bound to compete in the Olympics, and she technically practiced unsafe sex, but not every case of unwanted pregnancy is like that.There are multiple shots where Sunshine is physically separated by a fence-like barrier: be it the metal gates in the church, the ever-stretching horizontal jeepney rails, or the cold and black window frames, that subtly signal how Filipinas are imprisoned by their surroundings. Almost every gratingly infuriating, thought-provoking, and ludicrous dialogue circles back to one simple question: why is it that women are the ones penalized and restricted on matters that could jeopardize their own health and safety, especially in pregnancies caused by rape and incest?While watching, I was constantly reminded of a film with similar thematic points, that of Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, and how women need to be discreet, travel thousands of miles, and suffer in silence over matters that should be openly discussed and not considered taboo or immoral. If anything, I think this film is being highly censored in the Philippines, as the movie review board slapped an R-16 rating on a film that should be watched by teenagers. How can we avoid teenage pregnancies when our government avoids talking about practicing safe sex to the right demographic? Not everyone gets a happy conclusion like Sunshine did, so I hope that this film sparks a necessary conversation about women’s rights outside of the walls of movie theaters. Jadaone’s Sunshine is truly one of the Philippines’ best releases of the year so far, in both its themes and execution, and a must-watch for all types, especially men and the religious-alike.

But I wasn’t prepared for how deeply it would sit with me long after the credits rolled.I didn’t cry while watching the film, but once it ended, I found myself overwhelmed. The weight of Sunshine doesn’t hit all at once — it lingers, it settles. And it stays.At its core, Sunshine is the story of a woman taking control of her body in a society that keeps telling her she isn’t allowed to. It’s not simply about one choice, one moment, or one woman. It’s about the collective experience of many Filipinas who navigate a system that consistently fails to hear them.Antoinette Jadaone’s direction doesn’t shy away from discomfort. She faces it head-on, inviting the audience to confront the silences we’ve learned to live with - about abortion, reproductive rights, the stigma around sexuality, and the lack of access to informed sex education in the Philippines.Sunshine is timely, urgent, and painfully real. It gives voice to the cry of our generation, echoing the need for progressive reforms that protect women and children. The film challenges its viewers not just to empathize, but to act.As a viewer, I left the cinema not only moved, but also awakened. Sunshine isn’t here to entertain. It’s here to disturb, to provoke, and to push us into uncomfortable yet necessary conversations.To my fellow Filipinos: let’s not turn away. Let’s create spaces where women can speak freely, where choices about their bodies are met with compassion, not judgment. Let’s demand that our lawmakers stop treating reproductive health as taboo.To filmmakers and storytellers: keep telling these stories. We need more films like Sunshine—bold, unapologetic, and grounded in truth. The personal is political, and cinema has the power to move both heart and policy.Let Sunshine be a beginning.

I’ve always found the word “ate” to be a strong signifier of the tight the bonds between Filipina women. We may not know each other, but we know that we carry similar burdens. Call a woman ate and their heads turn with instinct. The film does not only show you the grim, unrelenting, cruel Manila that takes (and claws) more than it gives. Nor does it exclusively show you the girlhood that was stolen from you by the capitalistic and patriarchal structures so deeply embedded in society.Yes, it shows you that. It does not hold back from showing you how tiresome it is to clean the poo of a newborn or how much more easy it is to find empathy in illegal markets than it is in public institutions. Yet, what it also shows you is that whenever you feel like a lone speck of light in the dark, just call an ate. Ask them for help. Rest on their shoulders. You are all each of you has. The film itself does its job of telling an important story beautifully. One of the key narrative devices may be a bit too on the nose for some viewers, but I find that it adds a sort of tangibility and gravity to the story that otherwise would have been missing some heart and soul without it. Tonet’s directing is sharp and focused on such visceral and visual contradictions. Racal is bursting with passion and rage…vulnerable…and stellar. Everyone from her coach and older sister down to the younger kids our titular character meets held so much weight in their portrayals. Noong pinapanood ko, ang nasa isip ko, tunay na tao ‘tong mga pinapanood ko. Walang Sunshine sa mundong patas. Ngunit, hindi patas ang mundo natin.

At sa mga pelikula ni Direk @tonetjadaone, ramdam na ramdam ko 'yan!I’ve recently been staying in Manila for a few months now. I've walked through Quiapo and the surrounding areas, felt the pulse of the city, and Sunshine just nailed it – physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Ang gulo mo, Manila, pero grabe ang vibrancy mo! Para akong nasa loob mismo ng pelikula, bawat sulok, bawat ingay, bawat damdamin, kumakapit.Gano'n din ang naramdaman ko sa That Thing Called Tadhana.

There's something so raw and real in how Direk Jadaone captures the essence of these places and the human emotions within them. It's more than just a story; it's an experience.I watched Sunshine on the same day as Fantastic Four, and while I enjoyed both, there's no question for me: this movie, Sunshine, should be watched in cinemas, as a community. It's a communal experience, something that sparks conversations and shared emotions. 'Yung Fantastic Four, pwede na 'yan sa Disney Plus kung tight ang budget. But Sunshine? It deserves the big screen, the collective gasps, and the shared tears.I genuinely hope this movie reaches everyone's radar. SANA MA GETS NYO NA RIN.

hellopaolo,9,"Bakit? Nanay ba kita? Gut-wrenching and brave, Sunshine speaks truth with honesty and feminine rage in a heartbreaking story of womanhood, a character study that puts a young woman, an aspiring Olympian in the most harrowing ordeal — pursue her dreams or let go of it, continue her pregnancy or terminate it. In a country where traditions and conservatism plague our sociopolitical landscape, and at a time where the world at large is being corrupted by right-wing fundamentalists, Sunshine stands with a strong pro-choice message; that women should have the rights to bodily autonomy despite the patriarchal structures that harp on religious preachings in which our women have to pay social costs or worse, their own lives and safety. At the center of it is Sunshine, played by the brilliant Maris Racal whose tenacious yet delicate character work put so much layers to a heartfelt protagonist. In the first 10 minutes alone, Racal delivered a string of unbridled emotions, from being flushed with regret, anger and desperation, she grew with intensity, defiance and vulnerability. Her resolve is one of strength and a moving emotional core that’s unshakeable while being present in every turn in Sunshine’s dilemma in which we met the most colorful and textured cast of unusual characters. Even with Racal’s stellar lead performance, every supporting actor also put on a remarkable stamp that not only served their scenes but also the entire story. From Jennica Garcia to Annika Co to Elijah Canlas to Meryl Soriano to Xyriel Manabat to Angeli Bayani to Rhed Bustamante to Piolo Pascual, it’s perfectly casted and Jadaone made sure that they deliver a well-calibrated turn for Sunshine’s story. A chilling and entrancing dissection of womanhood, the film shifts gears as a sports movie to a melodrama injected with some satire, absurdity, and a mystical element, it’s full of inspired creative choices that are in full concerto. With its spectacular cinematography and production design from drab and somber interiors with a hint of natural light or sometimes depressing fluorescent light, to neon-tinged urban areas where chaos lingers just around the corner while also capturing Sunshine’s extraordinary close-ups behind window railings that cage her or framed by her vibrant pink ribbon; its outstanding sound design that puts Sunshine’s inner turmoil at the center of a noisy Manila and blends a surrealist element to its heart; and a formidable original music that juxtaposes Sunshine’s personality from her life as an gymnast to her personal life. Sunshine is an urgent film that needs to be seen and heard, there’s power in its universality and Tonet Jadaone’s feminist voice soars with an elevated storytelling. Beaming with Filipino sensibilities and humour, its melodrama is used with beautiful intent while being grounded and playing with raw emotional reactions from the cast, and levity and grit in its screenplay. And as cliche as it sounds, it’s a totally different Jadaone that made this movie. There’s maturity that put her titular character at the center of a well-crafted film but there’s this restraint we haven’t seen before that refined the story’s message without ever being didactic. Undoubtedly, her best film yet, an opus that cements her place as an important voice in Philippine cinema but also a landmark film that tackles subject matters that only a handful of Filipino filmmakers have touched on. An absolute achievement in today’s climate of Filipino cinema, there’s power in its tone and its themes — a protest that exposes controlling hypocritical men and medical professionals, and an interrogation of a systemic inequality full of government’s shortcomings in giving proper care and support for unwanted pregnancies, in a place where poverty and overpopulation have been a decade-long problem. But also in Sunshine, we found hope and her light in confronting her reality while finding women who helped and listened to her, a kind of feminism that celebrates sisterhood even in the most horrifying circumstance in a woman’s life. With high hopes, this should spark a conversation about women’s struggles and rights. In light of the overturning of Roe v Wade in the US, akin to Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Sunshine’s story is real and rampant in the PH, and as disturbing as it sounds, unsafe abortion have been killing 1 in 3 Filipinas each day. —————This reminded me of a podcast conversation I once listened to about a woman talking to her mother at a time she’s getting to know her more as an adult. She’s learning about her mom’s history and asked her if her mother ever wondered about living that life instead of having her. Of course the mother responded that she’s happy that she’s born and she’s her child. To which she replied with, “if I didn’t happen, YOU would have been born.”I think motherhood is beautiful but do you ever wonder what kind of woman your mother would have been if society gave them the rights to choose or their religion didn’t make them to aspire to fit into a mold of a woman? Maybe she could have been a president or she could have invented the cure to HIV/AIDS? Who knows?",2025-07-26,5,0,watch,True

mikevandych,,"Too often, films about abortion fall into the trap of emotional manipulation, when they push a specific agenda, reducing a complex issue to a simplistic, black-and-white narrative. But Sunshine rises above that pattern.Instead, the film offers a nuanced portrayal of the struggles (and even rage) experienced by women who are denied access to reproductive healthcare - told with such compassion and delicacy that you cannot help but empathize with and root for Sunshine because the conservative society has failed her. I hope many people get to watch the film because it is both a deeply personal and universal story that casts a light on one of the most pressing crises in the country: teenage pregnancy. And I also hope Sunshine ushers in a healthy and open conversation because women deserve the right to make decisions for themselves.

atomicdeadspace,9,"Direk Tonet Jadaone holds a mirror up in the middle of Quiapo and asks the question: what is the proper protocol to take control of your life? Does the prayer come before or after the abortifacient? Does the boyfriend have to take it too? Sunshine, as a film and as a character, is bold and unwavering. She doesn't preach or ask for pity. She doesn't beg for the forgiveness of her boyfriend or the religious. The story is clear all through out -- Sunshine has made her decision, and while she seeks understanding, she seeks it only from those who matter, not from the audience and definitely not from the holier-than-thou.While Sunshine embarks on her journey to find answers, we never forget what she is -- a young girl in the Philippines, left to deal with the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy alone. It is so easy to put the blame on women or on impulsive, lustful teenagers, but the film reminds us that in a country where religious biases trump teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality rates, pointing fingers helps no one. The film reminds us that for women and other marginalized sectors, the first line of defense against systemic neglect is community.Brave and unfiltered, I can easily see Sunshine becoming a Filipino classic.

tristanmdv,10,"Heavy raindrops were like meteorites landing on the pockmarked pavements of Manila when we braved two storms to catch the screening of Sunshine. Our tuktuk carried only three passengers: me, my partner, and another man—seven people short of the usual full ride as it had been a week of rain with flooding which meant classes and government work were cancelled. When it rained harder, our driver couldn’t help but mutter Tama na. Gutom na kami.It’s hunger borne out of poverty that limits, if not entirely removes, the access of ordinary Filipinos to watch important films such as Sunshine. Like any other works of art attempting to feature parts and parcels of Philippine society, etched on its tapestry is the signature Manila mayhem: masikip, mabaho, maingay and magulo.But the structure of the film is far from chaotic despite the complicated and challenging subject Direk Antoinette Jadaone took upon herself to flesh out. The stakes were high and indeed pushed the protagonist to do what she thought needs to be done. Her point was clear and warranted no further elaboration. Maris Racal was stellar in her portrayal of an aspiring Olympian who got pregnant at the blossoming of her career as a young athlete. The same can be said about the equally astounding young actress Annika Co who was a perfect foil to Racal’s character.The film, with its shorter than usual run time of barely an hour and a half minutes, didn’t hold back in driving its message, leaving nothing open for interpretation. Towards the end where Sunshine was performing her routine, I thought for a moment that her beaming towards the camera with her majestic ribbon would be the final shot of the film. But when the young Annika was shown watching Sunshine finish gracefully finishing her performance and embracing her when it ended, that was when I realized, gets ko na, that in this narrative, she would have a choice, one that's entirely her own.Direk Tonet has managed to make such a compact film about choice. While choice for women is such a privilege in a conservative country like ours, there’s something powerful in showing that Sunshine made a choice, one that goes against the conventional. While other films of the same topic would leave it to the audience to ponder whether or not the protagonist would choose the controversial choice, Sunshine showed us that yes, she did that!After the end credits have rolled, we were left staring at the black screen, perhaps, feeling fulfilled, weighed upon, or hungrier than ever for films of the same caliber. Sunshine is so monumental for Philippine cinema that it reaffirms one of my aspirations, that one day, Filipinos can have the choice about what films to watch in the cinema every weekend, not choose just either one—satisfying their physiological hunger or fulfilling the hunger of the soul.",2025-07-25,2,0,watch,False

kyusigodz,10,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine begins with control. With poise, with the perfect arabesque, and with the precision of a gymnast that is ready for the next move. But as the film moves along, the tension in the stillness builds up and begins to show. Behind the clean flow and rhythm of theribbon, the rehearsed elegance of the body is still pushed to their limit. Sunshine feels like a cruel misdirection, but the contrast is exactly the point that womanhood needs.In a country where abortion is still illegal without exceptions, Sunshine doesn’t just tell the story of a young woman’s crisis. It captures a quiet violence of expectation, the pressure to remain graceful even when they are under a system that does not allow women to fail, to choose, or even to speak freely. In the Philippines, the Revised Penal Code punishes abortion with imprisonment, while access to safe and legal procedures remains out of reach for most women, especially those who are young and unfortunate. Punishment because of abortion with imprisonment, and this legal stance is reinforced by deeply rooted religious conservatism. It is not just illegal—it is unthinkable. The stigma runs deep, and the silence surrounding it is even deeper.According to the Center for Reproductive Rights (2023), thousands of women are forced into this silence every year. Estimated around 1.1 million Filipino women induce abortion annually. About 1,000 of Filipinas die each year from abortion-related complications, and over 100,000are hospitalized due to unsafe procedures. These numbers are not just statistics, they are lives of the young, scared, and the unheard. Sunshine puts that reality front and center, but does so without shouting. It doesn’t force emotion, it lets it build naturally. This film follows Sunshine as she navigates through the aftermath of a missed period, a distracted boyfriend, and a society that offers no legal, safe, or accessible options. She’s left to carry the weight of a decision she didn’t choose, in a system that treats her body like public property.Sunshine (played by Maris Racal) is a kind character with stillness that feels like a resistance. Her performance is tight, contained, and filled with the kind of fear that is quiet and does not seek and beg for sympathy. A character with a facade that represents many generations of women where they mask all of their feelings and hold on to the thought that “this too shall pass”.She is not trying to explain herself, she is simply trying to breathe and move in a world that keeps on closing in. Racal does not rely on big breakdowns or dramatic lines. She holds her ground even when that ground is crumbling beneath her. Every look, every breath, feels calibrated. Like someone preparing for a landing they know they might not even survive. What makes the performance even more powerful is how familiar Sunshine feels. She is notwritten as an extraordinary character. She is a regular young woman, navigating school, relationships, and the uncertainty of early adulthood. She could be any girl from any province, any city, any university. That ordinariness is important. Because it reminds us that this story isnot rare. It is not fiction. It is the quiet, constant reality of so many young women in this country who are forced to navigate the consequences of a decision they didn’t even get to make.Jadaone doesn’t push for spectacle. The film sits with silence and discomfort. No overdramatization and overexplanation. Her braveness has a place in Philippine Cinema as this take and storytelling of hers about abortion in a world where systems and institutions are fallingshort, the quiet resistance of Sunshine speaks volume. Instead of turning the film into a message movie, Jadaone chooses to linger. She doesn’t try to solve anything. She doesn’t pretend that resolution is possible. And that’s what makes Sunshine hit even harder. The film doesn’t just show the problem, it lets us sit in it. It allows discomfort to stretch across the screen without rushing to ease it. That discomfort mirrors what many women feel in real life. The shame. The fear. The confusion. The silence that comes not from peace, but from pressure.It also explores the feelings through visuals. Pao Orendain, the Cinematographer of the film captures the feel of the City of Manila. How it is familiar inside the streets, but also how suffocating it is. The noise pollution that is made by the vehicles, the streets filled with conversations, and the trains rattling as it passes by. The way they captured it, Manila is just another place where it forces the characters to move carefully, just like any other people who lives, visits, and goes to Manila to reclaim life. The streets hum with life, but not always with warmth. The camera observes from a distance, never forcing perspective but always aware of the space Sunshine must navigate.What makes Sunshine stand out is that it never asks permission to tell this story. It does not frame abortion as a debate, or as an issue that needs to be justified. It centers the experience without apology. In doing so, it offers a kind of cinematic resistance that feels rare in Philippine cinema. Jadaone’s choice to tell this story without moralizing, without preaching, without forcing catharsis, gives it more weight than any dramatic scene ever could.And in a country that still debates whether women should have that right, Sunshine lands, not perfectly, but with all the force of someone who has had enough. Someone who knows she deserves more. And that is enough to shake the ground beneath her, even if no one else is watching. Like a gymnast mid-tumble, it shows how much strength it takes just to survive a fall.And sometimes, survival is the bravest routine of all.Gets na gets kita, Sunshine.",2025-07-24,1,0,watch,True
baltarle,,"This review features some spoilers.In local cinema, as with mainstream media, there’s a dearth of films tackling abortion. 12 Weeks, Anna Isabelle Matutina’s Cinemalaya feature debut, was the latest attempt I could recall, or at least one that had something useful to say. At the same time, a comprehensive sexuality education integrated at all education levels (separate from the education department’s sex ed order), as proposed in the anti-teenage pregnancy bill, has been under fire from the country’s conservative population.Into this frantic context emerges Sunshine, the latest indie darling from writer-director Antoinette Jadaone. The sole Philippine entry in the Centrepiece section of the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, the film finally comes home. It’s making its local premiere exclusively at SM cinemas, after touring the international film fest circuit to critical renown, including the Crystal Bear for Best Film at this year’s Berlin International Film Festival.But make no mistake, as the picture refuses to be singled out as an “abortion film,” a descriptor so sweeping and limiting that it is seen only vis-à-vis morality. Jadaone finds new ammo with which to make sense of the polarizing topic: gymnastics. (The film’s TIFF world premiere, in fact, came at the heels of gymnast Carlos Yulo’s double Olympic gold in Paris.)The sports drama unfolds through the title character, played by Maris Racal, a young gymnast whose preparation for national tryouts is upended after discovering she’s pregnant. Refusing to compromise her shot at Olympic glory, with her useless boyfriend (Elijah Canlas) almost instantly ditching her, Sunshine resorts to illegal abortifacients offered by Manila’s underbelly, where she runs into an enigmatic young girl (Annika Go) bent on tracking her every move and policing her every decision. Soon, she internalizes biblical shame.Sunshine follows Jadaone’s feminist inclinations. Her directorial debut Six Degrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay (2011), is a raw mockumentary that doubles as a compelling paean to the titular screen bit actress, whose name is nearly synonymous with Philippine horror but has largely remained underappreciated. In Never Not Love You (2018), Nadine Lustre’s Joanne is a breadwinner who trades a long-awaited job promotion in Manila for a fraught chance to begin anew and dream together with her privileged boyfriend in London, only to wrestle with the punishing economics of romance. Fan Girl (2020) explores the dark side of being a superfan through a female character who’s a proxy for the film’s articulation about the psychology of idle worship in a nation forever beholden to it.Shortcomings of these movies aside, Jadaone insists on narratives that do not treat and present the female gaze as though it’s self-explanatory. The director often edges toward gray areas and destabilizing standpoints, whether or not they wind up humorous, fascinating, schmaltzy, or troubling.Whereas Jadaone’s previous movies are attuned to the conventions of their respective genres, Sunshine offers something new to the director’s dramaturgical defaults. The film is an intersection of neorealism and magical realism. It trains the camera on Manila’s grime, decay, and nonstop noise, embracing its outcasts and harsh truths (the Lino Brocka comparisons are inevitable), just as it punctuates the gritty reality with a magical invocation via the imaginary friend that trails Sunshine.“Media literacy” would tell you that the spectral presence is a representation of the internal-external friction the heroine deals with; fetus in the flesh and the body that refuses to carry it; the back-and-forth between morality and pragmatism. (Jadaone, in an interview with Filmmaker Magazine, revealed she was inspired by the imaginary character in Taika Waititi’s 2019 satirical drama Jojo Rabbit.) But beyond this, the make-believe figure is a surrogate for the conservative, pro-life fraction of the audience, with the director opting to engage in the subject matter’s complexity instead of comfortably locating the film in an echo chamber. While the narrative device could prove as an apparent play at sympathy, indulging in a “will she, won’t she” kind of thinking (surface-level reading could also suggest that women seeking abortion are deluded, ridiculous as that implication might sound), it also offers access to the broader violence disguised as “conscience” that puts women, regardless of gender identities, at a disadvantage.If anything, Sunshine is less about the act of abortion itself than about the systems that encourage women to settle for dehumanizing rights already decided for them by a patriarchal few, systems that prohibit them from dreaming, and tell them that to dream only means more labor, nothing more.Sunshine, like Petersen Vargas’ Some Nights I Feel Like Walking (which made its Philippine premiere in June), harnesses the metropolis as a character of its own, instead of reducing it to a mere symbolic backdrop. Whereas Some Nights steeps its urban tale in neon erotica, completely absent of daylight, Sunshine shifts between the city’s diurnal and nocturnal environments.Pao Orendain’s camerawork here chiefly reaps magic from close-ups and interior shots, often framed from the window and dotted by a shaft of light (hence the Brocka sentiments), locating the viewer into the heroine’s intimate yet anxious state. The self-induced abortion scene in the sketchy motel, a sight casually interrupted by frantic railway noise, is particularly visceral that you can almost feel the texture of the image.The camera also draws focus to the irony that permeates Manila’s streets, particularly around the vicinity of Quiapo Church, where makeshift stalls selling figurines, scapulars, and all sorts of religious paraphernalia also offer abortion drugs and quack treatments, just as banners declaring “abortion is murder” remain a typical sighting. In other scenes where Sunshine traverses the cityscape, the visuals are more straightforward. Accompanying the images is a soundscape that immersively mirrors the congestion, exhaustion, and urban din that form part of the DNA of the country’s capital.Jadaone’s script nearly leans on the miserablist. When Sunshine finds an opportunity to pull herself out of the vexing situation, poverty immediately gets in the way, leaving her with no choice but to ask her boyfriend for a meager P5,000 to secure the abortion drug and a cheap motel room to perform the deed herself. Yet even in Manila’s hospitals, the conditions are dire; patients are forced to share beds, and hallways are turned into makeshift wards, crowded by people in need of attention beyond the medical. Rape and casual prostitution also get in the way, as in the case of Menggay (Rhed Bustamante), the pregnant 13-year-old Sunshine comes across in Quiapo.In a highlight moment, Sunshine, livid upon meeting her friend’s abuser, suddenly picks up a beer bottle and whacks it over the man’s head, before sprinting to escape the scene. (Curiously, Jadaone plumbs the politics of self-determination by contrasting Sunshine’s ability to decide for herself with Menggay’s distance from that very sense of agency.) Even the Quiapo vendors selling abortifacients, who some might think merely exploit the desperation of their customers, are also victims who simply don’t earn enough.Unflattering as these depictions are, it’s hard to deny that these aren’t routine realities in the social inferno that is the Philippines. Still, there is humor, whether in a scene that involves a knife interrupting a silly argument, or in another that sees a self-righteous doctor preaching the goodness of the divine.As Sunshine, Racal delivers a performance that would be a disservice to reduce to neat superlatives. It’s a physical portrayal that required the actor to undergo training with national gymnastics coaches for nearly a year. It’s a role that might put her in the center of another controversy after barely surviving the previous one. But just as Sunshine is asked to “drown out the noise” whenever she steps on the mat, Racal distills every layer and emotion into a character that’s simply life-like, almost free from the veil of performance-making. Jadaone once told me that her ideal lead performance is one that “is part of something bigger than herself.” There has not been a more worthy portrayal in local cinema this year.At the same time, the movie functions as a reintroduction to the boundless talent of Jennica Garcia, who plays Sunshine’s elder sister, a single mother trying to keep everything intact. Her portrayal expertly captures what a supporting performance should be—one that has enough screentime to be an emotional anchor for the lead but also generates her own moment. There’s a kind of invisible labor informing the character that Garcia encapsulates with an onscreen presence that always feels grounded and never incidental.Sunshine is hardly a social exposé. What ripples throughout this partly winding urban tale is a ready, fatal fact about the place of women in this eternally eroded nation that we’d rather dismiss as “controversial” or “divisive” because we refuse to listen. The film’s visuals might be artful, but they don’t always convey a pretty picture. It’s no coincidence that the movie’s narrative throughline is the community that Sunshine finds in the women around her: her elder sister, her best friend (Xyriel Manabat), despite her initial inhibitions, her coach (Meryll Soriano), the young Menggay, the compassionate doctor (Angeli Bayani), and even the imaginary friend. Though this sense of solidarity comes at varying degrees, it keeps Sunshine afloat and does not let her think of herself as a monster for terminating an unwanted pregnancy.Once Sunshine nears its final shot, I keep thinking of Fan Girl’s insular ending that succeeds its heroine’s already exhausting journey. I’m glad to learn that our heroine this time does not succumb to sheer epiphany. Here, hope actually feels like a tangible possibility instead of an unwarranted emotional wallop.Sunshine is perhaps not Jadaone’s most definitive work; That Thing Called Tadhana (2014) or Never Not Love You might claim that distinction. But it is her sharpest creation yet. It took a whole lot of research and lived experiences to put this story on the screen. It took a bit of time for the film to make its way back to where it started. It’s a miracle that it even got the go signal to be screened publicly. I can already sense all the hot takes and thinkpieces it will generate. And I can only hope that it will be as meaningful as this.This review appears on PhilSTAR Life in a slightly different version.",2025-07-24,11,0,watch,True

ukiyaseed,9,"Last year, I saw High School Scandal. Both films share the same throughline that Philippine health care sucks when it comes to pregnancy and sex education. High School Scandal was made in the 80s. The difference being is that Sunshine made me feel hopeful, while High School Scandal made me feel depressed.Here's the thing. Sunshine is a very heavy film, but what makes Sunshine such a heartlifting film to watch is that she had the proper support system whether she decides to keep the child or not. She gets to choose if she wants to carry the baby or not. She has a sister that cares about her well being, a best friend who will do everything for her, and strangely enough, a manifestation of what her child will be. The film shows that women should at the end of the day, have the final choice in matters related to childbirth.Oh and with heavy topic such as this, let women be the major voice in the storytelling. Maris Racal is a powerhouse actress. Antoinette Jadoane is a great writer and director and deserves all the praise in handling such a tough topic.",2025-07-26,2,0,watch,True

mobirebyu,8,"“Gets ko na.”In this film, we follow Sunshine, a rhythmic gymnast and an Olympic hopeful, as she travels through Manila’s dark, narrow, grimy, and crowded streets and alleys in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy in a country where abortion is illegal. There are few parts of this film that really stood out to me because they made elevated the movie and made it more compelling.The first part that I really liked is how the city became a living representation of this country’s oppressive stance against anything pro-abortion. The city allowed us to have something tangible, to be able to relate to Sunshine’s struggles even more. Second, the magical realism aspect is also a highlight for me. Once it finally clicked what Ariana and Annika Co’s characters represented, I was blown away. One common argument of those against abortion is that you are going to kill someone who’s probably gonna be a very important person. And yet, we get Annika Co’s character. Through a very powerful performance we end up caring for this kid. But once you start to realize who she us and who she represents, you start to realize that she’s not just an extension of Sunshine but a representative of all babies born to mothers forced to carry a child. She and these babies are vessels forced to carry the unfulfilled dreams of their mothers. She said something like, “Ang pangarap niya ay ang pangarap ko.” And that line broke me. The argument is always, “We are not fulfilling someone’s potential if we abort them.” but there’s always a failure to acknowledge that forcing someone to bear a child is also not allowing them to fulfill their potential.The last part that stood out to me is Maris Racal’s great performance. She is the movie. Without that performance, this film will fall apart and she delivers. What this film did is humanize a debate that’s usually so contentious it ends up being too one dimensional. It made the debate more accessible to every one. The movie is unflinching and raw. A harsh criticism of a society and culture who despite being always proud of their women, continues to fail them by continuing to enabling oppressive systems that mostly targets women. A big middle finger to a society that still strongly reeks of misogyny. It also an exploration of the country’s broken healthcare system. This film is a celebration of female friendships and sisterhood. The people who helped Sunshine in her journey are women. It forces you to be uncomfortable. It forces you to think and have empathy. This film is highly relevant and should be a required watching for everyone. Probably one of the most important Filipino films ever made.

ghostfacers,,"we meet sunshine through her battle of being an olympian. armored by her well-worn asian games shirt and her head held high, she shines the brightest among her peers who also look up to her and what more she can become. her coach knows this too, along with her family and lifelong friend, who would all do everything to make sure she achieves them.perhaps its in the nuance of a story that is deeply feminist and human, but antoinette's jadaone's sunshine is the strongest in its ability to capture the realities of adolescent pregnancy with both gentleness and fierce. portraying (albeit sometimes preaching about, but deservingly so) the world of a filipina girl navigating the weight of expectations and the silence surrounding sexual and reproductive health, the story unfolds as a reflection of what we lack and suffer from. this flaw persists in the lesson of consent that was never taught, contraception never offered, the judgment of clinical service providers, the terrifying possibility of dying alone, and the unbearable strength it takes to push forward anyway, not because you’re fearless, but because you must. as a youth. as a woman. as a human with dreams and rights.the reality today is rough: the philippine government failed to pass its version of the adolescent pregnancy prevention bill in the recent senate, the current curriculum and implementation of the comprehensive sexuality education is in question, and more and more right-wing (ish) groups are mobilizing their funds to hinder the fight even more. but hopefully, with these kind of films made accessible to the public, we will be reminded that abortion happens not just because teenagers are risky or that they have been abuse hence it's justified, but because they have the right to decide for themselves.after all, sunshine's every step and every twirl, carries not just her own hope, but the collective dreams of those who raised her, and fought for her to have this. and in watching her take the mat, we are reminded of every girl who dreams of olympic gold, of becoming president, of curing AIDS, and how urgent it is that we believe in them first before some blob of blood. that we talk to them about things that matter. that we care.because when we do, they shine.",2025-07-25,20,0,watch,False

It perfectly encapsulates the intersectionality of being impoverished and a woman in the predominantly catholic setting. It is a bold statement to the cruel realities women face, especially the ones at the bottom. She is caged by the system. Jadaone has given justice in telling the plight women face.Sunshine’s character is imperfect and flawed, but real which makes you root for her character. This was emphasized by the camerawork which maintains a certain intimacy with the character that makes you see Sunshine’s vulnerability. Racal portrayal of Sunshine makes you want to empathize with the character because amidst of all the imperfections, there is this young dreamer. Her poor decisions are the consequence of the society she exists in, wherein there is no other choice— leaving her to opt for desperate methods.This film is so personal bilang isang babae.",2025-07-26,0,0,watch,False

kagitlingan,10,"Sunshine Is Every Woman Who Dreams Beyond Her CircumstancesSunshine was not created for the sake of making a statement, nor just triggering a conversation; it was meant to make people feel and understand why abortion happens and how our current system makes them dangerous for women. Sunshine did not need to be pitied or root for, she needed to be understood.The film opens and immediately solidifies Sunshine’s ambition. It is anchored on Sunshine’s eagerness to excel, to achieve, to succeed, to be the best, to be an Olympian. And this ambition is not going anywhere. With every tiptoe that Sunshine stands on—as she throws her pink ribbons and gives in to impulse—she stands tall again, catching the ribbons as if they were always meant to fall in the right places… until they don't. Sunshine’s perfect harmony gets disturbed by her sudden realization that she is pregnant. Antoinette Jadaone’s intentional direction on making some scenes too loud, too chaotic, and far too overwhelming added to the personification of Sunshine’s mind; scrambling, panicking, terrored. It was not just Quiapo’s busy streets, it was also Sunshine’s trembling heart. But in between the anxiety and fear, Sunshine gathers the courage to try making a choice—even amidst the confusion. Sunshine finds out in the harshest way possible that a choice is not an option. She is put in a situation where the only way out is to give in to ‘sinful’ acts, dangerous pills, and death-defying abortion attempts. For a young teenager whose dreams seem too far from where she is, this is the only way. While many expect this decision to become the climax of the movie, Sunshine’s story is far from over. In my understanding, the film explored her conscience through Annika Co’s beautifully done character. It reminded the audience that while women consent to abortion, they are still carrying its moral burden. Annika’s character became an instrument to make women who seek abortion feel human, with human conscience and sensibilities. But it was done with such care, careful enough not to make it counterproductive but rather stuck in the ideology of the system that she grew up in.However, Annika’s character is only a personification of Sunshine’s chaotic mind, making Sunshine her own companion to her dawning journey. This character becomes Sunshine’s comfort in the dangers of her abortion attempts, showing the deeply awful and tragic realities many women face; alone in rotting walls of the city, drowning out the noise, and daring to dream bigger than the spaces they are subjected in.But what makes this movie even more special is that it did not let Sunshine go through it alone. While the movie was an avenue for telling the reality, it also became a source of hope for many women, especially for young ones who will watch it. There will be other women supporting them in their decision, other women who will not judge them for their choices, and other women who will create a safe space for them—at least in ways that they can, in the rotting system we have. Finally, Sunshine does not just urge the system to give women the rights to their own body; it explicitly explains what women go through in the struggles that we speak of. It does not undermine the calls for a systemic change, but it brings you the stories behind why a choice is necessary. It opens you to a narrative that does not just agree to progressive actions, but puts the heart in it. And in between those narratives, the movie reminds us that women are more, that they deserve to take up more space. Women are dreamers, they have ambition, they are complex, cohesive, and compassionate. Women are more than their mistakes, their stories go beyond. And that is the essence of a choice; to let them dream. To free them from the shackles of an already oppressing society. To not dim their light and let them shine, like Sunshine herself.To all the Sunshines out there, you are not alone. Be steadfast on your ambition and dare to dream big. And you take up space even bigger.",2025-07-24,1,0,watch,True

toriteriyakidon,9,"In many known movies, abortion is commonly narrated as a quest with so much comedic acts, plus some forced shallow arguments to inject drama.But for Sunshine — How the movie depicted purchasing a pregnancy test kit in the Philippines = an act to get humiliated. Sunshine, a teenage Filipina athlete forged to be an Olympian who had an unwanted pregnancy, was the sacrificial being for a story to be told.Sunshine happened in the Philippines, where access to reproductive health services is way harder to have compared to other countries, like in the US and Europe. The country has been enclosed with regressive conservatism, causing talks about sex to still be taboos. Abortion is still illegal as well. The movie happened right smack in the heart of Manila City — Quiapo. It is an area known for a well-known Catholic Church and the surrounding kubols or booths of herbal medicines and potions for all uses — from seducing someone, cursing someone, to inducing abortion (or in Filipino, “pampawala ng kapit ng bata.”) The story, its darkness, and some women’s resort to the said harmful options would not have happened if only proper education and healthcare are available, to be honest.Sunshine was very telling of the struggles of Filipinas. But I think it’s globally reflective as well because it told the following things:1.) Unfair treatment on female athletes: Remember Venus Williams’ pregnancy? She almost died after giving birth, and she was kicked out of the top ranks because she cannot play during recovery. The WNBA players? They just wore shirts last All-Star weekend saying “Pay Us What You Owe Us.” And here, Sunshine, an aspiring Olympian, unintentionally risking her passion and potential bread and butter just because proper help is nowhere in sight.2.) Violence against women and children: Catcalling, predatory stares, and rape were parts of this movie. The movie did as much as it could to raise awareness that these actions are still apparent and are unfortunate enablers of all things that went downhill for the female characters. Sunshine mirrored reality, especially for us, Filipinas. I hate writing that sentence, but, it’s the truth. ————————Technical items I liked:• Rico Blanco’s Challengers-esque film score! The music was so immersive. • Rhetorical characters (which are pretty difficult to execute and usually come out as trying-hard, but they weren’t)• Piolo Pascual and his presence. The audience just gasped as soon as he entered the frame!• Most of all — Maris Racal. Her future is so bright. Pain, so much pain, was expressed by her character. And she did more than enough that the audience would want to stop whatever’s causing her agony.• Gusto Ko Sakin Ka Lang is a banger in a tugstugs jeep 🙂‍↕️If you’re in the Philippines, watch this in any SM Cinema. If you’re outside the Philippines, watch out for more future film festivals. Sunshine has been shown in the Toronto International Film Festival, Berlin International Film Festival, Palm Springs International Film Festival, and many more.",2025-07-26,1,0,watch,False
sushipicks,9,"Sunshine is more than a film about a teenage gymnast reaching for her olympic dreams. it reflects the struggles, hopes, and quiet battles of countless young girls trying to find light in a world that often dims their shine. Sunshine isn’t just an athlete wearing an asian games shirt holding a pink crane—she is a woman, a sister, a student, a friend, and someone younger girls look up to. set in the noisy, smoggy, and congested streets of Manila, the film doesn’t shy away from the uncomfortable realities many Filipino girls face: teenage pregnancy, poverty, lack of access to healthcare and education, judgment from professionals, and the systemic neglect of women’s rights. it's not just Sunshine's story—it’s the story of so many young women who are silenced, dismissed, and left to figure things out on their own. Antoinette Jadaone once again directed a story that is not meant to be questioned, but understood. it's in movies like this that we uncomfortably see how and why women resort to abortion-simply because they are forced by circumstances. pregnant teens do not need to be told how reckless they were; they already know it, and they're already bearing the consequences of their actions. what they actually need is someone they can seek help from, someone who can give them the support they need.lest we forget it's the government that continuously denies women their right to a safe society free from the shackles of abuse and neglect.Maris Racal, you are one hell of an artist—and seeing you and Jennica Garcia in an Antoinette Jadaone film was something i didn't know i needed.",2025-07-26,2,1,watch,False

Hands up Ms. Meryll! Inay Maria must be proud of you! I hope you'll bag an acting award on this film, you deserve it!Second, gets man na nakafocus pud ang ending sa role ni Ms. Jennica Garcia cause siya nga lang naman nagtiwala at nakakaintindi kay Sunshine, but I would have love to see the change of tone on Ms. Meryll Soriano's character (kulang po yung exposure emz) — she has been one of the dynamic characters in this film and I want to see her sa ending more, now that Sunshine has done what she really loves to do, and parte rin naman siya ng success ni Sunshine. She, in the first place, confronted Sunshine about the ""rumors"" but in the end, in her quiet strength, sinuportahan man pud niya.Third, TAYO ANG CHARACTER NI ANNIKA CO. Ang character ni Annika Co reminds me of the character ni Joven sa Goyo: Batang Heneral. Annika Co doesn't just represent ""Sunshine's child"", she represents how Pinoy see and interpret in their own narratives ang mga personal decisions ni Sunshine. Kumbaga ing-ana ang most judgments sa mga tawo sa mga personal decisions ni Sunshine. She was taken lightly kay ang character naglalaro thru a child actor pero katong part sa falling action na ni ana si Annika ug ""ngayon gets ko na..."" with full of love and a hint of conviction. That's the cue, mao na ang gusto ni Sunshine mahitabo sa nation na magets siya na women should always have the right with their bodies, and what to do with their bodies. I was ugly crying sa whole falling action-resolution because of that freaking satisfaction makita sa nawong ni Sunshine while gracefully performing sa iyaang practice. Ing-ana ang gusto nato makita sa mga babaye if they choose themselves and could become as selfish as these men or even more. Basta gahilak rako ani na part kay heartfelt kaayo ang whole scene with Annika plus giatay dalang dala kaayo ko sa musical scoring ani na scene even without dialogues, just pure execution.Andami ko pang gustong sabihin, but mao ra sa ni ang nitatak sa ako while watching.This is not just a reflection of what's happening sa mga kababaihan, cause this is also a call for action na kailangan na mulihok ang mga lawmakers na ma-Decriminalize ang Abortion sa Pinas to give chance to all women who are not ready to become mothers kasi may mga pangarap pa na mas dapat unahin.

kennypmd,10,"Jennica Garcia, best supporting actress! Grabe. Iyaq na naman si ako, naalala ko na naman iyong “Sunshiiine” nya. Grabe. Andame kong thoughts sa movie! I can’t! Direk Tonet, kung nababasa mo to, yis galeng tai nah!!!! Woooooooh!!!!!!ADDENDUM CHAR (i just can’t stop thinking about this movie after like a week) Sunshine is a story of hope entangled in reality’s shadow.I’ve seen this film before—many times. As a student, learning the theoretical aspects of medicine. As an intern, having actual encounters through interviews with women like Sunshine. And as a practicing physician, who trained to become an OB-GYN, completing many incomplete miscarriages—induced or not—removing what’s left of what we call products of conception. Sometimes people call it products of misconception when they’re trying to be funny.This movie didn’t just slap us with the sensitive issue of abortion. It dissected so many layers of issues we need to talk about more often—and pondering them in reality is a mental and moral gymnastics at play.I would love to discuss all of them one by one, but this is a movie review after all, not an essay on the dangers of lacking a solid law to protect our young women from the societal pressures of patriarchy and religion—pressures that push them into life-threatening situations, only to be blamed for doing something they had no real choice about. In short, fuck the system.It’s always been a mental gymnastics for me to decide how to approach situations like this. And this movie is telling me exactly how. Jennica Garcia’s character deeply resonated with me—from the way she calls Sunshine’s name so tenderly, to the way she assures her that she’ll be there no matter what. She reminds us that we all need at least one ate around us who looks after us despite everything. (She literally said, shouted even, BE KIND!)Another character who lingered in my mind was the 14-year-old teenage mother. Shoutout to the team for dressing her in something colorful—a subtle clue to her identity, only revealed later. She was one small character representing thousands of teenage mothers, who are becoming younger as the years go by. She also represented the vulnerable group prone to sexual abuse—the group we have somehow failed to protect.I’d love to dissect each of the characters, but I’ll leave that to you. Instead, I’ll talk about Sunshine (last na, promise). Maris Racal’s portrayal was a masterclass in character acting. Sunshine is a fearless dreamer, full of dedication and passion to make that dream come true. She perseveres despite her family’s circumstances. She’s also a believer, kind, and someone who truly cares. You see it in the small things—like the way she makes the sign of the cross before her performance, or when she prays fervently in Quiapo Church to ask for guidance or forgiveness on the thing she’s about to do or not to do. And that’s the beauty of this film—it tells you so many things without saying so much. It urges its viewers to talk about them because these are urgent matters. Maybe we’re still far from legalizing abortion, but this movie isn’t just about that. It’s telling us we have so many other issues to tackle.In short, we need to protect the Sunshines—or this world will become darker than it already is.",2025-07-26,1,0,watch,True

1800milf,10,"I’m fairly easy to please when it comes to films. Give me a solid plot, a bit of laughter, a love story I can root for, and a strong ensemble, and I’m happy. Sunshine delivers all of these, but more importantly, it delivers a quiet, aching kind of truth. The trailer already sets up the premise: an aspiring Olympic gymnast finds herself two months away from the qualifiers, and pregnant. What unfolds is not a cautionary tale, but a necessary, grounded story about the private cost of dreams and the impossible decisions women are often forced to make.This is not a conventional film. At several moments, I found myself crying with Sunshine—because I know there are many women like her. Women who have been in the same position, or still are. In a country where laws continue to deny women the right to make choices about their own bodies, Sunshine handles its subject matter with a kind of restraint and realism that does not demand pity, but insists on empathy. Even if you haven’t experienced what she has, you feel it—because you are human, and perhaps more deeply, because you are a woman. When the credits rolled, it took a while before anyone in the cinema, including myself to get up and leave. There was a heaviness in the room. Everyone sat in silence, letting the weight of the film settle in.Some have described the film as Brocka-esque, and I find that comparison apt. This is Tonette Jadaone’s most powerful work to date. A film that is necessary, timely, and deserving of all our support. I hope more people watch Sunshine and understand this side of womanhood, one that is constantly sidelined in the name of morality and ethics. There is truth, and power, in giving women the right to choose. In letting them take ownership of their own bodies. Always.",2025-07-26,1,0,watch,True

Maris Racal delivers her best performance yet, as there’s a stillness to it that makes it all the more heartbreaking.What I really loved is how it doesn’t feel like it’s trying to explain itself and it just presents the reality where religion, poverty, and patriarchy intersect in deeply personal ways.

marckryancidro,9,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine listens. It listens to the silence of shame, the dissonance of faith, and the quiet, aching resolve of a girl who simply wants to choose. It’s the kind of film that our deeply Catholic country isn’t ready for, but desperately needs. That it’s showing in nationwide cinemas—not just tucked in the corners of a progressive film festival—feels like a small act of rebellion in itself.Like Eliza Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, a film I often return to when thinking about stories of quiet resistance, Sunshine unfolds with restraint and tenderness, never sensationalizing what is already unbearable. But where Hittman’s film relies on cold urban detachment, Jadaone’s world breathes with a Filipino kind of chaos: loud horns, dim chapels, vendors selling herbal “solutions” beside icons of the Virgin Mary. It’s all there. The hypocrisy, the hush-hush remedies, the weight of sin pressed upon young women’s shoulders before they even understand the language of their own bodies.Maris Racal is astonishing. She carries the film with a performance so grounded, so lived-in, that she often feels less like a character and more like someone we know. A friend. A cousin. A girl on the jeep beside us, clutching a bag, hiding her fear behind a tight grip and a brave face. Her Sunshine is not loud, but she is brave. And perhaps bravery today looks exactly like this: choosing to take control of your life, even when the world tries to stop you.Jadaone’s direction is both intimate and distant, borrowing from the gaze of Brocka but infused with a distinctly feminine grief. We see Sunshine from behind glass, from across alleys, as if we too are complicit in watching but not speaking up.

holdnogrudge,9,"i’ve already seen so many pro-choice films that greatly explore the difficulties of going through an abortion (never rarely something always, happening, etc) but i must say that it feels really different to watch a film like it made in your country.. because in the pro-choice films i’ve watched before, they’re usually either set in the old times where abortion was still illegal in their countries or set in a modern setting whereas the female lead needs to travel in other places/states to undergo abortion legally… but in sunshine, it’s set in the modern times or the living conditions of filipino people right now yet there’s still no place to go where abortion is accepted… which speaks a lot about the real life situation for women in our country. women anywhere have to go through a lot to apply *the choice* that they’ve decided on.. however, it is much much worse in the philippines as it’s a complete taboo and sometimes it feels like we’ll never see in our lifetime where abortion will finally be legal in the country…… so, it truly is a remarkable feat that we got a pro-choice filipino film now. not only that because it’s directed by one of the most well-known directors, released nationwide, and promoted in mainstream shows and platforms. this film shedded some light to everyone and it was very much needed for every filipino woman out there.thank you direk antoinette, maris racal, and all the amazing women here for sharing the story of sunshine. ☀️❤️‍🩹",2025-07-26,21,0,watch,True

domfr_nc,5,"This film is, at its core, a well-intentioned and emotionally resonant film. It tackles difficult subject matter with sincerity, and for the most part, it does so with grace. However, I found that the inclusion of fantastical or imaginary elements occasionally detracted from the weight of its core issues. While I understand the metaphorical ambition behind these stylistic choices as well as their function in softening the emotional blows with humor or levity, I believe the film is at its most powerful when it forgoes embellishment and leans fully into the raw intensity of its subject matter. In those moments, when it embraces the chaos, the pain, and the emotional urgency it really becomes something far more affecting and memorable, allowing the simplicity it strives for to emerge, though it’s often overshadowed. At times, the dialogue veers into overtly inspirational or didactic terrain, feeling more like affirmations meant to uplift than naturalistic exchanges between characters. It’s clear that the film doesn’t only aim to tell a story, it wants to educate, to empower, to stir social consciousness. Yet in doing so, it sometimes edges closer to the tone of an educational TV movie than a fully realized work of cinema. That’s not a critique of its moral imperative, it’s a film that should be shown in schools but rather an observation about its limitations as a piece of narrative storytelling. The emotional and ideological weight it seeks to carry isn’t always supported by the nuance or complexity that cinematic storytelling demands.What grounds the film and gives it its most enduring power is its emotional core. Maris Racal delivers a performance of quiet strength and vulnerability, anchoring the film with remarkable consistency. Especially compelling is the subplot involving Rhed Bustamante’s character. Without revealing too much, her arc resonated with me more deeply than the central storyline. It was heartbreakingly authentic, subtle, restrained, and profoundly human. In that thread, the film touches something honest and unflinching.I also admired Antoinette Jadaone’s formal restraint in certain key scenes, particularly her choice to mute the sound. In a film so concerned with voice and expression, those pockets of silence carried tremendous weight. They allowed the viewer a moment of stillness, a space for reflection and imbued the film with a haunting quietude that deepened the emotional stakes.That said, the film’s message doesn’t always land with clarity. After a pivotal hospital scene, I overheard two audience members blame the protagonist for her choices, siding with the doctor who confronts her. That reaction, while anecdotal, reveals a significant shortcoming: the narrative may not have sufficiently challenged ingrained prejudices or prompted the kind of empathy it aspired to cultivate. It bravely addresses urgent topics- reproductive rights, bodily autonomy, the realities of being a young woman navigating unjust systems but the film doesn’t always sharpen these into a coherent or persuasive argument. In trying to reach everyone, it occasionally loses the sharpness needed to truly confront.Still, “Sunshine” is a valuable film, one with earnestness, compassion, and purpose. Its flaws are born of ambition: the desire to inspire, to uplift, and to inform all at once. But perhaps empowerment doesn’t always need to be accompanied by joy. Sometimes, it is in the unvarnished confrontation of pain without fantasy, without consolation that we discover our deepest strength. I don’t mean to suggest the film ought to have ended in despair, but rather that its final act, which shifts into metaphor and closes with a success story, might have benefitted from something more grounded, more unresolved or ambiguous . Real life rarely provides a clean arc, and in a film so rooted in truth, the ending felt almost too easy, too neat.",2025-07-26,11,1,watch,False

kerwinwepee,9,"A random review ***it may contain spoilers*** I was in awe after seeing the first 10mins or more of this film. How perfectly shot, how each Sunshine’s flow, movement and forms were perfectly calculated in graceful manner, it may translate to her goals as a national athlete. I like the raw and realistic on the situation where she had an idea if she might be pregnant, from the varsity clinic, how she react, getting a pregnancy kit to a local pharmacy, how she search online on how to get rid or literally “mawala sa sarili” in the moment she found out, i may say if i were in that age I probably be acting the same thing Sunshine did.It very direct, light and eye opening to different perspectives in abortion, from the pro life views, to views of men who is not ready fathered or accept responsibilities, to the views of her friends and colleagues/societal norms, in the perspectives of her coach and to her lifelong dream, to the views of some unwanted pregnant women who dealt from complicated situations, to view of her own family, for Sunshine and to her unborn child. We all have out own biases when it comes to this topic; abortion but at the end it still in the capacity of the woman, the beholder to take choice on what choices she want to take… I was too happy how her family especially her eldest sister Geleen support Sunshine in what decision she may lead to. Its a gemIn silver screen seeing that moment, that scene that is so comforting, q moment that most of us longing in a situation like this. It’s not about taking responsibilities but owning and accepting mistakes and making peace to yourself. We know what is good and what's right but in the end of the day we are the not the right one to decide for someone else fate and choices especially we are not in that situation, where they are coming from.I want to commend Maris Racal for casting as Sunshine. I can’t think anyone else to portray for the role of Sunshine. Flawless acting, she really Sunshine. Also Jennica Garcia too and Meryl Soriano, superb performance. *i love the Aryanna scene. Speaks reality!*the scene with Angeli Bayani /Dr. Helena.

kuyaed,9,"To hell with these topics being taboo in the Philippines - Jadaone says LET’S TALK ABOUT IT and this film did that. Definitely a film that will start conversations and something that will linger in thought even hours after watching it.This film - for starters, was really well-shot and well-edited. That was my first takeaway. Second, well-scored. And when that credits rolled and I saw that Rico Blanco did it? The dots were connecting and with Maris Racal as the protagonist? Wow that was definitely personal maybe that’s why it was done so good.As a man, who actually didn’t know anything about this topic - THIS WAS EYE-OPENING EDUCATIONAL FOR ME. I didn’t know how self-abortion works, I didn’t know how much it cost, I didn’t know what it looks like, I didn’t know how treatment is done after, I didn’t even know that doctors refused service for this! Imagine my fuming anger when that scene happened. For me, this was information overload.I appreciate how this was not Maris Racal anymore. This was Sunshine. Sunshine was a real person. It borderline made me forget that this was a film, it felt like reenactment of something, or maybe unintentionally, it was.Also, scriptwriting and editing masterclass - How you make people laugh with subtle punchlines with great timing, but not cutting off the momentum and emotion you feel for the scene, and also not lightening off the topic at hand. The way that that were balanced? Hats off to Jadaone and the editor, Ben Tolentino (THE GOAT)Performances were topnotch as well! I love that you feel the cast, from lead to support, not one-upping each other. You felt them read the script and read the room and operate on that energy. They were supporting each others’ performances and maybe that’s why it became more effective as a script. The execution was phenomenal.Personally, I would have loved some bit more fleshing out by the third act, because I feel like the un-accustomed or laymen movie audience may not get it immediately with the execution of it and it would’ve been better with the topic at hand to be spoonfed a bit more (but not too much). But yeah this is more of a personal nitpick at this point.Either way - BEAUTIFUL FILM! Is this my favorite Jadaone? I’m not sure yet. But is this objectively the best Maris Racal?

gmcajayon,6,"Yesterday, I stumbled upon a Twitter post pointing out parallelisms between Jadaone's Sunshine and Brocka's Insiang with how both films' main characters, in at least one scene, were framed behind bars, mirroring their metaphorical imprisonment within gendered norms of their respective social milieus. Indeed, although almost 50 years have passed between the two films, it's an unfortunate reality that women's rights in the Philippines still have a long way to go, with conservative Catholic values hindering its advancement. Both Jadaone and Brocka present us with their titular characters' fractured psyches, trying everything within their limited power to achieve some kind of self-emancipation. Another Twitter post, however, posits that while Jadaone echoes Brocka in some ways, she ultimately diverges from him by virtue of her ""woman's instinct"" that also augments her narratives with an ""added layer."" Obvious gender essentialism and identity politics aside, this is a sentiment that I'm keen on interrogating: what does it actually mean to have a female directorial sensibility, particularly in the vein of Antoinette Jadaone?An easy answer would be to look at the central conflict of Sunshine, that is, unwanted pregnancy, and that Jadaone opts for a female teenager as its main focalizer. I'm pointing this out because trans men and intersex people can also get pregnant hence a pregnancy plot point would not inherently be women-specific (although there would surely be many overlaps), so it's Jadaone's directorial decision to create a female protagonist that imbues the film with intricacies of the female experience---how proceeding with motherhood would be career suicide for an athlete aiming for the Olympics, how Sunshine is constantly berated by self-righteous people she encounters, how society itself was built against female self-determination, and despite all these, how Sunshine finds small pockets of refuge in other women---a friend, a mentor, an inn receptionist, a doctor, an abused prepubescent, a sister---who are empathetic enough to understand her pain and conviction, and to whom she's equally compelled to reciprocate kindness whenever the situation permits.Further, Jadaone digs deeper and finds the Catholic religious institution, itself a remnant of feudalism, as an underlying hegemonic force against women empowerment, so culturally embedded in Philippine society that Sunshine finds it wherever she goes, be it in the drugstore, in the hospital, in the university, in the sport that she loves, even in the man who got her pregnant. Unfortunately, here is also where Jadaone's supposed female sensibility loses steam: religious guilt is so ubiquitous that even she is not aware that it limits her perspective, that instead of finding multiple angles of inquiry she instead chooses to hammer in the same anti-religious (therefore anti-patriarchal) talking point over and over and over again, even to the point of physicalizing the unborn children, a weirdly pro-life creative decision in a film that self-categorizes as pro-choice. Heck, the film just assumes that the audience already knows about the economic facets of being a Filipino athlete so it makes no effort in examining it, nor is it concerned with how Sunshine and her family earn their money (nobody seems to be working!). No, those aren't important; just focus on the fact that Sunshine is a woman and that she's oppressed because of it. ""Drown out the noise,"" her coach tells her, but is it really necessary to drown it out if the noise is as repetitively monotonous (albeit still imminently threatening) as Jadaone presented it?My argument is that uncritical admiration for ""female sensibility"" is as dangerous as the patriarchy it contends with, and that it's the same liberal narrow-sightedness that applauds Jadaone's bravery for tackling taboo gender topics and turns a blind eye to her cowardice in heeding the pro-Palestine boycott of the Berlinale film festival in the same breath; what's the point of female sensibility if it is devoid of anti-fascist solidarity? Perhaps Sunshine is actually a self-surrogate for the lengths Jadaone is willing to go through in pursuit of her career, and we're all just supposed to root for her because it's great that Philippine cinema is acknowledged and praised internationally, everything else be damned.And maybe I'm expecting too much from Jadaone, that I should just accept that her films are self-contained texts that will never reach the same kind of radicalism and depth as Brocka's (which is admittedly a high standard to reach), but deep inside I want to believe that she's capable of bolder, stronger filmic statements.",2025-07-26,92,6,watch,False

There is a sketchy motel that asks for your ID before handing over the keys, as if the system needs to know if you are old enough to make your own decisions. A crowded hospital where pregnant women share beds in the maternity ward, almost as if they are only given a small space in a world they live in. A religious landmark for those seeking miracles, but just outside are street markets selling religious paraphernalia and illegal abortion pills.Maris Racal gives an outstanding performance as Sunshine, a young rhythmic gymnast whose Olympic aspirations are upended by unexpected pregnancy during tryouts. One of the film's striking choices is the inclusion of this magical presence played by Annika Co. To me this character felt like a reflection of the conservative audience inserted into the narrative, a constant presence, watching, whispering, and trying to make sense of Sunshine's decisions.The film closes with the hope that Sunshine, and others like her, might still get the chance to finish their routine and maybe, even become champions of their own lives.",2025-07-24,0,0,watch,True

The pacing is tight and purposeful (walang fillers, or at least I didn't feel it), and honestly, I loved every minute of it. It’s the best Filipino film I’ve seen this year.What stood out most was how it tackled the lack of body autonomy that women face in this country. We reaaaalllyyy need a legal avenue for abortion, and I hope this film helps spark that conversation. Ang hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas!I also liked that it showcased the real Manila without falling into poverty porn (great shots of Quiapo). It celebrated female friendships and relationships without centering men, and it showed the complexities of family without resorting to toxic tropes(supportive ate yes! Jennica Garcia was amaaaazing). I loved the inclusion of sports too; we definitely need more athlete-centered films.Pero, at the heart of it all is a strong, well-developed main character — flawed, impulsive, but deeply likeable and easy to root for (even during her chaotic, violent outbursts!!! I loved those moments, geh girl go lang!!!).Maris Racal was phenomenal. She captured Sunshine’s stress and anxiety with so much nuance — it never felt overacted.

But sometimes, a film like Sunshine comes along and delivers on its promise—clear, direct, and most importantly, brave.Not only is this Jadaone’s best film to date, but it’s also her most important. It’s a feminist masterclass in storytelling, evident in how every significant character in the film that supports Sunshine is a woman. And to top it all off, the ending was written to give the character what she truly deserves—even if the harsh realities of our country don't always allow a woman to have that.Even the casting was perfect and clearly intentional—from Maris’s embodiment of Sunshine to Elijah’s portrayal of the privileged Miggy (perfect choice of name, by the way).

tepmayo,4,"Sunshine (Maris Racal) is a record-breaking national athlete, but the film fails to show the weight of that achievement.She wears a tank top marked “Asian Games 2018,” and her coach (Meryll Soriano) warns her against complacency: “Balewala lahat ng gold mo sa Asian Games.”Since the Asian Games are held every four years, and Sunshine is about 19 or 20, this suggests she won multiple golds in 2018 — a rare feat. She would be gymnastics royalty, a media darling, likely the most successful Filipina rhythmic gymnast in history.Yet the film doesn’t show her as a public figure. No news clippings, no media buzz, no crowds—just a few kids asking for a selfie. It also focuses mostly on her ribbon routine, barely showing the hoop, ball, or clubs—all key to establishing her as Olympic-level.Sunshine’s decision to abort is quick, and her fears and ambitions are underexplored. The Olympics, in fact, feel more like her coach’s dream—the film tells us this but doesn’t show it.There’s no pressure from a country rooting for her, nor from sponsors who presumably funded her expensive training (which we’re left to assume, since rhythmic gymnastics is an elite sport). No rival gymnast, no sense of competition, no major stakes, and no real glimpse into the demanding world of elite sport.All this undercuts the tension around her unwanted pregnancy.Jadaone instead spends a chunk of screen time on soapy magical realism. An imaginary, foul-mouthed child follows Sunshine around, mocking her decisions. But instead of adding insight, this character becomes repetitive and irritating.Rhed Bustamante plays another pregnant teen, awkwardly inserted into the plot in an effort to cover too many sides of the abortion debate. But Rhed’s more serious situation makes Sunshine’s dilemma feel shallow—like a story about a girl careless with sex and unwilling to face the consequences.Some visuals in Sunshine hit hard: abortifacients sold beside religious icons outside Quiapo Church—a jab at how the Catholic Church, in practice, is more ritual than moral compass. There’s also a grim motel scene. But these moments can’t save the film.Set in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, where abortion is illegal, Sunshine tries to raise issues around teen pregnancy and reproductive rights, like overcrowded maternity wards. True enough, the Philippines has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Southeast Asia, especially among the poor.But if a film brings this up, it must give some context. The Reproductive Health Law, passed only in 2012, was meant to help—but the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) continues to fight tooth and nail against sex education and birth control.The film ignores all this. Instead, it gives us a cartoonish, Bible-thumping doctor and a patriarchal pastor—villains standing in for real problems. We don’t expect to be spoon-fed, but when a film enters controversial ground and hints at bigger issues, it has a duty to avoid shallow symbols.In the end, Sunshine parrots Western slogans like “My body, my choice” without anchoring its stance in the Philippine context.

I wanted to sing my praises to the movie (and I do!) pero mas nangibabaw sa akin ang sakit.Marami akong gustong punahin. Mga detalyeng mas lalong binigyan ng laman ang buhay ni Sunshine. Like how she was always framed between rails. Clearly an artistic choice, but to me, she was caged throughout the film. By judgment. By society's cruelty. By this country's refusal to grant women autonomy over their own bodies.Wherever she goes, the spaces are as narrow as her choices. Masikip sa bahay kung saan nakikita mo kung paano natapos ang pangarap ng ate niya. Masikip sa paaralan kung saan mag-isa niyang nilalabanan ang mga mapangmatang titig at pandidiri. Masikip sa Quiapo kung saan siya laging tumatakbo at naghahanap ng paraan para makalaya.Masikip sa ospital—ospital kung saan nilalarawan ang kakulangan sa magandang serbisyo. Ospital kung saan nahuhusgahan ang maraming kababaihan.The only time Sunshine's world seems to widen and glow is when she's inside the training center. Doon lang siya malaya. Doon lang may ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. At sana doon din natin maintindihan kung anong pinaglalaban ng pelikula. Sana gets mo na.Masaya akong may pelikulang ganito. Pero nangingibabaw ang lungkot.

azuregq,10,"Layunin ng Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) na magkaroon ng kamalayan ang kabataan sa mga isyu ng seksuwalidad lalo pa na nasa yugto sila na tinutuklas ito. Sa kabilang banda, kontrobersiyal ito sa ating bansang Katolisismo ang pinakalaganap na relihiyon. Gayundin ang usapin ng aborsiyon. Sa panulat at direksiyon ni Antoinette Jadaone, isa itong pelikulang sports drama na umiikot kay Sunshine (Maris Racal) na kailangan magpasiya kung ipagpapatuloy o hindi ang pagbubuntis habang papalapit ang kaniyang paglahok sa pambansang paligsahan sa rhythmic gymnastics. Walang tapon sa bawat kuha ng mga eksena, kahit na sa mga background audio nito, sapagkat sumisimbolo ito sa kalagayan ng Pilipina sa ating patriyarkal na lipunan. Nagustuhan ko ang panulat at direksiyon nito dahil sang-ayon sa sinabi ng aking kaibigan, naiparanas nito ang pakiramdam na may isa kang kakilala na kahalintulad ni Sunshine. Bukod dito, naiparamdam nito na kasama ka sa pelikula. Iyong tipong sinubaybayan mo rin ang paglalakbay ni Sunshine sa saanmang sulok ng Maynila. Kaya, makakaugnay at mailalagay mo ang sarili sa kalagayan ng pangunahing tauhan o sa sinuman. Malinis din ang pagkaka-edit ng pelikula sapagkat malinaw sa direktor kung ano ang nais niyang mangyari kay Sunshine. Piling-pili ang mga eksena kaya ang hirap pumili ng pinakamaganda o pinakanagustuhan. Hangang-hanga rin ako disenyong pamproduksyon nito dahil bukod sa ginalugad talaga ang madidilim na espasyo ng Maynila, iniisip ko kung paano sila nakapag-shooting sa ganoong karaming tao. Grabeng blockings niyon. Karapat-dapat talaga na papurihan si Racal sa kaniyang pagganap dito. Tama lamang ang timpla ng iba't ibang emosyon ang ipinamalas niya rito. Ngunit ang pinakanakabibilib sa lahat, magaling din ang mga pantulong na tauhan kaya napalitaw nito ang husay ng pangunahing artista. Ang tinginan nila ni Thea (Xyriel Manabat). Ang coach na tila pangalawang nanay na si Eden (Meryll Soriano). Ang misterysong batang babae (Annika Co). Ang kakampi na si Geleen (Jennica Garcia). Kahit na ang lokong si Miguel (Elijah Canlas). May ambag silang lahat upang mapagtibay ang karakterisasyon ni Sunshine at ang husay ni Racal. Ang ganitong pelikula ang nagbibigay ng dahilan kung bakit mahalaga na mayroong CSE at kung bakit kailangan mapag-usapan at mapag-isipan muli ang legal at siyentipikong pagpapalaglag. Babae man o lalaki, kahit na ang LGBTQIA+, binibigyan tayo nito ng awtoridad sa ating katawan. Sa kabuuan, nagustuhan ko ang ""Fangirl"" (2020) ni Direk Tonet na naglarawan ng estado ng babae sa rehimeng Duterte. Higit pa sa debate ng aborsiyon, napaibig ako sa ""Sunshine"" dahil sa pagpapakita nito ng tunay na ideya ng feminismo - ang pagkakaroon ng kalayaang pumili at ng kakampi.",2025-07-26,1,0,watch,True

julsbatuang,9,"Sunshine presents a two-pronged takeoff on putting forth a controversial subject it aims to transfigure into a discourse. It’s gritty yet poignant, a dichotomy facilitated by careful restraint in its direction, intricate cinematography, and Maris Racal’s stellar performance.The film deflects clichés observed in Filipino melodramas that often rely on overly oppressive emotional tropes and techniques. Most notably, it veers away from positioning religion or the Church as a central source of female agency. Instead, it presents it as an androcentric institution where permission for a woman’s reproductive health decisions must be sought, implying a strong assertion of control and dominance over women’s bodies.Set against the backdrop of bustling, grunge-textured Manila, the camera takes a remarkable grasp on the parallelisms and minutiae of everyday life in the cruel city: a crowded train moving across the metro juxtaposed against a dreary room in Avenida; an abortifacient vendor sitting by a display of Mary Magdalene busts she sells in Quiapo; a tight-knit community devoid of love and empathy for a child.The film refuses to paint the gaps and seams of a faulty society in broad strokes. Sunshine is delicately crafted and measured. It deeply delves into the nuances and detailed complexities of living in a Christian society that has, ironically and deliberately, chosen to position women’s rights on the periphery.It taps into female solidarity as a form of agency and collective resistance, offering both an idealistic and pragmatic antithesis to the marginalization they have long been experiencing.Reminiscent of Antoinette Jadaone’s pre-studio works such as Plano (2004) and Saling Pusa (2006), Sunshine feels like a beautiful work of personal musings. It is honest, outrageous, yet tender—marking one of her greatest directorial masterpieces.",2025-07-27,2,0,watch,False

quark,,"I think it's safe to say by now that Antoinette Jadaone is one of the greats of Philippine Cinema. And not just of now, but of all time. The still-young filmmaker, who cut her teeth on quirky indie comedies ( Six Degrees of Lilya Cuntapay, Beauty in a Bottle) soon became the new queen of Pinoy Romantic Comedies, resulting in an 8-films-in-5-years streak that included classics like That Thing Called Tadhana, Never Not Love You and Alone/Together. Then in 2020, something changed. At the height of the pandemic, Tonet released Fan Girl -- an unflinching, searing commentary on celebrity worship, toxic masculinity and patriarchal oppression in the Philippines. It not only won all the major awards during that year's MMFF, but was also the highest-grossing film for that year. This makes Tonet somewhat of a unicorn: a writer/director who can make socially relevant, intelligent cinema but at the same time kill it at the box office. This feat is especially astounding in a year when zero films have actually made money. And so that six-year streak turned into a five-year absence, and wisely so. Tonet channeled her creative juices towards other roles and mediums: television, streaming, producing. I'm a big believer in taking care of one's filmography, and she's doing just that. And as fans we have finally been rewarded. Hello, Sunshine. Sunshine follows a slew of, and there's no non-blunt way to put it, abortion movies that have come to the fore in the 2020s. You have the US's Never Rarely Sometimes Always and France's L'Événement. All films follow the internal struggle and loneliness that women face when going through the abortion process. Of the three, Sunshine is the most powerful for one simple reason: it's set in the Philippines. And while it hits home because it is home, the oppression, hypocrisy and outright strangeness of the system makes this abortion story unique. It's a country where you can find ads for abortives just buy typing in ""abortion"" in your instagram search terms, where a vendor of Catholic paraphernalia situated outside a church will also peddle Cytotec, where a doctor who saves your life will also give you a 5-minute telling-to once you're well enough to listen. It's a country where self-righteous sanctimonium has endangered millions of young women's lives. Sunshine is pro-choice, but it's also pro-life. It never tries to turn away from the consequences and the trauma women go through when making this decision. And it shows us what could have been, never cheapening the lives that were lost. These layers, the emotional depth with which Tonet imbues Sunshine, are what sets it apart. It's a very thought provoking film, but it aims straight for the heart. I've spent all this time singing Tonet's praises, but of course Sunshine wouldn't be Sunshine without the brilliant Maris Racal. I meant it when I said that Maris is a generational talent: a true actress with genuine love for the craft who just also happens to be incredibly popular. She breathes so much life and attitude into Sunshine that she really feels like a friend. Someone you're rooting for, someone whose pain you understand.It's a very important film, but don't let its importance weigh you down. End of the day, like all of Tonet's films, it's a story well told with characters you genuinely care about. Sunshine is now showing in all SM Malls. Please do go out and catch it right away.",2025-07-25,76,0,watch,True

jrvicente7,9,"This is the sunshine the country needs in today’s climate.It was Jadaone’s courage that popped in my head when the title card flashed, a very Filipina name that connotes brightness and warmth — two things the film was not intended for, two things the titular character was deprived of. Sunshine is a story of every Sunshine, a Filipino woman vulnerable to systemic injustice and oppression; a story no one could have been told better than a Filipino woman herself — and a fearless and intelligent one at that. From reproductive health and general health care system to conservatism, Jadaone’s care and spirit championed. Her personification of one’s conscience was beautifully done. I sobbed through the last 15 minutes.True-to-life darkness in the country executed from the literal streets to the contexts of quality of life through Orendain’s realism. There’s a harrowing frame in the movie that ticked all my boxes as a fan of dark cinematography. I bled in the dark with Sunshine right there.This film boasts a talented bundle of actresses: Meryll Soriano, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, Jennica Garcia, with Maris Racal tying the ribbon, flexing her acting muscles across different tones and needs. Well-written and well-directed performances with standouts coming from Garcia, Co, and Racal. Ah, women.Malalim. Matapang. Mahalaga.

christiankobe_,9,"“Bakit ka ba takbo nang takbo? Mahirap yan. Tumatakbo tapos di alam kung saan pupunta.”i faintly remember this video explaining the absence of young prodigies in the film industry. because unlike athletes, the field doesn’t merely rely on one’s prime to succeed. instead, it honors the individual’s maturity, discernment, and time spent in understanding life. this is what i felt in Direk Tonet’s recent slew of films. since Fan Girl (2020), it feels like she’s found her voice¹. informed, empowered, and deeply understanding. with her latest offering, Sunshine, i have to applaud her for having the guts to tell such a delicate story, a sensitive subject matter—in a predominantly Catholic country where abortion is illegal, no less.Sunshine’s charm lies in showing the grim reality of the city, the sheer obliviousness of the night, the secret alliance of the system and culture continually perpetuating harsh conditions for women and their bodies. it’s an incisive picture for us to empathize with the Sunshines of this world, with their dreams at the palm of their hands but their backs against the wall—deprived of freedom, options, and utmost support. and don’t you find it endearing that the ensemble that helped Sunshine’s reckoning are all women? from her gymnastics coach, the motel receptionist, her estranged bestfriend, the healthcare professional, and, of course, her loving sister².watching Sunshine is important to open the discussion and continue the conversation on women’s bodily autonomy. and maybe it all starts with an understanding, a mutual agreement, and someone who will say “Gets kita.” like a heartfelt acknowledgment.___¹ one could argue it’s already burgeoning since Never Not Love You (2018)² Jennica Garcia the artist that you are",2025-07-26,14,0,watch,False

rey_benipayo,10,"""Sunshine"" is not just the greatest Filipino movie I've seen but one of the most important Filipino films of all-time! This film deals with controversial topics in our society, abortion and teen pregnancy. A week of national tryout for the gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal) finds out that she's pregnant. Conflicts arise as she has to decide what to do next. In between life and dreams, what's the most significant between the two?The film is unconventional at best. This is not your usual and average Filipino drama you'll see. It's a character study about a teenager who is on the down side of her life. We follow her journey through this life and see a glimpse of her life dealing with her problem. Maris Racal defines this film as Sunshine. Her acting here is brilliant. She's perfect for this role. Jennica Garcia surprised me. Her character as Sunshine 's sister marks! What she said to Sunshine near the ending, though it's common, is like a punch to tears! I ended up loving her character. Jennica Garcia deserves an award for being the best supporting actress for this role. Another cast that standout is Rhed Bustamante and Xyriel Manabat both deserve a recognition for their role.Blurring between reality and fantasy, mostly this film is realistic in portraying the whole theme thanks to Direk Antoinette Jadaone directions. Also, the cinematography is the best! Overall, ""Sunshine"" is a women's movie. It's timely, affecting and brave to its theme. It doesn't spoon feed. It will make you immersed and think. It's worth an experience. This is a rare Filipino movie I've seen! I'm glad and proud watching this in cinema.

jimelikula,7,"Interesting na rhythmic gymnastics ang sports ni Sunshine (Maris Racal). Hindi ito kilala sa ating bansa pero kitang-kita sa sports na ito na kailangan ng marinading determinasyon at disiplina hindi lamang sa larangan ng sports dito sa Pilipinas pati na rin sa paghahanda sa paglaban sa Olympics. Kaya naman ng mabuntis si Sunshine ay naharap siya sa isang desisyong babago sa kanyang buhay at sa mga tao sa paligid niya. Ilan sa mga isyu na nilatag ng pelikula ay ang kakulangan ng sex education at accessibility ng legal abortion sa Pilipinas dahil na rin sa konserbatibong paniniwala. Idagdag pa ang kulang na suporta ng gobyerno pagdating sa ating atleta tulad na lamang sa eksenang sila pa mismo ng pamilya niya ang naghanda ng kanyang isusuot sa Olympics. Religious hypocrisy din ang kinokompronta ng pelikula tulad sa eksenang giniguilt trip ng isang sarado Katoliko na OB GYNE at muli ring pang-guilt trip sa kanya ng pastor na ama ni Miggy kay Sunshine. Si Miggy ay pastor kid na nakabuntis sa dalaga. Hindi na rin naman bago ang pagtalakay ng abortion sa Pilipinas sa pelikulang Pilipino dahil nariyan ang ""High School Scandal"" (1982) sa direksyon ni Gil Portes at ""Hinugot sa Langit"" (1985) na pinagbidahan ni Maricel Soriano at dinirek ni Ishmael Bernal. Ang kagandahan ng pelikula ay babaeng filmmaker ang lumikha at alam niya ang nadarama at pinagdadaanan mapa-pisikal, emosyonal at sikolohikal ng kapwa babae. Napakahusay ni Maris Racal sa pelikulang ito. Ang laking tulong ng cinematog kasi 'yun ang nag-set ng tone at mood ng pelikula over-all.

gelooooooilano,8,"SUNSHINE (2024)3.8/5 SAME, ARIANA… She’s a main biàtch!! HAHAHAHA GETS KO NA!! Isa sa mga pinakapulidong gawa ni Direk Tonet. Ka-EME represent, alongside “Never Not Love You” & the iconic “Beauty In A Bottle” and “That Thing Called Tadhana.” Maris Racal literally emanated Sunshine!! She’s a ray of sunshine. This film is really for her. I didn’t know who else can bring Sunshine to life than her. & ANNIKA CO & JENNICA GARCIA…. ACTING MASTERCLASS!! MY FAVES IN ONE FRAME!! THE Xyriel Manabat could’ve been maximized more kasi halimaw sa actingan masterclass, but I think she had a proper exit. It is a delight to see Ms. Angeli Bayani’s presence contrary to her former portrayals. Her character only appeared for how many seconds, BUT THE IMPACT OF HER EXPOSURE IS OVER THE TOP!! Ang nagpalaylay sa storyline is not the open ending, but a rushed conclusion of the problem. Nasagot nga ba ang problema? Anong nangyari kina Miggy at Sunshine? Is ‘Ari-yun-uh’ also a personification that Sunshine only imagine, like Annika’s character? Hindi ko maramdaman ang father and son dynamic nina Elijah Canlas and Mr. Piolo Pascual. However, Piolo’s character, as Pastor Jaime could’ve been explained and discovered more, and not pressed in a few minute exposure. What stood out in the film were Maris, Jennica, Annika, and “Ariana”‘s portrayal. Also, Sunshine, due to her juvenile age, can be prone to misconception and misinformation. In a predominantly Catholic country wherein proper sex education and proper healthcare system are nowhere to be found, and practices are dictated by religion and morality, relying on social media platforms as search engines would mean that she’s susceptible to wrong notions of her reality, which may lead her to resort to the sudden decisions that she make. The debate between religion and choice is long-going in the Philippine context. If the international audiences accepted this film with open arms, it’s about time that the Philippines does the same, and the film’s message would transgress to those without an open mind and for those who are unawakened with the harsh realities that most “Sunshine” faces.",2025-07-27,0,0,watch,False
luicardinal,,"Manila in its rawest form. I was teary eyed through the whole movie but something in the scenes always felt lacking. And then I remembered some actual close friends who were once in the same situation, who once asked for my help and company. That what they actually needed was people who would understand and hear them and not who would feel bad for them. This did not intend to resolve anything, cos we have been seeing this in real life and in the news. But this was a good reminder that after all these headlines, after all the movies that tackled the same story, and after all the social media awareness, IS IT’S STILL A PERSISTING PROBLEM FOR MANY FILIPINO CHILDREN AND WOMEN. That we have still yet to save these women, that our authorities still don’t care, and these women are still in danger. MALALA ANG HEALTHCARE, MALALA RIN ANG JUDGMENT! I’m pro-choice because I advocate for a world where children could be children and play freely and grow old and love the life that’s ahead of them. I LOVE YOU SUNSHINE FRIENDS!

crispinyen,10,"Ito ang ibig kong sabihin kapag sinasabi kong may problematic pattern sa ilang pelikula. Layunin nito ay marahil ipakita ang pinakamasalimuot na kalagayan ng ating lipunan, subalit nauuwi lagi sa paggamit ng trauma at karahasan bilang device lamang. Sa paraang ito, yumuyugto ang kawalan ng respeto sa lived experiences ng mga biktima. Sunshine, however, is not that kind of film.Sa halip na pagsamantalahan ang lunan ng karanasan ng mga kababaihan, pinili ng pelikula na maging mapanagot. It is a story about women, in a world that constantly tries to pin them and to deny them full autonomy and diginity for themselves. Naging maingat at makatao si Direk Tonet sa treatment niya rito sa Sunshine. Hindi niya sinensationalize ang karahasan, bagkus ginawa ito nang may paggalang. Inilantad ang katotohanan pero hindi iniwan sa dulo ang mga biktima at maging ang mga manonood. In this film, we see a woman who is brave. A woman who insists on choosing for herself. A woman who, despite everything, claims her shine. To Sunshine, and to many sunshines out there: ang sinag ninyo ay magmumula sa inyo lamang. Hindi ito hinihiram, hindi ito ibinibigay, sa inyo ito at sa inyo lamang. Kasi gaano man kadilim ang lipunan sa atin, women will always be the brightest. 🌟",2025-07-27,5,0,watch,True

roynarra,,"Nauso na sa mga Pinoy viewers na hihintayin na lang nila sa Netflix yung mga pelikulang Pilipino. Para raw makatipid. Pero karamihan sa kanila, willing gumastos kapag Western superhero movie ang papanoorin. Gets naman din kasi nga may escapism kapag sinasalba ni Superman o ng Fantastic Four ang New York City kumpara sa mga realist stories sa Pilipinas. Bat nga naman kailangan ng malaking screen para lang makitang nag-aaway si Dingdong Dantes at Charo Santos?Pero please, panoorin niyo ang mga pelikulang Pilipino sa big screen, lalo na yung may magandang istorya na maaaring magbigay-linaw pa sa mga isyu. Tulad na lang ng Sunshine ni Antoinette Jadaone. Tungkol ito kay Sunshine (Maris Racal) na naghahanap ng paaran na magpa-abort dahil sa napakaraming rason: hindi planado ang kanyang pagbubuntis, ayaw siyang panagutan ng nakabuntis sa kanya, ayaw na siyang samahan ng kanyang kaibigan, pagtsi-tsismisan siya, at mauudlot ang kanyang pangarap na maging Olympian. Sa dami ng kanyang rason, simple lang naman ang kanyang dahilan: ayaw pa niya maging nanay.Ito ang unang Pinoy film na napanood ko na talagang sinusulong ang karapatan ng babae para sa kanyang katawan. At sa dami ng pinagdaanan ni Sunshine, kahit na may reservations ka sa isyu ng abortion, gugustuhin mong matupad ang gusto ng ating bida. Ramdam na ramdam ko kay Maris ang mga dinadalang problema ni Sunshine hindi lamang bilang isang aspiring Olympian kundi ang isang pagiging babae sa Pilipinas kung saan malakas ang impluwensya ng Catholic values sa ating mga batas.Intersectional din ang pagtalakay ni Jadaone sa isyu ng abortion sa Sunshine. Hindi ito basta-bastang women's rights na nakita natin sa Western media tulad ng Barbie (2024) at Sex Education (2019-2023). Hindi itinanggi o dinemonize ng pelikula ang Catholic guilt pero hinimay ito sa pamamagitan ng pag-humanize nito sa anyo ng batang babae na sumusunod kay Sunshine (Annika Co). Ang ganda ng chemistry nina Maris at Annika at ramdam mong iisa lang talaga sila.So, bakit nga ba dapat panoorin ang Sunshine sa sinehan imbes na hintayin sa Netflix o ano mang streaming service? Napakalalim ng isyu ng aborsyon at women's rights na dapat bigyan ito ng full attention. Pag naman nanonood tayo sa streaming service, may tendency tayong mag-check ng phone. Pero hindi dapat tayo ma-distract habang pinapanood natin si Sunshine. Pag naman sobrang intimidating yung scene, pwede nating i-pause. Pero sa mga ganitong storya, dapat hindi ito pina-pause. Ma-disturb dapat tayo sa ganitong kwento.",2025-07-27,4,0,watch,True

The power of the film is the way it presents and tackles about womanhood and abortion. How Jadaone, shows, and you get it without needing the tell part.Every woman in the film is amazingly presented. From the coach, doctor, sister, and teenager. I’m giving injustice and lackluster narrative of how powerful, impactful, and lustrous the film is. Each frame is enthralling, given Maris’ powerful performance and how raw Manila is portrayed. You take it as it is. The mess, powering through the noise, and living it all every single day.The film also presents a huge middle finger to the hypocrisy of abortion and religion and how the only time Sunshine (Maris) felt free from her prison, which I must say is visually and creatively presented in the film is through her passion as a gymnast.

starkleus,10,"Women are frequently placed in situations where they feel they have no choices due to the regressive and harsh judgment of society regarding our rights, particularly our right to safe healthcare. Sunshine, as a whole, has stood firm in its mission, showing why such story is important, as women continue to endure the repercussions of societal choices that place us in jeopardy. This film is undoubtedly one of those that was treated with so much care, showing little to no romanticization of the anger and struggles the characters faced, and most importantly, it did not conform to conservative ideologies.Maris Racal is definitely an actress to keep an eye on; her artistry and commitment to her craft shine through in this film. She certainly delivered one of the most valiant depictions of women in cinema, and it felt just right for her to bring the character of Sunshine to life.And of course, Antoinette Jadaone, who consistently brings depth and authenticity to her female characters, has done it again. As many have said, while anyone can create sociopolitical films, having women write and direct them adds a special touch that connects us to our shared struggles. Jadaone knows exactly how to write her female characters, and there’s nothing more beautiful than a woman who values the lives, journeys, successes, and struggles of her fellow women. Ultimately, as the film shows, it’s women who always end up caring for one another. May we live in a lifetime where abortion is decriminalized and seen as a fundamental aspect of healthcare for every woman, ensuring that no woman ever has to confront death or risk her life due to circumstances that leave her with no choice.",2025-07-27,6,0,watch,True

dennisperez,9,"Dreams carry a powerful force—one that can drive people beyond the bounds of their morals. In the film Sunshine, this force is embodied by a young gymnast, whose ambition, fueled by society’s expectations of fame, pushes her to the edge—physically, psychologically, and morally—as she struggles with the weight of success and an unplanned pregnancy. Surrounding her are characters who reflect and intensify this tension: a doctor torn between personal ethics and the responsibility of helping an abortion patient; a street vendor selling both faith and death, caught in her own contradictions; a friend navigating the rift between her parents’ choices and her own agency; and a coach who, in relentlessly pushing her to break physical limits, unknowingly drives her toward moral collapse. The film offers a counterpoint through the voice of a child—a quiet yet powerful presence that serves as both an echo of the gymnast’s inner conscience and a projection of the expectations society imposes on her. This voice becomes a haunting reminder of who she is and who she is expected to be, grounding her in an innate moral compass even as she’s pulled deeper into chaos, anxiety, and confusion.Sunshine presents a world where the pursuit of dreams comes at a cost, and where ambition blurs the lines between resilience and ruin.",2025-07-27,1,0,watch,False

Sunshine gives voice to the quiet suffering that many Filipinas carry stories of pain, confusion, guilt, and survival. it doesn’t offer simple answers, but it offers empathy. and that’s powerful.i hope more Filipinos get to watch this film, not just to be entertained, but to really listen. to open their hearts and minds to the struggles of women they may not fully understand. i hope it challenges them to reflect, to unlearn, and to care more deeply about the rights and realities of women.sana magets niyo rin",2025-07-27,2,0,watch,True

markarto,10,"How does a young woman endure a life filled with “faithfuls” who feel morally superior to judge and ridicule her choices in a society riddled with antiquated beliefs, further magnified by patriarchal politics where men can walk away without responsibilities and consequences? How do you thrive when institutions that are supposed to protect you are trying to pin you down? Maris Racal shines as the titular character Sunshine, hindi sumosobra o kinukulang, raw, honest, perfectly capturing a young woman in turmoil while trying to show a facade that everything is okay. She is supported by an amazing cast: Annika Co, Elijah Canlas, Xyrel Manabat, Piolo Pascual, Rhed Bustamante, and the most affecting performance of Jennica Garcia.This film captures the gritty essence of Manila without being patronizing or didactic. Each frame is filled with ironies: abortion drugs sold beside a church, a repeated shot of split windows showing dreams, chaos, judgement, and slivers of kindness. One shot in particular shows Sunshine rehearsing at home, on the split side are young people probably coming home from a fun night, kasi bata lang naman si Sunshine and she is willing to sacrifice everything for her dreams, at napakarami pang tulad niya, lahat sila hindi napapakinggan.

ratatoumille,8,"“gets mo na ‘ko?” id like to believe that the kid was a depiction of sunshine’s conscience and its such a powerful statement to put out there — that sunshine didnt have anyone to convince but herself. that its okay as long as the choice was hers and not anyone else’s, especially in a society that often robs women the decision to make a choice in the first place.and despite the loud and often guilt-ridden noises that paralleled the packed and polluted streets of manila, it contested the catholic and cis-heteropatriarchal belief that the sole purpose of womanhood is motherhood and to choose to become someone else is to sin. but sunshine wouldn’t have come through all odds if it weren’t also for the women in her life that chose to show up for her. the only thing more powerful than the dangers that women are constantly subjected to, are the embrace of fellow women who just understand it. sunshine didn’t even have to utter a single word, her silence, both in her vulnerable and fearless moments, was heard. the quiet glances between her and thea, reassuring her that she is seen. her sister’s arms reaching out to her in bed, making her presence known and reminding sunshine that she’d never be alone, the gentle squeeze of menggay’s hands to let her know she’s safe. they all heard and seen each other, and having someone who’s willing to carry and share your burden with is enough for everything else to be bearable. gets na gets kita Sunshine, at sana mas marami pang mga pilipino ang makarinig at makaintindi sa’yo at sa kuwento mo.",2025-07-26,3,0,watch,True

cinesilip,10,"Sunshine tells the story of a 19-year-old gymnast pursuing her dream of making it to the national team to compete in the SEA Games and eventually, the Olympics until a life-altering event changes everything.Ito marahil ang isa sa pinakamahalagang pelikulang Pilipino ngayong taon, o baka pati na rin sa buong dekada. Hindi ito nagpaligoy-ligoy sa layunin nitong maglahad ng katotohanan masakit man ito o hindi.Unang tumatak sa akin ang pangalang Antonette Jadaone noong napanood ko ang That Thing Called Tadhana. Mula noon, sinusubaybayan ko na ang kanyang mga pelikula maging ito man ay romcom, crime, psychological, o political. Siya at si Direk Dan Villegas ay palaging may tatak: may kirot, may kurot, at higit sa lahat, may lalim.Ang Sunshine ay isang napapanahong pelikula na nagsisilbing mitsa para sa mahahalagang diskusyon: ang kalagayan ng mga atleta sa bansa, ang sistemang pangkalusugan at pang-edukasyon, pananampalataya, gender roles, at higit sa lahat, ang karapatan ng kababaihan sa sariling katawan.Madalas nating marinig: “Ang anak ay biyaya.” Pero kailan nga ba ito nagiging biyaya? Kailan naman ito nagiging pasanin? Ang isang pagbubuntis ba sa murang edad ay dapat tawaging biyaya, lalo na kung ito ay dumating sa panahong hindi pa handa ang isang babae? O isa itong uri ng sumpa, bunga ng sistemang mapanghusga?Hindi laging pisikal ang pang-aabuso sa kababaihan. Minsan, ito ay nasa anyo ng mga ideolohiyang pinipilit ipalunok sa kanila. Kapag inagaw mo ang kakayahan nilang magdesisyon para sa sarili nilang katawan, para sa kinabukasan nila, para sa mga pangarap nila, iyon ay anyo ng pang-aabuso.Wala nang mas akmang gumanap bilang Sunshine kundi si Maris Racal. Ang kanyang pagganap ay puno ng puso’t tapang mula sa kanyang mga sulyap, bawat paghinga, hanggang sa mga katahimikan niya sa ilang eksena. Nararamdaman mo ang kanyang sakit, pangarap, at takot. Isa ito sa mga pinakamahusay na performance ng isang aktres sa kasalukuyang panahon.Ang buong ensemble cast ay maingat na pinili mula kina Elijah Canlas, Meryll Soriano, Jennica Garcia, Annika Co, Rhed Bustamante, Xyriel Manabat hanggang sa mga may limitadong eksena ngunit tumatak: Juan Miguel Garcia, Madeleine Nicolas, Angeli Bayani, at Piolo Pascual. Bawat karakter ay may silbi sa masalimuot ngunit malinaw na salaysay ni Sunshine.Ang pelikulang ito ay malakas, matapang, at mapanghamon. Hindi ito madaling kalimutan. Hindi kami agad nakatayo matapos ang closing credits hindi dahil baka may post-credit scene kundi dahil ninanamnam pa namin ang bigat ng mensahe nito.Sa huli, isang malaking saludo kay Direk Tonet Jadaone. Maraming salamat sa liwanag at lakas ng Sunshine. Sa panahong maraming gustong manahimik, pinili mong magsalita. Mabuhay ka, Direk!Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5 - unanimous)",2025-07-26,1,0,watch,False

carlcuevas,8,"Sunshine (2025, Project 8 Projects)I acknowledge that there are a lot of things in life I take for granted as a cisgender man. In Antoinette Jadaone’s new film, Sunshine, she presents a flawed yet heartbreaking tale on the female cost of pregnancy.In the film, we follow nineteen-year-old Sunshine, who has dedicated most of her life, along with the support of her sister who was also a former gymnast, in rhythmic gymnastics and her pursuit to enter the Philippine team for the Olympics. However, several weeks before the National tryouts, Sunshine discovers that she got pregnant after a recent sexual encounter with her boyfriend.Stepping out of the theater, I realized how it’s so hard to be a woman, not just in the Philippines but in general. And pregnancy, one of the human experiences that only a cisgender woman can experience, and how much it impacts on their health, emotions, and even their dreams or aspirations - especially when it happens completely unplanned. All of these are further amplified in the situation here in the Philippines where sexual education is still not a priority, access to quality maternal care is expensive, and role of religion to beset unfair expectations towards women.Despite having a strong message, there are things in Sunshine that I wish had been improved on. I must admit I felt a bit cheated out because the movie was initially hyped as a sports movie focusing on gymnastics - the same way Rookie did for volleyball, but in the end was more of a character drama that whose lead character is a gymnast. I wish that Jadaone delved deeper on Sunshine’s motivations on why gymnastics is important to her because at how the story was written, Sunshine could’ve played any sport and the story would remain the same. Before I get called out, I know the movie’s true intention is a commentary on the state of female reproductive health in the Philippines, but I felt like it was just a missed opportunity to highlight the state of female sports in the Philippines, particularly gymnastics because Filipino sports movies are so rare. I also felt like that the script could’ve been tightened up a bit as the elements of magical realism introduced in the story (without going too much in spoiler territory) didn’t land as much in terms of story logic.As a follow-up to her lead starring role in 2023 movie Marupok AF, Maris Racal continues to be one of the promising actresses of her generation. And in Sunshine, she delivers one of her career best performances so far, especially at lengths her character goes through and in the dedication to train of the gymnastics segments of the story.Overall, Sunshine is not an easy watch because it doesn’t mince the hard truths of how it is living as a woman in the Philippines. And now with with the ongoing female reproductive health and sexual education discussion in the Philippines, Antoinette Jadaone offers a strong message on why it is imperative that protections for women’s health should be passed, and why the movie Sunshine deserves your time and your attention.However, irony that this movie can only be seen by a limited number of people because of its R16 rating as well as the unfair cinema practices in the Philippines, makes this even more frustrating.",2025-07-27,1,0,watch,False

Kulang ang isang oras para magbalik-tanaw sa kwento mo, Sunshine.Isa lamang ang tiyak kong masasabi: Ang hirap maging babae. Ang hirap galawan ng isang lipunang ikinukulong ka sa ideya na ang puwang mo sa mundo ay nakabase sa iyong sinapupunan—sa pagluluwal mo ng bata.Kapag babae ka, hindi ka pwede mangarap nang mataas. Hindi ka pwede maghangad ng magandang career. Kapag babae ka, hindi mo pwedeng piliin ang sarili mo. Kailangan ang timeline ng buhay mo ay nakaangkla sa pagbubuo ng pamilya.Hindi lahat handang maging nanay. Hindi lahat kayang maging nanay. Hindi lahat ng babae ay pipiliin maging nanay.Balang araw, nawa’y makita ng lipunang ito ang kababaihan bilang isang pwersa, bilang isang lakas. Bigyan sana ng lipunang ito ang mga kababaihan ng kalayaang lumipad at kumawala sa mga rehas na pumipigil sa pamumukadkad ng kanyang pakpak.Maraming salamat, Sunshine, sa matapang at mahusay na pagbabahagi ng iyong danas. Isa ka mang kathang-isip, ang buhay mo ay hindi nalalayo sa kasalukuyang tinatahak ng isang babae sa bansang ito.Hindi rito nagtatapos ang kwento mo.

phenikula,10,"ang tagal ko bago isulat yung review ko sa SUNSHINE. sa pangkalahatan, walang duda—maganda at matapang ang pelikula. hindi lang maganda sa produksyon, kundi nakakanginig din ng laman. ang galing ng mga aktor, mula sa mga beteranong sina meryll soriano, xyriel manabat, elijah canlas, hanggang sa mga mas batang bituin na sina annika at julius. at higit sa lahat, si maris, na may malalim at matalim na hugot. simple pero malinaw ang paraan niya ng paghahatid ng mensahe: ang mga babae ang gulugod ng lipunan. nag-iiwan ‘to ng tanong na bakit sa kabila ng bigat ng responsibilidad na iyon, mailap pa rin ang mundo sa kanila? representasyon ang pelikulang ito na kulang pa ang mga diskusyon patungkol sa mga karapatan ng mga babae sa pilipinas. sa pelikulang ito, hindi ko kayang maging kritikal dahil alam kong hindi ko hawak ang karapatang humusga sa kwento ni sunshine. HINDI KO ITO KWENTO, at siguro iyon ang pinakamahalagang bagay na kailangang kong maunawaan. ako ay taganood lamang, at bilang manonood, ang tanging sigurado ako ay kung paano pinaigting ng pelikulang ito ang pagmamahal ko para sa kababaihan.habang pinapanood ko, parang unti-unting lumalalim ang pagkakaunawa ko na hindi pa rin patas ang batas sa mga kababaihan. mas nagkaroon ako ng lakas na sumandig sa tabi nila, sa pakikibaka para sa maayos, pantay, at respetadong pagtrato. hindi ko kailanman lubos mauunawaan ang bawat sakit, takot, at pag-aalinlangan na kaakibat ng pagiging babae pero dahil sa pelikulang ito, mas malinaw na sa akin: sila ang sentro ng komunidad. at kung may dapat magbago, hindi sila iyon ngunit ang sistema, paniniwala, at pagtingin ng komunidad sa kanila.",2025-07-27,0,0,watch,False

majoygrefaldo,9,"an underrated beauty of cinema is how it can invite one into a suspended state of reality. for a brief and borrowed hour or two, our story pauses to make space for someone else’s. sunshine (2024) is one of those rare films that honors the lending of time not with surprise and spectacle, but with empathy as its goal and medium for exploration.and the language of empathy in sunshine settles in slowly, almost bodily. aptly named, the movie seeps through the senses like the quiet force of nature: it casts a harsh light on the grayed and shadowed alleys of manila, where sins and prayers blur into one cruel cacophony. it burns with familiarity when we recognize sunshine, the girl, in our own world.she sits beside us in overcrowded jeepneys, gets scolded like us in hospital beds, walks among us on streets of quiapo that shame and steal a strip of dignity. with the same light, the film reaches for the sunshine within us - the ones who dream and persist, who dare hold our potential as promises. there are sunshines among us held tightly by sisters, while some sunshines are held up only as stubborns who flicker through the dark. yet herein lands the most transcendent part of the film: it peddles no moral lesson or pedantic sermon. all that it offers is an invitation to bear witness to sunshine, as she moves to the rhythm of a music only she can hear and pushes against the gravity of choices forced upon her. the film doesn’t seek answers; it simply asks for understanding. in its own sober way, it holds out hope that when the borrowed time is up, may we not only remember every sunshine who flies and rises, but also the ones who fall and return, until we see how every ground that meets her, holds her, or traps her, as she labors to birth her becoming, is also the same one we own.",2025-07-27,3,0,watch,False

thearchivestaff,10,"Si Sunshine ay ako.Hindi man ako rhythmic gymnast, pero may pangarap din ako. Gaya ng maraming babae at dalaga na dumaan sa unwanted pregnancy o pregnancy scare, ramdam ko ang takot ni Sunshine. Yung pagkabalisa at pag-ukit ng konsensya kapag nakahiga sa kama. Yung konsensyang lalong lumalalim kapag may mahinang katok sa pinto. Ito na siguro ang pelikula na kung ang younger self ko ang makakapanood, hindi niya magugustuhan na nakakarelate ako kay Sunshine. Pero ganito talaga, personal na ito sa akin. Naiintindihan ko si Sunshine. Damang dama ko yung galit. Yung takot. Yung tapang, na bahala na nga basta wag lang mapurnada ang mga plano. Ramdam ko at alam ko kung saan hinugot ni Sunshine yung tapang na 'yon. Ang karakter ni Sunshine ay nakaangkla sa batang pasulpot-sulpot. Para sa akin, inner child niya ‘yon. Pero may kasama akong nanood na nagsabing baka konsensya niya raw 'yon. Pwede rin.Tingin ko inner child niya 'yon, dahil sa tricycle scene, duguan rin ang hita ng bata. Na para bang sinasabi na kung iniinda ni Sunshine ang sakit at pilipit ng puson, dama rin yon ng inner child niya. Nasasaktan. Naaawa. Maliban doon, gusto ko rin i-emphasize kung gaano ka poetic ng eksena. Naka higa sa hita ng bata si Sunshine na nag-aagaw-buhay. Hinihinging lumaban siya. Hindi ba't magandang pagnilayan na sa lowest points ng buhay, ang boses na naririnig mo ay ang boses ng munting ikaw? Maliit, oo, pero may bigat, may bagahe.Ang rason naman kung bakit daw konsensya ni Sunshine ang bata, ay dahil sa eksena sa ospital. Galit na galit ang bata kay Sunshine at hinahanap niya si Ariana, isa ring batang pasulpot-sulpot. Ineexplain ni Sunshine na okay na si Mary Grace pero ang importante para sa kanya ay si Ariana, na nawawala. Nawala na ba si Ariana dahil nawala na rin ang dinadala ni Mary Grace?Pero sa kabila ng lahat, matapang si Sunshine. Doon sa unang hospital scene, kita mong may hiyang nararamdaman si Sunshine. Pero dahil sa trauma at pagkalito, sunod lang siya sa pinagsasabi ng overly righteous na doktora. Hanggang sa napuno si Sunshine. Isa sa pinaka-paborito kong linya niya ay nang tanungin niya ang doktora: ""Para saan?"" Na para bang may panghuhusga rin si Sunshine sa kanya. Ang daming layers ng pelikulang ‘to. Hindi lang siya tungkol sa isang babae. Kwento ito ng pinagdadaanan ng isang babae sa isang bansa na binigo at binibigo ang mga kababaihan na magkaroon ng karapatan na magdesisyon para sa katawan nila. Nagbabago na ang panahon. Hindi na dapat taboo ang usapin ng sex at sex education. Higit sa lahat, ang mga batang gaya ni Mary Grace ang pinaka bulnerable sa lahat. Ramdam ko rin si Mary Grace. Ano ang laban ng isang 13-year-old sa isang Uncle Bobot? Alam nating maraming Uncle Bobot. At dapat lang na basagan ng bote sa ulo ang mga kagaya nila. Maraming kagaya ni Mary Grace, nananahimik lang, natatakot.

aphrod,8,"We are introduced to Sunshine through her warming up with other student-athletes and performing her routine for the upcoming Olympic team tryouts. Viewers can tell that her prowess and national team member status is a mix of talent and hard work, that even when she messes up halfway through, it doesn't make her any less of a great gymnast.When she first finds out that she is pregnant, the camera focuses on her hands tremble. But she immediately acts on it – searching for suspicious dealers for pills, telling the boy that knocked her up, and going to church to pray that the Lord takes away the being forming in her womb – even when we see glimpses of her trying not to lose her composure in the humid streets of Manila.The film shows and justifies Sunshine's reasons for wanting an abortion, even if the means available in the Philippines will harm her. She has dreams that can't be put on hold, and she clearly is a young girl with mannerisms and tendencies deemed ""immature"" – factors that do not make her fit to be a mother.But in a scene wherein she talks to a pastor (played by Piolo Pascual, who made everyone in my cinema gasp) that promises financial support throughout her pregnancy and motherhood, she rejects it. ""Ayoko maging nanay,"" she says, plain and simple.That was my favorite part of the film, because it felt cathartic to hear it. Although Sunshine had good reasons for the choices she makes, we must not need to have justified, valid, and layered reasons for wanting an abortion. Some of us do not want to be mothers and undergo the medical complications that come with carrying a child, just because.I hope that it has more time to stay in cinemas.

convincent,9,"The body of the story may be about Sunshine, but its soul revolves around Menggay.From the moment the official trailer dropped, Sunshine instantly captured my interest. I’ve been waiting ever since for the chance to see it and after months of anticipation, I finally did. And now, I can say this without hesitation: I have nothing but praises for the film.More than just well-made, Sunshine is a brave and necessary work. It’s a film that demands to be seen — not only because of Maris Racal’s powerful performance, but because of how urgent and relevant its message is in today’s world.Unlike other films that leave you in feel-good state when the credits roll, Sunshine leaves you with questions — difficult, uncomfortable questions that deserve to be brought into the open.What if women had better options?What if men received the same public scrutiny when it comes to unwanted pregnancies?What if we had a healthcare and justice system that actually protects girls like Menggay?What if we dared to talk about abortion in a way that invites honest, compassionate, and informed discussion?This is where the film finds its power. When Menggay’s story arc unfolds, that’s when Sunshine cements its message, it stops being just a film and starts becoming a mirror to reality.Because this is for the countless Menggays out there — young girls with no real choices. Mga batang gaya niya. Isang 13-anyos na tinanggalan ng karapatan ng mismong sariling pamilya.And the painful truth is: there are far too many Menggays in our country. Uneducated. Deprived of opportunities. Denied the chance to choose a safer path forward.Watching this film taught me to become more open-minded. It urged me to weigh both the pros and cons of abortion more critically, and to consider how we can use art as a tool for education and awareness.In the end, Sunshine is not just a film — it’s a challenge. A challenge to our government to craft better, more inclusive campaigns. Ones that don’t just resonate with the intellectuals but reach the grassroots, where change is most needed. #Sunshine",2025-07-28,0,0,watch,True
mfcarandang,8,"After two decades in the industry, Antoinette Jadaone has cemented her capacity to bend, direct, and write with different genres — the deconstruction of ekstras with Lilia Cuntapay, the ironic and hilarious takedown of cosmetic surgery industry with Belo-approved meta-comedy “Beauty in a Bottle,” and the dialogue-driven romantic hugot dramas with ‘Tadhana.” Without a doubt, Jadaone stands as one of the most vital voices in Philippine filmmaking today, consistently challenging conventions and pushing Filipino Cinema forward. In all her films, one thing that’s notable she's put women's voices at the forefront. She has since taken a pandemic pause after Fan Girl, but this has also led to her researching and diving deep into her most recent film, Sunshine. The film follows a student gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal), who discovers she’s pregnant just as she’s about to compete for the SEA Games. The film takes a surreal turn when she encounters a kid/ alter ego appears in crisis moments, reflecting her inner turmoil as she faces societal judgment.Throughout the film, Sunshine’s emotional arc—marked by anguish, desperation, and vulnerability—lays bare the reality where women’s access to safe choices is morally questioned and legally denied. This taboo isolates her: abandoned by friends and her partner, judged by doctors, and pressured by her coach to give up her dreams. Social stigma is one, but the films also highlights how poverty and consequently, sexual miseducation put into question the dignity of women. To be able to choose freely, is too high of a cost for Sunshine who has to deal with its social, financial, and legal repercussions. The film understands how for women in the fringes there’s little to no choice.The film is not without hope. Her sister, who’s a single mother, grounds Sunshine. Her alter ego serves as emotional salve during her many crises. And she also chances upon an underaged girl months into her pregnancy who reflects and echoes her experiences. In each of them, Jadaone realizes Sunshine’s future: to be a single mother, carry her pregnancy to term, and have a daughter. The film effectively wrestles with the nuances of her situation: to choose her dreams or be with a child. Ironically, Sunshine occasionally stumbles under the weight of its many themes: its surreal elements and side characters threaten to overshadow Sunshine’s emotional arc. It makes one wonder how better the film would have been had it just been, as the film title suggested, about Sunshine. Nevertheless, the film is a showcase of Jadaone’s confident vision.There’s this wonderful scene in the film of a maternity ward that just for brief moment became a community for pregnant women and mothers helping and supporting one another. It epitomizes the warmth that carries Sunshine forward: from isolation to solidarity, and from uncertainty to self-understanding. Parting with her past, she talks to her alter ego hoping she’d understand. They hug. To be understood that’s just what Sunshine needed.",2025-07-27,0,0,watch,True

prdgldd,,"Alam kong napakahalaga ng pelikulang ito sa kababaihan pero ang hiling ko ay sana mas maraming kalalakihan ang makapanood nito.Ang misogyny at patriyarka ay mga problemang dulot naming mga lalaki. Matibay ang paniniwala kong kami ang dapat may pinakamalaking ambag sa pagbubuwag ng mga ito. Dapat kami ang nagpepenitensya. Pero hindi ganito ang realidad. Mga babae tulad ni Sunshine, Menggay, at ang maraming babae sa pelikulang ito ang bumabaka at nagdurusa sa ilalim ng huwad na sistema. Tila habambuhay silang nagpepenitensya para sa isang kasalanang hindi matubos-tubos kahit pa anong gawin nila—ang kasalanan ng pagiging babae.Mahusay ang pagpapakita ng Sunshine sa iba't ibang impyernong dinaranas ng kababaihan: personal, panlipunan, pisikal, mental, pinansyal, sekswal, at, higit sa lahat, pulitikal. Ramdam ito sa bawat eksena kung saan galit, pag-aalala, at pagod ang namamayagpag sa mga linya, ekspresyon, imahe, at tunog. Pati nga mismo ang kalagayan nito bilang pelikula ay isang impyerno rin: ang masalimuot na danas nina Direk Tonet sa paghahanap ng distributor, ang katotohanang madalang abutin ng mga ganitong pelikula ang mainstream consciousness ng mga Pilipno, ang mabilis na pagliit ng bilang ng mga sinehan na nagpapalabas nito, at ang nagbabadyang diskurso na tiyak na magiging mapaghati. Samakatuwid, ang pelikula mismo ay dumaan at patuloy na dadaan sa impyernong ginawa ng patriyarka.Ipinapakita ng Sunshine na mula noon hanggang ngayon, kababaihan ang umaako sa responsibilidad na hamunin at buwagin ang patriyarka. Kaya sana mapanood ito ng mas marami pang lalaki, lalo na kung hindi pa sila mulat sa realidad ng kababaihan, mga batang ina, at mga biktima ng sekswal na karahasan.

salingpusa,10,"i knew i had to watch this before this film disappears off the face of the earth like gitling did. no regrets because this might be antoinette jadaone’s magnum opus yet. sunshine (2025) had no metaphors and subtle parallelisms: it screams that a woman’s autonomy is her own. a very straight-forward, well-thought of, and a passionate piece about how a woman was made to struggle the moment she was born by the system and how it’s designed to take away her ownnes. this is true for everywhere else in the world; but much more significant in the context of a third world country such as the philippines. abortion is a controversial topic in the country, to say the least. it is seen as a violation to the sanctity of life—a sin to remove a clump of cell in a human body. swayed by the biblical texts and the catholic church, abortion is illegal in the country. but for women like sunshine and mary grace, the law does little to stop the reality: it only pushes them to do the act in shadows, where the only option is unsafe and risky. the religious references throughout the film were palpable: from the jeepney that sunshine rode to quiapo bearing the sign that says “gift of God” to sunshine’s physical manifestation of her conscience in the form of her would-be child—which shows an inner conflict between her faith and survival. these references do not seem disrespectful but rather an emphasis on how deeply stitched sunshine’s struggle to catholicism is. it’s a critique on how the bible is weaponized to police a woman’s choices and her bodily autonomy. i want to make a point on the healthcare system too which the film really did a good job criticizing: with all its faults, the healthcare system is biased against women. the lack of access to safe procedures, institutional neglect, and moral policing (made by professionals, mind you) leave women like sunshine and mary grace with nowhere to turn. the lack of quality healthcare in the country is so normalized that it leaves everyone no dignified options to address even their basic needs. a perfect film that paints intersectionality so well: women from different sectors, despite having the same oppressor, face different realities. it did not sensationalize abortion but it gave the audience another angle to look at it from; in a perspective that’s raw and honest. i was crying at the end (#that scene) because in spite all this, she prevailed. a woman, in a system that set her up to fail, survived and lived to achieve her dreams.overall, sunshine (2025) was hopeful, important, and full of courage. an important film that must be seen by everyone (and more importantly, by women). maris racal, you are a generational talent, you deserve all the flowers AND jennica garcia, this piece’s hidden gem, you have mothered on a scale no one has ever had before.",2025-07-28,5,2,watch,True

darthbea,10,"Sabi nila, kapag ang isang pelikula ay tumatak sa damdamin at isipan ng manonood, naiparating nito ang mensahe nais ipaabot. Kapag dala mo pa rin ito hanggang sa pagtulog mo, ibig sabihin ay maganda ang pagkakagawa. At kung pagising mo'y ito pa rin ang laman ng isip mo, isa itong tunay na obra maestra.Naalala ko pa noong una kong mapanood ang That Thing Called Tadhana. Alam kong iba si Direk Tonet. Para niyang binago ang pormula ng mga pelikulang Pilipino. Simula noon, naging tagahanga na ako ng kaniyang mga gawa. Walang tapon sa kaniyang filmography. May lalim ang bawat karakter na nililikha niya. Naiipakita niya ang mga struggle at kahinaan naming mga babae, pero kasabay nito, naipapakita rin niya kung paanong buong tapang naming niyayakap ang aming pagkababae.At sa pelikulang ito, mas lalo niyang pinatunayan kung gaano siya kagaling bilang direktor. Alam ko nang magiging maganda ito, mula pa lang sa premise at trailer, kuhang-kuha na niya ako. Pero nang mapanood ko na ito nang buo, mas lalo akong humanga. Panahon na, sa tingin ko, para kilalanin si Direk Tonet bilang isa sa mga haligi ng pelikulang Pilipino. Ang pelikulang ito ang magbubukas ng daan para mas mapansin siya hindi lang bilang direktor ng rom-com, kundi bilang isang seryoso at malalim na haligi ng sining at dakilang manunulat.Bawat shot, pinag-isipan. Hindi lang basta kinuha para lang sa aesthetic. Bawat karakter, may saysay at mahalagang ambag sa buhay ni Sunshine, hindi lang basta comic relief o pandagdag lang sa cast. Mahusay ang bawat isa, lalong-lalo na si Jennica Garcia, kada eksena niya, tagos sa puso. Napakahusay rin ng batang si Annika Co, kaya niyang makipagsabayan sa mga beterano. Siya ang nagmistulang liwanag, ang ""sunshine"" sa kabuuan ng pelikula.At si Maris Racal—kung hindi siya mananalo ng mga acting awards, ewan ko na lang. Para siyang isinilang para sa papel na ito. Bitbit niya ako sa bawat eksena. Bawat ngiti, bawat pikit ng mata, bawat hinga, ramdam na ramdam ko si Sunshine. Ang lalim ng koneksiyon ko sa kaniya. Wala akong ibang hiniling kundi matapos na ang paghihirap niya. Dahil 'yon sa galing ng pag-arte ni Maris. Nagawa niyang kumonekta sa kaluluwa ng mga manonood hanggang magroll ang credits.Hindi na kinailangang i-detalye pa ang mahabang backstory para makilala si Sunshine. Ang galing ng pagkakasulat. Walang patay na eksena, lahat mahalaga, lahat may emosyon. Mararamdaman mo ang lahat: awa, inis, galit, tawa, lungkot, takot, pag-asa, at saya.Ito ay nagsilbing tinig ng mga kababaihan. GETS NA GETS tayo ng pelikulang ito. Hindi lang nito binunyag ang mapait na realidad ng mga kababaihan, pero ipinakita rin nito kung paanong ang mga babae ay kayang maging unapologetically passionate sa mga gusto namin sa buhay, sa mga pangarap namin. Dagdag na rin ang pasilip kung gaano kahirap na itinatawid ng mga atletang Pilipino ang buhay sa loob at labas ng pagsasanay.Hindi perpekto si Sunshine, pero kahanga-hanga ang pagkakabuo ng kaniyang pagkatao. Ang ganda ng paghubog sa kaniyang karakter. Lagi na lang nagtatanong ang kalalakihan: “Bakit ang mga babae na lang ang laging maingay? Bakit sila ang laging humihingi ng karapatan?” Para bang pakiramdam nila’y binabalewala na sila sa modernong panahon. Sana mapanood nila ito. Sana makita nila kung gaano unfair ang mundo para sa kababaihan. Sa aspetong pisikal pa lang, talo na kami. Kaya kung maaari, bigyan man lang sana ng puwang ang aming mga karapatan na matagal na namin hinihiling na pagbigyan. Ang dali-daling talikuran ng lalaki ang responsibilidad, pero sa babae? Kami ang nagdadala ng lahat ng iniwan na pinsala mapa-mental, pinansyal, emosyonal, sosyal, at lalong lalo na sa pisikal.Ang pelikulang ito ay isang mahigpit na yakap para sa kababaihan, at isang mata na bumubulaga sa mga nananatiling bulag sa mga hinaing at karapatang matagal na naming ipinaglalaban.

Isang pelikulang binigyang kulay ang isang usapin na matagal nang pinapadilim — ang karapatan ng kababaihan. Hindi ito pag-romanticize ng abortion. Ito ay pagtindig sa matagal nang pinapatay na diskurso tungkol sa maling ideolohiya, diskriminasyon, at ang paulit-ulit na pagkundena sa kakayahan ng babae na magdesisyon para sa sarili.Ang bigat ng mga eksena, pero ang galing — kasi ang gaan nitong naipaintindi. Gets ko na.Salamat, Direk Antonette, sa tapang at galing mong magkwento. Kay Maris, na sa loob ng higit isang oras at kalahati, ay naging si Sunshine — at naging kaibigan ko. Sa buong cast, salamat sa pagbuo ng mundong hindi namin kayang talikuran, dahil ito ang totoo.Kung may oras ka, panoorin mo Sunshine.

She played the role so well, from the gymnast to an early teen, pregnant, soon-to-be mother, not ready yet for the responsibility. She gave it all for this. The movie is full of different emotions. You will laugh, become angry, and be inspired. It is a story of a struggling athlete and the reality of different social issues in the country. The cinematography was superb, showing the different scenes in a way that made you get hooked and feel the emotion. The dialogue was natural and sublime and not filtered to show the actuality of what would happen. WHAT I LOVE THE MOST IS THE TWIST ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF ANNIKA AS “BATA”. It sealed the deal.

Annika, the bata, as a narrative device to signify conscience of Sunshine was Jadaone's wonderful choice to gently discuss a sensitive topic such as abortion without deafening the fetus inside of a pregnant woman.

eyowen,,"a film about special people who live a rather normal life, amidst the chaotic yet beautiful, neon-lit street life of manila, filled with a heartwarming sense of humanity. having only seen 'six degrees of separation from lilia cuntapay', i think i can say that direk tonet gets it, she treats her characters in a way that makes us care and relate with them in one way or another; i may not be pregnant like sunshine, but i very much live in the same society as her. the director doesn't glorify or romanticize the world in which sunshine, and we, live in—it is depicted in an achingly honest way, and therefore brutal. and maris racal is able to assimilate (?) in this world built around her character, she was phenomenal in portraying this character in such a manner that is raw and tender; most notable in scenes depending on non-verbal dialogue. although, said scenes are probably my favorite among the entire film, most of them fall short on an emotional level—just as the emotions are about to hit a gut punch, the scene is cut off. by all means, this is not a perfect film. still, it doesn't take away from the very real and grounded moving story that is sunshine.",2025-07-28,2,3,watch,True

legendaryl06,9,"The chaotic rhythm of life.Spoilers ahead.Bold and controversial, writer-director Antoinette Jadaone continues her non-romantic-comedy streak with another compelling and dark subject matter through ""SUNSHINE"". Gracing the screen is the titular character, played by Maris Racal in her career-best performance, who finds out she's pregnant while she prepares for her Olympic-qualifying event. Trouble ensues, dream and ambition crash.Teenage pregnancy and women conditions take front and center as the film gives voice to the usual silenced of the society. Jadaone may have placed rhythmic gymnastics in the background but it excellently serves as a metaphorical tool to describe the ebb and flow of Sunshine's life. We see her struggles pitted against conservativism and arguable morality in a country where religion and patriarchy rule and shackle. Through magic realism where we are introduced to two young players who abruptly show up mid-scenes, the film gets a rich layer on how our lead navigates her perilous journey. They channel the moral compass though at times their appearances and comedic flair tend to be uneven and out of timing. Racal, with her sharp strength and vulnerability, is utterly commendable but so is her supporting cast - Jennica Garcia and Meryl Soriano as her strong-willed yet nurturing older sister and coach respectively, Annika Co as her unborn child manifestation (an unpredictable plot twist that eventually made sense), and even the cameos from Madeleine Nicolas, Angeli Bayani, Angie Castrence, Elijah Canlas, and Piolo Pascual fulfill their impressive character actor repertoire. Some arcs and scenes could have been fleshed out because it's got a premise worth exploring but the Philippine censorship may have played its upper hand to prevent the film's full bloom. In the same vein of ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days"", ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"", and ""Happening"", it may not be everyone's cup of tea due to its hefty topic and open-endedness but it's a delight to see an important Filipino film that fearlessly opens the conversation to empower women more on making their own reproductive choices, even with the deafening noise and outdated discourse.Quiapo.

shanslayyy,10,"Been eyeing this film since last year. Fortunately enough, I was able to watch this yesterday with my Mom. In the midst of darkness and rain, we looked for Sunshine.It adds surrealism without sacrificing its groundedness. Remember crying in a few scenes just because of how real it felt and then that sudden realization hits me, and I remember — nangyayari talaga siya sa totoong buhay yet it's inadequately addressed. Alienated, discriminated, and hidden behind idols and symbols stained with shame like the Sunshines and Menggays who are forced to comply with the rules set by a patriarchal, hypocritical, conservative society. I think this film won't force you to agree with its message but it challenges our morals and belief system. Above all, it only asks to be understood. There's multiple shades of womanhood that's not confined within a black and white backdrop. And it's good that we start and continue to talk about it. Overall, this film isn't just about abortion — it's a critique on society, politics, and feminism. As well as a call for women's accessible reproductive healthcare.Ps. Dahil sobrang lakas ng ulan pagpunta namin ng nanay ko sa sinehan, halos basa na likod namin, especially likod niya. I had to buy her a blanket (which she had in her back while watching the film).

sanenotsane,10,"Grabe gets ko na bat sya award winning.Before I even entered the cinema, prepared na aq mag cry cry. I saw the trailer, the interviews, and the podcasts so I was bracing myself for emotional confrontations and intense family drama pero wala so what really made me cry was how real everything felt. The way Sunshine just tried to carry on, the way Jennica quietly supported her, and the way the story showed how painfully human this situation is. There was so much honesty in how it was told. Pogi din ni Papa P.As a woman who has experienced a teen pregnancy scare before, I saw parts of myself in Sunshine. That helpless feeling, the fear of not knowing what to do, the shame, and the silence around it… It was all too familiar. I also have friends who’ve gone through it for real. They shared their stories, and as I watched the film, I could see their experiences mirrored by Sunshine.Maris Racal is amazing as Sunshine. Everything about her performance was convincing, from the way she moved to the way she spoke (pero direk kita yung face ng double ni Sunshine ha 😭😂). She really looked like a young athlete from a struggling family, someone whose life revolved around discipline and dreams until it all came crashing down. I’ve seen Maris in different roles before, like in Incognito, where she played this aircon ex-military girly na mukhang ginagawang pangbahay ang gucci, it’s rlly impressive how she completely transforms into Kanal Sunshine bc she doesn’t just act the part, she becomes it.Jennica also stood out for me. As Sunshine’s Ate, her presence was comforting throughout the film. She had this motherly vibe that felt very natural. I liked how the film gave her character depth without spelling everything out. You could tell that her love for Sunshine came from a place of experience, like she had her own quiet struggles too. Galing din ni Annika.Even the supporting casts delivered. The manghihilot, the abortion pill seller, the doctors and the people Sunshine met along the way weren’t just fillers. Their performances felt soooooo real, and they matched the tone of the film so well. I didn’t feel like I was watching actors, I felt like I was watching people actually living through these moments.Sa ibang indie films, I cringe when I hear characters cursing because it feels like the writers are just slapping random tangina words trying too hard to sound edgy or cool. But here, everything made sense. The dialogue flowed naturally. The curse words weren’t just for shock, they felt earned u know. One of the scenes that stayed with me was in the motel. It was quiet, then the sound of a train passing by filled the background. That sound stuck with me. It gave the scene so much weight. It felt like the world outside was moving forward, while Sunshine was stuck in a moment where everything felt uncertain. That kind of sound detail is the kind of thing I really appreciate.As someone na working din sa field, I couldn’t help but notice the small design details. Sunshine’s costumes were on point, from her jerseys na may ibat ibang year (aminin, pambahay natin mga intrams shirt 😂) to the athletic tapes on her body, to her bag full of pins and cute hair clips. Those little choices made feel convincing talaga. She looked like an actual teen athlete, not just someone pretending to be one.The scene in the church was another standout. She didn’t even go inside. She stayed outside and prayed, and that choice said so much. It was symbolic. It showed how distant she probably felt from her faith or how unworthy she thought she was in that moment. That kind of framing really hit me.I also appreciated the sound design. Instead of dramatic bg music, they focused ambient sounds. It gave everything a grounded feeling. It was like I was right there with her, experiencing everything in real time.The pacing was perfect. There were no awkward pauses, no scenes that felt unnecessary. Sa ibang movies, may moments na napapa-phone lang ako hahahah Every second mattered. Every moment added layers to the story. Even the locations were smartly chosen. They weren’t overly stylized. They felt like real places people actually live in and go through things in.Award ka talaga Sunshine. ☀️",2025-07-28,0,0,rewatch,True

jklstq,9,"Sobrang fitting na sunshine ang title ng pelikulang ito dahil katulad ni sunshine, may tapang, puso, at pagkakakilanlan ang pelikula. Matapang dahil bilang predominantly catholic country na sobrang na ka-angkla ang paniniwala, mga desisyon, at disposisyon sa buhay sa kung ano ang tama at mali sa bibliya, isang malaking hakbang ang ipakitang tumaliwas sa nakaugalian at kinalakihang ideya ng kung ano ang “tama”. Matapang dahil sa mundo at sa bansang sobrang patriyarkal na nag c-cater lamang sa kalalakihan, walang pag-uubling pinakita na wala dapat may ibang may karapatan sa katawan at kapakanan ng isang babae kung hindi sila lamang. Matapang kasi ilegal ang aborsyon sa pilipinas at imoral ang tingin sa mga taong gustong gawin ‘to pero walang tako’t na ipinakita na katulad ni sunshine, may mga babeng hindi ginusto at gustong maging ina at dapat ay may karapatan silang mamili. May puso kasi naguumapaw sa pagmamahal ang pelikula. Pagmamahal ng kapatid, kaibigan, mentor. At higit sa lahat ang pagmamahal sa kapwa babae. Ang pagmamahal na ipinakita ni sunshine kay menggay, ang pagmamahal na pinakita ni doctora helena sa kanilang dalawa. Masakit in a way pero sobrang gandang isipin na women will always have each other’s back at the end of the day. Walang titindig para sa isang babae nang lubos kung hindi babae lamang rin. Ngunit ang nangibabaw rito ay ang pagmamahal ni sunshine sa sarili niya at sa kanyang mga pangarap. May doubts si sunshine bilang isang babae, bilang isang katoliko. Kaya nga ilang beses natin siya nakitang nagdasal eh at kaya na rin nag e-exist ang karakter ni annika co. Siya yung nagsilbing physical form ng nagsalong upbringing at inhibitions ni sunshine pero at the end of the day, nanaig pa rin ang pagmamahal niya sa pangarap niya. Ang ganda, sobrang ganda. May pagkakakilanlan kasi sobrang pinoy na pinoy ‘tong pelikulang ito. Mula sa kung paano pinakita yung ingay at gulo ng maynila, hanggang sa dynamics ng magkakapatid sa pamilyang pilipino. Pati kung paano nabubuhay ang mga babae sa bansang bulok ang reproductive health system at hindi tanggap ang pagiging sexual nila. Sunshine is now my favorite maris racal performance which was previously held by peachy of Pamilya Ko. I know it’s the bare minimum and literally the point of acting but you can really tell she’s a good actress kasi walang bahid ng kung sino si maris racal sa totoong buhay sa mga karakter na ginagampanan niya. Sobrang believable niya as an actress. In my opinion, this is direk tonet’s best work to date. Her magnum opus so far. Also, jennica garcia is truly a fucking star. She owned every scene she had.

aegyu,9,"THISSS IS CINEMAAAA U GUYS 😭(YAS, edited w/ a short commentary)what i love about sunshine is it never tries to sell the idea that motherhood is innate, pure, or noble. instead, it asks the real question paano kung ayaw talaga? and it’s so bold to center that lalo na sa context ng pilipinas where everything about being a woman is reduced to sacrifice.we’re raised to believe na ang katawan natin ay para sa pamilya, para sa pananampalataya, para sa kinabukasan ng iba. never para sa sarili. kaya sobrang rare and sobrang radical makakita ng pelikula na nagsasabing ""hindi mo kailangang gustuhin. hindi mo kailangang magpaka-martir.”sunshine understands na abortion is not some abstract “debate” about morality. it’s lived. it’s embodied. it’s desperate. and it doesn’t look away from that. it shows us what women are actually left with when they’re denied safe and legal options. instructions sa papel, gamot na walang label, pangambang baka mamatay ka sa proseso. it doesn’t sensationalize it, but it doesn’t sanitize it either. and that’s where the power lies.the film knows the violence doesn’t start when a woman decides to abort. it starts when the state tells her she can’t. when even in the face of trauma, poverty, or kahit simpleng “hindi ko kaya"" o ""ayoko,"" the answer is always “wala tayong magagawa."" sunshine sits with that anger. nire-recognize niya na ang lack of choice ay isa lang sa napakaraming anyo o mukha ng systemic violence. patunay ito of how the law protects an imagined morality while punishing the actual living woman.and yes, this film is very aware that class makes all the difference. hindi lahat may access to private clinics or doctors willing to take the risk. karamihan, kung hindi lahat, gaya sa pelikula ay sa quiapo ang bagsak. o kaya naman hilot. 'yung iba wala talagang means & are forced to be victims of the way laws, culture, and religion collude to trap women into roles they never asked for. and that matters. because the way we talk about abortion in this country is always so detached from those realities. laging hypothetical. laging abstract. laging nakadikit sa spiritual na paniniwala. but sunshine shows that for many women, hindi lang siya tungkol sa pagkakaroon ng choice o sa moralidad kundi buhay at kaligtasan din nila mismo. literal na tinatanggalan sila ng basic human rights. ang sarap himayin ng pelikulaaa especially 'yung subplot tungkol doon sa 13-yr old girl tapos isampal 'yun sa mukha ng mga taong hindi magawang ilabas ang sarili nila sa personal nilang mga baluktot na paninindigan.ig the best part for me is how sunshine never tries to justify. likeee it doesn’t go “look, she had no choice,” or “she’s a victim, kaya understandable.” no. it says na kahit may support ka, kahit privilege ka, kahit hindi ka biktima, may karapatan kang pumili. and that, for me, is what makes it a GREAT feminist film. hindi siya nakikiusap sa audience na intindihin si sunshine. it tells you, plainly, na she owes you nothing.and maybe the most haunting part of this film is how it visualizes the weight of that decision. hindi bilang guilt or punishment but as memory. the film doesn’t erase the what-if. it shows you that even when a choice is right, it doesn’t come clean or easy. and that doesn’t make it wrong.FKK SOBRANG GALING LANG !!",2025-07-28,0,0,watch,False

melonmiruku,10,"A sunshine of hope in the dark, conservative alleys of Manila.This is a film that tackles what we Filipinos mostly shame women for: abortion. In this film, we see how the patriarchal society has a chokehold on our women. Men continue to crush the dreams of women, whether through abandoning them (ehem Miggy), ruining them (ehem Bobot), and deciding for their future (ehem Pastor Jaime).But not Sunshine.Despite everything, she persisted. She never gave up. Her trials and eventual triumphs gave a nice contrast to the setting: the dark alleyways of Quiapo. In the desolate streets, there she is continuing to shine. And can I just say, sobrang galing ni Maris! She really did justice in portraying the character. Additionally, I’d also like to commend Annika Co in her portrayal of the bata. Superb, she has potential! Her character is like an annoying voice of reason for Sunshine. Pero grabe, naluha ako in the end sa scene nilang dalawa.And Rhed Bustamante too as Mary Grace. Despite a short screen time, I felt that she was the soul of the movie. Through her, we saw how Sunshine comes to realize her fight for her dreams. Mary Grace was the bridge that Sunshine crossed to eventually come to her decision of persisting with her goals. I also liked how the women in the film supported each other. Thea, despite her mother not allowing her to hang out with Sunshine, showed up in the end. Coach Eden, who helped Sunshine realize her dreams.

jkcarandang,9,"Sunshine tried to open a discussion about a topic rarely talked about in the Philippines -- and in that aspect, I think it was already a success.For it to be played in Philippine cinemas is already a win for the film, on top of the other awards it has received abroad. In terms of the technical aspects, I liked how the film showed the beauty of Manila despite its flaws, how graceful rhythmic gymnastics look like despite being a tough sport, and how the venues mostly used in the film had enough space needed despite being cramped.Story-wise, I like how it tackled the problems of the Philippines in terms of reproductive health, but also showed the pro of being a mother -- or at least having a mother figure by your side. However, while I understand why Sunshine made that decision, I think it somehow lacked that oomph on why she was eventually convinced to do IT. What happened after THE TALK? Still, I believe Sunshine should be watched by many. Sunshine shows that one may be in a dark situation, but if you stand your ground and believe in what's best for you, then you know how or where to find the light.",2025-07-28T13:12:06.856Z,0,0,watch,False

Yung tipong sa huli she will choose to raise the child nalang and give up her dreams? God knows how I was sooo relieved when it did not end like that! I think and I hope this would be the start of the normalization of pro-choice Pinoy films! This is revolutionary in Philippine film landscape! It's something new and look where this movie went? T'was excellent overall, goosebumps ka for sure in some scenes. In our cinema, halos lahat parang nagcontemplate right after the film.

mattcvan,9,"A lot has already been said about this film—timely, important, brave. Sunshine is not great just because it tackles abortion, it welcomely invites us to be with its titular character. Every scene we are with her, and no scene is wasted. We know she got big dreams, and it's all she's ever known. We feel her despair, anger, and the facade through her smile. We see her make bad choices, but we understand why.I've seen a similar film in 2020, US's Never Rarely Sometimes Always. What sets Sunshine apart is it is set in the Philippines, a predominantly Catholic country. From the moment Sunshines wants to know about her status, judgment has already been cast upon her. People around her treat her as if she's some sort of contagious disease. Institutions, who are supposed to provide help, condemns her and gives a long-ass speech as if they're god. Yet, she finds a glimpse of hope in the most unlikely of places.Direk Tonet has proven to be one of the most versatile and essential modern directors in the Philippines. From her indie roots to her modern take of romcoms, she consistently has made semi-blockbuster memorable Filipino films. In her shift to sociopolitical drama, which already started in Fan Girl (2020), her voice as a female writer-director is clearer than ever. Hearing the germ of idea for this film got me intrigued, inspired from Jojo Rabbit (2019). At first, I was skeptical of this borrowed plot device, but it completely won me over and elevated the film in the end. Manila is captured as pure as it is. The score is played at the right moments, and so did pure silence.And of course, Maris Racal, the heart of this film. A year of training and research for the character paid off. She is Sunshine through and through! Her in that motel scene is raw and chilling to say the least. All the supporting actors and bit roles are just as great and gives life to Sunshine's world. Jennica Garcia may have a few lines, but her performance especially in that scene with Maris is one to be remembered for, especially for teenage mothers. A surprising yet worthy appearance comes from Rhed Bustamante, whose minor role made a huge impact on me—I cried!Sunshine is such a lightning in a bottle kind of Filipino film. Who would have thought that a great indie pinoy film about abortion is getting this high amount of traction and success? One's hope is for this to create discussion among us and to move the needle systemically for girls like Sunshine. (And as a cinephile, I hope more films like this get produced and be seen by Filipinos, because Philippine Cinema has always been alive!)",2025-07-24,0,0,watch,True

mangingibig,10,"Courageous. This is how I would describe the film. The way it speaks to and for society, portrays women's experiences, and challenges the pre-existing notions— the societal pressures, religious guilt, patriarchal norms—all were executed perfectly.One thing that I can't seem to stop thinking about is the personification of Sunshine's troubles. Some said it could be her conscience, maybe her guilt, maybe it's also the pressures society had brought upon women experiencing the same struggle, but I personally saw it as the personification of the child inside her. Kasi as a pregnant woman, one of the top things that she's probably considering the most would be the child (since it has been embeded into us that the child has a life as soon as it's formed). Ang galing lang kasi talaga ng portrayal na 'to and it keeps my mind gears churning. And that 'gets ko na'… I BAWLED.Sunshine is also one of the movies na mayroong ibang level of understanding yung mga babae, e no? A man could watch this and empathize, pero iba yung dating ng pelikulang ito lalo na sa mga babae sa Pilipinas. I would really only trust movies about women to women. Props to DIrek Tonet for this, really.Listing the things I love abt the movie here too!- Sunshine and the women she encountered…- Ang galing nung mga bata at ni Rhed tangina!!!???? - basagin ang ulo ng mga rapist >>>> magbasag ng bote sa ulo ng rapist- I have a lot more kaso my short term memory can't write it now because I'm logging this days late UGH.But It feels really freeing to see this kind of story sa theater, with a broader audience. Salamat sa matapang na pagbitaw ng mga salitang ""Ayaw kong maging nanay"" at ""Hindi pa ako handang maging nanay"" sa harap ng bansang ang tingin ay ito lang dapat ang kahihinatnan ng kababaihan.

Her depiction of realist Manila within a predominantly Catholic albeit judgmental Philippines is strikingly affecting, and the first half of this in particular is a worthy showcase of great filmmaking. The plot device did take me out of the film from time to time, and I do not think it was necessary nor was it effective. Yet, what more can you ask for when you have such a riveting turn from Maris Racal, who puts forward a performance for the ages.

n4sty,10,"“drown out the noise.”easier said than done when the noise is everything.the streets of Maynila. the train. the coach. the prayers. the stares. the guilt.Sunshine isn’t just a film about a girl with Olympic dreams and an unplanned pregnancy. it’s about how loud the world gets when you’re no longer allowed to dream. the kind of noise that follows you into cramped maternity wards, judgmental glances, and conversations that aren’t even about you, but your body.it’s claustrophobic — not just visually, but emotionally. the tight shots mimic how it feels to be backed into a corner: by family, religion, institutions, and the echo of “what will people say?” that never stops ringing. there’s no space to move. no time to think. just pressure.this is a strong film. one that dares to confront the Philippines’ obsession with purity, shame, and control. it pulls back the curtain on a country where reproductive health is taboo. it also shows the quiet fear around abortion — how it’s never really said out loud, but always there, hiding under the surface. a real choice that girls are never allowed to make. where the system will preach “life is sacred,” but give you a plastic chair in an overcrowded ward and leave you to figure it out alone.sure, it plays it safe sometimes — there are parts where you wish it pushed a little more. but it still says a lot, even in quiet moments.Sunshine doesn’t claim to have all the answers. but it knows the questions that need to be asked.about bodily autonomy. about access to care. about what it really means to grow up in a place that punishes girls for being girls.APAKAHUSAY NYO MS TONET AT MARIS!",2025-07-28,1,0,watch,True

Yung iyak ko sa scene nila ng ate niya!Ang lakas din maka catholic guilt nung doktora jusko po! pero sobrang makatotohanan sa disposisyon ng maraming pilipino sa usaping abortion. at TANGINA NI MIGGY WALA KANG KWENTA! nung nag ""i love you"" siya gusto ko nang pumasok sa eksena at hambalusin siya ng upuan.Ang sakit sa puso na may mga babae lalo na mga kabataan ang dumadaan sa delikadong paraan para magpalaglag. Nawa'y magsilbing eye opener ang Sunshine para ma-decriminalize ang abortion sa Pilipinas. It's high time na makapanood naman ng ibang pananaw ukol sa abortion hindi yung nakagawiang inaantagonize ito sa mga palabas.Sobrang tumatak sakin yung final scene ni Sunshine at bata habang pinapractice niya yung routine niya tapos nagyakapan sila at sinabi ni bata, ""gets ko na"".

It’s not easy to watch, but that’s exactly why it felt so real. What hit me the most was how the film didn’t try to be loud or preachy. The film doesn’t try to romanticize or a free promotion for abortion. It just let the silence do the work. Minsan iyak lang, minsan wala talagang salita. That makes it more powerful. Hindi ito simpleng kwento. It’s about pain, dreams, and mga choices na hindi talaga madaling pagpilian.Pero I have to say, may parts na medyo kulang for me. Sana mas dark yung cinematography, like Khalel 15 — gritty and raw. Lastly, hindi ito movie para sa lahat. But still, Sunshine gives us something real.

teriyak_,10,"Mula pa lang sa trailer, alam ko na—hindi ko puwedeng palampasin ang pelikulang ito. Direk Tonet ‘yan, eh. May tiwala ako sa kakayahan niyang gawing matula ang trahedya, at gawing tahimik pero mabigat ang mga sigaw ng kababaihan sa lipunang laging inuuna ang hiya kaysa sa hustisya.Isa sa mga personal na dahilan kung bakit ako nanood ay dahil gusto kong unawain—hindi man buo, pero kahit konti—kung ano ang dinadala ng isang babaeng katulad ni Sunshine. Bilang isang assigned male at birth, pero hindi ganap na komportable sa label na iyon, alam kong may distansya sa pagitan namin ni Sunshine. Pero iyon mismo ang dahilan kung bakit ako nanahimik sa sinehan. Tumigil akong mag-analisa, at hayaan ang pelikula na magsalita para sa sarili nito. Hindi ko kailangang maging babae para makiramay. Pero gusto kong makiramdam. At dito, sa pelikulang ito, nagtagumpay akong maramdaman si Sunshine—ang kanyang pagkalito, galit, at takot—na para bang sarili kong laman-loob ang kinikiskis ng eksena.At sa prosesong iyon, nadama ko si Sunshine—ang pagkalito niya na hindi simpleng pagkaligaw, kundi paglalakad sa isang landas na sinabihan siyang bawal. Ang galit niyang hindi mapagsigawan, at ang takot niyang hindi inamin, pero nandoon sa bawat kumpas ng katawan niya. Maris Racal didn’t just play Sunshine—she inhabited her. She carried her, as if every scene weighed heavily on her spine, even when she stood upright. May mga eksena na walang dialogue pero mas mabigat pa sa sigawan. At doon ko nakita ang mastery ni Maris bilang aktres: ang kakayahang magsalita gamit ang pananahimik.Nakakatawang may nagsabi raw sa likod ng kamera na “haggard” siya habang nagsu-shoot. I laughed—not because it’s funny, but because it’s too real. Ganito talaga ang hitsura ng kabataang babae na araw-araw tinatanggihan ang mundo, pero hindi puwedeng mapagod. May mga Sunshine sa Quiapo, sa mga post sa Reddit, sa mga comments na deleted, sa mga babae sa jeep na tahimik lang pero may bitbit na kwento. And it takes a film like Sunshine to remind us: they are not voiceless. We just haven’t been listening.Unang tingin kay Annika, iisipin mong comic relief siya. Isang batang gumugulo sa eksena, parang pang-balanse sa bigat ng naratibo. Pero habang tumatagal, na-realize kong siya pala ang pinakamatining sa lahat. Hindi siya ordinaryong karakter—siya ang konsensya ni Sunshine. Hindi ang moralistic kind, but the invasive kind. Yung konsensyang hindi laging tama o mali, kundi nagtatanong: “Nasaan ka na?” “Handa ka ba?” “Ito ba ang gusto mong piliin?” At dahil hindi laging consistent ang paglitaw niya—minsan parang guni-guni, minsan parang totoo—mas naging epektibo siya. Kasi hindi ba ganoon din ang konsensya? It creeps in when you're alone. It arrives uninvited. In a country where abortion is taboo, Annika becomes more than a person—she’s a presence. A question. A symbol of possibility and loss, but not in a way that condemns. She’s not there to judge Sunshine, but to make us feel what it means to carry a choice you can’t share with anyone. Sa isang bansang ang moralidad ay naka-template mula sa pulpito, ang pagkakaroon ng karakter tulad ni Annika is radical. Hindi siya plot device. Isa siyang reimaginasyon ng konsensya—hindi para ipahiya ang babae, kundi ipaalala kung gaano kabigat ang dalahin sa lipunang pilit silang pinatatahimik..Ang Sunshine ay hindi pelikulang pro-choice dahil gusto nitong makipagtalo. Hindi rin ito pelikula tungkol sa abortion dahil gusto nitong mag-skandalo. Ito ay pelikula tungkol sa karapatan. Sa kakayahang pumili, kahit pa masakit ang pagpiling iyon. Sunshine doesn’t celebrate abortion—it honors the courage to face it. Sa lipunang ang kababaihan ay kailangang laging malinis, laging mabait, laging matino, heto ang isang pelikulang nagsasabing: ang katawan mo ay hindi kasalanan. Ang pagpili mo ay hindi dapat katumbas ng pagkapako.Maraming salamat, Direk Tonet. Salamat sa hindi pag-ikot sa ligtas na naratibo. Salamat sa pagbibigay ng boses sa katahimikan. Salamat sa paghubog ng pelikulang hindi lang para sa kababaihan, kundi para sa lahat ng gustong matutong makinig.Bilang isang lalaki na walang MATRES, pero may malasakit sa mga may isa, ramdam ko ang urgency ng kwento. Sunshine is not a perfect film—but it is a vital one. And in a country that rarely gives women room to speak, a film like this doesn’t just feel brave. It feels necessary.",2025-07-28,1,0,watch,False
migueltheangelo,8,""" Drown out the noise.""This line in the Sunshine struck me after watching the film. Noise is considered as a plot device in the film literally and figuratively. I like how the background music or the noise from the background is used to set the tone and mood of the film especially in scenes where Sunshine is walking or riding a jeep home. Noise in the film can also represent the doubts that fill her while practicing and self-righteous religious people who judge her actions throughout the film.The film is about a gymnast who plans to join the tryouts for the Olympics. However, she receives a result that is unexpectedly pregnant which can hinder her chances in getting in. Maris Racal is great in her role as Sunshine and I think that she embodies the role of a gymnast especially since she tried gymnastics to prepare for her role. There were scenes that were remarkable for me such as when she tries to hit a the mirror of a car after her boyfriend (played by Elijah Canlas) doesn't take responsibility for her pregnancy. I also loved the supporting characters as well. Despite their small roles, they made a mark for me. For instance, Jennica Garcia was impressive in her scenes with Maris Racal as her older sister. You can feel that she defends and protects her sister and stay by her side especially during her revelation that she is pregnant. Xyriel Manabat is no surprise for me since I admire her acting skills since she was a child actress. She is great as Sunshine's best friend. Annika Co, an upcoming child actress, is a scene stealer where she acts as a conscience to Sunshine. She is charming and witty in her role and I think the twist made sense to me in one scene.In addition to it being a sports drama, this film also tackled the themes of women's choice and abortion. These topics are considered sensitive and taboo in a dominant Catholic and conservative society. As a man, this film moved me and realize how hard it is to be a woman in a society wherethey are judged for having an autonomy in their body. In a third world country, healthcare is considered a privilege especially for the poor. Because of abortion being considered illegal and immoral, women are forced to resort to unsafe practices which can endanger them. It is shown in the film and I think it's interesting that it depicted two doctors: one which discriminates women because of her religious bias and one which tried to understand and helped another character in the film who turned to abortion. It's a sad reality, but I'm glad that this film will open conversations about themes like these.Overall, I find Sunshine an impressive film. I think this is Antonette Jadaone's best film so far. It's my second film that I've seen in cinemas and I'm grateful to witness it in the big screen because it is worth the watch there with its immersive experience. I was definitely looking forward to it since it's rare to watch a sports film which centers around gymnastics and it has been shown in film festivals abroad. I was worried that it won't be shown here because of how controversial it would be because of the stand of the Catholic Church and other religious sectors regarding abortion. I guess more people are more open-minded towards the topics unlike before. Aside from the acting, what I found compelling in the film is the cinematography and scoring which adds tension and mood to the it. Despite its limited release and pitted against two superhero films during its premiere, I really hope more people will get a chance to watch this movie. Even if it shows the harsh realities of life and in sports, I agree with other film critics that it also shows hope. There is Sunshine after the rain.",2025-07-28,1,0,watch,False

giopuyat,10,"No doubt my favorite Jadaone film, Sunshine is not only an important work of art in a cultural context, but an objectively beautiful, clean and concise narrative work. What I mean is not a single frame is wasted, or given up for style points - every decision of performance, framing and pace is made to serve the story, to make us empathize with Sunshine, to feel what she feels.Woman vs the institution - the clarity of this theme is just so powerful, yet we’re brought into Sunshine’s world through masterful camerawork that just feels honest. There’s a shot I love, where Sunshine is framed inside a window (in her room then in a motel), and the chaos of the city goes on about her, uncaring and apathetic to her situation. That’s the whole movie - the slow-burning horror that she is being shunned by society, cramped into tiny spaces trying to survive. It made me cringe to hear the chants of “Pilipinas” by the crowd in her performance at the end (the sad reality of Filipino athletes, unsupported in training yet celebrated in victory)Maris Racal’s best performance. The care and dedication she brought to the role should be applauded. Everyone else in the movie is so dialed in too, a subtle superpower of Direk Tonet’s ear for relatable acting and dialogue. Also love the Pastor P appearance, who brings such an important discussion into the public consciousness.

ciandreia,10,"“drown out the noise.”sunshine tramples on both internal and external noises—judgment, fear, catholic guilt, and desperate prayers; the chaos that quietly unfolds in the dark streets of manila, and the ironies existing at the heart of folk-catholicism as underground, unsafe abortion exists steps away from a sacred ground. it’s impossible for sunshine—for women—to drown out the noise. My favorite detail in this movie is the portrayal of different women, each with her own turmoil, resources, and stage in life, struggling in a deeply patriarchal and faith-bound society, while still finding the strength to stand for each other. wala nang ibang makakaunawa at dadamay sa paghihirap ng pagiging babae kundi kapwa mga babae.this film is dark, heavy, and uncomfortable to watch (as it should) but necessary. it shatters your core and makes you question how far can religious ideas go in a hostile and punishing society.

She never had a choice. I'm happy that she is my mother. But it also hurts me to know that she could be in a better place -pursuing her dreams, seeing the world - if not because of me.

robbgc,3,"SUNSHINE advances itself as a film about bodily autonomy in a nation that denies its very terminology, yet it does so through the insulated idiom of psychological realism rather than the concretised mapping of the material conditions that make autonomy, abortion, and girlhood existentially precarious. We are immersed in affect, but the structure underpinning these sensations is left either ambient or altogether unrendered. Yes, the pharmacy exists as a moral space and the hospital as carceral, but where is the livelihood? Who funds the training? What does it mean, materially, to be a 19-year-old athlete—and an international one, at that—with no visible labouring parent and no bread line to back it up?Abortion is outlawed in the Philippines because it preserves state-church power and results in the reproductive labour of the poor as exploitable and their agency criminal, but to bracket class from the narrative—in a context where economic vulnerability is the foremost determinant of reproductive injustice—is consequential. Instead, the endless deferral into mood, while expressive, is in itself a seductive alibi for political disengagement. I understand that this is a film of interiority—that the point is to reflect Sunshine’s constrained perceptual field—but her interiority is a response to economic realities that the film chooses to elude, and when the audience is asked to interpolate systemic weight from ambience without any clear depiction of how deprivation functions, what we get is an abstraction that parades as empathy, and from that abstraction, other evasions proliferate: the neoliberal myth of the meritocratic athlete, whose suffering must be understood as psychological strain rather than as infrastructural abandonment; the convenient fiction that ambition alone propels a body through state-sponsored regimes without subsidy or the material realities the film forgoes. To abstract oppression into psychic distress then, while refusing its logistical origins, is to risk reproducing the same symbolic economy the Church relies upon: one in which the body is meaningful only as a metaphor and a vessel onto which morality is projected.This aesthetic disposition of interiority is of course obviously a structure inherited from the exportable idiom of European festival realism where the trauma of the Filipina is depicted legibly for the global North. From this perspective, it would make sense that the institutions that manufacture her precarity are rendered as emotional rather than historical, inviting the audience to feel with her but never to account—but by doing so, what emerges is not so much a Filipino film but a Filipino offering: an artefact of pain rendered in tones familiar to jurors abroad, a choice that aligns seamlessly with both (1) Jadaone’s career pivot into the international circuit, having premiered the film at Berlinale and TIFF, and (2) the film’s own final sequence: Sunshine performing her routine at the SEA games before a panel of foreign adjudicators, body taut and calibrated for approval by those who will never understand the weight of what she forfeited to arrive there. By naming these two parallels do we metabolise the rage of a system into something palatable and interpretable, and since both Jadaone and Sunshine must contort to be seen, in being seen, they are asked to become less what they mean. Perhaps the question is not whether SUNSHINE fails as a film or recedes as an offering, but whether it was ever permitted the autonomy to be anything else—whether within the landscape of Philippine cinema, where funding is precarious, distribution systems anaemic, and state culture support present only for the films that do not threaten it, a film like SUNSHINE must already enter the frame pre-legibilised and pre-digested, its rage ironed out for export. This is, after all, by the admission of its own producer Bianca Balbuena, a film that delayed its domestic release in order ‘to premiere in top festivals [around] the world to create noise and curiosity’, with the implication that only through international approval could the film attain enough value to justify its own existence at home. Thus, to resist the very circuit that enables its existence is impossible, but recognising this sharpens our understanding of the conditions under which those evasions occur. What we must ask, then, is what kind of complicity we are willing to forgive in a nation that punishes truth so severely that even its cinema must contort just to be heard.",2025-07-28,46,1,watch,False

pandaigdig,9,"Quiapo has always felt like a contradiction. It's a district that thrives on both holiness and hustle, tradition and survival, all crammed into claustrophobic, identical alleyways. At its heart stands a towering church, surrounded by vendors selling everything: street food, religious images, herbal medicines, fake documents, sex toys, and abortion kits – pamparegla. The irony writes itself. And yet, that's where people are forced to go when they're desperate. Like Sunshine.Sunshine (Maris Racal) is a gymnast on the rise who discovers she's pregnant before a major competition – just as her future starts to tighten around her. The plot is simple, but never small. What unfolds is a slow, steady panic of a young woman trying to figure things out in a country that offers her no real choices. You feel the weight that she's carrying, not just in her silence, but in her body. She's holding so much in, almost willing it all to be a fever dream. But beneath that restraint is a quiet rage — in her posture, in her breath, in the way she fights to keep it all together.The movie doesn't try to frame anything as heroic or tragic, and that's what makes it powerful. What stood out most to me was how angry, how fearless, it allows itself to be. It simmers. Controlled, but with crushing intensity. This is Direk Tonet's best work to date. It's her most honest and her most focused. And you can tell she did this with immense care. The love is in the details.",2025-07-24,3,1,watch,True

[4:46AM] iba yung alam mo lang, sa naiintindihan mo talaga. staying informed is one thing, but feeling it? letting it crack something open in you? ibang usapan ‘yon.alam kong masama ang aborsyon sa mata ng simbahan. lumaki akong alam 'yon; itinuro, inulit, pinaniwalaan. alam ko rin kung paano siya tinitignan ng lipunan, ng batas, ng sistemang matagal nang hindi pumapanig sa kababaihan. isang sistemang feudal, patriyarkal, mapanghusga. pinalaki tayo rito, pinalo, pinatahimik.pero alam ko rin ito: may karapatan ang babae. sa sarili niyang katawan. sa sarili niyang desisyon. at sa healthcare na hindi dapat ipinagmamakaawa, kundi kusang ibinibigay. alam ko rin na hindi dapat tinitingnan ang aborsyon sa lente ng kasalanan o krimen, na para bang awtomatikong mali ang pagpili, at masama ang pumipili. pero ang hindi ko alam, ang hindi ko kailanman mararanasan sa ganap na paraan, ay kung ano ang pakiramdam. ang bumangon araw-araw dala ang bigat ng isang desisyong walang tama sa paningin ng lahat. ang labanan hindi lang ang sarili mong konsensya, kundi ang mundong hindi kailanman kinilala ang pinagdadaanan mo, ang takot mo, ang dahilan mo.yun ang hindi ko alam. at yun ang pinaramdam sa akin ng Sunshine.and i think that's where Sunshine really succeeds. it doesn’t glorify. it doesn’t argue. it simply shows. it gives us a glimpse. into a life of a young woman, into her choice, into her pain, and the kind of quiet strength we rarely talk about. gusto lang talaga ng pelikula magkuwento tungkol sa isang babae. ang dami kong gustong himayin. but if there’s one thing that stayed with me, it’s this: Sunshine gives voice to stories we rarely hear. and maybe we avoid them kasi nga masakit. mabigat. kasi hindi tanggap ng kultura at sistemang kinalakihan natin. uncomfortable. but that’s exactly why they need to be told.what makes the film powerful is how intentional it is. every frame, every silence, every turn it didn’t take. lahat may dahilan. it could’ve been more clever. it could’ve been more dramatic. pero hindi siya nagpakitang gilas. instead, ginamit niya ‘yung simplicity para tumama. para magpa-reflect. para magpa-isip.what i appreciated most was that it didn’t force me to take a side. it didn’t try to tell me which choice was right, no matter what sunshine ended up deciding. it just asked me to listen. to sit with sunshine. to be there with her. even when things were loud & messy, even when she herself didn’t know what to do. and sometimes, that’s all people need. not answers. just space. and empathy. maraming empathy. Sunshine moved me to empathize in ways i didn’t expect i could.gusto ko rin pala i-highlight kung paano naging karakter ang maynila rito. magulo ang maynila. marumi. maingay. minsan bitag, pero minsan daan palabas. minsan parang impyerno, pero minsan parang tanging lugar na may pag-asa. sunshine moved through its chaos looking for clarity, and somehow the city mirrored her confusion. klaustro ang mga eskinita pero may mga puwang. noisy yet full of silences. manila is hysterically cruel, yes. brutal sa babae, sa mahirap, sa pagod. pero sa likod ng lahat ng ‘yon, may mga sulok na mabait. tahimik. marunong makinig. may tenderness na hindi nagpapakita, pero nandiyan; in the people who care quietly, in the moments of stillness in between the noise.and god, maris. maris fucking racal. this is hers. this is every woman’s story. she is a woman in every way that matters. alam kong magaling na siya dati pa. nakita ko na rin naman ang ibang trabaho niya. but this time, iba. masarap sa pakiramdam na makita ang isang magaling na babae na hindi nakakabit sa loveteam, walang lalaking bitbit sa screen para lang matawag na lead. walang kilig, walang branding. sakanya lang talaga ito. and that felt right. that felt important.the way she portrayed sunshine’s pain and stillness and quiet strength, it just hit. hindi siya umaarte. she wasn’t trying to convince anyone. she just was. may mga eksena na wala siyang sinasabi, pero ramdam mo lahat. nakakaiyak siya, pero hindi dahil may music o linyang mabigat. nakakaiyak kasi totoo. kasi hindi mo alam kung saan ka huhugot ng ginhawa sa pinagdadaanan niya.totoong haggard nga siya buong palabas hahaha, and it just made so much sense. ganun talaga ang itsura ng babae na napagod na. sa sarili. sa mundo. sa kakaisip ng tama. sa sistema na walang binibigay na sagot. and yet she kept going. and yet she was still trying. that look—the mess, the confusion, the exhaustion, that’s what a woman in the middle of a fight looks like. not dramatic. just human.maris, sa’yo talaga ito. no one else could’ve done it this way. no one can take this away from you. and i hope alam mo kung gaano kahalaga ang binigay mo sa pelikulang ‘to.and the women around sunshine, sila rin ang puso ng kwento. sa mata pa lang ng bawat isa, kita mo agad. hindi sila filler. hindi sila background. si jennica garcia, si annika co, si xyriel manabat, atbp. pati yung mga sandaling lumitaw lang, ang doktor, ang bantay sa motel, yung pharmacist sa botika, yung babae sa quiapo, maski yung mga babae sa maternity ward. lahat sila may dala. lahat sila may pinanggagalingan. and they all stood with sunshine in one way or another. iba-iba sila, pero iisa ng tinig. kababaihan ang nagdala ng pelikula. kababaihan ang gumising sa kwento.Sunshine isn’t easy to watch, especially if you're a woman in this country— but maybe it’s not meant to be. kasi tunay na kwento siya. and real stories don’t always comfort. they challenge. they disturb. they demand something from you. and that’s what this film did. it made me feel. it made me think.sobrang ganda napasulat tlg ako ng review. i had to sit with it for an hour or two. ang husay mo direk tonet!",2025-07-29,2,0,watch,True

Sunshine falls under one of my most favorite genres: social commentary by simply showing girls just trying to live. You can see throughout the film that she’s just a girl. Asking Miggy for money, asking for help when she needs, acts on her impulse, has dreams and goals, using twitter and Reddit for research (#real), etc. She knows she can’t take care of a whole ass child right now, all she can (and she should) do is to chase her dreams and make a career out of it.Though you can also see that Sunshine doesn’t really hate the kid. She takes care of her the way she can– giving her money to get home, looking for her when she’s lost, protects her from adult themes (drinking, abortion, etc). So her decision at the end, it’s not because she hates the kid, it’s because she loves herself. With the limited choices she had, she made the most out of her youth And what’s so wrong with that?

It urges us to feel and think through its subtlety. Jadaone’s placement of Sunshine’s body within the harshness of Manila is a political act.

Baka maging susunod na presidente ng pilipinas o baka makahanap ng gamot sa aids, oo. Pero paano naman si Sunshine, na isinasang tabi ang karapatan, na para bang pinuputulan niyo ng pakpak makalipad. Paano naman si Sunshine, na mas mataas ang potensyal—National teams, SEA Games, kahit maging sa Olympics pa.Lumabas ako sa sinehan at naririnig ko ang kanya-kanyang diskurso ng mga nanood.

Pinapahalagahan ng pelikula ang usaping abortion pero hindi nito binubura ang aspetong moral ng ganoong gawain.

Annika is a star in the making. She impressed me so much in this, especially in the scene where they head to the hospital. It’s definitely a scene that will stick with me for a long time. Jennica’s performance also stuck with me (as a panganay~)Manila is presented so cruel, yet so kind in those moments where Sunshine finds help. I’ve seen a couple of other films talking about abortion in the Philippines (Hinugot sa Langit and 12 Weeks specifically), but I think this one struck me the most. I found this to be extremely nuanced, the presence of the kids and their roles in Sunshine’s life really made me think. I’m still not a hundred percent sure how I feel about their presence, but I appreciate that it made Sunshine’s plight something to really think about.I also appreciated the ending, I think we often see a remorseful side post-abortion for female characters here. But I’m glad we get to see someone who gets to move on and continue to dream, to live.I also thought about the other women I’ve heard about going through similar situations.

God knows how much she desired the big stage. as said by Doc Helena, our God is a forgiving god; the statement echoes towards the ending as sunshine weighed out her choices. it was not a matter of letting something go, it was a matter of reaching for something that was always there. ika nga, talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not; and for sunshine, she grabbed the chance. gripped it hard. never letting it out of her touch. and ceased it like it was her last chance—it was. i loved this movie too much. social class, reproductive rights, healthcare, religion, mixed with the right amount of comedy all married into one thought-provoking film. mabuhay ang pelikulang pilipino!",2025-07-29,1,0,watch,False

mico_orda,5,"It's decent to say the least, it's a Jadaone movie for Jadaone fans. But that's the thing, it's myopic that it themes and logic of the narrative presented is as only limited as the filmmaker's worldview to say the least, or rather it is limited to how Jadaone sees the subject matter in regards to abortion and having an agency which is told in such a simplistic way, lacking that empathy and how objective it is. However, I commend the script to call out against the prejudiced perception but that's how it is, it did not hold accountable to it, and while Sunshine had conviction to make her decision in the end, and matters in her own hands, it didn't feel unearned to be honest. Like who is Sunshine to the audience, as a main character? Why do the audience should root for her, I think the screenplay failed to make its audience care and thank god Maris Racal made it somehow work because she did put effort to act in those dramatic scenes and it shows she's into that role, kudos for putting an extra work on gymnastic scenes.But in some light hearted scenes, it felt like she didn't convey those emotions that at times it felt monotone. She could've shown a more human and relatable side of Sunshine.It didn't helped that the runtime could've expanded or improve some things that were lacking, but overall the film did ok. Lastly, I have a message to those who are invoking Brocka's name or likening it to the film or the filmmaker: ""keep his name out of your mouth.""",2025-07-29,2,0,watch,False

seaofnostalgia,9,"“pasalamat ka kay Papa God.” pasalamat ka para sa sining ng pagpepelikula.madali lang naman mahalin ang pelikulang ito. tulad ng pagmamahal sa mga bagay na pinaniniwalaan at pinaninindigan mo: madali, simple, at walang pag-aalinlangan.there is no doubt that i would love this film effortlessly because the direk tonet jadaone formula never fails in empowering women in their strongest moments; and even more so in their struggles in the fucked up reality of living in a third world country where they are robbed of their freedom to choose.i loved all the little details in sunshine’s home; the subtle reference to problematic people supporting fascists and corrupt politicians; and the way the city of manila is captured in all of its colors, filth, and beauty—showing us familiar roads and alleyways, reminding us of the vibrancy and dullness of the thousands of lives that passed us by.but what struck me the most is the irony of abortion pills being illegally sold where you can buy a statue of Sto. Niño, an image of the Child Jesus who was born from an unplanned pregnancy (albeit God-willed and wholeheartedly accepted by Mary if you’re Catholic). because much like this visual, i do believe that devotion to God and the right to choose for yourself are not mutually exclusive. if you’re using your belief to shun others instead of understanding them, then you’re not living up to your faith.i’ve said it before in past movie reviews—to me, unsafe abortions are the most horrific thing you can show your audience and i’ve seen two other films before, one more vivid than the other. but this one in sunshine is the most painful and depressing. hihilingin mo talaga na sana walang babae sa mundo ang makaranas nito. how can something regarded as the source of life drain the life out of a woman? ang pinakamahirap lunukin na katotohanan ay mayroon at mayroong mga babaeng makakaranas nito kung hindi magkakaroon ng maayos na sex education sa ating mga paaralan at hanggat walang access ang lahat sa reproductive health at safe abortions sa bansa. saludo ako sa tapang mo, direk tonet, to show something no other director of today is not afraid to do so.naniniwala akong ang kababaihan ang pinagmulan ng mundo. quite literally, babae ang nagdala at nagluwal sa ating lahat. kaya maraming salamat sa pelikulang ito dahil nabigyan ng spotlight hindi lang ang mga babaeng tulad ni sunshine at ni mary grace, pero pati na rin ang mga babaeng tulad ng ate ni sunshine, kaibigan niyang si thea, ang kanyang coach eden, si doctor helena, at pati na rin ang babaeng bantay sa avenida inn na walang pag-aatubiling tumulong sa kanya. this is womanhood, ika nga. marahil para sa’yo, ang mga babaeng ito ay iyong ina, ate, kapatid, pinsan, kaibigan o kasintahan. pero isa lang ang sigurado, may mga babae sa buhay nating nagsisilbing kakampi natin sa araw-araw at dapat lang silang bigyang-pugay at pasalamatan.(please stop reading at this point if you don’t want spoilers for the ending!)at first, i thought annika’s character is sunshine’s manifestation of her younger self or her inner child that serves as her conscience in every decision she makes. but when we’re introduced to ariana, it’s finally clear to me that they were sunshine’s manifestation of the unborn babies from her and mary grace’s unwanted pregnancies. this is why that “gets ko na” scene is so powerful! because after relentlessly asking for forgiveness from God for reasons she couldn’t fully understand, she finally forgives herself for choosing herself and her dreams. minsan ay may ni-repost si direk sa twitter and it is all about the paths our mothers did not take when they chose to love us instead. when i read that, i just cried. obviously, i am thankful my mama chose me but honestly, i would’ve understood if she didn’t.i am glad i chose to watch this spontaneously on a work night (thank you, biancake, sa biglaang aya!) kahit nakipagsapalaran ako mula makati hanggang sta. mesa, tumakbo sa extension sa pagitan ng estasyon ng doroteo jose at recto para mahabol ang simula, at naglakad sa madilim at mataong lugar sa harap ng isetann para sumakay sa jeep pa-españa. dama ko ang maynila sa hangin sa daan at nasisilayan ko ang buhay nito sa mga taong nagsisiuwian. hiling ko lang na sa bawat tahanang nalalagpasan ng aking sinasakyan, may mga babaeng naaabot ang pangarap nang hindi nahihirapan.thank you, Papa God. thank you, para sa Sunshine.",2025-07-29,2,0,watch,False

kitchienadoll,10,"I can already imagine the discourse once marelease to sa VOD. First of all, I think it is so bold of Jadaone to come up with a concept that is so simplistic yet so real and full of grit despite the subject’s thematic weight. Abortion remains to be a debatable matter in the Philippines and opinions are always highly polarized among liberals and conservatives. Despite the country’s right-wing political ideologies, there are still calls from progressive groups urging the government to legislate better constitutions on health and reproductive rights for the benefit of those who need it most. Sunshine happens to be one of these people.Sunshine is a dedicated gymnast and an aspiring Olympian. With only a few weeks left to polish and brush up on her routine, she suddenly found herself in a bind that put her faith, morals, and self-worth to the test. The film doesn’t let us stay in a hopeful frame of mind; rather, it propels us to empathize with the character and question whatever is wrong and fucked up with the system. When Sunshine found out she was pregnant, her first instinct was to get rid of it. Pray it away. End it even if it means drowning in a cycle of self-destructive behaviors. It was clear from the very start she didn’t want to push through and she held onto that. I guess that’s as far as I can go for now so as to not give away too much of the plot.I watched this alone sa sinehan kanina and as soon as the credits rolled, i overheard someone sa likod ko saying na ‘bitin’ daw, and i totally get the sentiment that maybe for some people medyo half-baked or kulang ang storya. But sometimes, films don’t have to be loud in order to hit the right spots. With its very straightforward premise and message, I think Sunshine deserves the amount of hype it’s getting.The sports industry is already overwhelmingly taxing and having to face added burdens brought about by unwanted pregnancy can be way more damaging than one can fathom. Sunshine is not a film that will convince you to change your moral and political convictions; rather, it clings to the little hope of making the audience understand that the dilemma Sunshine had to face isn’t something that exists only in the reel world, but something that is very much present in the real world—in a society where bodily autonomy often comes at a social cost.Above all else, one thing’s clear is we really need better and safer reproductive laws in the Philippines so women wouldn’t have to go through under-the-table practices that put their lives on the brink of death. However, with the current political climate, i guess it’s realistic to assume we’re still a little far off. But with films like Sunshine, I’d like to think there’s still an ounce of hope for our country to perhaps embrace ideals that give primacy to women’s autonomy and rights, at the very least.",2025-07-29,6,0,watch,True
ayesak21,10,"“Gets ko na.”I think Sunshine is Direk Tonet’s best work yet. It is simplistic, raw, and bothering but it is wrapped in a cute pink ribbons that seeks to hide the harsh truths women in our society face. The bits of humor at times give audiences a space to laugh and forget how heavy the message of the film is and then it just hits you with its narrative and the core message behind it. My favorite scene was the conversation between Ariana and Bata, it was both pro life and pro choice which may be a hard thing to pull off but the team did it effortlessly. I loved how raw and unfiltered it is and how it became a eureka moment for the other audiences. I am in no way fit to write a long ass review about the them of the film because stories like these are rooted in everyday struggles of women in such violent and patriarchal society.

kimmmmiko,7,"Habang nasa kalagitnaan ng pelikula, nasabi ko na lamang sa sarili ko, “Para saan ba talaga ‘tong pelikula na ‘to? Ano bang point nito?” Yun pala, ako lang ang hindi agad naka-gets.Ang fucked up lang kasi isipin kung yung bata ay literal na physical manifestation ng nasa tiyan ni Sunshine, parang anim na taong gulang na anyo ng dapat sana’y magiging anak. Mas fucked up pa kasi kinokonsensya niya si Sunshine (tinawag siyang murderer). Pero later on na-realize ko: hindi siya totoong bata, kundi visual representation lang ng internal conflict ni Sunshine. Siya yung konsensya. Siya yung maliit na boses sa loob. Siya rin si Sunshine.Kaya hindi talaga tungkol sa journey ni Sunshine sa pag-abot ng mga pangarap niya ang pelikula. Mas tungkol ito sa batang karakter—na hindi rin pala talaga bata—at sa mas malawak na karanasang pangkababaihan. Kasi sa totoo lang, ang kwento ng abortion ay hindi tungkol sa bata. Ito ay tungkol kay Sunshine. Sa mga babae. Sa mga may katawan. Sa mga may kakayahang magdesisyon para sa sarili nila.Maganda naman ang ending. Medyo parang Modess commercial nga lang (charot). Pero kung tatanungin ako, feeling ko may kulang. Bilang manonood, hindi ko gaanong naramdaman ang bigat ng emosyon. Kulang sa lalim. Kulang sa hugot. Pero nabawi naman sa pagganap ng mga aktor—walang tapon, mahusay ang lahat.Isang halimbawa ng kakulangan sa emotional connection para sa akin ay yung eksenang umiiyak si Sunshine sa loob ng inn habang isinasagawa ang abortion. Malapit na akong bumigay nun, ramdam na ramdam ko na, pero biglang nag-cut to a shot from outside the window of her emoting and yung maingay na traffic. Aesthetic, oo. Maganda, pero di ko gusto. Parang sinampal ako pabalik sa reyalidad na, “Hoy, hindi ka kasama sa kwento.” Saksi ka lang. I don’t know about you guys, but I don’t like that.Favorite scene ko siguro ay yung early scene sa pelikula, yung umiiyak si Sunshine sa jeep. Maingay sa simula, tapos unti-unting tumahimik habang nakatutok lang ang lente sa kanya. Ang galing nun. Ang ganda. In addition, siksik sa intensyon ang mga detalye—katulad ng painting sa unahan ng jeep na may nakasulat na “Gift from God.” Hala siya, eh di ikaw na ang tumanggap. (charot)Anyways, ang dami kong nasabi. Pero ngayon na lang naman ‘to. Ang galing ni Maris.

It has the power to connect, to spark meaningful conversations, and to heal.The film doesn't ask you to take a side or change your stance, instead it offers perspective. It doesn't scream any agenda on you, instead it quietly holds your hand and asks you to listen. This film made me realize just how unfair this world can be to women.

As a man, it opened my eyes around struggles I'm privileged not to face, but must learn to understand.Sunshine champions women with deep care and honesty, and Tonet Jadaone continues to be one of the most important voices in Philippine cinema today.

GOD i love this film sm. i do think it’s a good first step in addressing abortion in contemporary PH cinema. we are doing this film a disservice if we expect it to fully encompass the extent of nuances of this experience. what we can hope for, perhaps, is the exploration of more nuanced stories like sunshine’s to be seen and heard.",2025-07-30,3,0,watch,True

Sa bawat eksenang naggi-gymnastics siya, ramdam mo ang goals at motivation ng karakter niya. Tunay nga na siya si Sunshine, siya ang liwanag. Ang bawat eksena sa loob ng training court ay nagmistulang higaan ng dilaw na liwanag, puno ng pangarap, dedikasyon, at pag-asa.Pero sa tuwing lalabas siya ng gym, sa tuwing aalis siya sa mundo ng gymnastics, unti-unting dumidilim ang paligid. Ang bahay nila, na nasa gitna ng nakakasulasok na usok ng Maynila. Ang pampublikong ospital na kalunos-lunos ang itsura. Ang mga kalsada ay madilim, makulimlim, nakakalunod ang ilaw.

grcceries,8,"I LOVE THIS SO MUCH 🥹 two things: (1) you already know my gripe with movies nowadays being too self-aware, esp when making commentary on social issues (e.g. through infodump dialogues and/or in-your-face monologues). given the themes of this movie, i was initially scared that this'll end up having the same issue— but THANK GOD that wasn't the case here. this one actually took the effort to situate us in Sunshine's shoes. it knew how to convey Sunshine's story by fleshing out the world that she lives in, by showing how she relates to others, by showing us the things she does not do and does not say. this movie knows how to practice restraint! that's how it managed to really make Sunshine shine :D(2) i love that this movie makes a very decisive stance on abortion, without having uhhhh such a cold attitude towards children. like, never once did Sunshine change her mind about having an abortion, and this movie also made several strong cases about how motherhood disadvantages/endangers women— but it also makes it clear that the problem is not... the babies/children? in fact the children are also victims here, as shown in Ariana's case. instead of being shown as ~the problem~ pa nga, this movie instead shows us that children may symbolize hope and companionship and possibilities. the unwanted pregnancy made life difficult for both Menggay and Ariana— but wasn't it Ariana, still, who stood up for Menggay? what Sunshine went through throughout the entire film was difficult and isolating— but she wasn't exactly alone, was she? hindi man niya gusto 'yung bata, there was a part of her that sought comfort from the possibility of the child's companionship. i think it's just human nature, yenno, to seek connections from others when going through a difficult time. and when you live in a society where you can't disclose all these troubles to anyone, not even to those closest to you— whose companionship can you seek, if not your own flesh that's taking shape into another life? sino pa ba ang mas makakaintindi sa 'yo kundi ang sarili mong laman at dugo? yeah in practice that may not be true LOL kaya nga ipinaabort pa rin ni Sunshine eh xD kahit anong ""romantic"" ng notion na susuportahan ka ng anak mo anuman ang pangarap mo, that's practically impossible when its very existence is what could hinder you from reaching them lol. pero ayun nga, it's the difficulty of the situation and our human vulnerabilities that add nuance to these discussions.—some pro-choice people (and i know they mean well naman) like to claim that abortion is ok because it's just getting rid of some soulless clumps of tissue anyway. and i guess that's scientifically true... but if fetuses are rly just soulless clumps of tissue then why are we so afraid of pregnancy at all...? why do we want to do abortions as early as possible...? I MEAN LIKE, it's silly to keep dismissing the possibility of actual growing life when discussing these things. and the fact that Sunshine Did Not Do That makes this movie good and relevant and real and special and a must-must-must-must watch. i love this movie <33 i hope more people get to see it",2025-07-29,0,0,watch,True

Kailangan natin ng mga kwentong totoo—‘yung nagpapakita ng realidad ng pamumuhay sa bansa natin.Under the direction of Antoinette Jadaone, Sunshine goes beyond being just a story about sports or dreams. It’s a story about womanhood in the Philippines—isang bansang deeply rooted sa religion, conservatism, at kung saan ang mga usaping tulad ng abortion ay nananatiling taboo. But the film’s message resonates far beyond our borders. It reflects the reality of so many women around the world. The film speaks so much truth about the lived experiences of countless women, and saludo talaga ako sa tapang ng mga gumawa nito. In these times, it takes guts to tell a story like this.Sunshine, as a character, represents those who dare to dream, and more importantly, those who dare to choose for themselves. The film is a powerful reminder that you have the right to carve your own path. Lalo na sa isang bansa na madalas i-demonize ang mga choices ng kababaihan, ng LGBTQ+ community, o kahit sinong pumipili para sa sarili nila.The entire film is gripping, emotional, and tense in the best way.

sbr2death,9,"— gets na gets kita sunshine 🌞(rant bc i need to take out sum shit that people my age cannot understand +medj spoilers)although I’ve always supported pro-choice, i still grew up in an environment and society of toxic, judgemental, religious people na sobrang diri sa idea ng topics na pinapakita ng movie nato… i have to admit that i am not perfect and have either stayed silent or have been partially agreeing w/ them to stay out of judgement,,,, that’s the issue here. Maraming tao na nagsasabi lang ng,,, “Bat ba hindi kayo nag-iisip?” or “Sinisira nyo lang future nyo” 😞 I’m not here to normalize teenage pregnancy at all pero nakakakalungkot talaga how other people view the WOMEN in the situation. Ang dali dali nyo manghusga ng ating mga kapwa babae dhil di sila nagiintay for marriage, or minamadali nila ung “paglandi”, but it’s never on the guy. Its normal for us humans to feel lust and think about sexuality but I do not want to glorify it okay,, Sunshine as a person is not perfect, shes human. And so are all the other sunshines in the world. I have debated about the topic of teenage pregnancy a few times now and all i wish for is a better system in our country, and more support for the girls who have no choice, wether from strangers, family, loved ones, non-governmental organizations, or governmental ones,, even just that is rare haha. Abortion is not murder, it’s saving your life; and aswell as your child’s life from being put into an environment that isn’t meant for them. Adoption after labor isn't always the right choice. Imagine if u actually gave birth to it and put it up for adoption that ends the baby up in a worse household noh!!😥😥?!?!? If a girl isn’t ready to give birth, and has an independent choice, there shouldn’t be people to stop her at that point. One thing i dislike hearing is people bringing religious “morality” into the topic. It’s honestly super disrespectful, don't want to elaborate it anymore.Everything else aside, well no,, i just wanted to finally say how beautiful and educational this film was, the message was loud, raw, and clear, and is such an eye-opener to people who are unfamiliar with the topic; to see the authenticity of what teenage victims in the philippines go through, we see two perspectives, (Arianna) a little girl in a toxic household r’ed by her uncle, (Sunshine) and a young adult going through pregnancy, not being able to bare seeing another girl torturing her body— both suffering through the judgements of their fellow filipinos. This shows that we can never truly understand what somebody is going through unless we experience it in our own hands. But i wont forget about Annika Co in this movie ofc. Her part of being here shows na nde masama turuan ang mga kabataan tungkol sa mga gantong sensitibo na topic, and that Sunshine was never alone in her journey, Annika’s character was there to guide Sunshine on her journey, even though they had hardships with their relationship together, in the conclusion, the kid understood how Sunshine felt, and supported her throughout the end and that is more than enough.Basta i love u sunshine ❤️ this was not just a review of the movie, but also my personal rant feeling the reality beyond this fictional movie.

It calls for empathy for the victims and what they have to go through and give up — their dreams, their childhood, their life. And it calls for disgust for the old ways of thinking, and possibly our skewed views on morality.And in these hard times, how proper support from the people around you can allow you to make decisions for yourself and not because of what others will think.

justinaerys,8,"Although Sunshine (2024) advanced the conversation about abortion and body autonomy, one treatment of the film sets the conversation back.Don't get me wrong tho', it effectively presented difficult conversations within an already difficult subject. It doesn't just talk about abortion in the moral sense, but also its nuances—such as abuse and inaccessibility of healthcare, including both financial and policymaking aspects that rob women of the right to appropriate medical procedures.It also gave face to the concept of guilt through the personification of the unborn, embodied by the characters of the unnamed child and Ariana.But that very personification is where exactly the issue starts.The argument for the pro-choice position is the fact that life does not start at conception, but upon delivery. To personify unborn fetuses strengthens the narrative that abortion is murder. ""Murderer,"" as the unnamed child called Sunshine the moment abortion crossed her mind upon knowing that she's pregnant.But how much does this set the conversation back? Not a lot, really.The film did not fail in doing its job. By tackling abortion itself, it already succeeded in sparking conversations such as this one. And that's already a huge step in advancing women's right to accessible healthcare.Let's just hope that we'll get to see more ""woke indie films"" like Sunshine (2024).

xxai,10,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine doesn’t waste time. Within ten minutes, we already know what the titular character wants: she doesn’t want this pregnancy. What follows isn’t a mystery or a coming-of-age arc- it’s a fight.We meet Sunshine as she trains for the Olympic gymnastics qualifiers. She’s 19- focused, disciplined, and carrying a dream she’s had and has trained for since she was 10. Then she discovers she’s pregnant. From that moment on, the film never strays from what Sunshine wants: will she be able to get an abortion?Sound design is a big part in every movie and in Sunshine, the sound feels like another character. Before her routines, her coach tells her to “drown out the noise.” But what if you can’t? Sunshine lives by a noisy street. She trains in a chaotic gym. There’s a baby in the house that cries at all hours. Even in a church- where she prays not for guidance, but for forgiveness before attempting to buy an abortion pill- there is no peace. Sound, in this film, becomes symbolic of the constant interference she endures. The noise of judgment, of religion, of expectations- it’s relentless.That judgment bleeds into nearly every interaction she has. The pharmacist gives unsolicited opinions when she buys a pregnancy test. Her best friend’s mother condemned her. In a country where over 90% of the population identifies as Christian and Catholicism dominates public life, the supposed separation of church and state is functionally meaningless. Religion makes the rules. And when Sunshine is rushed to the hospital after complications from taking an abortion pill purchased from a street vendor, the doctor shames her in front of other patients, calling her actions “a sin in the eyes of the Lord.”Sunshine carries everything alone. Her future, once so certain, is now uncertain. If she continues the pregnancy, the nine years she spent training will be for nothing. Her body is already changing. Her coach notices. She can’t train like she used to. Her dream is slipping.And then we meet Mary Grace, a quiet but devastating side character whose story lingers. Their first encounter happens at the same place where Sunshine tries to buy an abortion pill. The second time they meet, Mary Grace tells her she thought her bloated belly was just worms- a line so innocent it crushes you. In that moment, we are reminded: she’s a child. A victim of incestuous rape and we later learn she’s just 13, after she was taken to the hospital for complications when she attempted to get rid of her pregnancy.In a country where sex is taboo and sex education is frowned upon by religious leaders, what hope do girls like Mary Grace-or Sunshine-really have?Maris Racal is outstanding. Her physicality, her posture, her tension even in the quite moments makes her character feel very real. She carries the film with a maturity and vulnerability and it’s undeniably Racal’s best work to date.At just 90 minutes, Sunshine is lean and direct. It doesn’t meander. Just a young girl fighting again and again for her dreams.Sunshine is a masterful depiction of what it means to grow up in a country where women and girls lack the right to choose. Where “I don’t want to be a mother” isn’t considered a valid reason. The film drives this home in its final minutes: the guy responsible for Sunshine’s pregnancy shows up at her house with his pastor father. They assure her they’ll support the baby “every step of the way” until the child turns 18. Sunshine listens, then finally says what she’s been saying all along: she doesn’t want to be a mother.We already know this. We’ve known it since the first ten minutes. But her ex and his father don't, or rather, can't understand it. “That’s not the point!” she yells, and she’s right. The moment others found out she was pregnant, it stopped being about her, but about the baby. They had no regard for her dreams, for her aspirations, and how pregnancy will affect her well-being. It was never about if she'll be supported, it was about whether she's still ""allowed"" to have what she wants. And in a country that denies girls and women a choice, the cost is often their dreams, their futures, and sometimes, their lives.Sunshine is just one story, but it’s shared by thousands. And unless the law changes, there will always be more Sunshines. Jadaone’s film dares to say that-loudly-even when the world tells her to drown out the noise.",2025-07-29,2,0,watch,True

That, which works quite splendidly if not for the fact that this is a film supported by a very tepid and uncharacteristic score from Maris Racal's own ex-partner.That being said, the best things about Sunshine actually emanate from its night sequences. It captures wholly the distress, illegality, and dismay of everything to do with abortion, the black market, and whatever Sunshine's problems are adjacent to in reality. Those night scenes seemed straight out of Abbas Kiarostami’s Like Someone in Love.It's actually so apparent by the film's end that everything that does come out of this leads to the most reasonable one: a film that doesn't explicitly preach what to do, save for what its problem is tied to in context.But yeah, that score really does this thing a disservice.

evrybdyluvspie,9,"direk tonet, i am (and will forever be) in awe of you.i have always been hooked on to this film even before its philippine premiere, due to its striking plot and of course the leading star attached to it, maris racal. watching this film on the big screen, i felt so uneasy knowing that this is pretty much a reality for filipino women and women overall.sunshine is more than just a story of a girl tortured by the thoughts of bearing a child at such a young age; it is a grounded story surrounded by problems caused by societal pressure towards women and questionable christian morals and beliefs, which also opens up the current state of the country in terms of healthcare and its views on abortion. art has always been meant to provoke, and direk tonet did it so gracefully—like how sunshine performed her routines, but still so raw with scenes depicting medically unsafe abortions during the second half.the cinematography was very pleasing for the eyes. most of the shots used were very effective in laying out the emotional impact of this film, most especially its exterior and tight shots with sunshine being the subject. another directorial choice that caught my attention was its symbolism. notably, the use of bata and ariana as figments of sunshine's imaginations. despite those major choices, i personally liked the subtle and unnoticeable details more because i truly believe that it was those that helped keep the film coherent with its vision. details like added sound bites from the television and radio or the production design of sunshine's house.overall, i love it. yun lang HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",2025-07-30,0,1,watch,True
kajurice,10,"watching this movie took me back and reminded me that pagbabae ka, magisa ka lang. they were able to encapsulate that with sunshine navigating everything on her own. having to hide because there is no other choice. the moment she tells anyone, she wont get help, it means surrendering her dreams even if she doesnt want to. to have a movie discuss the sensitive topics of this country such as abortion, child pregnancy, premarital pregnancy, and the negative side of religion is so brave. to be able to show it in a story so compelling and very filipino is so important imo. sobrang ganda ng cinematography, using manila’s lights and noise while also highlighting the darkness within its shadows. everyone’s performance in this film adds so much to the already great backdrop and dialogues. there was so many scenes that went so hard, too. when sunshine was on the jeep, when she was alone in that motel, when she performed, even when she was just walking. every scene felt so important because maris embodied and delivered sunshine so well. ramdam ko yung galit, yung desperasyon, yung sikip sa dibdib ng walang magawa. especially when she woke up in the hospital, the doctora started making her ask god for forgiveness. my blood boiled and i may have cried angry tears ngl. we are so used to religious guilt tripping in this country, its not even helping anyone. anyway, Sunshine deserves her flowers.

lovetina,9,"“kahit anong mangyari, kakampi kita.”first of all, this movie is so refreshing. it shows the struggles of our main character, sunshine, and goes into depth how unwanted pregnancy can lead to mental and physical problems, the desperation of having limited options and resources, the shame encoded into our heads at birth by religious and societal expectations, and most importantly, it shows the resilience women are forced to do just to simply survive.second of all—i love, love, LOVE how this story is not your typical filipino pro-life propaganda warning. it’s honestly so upsetting how conservative and unprogressive our county is with abortion, but hopefully with this movie, older generations can sympathize with not just sunshine, but also mary grace’s situation.i’m actually so glad sunshine doesn’t force its main character to attach herself to the stigma of “abortion is murder” mindset; but rather, being able to be firm and push through with her decision—knowing that she’s not ready to be a mother—and doing what’s right for her (and the baby), without the influence of her boyfriend’s opinion, as well as the boyfriend’s father who offered to take care of financial expenses, which is quite rare.another beautiful moment in this movie that i personally love is the sisterhood between sunshine and geleen. geleen’s understanding nature is powerful in itself—that having one person who will love you and guide you despite everything you’re facing can make your way in life a little easier. knowing that you have someone to lean on in times like this is so fortunate, cause not many filipinas can have that kind of support system.and dr. helena’s help? as someone pursuing medicine, i understand the male doctor’s perspective on how he doesn’t want to loose his license, but with just dr. helena stepping in discreetly, she is incredibly brave. she’s risking her entire life on the line for someone she doesn’t even know, and for me, that’s such a great example of camaraderie between women.although the first doctor that “helped” sunshine was unnecessarily rude. i’m glad geleen stepped in and defended her sister. as a doctor, don’t you have to leave religious talk outside work? what an asshole.overall, i’m so glad that philippine cinema is slowly stepping out of its comfort zone to talk about sensitive topics like these despite half (or even the majority) of the country being against abortion. i hope this movie spreads like wildfire—a wake-up call to break free from patriarchal laws, and the belief that women’s bodies and choices are truly their own.",2025-07-30,0,0,watch,False

We may venerate a baby (Sto. Nino) and the virgin (Mary), but the way women and children are treated is ironically (if not disgustingly) far apart from our devotion to the Catholic faith.

johndrebdg,9,"been a few days since i watched the film as of writing this but i still can’t find the proper words to describe the experience of watching sunshine in the cinemas with all the people around me. first of all, it really is a different feeling to enjoy a movie in the cinema and see how other viewers will react to scenes as the film progresses. may dagdag factor talaga sya na napapaganda lalo yung film and mas nakaka-engross talaga sha for me grabe!!!!! hands down lang talaga sa performance ni maris. her character wasn’t merely a persona shaped by the script or the vision of the writer, SHE IS SUNSHINE. PERIOD. sobrang natural yung expressions, parang nandun talaga ako sa tabi nya for the entire journey to sea games (and in my head, pati sa olympics na pinapangarap nya 🥲) and it’s mindblowing how i never really felt na movie yung pinapanood ko— everything felt so real because what’s portrayed is the reality. sa totoong buhay, kahit na ang laki na ng pagbabagong naganap tungo sa pagkakaroon ng lugar ng babae sa lipunan, ang realidad ay marami pa rin ang ipinagkakait sa kanila. marami pa ring hakbang ang maaaring gawin at mga pagbabago na dapat isulong dahil hindi sapat na ang mga filipinong babae ay naikakahon sa imahe na hinubog ng daang-taong impluwensiya ng katolisismo sa naging kultura natin. ANG MGA KABABAIHANG PINOY AY MATAPANG! MAABILIDAD! MAHUSAY!

bmands,9,"There are films that entertain, and then there are films that hold up a mirror—brutal, honest, and impossible to look away from.Sunshine did that to me. It stripped me raw and left me in quiet reflection long after the screen went black. I saw in Sunshine’s story not just a character, but the collective ache of countless women who’ve had to choose between self-preservation and duty.The central challenge of Sunshine—a young gymnast discovering her pregnancy at the cusp of her Olympic dream—hit me in a visceral way. Not because I’ve ever been pregnant, or aspired to the Olympics, but because I know what it’s like to carry something heavy in silence, to want something for yourself while the world insists you exist for others.Sunshine’s fear, defiance, and quiet longing mirrored the emotional territory I navigate daily: trying to live on my terms in a world that insists I don’t get to choose.My full review here: inthewakeofthings.wordpress.com/2025/07/30/sunshine-2024-on-choice-compassion-and-the-weight-of-expectations/",2025-07-30,0,0,watch,True

The grounded surrealism. And Jadaone's honesty in what she wanted to convey in the film. Much like her previous romance films Alone/Together and Never Not Love You, this film grappled with social and economic uncertainty but this time it highlighted Maris Racal's character's struggle to love her passion in gymnastics. It's no surprise Racal acted the hell out of her role, but my flowers are for Jennica Garcia who encapsulated the ghost of Sunshine's what-could-have-been. Sunshine further proves Jadaone is in her prime, and there's so much more she can make in the next years.",2025-07-30,0,0,watch,False

interheaven,8,"marami akong nakikitang western reviews calling this so-so. if titingnan mo nga from their pov, oo nga? ano bang bago dito, it's literally about a high school student getting an abortion to focus on her olympian gymnast dreams. but this is where context matters. films like sunshine are so important as a conversation-starter in countries like the philippines where abortion and reproductive health is deemed not as important by a male-dominated government and a religious culture. ang dami pa ring pro-life kaya sobrang hirap para sa mga kababaihan tulad ni sunshine at mary grace magkaroon ng access sa safe ways for abortion. sobrang nakakadala makita sila na irisk ang buhay nila para magpatuloy pa mabuhay. mahirap magbuntis pero di hamak na mas mahirap magpa-abort.at lalo itong pinapahirap ng isang patriyarkal na lipunan, katulad ng doktor na unang nilapitan ni sunshine para tulungan si mary grace. tumatak siya sakin kasi siya ang salamin ng mga kalalakihan sa ating legislation chambers na walang pakialam sa karapatan ng mga kababaihan at galit na galit sa mga plataporma na nagsusulong ng kanilang welfare. isa pa yang si miggy at ang tatay niya. mga barumbado. kaya oo, importante ang paggawa at pagpapalabas ng mga pelikula tulad ng sunshine. nagulat nga ako pinondohan to ng fdcp? at pinayagan ilabas sa maraming sinehan. sana marami pang mamulat sa importansya ng pagbibigay ng choice sa mga kababaihan. choice mabuhay, at hindi lang bilang tagadala ng buhay.",2025-07-29,1,0,watch,False
vtcnscientist,8,"Late diary entry. It really is true that employment screws the cinephile in us. This is Jadaone's Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) mixed with the magical realism of Jojo Rabbit (2020), and Brocka's depiction of Maynila as a harsh, predatory city that traps and exploits the marginalized. There's a night scene that was basically taken from a Brocka handbook, framing, camera movements, dialogue. I love Jadaone's growth as a filmmaker and this project shows how she matured in multiple filmic aspects, but more so on the commendable screenplay. The conversations felt realistic– something a Gen-Z would say in the present context. There's a clever and subtle critiquing done by adding the English-speaking scenes as well. As if they poke fun at the other contradictions in our postcolonial, patriarchal society now.Multiple ironies and contradictions lie in this film—the titular character's name doesn't coincide with her lived experiences, the vendor selling the religious images of Nazareno and Sto Niño also sells the abortion pills, how the people who claim to care for us are so quick to judge if situations do not align with their perspective or morality. Sunshine to me was a thought-provoking way of presenting a very evident issue in our Philippine society, and Jadaone made it brutally honest without lacking the compassion and clarity to bring about this story.I love how hopeful the ending was tbh. I know that this country has been so steeped in religious conservatism that even acknowledging how hopeful that ending was would raise flak—but this movie has done a great deal to create awareness and productive discussions on unwanted pregnancies. Sunshine was a confrontation of our modern maladies, something that very clearly threatens the health and future of women. That's another contradiction in itself, having a government by the people, for the people and yet it chooses to ignore the evident crises of its people. I digress. Gets kita, Shine.

everybobi,10,"My favorite part of the film is how Sunshine simply does not have any maternal figure in her life.Her mother is literally nowhere! Numerous characters try to act in this woman's place, but all fail in being the figure Sunshine needs.I believe this is why the coach remains a flat character for the entire duration of the plot. Even if she refers to Sunshine as ""anak,"" we never get to see her be a mother to her. The coach is at the center of the conflict, the one person who must never know that she's pregnant. Thus, Sunshine refuses to open up to her coach, refusing to be cared for knowing the consequences. When her coach hears rumors of her pregnancy, there is no comfort in her words when she confronts Sunshine. Instead, all the secretly pregnant teenager receives is a reminder of what is at stake, that she won't get to be on the team. This pushes Sunshine to go back for a stronger round 2 of the pamparegla.Not even Thea's mom can give comfort to the friend of her daughter. She literally does the opposite, ordering Thea to stay away from Sunshine. Even when Sunshine asks the motelkeeper for help, and they reluctantly do so. The elder women place her on a tricycle and leave her to bleed out as the tricycle rushes to the hospital.Then there's the doctor. Sunshine's sister perfectly criticizes her demeanor towards Sunshine. Her sister asks the doctor if she's a relative of theirs or possibly their mother because she's acting like one. Though this might seem like a counter, when you take into account how the doctor cares more about Sunshine apologizing to the Lord and thanking Him rather than Sunshine's well-being, the case falters. Also, her character felt more like a voice of how religion greatly affects the medical field and in turn, women's bodies.The same goes even for the case of Mary Grace, who has been impregnated by her own uncle. While her mother is alive, their relationship is complicated to say the least. Her mother enables the abusive relationship between the uncle and child for money, so that someone else can ""take care"" of Mary Grace, essentially removing herself from the role of being a mom.I think all this is why her sister is highlighted as a light in her life. She is the closest thing to being a mother in Sunshine's life, caring about her health, whether she goes to school or not, and so on. However, they are sisters at heart. They can only hold each other's hands through life. Her sister does not order her what to do with the baby, instead defends her from the doctor, pays for the bill, and gets her home. They are sisters through and through.",2025-07-30,1,0,rewatch,True

carlcarreon,10,"Manila is rich with history, and within its walls are cracks that harbors scandalous yet important narrative we are too ashamed to tell. And unfortunately, Sunshine, in essence, represents the face of this cruel fate — the very victim of society's refusal to address issues that are relevant yet alarming.And through the film's course, we see Quiapo as this undeniable haven of hypocrisy, a place of contradicting morals, the very product of poverty and its people trying to survive and make ends meet.Jadaone somehow manages to tap into the very surface of these stories rather creatively, without missing a beat and has a stark vision of what the film should be about. At times I feel like the film is a literal outcry for help. Every character here is a representation of that and is the result of what's wrong with the system in general. This paired with Racal's impressive performance strengthens the film's core message. Simply put, Jadaone's work is not a prententious flick that uses sensitive subject matter for mere views but rather an impactful affair that successfully champions itself as a vessel for awareness. Overall, the film is resonating with me, a powerful testament that the film transcends genders and in itself is a beautiful feat because it lets you see and viscerally feel Sunshine, and witness her journey to self-forgiveness and inner peace.",2025-07-30,5,0,watch,True

jahdfaune,8,"The entire time I was watching, I felt like I couldn't breathe. It's claustrophobic and suffocating, just like how Sunshine herself feels. You feel her world slowly closing in on her, invisible walls tightening around her in every frame. The camera doesn't let you breathe, and neither does the sound. Manila's noise is constant, overwhelming, and disorienting, especially for a gymnast who needs focus and silence to thrive. Sunshine is literally and figuratively trapped in tight spaces, cramped jeepneys, crowded streets, the overbearing sound of trains passing by, judgmental stares, and high expectations. Visually and sonically, it captures how isolating and terrifying it is to carry a burden like hers in a society that is less than kind toward women. (Btw, just to put it out there, the cinematography and colors in this film are GORGEOUS.) In almost every film that tackles women's issues in the Philippines, you'll find this line repeated in many reviews here in Letterboxd: ""Ang hirap maging babae. At lalong mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas."" It's because it's true. Every day, women here continue to fight for autonomy, for safety, for the right to choose themselves. We live in a deeply patriarchal and religious society that expects women to always put others first—especially family, be it their parents, siblings, or children—and shames them whenever something bad happens to them as if they brought it upon themselves. Society never asks the men who take advantage of women simply existing to change, rather it expects women to quietly endure. Bakit kailangang babae ang palaging mag-adjust? I appreciated how the film showed moments of solidarity between women, but it's sad how that's not always the case in real life.Exceptional performances from the entire cast, especially Maris Racal, who is tremendous in the titular role. From the start, she's completely convincing as an elite athlete and future Olympian: disciplined, focused, and has no room for error, as both her dreams and the dreams of others rest heavily on her shoulders. But it's in moments where Sunshine wrestles with fear, guilt, and inner conflict that Maris truly shines. She captures and presents the character's vulnerability so well. Also, as someone who always adored Jennica Garcia since her GMA days, I absolutely loved watching her quiet and subtle acting as Sunshine's sister.I said in my first review of Fan Girl that I hoped Direk Tonet would make an even braver film, and she did. Sunshine focuses and dives deep into the themes it introduces and stands firm in its critique—something that I felt was somehow lacking in Fan Girl. While some moments didn't always work for me and the magical realism elements sometimes took me out, I understand the choice. Part of me wishes it stayed more grounded and direct, but the “Gets ko na” scene near the end hit so hard that I stopped minding altogether. It's a great, important film and I hope it helps open up more discourse on women's reproductive rights in the country.Go see it in cinemas when you can. 📽️ SM City North EDSA Cinema 6",2025-07-28,0,0,watch,True

tosshhhiiii,10,"After making waves at the Toronto Film Festival last year and winning a Crystal Bear at the Berlin Film Festival early this year, #SunshineMovie finally comes home to the Philippines. Starring Maris Racal in a powerful lead performance, the film follows Sunshine Francisco, a decorated gymnast whose Olympic dreams are threatened when she unexpectedly becomes pregnant. She must choose between her ambitions and the responsibilities suddenly placed on her — all while navigating a society that dictates what women should and shouldn’t do with their bodies.Directed by Antoinette Jadaone, the film doesn’t shy away from the hard questions — ones that should be answered by the Church, the government, the educational system, and most crucially, parents. Why is premarital sex and reproductive health still taboo in 2025? Why does society police women’s choices about their bodies? Why can’t we provide options for victims of abuse? These questions linger long after the credits roll.Maris Racal gives a career-defining performance — fragile yet defiant — as a young woman trying to stay strong while breaking under immense pressure. Aside from her acting, her gymnastics scenes are highly commendable, a testament to her dedication to the role. Jennica Garcia gives a quietly affecting turn as her older sister, shining in key emotional scenes. Child actor Annika Co, making her debut, is a revelation — a true scene-stealer with star potential. Former child star Rhed Bustamante will touch your heart & churn your stomach. Piolo Pascual also appears in a poignant special role. Manila, chaotic and contradictory, plays more than just a backdrop — it becomes an extension of Sunshine’s journey. From historic churches to narrow alleyways, she searches for clarity, strength, and hope, beautifully captured & lighted by ace cinematographer Pao Orendain.Sunshine is bold, relevant, and deeply moving. It’s a call to conversation, to empathy, and to change. Super highly recommended!!! Now showing exclusively at SM Cinemas nationwide — don’t miss it.",2025-07-31,0,0,rewatch,False
roguism,8,"This movie is so satisfying to watch because it empathizes with its main character, sunshine, a young gymnast training for the olympics who happened to have an unwanted pregnancy. Young women like her are figures often shunned in popular philippine media and well, society so it’s refreshing to see someone like her in a sympathetic light. Abortion is such a taboo topic in this country so i very much appreciate the relentless uncovering of the different failures of the government and society with regards to women’s reproductive health and rights. Props to Maris for fearlessly embodying the role. Abortion is healthcare. It should be a choice accessible to anyone that wants it. It doesn’t have to be earned which is why I do find the imaginary kid representing sunshine’s conscience or the possible “kid” she might bear in the future unnecessary and redundant in the face of all the other oppressive opinions surrounding her. If the goal was to voice her inner worries, it wasn’t needed, it was already felt and would’ve been better shown some other way. If the goal was to voice the external conservative audience’s thoughts, then it wasn’t needed as well because they’re already thinking it, the film should’ve been secure with putting its faith on Sunshine alone. She’s a woman and she has dreams and having a baby is not part of that. She has value still for just the fact of being a person. I guess it just rubbed me the wrong way. It’s a very beautiful film nonetheless, shining best in its moments of truth and courage.",2025-07-25,0,0,watch,False

gwengutierrez,10,"this is such an important piece of art—for women, from women, as women—especially in the context of the reality of being a filipina living in the philippines. the whole runtime genuinely felt like i was watching a piece of philippine cinema history unfold. i’ve never been so emotionally compelled, invested, and moved over a piece of (ph) film (for quite some time now). this is what real cinema should be. the weight and power it bears in emphasizing the ills of society, directing empathy, progressing toward solutions.from the opening sequence of the routine, the editing and cinematography of this movie shines. quickly pacing up to the story’s compelling conflict, maris’ gripping performance hooks you into a spiraling anxiety. that immediate catholic guilt was just perfect in its timing and execution, you can’t help but greatly appreciate how well thought-out this specifically was. as she walks through the streets of metro manila aimlessly and frantically all throughout in different parts of the story, it mirrors a striking resemblance of a guarded uneasiness that we women all fear that something bad might happen to us in the streets; it’s a fight for our lives everyday. it’s also so bold of a creative decision to figuratively humanize the unborn that at first, suspiciously could have gone wrong in one mishandling of the story but eventually paid off in working favorably by ticking the (filipinos’) tendency for sentimentality—especially with an even darker subplot. the casual inhumane reality the common filipino endures.only by memory, my only issue with the whole cinematic experience is that piolo pascual as a character actor is too damn iconic and too damn handsome that there was literally a collective gasp in the theater when he came out on that one scene. di mapugngan ang kilig sa mga tao and were taken aback and away from the story with his perfect sir marco lewk. yes, my only complaint in the whole film is that gwapo ra kay ka SIR piolo pascual. this is balanced by how good of a casting choice miggy is—unrecognizable character actor (complimentary), looks like your typical spoiled teen with a face people can easily hate (complimentary), with his acting adequately matching up to his scene partners.pretty sure it was by choice that all the men are the direct a(holes)ntagonists of this story. fuck the patriarchy. fuck the system. in contrast, the relationship with the women around her significantly holds her. to nurture and to care for one another. it’s the gentlest part. knowing you’re never alone in the struggle.who knew a simple routine could bring so much emotion to a crowd. a fitting ending that serves justice to the character and story.stellar performances. cinematography, editing, and scoring is divine. thank god this is one of those filipino films paced intentionally. the writing coupled with its humorous takes in such a bleak setting was done so tastefully and appropriately that it never felt out of place. optimistic for the progressive turnout of the story’s message to the general public. art shapes culture, culture shapes people, and people shape the world. please papa god let this work in our country’s favor.i’ve only just seen this once and would love to see this a couple of times more in appreciation of the mastery of craftsmanship everyone involved in this production. as i always believe that movies can save lives, and can change lives. it’s one of those pieces that makes you hopeful of what great cinema (and future) lies ahead for our country.p.s.lahi ra sad gyud ang igo sa clear reflection of a society you currently live in",2025-07-31,0,0,watch,False

summerstreak,10,"Ang iniluha ko naman talaga kasi sobrang bigat sa puso knowing how raw and authentic this has been, especially with the fact that a lot of women, even girls, actually experience this, na this just goes way beyond the screen but is a sad reality of some.Being a woman will always be both a blessing and a curse, most likely when it comes to fertility, because often it will always be tied down to a woman's worth. Being a mom takes a lot of courage, for it requires a lot of sacrifices, dedicating your whole life to a child you've conceived for 9 months. It makes you appreciate motherhood and admire the women who dream to be a mother who is capable of giving unconditional love and a good life in a sense na they are willing to do everything for their child... But the truth is not everyone wants to be a mother, and society must learn to respect this kasi it is genuinely for the betterment of everyone, most likely for the child itself. Kasi being a mom is such a huge responsibility that most aren't even ready for, and a lot of other factors, such as teenage and unwanted pregnancy and being a victim of sexual abuse, contribute to the decision of termination of the child. People often tend to overlook it and deem it as something so negative, but what they fail to see is how this decision will always come from the place of love and care for themselves as well as the baby kasi genuinely I think it is more cruel to continue things you don't even want in the first place 'cause both the child and the parent would only suffer physically, emotionally, and psychologically. Also, I hate how women are expected to sacrifice their own dreams, aspirations, and life itself like it's so unfair how men could easily get away with anything, while the the women will be the ones to suffer, be condemned, and be villainized for things that they both did naman. Kaya sex education shouldn't really be a taboo topic, especially safe sex kasi it would really be a huge help in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Aside from it, grabe ang ganda ng cinematography ng film and sobrang galing ng mga gumanap kasi isinabuhay talaga nila 'yung characters nila to the point na 'you wouldn't even think na this is acting kasi it feels so real.

Despite growing up in a harsh world, she refuses to let her circumstances define her or dictate her future, thanks to the strength and support of the women around her.It speaks volumes about the kind of society we’ve built, the choices we’re forced to make, and how survival, especially for women like me, is not just a quiet resistance, but a brave act of believing in and shaping the future in our own terms.Still showing in SM cinemas nationwide.#SupportLocalFilms",2025-07-31T03:11:05.005Z,0,0,watch,True

The film mirrors how a good-for-nothing man only reaps a fleeting pleasure from an intercourse while pain is all that is left of and might be rooted in a woman forever and how a female that chooses and decides for her own body are condemned by her very own sex. I also appreciate how film celebrates the innate wisdom of children :’))Tribulations don’t kindly pick a certain period in our lives, we will be found unarmed in them any time. It is also vague how long its adversities will delay our dreams—but what is sure is that they can never end them. I encourage everyone to see ‘Sunshine.’ It is undebatable that we expose ourselves to brutally honest discourses about womanhood, safe sex, and reproductive health in the Philippines, dahil sa pagmamalasakit nag-uumpisa ang ating laban na mabuo ang isang mapagpalaya at ligtas na mundo para sa kababaihan—para sa lahat 💜",2025-07-31,1,0,watch,True

We had different perspectives about the topics discussed in Sunshine, which is exactly what makes the movie relevant. And why so many people need to watch it. Every detail and line seemed to be carefully crafted. Every scene had an important message. From men failing to take accountability and leaving all the burden on the woman, the religious and conservative opinions, the reality of the healthcare system, to the harsh truth that criminalizing abortion does more harm than good. Annika Co's role was such an amazing addition to the entire story. Without her, I feel like it would be incomplete. She was a representation of a young girl's heart. I would say I felt like the ending was lacking in impact and power, hence my rating. I feel like there could have been more to show Sunshine's decision and outcome.

You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone.

glanche,8,"sunshine is a film by Tonet Jadaone. context is very important because if you have seen jadaone’s films (That Thing Called Tadhana, Fangirl, Alone Together among others) then you will know this is HER film. you feel it in every frame. the writing. the direction & performances. there’s no voyeurism here. no moralizing. just truth. honest, specific, sometimes messy truth about what it’s like to be a woman in this country. not in the headlines, not in theory, but in the streets, in health centers, in quiet conversations with friends who are too afraid to say what they really need.maris racal delivers the performance of her life. she holds back when she needs to. she breaks in silence. she carries every scene with restraint, sensitivity & precision. she becomes sunshine. and it’s the kind of performance that demands to be remembered.the ensemble is just as grounded. jennica garcia, thea, the kid: each one brings something real to the table. nothing is forced. they don’t play characters. they play people you’ve probably met. maybe they remind you of someone you know. maybe they remind you of you.what makes sunshine work is not the acting or the direction but the refusal to look away. the film doesnt hide behind a metaphor. it gives us a manila that feels exactly like the one we move through. where pamparegla is sold outside churches. where motels won’t let you in if you’re alone. where grieving teenagers are all around but they have kept it in because no one has dared say “you’re safe here.” from my POV, the film takes a narrative risk. there’s a device that briefly pulls you out of the realism it builds so well. but it sticks the landing. because what matters is that you never stop feeling for these women. and that you leave the theater asking why stories like theirs still feel unsafe to tell.i’ve had my own sunshines, close friends, a relative, a classmate. women who needed care, not judgment. watching this film felt like watching them again. and all i could think was, “please, let her be safe.”this film deserves a seat in our national conversations. not just in cinema panels, but in health committees, in policy rooms, in the offices of people who still think there is a valid excuse to deny access to care.one of the most necessary films of the year.",2025-07-31,1,0,watch,False

Like this is the reality of thousands of filipino women. The reason this hit so hard for me and for my sister and all the young filipino women in the cinema with us was because sunshine could easily be usi'm really glad this received critical acclaim because its narratives like these that filipinos need to hear. surviving in the conservative catholic philippines as a woman is nawt for the weak 😭 and its about time that progressive, proudly pro-choice films like sunshine make it big",2025-07-31,1,0,watch,True

Dinig ang dumaraang tren, bulungan ng mga tao sa daan, kakaibang tugtugan sa tricycle, nakakasulasok na paligid, at marami pang iba. Mula Avenida hanggang Quiapo, ramdam ko ang nag-aalab na pangarap ni Sunshine. Pursigido. Desidido. Hindi siya nagpatinag sa ingay ng paligid. Mula umpisa hanggang dulo, buo ang kaniyang loob para sa kaniyang sarili at pangarap. Walang halong pag-aalinlangan. Mahusay ang pagkakahabi ng pelikula, mula cinematography hanggang linya ng mga karakter. Mahusay ang pagkakaarte. Madaling maunawaan. Hindi ko naramdaman na halos isang oras na ang nakalipas. Hindi nakababagot. Punong-puno ng pangarap at serye ng kawalan ng akses sa sektor ng pangkalusugan. Dinala tayo ni Sunshine sa kaniyang buhay at pangarap. Isa sa tumatak sa akin na eksena ay ang huling tagpo. Ginawa niya ang kaniyang stunts, nag-gymnastics siya, sumayaw nang walang pag-aalinlangan at pangamba. Sumabay sa indayog ng musika habang dinadama ang bawat hampas ng kaniyang ribbon. Doon pa lang, alam mo na. Tahimik ang eksena matapos ang pagsayaw, ang higpit ng yakap ay ramdam mo. Para bang ikaw ang niyayapos at pinapakalma nito. Salamat sa mahigpit na yakap. Sa malalim na aspekto, nakalulungkot isipin na hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa rin tanggap ang abortion sa ating bansa. Nakalulungkot isipin na nawawalan ng karapatan ang mga kababaihan na mamili— na piliin ang sarili at pangarap. Mapagmulat at mapagpalaya ang pelikula. Pinamulat sa atin ng bawat eksena ang isang isyung nangyayari sa ating bansa sa kasalukuyan. At pinalaya tayo ng pelikula mula sa tanikala ng tradisyunal na paniniwala at pananaw ng karamihan. Hindi maglalaon, unti-unti na rin matatanggap ng mga tao ang katotohan na bahagi ng ating karapatan ito bilang kababaihan. Sa huli, isa lang ang sigurado, nanaig ang kaniyang pangarap. Pinili niya ang kaniyang sarili ng walang halong pag-aalinlangan. Kaya para sa lahat ng Sunshine, nawa'y lagi ninyong piliin ang sarili at pangarap.

ygoismo_,10,"“the filipino women and the curse of catholic guilt” despite popular western belief where early stages of pregnancy are just lump of cells and does not count as a human being, this is where pro-choice comes in and protest women’s autonomy through the lens of science. in our nation this is not a strong argument as this doesn’t penetrate the teachings of the catholic/christian church where flesh is flesh and the act of aborting a lump of cells is murder. now this is where sunshine and the jojo rabbitesque kid brave depiction contradicts with the filipino pro-life argument “future president” and the what ifs of the future child, despite some view this representation as counter productive it actually stands for how much catholic guilt and patriarchal values is imbued from the moment we are born, that’s why no matter how we view ourselves as progressive, modern, and forward, the filipino women still struggle with their autonomy over their body and choices where they face at the mercy of unwanted consequences. that’s why i admire how brave “sunshine” depict the lump of cells as a hallucinatory unborn child where it grounds how filipino culture views it and turns it as a film creative force to show how women no matter the circumstance should have complete autonomy over their body, not in an overly liberal way where everything is muddled in the gray area but as an acceptance that we live in a society where women are still tied to patriarchal reproductive roles and system wherein we disguise feminist liberalism as matriarchal.with abortion still illegal in our country, teenage and unplanned pregnancy a national problem, and contraceptives a taboo subject. this is a film that offers understanding, empathy, and compassion to sunshines out there that are resorting to unsafe, life threatening, and “illegal” ways that society calls bad choices but what is “bad” when it is the only choice they have. lastly i cannot complete this write up without mentioning the lino brocka, i love how it shows manila as a character with its noise, chaos, and decay through the familiar seams of avenida and quiapo with its religious interplay of choice (accessibility to unsafe preganancy pills) and solace of a religious power it holds.maris racal stellar performance will forever hold her in the filipino cinema history as sunshine, as how nora aunor is bona, and hilda koronel is insiang.i really really hope more people watch this and be a strong catalyst of change for reproductive rights as it is core a healthcare and human rights.",2025-07-31,0,0,watch,True

aerollism_,8,"Promise, 'di siya overhype.We’re halfway through 2025 and far from its denouement but I must say that SUNSHINE, if not the best, is one of the best and one of the most important films of the year. I’m so sorry, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION FROM LILIA CUNTAPAY, but I believe I now have my new favorite Antoinette Jadaone’s work. They said during the promotion that this is the last day this will be shown here sa provinces and then starting tomorrow, sadly, it will only be shown to 3 cinemas na lang so I felt the substantial need to watch it tonight. Mind you, sobrang bigat pa rin ng pakiramdam ko, tapos na lahat, at ngayon na tina-type ko lahat ng to.Sunshine heavily tackled significantly sensitive issues here in the country - rape, teenage pregnancy, poor healthcare, and machismo. At habang ina-absorb ko lahat kanina inside the movie theatre, I couldn’t help but think about my two sisters who are the same age as the protagonist. Ang bigat. Ang lala. Ang hapdi. Give me a span of time to write an essay about this and I will take that challenge without a doubt. That’s how it affected me big time. It hits home.Now let’s talk about the performances. First sequence pa lang, it’s apparent that Maris Racal studied the role. Inakap niya at binigyan niya ng kaluluwa yung karakter. Hindi siya bumitaw hanggang final sequence. She had a lot of silent moments in the film and those were the most powerful. Nakakabingi yung katahimikan na halos hinahabol ko na rin yung hininga ko minsan. Jennica Garcia’s character, on the other hand, though it’s just a supporting role, is one of the main highlights throughout. Yung kahit minimal lang yung dialogues niya, tignan mo lang siya sa mga mata niya, maiintindihan mo sya. I love her here. She’s too authentic. May eksena silang dalawa ni Maris dito and that was when I lost it. Iyak ako eh. GRABE YUN. Grabe yun!!!!As for the direction, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, direk Tonet. Iba pa rin talaga kapag ang kwento ng babae ay gawa rin ng babae. Maselan, matapang, at may puso. Salamat sa buhay mo. Nag-uumapaw sa social realism ang pelikula mo. Lino Brocka would’ve been so proud!! Sunshine knows Manila and all its aches and decays. May problema ka? Okay, pero hindi titigil ang mundo. Hindi titigil ang buhay ng mga naka-paligid sa‘yo. Dagdag mo pa na nasa Maynila ka kung saan life is always on survival mode. The film captured those perfectly.Lastly, Sunshine doesn't preach or impose. She makes her decisions but doesn't force you to change your opinion either. Your role as an audience member is to listen. The rest is for you to reflect upon on your own.Gets ko na.",2025-07-31,0,0,watch,True

THAT criminalizing abortion is a NEGLECT to women’s rights. up until this day, women’s health and bodies have been continuously politicized by society. bago natin ituring na isang krimen ang abortion, we first need to view this on a sociopolitical lens. bakit nga ba maraming mga babae ang nagpapalaglag?what i loved about this film is how it portrayed Sunshine’s story in the most raw and harshest way possible. direk jadaone, a WOMAN director (yes kailangan iempahsize to), saw Sunshine as a human being — a young woman who FEELS, who DREAMS big for herself. not as a criminal but as a real woman with real human flesh with the right to her own life. even Manila didn’t feel like a foreign place as a Batangueña. the entire film was real, we were all living in the same society as Sunshine’s.hindi ito pawang fiction lang. totoo si Sunshine. she is every young woman who had to choose between herself and a life she does not want for herself. she is also every young mom who had to choose between the same things. she is every young woman who is held back by what today’s society deems as morally upright based on outdated religious doctrines. she is every young woman who was denied proper healthcare, every young woman who was denied their choices and rights.she is every young woman who was neglected by a corrupt system that politicizes on women’s health and bodies.thank you, direk jadaone for introducing us to Sunshine. and to my mother, i hope you know that i would’ve understood you the same way Bata understood Sunshine.",2025-07-31,2,0,watch,True

ej_mallari,10,"Aspiring Olympian Sunshine's (Maris Racal) world suddenly turned upside down after she realizes that she is pregnant. This is by far the most beautiful and bravest Filipino film I've watched. There is an important topic that needs to be discussed after watching the film. And we need to sit down and talk about it. Loved the whole technical aspect of the show. Cinematography was on point (go Pao!). The gritty Quiapo was a whole character in itself. The bustling city echoes the fear and confusion in Sunshine's mind, yet amidst all the chaos - she is alone. Rico Blanco's music radiated organically throughout the film. Both silent and scored scenes touched feelings and intensified emotions.Maris Racal cemented her status as one of the great actors of her generation. No need to look pretty as long as she delivers the right emotions that her character calls for. And damn, Jennica Garcia! She fuckin' deserves an award! Take it, take it!!! Especially that last scene (spoiler ahead!) where she's the only one who's crying among the cheering crowd? My heart tore to pieces. Special mention to Annika Co who amused me with her natural acting chops. For a kid to deliver that, she's definitely a hot talent to watch out for! And of course, Direk Tonet. Been a fan of Antoinette Jadaone since That Thing Called Tadhana (and yeah, as a ka-eme, AWKP) and damn she really is one strong voice in this industry. Her writing, strengthened by her directing, sends out a clear message to her audience. Sunshine is an example - subtle yet painfully direct in one.After the 7pm screening in SM North last Monday, she came to answer a few questions and what struck me the most is her sharing about her most favorite part of writing - REVISING. For a professional writer like her, it is very humbling and inspiring to hear that. And her body of work definitely shows how great they are due to the notes, lessons and heart she puts to her stories.Favorite scene in the whole series of course was the last routine of Sunshine where she hugged the little girl. Just found myself crying. I literally wanted to jump to the screen and hug both of them just to say, ""it's okay"". ""Naiintindihan mo na ba ako?""

joshclaude,9,"Seen @SM North EDSA Cinema 6 w/Post-Show Q&A and Pagpag Session w/Direk Antoinette Jadaone FANTASTIC SUNSHINE 2/2“Gets ko na.” I still recall that time back in high school when we were taught the morality of abortion in Religion class. I was a scholar at a conservative Catholic all-boys school, and although I wasn’t religious (nor did I ever practice Catholicism on paper), its discussions almost shaped my beliefs on the subject matter. What I did not know was that those beliefs were tied with several factors besides religion such as patriarchy and conservatism. That was before the pandemic, and since then, my viewpoints have stirred away from every close-minded and male-led influence those so-called teachings had. Yet, I still find it unfair that I don’t have to go through those experiences that women go through in this patriarchal society, including that of Sunshine. Critics were not kidding about the Lino Brocka comparisons to Sunshine, yet this has that unique female perspective that elevates its authenticity. The film is straight-forward, and in doing so, it is raw, visceral, and brutally honest. It takes its viewers through an experience rather than dictate or spoonfeed, and it rarely shies away from its reality. From the milieu alone — from the shitty healthcare system, to the sheer lack of contraceptives (if you could find them, they’re very expensive), ignorant, privileged boyfriend, and to the conservative religious doctors and rapist relatives — we are already shown that this is not a world suitable for Sunshine and for women like her who are struck with unwanted pregnancies. Because that’s the truth of our nation. Because this is not a country that favors the oppressed. As the famous saying goes, “Mahirap maging babae, pero mas mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas,” (“It’s impossible to be a woman, but it’s more impossible to be a woman living in the Philippines,”) and that couldn’t be reflected better in this film. Sunshine seeks to reclaim autonomy over her own body, which every woman deserves so but is seldom granted that right. Despite the latter being true, we still see Sunshine do everything she could to get that abortion, even if it means having to spend an unreasonable amount of money just to do so. Some may say that her story is inspiring, but it’s tragic how inspiration is confused with disturbance. This is a story that’s supposed to shed light on the fact of the matter because this is one of many issues in the country that have to be addressed, especially within our own government. Even its production design and cinematography that go hand-in-hand highlight how constrictive this place is for those who are forced to go through such uncomfortable, unasked experiences. Much of the film’s raw emotions would not have been as impactful without Maris Racal. Her acting and performance here are simply generational and incomparable. She may be known for her more comedic roles (and pure wit and vibes in interviews), but her role of Sunshine brings out her more vulnerable side that is just as raw as the attitude of the film itself. Among the more underrated performances is Jennica Garcia, who levels up with Maris Racal’s natural performance but brings a distinct, yet supportive dynamic. Child actor Annika is also great and is secretly the one who makes some of the more emotional scenes, especially those towards the end, work so well. In addition, Meryll Soriano stands out, as do Elijah Canlas, Rhed Bustamante, Xyriel Manabat, Piolo Pascual, and Angeli Bayani – even if the latter two only show up in one scene each. Some ongoing debate had sparked since its release here with regards to the weaving of the children subplot into the story, and while it did have its risks, for better or worse, it still cannot be disregarded how brave Antoinette Jadaone and Maris Racal are for telling this kind of story. Perhaps it could have been subtler, but in a country like ours, it was necessary to have been told through a more straightforward direction without being too preachy. There have been a handful of films out there that tackle abortion and unwanted pregnancies, but what makes Sunshine stand out is the mere fact that it is set in the Philippines. We are one of the last few countries to have abortion illegal as we are rooted in traditions influenced by the patriarchy and religion that treat it as an immoral, evil doing and as a taboo simply because, to them, the youth are “being irresponsible.” Sunshine never puts the blame on its titular character for its consequential catalyst, and through its depiction of such a life in this country, instead, asks us to question our reality: Did the youth fail us for exploring a natural part of ourselves, or did the adults fail them by placing and enabling all these barriers as mere punishment substituted by the words of “a lesson” or “a teaching”? That’s what makes Sunshine scary: The simple fact that it’s set in the Philippines; that women with unwanted pregnancies have to navigate through these stupid barriers, but it also ends with hope for a better future where women are allowed to make choices for their own body. In fact, we must also be reminded of this saying: “No uterus, no opinion.” Such a timely film that is raw and honest with its sensitive topic that must be talked about because so many women have had experiences like that of Sunshine. P.S. Seeing this at one of the many screenings with Q&A and audience sharing truly added to its communal experience. Direk Tonet always mentions how the film is no longer hers but ours now that we have seen it, and you could clearly see and feel it as the credits rolled, with some women opening up about once being a Sunshine or their parents giving birth to them at such an early age. It reminds you that those experiences are real and are still happening to other women underground up to now. It’s also amazing to see an eye-opening drama such as this fill up the theaters more than it did for Fantastic Four (which made for such a whiplash of a double-feature for me because it tackles the opposite theme to Sunshine).P.P.S. It goes without saying that those who say that Philippine Cinema is nothing compared to Hollywood films should shut up and watch this in cinemas. Cool to see my prof work on this.

But no, instead it got better and gave the audience a satisfaction of how Sunshine became successful despite her hurdles.I really loved the color grading in this film! at the first scenes it gave me a feeling of uneasiness, and worry for Sunshine — maybe that's because of the constant dark grading along with the green or teal background. The film's color grading gradually changed as the story progresses, when Sunshine gained hope, and courage for her decision the film got brighter.Fuck I have a lot to say in this movie. I also loved how they showed a taboo topic in the Philippines as well which is the incest among minors because of the so-called ""utang na loob"". I really loved how Sunshine stood up to tito bobot — that fuckin' asshole. By showing and portraying this taboo topic in this film I hope the viewers gained a light that this is wrong. A minor, pregnant by his tito, is not normal and is wrong. Many people chooses to turn a blind eye on this matter kasi.I also loved how women support women in this film, okay not that first doctor but the second doctor who offered Sunshine a checkup on her private clinic.This movie showed that being a woman doesn't mean being a mom only. Being a woman could mean so many things, being a woman could make being an olympian possible.Rooting for you Sunshine, you are not just a mom-to-be.

Because they always go for the most shallow differences and often time the most hypocritical. Every city in the Philippines, and for the most part the world, has traffic, hot weather, trashy streets, muggers, and poor air quality, not just Metro Manila. This frustrates me because there IS a tangible difference between Manila and other cities, it's just that a city's identity is more spiritual in essence. The churches in Cebu City won't have vendors selling abortion pills, nor will doctors in Davao City berate you moments after caring for you after you nearly died from an attempted abortion, but in Manila they do. It's a city of people getting by, it's why you go to Manila, and a deep understanding among everyone that that's what they're all trying to do, just get by.Every year my favorite Filipino movie to come out pass by me until the next year, I think this is the first time that's changed.",2025-08-01,1,0,rewatch,True

agsbewatchin,4,"the film hits too close to home for me. sunshine is suffocating, and maybe that's a directorial choice. it hits in the most uncomfortable and painful parts of me at times. it resonates with every woman who has to determine a better choice out of two shitty choices: one that might shackle her freedom or one that may free her but haunt her at the same time. it makes you feel rage at systemic failures which birth a backward society that villifies women for their lapses of judgment--damned if they do, damned if they don't. sunshine is linear in its plot. it never really takes you out of sunshine's head, so you see how raw everything is, how immature she is, how she's desperate and breaking apart but trying to keep it together, and how she's just a kid who fucked up. the film works because of this approach, albeit some plot devices are too on the nose--making them iffy and questionable, and may have muddled the film's stance. there are obvious plot holes, little details that could have enriched the world-building were overlooked. some subplots lack depth, but the performances made me look past on these things, in a sense that it was pleasant enough to watch for me. not for everyone, but everyone should be part of the discussion. jadaone's films are usually hits-or-misses for me, but sunshine is one of her better ones. the message may be clear and hopeful, but real life presents a much darker truth: for most women, there are no olympics and dreams to hold on to. in reality, we still have a long way to go in paving for a more humane society for filipino women.here's to working towards a future where women are not shamed for reclaiming their agency, and where their indiscretions are not berated and ridiculed, but treated with proper education and compassion.",2025-08-01,2,0,watch,True

Kung ipagpalagay mo sarili mo na maagang na buntis at nag gagalugad sa quiapo na tila bawat sulok naka tingin sayo ang panginoon, para ka talagang sinasaksak ng liwanag. E wala kang magagawa, saan ba dapat humihingi ng tulong? Sa doctor na sasabihan kang mag sorry kay lord o kay manang na tiga benta ng abortion pills sa quiapo tas sobrang mahal pa? Ang hirap maging babae dito, yung nakabuntis nakakatakas at yung nabuntis kailangan maging mabuting ina kahit mag-isa na't lahat. Yung scene na nag uusap sila nina Miggy at tatay niya, arghh sorry pastor pero pakyu. Kadalasan sa totoong buhay, o sige nabuntis na nga buti papanagutan EH KASO anong kapalit?

As someone who belongs sa healthcare forces, ang hirap kung yung sistema natin hindi sinusuportahan yung nga katulad nilang maagang nabuntis, lalo na mga below 13yrs old. Myghod naiyak talaga ako dun sa ateng nabuntis ng tito niya. Marami nakong nabasa na irl stories na kinukutya daw sa hospital mga ganyan. Yung lalaking doctor sa sunshine arghh isa pang pakyu. Bakit tatanggihan ang buhay ng isang biktima dahil lamang sinubukan nilang ipalaglag yung batang nabuo in an illegal way din? Puta doctor ka sa lagay na yan, bakit ko hahayaan mamatay parehas kung kaya ko naman buhayin yung isa? Dahil sa sistema na pumipigil sa atin at sa mga paniniwala na matagal na tayong binabalot.

zkdlnbry,10,"“Sunshine” tackles urgent and relevant issues that are at the core of the current public health system in the Philippines. The film confronts the alarming rise in teenage pregnancies, a problem often worsen by a lack of sex education. It bravely addresses women's rights to choose, challenging the patriarchy that continues to influence societal norms in the country.The film's powerful message is that women have the right to be anything they want to be. They should have the final say over their bodies, their dreams, their choices, and their lives. No one should ever dictate who they are or what they can become. ""Sunshine"" makes a compelling case that a woman's decisions are her own, and outside opinions, particularly from men, are irrelevant. It is a story that empowers women, giving them a VOICE to be HEARD and a presence to be SEEN.""Sunshine"" is raw, relevant, and a catalyst for important conversations. It is not just a film; it is a reflection of the struggles faced by countless women. The movie fearlessly asks difficult questions and forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths. It's a story that deserves to be discussed by everyone, because Sunshine is more than just a character—she is a symbol of HOPE and COURAGE. Maris Racal's portrayal of Sunshine is the best. She perfectly captures the reality of a woman's struggle and the immense difficulty of navigating life in this world. The supporting cast is equally remarkable. Jennica Garcia and Annika Co deliver powerful performances that are essential to the film's impact. Every cast in this film was remarkable.A big big thank you to Direk Tonet Jadaone for her bravery and boldness in telling this story. Your work is consistently admirable because you don't just make films; you spark meaningful conversations that resonate long after the credits roll.Hindi mahirap maging babae sa mundo kung sa umpisa pa lang ang BABAE ay merong sariling desisyon para sa sarili nila at di dinidiktahan ng kung sino man.",2025-08-02,0,0,watch,True

acadia222,9,"overheard a girl in the restroom saying “at least mabait si [yung character] piolo” and maybe thats what makes this film effective and horrifying. patriarchalism masks itself in kindness, in family values, religious salvation, in medicine, in the thought of care. we are so deeply entangled in its edifice we cannot decipher care from control. against the backdrop of the sticky, restless, and noisy streets of manila, Sunshine becomes a suffocating experience. a formidable display of how patriarchy is insidious. even the reactions of the women around sunshine are outcomes of its thinking, sometimes its intentional, sometimes unaware. the judgement and unsolicited advice are concealed as concern and even sunshine herself isn’t free from it. it is literally manifested as an imaginary child that echoes her guilt, pressure, and the moral burden thats placed upon her. There are moments where its subtexts are parallel to Ernaux’s memoir Happening, which is visceral in its honesty about seeking abortion in 60s France, a time where it was illegal there. But Sunshine is dangerously current. Abortion remains illegal in the country because religion and patriarchy is deeply etched that it is indistinguishable from moral law (yet pamparegla pills in quiapo sit on the same shelves as statues of the infant jesus and still our agency must somehow exist in conflict with holiness.) in the final act, Sunshine’s choice is physically expressed through a routine. her movements make it seem her body is being wrapped in ribbons, constricted and suffocating, but as she continues, the bindings are loosened and ultimately released. the film’s profundity lies in its portrayal of abortion not as something easy nor devoid of consequences. it is contradicting: physically and emotionally excruciating but undeniably life saving.",2025-08-01,2,0,rewatch,False

kacecabali,8,"Sunshine is an important film—one that Filipinos shouldn’t miss. It’s not the strongest film, but it’s certainly worth discussing.In fact, it currently tops my list of Filipino movies this year. And that’s precisely why I feel a sense of disappointment. At the very least, I wish it had resonated more deeply. It had the potential to delve further into its realism, but instead, it chose to spoon-feed every emotional beat, leaving little room for quiet reflection. While I understand why Jadaone took this direction, I can’t say it worked for me.Personally, I wasn’t fully sold on the use of children as a narrative device. The way the film delivers its message too overtly makes the subplot involving the 13-year-old feel disconnected and distracting. The child character might have been more effective as a symbolic presence, her inner voice, her conscience. Had it stayed that way, rather than taking the more problematic route of literally giving life to unborn children, as in Ariana’s case, the film might have delivered a far more powerful impact.Still, there was a moment near the end, a line that marked a turning point of understanding and acceptance, where freedom was finally felt from guilt.

jrtawasil,8,"The OB admitting section was, and still is, one of the busiest parts of the hospital I worked in as an intern. It had been renovated prior to my first duty there, and it would be renovated once again after I'd left. Both of those renovations were done in part to address a persistent issue: that the place never runs out of patients. Every day, and especially on Mondays and Fridays, the admitting section would take in a significant number of expectant mothers with all sorts of conditions. Some would be giving birth for the first time. Some were veterans who were familiar to the staff working there, giving birth like clockwork every year. Some had serious conditions alongside their pregnancies that made giving birth extremely complicated, to the point where their current state posed a significant risk for death while giving birth. Nevertheless, they would slowly fill up the adjacent labor and delivery room, often two to three mothers to a stretcher. On very busy days the stretchers would run out, and the labor room would be filled with mothers settling down wherever they could, mostly on the cold, tiled floor.I remembered those days in the admitting section when I saw Antoinette Jadaone's latest film, Sunshine, about a young gymnast (Maris Racal) who gets pregnant right before a very important event that might lead to the SEA games and eventually the Olympics. Sunshine doesn't have any qualms about making the decision as she immediately gets to work trying to find an abortifacient to terminate the unwanted pregnancy. This process is not made easy. Miggy (Elijah Canlas), the man who impregnated Sunshine, wants nothing to do with her after learning of her pregnancy. He doesn't even tell her to have an abortion directly, only saying that 'she knows what to do.' Getting medical help is equally difficult, and intersects gender with class: medical treatment is expensive (despite the fact that state sponsored healthcare should be financially accessible) and as abortion is still illegal in the Philippines, people resort to black markets to seek the care they need.Once in a while, the OB admitting section will receive a patient who has lost her child. Miscarriages are common, and often they are spontaneous. Once, a mother of a stillborn child asked me if the cries in the next room were her child's, when I knew the infant was lying in a box, ready to be given to back to their parents. Then there are the other kinds of patients, ones who made a choice like Sunshine. They all had their reasons; this was a conscious and informed decision. After a while you know it when they come in. Sometimes the doctor would come in and tell them that what they did was illegal, some would even threaten to call the police. Nothing ever came of it; they were empty threats - often to 'scare' them into not making that decision again. It always made me uncomfortable.To be born a woman is to be born into violence, into a world where the odds are stacked against you. Sunshine is not the first film to depict this violence - films like Rae Red's Babae at Baril (2019) and Jadaone's own Fan Girl (2020) are two examples. They show what a deeply patriarchal society creates: people like Miggy and a certain other character near the end, people who I interpreted as not exactly archetypal or allegorical towards the structures that created them, but as the inevitable products of it. But unlike those two films that I mentioned earlier, Sunshine feels far more indignant, full of anger that Fan Girl lacked, and drawing towards a different conclusion compared to Babae at Baril.Quiapo has been a backdrop for many a Filipino film, and here it is a sanctuary of sorts. It is here where Sunshine goes to find the solution to her problems. Ironically draped in religious imagery, it both embodies the faith it represents (as a source of refuge for those who are in need) and as something that stands against its tenets.Sunshine is a film about choices: the choice to live one's own dream, the choice to live freely as the best person you can be. Sunshine's sister Geleen (Jennica Garcia) coaches Sunshine as she practices in their shared home. Certain background elements (thanks to the film's excellent production design) hint that Geleen, too, was once an aspiring gymnast, whose dreams ended with a baby. If she had the choice, would she have lived a different life? It shows as well in Geleen's character, and Garcia gives a standout performance as her.Finally, that idea of ""refuge"" may not refer to Quiapo, but something else entirely. Throughout the film there are many people, both seen and unseen, who help Sunshine in her quest. ""Ipagdadasal ko kayo,"" a hilot tells Sunshine after they bring a child to the hospital who made the same choice. ""Mag-ingat ka,"" another one tells Sunshine as she sets off. A sympathetic medical professional gives a knowing look. Every doctor has a story like it: in one of my last rotations at the labor room, a patient walked in nervously in the robe the hospital supplied her. It was a very busy day, and pregnant women overflowed on the stretchers and sat on the floor. She had no business being here: she looked no older than 14, and she should be going to school and playing with friends, not in the last stages of giving birth. Suffice it to say, this pregnancy was not her choice. If she had the choice like Sunshine did, would she be here? On the other hand, the point of the film for me is not whether one makes one choice over the other, but that people like Sunshine and that kid has the ability to choose in the first place.Because the labor and delivery room should be semi-sterile, companions (in this case, the kid's very worried mother) are not allowed in. But the rest of the mothers in that labor room heard us taking the medical history and heard her story. The other expectant mothers gave the kid their blankets, talked to and comforted her, up until she gave birth. Everyone was that kid's mother that day. In a world where you are denied agency, where one is subjected to violence from birth, the least women can do is find refuge in each other.",2025-07-31,39,2,watch,False

It felt like the film held back, especially in its screenplay and pacing. But as I reflected more on it, I realized that might have been the point—although many of the scenes were commendably filmed, the film wasn’t trying to entertain; it was trying to confront. Maliban sa mismong tema ng storya, sobrang daming iba pang paghihirap na danas ng lipunan natin na mismo ako ay hindi aware ang naipakita sa pelikula.The rawness and silence I initially perceived as weaknesses were actually reflections of Sunshine herself—caught between the pressures of gymnastics and the weight of her misfortunes. In that light, I came to see that her quietness was powerful and already served as the message.The film was created not just to tell Sunshine’s story, but to help us recognize the many ""Sunshines"" around us—especially in the Philippines, where abortion remains heavily stigmatized due to political control and religious conservatism. Sunshine challenges us to understand their pain and see their urgent need for help.I truly hope that someday, those in power will recognize that safe and legal abortion is not just a debate—it’s a right every Filipina deserves to have.",2025-08-01,1,0,watch,False

jnllynley,10,"""Ang pangarap ko ay pangarap niya."" This line, spoken by the child, sums up the entire film. It’s simple, heartfelt, and my favorite line. People may have their own interpretations, but this is how I personally understood it.Sunshine has an older sister, Ate Geleen, played by Jennica Garcia. Ate Geleen was once a gymnast, just like Sunshine. But now, she takes care of her child. The film doesn’t say it outright, but it’s clear that Ate Geleen gave up her dreams and career to raise her baby. Why did she give it all up? We don't know. But maybe it’s because she’s the eldest daughter — the one expected to take care of her siblings, the one who is supposed to work harder, sacrifice more, and carry the heaviest weight.Mahirap maging babae, lalo na kung ikaw ang panganay na anak ng pamilya.Maybe that’s also the very reason why she’s so supportive of Sunshine’s decision — to have an abortion, to chase her dreams, and to not follow in her footsteps. Ate Geleen knows exactly what it’s like to give up everything, and she doesn’t want her younger sister to carry the same burden she did.The movie ended with Ate Geleen proudly looking at Sunshine while holding her baby. Dahil ang pangarap ni Sunshine ay siya ring pangarap ni Ate Geleen na hindi niya natupad.",2025-07-28,0,0,rewatch,False

Like I love how Sunshine visited QUIAPO Church first, then went to Miggy's school ALL THE WAY in DEL MONTE AVE, QUEZON CITY (Sha Tin in the background and I recognize Miggy's school), smashed his car in his school's parking spot, then ran TO RECTO AVE, MANILA to avoid being caught 😭😭😭 Never skipped leg day si Sunshine.On a serious note, I love how it is way much more than a pro-choice/pro-abortion movie. It champions compassion and understanding first through the many hardships that pregnancy poses in a country where abortion is very much illegal. It's uncomfortable at times, heartbreaking at others, but in spite of the pain and desperation, it's also empathetic at times too, like with Thea and Sunshine's siblings. Love her sister especially.The only reason why I gave it a 4.5 stars is because there are some... SOME moments where nabitin ako, like I wish the runtime could be a little longer so we could flesh out some aspects of the film, like Doc Helena, Migs and his dad, and the ending, to name some.Overall, I'm SOO GLAD I saw this film.

esnufilm,10,"let me just say na MARIS RACAL IS SUCH AN AMAZING ACTRESS. totoong haggard nga siya (lol), pero ‘yung haggardness niya, that actually added to everything. you can see the pain, the exhaustion, and the heaviness in every scene—it all felt so real.. grabe, nakakamangha talaga siyang panoorin. sobrang husay niya, and because of that, sunshine didn’t feel like a film at all—it felt like someone letting you into her world. it felt like sunshine was sitting beside me, telling her story, and all i could do was listen and feel everything.from the very beginning, klaro na kay sunshine kung ano ang gusto niya. hindi ang maging nanay, kundi ang makasali sa Philippines' national gymnastics team. but the world she lives in kept pushing her into a corner. this film tackled more than just abortion—it exposed how cruel the system is to women, lalo na sa pilipinas. it showed the weight of religious beliefs forced onto our bodies, the cycle of abuse, and the daily injustices women face just for existing. napakahirap maging babae sa pilipinas tangina.lahat ng lalaki sa pelikula—si miggy, 'yung tito ni menggay, si tatay ni miggy, pati ‘yung doktor—lahat sila, galit na galit ako. bakit babae lagi ang kailangang mag-sakripisyo? bakit babae ang kailangang mag-adjust, magpatawad, magtiis? putangina talaga. and yet, these characters weren’t exaggerated. they were too real. which makes it even more terrifying—kasi alam nating totoo ‘to. it happens. it’s still happening.what haunted me most were menggay’s scenes. dun talaga ako tuluyang naiyak. ang sakit sakit. gusto ko siyang yakapin, gusto ko siyang ipagtanggol. bata pa lang siya pero pasan na niya 'yung bigat ng mundong hindi naman niya kasalanan. sana sa lahat ng menggay, may sunshine sa buhay nila. and then there was anikka. nung una, akala ko multo siya o guni-guni lang. pero habang tumatagal, i realized—she was sunshine’s imaginary child. or maybe her younger self. or both. she represents so much: a lost dream, a piece of sunshine. kaya ‘yung eksena sa dulo, when anikka said “gets ko na,” it wasn’t just her talking—it was also sunshine finally accepting her own decision. grabe ‘yung iyak ko dun. that should be enough. a woman’s choice should be enough.the film also showed that women, at our best, are each other’s safe space. si coach, si doktora, yung kaibigan, most especially ‘yung ate niya—lahat sila, may dalang simpatya. yung presence nila nagsasabing “nandito ako.” yung scene na tumabi yung ate niya sa higaan sobrang nakakalungkot panoorin. it reminded me that the first place we should feel supported is at home. buti na lang at nandiyan ang ate ni sunshine dahil minsan sapat na ‘yung maramdaman mong hindi ka nag-iisasunshine isn’t just a movie. it’s a wake-up call. it asks us to reflect—bakit tayo mabilis humusga? bakit kulang ang pag-unawa? and most of all, bakit kailangang maging matatag ang babae para lang mabuhay nang payapa? sunshine is a beautiful, heartbreaking, and necessary film. hindi lang siya basta panoorin. kailangan mo siyang damdamin. hindi ka niya pipilitin, pero hahayaan ka niyang mag-reflect, in your own time and your own way.huge congratulations to everyone who worked on this film. sana mas maraming makapanood. sana mas maraming makaintindi",2025-08-01,0,0,watch,True

daiskeiz,10,"gets ko naSo many still don’t understand, but it’s enough that some do.This film is brave—fearlessly made, carefully thought out, and clearly crafted from the heart.When I watched it, all I wanted to do was hold Sunshine—hold every Sunshine out there who I know is carrying the weight of this harsh, terrifying society.I still can’t get over the fact that this was shown in Philippine cinemas because, finally, it got the visibility it truly deserves. This is the kind of film the world should see. When I finished watching it, I already knew the state and how our society would portray abortion and how it was always deemed evil and inhumane but after seeing this film, I felt a sense of relief that finally, a film about women, about abortion, about its effects, not just mentally but physically, and how sometimes, we really just have to understand, for who are we to judge someone who really is just fighting to live through and view women in a way that they should be, respected.Even the supporting characters—especially Jennica Garcia—were brilliant. I felt her love for her sister so deeply. Even when Sunshine thought the world had turned its back on her, her sister’s presence was a constant reminder that someone was still there, always beside her, fully aware of the struggles she faced—struggles made heavier because she’s a woman.Also a huge role that was portrayed by Rhed Bustamante. Just, wow. It was a story meant to be told and written. It isn't just fiction it's currently happening today and that's why it should be a story that needed to be shed light on. It was tragic, painful to look at but it was real, all of it, and that's what makes it a story worth telling.And Maris Racal—what a phenomenal actress. Her cries pierce right through you. Her frustration, her courage, her strength as a woman—all of it shines through. In Sunshine, I saw her desperation, her bravery, her womanhood, and her relentless grasp on her dreams, refusing to let them slip away.Maris and Direk Tonet knew exactly what they wanted to tell their audience, and I’m so glad they did it with such courage. They gave voice to women like Sunshine—women who are still too afraid to scream their truths.I hope this film becomes a beacon for people like Sunshine, the way she brings life to every twirl of her ribbon and every movement of her body to the rhythm. There are so many like her still hidden in the shadows of fear and guilt. And yes, we all know that in the Philippines, some mindsets are hard to change—but does it have to stop there? Will we allow people like Sunshine to remain caged by a judgmental society?Maybe for now, it’s hard. But because of this film, women like Sunshine can finally catch a glimpse of hope.:’)",2025-08-02,0,0,watch,True

siramaris,8,"Honestly, 3.5 stars for the movie overall, but here's extra 0.5 star for the super random cameo that was also somehow super on the nose. It's such a good bit that amuses me to no end. I'd rate the movie higher if not for a plot device that felt completely unnecessary and at times distracting. Take it away, and it won't even change anything about the movie. Every time they employed this plot device, it was just so unnecessary and distracting. The movie also squeezed in too many ""unwanted pregnancy"" tropes that it risked being too bloated story-wise. Think of an ""unwanted pregancy"" trope, it's there. They stop short of it being too bloated at the expense of the story (and you have to give it to Antoinette Jadaone for this balancing act), though I still spent a good chunk of the movie wondering how many more tropes were coming. Still the movie is brave, and is made so much better for its bravery. It does not shy away from the realities faced by so many women in this country when it comes to maternal health. It tackled head-on the heavily religious overtones that tends to dominate the conversations around this topic. It shows the ironic juxtaposition of abortion pills being sold next to religious artifacts. But most importantly, it does not get preachy. It does not feel like it is patronizing the audience about what should be in each scene that squeezes your heart, it just shows it. But also Jennica Garcia steals the show in every scene is in. Maris Racal deserves the accolades she's getting for carrying the movie so steadily as its lead and with everything asked of her for the character. But Jennica Garcia just commands every scene even she doesn't say a word. And every scene these two have together was really gold-medal worthy.",2025-08-02,0,0,watch,False

It hit hard, especially thinking about those who’ve gone through abuse—women, children, even the ones who never had the courage to speak up.Sure, there were a few funny scenes—maybe to ease the weight of the story—but the truth behind it stays. It’s heavy, it’s real, and it’s heartbreaking.We can’t just look away anymore. These kids and young women who’ve lived through this kind of nightmare… they need to be seen, heard, and protected.

lesquatrecoups,10,"Sunshine sa Kuko ng MaynilaKasama ng mga pelikulang may “maynila” sa titulo na kamakailan ko lang napanood, bukod sa pagpupunit ng bandila ng konserbatibong paniniwala na nagmula sa kristiyanismo, pinapakita din ng Sunshine ang siyudad ng Maynila sa gabi—kung saan imbes na pag-asa, sumpa ang pangunahing kaluluwa na hinihinga’t tinitiis ng mga mamamayan. Sa labas ng simbahan makikita ang mga illegal na medesinang pampalaglag na nagsisilbi bilang pagasa para sa maraming kababaihan marahil ang institusyon sa harapan ng mga tindahang ito, ang simbahan, ang may kapangyarihan kahit na sabihing progresibo na ang mga paniniwala ng tao. Sa isang eksena, si Sunshine ay nagbuwis buhay sa isang masikip na motel sa Avenida, dala dala ang boteng pampalaglag, nagdudugo, nanghihingalo palabas habang patuloy ang pagtakbo ng LRT, at nagising nalang sa ospital, puno ng mga babaeng tinitiis ang hindi makataong pampublikong pasilidad.Halos 500 teenager ang nagiging ina araw araw. Kung legal lamang ang pagpapalaglag, ang mga numerong ito’y mababawasan. Isa sa may pinaka mabigat na istorya ay ang karakter ni Rhed Bustamante na si Menggay, isang 13 taong gulang na binuntis ng kaniyang tito. Kaniyang sinusundan si Sunshine at ibang mga babae, upang humingi ng pampalaglag. Nililibot niya ang Maynila na may tiyang di nararapat para sa isang dalaga. Tulad ni Sunshine, si Menggay ay pinadala rin sa ospital. Ngunit di natin siyang nakitang gumising. Ang pelikula ni Jadaone ay paniguradong titignan ng mga iskolar bilang “classic” makalipas ang ilang taon, tulad ng Manila by Night at Maynila Sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag. Isa sa mga susi ng pagtatagumpay ng storyang ito ay naiintindihan nito ang mga karakter na kinekwento bilang mga tao at hindi lamang teksto. Madaling tapusin ang mga pelikulang may realismo sa trahedya ngunit hindi pinili ni Jadaone ang direksyong iyon. Ang titulong “Sunshine” ay sumisimbolo rin sa diwa ng Pilipino—madalas masiyahin at nakakahanap pa rin ng ilaw sa madidilim na eskenita, matatatag (o resilient). Dahil tayo’y kilala sa ganitong paraan, madali tayong abusuhin ng ating gobyerno. Labag raw sa batas ng diyos ang pagpapalaglag ng bata ngunit sa ganitong pagiisip, sa pagproprotekta ng mga hindi pa naisisilang, pinapatay ang ating mga kababaihan. Ngunit isa sa mga ipinakita sa pelikulang ito ay ang mga babae na nakikiramay kay Sunshine, kahit man ito’y makulit na bata, o kapatid na nagsilbing nanay, o kahit mga babae sa post maternal ward na nakakaintindi ng sakit na nadarama ng karakter ni Maris Racal at ang mga Sunshine sa Pilipinas. Mahaba pa ang magiging lakbay patungo sa bansang kayang tumanggap na isang karapatan ng babae ang awtonomiya ng kaniyang katawan, ngunit sa pelikulang ito, at sa pagdami ng mga manonood, nagkakaroon ng espayo upang magbukas ang mga usaping tinuturing “taboo”.",2025-08-01,1,0,watch,True

It didn’t, in any way, fall short of anything I hoped for. From the direction to the casting, sobrang ganda… and I wish I were exaggerating.Una, Antoinette Jadaone, what a director you are. Throughout the movie, the words “Ang galing” kept escaping my mouth. The camera angles were beautiful, the timing of the sound production was marvelous, the screenplay was solid—everything was on point. Sunshine satisfied my standards for aesthetics when it comes to film.Pangalawa, Maris. Hands down—sobrang talentadong babae talaga. Setting her issue aside, she’s a versatile actress. She embodied Sunshine so well that I felt myself completely absorbed in the story. Dagdag pa riyan si Jennica Garcia, another golden star. I knew her through Saving Grace, and doon pa lang, sobrang namangha na ako sa kakayahan niya. I need to see her in more films. Halos lahat naman kung tutuusin—they have done a tremendous job with their performances. Everything felt so real.Pangatlo, the script? Hello? Ang natural. It wasn’t like her other directed movie, Uninvited, na puro mura. This time, it was profanity with purpose. (haha) The lines were written and delivered so well that it made me stop and think how observing plays such a vital role in every profession. Lalo na rito. Kaya tagos sa puso, kasi totoo. Nangyayari ‘to.At panghuli, the hidden message. In every movie, I like to believe that there’s at least a little advocacy screaming through every minute. In this case, it’s the consideration of legalizing abortion in the Philippines. Maraming mga hindi kayang bumuhay ng anak, mga hindi kayang sustentahan ang isang tao, at mga taong sinamantala lamang. Even with these reasons, is it still not right to consider abortion? One might counter, “Pwede mo namang ipaalaga sa kamag-anak o sa mga magulang.” But the truth is: life is much more complex than that. It is so much more complicated because there are cases like this in real life, where the only family they have is their siblings... Some only have themselves.…Hays, basta abstinence talaga dapat guys!I love everything about this movie. I love how it depicts the reality some pregnant teenagers go through—even those who have dreams. I believe I have more to say, but I’d like to reflect on that myself.

Sunshine is a film that meant something and moved with purpose.Hindi siya sumisigaw ng “tignan mo ako.” Pero hindi mo rin siya kayang i-ignore. It sits with you. Stays with you. Makes you ask things you usually avoid.At sa ending, walang fireworks. Walang dramatic breakdown, walang moral lesson na pilit. Pero andun yung bigat. Yung linaw. Yung paninindigan.Sunshine made a choice: tahimik, matatag, at alam niyang hindi lahat makakaintindi. Pero hindi rin niya kailangang ipaliwanag. Katawan niya ’yon. Buhay niya ’yon.At sa pagpili niya, may kirot, oo. Pero may ginhawa rin. May lungkot, pero may pag-asa. Kasi for once, isang babaeng Pilipina ang pinayagang pumili para sa sarili niya, at hindi siya pinarusahan.Hindi siya ginawang trahedya.Ginawa siyang posibilidad.At sana mas dumami pa ang ganitong kwento, yung mga kwentong hindi sinusukat sa sakripisyo kundi sa kalayaan. Yung mga babaeng hindi inaasahang sumunod, kundi tinuturuang magtanong ng: “Ano ba talaga ang gusto ko? At handa ba akong ipaglaban ito?”Because at the end of the day, whether it’s about your career, your body, or your future, ikaw dapat ang may final say. Hindi ang mundo. Hindi ang ingay.

maestaels,9,"to live in a society where your most personal decisions are controlled by external forces and outdated structures… it’s exhausting.after watching the film today, i found myself deep in thought as i left the cinema. it was so real and raw. like, genuinely, an eye-opener. the film just beautifully, but also painfully, shows how interconnected everything is. your sex education, or lack thereof, impacts your healthcare system access, your personal moral compass, and of course, your dreams and your passion. it really hit home how incredibly hard it is to be a woman especially here in the philippines, with all our deeply ingrained religious beliefs, particularly around topics like abortion. it’s just so disheartening to hear all the harsh opinions and these strong pushes for anti-abortion laws, especially when they come from people who aren't personally dealing with those difficult, life-altering situations. it’s so easy for some to just state an anti-abortion stance, but the reality for a woman wrestling with such a complex decision is so much more nuanced and personal.you hear it all the time: choosing to terminate a pregnancy is selfish. but then i genuinely wonder, isn't it also selfish to bring a child into the world if you're not fully ready, or if you're uncertain about the future that motherhood brings? in a country that can be so conservative, we really, really need a broader, more compassionate discussion. we need to figure out how to support women and their choices, whatever they may be. not all women want to be mothers. not all women want to be impregnated. even i, personally, don't want to be a mother. and that's okay. it’s time we should be open to talking about these topics, really opening up our minds, and stop letting our religious beliefs completely go into our way of empathy and understanding. this movie just amplified that for me. ang galing galing mo, maris.",2025-08-02,0,0,watch,True

yvonnelouise,9,"“Saan ka pupunta?”—Di ko alam.“Mahirap ’yan. Tumatakbo at hindi alam kung saan ang pupuntahan.”These words pierce through the screen because they echo the confusion and helplessness felt by so many young women who were never taught what to do, only what not to become.The film refuses to sensationalize and instead, it exposes how a girl’s so-called mistake (often rooted not in her choices but in a partner’s negligence or acts of abuse) can lead to an avalanche of lost dreams, happiness, and possibility. Sunshine becomes every girl who was failed by sex education, every young woman silenced by stigma, and every teenager blamed instead of held.Running beneath the narrative is a critique of the Philippine healthcare system. Sunshine does not receive proper maternal support. She is not offered structured care, options, or safe counseling. Instead, she moves through her pregnancy in silence guided only by whispered advice, black market pills, and the cold gaze of people. Clinics do not offer refuge, hospitals feel clinical in the worst way. Rushed. Underfunded. Emotionally vacant. Healthcare here is not healing but a trauma repackaged as procedure.What I find striking is how the film threads the idea of stigma into the structure itself. It’s the system. How fear, silence, and judgment strip away any chance for recovery, much less dignity. And this is where Sunshine dares to challenge its viewers. The existence of this movie forces a confrontation. Sunshine doesn’t preach, but it demands to be seen. It tells the story of a girl who chose herself. In a world that expected her to stop, she kept going, and that choice changed everything.“Naiintindihan mo na ba ako?”—Gets ko na.",2025-08-03,1,0,watch,True

There were enough reasons laid out throughout the film validates her choice, and you see the life that she leads. The hallucination of her own child is her own manifestation of the guilt that haunts her — which tells you she still has hesitations and ramdam niya yung kahihiyan ng mga desisyon niya.

At sa kabilang banda naman, napoportray dito yung bond na nabubuo ng mga kababaihan sa loob ng pyudal na lipunan. Ilang beses akong naiyak habang nanonood, especially nung scene na ni Maris na nagtake siya ng pampalaglag. Ang bigat panoorin nito actually, kasi what do you mean na para mabawi ko yung buhay na mayroon ako before, kailangan kong pumunta ng Quiapo para bumili ng pampalaglag at pagdaanan yung sakit para lang duguin ako ulit? Sunod pa ay yung dinala si Rhed sa hospital dahil binuntis siya ng tito niya. 13 lang siya. Ang mga ganitong klaseng halimbawa ay pinapakita kung gaano ka-devastating yung fact na walang tulong ang narereceive ng mga kababaihan with this kind of situation. Meron naman siguro, pero mahirap at hindi lahat ay may kakayahang makakuha nitong ""tulong"" na ito dahil halos lahat ay kailangan ng pera.Nakaka-mind fuck yung situation ni Rhed (kahit short amount of time lang sha ron s film) kasi sa lipunan natin ngayon, ang daming batang babae ang nabubuntis, at bawat taon, pababa nang pababa ang edad ng mga ito. Ngunit, sino ba ang bumubuntis sakanila?Ang abortion ay hindi isang paraan upang mag-promote ng sarap sa sex sa mga kabataan;And with films like this, maganda yung na-aacknowledge na may ganitong klaseng pangyayari sa lipunan. Pero kagaya ng iba pang pelikula that tackles issues like this ay tulad ng 'Uninvited,' bakit hanggang acknowledge lang?Sa role ni Maris bilang Sunshine, pinapakita nito ang journey niya sa loob ng mundong nangguguiltrip and self-devoted Christians, matatanda, etc etc (at napepersonify itong guilt na to through the character of Bata (played by annika)), nakita niya na may mga batang nabubuntis, nakita niya na may judgement agad yung mga tao sa tulad niya, nakita niya na hindi madaling nakakatanggap at nakakahingi ng tulong yung mga nasa sitwasyon niya—pero even after all these, walang self-reflection or closure yung film or yung character ni Sunshine mismo (since first-hand niyang nawitness and naexperience lahat) sa lahat ng issue na naipakita.

jellobee,9,"Sunshine is a bold and compelling story about when passion collides with unforeseen circumstances. Delivering a powerful performance, Maris Racal gives light to Sunshine, a bright and hopeful teen gymnast whose Olympic dreams come crashing down after an unplanned pregnancy. While the film is beautiful aesthetically, it’s also dark and grim as it not only deals with a controversial subject matter, but is also an accurate reflection of Philippine culture and society.I love stories that involve moral dillemas — stories that make the character choose between two conflicting moral values. This is the case for Sunshine, whose choice is either to abort her baby to reach her Olympic dream, a goal she’s dreamt of in years; or keep the baby as this is deemed the morally right thing to do. Set in the Philippine context, one of the most religious countries in the world, that is one of the hardest dilemmas to have, and I thought the film gave justice to what Maris’ character had to go through.Maris deserves her props for this as well. She was an acting powerhouse, delivering and making the audience feel everything she was going through right out of the screen. It seemed like she trained legitimately for all the stunts, too. All these efforts made the film much more impactful and grounded.Visually, this is what I imagined the City of Manila is like on film. The city, while beautiful to look at, lying beneath it feels like a sense of grime and moral corruption, which blended well with the film’s theme.But aside from a couple of narrative choices made, I really liked this film. Sunshine, while beautiful, is also a haunting reminder of the everyday struggle of the common Filipino. A Filipino who has goals and dreams but is blindsided by forces beyond their control but chooses to push through. It’s an empowering film that I think will leave its mark for years to come.",2025-08-02,0,0,watch,True

Filipino society's marites culture and religious evangelism no less is bound to have an effect on Sunshine's life and that was something I wished to see her persevere through post-abortion...but I do also respect the need to end Sunshine's story on a more hopeful note, as that message of sheer hope and optimism is probably more important than portraying an already familiar reality.",2025-08-02,0,0,watch,False

andyyvill,9,"For Every Woman (Para sa bawat Babae) It’s hard to fully grasp what women go through in our society, what more if you’re living in a country like the Philippines, where there aren’t enough laws to protect women’s rights. This movie is a wake-up call, an eye-opener, a voice for the voiceless women. It sheds light on major issues we often sweep under the rug like, sexual assault, teenage pregnancy, public healthcare, poverty, child abuse, and most especially, abortion. These are real, painful realities in the Philippines and we need to talk about them. We need tangible solutions. We need action from our government.As for the cast, whoever handled the casting, hats off. Every single actor in this film delivered. No weak links. Maris Racal completely embodied Sunshine. It wasn’t Maris I saw on screen, it was Sunshine. I know she’s getting a lot of praise for her impeccable, flawless acting here, and she absolutely deserves it.But let me also talk about Annika Co and Jennica Garcia. Annika was incredible in this film. From funny to irritating to heartbreaking, she nailed every single scene. She held her own alongside veteran actors, and that’s not easy dude. And Jennica Garcia? Her eyes, that “mata-mata acting” 👏🏻. In one confrontation scene where she barely had lines, her eyes told the whole story, you could feel out of the screen that she’d do anything for Sunshine. She’s the older sister we all deserve.And the rest of the cast, Elijah Canlas, Xyriel Manabat, Meryll Soriano, Ar-Yuh-Nuh (JM), Rhed Bustamante and the others...damn, perfection! They ate and left no crumbs, mothered!!!This film serves rawness. It’s honest (the Quiapo, to searching from Reddit, X, FB) . It almost feels like a documentary film type. From the gritty shots of Manila’s streets to the realness of the lines, these are the same things we hear in actual situations like this. The script cuts deep. The weight of each line… it’s crushing, full of heavy emotions. Major kudos to Direk Antoinette Jadaone for creating films that reflect the harsh realities of life in the Philippines, especially the realities that women face, the never-ending battle against a society that dictates what a woman should do with her body, the shame, the guilt, and the silence they’re forced to carry. I hope more films like this are made, films like Pamilya Ordinaryo, Birdshot, and now, this. This film deserves AWARDS. I’m also amazed by the cinematography, the color grading, the symbolism of the two children, the sound (especially the NATSOT from Manila, ang lala beh, it really adds so much depth to every scene). This movie will make you laugh, cry, and feel pain. But above all, it stirs the mind and hits the heart, also it carries a message that matters. Message that needs to be heard, seen, and acted upon.The story arc is solidddd. The ending? Not abrupt, not lacking, it was just right. Perfectly right! To every Sunshine out there “gets na namin kayo.” Compassion shouldn’t depend on religion, gender, or social status. These aren’t just stories. This is real life. And we need bold, brave storytellers to bring these realities to light. Highly recommended. Another title could be ""HALA PASALAMAT KA""",2025-08-02,0,0,watch,True

Quiet, raw, and unapologetic. Hindi ito comfort film. Hindi rin ito film na may malinis na aral sa dulo. Sa halip, isa itong tahimik pero galit na sigaw sa bansang patuloy na tinuturing ang kababaihan bilang incubator, atleta, o anak—pero hindi bilang ganap na tao. It’s not even a loud film. Antoinette didn’t spoon-feed, and that’s exactly why it hurts.She frames Maris not as a victim, but as a girl with agency. Sa kamay ng ibang director, baka naging sermon to.

She is always dead worried about us, and about how she can even carry herself at the age of 40.I hope this film helps people realize Sunshine humanizes all Filipino women who endure such a heavy living— heavy dreams, heavy hearts, and heavy standards.

ahearticy,10,"""Drown out the noise!""I watched this film just hours before I turned twenty (teenage graduate). After a year of waiting for it to be released here in the Philippines, I can say—it was absolutely worth it.What makes it so powerful is its courage to open the conversation about abortion and reproductive health in a deeply religious country like ours. It doesn't hold back. As a society, we need to be more open to the realities women face, and ask ourselves what we can do collectively, especially what the government can and should do. ""Mahirap maging babae, lalo na dito sa Pinas"".The film is raw and relevant. Sunshine is real. Her character struck a chord, and I saw glimpses of my past classmates and friends in the struggles of Maris Racal and Rhed Bustamante’s roles. The film tackles poor awareness and lack of access to health facilities, while also confronting religious beliefs and cultural norms head-on.It really centers on abortion—not to promote it, but to open the conversation, especially for conservative audiences. It is still a taboo and personally, I hold a progressive stand on abortion, and seeing it presented this way felt affirming.I also loved the use of symbolism—from the “Gift of God” jeepney that Sunshine rides on her way to Quiapo, to her choosing not to enter the church even while seeking God’s guidance. Those subtle moments say so much.I admire how it ends with the strong message that women own their bodies and have the right to choose and decide—whether or not it goes against religious or cultural expectations.This film is more than a story, it’s a tool. A voice. A reflection of many who share the same experiences as Sunshine.

rainiersulla,10,"Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine is an absolute cinematic gut-punch. Sunshine, the titular character played by Maris Racal, is on her way to Olympic glory, her dreams already in the bag. It takes a missed period and a couple of pink lines to veer her off-course. And just like that, she crashes headlong into a society that’s dead set on denying women their bodily autonomy. Racal’s performance is where the film’s soul resides. She embodies Sunshine with a physicality and emotional depth that’s fully felt from start to finish. Her sobs are painful to watch, but she’s given some respite she can hold onto: the comradeship among women. Jennica Garcia’s Geleen, Sunshine’s older sister, is a particular standout.Fittingly, Jadaone is not soft around the edges, and the film is unflinching in its message. Yet Sunshine never feels preachy or didactic. Because, to be fair, there’s really no neat, easy, and one-size-fits-all resolution for women like Sunshine.

It doesn’t have a resolution nor does the message really sticks it landing. It is however, simply a story told that is based on the bits and pieces of reality that we can only conceive. It’s a conversation starter, but its certainly does not explore much of the topic that its centered on. So much so that the film doesn’t really let you grow to care about the Protagonist’s support system, thus their presence, their wisdom and their comfort, falls flat in terms of having and relevance to you. There are moments wherein I enjoyed the humor, but you can only do so much with curse words in dialogues that it starts to sound like Daryl Yap’s films, the only difference here is that it handled a topic that’s taboo and has managed to deliver its point across, however at the expense of being safe enough to be told, but less poignant and thought provoking to be considered as something to be discussed in depth.

fallenexp,8,"Ang galing ni Maris! She mothered that role. No pun intended.I'm not really fond of Filipino films as they always fail to peek my interest when it comes to filmmaking. However, if the movie talks about social and political issues like it has in SUNSHINE, I can tune and lock in.SUNSHINE is straightforward to its message. It's about dealing with abortion in a country where not only is illegal but also discriminated hardly. A sensitive topic portrayed with a really good script by Jadaone. What a complete package in terms of writing. The story is justified.Even though I may have found the climactic moments not explosive enough, I'm sure the average Filipino conservative does. Personally, I am pro-abortion and I believe women have the rights to their own bodies. I'm glad the movie went in the direction I wanted. As someone who has seen a lot of abortion films in Holywood, this is the first Filipino. And I just applaud everyone in this project for the risk and making a statement through SUNSHINE. For that, it's already a big win for independent Filipino cinema as theaters flock and raise the demand. Because at the end of the day, a movie is not only good if it's good, but also if it sparks conversation. Hundreds of essays and reviews are out there for this film. It makes the whole movie going experience worth it even more.#Sunshine 4/5",2025-08-03,6,0,watch,False

Batid ng pelikula na ang karapatan sa aborsyon ang tanging daan ng bidang si Sunshine Francisco tungo sa kanyang pangarap na makalundag sa Olympics.Ngunit sa paglalarawan sa paghihirap ni Sunshine bilang isang abstraksiyong siya lamang ang humaharap, naisantabi ang pagkakataong maging paanyaya ang pelikula upang bulatlatin ang panlipunang estruktura sa likod ng kanyang pagdurusa.Hindi rin tuluyang tumagos palabas ng sinehan ang tindig na itinanghal nito para sa kababaihan.

yeoshua,10,"[will edit later, for now this is my initial thoughts]Gets kita, Sunshine!Abortion is not just a decision—it's a process. It's never easy. We saw how sunshine depicted guilt, anxiety, and contemplation throughout the film, which mirrors many women's lived experiences. The more we don't talk about this kind of topic and deny women's bodily autonomy, the more women to seek unsafe alternatives—like hilot at pamaparegla sa quiapo—which can lead to death and complications. ""Baka next president yang dinadala mo pero ipapalaglag mo lang"" pano magiging next president ang isang baby kung yung nanay nya walang mapakain sa kanya at walang pera para mapaaral sya? Pro-life lang kayo kapag nasa tyan ng nanay, pero wala na kayong pake after that. Sunshine is just one of many women who also have a dreams for themselves. If giving birth is for you, good for you and it's a valid choice. But for some, it was never an option because they have big dream to fulfill and personal stories as to why they want to make that decision. I love it when Dir. Toñet Jadaone creates characters who are goal-driven and ambitious— Christine(Alone/Together), Vilma(Beauty in a bottle), and now Sunshine. Throughout the film, it felt like Sunshine already had a decision and she's firm with it. She's going to do it regardless of what will happen. I hope in the future, there will be legal medical practices that provides safe abortions, because there's an urgent need for them.",2025-08-03,0,0,watch,True

Para akong ibinalik sa mga oras na iyon. ‘Di ko mapigilang mag-isip kung nagawa ko bang maging katulad ni Geleen. Kung nakapag-offer ba ako ng enough understanding at compassion kagaya ni Geleen. Surface-level lang pala ang alam ko sa struggles niya noon, dahil hanggang doon lang naman ang kaya kong malaman at maintindihan even as a gay guy and a feminist. There is so much more struggles to abortion than just making a decision— it inevitably comes with guilt, shame, and fear to which the film portrayed effectively.One thing is for sure, ang hirap na nga maging babae— mas lalo pa sa Pilipinas. Poverty, bulok na public health system, lack of access to reproductive rights— all were tackled with so much bravery, honesty, and rawness. Ang husay ng lahat ng bumuo ng pelikulang ito, on and off cam. Thank you Direk Jada One at Maris na haggard. Thank you Papa God sa buhay nila eme.Catch the film.

The two powerful drives of men according to Napoleon.But Sunshine is a woman— a gymnast, one of the few sports considered most feminine—one of those burning out athletes who lives by flexibility, by bending yourself in all possible corners to become this perfect beautiful being. So yes, maybe she was driven by fear and love for gymnastics, but why not?Her panic walks bending through eskinitas, the close ups on Maris’ expressive eyes unyielding despite the fear, and the overwhelming passionate Filipino noise shiver through the gritty scene of Manila and it feeds us, the audience, a rhythmic choreography of the most tender experience of a woman. Manila succumbs her, a fragile thin young girl on the verge of losing it all. And I fucking loved and consumed it.I love it too much I felt the giddiness through the tips of my fingers when the first scene at Quiapo entered, Sunshine in panic crying inside the jeep, and the first thing I thought was, “putangina si Julio ng Maynila sa Kuko ng Liwanag.”Yes maybe Sunshine enjoyed doing it with Miggy, and maybe seen the near death process of getting rid of it through Mary Grace, felt the catholic guilt, and that maybe her drive to success is to disregard what could be (motherhood) but still, ultimately still, tender is the flesh of a woman who wants to be in life. Like Julio (my shayla), tender is the flesh that holds all possibilities in life. The difference is, the tragedy of Brocka’s Julio is the absence of grounded support systems. Sunshine became her own because of the people and the women in her life who understood and grieved with her.Ito ang kasagutan sa katanungang paano naging kapantay Lino Brocka, Ishmael, Mario O’Hara si Dir.
